https://openalex.org/W2125284466,"Quantum electrodynamics (resulting from the merger of quantum mechanics and relativity theory) has provided a clear understanding of phenomena ranging from particle physics to cosmology and from astrophysics to quantum chemistry1,2,3. The ideas underlying quantum electrodynamics also influence the theory of condensed matter4,5, but quantum relativistic effects are usually minute in the known experimental systems that can be described accurately by the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation. Here we report an experimental study of a condensed-matter system (graphene, a single atomic layer of carbon6,7) in which electron transport is essentially governed by Dirac's (relativistic) equation. The charge carriers in graphene mimic relativistic particles with zero rest mass and have an effective ‘speed of light’ c* ≈ 106 m s-1. Our study reveals a variety of unusual phenomena that are characteristic of two-dimensional Dirac fermions. In particular we have observed the following: first, graphene's conductivity never falls below a minimum value corresponding to the quantum unit of conductance, even when concentrations of charge carriers tend to zero; second, the integer quantum Hall effect in graphene is anomalous in that it occurs at half-integer filling factors; and third, the cyclotron mass mc of massless carriers in graphene is described by E = mcc*2. This two-dimensional system is not only interesting in itself but also allows access to the subtle and rich physics of quantum electrodynamics in a bench-top experiment."
https://openalex.org/W2118492507,"When electrons are confined in two-dimensional materials, quantum-mechanically enhanced transport phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect can be observed. Graphene, consisting of an isolated single atomic layer of graphite, is an ideal realization of such a two-dimensional system. However, its behaviour is expected to differ markedly from the well-studied case of quantum wells in conventional semiconductor interfaces. This difference arises from the unique electronic properties of graphene, which exhibits electron-hole degeneracy and vanishing carrier mass near the point of charge neutrality. Indeed, a distinctive half-integer quantum Hall effect has been predicted theoretically, as has the existence of a non-zero Berry's phase (a geometric quantum phase) of the electron wavefunction--a consequence of the exceptional topology of the graphene band structure. Recent advances in micromechanical extraction and fabrication techniques for graphite structures now permit such exotic two-dimensional electron systems to be probed experimentally. Here we report an experimental investigation of magneto-transport in a high-mobility single layer of graphene. Adjusting the chemical potential with the use of the electric field effect, we observe an unusual half-integer quantum Hall effect for both electron and hole carriers in graphene. The relevance of Berry's phase to these experiments is confirmed by magneto-oscillations. In addition to their purely scientific interest, these unusual quantum transport phenomena may lead to new applications in carbon-based electronic and magneto-electronic devices."

Here we describe the preparation of such a catalyst from common, inexpensive sugars. This high-performance catalyst, which consists of stable sulphonated amorphous carbon, is recyclable and its activity markedly exceeds that of other solid acid catalysts tested for 'biodiesel' production."
https://openalex.org/W1993717649,"Physiological effects of β adrenergic receptor (β2AR) stimulation have been classically shown to result from Gs-dependent adenylyl cyclase activation. Here we demonstrate a novel signaling mechanism wherein β-arrestins mediate β2AR signaling to extracellular-signal regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK 1/2) independent of G protein activation. Activation of ERK1/2 by the β2AR expressed in HEK-293 cells was resolved into two components dependent, respectively, on Gs-Gi/protein kinase A (PKA) or β-arrestins. G protein-dependent activity was rapid, peaking within 2-5 min, was quite transient, was blocked by pertussis toxin (Gi inhibitor) and H-89 (PKA inhibitor), and was insensitive to depletion of endogenous β-arrestins by siRNA. β-Arrestin-dependent activation was slower in onset (peak 5-10 min), less robust, but more sustained and showed little decrement over 30 min. It was insensitive to pertussis toxin and H-89 and sensitive to depletion of either β-arrestin1 or -2 by small interfering RNA. In Gs knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts, wild-type β2AR recruited β-arrestin2-green fluorescent protein and activated pertussis toxin-insensitive ERK1/2. Furthermore, a novel β2AR mutant (β2ART68F,Y132G,Y219A or β2ARTYY), rationally designed based on Evolutionary Trace analysis, was incapable of G protein activation but could recruit β-arrestins, undergo β-arrestin-dependent internalization, and activate β-arrestin-dependent ERK. Interestingly, overexpression of GRK5 or -6 increased mutant receptor phosphorylation and β-arrestin recruitment, led to the formation of stable receptor-β-arrestin complexes on endosomes, and increased agonist-stimulated phospho-ERK1/2. In contrast, GRK2, membrane translocation of which requires Gβγ release upon G protein activation, was ineffective unless it was constitutively targeted to the plasma membrane by a prenylation signal (CAAX). These findings demonstrate that the β2AR can signal to ERK via a GRK5/6-β-arrestin-dependent pathway, which is independent of G protein coupling. Physiological effects of β adrenergic receptor (β2AR) stimulation have been classically shown to result from Gs-dependent adenylyl cyclase activation.

Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 2002; 415: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 2Xiao R.P. Sci. STKE. 2001; 2001: RE15PubMed Google Scholar, 3Xiang Y. Kobilka B.K. Science. 2003; 300: 1530-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Agonist stimulation of the β2AR leads to Gs-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase, resulting in the production of cAMP and subsequent downstream signaling events. Moreover, additional studies both in cultured cell lines and in vitro have demonstrated that, in response to agonist, the β2AR can undergo PKA-dependent phosphorylation leading to activation of Gi (a process referred to as G protein “switching”), thereby effectively changing the signaling specificity of the receptor (4Lefkowitz R.J. Pierce K.L. Luttrell L.M. Mol.

Cessation of agonist-activated β2AR-Gs-mediated signaling occurs via recruitment of modulatory proteins, β-arrestins, to the cytoplasmic surface of the receptor, a process that is enhanced by receptor phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) (5Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). β-arrestin binding physically prevents receptor-Gs interaction, leading to desensitization of receptor-mediated activation of Gs. β-Arrestin binding further promotes the subsequent cytosol to membrane translocation of clathrin and adaptor protein AP-2, resulting in receptor endocytosis in clathrin-coated vesicles (6Lefkowitz R.J. Whalen E.J. Curr. Opin Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 7Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar, 8Marchese A. Chen C. Kim Y.M.

Recent evidence has emerged, however, that, for a variety of receptors, β-arrestins can also function as molecular mediators of G protein-independent signaling by acting to scaffold a variety of signaling proteins. These include small-GTP-binding proteins, as well as members of the ERK-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathway, among others (5Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). For example, angiotensin II receptor type Ia (AT1aR) signaling following activation by angiotensin II is known to promote AT1aR coupling to Gαq/11 (9Thomas W.G. Qian H. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 14: 130-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, AT1aR activation by a peptide analogue of angiotensin II (termed SII), or angiotensin II activation of a mutant AT1aR (DRY → AAY) unable to couple to G proteins, results in activation of the MAPK cascade, which is Gαq-independent but β-arrestin-dependent (10Holloway A.C.

A. 2005; 102: 1442-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Further, these two independent signaling pathways show both distinct spatial (Gq nuclear, β-arrestin cytosolic vesicles) and temporal (Gq rapid/transient; β-arrestin slower and prolonged) characteristics with respect to ERK1/2 activation (14Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Wei H. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35518-35525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Recent studies using siRNA have confirmed these results and have extended this general paradigm of distinct G protein/β-arrestin signaling to the V2 vasopressin receptor (V2R) (15Ren X.R. Reiter E. Ahn S. Kim J. Chen W. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). 7TMRs can be functionally divided into two broad categories based upon their interaction with β-arrestins following agonist activation. “Class B” receptors such as both the AT1aR and V2R form a very stable interaction complex with β-arrestins. “Class A” receptors, including the β2AR, on the other hand, are known to form only transient complexes with β-arrestin (16Oakley R.H.

Whether β-arrestin-dependent ERK1/2 activation can occur via such Class A receptors is at present unknown. To investigate the potential for β-arrestin-dependent MAPK activation via a Class A receptor, we have used the β2AR to address these issues using gene silencing technology, Gαs null cells, as well as a novel Evolutionary Trace-based mutant β2AR engineered to be uncoupled from G protein signaling. Cell Lines, Biochemicals, and Plasmids—HEK-293 and COS-7 cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained in designated culture media at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Gαs null fibroblast cell line (17Bastepe M. Gunes Y. Perez-Villamil B. Hunzelman J. Weinstein L.S. Juppner H. Mol.

Isoproterenol, propranolol, M2 anti-FLAG affinity agarose beads, G418, forskolin, mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody, and anti-mouse IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate, were obtained from Sigma. Pertussis toxin was from List Biological Laboratories. H-89 was obtained from Calbiochem. DSP and chemiluminescent substrates were from Pierce. Antibodies recognizing the β2AR and phosphorylated β2AR on serines 345 or 346 or phosphoserines 355 or 356, were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit polyclonal β-arrestin antibody (A1CT) and mouse monoclonal GRK antibodies (18Oppermann M. Diverse-Pierluissi M. Drazner M.H. Dyer S.L. Freedman N.J. Peppel K.C. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl.

Detection of active ERK1/2 was with a rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Cell Signaling Technology, 1:2000 for Western blot). Total ERK1/2 was detected with anti-MAPK 1/2 (Upstate Technology Inc.). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1442-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) have been described previously. The TYY mutant (β2ARTYY) was generated using a QuikChange multi-site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All DNA constructs were verified by sequencing (Macrogen Inc., Seoul, South Korea). Generation of Cell Lines Stably Expressing Receptors—Because HEK-293 cells have endogenously expressed β2ARs, higher expression levels of mutant receptors were necessary to correlate the effects attributable to the mutations. To maintain consistency of expression levels between different experiments, we created clonal HEK-293 cell lines with almost identical receptor expression levels for β2AR and β2ARTYY. Early passage 293 cells were transfected with 1 μg of receptor plasmid, and positive clones were selected against G418 (1 mg/ml). Receptor expression levels were determined by radioligand binding (see below). When stable expression was achieved, the cells were cultured in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418. Each experiment was replicated in at least two different clonal lines for both the β2AR and β2ARTYY. cAMP Assay—Cells were plated on 12-well dishes (polylysine-d-coated, Biocoat). Serum-deprived cells were incubated for 10 min with 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) to inactivate phosphodiesterases. Cells were then treated with vehicle or a range of isoproterenol concentrations for 10 min at 37 °C in the presence of IBMX. Forskolin treatment (10 μm) for 10 min was used to measure cAMP generation due to direct activation of adenylyl cyclase. Stimulation was terminated by placing cells on ice and adding EDTA. Samples were collected by gentle scraping, boiled at 100 °C for 5 min, and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatants were used in triplicate to assay for cAMP levels according to 3H-labeled cAMP system (Amersham Biosciences) as per the manufacturer's protocol. The amount of cAMP was expressed as a percentage of that obtained with forskolin. siRNA Transfection—Chemically synthesized, double-stranded siRNAs, with 19-nucleotide duplex RNA and 2-nucleotide 3′-dTdT over-hangs were purchased from Xeragon (Germantown, MD) in deprotected and desalted form. The siRNA sequences targeting human β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 were 5′-AAAGCCUUCUGCGCGGAGAAU-3′ and 5′-AAGGACCGCAAAGUGUUUGUG-3′ corresponding to positions 439-459 and 148-168 relative to the start codon, respectively. A non-silencing RNA duplex (5′-AAUUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU-3′), as the manufacturer indicated, was used as a control. For siRNA experiments, early passage HEK-293 cells that were 40-50% confluent on 100-mm dishes were transfected with 20 μg of siRNA, using the Genesilencer transfection reagent. Forty-eight hours later cells were split into either 6- or 12-well dishes for pERK assays and 12-well (Biocoat) dishes for radioligand binding. Phospho-ERK Assay—HEK-293 cells on 6- or 12-well plates were starved for at least 4 h in serum-free medium prior to stimulation. After stimulation, cells were solubilized by directly adding 2× SDS-sample buffer, followed by sonication with a microtip for 15 s or by boiling at 100 °C for 5 min. For each transfection, an equal portion of the cells was set aside for protein determination (Bradford). Equal micrograms of cellular extracts were separated on 4-20% (for ERK1/2 detection) or 10% (for β-arrestins 1 and 2 detection) Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting. Phosphorylated ERK1/2, total ERK1/2, and β-arrestins were detected by immunoblotting with rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Cell Signaling, 1:2,000), anti-MAPK 1/2 (Upstate Technology Inc., 1:10,000), and anti-β-arrestin (A1CT, 1:3,000) antibodies, respectively. Chemiluminescence detection was performed using the SuperSignal West Pico reagent (Pierce) and phosphorylated ERK1/2 immunoblots were quantified by densitometry with a Fluor-S MultiImager (Bio-Rad). GraphPad PRISM software was used for data analyses. [125I](-)Iodocyanopindolol Binding on Monolayers of Cells—Receptor expression was measured by [125I](-)iodocyanopindolol radioligand binding on monolayers of cells on poly-d-lysine-coated 12-well dishes (Biocoat) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium buffered with 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and 5 mm MgCl2. Binding was performed in triplicate with 400 pm 125I(-)iodocyanopindolol in the presence or absence of the hydrophobic antagonist propranolol (10 μm, to define nonspecific binding). After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the cells were placed on ice and washed several times with phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing calcium and magnesium. Cells were solubilized in 0.1 n NaOH and 0.1% SDS and counted for 125I. Internalization—FLAG epitope-tagged receptors expressed in COS-7 cells in twelve-well dishes were treated with or without agonist for 30 min in serum-free medium at 37 °C. Cell-surface receptors were labeled with M2 FLAG monoclonal antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat antibody to mouse IgG as secondary antibody. Receptor internalization was quantified as the loss of cell-surface receptors, as measured by flow cytometry (Flow Cytometry Facility, Duke University). Metabolic Labeling—HEK-293 cells stably expressing the β2AR or mutant receptors were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min in phosphate-free minimal essential medium containing [32P]Pi (100 μCi/ml). After isoproterenol treatment for 5 min at 37 °C, FLAG receptors were immunoprecipitated and samples separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, and the 32P incorporation was quantified. Confocal Microscopy—HEK-293 cells stably expressing the WT, TYY, or GRK-PKA-receptors on 10-cm dishes were transiently transfected with β-arrestin2-GFP using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science). Gs KO cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-β2AR and β-arrestin2-GFP utilizing Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were plated on collagen-coated 35-mm glass bottom plates. On the following day, cells were starved for at least 2 h in serum-free medium prior to stimulation. After stimulation, cells were fixed with 5% formaldehyde diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing calcium and magnesium before confocal analyses. Images of GFP fluorescence were collected using single line excitation (488 nm). Immunoprecipitation with DSP Cross-linking—HEK-293 cells stably expressing either β2AR or β2ARTYY that are FLAG epitope-tagged were used for these experiments. Cells on 100-mm dishes were incubated in 4.0 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline plus 10 mm HEPES for 1 h at 37 °C and subsequently stimulated with 10 μm isoproterenol for 5 min. A membrane-permeable, hydrolyzable covalent cross-linker dithiobissuccinimidyl propionate (DSP, from Pierce) was added to the dishes with slow and constant agitation. After 20-min incubation at room temperature, the DSP reaction was quenched by adding Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (final concentration of 25 mm). Cells were solubilized, and receptors were immunoprecipitated with FLAG beads. Coimmunoprecipitated β-arrestins were detected by immunoblotting with a rabbit polyclonal anti-β-arrestin1/2 antibody (A1CT). Evolutionary Trace—The relative importance of transmembrane sequence residues was computed from an Evolutionary Trace (21Lichtarge O. Bourne H.R. Cohen F.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 342-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar) of 129 visual opsins, 69 bioamine, 58 olfactory, and 82 chemokine receptors. Comparison to the literature revealed among the residues ranked in the top 20th percentile, a structural cluster of seven likely to participate in G protein-coupling in all rhodopsin-like receptors: Thr-68, Tyr-132, Ala-134, Tyr-219, Leu-275, Tyr-326, and Pro-330, using human-β2AR numbering (22Madabushi S.

These were the starting point for the rational design of the TYY mutant described below. Four of these were eliminated, because mutational data either: linked them to increased G protein activation (Leu-275) (23Ganguli S.C. Park C.G. Holtmann M.H. Hadac E.M. Kenakin T.P. Miller L.J. J.

By contrast, the remaining three residues had mutations shown to decrease G protein signaling in multiple receptors and with no data suggesting a decrease in internalization. Isoproterenol-dependent, H-89/PTX-insensitive pERK Stimulated by the β2AR in HEK-293 Cells—Two different β2AR-mediated pathways of Gs-dependent ERK1/2 activation have been described in HEK-293 cells (29Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25342-25350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 30Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar, 31Friedman J. Babu B. Clark R.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1094-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Both pathways involve the activity of PKA, in one case to activate downstream effectors such as the small G protein Rap and the other to phosphorylate the β2AR itself, thereby switching its coupling to Gi proteins. To evaluate the extent of PKA dependence of ERK1/2 activation in HEK-293 cells, we examined the time course of isoproterenol-induced pERK in the presence and absence of H-89, a well defined PKA inhibitor. β2AR is endogenously expressed in HEK-293 cells (∼40 fmol/mg of cellular protein) and mediates a modest and transient activation of ERK1/2 with peak signal at 5 min after the addition of 10 μm isoproterenol (Fig. 1, A and B). The level of pERK declines to 22% (of maximal response) at 15 min and returns almost to basal levels after 30 min. Stable overexpression of a FLAG-tagged β2AR (2 pmol) augments the overall ERK1/2 activation by 4-fold at early time points and up to 8-fold beyond 10 min of agonist treatment (Fig. 1, C and D, and data not shown). However, the overall pattern of ERK1/2 activation is identical for both endogenous and exogenous receptor expression. Under both conditions, H-89 abolishes most of the early activity but, quite surprisingly, pERK at later time points is unaffected, indicating the presence of H-89-insensitive, isoproterenol-dependent signals beyond 5 min (Fig. 1, A-D). H-89 treatment precludes β2AR-Gi coupling due to the absence of Gs/Gi switching (4Lefkowitz R.J. Pierce K.L. Luttrell L.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, to independently assess the role of Gi in the activation of ERK at late time points, we also determined the effects of pertussis toxin on the time course of isoproterenol-stimulated pERK. Pertussis toxin preincubation of HEK-293 cells expressing the β2ARs had similar effects on isoproterenol-dependent ERK activation as H-89 treatment, especially at the late time points of isoproterenol stimulation. The signals beyond 5 min were resistant to pertussis toxin (Fig. 2, A-D) suggesting that the late activity occurs in the absence of Gs or Gi coupling.FIGURE 2Pertussis toxin sensitivity of pERK stimulated by the β2AR in HEK-293 cells. HEK-293 cells with endogenous β2AR (A and B) or with stable expression of wild-type β2AR at 2 pmol/mg (C and D) were incubated with vehicle or 100 ng/ml of PTX for 16 h and treated with 10 μm isoproterenol for the indicated times. Equal amounts of cell lysate were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed for pERK by Western blotting (B and D). Signals were quantified by densitometry and expressed as percentage of the maximal phosphorylated ERK obtained at 5 min for either endogenous (A) or overexpressed (B) receptors. Each data point represents the mean ± S.E. from three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effects of β-Arrestin siRNA on β2AR-stimulated pERK—We hypothesized that the ERK activity at later time points that is insensitive to H-89 and PTX is mostly independent of G protein activity and might be regulated by β-arrestins. To test the potential role of β-arrestins, we analyzed the time course of isoproterenol-induced pERK after depleting cellular levels of β-arrestin1 or -2 by transfecting siRNA specifically directed against each isoform. In the presence of a non-targeting control siRNA, isoproterenol stimulated ERK phosphorylation in cells stably expressing the β2AR is identical to that observed without any siRNA transfection (compare Figs. 1C and 3A). However, both β-arrestin1 and -2 siRNA individually reduce the 5-min signal by ∼50% and essentially eliminate signals beyond 10 min (Fig. 3, A and C). Minimal decrements were observed at 1 and 2 min suggesting that most of the early signals are due to G protein activation. In these experiments, we could achieve at least 90% reduction of the two isoforms by RNA interference. A representative Western blot of the levels of β-arrestin1 and -2 in control and siRNA-treated cells is shown in Fig. 3B. We also observed similar β-arrestin1/2-dependent ERK activation by the β2ARs upon transient expression (300-800 fmol/mg of protein) in HEK-293 cells (data not shown). Furthermore, β-arrestin siRNA transfection led to complete elimination of the H-89-insensitive pERK (Fig. 3D) suggesting that most of the late activity that is PKA-independent is in fact β-arrestin-dependent. Our attempts to determine PTX effects in siRNA-transfected cells were unsuccessful for technical reasons. Unfortunately, the siRNA-transfected cells could not withstand the prolonged starvation conditions (16 h) used for PTX pretreatment. An Evolutionary Trace-based Mutant β2AR Uncoupled from Gs—We have previously shown that a mutant Angiotensin II 1a receptor (AT1aR DRY → AAY), which is completely uncoupled from Gq proteins is nonetheless able to activate ERK1/2 in response to angiotensin stimulation, in a β-arrestin2-dependent manner (12Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S.S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). To rationally design an analogous β2AR mutant, we employed Evolutionary Trace analyses (see “Materials and Methods”) and altered three residues, Thr-68, Tyr-132, and Tyr-219 by site-directed mutagenesis. These residues are indicated in an amino acid sequence alignment of the β2AR and rhodopsin (Fig. 4A). The relative positions of the corresponding residues are shown in a structural model of rhodopsin (Fig. 4B). These were mutated together to new side chains that were charge neutral, non-conservative, and not found at cognate positions in any of the receptors traced for this study. This T68F-Y132G-Y219A mutant was predicted to drastically alter the component of G protein coupling located at the boundary between the transmembrane domain and the intracellular loops while leaving intact the cytoplasmic interaction of these loops with GRK and β-arrestin. To differentiate characteristics of the mutant β2ARTYY from those of the endogenously expressed β2AR in HEK-293 cells, experimental determinations were made only when the mutant receptor was overexpressed at >20- to 50-fold. Under such conditions, no difference was observed between untransfected cells (endogenous receptors), and β2ARTYY-transfected cells (Fig. 4C) with respect to either the levels of cAMP accumulation or the half-maximal stimulating concentrations of isoproterenol. On the other hand, when the β2AR was expressed in these cells at levels comparable to the β2ARTYY (i.e. >20-50 times in excess of endogenous receptors) cAMP response was much more robust with a greatly increased Vmax and reduced EC50 for isoproterenol as compared with the endogenous receptors. The dose-response curves shown in Fig. 4C establish that β2ARTYY does not stimulate cAMP accumulation beyond that elicited by the endogenous β2AR, confirming its lack of coupling to Gs. Previous studies have demonstrated that cAMP increase and subsequent PKA activation lead to PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the β2AR on serine residues within the c"

https://openalex.org/W1984695169,"The bands of Jupiter represent a global system of powerful winds. Broad eastward equatorial jets are flanked by smaller-scale, higher-latitude jets flowing in alternating directions. Jupiter's large thermal emission suggests that the winds are powered from within, but the zonal flow depth is limited by increasing density and electrical conductivity in the molecular hydrogen-helium atmosphere towards the centre of the planet. Two types of planetary flow models have been explored: shallow-layer models reproduce multiple high-latitude jets, but not the equatorial flow system, and deep convection models only reproduce an eastward equatorial jet with two flanking neighbours. Here we present a numerical model of three-dimensional rotating convection in a relatively thin spherical shell that generates both types of jets. The simulated flow is turbulent and quasi-two-dimensional and, as observed for the jovian jets, simulated jet widths follow Rhines' scaling theory. Our findings imply that Jupiter's latitudinal transition in jet width corresponds to a separation between the bottom-bounded flow structures in higher latitudes and the deep equatorial flows."

In the absence of RANKL, treatment of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with macrophage colony-stimulating factor and MCP-1 resulted in tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multinuclear cells that are positive for calcitonin receptor (CTR) and a number of other osteoclast markers, including nuclear factor of activated t cells, cytoplasmic, calcineurin-dependent 1 (NFATc1). Although NFATc1 was strongly induced by MCP-1 and was observed in the nucleus, MCP-1 did not permit the formation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts, although these cells had the typical TRAP+/CTR+ multinuclear phenotype of osteoclasts. Despite a similar appearance to osteoclasts, RANKL treatment was required in order for TRAP+/CTR+ multinuclear cells to develop bone resorption activity. The lack of bone resorption was correlated with a deficiency in expression of certain genes related to bone resorption, such as cathepsin K and MMP9. Furthermore, calcitonin blocked the MCP-1-induced formation of TRAP+/CTR+ multinuclear cells as well as blocking osteoclast bone resorption activity, indicating that calcitonin acts at two stages of osteoclast differentiation. Ablation of NFATc1 in mature osteoclasts did not prevent bone resorption activity, suggesting NFATc1 is involved in cell fusion events and not bone resorption.

Osteoclast differentiation can be promoted in vitro by using soluble recombinant RANKL in the presence of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). M-CSF is necessary for human osteoclast differentiation by supporting cell viability. In the absence of RANKL, M-CSF-treated cells differentiate into macrophage-like cells. Calcitonin is secreted from the thyroid gland in response to serum calcium and inhibits the bone resorbing activity of mature osteoclasts by binding the calcitonin receptor. Indeed, the presence of the calcitonin receptor is thought to be a later marker of osteoclast differentiation, and its presence is often taken as marker of a mature bone-resorbing osteoclast (8Kurihara N.

MCP-1 (monocyte chemotactic protein 1) is a member of the CC chemokine superfamily that plays a critical role in the recruitment and activation of leukocytes during acute inflammation (9Tangirala R.K. Murao K. Quehenberger O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8050-8056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition, MCP-1 is found at the site of tooth eruption, a feature consistent with a role in osteoclast biology (10Wise G.E. Frazier-Bowers S. D'Souza R.N. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 2002; 13: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The cellular effect of MCP-1 is mediated by the CC chemokine receptor 2, a G protein-coupled receptor that is induced by RANKL (11Kim M.S. Magno C.L. Day C.J. Morrison N.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar) and stimulates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathways (12Gerszten R.E. Friedrich E.B. Matsui T. Hung R.R. Li L. Force T. Rosenzweig A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26846-26851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that MCP-1 is induced by RANKL and promotes osteoclast fusion into multinuclear cells (13Kim M.S. Day C.J. Morrison N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16163-16169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have also demonstrated that cells treated with MCP-1 without RANKL can also form TRAP+ multinuclear cells that closely resemble osteoclasts but are unable to resorb bone (13Kim M.S. Day C.J. Morrison N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16163-16169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). GM-CSF overrides the osteoclast differentiation pathway, leading to dendritic cells even in the presence of RANKL. In this process, GM-CSF suppresses the RANKL-mediated induction of MCP-1. However, adding back MCP-1 results in the reversal of GM-CSF repression of osteoclast differentiation, suggesting that MCP-1 has a number of different potent effects on osteoclast differentiation (13Kim M.S. Day C.J. Morrison N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16163-16169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). NFATc1 is a transcription factor involved in T cell maturation that has been reported recently as the master switch regulator of osteoclast formation (14Takayanagi H. J. Periodontolal Res. 2005; 40: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In mouse cells, transfected constitutive NFATc1 appears sufficient for induction of bone-resorbing osteoclasts (15Takayanagi H. Kim S. Koga T. Nishina H. Isshiki M. Yoshida H. Saiura A. Isobe M.

In mouse, NFATc1 has also been shown to regulate expression of major osteoclast markers, including CTSK (17Matsumoto M. Kogawa M. Wada S. Takayanagi H. Tsujimoto M. Katayama S. Hisatake K. Nogi Y. J.

NFATc1 is activated by de-phosphorylation by calcineurin through the calmodulin/calcineurin cascade, which involves calcium signaling (19Hogan P.G. Chen L. Nardone J. Rao A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2205-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar). RANKL potently induces chemokines during osteoclast differentiation (11Kim M.S. Magno C.L. Day C.J. Morrison N.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar, 13Kim M.S. Day C.J. Morrison N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16163-16169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). We previously presented a model of the actions of chemokines in general and MCP-1 in particular on osteoclast differentiation (13Kim M.S. Day C.J. Morrison N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16163-16169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The core of this model was that chemokines attract further osteoclast precursors to the site of RANKL signaling, where fusion of multiple cells occurs, resulting in a mature osteoclast. In this manner, the primary RANKL-stimulated cell sends a chemokine signal to other monocytes that are then attracted to the primary RANKL-stimulated cell, resulting in cell fusion to create a multinuclear osteoclast. We showed that, in the absence of RANKL, chemokines MCP-1 and regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (13Kim M.S. Day C.J. Morrison N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16163-16169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and MIP1α (11Kim M.S. Magno C.L. Day C.J. Morrison N.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar) stimulated the formation of TRAP+ multinuclear cells that resemble osteoclasts. This indicates that chemokines can induce some osteoclast-like characteristics in a monocyte independent of the RANKL signal. A prediction of the model is that TRAP+ multinuclear cells derived from fused monocytes would express many genes that are considered osteoclast-related but have key deficits in gene expression that prevent bone resorption. In particular, NFATc1 is expected to be deficient in these cells, because they are unable to degrade bone. A further prediction is that the TRAP+ multinuclear cells would be able to complete differentiation into authentic bone-resorbing osteoclasts once presented with the RANKL signal. In this report, we test these hypotheses in MCP-1-induced TRAP+ multinuclear cells that resemble osteoclasts. Preparation and Culture of Human Monocytes—Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences) density gradient centrifugation, as described previously (20Day C.J. Kim M.S. Simcock W.E. Stephens S.R.J Aitken C.J. Nicholson G.C. Morrison N.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 91: 303-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). PBMCs were plated at 106 cells/cm2, and nonadherent cells were removed by washing in normal saline. Cells were cultured in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in minimal essential media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (all from Invitrogen). All media were supplemented with 25 ng/ml of M-CSF in all experiments. Human PBMC grown in the above medium containing M-CSF proliferate over 21 days and develop into macrophage-like mononuclear cells. Soluble RANKL (20 ng/ml) was added to induce osteoclast formation. TRAP+ multinuclear cells were similarly differentiated by using 25 ng/ml of MCP-1 instead of RANKL. M-CSF, MCP-1, and RANKL were purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). SB203580 and U0126 were from Calbiochem and were used at 20 and 10 μm, respectively. Human calcitonin was used at 50 ng/ml (Sigma). All data are based on a minimum of three replicate experiments performed independently on different occasions using different donor bloods (from the authors M. S. K., C. J. D., and N. A. M.). Where stated in the text, some experiments had more than three independent replicates. All cultures were performed for 21 days, unless stated otherwise. After 21 days, PBMC cultures were fixed in acetone, citrate, and formaldehyde solution and stained for TRAP using the leukocyte acid phosphatase staining kit (Sigma). TRAP+ cells that had three or more nuclei were considered multinuclear. Hoechst stain (Cellomics, Pittsburgh, PA) was used to visualize nuclei. Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin was used to stain for F-actin (Invitrogen). NFAT activation HitKit HCS reagent kit (Cellomics, Pittsburgh, PA) was used to visualize activation of NFAT transcription factor proteins. Bone Resorption Assays—Two types of culture procedure were used. In a continuous exposure bone resorption assay, cells were cultured in standard medium as above and were differentiated directly on a 16-mm2 sperm whale dentine slice in the well of a 96-well plate. This form of assay represents exposure of the dentine slice to cells for 21 days. The second form of assay involves incubation of mature osteoclasts on dentine slices for limited periods of time. Osteoclasts were prepared by culturing PBMCs in RANKL containing medium using type 1 collagen-coated culture plates (BD Biosciences). After 14 days, mature osteoclasts were then removed by using dissociation buffer (Invitrogen), suspended in medium, and then layered onto a two-stage step gradient of 40% serum with a 70% serum cushion as described by Collin-Osdoby et al. (21Collin-Osdoby P. Yu X. Zheng H. Osdoby P. Methods in Molecular Medicine. 80. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2003: 153-166Google Scholar). Cells were centrifuged at 100 × g for 3 min. The lower fraction, enriched for multinuclear cells (70-80% of cells after this procedure were multinuclear), was then plated at 1.5 × 103 cells per well of a 96-well plate containing dentine slices and was incubated for various times. Mononuclear control cells were plated on dentine at 5 × 103 cells per well in order to provide sufficient cells for RANKL-mediated cell fusion. Cells on dentine slices were stained for TRAP activity and for nuclei content and photographed under light and fluorescent microscopy. Dentine slices were then cleaned in chloroform, sputter coated with gold, and observed by scanning electron microscopy. siRNA Studies—siRNA for NFATc1 was designed using primers spanning 493 bp and containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter, 5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGG AAC ACT ATG GCT ATG CAT CC-3′ and 5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGA CTG CCA TGG CGA CGT CTG-3′. NFATc1 and green fluorescent protein (GFP) siRNA were prepared identically using dicer siRNA generation kit (Genlantis, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Osteoclasts were grown on collagen-coated plates and then removed using dissociation buffer and centrifugation through 40-70% serum to separate the multinuclear cells (21Collin-Osdoby P. Yu X. Zheng H. Osdoby P. Methods in Molecular Medicine. 80. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2003: 153-166Google Scholar), which were then plated onto dentine slices in minimal essential media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 25 ng/ml M-CSF and 20 ng/ml RANKL. siRNA (final concentration 12.5 nm) was transfected by using 3 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) per 0.5 ml of medium as described (22Selinger C.I.

Statistical Analysis—Student's t test was used to determine significance of effects. Data are presented as the mean of all independent replicates ± S.E. Characterization of MCP-1-treated Cells—The phenotype of cells treated with MCP-1 in the presence of M-CSF was compared with authentic osteoclasts differentiated with RANKL (Fig. 1). The cells treated with MCP-1 are TRAP+ and multinuclear as are osteoclasts (Fig. 1A) but do not appear as spread as osteoclasts. The MCP-1-treated cells are also negative for pit formation on dentine, whereas the authentic RANKL-treated osteoclasts form multiple deep pits on dentine slices (Fig. 1A). Confocal imagery using Hoechst stain confirmed multinuclearity of MCP-1-treated cells (Fig. 1B). In contrast to well defined F-actin rings in osteoclasts, TRAP+ multinuclear cells differentiated with MCP-1 did not show F-actin rings. Both cell types demonstrated similar nuclear localization of the crucial osteoclast transcription factor NFAT (Fig. 1B). The failure of bone resorption in the TRAP+ multinuclear cells from MCP-1 treatment was attributed previously to insufficient induction of CTSK, although levels of TRAP mRNA were essentially identical in the two cell types (13Kim M.S.

The failure to resorb bone may be because of a lack of expression of key osteoclast genes, despite the similarity in appearance of these MCP-1-treated cells to osteoclasts. To understand further the phenotype of MCP-1-induced TRAP+ multinuclear cells, the expression of genes related to osteoclast function was compared with that in authentic osteoclasts differentiated with RANKL (Fig. 1, C-F). Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) is a proteinase involved in bone resorption. MMP9 expression was similar in character to that of CTSK (13Kim M.S. Day C.J. Morrison N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16163-16169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), in that expression was lower in the non-bone-resorbing TRAP+ multinuclear cells induced with MCP-1 (Fig. 1C). Integrin αV (a subunit of the αV-β3 integrin) had a similar pattern of expression with lower levels in MCP-1-induced TRAP+ multinuclear cells (Fig. 1C). These data provide further evidence that that MCP-1-mediated TRAP+ multinuclear cells lack essential genes required for the bone resorption function of an osteoclast (Fig. 1A). Higher mRNA levels were observed for NFATc1 in MCP-1-treated cells compared with RANKL-treated cells in all of six independent experiments with an average difference of 16-fold (n = 6, p = 4.8 × 10-9). Similarly, CTR (6.3-fold, n = 5, p = 2.0 × 10-5) and calmodulin 1 (3.4-fold, p = 1.2 × 10-8) were also higher in TRAP+ multinuclear cells induced by MCP-1 compared with osteoclasts. Most surprisingly, the mRNAs for these three genes were more abundant in the MCP-1-induced multinuclear cells than in osteoclasts differentiated with RANKL. A series of transcription factors was examined (Fig. 1D), and all were more abundant in MCP-1-treated cells than in RANKL-treated cells. In particular, c-Fos and c-Jun were 26-fold (p = 4.2 × 10-4) and 2.7-fold (p = 2.5 × 10-3), respectively, more abundant in MCP-1-treated cells compared with RANKL-treated cells. These data suggest that the failure of MCP-1-treated osteoclast-like cells to resorb bone cannot be attributed to insufficient NFATc1, c-Fos, or c-Jun, transcription factors that are considered essential for osteoclast differentiation. Significantly greater levels of STAT1 (p = 3.8 × 10-6), STAT3 (p = 4.4 × 10-7), and far upstream element-binding protein (p = 1.5 × 10-5) were observed in the MCP-1-treated cells compared with RANKL treatment. Kox31 is a transcription factor of the zinc finger family that we showed was significantly repressed by RANKL during human osteoclast differentiation (20Day C.J. Kim M.S. Simcock W.E. Stephens S.R.J Aitken C.J. Nicholson G.C. Morrison N.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 91: 303-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Kox31 mRNA is significantly higher in MCP-1-treated cells compared with authentic osteoclasts (p = 0.01) but still substantially lower than the level found in macrophage-like cells treated with M-CSF alone (50 copies per ng of total RNA; data not shown). A series of cell surface proteins were investigated: c-Fms, RANK, CD44, CSF2RA, and CD14. Of these proteins, c-Fms, RANK, CD44, and CSF2RA are induced by RANKL and M-CSF treatment relative to macrophage-like cells treated with M-CSF alone (20Day C.J. Kim M.S. Simcock W.E. Stephens S.R.J Aitken C.J. Nicholson G.C. Morrison N.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 91: 303-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The cell surface marker CD14 is higher in cells treated with M-CSF alone and is repressed by RANKL and M-CSF treatment (values are 265 ± 33 versus 22.7 ± 1.5 copies per ng of total RNA, respectively, with p = 1.7 × 10-5). MCP-1 represses CD14 in a manner similar to RANKL treatment relative to M-CSF alone (Fig. 1E). Low CD14 is considered a characteristic of osteoclasts; MCP-1-treated cells have significantly lower CD14 mRNA compared with authentic RANKL-derived osteoclasts (p = 0.005). In other respects, the TRAP+ multinuclear cells from MCP-1 treatment had significantly more mRNA for c-Fms (n = 4, p = 2.3 × 10-9), RANK (n = 4, p = 2.3 × 10-6), CD44 (p = 5.5 × 10-6), and CSF2RA (p = 0.009) than in authentic osteoclasts differentiated with RANKL. Finally, genes related to redox regulation were investigated. Thioredoxin (TXN), glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPX1), and thioredoxin-binding protein-2 (TBP-2) were all significantly different in MCP-1-treated cells compared with authentic osteoclasts. Notably, we showed previously that TBP-2 is down-regulated in human osteoclast formation and that forced expression of TBP-2 prevents osteoclast formation (23Aitken C.J. Hodge J.M. Nishinaka Y. Vaughan T. Yodoi J. Day C.J. Morrison N.A. Nicholson G.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 2057-2064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TBP-2 levels in cells treated with MCP-1 and M-CSF were comparable with the levels in macrophage-like cells differentiated with M-CSF alone. In other words, TBP-2 is not down-regulated by MCP-1 as it is by RANKL. Likewise, increased TXN and GPX1 are features of osteoclasts. In TRAP+ multinuclear cells differentiated by MCP-1, these genes are not induced as in authentic osteoclasts. These redox regulators therefore failed to follow the pattern of gene expression found in osteoclasts. Multinucleation Is Dependent on MEK1/2 Signaling—We established previously that addition of exogenous MCP-1 to RANKL-treated cells enhanced osteoclast formation (13Kim M.S. Day C.J. Morrison N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16163-16169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). If MCP-1 and RANKL, either separately or together, activate the same molecular pathways leading to TRAP+ multinuclear cells, a similar pattern of response to inhibitors would be expected. On the other hand, a differential pattern of response would be expected if MCP-1 and RANKL treatment utilized different mechanisms of cell fusion. To investigate the signaling pathway of multinucleation, p38 and MEK1/2 MAPK inhibitors (SB203580 and U0126, respectively) were utilized to inhibit cell fusion. These inhibitors were tested in cultures treated with MCP-1, RANKL, and MCP-1 plus RANKL combined treatment. The following three parameters were measured to reflect the extent of cell fusion in different cultures: the total number of TRAP+ cells with three or more nuclei, the number of nuclei per cell, and the size of multinuclear cells measured on the longest axis. The MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, had a profound repressive effect on the formation of multinuclear cells in all treatment regimes (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the addition of the p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, did not have a significant effect on the number of TRAP+ multinuclear cells formed in MCP-1-treated cultures (139 ± 5 versus 126 ± 3, p = 0.21; Fig. 2A). These data suggest that MCP-1-mediated multinuclear cell formation is more sensitive to MEK1/2 blockade than p38 MAPK blockade. The situation in authentic osteoclasts differentiated with RANKL, or in cultures treated with MCP-1 plus RANKL, was similar but with subtle differences in comparison to cultures treated with MCP-1 alone. The addition of SB203580 to RANKL-treated cultures resulted in a 26% reduction in the number of TRAP+ multinuclear cells (from 217 ± 3 to 160 ± 7, p = 1.5 × 10-3; Fig. 2A), a reduction in the number of nuclei per cell (from 7.2 ± 0.7 to 3.2 ± 0.6, p = 6.3 × 10-7; Fig. 2B), and a reduction in the size of cells (from 136 ± 6 to 49 ± 5 μm, average longest axis, p = 9.2 × 10-11; Fig. 2C) when compared with control RANKL treatment. SB203580 had a similar effect on cultures treated with MCP-1 plus RANKL. Repression of multinuclear cell count, nuclear content, and size was observed as for RANKL-treated cells, although MCP-1 plus RANKL cultures started from a higher level of all parameters (Fig. 2, A and B). U0126 potently suppressed the number of TRAP+ multinuclear cells in all cultures, whether treated with either MCP-1, RANKL, or MCP-1 plus RANKL (p = 1.1 × 10-5, 1.2 × 10-6, and 8. 9× 10-5, respectively; Fig. 2A). Taken together, these data suggest that the effects of SB203580 and U0126 are consistent in the three treatment groups, with SB203580 treatment resulting in significant but quantitative effects on parameters of multinuclear cells, whereas U0126 virtually eliminated multinuclear cells in all treatment regimes. Moreover, U0126-treated cells remained mononuclear (Fig. 2, B and C), suggesting that U0126 inhibited multinucleation by blocking cell fusion. We reported previously that GM-CSF and cyclosporin A can suppress RANKL-mediated osteoclast formation, leading to mononuclear cells, and that addition of exogenous MCP-1 reverses the effect of these inhibitors, resulting in TRAP+ multinuclear cells (13Kim M.S. Day C.J. Morrison N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16163-16169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). We tested the capacity of MCP-1 to reverse the inhibition of SB203580 and U0126. Cultures treated with RANKL and SB203580 had an average of 3.2 ± 0.6 nuclei per cell and were on average 49 ± 5 μm on the longest axis. Addition of MCP-1 to cells treated with RANKL and SB203580 resulted in an increase in nuclear count (6.6 ±"

Here, we show that inhibition of GSK-3 using GSK-3 inhibitors or RNA interference (RNAi) significantly induced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in human colon cancer cell lines HT29 and Caco-2. Pretreatment with the PKCδ-selective inhibitor rottlerin or transfection with PKCδ siRNA attenuated the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 induced by the GSK-3 inhibitor SB-216763 and, furthermore, treatment with SB-216763 or transfection with GSK-3α and GSK-3β siRNA increased PKCδ activity, thus identifying a role for PKCδ in the induction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation by GSK-3 inhibition. Treatment with SB-216763 increased expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and IL-8, which are downstream targets of ERK1/2 activation; this induction was abolished by MEK/ERK inhibition, suggesting GSK-3 inhibition induced COX-2 and IL-8 through ERK1/2 activation. The transcriptional induction of COX-2 and IL-8 by GSK-3 inhibition was further demonstrated by the increased COX-2 and IL-8 promoter activity after SB-216763 treatment or transfection with GSK-3α or GSK-3β siRNA. Importantly, our findings identify GSK-3, acting through PKCδ, as a negative regulator of ERK1/2, thus revealing a novel crosstalk mechanism between these critical signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2074707854,"Cyclin B1 is the regulatory subunit of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) and is critical for the initiation of mitosis. Accumulating data indicate that the deregulation of cyclin B1 is tightly linked to neoplastic transformation. To study the phenotype and the potential preclinical relevance, we generated HeLa cell lines stably transfected with the plasmids encompassing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting cyclin B1. We demonstrate that the reduction of cyclin B1 caused inhibition of proliferation by arresting cells in G2 phase and by inducing apoptosis. Cells, entering mitosis, were impaired in chromosome condensation and alignment. Importantly, HeLa cells with reduced cyclin B1 were more susceptible to the treatment of small interfering RNA targeting Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) and to the administration of the chemotherapeutic agent taxol. Finally, HeLa cells with reduced cyclin B1 showed inhibited tumor growth in nude mice compared to that of control cells. In summary, our data indicate that cyclin B1 is an essential molecule for tumor cell survival and aggressive proliferation, suggesting that the downregulation of cyclin B1, especially in combination with other molecular targets, might become an interesting strategy for antitumor intervention."

In mice lacking the A2A receptor, granulocytes that migrated into the air pouch 4 h after LPS injection expressed higher mRNA levels of TNF-alpha, MIP-1alpha, and MIP-1beta than PMNs from wild-type mice. In mononuclear cells present in the air pouch 72 h after LPS injection, expression of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and MCP-2/CCL6 was higher in A2AR knockout mice. In addition to highlighting neutrophils as an early and pivotal target for mediating adenosine anti-inflammatory activities, these results identify TNF-alpha and the MIP chemokine family as gene products whose expression is pivotally affected by activation of A2AR in LPS-activated PMNs. Modulation by A2AR in the production of inflammatory signals by PMNs may thus influence the evolution of an inflammatory response by reducing the activation status of inflammatory cells."
https://openalex.org/W2017100846,"The p53 protein is a transcription factor that integrates various cellular stress signals. The accumulation of the mutant huntingtin protein with an expanded polyglutamine tract plays a central role in the pathology of human Huntington's disease. We found that the huntingtin gene contains multiple putative p53-responsive elements and p53 binds to these elements both in vivo and in vitro. p53 activation in cultured human cells, either by a temperature-sensitive mutant p53 protein or by gamma-irradiation (γ-irradiation), increases huntingtin mRNA and protein expression. Similarly, murine huntingtin also contains multiple putative p53-responsive elements and its expression is induced by p53 activation in cultured cells. Moreover, γ-irradiation, which activates p53, increases huntingtin gene expression in the striatum and cortex of mouse brain, the major pathological sites for Huntington's disease, in p53+/+ but not the isogenic p53−/− mice. These results demonstrate that p53 protein can regulate huntingtin expression at transcriptional level, and suggest that a p53 stress response could be a modulator of the process of Huntington's disease."

Lipoproteins, the major transport vehicles for distribution of triglyceride and cholesterol throughout the body, are divided into different classes based on their apolipoprotein and lipid contents.

The residues implicated in LDLR binding are surface-accessible in the crystal structure; however, until it is associated with lipid, apoE does not display high affinity binding to the LDLR (19Innerarity T.L.

Sample images corrected for background scattering from the cryoprotectant are included in the supplemental information. After data collection, the crystal was removed from its fiber loop. The loop was filled with cryoprotectant, and a second set of images was collected for background subtraction. The average radial intensity for each image was calculated with FIT2D v6.0 3Dr. Andy Hammerstey, personal communication. . For the low-resolution calculation, a mask for each image was constructed to eliminate pixels corresponding to the Bragg peaks. For the high-resolution calculation, all pixels below the average diffuse scattering intensity outside the arcs were eliminated to better estimate the average intensity of the arcs. To correct for absorption effects, each radial intensity curve was scaled to the radial intensity curve at 0° using a single scale factor determined by least squares fitting. Because the images from the cryoprotectant-filled loop showed little variation, the final radial intensity curve for that loop was calculated as the average of the individual radial intensity curves at each orientation. This curve was also scaled to the radial intensity curve from the crystal at 0°. The plotted intensity/pixel is the difference between the scaled radial intensity curve for each image and the final average radial intensity curve for the loop filled with cryoprotectant. Solution by Molecular Replacement—Belt-like molecular replacement search models were generated by placing pseudoatoms on vertices of a cubic grid. All points that fit within the molecular envelope were accepted into the model and entered into MOLREP (26Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) as a series of α carbons. The molecular replacement solution was independent of the grid spacing between 3.0 and 1.25 Å. In addition to grid spacing, five parameters of the molecular surface were varied: the outer radius, height and width of the belt, the angle of completeness, and the eccentricity. The angle of completeness describes the angular extent of the belt and would be 180° for a half-belt and 360° for a complete belt. The eccentricity is the ratio of the radii of an ellipse. A perfect circle has an eccentricity of 1.0. The outer radius was varied between 20 and 80 Å. The width and the height were varied between 2 and 40 Å. The angle of completeness was varied between 90 and 360°, and the eccentricity was between 0.5 and 2.0. The radius was varied in increments of 1.0 Å, whereas the angle of completeness was varied in steps of 2°, and the eccentricity was varied in steps of 0.05 within a 20% range of their peak values. Outside of this range, increments of 5.0 Å, 10°, and 0.125 were used for the radius, angle of completeness, and eccentricity. The height and the width were varied in increments of 1.0 Å. Calculation of the Predicted Diffuse Scattering—To interpret the diffuse scattering observed from the apoE·DPPC particles, model particles were constructed by placing pseudoatoms with the appropriate spacing within candidate shapes of the particle. For example, a disk-shaped particle was simulated as two parallel planes of phosphate atoms filled with carbon atoms oriented so that the carbons atoms have a mean 4.2-Å spacing in planes parallel to the planes of the phosphate atoms. Although this model is relatively crude and does not provide a complete description of the diffuse scattering expected from a disk-shaped particle, it is sufficient to determine the expected position of the diffuse scattering peaks associated with the phosphate atoms and the 4.2-Å spacing between the carbon atoms. The diffuse scattering from the phosphate atoms of the spheroidal particle was simulated by filling in phosphate atoms at a radius of 30 Å from the center of the particle. Carbon atoms were placed randomly within the sphere. Each model was translated to the center of the molecular replacement solution, and then the crystallographically related molecule was generated with the P21 screw axis. The Fourier transform of each unit cell was calculated with the SFALL program from CCP4 and a 600-Å orthonormal grid. For each calculation, the Fourier transform of 60 unit cells was averaged and then plotted with GNUPLOT 4.0. LDLR-binding Activity of ApoE4·DPPC Particles—DPPC was chosen for structural studies because it has a relatively high transition temperature (41 °C) and closely resembles physiological phospholipids. ApoE4·DPPC particles contain two molecules of apoE4 and 96 molecules of DPPC (23Newhouse Y. Peters-Libeu C. Weisgraber K.H. Acta Crystallogr. F. 2005; 61: 981-984Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The binding of these particles to the LDLR was determined in a competition assay with iodinated LDL and apoE·dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), a standard model system (19Innerarity T.L. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4186-4190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These particles are biologically active, binding with high affinity to the LDLR (Fig. 1) (23Newhouse Y. Peters-Libeu C. Weisgraber K.H. Acta Crystallogr. F. 2005; 61: 981-984Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). ApoE·DPPC, a Spheroidal Particle—The diffraction pattern from the apoE4·DPPC crystals, flash cooled in liquid nitrogen, contained two distinct types of scattering: discrete Bragg peaks and diffuse scattering composed of rings and arcs (Fig. 2A). These diffuse scattering features are similar to the scattering observed from stacks of unoriented DPPC bilayers. In various hydration states, the scattering from DPPC bilayers typically contains an intense ring between 57.8 and 63.6 Å (27McIntosh T.J. Simon S.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4058-4066Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and weaker rings between 4.0 and 4.5 Å (28Small D.M. The Physical Chemistry of Lipids. From Alkanes to Phospholipids, eds. Plenum Press, New York1986: 512-517Google Scholar). Flash-frozen DPPC bilayers prepared in the same buffer as the crystals displayed a sharp ring at 60.0 Å and two weaker rings at 4.24 and 4.08 Å (data not shown), suggesting that strong diffuse scattering from the apoE4·DPPC crystals is because of the DPPC molecules within the apoE4·DPPC particles. In previous studies, the intense 60 Å ring was identified as a product of diffraction between two planes of phosphate atoms in adjacent bilayers (27McIntosh T.J. Simon S.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4058-4066Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Similarly, the rings of diffuse scattering at 4.24 and 4.08 Å were associated with long range order in the packing of the glycerohydrocarbon tails (28Small D.M. The Physical Chemistry of Lipids. From Alkanes to Phospholipids, eds. Plenum Press, New York1986: 512-517Google Scholar). In the apoE4·DPPC crystals, a sharp ring of high intensity scattering was observed at 60.8 ± 0.3 Å, but the diffuse scattering centered on 4.2 Å was restricted to arcs rather than a complete ring (Fig. 2A). The intensity of these features was independent of the crystal orientation with respect to the x-ray beam. Only once did the intensity of the ring deviate significantly from the average intensity (Fig. 2B). This deviation is the result of secondary diffraction, because two large Bragg peaks overlap the ring in this orientation. Similarly, the intensity of the 4.2 Å arcs is nearly independent of crystal orientation. This pattern of diffuse scattering is inconsistent with the prevailing models of disk-like particles, in which the central phospholipid molecules are arranged in a bilayer (29De Pauw M. Vanloo B. Weisgraber K. Rosseneu M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10953-10960Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 30Raussens V. Fisher C.A. Goormaghtigh E. Ryan R.O. Ruysschaert J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25825-25830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Using the particle position and orientation derived from the molecular replacement solution discussed below, the predicted diffuse scattering patterns of a disk 40 Å high and 30 Å in radius with short interatomic distances parallel to the b-axis was calculated. The resulting pattern had strong bands centered on the l-axis in the 0KL plane and the h-axis in the HK0 plane at 4.2 and 4.5 Å (Fig. 3B). The presence of the two bands is due to distribution of short distances in the model disks (Fig. 3, C and D). The scattering from the outer layers of the disk is limited to the H0L plane and shows up as distinct rings whose maxima follow the rule 40/n, where n is an integer. Both the 4.2-4.5-Å bands and the 40-Å ring are maximal in their respective planes, indicating that the predicted pattern of intensity for a bilayer within the crystal (Fig. 2C) is qualitatively correct. From this analysis, it is clear that the pattern of diffuse scattering from the apoE4·DPPC crystals does not originate from lipid arranged in a bilayer. The diffuse scattering can be partially replicated by using similar calculations and a spherical model for the phosphate atoms 30 Å in radius filled with carbon atoms placed 4.2 Å apart with no preferred orientation. As expected, this calculation gives a family of spherical shells occurring at 60 Å/n, where n is an integer. Because an analysis of the diffuse scattering cannot detect minor populations of DPPC molecules that deviate from the average 60.8 Å spacing between the phospholipid head groups, one cannot conclude that the particle is perfectly spheroidal. Therefore, the possible geometry of the DPPC particles derived from the diffuse scattering pattern most likely ranges from spherical to ellipsoidal. Diffuse scattering due to the glycerohydrocarbon chains in a spheroidal model is more difficult to model. However, the results of the disk calculation suggests that the 4.2 Å arc in the diffraction pattern originates from a preferred orientation of a subset of the glycerohydrocarbon tails within the particle. Although there is insufficient information to model the packing of the phospholipid hydrocarbon chains, one explanation for a preferred orientation of a population of the glycerohydrocarbon chains is that the particle is slightly compressed into an ellipsoidal shape in a manner that leaves the majority of the phospholipid following an approximately spherical surface. Therefore, the diffuse scattering observed from the apoE4·DPPC crystals is consistent with the diffuse scattering expected from a spheroidal particle rather than a particle containing a DPPC bilayer. This result is not simply because of rotational disorder within the crystal, because that would suggest that the apoE4·DPPC particles are rotationally disordered, which is incompatible with the presence of sharp Bragg reflections. Similarly, because the crystals readily dissolve into discrete particles similar in size to those used to form the crystals (23Newhouse Y. Peters-Libeu C. Weisgraber K.H. Acta Crystallogr. F. 2005; 61: 981-984Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar), the diffuse scattering from these crystals does not result from fusion of particles. The parameters derived from the spheroidal model are consistent with the known packing parameters of DPPC. Arranging the phospholipid head groups are on the surface of a spherical shell 60.8 Å in diameter predicts an average length of 30.4 Å for the DPPC molecules, a value well within the range of estimated lengths of DPPC molecules in DPPC bilayers at low temperature. If the particle is approximated as a sphere, the specific molecular volume of the DPPC glycerohydrocarbon tails is 832-1225 Å3/molecule. For comparison, the specific molecular volume of the glycerohydrocarbon tails of DPPC is estimated to be 1063 Å3/molecule at 24 °C (28Small D.M. The Physical Chemistry of Lipids. From Alkanes to Phospholipids, eds. Plenum Press, New York1986: 512-517Google Scholar), or ∼946 Å3/molecule after allowing for thermal contraction when the crystals are cooled to 140 K. Because of the curvature of the spherical surface, the estimated surface area per DPPC head group, 78-120 Å2, is higher than the corresponding measurements of 48-71 Å2/molecule observed for DPPC bilayers at temperatures greater than 273 K. However, similar molecular volumes and an unusually large measured surface area per head group were observed in rippled phases of DPPC in which excess space between the polar head groups is filled with solvent molecules (31Nagle J.F. Tristram-Nagle S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 159-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar). Analogous packing most likely exists in apoE4·DPPC particles, with solvent filling the surface gaps between the polar heads groups and, closer to the center, the folded glycerohydrocarbon tails forming a tightly packed core. The spheroidal shape of the apoE4·DPPC particles was unexpected because negative-staining electron microscopy of dehydrated samples suggested disk-shaped particles with approximate dimensions of 60 × 80 Å (23Newhouse Y. Peters-Libeu C. Weisgraber K.H. Acta Crystallogr. F. 2005; 61: 981-984Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar), consistent with previous models. However, because the crystals are ∼60% solvent by volume, the hydration state could easily account for the difference. As shown in Ref. 23Newhouse Y. Peters-Libeu C. Weisgraber K.H. Acta Crystallogr. F. 2005; 61: 981-984Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, different concentrations of cholate and lipid to protein ratios during purification result in a family of apoE4·DPPC particles with different electrophoretic mobilities, most likely resulting from variations in shape and size. Analysis of the diffuse scattering indicates that the purification process and the lipid to protein to cholate ratios we used select for LDLR-active spheroidal particles. Whatever the fine details of the lipid arrangements, the spheroidal pattern of diffuse scattering indicates that the phospholipid does not form a bilayer as predicted by previous models of DMPC-containing particles. Instead the phospholipid is randomly oriented within the unit cell and therefore contributes minimally to the Bragg diffraction. However, our results with DPPC do not rule out the possibility that DMPC or other apoE-containing phospholipid particles exist as discoidal bilayers with apoE arranged around the periphery of the disk. Lipid-bound ApoE Forms a Helical Hairpin—The choice of these particular particles for crystallization was serendipitous, because the random orientation of the lipid implies that the Bragg peaks must result primarily from diffraction by the protein atoms. This presented a unique opportunity to solve the structure of the molecular envelope of apoE by molecular replacement. Two models of apoE bound to DMPC particles have been proposed, the “picket fence” and “belt” models (29De Pauw M. Vanloo B. Weisgraber K. Rosseneu M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10953-10960Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 30Raussens V. Fisher C.A. Goormaghtigh E. Ryan R.O. Ruysschaert J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25825-25830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In the picket fence model, apoE is folded into a series of short, 21-residue helices wrapped around the edge of a discoidal bilayer, with the helices approximately parallel to the hydrocarbon chains. In the belt model, apoE is folded into a single continuous helix that wraps around the disc, with the helix perpendicular to the exposed hydrocarbon chains of the phospholipid. At 10 Å resolution, the picket fence model predicts a curved band of protein ∼10 Å deep and wide, whereas the belt model predicts a complete ring of protein 10-Å deep and 20-Å wide. Because the self-rotation function indicated two 2-fold rotation axes in the apoE4·DPPC crystals (see supplemental information), it is unlikely that apoE forms a ring that completely encircles the particle. Therefore, models describing fractions of a ring were used in a molecular replacement search. Each search model was generated by placing pseudoatoms at a constant density within an envelope defined by five parameters: height, radius, width, angle circumscribed by the belt, and eccentricity (Fig. 4A). For each combination (>10,000), the molecular replacement solution was determined. The correlation coefficient and R-factor of each solution depended strongly on the height, width, and eccentricity of the belt. For each value of the radius and angle, the optimal parameters were 20.0 ± 1 Å for height, 9.5 ± 1 Å for width, and 1.0 ± 0.02 Å for eccentricity. A value of a 1.0 for the eccentricity indicates that the optimal model has a nearly perfect spherical cross-section. Solutions can be obtained for different values of the radius and angle with relatively high correlation coefficients. However, to obtain a solution that closely matches the self-rotation function with good packing, the value of the outer radius is restricted to a range of 42 ± 1 Å, and the angle of completeness to 310 ± 10°. The correlation coefficients for this family of solutions were 0.76-0.79, and the R-factors were 0.46-0.50 for all reflections between 50 and 10 Å. At first, it might seem counterintuitive that 10 Å data specify the dimensions of the envelope parameters with such accuracy. However, altering any one of the parameters induced changes in the Patterson search vectors in the range of 10-80 Å. The resulting molecular envelope was an incomplete toroid that resembles a horseshoe with a circular cross-section in the equatorial plane (Fig. 4A). The noncrystallographic 2-fold rotation axis generated a second horseshoe-shaped envelope that faces the first in an orientation that clearly suggested that the surface of the particle is spheroidal (Fig. 4B), consistent with the diffuse scattering analysis. In this model, the apoE molecules would project beyond the surface of the phospholipid head groups with an outer diameter between the envelopes of 84 ± 2Å, which correlates with the maximum dimension of the dehydrated particles estimated by negative-staining electron microscopy (23Newhouse Y. Peters-Libeu C. Weisgraber K.H. Acta Crystallogr. F. 2005; 61: 981-984Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The envelopes form the primary crystal contacts, but the overlaps between adjoining envelopes are restricted to 3-4 Å, which is well within the expectation at this resolution. Although 10 Å resolution is insufficient to distinguish the secondary structure inside the envelope, the optimal width (9.5 Å) and height (20 Å) match the dimensions of the electron density resulting from a side-by-side pair of helices at 10 Å resolution, such as the helices in the apoA-II crystal structure (32Kumar M.S. Carson M. Hussain M.M. Murthy H.M.K Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11681-11691Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This suggests each apoE molecule can be approximated as a pair of extended helices folded into a semicircular arc and stacked one on top of the other. However, because circular dichroism spectroscopy estimated that the helical content of apoE is 64% in DPPC particles but only 53% in the lipid-free protein, the molecular envelope likely contains a series of short helices and connecting loops (Fig. 5A). Interaction with Phospholipid Head Groups—Comparison of the distance between the phosphate atoms derived from powder diffraction and the optimal dimensions of the protein envelope derived from molecular replacement suggested that a significant fraction of the volume of the apoE molecule (≈42%) projects beyond the surface of the phospholipid head groups. Because the hydrophobic environment of the DPPC particle did not begin until 5-9 Å below the phosphate atoms, depending on the phase (31Nagle J.F. Tristram-Nagle S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 159-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar), the estimate of the inner radius of the toroid (22 Å) matches the approximate edge of the hydrocarbon core of the particle (Fig. 5B). Therefore, the majority of the surface residues of apoE face the DPPC glycerol oxygens, the polar phospholipid head groups, the solvent molecules trapped between the phospholipids, or the exterior solvent. To be favorably folded into this predominately hydrophilic e"

Mitochondrial DNA plays a role in cell death and metastatic competence. Further, heteroplasmic large-deletion mitochondrial DNA is very common in prostate cancer. To investigate the role of mitochondrial DNA in androgen dependence of prostate cancers, we tested the changes of normal and deleted mitochondrial DNA in accordance with the progression of prostate cancer. We demonstrated that the androgen-independent cell line C4-2, established by inoculation of the androgen-dependent LNCaP cell line into castrated mice, has a greatly reduced amount of normal mitochondrial DNA and an accumulation of large-deletion DNA. Strikingly, the depletion of mitochondrial DNA from androgen-dependent LNCaP resulted in a loss of androgen dependence. Reconstitution of normal mitochondrial DNA to the mitochondrial DNA-depleted clone restored androgen dependence. These results indicate that mitochondrial DNA determines androgen dependence of prostate cancer cell lines. Further, mitochondrial DNA-deficient cells formed tumors in castrated athymic mice, whereas LNCaP did not. The accumulation of large deletion and depletion of mitochondrial DNA may thus play a role in the development of androgen independence, leading to progression of prostate cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2062880716,"Epigenetic alterations like DNA methylation and the resulting inactivation of cancer-related genes often contribute to the development of various cancers. To identify the genes that are silenced by aberrant methylation in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), we subjected two RCC lines to methylated CpG island amplification/representational difference analysis. This identified 27 CpG islands. Combined bisulfite restriction analysis of these CpG islands in primary RCC cases revealed that four were methylated in a tumor-specific manner. One of these was identified as the human homeo-box gene B13 (HOXB13) gene, but the remaining three CpG islands were not associated with known genes. The methylation frequencies of HOXB13 in primary RCC samples and lines were 30 and 73%, respectively. The methylation status of HOXB13 correlated with the loss of its expression both in RCC lines and primary tumors, and methyltransferase inhibitor treatment induced the recovery of its expression. Exogenous expression of HOXB13 in RCC cells that lacked endogenous HOXB13 expression suppressed colony formation and induced apoptotic features. Furthermore, HOXB13 methylation correlated positively with tumor grade and microvessel invasion. These results suggest that HOXB13 is a novel candidate tumor suppressor gene in RCC and that its inactivation may play an important role in both RCC tumorigenesis and progression."

Kieff E. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 2397-2446Google Scholar). The incidence of NPC in southern China including Guangdong Province and Hong Kong is among the highest in the world (2Lee A.W. Foo W. Mang O. Sze W.M. Chappell R. Lau W.H. Ko W.M. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 103: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). EBV mainly infects two cell types: peripheral B cells and nasopharyngeal epithelial cells (1Rickinson A.B. Kieff E. Fields B.N.

Although it is difficult for EBV to infect nasopharyngeal epithelial cells in vitro, EBV readily infects resting human B cells in vitro and converts them to immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (1Rickinson A.B. Kieff E. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 2397-2446Google Scholar). Three forms of latency have been recognized for various EBV-associated diseases (1Rickinson A.B. Kieff E. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 2397-2446Google Scholar, 4Moss D.J. Schmidt C. Elliott S. Suhrbier A. Burrows S. Khanna R. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 69: 213-245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In latency I, as exemplified by endemic Burkitt's lymphoma, only one EBV-encoded protein, EBNA1, is expressed. In latency II as exemplified by NPC, three EBV-encoded proteins, namely EBNA1, LMP1, and LMP2, are expressed. In latency III, as exemplified by lymphoblastoid cell lines and infectious mononucleosis, a total of nine EBV-encoded proteins are expressed. Among all of the latent viral proteins expressed in the three different latencies, LMP1 is the only one known to be capable of transforming rodent fibroblasts in vitro (5Wang D. Liebowitz D. Kieff E. Cell. 1985; 43: 831-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). It is also indispensable for EBV-mediated B cell transformation (6Kaye K.M. Izumi K.M. Kieff E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9150-9154Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). In addition, transgenic mice expressing LMP1 under a lymphocyte-specific promoter display a much higher incidence of lymphoma (7Kulwichit W. Edwards R.H. Davenport E.M. Baskar J.F. Godfrey V. Raab-Traub N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11963-11968Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). LMP1 is a 386-amino acid membrane-localized viral protein with six transmembrane domains (Fig. 1A). Two subdomains in the 200-amino acid cytoplasmic carboxyl tail of LMP1, namely CTAR1 (amino acids 194-232) and CTAR2 (amino acids 351-386), are crucial for interacting with specific cellular factors and for engaging key cellular signaling pathways. Among them are the NF-κB pathway and two mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways (i.e. c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 pathways) (8Eliopoulos A.G. Young L.S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2001; 11: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 9Mosialos G. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although CTAR2 is solely responsible for the LMP1-induced JNK pathway, both CTAR1 and CTAR2 contribute to NF-κB activation, with CTAR2 accounting for 70% of the total NF-κB activity induced by LMP1 (8Eliopoulos A.G. Young L.S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2001; 11: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 9Mosialos G. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). NF-κB, a dimeric transcription factor, plays a key role in activation of certain viral genes during viral infection and in host immune response to various microbial infections (10Bonizzi G. Karin M. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2067) Google Scholar, 11Hayden M.S. Ghosh S.

NF-κB is normally sequestered in cytosol by the IκB family proteins. In response to cytokine stimulation or microbial infection, IκB is first phosphorylated by the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which consists of three core members IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ, and subsequently degraded in a ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent manner (10Bonizzi G. Karin M. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2067) Google Scholar, 11Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3345) Google Scholar). Two distinct NF-κB pathways have been recognized; one is the canonical pathway, which mainly utilizes the catalytic activity of IKKβ to phosphorylate IκBα and induces its degradation resulting in generation of free p50/p65 dimer and their translocation into the nucleus, and the other is the noncanonical (or alternative) pathway, which mainly involves IKKα leading to processing of p100 (i.e. NF-κB2) and generation of free p52/RelB dimer (10Bonizzi G. Karin M. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2067) Google Scholar, 11Hayden M.S. Ghosh S.

Both IKKα and β need to be further phosphorylated by upstream kinases to achieve maximal activities. Based on genetic and biochemical evidence, NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), a member of the MAP3K superfamily, was found to function mainly in the noncanonical pathway (14Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol.

A major breakthrough in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the LMP1-induced NF-κB activation came after the discovery that LMP1 specifically recruits tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) through a conserved TRAF-binding motif (i.e. 204PQQAT208) in CTAR1 (Fig. 1A) (15Brodeur S.R.

The TRAF family proteins consist of six members (i.e. TRAF1-6) and mainly function as adaptors in various cytokine-mediated NF-κB and MAPK pathways (18Bradley J.R. Pober J.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6482-6491Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 19Chung J.Y. Park Y.C. Ye H. Wu H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 679-688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among them, TRAF2/5 mainly function in the TNFα-mediated NF-κB pathway, whereas TRAF6 preferentially acts in the interleukin-1β receptor (IL-1R)/toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated NF-κB pathway (18Bradley J.R. Pober J.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6482-6491Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 19Chung J.Y. Park Y.C. Ye H. Wu H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 679-688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, different TRAFs are selectively recruited to distinct cytokine receptors through unique adaptor molecules. Whereas TNF receptor-associated death domain (TRADD) protein specifically recruits TRAF2/5 and receptor-interacting kinase 1 to TNF receptor, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) selectively links IL-1R-associated kinases 1 and 4 (IRAK1/4) and TRAF6 to IL-1R/TLR (18Bradley J.R.

Although several earlier reports suggested that CTAR2 utilizes TRADD and TRAF2 to activate NF-κB based on overexpression studies (25Izumi K.M. Kaye K.M. Kieff E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

TRADD, MyD88, TRAF2/5, IRAK1/4, TAB2, and MEKK1 are not essential in the LMP1-mediated NF-κB pathway. Cell Lines, DNA Constructs, and Reagents—HEK293, HEK293T, MEKK1-/-, TAB2-/-, TRAF6-/-, TRAF2/5-/-, IRAK4-/-, MyD88-/-, and the wild type MEF cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 unit/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. LMP1(D335), LMP1(G335), HA-IKKβ, HA-TRAF6, and LMP1(ΔC8) were described previously (30Wan J. Sun L. Mendoza J.W. Chui Y.L. Huang D.P. Chen Z.J. Suzuki N. Suzuki S. Yeh W.C. Akira S. Matsumoto K.

LMP1(3A) mutant (i.e. Pro204-Gln206-Thr208 → Ala204-Ala206-Ala208) was generated by PCR-based mutagenesis using LMP1(D335) as the template. LMP1(3A/ΔC8) was generated from LMP1(3A) by deleting the last 8 amino acids at the C terminus. GFP-p65 was generated by inserting human p65 gene into pEGFPC1 between XhoI and SmaI sites (a generous gift from G. Natoli). IL-1β and TNFα were purchased from R & D Systems. d(-)-Luciferin was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Puromycin, Polybrene, and tetracycline were purchased from Sigma. Plasmid and siRNA Transfection—For plasmid transfection, either Lipofectamine Plus reagents (for HEK293 cells) or Lipofectamine 2000 (for MEFs) (Invitrogen) were used following the manufacturer's instructions. For siRNA transfection, Lipofectamine 2000 was routinely used. In transfection experiments involving both siRNA and plasmids, the cells were first transfected twice with siRNA. 15 h later, the cells were then transfected with plasmids. All of the siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon Inc (Lafayette, Co). The target sequences were as follows: TAK1, 5′-(AA)GAGAUCGACUACAAGGAGA; TRADD, 5′-(AA)CUGGCUGAGCUGGAGGAUG; IRAK1, 5′-(AA)GUUGCCAUCCUCAGCCUCC; and GFP (control), 5′-(AA)GGUGGCAGUGUACAGGGCU. Cell Lysis—24-36 h after transfection, the cells were lysed in the lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaF, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm sodium vanadate, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml of aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml of leupeptin, and 0.7 μg/ml of pepstatin) for 10 min, followed by removal of insoluble debris with a bench top centrifuge at 15,000 × g for 2 min to obtain whole cell extracts (WCE). Luciferase Reporter Assays—HEK293T cells were co-transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid (3xκB-luc) containing three tandem κB sites (5′-GATCTGGGGATTCCCCA) and other plasmids as indicated. WCE were harvested 36 h after transfection. 15 μl of WCE were mixed with 150 μl of freshly made luciferase reaction buffer (100 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 66 μm d(-)-luciferin, and 2 mm ATP). Luciferase activity was determined with an LB 9507 luminometer (Berthold Technologies). Luciferase units were normalized against the total protein amount present in each sample determined by protein assay reagent from Bio-Rad. Antibodies and Western Blotting—Mouse monoclonal antibodies to HA (F-7, sc-7392; Santa Cruz), p100/p52 (05-361; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), β-tubulin (T4026; Sigma), rabbit polyclonal antibodies to IKKβ (H470, sc-7607; Santa Cruz) and IRAK1 (H-273, sc-7883; Santa Cruz), and goat polyclonal antibody to TRADD (C-20, sc-1163; Santa Cruz) were used in this study. Monoclonal anti-LMP1 and polyclonal anti-TAK1 antibodies were described previously (32Chan B.C. To K.F. Pang J.C. Chung Y.F. Lo K.W. Tong J.H. Huang D.W. Lim P.L. Chui Y.L. Int. J.

For Western blot, 20 μg of WCE were first resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immun-blot PVDF; Bio-Rad), and probed with various antibodies. The proteins were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence solution (Pierce). In Vitro Immune Complex Kinase Assays—The transfected or endogenous IKKβ was immunoprecipitated from WCE using anti-HA (F-7, sc-7392) and anti-IKKβ (H470, sc-7607) antibodies, respectively. The immunoprecipitates were extensively washed three times with the lysis buffer and once with the kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 10 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μm sodium vanadate). The kinase reaction was reconstituted in 20 μl of the kinase buffer containing 1 μg of GST-IκB (1-54), 20 μm of ATP, and 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction mixtures were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the protein bands were visualized by autoradiography. Generation of the Wild Type and IRAK4-/- MEFs Stably Expressing LMP1 by Retroviral Infection—The full-length LMP1 cDNA fragment was inserted into the NotI/BamHI sites of pBPSTR1 (34Paulus W. Baur I. Boyce F.M. Breakefield X.O. Reeves S.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 62-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LMP1-pBP-STR1 and pCLeco (a packaging vector) were then co-transfected into HEK293T cells for virus production (35Naviaux R.K. Costanzi E. Haas M. Verma I.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5701-5705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The supernatant containing retrovirus was collected 48 h after transfection, filtered through a 0.45-μm filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and stored at -80 °C freezer. The wild type and IRAK4-/- MEFs (50% confluent) were separately infected with the viruses in the presence of polybrene (8 μg/ml) and tetracycline (1.5 μg/ml) for 8 h. The medium was then aspirated and replaced with fresh medium. After culturing for another 48 h, the cells were split into several 10-cm dishes in selection medium containing puromycin (1.5 μg/ml) and tetracycline (2.0 μg/ml). After 7-10 days, the well isolated individual clones were picked and expanded. To induce LMP1 expression, stable cells were grown in 10% fetal bovine serum with puromycin but without tetracycline. Gel Mobility Shift Assays—A double-stranded oligonucleotide probe containing a consensus NF-κB site, 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC (sense) (Promega, WI), was end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. For each binding reaction, 15 μg of WCE, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences), and 20 μg of bovine serum albumin were mixed in the binding buffer (15 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol) and preincubated on ice for 30 min. The binding reaction was initiated upon addition of the probe (∼20,000 cpm) and incubated at room temperature for another 30 min. The samples were then separated on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was subsequently dried and visualized by autoradiography. An NPC-associated LMP1 Variant, LMP1(D335), Activates NF-κBas Well as the Prototypic LMP1 Does—Many different LMP1 variants have been found over the years (36Cheung S.T. Leung S.F. Lo K.W. Chiu K.W. Tam J.S. Fok T.F. Johnson P.J. Lee J.C. Huang D.P. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). One of them, LMP1(D335), was frequently found in biopsies from NPC patients in Hong Kong (36Cheung S.T. Leung S.F. Lo K.W. Chiu K.W. Tam J.S. Fok T.F. Johnson P.J. Lee J.C. Huang D.P. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the potential pathological impact of this particular LMP1 variant, we first compared it with its prototypic counterpart (i.e. LMP1(G335)) for their ability to activate NF-κB. When separately co-transfected with an NF-κB-dependent reporter gene into 293T cells, both forms of LMP1 significantly activated the reporter to similar extent in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Next, we directly compared the two forms of LMP1 for their ability to activate the IKK complex. When HEK293 cells were co-transfected with HA-IKKβ together with either form of LMP1, we showed that both forms of LMP1 significantly activated IKKβ to a similar extent (Fig. 1C), in agreement with the reporter assay above. Our data suggested that LMP1(D335) behaves similarly to its prototypic counterpart in terms of its impact on the NF-κB pathway. CTAR2 Is the Main Contributor to the LMP1-mediated NF-κB Activation—Both CTAR1 and CTAR2 have previously been implicated in NF-κB activation (37Huen D.S. Henderson S.A. Croom-Carter D. Rowe M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 549-560PubMed Google Scholar, 38Mitchell T. Sugden B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2968-2976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To reassess their individual contribution to the LMP1-mediated NF-κB activation, we generated three LMP1 mutants: one (3A) with a triple mutation in the conserved TRAF3-binding motif in CTAR1 (i.e. P204QQAT208 to AQAAA), another (ΔC8) with an 8-amino acid deletion at the C terminus of CTAR2, and the third one (3A/ΔC8) with both types of mutations combined. Previous studies have shown that the first two mutations described above abolish the functions of CTAR1 and CTAR2, respectively, whereas the last one inactivates both (15Brodeur S.R. Cheng G.

When co-transfected into HEK293T cells together with an NF-κB reporter, the wild type LMP1 potently activated the reporter activity, whereas LMP1(3A) and LMP1(ΔC8) were about 65 and 29% as active as the wild type, respectively (Fig. 2A). In contrast, LMP1(3A/ΔC8) was almost completely inactive. Using immune complex kinase assays, we also compared LMP1 with its mutant derivatives for their ability to activate the endogenous IKKβ after separately transfecting them into HEK293 cells. Similar to the results from reporter assays, the IKKβ-activating activity of these LMP1 constructs was found to be in the following order: wild type > 3A >> ΔC8, whereas the double mutant (3A/ΔC8) was completely inactive (Fig. 2B). TAK1 Is a Specific MAP3K Involved in the CTAR2-mediated NF-κB Pathway—Several MAP3Ks including MEKK1 and TAK1 have been shown to act upstream of IKK in various cytokine-mediated NF-κB pathways (see “Discussion”). To find out which MAP3K specifically acts in the LMP1-mediated NF-κB pathway, we first co-transfected LMP1 and HA-IKKβ into MEFs derived from either the wild type or MEKK1 knock-out mice (41Xia Y. Makris C. Su B. Li E. Yang J. Nemerow G.R. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5243-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, LMP1 was still able to activate IKKβ in MEKK1-/- MEFs as well as in the wild type MEFs, suggesting that MEKK1 is less likely to be involved in the LMP1-mediated NF-κB pathway. We then turned to TAK1, which was recently shown by us as a key MAP3K involved in the LMP1-mediated JNK pathway (30Wan J. Sun L. Mendoza J.W. Chui Y.L. Huang D.P. Chen Z.J. Suzuki N. Suzuki S. Yeh W.C. Akira S. Matsumoto K. Liu Z.G. Wu Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). HEK293T cells were co-transfected with LMP1 and HA-IKKβ in the presence of either a control or TAK1-specific siRNA. Whereas the control siRNA had no obvious effect, the TAK1-specific siRNA significantly knocked down the expression of the endogenous TAK1 and reduced the LMP1-mediated IKKβ activation (Fig. 3B, lane 3). To find out which CTAR domain preferentially utilizes TAK1, we also tested two CTAR mutants of LMP1, LMP1(3A) and LMP1(ΔC8) (see previous section). In agreement with results in Fig. 2, LMP1(3A), which retains a functional CTAR2, was still able to significantly activate IKK, and this activation could be largely abolished by the TAK1-specific siRNA (Fig. 3B, lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, LMP1(ΔC8), which retains a functional CTAR1, poorly activated IKK (Fig. 3B, lane 6). Importantly, the TAK1-specific siRNA had little effect on the LMP1(ΔC8)-induced IKK activation (Fig. 3B, lane 7). This result suggested that TAK1 is mainly involved in the CTAR2-mediated NF-κB pathway. To further substantiate our claim, we also tested the involvement of TAK1 in the LMP1-induced p100 processing, a process known to be mediated by CTAR1 (21Atkinson P.G. Coope H.J. Rowe M. Ley S.C. J.

The whole cell extracts from the above experiment were subjected to immunoblot to detect the levels of the endogenous p100 and its processed product p52. As shown in Fig. 3C, LMP1 clearly induced increased p52 production in the presence of the control siRNA. Importantly, the TAK1-siRNA had no obvious effect on LMP1-induced p52 production, suggesting that TAK1 is not involved in the CTAR1-mediated p100 processing. Loss of TAB2 Does Not Affect the LMP1-induced IKK Activity—TAB2 is a TAK1-binding protein and is involved in IL-1-mediated NF-κB activation (42Ishitani T. Takaesu G. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Shibuya H.

To test whether TAB2 is absolutely required in the LMP1-mediated NF-κB pathway, we compared the LMP1-induced IKK activity in both the wild type and TAB2-/- MEFs (44Sanjo H. Takeda K. Tsujimura T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Akira S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1231-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, LMP1 activated IKK in TAB2-/- MEFs as well as in the wild type MEFs. This suggested that TAB2 is not essential in the LMP1-mediated NF-κB pathway.

As a further step toward understanding molecular mechanisms underlying the Pex19p functions, we here developed an in vitro assay system for Pex19p targeting to peroxisomes. Moreover, we have provided several lines of evidence that Pex19p interacts with newly synthesized PMPs, directs them to peroxisome membranes, and returns to the cytosol. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Pex19p—Expression plasmid encoding human Pex19p fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST-Pex19p) was constructed as follows. PCR was performed using pUcD2Hyg·PEX19 (4Matsuzono Y. Kinoshita N. Tamura S. Shimozawa N. Hamasaki M. Ghaedi K. Wanders R.J.A Suzuki Y. Kondo K. Fujiki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A BamHI fragment of PCR products was subcloned into the BamHI site in the pGEX6P-1 vector. GST-Pex19p was expressed in Escherichia coli DH5a and purified from cell lysates as described (22Otera H. Setoguchi K. Hamasaki M. Kumashiro T. Shimizu N. Fujiki Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 1639-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Fusion protein-bound glutathione-Sepharose beads were mixed with 40 units of PreScission protease in cleavage buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The mixture was rotated for 3 h at 4°C. Pex19p was eluted by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. Subcellular Fractionation—A postnuclear supernatant fraction (PNS) was prepared by centrifugation of the cell homogenate in 0.25 m sucrose/5 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4/0.1% ethanol (homogenizing buffer) from 4 × 107 CHO-K1 cells as described (5Kinoshita N.

Rat liver peroxisomes and light mitochondrial fraction were isolated as described (24Miura S. Kasuya-Arai I. Mori H. Miyazawa S. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. Fujiki Y. J. Biol.

Cell-free Synthesis of Pex Proteins—Tandem double hemagglutinin A (HA2)-tagged human PEX19, termed HA2-PEX19, was amplified by PCR using pUcD2Hyg·PEX19 as a template and a respective set of primers, a forward N2F/SalI (ATCAGTCGACCGCCGCCGCTGAGGAAGGC) and a reverse C299R/XhoI-NotI (TCATTAGCGGCCGCCTCGAGTCATCACATGATCAGACACTG), in which SalI and XhoI sites (underlined) were introduced at 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. Amplified products were cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). SalI-XhoI fragments were blunted at the XhoI site with T4 polymerase and were inserted into SalI-ApaI site pUcD2Hyg·HA2-PEX10 (26Okumoto K. Abe I. Fujiki Y. J. Biol.

PEX3 was subcloned into an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression vector pEGFP-C1 vector, resulting in the construct termed PEX3-EGFP. HA2-PEX19, PEX3-EGFP, FLAG-PEX16 (8Honsho M. Hiroshige T. Fujiki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44513-44524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and FLAG-PEX26 (27Matsumoto N. Tamura S. Fujiki Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) were each cloned into pcDNA3.1. 35S-HA2-Pex19p, 35S-Pex3p-EGFP, 35S-FLAG-Pex16p, and 35S-FLAG-Pex26p were separately synthesized in vitro using respective cDNA in pcDNA3.1 vector and TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation Systems (Promega) with 1.2 mCi/ml of [35S]methionine and 35S-cysteine (Amersham Biosciences) as labels. Translation mixture was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant fraction was used for assays. In Vitro Membrane Targeting Assays—Pex19p membrane-targeting assays were performed at 26 °C for 60 min in 250 μl of the homogenizing buffer (see above) or in the import buffer: 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5/0.25 M sucrose/5 mm methionine/50 mm KCl/3 mm MgCl2/1 mm ATP/50 μg/ml creatine kinase/10 mm creatine phosphate, using PNS from CHO-K1 cells (3 × 105) or 6 μg of rat liver peroxisomes and 0.2 μl of reticulocyte-lysate translation mixture containing 35S-HA2-Pex19p. Targeting reaction was also carried out under an ATP-depleting condition, in the presence of 10 mm AMP-PNP in place of 1 mm ATP. The assay mixtures were separated into high speed supernatant and organelle fractions by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. An aliquot of the organelle fraction in the import buffer was treated with 0.1 m Na2CO3 on ice for 30 min, and soluble and integral membrane proteins were separated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min (28Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). All the fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 12% gels. 35S proteins were detected by a Fluoro Imaging Analyzer FLA-5000 (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). For Pex19 export assays, aliquots of the organelle pellet fractions obtained in the Pex19p membrane-targeting assays described above were resuspended in the homogenizing buffer, import buffer with or without 10 μg of recombinant Pex19p (rPex19p), or ATP-depleted import buffer in the presence of cytosolic fraction from CHO-K1 (3 × 105 cells). These assay mixtures were incubated at 26 °C for 30 min and separated into supernatant and membrane fractions by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Pex19p PMP-recruiting assays were done at 26 °C for 60 min in 250 μl of import buffer containing 6 μg of rat liver peroxisomes and 0.2 μlof 35S-Pex16p or 35S-Pex26p with 35S-HA2-Pex19p. The assay mixtures were separated into high speed supernatant and organelle fractions by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The organelle pellet was resuspended in the homogenization buffer or the import buffer with or without 10 μg of rPex19p. Expression of Pex19p in CHO-K1 Cells—CHO-K1 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1·HA2-PEX19 as described (4Matsuzono Y. Kinoshita N. Tamura S. Shimozawa N. Hamasaki M. Ghaedi K.

At 3 days posttransfection, cells were stained with mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (16B12; Covance Res.

Binding of Cargo-loaded Pex19p to Pex3p—35S-HA2-Pex19p and 35S-FLAG-Pex16p or 35S-FLAG-Pex26p were separately translated using a coupled transcription/translation system as described above. Respective sets were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with 35S-FLAG-Pex3p-EGFP that had been likewise synthesized. 35S-FLAG-Pex3p-EGFP was immunoprecipitated using anti-GFP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Fluoro Imaging Analyzer as described above. 35S-HA2-Pex19p-bound 35S-FLAG-Pex26p and free 35S-FLAG-Pex26p, if any, were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG immunoglobulin G (IgG)-conjugated agarose. Bound proteins were eluted by addition of a large excess of FLAG peptides. The eluate was incubated at 26 °C for 1 h with 35S-FLAG-Pex3p-EGFP.

Other Methods—Western blot analysis was performed using electrophoretically transferred samples on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) with primary antibodies and a second antibody, donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized with ECL-plus Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and a Can-Get-Signal Enhancer (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). In Vitro Translocation of Pex19p to Peroxisomes—To investigate whether Pex19p targets peroxisome membranes from the cytosol, we attempted to establish a cell-free translocation system of Pex19p. In vitro synthesized 35S-Pex19p was incubated at 26 °C for 1 h in the import assay buffer with PNS fraction from wild-type CHO-K1, pex2 mutant Z65 (31Tsukamoto T. Miura S. Fujiki Y. Nature. 1991; 350: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and pex3 ZPG208 (6Ghaedi K. Tamura S. Okumoto K. Matsuzono Y. Fujiki Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2085-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) cells and with rat liver peroxisomes. The reaction mixture was separated into organelle and cytosol fractions and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Pex14p, a peroxisomal membrane protein, was detected in organelle fraction in respective sets of the incubation mixtures, indicating the adequate separation of soluble and organelle fractions (Fig. 1A, left panels). Two types of 35S-Pex19p, authentic and farnesylated forms (4Matsuzono Y. Kinoshita N. Tamura S. Shimozawa N. Hamasaki M. Ghaedi K. Wanders R.J.A Suzuki Y. Kondo K. Fujiki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2116-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), were detected in both cytosol and organelle fractions (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 5), presumably in peroxisomes. To verify this result, we expressed HA2-Pex19p in CHO-K1 cells. HA2-Pex19p was discernible in particles superimposable on PMP70-stained peroxisomes and in the cytosol (Fig. 1B), thereby suggesting the transport of 35S-HA2-Pex19p to peroxisomes. 35S-Pex19p was likewise detected, but in lesser amounts, in membrane fraction when incubated with PNS fraction of peroxisomal membrane remnant-positive pex2 Z65, whereas it was barely associated with the membranes of pex3 ZPG208 defective in peroxisomal membrane biogenesis (lower panels, lanes 4 and 5), consistent with morphological findings. 3Y. Matsuzono, and Y. Fujiki, unpublished data. In immunoblot, Pex14p was detected in membrane fraction from both types of CHO cell mutants, consistent with our earlier report (6Ghaedi K. Tamura S.

Okumoto K. Toyama R. Shimozawa N. Tsukamoto T. Suzuki Y. Osumi T. Kondo N. Fujiki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) (data not shown). 35S-Pex19p associated with the organelles of CHO-K1 was in a significantly higher amount in the assays done in the import assay buffer containing 1 mm ATP and the ATP regeneration system as compared with that incubated in the cell-homogenizing buffer with no addition of ATP (right panel, compare lanes 3 and 5). However, the level of 35S-Pex19p in organelle fraction was ∼50% reduced in the presence of 10 mm AMP-PNP in place of ATP (right panel, compare lane 7 with 5). 35S-Pex19p was indeed transported to peroxisomes purified from rat liver, apparently with a much higher amount of 35S-Pex19p in peroxisome fraction (Fig. 1A, lanes 8 and 9), presumably because ∼50-fold peroxisomes were used as compared with the assay using CHO-K1-derived PNS, based on calculation with catalase-specific activity (23Tsukamoto T. Yokota S. Fujiki Y. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 35Fujiki Y. Fowler S. Shio H. Hubbard A.L. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). However, the farnesylated 35S-Pex19p was less detected than that in the assays using PNS fraction in which the farnesylating activity was conceivably higher. Next, 35S-Pex19p in the organelle fraction (Fig. 1C, upper panel, lane 3, equivalent to lane 5 in Fig. 1A, upper panel) was treated with 0.1 m Na2CO3 (28Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). 35S-Pex19p was partly resistant to the alkaline extraction and recovered in membrane pellet fraction (lane 5), under which membrane and soluble marker proteins of CHO-K1 cells, endogenous Pex14p and AOx, respectively, were adequately separated (lanes 3–5), indicating that membrane-associated 35S-Pex19p partly behaved like an integral membrane protein. Likewise, a part of HA2-Pex19p associated with peroxisomes in CHO-K1 cells shown in Fig. 1B was resistant to alkaline extraction (Fig. 1C, lower panel), hence confirming the finding with 35S-Pex19p in a cell-free system. To investigate whether Pex19p could be exported from peroxisomes, we resuspended Pex19p-targeted peroxisomes (Fig. 2, upper panel, lane 1) in the homogenizing buffer or the import buffer supplemented with cytosol fraction from CHO-K1 in the absence or presence of AMP-PNP or rPex19p. After a 30-min incubation at 26 °C, the reaction mixtures were separated to organelle and cytosol fractions and analyzed as in Fig. 1A. Pex14p was detected in all of the peroxisome fractions as in the input (upper panel), indicating that peroxisomes in the respective incubation mixtures were sedimented into organelle pellet fractions. 35S-Pex19p in each of the fractions was quantitated (Fig. 2, lower panel). In the homogenizing buffer, 35S-Pex19p was dissociated, up to two thirds, from the organelles into cytosolic fraction (Fig. 2, upper and lower panels, lanes 2 and 3), while about half of the 35S-Pex19p was released in the import buffer containing ATP (lanes 4 and 5). Addition of AMP-PNP instead of ATP apparently reduced the level of 35S-Pex19p in the organelle fraction (lane 7), consistent with the finding in the in vitro targeting assay (see Fig. 1, lane 7), hence implying that a retargeting step of 35S-Pex19p was affected. Together, these results suggested that cytosolic Pex19p was targeted to and associated with peroxisomes, translocated back to the cytosol fraction, and retargeted to peroxisomes. Moreover, 35S-Pex19p-associated peroxisomes were likewise incubated in the presence of rPex19p (Fig. 2, upper and lower panels, lanes 8 and 9). Significantly, a reduced amount of 35S-Pex19p was detected in the organelle fraction (compare lanes 5 and 9), with a concomitant increase of 35S-Pex19p in the cytosol fraction (lanes 4 and 8). We interpreted this result to mean that 35S-Pex19p was released from peroxisomes but was not efficiently retargeted to peroxisome membranes because of a larger excess of unlabeled Pex19p, in good agreement with the above observation (lanes 2-7). Moreover, the exogenously added rPex19p was indeed translocated and bound to peroxisome membranes (Fig. 2, upper panel, inset, lanes 8 and 9). Pex19p-dependent PMP Import to Peroxisomes and Pex19p Recycling—We investigated topogenesis of PMPs by taking as a model PMP two integral membrane peroxins, Pex16p with two transmembrane segments (7Honsho M.

Genet. 1998; 63: 1622-1630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and C-tail anchor-type Pex26p (27Matsumoto N. Tamura S. Fujiki Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In vitro synthesized 35S-Pex16p and 35S-Pex26p were separately incubated with rat liver peroxisomes in the presence or absence of 35S-Pex19p. After the reaction, peroxisome fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A). Peroxisomes used were recovered in the organelle pellet fractions as assessed with Pex14p (left panels). Both 35S-Pex16p and 35S-Pex26p were recovered in the organelle fractions, at 3- and 10-fold higher levels upon the reaction in the presence of 35S-Pex19 (right panels, compare lanes 3 and 4). Moreover, 35S-Pex16p and 35S-Pex26p in the organelle fraction were resistant to the sodium-carbonate extraction where Pex14p and AOx-B, markers for membrane and soluble proteins of peroxisomes, were detected in the membrane and soluble fractions, respectively (Fig. 3A, upper and lower left panels, lanes 5 and 6), hence indicating that 35S-Pex16p and 35S-Pex26p were integrated to peroxisome membranes. Interestingly, about half or less of 35S-Pex19p was also resistant to the alkaline extraction (lanes 5 and 6), implying its apparently membrane-integrated form. Next, 35S-Pex16p- and 35S-Pex19p-targeted peroxisomes (Fig. 3B, upper panel, lane 1) were resuspended in the import assay buffer containing CHO-K1-derived cytosol and were incubated at 26 °C for 30 min as in Fig. 2. The input peroxisomes were likewise recovered in organelle pellet fractions as verified by Pex14p immunoblot (Fig. 3B). About one half of 35S-Pex19p was released from peroxisomes, whereas 35S-Pex16p mostly remained in peroxisome membranes (Fig. 3B, upper left panel, lanes 2 and 3). Addition of a larger excess of rPex19p to the reaction mixture significantly reduced the amount of 35S-Pex19p associated with peroxisomes, with a concomitant 2-fold increase of 35S-Pex19p in the soluble fraction, under which the level of 35S-Pex16p in the organelle and soluble fractions was little affected (upper left panel, lanes 4 and 5; upper right panel). Similar results were obtained with 35S-Pex26p, where the decrease of organelle-associated 35S-Pex19p and increase of 35S-Pex19p in the soluble fraction (Fig. 3B, lower right panel, lanes 1–5; lower right panel) were distinct. Taken together, these results strongly suggested that PMPs such as the membrane peroxins of two different types are recruited by Pex19p in the cytosol, transported to peroxisomes, and integrated into peroxisome membranes. Upon or after integration of PMPs, Pex19p is likely released to the cytosol and recycled for another round of recruiting and targeting of PMPs. Pex19p Recruits PMPs to Pex3p—A potential docking receptor on peroxisomes for Pex19p was very recently suggested to be Pex3p (36Fang Y. Morrell J.C. Jones J.M. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether ternary complexes of Pex3p-Pex19p-PMP cargo are formed. 35S-HA2-Pex19p, 35S-FLAG-Pex16p, and 35S-FLAG-Pex3p-EGFP were synthesized by coupled transcription and translation. 35S-FLAG-Pex16p and 35S-HA2-Pex19p were incubated for 2 h with 35S-FLAG-Pex3p-EGFP. 35S-FLAG-Pex3p-EGFP was immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody, and the immunocomplexes were analyzed. 35S-HA2-Pex19p and 35S-FLAG-Pex16p were detected specifically in the immunocomplexes of 35S-FLAG-Pex3p-EGFP (Fig. 4A, lanes 1–4 and 6), indicating that these three peroxins formed a ternary complex. In contrast, 35S-FLAG-Pex16p was not detectable in the 35S-FLAG-Pex3p-EGFP immunoprecipitates when only these two were incubated (lane 5). Essentially the same results were obtained in the ternary complex formation assay using 35S-HA2-Pex19p, 35S-FLAG-Pex26p, and 35S-FLAG-Pex3p-EGFP (Fig. 4B). Next, 35S-FLAG-Pex26p-loaded 35S-HA2-Pex19p was prepared by in vitro cotranslation followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG IgG-agarose (Fig. 4C). 35S-HA2-Pex19p-bound 35S-FLAG-Pex26p fraction, including free 35S-FLAG-Pex26p if any, that had been eluted with FLAG peptides was incubated with 35S-FLAG-Pex3p-EGFP (lanes 1–3). Immunoprecipitation of 35S-FLAG-Pex3p-EGFP gave rise to a complex comprising 35S-FLAG-Pex3p-EGFP, 35S-HA2-Pex19p, and 35S-FLAG-Pex26p (Fig. 4C, lanes 4 and 6), thereby demonstrating that these three formed a ternary complex. Cargo-free 35S-HA2-Pex19p likewise bound to 35S-FLAG-Pex3p-EGFP (lane 5). Together with the results shown in Fig. 3, we interpreted these findings to mean that Pex19p transport PMP cargoes to peroxisomes, most likely by direct docking to Pex3p, consistent with the findings in vivo (36Fang Y.

Moreover, in this system, PMPs including two membrane-spanning Pex16p and a C-tail-anchored-type Pex26p were transported in a Pex19p-dependent manner and integrated to peroxisome membranes. Furthermore, Pex19p complexes with PMPs such as Pex16p and Pex26p bound to Pex3p in vitro, indicating that the ternary complexes were formed. The profiles of targeting to peroxisomes of Pex19p and its truncated variants were superimposable to those of their binding to Pex3p, as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation and/or yeast two-hybrid assays.4 By taking this observation into consideration, we interpreted the findings on the ternary complex formation to mean that Pex19p-PMP complexes were transported to their docking site Pex3p on peroxisomes, in good agreement with the recent suggestion that Pex3p is required for Pex19p docking to peroxisomes (36Fang Y. Morrell J.C. Jones J.M. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).3 With regard to the physiological role, Pex19p has been thought to function as a PMP chaperone (17Shibata H. Kashiwayama Y.

Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Fang et al. (36Fang Y. Morrell J.C. Jones J.M. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) recently reported that Pex3p was required for recruiting and docking of Pex19p-PMP complexes to peroxisomes. Our findings in the present work favor such models. The translocation to peroxisomes of Pex19p requires ATP and is affected by AMP-PNP. Whether any factor is involved in the hydrolysis or binding of ATP remains to be defined. Meanwhile, the AAA ATPase family peroxins, Pex1p and Pex6p, essential for the import of matrix proteins, may be candidates for such factors (27Matsumoto N. Tamura S. Fujiki Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 40Birschmann I. Rosenkranz K. Erdmann R. Kunau W.-H. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy, however, that Pex19p was targeted to peroxisomal membrane remnants in pex1 and pex6 cell mutants (data not shown). Therefore, the AAA ATPase peroxins are less likely candidates. In contrast, ATP was dispensable for the release of Pex19p from peroxisomes. Again, the mechanistic insight to this important issue needs to be addressed. Likewise to be elucidated are physiological role(s) of the apparent integration of Pex19p to peroxisome membranes, consistent with the findings that Pex19p is indeed partly associated with peroxisomes (4Matsuzono Y. Kinoshita N. Tamura S. Shimozawa N. Hamasaki M. Ghaedi K. Wanders R.J.A Suzuki Y. Kondo K. Fujiki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Such issues may be addressed by making use of the in vitro Pex19p transport system reported here in combination with other assay systems such as the in vivo analyses. We were not able to readily distinguish the farnesylated and nonfarnesylated forms of Pex19p in the activities in translocating, transporting PMPs including at least Pex16p and Pex26p examined in this report, and returning to the cytosol. Incidentally, both forms apparently behaved in an indistinguishable manner. The farnesylation may not play a major role for peroxisome-restoring activity of Pex19p. Rather, it may promote a proper conformational change of the C-terminal domain of Pex19p by which the function of Pex19p is regulated and may not be involved in the direct interaction with PMPs and peroxisome restoration activity. Together, physiological consequences for the farnesylation of Pex19p may include 1) to regulate Pex19p in binding to and releasing from cargo PMPs and 2) to control the steps of binding of Pex19p-PMPs complexes to peroxisome membranes and releasing the unloaded Pex19p from peroxisome membranes. It has been suggested that the farnesylation is important for the Pex19p binding to PMPs (39Gloeckner C.J. Mayerhofer P.U. Landgraf P. Muntau A.C. Holzinger A. Gerber J.-K. Kammerer S. Adamski J.

Such issues may also be addressed by investigating biogenesis of other PMPs, including membrane peroxins. It is conceivable that molecular dynamism of Pex19p resembles Pex5p, a shuttling receptor for proteins with the peroxisome targeting signal type 1 (22Otera H. Setoguchi K. Hamasaki M. Kumashiro T.

In this report, we showed by the in vitro membrane-targeting assay that Pex19p functions as a cytosolic recycling receptor in recruiting PMPs, at least Pex16p and Pex26p. Collectively, our present work is the first report providing in vitro evidence that Pex19p is the shuttling receptor for the membrane peroxins. Further investigation, by making use of in vivo and in vitro systems involving dissection of Pex19p and Pex3p functions, should shed light on the mechanisms underlying the peroxisome assembly. We thank N. Miyata for technical advice, M. Nishi for figure illustrations, and the other members of the Fujiki laboratory for discussion."

We have demonstrated here that the inhibition of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) functions by small interfering RNAs or chemical inhibitors blocking interferon-induced gene expression. Hsp90 was required for signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 phosphorylation, and in its absence, Janus kinase (JAK) 1/2 were degraded by the proteosome. JAK1 interacts with Hsp90 and the CDC37 co-chaperone, and both interactions are destabilized by Hsp90 inhibitors. The biological consequences were suggested by experiments showing that T cell activation by interferon-γ-primed macrophages and the antiviral response of interferons required Hsp90. We conclude that JAK1/2 are client proteins of Hsp90 and that Hsp90 and CDC37 play a critical role in types I and II interferon pathways.

STAT1 and STAT2, following phosphorylation by JAKs, form a heterodimer and associate with the interferon-responsive factor (IRF)-9 to produce the interferon-stimulated gene-factor-3 complex. This complex induces transcription of IFN-α/β target genes having an interferon-stimulated response element site in their promoter (8Platanias L.C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (2318) Google Scholar). IFN-γ, on the other hand, activates JAK1 and JAK2, which in turn phosphorylate STAT1 on Tyr-701. Phospho-STAT1 forms a homodimer and enters the nucleus to activate target IFN-γ-inducible genes (9Ramana C.V. Gil M.P. Schreiber R.D. Stark G.R. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 96-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). During this process, STAT1 is also phosphorylated on Ser-727, which is required for maximal transcriptional activity (10Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E.

Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is an abundant, highly conserved cellular chaperone that functions as a key component of a multiprotein chaperone complex, which includes CDC37 and several other proteins that regulate folding, maturation, stabilization, and renaturation of a select group of client proteins (12Neckers L. Ivy P.S. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2003; 15: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 13Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). CDC37 is important in the context of this work, because it is thought to specifically strengthen the interaction between Hsp90 and kinase clients (14Grammatikakis N. Lin J.H. Grammatikakis A.

Cell. 2004; 116: 87-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Many Hsp90 client proteins are involved in tumorigenesis, and interruption of Hsp90-managed pathways has a broad effect on cell growth and susceptibility to apoptosis (12Neckers L. Ivy P.S. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2003; 15: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 13Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar), which has made Hsp90 a prospective target in cancer treatment. Geldanamycin (GA), a benzoquinone ansamycin, specifically inhibits Hsp90 by binding to its ATP-binding pocket, and a derivative of GA, 17-AAG, designed to treat cancer, is now in clinical trials (16Isaacs J.S. Xu W. Neckers L. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 213-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Following IFN-γ signaling, Hsp90 protein levels are increased, and STAT1 has been shown to interact with HSF1 and activate the Hsp90β promoter (17Stephanou A. Isenberg D.A. Nakajima K. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1723-1728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether Hsp90 plays a role in interferon pathways and JAK/STAT signaling. Here we have demonstrated that STAT1 phosphorylation induced by IFN-γ is inhibited when the function of Hsp90 or its co-chaperone CDC37 is blocked by siRNA or by chemical inhibitors. In addition, we have demonstrated that the IFN-α pathway is dependent on Hsp90 and CDC37. Further study has established that JAK1 interacts with Hsp90 as well as CDC37, and both interactions are destabilized by the inhibition of Hsp90. Ex vivo experiments showed that Hsp90 was required for macrophage activation and T cell proliferation induced in a mixed lymphocyte reaction and for IFN-α- and -γ-mediated antiviral effects directed against the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Our results have demonstrated an important role for Hsp90 in JAK/STAT signaling and interferon-induced gene expression and potentially in immune surveillance pathways involving types I and II interferons.

JAK1-deficient HeLa-derivative cell line E2A4 was provided by Dr. Naveen Bangia and cultured in the same medium as HeLa. Fresh BALB/c kidney was collagenated, Ficoll-Paque-purified, and plated. The recovered cells were cultured in Opti-MEM supplemented with 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 4 μg/ml insulin, and 4% fetal bovine serum. For PECs, mice were pretreated with thioglycolate for 3–5 days and adherent cells (>80% macrophages) recovered. For mouse BMDC, bone marrow was harvested from mouse femurs and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 ng/ml granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and antibiotics. After culturing the cells for 5 days, spontaneously released non-adherent cells were collected for further analysis. Human IFN-α and IFN-γ were obtained from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). GA and radicicol were from Sigma. GA concentrations were selected that did not alter cell viability according to trypan blue staining. Because the sensitivities of different cell lines to GA varied greatly, GA concentrations used in this study varied from 50 nm in HeLa cells up to 5 μm in A20 cells. 100 units/ml IFN-γ and 500 units/ml IFN-α were used throughout, unless otherwise specified. Construction of Plasmids and Transient Transfections—The original JAK1 expression plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Heinz Baumann. The sequence for the FLAG tag was inserted at the 5′-end of a JAK1 expression sequence using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The correct sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. Plasmids were transfected into E2A4 cells using Effectene from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). For GA treatment, cells were first transfected for 24 h and then treated with 1 μm GA for 1h. Reporter Gene Assay—PIV-CIITA-luciferase construct was described previously (20Piskurich J.F. Linhoff M.W. Wang Y. Ting J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 431-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection, the cells were either pretreated with GA for 3 h or left untreated. IFN-γ was then added, and the cells were incubated for 24 h. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined, and Luciferase was normalized with the β-galactosidase activity of the same sample. Results were expressed as the fold induction calculated from the ratio between luciferase activities of the treated and untreated samples. Transient Transfection with siRNA—Hsp90 and CDC37 stealth siRNA were designed using the BLOCK-iT™RNAi Designer and synthesized by Invitrogen. The target sequences for the siRNAs were: Hsp90α,5′-CCCAG UUGAU GUCAU UGAUC AUCAA-3′; Hsp90β, 5′-GGCAG AGGAA GAGAA AGGUG AGAAA-3′; and CDC37, 5′-ACAGA UCAAG CACUU UGGCA UGCUU-3′. β-actin siRNA and scrambled siRNA were from Ambion (Austin, TX). All siRNAs were transfected into HeLa cells using Lipofectamine 2000. Flow Cytometry, RT-PCR, and Real-time PCR—Flow cytometric analysis of cell surface markers was previously described (50Magner W.J. Kazim A.L. Stewart C. Romano M.A. Catalano G. Grande C. Keiser N. Santaniello F. Tomasi T.B. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 7017-7024Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). RT-PCR and real-time PCR analysis were performed according to a previous report (50Magner W.J. Kazim A.L. Stewart C. Romano M.A. Catalano G. Grande C. Keiser N. Santaniello F. Tomasi T.B. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 7017-7024Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Primers and probes for other RT-PCR and real-time PCR are shown in the supplementary methods. For real-time PCR data analysis, the ΔΔCt method was employed as described previously (50Magner W.J. Kazim A.L. Stewart C. Romano M.A. Catalano G. Grande C. Keiser N. Santaniello F. Tomasi T.B. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 7017-7024Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were scraped from the plates and lysed on ice for 30 min in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 20 mm sodium molybdate) supplemented with protease mixture (from Sigma), 1 mm NaF, and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate. For immunoprecipitation, 500 μg of cell extract was incubated with relevant antibody at 4 °C on an end-to-end rotator. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and protein G beads (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) were added. The mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 3 h, and the immunocomplexes were washed with lysis buffer three times. SDS sample buffer was added to the beads, and the beads were incubated at 95 °C for 5 min and the supernatant subjected to Western blot analysis. The Hsp90 antibody was provided by Dr. David Toft. Other antibodies used in this study were anti-pS727-STAT1 (United States Biological, Swampscott, MA), anti-pY701-STAT1 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), anti-STAT1, anti-STAT2, anti-CDC37, anti-JAK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-pY689-STAT2 (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-JAK2 (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA), goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase and goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Promega, Madison WI), and mouse IgG True-Blot (eBioscience, San Diego, CA). T Cell Alloactivation—Adherent cells isolated from BALB/c PECs were treated with 200 or 500 nm GA for 3 h and then IFN-γ was added for 24 h. After treatment, adherent PECs were washed and treated with 30 gray of γ-irradiation to inhibit proliferation. Nylon wool-purified T cells (4 × 105 cells/well) from C57BL/6 mouse spleens were mixed with the PECs (1 × 105 cells/well) and incubated for 72 h at 37 °C, and 3H-thymidine incorporation was measured by liquid scintillation. Cytopathic Effect Assay—HeLa cells were plated into 96-well plates with 1 × 05 cells/well and either treated with 100 nm GA or left untreated for 12 h. The cells were then either treated with 250 units/ml IFN-α, 500 units/ml IFN-γ, or left untreated for another 12 h, infected with different amounts of VSV Indiana strain (ATCC) for 24 h, and stained with crystal violet. Hsp90 Is Required for IFN-γ-induced MHC Classes I, II, and CD40 Expression—During an investigation of the antitumor effects of Hsp90 inhibitor GA in vitro, we noted that the drug affected the expression of several genes critical to immunity. GA in non-apoptotic concentrations (supplemental Table I) essentially eliminated IFN-γ-induced MHC classes I and II mRNA and cell surface protein expression on the human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa (Fig. 1, A–C). However, the constitutive expression of MHC class I in HeLa was not altered by GA (Fig. 1, A and C). The GA derivative 17-AAG used in clinical trials gave a quantitatively similar inhibitory effect as GA on HeLa cells. Two other IFN-γ-inducible cells, SK-N-SH (human) and Colon26 (murine), showed results similar to HeLa (data not shown). The inhibitory effects of GA were also found in normal cells, and GA substantially suppressed MHC class II expression induced by IFN-γ in mouse primary kidney cells (supplemental Fig. S1A) and mouse peritoneal exudate cells (PECs) (Fig. 1, D and E). CD40, an important co-stimulatory factor was induced by IFN-γ in mouse PECs, and the induction was suppressed by GA (Fig. 1F). However the constitutive expression of MHC class II in both B cells (A20) and mouse bone marrow dendritic cells (mBMDC) was not altered by GA treatment (Fig. 1, G and H). The use of non-apoptotic concentrations, the preservation of MHC classes I and II constitutive expression, and the stable levels of the housekeeping gene GAPDH demonstrate that the effects of GA are not due to a general inhibition of gene expression. In addition, both IFN-γ and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A were shown to up-regulate MHC class II expression in the mouse pre-B cell line NFS-5, and GA specifically inhibited IFN-γ-induced MHC class II expression but had no effect on trichostatin A-induced MHC class II expression (supplemental Fig. S1B). This again illustrates the specificity of the inhibitory effects of GA on the IFN-γ pathway. The effect of GA on IFN-γ-induced MHC class II is likely because of its well established and highly specific inhibitory effect on Hsp90 chaperone activity. In support of this, radicicol, another Hsp90 inhibitor structurally unrelated to GA, also suppressed IFN-γ-induced class II expression (supplemental Fig. S1C). The class II transactivator (CIITA) is the “master regulator” of MHC class II, and three cell-type-specific forms (PI, PIII, PIV) have been identified (18Muhlethaler-Motter A. Otten L.A. Steimle V. Mach B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2851-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Promoter regulation of the B cell CIITA (PIII-CIITA) is quite different from the classical IFN-γ-inducible type (PIV-CIITA), in that the PIII proximal promoter does not contain STAT1 or IRF-1 binding motifs (19Muhlethaler-Mottet A. Di Berardino W. Otten L.A. Mach B. Immunity. 1998; 8: 157-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 20Piskurich J.F. Linhoff M.W. Wang Y. Ting J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 431-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In HeLa cells, IFN-γ-induced PIII- and PIV-CIITA were both inhibited by GA (Fig. 2A). The IFN-γ-induced PIII-CIITA in HeLa cells is most likely regulated by the upstream IFN-γ regulatory site previously described (21Piskurich J.F. Wang Y. Linhoff M.W. White L.C. Ting J.P. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 233-240PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with its lack of effect on constitutive MHC class II expression in B cells, GA did not significantly alter the high levels of constitutive PIII-CIITA in mouse A20 cells (Fig. 2B). In macrophage lineage cells, PI-CIITA was stimulated by IFN-γ. PI-CIITA induction by IFN-γ in a mouse macrophage cell line IC-21 and in PECs were both inhibited by GA (data not shown and Fig. 2C), indicating that PI-CIITA induction by IFN-γ also requires Hsp90. It is not clear how PI-CIITA expression is controlled by the IFN-γ pathway, because an IFN-γ activation site/IRF-1 site has not been identified in the PI-CIITA proximal promoter (18Muhlethaler-Motter A. Otten L.A. Steimle V. Mach B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2851-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The constitutive level of PI-CIITA in mBMDC was not suppressed by GA (Fig. 2D). Thus, IFN-γ induction of all three CIITA promoters requires functional Hsp90, whereas the constitutive PIII-CIITA in B cells and constitutive PI-CIITA in dendritic cells are independent of Hsp90. GA Affects IFN-γ-induced Gene Expression by Inhibiting STAT1 Phosphorylation—We next explored whether the effects of GA were specific for certain immune genes or more general to the IFN-γ-signaling pathway. Initial microarray studies using HeLa cells and human genome gene set U133 plus 2.0 suggested a general inhibition by GA of multiple IFN-γ-induced genes, including those known to regulate MHC expression, whereas GA showed little effect on the basal expression of most of these genes (data not shown). Results on selected classical IFN-γ-induced genes (GBP1, IRF-1, STAT1α, and TAP1) were confirmed by RT-PCR (Fig. 3A). The Hsp90 inhibitor radicicol also suppressed multiple IFN-γ-induced genes (data not shown). Because many IFN-γ-induced genes are activated through JAK/STAT signaling, we studied the effect of Hsp90 inhibitors on this pathway. GA pretreatment caused a dose-dependent decrease of IFN-γ-induced STAT1 phosphorylation on Tyr-701 and Ser-727 (Fig. 3B). Tyr-701 phosphorylation precedes STAT1 dimerization, and Ser-727 phosphorylation is required for maximum transcriptional activation (9Ramana C.V. Gil M.P. Schreiber R.D. Stark G.R. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 96-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 10Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar, 11Varinou L. Ramsauer K. Karaghiosoff M. Kolbe T. Pfeffer K. Muller M. Decker T. Immunity. 2003; 19: 793-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Consistent with these effects, IFN-γ-induced expression of a luciferase gene driven by the PIV-CIITA promoter, a known STAT1- and IRF-1-dependent promoter was blocked by GA in a transient transfection experiment (supplemental Fig. S1D). Hsp90 Maintains JAK1/2 and Prevents Their Proteosome-mediated Degradation—Hsp90 has been reported to interact with STAT3, and the interaction is required for STAT3 phosphorylation (22Shah M. Patel K. Fried V.A. Sehgal P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45662-45669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It seemed reasonable therefore to hypothesize that STAT1 might be a client of Hsp90 based on the structural similarity between STAT1 and STAT3. However, GA treatment did not show an effect on constitutive STAT1 levels (Fig. 3B), whereas most Hsp90 clients were degraded by GA treatment. In addition, GA did not alter STAT1 dephosphorylation when added after IFN-γ was withdrawn (supplemental Fig. S2A). This observation makes it unlikely that Hsp90 stabilizes a phospho-STAT1 structure or protects STAT1 from dephosphorylation. GA also showed no effect on IFN-γ-induced STAT1 phosphorylation when it was added immediately before IFN-γ, even at high concentrations (10 μm) (supplemental Fig. S2B), suggesting that Hsp90 is probably not required to maintain STAT1 in a structure that is accessible to JAK1-mediated phosphorylation. Furthermore, IFN-γ induction of STAT1 gene expression, which is independent of STAT1 phosphorylation (23Klampfer L. Huang J. Swaby L.A. Augenlicht L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30358-30368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), was also blocked by GA (Fig. 3A). These observations suggest that an event upstream of STAT1 phosphorylation is responsible for Hsp90 inhibition. Because JAK1 and JAK2 are the protein kinases responsible for Tyr-701-STAT1 phosphorylation, the effect of GA on JAK1 and JAK2 was investigated. Decreased levels of JAK1 became apparent in HeLa cells after a 2.5-h treatment with 1 μm GA, and thereafter, the level progressively decreased (Fig. 3C). Prolonged treatment (8 h) essentially eliminated JAK1 protein expression. JAK2 followed a similar course as JAK1, and decreased levels became apparent after a 4-h GA treatment and decreased steadily with treatment. Although there were some variations in the kinetics of JAK1 and JAK2 degradation, 1 μm GA for 8 h or 100 nm GA for 16 h showed a substantial effect on both JAK1 and JAK2 protein levels in multiple experiments. The degradation of JAK1 and JAK2 proteins were mediated by the proteosome, because co-treatment with lactacystin, a specific proteosome inhibitor, restored JAK1 and JAK2 levels in the GA-treated cells (Fig. 3D). MG-132, another proteosome inhibitor, showed similar a effect as lactacystin (data not shown). The role of the proteosome has been shown for other Hsp90 clients (16Isaacs J.S. Xu W. Neckers L. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 213-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), but JAK1 and 2 have not, to our knowledge, been reported to be clients of Hsp90. Because type I interferon signaling also requires JAK1, it would be expected that GA would block this pathway. Consistent with this are experiments showing that GA substantially suppressed IFN-α-stimulated STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation as well as IFN-α-induced gene expression (ISG54 and 2′5′OAS) (Fig. 3, E and F). CDC37 and Hsp90 Are Required for Types I and II Interferon-signaling Pathways—Although GA is considered a highly specific inhibitor of Hsp90, it could conceivably have other nonspecific effects. Therefore we used siRNA to determine the role of Hsp90 and co-chaperone proteins in maintaining interferon pathways. Hsp90 is a difficult target for siRNA knockdown, because the protein is present in high concentrations in cells and occurs in two biologically active isoforms. We prepared stealth siRNA to both the Hsp90 α and β isoforms and demonstrated that, when combined, they substantially, but not completely, reduced Hsp90 levels in HeLa (Fig. 4A). However, this treatment did not block STAT1 phosphorylation, presumably because of residual functional Hsp90. Nevertheless, siRNA to Hsp90 α and β synergized with low concentrations of GA to significantly inhibit STAT1 phosphorylation and the IFN-γ activation of CIITA (Fig. 4, B and C). CDC37, unlike Hsp90, does not have multiple isoforms and is present in low concentration, potentially making it a preferable target for siRNA knockdown. SiRNA to CDC37 was designed and its efficiency verified by Western analysis (Fig. 5A). CDC37 siRNA alone inhibited IFN-γ-induced STAT1 phosphorylation and synergized with suboptimal concentrations of GA (Fig. 5B). The effect of CDC37 siRNA on the IFN-γ pathway was also manifest by inhibition of the IFN-γ target gene (CIITA) and by blocking of a reporter construct driven by the PIV-CIITA promoter (Fig. 5, C and D). Consistent with the ability to inhibit STAT1 phosphorylation, CDC37 siRNA also repressed IFN-α-induced gene expression (Fig. 5E). These experiments suggest that both Hsp90 and CDC37 play an important role in interferon-mediated gene expression pathways. Hsp90 and CDC37 Bind JAK1 in a Complex That Is Destabilized by GA—To further explore the interactions of Hsp90 and CDC37 with JAK1, we determined whether JAK1 binds to Hsp90 by co-immunoprecipitation. FLAG-tagged JAK1 was constructed and shown to be competent in restoring STAT1 phosphorylation in transient transfection of E2A4, a JAK1-deficient derivative of HeLa (supplemental Fig. S2C). The FLAG antibody was able to co-precipitate Hsp90 in FLAG-JAK1-transfected E2A4 cells but not in FLAG control vector-transfected E2A4 cells (Fig. 6A). CDC37 was also found to interact with JAK1 by co-immunoprecipitation. The interaction of JAK1 with both Hsp90 and CDC37 was decreased following a 1-h treatment with 1 μm GA (Fig. 6A), consistent with previous reports that inhibitors of Hsp90 block the interaction between Hsp90 and its client proteins (14Grammatikakis N.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). Hsp70 has also been reported to be a component of the Hsp90 chaperone complex (13Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar), and it also co-precipitated with FLAG-JAK1 (Fig. 6A). GA treatment for 1 h did not alter the level of Hsp70 in HeLa cells (data not shown). However, the interaction between JAK1 and Hsp70 was enhanced by GA treatment (Fig. 6A), suggesting that Hsp90 client proteins are shifted to an Hsp70 complex when Hsp90 function is inhibited (26Xu W. Mimnaugh E. Rosser M.F. Nicchitta C. Marcu M. Yarden Y. Neckers L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3702-3708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The co-immunoprecipitation between JAK1 and Hsp90, as well as that between JAK1 and CDC37, was also shown to be blocked by GA when Hsp90 and CDC37 antibodies were used for the initial precipitation (Fig. 6, B and C). Furthermore, endogenous JAK1 was shown to co-immunoprecipitate with Hsp90, because Hsp90 was detected in the immune complex when JAK1 antibody was used to precipitate HeLa cell extract, whereas IRF-1 antibody did not precipitate Hsp90 (Fig. 6D). These data suggest that Hsp90 and CDC37 are components of a complex that interacts with and stabilizes JAK1. GA Suppresses IFN-γ-stimulated T Cell Alloactivation—Because IFN-γ activates macrophage cells and enhances their capacity to induce T cell proliferation, we evaluated the effects of Hsp90 inhibition on T cell activation in an ex vivo alloassay. Adherent cells from PECs of BALB/c (H-2d) mice were treated with IFN-γ alone or together with different concentrations of GA. The cells were then γ-irradiated and incubated with isolated T cells from spleens of allogeneic C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice. Untreated allogeneic PEC cells elicited a low level of T cell proliferation, which was greatly enhanced by prior treatment of PECs with IFN-γ (Fig. 7A). GA suppressed macrophage activation by IFN-γ in a dose-dependent manner when assayed by T cell proliferation, consistent with its inhibitory effect on the IFN-γ pathway (Fig. 7A). Inhibition of Hsp90 Compromises the Antiviral Effects of IFN-α and IFN-γ—Biological and clinical studies have shown the antiviral effects of both types of interferons (2Schroder K. Hertzog P.J. Ravasi T. Hume D.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 75: 163-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (2910) Google Scholar, 4Malmgaard L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2004; 24: 439-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). To determine whether the inhibition of interferon pathways by GA would affect their antiviral activity, we pretreated HeLa cells with either IFN-α alone or IFN-α with GA. The cells were then infected with different amounts of VSV. The cytopathic effect assays demonstrated that IFN-α induced >50-fold protection against VSV in HeLa cells and that the protection was markedly impaired by GA (Fig. 7B). Similarly, IFN-γ showed a weaker but def"

The highest number of glutamate residues is found in a 110-amino acid-long segment toward the C terminus containing 61% glutamate residues, present in GARP1 and GARP′ but not in GARP2. Nonetheless, GARP2 contains approximately twice the number of glutamate residues than typical globular proteins (see supplemental table). GARPs probably serve a function specific to rods, because the GARP′ part is lacking in splice variants of the rod B1 subunit expressed in olfactory sensory neurons (9Sautter A. Zong X. Hofmann F.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the B3 subunit of the cGMP-gated channel of cone photoreceptors, which is encoded by a different gene, has no GARP-related sequences (12Gerstner A. Zong X. Hofmann F. Biel M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1324-1332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and soluble GARPs are absent in cones.GARPs have been proposed to organize an oligomeric protein complex near the cGMP-gated channel (3Körschen H.G. Beyermann M. Müller F. Heck M. Vantler M. Koch K.-W. Kellner R. Wolfrum U. Bode C. Hofmann K.P. Kaupp U.B. Nature. 1999; 400: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and to interact with peripherin (13Poetsch A. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48009-48016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), a protein located at the disc rim (14Molday R.S. Hicks D. Molday L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1987; 28: 50-61PubMed Google Scholar). The tethering of the GARP′ part to peripherin is expected to produce a circular arrangement of cGMP-gated channels in juxtaposition to the disc rim (13Poetsch A. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48009-48016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 15Kaupp U.B. Seifert R. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 769-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar, 16Kaupp U.B. Tränkner D. Frings S. Bradley J. Transduction Channels in Sensory Cells. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim2004: 209-235Google Scholar). The distance between the plasma membrane and the disc rim is ∼10 nm (17Roof D.J. Heuser J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 487-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, if the GARP′ part adopts a globular shape with a calculated diameter of 6.6 nm, this would be too small to reach for peripherin across the 10-nm gap. Either the GARP′ part adopts an elongated structure or additional proteins, including soluble GARPs, may help to fill that gap.Here we have studied the structure and hydrodynamic properties of GARP1 and GARP2 by various biophysical techniques. We identify GARPs as members of a class of proteins that, in their native state, are intrinsically unfolded. The unstructured GARP′ part of B1 probably serves as an elongated tether that secures the cGMP-gated channel to the disc rim and thus provides for a unique geometric arrangement of the channel.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCalculation of Mean Net Charge (R) and Mean Hydrophobicity (H)—The mean net charge (R) of a protein is determined as the absolute value of the difference between the number of positively and negatively charged residues divided by the total number of amino acid residues. The R values of GARP1 and 2 were calculated using the program ProtParam at the EXPASY server (/www.expasy.org/tools). The mean hydrophobicity (H) is the sum of normalized hydrophobicities of individual residues divided by the total number of amino acid residues minus 4 residues (to take into account the fringe effects in the calculation of hydrophobicity). Individual hydrophobicities were determined using the Protscale program at the EXPASY server, selecting the option “Hphob/Kyte and Doolittle,” a window size of 5, and a normalized scale from 0 to 1. HBoundary (Hb) was computed as described by Uversky (18Uversky V.N. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 739-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar): Hb = (R + 1.15)/2.785.Secondary Structure Predictions—Secondary structure predictions of repeat peptides (R1–R4) and proteins (GARP1 and GARP2) were carried out using JPRED, PredictProtein, nnPredict, APSSP, and AGADIR available on the EXPASY server.PONDR Prediction of GARP Proteins—Protein sequences were submitted to the PONDR server (www.pondr.com) using the neural network predictor VL-XT (19Li X. Romero P. Rani M. Dunker A.K. Obradovic Z. Genome Inform. Ser. Workshop Genome Inform. 1999; 10: 30-40PubMed Google Scholar, 20Romero P. Obradovic Z. Li X. Garner E.C. Brown C.J. Dunker A.K. Proteins. 2001; 42: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). Access to PONDR® was provided by Molecular Kinetics (Indianapolis, IN).Purification of GARP1 and GARP2—Rod outer segments (ROS) were prepared from dark-adapted retina as described elsewhere (21Schnetkamp P.P.M. Daemen F.J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Unless specified, all steps were performed at 4 °C under dim red light. All buffers, except for gel filtration, contained the protease inhibitor mixtures mPIC (Sigma) and Complete (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturers' instructions. The rhodopsin content of ROS was determined spectrophotometrically from the absorption at 500 nm using an extinction coefficient of ϵ = 40,600 cm–1 m–1. ROS were suspended in isotonic buffer (20 mm bis-Tris/propane (BTP)), pH 7.4, 120 mm KCl, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, to a rhodopsin concentration of 4 mg/ml. The suspension was homogenized and diluted in isotonic buffer to a final rhodopsin content of 1 mg/ml. Additional MgCl2 was added to a final concentration of 2 mm. Membranes were recovered by centrifugation for 20 min at 100,000 × g and washed two more times. Under these conditions, GARPs, transducin, and PDE remained in the membrane fraction, whereas most of the other soluble proteins were removed. The membrane pellets were resuspended (1 mg/ml rhodopsin) in hypotonic buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT) and illuminated for 5 min. The soluble fraction (containing GARP1, GARP2, and PDE) was separated from the membranes by centrifugation for 20 min at 314,000 × g. The pellet was washed twice and stored at 4 °C.The pooled supernatants of the hypotonic washings were loaded onto a 5-ml TSK heparin column (TosoHaas, Frankfurt, Germany) equilibrated with hypotonic buffer. The column was washed at 1 ml/min with hypotonic buffer until the absorbance reached the base line. GARP1 and -2 bound weakly to the column and eluted when the buffer was changed to TSK-buffer A (25 mm BTP, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT). After washing with TSK-buffer A, PDE and other proteins were eluted in a gradient of 0–60% TSK-buffer B (TSK-buffer A containing 1 m NaCl). The proteins were collected in 1.5-ml fractions (GARP) or in 3-ml fractions (PDE) and checked by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining and Western blotting. GARP1 and -2 eluted from the heparin column were finally separated on a Superdex-200 HiLoad 16/60 column (Amersham Biosciences) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min (20 mm BTP, pH 7.4, 130 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT). GARP1- and GARP2-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated to ∼2 mg/ml using Centriplus 30 or Centriplus 10 spin columns (Millipore), respectively. The purity of the samples was analyzed by Coomassie staining. The protein standards used for the calibration of the Superdex columns were as follows: thyroglobulin 669 kDa, ferritin 440 kDa, catalase 232 kDa, aldolase 158 kDa, ovalbumin 44 kDa, and chymotrypsinogen 25 kDa. Blue dextran (2000 kDa) was used to determine the void volume of the column.Coomassie Staining of SDS-PAGE—SDS-polyacrylamide gels were stained overnight by a solution containing 30% (v/v) ethanol, 10% (v/v) acetic acid, and 1% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Destaining was performed by using the same solution without the dye. Under these conditions at least 50 ng of most proteins are visible.Construction and Purification of Recombinant GARP2 Expressed in Escherichia coli—Recombinant GARP2 (rGARP2) was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysE (Novagen) as His-tagged fusion protein using the pET30a vector. Cells were resuspended and sonicated (3 × 10 s) in 10 mm Na+ phosphate, pH 7.0. After addition of DNase (1,000 units/liter culture) and 2 mm MgCl2, the suspension was incubated on ice for 15 min and then centrifuged at 60,000 × g. The supernatant, containing recombinant GARP2, was adjusted to binding buffer (20 mm Na+ phosphate, pH 7.0, 35 mm imidazole, 2% glycerol, and 500 mm NaCl) and loaded onto a CoCl2-activated nitrilotriacetic acid-HiTrap column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 10 volumes of binding buffer and then with 10 volumes of binding buffer containing 100 mm imidazole. Recombinant GARP2 was eluted with binding buffer containing 500 mm imidazole and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences).Mass Spectrometry—MALDI-TOF mass spectra of purified native GARP2 samples were obtained by using a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Voyager System 4197, PerSeptive Biosystems Inc., Framingham, MA). The instrument was operated in a linear mode (25-kV acceleration, 93% grid, 0.15% guide wire, and 200-MHz digitizer) and employed delayed extraction (320 ns). The m/z scale was calibrated using a mixture of known protein samples as follows: apomyoglobin (16.95 kDa), thioredoxin (11.67 kDa), and their respective dimers. Samples (16–20 μg) were mixed with a saturated solution (10 mg/ml) of sinapinic acid matrix (1:1 v/v) and then mixed with acetonitrile containing 0.1% (w/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The samples were deposited on the probe, air-dried, and inserted into the instrument. Spectra arising from 50 to 100 laser shots were averaged, and a 19-point smoothing of data were utilized for protein samples.Dynamic Light Scattering—Measurements were made with a DynaPro-MS/X (Protein Solutions Inc., Lakewood, NJ) at 20 °C using ∼47 μl of 0.5 mg of protein/ml of gel filtration buffer. All samples were either filtered (0.2 μm; Whatman) or centrifuged (5000 × g, 5 min) prior to the measurements. Diffusion coefficients were obtained from the analysis of the decay of the scattered intensity autocorrelation function. The hydrodynamic radius could be deduced from the diffusion coefficients using the Stokes-Einstein equation. All calculations were performed using the software Dynamics V6 provided by the manufacturer.Quantification of GARPs in ROS—The amount of GARP proteins relative to each other and to other proteins in the ROS (rhodopsin, PDE) was determined by SDS-PAGE and densitometric image analysis of Western blots on a Kodak Image Station. Three different ROS preparations were used. We performed the Western blot analysis using a polyclonal “anti-GARP” antibody (3Körschen H.G. Beyermann M. Müller F. Heck M. Vantler M. Koch K.-W. Kellner R. Wolfrum U. Bode C. Hofmann K.P. Kaupp U.B. Nature. 1999; 400: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) that labels the following three bands: namely the B1 subunit of the cGMP-gated channel, GARP1, and GARP2. The amount of rhodopsin in ROS preparations was determined spectrophotometrically (22Moritz O.L. Molday R.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 352-362PubMed Google Scholar). The samples covered a concentration range of 0.1–0.7 μg of rhodopsin. The intensities of bands belonging to each GARP protein in the Western blots were determined densitometrically. The ratio of GARP proteins is a result of two independent experiments performed in duplicate using three different ROS preparations (total of 12 values).NMR Spectroscopy—NMR samples contained 0.125 mm purified rGARP2 protein in 10 mm Na+ phosphate, 120 mm NaCl, pH 5.2 or 6.8, and 95% H2O, 5% D2O. NMR spectra were recorded at 298 K on a Varian Unity INOVA spectrometer operating at a 600-MHz proton frequency equipped with a 5-mm triple resonance probe and z axis pulsed field gradient. Suppression of the water resonance was achieved through the WATERGATE technique (23Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3501) Google Scholar). For each spectrum a sum of 128 transients was accumulated to achieve a good signal-to-noise ratio. Chemical shifts were referenced against the methyl signal of external sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate. Data were processed and plotted using the VnmrJ software (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Natural abundance 1H, 15N-HSQC experiments were measured using standard pulse sequences at 600- and 700-MHz with Bruker spectrometers, each equipped with a 5-mm triple resonance cryoprobe and z axis pulsed field gradients. Spectra were acquired at 298 K in 90% H2O, 10% D2O, pH 3. The concentration of the peptides was 1.5 mm in each case. 1H chemical shifts were referenced to sodium 3-trimethylsilyl-2,2,3,3,-d4-proprionate at 0.00 ppm, and 13C and 15N chemical shifts were calculated from the 1H frequency (24Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2053) Google Scholar). HSQC type experiments were obtained and processed using XWINNMR 3.0 (Bruker Inc.) and TOP-SPIN 1.3b (Bruker Inc.).Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD spectra were recorded with a Jasco J810 spectropolarimeter. Spectra of purified GARP proteins in CD buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm Na2SO4; 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.25 mm n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside) were recorded as the average of four individual spectral scans in the far-UV region from 190 to 300 nm using a cuvette with a path length of 0.2 cm and the following parameters: instrument sensitivity, 1 millidegrees; response time, 2 s; scan speed, 50 nm/min. Spectra were analyzed using the Dichroweb on-line server (25Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 668-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar, 26Lobley A. Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 211-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Reference data sets 4 and 7 (27Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal.

Biochem. 2000; 287: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) were used, which are compatible with the wavelength range used in this study. To test the reliability of the secondary structure determinations, a number of alternative algorithms were used for the structure calculations as follows: SELCON3 (29Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 30Sreerama N. Venyaminov S.Y. Woody R.W. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 370-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar), CONTIN (31Provencher S.W. Glockner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar, 32Van Stokkum I.H.M. Spoelder H.J.W. Bloemendal M. Van Grondelle R. Groen F.C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 191: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), and CDSSTR (27Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2478) Google Scholar, 33Compton L.A. Johnson Jr., W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 34Manavalan P. Johnson Jr., W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). The analysis provided calculated secondary structures and the goodness-of-fit parameter, normalized root mean square deviation (NRMSD). The NRMSD parameter (25Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 668-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar) is defined as follows: Σ(θexp – θcal)2/(θexp)2)1/2 summed over all wavelengths, where θexp and θcal are the experimental ellipticities and the ellipticities of the back-calculated spectra, respectively. High NRMSD values (>0.1) indicate that the back-calculated and experimental spectra are not in good agreement (25Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 668-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar). However, a low NRMSD value is not always sufficient to indicate an accurate analysis. Because Dichroweb defines the NMRSD parameter in the same way for all analyses, the NMRSD parameter provides a direct means to compare the results obtained using different data bases and algorithms and in the selection of the most appropriate reference data set for the relevant protein. The NMRSD values obtained in this study were all well below 0.1.Peptide Synthesis—Peptide sequences corresponding to repeats R1–R4 in GARP sequences were synthesized according to standard protocols (72Pennington M.W. Dunn B.M. Peptide Synthesis Protocols. 35. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1994Crossref Google Scholar). R1 (residues 1–14) corresponds to MLGWVQRVLPQPPG; R2 (residues 100–117) corresponds to VLTWLRKGVEKVVPQPAH; R3 (residues 167–184) corresponds to LLRWFEQNLEKMLPQPPK; and R4 (residues 255–271) corresponds to LMAWILHRLEMALPQPV.Chemical Cross-linking of Purified GARP2 Protein—Native GARP2 was purified as described above. The purified protein (100 ng/ml) was adapted to cross-linking conditions (10 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride), and the cross-linking reaction was carried out by adding 10× stock solution of the amino-specific cross-linker bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3) or the thiol-specific cross-linker 1,4-bismaleimidyl-2,3-dihydroxybutane (BMDB) at room temperature (35Weitz D. Ficek N. Kremmer E. Bauer P.J. Kaupp U.B. Neuron. 2002; 36: 881-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Final concentrations of the cross-linkers BS3 and BMDB in the reactions were 0.5 mm and 2.5 μm, respectively. Intermediate cross-link products were identified at various times by termination of the reaction with SDS sample buffer. Cross-link products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis (35Weitz D. Ficek N. Kremmer E. Bauer P.J. Kaupp U.B. Neuron. 2002; 36: 881-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Experiments were performed in a Beckman Optima XL-A ultracentrifuge, using an An-50Ti rotor at a temperature of 4 °C. Absorbance versus radius data, A(r) or A(r,t), were recorded at 280 nm. For the sedimentation equilibrium experiments, Epon 6-channel cells with a path length of 1.2 cm were used with sample and reference volumes of 130 and 135 μl, respectively. The experimental A(r) profiles were evaluated as described earlier (36Schubert D. Schuck P. Prog. Colloid Polym. Sci. 1991; 86: 12-22Crossref Google Scholar, 37Schuck P. Legrum B. Passow H.

Sci. 1994; 94: 1-13Crossref Google Scholar). Sedimentation velocity runs used Epon double sector cells of 1.2 cm optical length. Sample and reference volumes were 380 and 400 μl, respectively. The experimental A(r,t) data were analyzed by the program SEDFIT applying direct boundary modeling with distribution of Lamm equation solutions (40Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3005) Google Scholar, 41Lebowitz J. Lewis M.S. Schuck P. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2067-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). The partial specific volume, v̄, of GARP2 and GARP1 in aqueous buffers was calculated from the amino acid composition according to the method of Durchschlag, applying the data set of Cohn and Edsall, as tabulated in Ref. 42Durchschlag H. Hinz H.J. Thermodynamic Data for Biochemistry and Biotechnology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1986: 45-128Crossref Google Scholar. This led to v̄ = 0.722 ml/g for GARP2 and v̄ = 0.702 ml/g for GARP1. The densities and viscosities of the buffers were calculated using the program SEDNTERP (43Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C.

The apparent molecular mass (Mr) of GARP1 and GARP2 (∼130 and ∼62 kDa, respectively) is twice as large as that predicted by the amino acid sequence (64.5 and 31.9 kDa, respectively). The electrophoretic mobility of GARP proteins could be anomalously low for a number of different reasons. 1) Bands may represent dimers of GARP1 and GARP2, respectively. 2) The high content of glutamate residues may result in poor binding of SDS and, thereby, reduced mobility. 3) GARPs may adopt an unusual shape. Previous studies have provided evidence that GARP2 associates both with other retinal proteins (3Körschen H.G. Beyermann M. Müller F. Heck M. Vantler M. Koch K.-W. Kellner R. Wolfrum U. Bode C.

Therefore, we performed sequence analysis and studied the structural properties and the oligomeric state of native GARP1 and GARP2 purified from rod photoreceptors.Amino Acid Sequence Analysis of GARP1 and GARP2—We applied a series of predictors of natural disordered regions (PONDR) to GARP1 and GARP2 and their orthologs to identify the regions that are lacking a fixed tertiary structure (19Li X.

https://openalex.org/W2063222714,"Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) is a mitochondrial flavoprotein, which upon apoptosis induction translocates to the nucleus where it interacts with DNA by virtue of positive charges clustered on the AIF surface. Here we show that the AIF interactome, as determined by mass spectroscopy, contains a large panel of ribonucleoproteins, which apparently bind to AIF through the RNA moiety. However, AIF is devoid of any detectable RNAse activity both in vitro and in vivo. Recombinant AIF can directly bind to DNA as well as to RNA. This binding can be visualized by electron microscopy, revealing that AIF can condense DNA, showing a preferential binding to single-stranded over double-stranded DNA. AIF also binds and aggregates single-stranded and structured RNA in vitro. Single-stranded poly A, poly G and poly C, as well double-stranded A/T and G/C RNA competed with DNA for AIF binding with a similar efficiency, thus corroborating a computer-calculated molecular model in which the binding site within AIF is the same for distinct nucleic acid species, without a clear sequence specificity. Among the preferred electron donors and acceptors of AIF, nicotine adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) was particularly efficient in enhancing the generation of higher-order AIF/DNA and AIF/RNA complexes.

In this study, we investigated the role of SphK1 in the regulation of expression of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) in dermal fibroblasts, a key event in regulation of extra cellular matrix. We show that overexpression of SphK1 up-regulated MMP1 protein, MMP1 mRNA, and MMP1 promoter activity, and this action of SphK1 required activation of the ERK1/2-Ets1 and NF-kB pathways. Furthermore, experiments using SphK1 specific siRNA demonstrated that SphK1 is required for the TNF-α stimulation of MMP1. Additional data revealed a specific role of dhS1P, and not S1P, as a mediator of SphK1dependent activation of ERK1/2 and up-regulation of MMP1. The stimulatory effect of dhS1P was sensitive to pertussis toxin, suggesting a possible involvement of a G-protein-coupled receptor. In contrast, S1P, but not dhS1P, stimulated the induction of COX-2, which demonstrated selective actions of these two closely related bioactive lipids. In conclusion, this study describes a novel mode of SphK1 signaling through generation of dhS1P with a key role in mediating transcriptional responses to TNF-α. This is the first report of selective function of dhS1P as compared with the better studied S1P."
https://openalex.org/W2101206537,"We have previously shown that capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves contribute to the regulation of normal cardiac function and to the development of cardiac adaptation to ischemic stress; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Therefore, here we assessed cardiac functional alterations and relative gene expression changes by DNA microarray analysis of 6400 genes in rat hearts 7 days after the end of systemic capsaicin treatment protocol leading to selective sensory chemodenervation. Capsaicin pretreatment resulted in a cardiac dysfunction characterized by elevation of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and led to altered expression of 80 genes of known function or homology to known sequences. Forty-seven genes exhibited significant up-regulation and 33 genes were down-regulated (changes ranged from -3.9 to +4.8-fold). The expression changes of 10 selected genes were verified, and an additional 11 genes were examined by real-time quantitative PCR. This is the first demonstration that gene expression changes in the heart due to capsaicin pretreatment included vanilloid receptor-1 (capsaicin receptor), transient receptor potential protein, GABA receptor rho-3 subunit, 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor B, neurokinin receptor 2, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, matrix metalloproteinase-13, cytochrome P450, farnesyl-transferase, ApoB, and leptin. None of the genes have been previously shown to be involved in the mechanism of the cardiac functional effects of sensory chemodenervation by capsaicin. We conclude that capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves play a significant role in the regulation of a variety of neuronal and non-neuronal genes in the heart and possibly in other tissues as well."
https://openalex.org/W2041970562,"Expression microarray analysis identified CITED1 among a group of genes specifically upregulated in the pubertal mouse mammary gland. At puberty, CITED1 localizes to the luminal epithelial cell population of the mammary ducts and the body cells of the terminal end buds. Generation of CITED1 gene knockout mice showed that homozygous null mutants exhibit retarded mammary ductal growth at puberty and, in addition, dilated ductal structures with a lack of spatial restriction of the subtending branches. Analysis of CITED1 homozygous null and heterozygous null mammary gland gene expression using microarrays suggested that the mammary-specific phenotype seen in the homozygous null females is due to a disturbance in the transcription of a number of key mediators of pubertal ductal morphogenesis. These include estrogen and TGFβ responsive genes, such as the EGFR/ErbB2 ligand, amphiregulin, whose transcription we suggest is directly or indirectly regulated by CITED1."

DPM is synthesized from dolichol phosphate and GDP-Man on the cytosolic surface of the ER membrane by DPM synthase (GDP-α-Man: dolichol-phosphate β-mannosyltransferase; EC 2.4.1.83) and then is flipped onto the luminal side and used as a donor substrate. In lower eukaryotes, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Trypanosoma brucei, DPM synthase consists of a single component (Dpm1p and TbDpm1, respectively) that possesses one predicted transmembrane region near the C terminus for anchoring to the ER membrane (11Orlean P.

J. 1996; 316: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Dpm1 homologues of higher eukaryotes, namely fission yeast, fungi, and animals, have no transmembrane region (13Colussi P.A. Taron C.H. Mack J.C. Orlean P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7873-7878Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of adapter molecules for membrane anchoring. In fact, we previously demonstrated that S. cerevisiae Dpm1 was able to complement two different DPM synthase-defective mutants, namely a Thy-1-negative class E mutant of mouse T-cell lymphoma and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) Lec15 cells, whereas human DPM1 was only able to complement the class E mutant (14Tomita S. Inoue N. Maeda Y. Ohishi K. Takeda J. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9249-9254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We cloned a second component of DPM synthase, DPM2, which is the gene responsible for CHO Lec15 cells (15Maeda Y. Tomita S. Watanabe R. Ohishi K. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4920-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and then further identified a third component, DPM3, in the biochemically purified active enzyme complex (16Maeda Y. Tanaka S. Hino J. Kangawa K. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2475-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Mammalian DPM1 was predicted to be a soluble protein and found to be associated with two small membrane proteins, DPM2 and DPM3. Our previous analyses using mammalian cells revealed that: (i) DPM2 stabilizes the expression of DPM3; (ii) DPM3 binds both DPM2 and DPM1; (iii) the N-terminal transmembrane regions of DPM3 are important for binding to DPM2; and (iv) the C-terminal hydrophilic region of DPM3 is important for binding to DPM1 (15Maeda Y.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2475-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, DPM3 is most likely to be the anchoring molecule that tethers DPM1 to the ER membrane, although direct evidence was missing due to the lack of DPM3 mutant or knock-out cells. In the present study, we established a DPM3 mutant CHO cell line for the first time and addressed the biological functions of DPM3 using this mutant. Here we describe the essential role of the C-terminal coiled-coil domain of DPM3 and the fate of DPM1 in DPM3-defective mutant cells. Cell Culture—CHO K1 and CHO Lec35 cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. CHO F21 and CHO2.38 cells were cultured in the same medium supplemented with 600 μg/ml G418 (Nacalai Tesque), 400 μg/ml hygromycin B (Wako), and 50 μg/ml blasticidin S (InvivoGen). CHO2.38/DPM3, CHO K1/3HSV-DPM1, and CHO2.38/3HSV-DPM1 cells were cultured in medium containing 20 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Flow Cytometric Analysis—Cells were stained with anti-CD59 (clone 5H8), anti-decay-accelerating factor (DAF; clone IA10) or anti-Chinese hamster urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR; clone 5D6) primary antibodies and then with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (ICN/Cappel). When cells were stained with a biotinylated antibody, phycoerythrin-streptavidin (Biomeda) was used as the secondary conjugate. Stained cells were analyzed using a FACScan (BD Biosciences). Establishment of GPI-anchored Protein-defective CHO Mutant Cells—The parental CHO cell line F21 was established by stable transfection of the wild-type CHO K1 cells with cDNAs of GPI-anchored protein markers (human CD59 and DAF) and previously known GPI biosynthetic enzymes (DPM1, DPM2, SL15, PIG-A, PIG-L, PIG-V, PIG-B, PIG-N, PIG-F, GAA1, and PIG-U) as described previously (3Ashida H. Hong Y. Murakami Y. Shishioh N. Sugimoto N. Kim Y.U. Maeda Y. Kinoshita T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1439-1448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CHO F21 cells (3 × 107) were mutagenized with 1.2 μg/ml N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (Nacalai Tesque) for 2 days, cultured in fresh medium for 1 day, transferred to 12-well plates, and cultured for 6 days. Next, the cells were treated with 2.0 nm proaerolysin from Aeromonas hydrophila (Protox Biotech) for 3 days and 2.0 nm α-toxin from Clostridium septicum (a gift from Dr. N. Sugimoto, Osaka University) for 3 days. Surviving cells were isolated by limiting dilution. Transfection of Cells—Cells were transfected by either electroporation or lipofection. For electroporation, CHO cells (4 × 106) suspended in 0.4 ml of culture medium were electroporated at 260 V and 1,000 microfarads with 10 μg of DNA using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). For lipofection, CHO cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Labeling of GPI Precursors and Dolichol-linked Oligosaccharides—For labeling with Man, CHO cells (1 × 106) were preincubated in medium containing 100 μg/ml glucose and 10 μg/ml tunicamycin (Sigma) for 1 h and then incubated in the same medium containing 40 μCi/ml d-[2-3H]Man (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) for 45 min. Lipids were extracted from the cells with chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) and then partitioned into water-saturated 1-butanol. The extracts were applied to a silica gel TLC plate (Merck), and developed with chloroform:methanol:water (10:10:3, v/v/v) to analyze the GPI anchor precursors. The radiolabeled lipids were detected using a Fuji BAS1500 image analyzer (Fuji Film). For analysis of dolichol-linked N-glycan precursors, cells were metabolically labeled with [3H]Man in the absence of tunicamycin. Dolichol-linked oligosaccharides were extracted and hydrolyzed with 0.1 m HCl, 80% tetrahydrofuran at 65 °C for 30 min to release the oligosaccharides. After neutralization, the oligosaccharides were analyzed by TLC using 1-propanol:acetic acid:water (3:3:2, v/v/v) (3Ashida H. Hong Y. Murakami Y. Shishioh N. Sugimoto N. Kim Y.U. Maeda Y. Kinoshita T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1439-1448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cloning of Chinese Hamster DPM3 cDNA—The cDNA of Chinese hamster (Cricetulus griseus) DPM3 was cloned by degenerate reverse transcription-PCR using mRNA prepared from CHO K1 cells as a template and the following primers: forward, 5′-GACGAARTTARCRCAGTGGCTTTGGGGACT; reverse, 5′-TCGGGCCTCCWSKATCTGGCTCTGCAGCTC. The 5′ and 3′ sequences were obtained by 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) PCR. The GenBank™ accession number of Chinese hamster DPM3 cDNA is AB219149. Plasmids—Site-directed mutagenesis of pME/FLAG-DPM3 was carried out using a PCR-based method. To construct pME/3HSV-DPM3tail and pME/GST-DPM3tail, a DNA fragment encoding the C-terminal 35 amino acids (Gly58-Phe92) of DPM3 was amplified with a specific forward primer containing a SalI site (5′-AAGTCGACGGTGCAGGCTATCGTGTGGCCACTTTTCATG; the SalI site is underlined) and a reverse vector primer (5′-GTTAACAACAACAATTGCATTCAT) using pME/FLAG-DPM3 as a template and then was ligated into the pME/3HSV and pME/GST vectors, respectively. To prepare the chimeric construct pME/PIG-Ltm-DPM3tail, a DNA fragment encoding the N-terminal 30 amino acids (Met1-Ser30) of PIG-L was amplified with a forward SRα primer (5′-TGACCCTGCTTGCTCAACTCTACG) and a specific reverse primer containing a SalI site (5′-AAGTCGACACTCTTCATTCGTTCTGAGGAG; the SalI site is underlined) using pME/py/PIG-L as a template, and the PCR product was used to replace the 3HSV sequence of pME/3HSV-DPM3tail. Human CHIP (C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein) cDNA was amplified by PCR using a cDNA library prepared from Hep3B cells as a template. Affinity Precipitation and Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in TEN buffer (1.0% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 5.0 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)), and cell debris was removed by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g for 1 h). For immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged proteins, anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma) was added to the supernatant and rotated at 4 °C for 2 h. For immunoprecipitation of HSV-tagged or GST-tagged proteins, anti-HSV (Novagen) or anti-GST (Amersham Biosciences) antibodies plus protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) were added. The beads were collected and washed twice with TEN buffer. Next, the absorbed proteins were eluted with reducing SDS sample buffer. Aliquots of the samples were separated in a 10-20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was treated with a primary antibody and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein G (Bio-Rad). Detection was carried out using Western Lightning chemiluminescence reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). DPM3 Is Essential for DPM Synthase Activity—We previously identified DPM3 in the DPM synthase complex that was affinity-purified using DPM1 double-tagged with GST and FLAG (16Maeda Y. Tanaka S. Hino J. Kangawa K. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2475-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Because neither mutant nor knock-out cells of DPM3 have been established to date, it is unknown whether DPM3 is essential for the function of DPM synthase. To obtain DPM3 mutant cells, we screened GPI-anchored protein-defective mutant cells, which were generated from the parental CHO F21 cells by chemical mutagenesis, followed by selection with A. hydrophila proaerolysin and/or C. septicum α-toxin, both of which are GPI anchor-recognizing pore-forming cytolytic toxins (3Ashida H. Hong Y. Murakami Y. Shishioh N. Sugimoto N. Kim Y.U. Maeda Y. Kinoshita T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1439-1448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found one mutant cell line, CHO2.38, in which surface expressions of the GPI-anchored proteins CD59, DAF, and uPAR were markedly decreased compared with the parental cells (Fig. 1A). The surface expressions of these GPI-anchored proteins were restored by transient transfection of DPM3 cDNA but not by transfection of DPM1 or DPM2 cDNA (Fig. 1B). To confirm the presence of a mutation in the DPM3 gene, we sequenced and compared the DPM3 mRNAs from CHO K1 and CHO2.38 cells. Chinese hamster DPM3 was found to encode 92 amino acid residues, as is the case for humans and mice, and showed 92% (85/92) and 97% (89/92) identities with these species, respectively. By comparison of the nucleotide sequences, we found an 8-base deletion at nucleotides 108-115 in the DPM3 cDNA from CHO2.38 cells (Fig. 1C). This mutation, which causes a frameshift, may completely abolish the function of DPM3. CHO2.38 cells stably transfected with pME/puro/DPM3 (CHO2.38/DPM3 cells) showed the same expression levels of surface GPI-anchored proteins as the parental CHO F21 cells (Fig. 1D). In vitro enzyme assays using microsomes revealed that CHO2.38 cells did not synthesize either DPM or Man-containing GPI anchor precursors (Fig. 1E, lane 3), whereas CHO2.38/DPM3 cells produced more DPM than CHO F21 cells (Fig. 1E, lane 2 versus lane 1). Furthermore, CHO2.38 cells did not synthesize the mature N-glycan precursor Dol-P-P-GlcNAc2Man9Glc3 and, instead, accumulated two immature precursors (Fig. 1F, lane 2). The upper large spot (Fig. 1F, lane 2) was GlcNAc2Man5, which was identical to the spot accumulated in CHO Lec35 cells (Fig. 1F, lane 3) (CHO Lec35 is a mutant cell line defective in the general usage of both DPM and dolichol-phosphate glucose (17Anand M. Rush J.S. Ray S. Doucey M.A. Weik J. Ware F.E. Hofsteenge J. Waechter C.J. Lehrman M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 487-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar)). The lower weak spot (Fig. 1F, lane 2) was probably GlcNAc2Man5Glc3. Taken together, these results indicate that the CHO2.38 cell line is a DPM3-defective mutant and that DPM3 is an essential component for DPM synthase activity. A Cytosolic Coiled-coil Domain Near the C Terminus of DPM3 Is Critical for DPM Synthase Activity—DPM3 is a small protein that consists of 92 amino acid residues. In silico analyses of human DPM3 predicted the presence of two transmembrane regions (Trp9-Pro31 and Glu36-Gly58) in the N-terminal portion and a coiled-coil domain (Glu68-Arg88) in the C-terminal hydrophilic portion (Fig. 2A). Because a FLAG tag attached to the N terminus of DPM3 faced the cytosolic surface of the ER membrane, as revealed by immunomicroscopic analysis (data not shown), the C-terminal coiled-coil domain must also be oriented toward the cytosol. To form such a coiled-coil structure, regularly aligned hydrophobic amino acid residues need to be on the same side of an α-helix. A comparison of the amino acid sequences of DPM3 homologues from various eukaryotes revealed four hydrophobic amino acid residues, Leu74, Ile78, Ala81, and Leu85, that were conserved (Fig. 2B) and present on the same side of the α-helix (Fig. 2C). Thus, we introduced point mutations into three of these aliphatic residues, namely Leu74, Ile78, and Leu85, and analyzed the biological activities of the mutants. The constructs were FLAG-tagged at the N terminus, and their expressions were confirmed to be similar by Western blotting (data not shown). We transiently transfected CHO2.38 cells with the mutant constructs and analyzed their surface expressions of CD59 by FACS (Fig. 2D). The single-point mutants I78T and L85S and the double-point mutant I78T/L85S showed nearly the same activities as wild-type DPM3, whereas the single-point mutant L74S showed much lower restoration and the two double-point mutants L74S/I78T and L74S/L85S showed only slight restoration. The triple-point mutant L74S/I78T/L85S, designated DPM3(triple), completely lost its activity and was similar to DPM3ΔC, which lacked the C-terminal 27 amino acids (16Maeda Y. Tanaka S. Hino J. Kangawa K. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2475-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These results indicate that hydrophobic residues in the coiled-coil domain of DPM3 are very important for DPM synthase activity. The C-terminal Coiled-coil Domain of DPM3 Tethers DPM1—To test whether these three hydrophobic residues in the coiled-coil domain of DPM3 function by interacting with the catalytic subunit DPM1, we analyzed the binding of DPM3 to DPM1 by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. CHO K1 cells were transiently co-transfected with pME/3HSV-DPM1 and either pME/FLAG-DPM3(wt), pME/FLAG-DPM3(triple), or pME/FLAG-DPM3ΔC. The cells were then lysed in 1.0% digitonin, and the FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG agarose beads. FLAG-DPM3 proteins and co-immunoprecipitated 3HSV-DPM1 were detected by Western blotting. Although the three constructs of FLAG-DPM3 were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 3, top panel), 3HSV-DPM1 was only co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-DPM3(wt) (Fig. 3, middle panel, lane 1) and not with FLAG-DPM3(triple) (Fig. 3, middle panel, lane 2) or FLAG-DPM3ΔC (Fig. 3, middle panel, lane 3). The total expression level of 3HSV-DPM1 was about 3-fold higher after co-expression with FLAG-DPM3(wt) than after co-expression with FLAG-DPM3(triple) or FLAG-DPM3ΔC (Fig. 3, bottom panel), suggesting that DPM1 expression was enhanced by DPM3. These results indicate that the cytosolic coiled-coil domain of DPM3 is essential for tethering DPM1 to the ER membrane. When 1.0% Nonidet P-40 was used for solubilization, co-immunoprecipitation of 3HSV-DPM1 with FLAG-DPM3(wt) was lost (data not shown), indicating that the association of these two molecules is maintained by a relatively weak hydrophobic interaction. Transmembrane Regions of DPM3 Are Not Essential for DPM Synthase—To address the function of the two transmembrane regions of DPM3, we replaced them with a transmembrane region from another membrane protein. For this, we chose PIG-L, which encodes GlcNAc-phosphatidylinositol N-deacetylase, the second-step enzyme in GPI biosynthesis, which is a type I transmembrane protein with a large C-terminal portion in the cytosol and a transmembrane region (Val3-Ala25) near the N terminus (18Nakamura N. Inoue N. Watanabe R. Takahashi M. Takeda J. Stevens V.L. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15834-15840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 19Pottekat A. Menon A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15743-15751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). PIG-L is widely distributed in the ER membrane, and its ER localization is partly dependent upon the transmembrane region (19Pottekat A. Menon A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15743-15751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We prepared a chimeric construct of the N-terminal portion (Met1-Ser30) of PIG-L, including the transmembrane region and the C-terminal tail (Gly58-Phe92) of DPM3, and designated it PIG-Ltm-DPM3tail. CHO2.38 cells were transiently transfected with pME/PIG-Ltm-DPM3tail(wt) or pME/PIG-Ltm-DPM3tail(triple), and their surface expressions of CD59 were analyzed by FACS. Interestingly, PIG-Ltm-DPM3tail(wt) restored the surface expression of CD59 similar to that of the wild-type DPM3 (Fig. 4A, panels 1 and 2). PIG-Ltm-DPM3tail(triple) and PIG-L showed no restoration, as expected (Fig. 4A, panels 3 and 4). These results suggest that the two transmembrane regions of DPM3 have no specific function in terms of the DPM synthesis required for the GPI anchor. Next, we expressed soluble forms of the DPM3tail constructs. CHO2.38 cells were transiently transfected with the wild-type and triple-mutant forms of 3HSV-DPM3tail and GST-DPM3tail. All of the soluble constructs were strongly expressed (data not shown). Surprisingly, both the 3HSV-DPM3tail(wt) and GST-DPM3tail(wt) constructs showed some activity (Fig. 4B, panels 2 and 4), whereas the triple-mutant constructs did not (Fig. 4B, panels 3 and 5). These results indicate that DPM1 is partially active in the presence of the coiled-coil domain of DPM3, even in a soluble form, and that the transmembrane regions of DPM3 are not essential. DPM1 Is Degraded by the Proteasome in DPM3-defective Cells—The expression of DPM1 was enhanced by co-transfection of the wild-type DPM3 into CHO K1 cells (Fig. 3), suggesting that DPM3 stabilizes DPM1 on the ER membrane. To examine whether DPM1 is expressed in the absence of DPM3, we transiently transfected CHO2.38 cells with pME/3HSV-DPM1 in the presence or absence of pME/3HSV-DPM3. Rat microsomal aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) was used as a control for transfection efficiency. After 2 days of culture, the cells were lysed, and the protein expression was analyzed by Western blotting. Unexpectedly, 3HSV-DPM1 was hardly detected in the absence of DPM3 (Fig. 5A, lane 2), whereas it was strongly expressed in the presence of DPM3 (Fig. 5A, lane 1). Similar experiments were carried out for DPM2. Unlike DPM1, DPM2 was stably expressed in the presence or absence of DPM3 (Fig. 5A, lanes 3 and 4). Because DPM1 was hardly expressed in DPM3-defective CHO2.38 cells, we speculated that it was rapidly degraded after translation. To elucidate this, we stably transfected CHO K1 and CHO2.38 cells with pME/puro/3HSV-DPM1 to generate CHO K1/3HSV-DPM1 and CHO2.38/3HSV-DPM1 cells, respectively, and analyzed their 3HSV-DPM1expression levels. DPM1 was strongly expressed in CHO K1/3HSV-DPM1 cells (Fig. 5B, lane 1) but was hardly expressed in CHO2.38/3HSV-DPM1 cells (Fig. 5B, lane 2), as expected. When a DPM3 cDNA was transiently transfected into CHO2.38/3HSV-DPM1 cells, the expression of DPM1 was recovered to some extent (Fig. 5B, lane 3), indicating that the cDNA of DPM1 was maintained in the cells but the protein was degraded. Next, we speculated that DPM1 expressed in CHO2.38 cells may be dissociated from the ER membrane and degraded by the proteasome, because DPM1 is predicted to be located on the cytosolic surface of the ER membrane. To test this hypothesis, we cultured CHO K1/3HSV-DPM1 and CHO2.38/3HSV-DPM1 cells in the presence of protease inhibitors. In CHO K1/3HSV-DPM1 cells, the expression levels of 3HSV-DPM1 remained unchanged following the addition of lactacystin, an inhibitor of the proteasome, or leupeptin, an inhibitor of lysosomal proteases (Fig. 5C, lanes 1-3). In contrast, in CHO2.38/3HSV-DPM1 cells, the expression of 3HSV-DPM1 was restored after the addition of lactacystin (Fig. 5C, lane 5) but not leupeptin (Fig. 5C, lane 6). These results strongly suggest that DPM1 is highly unstable and degraded by the proteasome in the cytosol when DPM3 is absent. It is worth noting that CD59 expression was not restored at all in CHO2.38/3HSV-DPM1 cells following the treatment with lactacystin (Fig. 5D, panels 2 and 4), although the level of DPM1 protein was similar to that in CHO2.38/3HSV-DPM1 cells transiently transfected with DPM3 cDNA (Fig. 5C, lane 5, versus Fig. 5B, lane 3). These results suggest that the coiled-coil domain of DPM3 is necessary not only for the stabilization of DPM1 but also for its enzyme activity. Free DPM1 Strongly Interacts with CHIP, a Chaperone-dependent E3 Ubiquitin Ligase—There are several hundred known candidates for E3 ubiquitin ligases in mammalian genomes, and these define the specificity of the target protein degradation by the proteasome. To explore which ubiquitin ligase is responsible for the degradation of DPM1, we focused on CHIP, which was originally discovered as a co-chaperone containing a tetratricopeptide repeat domain (20Ballinger C.A. Connell P. Wu Y. Hu Z. Thompson L.J. Yin L.Y. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar) and later identified to be a chaperone-dependent U-box-type E3 ubiquitin ligase (21Jiang J. Ballinger C.A. Wu Y. Dai Q. Cyr D.M. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42938-42944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 22Hatakeyama S. Yada M. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Nakayama K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33111-33120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). We transiently transfected CHO2.38 cells with GST-CHIP and either 3HSV-ALDH as a control or 3HSV-DPM1. GST-CHIP was strongly expressed in all transfectants (Fig. 6, bottom panel). 3HSV-ALDH was also strongly expressed in the presence or absence of lactacystin (Fig. 6, top panel, lanes 1-4; lanes 3 and 4 contain 10% of the loading of lanes 1 and 2, respectively). However, very little GST-CHIP co-immunoprecipitated with 3HSV-ALDH (Fig. 6, middle panel, lanes 1 and 2), and it was hardly detected in the lanes with the 10% loadings (Fig. 6, middle panel, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast to ALDH, the expression of 3HSV-DPM1 was very weak in the absence of lactacystin and increased after the addition of lactacystin (Fig. 6, top panel, lanes 5 and 6, respectively). Despite its weak expression, GST-CHIP was much more strongly co-immunoprecipitated with 3HSV-DPM1 than with ALDH (Fig. 6, middle panel, lanes 5 and 6 versus lanes 3 and 4). These results strongly suggest that free DPM1 is ubiquitinated by CHIP. Four of nine Man residues in the mature precursor of N-glycan are transferred from DPM in the ER lumen. After the glycan is transferred to proteins, all four Man residues are sequentially removed by ER α-mannosidase and Golgi α-mannosidases I and II. These residues are not essential for the viability of cultured mammalian cells but are important for quality control of glycoprotein production in the ER. It has been reported that the maturation, transport, and degradation of nascent glycoproteins in the ER are delayed in DPM synthase-defective cells (23Ermonval M. Cacan R. Gorgas K. Haas I.G. Verbert A. Buttin G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 323-336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, ER degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase-like protein (EDEM) was found to play a key role in ER-associated degradation by recognition of the terminal α1,2-linked Man residue in the GlcNAc2Man8 structure, which is derived from DPM (24Hosokawa N. Wada I. Hasegawa K. Yorihuzi T. Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Nagata K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). In humans, genetic diseases caused by mutations in DPM synthase are known and classified into congenital disorder of glycosylation type Ie (CDG-Ie). These patients show accumulation of the N-glycan precursor with GlcNAc2Man5 (25Kim S. Westphal V. Srikrishna G. Mehta D.P. Peterson S. Filiano J. Karnes P.S. Patterson M.C. Freeze H.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 26Imbach T. Schenk B. Schollen E. Burda P. Stutz A. Grunewald S. Bailie N.M. King M.D. Jaeken J. Matthijs G. Berger E.G. Aebi M. Hennet T. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), similar to the case with CHO2.38 cells (Fig. 1F). To date, mutations that cause CDG-Ie have been found only in DPM1 and not in DPM2 or DPM3. Because DPM3 and DPM2 are essential for enzyme activity (Fig. 1E), CDG-Ie patients harboring mutations in these subcomponents may be identified in the future. Defects in DPM synthesis also affect GPI anchor biosynthesis, because the three core Man residues of GPI are derived from DPM (Fig. 1A). Knock-out mice for PIG-A, which encodes the catalytic subunit of GPI-GlcNAc-transferase, the first-step enzyme of GPI anchor biosynthesis, show embryonic lethality (27Tarutani M. Itami S. Okabe M. Ikawa M. Tezuka T. Yoshikawa K. Kinoshita T. Takeda J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7400-7405Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that complete loss of DPM synthase activity may cause death in early embryogenesis. Specific defects in protein O-mannosyltransferase, which is also DPM-dependent, cause certain types of congenital muscular dystrophies with neuronal migration disorders, such as Walker-Warburg syndrome (28Beltran-Valero de Bernabe D. Currier S. Steinbrecher A. Celli J. van Beusekom E. van der Zwaag B. Kayserili H. Merlini L. Chitayat D. Dobyns W.B. Cormand B. Lehesjoki A.E. Cruces J. Voit T. Walsh C.A. van Bokhoven H. Brunner H.G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 1033-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Therefore, taken together, DPM synthesis is critical for multicellular functions. DPM synthases of higher eukaryotes consist of three subunits. It is difficult to understand how the DPM synthase complex is assembled and disassembled and why this enzyme complex evolved from a single-component enzyme found in some lower eukaryotes. We previously showed that DPM2 stabilized the expression of DPM3. On the other hand, however, DPM3 did not affect the expression of DPM2 (Fig. 5A). Because DPM2 is a multifunctional regulator, which is also found in the GPI-GlcNAc-transferase complex (29Watanabe R. Murakami Y. Marmor M.D. Inoue N. Maeda Y. Hino J. Kangawa K. Julius M. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4402-4411Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), it could be expressed independently. By co-immunoprecipitation experiments, DPM3 was confirmed to be the tethering molecule for DPM1, and its cytosolic coiled-coil domain was found to be important for this interaction (Fig. 3). In contrast to the importance of the DPM3 coiled-coil domain, the function of the two transmembrane regions of DPM3 remains unclear. Our previous analyses showed that DPM2 and DPM3 associated via their transmembrane regions and formed an active enzyme complex (16Maeda Y. Tanaka S. Hino J. Kangawa K. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2475-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, the chimeric protein PIG-Ltm-DPM3tail functioned in CHO2.38 cells (Fig. 4A), despite its inability to associate with DPM2 (data not shown). This indicates that the stable association of DPM2 and DPM3 is not necessary for the enzyme activity in vivo. The chimera did not work well in DPM2-null mutant CHO Lec15 cells (data not shown), suggesting that DPM2 has some functions other than stabilizing DPM3. Because there is evidence that DPM2 binds to dolichol phosphate (15Maeda Y. Tomita S. Watanabe R. Ohishi K. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4920-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), it may be required for recruitment of lipid substrates. DPM3 appeared to be a limiting factor for the formation of the DPM synthase complex, because the enzyme activity was enhanced by overexpression of DPM3 in CHO2.38 cells (Fig. 1E). When the amount of DPM3 is limited or depleted, excess DPM1 may be degraded by the proteasome, as demonstrated in CHO2.38 cells (Fig. 5). Although DPM1 does not have a transmembrane region, it does possess a hydrophobic peptide sequence near the C terminus that functions in its binding to DPM3 (15Maeda Y. Tomita S. Watanabe R. Ohishi K. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4920-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 16Maeda Y. Tanaka S. Hino J. Kangawa K. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2475-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, DPM1 dissociated from DPM3 must bear the hydrophobic peptide on the surface of the molecule, which could be a binding target for cytosolic chaperones. We demonstrated that free DPM1 formed a complex with an E3 ubiquitin ligase, CHIP (Fig. 6), which is known to bind an E2 ligase through its U-box domain and is also able to bind the cytosolic chaperones Hsc70/Hsp70 or Hsp90 through its tetratricopeptide repeat domain. It has been reported that CHIP accelerates the degradation of several cytosolic and membrane proteins and also that CHIP prefers misfolded proteins over correctly folded proteins (30Murata S. Minami Y. Minami M. Chiba T. Tanaka K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 31Murata S. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 572-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The interaction between DPM3 and DPM1 must be relatively weak, because it was stable in digitonin but labile in Nonidet P-40 (Fig. 3), suggesting that some intracellular stimuli may dissociate these two molecules under physiological conditions. It has been reported that cAMP-dependent protein kinase regulates mammalian DPM synthase activity by phosphorylating a serine residue in DPM1 (32Banerjee D.K. Kousvelari E.E. Baum B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6389-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 33Banerjee D.K. Aponte E. Dasilva J.J. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 21: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The conformational changes of DPM1 caused by such post-translational modifications may trigger dissociation of the DPM synthase complex.

https://openalex.org/W2007627307,"The role of the hormone prolactin (PRL) in the pathogenesis of breast cancer is mediated by its cognate receptor (PRLr). Ubiquitin-dependent degradation of the PRLr that negatively regulates PRL signaling is triggered by PRL-mediated phosphorylation of PRLr on Ser349 followed by the recruitment of the beta-transducin repeats-containing protein (β-TrCP) ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. We report here for the first time that interaction between PRLr and β-TrCP is less efficient in human breast cancer cells than in non-tumorigenic human mammary epithelial cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both PRLr degradation and PRLr phosphorylation on Ser349 are impaired in breast tumor cells and tissues, an observation that directly correlates with enhanced expression of the PRLr in malignant breast epithelium. These findings represent a novel mechanism through which altered PRLr stability may directly influence the pathogenesis of breast cancer."

In most of cases, however, aldolase seems to be targeted for structural rather than enzymatic purposes. For instance, binding of the glucose transporter GLUT4 to aldolase is supposed to provide GLUT4 with an anchorage to F-actin, thus allowing its translocation from intracellular vesicles to the cell surface upon insulin stimulation (11Kao A.W.

A quite similar scaffolding activity has been recently shown in Plasmodium and other apicomplexan parasites. In this case, aldolase connects the actin filaments to the cytoplasmic tail of members from the TRAP family (21Buscaglia C.A. Coppens I. Hol W.G. Nussenzweig V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4947-4957Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 22Jewett T.J. Sibley L.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 885-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The parasite actin-myosin motor localized underneath the plasma membrane then promotes the antero-posterior redistribution of TRAP molecules, which is critical for parasite motility and host cell invasion (for review, see Ref. 23Kappe S.H. Buscaglia C.A. Nussenzweig V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 29-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The binding of TRAP molecules to aldolase is mediated by a short acidic sequence containing a sub-terminal tryptophan (Trp) conserved across the protein family and is competitively inhibited by aldolase substrate/products (21Buscaglia C.A.

The GST fusion protein spanning the last 25 residues of Plasmodium berghei TRAP has been described (21Buscaglia C.A. Coppens I. Hol W.G. Nussenzweig V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4947-4957Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and mutants were generated by PCR using this clone as template. The aldolase binding regions of human GLUT4 (11Kao A.W. Noda Y.

Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2966-2971Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) were constructed by fill-in of partially overlapping oligonucleotides in the presence of Taq DNA polymerase and dNTPs. Additional mutant clones derived from pGEX-WASp, pGEX-GLUT4, and pGEX-Band3 clones were generated by PCR and cloned into the EcoRI/SalI sites of pGEX4T-1. The GST fusion molecules containing the pleckstrin homology domain of the human phospholipase D2 and the E subunit of the peripheral domain (V1) of the human vacuolar-type H+-ATPase have been described (9Lu M.

GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli, purified to apparent homogeneity as described elsewhere (26Alvarez P. Buscaglia C.A. Campetella O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3375-3381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and quantified using the Micro BCA™ protein assay kit (Pierce). Binding and Competition Assays—Polystyrene ELISA microplates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated either with 4 pmol/well of GST fusion protein or 1 nmol/well of synthetic peptide and probed with the indicated biotin-labeled aldolase as described (21Buscaglia C.A. Coppens I. Hol W.G. Nussenzweig V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4947-4957Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). For displacement assays, a fixed aldolase concentration able to render ∼80% of maximal detection in standard binding assays was used for each coating molecule. Different concentrations of the indicated competitors were adjusted to a final volume of 20 μl in PBS and added to the plate. The percentage of inhibition (mean value for triplicate wells) was calculated taking as 0% the mean value recorded for the biotin-labeled protein added with 20 μl of PBS, and the Ki was calculated as the concentration required to achieve 50% inhibition under these conditions. The relative binding affinity of each competitor (X) was calculated as the Ki of the coating antigen itself when added to the fluid phase/Ki(X). Each experiment was performed at least three times, with similar results. Gel Shift Mobility Assays—Rabbit aldolase A (2 μg) and the indicated peptide (20 μg) were co-incubated in a final volume of 10 μl. After 30 min, samples were added with 2 μl of loading buffer 6× (50% glycerol, 0.3 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.05% bromphenol blue) and loaded onto nondenaturing, non-reducing 7.5% acrylamide gels. Gels were run at 30 mA for 1.5 h (running buffer: 191 mm glycine, 24 mm Tris, pH 8.3) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. GST-WASp Pull-down Assays—HeLa cells resuspended at 5 × 106 cells/ml in PBS supplemented with 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) were kept on ice for 30 min and centrifuged 2 times at 14,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant (2.5 mg of protein/ml) was labeled with 0.5 mm EZ-link sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) for 90 min at 4 °C with constant agitation followed by a 30-min “quenching” incubation in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The sample was desalted through a NAP™10 column (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated in RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) and preadsorbed for 1 h with 200 μl of GSH-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in RIPA buffer. Aliquots (300 μl) of the supernatant were incubated for 4 h with 50 μg of the corresponding GST fusion protein previously adsorbed onto 150 μl of GSH-Sepharose. The unbound fractions were collected by centrifugation for 2 min at 500 rpm, and Sepharose beads were washed 5 times in 1 ml of RIPA buffer and stripped at 100 °C in 150 μl of denaturing loading buffer. The unbound (15 μl) and bound (30 μl) fractions were run on SDS-PAGE (4–20% gradient gels, Bio-Rad), transferred to Sequi-Blot™ polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad), and analyzed by Western blotting using HRP-conjugated Neutravidin™ (1:25,000; Pierce). When looking for specific proteins, identical membranes were probed with the indicated antibodies followed by secondary antibodies coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma-Aldrich). These blots were developed using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate p-toluidinium salt and nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich). Blocking of the membranes and antibody dilutions was done in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 5% nonfat milk and 0.1% Tween 20. GST-WASp Affinity Purification and Aldolase Activity Assays—In a similar GST-WASp pull-down experiment performed on a non-biotinylated cell lysate, the GST-WASp-coupled Sepharose beads were subjected to 5 washings in RIPA buffer and then eluted with 200 μlof10mm F1,6P (Sigma-Aldrich) in the same buffer. The sample was extensively dialyzed to remove the F1,6P and assayed for protein concentration using the Micro BCA™ protein assay kit (Pierce). Aldolase activity was recorded on appropriate dilutions of the total lysate and the F1,6P-eluted fraction as described (21Buscaglia C.A. Coppens I. Hol W.G. Nussenzweig V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4947-4957Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Aldolase Pull-down Assays—HeLa or 293T cells were resuspended at 5 × 107 cells/ml in RIPA buffer, kept on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged 2 times at 14,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant (250 μl) was preadsorbed for1hwith200 μl of NHS-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in RIPA buffer and centrifuged for 2 min at 500 rpm. The supernatant (200 μl) was further incubated for 4 h with 150 μ1 of NHS-activated Sepharose coupled to rabbit aldolase A (∼6 mg of protein/ml Sepharose beads) following the manufacturer's guidelines. In a parallel experiment, 50 μl of the supernatant were incubated with 50 μl of the same aldolase-coupled Sepharose beads but in the presence of 15 μl (0.3 mg/ml) of GST-TRAP to be used as the positive control. In both cases the unbound fractions were collected, and Sepharose beads were washed 5 times in 1 ml of RIPA buffer and stripped at 100 °C in 200 and 40 μl of denaturing loading buffer. The unbound and bound fractions were run on SDS-PAGE (4–20% gradient gels), transferred to Sequi-Blot™ polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and analyzed by Western blotting using HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) and the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Aldolase Immunoprecipitation Assays—HeLa cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then stimulated for the indicated time periods with 100 ng/ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF; Sigma-Aldrich) (27Otsuki M. Itoh T. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6461-6469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, mechanically detached, and resuspended in ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40). The cleavable cross-linking reagent dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (Pierce) was added to the lysates (0.25 mm) for 30 min to stabilize the protein complexes and then quenched with 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm, supernatants were preadsorbed for 45 min with protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Pierce) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μg of the indicated antibody and 25 μl of fresh protein G-Sepharose beads. After extensive washings, aliquots of the unbound and bound fractions were probed by Western blotting. Mapping of the Aldolase-binding Site on TRAP—In a previous paper we showed that the last ∼25 residues of the cytoplasmic tail of TRAP family proteins are sufficient to promote its binding to aldolase (21Buscaglia C.A. Coppens I. Hol W.G. Nussenzweig V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4947-4957Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To further pinpoint the relevant residues into the aldolase binding region in TRAP, we generated a broad panel of molecules bearing different mutations/deletions throughout this motif. The variants were expressed as GST fusion molecules, purified and tested for Plasmodium aldolase binding by competitive ELISA. Exchange of the sub-terminal Trp25 to Ala led to a complete inhibition of the binding (Table 1), as previously demonstrated (21Buscaglia C.A. Coppens I. Hol W.G. Nussenzweig V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4947-4957Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 22Jewett T.J. Sibley L.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 885-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Notably, Trp25 replacement by structurally related residues such as Phe, Tyr, or His still caused a dramatic decrease in the aldolase affinity. In fact, only the mutant molecules containing either Phe or Tyr were able to compete with the parental molecule, although their relative affinity was decreased by ≥50-fold. On the other hand, the apparent aldolase affinity of TRAP molecules in which several acidic residues were exchanged to Ala (GST-TRAPΔacid2 and GST-TRAPΔacid3 molecules) was reduced by ∼9 and ∼5-fold, respectively, when compared with the parental molecule. The effect of altering either of these acidic patches, however, was not as drastic as mutating the row of acidic residues adjacent to Trp25(GST-TRAPΔacid1 protein). Therefore, multiple TRAP tail acidic residues mediate the binding to aldolase, although their relative contribution is hierarchical toward the Trp25. Finally, mutations in non-acidic residues were analyzed. Substitution of the Phe17 residue alone (GST-TRAP-F17A protein) or in combination with Leu19 (GST-TRAP-FL/SS protein) did not affect the affinity for aldolase. Similar results were obtained with mutant molecules in which two slightly hydrophobic stretches of residues (GST-TRAPΔhydroph1 and GST-TRAPΔhydroph2 proteins) were deleted. Jointly, these data indicate that the aldolase binding properties in the TRAP tail rely only in the sub-terminal Trp and the acidic residues.TABLE 1Binding of GST-TRAP mutant molecules to aldolaseProteinModificationRelative bindingaKi of the parental molecule/ Ki of the indicated molecule.GST-TRAPbParental molecule (sequence 1EDVMADDEKGIVENEQFKLPEDNDWN26).1GST-TRAP-W25ATrp25 to Ala<0.01cKi significantly different (p < 0.01) from that of the parental molecule.GST-TRAP-W25HTrp25 to His<0.01cKi significantly different (p < 0.01) from that of the parental molecule.GST-TRAP-W25YTrp25 to Tyr0.01cKi significantly different (p < 0.01) from that of the parental molecule.GST-TRAP-W25FTrp25 to Phe0.02cKi significantly different (p < 0.01) from that of the parental molecule.GST-TRAPΔacid1EDND24 to AGNA24<0.01cKi significantly different (p < 0.01) from that of the parental molecule.GST-TRAPΔacid2ENE15 to ANA150.12cKi significantly different (p < 0.01) from that of the parental molecule.GST-TRAPΔacid3DDE8 to AAA80.22cKi significantly different (p < 0.01) from that of the parental molecule.GST-TRAP-F17APhe17 to Ala0.96GST-TRAP-FL/SSFKL19 to SKS190.92GST-TRAPΔhydroph1QFKLP20 deletion1.13GST-TRAPΔhydroph2KGIV12 deletion1.05a Ki of the parental molecule/ Ki of the indicated molecule.b Parental molecule (sequence 1EDVMADDEKGIVENEQFKLPEDNDWN26).c Ki significantly different (p < 0.01) from that of the parental molecule. Open table in a new tab Identification of Novel Aldolase Binders—The simpler than expected aldolase binding motif revealed above prompted us to look for homologous sequences in the databases. For searching purposes, we used variations of peptides containing at least one Trp and eight acidic residues (either Asp or Glu) (see the details in the footnote to Supplemental Table 1). We found matches in a variety of transcription factors, importins, Bloom syndrome protein, zinc finger proteins, ubiquitin-modifying enzymes, translation initiation factors, and cortactin, some of which might indeed constitute novel aldolase binders (Supplemental Table 1). Several retrieved matches were found in the C terminus of different members of the WASp family, including WASp, N-WASp, WASp family member 1 (WAVE-1), WAVE-2, and WAVE-3. To get a first glimpse on the predictive value of our proposed aldolase binding motif, immobilized rabbit aldolase was incubated with a total cell lysate. The fraction containing the specifically retained proteins was analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies directed toward some of the predicted aldolase binders. As positive control, a sample of the lysate was supplemented with GST-TRAP before incubation with the immobilized aldolase. As shown in Fig. 1, cortactin, N-WASp, and Bloom syndrome protein partially interacted with the immobilized aldolase, whereas negative control proteins lacking the Trp-containing, acidic motif (Rho guanine nucleotide-disassociation inhibitor, cytochrome P450 reductase) were exclusively found in the unbound fraction. Aldolase Binding Properties of the WASp Family—As mentioned above, several retrieved matches were found in members of the WASp family. These are multimodular molecules (Fig. 2A) that function in the regulation of actin dynamics through their concerted binding to actin, different subunits of the Arp2/3 complex, and regulatory molecules (for review, see Ref. 28Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 649-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). We decided to focus on these molecules as they, as TRAP, are involved in cell motility, and even more notably, their interaction with the Arp2/3 complex involves the Trp-containing, acidic motif (28Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 649-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). We chose the human WASp C terminus as representative for the whole group to analyze its aldolase binding properties in vitro. Even though a GST fusion protein spanning the full-length WASp was unable to bind to aldolase, a fusion molecule solely containing the region responsible for the activation of the Arp2/3 complex (termed VCA for verprolin-like, central C-terminal and acidic regions) bound to rabbit aldolase, and this interaction was absolutely dependent on the presence of the terminal TRAP-like domain (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, a fusion molecule solely bearing the terminal A domain (termed GST-WASp) and a synthetic peptide spanning the same sequence bound to aldolase in a dose-dependent fashion as shown by ELISA (Figs. 2, A and B) and gel shift mobility assays (Fig. 2C). The binding of the WASp A domain to aldolase showed the same profile of inhibition mediated by the enzyme substrate/products and other competitive inhibitors of aldolase catalysis than that described for TRAP (Fig. 2D and Ref. 21Buscaglia C.A. Coppens I. Hol W.G. Nussenzweig V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4947-4957Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Finally, and in keeping with our findings in TRAP (Table 1), replacement of the Trp13 in WASp by Phe or Tyr drastically impaired its binding to aldolase (Fig. 2E). The specificity of the binding of the WASp motif to aldolase was further studied by pull-down assays. Immobilized GST-WASp or GST-WASp-W13F molecules (see Fig. 2E) were incubated with a biotin-labeled cell lysate, and specifically retained proteins were revealed by HRP-conjugated Neutravidin (Fig. 3, upper panel). Only a few bands were differentially retained in the GST-WASp-coupled Sepharose beads, the major being an ∼40-kDa protein identified as aldolase by Western blotting (Fig. 3, lower panel). In a similar experiment, the GST-WASp-coupled Sepharose beads were eluted with 10 mm F1,6P, and the degree of aldolase purification was calculated by measuring both protein concentration and enzymatic activity on the total lysate and the F1,6P-eluted fraction. Although the recovery of aldolase activity on the latter fraction was about 49% of the total input activity, the enzyme was purified by 904-fold (as a result of 1846-fold reduction in the total protein content). The GST-WASp-coupled Sepharose beads, but not those GST-WASp-W13F-coupled, did also retain p34, one of the subunits of the Arp2/3 complex, which is the primary target of the WASp acidic tail in vivo (28Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 649-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Actin, however, was only detected in the unbound fraction, indicating that even in these conditions aldolase interacted with the GST-WASp itself and not indirectly with actin filaments attached to this molecule"

DNA amplification of Bcl10 was also found in other solid tumors. We have recently shown that nuclear translocation of Bcl10 is a specific molecular determinant of Helicobacter pylori-independent mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (Kuo, S.-H., Chen, L. T., Yeh, K.-H., Wu, M. S., Hsu, H. C., Yeh, P. Y., Mao, T. L., Chen, C. L., Doong, S. L., Lin, J. T., and Cheng, A.-L. (2004) J. Clin. Oncol. 22, 3491–3497). However, the molecular mechanism of Bcl10 nuclear translocation remains unknown. In this study, we observed that tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) up-regulates the expression of Bcl10 and induces a fraction of Bcl10 nuclear translocation in human breast carcinoma MCF7 cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that an NF-κB-binding site resides in the Bcl10 5 ′-untranslated region. This study also demonstrates that Akt1, activated by TNFα, phosphorylates Bcl10 at Ser218 and Ser231 and that phosphorylated Bcl10 subsequently complexes with Bcl3 to enter the nucleus. Either inhibition of Akt1 or depletion of Bcl3 blocks Bcl10 nuclear translocation. In summary, these findings characterize a molecular linkage that directs Bcl10 nuclear translocation in response to TNFα treatment.

Although it is well established that NF-κB is primarily regulated by its subcellular distribution, compelling data indicate that NF-κB is subjected to multilevel regulation. For example, modification of NF-κB (particularly phosphorylation and acetylation) may serve as another important mechanism to modulate the strength and duration of transactivating activity by altering the interaction between NF-κB and transcriptional coactivators (14Webster G.A. Perkins N.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3485-3495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol.

In addition, rapidly accumulating data indicate that many distinct factors may indirectly regulate NF-κB activity by acting on components of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Akt (also named protein kinase B) is a Ser/Thr kinase believed to transduce a survival signal via targeting various proteins, including NF-κB (reviewed in Ref. 17Nicholson K.M. Anderson N.G. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 381-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). The pathway by which Akt activates the NF-κB upstream IκB kinase (via phosphorylation of IκB kinase at Thr23) has been identified (18Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of Akt activity is associated with different types of tumors such as ovarian, prostate, pancreatic, gastric, and breast cancers (reviewed in Refs. 19Brazil D.P.

Bcl3 is a nuclear protein and is not degraded in the cellular response to extracellular signals. Unlike other members of the IκB family, Bcl3 was found to enhance NF-κB activity, primarily via forming a complex with the NF-κB p50 homodimer to block the latter's mediated suppression of target gene expression (22Mitchell T.C.

Oncol. 2004; 22: 3491-3497Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), indicating that a close association exists between Bcl10 and NF-κB and that nuclear translocation of Bcl10 is an important molecular event of this tumor. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this scenario remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) increases Bcl10 expression via the NF-κB signal transduction pathway. We also show that Akt1 activated by TNFα subsequently interacts with and phosphorylates Bcl10, leading to the formation of a Bcl10·Bcl3 complex that translocates into the nucleus. Cell Culture, Antibodies, and Chemicals—Human breast carcinoma MCF7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagles' medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and incubated in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The antibodies used in this study were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-Akt1 antibody was obtained from Pharmingen. TNFα was purchased from Calbiochem, and other chemicals were purchased from Calbiochem or Sigma. Plasmid Construction, Site-directed Mutagenesis, and Gene Transfection—The full-length Bcl10 gene was amplified from MCF7 random-primed cDNA according to the sequence information deposited in the GenBank™ Data Bank (accession number NM_003921). The purified PCR product (either sense or antisense direction) was cloned into the bicistronic expression vector pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech) or was cloned in-frame into the pRSET vector (a His6-tagged Escherichia coli expression vector; Invitrogen). The antisense Bcl3 plasmid was constructed by amplifying a 524-bp fragment (positions 273–797) of the Bcl3 gene and cloning into the pCMV vector (Stratagene) in the reverse direction as described previously (25Brasier A.R. Lu M. Hai T. Lu Y. Boldogh I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32080-32093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The Bcl10 C-terminal 27-amino acid deletion mutant was constructed by digesting the Bcl10 gene with BglII and cloning into the pRSET vector. Substitution of Ser218 and/or Ser231 with Ala or Asp in Bcl10 by site-directed mutagenesis was performed by a two-round PCR method as described previously (26Yeh P.Y. Chuang S.-E. Yeh K.-H. Song Y.C. Cheng A.-L. Biochem. Biophy. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and the mutant gene was cloned in-frame into the pRSET vector. All of the constructed genes were verified by DNA sequencing. Dominant-negative IκBα with an N-terminal 72-amino acid deletion and the NF-κB-driven luciferase reporter plasmid have been described previously (27Yeh P.Y. Chuang S.-E. Yeh K.-H. Song Y.C. Ea C.K. Cheng A.-L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 1423-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Gene transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were selected with 500 μg/ml G418 for 20 days. The surviving colonies were pooled and cultured in medium containing 500 μg/ml G418. Immunoblotting, Immunoprecipitation, and Kinase Assay—Whole cell lysates and cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were prepared as described previously (27Yeh P.Y. Chuang S.-E. Yeh K.-H. Song Y.C. Ea C.K. Cheng A.-L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 1423-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Aliquots (15 μg) of lysates were subjected to immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (26Yeh P.Y. Chuang S.-E. Yeh K.-H. Song Y.C. Cheng A.-L. Biochem. Biophy. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, target proteins were immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates and cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions (300 μg), as indicated, by 2 μg of the corresponding antibody overnight at 4 °C, followed by protein A/G-agarose adsorption (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The washed complex was subjected to Western blotting or kinase assay. For nickel-agarose pull-down kinase assay, E. coli-expressed His-tagged wild-type or mutant Bcl10 protein was adsorbed to nickel-agarose (Clontech) in native binding buffer (25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The nickel-agarose·Bcl10 complexes were mixed with lysates prepared from cells with various treatments at 4 °C for 2 h. The precipitated complex was washed twice with native binding buffer and once with kinase buffer (40 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm MgCl2). The complex was incubated with kinase buffer containing 5 μCi of [32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. For in-gel kinase assay, the nickel-agarose·Bcl10 pull-down complex was subjected to SDS-PAGE with or without wild-type Bcl10 embedded in the gel. Following renaturing of the gel, in-gel kinase assay was performed by immersion of the gel in kinase buffer containing 5 μCi of [32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. The images were visualized by exposure to x-ray film. NF-κB p65 Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assay was performed according to a protocol available at www.upstate.com with slight modification. Following TNFα treatment, the protein·DNA complex was cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were lysed in SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0)). The bulk DNA was sonicated to generate an average fragment size of ∼1 kb. The lysates were at least 10-fold diluted with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitors. After one round of protein A/G-agarose preclearing, the NF-κB p65·DNA complex was precipitated with 2 μg of anti-NF-κB p65 antibody and protein A/G-agarose. The complex was eluted with 1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3, and the cross-link was reversed by adjusting NaCl to 200 mm and incubating at 65 °C for 4 h. DNA was purified and used for PCR. The primer set used to amplify the putative NF-κB p65-binding sites in the Bcl10 or IκBα gene is shown in supplemental Fig. 1. PCR amplification of 18 S rDNA was used to determine the amount of DNA input. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) and NF-κB-driven Luciferase Activity Assay—The activation of NF-κB was determined by EMSA as described previously (27Yeh P.Y. Chuang S.-E. Yeh K.-H. Song Y.C. Ea C.K. Cheng A.-L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 1423-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The oligodeoxynucleotide probe derived from immunoglobulin (5′-GGATTGGGACTTTCCCCTCC), Bcl10 (5′-GCCCAGGGCTCTACCTGAG), or IκBα (5′-GGCTGCAGGGAAGTACCGGG) genomic sequence was 32P-labeled and incubated with 10 μg of nuclear extract at room temperature for 30 min, and the electrophoretic mobility of the probe was then analyzed on 6% native polyacrylamide gel. The NF-κB·DNA complex was visualized by autoradiography. The identity and specificity of the NF-κB·DNA complex were determined by adding a selective antibody and an unlabeled mutated oligodeoxynucleotide probe (5′-GCCCAGCCCTCTACCTGAG). NF-κB-driven luciferase activity assay was performed using a luciferase reporter gene assay kit (LucLite, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Up-regulation of Bcl10 by TNFα-induced NF-κB Activation—TNFα (a strong NF-κB inducer in various types of cells) was used to activate NF-κB in this study. As evidenced by EMSA, TNFα activated NF-κBin MCF7 cells (Fig. 1). The NF-κB DNA-binding activity was quickly induced within 15 min of TNFα treatment and then returned to the basal level after 60 min of treatment. In a parallel experiment, the protein levels of Bcl10 and IκBα induced by TNFα in MCF7 cells were determined by Western blotting (Fig. 2). TNFα constitutively increased Bcl10 protein; in contrast, IκBα was degraded at 15 min after treatment and gradually returned to the basal level thereafter.FIGURE 2TNFα increases Bcl10, but induces IκBα degradation. MCF7 cells were treated with 10 ng/ml TNFα for the indicated times. Whole cell lysates (15 μg) were subjected to immunoblotting (IB) to determine the protein levels of Bcl10 and IκBα. Detection of actin served as a loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because NF-κB is a transcription factor involved in the expression of numerous genes, it is reasonable to consider whether Bcl10 is a downstream gene of NF-κB. To explore this possibility, NF-κB ChIP was performed. The binding of NF-κB to the IκBα gene upstream region was characterized in parallel and served as a control. According to the NF-κB consensus binding sequence, GGGRNYYCC (28Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 16: 225-260Crossref Scopus (4605) Google Scholar), and the sequence information deposited in the GenBank™ Data Bank (accession number NM_003921 for Bcl10, accession number AL133163 for IκBα genomic sequence, and accession number BC004983 for IκBα mRNA sequence), a Bcl10 5′-untranslated region was expected to be an NF-κB-binding site. The region in the IκBα genome for NF-κB targeting has been mapped previously (29Cheng Q. Cant C.A. Moll T. Hofer-Warbinek R. Wagner E. Birnstiel M.L. Bach F.H. de Martin R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13551-13557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The relevant sequence information regarding the genomic regions of Bcl10 and IκBα for NF-κB binding is shown in supplemental Fig. 1. The results of p65 ChIP assay indicated that TNFα induced a strong but shorter binding of p65 to the Bcl10 genomic fragment; in contrast, p65 bound to the IκBα genomic fragment for a longer period (Fig. 3A). EMSA was used to demonstrate that the core sequence (gcccagggctctacctgtag) residing in the 5′-upstream region (positions –270 to –250) of the Bcl10 gene was responsible for NF-κB binding. The binding of NF-κB to the κB site of IκBα was also verified (Fig. 3B). The specificity of NF-κB binding to this κB site of Bcl10 was further confirmed by competition assays with excess unlabeled wild-type or mutated oligodeoxynucleotide probe. As shown in Fig. 3C, excess wild-type probe decreased both the NF-κB·DNA complex and a nonspecific binding complex, whereas the mutated probe decreased the nonspecific binding complex only and had no effect on the NF-κB·DNA complex. To characterize whether this putative κB site of Bcl10 functions as a cis-acting element, the DNA fragments amplified from ChIP experiments (from the Bcl10 or IκBα gene) were cloned into a pLuc reporter plasmid (Stratagene), yielding pBcl10-Luc and pIκB-Luc, respectively. The reporter plasmid pBcl10-Luc was transfected alone or with a dominant-negative IκBα expression vector into MCF7 cells, and then TNFα-induced luciferase activity was assayed in these cells. As shown in Fig. 3D, although TNFα induced luciferase activity in pBcl10-Luc-transfected cells, dominant-negative IκBα suppressed basal as well as TNFα-induced luciferase activities. Similar results were obtained with pIκB-Luc-transfected cells. Furthermore, reverse transcription-PCR showed that TNFα induced a marked increase in the RNA level of Bcl10 at 15 min after treatment. In contrast, TNFα induced a later but more persistent increase in IκBα RNA (Fig. 3E). The function of NF-κB in Bcl10 expression was further characterized in dominant-negative IκBα-transfected MCF7 cells (referred to as MCF/DN cells), in which TNFα-induced NF-κB activity was markedly reduced (data not shown). As expected, up-regulation of Bcl10 by TNFα was suppressed in MCF/DN cells (Fig. 3F). TNFα Induces Bcl10 Nuclear Translocation—We next investigated whether TNFα induces Bcl10 nuclear translocation in MCF7 cells. As shown in Fig. 4, a sustained increase in nuclear Bcl10 was observed along the time course of TNFα treatment. The typically dynamic change in nuclear NF-κB p65 induced by TNFα was characterized in parallel and served as a control. Akt1 Phosphorylates the Bcl10 C-terminal Ser218 and Ser231 Residues—To explore the possible mechanism of Bcl10 nuclear translocation, we first investigated whether TNFα induces Bcl10 phosphorylation. Using Bcl10-co-immunoprecipitated complex kinase assay, we found that Bcl10 was phosphorylated after TNFα treatment and also observed that several phosphorylated proteins coprecipitated with Bcl10. The molecular mass of one of them was close to that of Akt1 kinase (data not shown). Further studies indicated that TNFα induced Akt1 activation in MCF7 cells (Fig. 5A). Whether Akt1 was responsible for Bcl10 phosphorylation after TNFα treatment was therefore explored. The possible interaction between Bcl10 and Akt1 was identified by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation, followed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 5B, following TNFα treatment, an increased amount of Bcl10 was associated with Akt1. Similarly, Akt1 was also detectable in the Bcl10-immunoprecipitated complex. Next, we sought to identify the possible phosphorylation sites of Bcl10 for Akt1. A previous study reported that Bcl10 with a truncated C terminus shows nuclear distribution in NK/T cells (30Shen L. Liang A.C. Au W.Y. Lu L. Chen Y.W. Wong K.Y. Tang J.C. Chan K.W. Beh S.L. Kwong Y.L. Liang R.H. Srivastava G. Leukemia (Basingstoke). 2003; 17: 2240-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), suggesting the Bcl10 C-terminal as a candidate region for Akt1 targeting. To investigate this speculation, wild-type and mutant Bcl10 proteins harboring the C-terminal 27-amino acid deletion were constructed and cloned into a His-tagged expression vector. Nickel-agarose·Bcl10 pull-down experiments were performed to identify the interaction of Bcl10 with Akt1. As shown in Fig. 6A, the Bcl10 C-terminal 27-amino acid deletion mutant could not bind to Akt1. To identify the phosphorylation sites of Bcl10 for Akt1, phosphorylation site analysis of this 27-amino acid peptide was performed using NetPhos Version 2.0 (developed by the Technical University of Denmark, available at www.cbs.dtu.dk). Two Ser residues (Ser218 and Ser231) were predicted to be the most probable sites for phosphorylation (data not shown). The mutant Bcl10 gene with these two Ser residues substituted with Ala, either alone or together, was therefore constructed in the His6-tagged pRSET vector. E. coli-expressed wild-type or mutant proteins were used as exogenous substrates in Akt1-immunoprecipitated complex kinase assay. The results indicate that Akt1 could not phosphorylate Bcl10 with the Ser218/Ser231 double mutation (Fig. 6B). On the other hand, nickel-agarose·Bcl10 pull-down kinase assay showed a similar level of Bcl10 phosphorylation regardless of whether wild-type or mutant proteins were used (Fig. 6C), suggesting that Bcl10 is subjected to multiple phosphorylation and that Akt1 is not the only kinase targeting Bcl10. Autophosphorylation of Akt1 has been reported previously (31Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8271-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) and further confirmed by in-gel kinase assay in this study. As shown in Fig. 6D, the wild-type or mutant Bcl10 pull-down complex was subjected to in-gel kinase assay with or without wild-type Bcl10 embedded in the gel, and an autophosphorylated protein with a molecular mass corresponding to that of Akt1 was observed in all pull-down complexes. Ser218- and Ser231-phosphorylated Bcl10 Complexes with Bcl3 to Enter the Nucleus—The function of Akt1 in Bcl10 nuclear translocation was further characterized by applying the Akt1 inhibitor LY294002 to suppress TNFα-induced Akt1 activity. As shown in Fig. 7A, LY294002 pretreatment blocked TNFα-induced Bcl10 nuclear translocation, suggesting that Akt1 activity is necessary for Bcl10 nuclear translocation. Close examination of the molecular features of Bcl10 suggested that it does not have a nuclear localization signal (data not shown). Thus, the association of Bcl10 with an uncertain nuclear protein might be necessary for its nuclear translocation. To search for the possible nuclear protein involved in Bcl10 nuclear translocation, Bcl3 (a unique IκB family protein) was selected for further studies. This was based on several previous findings, including the upregulation of Bcl3 by NF-κB and the involvement of Bcl3 in NF-κB downstream gene expression (32Westerheide S.D. Mayo M.W. Anest V. Hanson J.L. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8428-8436Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 33Ge B. Li O. Wilder P. Rizzino A. McKeithan T.W. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 4210-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In particular, expression of Bcl3 is associated with cytokine-independent growth of lymphocytes (34Rebollo A. Dumoutier L. Renauld J.C. Zaballos A. Ayllon V. Martinez-A C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3407-3416Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and hormone independence of breast carcinoma (35Pratt M.A. Bishop T.E. White D. Yasvinski G. Menard M. Niu M.Y. Clarke R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6887-6900Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These findings for Bcl3 are very similar to our previous observations for Bcl10. We first characterized whether TNFα induces Bcl3 nuclear translocation. As shown in Fig. 7B, nuclear translocation of Bcl3 was induced by TNFα and was suppressed by pretreatment with LY294002. Whether Bcl3 is involved in Bcl10 nuclear translocation was first investigated by Western blotting of the Bcl3-co-immunoprecipitated complex from whole cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 7C, increased Bcl10 was associated with Bcl3 after TNFα treatment, and this interaction was interrupted by LY294002 pretreatment. Next, reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation, followed by Western blotting, demonstrated that the Bcl10·Bcl3 complex existed in the nucleus after TNFα treatment. TNFα induces marked NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation. Therefore, the possible interaction between Bcl10 and NF-κB p65 after TNFα treatment was also examined. No Bcl10·NF-κB p65 complex could be detected by reciprocal immunoprecipitation and Western blotting (Fig. 7D), suggesting that Bcl10 specifically interacts with Bcl3. In addition, Bcl10 and Bcl3 were found to colocalize in the TNFα-treated cells by double immunofluorescence staining (data not shown). To further confirm that phosphorylation of Bcl10 at Ser218 and Ser231 is necessary for the formation of the Bcl10·Bcl3 complex, these two residues were mutated to aspartic acid, either alone or together, to mimic their phosphorylation. Wild-type and mutant proteins were used in pull-down experiments. As shown in Fig. 7E, Bcl10 with the Ser218/Ser231 double mutation or with the C-terminal deletion exhibited high affinity for Bcl3. The latter finding might support the previous observation that C-terminally truncated Bcl10 exhibits nuclear distribution (30Shen L. Liang A.C. Au W.Y. Lu L. Chen Y.W. Wong K.Y. Tang J.C. Chan K.W. Beh S.L. Kwong Y.L. Liang R.H. Srivastava G. Leukemia (Basingstoke). 2003; 17: 2240-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The role of Bcl3 in Bcl10 nuclear translocation was further demonstrated using the antisense Bcl3 gene. Transfection of antisense Bcl3 effectively inhibited Bcl3 expression of MCF7 cells (Fig. 8A) and blocked TNFα-induced Bcl10 nuclear translocation (Fig. 8B). Bcl10 Is Involved in TNFα-induced NF-κB Transcriptional Activity—We previously reported that nuclear expression of Bcl10 and NF-κB is a tightly associated phenomenon in H. pylori-independent MALT lymphoma (24Kuo S.-H. Chen L.T. Yeh K.-H. Wu M.S. Hsu H.C. Yeh P.Y. Mao T.L. Chen C.L. Doong S.L. Lin J.T. Cheng A.-L. J. Clin. Oncol. 2004; 22: 3491-3497Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We also found that myc, an NF-κB downstream gene, is overexpressed in these MALT lymphomas. 3S.-H. Kuo and A.-L. Cheng, unpublished data. To explore the possibility that Bcl10 might be involved in the NF-κB downstream signaling pathway, MCF/AsBcl10 cells were established by transfection of the antisense Bcl10 gene into MCF7 cells, in which expression of Bcl10 is blocked (Fig. 9A). TNFα-induced myc expression in cells with different treatments was determined by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 9B, LY294002 pretreatment inhibited TNFα-induced myc expression. The Myc protein level in antisense Bcl3-, antisense B"

Mice with Lkb1+/− mutation develop gastric hamartomas after >20 weeks of age, and hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas >30 weeks. It has been reported that, in PJS patients, carcinomas progressed from hamartomas contain p53 mutations, and that LKB1 regulates p53-dependent apoptosis. To investigate the roles of LKB1 and p53 mutations in tumorigenesis, we constructed compound mutant mice of Lkb1 and p53 genes. In the Lkb1+/−p53−/− mice, formation of gastric hamartomas and hepatic tumors was accelerated. However, histopathology of hamartomas was similar between Lkb1+/−p53−/− and Lkb1+/− mice, and Lkb1 genotype remained heterozygous, suggesting that the p53 mutation affected hamartoma initiation. Contrary to the heterozygous hamartomas in the stomach and duodenum, the hepatic adenomas in Lkb1+/−p53−/− mice showed loss of Lkb1 heterozygosity (LOH), suggesting that lack of p53 stimulated Lkb1 LOH and tumor initiation in the liver. Taken together, these results indicate that lack of p53 causes earlier onsets of gastric hamartomas and hepatic tumors in Lkb1+/−p53−/− mice."
https://openalex.org/W2104395715,"Excitatory stimuli are known to be a potent regulator for induction of neuronal differentiation. Calbindin-D28K buffers intracellular Ca2+ and modifies synaptic functions in neurons. However, the effects of calbindin-D28K on the regulation of activity-induced neuronal differentiation and related biochemical modifications remain unsolved. In the present study, by a gain-of-function study with retroviral vector system and dicer-generated small interfering RNA (d-siRNA) to effectively knock down the expression of calbindin-D28K, we demonstrated that calbindin-D28K at a physiologically relevant level promoted neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth. Increase of neuronal differentiation by calbindin-D28K overexpression was concurrent with the expression of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcriptional factors, phosphorylation of calcium and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and NeuroD at Ser(336). KN-62, a highly specific CaMKII inhibitor, blocked the up-regulation of proneural bHLH genes, p-CaMKII, and pSer(336)NeuroD. Calbindin-D28K appeared to facilitate neuronal differentiation of both fetal and adult hippocampal progenitor cells. Together, these findings establish the novel calbindin-regulated function of CaMKII and NeuroD in control of neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth."
https://openalex.org/W2011399119,"In the bacterial periplasm the co-existence of a catalyst of disulfide bond formation (DsbA) that is maintained in an oxidized state and of a reduced enzyme that catalyzes the rearrangement of mispaired cysteine residues (DsbC) is important for the folding of proteins containing multiple disulfide bonds. The kinetic partitioning of the DsbA/DsbB and DsbC/DsbD pathways partly depends on the ability of DsbB to oxidize DsbA at rates >1000 times greater than DsbC. We show that the resistance of DsbC to oxidation by DsbB is abolished by deletions of one or more amino acids within the α-helix that connects the N-terminal dimerization domain with the C-terminal thioredoxin domain. As a result, mutant DsbC carrying α-helix deletions could catalyze disulfide bond formation and complemented the phenotypes of dsbA cells. Examination of DsbC homologues from Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Erwinia chrysanthemi, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Vibrio cholerae (30-70% sequence identity with the Escherichia coli enzyme) revealed that the mechanism responsible for avoiding oxidation by DsbB is a general property of DsbC family enzymes. In addition we found that deletions in the linker region reduced, but did not abolish, the ability of DsbC to assist the formation of active vtPA and phytase in vivo, in a DsbD-dependent manner, revealing that interactions between DsbD and DsbC are also conserved.

Disulfide bonds formation is a critical step in protein folding. By covalently cross-linking amino acids far apart in the protein primary structure, the formation of native disulfides is associated with the increased stability and structural complexity typical of many secreted proteins. In bacterial cells disulfide bond formation occurs in the periplasmic space. The soluble enzyme DsbA 3The abbreviations used are: Dsb, disulfide bond protein; tPA, tissue plasminogen activator. is maintained in an oxidized state by the membrane protein DsbB, and catalyzes the rapid, but rather indiscriminate oxidation of cysteines in substrate proteins. DsbB recycles DsbA by transferring electrons to molecular oxygen or other electron acceptors through quinones and the membrane enzymes of the respiratory chain. Non-correctly paired cysteines are rearranged by the soluble enzyme DsbC, which is maintained in a reduced state by the membrane protein DsbD, which transfers electrons from thioredoxin in the cytoplasm to DsbC in the periplasm (1Nakamoto H. Bardwell J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 2Kadokura H. Katzen F. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev.

The DsbA-DsbB and DsbC-DsbD systems transfer electrons in opposite directions, i.e. from and into the periplasm, respectively. The presence of cross-talk between the oxidation and isomerization pathways would be expected to result in a wasteful, futile cycle that would be detrimental for the cell. For this reason, large kinetic barriers must have evolved to prevent non-physiological interactions between the Dsb enzymes; therefore, allowing the co-existence of the two pathways in the same cellular environment (4Rozhkova A.

The structural features of DsbC that prevent its misoxidation by DsbB are not well understood. The catalytic domains of DsbC and DsbA are structurally similar, and they are both thioredoxin motif proteins (1Nakamoto H. Bardwell J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, whereas DsbA is a monomer, DsbC is a homodimer with each subunit comprising the catalytic thioredoxin domain connected via a long α-helical linker to a domain responsible for dimerization and substrate binding (5McCarthy A.A.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1555-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) suggested that the dimerization of the thioredoxin domains is responsible for preventing oxidation by DsbB. Recently we constructed a series of chimeric proteins comprising the DsbC dimerization domain linked to either TrxA or to DsbA. Several of these chimeras catalyzed disulfide isomerization and oxidation in vivo, suggesting that dimerization of thioredoxin domains is not sufficient to confer protection from the action of DsbB (7Segatori L. Paukstelis P.J. Gilbert H.F. Georgiou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10018-10023Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Comparison of the structure of the Escherichia coli DsbC with that of its homologue DsbG suggests that the α-linker that connects the dimerization and the catalytic domains may play a role in determining the specificity of the enzyme for substrate proteins (8Heras B. Edeling M.A. Schirra H.J. Raina S. Martin J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8876-8881Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in DsbG as well as in the DsbCs from both E. coli and Haemophilus influenza (9Zhang M. Monzingo A.F. Segatori L. Georgiou G. Robertus J.D. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1512-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the α-helical linker serves to place the CXXC active sites within the two thioredoxin domains directly facing each other, indicating that this is a conserved feature of bacterial disulfide isomerase enzymes. These observations, together with our data using DsbC chimeras (7Segatori L. Paukstelis P.J. Gilbert H.F. Georgiou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10018-10023Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), suggested that the α-helical linker may play a pivotal role in the function of DsbC enzymes. Here we show that deletions in the α-helical linker abolish the ability of DsbC to avoid oxidation by DsbB and that this phenomenon is conserved among members of this enzyme family. However, the DsbC mutant enzymes retained the ability to catalyze the rearrangement of disulfide bonds in substrate proteins expressed in the E. coli periplasm, indicating that the reduction of the enzyme by DsbD is not compromised by the deletions. Strains and Plasmids—The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. The putative dsbC from H. influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio cholerae, Erwinia chrysanthemi, and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis were amplified from the chromosome of respective bacterial cells and cloned into pBAD33 (10Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3960) Google Scholar). The α-helix deletion constructs of DsbC from E. coli, H. influenzae, and Y. pseudotuberculosis were created by overlap extension PCR and cloned into pBAD33. All the constructs contain a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. For protein purification purposes, the putative dsbC genes and DsbC deletion constructs were digested with XbaI and HindIII, ligated into pET28(a), and transformed into E. coli BL21 cells.TABLE 1Strains and plasmidsStrains and plasmidsRelevant genotypeReferenceDH5αF-(f80dlacZ-M15)-(lacIZYA-argF) U169 deoR recA1 endA1 hsdR17(rk–,mk+) supE44, thi-1 gyrA96, relA1Laboratory CollectionDHB4araD139 (araA-leu)7679 (codB-lac)X74 galE15 galK16 rpsL150 relA1 thi phoA (Pvu II) phoR malF3 F′ [lac+ (lac I) pro]Laboratory CollectionMC1000araD139 (araA-leu)7679 (codB-lac)X74 galE15 galK16 rpsL150 relA1 thi F′ [lac+ (lacI) pro]Ref. 29Calhoun D.H.

Cultures were grown at 30 °C in 15 ml of LB medium with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Cells were diluted 1:100 from overnight cultures, grown to A600 of 0.8, and arabinose was added to a final concentration of 0.2%; 30 min later, vtPA synthesis was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Following growth for three additional hours, 6-ml aliquots were pelleted by centrifugation and stored at -20 °C. The pellets were resuspended in cold phosphate-buffered saline as needed to normalize the number of cells per sample and lysed with a French press. Following the removal of insoluble material by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 10 min at 4 °C), the soluble protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. tPA activities were obtained by first diluting the samples in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) with 0.01% Tween 80 to a final protein concentration of 0.5 μg/μl. 30 μl of the diluted cell lysates were added to 250 μl of the same buffer containing 0.04 μg of human Glu-type plasminogen (American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT) per μl, and 0.4 mm Spectrozyme PL (American Diagnostica), incubated at 37 °C, and the change in A405 was monitored. Acid phosphatase activities were determined in E. coli MB69 (DHB4 ΔdsbC) (11Berkmen M. Boyd D. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11387-11394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) co-transformed with pBAD33 derivatives encoding the DsbC deletion constructs, and pAppA, a pBAD18 derivative encoding the gene appA (11Berkmen M. Boyd D. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11387-11394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in LB medium, and enzymatic assays were performed as previously described (11Berkmen M. Boyd D. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11387-11394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To study the in vivo oxidase activity of the proteins, E. coli LM106 (MC1000 dsbA::kan5) and LM102 (MC1000 dsbB::kan5) were transformed with the appropriate pBAD33 plasmid derivatives. Overnight cultures were grown in LB medium with 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and diluted 1:100 in low phosphate minimal medium containing MOPS salts, 0.2% glycerol, 0.2% glucose, 0.2% casein amino acids, and 0.5 μg/ml thiamine, with 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol. When the cell density reached A600 = 0.4, arabinose was added to a final concentration of 0.2% w/v. 4 h later, cells were collected and mixed with 0.4 m iodoacetamide and lysis buffer (B-PER™, Pierce) in a 1:2 ratio. The activity of alkaline phosphatase was determined as described previously (12Brickman E. Beckwith J. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 96: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). For cell motility assays, overnight cultures of E. coli LM106 transformed with appropriate pBAD33 plasmids were grown in LB medium and diluted 1:100 in M9 salts, 0.1% casein amino acids, 2 mm MgSO4,5 μg/ml thiamine, 0.2% glycerol, with 50 μg/ml kanamycin, and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol, as needed. After 4 h of growth, 3-μl aliquots, normalized to the same optical density, were spotted on the center of plates containing the same media with 0.3% agar, and 0.2% w/v arabinose, and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Expression, Purification, and Biochemical Assays—For the purification of the E. coli and homologous DsbCs, or the α-helix deletion mutants, the appropriate genes were cloned behind the T7 promoter in pET28(a), and the resulting plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). Protein expression and purification was performed as previously described (7Segatori L. Paukstelis P.J. Gilbert H.F. Georgiou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10018-10023Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). All proteins used in this study were >95% pure as judged by Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels. DsbB was purified as previously described (13Bader M. Muse W. Ballou D.P. Gassner C. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 14Bader M. Muse W. Zander T. Bardwell J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10302-10307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), with the exception that a HiTrap Chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences) charged with nickel was used in place of a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The final purity of the DsbB preparation was >95%. For the purification of DsbA, E. coli HK317 (15Kadokura H. Tian H. Zander T. Bardwell J.C. Beckwith J. Science. 2004; 303: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) carrying pCH3, a pBAD18 derivative encoding dsbA (15Kadokura H. Tian H. Zander T. Bardwell J.C. Beckwith J. Science. 2004; 303: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), was grown in NZ medium (NZ amine, 10 g/liter; yeast extract, 5 g/liter; NaCl, 10 g/liter) with 200 μg/ml ampicillin, induced with 0.2% w/v arabinose when the A600 reached 0.05, and the cells were harvested at A600 = 1.3. DsbA was purified from the periplasmic extract by a HiTrap Q FF anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences), followed by hydrophobic chromatography on a HiTrap Phenyl HP column (Amersham Biosciences) as described (16Philipps B. Glockshuber R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43050-43057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Reduced DsbA, DsbCs, or α-helix deletion mutants were prepared by incubation in 20 mm dithiothreitol for 20 min at 4 °C. Excess dithiothreitol was removed by gel filtration on PD-10 Sephadex columns (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. To determine the oxidation of DsbC by DsbB in vitro,10 μm reduced wild-type DsbC or DsbC mutants in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, were incubated at 30 °C with 20 μm ubiquinone-1 (coenzyme Q1; Sigma) in 300 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. The reaction was started by the addition of DsbB to a final concentration of 1 μm. A control reaction between DsbA and DsbB was carried out using 10 μm reduced DsbA and 10 nm DsbB. At time intervals, aliquots were withdrawn and the reaction stopped by immediate mixing with trichloroacetic acid to a 10% final concentration. The denatured proteins were collected by centrifugation and washed with cold acetone. Free thiols in reduced DsbC were modified with 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMS) in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 1% SDS, 18 mm AMS as described (17Kadokura H. Bader M. Tian H. Bardwell J.C. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10884-10889Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Reduced and oxidized forms of the proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE without any reducing agents, and detected with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The rate of insulin reduction in the presence of dithiothreitol was determined as previously described (18Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The change of A650 in the reaction was monitored as a direct measure of the aggregation of reduced insulin, and the activity is expressed as the ratio of the initial slope of the turbidity curve to the lag time (19Martinez-Galisteo E. Padilla C.A. Holmgren A. Barcena J.A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 111: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The renaturation of reduced, denatured RNase A was determined as described by Lyles and Gilbert (20Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The protection of citrate synthase from thermal inactivation was monitored according to a previous study (32Buchner J. Grallert H. Jakob U. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 323-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The rate of thermal inactivation obtained with or without 4 μm of each of the DsbC variants was determined. Construction of DsbC α-Helix Deletion Mutants—A 12-amino acid long α-helix linker (amino acids 60-72) joins the dimerization domain to the catalytic domain in the E. coli DsbC, maintaining the two protein domains structurally and functionally distinct (Fig. 1) (5McCarthy A.A. Haebel P.W. Torronen A. Rybin V. Baker E.N. Metcalf P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). We constructed a series of mutant genes encoding DsbC deleted of one, two, three, or four amino acids within the α-helical linker (positions 66, 66-67, 66-68, and 66-69) giving rise to the proteins DsbCαΔ1, DsbCαΔ2, DsbCαΔ3, and DsbCαΔ4, respectively. Because 3.6-amino acidic residues are contained in a α-helical turn, the deletion of each amino acid in the DsbC linker would be expected to cause the catalytic domain to be rotated by 100° with respect to the dimerization domain. As a result, the active site cysteines, which in wild-type DsbC are oriented facing each other, in the deletion constructs would be expected to be rotated by an angle whose magnitude is determined by the number of amino acids deleted (Fig. 1). The genes encoding the dsbC deletions were cloned in the medium copy number plasmid pBAD33 (10Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3960) Google Scholar), under the control of the arabinose promoter. Under the conditions used in these experiments, the wild-type E. coli DsbC and the α-helix deletion mutants all accumulated to nearly identical levels, as determined by Western blotting with a polyclonal antibody specific for the C-terminal His tag (Fig. 2A). Disulfide Bond Isomerization in Vivo—The oxidation of protein cysteines by DsbA is very rapid and may favor the formation of disulfides between adjacent cysteines in the polypeptide, even though these residues may not necessarily be connected in the final conformation of the protein, i.e. the native state (11Berkmen M. Boyd D. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11387-11394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 21Zapun A. Bardwell J.C. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5083-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). For this reason the folding of multidisulfide proteins is often limited by the isomerization of non-native bonds. The folding of three native proteins, the periplasmic acid phosphatase AppA or phytase, the peptidoglycan amidase MepA, and RNase I have been shown to depend on the action of DsbC. In addition, several complex heterologous proteins are known to require isomerization to attain their active conformation (11Berkmen M. Boyd D. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11387-11394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Earlier, we had shown that expression of DsbC from pBAD33 results in a 25-fold increase in the yield of active vtPA, a truncated version of human tissue plasminogen activator containing 9 disulfides, relative to cells expressing DsbC from the chromosomal gene (22Qiu J. Swartz J.R. Georgiou G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 4891-4896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). We now find that all of the DsbC mutants containing deletions in the α-helix linker support the folding of vtPA. However, DsbCαΔ2 and DsbCαΔ4 result in ∼40% of the active vtPA relative to the wild-type DsbC. On the other hand, deletion of 1 (DsbCαΔ1) or 3 (DsbCαΔ3) amino acids resulted in active vtPA levels comparable and slightly lower, respectively, to those obtained with intact DsbC (Figs. 2B and S1). Similar results were obtained with the native substrate AppA, i.e. DsbCαΔ1 and DsbCαΔ3 supported a higher level of AppA activity relative to DsbCαΔ2 and DsbCαΔ4 (Fig. 2C). Because of the role of DsbA as the primary oxidant of extracytoplasmic proteins, many proteins fail to fold properly in dsbA mutants. As a result, dsbA mutants exhibit pleiotropic phenotypes such as low alkaline phosphatase activity or loss of motility (2Kadokura H. Katzen F. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 111-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The kinetic barrier between the reductive and oxidative pathways, as we described earlier, prevents DsbC to work as an oxidant of the extracytoplasmic proteins. To further examine the roles of the α-helical linker of DsbC in the properties of this enzyme, the DsbC mutants were expressed in a strain lacking dsbA, and their ability to suppress the defects associated with lack of disulfide bond formation were tested. In E. coli MC1000 dsbA::kan grown in low phosphate media, the PhoA activity was 30-fold lower than that of its isogenic parent (Fig. 2D). Expression of wild-type DsbC from a multicopy plasmid did not result in a significant increase in PhoA activity, consistent with the earlier finding that, even under conditions of overexpression, the enzyme is maintained in a reduced form by DsbD, and thus it cannot act as a protein oxidant (23Joly J.C. Swartz J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10067-10072Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, deletion of one or more amino acids within the α-helical linker of DsbC gave rise to enzymes that could support the formation of active PhoA. We noted that the ability of the mutants to support the production of alkaline phosphatase was inversely correlated with the disulfide isomerase activity, as determined in the vtPA and AppA assays. In other words, DsbCαΔ2 and DsbCαΔ4, the mutant proteins that gave a lower yield of active vtPA and AppA, could restore PhoA activity in MC1000dsbA to 60% of the level obtained from the chromosomally expressed DsbA, whereas DsbCαΔ1 and DsbCαΔ3 reproducibly displayed the opposite profile (Figs. 2D and S2). The ability of the DsbCαΔ2 and DsbCαΔ4 mutants to support PhoA folding in the absence of DsbA suggests that these DsbC mutants are capable of supplying at least some of the oxidase function of DsbA. Consistent with this, PhoA activity was not detected in a dsbB mutant background (data not shown), revealing that the oxidase activity of the DsbC deletion mutants is dependent on their recycling by DsbB. The size of the motility halo produced by cells growing on soft agar plates depends on the oxidase activity in the periplasm; MC1000dsbA cells were completely non-motile, and overexpression of DsbC from pBAD33 did not restore motility. However, consistent with the PhoA activity results, the DsbC α-helix deletion mutants restored motility, with about 2-fold larger halos observed with DsbCαΔ2 or DsbCαΔ4 compared with DsbCαΔ1 and DsbCαΔ3 (Fig. 2E). Biochemical Characterization—Because the in vivo data suggest that the oxidase activity of DsbC deletion mutants is dependent on the presence of DsbB, we investigated the ability of DsbCαΔ1, DsbCαΔ2, DsbCαΔ3, and DsbCαΔ4 to be oxidized by DsbB in vitro. All proteins contained C-terminal hexahistidine tags and could be purified to >90% homogeneity by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. Gel filtration fast protein liquid chromatography analysis confirmed that the DsbC mutants are dimeric (Fig. S1). CD spectroscopy indicated that the secondary structure of the mutant proteins was not perturbed by the deletions within the α-helix (data not shown). Quinones in the respiratory chain act as a direct recipient of electrons from DsbB. Oxidation of the reduced form of each DsbC variant by DsbB was performed in the presence of ubiquinone-1 as the recycling agent, and initiated by the addition of DsbB (17Kadokura H. Bader M. Tian H. Bardwell J.C. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10884-10889Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Following alkylation of free thiols with AMS, the oxidized and reduced proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). In this assay DsbA got completely oxidized after 5 min of incubation with 10 nm DsbB. In contrast, DsbC resisted oxidation by DsbB almost completely: >80% of the protein was found in the reduced state even after 1 h of incubation with 1 μm DsbB. Deletion of one or more amino acids in the α-helix greatly increased its susceptibility to oxidation by DsbB. Consistent with the in vivo results presented in Fig. 2, deletions of two or four amino acids resulted in greater susceptibility to oxidation. Specifically, after 30 min, only 28 and 30% of respectively DsbCαΔ1 and DsbCαΔ3 was found in the oxidized state compared with 58 and 65% of DsbCαΔ2 and DsbCαΔ4, respectively. The disulfide isomerase activity of the DsbC α-helix deletion mutants in the refolding of reduced RNase A was evaluated by monitoring the increase in cAMP hydrolysis rate by active RNase A, as a function of time. In this reaction an initial lag phase that corresponds to the oxidation of RNase A is observed, followed by an increase in the rate of hydrolysis of cAMP, as more native enzyme accumulates (20Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). In this assay, DsbC deletion mutants exhibited significantly lower isomerase activity relative to the wild-type enzyme (Table 2). The reductase activity of the purified enzymes was determined by monitoring insulin reduction in the presence of dithiothreitol, which results in the aggregation of insulin and a concomitant increase in turbidity (18Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The deletion mutants exhibited substantial reductase activity, although lower than that of the wild-type enzyme (Table 2). In cont"

To determine the Ras effector pathways that represent the minimal essential contribution to full oncogenic transformation in this context, we evaluated the cooperativity of different Ras effector mutants with overexpressed ODC in an in vivo tracheal xenotransplantation assay for epithelial cell invasiveness. Primary keratinocytes, isolated from either K6/ODC transgenic mouse skin (expressing increased ODC) or from normal littermate skin were infected with retrovirus producing an activated RasV12 or partial loss-of-function effector mutants of RasV12 that selectively induce only the Raf/ERK, RalGDS, or the PI3-kinase signaling pathway. Whereas keratinocytes expressing a fully activated RasV12 are not invasive in tracheal xenotransplants, ODC-overexpressing keratinocytes acquire an invasive phenotype with additional expression of either RasV12 or activation of the Raf/ERK pathway. Independent of a mutated ras, elevated levels of ODC activate the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway as well as the Rho/Rac pathway in primary keratinocytes. Thus, Raf/ERK signaling is sufficient to cooperate with increased ODC activity in the conversion of normal keratinocytes to invasive cells. In order to promote invasiveness in keratinocytes, elevated levels of ODC may cooperate with Raf/ERK via activation of the Akt and Rho/Rac signaling pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1983173244,"Mammalian Hus1 plays an important role in maintaining genomic integrity. Cells lacking mouse Hus1 are hypersensitive to DNA damage inducers including UV and camptothecin (CPT). By using clonogenic assay, we show here that Hus1 deficient mouse cells are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation (IR) compared with their Hus1-positive counterparts. However, these cells show similar induction levels and similar rejoining rates of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) following IR, indicating that the effect of Hus1 on cell radiosensitivity is independent of nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ). By combining an I-SceI-induced-DNA DSBs system and a siRNA approach, we also show that knocking down Hus1 decreases the efficiency of homologous recombination repair (HRR), which is associated with the cellular sensitivity to IR-induced killing. Together, these results indicate that the role of Hus1 affecting the sensitivity of cells to IR-induced killing is independent of NHEJ but might be linked to HRR."
https://openalex.org/W2075801435,"In human neuroblastoma tumors, amplification of the N-myc proto-oncogene and loss of all or part of the short arm of chromosome #1 are both associated with a poor prognosis. Accruing evidence indicates that it is the absence of one allele of the HuD (ELAVL4) gene, encoding the neuronal-specific RNA-binding protein HuD and localized to 1p34, that is linked to amplification. In 12 human neuroblastoma cell lines, N-myc amplification correlates with loss of one HuD allele and decreased HuD expression. Transfection experiments demonstrate that modulating HuD expression affects N-myc gene copy number as well as expression. Introduction of a sense HuD construct into two N-myc amplified cell lines considerably increases N-myc expression whereas gene copy number decreases. Conversely, expression of antisense HuD in N-myc nonamplified SH-SY5Y cells reduces HuD and N-myc mRNA levels even as cells show amplification of the N-myc gene. Thus, N-myc gene copy number is modulated by alteration of HuD expression. We propose that haploinsufficiency of HuD due to chromosome #1p deletion in neuroblastoma selects for cells that amplify N-myc genes. Application of these findings could lead to more effective therapies in the treatment of those patients with the worst prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2079980251,"IL-4 and IL-13 have important roles in the pathogenesis of asthma. A novel finding was that brief exposure of airway smooth muscle cells to IL-4 inhibited carbachol-stimulated calcium transients. We hypothesized that IL-4 inhibits transients by decreasing calcium store content and tested this by measuring the effects of IL-4 on transients induced by a nonspecific ionophore. Bovine trachealis cells were loaded with fura 2-AM, and cytosolic calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i) were measured in single cells by digital microscopy. Stimulation (S1) with carbachol (10 microM) caused rapid, transient increases in [Ca2+]i to 1299 +/- 355 nM (n=5). After recovery of calcium stores, stimulation (S2) of the same cells with ionomycin (10 microM), in the absence of extracellular calcium, also increased [Ca2+]i to give S2/S1 ratio of 1.03 +/- 0.29. However, after 20 min of IL-4 (50 ng/ml), but not IL-13, ionomycin transients were decreased to 0.50 +/- 0.16 (S2/S1, P=0.02, n=6). IL-4 did not inhibit transients with ryanodine receptor calcium release channels (RyR) blocked by ryanodine (200 microM) (S2/S1=1.01+/-0.11) but still did in the presence of 8-bromo cyclic ADP-ribose, an antagonist of cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) signaling at RyR (S2/S1=0.48+/-0.13). Together, findings suggest that IL-4 decreases intracellular calcium stores by mechanisms dependent on RyR, but not on cADPR signaling."
