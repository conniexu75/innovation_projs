https://openalex.org/W1975914851,"Molecular dynamics was used to refine macromolecular structures by incorporating the difference between the observed crystallographic structure factor amplitude and that calculated from an assumed atomic model into the total energy of the system. The method has a radius of convergence that is larger than that of conventional restrained least-squares refinement. Test cases showed that the need for manual corrections during refinement of macromolecular crystal structures is reduced. In crambin, the dynamics calculation moved residues that were misplaced by more than 3 angstroms into the correct positions without human intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2001363398,"Ideas about atmospheric composition and climate on the early Earth have evolved considerably over the last 30 years, but many uncertainties still remain. It is generally agreed that the atmosphere contained little or no free oxygen initially and that oxygen concentrations increased markedly near 2.0 billion years ago, but the precise timing of and reasons for its rise remain unexplained. Likewise, it is usually conceded that the atmospheric greenhouse effect must have been higher in the past to offset reduced solar luminosity, but the levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases required remain speculative. A better understanding of past atmospheric evolution is important to understanding the evolution of life and to predicting whether Earth-like planets might exist elsewhere in the galaxy."
https://openalex.org/W2104942424,"Acid deposition and photochemical smog are urban air pollution problems, and they remain localized as long as the sulfur, nitrogen, and hydrocarbon pollutants are confined to the lower troposphere (below about 1-kilometer altitude) where they are short-lived. If, however, the contaminants are rapidly transported to the upper troposphere, then their atmospheric residence times grow and their range of influence expands dramatically. Although this vertical transport ameliorates some of the effects of acid rain by diluting atmospheric acids, it exacerbates global tropospheric ozone production by redistributing the necessary nitrogen catalysts. Results of recent computer simulations suggest that thunderstorms are one means of rapid vertical transport. To test this hypothesis, several research aircraft near a midwestern thunderstrom measured carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, ozone, and reactive nitrogen compounds. Their concentrations were much greater in the outflow region of the storm, up to 11 kilometers in altitude, than in surrounding air. Trace gas measurements can thus be used to track the motion of air in and around a cloud. Thunderstorms may transform local air pollution problems into regional or global atmospheric chemistry problems."
https://openalex.org/W2047822864,"A sample of 200 native plant names from the Tzeltal-speaking municipio of Tenejapa, Chiapas, Mexico, was found to consist of 41 percent that comprised more than one botanical species, 34 percent with a one-to-one correspondence, and 25 percent that referred to only a part of a botanical species. Cultural significance was least for the plants in the first group, greatest for those in the last group. Over half (60 percent) of the names for which there was one-to-one correspondence were plants associated with Hispanic culture, introduced as named entities following the Spanish conquest."
https://openalex.org/W2049101589,Kelp forests along the coast of central California harbor juvenile rockfish that prey on the larvae of invertebrates from the rocky intertidal zone. This predation reduces recruitment to barnacle populations to 1/50 of the level in the absence of fish. The dynamics of the intertidal community are thus strongly coupled to the dynamics of the offshore kelp community.

https://openalex.org/W2081908678,"The construction of solar or stellar models is hindered by the difficulty of computing, with sufficient accuracy, the convective fluxes in unstable regions. Although the mixing-length theory of convection has been used for more than three decades, its validity has neither been tested by experiment nor verified by computation. This report presents the results of a three-dimensional numerical simulation of deep and efficient convection that support two conclusions: (i) the basic picture proposed by the mixing-length theory is physically valid-the vertical correlation of the motion of fluid elements is proportional to the pressure scale height; and (ii) some dynamical variables, including the convective flux, can be approximately computed from the structure of the stratification with mixing-length approximations."
https://openalex.org/W2090047556,"Protoplasts can be readily prepared from higher-plant tissue with a concentrated Myrothecium cellulase preparation. An ionic osmoticum produced a higher yield and more viable protoplasts than did the nonionic man nitol osmoticum. Addition of polyuronidases or of ethylenediaminetetra-acetate did not increase the yield. Protoplasts could be prepared from root, leaf, and callus tissue as well as from coleoptiles."
https://openalex.org/W2066626904,"The concentrations of gibberellin-like substances in the seed, endocarp, and mesocarp of apricots correlates well with growth rates in these tissues between anthesis and maturity. The active substances are present in high concentration, are more polar than the known gibberellins, and are active in both the barley endosperm and dwarf maize bioassays."
https://openalex.org/W2027136667,"A hypothesis to explain the low-frequency (10-to 90-day) variance of the mid-latitude atmosphere is presented. In this hypothesis it is proposed that the planetary-scale waves forced by topography or other zonal inhomogeneities and the day-to-day weather disturbances (synoptic scales) influence each other to generate weather regimes. These quasi-stable flow configurations are responsible for short-range climate anomalies such as droughts, heat waves, deep freezes, and excessive precipitation, as the weather-producing disturbances are organized into storm tracks. Onset and disruption of the weather regimes may be induced by the anomalous development of perhaps a single cyclonic disturbance, which can throw the quasi equilibrium out of balance. Thus, rapid changes in flow regimes can occur almost at random. The development and transition of weather regimes may then be purely internal (that is, depending only upon the properties of the fluid motions themselves) to the atmospheric dynamics. This internal quality suggests that the chaotic, abrupt short-range climatic behavior of the mid-latitudes is a natural behavior of the system that requires no assistance from the outside. The weather regime concept presents a different view of the extended-range atmospheric behavior than the stimulus-response model, such as the atmospheric response to the El Nimo."
