https://openalex.org/W2157589212,Transcriptional control signals of a model eukaryotic protein-coding gene have been identified by a new procedure of in vitro mutagenesis. This method allows small clusters of nucleotide residues to be substituted in a site-directed manner without causing the addition or deletion of other sequences. Transcription assays of a systematic series of these clustered point mutants have led to the identification of three distinct control signals located within the 105-nucleotide residues immediately upstream from the point where transcription begins.

https://openalex.org/W1991213785,"We have established the DNA sequence of nine yeast mutants that prevent the expression either of the split cytochrome b gene alone (five mutants) or of two split genes, the cytochrome b gene and the cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene (four mutants). All the mutations analyzed are localized in intron 14 of the cob-box gene. We have extended the concept of the intron-encoded mRNA maturase, already described for intron 12, to the intron 14, and have adduced evidence that this box7 pleiotropic maturase is involved in the splicing of two distant gene transcripts. Such a process may constitute a regulatory mechanism that coordinates the expression of two structurally nonhomologous genes encoding two metabolically related enzymes. Analyses of cis-dominant mutations reveal the role of signal sequences in the recognition of the intron RNA sequences to be excised. These signal sequences are localized near the exon-intron boundaries (box1), or quite distant from the splicing sites, either in the blocked reading frame (box2) or in the open reading frame (box9) of the intron. We believe that for the last sequence, a ribosomal recognition of the box9 signal could be involved in a regulatory mechanism of the splicing of the pre-mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W2162003018,"DNAs of 20 B- and T-lymphocyte neoplasms of human and mouse origin induced transformation of NIH/3T3 cells with high efficiencies, indicating that these neoplasms contained activated transforming genes that were detectable by transfection. Analysis of the susceptibility of the transforming activities of lymphocyte-neoplasm DNAs to digestion with restriction endonucleases indicated that the same or closely related transforming genes were activated in independent neoplasms representative of the same stage of normal cell differentiation. However, different transforming genes were activated in neoplasms representative of different stages of normal B- and T-lymphocyte differentiation. These results indicate that specific transforming genes are activated in neoplasms of discrete stages of differentiation within these cell lineages."

Data are reported for mixtures of these melanins and for dopa-cysteinyldopa copolymers, which are spectroscopically similar. A simple parameterization of the spectra allows estimation of the relative amounts of (i) dopa melanin and cysteinyldopa melanin in mixtures and of (ii) dopa and cysteinyldopa incorporated into copolymers. Several natural eumelanins and pheomelanins have been characterized and shown to be copolymers."

https://openalex.org/W2067027666,Fusion of phospholipid vesicles with planar bilayer membranes occurs if the vesicles that contact the planar membrane swell osmotically after the replacement in their medium of an impermeant solute by a permeant one. This finding directly demonstrates that osmotic swelling is a driving force for vesicle-planar membrane fusion. The method used to induce vesicle swelling and fusion may have relevance for biological systems.
https://openalex.org/W2082979723,"We describe a particularly advantageous experimental system for studying gene structure, expression and modulation in the nervous system. In the marine mollusc Aplysia, the bag cells, two discrete clusters of neurons, secrete a peptide of known behavioral function. This neuroactive peptide, egg-laying hormone (ELH), produces a characteristic and stereotypic behavioral repertoire, consisting first of a cessation of walking and inhibition of feeding, followed by head waving and egg laying. We have cloned the genes encoding ELH and characterized their organization and expression. At least five distinct genes for ELH exist within the chromosome. Sequence analysis of one recombinant clone unambiguously identifies a contiguous stretch of nucleotides that encodes the 36 amino acids of ELH. Transcription of this small multigene family results in the expression of at least five distinct RNA transcripts encoding ELH. The pattern of transcripts differs strikingly in different tissues: bag cells express three distinct mRNA species, whereas the atrial gland, a secretory reproductive gland, expresses two distinct mRNAs. Several other neuronal and nonneuronal tissues do not express ELH RNA. In vitro these mRNAs produce a series of long polypeptide precursors that must be processed to generate the active ELH peptide. This processing event is likely to generate several additional neuroactive peptides. Thus the same peptide, ELH, may be released in association with different combinations of other neuroactive peptides. The concept of combinatorial sets of neuropeptides, each bearing one overlapping peptide ELH, and each directing a differing pattern of behavior, greatly expands the information potential of a small set of genes."

https://openalex.org/W2090452838,"We have determined what sequences are required to generate the authentic 3' termini of a sea urchin H2A histone mRNA. We have constructed a series of deletion and insertion mutants in the cloned histone repeat unit h22 of Psammechinus miliaris and have analyzed the transcripts of both wild-type and mutant DNAs produced in the frog oocyte. The protein-coding sequences of the H2A gene can be removed without any deleterious effects on transcription initiation or termination. A 12 bp deletion, which removes a highly conserved inverted DNA repeat immediately preceding the H2A mRNA 3' terminus, elicits read-through of the polymerase into the spacer DNA further downstream. However, the inverted repeat and the sequence coding for the 3' terminus of the mRNA are by themselves not sufficient to generate faithful 3' ends. Our data suggest that spacer sequences downstream of the 3' mRNA terminus are required as well."

https://openalex.org/W2039171648,"Avian myeloblastosis virus is defective in reproductive capacity, requiring a helper virus to provide the viral proteins essential for synthesis of new infectious virus. This virus arose by recombination of the nondefective helper virus and host cellular sequences present within the normal avian genome. These latter sequences are essential for leukemogenic activity. The complete nucleotide sequence of this region is reported. Within the acquired cellular sequences there is an open reading frame of 795 nucleotides starting with the initiation codon ATG (adenine, thymine, guanine) and terminating with the triplet TAG. This open reading frame could code for the putative transforming protein of 265 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 30,000."

https://openalex.org/W1979809879,"Administration of synthetic ovine corticotropin-releasing factor led to rapid, parallel increases in adrenocorticotropin and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone concentrations in rat plasma. Prior treatment with dexamethasone almost completely blocked the adrenocorticotropin response but not the increase in melanocyte-stimulating hormone. These data demonstrate that corticotropin-releasing factor is a potent stimulator not only of adrenocorticotropin secretion from the corticotrophs of the anterior pituitary gland but also of peptide secretion from the intermediate lobe. Such data suggest that melanocyte-stimulating hormone and beta-endorphin play a role in the physiological response to stress."
https://openalex.org/W1966740361,"Mouse hepatitis virus type 4 (MHV-4, the JHM strain), a positive-strand RNA virus of the coronavirus family, is well documented as an inducer of acute1–4 and chronic5,6 demyelination in mice, as well as subacute demyelination in rats7,8, due to a cytolytic infection of oligodendrocytes3,4,7. However, experiments to explore the role of virus and host factors in the production of chronic or recurrent demyelinating disease have been limited because MHV-4 usually produces demyelination in conditions that frequently induce a fatal necrotizing encephalomyelitis1–9. To circumvent this problem, we had made and selected mutant viruses that caused both a high incidence of demyelination and a low incidence of encephalitis-induced mortality9. One such mutant, designated ts8, consistently caused acute demyelinating disease in over 90% of intracerebrally or intranasally (natural route of infection) inoculated, 4–5 week-old mice from several susceptible strains within 6–10 days9,10. In addition, ts8 typically did not cause fatal necrotizing encephalitis, showing a low mortality (<5%)9,10. This reflected a unique tropism of ts8 for oligodendrocytes, but a limited one for neuronal cells11. We now report that ts8 is also useful for inducing persistent infection of the mouse central nervous system (CNS). The histopathological correlate of this infection is chronic recurrent demyelination, and virus can be demonstrated ultrastructurally in intact oligodendrocytes, in the vicinity of demyelinated areas."

https://openalex.org/W2058531019,"We have suggested previously that the amino-terminal 8 kilodaltons of pp60src may serve as a structural hydrophobic domain through which pp60src attaches to plasma membranes. Two isolates of recovered avian sarcoma viruses (rASVs), 1702 and 157, encode pp60src proteins that have alterations in this amino-terminal region. The rASV 1702 src protein (56 kilodaltons) and the 157 src protein (62.5 kilodaltons) show altered membrane association, and fractionate largely as soluble, cytoplasmic proteins in aqueous buffers, ion contrast with the membrane association of more than 80% of the src protein of standard avian sarcoma virus under the identical fractionation procedure. Plasma membranes purified from cells transformed by these rASVs contain less than 10% of the amount of pp60src found in membranes purified from cells transformed by Rous sarcoma virus or control rASVs. The altered membrane association of these src proteins had little or no effect on the properties of chick embryo fibroblasts transformed in monolayer culture. In contrast, rASV 1702 showed reduced in vivo tumorigenicity compared with Rous sarcoma virus or with other rASVs that encode membrane-associated src proteins. Rous sarcoma virus-induced tumors are malignant, poorly differentiated sarcomas that are lethal to their hosts. rASV 1702 induces a benign, differentiated sarcoma that regresses and is not lethal to its hosts. These data support the role of amino-terminal sequences in the membrane association of pp60src, and suggest that the amino terminus of pp60src may have a critical role in the promotion of in vivo tumorigenicity."
https://openalex.org/W2047387450,"Discoidin I and II are lectins synthesized during the aggregation of Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae which may play a role in cellular cohesion. Discoidin I was thought to consist of two major polypeptides, but we show that there are three. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the polypeptides has been predicted by determining part of the nucleotide sequence of their respective mRNAs. We obtained the nucleotide sequences by reverse transcription of the mRNAs, using as primers, fragments derived from the coding region of two cloned discoidin I sequences, and utilizing cross hybridization to the various mRNA species and differences in the length of their 5' noncoding regions to isolate fragments for DNA sequencing. We used primer extension to measure the relative concentration of the three major discoidin I mRNA sequences. We show that during development changes in the abundance of all three mRNA sequences occur coordinately. In cells growing in nutrient broth, however, only two of the three major discoidin I mRNA sequences accumulate, and if such cells are grown to a very high density, both sequences disappear. These results indicate that the coordination of discoidin I gene expression is not obligatory and that the members of this multigene family may differ in the mode of their induction during normal development."

https://openalex.org/W2066654312,"The active exogenous murine leukemia virus sequences of mouse cells growing in culture are preferentially digested by deoxyribonuclease I in metaphase chromosomes. As determined by nuclear nick translation, all of the gene sequences of these cells active during interphase are in a deoxyribonuclease I-sensitive conformation during metaphase. This method of nick translation can therefore be used to label chromosomes in situ in order to visualize the active regions of the genome."
https://openalex.org/W2047065290,"Cultured fibroblasts were infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and the pathway of exocytosis of G protein, the transmembrane glycoprotein of VSV, was followed by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. G protein was detected within the endoplasmic reticulum, within smooth vesicles and stacks in the Golgi region and on the cell surface. No G protein was detected in the coated regions of the Golgi. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that coated regions of the Golgi are involved in transfer of lysosomal enzymes and other substances to lysosomes and not in exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2026260578,"We have established the DNA sequence of two cis-dominant mutations located in the fourth intron, a14, of the yeast mitochondrial gene oxi3. These mutations prevent the synthesis of subunit I of cytochrome oxidase. Both mutations affect a very short DNA sequence located several hundred base pairs from the intron-exon junctions. An identical sequence is found in the cob-box gene; and this sequence is critical for the excision of the cytochrome b intron. Our interpretation is that this short sequence represents a common signal that must be recognized by the box7-encoded mRNA maturase, in conjunction with the mitochondrial ribosome, to splice out the introns in the two nonhomologous genes, cob-box and oxi3."

https://openalex.org/W2157762989,"The intracellular transport and certain posttranslational modifications of the large glycoprotein (G1) of LaCrosse virus (LAC) in BHK cells have been studied. G1 from released LAC virus was characterized by complex oligosaccharides (endo H-resistant) and covalently attached fatty acid. Only a small fraction of total cellular G1 was present on the baby hamster kidney cell surface. Cell-surface G1 contained complex oligosaccharides, while total G1 in infected cells contained largely unprocessed (endo H-sensitive) oligosaccharides. In addition, cell G1 contained significantly less fatty acid than virion-associated G1. Pulse-chase experiments showed that the oligosaccharides of G1 were processed to the complex from much more slowly than the oligosaccharides of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) glycoprotein (G). In addition, transit of LAC G1 to the cell surface and into extracellular virions was two to three fold slower than the transit of VSV G. Thus LAC G1 accumulates intracellularly and is only slowly processed by intracellular processing enzymes. Treatment with monensin caused accumulation in the cell of a form of G1 with partial sensitivity toward endo H, suggesting that monensin may act to inhibit the glycosylation process directly."
https://openalex.org/W2080481042,"In many multimodal therapies of cancer, postsurgical chemotherapy is administered before immunotherapy for treatment of micrometastatic disease. This sequence may not be the most efficacious. Experiments in which strain 2 guinea pigs bearing syngeneic L10 hepatocarcinomas were given immunotherapy showed that infiltrating immune effector cells not only were tumoricidal but disrupted the characteristically compact structure of metastatic foci. When cytotoxic drugs were administered at the peak of this inflammatory response, the survival rate of the guinea pigs increased significantly. We conclude that postsurgical immunotherapy can enhance the effect of cytotoxic drugs administered subsequently."

https://openalex.org/W2063332229,Intermediate lobes isolated from rat pituitary glands incorporated [35S]sulfate into pro-opiomelanocortin and other adrenocorticotropic hormone-containing peptides. Incubation of intermediate lobes in medium containing the arginine analog canavanine inhibited the cleavage of pro-opiomelanocortin into smaller products. Pro-opiomelanocortin that accumulated in the presence of canavanine was also sulfated.

https://openalex.org/W1567866205,"Chymotryptic fragments C-1 (amino acids 72-248) and C-2 (amino acids 1-71) of bacteriorhodopsin have been shown previously to reassociate so as to regenerate the native bacteriorhodopsin chromophore in lipid/detergent mixtures and to form functional proton-translocating vesicles. The fragment C-2 has now been selectively methylated with formaldehyde and sodium cyanoborohydride to give the epsilon-dimethylamino derivatives of Lys-30, 40, and 41 in 96-99% average yield. The methylated and unmethylated C-2 fragments were identical in their ability to reassociate with fragment C-1 and retinal to regenerate the bacteriorhodopsin chromophore and to form functional proton-translocating vesicles. In contrast, dimethylation of the lysine residues of the C-1 fragment gave a derivative which did not form an active complex with unmethylated C-2. We conclude that the epsilon-amino group in Lys-41 is not required for Schiff's base formation with retinal at any step in the light-driven proton-translocation cycle."

https://openalex.org/W2019903577,"The frequency of ecotropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV) production in cells induced with halogenated pyrimidines has been investigated in several low leukemic strains of mice. Very few BALB/c or C57BL/6 (B6) induced embryo cells produce MuLV; this low frequency increases 10 to 50 fold in cells of the BALB/c x B6 F1 hybrid. Data from back-crosses of the F1 hybrid to each parent and from BALB/c x B6 recombinant inbred strains indicate that the phenotype of enhanced MuLV production results from interaction of two unlinked loci, dominant (+/+) alleles of which are carried by either parent. Genetic tests with BALB/c x B6 recombinant inbred strains confirm this two-locus model. The loci are designated Inc-1 and Inb-1 to signify their phenotypic detection by induction and the BALB/c or B6 strain of origin, respectively. Examination of hybrids of BALB/c and of B6 with other strains indicates that strains related in pedigree to BALB/c carry Inc-1, whereas those related to B6 carry Inb-1. Identification of genetic loci that specifically interact to enhance MuLV production after exposure to halogenated pyrimidines indicates the existence of mechanisms that regulate the induction or intracellular expression of endogenous MuLV."
https://openalex.org/W1552765419,"The synthetic phosphohexapeptides Arg-Arg-Ala-Thr(35P)-Val-Ala and Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser(32P)-Val-Ala, phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase and differing only in the nature of the phosphorylated residue, have been used as substrates of a partially purified rat liver protein phosphatase-T, distinct from the multifunctional protein phosphatase-1. While the phosphothreonyl hexapeptide is readily dephosphorylated (exhibiting a Km = 15 microM), the phosphoseryl one is almost unaffected. Such a behavior is not shared by protein phosphatase-1, calf intestine alkaline phosphatase, and potato acid phosphatase, all of which are more active on the phosphoseryl hexapeptide. The NH2-terminal basic residues critical for cAMP-dependent phosphorylation are not required in the dephosphorylation reaction, as both Arg can be removed without impairing the efficiency of protein phosphatase-T toward the phosphothreonyl peptide. On the other hand, the replacement of 2 Pro for the Ala and Val flanking Thr(32P), to give a new phosphohexapeptide reproducing the phosphorylated site of protein phosphatase inhibitor-1, prevents the protein phosphatase-T activity. Moreover, IgG heavy chain 32P labeled in tyrosine is not affected by protein phosphatase-T, while it is dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase. These results would indicate that protein phosphatase(s)-T represent a distinct class of protein phosphatases specifically involved in the dephosphorylation of phosphothreonyl residues fulfilling definite structural requirements."

Under normal conditions in this building, constructed 10 years ago, the two asbestos-containing materials released fibers into the air. This is the first measurement of elevated (up to 170 nanograms per cubic meter) concentrations of indoor airborne asbestos associated with the weathering of asbestos floor tiles during their service life. Asbestos flooring is used in a large number of buildings and represents the third largest use of asbestos fibers in the United States and in Europe, ranking after roofing and asbestos-cement pipe."

https://openalex.org/W2161813702,"Postaggregative gene expression in Dictyostelium discoideum requires cell contact. Polyspecific monovalent antibodies (Fab) prepared from sera raised against membranes of aggregation- and postaggregation-stage cells were used to probe the cell interactions that induce rapid postaggregative synthesis of UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. When cells of strain V12M2 were dissociated after 8 hr of development and replated in the presence of immune Fab, both reaggregation and pyrophosphorylase synthesis were blocked. Fab neutralized by incubation with EDTA-high salt extracts of cells developed for 3 hr blocked pyrophosphorylase synthesis but not reaggregation. Therefore, some cell-surface components that regulate pyrophosphorylase synthesis (called E sites) are antigenically distinct from those required for reaggregation. The Fab provides a means to assay E sites during their purification. Addition of 10(-3) M cyclic AMP or cyclic GMP enabled the cells to bypass the blocking of E sites by Fab; pyrophosphorylase was synthesized in the absence of reaggregation. We hypothesize that E sites function by raising the level of intracellular cyclic AMP."
