https://openalex.org/W2048518879,"A quantitative system has been developed for the study of transformation of human diploid fibroblasts in culture by two oncogenic viruses, SV40 and the E46 strain of adeno 7-SV40 ""hybrid"" virus. Seven of the eleven cell strains derived from human skin biopsies when infected with SV40 (10(9) tissue culture infective doses per milliliter) gave rise to transformed colonies with approximately the same frequency (0.03 percent). Two strains derived from patients with Fanconi's anemia, an autosomal recessive disease associated with a high incidence of chromosome abnormalities and spontaneous neoplasms, gave values more than ten times higher. Two strains from persons heterozygous for this gene were also considerably more susceptible to viral transformation."

https://openalex.org/W1514312266,"Abstract Aldehyde-oxidizing capacity has been measured in rat, monkey, and bovine brain with the use of indole-3-acetaldehyde and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide as substrates. The enzyme activity was found to be uniformly distributed in various areas of bovine brain. Mitochondria, prepared by differential and density gradient centrifugation of rat brain homogenates, contained a major portion of the total aldehyde-oxidizing activity while smaller amounts were present in the supernatant fraction. The enzyme was purified from fresh bovine brain and also from frozen and thawed bovine and monkey brains. It has been separated from succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase. The apparent pH optimum is 10, above which irreversible denaturation occurs. A number of aliphatic aldehydes ranging from formaldehyde to palmitic aldehyde and aldehydes derived from serotonin, epinephrine, and dopamine (3,4-dihydroxyphenylethylamine) were substrates for the enzyme. The rates of oxidation could be correlated with the electropositive nature of the carbonyl carbon atom. The Km values were exceptionally low and ranged from 2 x 10-7 M to 7 x 10-5 M. The enzyme was specific for NAD and NAD analogues. No activity was observed with NADP. The effect of several sulfhydryl-characterizing reagents on the monkey brain enzyme was determined. Tetraethylthiuram disulfide and p-chloromercuribenzoate produced 50% inhibition at approximately 5 x 10-5 M while the enzyme was much less sensitive to γ-(p-arsenosophenyl)-n-butyrate. This study provides direct evidence for the oxidation of aldehydes arising from biologically active amines in the brain. Brain aldehyde dehydrogenase may also be important in oxidizing toxic aldehydes derived from exogenous sources, e.g. acetaldehyde from ethanol."

On the formation of Complex ES, by adding hydroperoxide to the enzyme, these electron paramagnetic resonance signals of the enzyme almost completely disappear and replaced by an intense narrow signal of a free radical type at g = 2.00. The spin concentration of this free radical is estimated to be about 1 eq to enzyme hematin unit. It is speculated that one of the 2 oxidizing equivalents of Complex ES may te retained in the form of a stable and reversible free radical of aromatic amino acid residue of the enzyme protein and the other in the hematin prosthetic group of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1606816308,"Abstract An acidic component of the cell wall lipopolysaccharide of Escherichia coli 0111-B4 was isolated from mild acid hydrolysates of the polymer. It was concluded that this compound was 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid on the basis of the following criteria: (a) paper chromatography in a variety of solvent systems; (b) degradation with ceric sulfate following borohydride reduction; (c) enzymatic degradation by 3-deoxyoctulosonate (KDO) aldolase to yield pyruvate and D-arabinose; (d) the rate of liberation of β-formyl pyruvate by periodate oxidation; (e) chemical synthesis of crystalline penta-O-acetyl-KDO methyl ester, which, upon alkaline saponification, yielded KDO which corresponded chromatographically to KDO from lipopolysaccharide. Further, the product of saponification was identical with natural KDO with regard to the specificities of cytidine 5'-phosphate-KDO synthetase and KDO aldolase. The procedure employed for the chemical synthesis of KDO provides a method for the preparation of a chemically pure standard of this compound."
https://openalex.org/W1552352307,"Abstract An enzyme, 5'-hydroxyl polynucleotide kinase, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of 5'-hydroxyl ends of deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid in the presence of adenosine triphosphate has been purified from cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli infected with bacteriophage T2. The enzyme activity is also found after infection with bacteriophage T4 but was not detected in extracts of cells infected with T1 or T5. The kinase activity is not formed if cells are infected in the presence of chloramphenicol. The phosphorylation of the 5'-hydroxyl end was established by the following observations. (a) Polynucleotides can be converted to a suitable phosphate acceptor by the action of micrococcal nuclease, an endonuclease which produces 5'-hydroxyl ends in DNA and RNA. (b) The 32P introduced into DNA and RNA by the action of the kinase was quantitatively converted to inorganic phosphate by the action of alkaline phosphatase or phosphomonoesterase. (c) Degradation of 32P-labeled polyriboadenylate and polyribocytidylate, products of the 5'-hydroxyl polynucleotide kinase, with alkali resulted in the quantitative isolation of the 32P as 2'(3')-5'-adenosine diphosphate or 2'(3')-5'-cytidine diphosphate, respectively. No detectable 32P was recovered as 2'(3')-AMP or 2'(3')-CMP. (d) It was shown that tritiated thymidylate introduced at the 3'-hydroxyl end of the DNA chain with DNA polymerase was converted to an acid-soluble form by the action of venom phosphodiesterase much earlier than 32P introduced into DNA by the kinase. Evidence was also presented that the phosphorylation of RNA and DNA by the purified kinase preparation was catalyzed by the same enzyme. The ratio of these two activities is relatively constant during purification and the rates of inactivation of these two activities at 37° were identical."
https://openalex.org/W1539090147,"The specificity of the enzyme purified from T2-infected Escherichia coli which catalyzes the phosphorylation of 5'-hydroxyl ends of ribonucleic acid and deoxyribonucleic acid has been examined. The enzyme also catalyzes the phosphorylation of 5'-hydroxyl groups of polynucleotides as well as 3'-mononucleotides. There is no detectable phosphorylation of nucleosides and adenosine 2'-phosphate is virtually inactive as a phosphate acceptor. The enzyme is also capable of using guanosine, cytidine, and uridine triphosphates as well as adenosine triphosphate as the phosphorylating agent. The enzyme catalyzes the quantitative phosphorylation of available 5'-hydroxyl groups occurring in a variety of different DNA preparations. When used in conjunction with alkaline phosphatase, the enzymatic phosphorylation of DNA measures the total amount of 5'-hydroxyl and 5'-phosphate ends present in DNA. The 5'-hydroxyl polynucleotide kinase was used to measure the amount of 5'-hydroxyl ends formed in DNA degraded by sonic oscillation and alkali and heat denaturation. In all of the cases, virtually no additional 5'-hydroxyl groups were formed. The 5'-hydroxyl kinase has also been detected in nuclei of rat liver and the activity partially characterized."
https://openalex.org/W1580313770,"In order to investigate the biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide in vivo and to evaluate comparatively the quantitative significance of three precursors, nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, and quinolinic acid, the radioactive substrates were injected directly into the portal vein of mice, and the radioactive compounds in the liver were analyzed. When administered in small doses, nicotinic acid was a much better precursor of NAD than nicotinamide. The incorporation of nicotinic acid-14C into NAD proceeded almost linearly up to 10 min, thereafter NAD-14C gradually decreased to about one-half by 10 hours. In contrast, nicotinamide-14C injected in this way was not utilized significantly for the synthesis de novo of NAD during the 1st hour after the injection. Quinolinic acid-14C hardly penetrated into the liver cells. On the contrary, when administered in large quantities, nicotinamide was a much better precursor of NAD in the liver than nicotinic acid. With a large dose of nicotinamide-14C as substrate, the total radioactivity in the liver decreased rapidly during the 1st hour and then increased up to almost 8 hours after the injection. During the initial phase, the incorporation of 14C into NAD was almost insignificant, but NAD-14C in the liver started to increase about 1 hour after the injection with the concomitant increase of the total radioactivity in the liver. Analyses of the distribution of 14C in various organs and tissues indicated that a large portion of nicotinamide-14C was first excreted from liver, accumulated in the gastrointestinal tract, deamidated to nicotinic acid, reabsorbed into the liver, and served as precursor to NAD over a prolonged period of time."

https://openalex.org/W1523559382,"Abstract Preincubation of a partially purified enzyme preparation, obtained from bovine adrenal cortex, in the presence of adenosine triphosphate and magnesium ions resulted in a time-, temperature-, and concentration-dependent increase in the phosphorylase phosphatase activity. Preincubation of the activated enzyme fraction in the presence of ATP or one of several other phosphonucleosides, resulted in a time-, temperature-, and concentration-dependent inactivation of the phosphorylase phosphatase activity. The inactive enzyme fraction could then be reactivated in the presence of ATP plus magnesium ions or, at a slower rate, with magnesium ions alone, provided the inactivation was brought about in the presence of ATP. Adenosine 3',5'-phosphate, in the presence of ATP and magnesium ions converted the active form of the enzyme to a less active form The effect of adenosine 3',5'-phosphate could not be reversed under the conditions used in this study unless the enzyme fraction was first inactivated in the presence of ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1566805734,"Abstract Acetic anhydride has been used to modify particular amino acid residues of beef liver glutamate dehydrogenase. Acetylation in tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane acetate buffer at pH 7.15 or 8 results in a striking increase in both the guanosine triphosphate and zinc dissociation constants, a decrease in the adenosine diphosphate dissociation constant, normal kinetics at high reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide levels, and a loss of adenosine triphosphate inhibition. On the other hand, Michaelis constants for coenzymes and other substrates are unaffected by such treatment. Also unaffected are the binding constants for purine nucleotides in the absence of coenzyme. It is concluded that the kinetic changes observed on acetylation reflect a loss of the interaction between the coenzyme-active site and the purine nucleotide-binding site. Acetylation also results in loss of enzymatic activity. However, it is shown that substances which inhibit the catalytic reaction protect the enzyme against both the loss of activity and loss of interaction, provided that the acetylation is carried out in the presence of coenzyme in addition to the inhibitory compound. It is suggested that there is a relationship between the functional group acetylated and a rate-limiting step in the enzymatic reaction on the basis of this type of protection and, furthermore, that this functional group is responsible for the interaction between the coenzyme and purine nucleotide site in the active enzyme. It is postulated that this functional group does not lie within any particular nucleotide site, but is masked in the presence of inhibitory substances presumably by a conformational change in the enzyme. It is also concluded, on the basis of the different effects of purine nucleotides on activity and their differing ability to protect against acetylation in the presence of DPNH, that the ADP and GTP sites do not completely overlap. Finally, two distinct types of interactions, one interpeptide chain and the other intrapeptide chain, are postulated to explain the kinetic properties of native and acetylated enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1488238606,"Abstract The mechanism of reaction of adenine phosphoribosyl-transferase from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells was investigated kinetically by initial velocity and product inhibition studies. The data are consistent with a mechanism in which 5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate reacts with the enzyme to form an intermediate, presumably an enzyme-ribose 5-phosphate complex, with which adenine then reacts to form adenylate. Noncompetitive inhibition by inorganic pyrophosphate with respect to adenine suggests that the former binds tightly to the enzyme-adenylate complex. Both PP-ribose-P and PPi participate in the form of their magnesium complexes."

This intermediate, which is the product of the condensation of 2 molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate, is the pyrophosphate ester of a 30-carbon alcohol whose carbon skeleton is believed to differ from that of squalene by the presence of a cyclopropane ring. It is postulated that squalene is formed directly by the reduction and rearrangement of this compound."

See PDF for Structure The enzyme catalyzing the terminal reaction, saccharopine dehydrogenase (ϵ-N-(L-glutaryl-2)-L-lysine:NAD oxidoreductase (L-lysine forming)) has been purified and shown to be a sulfhydryl enzyme having an approximate molecular weight of 49,000. Two distinct pH optima (approximately 10 and 7) exist for the forward and reverse directions of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. The enzyme is stabilized in the presence of relatively high salt concentrations and has been shown to display a high degree of specificity with respect to the coenzyme and substrates. The Michaelis constants for lysine, oxoglutarate, and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide have been found to be 1.2 x 10-2 M, 4.4 x 10-4 M, and 4.6 x 10-5 M, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1502860001,"The concentration-dependent reversible association-dissociation reaction of beef liver glutamate dehydrogenase is found to be affected by treatment with acetic anhydride. Under different conditions, acetylation in Tris-acetate buffer yields either a fully active or inactive species which can no longer undergo association. As determined by light-scattering and equilibrium sedimentation, the molecular weight of the acetylated enzyme, either active or inactive, is 400,000 ± 25,000, the same as observed for native enzyme when reversibly dissociated. In this paper, association of the enzyme is considered as a monomer-polymer process with monomer being defined as enzyme of molecular weight 400,000, even though the monomer itself consists of eight peptide chains of molecular weight 50,000. Acetylation of partially associated native enzyme at low concentrations of acetic anhydride decreases enzymatic activity by 80% with little change in the weight average molecular weight. At higher acetic anhydride concentrations, the molecular weight drops sharply to that of the monomer, and the activity is completely lost. It is concluded that different functional groups are responsible for catalytic activity and for monomer-tetramer association. Further, as measured by ninhydrin, only one amino group per peptide chain of molecular weight 50,000 is responsible for the changes in catalytic activity and regulatory properties, and one to two different amino groups per peptide chain are involved in the monomer-tetramer association. The reactivity of these latter groups, but not the former, is influenced by the state of association of the protein. The mode of association of the enzyme is different when adenosine diphosphate plus reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide are present since a pentamer (containing 40 peptide chains) rather than a tetramer (with 32 peptide chains) is formed at high enzyme concentrations. From the effect of acetylation on activity and molecular weight in the presence and absence of ADP and DPNH, it is concluded that pentamer, but not tetramer, formation involves the same functional group as that involved in over-all catalytic activity and regulatory properties. The results obtained concerning the kinetic and molecular properties are discussed in terms of a minimum of four different types of interactions. These are intrapeptide chain, interpeptide chain, monomer-monomer interactions in the absence of, and monomer-monomer interactions in the presence of, ADP and DPNH. Tyrosyl and sulfhydryl groups are not involved in the changes which are observed upon treatment with acetic anhydride. The advantage of performing acetylation experiments in Tris-acetate buffer is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1525268635,"Abstract Several lines of evidence reported previously indicated that the reactions shown below are catalyzed by a synthetase purified from rabbit liver, but the predicted biotin-dependent 32P-labeled pyrophosphate-adenosine triphosphate exchange was found to be very slow. ATP + d-biotin (Mg++)/⇌ d-biotinyl 5'-adenylate + PPi (1) d-Biotinyl 5'-adenylate + propionyl coenzyme A apocarboxylase → propionyl-CoA holocarboxylase + AMP (2) In the present study it was found that a relatively rapid exchange reaction, dependent on the presence of Mg++ ions and the synthetase as well as biotin, occurs only if unusually high PPi concentrations are employed. The Km of PPi is 3.3 x 10-2 m, and the enzyme is not saturated by PPi concentrations approaching maximum solubility in the reaction mixture. The Km of biotin for the exchange reaction (3.6 x 10-9 m) is similar to that already known for holocarboxylase synthesis, whereas the Km of ATP for the exchange reaction (3.3 x 10-5 m) is about 50-fold greater than for holocarboxylase synthesis. This difference may be attributed to an inhibitory effect of PPi, since the Km of ATP for holocarboxylase synthesis is 2.1 x 10-5 m when PPi is included in the reaction mixture. The exchange rate under optimal conditions is slightly greater than the rate of ATP formation from d-biotinyl 5'-adenylate and PPi (reverse of Reaction 1) and is about 20 times greater than the rate of the over-all forward reaction in which biotin is covalently bound to the protein. The turnover number of the newly formed propionyl-CoA holocarboxylase is about 1280 moles of CO2 fixed per min per mole of biotin incorporated. The specificity of rabbit liver propionyl-CoA holocarboxylase synthetase, yeast acetyl-CoA holocarboxylase synthetase, and Propionibacterium shermanii holotranscarboxylase synthetase toward several apoenzymes (rat liver propionyl-CoA apocarboxylase, Commamonas terrigena β-methylcrotonyl-CoA apocarboxylase, and P. shermanii apotranscarboxylase) was determined. Significant activity was found with all synthetase-apocarboxylase combinations with the sole exception of the combination, liver synthetase-bacterial apotranscarboxylase. These results indicate broad synthetase specificity and suggest that the different apocarboxylases from diverse sources may have common structural features in the region of those lysine residues which accept biotin."
https://openalex.org/W168612836,"Abstract The purification and crystallization of uridine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase from calf liver has been described. As much as 0.3% of the extractable protein is the pyrophosphorylase, which catalyzes the synthesis of uridine diphosphate glucose. After recrystallizing the enzyme twice, constant specific activity is attained; it appears to be almost homogeneous on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and on ultrasedimentation. The recrystallized enzyme is not highly specific for either the nucleoside or the sugar component of the nucleoside diphosphate sugar. When thymidine, cytidine, or guanosine are substituted for uridine, or when galactose, mannose, or xylose are substituted for glucose, the resulting compounds have from 0.1 to 4% of the activity of uridine diphosphate glucose. The molecular weight of the recrystallized enzyme is about 400,000; the specific activity, 240; and the turnover number, 83,000. The following Km values were obtained for each substrate: glucose 1-phosphate, 5.5 x 10-5 m; uridine triphosphate, 2 x 10-4 m; pyrophosphate, 8.4 x 10-5 m; and uridine diphosphate glucose, 6 x 10-5 m. Inorganic phosphate inhibits the enzyme competitively with pyrophosphate at a Ki of 4 x10-3 m and uridine diphosphate competitively with uridine diphosphate glucose at a Ki of 1.5 x 10-4 m."

The enzyme responsible for the reduction cofractionates with hog liver xanthine oxidase. 3. Milk xanthine oxidase also catalyzes the reduction of nicotinamide N-oxide. 4. The electron donors for the reduction are known substrates of xanthine oxidase. 5. Both milk and liver xanthine oxidases exhibit separate pH optima for the reductions dependent on reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide and xanthine. 6. Xanthine oxidase activity and nicotinamide N-oxide reduction activity are destroyed by heat at the same rate. 7. Each activity decreases to the same extent in the livers of rats maintained on protein-deficient diets. 8. Xanthine oxidase activity and xanthine-dependent nicotinamide N-oxide reduction exhibit parallel inhibition by cyanide. It is proposed that xanthine oxidase might be responsible for other N-oxide reductions."
https://openalex.org/W1607470331,"Abstract The metabolism of galactose compounds, especially that of uridine diphosphate d-galactose, has been studied in intact as well as in broken L cells and HeLa cells. It has been shown that the incorporation of d-galactose 1-phosphate into UDP-galactose is rate-limiting in broken cell preparations, whereas the enzymatic 4-epimerization takes place at an appreciable rate. The latter reaction is strongly inhibited by reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide, especially at a pH close to 7. In intact L cells and HeLa cells, UDP-galactose 4-epimerase is rate-limiting. The intracellular epimerase activity constitutes only about 0.1% of that found under optimal conditions in broken cells. Addition of galactose to these cells brings about a block between the general carbon pool of metabolites and the UDP-hexose pool. This is borne out by the fact that administration to intact L cells or to HeLa cells of 14C-galactose and 12C-glucose in equimolar amounts brings about incorporation by 14C into UDP-hexose without detectable dilution of nonradioactive glucose. This blockage of the UDP-hexose pool from the general metabolic pool as well as the blockage of UDP-galactose 4-epimerase may have biological implications, some of which are briefly discussed."

The phosphomonoesterase was separated from the other enzymes and purified 130-fold. It was shown to be nonspecific, with a pH optimum of 6.5. RNase M1 was fractionated from the other types of enzymes by two methods, one of which resulted in a 200-fold purification. Its action on ribonucleic acid was shown to produce a mixture of 2', 3'-cyclic nucleotides; the cyclic purine nucleotides were further hydrolyzed to 3'-phosphates, while the cyclic pyrimidine nucleotides were not. The enzyme was found to be stable to dialysis at pH 5, and to have optimum activity near pH 5.5. 3'-Nucleotidase, RNase M2, and DNase, which were present in a common fraction, were purified about 50-fold. Unlike the 3'-nucleotidase and RNase M2 activities, the DNase activity declined considerably upon standing, and was therefore considered to be due to a unique enzyme. The specificities and other properties of the 3'-nucleotidase and RNase M2 are reported in two accompanying papers."

https://openalex.org/W127237391,"Abstract The electron spin resonance spectra of methemoglobin and denatured methemoglobin are studied as a function of pH. Satisfactory agreement is found between the literature and these studiesregarding denaturative events occurring between pH 3 and 4, between pH 4 and 5, and between pH 10 and 11; the pK for the equilibrium between methemoglobin and methemoglobin hydroxide; and the transition temperature for the denaturation of methemoglobin as a function of pH. Only one class of denatured species is observable by electron spin resonance at 77° K over the pH range 3 to 11. Another class believed to exist gives no electron spin resonance spectra. The former class is favored over the latter when denaturation occurs at high pH, but the distribution results from seemingly irreversible effects, and is not due to a titration characteristic of denatured methemoglobin. We conclude that the electron spin resonance method is applicable in the study of methemoglobins over the pH range of 3 to about 12."

https://openalex.org/W1484840173,"The effects of digitonin and tocopherol on bovine heart reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide- and succinate-cytochrome c reductases and cytochrome c oxidase have been studied with the following results. 1. Low concentrations of digitonin stimulate succinate- and DPNH-cytochrome c reductase and cytochrome c oxidase. Higher concentrations of digitonin completely inhibit cytochrome c reductases, while continuing to stimulate cytochrome c oxidases. 2. Inhibition of the reductases is reversed by either dilution or addition of tocopherol. Stimulation of the reductases and oxidase is prevented by tocopherols but is not reversed by either tocopherols or dilution. 3. Of other compounds tested for ability to prevent these digitonin effects, α-tocopherol polyethylene glycol succinate 1000 and coenzyme Q4 chromanol were effective with a soluble preparation of DPNH-cytochrome c reductase. In addition to these, α-tocopheryl succinate and α-tocopheryl phosphate were effective with a particulate preparation of succinate-cytochrome c reductase. α-Tocopheryl succinate, α-tocopheryl phosphate, α-tocopheryl hydroquinone, and vitamin D2 prevented the stimulation of cytochrome c oxidase. 4. Digitonin stimulation of succinate-cytochrome c reductase is associated with increases in both Vmax and Km (succinate); digitonin inhibition is associated with decreases in both Vmax and Km (succinate). 5. Reduced with respect to oxidized difference spectra of normal and inhibited preparations indicated succinate reduction of cytochromes a + a3, b, and c1, and of flavin in the normal enzyme, but almost no reduction of flavin and cytochromes of a digitonin-inhibited enzyme. 6. Digitonin caused almost complete inhibition of enzymatic reduction of ferricyanide by succinate, but only partial inhibition of reduction of indophenol and phenazine methosulfate. It is concluded from this and from the spectral studies that inhibition is before cytochrome b and after, or at, the flavin. 7. Digitonin stimulates both the reduction or oxidation of cytochrome c but not the reduction of ferricyanide. It is concluded that stimulation is due to irreversible changes in the enzyme that permit more rapid reaction of soluble cytochrome c with the particulate enzyme. 8. Tocopherol apparently forms an insoluble complex with digitonin and decreases the concentration of digitonin in solution. This is possibly the mechanism by which tocopherol counteracts the effects of digitonin on enzymes. Other compounds known to combine with digitonin do not decrease the concentration of digitonin under the conditions of the enzyme assays."

In both the foregoing investigations it was demonstrated with electron microscopy that less than 1 per cent of the cells contained adenovirus 12 particles 72 h after infection with adenovirus alone, yet with adenovirus plus SV 40, 75 per cent of the cells contained adenovirus. Determinations of adenovirus infectivity in human embryonic kidney cell cultures using limiting dilution titrations also consistently demonstrated enhancement of adenovirus growth by SV 40. Similar results were obtained with adenovirus 5 by infectivity titrations and electron microscopy."
