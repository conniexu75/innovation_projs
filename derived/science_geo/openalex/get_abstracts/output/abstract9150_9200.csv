https://openalex.org/W2047115921,"Biological organization may be viewed as consisting of two stages: biosynthesis and assembly. The assembly process is largely under thermodynamic control; that is, as a first approximation it represents a search by each structural molecule for its state of lowest chemical potential. The hydrophobic effect is a unique organizing force, based on repulsion by the solvent instead of attractive forces at the site of organization. It is responsible for assembly of membranes of cells and intracellular compartments, and the absence of strong attractive forces makes the membranes fluid and deformable. The spontaneous folding of proteins, however, involves directed polar bonds, leading to more rigid structures. Intercellular organization probably involves polar bonds between cell surface proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1502488284,"The purification of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) from bovine brain has led to the isolation of two peptides. FGF-1 with 128 amino acids and FGF-2 with 107 amino acids. The biological activity of these two peptides is acid- and heat-labile. As indicated by the amino acid composition of FGF-1 and -2, these two peptides are derived from a common precursor and bear no resemblance to pituitary FGF. The brain FGF peptides, like pituitary FGF, are mitogenic in vitro for the same wide variety of mesoderm-derived cells. Since their mitogenic activity is acid- and heat-labile, they are thereby distinguished from the platelet factor isolated from platelets and from the cationic peptide isolated from serum which has been shown to have the same molecular weight and isoelectric point as brain and pituitary FGF."
https://openalex.org/W2122994357,"The oligonucleotide pppA2′ p5′ A2′ p5′ A is synthesized by extracts from interferon-treated mouse L cells in the presence of double-stranded RNA. This compound is a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis in cell-free systems prepared from L cells or rabbit reticulocytes. After an initial lag, rates of protein synthesis in vitro are severely depressed in the presence of the oligonucleotide, and polysomes become disaggregated. In the presence of high concentrations of emetine, an inhibitor of chain elongation, reticulocyte polysomes containing an average of 4–6 ribosomes per mRNA are partially degraded to structures containing 1–4 ribosomes after incubation with the oligonucleotide. The level of association of exogenous 35S-Met-tRNAf with initiation complexes is not decreased, and under some conditions is even increased, by the oligonucleotide. When RNA is extracted from control and inhibited reticulocyte lysates and assayed for active mRNA content by retranslation in a fresh mRNA-dependent system, the results show extensive loss of template activity in the material obtained from the incubations containing pppA2′ p5′ A2′ p5′ A. The data are consistent with a mechanism in which this inhibitor activates a nuclease which prevents mRNA from being utilized for protein synthesis. This mechanism is contrasted with that of the heme-controlled repressor, another potent inhibitor of translation, which causes extensive inhibition of Met-tRNAf binding to initiation complexes, has no effect on polysome size in the presence of emetine and does not inactivate mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W2075740646,"Using tunicamycin, we have investigated the role of glycosylation in the biosynthesis, processing and turnover of CSP, the major cell surface glycoprotein of chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF). This antibiotic specifically inhibits glycosylation mediated by dolichol pyrophosphate and consequently inhibits the glycosylation of asparaginyl residues of glycoproteins. Tunicamycin inhibited the incorporation of 3H-mannose into CSP by 92–98% and 14C-glucosamine by 84–96%, whereas total protein synthesis was decreased by only 15–45%. Tunicamycin treatment decreased total amounts of CSP by approximately 50–65%, with equal decreases in CSP occurring on the cell surface and in culture medium, whereas intracellular pools of CSP were not substantially affected. In contrast to CSP, three other membrane-associated proteins of apparent molecular weights 75,000, 95,000 and 150,000 daltons were found in increased amounts. Procollagen secretion was not inhibited by tunicamycin. Both procollagen and CSP secretion into culture medium were also not decreased in AD6, a glycosylation-deficient, mutant mouse 3T3 cell line compared to wild-type cells. We examined the mechanism of the decrease in CSP after tunicamycin treatment. The rate of CSP biosynthesis as measured by pulse-labeling with 14C-leucine was not altered. Tunicamycin had only a slight effect on the initial times and rates of CSP appearance on the cell surface; some apparent intracellular redistribution of CSP was detected by immunofluorescence. The major effect of tunicamycin treatment was to accelerate the rate of degradation of CSP 2–3 fold. This increase is sufficient to account for the observed decreases after tunicamycin treatment. Our results suggest that carbohydrates may not be essential for CSP or procollagen synthesis, intracellular processing and secretion, but that carbohydrates may help stabilize CSP against proteolytic degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2088876976,"The synthesis of contractile proteins has been studied during the differentiation of quail skeletal muscle myoblasts in culture. Myoblast differentiation was synchronized by transferring secondary cultures of rapidly dividing myoblasts into medium lacking cell division-promoting factors. Cultures at various stages of differentiation were then pulse-labeled with 35S-methionine, and cell extracts were resolved by electrophoresis on two-dimensional gels. Incorporation into specific proteins was quantitated by autoradiography and fluorography using a scanning densitometer. Contractile proteins synthesized by muscle cultures were identified by their co-electrophoresis on two-dimensional gels with contracile proteins purified from quail breast muscle. Our results show that the synthesis of myosin heavy chain, two myosin light chains, two subunits of troponin and two subunits of tropomyosin is first detected at the time of myoblast fusion and then rapidly increase at least 500 fold to maximum rates which remain constant in muscle fibers. Both the kinetics of activation and the molar rates of synthesis of these contractile proteins are virtually identical. Muscle-specific actin (alpha) synthesis also increases at the time of myoblast fusion, but this actin (alpha) is synthesized at 3 times the rate of other contractile proteins. The synthesis of 30 other muscle cell proteins was quantitated, and most of these are shown to follow different patterns of regulation. From these results, we conclude that the contractile proteins are regulated coordinately during myoblast differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W96640158,"Structural studies of the sugar moieties of ovalbumin glycopeptides I and II were performed by using endo- fi-N-acetylglucosaminidase H. The oligosaccharide fraction liberated from glycopeptide I by the enzyme action consisted almost exclusively of a single compo- nent, whereas that from glycopeptide II was a mixture of two major components. These two components were successfully separated by concanavalin A-Sepharose column chromatography. The structures of these three oligosaccharides were determined by the combination of sequential exoglycosidase digestion, methylation analysis, acetolysis, and Smith degradation. Based on the results, the whole structure of the glycopeptide I was elucidated as Mane1 ---f G(Mancu1 + 3)Mancwl + 6[Gal/31-+ 4GlcNAcfil+ 4(GlcNAcPl+ 2)Manal-+ 3]- (GlcNAcfil --, 4)Manpl + 4GlcNAc/31 -+ 4GlcNAc -+ Asn. Glycopeptide II was shown to be a mixture of two major glycopeptides; Mancvl -+ 3Manal --+ 6[Galfll + 4GlcNAc/?l + 4(GlcNAc/?l + 2)Mancul + 3](GlcNAc/31 -+ 4)Man/31+ 4GlcNAcfil+ 4GlcNAc + Asn and Mancvl -+ G(Mana1 + 3)Mancul+ 6[GlcNAc/~?l + 4(GlcNA$l + 2)Mancul -+ 3](GlcNAc/il ---f 4)Manfil --+ 4GlcNAcPl -+ 4GlcNAc + Asn. The extreme resistance of the P-N- acetylglucosamine residue, linked at the C-4 position of the /%mannosyl residue, to periodate oxidation was observed, and the possible shielding effect by neigh- boring N-acetylglucosamine was discussed. Recent development of the techniques to study the heter- osaccharide chains have elucidated the structures of aspara- gine-linked sugar chains of many glycoproteins. Although several exceptional cases were reported, most of the established structures of asparagine-linked sugar chains can be classified into two major groups. The sugar chains, which fall into the so-called “high mannose type,” have a general structure of (Mann),,Mar$l ---f 4GlcNAc,81 + 4GlcNAc. Our recent studies of the structures of the sugar chains of ovalbumin (1) and thyroglobulin (2) indicated that Mann1 + 6(Mannl 3)Mancul 6(Mancul 3)ManBl -+ 4GlcNAc,B -+ 4GlcNAc + Asn may occur as a common core structure of the high mannose-type sugar chains. Another group, which is called “hetero type,” has a common core structure; Manal + 6(Mancul+ 3)Manpl-+ 4GlcNAc,Bl + 4GlcNAc -+ Asn, to which from two to four side chains composed of sialic acid, galactose, and N-acetylglucosamine"

Biochem. 67, 247-256) was supplemented with dog pancreas microsomal membranes and used to investigate the synthesis and processing of presecretory proteins. Highly efficient processing and segregation of the major bovine pituitary secretory proteins was observed upon mRNA translation. In contrast to the wheat germ cell-free protein synthesizing system, there was no significant inhibition of translation in the reticulocyte lysate even in the presence of high concentrations of dog pancreas microsomal membranes. Since the latter are required for processing and segregation of presecretory proteins, these reactions could be driven to virtual completion in the reticulocyte lysate without affecting the overall rate of protein synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2111409037,"The NH2-terminal sequences of egg white conalbumin and chicken serum transferrin were examined and found to be identical. Conalbumin, when synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free translation system, was found to contain an NH2-terminal extension of 19 amino acid residues. Sequential Edman degradation of this precursor (pre-conalbumin) labeled with radioactive amino acids revealed the following sequence: formula see text: The vertical line indicates the site at which pre-conalbumin is cleaved to yield authentic conalbumin. The sequence represents the primary translation product since the NH2-terminal methionine was shown to be derived from initiator Met-tRNAfMet. A partial NH2-terminal sequence of transferrin synthesized in vitro was also determined (underlined residues) and it is identical with that of pre-conalbumin."

https://openalex.org/W207936530,"HeLa chromatin core particles were digested with trypsin to excise the NH2-terminal histone regions. The resulting nucleoprotein complexes were dissociated in 2.5 M NaCl; the DNA and polypeptides were then allowed to reassemble by lowering the NaCl concentration. Eighty per cent of the DNA reassociated with the polypeptides. The reassembled nucleoprotein complexes sediment at 9.7 S, have a molecular elipticity at 280 nm of 3000 degrees cm2/dmol of PO4, and contain DNase I-susceptible sites at 10 nucleotide intervals. The pattern of products generated by cross-linking the polypeptides with dimethylsuberimidate is very similar to the pattern generated by cross-linking native core particles. The results indicate that histones which lack their HN2-terminal regions retain both the features necessary for correct protein-protein interactions and the ability to fold DNA into a nucleoprotein complex resembling the chromatin core particle."
https://openalex.org/W1505354211,"The lipid composition of the of rat stomach was investigated. Cellular mucus of the mucous cells from gastric epithelium and surface mucus from gastric mucosa were obtained by perfusion in vivo of Ghosh-Lai rat stomachs with 2 M NaCl. Lipids extracted from dialyzed and lyophilized 2 M NaCl perfusates and 0.9% NaCl (saline) controls were quantitatively separated into single components by means of two-dimensional thin layer chromatography and compared. Significant differences in the level of cholesterol esters, di- and triglycerides, and glycolipids were found. Three to 4 times greater quantities of cholesterol esters and di- and triglycerides, and 2 to 6 times greater quantities of glycolipids were found in 2 M NaCl perfusates as compared to saline controls. The glycolipid fraction consisted of neutral and acidic glyceroglucolipids and was devoid of glycosphingolipids. The phospholipids constituted the smallest portion of the lipids present in 2 M NaCl and saline perfusates and were 2 times higher in 2 M NaCl. These data indicate that mucous barrier in addition to mucins contains considerable quantities of lipids of which glyceroglucolipids are the most prominent components."

Both gangliosides were hydrolyzed by neuraminidase isolated from Clostridium perfringens to become neutral hexaglycosylceramides. Based on the results of sequential enzymatic hydrolysis and gas chromatography-mass spectrometric analyses of the methylated sugars, the structures of these two gangliosides were shown to be NeuAcalpha2 leads to 3Galbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAcbeta1 leads to 3Galbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAcbeta1 leads to 3Galbeta1 leads to 4Glc-ceramide and NeuGcalpha2 leads to 3Galbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAcbeta1 leads to 3Galbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAcbeta1 leads to 3Galbeta1 leads to 4Glc-ceramide, respectively. In addition, N-acetyl- and N-glycolylneuraminosyllacto-N-neotetraosylceramides, and N-acetyl- and N-glycolylneuraminosyllactosylceramides were also found in bovine erythrocytes. The predominant fatty acids in these two gangliosides were C 22:0 and C 24:0. C-18 sphingosine was the major base detected."

Control over the sizes of the spheres is effected by using their magnetic cores as part of a redox polymerization system. The use of the microspheres is demonstrated with a separation involving C-1300 neuroblastoma cells, 10 percent of which express the ganglioside GM1 in their membranes. The GM1-containing cells were separated with better than 99 percent purity, while the deficient cells were obtained at least 98 percent pure. The separation, which was carried out under sterile conditions, required only 6 minutes."

https://openalex.org/W50247450,We have observed a biphasic increase in [theta]222 and the tyrosine fluorescence of troponin C (TnC) with increasing [Ca2+]. Approximately 62% of the total helical change and 81% of the total increase in tyrosine fluorescence occurred with Ca2+ binding to a class of sites with a KCa of approximately 2.7 X 10(7) M-1. The remaining spectral changes occurred with Ca2+ binding to a class of sites with KCa of approximately 3.1 X 10(5) M-1. We interpret these biphasic responses in terms of distinct structural changes occurring in TnC with Ca2+ binding to the high affinity (KCa approximately 2.1 X 10(7) M-1) Ca2+-Mg2+ sites and to the low affinity (KCa approximately 3.2 X 10(5) M-1) Ca2+-specific regulatory sites.

https://openalex.org/W1940816240,"Initial velocity studies of rat liver cytosolic P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase in the direction of P-enolpyruvate formation gave intersecting double reciprocal plots indicating that the reaction conforms to a sequential reaction pathway. A complete product inhibition study with MnGDP-, P-enolpyruvate, and HCO3- as product inhibitors indicated that all patterns were noncompetitive. Isotope exchange at equilibrium with exchange between the substrate/product pairs GTP/GDP oxalacetate/HCO3-, and oxalacetate/P-enolpyruvate while varying the concentration of substrate/product pairs in fixed constant ratio gave no complete inhibitory patterns as the concentration of the constant ratio pairs approached saturation. The exchange rates between the substrate/product pairs differed by a factor of 40 when compared under the same assay conditions. These results were interpreted in terms of a random reaction mechanism in which true dead-end complexes do not form and in which the rate-limiting step is not the interconversion of the ternary quarternary central complexes. In addition to the formation of P-enolpyruvate from oxalacetate and MnGTP2-, the enzyme catalyzes the decarboxylation of oxalacetate to pyruvate in the absence of MnGTP2-. This reaction occurs only slowly in the absence of GDP and most rapidly in the presence of MnGDP-. When only MnGTP2- and oxalacetate are present, no pyruvate is formed, and oxalacetate is converted stoichiometrically to P-enolpyruvate. The enzyme also catalyzes the exchange of [14C]GDP into GTP in the absence of P-enolpyruvate. This exchange is stimulated by the presence of HCO3-. When enzyme is incubated with MnGTP2- in the presence or absence of HCO3-, there is no hydrolysis to form GDP and P1. The two partial reactions, namely the exchange of [14C]GDP with the E.HCO3.MnGTP or E.MnGTP complex and the formation of pyruvate from the E.oxalacetate.MnGDP complex provide pathways by which the expected dead-end complexes can be converted to enzyme forms which can return to the catalytic or exchange sequence."

It is now the most common cancer among United States black males. When nonwhite mortality rates were examined by age and birth cohort, it was found that peak rates occurred at every age in the cohort of 1896 to 1900, and declined thereafter. This presages an arrest and reversal of the time trend in summary mortality rates as more recent nonwhite cohorts reach the ages of maximum risk."

https://openalex.org/W2228196146,"Plasma membrane vesicles from rat adipocytes were treated with dimethylmaleic anhydride to remove extrinsic proteins and then used to immunize rabbits. Immunodiffusion experiments performed in agarose containing Triton X-100 (0.1%) revealed a precipitin reaction between anti-membrane serum and the detergent-solubilized proteins from either intact adipocyte plasma membranes or membranes extracted with dimethylmaleic anhydride. Anti-membrane serum caused cytolysis of intact adipocytes and this effect could be eliminated by incubating the serum at 56 degrees C for 30 min to inactivate complement. Heat-inactivated anti-membrane serum caused a significant increase in 14CO2 production from D-[1-14C]glucose in intact fat cells and the partially purified immunoglobulin fraction from anti-membrane serum markedly stimulated 3-O-methylglucose transport. Maximum activation of transport occurred at a 1:5 dilution and was not additive to that achieved by a maximal dose of insulin. Under these conditions, the anti-membrane immunoglobulin fraction had no effect on the binding of 125-i-insulin to fat cells at all concentrations of the hormone tested. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that activation of hexose transport in these studies results from the binding of immunoglobulin directly to the transport system, although an indirect action is also possible."

Molecular weight, amino acid composition, sugar content, number of sulfhydryl groups. NH2-terminal amino acid, isoelectric point, substrate specificity, pH optima, Km values, and inhibitory effect of other steroids were studied.

https://openalex.org/W2424756549,"Reversible guanidine hydrochloride denaturation has been applied to obtain the first quantitative estimate of ligand-induced changes in hemoprotein conformational free energy. It is found that strong field (low spin) complexes, e.g. cyanometmyoglobin (MbCN) and azido metmyoglobin (MbN3), are 1.0 +/- 0.1 kcal/mol more stable than the high spin analogs aquometmyoglobin (MbH2O) and fluorometmyoglobin (MbF). This observed stability increment is essentially independent of the model chosen for data analysis. These results demonstrate the value of denaturation titration in measuring the stabilization of hemoprotein conformation by ligand binding. The denaturation of MbN3 appears complex. This complexity may be quantitatively accounted for by considering spin state equilibria. Applying this correction, MbCN and MbN3 have essentially the same stability in spite of steric differences in the two proteins. This result implies metal spin state is more important than ligand stereochemistry in determining the conformational free energy of myoglobin."

In 10 mM cacodylate, pH 6.5, and at 55 degrees C, D-5,5-dimethyl-delta2-thiazoline-4-carboxylic acid (at concentrations lower than 1 mM) is hydrolyzed into N-formyl-D-penicillamine with a half-life of 3 to 4 min. On this basis, it is very unlikely that D-5,5-dimethyl-delta2-thiazoline-4-carboxylic acid could be one of the end products resulting from the cleavage of benzylpenicillin by the DD-carboxypeptidase of Bacillus stearothermophilus (as reported by Hammarstrom and Strominger (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 7947--7949). In 3 mM phosphate, pH 7.5, and at 37 degrees C, D-5,5-dimethyl-delta2-thiazoline-4-carboxylic acid (at concentrations lower than 1 mM) has a half-life of 45 min. On the basis of kinetic experiments carried out under these conditions with phenoxymethylpenicillin and the DD-carboxypeptidase-transpeptidase of Streptomyces R61, it is concluded that the primary product which arises from the thiazolidine moiety of the antibiotic molecule and gives rise to N-formyl-D-penicillamine, has a half-life of 10 min, a value which is not compatible with the hypothesis that D-5,5-dimethyl-delta2-thiazoline-4-carboxylic acid would be an intermediate involved in the fragmentation pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1611398650,"The behavior of ribosomes derived from EmtR X EmtS hybrid cells in in vitro protein synthesis is similar to that observed with a 1:1 mixture of ribosomes from EmtR and EmtS cells. When mRNA (BM virus RNA) is present in limiting amounts (RNA/ribosome molar ratio = 0.1), protein synthesis in either mixture is sensitive to emetine. In contrast, when mRNA is present in excess (RNA/ribosome molar ratio = 2), the emetine resistant as well as the sensitive components are both expressed in the mixtures. These results strongly indicate that emetine resistant and sensitive ribosomes are present in the hybrid cells in about equal amounts and that the dominance of emetine sensitivity is best explained by assuming that emetine acts by blocking ribosome movement along mRNA by inhibiting the translocation step. The observed time lag in the expression of EmtRI and EmtRII mutations following mutagenesis is consistent with the above hypothesis for the mechanism of action of emetine."

The ratio of the rate of acetyl group oxidation to the rate of O2 consumption is nearly constant (0.34), irrespective of the proportion of glucose and fatty acids oxidized in a tissue or an organism. This relationship is derived by multiplying the respiratory quotient by the ratio of acetyl group oxidation to total CO2 production."
