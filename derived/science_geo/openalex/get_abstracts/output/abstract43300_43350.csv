https://openalex.org/W1987888541,"The isolation of a T-cell tropic retrovirus from three immunodeficient macaques and one macaque with lymphoma is described. The morphology, growth characteristics, and antigenic properties of this virus indicate that it is related to the causative agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome in humans (HTLV-III or LAV). This virus is referred to as simian T-lymphotropic virus type III (STLV-III) of macaques. The existence of a cytopathic, T-cell tropic virus resembling HTLV-III in monkeys may facilitate study of disease induction and vaccine development in an animal model."
https://openalex.org/W2039707682,"The trace element vanadium has an unclear biological function. Vanadate, an oxidized form of vanadium, appears to have an insulin-like action. The effect of vanadate on blood glucose and cardiac performance was assessed in female Wistar rats 6 weeks after they were made diabetic with streptozotocin. When vanadate was administered for a 4-week period to the diabetic rats, their blood glucose was not significantly different from that of nondiabetic controls despite a low serum insulin. In contrast, blood glucose was increased about threefold in the diabetic rats that were not treated with vanadate; these rats also had low insulin levels. Cardiac performance was depressed in the untreated diabetic animals, but the cardiac performance of the vanadate-treated diabetic animals was not significantly different from that of nondiabetic controls. Thus vanadate controlled the high blood glucose and prevented the decline in cardiac performance due to diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2077999459,"Muscle contraction occurs when the actin and myosin filaments in muscle are driven past each other by a cyclic interaction of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and actin with cross-bridges that extend from myosin. Current biochemical studies suggest that, during each adenosine triphosphatase cycle, the myosin cross-bridge alternates between two main conformations, which differ markedly in their strength of binding to actin and in their overall structure. Binding of ATP to the cross-bridge induces the weak-binding conformation, whereas inorganic phosphate release returns the cross-bridge to the strong-binding conformation. This cross-bridge cycle is similar to the kinetic cycle that drives active transport and illustrates the general principles of free energy transduction by adenosine triphosphatase systems."

https://openalex.org/W1565883433,"The distribution of calcium-activated, phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) between cytosol and membrane fractions was analyzed in cultured pituitary gonadotrophs during treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). In pituitary cells purified by centrifugal elutriation, the extent of protein kinase C redistribution during GnRH stimulation was correlated with the enrichment of gonadotrophs. GnRH-stimulated release of luteinizing hormone (LH) from gonadotroph-enriched cells was accompanied by a rapid and dose-dependent decrease in cytosolic protein kinase C and by a corresponding increase in protein kinase C activity in the particulate fraction. Retinal directly inhibited the activity of cytosolic protein kinase C and also attenuated the release of LH from GnRH-stimulated gonadotrophs. These findings, and the ability of GnRH to cause rapid translocation of cytosolic protein kinase C to a membrane-associated form, suggest that hormonal activation of protein kinase C is an intermediate step in the stimulation of pituitary LH secretion by GnRH."

https://openalex.org/W1515758336,"Competition experiments were carried out on the hydrolysis of different substrates by beta-hexosaminidase A isolated from human liver. The results show that ganglioside GM2 in the presence of the GM2 activator protein and a new synthetic substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-N-acetylglucosaminide 6-sulfate, are hydrolyzed at the same active site on the alpha subunit of beta-hexosaminidase A, whereas 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-N-acetylglucosaminide is degraded predominantly by a different active site on the beta-subunit. This finding provides for the first time a possible molecular basis for the observation that, in variant B1 of the GM2 gangliosidoses, beta-hexosaminidase A has lost its activity toward GM2 ganglioside and the sulfated artificial substrate while being still able to hydrolyze the unsulfated artificial substrate at a normal rate. Furthermore, the finding that the GM2 activator protein inhibits the degradation of the sulfated substrate by beta-hexosaminidases A and S indicates that the alpha subunit common to both isoenzymes might provide a binding site for the activator protein."

https://openalex.org/W2023161185,"Immunoglobulin K genes are constructed during lymphocyte differentiation by the joining of two DNA elements, VK and JK, to form both a VKJK coding unit and a reciprocal recombination product. The two products formed in single VK-to-JK joining events can be directly isolated through the use of a retrovirally introduced recombination substrate. The structural analysis of a number of recombinants and the derivation of secondary recombination products define some of the basic features of the mechanism of immunoglobulin gene assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1527243881,"Heparan sulfate-rich proteoglycan is present on the surface of NMuMG mouse mammary epithelial cells. All of this cell surface fraction is lipophilic, assessed by intercalation into lipid vesicles, and requires proteolytic cleavage to be released from the cell surface. No proteoglycan is competitively displaced by heparin. The cell surface lipophilic proteoglycan constitutes 52-55% of the total cellular proteoglycan while the remaining proteoglycan is apparently intracellular, comprising a nonlipophilic fraction (35%) and a small (10-13%) lipophilic fraction. Trypsin or chymotrypsin cleaves a labile site between the region of the cell surface proteoglycan bearing the glycosaminoglycan chains and the cell-associated portion of the core protein, producing a proteoglycan that is nonlipophilic, has an increased bouyant density, and is smaller than the parent molecule. We refer to this proteoglycan as the ectodomain of the cell surface proteoglycan. The correlation between its cell surface location and lipophilic properties suggests that a hydrophobic domain of its core protein may anchor this proteoglycan in the plasma membrane. In vivo, the proteoglycan may be cleaved from this putative anchor, generating nonlipophilic proteoglycan present as a matrix component, or it may remain a membrane component, anchoring the cell directly to the extracellular matrix."

https://openalex.org/W1988130438,"The leukocyte-common antigen (L-CA or T200) includes a family of lymphoid and myeloid cell surface glycoproteins with apparent molecular weights from 180,000 to 240,000. We report a partial protein sequence for thymocyte L-CA containing 1073 amino acids predicted from cDNA clones isolated using an oligonucleotide probe. Only one segment (residues 347–368) is likely to cross the membrane, and peptide data suggest that sequences N-terminal to this are outside the cell, with residues 369–1073 inside. The cytoplasmic domain includes possible phosphorylation sites and an internal homology between residues 385–671 and 676–986. Analysis of B lymphocyte cDNA clones suggests that B cell and thymocyte mRNAs are identical in 3′ sequences, but size differences in Northern blots suggest 5′ sequences may differ."
https://openalex.org/W1997243880,"Wild-type and pseudorevertant signal peptides of the lamB gene product of Escherichia coli interact with lipid systems whereas a nonfunctional deletion mutant signal peptide does not. This conclusion is based on interaction of synthetic signal peptides with a lipid monolayer-water surface, conformational changes induced by presence of lipid vesicles in an aqueous solution of signal peptide, and capacities of the peptides to promote vesicle aggregation. Analysis of the signal sequences and previous conformational studies suggest that these lipid interaction properties may be attributable to the tendency of the functional signal peptides to adopt alpha-helical conformations. Although the possibility of direct interaction between the signal peptide and membrane lipids during protein secretion is controversial, the results suggest that conformationally related amphiphilicity and consequent membrane affinity of signal sequences are important for function in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1604513294,"Phospholamban, the putative protein regulator of the Ca2+ pump of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum, was purified to apparent homogeneity from canine cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles by selective extraction with sodium cholate, followed by adsorption to calcium oxalate, solubilization in Zwittergent 3-14, and specific elution from p-hydroxymercuribenzoate-agarose. Phospholamban, isolated in the dephosphorylated state, was purified 80-fold in 15% yield (approximately 2 mg of phospholamban/g of sarcoplasmic reticulum protein). Nondissociated phospholamban exhibited an apparent Mr = 25,000 in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Partially dissociated phospholamban, induced by boiling in sodium dodecyl sulfate, exhibited five distinct mobility forms in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, of apparent molecular weights between 5,000-6,000 and 25,000. Phospholamban was phosphorylated to a level of 190 nmol of Pi/mg of protein by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, consistent by minimum stoichiometry with a subunit molecular weight of approximately 5,000. Phospholamban prepared by the present method was different in several respects from the proteins that have been isolated in other laboratories. Pure phospholamban was cysteine rich, containing 6 residues/100 amino acid residues. Dephosphorylated phospholamban was strongly basic with a pI = 10; phosphorylation decreased the pI to approximately 6.7. Pure phospholamban (and phospholamban present in sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles) was not readily extracted into acidified chloroform/methanol, suggesting that the protein does not behave as an acidic proteolipid. The purified protein was highly antigenic. Phospholamban was localized by immunochemical methods to cardiac membranes enriched in sarcoplasmic reticulum, but was absent from sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes prepared from fast skeletal muscle. The method described for isolation of cardiac phospholamban is highly reproducible and relatively simple, and should be useful for further detailed studies designed to probe the molecular structure of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1538959703,"We have identified in Bacillus subtilis an analogue of the Escherichia coli RecA protein. Its activities suggest that it has a corresponding role in general genetic recombination and in regulation of SOS (DNA repair) functions. The B. subtilis protein (B. subtilis Rec) has a Mr of 42,000 and cross-reacts with antisera raised against E. coli RecA protein. Its level is significantly reduced in the recombination-deficient recE4 mutant. B. subtilis Rec is induced 10- to 20-fold in rec+ strains following treatment with mitomycin C, whereas it is not induced in the recombination-deficient mutants recE4, recE45, and recA1. We have purified B. subtilis Rec about 2000-fold to near homogeneity and we describe its activities. It catalyzes DNA-dependent hydrolysis of dATP at a rate comparable to that of E. coli RecA protein. However, B. subtilis Rec has a negligible ATPase activity, although ATP effectively inhibits dATP hydrolysis. In the presence of dATP, B. subtilis Rec catalyzes DNA strand transfer, assayed by the conversion of phi X174 linear duplex DNA and homologous circular single-stranded DNA to replicative form II (circular double-stranded DNA with a discontinuity in one strand). ATP does not support strand transfer by this protein. B. subtilis Rec catalyzes proteolytic cleavage of E. coli LexA repressor in a reaction that requires single-stranded DNA and nucleoside triphosphate. This result suggests that an SOS regulatory system like the E. coli system is present in B. subtilis. The B. subtilis enzyme does not promote any detectable cleavage of the E. coli bacteriophage lambda repressor."
https://openalex.org/W1546967816,"The effect of tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) or urokinase on the specific binding of human Glu-plasminogen to fibrin I formed in plasma by clotting with Reptilase was studied using 125I-plasminogen and 131I-fibrinogen. In the absence of TPA, small amounts of plasminogen were bound to fibrin I. TPA induced binding of plasminogen to plasma fibrin I that was dependent upon the concentrations of TPA and plasminogen as well as upon the time of incubation. Plasminogen binding occurred in association with fibrin clot lysis and the formation in the clot supernatant of alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor-plasmin complexes. Urokinase also induced binding of plasminogen to plasma fibrin I that was concentration- and time-dependent. The molecular form of plasminogen bound to the fibrin I plasma clot was identified as Glu-plasminogen by dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by fast performance liquid chromatography. Further studies demonstrated that fibrin I formed from fibrinogen that had been progressively degraded by plasmin-bound Glu-plasminogen. The mole ratio of plasminogen bound increased with the time of plasmin digestion. Glu-plasminogen did not bind to fibrin I formed from fibrinogen progressively digested by human leukocyte elastase, thereby demonstrating the specificity of plasmin. These studies demonstrate that plasminogen activators regulate the binding of Glu-plasminogen to fibrin I by catalyzing plasmin-mediated modifications in the fibrin substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2071443658,"Mammalian atria contain peptides that promote the excretion of salt and water from the kidney. When rat atrial tissue is extracted under conditions known to inhibit proteolysis, four natriuretic peptides, cardionatrins I to IV, are consistently isolated. These peptides derive from a common precursor, preprocardionatrin, of 152 amino acids, whose sequence was determined by DNA sequencing of a complementary DNA clone. Amino acid sequencing located the start points of cardionatrins I, III, and IV in the overall sequence. Cardionatrin IV most closely resembles procardionatrin because it begins immediately after the signal sequence at residue 25. Cardionatrin III begins at residue 73, and cardionatrin I, sequenced previously, begins at residue 123. Compositional analysis indicated that each of these cardionatrins extends up to tyrosine at position 150 but lacks the terminal two arginine residues."
https://openalex.org/W1516032939,"Protein kinase C incorporates phosphate into two sites of myosin light chain kinase (MLC-kinase) in the absence of calmodulin. Phosphorylation is all but abolished in the presence of Ca2+ and calmodulin, suggesting that both sites of phosphorylation are close to the calmodulin binding site. The phosphorylation of MLC-kinase results in an approximately 10-fold increase in the dissociation constant of MLC-kinase for calmodulin. Following phosphorylation (2 mol/mol of enzyme) of MLC-kinase by protein kinase C, an additional 2 mol of phosphate can be incorporated into the MLC-kinase apoenzyme by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Different maps of phosphopeptides were obtained by tryptic hydrolysis from MLC-kinase preparations phosphorylated by each kinase. The phosphorylation sites for the cAMP-dependent kinase were located in a fragment of approximately 25,000 daltons. In contrast the phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C are found in a much smaller tryptic peptide. These results suggest that the phosphorylation sites on MLC-kinase are different for protein kinase C and for cAMP-dependent protein kinase. However, phosphorylation in both regions results in a reduced affinity for calmodulin."
https://openalex.org/W1535759476,"The relationship between phosphorylation ratio [( ATP])/[ADP][Pi], phosphocreatine (PCr)/Pi, and ATPase activity was determined for isolated rat heart mitochondria, and the use of phosphorylation ratio and/or PCr/Pi as bioenergetic indices (Chance, B., Eleff, S., Leigh, J. S., Sokolow, D., and Sapega, A. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78, 6714-6718) was evaluated. Isolated rat heart mitochondria were suspended at low concentration (0.5-2.0 mg of protein/ ml) in oxygenated KCl/sucrose/4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid medium at 25 degrees C and pyruvate, malate, PCr, ATP, Pi, and Mg2+ were added. Changes in extramitochondrial phosphorus compounds were followed by 31P NMR. The ATPase activity was varied by the addition of potato apyrase. It was found that the logarithm of steady state PCr/Pi decreased linearly with increasing ATPase rate with a PCr/Pi intercept of 32.8 at 0 ATPase rate. The log phosphorylation ratio was also linearly related to the ATPase rate with an extrapolated maximum value of 6.87 at 0 ATPase rate, corresponding to a phosphorylation ratio of 7.41 X 10(6) M(-1) and a delta GATP of -16.3 kcal. The phosphorylation ratio in these experiments (for state 4 respiration) was greater by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude than previously reported for either isolated mitochondria or for whole tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1535311054,"Three membrane-bound adenosine triphosphatases were investigated for homology in the sequence of four amino acids about the active site of phosphorylation. The ATPases were as follows: sodium-potassium-dependent ATPase from dog kidney, Na,K-ATPase; hydrogen-potassium-dependent ATPase from hog gastric mucosa, H,K-ATPase, an ATPase similar to Na,K-ATPase; and an ATPase activity in the plasma membrane of corn, Zea mays, roots (CR-ATPase), a higher plant ATPase. A membrane preparation containing an ATPase of Acholeplasma laidlawii, a prokaryote, (AL) was also investigated. For most of the experiments, the preparations were phosphorylated from [gamma-32P]ATP, denatured in acid, and subjected to proteolytic digestion. Radioactive phosphopeptides were separated by high voltage paper electrophoresis and characterized by sensitivity to chemical reagents. In gastric H,K-ATPase, the aspartate residue at the active site was determined directly by labeling with [3H]borohydride. A common sequence around the active site was found for Na,K-ATPase, H,K-ATPase, and CR-ATPase. This sequence, -Cys-(Ser/Thr)-Asp(P)-Lys-, is similar to that in the calcium ion-transport ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum. The AL membrane preparation showed an acylphosphate that turned over rapidly after a chase of labeled membranes with unlabeled ATP. The corresponding sequence was different from that of the three ATPases. An acylphosphate was on two polypeptides with molecular weights of about 80,000 and 60,000; these appear not to correspond to subunits of a Na+-stimulated ATPase in this organism (Lewis, R. N. A. H., and McElhaney, R. N. (1983) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 735, 113-122)."
https://openalex.org/W1571240797,"Phospholamban, a putative regulator of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ transport, has been shown to be phosphorylated in vitro by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and an intrinsic Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity. This study was conducted to determine if Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of phospholamban occurs in response to physiologic increases in intracellular Ca2+ in intact myocardium. Isolated guinea pig and rat ventricles were perfused with 32Pi after which membrane vesicles were isolated from individual hearts by differential centrifugation. Administration of isoproterenol (10 nM) to perfused hearts stimulated 32P incorporation into phospholamban, Ca2+-ATPase activity, and Ca2+ uptake of sarcoplasmic reticulum isolated from these hearts. These biochemical changes were associated with increases in contractility and shortening of the t 1/2 of relaxation. Elevated extracellular Ca2+ produced comparable increases in contractility but failed to stimulate phospholamban phosphorylation or Ca2+ transport and did not alter the t 1/2 of relaxation. Inhibition of trans-sarcolemmal Ca2+ influx by perfusing the ventricles with reduced extracellular Ca2+ (50 microM) attenuated the increases in 32P incorporation produced by 10 nM isoproterenol. Trifluoperazine (10 microM) also attenuated isoproterenol-induced increases in 32P incorporation into phospholamban. In both cases, Ca2+ transport was reduced to a degree comparable to the reduction in phospholamban phosphorylation. These results suggest that direct physiologic increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration do not stimulate phospholamban phosphorylation in intact functioning myocardium. Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of phospholamban may occur in response to agents which stimulate cAMP-dependent mechanisms in intact myocardium."
https://openalex.org/W1564173530,"Ca2+ and Mg2+ movements across the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of frog skeletal muscle fibers were measured in situ by electron probe microanalysis of muscles rapidly frozen following a tetanus. At 400 ms following a 1.2-s tetanus at room temperature, the force had relaxed to base-line, and 0.3 mmol of Ca2+/liter of cytoplasmic H2O had been pumped by the SR, indicating that the in situ pumping of the SR Ca-ATPase is sufficiently high to account for the removal of Ca2+ from the Ca2+-specific sites of troponin (0.18 mmol of Ca2+-specific sites/liter of cytoplasmic H2O) and for the rate of relaxation from a tetanus at room temperature. The half-time of the return of the total 1.0 mmol of Ca2+/liter of cytoplasmic H2O released during a tetanus was 1.1 s, comparable to the slow Koff rate of Ca2+ from (carp) parvalbumin (1.0 s-1) and consistent with the hypothesis that the return of this Ca2+ to the terminal cisternae is rate-limited by the Ca2+ off-rate from parvalbumin. The return of the Mg2+ taken up by the terminal cisternae during a tetanus to resting levels was significantly slower than the time course of the Ca2+ movements, suggesting that the Mg2+ permeability of the SR in situ is low and may be transiently increased during tetanic stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1528461761,"Heparan sulfate proteoglycans were extracted from rat brain microsomal membranes or whole forebrain with deoxycholate and purified from accompanying chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and membrane glycoproteins by ion-exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography on lipoprotein lipase-Sepharose, and gel filtration. The proteoglycan has a molecular size of approximately 220,000, containing glycosaminoglycan chains of Mr = 14,000-15,000. In [3H]glucosamine-labeled heparan sulfate proteoglycans, approximately 22% of the radioactivity is present in glycoprotein oligosaccharides, consisting predominantly of N-glycosidically linked tri- and tetraantennary complex oligosaccharides (60%, some of which are sulfated) and O-glycosidic oligosaccharides (33%). Small amounts of chondroitin sulfate (4-6% of the total glycosaminoglycans) copurified with the heparan sulfate proteoglycan through a variety of fractionation procedures. Incubation of [35S]sulfate-labeled microsomes with heparin or 2 M NaCl released approximately 21 and 13%, respectively, of the total heparan sulfate, as compared to the 8-9% released by buffered saline or chondroitin sulfate and the 82% which is extracted by 0.2% deoxycholate. It therefore appears that there are at least two distinct types of association of heparan sulfate proteoglycans with brain membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1504543834,"Specific binding of the Ca2+ channel blocker [3H] verapamil to a membrane fraction from plants has been characterized. Binding to zucchini membranes was saturable and reversible. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant is KD = 102 nM and the maximum number of binding sites is Bmax = 60 pmol/mg of protein. The KD determined from the association and dissociation rate constants is 130 nM. [3H]Verapamil binding to zucchini membranes could not be inhibited by the Ca2+ antagonists nifedipine and diltiazem. However, [3H]verapamil could be displaced by diltiazem but not by nifedipine from corn membranes. Sucrose density fractionation of zucchini membrane preparations revealed that [3H]verapamil binding sites are located primarily at the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1577415753,"The bacteriophage T4 uvsX gene codes for a DNA-binding protein that is important for genetic recombination in T4-infected cells. This protein is a DNA-dependent ATPase that resembles the Escherichia coli recA protein in many of its properties. We have examined the binding of purified uvsX protein to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) using electron microscopy to visualize the complexes that are formed and double label analysis to measure their protein content. We find that the uvsX protein binds cooperatively to dsDNA, forming filaments 14 nm in diameter with an apparently helical axial repeat of 12 nm. Each repeat contains about 42 base pairs and 9-12 uvsX protein monomers. In solutions containing Mg2+, the uvsX protein also binds cooperatively to ssDNA. The filaments that result are 14 nm in diameter, show a 12-nm axial repeat, and they are nearly identical in appearance to the filaments that contain dsDNA. In the filaments formed along ssDNA, each axial repeat contains about 49 DNA bases and 9-12 uvsX monomers. Both the filaments formed on the ssDNA and dsDNA show a strong tendency to align side-by-side. T4 gene 32 protein also binds cooperatively to ssDNA and interacts both physically and functionally with uvsX protein. However, when gene 32 and uvsX proteins were added to ssDNA together, no interaction between the two proteins was detected."
https://openalex.org/W1609872692,"Fibrinogen New York 1 (NY-1) was identified in a family with a thrombotic tendency. Studies on fibrinogen NY-1 and the fibrinogen from her brother, designated NY-1a, showed that both have abnormal thrombin-nonclottable fibrinogen (50% of the total fibrinogen in NY-1 and 35-40% in NY-1a) and that the trait is heterozygous and autosomal codominant. The abnormal fibrinogen polymerizes in the presence of calcium and can be further cross-linked by Factor XIIIa. The release rates of fibrinopeptides A and B by thrombin from both (NY-1 and NY-1a) were slower than those from normal fibrinogen. Two mol of fibrinopeptide A but only 0.6-1.0 (NY-1) or 1.0-1.3 (NY-1a) mol of fibrinopeptide B were released per mol of fibrinogen. Additionally, only 1.0 (NY-1) or 1.3 (NY-1a) mol of the B beta(1-42) peptide were released by plasmin/mol. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the reduced fibrinogen revealed two protein bands in the B beta-chain region (Mr = 54,000 as compared with 57,300 for the normal). When NY-1a fibrinogen was treated with CNBr, two sizes of the NH2-terminal disulfide knot were obtained (Mr = 59,000 and 49,000). The Mr = 49,000 component is consistent with an abnormal NH2-terminal disulfide knot with two defective NH2-terminal B beta-chains. Amino acid sequence analyses demonstrated that the abnormal B beta-chain is the result of a deletion in the sequence from residues 9 to 72. This deletion corresponds exactly to exon 2 of the gene. Since this family has a thrombotic tendency, the defect in the fibrinogen may be important in the pathogenesis of thrombosis in this family."
https://openalex.org/W1570947397,"The objective of the present work was to investigate the mechanism of alloxan-induced Ca2+ release from rat liver mitochondria. Transport of Ca2+, oxidation and hydrolysis of mitochondrial pyridine nucleotides, changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential, and oxygen consumption by mitochondria were investigated. Alloxan does not inhibit the uptake of Ca2+ but stimulates the release of Ca2+ from liver mitochondria, which is accompanied by oxidation and hydrolysis of pyridine nucleotides. Oxidation of mitochondrial pyridine nucleotides by alloxan is not mediated by glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase and may occur largely nonenzymatically. Measurements of the mitochondrial membrane potential in combination with inhibitors of Ca2+ reuptake indicate that Ca2+ release takes place from intact liver mitochondria via a distinct pathway. Limited redox cycling of alloxan by mitochondria is indicated by measurements of the membrane potential and O2 consumption in the presence of cyanide. It is concluded that alloxan can cause Ca2+ release from intact rat liver mitochondria. Redox cycling of alloxan is not significantly involved in the Ca2+ release mechanism. Oxidation and hydrolysis of pyridine nucleotides, possibly in conjunction with oxidation of critical sulfhydryl groups, seem to be key events in the alloxan-induced Ca2+ release. Disturbance of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis may partly explain alloxan toxicity."

https://openalex.org/W1547746238,"It was previously reported that 2‘,3‘-O-(2,4,6-trinitrocyclohexadienylidene) (TNP)-nucleotides bind with high affinity to the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (Dupont, Y., Chapron, Y., and Pougeois, R. (1982) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 106, 1272-1279 and Watanabe, T., and Inesi, G. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 11510-11516). Here we report a study of the Ca-ATPase nucleotide binding sites using TNP-nucleotides. Competition at equilibrium between TNP-nucleotides and ATP was measured in the absence of calcium; it was found that TNP-nucleotides and ATP competitively bind to two classes of sites of equal concentration (3.5 nmol/mg). The ATP dissociation constants for the two classes of sites were found to be sensitive to H+ and Mg2+ concentrations. In the absence of Mg2+ (independently of pH) or at acid pH (independently of Mg2+ concentration), the nucleotide sites behave like one single family of sites of intermediate affinity (Kd = 20 microM). They split into two classes of sites of high (Kd = 2-4 microM) and low (Kd greater than 1 mM) affinity at pH values higher than neutral and in the presence of Mg2+. The calcium-activated ATP hydrolysis is accelerated by TNP-ATP (or TNP-AMP-PNP) binding on the phosphorylated enzyme. It is concluded 1) that the Ca-ATPase enzyme possesses two classes of ATP binding sites, 2) that the affinity of these two sites and the nature of their interaction is modulated by the H+ and Mg2+ concentrations, and 3) that the hydrolytic activity of the high affinity ATP binding site is activated by ATP or TNP-AMP-PNP (or TNP-ATP) binding in a low affinity ATP binding site."

https://openalex.org/W1572882967,"H+ and Ca2+ concentration changes in the reaction medium following MgATP addition at pH 6.0 were determined with the partially purified Ca-ATPase from sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles in the presence of 25-50 microM CaCl2 and 5 mM MgCl2 at 4 degrees C. Previously, we showed a sequential occurrence of H+ binding and H+ dissociation in the Ca-ATPase during ATP hydrolysis and further suggested that the H+ binding takes place inside the vesicles (Yamaguchi, M., and Kanazawa, T. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 9526-9531). The present results demonstrate that the H+ binding occurred coincidently with Ca2+ dissociation from the enzyme upon conversion of the phosphoenzyme (EP) intermediate from the ADP-sensitive form to the ADP-insensitive form in the catalytic cycle of ATP hydrolysis. As KCl decreased in the medium, the extent of the H+ binding increased almost proportionately with the extent of either the Ca2+ dissociation or the accumulation of ADP-insensitive EP. Both the H+ binding and the Ca2+ dissociation were prevented by a modification of the specific SH group of the enzyme essential for the conversion of ADP-sensitive EP to ADP-insensitive EP. In the late stage of the reaction, H+ dissociation from the enzyme occurred coincidently with Ca2+ binding to the dephosphoenzyme which was formed by EP decomposition. These results are consistent with the possibility that the H+ ejection during the Ca2+ uptake with the intact vesicles previously shown by several investigators takes place through a Ca2+/H+ exchange directly mediated by the membrane-bound Ca-ATPase."

The oxygen exchange was determined for isometrically held fibers by measuring with a mass spectrometer the distribution of 18O atoms in the product inorganic phosphate when ATP hydrolysis was carried out in H2(18)O. The extent of exchange was much greater in relaxed muscle (free Ca2+ less than 10(-8) M) than in calcium-activated muscle (free Ca2+ approximately equal to 3 X 10(-5) M). Activated fibers had an ATPase activity at least 30-fold greater than the relaxed fibers. These results correlate well with the extents of oxygen exchange accompanying magnesium-dependent myosin and unregulated actomyosin ATPase activities, respectively. In relaxed fibers, comparison of the amount of exchange with the ATPase activity suggests that the rate constant for the reformation of myosin-bound ATP from the myosin products complex is about 10 s-1 at 20 degrees C and pH 7.1. In each experiment the distribution of 18O in the Pi formed was incompatible with a single pathway for ATP hydrolysis. In the case of the calcium-activated fibers, the multiple pathways for ATP hydrolysis appeared to be an intrinsic property of the actomyosin ATPase in the fiber. These results indicate that in muscle fibers, as in isolated actomyosin, cleavage of protein-bound ATP is readily reversible and that association of the myosin products complex with actin promotes Pi release."
https://openalex.org/W1502253820,"The complex nature of the brain 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase isozymes was examined by elution with a discontinuous gradient from QAE (quaternary aminoethyl)-Sephadex. In the first wash (150 mM NaCl), where the rat muscle 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase isozyme (M4) eluted, about 40% of the total brain 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase activity washed through without exhibiting a sharp peak. In the second elution (300 mM NaCl), the remaining activity eluted in a sharp peak that preceded where the major rat liver 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase isozyme (L4) eluted. Enzyme activity in brain extracts or purified brain isozymes was titrated above 90% with M4 anti-IgG and 20% with L4 anti-IgG. A purification procedure was developed which resulted in a recovery of 70 to 80% of the original enzyme activity in brain 100,000 X g supernatant fluids. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on slab gels and detection by silver staining indicated that three components were present with apparent molecular weights of 87,500, 85,000, and 80,000. The 85,000- and 80,000-dalton components corresponded to the subunits of M4 and L4, respectively. The third component (C type) was thought to be an actual subunit since it exhibited the highest molecular weight and was present in an exhaustively washed immunoprecipitate of the purified brain isozymes. From 10 different purifications of the brain enzyme, the subunit distributions of the liver, muscle, and C-type subunit were 1.4 +/- 0.2, 4.9 +/- 0.5, and 3.9 +/- 0.3, respectively. A comparison of the kinetic properties of purified liver, muscle, and brain isozymes clearly demonstrated that all three preparations had quantitatively different regulatory properties. All three subunits were present in different regions of the brain, and region-specific changes in total activity and the relative amounts of each subunit were observed. This study suggests that brain 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase is a complex mixture of homotetramers and hybrids which are composed of different amounts of the three subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1553510508,"Abstract Using [U-14C]phosphatidylinositol as substrate, Ca2+-dependent phospholipase C activity was detected in a group of bovine adrenal medullary proteins that bind to chromaffin granule membranes in the presence of Ca2+ (chromobindins, Creutz, C. E., Dowling, L. G., Sando, J. J., Villar-Palasi, C., Whipple, J. H., and Zaks, W. J. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 14664-14674). The activity was maximal at neutral pH and represented an 80- to 240-fold enrichment of adrenal medullary cytosol phospholipase C activity measured at pH 7.3. The stimulation of activity by Ca2+ was complex; no activity was present in the absence of Ca2+, 25% activation occurred at 1 microM Ca2+, and full activation at 5 mM Ca2+. The enzyme bound to chromaffin granule membranes in the presence of 2 mM Ca2+ but was released at 40 microM Ca2+, suggesting that intrinsic enzyme activity may be regulated by [Ca2+] at 1 microM, but additional activation at higher concentrations of Ca2+ is seen in vitro as a result of Ca2+-dependent binding of the active enzyme to substrate-containing membranes. This enzyme may generate diacylglycerol and phosphorylated inositol to act as intracellular messengers in the vicinity of the chromaffin granule membrane during the process of exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1546742943,"13C NMR spectroscopic investigations on the biosynthesis of mycotoxins produced by Fusarium graminearum (M69) were carried out through the incorporation of [1-13C]- and [2-13C]acetate precursors. The major secondary metabolites produced by this species in still culture were deoxynivalenol (3,7,15-trihydroxy-12,13-epoxytrichothec-9-en-one), 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol, zearalenone, and butenolide. [1-13C]- and [2-13C]acetate were incorporated in alternate carbon atoms in zearalenone, consistent with the head to tail condensation of nine acetate units. The trichothecenes were enriched in a manner consistent with the condensation of three mevalonate units. 13C/13C couplings, observed between C-5 and C-12, as well as between C-6 and C-15 of 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol, confirms the current hypothesis of formation of the trichothecene ring system by cyclization of farnesyl pyrophosphate. The incorporation pattern in ergosterol is also consistent with a mevalonate origin, while the adjacent incorporation of acetate methyl groups in butenolide suggests a glutamate precursor. The degree of enrichment in the secondary metabolites, which ranged from 3 to 10% at each carbon site, was observed in the 13C NMR spectra of the crude fungal extracts to be dependent on the timing of acetate addition to the culture. The specific toxins produced together with the quantity of each, were also found to be dependent on the timing of acetate addition. Competition between the three biosynthetic pathways of secondary metabolism, i.e. polyketide, mevalonate, and amino acid for the labeled acetate in this organism is a complex function of culture conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1490906226,"The role of ammonium ion and AMP deaminase (EC 3.5.4.6) reaction in the of phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11) and pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) by the decrease in the adenylate energy charge was investigated using permeabilized yeast cells. Response of AMP deaminase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase to variation in the energy charge is typical of the ATP-regenerating enzymes: an with the decrease in the energy charge under the in situ conditions. The addition of polyamine activated AMP deaminase in situ, resulting in the subsequent increase in ammonium production, which can stimulate the phosphofructokinase activity with the increase in the optimal energy charge value giving maximal activity of the enzyme. The optimal energy charge value of phosphofructokinase was 0.2-0.25 in the absence of ammonium ion and was shifted to the value above 0.5 by the addition of ammonium ion, whereas Pi, an activator of the enzyme showed little effect on the increase in the optimal energy charge value. The optimal energy charge value of AMP deaminase and pyruvate kinase was not affected by the addition of their effectors. Modulation of the response to the energy charge of phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase was analyzed in terms of the activation coefficient, which was defined as the ratio of the activity at the energy charge of 0.6 to that at the value of 0.9. Activation of phosphofructokinase by the physiological decrease in the energy charge (0.9 to 0.6) can be enhanced by the increase in ammonium ion specifically, although the coefficient of pyruvate kinase remained unaffected by ammonium ion. These results suggest that the AMP deaminase reaction as an ammonium-forming reaction can participate in a key role in the stimulation of phosphofructokinase or glycolytic flux in cells."
https://openalex.org/W1566137581,"6-Phosphofructo-1-kinase (phosphofructokinase) (ATP:D-fructose-6-P 1-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.11) can be identified in sheep heart homogenates in two forms, a soluble form and a form bound to the particulate fraction. Homogenates from immediately-dissected hearts have the enzyme in the soluble form, while those collected after a delay have the enzyme bound to the particulate fraction. Aldolase appears to show the same change in its location. Homogenization in a solution with concentrated macromolecular species (20% albumin) results in a greater association of phosphofructokinase and of aldolase to the particulate fraction in homogenates from immediately dissected hearts. Phosphofructokinase activity can be solubilized by two specific means: by high ionic strength, which is dependent upon specific salts; or by low ionic strength, which is dependent upon the presence of phosphofructokinase substrates or modifier ligands. These two means of solubilization are affected differently upon decreasing the pH below 6.9: the solubilization at low ionic strength is prevented, whereas phosphofructokinase is still solubilized by high ionic strength. Under the latter condition, the enzyme is in the inactive dimeric state, which can be activated at an alkaline pH. Myofibrils present in the particulate fraction can account for the binding of phosphofructokinase in heart homogenates. Purified myofibrils, when added to heart supernatant fluids, can bind phosphofructokinase at a slightly acidic pH. Conditions for phosphofructokinase binding to myofibrils, as well as its dissociation, follow what was observed with the binding of phosphofructokinase to the particulate fraction. At an acidic pH, and in the presence of a high concentration of ATP, phosphofructokinase exhibits low activity. However, if phosphofructokinase is assayed under these conditions while bound to myofibrils, the enzyme is activated."
https://openalex.org/W1501880454,"Highly purified 3'-arylazido-ATP (aATP) was obtained by high performance liquid chromatography. In the dark, this photoactivatable ATP analog was a competitive inhibitor of ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by purified sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) ATPase with a Ki of 10 microM. The analog itself was hydrolyzed by the enzyme in the dark. A biphasic curve of velocity of hydrolysis of the analog versus aATP concentration was obtained, indicating the presence of high and low affinity sites with K0.5 of approximately 10 microM and 300 microM, respectively. Upon irradiation with visible light, a biphasic curve was obtained for the level of covalent photolabeling of the enzyme versus [beta-32P]aATP concentrations. Levels of 6.5-9 nmol of analog/mg of protein and 20-22 nmol of analog/mg of protein were obtained when labeling with 20-30 or with 400 microM aATP, respectively, showing the existence of 1 mol of high affinity sites/mol of ATPase and 1-1.5 mol of low affinity sites/mol of enzyme. The rate of light-dependent incorporation of [beta-32P]aATP was decreased by the presence of ATP, Pi, 2',3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrocyclohexadienylidene-ATP, or Ca2+ in the illumination media. Photolabeling of the high affinity sites had little effect on the velocity of ATP hydrolysis but significantly inhibited the splitting of additional aATP added in the dark. Photolabeling the low affinity sites caused irreversible inhibition of the ATPase activity. The inhibition was prevented by having ATP in the illumination medium, which protected it from labeling. Gel filtration chromatography in the presence of detergent showed that radioactive photolabel was incorporated in the SR ATPase protein. The results indicate that aATP is a useful tool for stoichiometrically labeling and probing the nucleotide binding domains of the SR ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1552926290,"The monomer-dimer association constant of solubilized and delipidated sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase was measured by large zone elution gel chromatography in the presence of a high concentration (18.6 mM) of the nonionic detergent dodecyloctaethylene glycol monoether (C12E8) and of different ATPase protein concentrations in the range of 0.74 (6.4 nM monomers) to 30 (0.26 microM monomers) microgram/ml. The association equilibrium constant (Ka) obtained from the concentration-dependent dissociation curve was 9.37 X 10(7) M-1 at 24 degrees C. The derived free energy change (delta G0) for the monomer-dimer association was -10.8 kcal/mo, reflecting a high degree of tightness between inter-subunit domains in soluble dimeric ATPase. A steep dissociation curve within a short natural logarithmic span (2.5 units) was obtained when the degree of dissociation increased from 0.1 to 0.9, suggesting that a conformational drift accompanies the dissociation of soluble dimeric ATPase. A unique leading boundary was formed in the large zone chromatographies, indicating a reversible equilibrium which was rapid when compared to the time taken for the chromatographic run. Enzymatic activity was continuously monitored in the eluate, revealing that soluble ATPase at different degrees of dissociation was active."
https://openalex.org/W1604117869,"Abstract The Ca-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum was solubilized at pH 6.5 and 30 degrees C using different nonionic detergents, Triton X-100, C12E8, Lubrol PX, or Tween 20. After full solubilization by any of these detergents, the enzyme was unstable (t1/2 = 2-3 min) in the absence of Ca2+. The soluble enzyme was stable in the presence of calcium, half-maximal protection being attained in the presence of 0.2 mM Ca2+. In the absence of Ca2+, stability was restored by addition of co-solvents dimethyl sulfoxide or glycerol. In the presence of 4 mM Ca2+, the progressive addition of nonionic detergents to a medium containing leaky vesicles promoted an increase, up to 3-fold, in the rate of ATP hydrolysis. This was not observed when ITP was used as substrate. The small amount of ADP accumulated in the medium during ATP hydrolysis was sufficient to inhibit the ATPase activity of the membrane-bound enzyme but had no effect on the soluble enzyme. Increasing concentrations of detergent promoted a progressive inhibition of the ATP----Pi exchange reaction. The ATP hydrolysis/synthesis ratio of soluble enzyme was 10 times higher than that of membranous enzyme. Addition of co-solvent restored this ratio to values similar to those obtained with membrane-bound Ca-ATPase. Soluble enzyme prepared from native sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles was able to catalyze the net synthesis of ATP when phosphorylated by Pi in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide and then diluted in a medium containing 10 mM CaCl2 and 2 mM ADP. This was not observed when the soluble enzyme was prepared from purified Ca-ATPase. The results suggest that some of the partial reactions of the catalytic cycle of Ca-ATPase are dependent on the hydrophobic environment found in the native membrane. This environment can be mimicked by co-solvents."
https://openalex.org/W1968266210,"Antitermination is an important transcriptional control. In bacteriophage lambda, the presence of the nut antiterminators between the promoters and terminators results in relatively unhindered transcription when the lambda N gene product and necessary host factors are supplied. This antitermination system has been rendered thermosensitive by modification of the nut site. A fragment of λ DNA [74 base pairs (bp) in length] that contained the 17-bp nutL core sequence, but lacked the 8-bp boxA sequence, was cloned in a pp-N-tL1-galK plasmid between the pp promoter and gene N. This fragment mediated antitermination of transcription at 30°C, as measured by assaying galK gene expression in Escherichia coli. At 42°C, however, antitermination at the λ tL1 terminator was abolished. Antitermination at 42°C was restored by replacing the 74-bp nutL fragment with longer sequences containing both nutL and boxA or by cloning a synthetic boxA sequence ahead of the 74-bp nutL fragment. Thus, efficient antitermination required both boxA and the 17-bp nutL core, with the latter becoming conditionally defective when the boxA sequence was deleted."
https://openalex.org/W1537578831,"The tryptophan intrinsic fluorescence of the (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase from sarcoplasmic reticulum was quenched by acrylamide at different temperatures. Sharp increases in the quenching constants were found in samples of ATPase reconstituted with dimyristoyl-phosphatidylcholine and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine at temperatures slightly below the Tc transition temperature of the pure phospholipid. It is suggested that acrylamide may diffuse more easily through proteins surrounded by a fluid phospholipid matrix than if they are in a rigid matrix, due to different states of protein fluidity."
https://openalex.org/W192153535,"The rate of ATP hydrolysis by myosin at high concentrations with an ATP-regenerating system increases linearly with increasing added ATP up to a sharp break at the equivalence point of 1 ATP/myosin active site. Theoretical modeling indicates that the data require a KM on the order of the 30 nM value predicted by the rapid kinetic work (Lymn, R. W., and Taylor, E. W. (1970) Biochemistry 7, 2975-2983). Changes in the experimental conditions are found to change the slope of the initial increase in ATPase rate, but not to change the equivalence point. Proteolytic subfragments of myosin do not exhibit a linear initial increase in rate indicating that they are not homogeneous. Purified myosin is also found to show a small additional increase in ATPase rate at much higher ATP levels with a corresponding increase in flux through a pathway with a low extent of oxygen exchange. This high Km component with low oxygen exchange is distinct from the contaminating ATPase reported previously (Sleep, J. A., Hackney, D. D., and Boyer, P. D. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 4094-4099) which is shown here to be the CaATPase of the sarcoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1601773397,"The kinetics of ATP hydrolysis and cation effects on ATPase activity in plasma membrane from Candida albicans ATCC 10261 yeast cells were investigated. The ATPase showed classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics for the hydrolysis of Mg X ATP, with Km = 4.8 mM Mg X ATP. Na+ and K+ stimulated the ATPase slightly (9% at 20 mM). Divalent cations in combination with ATP gave lower ATPase activity than Mg X ATP (Mg greater than Mn greater than Co greater than Zn greater than Ni greater than Ca). Divalent cations inhibited the Mg X ATPase (Zn greater than Ni greater than Co greater than Ca greater than Mn). Free Mg2+ inhibited Mg X ATPase weakly (20% inhibition at 10 mM). Computed analyses of substrate concentrations showed that free Zn2+ inhibited Zn X ATPase, mixed (Zn2+ + Mg2+) X ATPase, and Mg X ATPase activities. Zn X ATP showed high affinity for ATPase (Km = 1.0 mM Zn X ATP) but lower turnover (52%) relative to Mg X ATP. Inhibition of Mg X ATPase by (free) Zn2+ was noncompetitive, Ki = 90 microM Zn2+. The existence of a divalent cation inhibitory site on the plasma membrane Mg X ATPase is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1503446501,"Lipid fluidity in native and denatured sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes and extracted lipids was monitored between -30 and 30 degrees C using trans-parinaric acid as a fluorescent probe. In addition to a large increase in fluidity between -30 and 0 degree C in each system, a phase change centered near 10 degrees C was observed in the extracted lipids but not in either the native or denatured membranes. A significant change in fluorescence intensity near 15 degrees C was observed in native sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes, however, when trans-parinaric acid was excited by energy transfer from tryptophan residues of the membrane protein. When Ca2+-ATPase was subjected to proteolytic cleavage by trypsin as a function of temperature, a change in susceptibility was detected at about 15-20 degrees C in the native membranes but not in a solubilized preparation. It is proposed that one or more structural changes in the microenvironment of Ca2+-ATPase in the native membrane occur between 15 and 20 degrees C which may be related to the change in apparent activation energy which is observed for this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1602814009,"The interactions of monovalent cations and of the K+-specific ionophore, valinomycin, with the Ca2+-ATPase of skeletal muscle of sarcoplasmic reticulum have been studied in the absence of cation gradients by their effects on enzyme turnover and on the ATP plus Ca2+-dependent enhanced fluorescence of the ATP analogue, 2',3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrocyclohexyldienylidine)-adenosine 5'-triphosphate (TNP-ATP) (Watanabe, T., and Inesi, G. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 11510-11516). Monovalent cations decreased turnover-dependent TNP-ATP fluorescence in the series K+ greater than Rb+ approximately equal to Cs+ greater than Na+ greater than Li+ (K0.5 = 49, 73, 75, 94, and 246 mM, respectively), consistent with the known specificity of the monovalent cation binding site that stimulates turnover and E-P hydrolysis. Valinomycin (200 nmol/mg), in the absence of monovalent cations, decreased ATPase activity by 30% and abolished the stimulatory effects of 150 mM KCl or NaCl on turnover. The ionophore alone enhanced TNP-ATP fluorescence by 20% and altered the specificity and affinity of the site that inhibited TNP-ATP fluorescence to Cs+ greater than Rb+ greater than K+ approximately equal to Na+ greater than Li+ (K0.5 = 79, 111, 134, 136, and 270 mM, respectively), which follows the Hofmeister series for effectiveness of monovalent lyotropic cations. TNP-ATP binding was not affected by either monovalent cations or valinomycin. Inhibition of turnover-dependent TNP-ATP fluorescence appears to be a useful parameter for monitoring monovalent cation binding to the Ca2+-ATPase. It is concluded that the ionophore interacts directly with the Ca2+-ATPase, independent of its K+ conductance effects on the lipid bilayer, and modifies the affinity and specificity of the monovalent cation site, either by direct interaction or by the formation of a valinomycin-monovalent cation-enzyme complex."
