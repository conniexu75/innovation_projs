With perhaps the single exception of the contribution of the nineteenth-century psychoanalysts, dream theories have been based on negligible experimental evidence and have never been sufficiently rigorous or explicit to attract serious scientific interest. The work of Dement, however, demonstrates what appears to be a convincing behavioural measure of dream periods and, though criticized on several counts, has had an undoubted effect from the point of view of stimulating further experimental investigations and theoretical considerations. We have ourselves recently proposed elsewhere2 that the dream process might be likened in function to the systematic programme clearance which is absolutely necessary where computer programmes are being continuously evolved to meet changing circumstances. The greater the change in circumstances being programmed for, the greater must be the amount of programme evolution and the more urgent the programme clear-out. In our view, the primary function of sleep is probably to allow such a clearing process to get under way without interference from external information; ‘dreams’ occur when the level of consciousness shifts for one reason or another and the clearing process is interrupted. Prolonged deprivation of the opportunity to dream would inevitably produce a breakdown in human efficiency, most probably in the region where novel situations must be handled. More recently yet, Kales et al.3 have attempted an experimental reappraisal of Dement's original findings; but, while depriving subjects of the opportunity to dream for a number of nights, they did not notice any significant deterioration in their performance in certain psychometric investigations. In substance they agree that dream-prevention leads to increased attempts on the part of subjects to dream, but noted no ‘psychic changes’ as the result of this deprivation. However, the apparent discrepancy between the results of Kales and those of Dement is not, we believe, serious for present theoretical interpretations of the dream-deprivation investigations, for a number of reasons which we shall consider here."

This communication presents evidence that interferon also inhibits the formation of the double-stranded form of RNA appearing in cells infected with Semliki forest virus (SFV).

Hartdegen and Rupley1 showed that the oxidation of a single tryptophan residue with iodine results in the loss of enzymatic activity. Hachimori et al.2 have oxidized the tryptophan residues of lysozyme with hydrogen peroxide, concluding that all the tryptophans in lysozyme are relatively refractory toward oxidation and that the destruction of 1.4 mole of this amino-acid per mole of the enzyme results in the loss of 95 per cent of the lytic activity. Hamiguchi and Kurono3 have examined the effect of 2-chloroethanol on the secondary structure of lysozyme; they reported that when the enzyme is treated with solvents varying in composition from 0 to 32 per cent 2-chloroethanol (v/v), there are spectral changes indicating the disruption of hydrophobic regions and the exposure of buried tryptophan residues, although the optical rotatory dispersion investigations show no alteration, of helix content. Only at higher concentrations of 2-chloroethanol does the helix content increase."

https://openalex.org/W2030417779,"ONE of the earliest observations of a physiological nature made by marine microbiologists was that marine bacteria prefer sea water or a solution of sodium chloride to fresh water in the medium for growth1. Recent studies have shown that the need of marine bacteria for sea water in chemically denned media represents a requirement for inorganic ions2 and that inorganic ions play at least two essential parts in the growth and survival of the cells. First, inorganic ions are required for the nutrition and metabolism of marine bacterial cells. Specific requirements for a number of the ions of sea water for growth3,4, oxidative metabolism5 and active transport6 have been demonstrated. Secondly, inorganic ions are required to prevent lysis of marine bacterial cells. Studies with a marine pseudomonad have shown that the requirement for inorganic salts to maintain the integrity of the cells in a suspending medium is not due to the osmotic activity of the salts in solution but to the fact that inorganic ions are intimately involved in maintaining the mucopeptide layer of the cell wall intact7."

In addition, an enzyme which hydrolysed lecithin was found in culture supernatants of haemolytic El Tor vibrio, but could not be detected in supernatants of either V. cholerae or non-haemolytic El Tor strains. (Three such El Tor strains were obtained from the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research through the courtesy of Dr. Felsenfeld)."

https://openalex.org/W2088332120,IT is known that blood density may be reduced by treatment with many biologically active materials. Patton observed1 a rise in the specific gravity of the larval haemolymph of Galleria mellonella following injection of LD50 doses of sodium arsenate. The rise in haemolymph specific gravity was observed in individuals which survived up to 3 h; in organisms surviving thereafter a gradual descent to normal values occurred.
