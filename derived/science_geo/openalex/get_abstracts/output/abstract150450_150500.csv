https://openalex.org/W2003165120,"Interleukin 6 (IL6) plays key roles in hematopoiesis, immune, and acute phase responses. Dysregulated IL6 expression is implicated in diseases such as atherosclerosis and arthritis. We have examined the functional effect of four polymorphisms in the IL6 promoter (−597G→A, −572G→C, −373AnTn, −174G→C) by identifying the naturally occurring haplotypes and comparing their effects on reporter gene expression. The results indicate different transcriptional regulation in the ECV304 cell line compared with the HeLa cell line, suggesting cell type-specific regulation of IL6 expression. The haplotypes showed functional differences in the ECV304 cell line; transcription was higher from the GG9/11G haplotype and lower from the AG8/12G allele. The differences suggest that more than one of the polymorphic sites is functional; the base differences at distinct polymorphic sites do not act independently of one another, and one polymorphism influences the functional effect of variation at other polymorphic sites. These results show that genetic polymorphisms in the promoter influence IL6 transcription not by a simple additive mechanism but rather through complex interactions determined by the haplotype.

IL6 is not constitutively expressed but is highly inducible and is produced in response to a number of inflammatory stimuli such as IL1, platelet-derived growth factor, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), bacterial products such as endotoxin, and viral infection. Glucocortocoids produced as part of the inflammatory response act to enhance some IL6 effects, such as acute phase protein synthesis, but down-regulate IL6 expression, providing a negative feedback pathway on the inflammatory response in vivo. Many cell types produce IL6 in response to noxious stimuli, including monocytes/macrophages (5.May L.T. Ghrayeb J. Santhanam U. Tatter S.B. Sthoeger Z. Helfgott D.C. Chiorazzi N. Grieninger G.

In IL6 knockout mice, the T cell-dependent antibody response is dramatically compromised in response to localized infection and tissue damage, with impairment of the response to certain viral infections; macrophage stimulation was also deficient (11.Fattori E.

IL6-deficient mice also show 20–40% reduced numbers of thymocytes and peripheral T cells, suggesting the involvement of IL6 in T cell proliferation.Dysregulated IL6 production is implicated in the pathology of several disease processes.

Blood. 1989; 74: 1360-1367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are the consequence of systemic overexpression of IL6, which induces polyclonal B cell activation and leads to hypergammaglobulinaemia and autoantibody production. IL6 is the key regulator of the acute phase protein, fibrinogen, which is an important risk factor for atherothrombotic disease and is implicated in thrombus and plaque formation. IL6 mRNA is present in atherosclerotic arteries at a 10–40-fold higher level than in non-atherosclerotic vessels (26.Seino Y. Ikeda U. Ikeda M. Yamamoto K. Misawa Y. Hasegawa T. Kano S. Shimada K. Cytokine. 1994; 6: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). These results suggest the involvement of IL6 in the development of human atherosclerosis. Many of the pleiotropic effects of IL6, such as its ability to stimulate differentiation of monocytes to macrophages (27.Kishimoto T. Hibi M. Murakami M. Narazaki M. Saito M. Taga T. Ciba Found. Symp. 1992; 167: 5-16PubMed Google Scholar), may be relevant to the growth of the atherosclerotic plaque.Circulating levels of IL6 are largely regulated at the level of expression, due to the rapid plasma clearance of this cytokine (28.Castell J.V. Geiger T. Gross V. Andus T. Walter E. Hirano T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The transcription of this molecule is tightly regulated by the transcription factors NFIL6, NFκB, Fos/Jun, CRBP, and the glucocorticoid receptor. Experiments in HeLa cells showed the region −180 to −123 in the promoter to be crucial for transcription induction with viruses, second messengers, and cytokines such as IL1, TNFα, platelet-derived growth factor, and epidermal growth factor (29.Ray A. Tatter S.B. May L.T. Sehgal P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6701-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 30.Isshiki H. Akira S. Tanabe O. Nakajima T. Shimamoto T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2757-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Activation of the IL6 promoter involves synergism between the transcription factor NFIL6 (−158 to −145), and the transcription NFκB (−73 to −64) (31.Matsusaka T. Fujikawa K. Nishio Y. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10193-10197Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 32.Ray A. Prefontaine K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Potent repression of IL6 expression by steroid hormones such as glucocorticoids and estrogen does not appear to involve high affinity binding of the estrogen receptor or the glucocorticoid receptor to IL6 DNA (33.Ray A. LaForge K.S. Sehgal P.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5736-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 34.Ray A. LaForge K.S. Sehgal P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7086-7090Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 35.Ray A. Prefontaine K.E. Ray P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12940-12946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rather, the estrogen receptor and glucocorticoid receptor ligand complexes interact directly with the transcription factors NFIL6 and NFκB, inhibiting DNA binding and thus repressing transcription (36.Ray P. Ghosh S.K. Zhang D.H. Ray A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Thus, IL6 transcription is regulated by co-ordination among factors binding at distinct sites in the promoter.Polymorphisms in the promoter region of the IL6 gene may result in inter-individual variation in transcription and expression. Genetic variants could therefore influence an individual's susceptibility to a diverse range of diseases. There are precedents for this; for example, the TNFα −308TNF2 allele is associated with elevated risk of cerebral malaria (37.McGuire W. Knight J.C. Hill A.V. Allsopp C.E. Greenwood B.M. Kwiatkowski D. J. Infect. Dis. 1999; 179: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). It has been shown that a polymorphism in the 5′ flanking region of the IL6 gene at position −174 (G→C) appears to affect IL6 transcription, and the presence of the C allele may be associated with systemic onset juvenile chronic arthritis (19.Fishman D. Faulds G. Jeffery R. Mohamed Ali V. Yudkin J.S. Humphries S. Woo P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1369-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar). Understanding the influence of genetic variation on the control of IL6 expression may provide insight into inter-individual variation in disease risk and underlying pathogenesis.Polymorphisms do not exist in isolation, and it may be the combination of base changes at several sites, i.e. the haplotype, that influences function. We describe here two point substitutions in the 5′ region of the IL6 promoter at position −572 (G→C), and position −597 (G→A) and study the effect of the previously described −373 AT run polymorphism and the −174 (G→C) point substitution. The position of these polymorphic sites relative to transcription factor binding sites is illustrated in Fig. 1. We aimed to identify the common promoter haplotypes present in a population, and assess the functional consequences of these haplotypes on transcriptional control, in response to activating and inhibitory stimuli in different cell types.RESULTSHaplotype Frequency for Point Substitutions (−174G→C, −572G→C, −597G→A)The haplotypes for the three point substitutions in the promoter region of the IL6 gene, for 182 unrelated individuals, are shown in Table IV.Table IVHaplotype frequencies for 3-point substitutions of the IL6 promoter in 182 control individualsAGCGGGGCGGGCAGGTotalNo.1471951921364Haplotype frequency0.400.540.050.0060.0031.00Haplotypes are indicated in the order: −597G→A, −572G→C, −174G→C.

The 8A/12T allele was shown to be associated with the −597A allele and the −174C allele in all but one case. The −597G and −174G alleles showed more diversity in the associated AnTn alleles, with 9A/11T, 10A/10T, 10A/11T, and an allele with a deletion of the G residue adjacent to the upstream end of the AnTn run identified. The rare −572C allele (0.052) was always associated with the −597G, −174G and 10A/10T alleles. The four most common haplotypes were: −597A −572G 8A/12T −174C; −597G −572G 10A/11T −174G; −597G −572G 9A/11T −174G; −597G −572G 10A/10T −174G.Table VFrequency for complete IL6 haplotypes in 39 control individualsHaplotypesAG8/12CGG10/11GGG9/11GGG10/10GGC10/10GAG8/12GGG1̂0/11GGG9/11CNo.28191495111Frequency0.360.240.180.120.060.010.010.01Haplotypes are indicated in the order: −597G→A, −572G→C, −373AnTn, −174G→C. ^ indicates a G nucleotide deletion adjacent to the AnTn run.

There was no significant difference between the two alleles at any of the time points studied (Fig. 3). Both alleles showed a significant reduction in expression when treated with IL1 and dexamethasone compared with IL1 alone (Fig. 2). Dexamethasone did not reduce IL1 induction of the IL6 promoter to untreated levels (−174G allele = 3.47 ± 0.57, −174C allele = 5.03 ± 1.15). In contrast to HeLa cells, ECV304 cells showed no IL1 induction of transcription with these shorter constructs (Fig. 2).Figure 2Effect of the −211 to +13 region of the IL6 promoter on CAT expression in HeLa cells (panel A) and in ECV304 cells (panel B) for the two alleles at the −174 position.

Open table in a new tab There was no significant difference among the individual +641+13 clones in the untreated state, when treated with IL1 alone or in the presence of IL1 and dexamethasone, in the HeLa cell line.ECV304 Cell LineIn the ECV304 cell line, all −641+13 constructs showed a significant stimulation of expression with IL1. Dexamethasone significantly reduced IL1-stimulated expression for all haplotypes. Dexamethasone reduced expression to a level not significantly different from unstimulated expression levels, with the exception of the AG8/12C construct, which showed significantly higher expression in the untreated state compared with the dexamethasone-inhibited state (p < 0.005) but the absolute difference was small (0.52- versus 1.18-fold).In the ECV304 cells, there were significant differences between certain long clones. In the untreated state, the haplotype AG8/12C showed significantly higher expression than all other clones (p < 0.005), but, again, the absolute difference was small (1.51 versus 1.23 to 0.83). When stimulated with IL1, the GG9/11G clone showed significantly higher expression (5.02 ± 0.60-fold induction) than all other clones (1.9 ± 0.23 to 3.0 ± 0.52) (p < 0.005). The AG8/12G haplotype showed significantly lower IL1-stimulated expression than the clone differing only at the −174 site, AG8/12C (p < 0.0005), as well as the GG9/11G clone (p < 0.00005), the GG10/11G clone (p < 0.0006), and the GG10/10G clone (p < 0.00005), but was not significantly different from the GC10/10G clone.In the presence of dexamethasone, there were also significant differences between haplotypes, with the GG10/11G haplotype (0.77 ± 0.02) showing significantly lower expression (greater repression) than the GG9/11G (1.27 ± 0.09) (p < 0.0001), GC10/10G (1.01 ± 0.24) (p < 0.0009) and AG8/12C (1.18 ± 0.03) (p < 0.0002) haplotypes, but absolute differences were small.DISCUSSIONOur findings indicate the essential role of upstream elements for IL1 induction in the ECV304 cell line compared with the region required for IL1-induced transcription in the HeLa cell line. Our results suggest that regulation of IL6 transcription is cell type-specific, which may be of physiological relevance when considering different disease processes. The other important finding is the functional effect of IL6 promoter haplotype on expression levels. The study of a single polymorphism in isolation will not reveal the overall functional effect of the polymorphism in combination with other functional polymorphisms.In the HeLa cell line, both −174 allelic constructs showed strong induction upon IL1 treatment (11-fold) in contrast to published data (19.Fishman D. Faulds G. Jeffery R. Mohamed Ali V. Yudkin J.S. Humphries S. Woo P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1369-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar) on a longer fragment (−550 to +61), which showed that the −174C allele in combination with 8A/12T resulted in a complete lack of transcriptional induction by IL1. The difference in these observations could be explained by the presence of a −174C allele-specific repressor between +13 and +61 or between −211 and −550. Our studies with clones containing the fragment −641 to +13 showed the AG8/12G haplotype to result in significantly lower expression than the AG8/12C haplotype, again contrary to the published results (19.Fishman D. Faulds G. Jeffery R. Mohamed Ali V. Yudkin J.S. Humphries S. Woo P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1369-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar), suggesting that any repression of the −174C allele must be the result of the presence of the more downstream region, +13 to +61, in the clones described by Fishman et al. The possibility of this allelic repression is difficult to explain in the light of the absence of additional polymorphisms in this region.In the ECV304 cell line, there is no clear and simple relationship between one polymorphism and the differences observed in transcription levels from the longer constructs. The increased expression levels from the AG8/12C clone under basal conditions are statistically significant, but, considering the actual effects on transcription levels (the -fold differences were minimal), the physiological relevance of this remains uncertain. The same conclusion should also be applied to the differences observed in the ECV304 cell line when examining the damping down of IL6 transcription in response to dexamethasone. The 10A/11T-containing haplotype shows significantly greater inhibition of transcription than the 9A/11T, and the AG8/12C and GC10/10G haplotypes at the dexamethasone dose used. Although these experimental differences were found to be statistically significant, the physiological importance of these findings is questionable when the relative differences are so small.Our results show that the relationship between IL6 expression and the −174 polymorphism is not as simple as might be expected; the AnTn allele has an influence on expression when comparing the GG9/11G clone and the GG10/11G clone, the GG9/11G haplotype resulting in significantly higher expression than the GG10/11G haplotype, but the increased expression from this one clone is not the consequence of the 9A/11T allele alone as similarly high expression is not seen from the GG9/11C allele. The higher expression is not the result of the −174G allele, as the other −174G haplotypes do not produce the same effect, and the same follows for the −597G allele and the −572G allele. The difference is the result of the combination of alleles for the different polymorphisms,i.e. the haplotype. This same conclusion is drawn for the low expressing haplotype AG8/12G; the low expression is not the result of the −597A allele or the 8A/12T allele, as the other clone containing these two alleles (AG8/12C) shows significantly higher expression. The −174G allele is not the cause alone either, as the same lower transcription is not observed for the other −174G-containing clones. The conclusion is that the different polymorphisms have an influence on transcription but the polymorphisms are not functioning individually. The effect of one polymorphism synergizes with the effect of another, so the difference caused by one variant is not easy to determine. One explanation is that the differences are the result of specific combinations of the AnTn run and the −174 polymorphism, but a complete explanation awaits analysis of potential transcription factor binding and/or interactions.The variation observed in the ECV304 cell line between the clones in the stimulated state may be important physiologically. Owing to the short half-life of IL6 in vivo, the consequence of the strikingly increased induction with IL1 of the GG9/11G haplotype would be increased levels of IL6 locally, and probably not a prolonged acute phase response under normal regulator conditions because the haplotype responds to the down-regulation of expression (e.g. by dexamethasone) in the same way as the other haplotypes. The AG8/12G haplotype resulting in significantly lower levels of expression with IL1 stimulation could also be of physiological importance.It is also important to consider the reasons for the differential expression of short and long constructs in the ECV304 cells compared with HeLa cells. It may be that transcription from the IL6 promoter reaches a maximum level in HeLa cells, with transcription factors becoming limiting and masking any potential variation between clones. Expression levels in ECV304 are lower for both long and short constructs. From the study of a positive control, it was clear that production of the reporter gene itself was not the limiting factor. Second, the cell type-specific differences may be the results of differential expression of essential transcription factors in the two cell lines or underlying differences in transcriptional control.When considering these results in the context of potential population-based studies, the overall effect on level if only the −174G→C polymorphism is considered would be that the C allele would show lower expression than the G allele, because the −174G-containing haplotypes with lowest expression levels only account for approximately 5% of the population. This would explain the findings of Fishmanet al. (19.Fishman D. Faulds G. Jeffery R. Mohamed Ali V. Yudkin J.S. Humphries S. Woo P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1369-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar) that the C allele was associated with significantly lower levels of plasma IL6 levels in a population of healthy subjects, but if future studies show this low expressing AG8/12G haplotype or, indeed, the high expressing GG9/11G haplotype to affect disease susceptibility, genotyping of the −174G→C polymorphism alone would be inadequate.The overall conclusion of this study is that differences in IL6 promoter haplotype may have an important role in determining levels of transcription for the IL6 gene. The transcriptional control of this gene is complex, and subtle variations in the promoter influence regulation of this system. The observation that base changes at adjacent polymorphic sites are not independent suggests that there may be interaction between the transcriptional machinery at the separate sites. The function of one variation is determined by the effect of other alleles at distinct polymorphic sites, and the effect of altering the DNA sequence in two sep"

Recent studies using knockout mice suggest that NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), along with small Maf proteins, binds and activates the ARE. In this study, using in vitro binding assays, Nrf2/MafK heterodimers were found to interact with high affinity to the ARE. However, distinct differences were observed when this interaction was compared with that formed with nuclear proteins from H4II EC3 or HepG2 cells. Overexpression of Nrf2 activated ARE-mediated transcription in HepG2 cells, and this activation was further increased by tert-butylhydroquinone. In HeLa cells, overexpression of Nrf2 resulted in activation of the ARE, but this activation was no longer induced bytert-butylhydroquinone. Using ARE constructs with point mutations in the core sequence, we found that only mutations at the T or G nucleotides within the core (TGAC) render the ARE unresponsive to Nrf2. Overexpression of MafK led to dose-dependent repression of ARE activity. Activation of the ARE by Nrf2 was similarly antagonized by MafK. These data suggest that Nrf2 plays an important role mediating basal activity of the ARE but that small Maf proteins are repressors and not activators of ARE-mediated transcription.

The induction of these enzymes by transcriptional activation through the ARE results from cellular exposure to a variety of chemical entities, including electrophilic compounds, antioxidants, and a host of other agents capable of generating radical species that alter the cellular redox state. This imbalanced cellular redox state, generally referred to as oxidative stress (1.Sies H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar), appears to be the principal signal that acts, directly or indirectly, through a signaling pathway leading to the transcriptional activation of genes encoding these enzymes. The ARE was first identified on the promoter of the rat gene encoding the glutathioneS-transferase A2 subunit (GST A2) (2.Rushmore T.H. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14648-14653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was found to be responsive to conditions of oxidative stress (3.Rushmore T.H. Morton M.R. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11632-11639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Functional analysis of this element by point mutations identified a core sequence, 5′-TGACNNNGC-3′, essential for mediating basal and/or inducible activity (3.Rushmore T.H. Morton M.R. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11632-11639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A functional ARE has also been identified in a number of other genes encoding phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes such as the mouse Gst A1 (4.Friling R.S. Bensimon A. Tichauer Y. Daniel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6258-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) and the rat and human NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (QR) (5.Favreau L.V. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4556-4561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Li Y. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15097-15104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as the γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase gene (7.Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14683-14689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Through the use of bioinformatics, the ARE sequence has also been identified in the 5′-flanking region of a number of other genes, although its functional role has not as yet been experimentally demonstrated (8.Wasserman W.W. Fahl W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5361-5366Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Because the ARE core sequence is similar to the sequence recognized by AP-1 proteins, the possibility exists that members of the Jun and Fos families of transcriptional factors might be involved in the transcriptional activation of the rat GST A2 andQR genes. This hypothesis was strengthened by the observation that Jun and Fos family members can be activated by oxidative stress (9.Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Lau L.F. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2804-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 10.Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher III, F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, data from a number of studies have suggested that transcriptional factors distinct from Jun and Fos are involved in the transcriptional activation of the ARE (11.Nguyen T. Rushmore T.H. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13656-13662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Yoshioka K. Deng T. Cavigelli M. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In fact, a recent study using knockout mice indicated that the NF-E2-related factor 2, Nrf2, was part of a transcriptional complex directly involved in mediating the transcriptional regulation of the mouse Gst A1 gene (14.Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar). Furthermore, using in vitro gel shift assays, these investigators found that Nrf2/small Maf heterodimers bind with high affinity to the ARE sequence and regulate transcription of the GST andQR genes. The role of Nrf2 in regulating the ARE of the human QR gene has also been demonstrated recently (15.Venugopal R. Jaiswal A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14960-14965Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar,16.Venugopal R. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3145-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have examined the binding specificities of Nrf2/MafK heterodimers to the ARE derived from the rat GST A2 and QR genes using gel mobility shift and DNase I protection assays. Furthermore, we utilized co-transfection assays to explore the role these transcription factors play in basal and inducible expression of the rat GST A2 and QRgenes. We found that Nrf2/small Maf heterodimers bind with high affinity to the rat QR ARE but with low affinity to the ratGST A2 ARE. Our data suggest that Nrf2 is involved in regulating basal level expression of the rat GST A2 andQR genes; however, small Maf acts as a transcriptional repressor rather than activator of ARE-mediated transcription. The cDNA encoding the rat Nrf2 and rat MafK proteins was cloned from a rat liver cDNA library (Stratagene) by polymerase chain reaction methodologies. Primers used in the polymerase chain reaction experiments were synthesized based on cDNA sequences obtained from the GenBankTM data base for rat Nrf2 (accession number AF037350) and for mouse MafK (accession number D42124) (17.Igarashi K. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Matuzaki Y. Nakauchi H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7615-7624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The cDNA thus obtained was ligated to the plasmid vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), which contains the T7 promoter and the cytomegalovirus promoter for expression in mammalian cells. The recombinant plasmids were propagated in Escherichia coli DH5αF′ cells. The electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) to assess DNA-protein interactions were performed essentially as described (11.Nguyen T. Rushmore T.H. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13656-13662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using a 43-base, double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the ARE sequence of the ratQR gene as probe. The oligonucleotides were labeled at the 5′-end using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to published procedures (18.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar) from rat H4II EC3 cells or from human HepG2 cells treated withtert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) for 6 h. Rat Nrf2 and MafK proteins were synthesized in vitro using the TNT-T7 coupled wheat germ extract system (Promega Corp.). To generate Nrf2/MafK dimers, equal volumes of translation mixtures containing Nrf2 and MafK were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. In the competition experiments, unlabeled DNA at approximately 50-fold molar excess was preincubated with protein samples for 20 min at 25 °C prior to addition of the labeled probe. The reaction mixtures were incubated for an additional 30 min with the labeled probe (0.1 ng, 10,000 dpm) and fractionated on non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels in Tris borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer. DNA fragments containing the ARE sequence encompassing nucleotides −771 to −606 of the rat GST A2 gene and −479 to −302 of the rat QR gene were used as templates in the DNase I protection assays. These fragments were prepared by polymerase chain reaction, purified on agarose gel, and end-labeled with [α-32P]dATP and [α-32P]dCTP by fill-in reactions using the Klenow fragment. Binding reactions and DNase I digestion were exactly as described previously (19.Nguyen T. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13535-13539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Digestion products were purified by phenol extraction, precipitated with ethanol, heat-denatured, and analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide/urea-denaturing gels. Rat H4II EC3, HeLa S3, and HepG2 cells were maintained and cultured as described (2.Rushmore T.H. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14648-14653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For transfection experiments, cells were plated in 6-well plates at approximately 60% confluency and incubated for 20 h at 37 °C. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the protocols provided by the manufacturer. Transfected cells were allowed to recover for 20 h at 37 °C, then exposed to Me2SO (control) or tBHQ (60 μm), and incubated for an additional 24 h. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, and assayed for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity. Recent studies suggest that NF-E2-related (i.e. Nrf) proteins may be involved in regulating the transcriptional activity of the ARE (14.Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar, 15.Venugopal R. Jaiswal A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14960-14965Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar, 16.Venugopal R. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3145-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was suggested that a heterodimer of Nrf2/small Maf is involved in the activation process (14.Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar). We tested this hypothesis by usingin vitro EMSA to determine whether these proteins could specifically interact with the ARE with high affinity. Individually, incubation of in vitro translated Nrf2 or MafK alone with the labeled ARE did not lead to formation of any shifted complex (14.Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar), 2T. Nguyen, H. C. Huang, and C. B. Pickett, unpublished data. suggesting that Nrf2 and MafK could not interact with the ARE with high affinity either as monomers or as homodimers. As a heterodimer, the Nrf2/MafK complex was found to interact with the ARE derived from the rat QR gene in a specific manner (Fig.1). The formation of this DNA-protein complex was blocked by a 50-fold molar excess of the unlabeledQR ARE but was unaffected by the same molar excess ofQR ARE oligonucleotides containing a mutated GC dinucleotide within the core sequence (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and4). A similar pattern of competition was seen using nuclear extracts from H4II EC3 cells (Fig. 1 B, lanes 11and 13). The mobility of the shifted Nrf2/MafK-DNA complex, however, was slightly lower when compared with that formed with nuclear extract from tBHQ-treated rat H4II EC3 cells. In addition, an excess of the unlabeled ARE sequence derived from the rat GST A2 gene could only partially block the interaction as compared with a complete block when rat nuclear extract was used (Fig.1 B, lanes 5 and 14). However, the Nrf2/MafK-QR ARE interaction was fully abolished if the ARE of the GST A2 gene was mutated to contain a core sequence with perfect dyad symmetry (5′-TGACAAAGC-3′ to 5′-TGACTCAGC-3′) and used as unlabeled competitor DNA (Fig.1 B, lane 7). These data suggest that a palindromic sequence within the DNA binding motif is essential for high affinity binding by the Nrf2/MafK dimer. Similarly, comparison of the binding affinity for the ARE of the Nrf2/MafK dimer with that of a nuclear protein complex from tBHQ-treated HepG2 cells revealed the same differences with regard to mobility as well as the competition pattern observed with rat nuclear extracts. In this experiment, we also included two additional oligonucleotides, MARE and MARE-7 (Fig. 1 A), as unlabeled competitor DNA. MARE and MARE-7 are response elements recognized specifically by c-Maf (20.Kataoka K. Fujiwara K.T. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7581-7591Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), a member of the bZIP protein family. Interestingly, the MARE oligonucleotide, having a palindromic core sequence, effectively competed with the ARE for binding both to the Nrf2/MafK dimer and to the nuclear protein from HepG2 cells (Fig. 1 C,lanes 5 and 15). In contrast, the MARE-7 oligonucleotide, lacking the palindrome, could still compete with the ARE for binding to the HepG2 nuclear protein. However, the MARE-7 oligonucleotide could not compete with binding of the Nrf2/MafK dimer to the ARE (Fig. 1 C, lanes 6 and16). These data are consistent with the idea that a palindromic sequence provides a high affinity recognition motif for the Nrf2/MafK protein. Under similar conditions in the binding assays, we could not observe high affinity interactions between recombinant Nrf2/MafK dimers and the GST A2 ARE, presumably because the interactions are too weak to be observed by EMSA. We analyzed further the DNA binding properties of Nrf2/MafK by performing in vitro DNase I protection assays. Fig.2 shows the results of these experiments. A 32P-labeled DNA fragment spanning positions −479 to −302 of the QR gene was allowed to form a complex with either the Nrf2/MafK dimer or with nuclear proteins prepared from Me2SO-treated or tBHQ-treated rat H4II EC3 cells, and the complex was subjected to limited digestion with DNase I. An identical protected region of 21 bases from −429 to −408 was observed with either Me2SO- or tBHQ-treated nuclear extracts (Fig.2 A, lanes 5 and 7). In the presence of an excess of the unlabeled 43-base pair ARE sequence, the labeled DNA was no longer protected from DNase I digestion (Fig. 2 A,lanes 6 and 8). When the labeled DNA fragment was incubated with the Nrf2/MafK protein, the protected region was extended an additional 4 bases at the 5′-end (Fig. 2 A,lane 2) and was lost if an excess of unlabeled ARE sequence was included in the incubation mixture (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). In both cases, binding of the protein to the labeled DNA induced a DNase I-hypersensitive site at the same position (marked by an asterisk). We also performed DNase I protection assays using a32P-labeled DNA fragment spanning nucleotides −771 to −606 of the GST A2 gene as a binding template. Nuclear extracts prepared from Me2SO- or tBHQ-treated rat H4II EC3 cells protected an identical region of 33 bases encompassing positions −714 to −682 (Fig. 2 B, lanes 5 and7). Addition of an excess of the unlabeled ARE abolished this protection (Fig. 2 B, lanes 6 and8). In contrast, the Nrf2/MafK failed to protect any sequence on this DNA template from DNase I digestion (Fig.2 B, lane 2). These results are consistent with those obtained by EMSA described above, which show that the ARE derived from the GST A2 gene could not fully compete with that derived from the QR gene for binding to this protein complex. These data suggest that the interaction of the Nrf2/MafK dimer with the ARE sequence of the GST A2gene occurs at a much lower affinity than with the ARE sequence from the QR gene. The role of Nrf2 in regulating the transcriptional activity of the ARE was further studied by transfection experiments in both HepG2 and HeLa cells. When co-transfected into HepG2 cells along with the wild-type ARE construct derived from the GST A2 gene, Nrf2 induced expression of CAT enzyme activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.3 A). Maximal CAT enzyme expression was observed at 0.5 μg of plasmid DNA used in the transfection with an approximately 30-fold activation (Fig.3 A). The level of activation decreased as the amount of plasmid DNA was raised to 1.0 μg. The ARE-mediated activation of CAT enzyme activity by Nrf2 was induced further when the transfected cells were treated with tBHQ. Because Nrf2 has been shown to be expressed at high levels in HeLa cells by Northern blot analysis (21.Moi P. Chan K. Asunis I. Cao A. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9926-9930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar), we also transfected these cells with the ARE constructs along with an empty plasmid vector (pcDNA3) as control or with the Nrf2 expression vector and then exposed the cells to tBHQ. Unlike HepG2 cells, HeLa cells expressed very low levels of basal CAT activity when co-transfected with the ARE construct and plasmid pcDNA3. Treatment of these cells with tBHQ did not result in any increase in CAT activity (Fig. 3 B). Co-transfection of HeLa cells with the Nrf2 expression plasmid, however, led to a DNA concentration-dependent increase in CAT activity, but no further induction by tBHQ was observed with any of the DNA concentrations used in transfections (Fig. 3 B). These findings suggest that Nrf2 may be responsible in regulating the basal activity of the ARE. To address this possibility in more detail, we performed similar transfection experiments using various plasmid constructs containing point mutations within the core sequence (5′-TGACNNNGC-3′) required for the basal and/or inducible activity of the ARE (3.Rushmore T.H. Morton M.R. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11632-11639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When an ARE construct containing a point mutation at the T or G nucleotide within the TGAC tetranucleotide was transfected into HepG2 cells, the basal activity was entirely abolished (Fig.4 A). Overexpression of Nrf2 had no significant effect on the level of CAT activity in these cells. In contrast, when ARE constructs containing point mutations at other positions within the core sequence were used in the transfection experiments, ectopic expression of Nrf2 could still activate CAT expression, although less efficiently than with the wild-type ARE (Fig. 4 A). Treatment of these transfected cells with tBHQ did not lead to a further increase in CAT activity (data not shown). These results clearly indicate that the T and G nucleotides are critical for Nrf2 interaction and that other nucleotides within the ARE core sequence also have contributory but less essential roles in this recognition.Figure 4Effect of Nrf2 overexpression on the transcriptional activity of the ARE and point mutants. The transfection procedures were performed as described in the legend to Fig. 3. HepG2 cells were co-transfected with 0.1 μg of pNrf2 and 1 μg of various ARE constructs from the GST A2 gene (A) or with 1.0 μg of pNrf2 and 1.0 μg of ARE constructs from the QR gene (B). Following transfection, cells were allowed to recover for 40 h and then harvested for CAT assays. The sequences of the wild-type (WT) and mutant ARE are indicated with the mutated nucleotides underlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We carried out similar transfection studies with Nrf2 to determine its transcriptional activity on the ARE derived from the ratQR gene. Like the GST A2 ARE, Nrf2 transactivated the QR ARE proportionally with the DNA concentrations used in the transfections of either HepG2 or HeLa cells (Fig. 5). However, the maximum level of CAT activity was reached at a DNA concentration of 0.5 μg in HepG2 cells for a 10-fold activation (Fig. 5 A). In HeLa cells, a 15-fold activation was observed with the highest DNA concentration used in the transfection, i.e. 1.0 μg (Fig. 5 B). The lower maximal level of -fold activation by Nrf2 in HepG2 cells for the QR ARE (10-fold) as compared with that of theGST A2 ARE (30-fold) is probably due to the 3–5-fold lower level of basal activity expressed by the latter, which probably reflects differences in DNA sequences surrounding the core motif. We also performed transfection experiments using constructs with point mutations within the ARE sequence (22.Favreau L.V. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24468-24474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) to determine critical nucleotides required for activation by Nrf2. As shown in Fig.4 B, a mutation of the T within the TGAC tetranucleotide reduced CAT activation to a minimal level. Overexpression of Nrf2 in cells transfected with this mutant ARE did not result in any significant activation of CAT activity. Because the QRARE contains two half-sites that are palindromic to one another and are essential for ARE activity, we transfected cells with another ARE construct with a point mutation at the G within the upstream TGAC half-site on the antisense strand (see Fig. 4 B). Cells transfected with this ARE mutant expressed a reduced basal level activity of approximately 20% of the wild-type level. When Nrf2 was overexpressed in these same cells, CAT gene expression was increased 25-fold as compared with the 8-fold activation observed with the wild-type ARE. The maximum level of CAT activity activated by Nrf2 for these two ARE constructs was, however, similar (Fig.4 B). Transfection of HepG2 cells with an ARE construct containing a point mutation at the C nucleotide of the downstream GC box reduced the basal level expression of ARE to about 20% of that of the wild type. Overexpression of Nrf2 led to a 10-fold activation of CAT activity. A double mutation of the GC box also led to a reduction of the basal activity, but in this case no activation by Nrf2 was observed. This suggests that the GC box is also essential for activation by Nrf2, in agreement with the competition data of the in vitro binding studies showing that a mutation of this GC box results in a sequence with much lower affinity for the Nrf2/MafK protein (see Fig. 1). As indicated earlier, it has been suggested that small Maf proteins, which lack a transactivation domain, may form a heterodimer complex with Nrf2 to regulate the transcriptional activity of the ARE (14.Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar). We tested this possibility by co-transfecting HepG2 cells with a MafK expression plasmid along with the GST A2 ARE construct. In a concentration-dependent manner, MafK repressed the ARE-mediated gene expression. This repression, however, only affects the basal level expression because tBHQ was still able to induce CAT activity in these cells (Fig.6 A). We also performed transfection experiments in which both Nrf2 and MafK expression plasmids were simultaneously introduced into HepG2 cells with the ARE. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 6 B. MafK was found to repress Nrf2-mediated transcriptional activation. This effect increased with the amount of MafK plasmid DNA used in the transfection experiments (Fig. 6 B). Similar results were obtained when the QR ARE construct was co-transfected into HepG2 cells with the MafK expression plasmid alone or together with Nrf2 expression plasmid. As shown in Fig.7 A, MafK has a profound effect on the ARE activity, reducing its basal level proportionally with increasing concentrations. Like the GST A2 ARE, tBHQ was still able to induce CAT activity in these MafK-transfected cells. Similarly, the transcriptional activation of this ARE by Nrf2 was also antagonized by the expression of MafK in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 7 B). Recent studies suggest that Nrf2/small Maf may be the transcriptional complex involved in the transcriptional activation mediated by the ARE of the mouse Gst A1 and QRgenes by xenobiotics (14.Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar). In this study, we determined via in vitro binding assays and co-transfection assays whether Nrf2 could directly interact with the ARE. Our results show that the in vitro translated rat Nrf2/MafK dimer interacts with high specificity and affinity with the ARE of the ratQR gene. This interaction results in a complex that has a slightly lower mobility in EMSA as compared with that formed between the ARE and a nuclear protein from rat H4II EC3 or human HepG2 cells. It appears that a palindromic sequence within the recognition motif of the QR ARE is essential for high affinity binding by the Nrf2/MafK dimer. This may explain the observation that the ARE derived from the rat GST A2 gene, which does not have any apparent palindromic structure within the sequence, failed to compete with the QR ARE for binding to the Nrf2/MafK complex (even though it could effectively block binding by nuclear proteins from either rat H4II EC3 or human HepG2 cells). A mutation that creates a palindrome within the GST A2 ARE core sequence, however, confers to this element the ability to fully compete with theQR ARE for Nrf2/MafK binding. Functionally, the transfection data from both HepG2 and HeLa cells indicate that overexpression of Nrf2 strongly activates gene expression through the ARE. Whether overexpressed Nrf2 acts as homodimer or in combination with endogenous factor(s) to activate the ARE in these transfection studies is not known. However, an Nrf2 homodimer does not interact with the ARE in in vitro binding assays (data not shown and Ref. 14.Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, Nrf2 can activate the ARE in a concentration-dependent manner in transfection experiments in both HepG2 and HeLa cells. There are at least two possibilities to explain how Nrf2 acts in this context. Nrf2 may dimerize with an endogenous protein that must exist at a high level in the cells to account for the concentration-dependent effect observed. Alternatively, in these overexpression assays Nrf2 might function as a homodimer with lower affinity for the ARE. Because Nrf2 is expressed at a relatively high level in HeLa cells (21.Moi P. Chan K. Asunis I. Cao A. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9926-9930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar), the observation that this cell line does not respond to induction by tBHQ suggests that Nrf2 may have an important role in mediating the basal activity associated with the ARE. The role Nrf2 plays in basal level expression agrees with the observation that the QR ARE mediates a 3–5-fold higher basal activity than the GST A2ARE, most likely because the QR ARE presents a palindromic sequence that is more favorable for interaction with Nrf2. Thus, Nrf2 may be the primary factor involved in mediating the basal activity of the ARE. However, Nrf2 probably requires an endogenous factor that exists in HepG2 and not in HeLa cells to generate a full response to xenobiotics through the ARE. This endogenous factor could not be MafK or presumably other small Maf proteins because these proteins have a repressor effect on the ARE activity. The repression affects primarily the basal activity because an inducible response could still be elicited by tBHQ in HepG2 cells overexpressing MafK. These data are consistent with published reports suggesting that small Maf proteins generally act as transcriptional repressors either as homodimers or as heterodimers with either Nrf1 or Nrf2 proteins (23.Igarashi K. Kataoka K. Itoh K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1994; 367: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 24.Johnsen O. Skammelsrud N. Luna L. Nishizawa M. Prydz H. Kolsto A.B.

Yamamoto M. Ito E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1901-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These findings may also explain the different mobility exhibited by Nrf2/MafK and nuclear protein(s) observed in the gel mobility shift assays. It is likely that the nuclear protein complex consists of Nrf2 in association with a factor distinct from small Maf proteins that migrates faster on EMSA. This putative factor, when dimerized with Nrf2, would form a complex that interacts with both the GST A2 andQR AREs with high affinity and in a sequence-specific manner to mediate transcriptional activation in response to oxidative stress. The identification and isolation of this factor through the use of two-hybrid systems would help to answer important questions regarding this signaling pathway. A recent study described the identification of Keap-1, a protein associated with the cytoskeleton, as part of a pathway mediating the response to oxidative stress through the ARE (27.Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2792) Google Scholar). It was suggested that Nrf2 is normally retained in the cytosolic compartment through association with Keap-1 and that this association is disrupted in cells under oxidative stress, thus releasing Nrf2 for translocation into the nucleus to effect gene transcription. These data provide evidence for a novel pathway of signal transduction in response to oxidative stress via the ARE reminiscent of the well characterized NF-κB-mediated pathway. It would be of interest to determine whether Keap-1 is expressed in HeLa cells, because these cells fail to activate the ARE when treated with tBHQ despite the high level of Nrf2 expression observed in these cells. Alternatively, HeLa cells may lack other components in the signaling pathway that regulates the interaction between Keap-1 and Nrf2. The signaling pathway leading to the activation of gene expression via the ARE has recently been shown to involve the mitogen-activated protein kinases (28.Yu R. Tan T.H. Kong A.-N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28962-28970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 29.Yu R. Lei W. Mandlekar S. Weber M.J. Der C.D. Wu J. Kong A.-N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27545-27552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In these studies, specific inhibitors were used to determine the role of distinct mitogen-activated protein kinases in regulating the transcriptional activity of the ARE. It was suggested that the activities of Raf-1 kinase and the downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 are important for ARE activity. Further studies are needed to determine whether members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family are involved in regulating the Keap-1/Nrf2 interaction in response to oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2091533776,"The Sm proteins B/B′, D1, D2, D3, E, F, and G are components of the small nuclear ribonucleoproteins U1, U2, U4/U6, and U5 that are essential for the splicing of pre-mRNAs in eukaryotes. D1 and D3 are among the most common antigens recognized by anti-Sm autoantibodies, an autoantibody population found exclusively in patients afflicted with systemic lupus erythematosus. Here we demonstrate by protein sequencing and mass spectrometry that all arginines in the C-terminal arginine-glycine (RG) dipeptide repeats of the human Sm proteins D1 and D3, isolated from HeLa small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, contain symmetrical dimethylarginines (sDMAs), a posttranslational modification thus far only identified in the myelin basic protein. The further finding that human D1 individually overexpressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells contains asymmetrical dimethylarginines suggests that the symmetrical dimethylation of the RG repeats in D1 and D3 is dependent on the assembly status of D1 and D3. In antibody binding studies, 10 of 11 anti-Sm patient sera tested, as well as the monoclonal antibody Y12, reacted with a chemically synthesized C-terminal peptide of D1 containing sDMA, but not with peptides containing asymmetrically modified or nonmodified arginines. These results thus demonstrate that the sDMA-modified C terminus of D1 forms a major linear epitope for anti-Sm autoantibodies and Y12 and further suggest that posttranslational modifications of Sm proteins play a role in the etiology of systemic lupus erythematosus.

The UsnRNPs consist of one (in the case of U1, U2, and U5) or two (in the case of U4/U6) UsnRNAs and at least 50 distinct proteins (2.Will C.L. Lührmann R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 320-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). These proteins can be divided into two groups: the Sm proteins B/B′, D1, D2, D3, E, F, and G, found in each of the UsnRNPs, and the specific proteins that are associated with only one of the UsnRNP particles. The Sm proteins play a key role in the biogenesis of the UsnRNPs. In the cytoplasm, the Sm proteins form RNA-free hetero-oligomers E·F·G, D1·D2, and B/B′·D3 (3.Hermann H. Fabrizio P. Raker V.A.

After the nuclear export of the RNA polymerase II transcripts U1, U2, U4, and U5, the Sm protein complexes assemble on the Sm site, a conserved sequence that these UsnRNAs have in common (7.Branlant C. Krol A. Ebel J.P. Lazar E. Haendler B. Jacob M. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 1259-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Interestingly, single Sm proteins do not bind to the UsnRNA. Rather, the D1·D2 and E·F·G complexes first bind to the Sm site, thus forming a so-called subcore snRNP intermediate. Subsequent association of the B/B′·D3 complex completes the formation of the core UsnRNP. The core UsnRNP is required for the hypermethylation of the m7G cap of the U1, U2, U4, and U5 snRNAs to m3G caps (8.Mattaj I. Cell. 1986; 46: 905-911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 9.Plessel G. Fischer U. Lührmann R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4160-4172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and also constitutes part of the bipartite nuclear localization signal necessary for the import of the UsnRNPs into the nucleus (10.Hamm J. Darzynkiewicz E. Tahara S.M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1990; 62: 569-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 11.Fischer U. Lührmann R. Science. 1990; 249: 786-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Moreover, there is evidence that the Sm proteins may stabilize the association of specific snRNP proteins (12.Nelissen R.L. Will C.L. van Venrooij W.J. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4113-4125Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Sm proteins are not only of functional interest but also of clinical relevance. Patients suffering from the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) spontaneously produce autoantibodies against a multitude of cellular components (13.Van Mühlen C.A. Tan E.M. Semin. Arthritis Rheum. 1995; 24: 323-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 14.Van Venrooij W.J. Pruijn G.J.M. Curr. Opin.

Antibodies against Sm proteins (anti-Sm autoantibodies) are SLE-specific, in contrast to most other SLE-associated autoantibody populations. Therefore, the elucidation of the antigenic determinants recognized on the Sm proteins is of significant diagnostic and immunopathological relevance. In immunoblots, anti-Sm autoantibodies react predominantly with the Sm proteins B/B′, D1, D3, and, to a lesser extent, D2 (16.Lehmeier T. Foulaki K. Lührmann R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6475-6484Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 17.Hoch S.O. van Venrooij W.J. Maini R.N. Manual of Biological Markers of Disease. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 1-29Google Scholar). The E, F, and G proteins are also frequently recognized under native conditions, such as in immunoprecipitation assays (18.Brahms H. Raker V.A. van Venrooij W.J. Lührmann R. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 672-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The parallel recognition of several Sm proteins by anti-Sm patient sera is not only due to distinct antibody populations but also to cross-reactive epitopes on the Sm proteins (16.Lehmeier T. Foulaki K. Lührmann R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6475-6484Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 19.Rokeach L.A. Jannatipour M. Hoch S.O. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 1015-1022PubMed Google Scholar), thus indicating that the Sm proteins share structural homology. Indeed, all Sm proteins are evolutionarily conserved in an approximately 70–90-amino-acid-long region designated the Sm domain, which contains the Sm1 and Sm2 motifs (3.Hermann H. Fabrizio P. Raker V.A. Foulaki K. Hornig H. Brahms H. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1995; 9: 2076-2088Crossref Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 20.Cooper M. Johnston L.H. Beggs J.D.

The recent elucidation of the crystal structures of the B·D3 and D1·D2 complexes demonstrated that the fold of the Sm domain is also highly conserved (22.Kambach C. Walke S. Young R. Avis J.M. de la Fortelle E. Raker V.A. Lührmann R. Li J. Nagai K. Cell. 1999; 96: 375-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Epitope mapping studies with the Sm proteins B/B′ and D1 have demonstrated that the Sm domains of these proteins indeed form discontinuous B-cell epitopes (23.Rokeach L.A. Jannatipour M. Haselby J.A. Hoch S.O. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1992; 65: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 24.Hirakata M. Craft J. Hardin J. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3592-3601PubMed Google Scholar). However, some putative linear epitopes have also been mapped on the Sm proteins D1 and B/B′. These epitopes are predominantly located in the C-terminal extensions of the D1 and B/B′ proteins and not in the Sm domain (25.Rokeach L.A. Hoch S.O. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1992; 16: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The C terminus of D1, for example, which contains a stretch of nine RG dipeptides (26.Rokeach L.A. Haselby J.A. Hoch S.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4832-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), was reported to form an epitope for anti-Sm autoantibodies (23.Rokeach L.A. Jannatipour M. Haselby J.A. Hoch S.O. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1992; 65: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar,27.Barakat S. Briand J.-P. Weber J.-C. Clin. Exp.

Lahita R.G. J. Autoimmun. 1994; 7: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the native D1 protein, the C-terminal epitope of D1 often reacted with autoantibodies from patients with other diagnoses than SLE (30.Rivkin E. Vella M.J. Lahita R.G. J. Autoimmun. 1994; 7: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Therefore, the disease-specific recognition of the D1 C terminus by anti-Sm autoantibodies seems not only to be sequence-dependent but could additionally depend on other factors such as proper folding and/or posttranslational modifications. C-terminal RG dipeptide repeats are found in D1 and D3 orthologs of most organisms except yeast, suggesting that the RG stretches of D1 and D3 play an important functional role in higher eukaryotes. RG-rich regions are also found in several other nuclear proteins that are involved in RNA processing (e.g. heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1, fibrillarin, nucleolin, and the yeast-RNA binding protein Np/3p (for a review, see Ref. 31.Gary J.D. Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 65-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). However, in contrast to D1 and D3, they contain RGG motifs. Interestingly, the glycine/arginine-rich motifs of these proteins commonly contain asymmetrical dimethylarginines (aDMAs), a posttranslational modification formed by type I protein arginineN-methyltransferases (31.Gary J.D. Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 65-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We surmised that methylation of arginines in D1 could not only explain why synthetic RG-rich D1 peptides often react unspecifically (30.Rivkin E. Vella M.J. Lahita R.G. J. Autoimmun. 1994; 7: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) but also why human D1 protein reacts only weakly and sometimes unspecifically with anti-Sm autoantibodies when overexpressed in E. coli (32.Ou Y. Sun D. Sharp G.C. Hoch S.O. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1997; 83: 310-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 33.Rokeach L.A. Haselby J.A. Hoch S.O. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 118: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 34.Wagatsuma M. Asami N. Miyachi J. Uchida S. Watanabe H. Amann E. Mol. Immunol. 1993; 30: 1491-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed the Sm proteins D1 and D3 for posttranslational modifications and investigated the influence of such modifications on their antigenicity. Using protein sequencing and mass spectrometry, we could demonstrate that the human Sm proteins D1 and D3 are dimethylatedin vivo in all nine and four positions, respectively, of their C-terminal RG-stretches. In contrast to other nuclear proteins, D1 and D3 contain symmetrical dimethylarginines (sDMAs), a posttranslational modification thus far only identified in the myelin basic protein (MBP). In epitope mapping studies, a synthetic C-terminal peptide of D1 that contained sDMA reacted with 10 of 11 anti-Sm patient sera and the monoclonal antibody Y12, while homologous peptides with aDMA or nonmodified arginines were not recognized. Our data thus demonstrate that the recognition of D1 by anti-Sm autoantibodies and Y12 is strongly dependent on the symmetrical dimethylation of the C terminus of D1. Sm-positive patient sera (n = 11) were obtained from the Department of Rheumatology, Ghent University Hospital (Ghent, Belgium). Selection of Sm-positive sera was based on the use of the INNO-LIA™ ANA (Innogenetics N.V., Ghent, Belgium), a line immunoassay (LIA) containing natural SmD derived from purified HeLa UsnRNPs. Control sera tested negative for anti-nuclear factor in indirect immunofluorescence on Hep2 cells and showed no reactivity on the INNO-LIA™ ANA. Purification of HeLa UsnRNPs and subsequent separation of Sm proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis have been described earlier (16.Lehmeier T. Foulaki K. Lührmann R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6475-6484Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Coomassie Blue-stained bands of the respective Sm proteins were excised and directly submitted to proteolytic digestion according to Rosenfeld et al. (35.Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Briefly, the excised gel slices were washed twice with 2 ml of water for 1 h and then shaken strongly in an aqueous solution (pH 6.4) of 40% acetone, 10% triethylamine, and 5% acetic acid for 2 h. After washing three times for 1 h with 2 ml of water, the gel slices were dried and proteolytically digested with 0.5–2.0 μg of endoproteinase Lys-C (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 200–500 μl of digestion buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% acetonitrile, 1 mm K3EDTA). The peptide mixture was separated by HPLC on a C4 column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) using a 10–70% gradient of solvent B (70% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Manually recovered peptide fractions were then sequenced by Edman degradation using a Procise 492 sequencer equipped with an on-line 140C phenylthiohydantoin analyzer (Perkin-Elmer). To distinguish methylated arginines from nonmethylated arginines, we first applied a combination of either monomethylarginine (MMA) and sDMA or MMA and aDMA to a biobrene-coated, trifluoroacetic acid-treated glass fiber filter (Perkin-Elmer) and performed an Edman degradation cycle for each combination. Next, the human C-terminal D1 peptide, the C-terminal D3 peptide, or the baculo-derived C-terminal peptide was applied on the same filter and sequenced to completion. All additional standards were purchased from Sigma. A cDNA containing the sequence of human D1 (26.Rokeach L.A. Haselby J.A. Hoch S.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4832-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) was inserted as aBamHI/XbaI fragment into the expression vector pIGFH111 (Innogenetics), thus introducing the first 25 amino acids of mouse tumor necrosis factor and six histidines to the amino terminus of D1. After transfection into the E. coli strain SG4044 (pc1857) and temperature induction, a strong protein band in the expected range of 18 kDa could be detected in the soluble fraction. This protein was verified to be recombinant D1 by immunoblotting with an anti-tumor necrosis factor antibody (Innogenetics). After lysing the cells by French pressing in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm KCl, 25 mm ε-aminocaproic acid, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifugation at 4 °C (20 min at 27,000 × g), guanidinium HCl was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 4.5 m, and recombinant protein was purified by affinity chromatography on a nickel column (nickel-Sepharose; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For overexpression of D1 in baculovirus-infected insect cells, a 520-base pair DraI–SbaI fragment of pIGFH111hSmD1 (see above) was inserted into aBamHI–XbaI-digested baculovirus transfer plasmid pVL1393 (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) in which the fusion gene is under transcriptional control of the strong baculovirus polyhedrin promotor. After transfection of the vector (as described by the manufacturer), a D1 protein was expressed, as evidenced by immunoblotting (see above). After lysis, baculo-derived D1 was purified on a nickel column as described above. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry of the C-terminal D1 peptide was performed on a Voyager-DE STR (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) mass spectrometer equipped with delayed extraction and operated at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV and 150-ns delay. Desorption and ionization of the sample was carried out with a nitrogen laser (337 nm). Samples were applied on a stainless steel sample plate using the thin layer method (36.Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7822) Google Scholar) and measured in reflectron mode. MALDI-TOF-obtained spectra were externally calibrated using a standard peptide mixture of angiotensin I 1296.6853 [M + H]+, ACTH-(1–17) 2093.0867 [M + H]+, ACTH-(18–39) 2465.1989 [M + H]+, and ACTH-(7–38) 3657.9294 [M + H]+. The observed mass peaks were annotated manually. Electrospray mass spectrometry of recombinant D1 was performed in a Bio-Q-quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ion source (Micromass, Wytenshawe, United Kingdom). For analysis, 20 pmol of protein or peptide were applied in 10 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 1% acetic acid. Calibration was performed with 50 pmol of horse heart myoglobin. Peptides were synthesized on Tentagel S resin (Rapp Polymere GmbH, Germany) using a Rainin Symphony Multiplex synthesizer (Protein Technologies, Tucson, AZ) with standard Fmoc chemistry. Standard double couplings were performed by using a 4-fold excess of Fmoc-protected amino acids activated in situ with equimolar amounts of N-hydroxybenzotriazole and 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3,-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate twice for 20 min each time. Fmoc-protected asymmetrical and symmetrical dimethylarginine (Bachem, Switzerland) were incorporated similarly. After completion of the peptide synthesis, the peptide was cleaved from the resin by incubation for 2.5 h with a mixture of 90% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% thioanisole, 3% ethanedithiol, and 2% anisole. The peptide was precipitated from the mixture using t-butyl methyl ether. After centrifugation, the pellet was washed three times with t-butyl methyl ether and dried overnight in a vacuum. The purity of the crude peptide was checked by reversed-phase HPLC. For LIA, purified, gel-eluted HeLa proteins, from which SDS and Coomassie were removed by ion pair extraction (16.Lehmeier T.

Saman E.L. Peeters D.C. Warmenbol H.M. Heyndrickx L.M. Wouters C.J. Beelaert G. van der Groen G. Van Heuverswijn H. Clin. Chem. 1991; 73: 1700-1707Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Patient sera and Y12 were applied in a dilution of 1:200. A 3-fold molar excess of biotinylated synthetic peptides in 50 mm sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) were complexed to streptavidin by incubating for 1 h at 37 °C, before applying to the membrane. In order to visualize the applied proteins or peptides, a nonblocked LIA strip was stained with colloidal gold (Aurodye; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's procedure. To investigate whether the RG-rich stretches of the human D1 and D3 proteins contain methylated arginines, we performed protein sequencing and mass spectrometry. HeLa UsnRNPs were initially purified by immunoaffinity chromatography with an H2O antibody directed against the m3G cap of UsnRNPs (38.Bach M. Bringmann P. Lührmann R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 232-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and the protein constituents of the human UsnRNPs were then fractionated by High-TEMED SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (16.Lehmeier T. Foulaki K. Lührmann R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6475-6484Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Subsequently, those bands containing the D1 and D3 proteins were excised from the gel and proteolytically digested with endo-Lys-C. This procedure resulted in a C-terminal 29-amino acid-long D1 fragment (amino acids 91–119) and a 23-amino acid-long D3 fragment (amino acids 105–124) (see Fig.1). After fractionation of the D1 and D3 peptide mixtures by HPLC, we were able to isolate both C-terminal peptides, so that all C-terminal RG dipeptides of D1 and D3 were analyzed (Fig. 1). To initially determine whether the C-terminal peptide of D1 contains posttranslational modifications, we performed mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). A protonated major mass peak, isotopically resolved at 3366.68 Da, was detected (Fig. 2). The observed value clearly deviated from the theoretical mass expected for a nonmodified D1-(91–119) peptide. Moreover, the mass difference fit almost perfectly for a D1 peptide with dimethylated arginines at all positions of its RG-rich stretch (the theoretical protonated monoisotopic value of D1-(91–119) with nine DMAs is 3366.10 Da). A minor peak of 3238.58 Da, obtained to a lesser extent after proteolytical digestion, was also observed and is consistent with a dimethylated D1-(92–119) peptide (Fig. 2). Two additional peaks of 3252.85 and 3380.65 Da corresponded to D1-(92–119) and D1-(91–119) peptides with an additional methyl group, due to esterification of the carboxyl termini upon storage in an acidified methanolic solution. The MALDI-TOF analysis of D1 thus not only demonstrated the presence of posttranslational modifications in the C terminus of D1, but also strongly suggested the presence of DMAs. To confirm the results of our mass spectrometry experiments and to distinguish between asymmetrically and symmetrically dimethylated arginines (see Fig. 3), we analyzed the C-terminal D1 and D3 peptides by protein sequencing. For this purpose, we not only used the normal PTH-derivative standard during the sequencing run but additionally applied MMA, aDMA, and sDMA as a standard for the HPLC-based identification of amino acids. Fig.3 A shows an alignment of the Edman degradation cycles of the gel-purified C-terminal peptide of HeLa D1 with the HPLC elution profiles of PTH-modified MMA, aDMA, and sDMA (indicated byarrows). We obtained a clear separation of arginine, MMA, aDMA, and sDMA (Fig. 3, A and B). When we compared the elution profiles of the C-terminal peptide of HeLa D1 with the applied standards, we could reproducibly identify symmetrical DMAs in the C terminus of D1. As emphasized by the cycle numbers in Fig.3 A (only the cycles corresponding to the arginines are shown), sDMA is present at all nine positions in the RG-rich stretch of D1. Only the arginines at positions 2, 28, and 29 of the D1 peptide (positions 92, 118, and 119 of D1), which are not flanked by glycines, were not dimethylated (data not shown), thus providing evidence that the methyltransferase modifying D1 recognizes solely its RG repeat. In agreement with our mass spectrometry experiments (Fig. 2), we could not observe even minor peaks corresponding to arginine or MMA (see Fig.3 A). The absence of detectable amounts of undermethylated D1 precursors in HeLa nuclear extracts may hint at a cytoplasmic localization of the D1-modifying methyltransferase. In the D3-derived peptide encompassing amino acid residues 105–124, four symmetrically methylated arginines at positions 110, 112, 114, and 118 of the D3 protein were identified (data not shown). Interestingly, the sDMA at position 110 of D3, in contrast to all other modified arginines in the RG-rich stretches of D1 and D3, was not preceded by a glycine (alanine instead of glycine; see Fig. 1). This raised the possibility that such RG dipeptides generally could serve as substrates for posttranslational methylation. However, RG dipeptides present in the Sm motif 2 of D1 and D3 (amino acid 61 in D1 and 64 in D3; Fig. 1) were not modified. Also, methylated arginines were not found in the single RG dipeptides present in the Sm proteins E, F, G, and D2 (data not shown). As observed with D1, the sDMA precursors arginine and MMA were not detected in D3. These results thus demonstrated that, in contrast to several RGG box-containing proteins that contain asymmetrical DMA, the human Sm proteins D1 and D3 are symmetrically dimethylated. Moreover, since we isolated the D1 and D3 proteins from biochemically purified HeLa UsnRNPs, symmetrical dimethylation of D1 and D3 occurs in vivo. D1 overexpressed in E. coli has been reported to react only weakly and sometimes unspecifically with patient sera (see Introduction). Moreover, the prototypical anti-Sm antibody, Y12 (39.Lerner E.A. Lerner M.R. Janeway C.A. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2737-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), strongly reacted with native D1, D3, and B/B′ in immunoblots but not with recombinant D1 overexpressed in E. coli (Ref. 16.Lehmeier T. Foulaki K. Lührmann R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6475-6484Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar and data not shown). It was thus conceivable that the B-cell epitopes recognized by Y12, and by at least some anti-Sm autoantibody populations, require sDMA for efficient recognition. To investigate this hypothesis, we overexpressed D1 in either E. coli or in baculovirus-infected insect cells. For one-step purification by nickel affinity chromatography, both proteins were overexpressed as fusion proteins containing the first 25 amino acids of mouse tumor necrosis factor and six histidines (see “Experimental Procedures”). In electrospray mass spectrometry, we observed a mass of 17,435 Da for theE. coli-derived D1, which was the expected mass for the full-size fusion protein without any posttranslational modifications. In contrast, the purified D1 from the baculovirus expression system yielded several peaks with significantly higher masses (data not shown), thus providing evidence that posttranslational methylation of recombinant D1 had taken place. To further investigate the dimethylation status of the baculo-derived D1, we performed protein sequencing as described for the HeLa-derived D1 protein (see Fig.3 B). Although we could isolate a minor HPLC fraction containing nonmodified peptide D1-(91–119), the majority of the baculo-derived D1 was indeed dimethylated, as predicted by the mass spectrometry (see above). However, in contrast to the HeLa-derived D1 protein, the baculo-derived protein contained asymmetrical, as opposed to symmetrical, dimethylarginines (see Fig. 3 B). The less prominent peaks preceding the aDMAs in the HPLC elution profiles in Fig. 3 B co-eluted with the dimethylation precursors, arginine and MMA. To analyze the immunological properties of the recombinant D1 proteins, we applied equal amounts of baculo-derived D1, E. coli-derived D1, and a mixture of gel-purified human D1, D2, and D3 (HeLa D1/D2/D3 in Fig. 4 A), which served as a positive control, to nylon strips. The strips were then incubated with anti-Sm sera from SLE patients and the monoclonal anti-Sm antibody Y12. As negative controls, we used sera from patients with mixed connective tissue disease, containing high titers of anti-RNP autoantibodies against the U1-A, U1-C, and U1–70K proteins (RNP-positive in Fig. 4) as well as sera from healthy patients that did not contain antinuclear autoantibodies (ANA-negative in Fig. 4). While a mixture of D1, D2, and D3 from HeLa cells reacted significantly with all of the tested anti-Sm patient sera, the E. coli-derived D1 gave only weak signals, which were in the intensity range of signals obtained with control sera (compare D-positive sera with ANA-negative and RNP-positive sera in Fig. 4 A). Interestingly, also the baculo-derived D1 reacted only weakly with anti-Sm patient sera; only four bands of significant intensity were observed"
https://openalex.org/W2087775278,"Recently, several mammalian K+channel subunits (TWIK, TREK-1, TRAAK, and TASK) possessing four transmembrane segments and two pore-forming domains have been identified. We report the cloning of a new member of this tandem-pore K+ channel from a rat cerebellum cDNA library. It is a 538-amino acid protein and shares 65% amino acid sequence identity with TREK-1. Therefore, the new clone was named TREK-2. Unlike TREK-1, whose mRNA has been reported to be expressed in many different tissues, TREK-2 mRNA is expressed mainly in the cerebellum, spleen, and testis as judged by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Northern blot analysis. Expression of TREK-2 in COS-7 cells induced a time-independent and non-inactivating K+-selective current. TREK-2 was partially blocked (36%) by 2 mmBa2+. In symmetrical 150 mm KCl, the single-channel conductances were 110 picosiemens at −40 mV and 68 picosiemens at +40 mV, and the mean open time was 0.9 ms at −40 mV. TREK-2 was activated by membrane stretch or acidic pH. At −40 mm Hg pressure, channel activity increased 10-fold above the basal level. TREK-2 was also activated by arachidonic acid and other naturally occurring unsaturated free fatty acids. These results show that TREK-2 is a new member of the tandem-pore K+ channel family and belongs to the class of mechanosensitive and fatty acid-stimulated K+ channels.

In the 2P/4TM K+ channel family, two members have been named TREK-1 (TWIK-related K+ channel) and TRAAK (TWIK-related arachidonic acid-stimulated K+ channel).

Thus, they may represent the native mechanosensitive and fatty acid-sensitive K+ channels that were identified earlier in various cell types (21.Ordway R.W. Walsh Jr., J.V. Singer J.J.

In cardiac and neuronal cells, arachidonic acid has been shown to cause opening of three types of K+ channels (KFA channels) whose current-voltage relationships are outwardly rectifying, inwardly rectifying, or linear (24.Kim D. Sladek C.D. Aguado-Velasco C. Mathiasen J.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 484.3: 643-660Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Based on the reported electrophysiological and pharmacological characteristics (10.Fink M. Duprat F. Lesage F. Reyes R. Romey G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6854-6862Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 12.Fink M. Lesage F. Duprat F. Heurteaux C. Reyes R. Fosset M. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3297-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), TREK-1 is most likely to encode the K+ channel that has an outwardly rectifying current-voltage relationship. In this study, we report the cloning of a new member (TREK-2) 2TREK-2 has been assigned the gene nameKCNK10 (approved by the Human Genome Organization). of the 2P/4TM K+ channel family whose single-channel current-voltage relationship shows inward rectification. TREK-2 shares 65 and 45% amino acid identities with TREK-1 and TRAAK, respectively, but <30% with other 2P/4TM K+ channels. Our results show that TREK-2 is mainly expressed in the cerebellum. When expressed in COS-7 cells, TREK-2 exhibits an instantaneous and non-inactivating K+-selective current with high sensitivity to mechanical stretch and free fatty acids and shows biophysical properties nearly identical to those of the inwardly rectifying K+ channel previously described in the rat brain (24.Kim D. Sladek C.D. Aguado-Velasco C. Mathiasen J.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 484.3: 643-660Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Total RNA from rat cerebellum was reversed-transcribed using oligo(dT) to generate first strand cDNA (Superscript pre-amplification system, Life Technologies, Inc.). A DNA fragment of 421 bp was obtained by RT-PCR using TRAAK-specific primers (5′-CAATAGCAGCAACCACTC-3′ and 5′-GTACATAATCGCCAAAGC-3′). The DNA fragment was labeled with 32P and used to screen the rat cerebellum cDNA library (λZAP II, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Hybridization was carried out in 20% formamide, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 0.2 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA at 42 °C for 15 h. Filters were washed twice with the solution containing 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS for 15 min at room temperature. Of 1 × 106 phages screened, 12 positive clones were obtained from the cerebellum cDNA library. DNA inserts were excised from the λZAP II vector into pBluescript SK− and analyzed by restriction analysis. Four DNA inserts were sequenced using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. One clone (1.45 kb) contained a partial sequence of a new 4TM K+ channel as judged by the presence of two pore-forming domains. The same cDNA library was screened again with a 921-bp DNA fragment obtained by cutting with EcoRI. Two positive clones included the entire coding region of a new 4TM K+ channel (pBS-TREK-2). Rat multiple-tissue Northern blots were purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) and OriGene Technologies, Inc. (Rockville, MD). The membranes were prehybridized for 30 min at 65 °C and hybridized for 3 h at 65 °C in ExpressHyb solution (CLONTECH) with a 32P-labeled 597-bp DNA fragment following the manufacturer's protocol. This DNA fragment is part of the C terminus of TREK-2 and was obtained by PCR using pBS-TREK-2 as template and TREK-2-specific primers (5′-GGCTAATGTCA CTGCTGAGTTCC-3′ and 5′-AAGCCACACTTTAGTCCAGCT CC-3′). The membranes were rinsed with solution containing 2× SSC and 0.05% SDS for 40 min at room temperature. A second washing was performed in solution containing 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS for ∼50 min at 50 °C. The membranes were exposed to an x-ray film and developed 24–36 h later. The membranes were probed again with 32P-labeled β-actin DNA. For RT-PCR, total RNAs were extracted from 14 rat tissues (RNA STAT-60, TEL-TEST Inc.), and their integrity was checked by gel electrophoresis. Total RNAs were reverse-transcribed using an oligo(dT) primer using the Superscript pre-amplification system. The first strand cDNA was used as template for PCR amplification using rat TREK-2 primers that yield the 597-bp TREK-2 fragment (see above). As a control, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was amplified using specific primers (CLONTECH). PCR amplification was performed as follows: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min; 30 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 1 min (60 °C in the case of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), and 72 °C for 2 min; and a final extension step at 72 °C for 8 min. For transfection into COS-7 cells, the coding region of rat TREK-2 was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) by ligating into theEcoRV-XhoI site after cutting pBS-TREK-2 withSmaI and XhoI. Cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells/35-mm dish 24 h prior to transfection. pcDNA3.1/TREK-2 and pcDNA3.1/GFP were cotransfected into COS-7 cells with LipoTaxi reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Green fluorescence from cells expressing GFP was detected using a Nikon microscope equipped with a mercury lamp light source. Cells were used 1–3 days after transfection. Electrophysiological recording was performed in the whole-cell, cell-attached patch, inside-out patch, and outside-out patch configurations using a patch clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200, Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA). In experiments using excised patches, pipettes and bath solutions contained 150 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3). In whole-cell recordings, the bath solution contained 145 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3). All recordings were performed at room temperature (22–24 °C). Currents were digitized with a digital data recorder (VR10, Instrutech, Great Neck, NY) and stored on videotape. The recorded signal was filtered at 5 kHz using an 8-pole Bessel filter (−3 dB; Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA) and transferred to a computer (Dell) using the Digidata 1200 interface (Axon Instruments, Inc.) at a sampling rate of 20 kHz. Whole-cell and single-channel currents were analyzed with the pClamp program (Version 7). Data were analyzed to obtain a duration histogram, an amplitude histogram, and relative channel activity (relative NP o). The filter dead time was ∼100 μs (0.3/cutoff frequency). Therefore, events shorter than ∼50 μs will be missed in our analysis. When studying the effect of membrane tension and free fatty acids using patches that contain many channel openings (more than five channel levels), currents were integrated over time to determine the relative channel activity.N is the number of channels in the patch, andP o is the probability of a channel being open.NP o was determined from ∼1 min of current recording. Current tracings shown in the figures were filtered at 1 kHz. Data are represented as mean ± S.D. Student's ttest was used to test for significance at the level of 0.05. All free fatty acids in liquid form were first dissolved in chloroform and kept in a −80 °C freezer. The solvent (chloroform) was evaporated, and free fatty acids were dissolved by sonicating for 10 min (Heat Systems-Ultrasonics, Inc., Farmingdale, NY) in bath recording solution at a desired concentration. Free fatty acids in powder form were dissolved in ethanol. The final ethanol or Me2SO concentration in the perfusion solution used was <0.1% and had no effect on the TREK-2 channel activity. All free fatty acids were purchased from Sigma. Negative pressure was applied using a plastic syringe via tubing connected to the pipette holder and monitored using a mercury manometer attached in parallel to the tubing. A steady negative pressure could be obtained using this system. H-7 (1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine) was purchased from Calbiochem. All other chemicals and drugs were from Sigma. A 421-bp DNA fragment from rat TRAAK was used to screen a rat cerebellum cDNA library under mild stringency conditions. Two positive clones containing a coding region of a new 2P/4TM K+ channel subunit was identified. The DNA sequence revealed an open reading frame of 1617 bases that encodes a 538-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 60 kDa (Fig.1 A). A stop codon (TAA) was present in the 5′-region upstream of the first methionine, indicating that the DNA contains the complete coding sequence for a protein. Hydrophobicity analysis (25.Kyte J. Doolittle R. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 162-166Crossref Scopus (17296) Google Scholar) of the amino acid sequence showed that the new clone belongs to the K+ channel family with two pore-forming domains and four transmembrane segments (Fig.1 B). We placed the N terminus in the intracellular side, similar to those of other tandem-pore K+ channels. Thus, the putative K+ channel subunit has a short N terminus, an extended extracellular loop between M1 and P1, and a long C terminus, structural features typical of nearly all 4TM K+ channels (Fig. 1 C). Two N-glycosylation sites (Asn144 and Asn147) are present in the extracellular loop between M1 and P1. The amino acid sequence of the new clone shows potential phosphorylation sites for protein kinases A and C in the C terminus (Ser359 and Thr475) as indicated. Searching the GenBankTM Data Bank using the BLAST sequence alignment program (26.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) identified a human homologue of rat TREK-2 in the genomic sequences of chromosome 14 (accession numbers AL133279 andAL122021) with 93% amino acid identity. The human TREK-2 DNA was distributed in eight different locations with seven intervening sequences, as illustrated in the gene map (Fig.2 C). In the dbest data base, we found one expressed sequence tag sequence (accession numberAI073392) of which 147 bp was similar to the M2 region of TREK-2 (851–991 bp of the open reading frame). The search also revealed that the DNA sequence of the new clone is similar to those of TREK-1 and TRAAK, which are 2P/4TM K+ channel subunits (10.Fink M. Duprat F. Lesage F. Reyes R. Romey G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6854-6862Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 12.Fink M. Lesage F. Duprat F. Heurteaux C. Reyes R. Fosset M. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3297-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Alignment of the DNA sequence of the new clone with those of TREK-1 and TRAAK shows high homology within the transmembrane and pore-forming domains (Fig. 2 A). The new clone shares 65 and 45% amino acid sequence identities with TREK-1 and TRAAK, respectively. Therefore, the new clone is a third member of the TREK/TRAAK family of 4TM K+ channels. The dendrogram of all tandem-pore K+ channels identified to date in the mammalian system is shown in Fig. 2 B. Rat TASK-3 (KCNK9) was just recently identified in our laboratory (GenBankTM accession numberAF192366). The percentage indicates amino acid identity between two subunits. Thus, closely related subunit groups exist within the 2P/4TM K+ channel family such as TWIK, TASK, TREK, and KCNK6/7 groups. Homology between different groups of subunits is very low (∼20%). The expression of TREK-2 mRNA in adult rat tissues was examined by Northern blot analysis and RT-PCR. TREK-2-specific primers were used to generate a 597-bp DNA fragment in the C terminus of TREK-2 and used as probe. The first blot shows that of the eight tissues, the brain shows a distinct band with an estimated size of 7.5 kb. Interestingly, a diffuse band located between 3 and 5 kb was present in the pancreas. To further localize the expression of TREK-2 within the brain, a blot in which total RNAs from six different regions of rat brain were separated was used. A major RNA transcript with an estimated size of ∼7.5 kb was detected in the cerebellum. RT-PCR was carried out to further determine the expression of TREK-2 mRNA in various tissues (Fig.3 B). The expected 597-bp PCR products of TREK-2, confirmed by sequencing, were detected in three tissues. The strongest signal was present in the cerebellum, confirming the results of the Northern blot analysis. Spleen and testis showed relatively weak signals. Control reactions performed in the absence of reverse transcriptase in four tissue samples (cerebellum, spleen, testis, and kidney) did not yield any visible bands under identical conditions. To determine whether TREK-2 forms a functional ion channel, the coding region of TREK-2 was subcloned into a mammalian expression vector (pcDNA3.1) and transiently transfected along with DNA that encodes GFP into COS-7 cell. Fig. 4 Ashows whole-cell currents recorded in nontransfected and transfected COS-7 cells in bath solution containing 5 mm K+and in pipette solution containing 150 mm K+. Cell membrane potential was held at −80 mV and stepped to various potentials for 430-ms duration. Cells transfected with GFP alone showed small currents of <200 pA (95 ± 40 pA at +20 mV,n = 5). Cells that were transfected with TREK-2/GFP showed instantaneous and non-inactivating currents in the nA range. The averaged current at +20 mV in cells transfected with TREK-2 was 2.5 ± 0.9 nA (n = 4). Thus, TREK-2 forms a functional ion channel in the plasma membrane of COS-7 cells. Current-voltage relationships obtained from cells transfected with GFP alone and GFP/TREK-2 are shown in Fig. 4 B. In nontransfected cells, the reversal potential was found to be close to zero (−9 ± 7 mV, n = 4), indicating that only small background leak current was present. The reversal potential shifted to −74 ± 4 mV (n = 3) after transfection with TREK-2, as expected if functional K+ channels were expressed. Ion selectivity of TREK-2 was studied using large outside-out patches containing many channels by changing the concentration of K+ in the bath solution from 5 to 150 mm while maintaining the pipette [K+] constant at 150 mm. A voltage ramp from −80 to +20 mV was applied to the patch, and currents from three trials were averaged for each concentration of K+. The reversal potential shifted to the right as [K+] in the bath solution was elevated, as expected of an ion channel that is permeable to K+, but not to Cl− (Fig. 4 C). A plot of the reversal potential as a function of [K+]out showed that the slope was 53 ± 2 mV (n = 4) per 10-fold change in [K+]out, close to the calculated Nernst value of 59 mV at 22 °C (Fig. 4 D). In patches obtained from cells transfected with GFP alone, a basal current level of <5 pA was present at +20 mV. These results show that TREK-2 is a relatively K+-selective ion channel, similar to other two-pore K+ channels. In cell-attached and inside-out patches, channel openings with marked open channel noise were present in cells transfected with TREK-2/GFP, but not with GFP alone. Channel openings at different membrane potentials from an inside-out patch are shown in Fig.5 A when both pipette and bath solutions contained 150 mm KCl. An open-time histogram was determined from patches showing only one level of opening at −40 mV such as that shown in Fig. 5 A (Fig. 5 B). The mean open time of TREK-2 determined from five patches was 0.9 ± 0.1 ms. Mean open time at positive potentials could not be determined due to clustered multiple openings. Amplitude histograms obtained from channel openings at +40 and −40 mV are shown in Fig. 5 C. Despite the open channel noise, amplitude levels could be visually identified, as indicated by dotted lines. Single-channel current-voltage relationship determined using the mean amplitude values at different voltages shows that TREK-2 is an inwardly rectifying K+ channel in symmetrical 150 mmK+. The single-channel conductances were 68 ± 16 picosiemens at +40 mV and 110 ± 9 picosiemens at −40 mV (n = 3) (Fig. 5 D). TREK-2 channel activity was always more active at depolarized than at hyperpolarized potentials. Therefore, channel activities were determined at various potentials from five patches and are plotted in Fig. 5 E. The data clearly show that the open probability increases as the cell membrane depolarizes. This explains the linear or slightly outwardly rectifying whole-cell current-voltage relationships of TREK-2 currents in COS-7 cells (Fig. 4), despite the inward rectification of single-channel currents. The effects of various pharmacological agents and pH were examined on TREK-2 current using large outside-out patches from COS-7 cells in symmetrical 150 mm KCl. TREK-2 was insensitive to low concentrations of Ba2+ (100–500 μm) and blocked only at high concentrations. Ba2+ at 2 mm applied extracellularly blocked the inward TREK-2 currents by 36 ± 5% (−40 mV, n = 3). TREK-2 was insensitive to 1 mm tetraethylammonium, 100 μm quinidine, 1 mm lidocaine, 100 μm bupivacaine, and 100 μm gadolinium when applied extracellularly (<5% change; −80 and +80 mV,n = 4 each). We examined the effect of changes in intracellular pH on TREK-2 using inside-out patches. At −40 mV, changes in pHi from 7.3 to 6.8 and 7.8 resulted in 4.0 ± 1.4- and 0.4 ± 0.2-fold changes from basal channel activity observed at pH 7.3 (basal NP o = 0.17 ± 0.15,n = 8), respectively. Thus, TREK-2 is stimulated markedly by acidic pH and inhibited mildly by alkaline pH. TREK-2 possesses potential phosphorylation sites for both protein kinases A and C. Therefore, the effects of activators of protein kinases A and C were tested on TREK-2 in bath solution containing 5 mm K+ and 1 mm Ca2+using cell-attached patch configuration. Membrane potential was held at −60 mV, and changes in channel activity was determined. Extracellular application for 5 min of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (100 nm), an activator of protein kinase C, failed to significantly alter TREK-2 current in three cells. Application of 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (200 μm), a permeant derivative of cAMP, to increase intracellular cAMP levels resulted in a 66 ± 13% (n = 4) decrease in channel activity at the end of a 3-min period. This inhibition by 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP was reduced by 58 ± 12% (n = 3) by pretreatment with H-7 (25 μm), a protein kinase A inhibitor. Application of 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (200 μm), which should also increase cAMP concentration in the cell and activate protein kinase A, resulted in 85 ± 5% (n = 3) inhibition of channel activity after 3 min of perfusion. Thus, phosphorylation by protein kinase A caused a significant reduction of TREK-2 current, whereas phosphorylation by protein kinase C had no effect. Whether TREK-2 is sensitive to membrane stretch was assessed by applying negative pressure to the patch membrane. In cell-attached patches, a basal level of channel activity was usually present under normal atmospheric pressure. Applying negative pressure (−40 mm Hg) to the patch membrane increased channel activity in every cell that contained TREK-2. In 11 out of 12 patches obtained from cells transfected with GFP only, application of negative pressure even up to 80 mm Hg failed to activate channels. In one patch, a small conductance channel (15 picosiemens) was activated by negative pressure. In inside-out patches from cells transfected with TREK-2, the basal activity at atmospheric pressure was also observed, but tended to be higher than that in the cell-attached patch in most patches. Using inside-out patches with relatively low basal activity, we tested the effect of negative pressure on TREK-2. At a holding potential of −40 mV, application of negative pressure (0 to −80 mm Hg) produced a rapid increase in channel activity in every patch studied (Fig. 6 A). Return of pressure to the atmospheric level (0 mm Hg) resulted in a quick return of TREK-2 to basal activity. No desensitization of channel activity was observed when the negative pressure (−40 mm Hg) was held constant for >3 min. Relative channel activity plotted as a function of applied pressure is shown in Fig. 6 B. We were unable to determine channel activity at pressures less than −80 mm Hg, as patches became leaky and eventually broke. Therefore, the pressure at which half-maximal activation occurs could not be determined. These results show that TREK-2, like TREK-1 and TRAAK, is a mechanosensitive K+ channel. Whether TREK-2 is sensitive to free fatty acids was tested using inside-out and outside-out patches. As shown in Fig.7 A, arachidonic acid (AA) increased channel activity in a concentration-dependent manner when applied to the cytoplasmic side of inside-out patches. Onset of activation was generally rapid, and steady-state activation was observed within 30 s after application. High concentrations of AA (30–50 μm) did not further increase channel activity above that produced by 20 μm and generally caused patches to become unstable and leaky. In Fig. 7 B, relative channel activities were plotted as a function of [AA]. With the reasonable assumption that 20 μm AA produces maximal activation of TREK-2, averaged data from eight patches were fitted to a Hill equation of the following form: y = 1/(1 + (K 12/[AA]) n), whereK 12 is the apparent concentration of AA that produces half-maximal activation and n is the Hill coefficient (apparent K 12 = 7.3 μm, Hill coefficient = 2.2). We tested whether other free fatty acids are also able to activate TREK-2. When applied to the cytoplasmic side of inside-out patches, docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, linolenic acid, linoleic acid, and oleic acid all strongly and reversibly stimulated TREK-2 current at 20 μm (Fig.7 C). Elaidic acid, the trans-isomer ofcis-oleic acid, failed to activate TREK-2, indicating that structural specificity exists for TREK-2 activation. Saturated free fatty acids such as stearic acid and palmitic acid did not increase TREK-2 channel activity even up to 100 μm. We also tested whether free fatty acids could activate TREK-2 from the extracellular side of the membrane. In outside-out patches, extracellular application of linoleic and oleic acids caused 9 ± 3- and 6 ± 2-fold increases above the basal level, respectively (n = 3 each). Elaidic acid, stearic acid, and palmitic acid failed to significantly increase TREK-2 activity from the extracellular side of the membrane (<2% change from three patches each). Examples of activation by AA, linoleic acid, and oleic acid in inside-out and outside-out patches are shown in Fig. 7 D. These results show that TREK-2 is activated by long-chain unsaturated free fatty acids. In this study, we report the cloning and expression of TREK-2, a new member of the 2P/4TM K+ channel family. TREK-2 forms a functional K+ channel when expressed in COS-7 cells and is activated by membrane stretch and unsaturated free fatty acids, a hallmark of the TREK/TRAAK group of the 2P/4TM K+ channel subfamily (12.Fink M.

In the rat, the distribution of TREK-2 mRNA was mainly in the cerebellum, suggesting that TREK-2 may have a unique role in this part of the brain. We have previously identified and characterized a family of K+channels in cardiac and neuronal cells and have referred to them as KAA and KFA channels, as they were activated by arachidonic acid and other free fatty acids (23.Kim D. Duff R. Circ. Res. 1990; 67: 1040-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 24.Kim D. Sladek C.D. Aguado-Velasco C. Mathiasen J.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 484.3: 643-660Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 27.Kim D. Clapham D.E. Science. 1989; 244: 1174-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). It was also found that membrane stretch can cause activation of these K+ channels (24.Kim D. Sladek C.D. Aguado-Velasco C. Mathiasen J.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 484.3: 643-660Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 28.Kim D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). K+ channels with similar properties were also identified in smooth muscle cells and in a colonic secretory cell line (21.Ordway R.W. Walsh Jr., J.V. Singer J.J. Science. 1989; 244: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 29.Devor D.C. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C149-C160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gating kinetics of the KFA channels are unique in that they show extremely high open channel noise even in the absence of any channel blocker or divalent cations. Furthermore, none of the organic K+channel blockers tested (1 mm) caused a significant inhibition of K+ channel activity. Therefore, the KFA channels were thought to belong to a new family of K+ channels with distinct function and structure. Recent cloning and expression studies show that the TREK/TRAAK members of the 2P/4TM K+ channel family are likely to encode the KFA channels. TREK-1 and TRAAK have been shown to be activated by membrane stretch and free fatty acids and have biophysical properties similar to those of native KFA channels. Thus, both KFA channels and TREK/TRAAK show marked open channel noise, opening in bursts, lack of block by organic K+channel blockers, and large single-channel conductance (100–130 picosiemens at negative potentials). We have previously identified in isolated neurons from rat brain three different types of KFA channels by applying either suction or free fatty acids (24.Kim D. Sladek C.D. Aguado-Velasco C. Mathiasen J.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 484.3: 643-660Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The current-voltage relationships of the three KFA channels were outwardly rectifying, inwardly rectifying, and linear, allowing unambiguous identification of each type of KFA channel. TREK-1 shows an outwardly rectifying single-channel current-voltage relationship in high [K+] solution, with conductances similar to those of the native KFA channel (10.Fink M. Duprat F. Lesage F. Reyes R. Romey G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6854-6862Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 30.Maingret F. Patel A.J. Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Honore E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26691-26696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Single channels of TREK-2, on the other hand, shows clear inwardly rectifying behavior in high [K+] solution, with conductances similar to those of another native KFA channel described earlier (24.Kim D. Sladek C.D. Aguado-Velasco C. Mathiasen J.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 484.3: 643-660Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Therefore, TREK-1 and TREK-2 probably represent two of the three KFA channels that we have identified in the neurons. At present, a native KFA channel whose single-channel kinetic properties are similar to those of TRAAK has not yet been described. When TREK-2 is expressed in mammalian cells such as COS-7 cells, a basal level of channel activity is normally present. Similarly, TREK-1 exhibits some basal current when expressed in COS cells (10.Fink M. Duprat F. Lesage F. Reyes R. Romey G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6854-6862Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 19.Patel A.J. Honore E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4283-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). The basal current that is present at resting membrane potential is expected to drive the membrane potential toward the K+ equilibrium potential. TREK/TRAAK current is activated instantaneously by a voltage step, does not inactivate with time, and shows no voltage threshold for activation. These properties of TREK/TRAAK suggest that they would serve as background currents that help to set the resting membrane potential. In addition, they might serve as sensors for changes in osmotic pressure and free fatty acids and be involved in mechano- and metabolism-electrical coupling, respectively. Mechanosensitive ion channels have been identified in various mammalian cell types, but how membrane tension opens and modulates ion channels is not known (31.Sachs F. Membr. Biochem. 1986; 6: 173-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 32.Morris C.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 113: 93-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 33.Sackin H. Annu. Rev.

A. 1998; 95: 11471-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In summary, we have cloned TREK-2, an inwardly rectifying K+ channel that belongs to the 2P/4TM K+channel family. The biophysical properties of TREK-2, together with its sensitivity to membrane stretch and free fatty acids, indicate that theTREK-2 gene probably encodes an inwardly rectifying KFA channel that we have identified earlier in neurons. The physiological significance of KFA/TREK/TRAAK channels is not evident at present, although they are expected to be involved in the regulation of resting membrane potential, if they are active at rest in vivo. One could speculate that activation of these channels in specific tissues might help to protect the cell against damage produced by hypoxia or ischemia, which causes a rise in intracellular free fatty acids and cell swelling and intracellular acidosis (36.Bazan N.G.J.

Thiolactomycin (TLM) is a unique thiolactone that has been shown to exhibit anti-mycobacterial activity by specifically inhibiting fatty acid and mycolic acid biosynthesis. In this study, we present evidence that TLM targets two β-ketoacyl-acyl-carrier protein synthases, KasA and KasB, consistent with the fact that both enzymes belong to the fatty-acid synthase type II system involved in fatty acid and mycolic acid biosynthesis. Overexpression of KasA, KasB, and KasAB in Mycobacterium bovis BCG increased in vivo and in vitroresistance against TLM. In addition, a multidrug-resistant clinical isolate was also found to be highly sensitive to TLM, indicating promise in counteracting multidrug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis. The design and synthesis of several TLM derivatives have led to compounds more potent both in vitro against fatty acid and mycolic acid biosynthesis and in vivoagainst M. tuberculosis.

The situation has recently been exacerbated by the human immunodeficiency virus pandemic and the increased prevalence of multidrug-resistant strains ofMycobacterium tuberculosis (2.Smith P.G.

Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar). Mycolic acids are key components of the mycobacterial cell wall and may play a role as an effective lipophilic barrier to the penetration of some antibiotics (11.Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar). Considering the importance of mycolic acids in bacterial survival, enzymes involved in the metabolism of these specific molecules represent attractive targets for the design of new anti-mycobacterial agents. Although there has been controversy about the mechanism of action of INH, it is clear that disruption of mycolic acid biosynthesis is one of its earliest detectable effects. This is apparently achieved through inhibition of inhA, an enoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase, a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of fatty acids and mycolic acids (9.Banerjee A. Dubnau E. Quémard A. Balasubramanian V. Ulm K.S. Wilson T. Collins D. De Lisle G. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Science. 1994; 263: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). However, mutations within katG, which encodes a catalase-peroxidase enzyme, lead to the majority of INH-resistant isolates (8.Zhang Y. Heym B. Allen B. Young D. Cole S. Nature. 1992; 358: 591-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar), demonstrating that INH is a prodrug and that an activated metabolite is responsible for its mode of action (12.Blanchard J.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 215-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Presumably, inhA is the primary target for the activated form of INH, and indeed, mutations in the inhA gene account for some cases of INH resistance inM. tuberculosis. More recently, mutations have also been observed within clinical M. tuberculosis isolates resistant to INH, traceable to kasA, which encodes a β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase, another key enzyme involved in mycolic acid biosynthesis (10.Mdluli K.

In addition, we have previously demonstrated that TLM acts as a potent anti-tuberculosis agent by inhibiting both fatty acid and mycolic acid biosynthesis in mycobacteria (18.Slayden R.A. Lee R.E. Armour J.W. Cooper A.M. Orme I.M. Brennan P.J. Besra G.S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 2813-2819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In light of this clinical aspect and of recent genomic information, we have reexamined the mode of action of TLM in mycobacteria. In this study, we have established that KasA and KasB, which both possess a high degree of similarity with other Kas enzymes, are targets for TLM. In addition, we have extended this study in the search of new anti-tuberculosis agents by generating a hypothetical structure of KasA to assist in future drug design and synthesized several lipophilic TLM derivatives. These analogues possess improved activities both in vitro against fatty acid and mycolic acid biosynthesis and in vivo against M. tuberculosis. This opens up new avenues for exploring the development of novel anti-mycobacterial agents based on TLM inhibition of Kas proteins in M. tuberculosis.DISCUSSIONThe antibiotic TLM is a selective inhibitor of type II fatty acid biosynthesis, is not toxic to mice, and affords significant protection against urinary tract and intraperitoneal bacterial infections (13.Hayashi T.

(Tokyo). 1982; 325: 411-419Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). TLM has moderate in vitro activity against a broad spectrum of pathogens, including Gram-positive cocci and enteric, acid-fast, and anaerobic bacteria (15.Furukawa H. Tsay J.T. Jackowski S. Takamura Y. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3723-3729Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 17.Miyakawa S. Suzuki K. Noto T. Harada Y. Okazaki H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1982; 325: 411-419Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). More recently, TLM has shown encouraging anti-malarial activity via inhibition of type-II fatty acid biosynthesis in apicoplasts (41.Waller R.F. Keeling P.J. Donald R.G.K. Striepen B. Handman E. Lang-Unnasch N. Cowman A.F. Besra G.S. Roos D.S. McFadden G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12352-12357Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). In E. coli, all three condensing enzymes (FabB, FabF, and FabH) are inhibited by TLM both in vivo and in vitro (42.Jackowski S. Sutcliffe J. Georgopapadakou N.H. Emerging Targets in Antibacterial and Antifungal Chemotherapy. Routledge, Chapman and Hall, New York1992: 151-162Crossref Google Scholar). In contrast, TLM has no effect on type I fatty acid biosynthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, or rat liver (17.Miyakawa S. Suzuki K. Noto T. Harada Y. Okazaki H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1982; 325: 411-419Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar).The effect of TLM in mycobacteria has recently been investigated and shown to inhibit specifically the type II but not type I fatty-acid synthases (18.Slayden R.A. Lee R.E. Armour J.W. Cooper A.M. Orme I.M. Brennan P.J. Besra G.S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 2813-2819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we present evidence that overexpression of KasA or KasB individually or co-expression of both enzymes inM. bovis BCG results in increased resistance levels against TLM. Subsequent MIC determinations using a variety of agents that require penetration through the mycobacterial cell wall (such as rifampicin and other well characterized mycolic acid inhibitors, including INH) suggest that TLM sensitivity is not likely to be mediated by cell wall permeability and that its mechanism of action is dissimilar to other known mycolic acid inhibitors (8.Zhang Y. Heym B. Allen B. Young D. Cole S. Nature. 1992; 358: 591-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar, 9.Banerjee A. Dubnau E. Quémard A. Balasubramanian V. Ulm K.S. Wilson T. Collins D.

Barry III, C.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1607-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Overexpression studies provided indirect evidence that KasA and KasB are TLM targets. Further in vivo metabolic labeling and, more importantly, in vitro analyses demonstrated clearly that overexpression of KasA and KasB mediated a protective effect in both a mycobacterial FAS-II assay system (30.Bloch K. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 35: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 31.Bloch K. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1977; 45: 1-84PubMed Google Scholar) and a mycolic acid synthesizing extract to TLM (18.Slayden R.A. Lee R.E. Armour J.W. Cooper A.M. Orme I.M. Brennan P.J. Besra G.S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 2813-2819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Wheeler P.R. Besra G.S. Minnikin D.E. Ratledge C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1167: 182-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It was also interesting to note that TLM inhibition studies using extracts from M. bovis BCG carrying either pMV261::kasA or pMV261::kasB suggest that KasA may participate in the synthesis of C18-C34 fatty acids, whereas KasB may be involved in later steps of mycolic acid biosynthesis. These results have recently been supported by independent studies conducted by Slayden et al. (43.Slayden, R. A., Ramaswamy, S., Musser, J. M., and Barry, C. E., III (1999) Fourth International Conference on the Pathogenesis of Mycobacterial Infections, Stockholm, Sweden, July 8–11, 1999 p. 156Google Scholar).Mutations in KasA (D66N, G269S, G312S, and F413L), which correlate with low-levels of INH resistance, are thought to inhibit the formation of a trimolecular complex consisting of KasA-INH-AcpM (10.Mdluli K. Slayden R.A. Zhu Y. Ramaswamy S. Pan X. Mead D. Crane D.D. Musser J.M. Barry III, C.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1607-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 43.Slayden, R. A., Ramaswamy, S., Musser, J. M., and Barry, C. E., III (1999) Fourth International Conference on the Pathogenesis of Mycobacterial Infections, Stockholm, Sweden, July 8–11, 1999 p. 156Google Scholar). Interestingly, Lee et al. (44.Lee A.S. Lim I.H. Tang L.L. Telenti A. Wong S.Y. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 2087-2089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that kasApolymorphisms (R121K, G269S, G312S, and G387D) were identified in only 10% of INH-resistant isolates, with the most frequent substitution (G312S) being associated with INH-susceptible strains. In a recent study, Alland and co-workers (26.Piatek A.S. Telenti A. Murray M.R. El Hajj H. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Kramer F.R. Alland D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) did not find mutations inkasA codon 66, 312, or 413 in 165 INH-susceptible and INH-resistant strains. However, 10 strains with mutations in codon 269 were found, 5 among INH-susceptible strains and 5 among INH-resistant strains. Interestingly, these mutations in KasA (Fig. 4 B) do not reside within the catalytic site. Two possible explanations with regard to INH susceptibility/resistance include, first, their influence on the relative degree of acyl-AcpM binding, and second, the stabilization of the dimerization of the KasA protein. As a consequence, these mutations may affect the KasA-INH-AcpM complex, a scenario that remains to be further investigated. We describe two distinct clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis displaying the G269S substitution that are still sensitive to INH, although resistant to TLM. Overall, these results suggest that mutations withinkasA do not confer significant INH resistance. Considering that the serum levels of INH are 35–60 times above the MIC (45.Seth V. Beotra A. Seth S.D. Semwal O.P. Kabra S. Jain Y. Mukhopadhya S. Indian Pediatr. 1993; 30: 1091-1098PubMed Google Scholar), the results suggest that, clinically, point mutations in KasA are not significant in terms of INH resistance. However, because INH has been proven to be one of the most effective anti-tuberculosis agents that targets FAS-II through InhA (9.Banerjee A. Dubnau E. Quémard A. Balasubramanian V. Ulm K.S. Wilson T. Collins D. De Lisle G. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Science. 1994; 263: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar), it would be anticipated that TLM would be of therapeutic value to INH-sensitive and INH-resistant strains through synergistic INH therapy. This is reinforced by the observation that the multidrug-resistant M307 isolate (its resistance is due in part to mutations in KatG) appears to be highly susceptible to TLM, suggesting that TLM may be suitable for the treatment of tuberculosis.During the course of our studies, several elegant structural reports have appeared defining the key catalytic amino acids involved in the elongation and decarboxylation process involved in fatty acid elongation by Kas enzymes (29.Huang W. Jia J. Edwards P. Dehesh K. Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1183-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 39.Siggaard-Andersen M. Protein Sequences Data Anal. 1993; 5: 325-335Google Scholar, 40.Siggaard-Andersen M. Bangera G. Olsen J.G. von Wettstein-Knowles P. Sánchez J. Cerdá Olmedo E. Martı́nez-Force E. Advances in Plant Lipid Research. Secretariado de Publicaciones, Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain1998: 67-70Google Scholar). We have taken advantage of this available structural information to predict a model structure for mycobacterial KasA. It is clear that the key catalytic amino acids described for FabB by Siggaard-Anderson and co-workers (39.Siggaard-Andersen M. Protein Sequences Data Anal. 1993; 5: 325-335Google Scholar, 40.Siggaard-Andersen M. Bangera G. Olsen J.G. von Wettstein-Knowles P. Sánchez J. Cerdá Olmedo E. Martı́nez-Force E. Advances in Plant Lipid Research. Secretariado de Publicaciones, Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain1998: 67-70Google Scholar) are highly conserved and that a deep hydrophobic pocket surrounds the catalytic Cys-163 residue (Fig. 4). It should also be pointed out that the mycobacterial FAS-II and meromycolate system elongate C16 fatty acid primers, initially through Kas enzymes, whereas E. coli FAS-II performs de novo synthesis from acetyl-CoA/ACP and malonyl-ACP (42.Jackowski S. Sutcliffe J. Georgopapadakou N.H. Emerging Targets in Antibacterial and Antifungal Chemotherapy. Routledge, Chapman and Hall, New York1992: 151-162Crossref Google Scholar). As a consequence, we decided to investigate whether a range of TLM inhibitors differing in hydrophobicity, and possibly resembling more the nature of the condensing enzyme substrates, would be more potent than TLM itself. Clearly, there was a strict requirement for a C-4 side chain as the parent thiolactone moiety was inactive both in vivo andin vitro. Analogues 2 and 3 were very similar in relation to the overall structure of TLM and possessed similar in vitro properties to TLM but were very poorin vivo inhibitors. Analogues 3-7 were influenced by the overall chain length and degree of saturation of the C-4 side chain in terms of in vivo activity, with6 and 7 possessing a 4-fold increase in potency. It was interesting to observe that there was a lack of inhibition against mycobacterial FAS-II by analogues 4-8 but excellent inhibitory properties against the mycolic-acid synthase extract. However, it should be pointed out that further studies are required to determine true structure-activity relationships for TLM analogues and FAS-II inhibition. For instance, studies using chloroplasts from peas demonstrated that analogue 4(inactive in the mycobacterial FAS-II system) was a potent inhibitor of FAS-II within the pea FAS-II assay system (46.Jones A.L. Dancer J.E. Harwood J.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 258SCrossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Overall, the results suggest that TLM targets both KasA and KasB, whereas the more hydrophobic derivatives may target KasB and meromycolate synthesis. Studies examining recombinant E. coli expression of soluble Kas proteins (i.e. KasA and KasB) and site-directed mutants and studies of structural and binding/co-crystallization using TLM are currently in progress. In this regard, although it is a weak inhibitor, the benzophenone analogue 8 may provide a useful photoprobe for labeling investigations and covalent modification of the Kas enzymes.TLM remains an interesting but rather unexploited antibiotic sharing little or no cross-resistance with other classes of antibiotics. The TLM family are confirmed as members of a group of mycobacterial mycolic acid inhibitors (INH, ethionamide, and isoxyl) that target various fatty acid biosynthetic genes. The selective enhanced activity of a number of analogues of TLM demonstrates the potential for antibiotic development. A key feature of TLM (and its analogues) is its selectivity for type-II FAS systems, which promotes its effectiveness as a broad spectrum antibiotic. The added value in the context ofM. tuberculosis is the presence of multiple Kas enzymes. It can be envisaged that a suitable TLM derivative would block multiple condensing enzymes, i.e. both KasA and KasB, and thus reduce the frequency of appearance of TLM-resistance in M. tuberculosis. In this regard, several attempts to generate a laboratory-cultured M. bovis BCG strain resistant to TLM has failed (data not shown), supporting this notion. In summary, further characterization of genes involved in the biosynthesis of mycolic acids, such as KasA and KasB, may lead to the development of new therapeutic anti-tubercular agents, especially in the context of more potent TLM mimics. Tuberculosis, in terms of infectious diseases, is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, infecting 8 million and killing 3 million people annually (1.Snider D.E. Raviglione M. Kochi A. Bloom B.R. Tuberculosis: Pathogenesis, Protection and Control. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 3-11Google Scholar). The situation has recently been exacerbated by the human immunodeficiency virus pandemic and the increased prevalence of multidrug-resistant strains ofMycobacterium tuberculosis (2.Smith P.G. Moss A.R. Bloom B.R. Tuberculosis: Pathogenesis, Protection and Control. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 47-59Google Scholar). Vaccine prophylaxis, usingMycobacterium bovis BCG, has proven unsatisfactory in many parts of the world (3.Colditz G.A. Brewer T.F. Berkey C.S. Wilson M.E. Burdick E. Fineberg H.V. Mosteller F. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1994; 271: 698-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar). Recent research has focused on understanding the molecular basis of drug resistance in M. tuberculosis, and a great deal of progress has been made in this regard in relation to several major anti-tuberculous drugs, including rifampicin (4.Telenti A.

Mycolic acids are high molecular weight α-alkyl, β-hydroxy fatty acids with the general structure R-CH(OH)-CH(R′)-COOH, where R is a “meromycolate” chain consisting of 50–56 carbons and R′ is a shorter aliphatic branch possessing 22–26 carbons (11.Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar). Mycolic acids are key components of the mycobacterial cell wall and may play a role as an effective lipophilic barrier to the penetration of some antibiotics (11.Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar). Considering the importance of mycolic acids in bacterial survival, enzymes involved in the metabolism of these specific molecules represent attractive targets for the design of new anti-mycobacterial agents. Although there has been controversy about the mechanism of action of INH, it is clear that disruption of mycolic acid biosynthesis is one of its earliest detectable effects. This is apparently achieved through inhibition of inhA, an enoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase, a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of fatty acids and mycolic acids (9.Banerjee A. Dubnau E. Quémard A. Balasubramanian V. Ulm K.S. Wilson T. Collins D. De Lisle G. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Science. 1994; 263: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). However, mutations within katG, which encodes a catalase-peroxidase enzyme, lead to the majority of INH-resistant isolates (8.Zhang Y. Heym B. Allen B. Young D. Cole S. Nature. 1992; 358: 591-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar), demonstrating that INH is a prodrug and that an activated metabolite is responsible for its mode of action (12.Blanchard J.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 215-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Presumably, inhA is the primary target for the activated form of INH, and indeed, mutations in the inhA gene account for some cases of INH resistance inM. tuberculosis.

Although VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) and VEGFR-2 are known to be high affinity receptors for VEGF, it is not clear which of the VEGFRs are responsible for the transmission of the diverse biological responses of VEGF. For this purpose we have constructed a chimeric receptor for VEGFR-1 (CTR) and VEGFR-2 (CKR) in which the extracellular domain of each receptor was replaced with the extracellular domain of human colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R), and these receptors were expressed in pig aortic endothelial (PAE) cells. We show that CKR individually expressed in PAE cells is readily tyrosine-phosphorylated in vivo, autophosphorylated in vitro, and stimulates cell proliferation in a CSF-1-dependent manner. In contrast, CTR individually expressed in PAE cells showed no significant in vivo, in vitro tyrosine phosphorylation and cell growth in response to CSF-1 stimulation. The kinase activity of CKR was essential for its biological activity, since mutation of lysine 866 to arginine abolished its in vivo, in vitro tyrosine phosphorylation and mitogenic signals. Remarkably, activation of CTR repressed CKR-mediated mitogen-activate protein kinase activation and cell proliferation. Similar effects were observed for VEGFR-2 co-expressed with VEGFR-1. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that VEGFR-2 activation plays a positive role in angiogenesis by promoting endothelial cell proliferation. In contrast, activation of VEGFR-1 plays a stationary role in angiogenesis by antagonizing VEGFR-2 responses."

Thus, it is generally believed that the NPXY sequences function as endocytosis signals for all the LDL receptor family members. The primary aim of this study is to define the endocytosis signal(s) within the cytoplasmic tail of LDL receptor-related protein (LRP). By using LRP minireceptors, which mimic the function and trafficking of full-length endogenous LRP, we demonstrate that the YXXL motif, but not the two NPXY motifs, serves as the dominant signal for LRP endocytosis. We also found that the distal di-leucine motif within the LRP tail contributes to its endocytosis, and its function is independent of the YXXL motif. Although the proximal NPXY motif and the proximal di-leucine motif each play a limited role in LRP endocytosis in the context of the full-length tail, these motifs were functional within the truncated receptor tail.

In addition, we show that LRP minireceptor mutants defective in endocytosis signal(s) accumulate at the cell surface and are less efficient in delivery of ligand for degradation. low density lipoprotein Chinese hamster ovary low density lipoprotein receptor low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein receptor-associated protein apolipoprotein E apolipoprotein E receptor-2 very low density lipoprotein receptor single chain urokinase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis hemagglutinin bovine serum albumin endoplasmic reticulum The low density lipoprotein (LDL)1 receptor-related protein (LRP) is a member of the LDL receptor (LDLR) gene family, which consists of at least six known cell surface receptors: LDLR itself, LRP, the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), megalin/LRP-2, apolipoprotein E receptor-2 (apoER2)/LR8B, and LR11 (1.Krieger M.

LRP is synthesized as a 600-kDa single-chain precursor, which undergoes post-translational proteolytic processing within thetrans-Golgi compartment by the endopeptidase furin (5.Herz J. Kowal R.C.

This post-translational processing results in the formation of mature LRP as a noncovalently associated heterodimer, consisting of the extracellular 515-kDa chain and the transmembrane 85-kDa chain (5.Herz J. Kowal R.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1769-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The 515-kDa subunit contains all of the putative ligand-binding domains consisting of 31 copies of the complement-type ligand-binding repeats arranged in four clusters of 2, 8, 10, and 11 (1.Krieger M.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The 85-kDa subunit contains a single transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail. LRP is widely expressed in adult tissues, most abundantly in the liver and the brain (1.Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 7.Herz J.

To date, more than 10 structurally and functionally distinct ligands have been identified, including α2-macroglobulin, apoE/lipoproteins, lipoprotein lipase, tissue-type plasminogen activator, and urokinase (1.Krieger M.

Ligand interactions with LRP can be antagonized by a 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP). The recombinant form of RAP has been used extensively in the study of ligand-receptor interactions. Under physiological conditions, however, RAP functions intracellularly as a molecular chaperone for LRP and facilitates LRP folding and trafficking within the secretory pathway (9.Bu G. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence has shown that LRP plays important roles in lipoprotein remnant catabolism (10.Willnow T.E. Sheng Z.

Cell surface receptors that traffic between the plasma membrane and endocytic compartments contain signals within their cytoplasmic tails that allow their efficient recruitment into endocytic vesicles. To date, four classes of endocytosis signals have been identified that target surface proteins to clathrin-coated vesicles. Tyrosine-based signals within NPXY or YXXØ sequence (whereX can be any amino acid and Ø is an amino acid with a bulky hydrophobic group) were initially identified in LDLR and transferrin receptor, respectively (17.Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). In many cases these signals are constitutively active, i.e. receptors undergo continuous rounds of endocytosis and recycling independent of ligand binding. The di-leucine motif is another well known endocytosis motif that is present within many transmembrane cell surface proteins (18.Hirst J. Robinson M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 173-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The third type of endocytosis signal is serine phosphorylation. For several members of the family of G protein-coupled receptors, ligand-induced phosphorylation of serine residues serves as a signal for receptor endocytosis (19.Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). In CD4 and CD3γ, the di-leucine motif acts in cooperation with a neighboring phosphorylated serine residue to mediate endocytosis (20.Dietrich J. Hou X. Wegener A.M. Geisler C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2156-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 21.Pitcher C. Honing S. Fingerhut A. Bowers K. Marsh M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Finally, the attachment of ubiquitin moieties has been recently identified as another regulator of the endocytosis of several membrane receptors (22.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6728) Google Scholar, 23.Strous G.J. Govers R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1417-1423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A common characteristic of the LDLR family members is that they all contain at least one copy of the NPXY sequence within their cytoplasmic tails. For LDLR, it has been demonstrated that the NPXY motif serves as a signal for rapid endocytosis through coated pits (24.Chen W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is generally believed that the NPXY sequences in these receptors categorically serve as endocytosis signals. More recently, Herz and colleagues (25.Trommsdorff M. Borg J.P. Margolis B. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33556-33560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 26.Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T. Shelton J. Stockinger W. Nimpf J. Hammer R.E.

Herz J. Neuron. 1999; 24: 481-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that two cytoplasmic adaptor proteins, mammalian Disabled-1 and FE65, interact with NPXY motifs in the cytoplasmic tails of LRP, LDLR, VLDLR, and ApoER2, and that VLDLR and ApoER2 function as obligate components in the Reelin/Disabled-mediated neuronal migration pathway. These data suggest that the NPXY motifs within the tails of the LDLR family members may function not only as endocytosis signals but also as binding motifs for cellular components, which are involved in signal transduction. The tail of LRP consists of 100 amino acid residues, and contains multiple potential endocytosis motifs including two NPXY motifs, one YXXØ motif, and two di-leucine motifs. In this study, the five potential endocytosis signals are termed, in their relationships to the transmembrane domain, as proximal NPXY, proximal di-leucine, distal NPXY, YXXL, and distal di-leucine (see Fig. 1). The primary aim of this study is to define endocytosis signal(s) within the LRP tail. Here, we demonstrate that the YXXL motif, but not the two NPXY motifs, serves as the dominant signal for LRP endocytosis. We also show that the distal di-leucine motif contributes to LRP endocytosis, and its function is independent of the YXXL motif. These data suggest that each member of the LDLR family may utilize different potential signal(s) within their cytoplasmic tails for receptor-mediated endocytosis. Human recombinant RAP was expressed in a glutathione S-transferase expression vector and isolated as described previously (28.Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13002-13009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). scuPA was kindly provided by G. F. Vovis of Collaborative Research (29.Morton P.A. Owensby D.A. Wun T.C. Billadello J.J.

Non-enzymatic cell dissociation solution was from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-HA antibody has been described before (30.Obermoeller L.M. Chen Z. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Biol.

Quantum Simply Cellular microbead standard was from Flow Cytometry Standards Corp., San Juan, Puerto Rico. Peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse antibody and ECL system were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Immobilon-P transfer membrane was from Millipore. Rainbow molecular weight markers were from Bio-Rad. Carrier-free Na125I was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. The LRP-null Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line (kindly provided by David FitzGerald, National Institutes of Health; see Ref. 31.FitzGerald D.J. Fryling C.M. Zdanovsky A. Saelinger C.B. Kounnas M. Winkles J.A. Strickland D. Leppla S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1533-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) was cultured in Ham's F-12 medium as described (31.FitzGerald D.J. Fryling C.M. Zdanovsky A. Saelinger C.B. Kounnas M. Winkles J.A. Strickland D. Leppla S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1533-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Stable transfection into LRP-null CHO cells was achieved by transfection of 30 μg of plasmid DNA in 10-cm dishes by using a calcium phosphate precipitation method (32.Obermoeller L, M. Warshawsky I. Wardell M.R. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10761-10768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants were selected using 700 μg/ml G418 and maintained with 350 μg/ml G418. The construction of the membrane-containing minireceptor of LRP (see Fig. 1, A and C) via polymerase chain reaction was performed essentially as described previously (30.Obermoeller L.M. Chen Z.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22218-22224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All oligonucleotides were synthesized at the Washington University School of Medicine Protein Chemistry Laboratory. Stably transfected CHO cells were lysed with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C for 30 min. Equal quantities of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE (6%) under reducing conditions. Following transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, successive incubations with anti-HA antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG were carried out for 60 min at room temperature. The immunoreactive proteins were then detected using the ECL system. Films showing immunoreactive bands were scanned using a Kodak Digital Science DC120 Zoom digital camera and analyzed with Kodak Digital Science1D image analysis software. For cell surface LRP minireceptor analysis, living cells were used (34.Li Y. Wood N. Yellowlees D. Donnelly P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, CHO cells were detached by incubation with non-enzymatic cell dissociation solution. Successive incubations with affinity-purified anti-HA IgG (25 μg/ml) and goat anti-mouse IgFITC were carried out at 4 °C for 45 min. Background fluorescence intensity was assessed in the absence of primary monoclonal antibody. The antibody binding capacities were evaluated from the standardized Quantum Simply Cellular bead calibration plot (35.Zagursky R.J. Sharp D. Solomon K.A. Schwartz A. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 504-509PubMed Google Scholar). The bead standards consist of four populations of microbeads coated with goat anti-mouse antibody, which bind different numbers of mouse IgG monoclonal antibody molecules (5686, 18,329, 50,908, and 150,477 molecule binding capacities) in addition to a blank population. The beads were stained in the same way as the CHO cells. RAP and scuPA (50 μg) were iodinated by using the IODO-GEN method as described previously (36.Bu G. Morton P.A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15595-15602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis of endocytosis was performed according to previously published methods (37.Vilhardt F. Nielsen M. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 179-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 38.York S.J. Arneson L.S. Gregory W.T. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1164-1171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Stably transfected CHO cells were plated in 12-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well and used after overnight culture. Cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold ligand binding buffer (minimal Eagle's medium containing 0.6% BSA), and125I-RAP was added at 5 nm final concentration in cold ligand binding buffer (0.5 ml/well). The binding of125I-RAP was carried out at 4 °C for 30 min with gentle rocking. Binding of 125I-RAP was specific, i.e.the addition of 100-fold excess unlabeled RAP inhibited binding by 90–95%. Unbound ligand was removed by washing cell monolayers three times with cold binding buffer. Ice-cold stop/strip solution (0.2m acetic acid, pH 2.6, 0.1 m NaCl) was added to one set of plates without warming up and kept on ice. The remaining plates were then placed in a 37 °C water bath, and 0.5 ml of ligand binding buffer prewarmed to 37 °C was quickly added to the well monolayers to initiate internalization. After each time point, the plates were quickly placed on ice and the ligand binding buffer was replaced with cold stop/strip solution. Ligand that remained on the cell surface was stripped by incubation of cell monolayers with cold stop/strip solution for a total of 20 min (0.75 ml for 10 min, twice) and counted. Cell monolayers were then solubilized with low SDS lysis buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.2% SDS, 10% v/v glycerol) and counted. The sum of ligand that was internalized, plus that which remained on the cell surface after each assay was used as the maximum potential internalization. The fraction of internalized ligand after each time point was calculated and plotted. Cells (2 × 105) were seeded into 12-well dishes 1 day prior to assays. Assay buffer (minimal Eagle's medium containing 0.6% BSA with 5 nm radioligand, 0.6 ml/well) was added to cell monolayers, in the absence or the presence of unlabeled 500 nm RAP, followed with incubation for 1 h at 4 °C. Thereafter, overlying buffer containing unbound ligand was removed, and cell monolayers were washed and lysed in low SDS lysis buffer and counted. Ligand degradation efficiency was measured using the methods as described (24.Chen W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Lai A. Sisodia S.S. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3565-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 105 cells were seeded into 12-well dishes 1 day prior to assays. Pre-warmed assay buffer was added to cell monolayers, in the absence or the presence of unlabeled 500 nm RAP, followed with incubation for 4 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, the medium overlying the cell monolayers was removed and proteins were precipitated by addition of BSA to 10 mg/ml and trichloroacetic acid to 20%. Degradation of radioligand was defined as the appearance of radioactive fragments in the overlying medium that were soluble in 20% trichloroacetic acid. The protein concentrations of each cell lysates were measured in parallel dishes that did not contain LRP ligands. The ligand degradation efficiency is the value of degraded ligand (cpm/mg cell protein) divided by the number of cell surface LRP minireceptors (as determined by flow cytometry, and calculated relative to wild type mLRP4T100). Stably transfected CHO cells expressing various proteins were grown on glass coverslips, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated for 30 min with anti-HA antibody followed by a 30-min labeling with Cy3 goat anti-mouse IgG. Confocal microscopy was performed on a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 model using a Zeiss 63× (nominal aperture, 1.4) oil immersion lens. The very large size of LRP (∼600 kDa) limits molecular manipulations at the cDNA level and the expression of this protein via transfection. Thus, we generated an LRP minireceptor that mimics the function and trafficking of LRP (Fig.1 A). This LRP minireceptor encodes residues 2462–4525 of the full-length LRP (7.Herz J. Hamann U. Rogne S. Myklebost O. Gausepohl H. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4119-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar), which includes the fourth cluster of ligand-binding repeats through the carboxyl terminus of the receptor (designated mLRP4T100, with “m” representing membrane-containing, “4” representing the fourth cluster of ligand-binding repeats, “T” representing cytoplasmic tail, and “100” representing the 100 amino acid residues within the LRP tail). To facilitate immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis, an HA epitope was included near the amino terminus of mLRP4T100. Our studies have demonstrated that this LRP minireceptor mimics the function and trafficking of full-length endogenous LRP (30.Obermoeller L.M. Chen Z. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22374-22381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 B shows the sequence of the cytoplasmic tail of LRP with the first amino acid following the transmembrane domain numbered as 1. Using LRP-null CHO cells (31.FitzGerald D.J. Fryling C.M. Zdanovsky A. Saelinger C.B. Kounnas M. Winkles J.A. Strickland D. Leppla S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1533-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we generated stably transfected cell lines expressing LRP minireceptors with different potential endocytosis signals after truncation (Fig. 1 C), and measured the endocytosis rate of these truncated LRP minireceptors. Our previous studies have shown that the fourth ligand-binding domain of LRP binds RAP with high affinity (30.Obermoeller L.M. Chen Z. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22374-22381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 32.Obermoeller L, M. Warshawsky I. Wardell M.R. Bu G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22218-22224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 D shows the effects of tail truncation on LRP minireceptor-mediated endocytosis. As shown in the figure, the stable cell line bearing mLRP4T100 rapidly internalized 125I-RAP, with a half-time of less than 30 s. In contrast, 125I-RAP was poorly internalized by cells expressing either mLRP4Ttailess or mLRP4T25, while the endocytosis rates of mLRP4T59 and mLRP4T72 were variably greater than those of mLRP4Ttailess and mLRP4T25. These results suggest each of the potential endocytosis motifs (NPXY, YXXØ, and di-leucine) within the LRP tail may contribute to LRP endocytosis. Based on the above results, we generated eight LRP minireceptors with specific mutations in the cytoplasmic tail based on mLRP4T100 (Fig.2 A). These mutations were targeted to each of the putative endocytosis signals, which allowed us to evaluate the contribution of these signals in LRP endocytosis. Fig.2 B shows the endocytosis rates of wild type mLRP4T100 and its proximal NPXY motif mutants. Alteration of the asparagine or the tyrosine to alanine resulted in only a slight decrease in RAP internalization, with the initial endocytosis rates being indistinguishable from that of mLRP4T100. These results indicate that the proximal NPXY motif is not important for LRP endocytosis. Fig. 2 C shows the endocytosis rates of wild type mLRP4T100 and its distal NPXY motif mutants. As the phenylalanine is the important residue within the FXNPXY motif for LDLR endocytosis (24.Chen W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we also mutated this residue to alanine. Replacement of the phenylalanine or the asparagine by alanine resulted in only a slight decrease in RAP internalization, with the initial endocytosis rates being indistinguishable from that of mLRP4T100. In contrast, alteration of the tyrosine to alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in RAP internalization. At 15, 30, and 60 s, this mutant internalized 3%, 5%, and 12%, respectively, of the total cell-associated125I-RAP, corresponding to a 80–90% impairment in endocytosis relative to wild type mLRP4T100. These results indicate that the tyrosine residue at position 63 is critical for LRP endocytosis. Because the tyrosine within the distal NPXY motif is also within the YXXL motif, the decreased endocytosis rate of mLRP4T100(Y63A) may have resulted from the mutation of the YXXL motif. Fig. 2 D shows the endocytosis rates of wild type mLRP4T100 and its YXXL motif mutants. As shown in the figure, the endocytosis rate of mLRP4T100(L66A) was significantly decreased, and was indistinguishable from that of mLRP4T100(Y63A). Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that the YXXL motif, but not the distal NPXY motif, serves as the major endocytosis signal for LRP. The di-leucine motif is another well characterized endocytosis signal that is present in many transmembrane cell surface proteins. Thus, we next compared the endocytosis rate of mLRP4T100 with that of its di-leucine motif mutants (Fig. 2 E). Mutation of both leucines to alanines in the proximal di-leucine motif resulted in little or no change in RAP internalization. However, the mLRP4T100(L86A,L87A) mutant clearly demonstrates a defect in internalization, although not as substantial as mLRP4T100(Y63A) or mLRP4T100(L66A) (Fig. 2, D and E). At 15, 30, and 60 s, mLRP4T100(L86A,L87A) internalized 18%, 30%, and 40%, respectively, of the total cell-associated125I-RAP, corresponding to a 30–40% impairment in endocytosis relative to wild type mLRP4T100. These results clearly demonstrate that the distal di-leucine motif, but not the proximal di-leucine motif, contributes to LRP endocytosis. To address whether the YXXL motif and the distal di-leucine motif function independently in LRP endocytosis, we generated a double mutant, mLRP4T100(Y63A,L86A,L87A). The endocytosis rate of this mutant receptor was compared with that for wild type mLRP4T100 as well as mLRP4T100(Y63A), mLRP4T100(L86A,L87A), and mLRP4Ttailess, in stably transfected LRP-null CHO cells. As shown in Fig.3, the endocytosis rate of mLRP4T100(Y63A,L86A,L87A) was significantly lower than that of mLRP4T100(Y63A). These results thus clearly demonstrate that the YXXL motif and the distal di-leucine motif function independently in LRP endocytosis. In Fig. 2 (B andE), we demonstrated that the proximal NPXY motif and the proximal di-leucine motif exhibit little or no role in LRP endocytosis within the full-length LRP tail. However, comparison of the endocytosis rate of mLRP4T100 with that of mLRP4T59 indicated that mLRP4T59 is still capable of internalizing RAP (Fig. 1 D). To address this question, we generated two mLRP4T100 mutants mLRP4T59(Y29A) and mLRP4T59(L43A,L44A) using mLRP4T59 as the template. Fig. 4 shows the endocytosis rates of the stably transfected CHO cells expressing mLRP4T100, mLRP4T59, mLRP4T59(Y29A), mLRP4T59(L43A,L44A), and mLRP4Ttailess. As shown in the figure, the endocytosis rates of mLRP4T59(Y29A) and mLRP4T59(L43A,L44A) were significantly lower than that of mLRP4T59, indicating that the proximal NPXY motif and the proximal di-leucine motif are functional within the truncated receptor tail. We hypothesized that mLRP4T100 mutants that are defective in endocytosis signals would accumulate at the cell surface. We initially compared the ligand binding activity of wild type mLRP4T100 with those of endocytosis mutants expressed in stably transfected CHO cells. As shown in Fig. 5 A, CHO cells expressing wild type mLRP4T100 exhibited a moderate level of cell surface RAP binding, while CHO cells transfected with the pcDNA3 vector exhibited only ∼10% of RAP binding compared with those transfected with mLRP4T100. The residual RAP binding to pcDNA3-transfected cells is likely mediated by cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (40.Vassiliou G. Stanley K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15172-15178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, CHO cells expressing mLRP4T100 mutants defective in endocytosis signals exhibited significant increase in cell surface RAP binding activity. To analyze whether the increase of RAP binding to CHO cells expressing endocytosis mutants is due to an a"
https://openalex.org/W2138024602,"Cell cycle growth arrest is an important cellular response to genotoxic stress. Gadd45, a p53-regulated stress protein, plays an important role in the cell cycle G(2)-M checkpoint following exposure to certain types of DNA-damaging agents such as UV radiation and methylmethane sulfonate. Recent findings indicate that Gadd45 interacts with Cdc2 protein and inhibits Cdc2 kinase activity. In the present study, a series of Myc-tagged Gadd45 deletion mutants and a Gadd45 overlapping peptide library were used to define the Gadd45 domains that are involved in the interaction of Gadd45 with Cdc2. Both in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that the interaction of Gadd45 with Cdc2 involves a central region of the Gadd45 protein (amino acids 65-84). The Cdc2-binding domain of Gadd45 is also required for Gadd45 inhibition of Cdc2 kinase activity. Sequence analysis of the central Gadd45 region reveals no homology to inhibitory motifs of known cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, indicating that the Cdc2-binding and -inhibitory domains on Gadd45 are a novel motif. The peptide containing the Cdc2-binding domain (amino acids 65-84) disrupted the Cdc2-cyclin B1 protein complex, suggesting that dissociation of this complex results from a direct interaction between the Gadd45 and Cdc2 proteins. GADD45-induced cell cycle G(2)-M arrest was abolished when its Cdc2 binding motif was disrupted. Importantly, a short term survival assay demonstrated that GADD45-induced cell cycle G(2)-M arrest correlates with GADD45-mediated growth suppression. These findings indicate that the cell cycle G(2)-M growth arrest mediated by GADD45 is one of the major mechanisms by which GADD45 suppresses cell growth."

In the present study, we first demonstrate that mouse PRL-1, -2, and -3 are indeed prenylated. Examination of N-terminal epitope-tagged PRL-1, -2, and -3 expressed in transiently transfected cells suggests that PRL-1, -2, and -3 are present on the plasma membrane and intracellular punctate structures. Stable Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing PRL-1 and -3 in an inducible manner were established. When cells were treated with brefeldin A, PRL-1 and -3 accumulated in a collapsed compact structure around the microtubule-organizing center. Furthermore, PRL-1 and -3 redistributed into swollen vacuole-like structures when cells were treated with wortmannin. These characteristics of PRL-1 and -3 are typical for endosomal proteins. Electron microscope immunogold labeling reveals that PRL-1 and -3 are indeed associated with the plasma membrane and the early endosomal compartment.

Furthermore, a mutant form of PRL-2 lacking the C-terminal prenylation signal is associated with the nucleus. These results establish that the primary association of PRL-1, -2, and -3 with the membrane of the cell surface and the early endosome is dependent on their prenylation and that nuclear localization of these proteins may be triggered by a regulatory event that inhibits their prenylation.

The protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)1 superfamily encompasses a large group of enzymes that undoubtedly play key roles in the regulation of the above events. The PTPs are classified into subgroups depending on their form and substrate specificity, with the receptor-like transmembrane and some intracellular PTPs being specific for phosphophotyrosine, whereas other intracellular PTPs are of dual specificity and dephosphorylate phosphoserine/threonine as well as phosphotyrosine residues (1.Streuli M.

The PRL phosphatases (PRL-1, -2, and -3) are three closely related intracellular enzymes that possess the PTP active site signature sequence CX 5R (4.Diamond R.H. Cressman D.E. Laz T.M. Abrams C.S.

All are proteins of about 20 kDa with at least 75% amino acid sequence similarity. They resemble the dual specificity phosphatases of the PTP superfamily in having few of the conserved catalytic domain residues typical of the tyrosine-specific PTPs, although PRL-1 has so far only been demonstrated to dephosphorylate phosphotyrosyl substrates in vitro (4.Diamond R.H. Cressman D.E. Laz T.M. Abrams C.S. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3752-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Furthermore, outside of themselves, their highest homology is to Cdc14p, a dual specificity phosphatase that regulates mitotic exit (9.Taylor G.S. Liu Y. Baskerville C. Charbonneau H. J. Biol.

PRL-1 is the founding member of these PRL phosphatases. The PRL-1 gene was originally identified as an immediate early gene whose expression is induced in mitogen-stimulated cells and regenerating liver (16.Mohn K.L. Laz T.M. Hsu J.-C. Melby A.E. Bravo R. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PRL-1 can lead to cell transformation, suggesting that it may participate in key events that regulate cell growth (4.Diamond R.H. Cressman D.E. Laz T.M. Abrams C.S. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3752-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 6.Cates C.A. Michael R.L. Stayrook K.R. Harvey K.A. Burke Y.D. Randall S.K. Crowell P.L. Crowell D.N. Cancer Lett. 1996; 110: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), although the underlying mechanism is currently unknown. A most interesting feature of PRL-1, -2, and -3 is the presence of a consensus C-terminal CAAX sequence for prenylation (17.Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Nature. 1993; 366: 14-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 18.Moores S.L. Schaber M.D. Mosser S.D. Rands D. O'Hara M.B. Garsky V.M. Marshall M.S. Pompliano D.L. Gibbs J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14603-14610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where C is cysteine, A is an aliphatic amino acid, and X is any amino acid. Three types of prenyltransferase carry out the addition of either farnesyl (C15) or geranylgeranyl (C20) isoprenoids to cellular proteins. Farnesyltransferase (FT) and geranylgeranyl transferase I (GGT I) are heterodimeric α/β enzymes that share a common α subunit and mediate prenylation of the CAAX sequence (19.Reiss Y. Goldstein J.L. Seabra M.C. Casey P.J. Brown M.S. Cell. 1990; 62: 81-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 20.Seabra M.C. Reiss Y. Casey P.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1991; 65: 429-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), with FT preferring Met, Ser, or Gln in the X position and GGT I preferring Leu in the X position (21.Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). Geranylgeranyltransferase II (GGT II) is a distinct α/β dimer that prenylates XXCC, XCXC, or CCXX C-terminal sequences when the substrate protein is bound to a carrier protein called REP (Rabescort protein) (22.Seabra M.C. Goldstein J.L. Sudhof T.C. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14497-14503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Andres D.A. Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Armstrong S.A. Smeland T.E. Cremers F.P. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1993; 73: 1091-1099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The only known substrates of GGT II are the Rab proteins. Protein prenylation is important in targeting proteins to intracellular membranes and in protein-protein interactions (21.Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar, 24.Marshall C.J. Science. 1993; 259: 1865-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 25.Seabra M.C. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This is often critical for protein function, as observed with the dependence of mutant Ras transforming activity on its farnesylation (26.Jackson J.H. Cochrane C.G. Bourne J.R. Solski P.A. Buss J.E.

Because of the presence of oncogenic forms of Ras in about 30% of human cancers, FT inhibitors have been investigated as anti-tumor agents and have been shown, for example, to inhibit the anchorage-independent growth and revert the phenotype of Ras transformed cells and to effect tumor regression in Ras oncomice (28.James G.L.

Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 792-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, various studies have suggested that FT inhibitors exert these effects on targets other than Ras, with RhoB and other proteins representing possible alternate targets (32.Gibbs J.B.

It is thus important to identify such other farnesylated proteins involved in cell growth and transformation and determine their specific cellular actions in relation to their prenylation status. Previous studies suggest that PRL-1 is localized to the interior of the nucleus (4.Diamond R.H. Cressman D.E. Laz T.M. Abrams C.S. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3752-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Because prenylated proteins are normally associated with cellular membranes and PRL-1 contains the consensus motif for prenylation, we have re-examined the subcellular localization of PRL-1 using an different approach. In addition, because PRL-1, -2, and -3 share high degrees of amino acid sequence homology, antibodies against one may potentially cross-react with others. The subcellular localization of each PRL was thus investigated independently. Our results suggest that PRL-1, -2, and -3 are farnesylated and normally associated with the membrane of the cell surface and the early endosome. We show that this membrane association depends on their prenylation and that unlipidated PRL-1, -2, and -3 are shifted into the nucleus.

To construct plasmids expressing wild-type PRLs, the coding regions of PRL-1, -2, and -3 were retrieved by PCR using Pfu polymerase and appropriate forward primers incorporating a BamHI or aSalI restriction site and reverse primers incorporating anEcoRI restriction site. To construct a plasmid expressing a mutant form of PRL-2 lacking the C-terminal four amino acids (amino acids 164–167) of the CAAX box (PRL-2-cd), the PRL-2 cDNA was amplified using the same forward primer as above (with an added SalI site) in conjuction with a reverse primer corresponding to the sequence encoding amino acids 159–163 and with an added EcoRI site. Mutant PRL-2 (C101S), where the essential cysteine residue of the active site of the phosphatase was replaced by serine, was obtained through a first PCR reaction using a forward primer corresponding to the desired nucleotide substitution (5′-TGTGTTGCAGTGCATAGTGTTGCAGGATTGGGA-3′), and the reverse primer was used to amplify wild-type PRL-2. The completed first PCR reaction was then used as a template in a second PCR reaction employing the forward (with an added BamHI site) and reverse (with an addedEcoRI site) primers used to amplify wild-type PRL-2 (above). All PCR fragments were inserted into theBamHI-EcoRI-digested pGEX-KG vector (34.Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

The plasmids were transformed into the Escherichia coli strain DH5αF′ and GST-PRL fusion proteins produced upon isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. Soluble purified PRL proteins were obtained by protease 3C cleavage (35.Walker P.A. Leong L.E.-C. Ng P.W.P. Tan S.H. Waller S. Murphy D. Porter A.G.

Rabbits were each injected with 500 μg of GST-PRL-3 emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant. Booster injections containing a similar amount of antigen emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant were administered every 2 weeks. Rabbits were bled 10 days after the third and subsequent booster injections. For affinity purification, serum was diluted twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated first with cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose beads coupled with GST to absorb antibodies against GST. Antibodies against PRL-3 were then affinity purified by incubating with beads conjugated to GST-PRL-3. After extensive washing, specific antibodies were eluted, neutralized, concentrated, and stored at −20 °C in 10% glycerol. HeLa cell lysate was used as a prenyltransferase source and was prepared by scraping cells into 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2 and then passing the cells through a 26-gauge needle 6–8 times. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used in the following reactions. A typical prenylation reaction mixture of 40 μl contained 2 μCi of [3H]FPP or [3H]geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, 1 μg of purified recombinant PRL protein, and 40 μg of HeLa cell lysate. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 4 h and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was dried and exposed to film at −80 °C for 1 week. To construct the pStar-mycPRL vectors, three pairs of oligonucleotides were used in PCR reactions with the respective PRL cDNA as the template to introduce the Myc epitope at the N terminus of PRL-1, -2, and -3. For PRL-1, oligos A (5′-GCGAATTCACCATGGAGCAGAAGCTGATCTCCGAGGAGGACCTCGCTCGAATGAACCGCCCTGCTC-3′) and B (5′-GTGGATCCTTATTGAATACAACAGTTG-3′) were used. Oligos C (5′-GCGAATTCACCATGGAGCAGAAGCTGATCTCCGAGGAGGACCTCGCTAACCGTCCAGCCCCTGTGGAG-3′) and D (5′-CGGGATCCCTACTGAACACAGCAGTGC-3′) were used for PRL-2. For PRL-3, oligo E (5′-GCGAATTCACCATGGAGCAGAAGCTGATCTCCGAGGAGGACCTCGCCCGCATGAACCGGCCTGCGCCTG-3′) and F (5′-CTGGATCCCTACATGACGCAGCATCTGGTC-3′) were used. The PCR fragments were cut with EcoRI and BamHI and inserted into the inducible expression vector pStar (36.Zeng Q. Tan Y.H. Hong W. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 259: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Recombinant pStar with proper inserts were transiently or stably transfected into CHO cells as described (36.Zeng Q. Tan Y.H. Hong W. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 259: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants were screened for tetracycline-induced expression after being cultured overnight in the presence of 4 μg/ml deoxycycline-HCl, and stable CHO cell lines expressing myc-PRL-1 (clone 9) and myc-PRL-3 (clone 36) were expanded. To construct the pXJ41-mycPRL-neo vectors, the wild-type PRL-1, -2, and -3 and the mutant PRL-2 (C101S) coding sequences were excised from the pGEX-KG-PRL plasmids with BamHI and XhoI and inserted into the pXJ41-myc-neo vector 3′ to and in a continuous reading frame with the Myc tag in the vector. The DNA encoding mutant PRL-2 lacking the C-terminal sequence encoding the CAAX box (PRL-2-cd) was amplified by PCR, as described above for construction of the bacterial expression plasmid but using a forward primer with an added BamHI site and a reverse primer incorporating an addedXhoI site and directly inserted into the pXJ41-myc-neo vector as described for the wild-type PRL sequences. These PRL expression plasmids were used to transfect NIH 3T3 cells. The stable transfectants were selected by neomycin resistance and confirmed to express the desired Myc-tagged PRL protein by immunoblotting cell lysates with anti-Myc antibody. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (37.Lowe S.L. Wong S.H. Hong W. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 209-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Zhang T. Wong S.H. Tang B.L.

For treatment with brefeldin A or wortmannin, cells were incubated with brefeldin A (10 μg/ml) or wortmannin (500 nm) for 1 h at 37 °C, washed twice in PBSCM (phosphate-buffered saline with 1 mmMgCl2 and 1 mm CaCl2) and then fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBSCM. For tetracycline-induced expression, CHO cells were grown in the presence of 4 μg/ml of deoxycycline-HCl for 24 h. For farnesyltransferase inhibition, stable lines of NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in the presence of 10 μg/ml FTI-277 for 16 h prior to fixing. Fixed cells were then permeabilized and processed for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with the respective antibodies. Expression of Myc-tagged PRL-1 and PRL-3 in stable CHO cells was induced by overnight culture in the presence of 8 μg/ml of tetracycline. Cells were fixed in a mixture of 2% formaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mphosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Cryosections were processed for immunogold labeling according to the protein A-gold method as described (39.Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Gigengack S. Lienhard G.E. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 40.Liou W. Geuze H.J. Geelen M.J. Slot J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). To mark the early endosomes, cells were incubated with BSA stabilized colloidal gold before fixation (39.Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Gigengack S. Lienhard G.E. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 40.Liou W. Geuze H.J. Geelen M.J. Slot J.W. J.

Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 95-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). This was performed using a Vectastain ABC kit from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA) according to the procedure provided by the supplier. Purified recombinant PRL proteins were incubated with HeLa cell lysates and labeled farnesyl or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphates. When farnesyl pyrophosphate was used as the isoprenoid donor, all the PRLs were farnesylated (Fig. 1). When geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate was used as the isoprenoid donor, PRL-1 and -2 were geranylgeranylated, but PRL-3 was not (Fig. 1). To ensure that the lack of detected geranylgeranylation of PRL-3 was not merely due to its relatively lesser amount in the reaction (Fig.1 A, bottom panel), new preparations of PRL-1 and -3 were prenylated using freshly prepared cell extract in side-by-side reactions. As shown in Fig. 1 B, equal amounts of PRL-1 and PRL-3 were equally well farnesylated. However, in contrast to PRL-1, PRL-3 was still not modified by geranylgeranylation (Fig.1 B, top panel), thus confirming that even when efficiently farnesylated, PRL-3 is not an in vitro substrate of a GGT. The mutant PRL-2 protein lacking the CAAX sequence (PRL-2-cd) was never observed to be prenylated with either isoprenoid donor (data not shown). Thus the PRLs are prenylated in vitro, and PRL-3 exhibits a marked difference in its ability to be modified by C15 and C20 prenyltransferases Because PRL-1, -2, and -3 are highly homologous proteins and antibodies against them may potentially cross-react with each other, we took an alternative approach to examine their subcellular localization by expressing N-terminally Myc epitope-tagged versions of these proteins in transiently transfected CHO cells. Constructs for Myc-tagged versions of these proteins were cloned into the pStar plasmid, a tetracycline-inducible expression vector for mammalian cells (36.Zeng Q. Tan Y.H. Hong W. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 259: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the Myc-tagged PRL-1, -2, and -3 exhibited labeling characteristic of the plasma membrane (see the labeling on the cell edges marked byarrows) as well as intracellular punctate structures scattered throughout the entire cytoplasm but concentrated in the perinuclear region. These punctate structures resemble those of the secretory and/or endocytotic pathway. To more precisely define the subcellular localization of PRL-1 and -3, we established stably transfected CHO cells that express these proteins in an inducible manner. CHO cells were transfected with the pStar vector expressing epitope-tagged PRL-1 and -3, and stable cell lines expressing myc-PRL-1 and -3 in a tetracycline-inducible manner were established (Fig. 3). As revealed by immunoblot analysis, expression of myc-PRL-1 was undetectable for clone 9 in the absence of tetracycline and was induced by tetracycline treatment (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1 and 2). Similar levels of the Cdk inhibitor p27 were detected in clone 9 cells regardless of the presence of tetracycline in the culture medium (Fig.3 B). The expression of myc-PRL-3 in clone 36 cells was leaky because a significant amount of myc-PRL-3 was detected in the absence of tetracycline (Fig. 3 C, lane 1). However, the expression of myc-PRL-3 was greatly enhanced by tetracycline (Fig.3 C, lane 2). When Clone 9 was examined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, myc-PRL-1 was detected on the plasma membrane and associated with microspike-like plasma membrane processes (Fig. 4 A, focusing on the surface labeling). When focused on intracellular labeling (Fig.4 B), distinct punctate structures were detected. Brefeldin A treatment resulted in the redistribution of intracellular PRL-1 into a compact structure near the microtubule-organizing center (Fig.4 C), characteristic of proteins associated with the early endosome and the trans-Golgi network (42.Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar, 43.Wong S.H. Zhang T. Xu Y. Subramaniam V.N. Griffiths G. Hong W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1549-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Because the PRL-1 labeling does not resemble that of markers of the trans-Golgi network, this result suggests that the intracellular structures positive for myc-PRL-1 may be early endosomes. Consistent with this interpretation, myc-PRL-1 shifted to vacuole-like structures when cells were treated with wortmannin (Fig. 4 D). Wortmannin is a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor and known to cause redistribution of endosomal proteins to swollen vacuole-like structures (43.Wong S.H. Zhang T. Xu Y. Subramaniam V.N. Griffiths G. Hong W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1549-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 44.Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 45.Reaves B.J. Bright N.A. Mullock B.M. Luzio J.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 749-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, when clone 36 was examined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, labeling of myc-PRL-3 at both the plasma membrane (Fig.5 A, focal plane at cell surface) and intracellular punctate structures (Fig. 5 B, focal plane at cell interior) was observed. Myc-PRL-3 is also detected on microspike-like plasma membrane processes (Fig. 5 A). Brefeldin A and wortmannin redistributed myc-PRL-3 to compact and vacuole-like structures, respectively (Fig. 5, C andD). These results suggest that, like myc-PRL-1, myc-PRL-3 is also associated with the plasma membrane and the early endosome. To define the precise subcellular localization of myc-PRL-1 and -3, clone 9 and 36 cells were allowed to internalize BSA conjugated with 6-nm gold particles (BSA-gold) for 6 min so that the early endosome will be marked by the internalized BSA-gold (41.Rabinowitz S. Horstmann H. Gordon S. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 95-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Cells were processed for cryosections and then labeled with antibodies against the Myc epitope followed by protein A-conjugated with 9-nm gold particles (protein A-gold). As shown in Fig. 6 A, myc-PRL-1 is clearly associated with the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane (arrowheads). Furthermore, myc-PRL-1 is detected in both vacuole-like as well as vesicular-tubular network of the early endosome (Fig. 6 B, large arrowheads). The BSA-gold (Fig. 6 B, small arrowheads) is present in the vacuole-like but not the vesicular-tubular early endosome. These results establish that myc-PRL-1 is associated with the membrane of the cell surface and the early endosome. Similarly,"

The plasma membrane (or microvesicle) phospholipids of apoptotic or damaged cells are the preferred substrates for several sPLA2s (29.Atsumi G. Murakami M. Tajima M. Shimbara S. Hara N. Kudo I.

Type IVA cPLA2α has been reported to be involved in AA release during cell death in several cell types (31.Sapirstein A. Spech R.A. Witzgall R. Bonventre J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21505-21513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 32.Voelkel-Johnson C. Thorne T. Laster S.M. J.

In these studies, suppression of cPLA2α activity led to a decrease in cell death, whereas overexpression of cPLA2α enhanced cell death. On the contrary, subsequent studies showed that cPLA2α is degraded and catalytically inactivated by caspases (34.Atsumi G. Tajima M. Hadano A. Nakatani Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13870-13877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 35.Adam-Klages S. Schwandner R. Luschen S. Ussat S. Kreder D. Kronke M. J.

Commun. 1998; 253: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), raising the question as to whether cPLA2α plays some general role in apoptosis. Rather, our recent study showed that increased fatty acid release during Fas-induced apoptosis was sensitive to inhibitors of iPLA2rather than of cPLA2α (34.Atsumi G. Tajima M. Hadano A. Nakatani Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13870-13877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide evidence that iPLA2 indeed mediates enhanced release of fatty acids from apoptotic cells. Deletion of the N-terminal first ankyrin repeat by the action of caspase-3 renders iPLA2 more active than the uncleaved form. In contrast, the catalytically inactive N-terminal cPLA2α fragment produced by caspase-3 shows a higher affinity for membranes than does the intact enzyme and behaves like a dominant-negative inhibitor of stimulus-induced AA release by cPLA2α as well as by sPLA2-IIA. The latter observation provides further support for a functional linkage between cPLA2α and signaling sPLA2. A23187 was obtained from Calbiochem. The agonistic anti-Fas antibody CH-11 (37.Yonehara S.

Human caspase-3 cDNA was a generous gift from Dr. K. Takahashi (Showa University, Tokyo, Japan). Phospholipids and neutral lipids used as standards for thin layer chromatography (TLC) were purchased from Avanti. MACS apoptotic cell isolation kit was purchased from Miltenyi Biotec. Protease inhibitors and all other regents, which were of analytical grade, were obtained from Wako. Human monocytic U937 cells, human cervix epithelioid carcinoma HeLa cells, and mouse fibroblastic L929 cells were obtained from RIKEN Cell Bank. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were from Health Science Research Resources Bank. U937 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS) (Intergen), 2 mmglutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2. The cells were preincubated with 0.1 μCi/ml [3H]AA (NEN Life Science Products) for 24 h, washed three times, resuspended at 1 × 107 cells/ml in cultured medium, and then treated with 50 or 100 ng/ml anti-Fas antibody or 100 units/ml TNFα in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml CHX for various periods. In some experiments, MAFP or BEL was added to the cells during incubation. The [3H]AA contents of neutral lipids were assessed by counting the radioactivity of a fraction extracted using the method of Dole and Meinertz (40.Dole V.P. Meinertz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2595-2599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell viability was assessed by the trypan blue dye exclusion test. The total lipids in radiolabeled cells and their supernatants were extracted using the method of Bligh and Dyer (41.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem.

The first and second solvent systems consisted of chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (65/25/4/2, v/v) and chloroform/methanol/formic acid (65/25/8.8, v/v), respectively. The zones on the silica gel corresponding to neutral lipids (a mixture of free fatty acids and other neutral lipids) and phospholipids were identified by comparing their mobilities with those of authentic standards, which were visualized with iodine vapor. The zones were each scraped into a vial, and the radioactivity was counted using a liquid β-scintillation counter (Aloka). In order to separate further the free fatty acids from other neutral lipids, the total lipids were developed on Silica Gel 60 plates using a solvent system of hexane/ether/acetic acid (80/30/1, v/v). The radioactivity associated with each lipid was expressed as a percentage of that associated with the total lipids. The cells were washed once with a buffer comprising 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 340 mm sucrose, suspended (3.3 × 107 cells/ml) in the same buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, and lysed by sonication for 1 min with a Branson Sonifier (power 30, 50% pulse cycle). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were incubated at 40 °C for 30 min in 250 μl of buffer comprising 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 0.4 mm Triton X-100, 0.1 mm ATP, and 15 μm1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]arachidonyl phosphatidylethanolamine as a substrate (42.Ackermann E.J.

Meinertz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2595-2599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the associated radioactivity was counted. Cells were magnetically labeled with annexin V conjugated with MACS colloidal super-paramagnetic MicroBeads, according to the instructions for the MACS apoptotic cell isolation kit, and a population of cells that expressed PS on the outer leaflets of their plasma membranes was collected by passing them through a separation column. Briefly, 5 × 106 cells prelabeled with 0.1 μCi/ml [3H]AA were incubated with annexin V MicroBeads in a binding buffer containing Ca2+ for 15 min at 10 °C and washed with the binding buffer. The magnetically labeled apoptotic cells were applied to the MS+ separation column, which was placed in the magnetic field of a MiniMACS magnet separator, and the non-apoptotic cells were passed through the column. The column was rinsed with the binding buffer and removed from the magnet separator. The apoptotic cells, which were magnetically retained on the column, were eluted with the binding buffer, and their radioactivity was counted. Caspase-3 activity was assayed using the CPP32/Caspase-3 colorimetric protease assay kit, which is based on spectrophotometric detection of the chromophorep-nitroanilide that is produced after cleavage of the labeled substrate DEVD-p-nitroanilide. Briefly, cells were lysed with the lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 10 min. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Then, 50 μg of protein equivalents were incubated with DEVD-p-nitroanilide for 2 h at 37 °C, and the absorbance of each solution at 405 nm was measured spectrophotometrically using a microtiter plate reader (Bio-Rad). Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then lysed in PBS containing 100 μm p-4(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 5 μm iodoacetamide, 5 mm EDTA, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 100 μm leupeptin by sonication for 1 min with a Branson Sonifier (power 30, 50% pulse cycle). The samples (10 μg of protein equivalents/lane) were subjected to 10% (w/v)SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) under reducing conditions and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), which were probed with the antibodies and visualized with the ECL Western blot analysis system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), as described previously (13.Kuwata H. Nakatani Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1733-1740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). A cPLA2α deletion mutant, cPLA2(1–522), was constructed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the cPLA2α coding sequence with exTaq polymerase (Takara) using the oligonucleotide pair 5′-ATGTCATTTATAGATCCTTAC-3′ and 5′-TCAGTCGAGCTCGTCATCGAA-3′, as described previously (34.Atsumi G.

The PCR product was ligated into pCR™3.1 (Invitrogen) and was transfected into Top10F′ supercompetent cells (Invitrogen). Colonies were picked up, and the plasmids were isolated and sequenced using a Taq cycle sequencing kit (Takara) and an auto-fluorometric DNA sequencer (DSQ-1000L, Shimadzu). Construction of iPLA2 mutants was carried out by PCR with KlenTaq polymerase (CLONTECH) using hamster iPLA2 cDNA (Dr. S. Jones, Genetics Institute) as a template. An iPLA2 deletion mutant, iPLA2(184-C), was generated using the oligonucleotide pair 5′-ATG TATCCGTATGATGTTCCTGATTATGCTAGCCTC AAC AAA GGA GAG ACG G-3′ (HA epitope underlined) and 5′-TCA CTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTC TGA TGA GGG CGA CAG CAG C-3′ (FLAG epitope underlined, which was attached as required for the experiments). HA-tagged iPLA2 was constructed using the primers 5′-ATG TATCCGTATGATGTTCCTGATTATGCTAGCCTC ATG CAG TTC TTC GGA C-3′ (HA epitope underlined) and 5′-TCA GGG CGA CAG CAG CAT TTG-3′. FLAG-tagged iPLA2 was constructed using the primers 5′-ATG CAG TTC TTC GGA CGC C-3′ and 5′-TCA CTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTC TGA TGA GGG CGA CAG CAG C-3′ (FLAG epitope underlined). PCR conditions were 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, for 25 cycles. The products of the expected size were subcloned into the pCR3.1 vector and sequenced as noted above. HEK293 cells stably expressing each PLA2 were established as described previously (16.Murakami M. Shimbara S. Kambe T. Kuwata H. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Kudo I. J. Biol.

To obtain cells expressing cPLA2(1–522) and epitope-tagged or truncated iPLA2, their cDNAs subcloned into pCR3.1 were transfected into 293 cells using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, 1 μg of plasmid was mixed with 5 μl of LipofectAMINE Plus in 200 μl of Opti-MEM medium, left for 15 min, and then added to cells that had attained 40–60% confluency in 6-well plates (Iwaki) in 1 ml of Opti-MEM. After incubation for 6 h, the medium was replaced with 2 ml of fresh culture medium (RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS). After overnight culture, the medium was replaced again with 2 ml of fresh medium, and culture was continued at 37 °C in a CO2incubator flushed with 5% CO2 in humidified air. For transient expression analyses, the cells were harvested 3 days after transfection and used immediately. In order to establish stable transfectants, the cells were cloned by limiting dilution in 96-well plates in culture medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). After culture for 2–4 weeks, wells containing a single colony were chosen, and the expression was assessed by RNA blotting as well as immunoblotting using appropriate probes or antibodies. These established clones were expanded and used in the experiments described below. To establish double transformants, 293 cells stably expressing cPLA2(1–522) were subjected to a second transfection with cPLA2α, sPLA2-IIA, or iPLA2cDNA, which had been subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) (Invitrogen). Three days after transfection, the cells were seeded into 96-well plates in the presence of 50 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen) in order to establish stable transformants expressing both cPLA2(1–522) and either PLA2 isozyme. Approximately equal amounts (∼10 μg) of total RNA obtained from the transfected cells were applied to individual lanes of 1.2% (w/v) formaldehyde-agarose gels, electrophoresed, and transferred to Immobilon-N membranes (Millipore). The resulting blots were then probed with the relevant cDNA probes, which had been labeled with [32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by random priming (Takara Shuzo). All hybridizations were carried out as described previously (15.Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30041-30051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). HEK293 transfectants (5 × 104 cells in 1 ml of culture medium) were seeded into 24-well plates. In order to assess AA release, 0.1 μCi/ml [3H]AA was added to the cells on day 3, when they had nearly reached confluent, and culture was continued for another day. After two washes with fresh medium, 250 μl of RPMI 1640 with or without 10 μm A23187, 1 ng/ml IL-1β, and/or 10% FCS was added to each well, and the amount of free [3H]AA released into the supernatant during culture (30 min with A23187 and up to 8 h with IL-1β) was measured. The percentage release of AA was calculated using the formula (S/(S +P)) × 100, where S and P are the radioactivities measured in equal portions of the supernatant and cell pellet, respectively. All of these procedures are described previously in detail (16.Murakami M. Shimbara S. Kambe T. Kuwata H. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Kudo I. J. Biol.

HEK293 transfectants (5 × 104 cells in 1 ml of culture medium) were seeded into 24-well plates. 0.1 μCi/ml [3H]AA was added to the cells on day 2, when they are 50% confluent, and culture was continued for another day. After two washes with fresh medium without FCS, 250 μl of RPMI 1640 containing 1% FCS with or without CHX or etoposide was added to each well, and the amount of radioactivity released into the supernatant during culture was measured. MAFP or BEL was added to cells during treatment with CHX or etoposide as required for the experiments. To assess oleic acid (OA) release, 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]OA (NEN Life Science Products) was added to the cells instead of [3H]AA. [35S]Methionine-labeled cPLA2α and its truncated mutant cPLA2(1–522) were synthesized using a PROTEINscript™ kit (Ambion). Briefly, plasmids containing mouse cPLA2α or cPLA2(1–522) cDNA were transcribed using RNA polymerase and then incubated with [35S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products) and rabbit reticulocyte lysate. The products were subjected to SDS-PAGE and visualized autoradiographically. The procedure was described in our previous report (34.Atsumi G. Tajima M. Hadano A. Nakatani Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13870-13877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). cDNAs for native and truncated forms of cPLA2α and those for HA-tagged native and truncated forms of iPLA2 were subcloned into the pEGFP-C3 and -C1 vectors (CLONTECH), respectively, at the EcoRI site. These plasmids were transfected into 293 cells seeded onto collagen-coated coverglasses (Iwaki Glass) using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.). After culture for 3 days, the cells were fixed with 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The coverslips were mounted on glass slides using Perma Fluor (Japan Tanner) and examined using a FLUOVIEW laser fluorescence microscope (Olympus). All values shown are means ± S.E. for three to six separate experiments. Differences between means were determined by Student's t test, and those atp < 0.05 were considered significant. We have previously reported that cPLA2α is cleaved at Asp522 by caspase-3 in U937 cells undergoing Fas-mediated apoptosis (34.Atsumi G. Tajima M. Hadano A. Nakatani Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13870-13877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). This proteolytic process destroys the catalytic dyad (Ser228 and Asp549) essential for cPLA2α activity, thereby leading to its enzymatic inactivation. Similar cPLA2α degradation was observed when U937 (see below), HeLa (35.Adam-Klages S. Schwandner R. Luschen S. Ussat S. Kreder D. Kronke M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5687-5694PubMed Google Scholar), or L929 cells (data not shown) were killed with TNFα in combination with CHX. Thus, it is likely that the caspase-directed cleavage of cPLA2α is an event generally occurring in the apoptotic process. In order to investigate whether the cleaved cPLA2α plays some roles in cellular AA metabolism, death, survival, or proliferation, we prepared cDNA for the mutant cPLA2α truncated at Asp522 (cPLA2(1–522)) and transfected it into HEK293 cells. When a sonicate of HEK293 cells expressing native cPLA2α was centrifuged at 100,000 × g and then subjected to immunoblotting using anti-cPLA2α antibody, most of the enzyme, as expected, was found to be recovered mainly in the supernatant cytosolic fraction (Fig. 1 A). On the other hand, overexpressed c"

The early generation of ceramide preceded transient activation of acidic ceramidase and subsequent production of sphingosine, followed by cytochrome c release, activation of caspases-2, -3, -6, -7, -8, and -9, Bid cleavage, and a later sustained ceramide accumulation. The caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone inhibited early increases of ceramide and sphingosine, whereas overexpression of Bcl-xL had no effect, and both prevented the later sustained ceramide accumulation. Exogenous sphingosine, as well as cell-permeable C2-ceramide, induced cytochromec release from mitochondria in a caspase-independent fashion leading to activation of caspase-9 and executioner caspases and, surprisingly, activation of the initiator caspase-8 and processing of its substrate Bid. These effects were also completely abolished by Bcl-xL overexpression. Our results suggest that sphingosine might also be involved in the mitochondria-mediated pathway of Fas-induced cell death in type II cells.

Krammer P.H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Recent studies have described the existence of two types of Fas-signaling pathways that depend on the amount of active caspase-8 produced at the DISC (2.Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). Type I cells are characterized by abundant recruitment of procaspase-8 to the DISC following Fas ligation, resulting in subsequent direct activation of executioner caspases in a Bcl-2/Bcl-xL-insensitive fashion (2.Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). In contrast, in type II cells (e.g. Jurkat cells), amounts of active caspase-8 generated at the DISC are very low, and apoptosis in these cells is believed to depend on Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL-regulated translocation of cytochrome c(cyt c) from the mitochondria to the cytosol (2.Scaffidi C.

Once released, cyt c binds to Apaf-1 (3.Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar), inducing it to associate with procaspase-9 (4.Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar), thereby triggering its autoactivation into a mature form, which in turn can directly cleave procaspase-3 and -7 (5.Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). It has recently been proposed that in type II cells, Bid, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, is activated by caspase-8 and, following cleavage, is translocated from the cytosol to the mitochondria, where it can mediate cyt c release (6.Li H.

Furthermore, it is possible that a further metabolite of ceramide may be the active component produced as a result of sphingomyelin turnover.

Herein, we report that treatment of Jurkat cells with anti-Fas antibody induces rapid generation of ceramide immediately followed by transient production of sphingosine, both preceding cyt c release and activation of executioner caspase-3, -6, and -7 as well as caspase-8 and Bid activation. In addition, exogenous C2-ceramide and sphingosine recapitulate Fas-induced apoptosis, cyt credistribution, and activation of caspase-2, -3, -6, -7, -8, -9, and Bid, in a Bcl-xL-sensitive fashion. Our findings suggest the potential involvement of sphingosine in mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in type II cells. Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Bcl-xL- and neomycin control vector (Neo)-transfected Jurkat cells were maintained in the same media supplemented with 1 mg/ml G418. Cells were suspended in serum-free medium before treatments. Anti-Fas IgM (clone CH-11) and anti-Fas IgG (clone ZB4) were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Ceramides (from bovine brain, type III), phosphocreatine, and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid were from Sigma. Various standard phospholipids and cardiolipin were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). Escherichia coli diacylglycerol kinase, octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, and ZVAD-fmk were from Calbiochem. C2-ceramide, C16-ceramide, sphingosine, DMS, fumonisin B1,d-erythro-2-(N-myristoylamino)-1-phenyl-1-propanol, and N-oleoylethanolamine (NOE) were from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA).

Ac-DEVD-AMC was from Bachem (King of Prussia, PA). 6-(N-(7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-ceramide (NBD-ceramide) was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Other reagents and solvents were analytical grade (Merck). Ceramide and sphingosine levels were measured and normalized to total cellular phospholipids as described previously (35.Edsall L.C. Pirianov G.G. Spiegel S. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6952-6960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ceramidase assays were performed as described previously (36.Augé N. Nikolova-Karakashian M. Carpentier S.

Briefly, cell lysates were incubated with NBD-ceramide (final concentration, 20 μm) for 2 h at 37 °C in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.2 (for neutral ceramidase), 0.5 m acetate buffer, pH 5 (for acidic ceramidase), or 10 mm Hepes-Tris, pH 8 (for alkaline ceramidase). The reaction was then stopped by adding chloroform/methanol, and the lipids were extracted, separated on alumina TLC plates using chloroform/methanol (95:5, by volume), and then chloroform/methanol/NH4OH (90:10:1, by volume). The fluorescent bands were cut, eluted in chloroform/methanol (2:1, by volume), and quantified using a Jobin-Yvon 3D spectrofluorometer (at 466 and 536 nm, for the excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively). Apoptosis was assessed by Hoechst staining as described previously (37.Cuvillier O. Rosenthal D.S. Smulson M.E. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2910-2916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The percent apoptotic cells was calculated as number of apoptotic cells per number of total cells counted. Mitochondrial preparations were performed as described previously (38.Cuvillier O. Mayhew E. Janoff A.S. Spiegel S. Blood. 1999; 94: 3583-3592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. After washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were prepared by resuspending cell pellets in 5 volumes of ice-cold buffer A (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mm sodium EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A) containing 250 mm sucrose. Cells were lysed by 15–20 passages through a 25-gauge needle, and homogenates were centrifuged at 1,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the resulting mitochondria pellets were resuspended in cold buffer A. For Western blot analysis, equal amounts of mitochondrial and cytosolic proteins were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE and then transblotted to nitrocellulose. Anti-cyt c mAb (PharMingen) and anti-cytc oxidase subunit II mAb (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were used as primary antibodies. Cell lysate preparation and Western blotting were carried out as described previously (37.Cuvillier O. Rosenthal D.S. Smulson M.E. Spiegel S. J. Biol.

Proteins were visualized by ECL using anti-rat (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), anti-rabbit, or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (Bio-Rad). Enzyme reactions were performed in 96-well plates with 20 μg of cytosolic proteins and a final concentration of 20 μm Ac-DEVD-AMC substrate as described previously (37.Cuvillier O. Rosenthal D.S.

A. 1999; 96: 13795-13800Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), we found that treatment of Jurkat cells with 50 ng/ml anti-Fas antibody resulted in acute changes in ceramide levels within 30 min from a basal level of ∼10 pmol/nmol total phospholipids (Fig. 1 A). Moreover, in agreement with recent studies (15.Tepper A.D. Boesen-de Cock J.G. de Vries E. Borst J. van Blitterswijk W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24308-24312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 27.Tepper A.D. de Vries E. van Blitterswijk W.J. Borst J. J. Clin.

The early generation of ceramide preceded activation of the executioner caspases as demonstrated by DEVDase activity measurements (Fig. 1 C) and the appearance of nuclear fragmentation (Fig. 1 D). Sphingosine, the product of ceramide hydrolysis catalyzed by ceramidases, has been shown to be rapidly produced during TNFα-mediated apoptosis in human neutrophils (28.Ohta H. Yatomi Y. Sweeney E.A. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and rat cardiomyocytes (32.Krown K.A. Page M.T. Nguyen C. Zechner D. Gutierrez V. Comstock K.L.

Hence, it was of interest to determine whether cross-linking of Fas could also increase sphingosine levels. The basal level of sphingosine in Jurkat cells is ∼0.1 pmol/nmol total phospholipids. Treatment with anti-Fas mAb caused a rapid 2-fold increase in sphingosine with a peak at 30–45 min (Fig. 1 A), which proceeded the rapid ceramide increase, and returned to basal levels by 60–90 min (Fig. 1 A). Treatment with exogenous C2-ceramide also resulted in increased sphingosine levels (Fig. 1 B), which preceded the increased DEVDase activity (Fig. 1 C) and apoptosis (Fig. 1 D) induced by C2-ceramide. Similarly, treatment with exogenous long chain C16-ceramide (25 μm) or with bacterial sphingomyelinase (100 milliunits/ml), which hydrolyzes membrane sphingomyelin to increase long chain ceramide levels, markedly induced activation of caspases and formation of apoptotic nuclei, in agreement with a previous report (15.Tepper A.D.

Nuclear fragmentation was clearly evident within 3 h after the addition of sphingosine (data not shown). After treatment for 6 h with 10 μm sphingosine, almost 75% of the cells showed apoptotic changes (Fig. 1 D), whereas a concentration as low as 2.5 μm was sufficient to induce fragmented nuclei in ∼30% of the cells (data not shown). To examine the possibility that sphingosine could induce apoptosis due to its conversion to ceramide, we investigated the effect of the mycotoxin fumonisin B1, a known inhibitor of ceramide synthase (39.Merrill Jr., A.H. van Echten G. Wang E. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27299-27306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to previous results in HL-60 cells (29.Jarvis W.D. Fornari F.A. Traylor R.S.

J. 1999; 338: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), fumonisin B1 itself did not induce apoptosis nor did it affect the extent of apoptosis induced by sphingosine (Fig.2 A). Although this ceramide synthase inhibitor almost completely inhibited the late peak of ceramide induced by Fas ligation (Fig. 2 B), it had no significant effect on the extent of apoptosis (Fig. 2 A), suggesting that the late increase in ceramide is not required for Fas-induced apoptosis. Moreover, a higher concentration of fumonisin B1 (100 μm) not only inhibited elevation of ceramide induced by 5 μm sphingosine by more than 70% after 5 h of treatment, it also markedly enhanced apoptosis induced by sphingosine. It should be noted that similar to addition of sphingosine, treatment with C2-ceramide also resulted in the appearance of a late peak of endogenous ceramide (Fig. 2 B), which could be due in part to conversion of sphingosine (Fig. 1 B) to ceramide by ceramide synthase, inasmuch as fumonisin B1 was capable of inhibiting the late increase. Because current evidence suggests that ceramide functions proximal to the executioner caspases (15.Tepper A.D. Boesen-de Cock J.G. de Vries E. Borst J. van Blitterswijk W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24308-24312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 37.Cuvillier O. Rosenthal D.S. Smulson M.E. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2910-2916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), we examined whether addition of sphingosine resulted in activation of caspase-3 and -7, which drive the effector phase of apoptosis. To determine caspase activity, we used the fluorogenic substrate, Ac-DEVD-AMC, which corresponds to the cleavage site found in numerous caspase-3 and -7 targets (40.Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). Sphingosine treatment resulted in a time-dependent increase in DEVDase activity which correlated with the onset of apoptosis and preceded the appearance of fragmented nuclei by approximately 1 h (Fig. 1, C andD). A similar correlation was observed with ceramide or anti-Fas treatment, which increased DEVDase activity prior to detection of the first morphological signs of apoptosis. Proteolytic processing of procaspase-3 and -7 was also examined by Western blotting. In agreement with our previous study (37.Cuvillier O. Rosenthal D.S. Smulson M.E. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2910-2916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), procaspase-3 and -7 were cleaved into their respective active forms after anti-Fas (Fig.3, A and B) treatment in a time-dependent fashion similar to the increase in DEVDase activity (Fig. 1 C). Extracts from cells treated with sphingosine also showed significantly increased caspase-3 and -7 processing (Fig. 3, E and F), again with a similar time course to the increase in DEVDase activity (Fig.1 C). Because overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL protects against diverse apoptotic stimuli, including ceramide-induced apoptosis (41.Zhang J. Alter N. Reed J.C. Borner C. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Proc. Natl.

Jurkat cells stably transfected with bcl-x L expressed high levels of Bcl-xL protein (Fig.4 A) and were completely resistant to apoptosis induced by C2-ceramide as well as sphingosine (Fig. 4 B). Bcl-xL similarly prevented C2-ceramide- and sphingosine-induced increases in DEVDase activity (Fig. 4 C). In agreement with other studies (27.Tepper A.D. de Vries E. van Blitterswijk W.J. Borst J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 971-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 42.Martin S.J. Takayama S. McGahon A.J. Miyashita T. Corbeil J. Kolesnick R.N. Reed J.C. Green D.R. Cell Death Differ. 1995; 2: 253-257PubMed Google Scholar), Bcl-xL also blocked apoptosis induced by C16-ceramide and bacterial sphingomyelinase which hydrolyzes sphingomyelin to generate natural ceramide. Processing of executioner procaspase-3 (Fig.5 A), -7 (Fig. 5 B), and -6 (Fig. 5 C) into their mature forms and cleavage of their respective substrates, PARP and lamin B (data not shown), were also completely prevented in Jurkat cells overexpressing Bcl-xL. Caspase-2 shares the optimal peptide recognition motif DEXD with executioner caspase-3 and -7 (47.Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M.

We demonstrate that MtMCM contains helicase activity that preferentially uses dATP and DNA-dependent dATPase and ATPase activities. The intrinsic helicase activity of MtMCM is abolished when a conserved lysine in the helicase domain I/nucleotide binding site is mutated. MtMCM helicase unwinds DNA duplexes in a 3′ → 5′ direction and can unwind up to 500 base pairs in vitro. The kinetics, processivity, and directionality of MtMCM support its role as a replicative helicase inM. thermoautotrophicum.

Biol. 1996; 6: 1416-1425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Experiments in a variety of model systems have indicated that all six MCM subunits are present in MCM complexes, suggesting that MCMs might exist as heterohexameric complexes in the cell in a 1:1 stoichiometry (reviewed in Ref. 12.Kearsey S.E. Labib K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1398: 113-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). However, biochemical purification and extraction procedures have also revealed the existence of subcomplexes within this hexameric complex consisting of a tightly bound core complex (MCM4, -6, and -7) more loosely associated with MCM2 and a second complex composed of MCM3 and -5 (24.Adachi Y. Usukura J. Yanagida M. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 25.Kimura H. Ohtomo T. Yamaguchi M. Ishii A. Sugimoto K.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3312-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These observations have raised the possibility that several MCM complexes with potentially different functions might co-exist in the cell. MCM proteins share extensive similarities within a central core domain. All MCM proteins contain a putative ATPase domain within this core, which resembles that found in DNA helicases. In particular, the highly conserved Walker A and Walker B domains, which have been implicated in ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis, respectively, are found in all MCM proteins (30.Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2541-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Walker A and B domains correspond to the conserved regions I and II of the helicase superfamily (31.Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). A variety of observations have suggested that MCM proteins could function as a replicative helicase either during DNA replication initiation or for both the initiation and elongation steps. 1) Helicases are DNA-dependent NTPases, using the energy of hydrolysis to transiently unwind DNA. The Walker domains are therefore key features of helicases (31.Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). 2) Loading MCM proteins onto the chromatin requires the Cdc6 loading factor, because the loading of the bacterial DnaB helicase requires DnaC (reviewed in Ref. 32.Baker T.A. Bell S.P. Cell. 1998; 92: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). 3) MCM protein complexes purified from Schizosaccharomyces pombeexhibited ring-shaped structures when observed by electron microscopy. Some of these structures seemed to display a ringlike 6-fold symmetry reminiscent of that observed with some DNA helicases (24.Adachi Y. Usukura J. Yanagida M. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). 4) Purified MCM complexes composed of MCM4, MCM6, and MCM7 contained weak helicase activity in vitro, restricted to the unwinding of very short oligonucleotides (33.Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 34.You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the hexameric MCM complex purified from S. pombe did not exhibit any helicase activity (24.Adachi Y. Usukura J. Yanagida M. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In addition, the MCM2 subunit has been reported to display inhibitory activity in vitro toward the helicase activity of the MCM4, -6, and -7 complex (35.Ishimi Y. Komamura Y. You Z. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8369-8375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Studies on the localization of MCM proteins during the process of replication have also provided conflicting data. Chromatin precipitation studies in budding yeast supported the idea that some MCM proteins move along the replication fork as DNA replication proceeds, suggesting that if MCM proteins are a helicase they could be involved in an initial unwinding step as well as during elongation (36.Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 91: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 37.Tanaka T. Knapp D. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1997; 90: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence studies in other organisms, however, have indicated that MCM proteins do not colocalize with the sites of incorporation of nucleotides during replication, suggesting that the role of MCM proteins might be restricted to an initiation event (38.Todorov I.T. Attaran A. Kearsey S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1433-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 39.Romanowski P. Madine M.A. Laskey R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10189-10194Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 40.Kimura H. Nozaki N. Sugimoto K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4311-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Helicases are enzymes that unwind the nucleic acid duplex and are essential for many cellular processes such as replication, repair, or transcription. They can process the unwinding of DNA with specific directionality and are referred as 3′ → 5′ or 5′ → 3′ helicases. Helicases are generally oligomeric, usually dimers or hexamers. It has been demonstrated that several of the helicases implicated in DNA replication such as SV40 or polyoma T antigen have a hexameric structure (41.Wang E.H. Prives C. Virology. 1991; 184: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 42.Dean F.B. Borowiec J.A. Eki T. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14129-14137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the replicative hexameric T7 DNA helicase protein 4 was recently solved, suggesting that progression along the DNA leading to the unwinding of the duplex used a corkscrew-like inchworm mechanism (43.Sawaya M.R. Guo S. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1999; 99: 167-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The directionality of the helicase is not conferred by the dimeric or hexameric structure, since both specificities have been described with each type of structure (reviewed in Ref. 44.Bird L.E. Subramanya H.S. Wigley D.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 14-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Despite the presence of a large number of putative helicase sequences in the eukaryotic genome (134 putative helicase sequences have been identified in S. cerevisiae), no replicative helicase has yet been identified in eukaryotes (45.Shiratori A. Shibata T. Arisawa M. Hanaoka F. Murakami Y. Eki T. Yeast. 1999; 15: 219-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The complete sequence of an archaebacterium genome (Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum) revealed that archaea contained putative open reading frames sharing homology with different components of the prereplicative complex, namely origin recognition complex, Cdc6, and MCM (46.Smith D.R. Doucette-Stamm L.A. Deloughery C. Lee H. Dubois J. Aldredge T. Bashirzadeh R. Blakely D. Cook R. Gilbert K. Harrison D. Hoang L. Keagle P. Lumm W. Pothier B. Qiu D. Spadafora R. Vicaire R. Wang Y. Wierzbowski J. Gibson R. Jiwani N. Caruso A. Bush D. Reeve J.N. et al.J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7135-7155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). Furthermore, putative origins of replication have been recently identified in archaea (47.Lopez P. Philippe H. Myllykallio H. Forterre P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 883-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition to the fact that archaea possess homologues of most of the essential genes involved in DNA replication (48.Edgell D.R. Doolittle W.F. Cell. 1997; 89: 995-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), this observation strengthened the idea that archaea possess features that are more closely related to eukaryotic than prokaryotic DNA replication, supporting the hypothesis that the divergence between archaea and eukaryotes occurred later than the divergence between archaea and prokaryotes. The subsequent sequencing of other archaea genomes confirmed these findings. Interestingly, two of the archaea genomes sequenced (M. thermoautotrophicum and Archaeoglobus fulgidus) contained a single open reading frame related to MCM proteins (49.Klenk H.P. Clayton R.A. Tomb J.F. White O. Nelson K.E. Ketchum K.A. Dodson R.J. Gwinn M. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Richardson D.L. Kerlavage A.R. Graham D.E. Kyrpides N.C. Fleischmann R.D. Quackenbush J. Lee N.H. Sutton G.G. Gill S. Kirkness E.F. Dougherty B.A. McKenney K. Adams M.D. Loftus B. Venter J.C. et al.Nature. 1997; 390: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar), while Methanococcus jannaschii contained four MCM-related sequences (50.Bult C.J. White O. Olsen G.J. Zhou L. Fleischmann R.D. Sutton G.G. Blake J.A. FitzGerald L.M. Clayton R.A. Gocayne J.D. Kerlavage A.R. Dougherty B.A. Tomb J.F. Adams M.D. Reich C.I. Overbeek R. Kirkness E.F. Weinstock K.G. Merrick J.M. Glodek A. Scott J.L. Geoghagen N.S.M. Venter J.C. Science. 1996; 273: 1058-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). Nothing is yet known about the biochemical function of these MCM-related proteins in archaea. In particular, it is not known whether they might be involved in DNA replication. As a step toward better understanding the biochemical role of MCM proteins and as an attempt to clarify some of the discrepancies regarding their possible biochemical function, we decided to take advantage of the presence of a single MCM protein in M. thermoautotrophicum, since it opened the possibility to test the biochemical function of this protein in a simpler system where the potential inhibitory effect of other subunits would not be relevant. Here we report the expression and the purification of the M. thermoautotrophicum MCM-related ORF proteins fromEscherichia coli and baculovirus-infected cells. We show that the purified protein multimerizes in complexes consistent with being double hexamers. We demonstrate that MtMCM is a DNA helicase that preferentially uses dATP and that nucleotide binding is essential for activity. We also show that MtMCM is a DNA-dependent dATPase and ATPase. MtMCM works catalytically to unwind DNA duplexes in a 3′ → 5′ direction and can unwind up to 500 base pairs in vitro. The kinetics, processivity, and directionality of the enzymatic activity all support the idea that MtMCM can work as a replicative helicase. [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. dNTPs and ATP were from APBiotech, while the other nucleotides were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Sigma Genosys. T4 polynucleotide kinase was from New England Biolabs, and the Klenow enzyme was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. MtMCM was cloned fromM. thermoautotrophicum genomic DNA (a generous gift of Dr. Reeve). To facilitate purification of MtMCM protein, sequences encoding a 6-histidine tag were added to the C terminus of the MtMCM gene by PCR. The MtMCM gene was amplified by PCR using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) with CCCCTCTAGAAAACCTATAAATCATATGATGAAAACCGTGGATAAGAGC as the 5′ primer (the engineered XbaI and NdeI restriction sites, respectively, are underlined) and GGGGCTCGAGTTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCAGACTATCTTAAGGTATCCC as the 3′ primer (XhoI site is underlined). The PCR product was subcloned into the XbaI and XhoI sites of the baculovirus expression vector pFASTBAC (Life Technologies, Inc.) and sequenced using an Applied Biosystem Automated Sequencer. Subsequently, MtMCM was subcloned into the NdeI and XhoI sites of the E. coli expression vector pET21b (Novagen). MtMCM recombinant baculovirus was generated based on the BAC-TO-BAC Baculovirus Expression System (Life Technologies, Inc.). MtMCM was mutated at lysine 325 to alanine by PCR using Vent DNA polymerase (NEB) with GGGCGGCCCAGCAGGCCATAA as the 5′ primer (the SfiI site is underlined) and GCGCGGTACCCTTACCGCTGGTGTATATCCCCCTGGGGGCCAGCTTTGAGACGTACTTGAGCATCTGTGACGCACCGATACCGGGGTCCCC as the 3′ primer (the KpnI site, the modified codon (lysine → alanine), and a silent mutation in the SmaI site are underlined, respectively). The PCR product was subcloned back into the MtMCM-pET21b vector at the unique SfiI andKpnI sites present in the MtMCM sequence. The mutation was detected by loss of the SmaI site and confirmed by sequencing. For expression of MtMCM protein in E. coli, the pET21b vector containing the MtMCM gene was transformed into DE3(BL21)pLysS cells (Novagen) and grown from an overnight culture in 5.5 liters of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C and 375 rpm. When the cells reached anA 600 of 0.6, protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.6 mm. The cells were grown for an additional 3 h and harvested by centrifugation. The cells were resuspended in a small volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose, and protease inhibitors (100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.2 μg/ml leupeptin) and frozen at −70 °C immediately. The cells were then thawed and sonicated on ice and spun in an SS34 rotor at 16,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was removed and precipitated with ammonium sulfate first at 20% and then at 45% saturation. The 45% pellet was resuspended in and dialyzed overnight against 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm imidazole, and protease inhibitors. Following the increase of imidazole concentration to 50 mm, the protein was loaded onto a pre-equilibrated 10-ml Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) column and eluted with a 50–300 mm imidazole gradient. The peak pool of protein was dialyzed overnight against 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors. This pool was then loaded onto a 10-ml Source Q (APBiotech) column pre-equilibrated in the above buffer. The column was washed with 3 volumes of buffer and then eluted with a 100-ml 100–450 mmNaCl gradient. The peak fractions were pooled, and the protein concentration (2.0 mg/ml) was determined by anA 280 measurement using the calculated extinction coefficient of 29,570 liters mol−1 cm−1. For eukaryotic expression of MtMCM protein, Sf9 insect cells (Invitrogen) were infected with the recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 5 and harvested 96 h postinfection. The native recombinant MtMCM protein in infected cell lysate was purified on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column and eluted with 350 mm imidazole and then dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 80 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The protein concentration (0.5 mg/ml) was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. For expression of K325A-MtMCM, the mutant vector was transformed and expressed in E. coli and purified as described for the wild type, with the exception of the Source Q step. The substrate used in the standard DNA helicase reaction was prepared by annealing a 5′-end-labeled 63-mer oligonucleotide (5′-TGCCAAGCTTGCATGCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTACCGAGCTCGAATTCGT-3′ (the HincII site is underlined)) to M13mp18 single-stranded DNA (New England Biochemicals). The oligonucleotide was labeled in a reaction (20 μl) containing 18 pmol of 63-mer, 1× polynucleotide kinase buffer (New England Biochemicals), 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 15 units of T4 kinase for 30 min at 37 °C. The labeled oligonucleotide was separated from free nucleotide in a G-25 spin column (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the specific activity of the labeled DNA was determined by liquid scintillation counting (usually 1500 cpm/fmol). The helicase template was prepared by annealing the oligonucleotide to M13 in the following conditions: a 32-μl reaction volume containing 2 pmol of M13 DNA and 4 pmol of labeled oligonucleotide, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and 15 mmMgCl2. The reaction was layered with mineral oil, placed in a heat block at 100 °C, and then slowly cooled to room temperature. The annealed substrate was separated from unannealed oligonucleotide via gel filtration through a 5-ml Biogel A-15M (Bio-Rad) column in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and 100 mm NaCl. Six-drop fractions were collected, and the peak fractions in the void volume were pooled. The yield of template was calculated using the specific activity of the oligonucleotide. The template used to determine directionality was prepared by digesting the standard template with HincII, resulting in a linear, blunt-ended template with a 38-nucleotide oligonucleotide annealed to the 3′-end of the M13 molecule and a 25-nucleotide32P-labeled oligonucleotide annealed to the 5′-end. Subsequently, the 3′-end of the 38-mer was extended 2 nucleotides with the Klenow enzyme and [α-32P]dATP, resulting in a linear template with short radiolabeled double-stranded regions at each end. The standard helicase assay reaction (20 μl) contained 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 2.5 mmdATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and either 5 or 10 fmol of helicase substrate. For incubations at 60 °C, the reaction was incubated in a heated-top PCR machine (PE9600) in order to prevent evaporation. The time course reactions were incubated layered with mineral oil in a heat block. The reactions were incubated for 30 min and stopped by the addition of 5 μl of a 5× stop solution (final concentrations: 0.5% SDS, 40 mm EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K, 20% Ficoll, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) and then run on a 10% polyacrylamide TBE gel containing 0.1% SDS at a constant voltage of 150 V, soaked in 20% trichloroacetic acid, and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics). The reaction products were quantitated, and any free oligo in the absence of enzyme was subtracted. The standard assay reaction (10 μl) contained 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 μmdATP, 5 nm [α-32P]dATP, 5 mmMgCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Incubations were performed as described for the helicase assay and stopped by the addition of 1 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. The reaction products (NTP, NDP, Pi) were separated by running 1 μl of the reaction on a polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plate (Selecto Scientific) in 0.8 m acetic acid and 0.8m lithium chloride. The plate was air-dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager for imaging and quantification. Any background [α-32P]dADP released in the absence of enzyme was subtracted. The molar values were calculated by quantification of 1 μl of the reaction spotted on the TLC plate after the run. A Superose 6 (APBiotech) column was equilibrated and run on an FPLC system in 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol and the indicated salt or EDTA concentration. The column was run at 0.4 ml/min at 4 °C. Injections were made in a volume of 200 μl. Fractions (14 drops, about 385–400 μl) were collected after 7 ml had flowed through the column after injection of the sample. Gel filtration markers (Bio-Rad), when indicated, were run in the same buffer conditions as the experiment. The complete sequence of M. thermoautotrophicumrevealed the presence of one ORF (ORF 1770) that was similar to MCM protein sequences. When this ORF was compared with the entire protein data base using the BLAST software (51.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70758) Google Scholar), it appeared that MtMCM was most closely related to the MCM4 branch of the MCM protein family (10.Tye B.K. Methods. 1999; 18: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar,12.Kearsey S.E. Labib K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1398: 113-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Using the ClustalW 1.8 alignment program (52.Higgins D.G. Bleasby A.J. Fuchs R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1992; 8: 189-191PubMed Google Scholar), we have compared the MtMCM protein sequence with the fission yeast Cdc21/MCM4 andXenopus MCM4 sequences. This alignment is shown in Fig.1. MtMCM lacks the N-terminal region present in all the eukaryotic proteins. MtMCM was found to be 35% identical with both S. pombe and Xenopus laevissequences over the aligned regions lacking the N termini. Over the same region, the MtMCM protein was 49 and 48% similar to the S. pombe and X. laevis sequences, respectively. The highest homology was found in the core region of the proteins encompassing the putative nucleotide binding regions and ATPase motifs. Interestingly, the N-terminal region of eukaryotic MCM4 proteins contains putative consensus sites for phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase (see Fig. 1) (12.Kearsey S.E. Labib K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1398: 113-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). These sites are absent from the MtMCM protein. We have underlined the Walker A and Walker B domains of the protein sequences, which also correspond to the conserved domains I and II (31.Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1034) Google Scholar) found in all known helicases (Fig.1). In order to determine the role of MtMCM, we isolated the cDNA encoding for MtMCM from M. thermoautotrophicum genomic DNA (a generous gift from Dr. J. Reeve) and inserted it into two different expression vectors as fusion proteins containing a C-terminal His6 tag (see “Experimental Procedures”). The protein was expressed in E. coli and in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system. In both cases, the protein was soluble and was purified under native conditions. Following a three-step purification procedure (see “Experimental Procedures”), the protein synthesized in E. coli migrated as a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 75 kDa, consistent with its predicted molecular mass of 76.5 kDa (Fig.2 A, left panel). The identity of the protein was further confirmed by Western blotting detection using an anti-His6 tag antibody (data not shown and Fig. 3 B). We also expressed MtMCM in E. coli in which the conserved lysine within the Walker A domain was replaced by an alanine, referred to a"

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2559-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and the JunB protein inhibits the activity and function of c-Jun (7.Chiu R. Angel P. Karin M.

A second phase of serum-induced gene expression occurs 3–6 h after serum stimulation and is dependent on new protein synthesis (9.Lanahan A. Williams J.B. Sanders L.K. Nathans D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 2: 3919-3929Crossref Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The induction of the G1 phase regulatory cyclins, the cyclin-dependent kinase phosphatases, and the E2F-responsive genes contributes to the continued passage of the cell through G1 and into the S phase (10.Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar, 11.Nevins J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar). Both the cyclin D1 and cdc25A genes are induced with characteristic delayed-early gene kinetics and contribute to the induction of DNA synthesis (3.Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Reutens A.T. Segall J.E.

The cyclin D1 gene product encodes a regulatory subunit of a holoenzyme that phosphorylates and inactivates pRB. Immunoneutralizing antibody and antisense expression studies demonstrated that the abundance of cyclin D1 is rate-limiting in growth factor- and mitogen-induced progression through the G1 phase (14.Resnitzky D.

Mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from mice in which the cyclin D1 gene was homozygously deleted (cyclin D1−/−) displayed reduced cell proliferation (18.Brown J.R. Nigh E. Lee R.J. Ye H.

Several lines of evidence suggest that c-Fos and c-Jun may induce the cyclin D1 gene and thereby enhance S phase entry. Thus, c-Fos was shown to induce the cyclin D1 gene (19.Albanese C. Johnson J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar), and the low levels of cyclin D1 in mouse embryo fibroblasts derived fromc-fos/FOSB−/− mice were rescued by c-Fos overexpression (19.Albanese C.

In addition,c-jun −/− mouse embryo fibroblasts display a proliferative defect in response to serum and a reduction in cyclin D1 abundance (20.Wisdom R. Johnson R.S. Moore C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 188-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Serum and growth factor signaling to discrete transcription factor targets is coordinated by evolutionarily conserved modular intracellular signaling kinase cascades (21.Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs),1 which relay these signals, are proline-directed serine/threonine kinases and include extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 MAPKs (22.Lin A. Smeal T. Binetruy B. Deng T. Chambard J.C. Karin M. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1993; 28: 255-260PubMed Google Scholar). The modularity and specificity in these signal transduction cascades are coordinated by several mechanisms, including selective phosphorylation of downstream kinases (23.Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar), targeting by specific MAPK phosphatases, subcellular localization of the kinases (24.Wilkinson M.G. Milar J.B.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), MAPK isoform-selective targeting of specific transcription factors (25.Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A. Cavanagh J. Derijard B. Davis R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar), and the interaction with scaffolding proteins that mediate the interactions between components of the MAPK module (26.Dickens M.

Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). The ERK/MAPK cascade is also regulated by the relative abundance of the caveolin-1 protein (28.Galbiati F. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 29.Engelman J.A. Chu C. Lin A. Jo H. Ikezu T. Okamoto T. Kohtz D.S. Lisanti M.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 is an important component of caveolar membranes, invaginations of the plasma membrane thought to participate in vesicular trafficking and signal transduction events (30.Smart E.J. Graf G.A. McNiven M.A. Sessa W.C. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7289-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Caveolins are most abundant in differentiated cells, and caveolin-1 levels have been shown to be reduced in fibroblasts transformed by oncogenic Ha-ras (G12V) or v-abl (31.Koleske A.J. Baltimore D. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1381-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) and in mammary adenocarcinoma cells induced by overexpression of ErbB2 (32.Engelman J.A. Lee R.J. Karnezis A. Bearss D.J. Webster M. Siegel P. Muller W.J. Windle J.J. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20448-20455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Furthermore, caveolin-1 was identified as one of 26 genes whose mRNA was down-regulated in human breast cancer cell lines (33.Sager, R., Sheng, S., Anisowicz, A., Sotiropoulou, G., Zou, Z., Stenman, G., Swisshelm, K., Chen, Z., Hendrix, M. J., and Pemberton, P. E. A. (1994) Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 537–546Google Scholar). Overexpression of caveolin-1 in v-abl- and Ha-ras-transformed NIH-3T3 cells abrogated their anchorage-independent growth (34.Engelman J.A. Wykoff C.C. Yasuhara S. Song K.S. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16374-16381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), and transfection with antisense caveolin-1 was sufficient to induce cellular transformation and ERK activity (28.Galbiati F. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Despite these studies, the molecular mechanisms by which caveolin-1 regulates cellular transformation are largely unknown. In this study, we assessed whether caveolin-1 can directly regulate cyclin D1 expression. We show that the cyclin D1 gene is inhibited during overexpression of caveolin-1 as a result of repression of the cyclin D1 promoter and that the DNA sequences required contain the T-cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer factor-1 (LEF-1)-binding site. We conclude that repression of the cyclin D1 gene by caveolin-1 may contribute to the inhibition of cellular transformation. The abundance of cyclin D1, JunB, and caveolin-1 was determined by Western blot analysis as described previously using antibodies to cyclin D1 (DCS-6, NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA), JunB (N-17, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), c-Fos, and Rho-GTPase guanine-nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (35.Watanabe G.

CHO cells (GRC+ LR-73; a generous gift from Dr. J. Pollard (47.Pollard J.W. Stanners C.P. J. Cell.

The NIH-3T3 cells stably expressing antisense caveolin-1 and revertants of such NIH-3T3 lines have been described previously (28.Galbiati F. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. In transient expression studies, cells were transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation; the medium was changed after 6 h; and luciferase activity was determined after another 24 h. The effect of an expression vector was compared with that of an equal amount of empty vector. Luciferase content was measured during the initial 10 s of the reaction using an AutoLumat LB953 (EG&G Berthold), and the values are expressed in arbitrary light units (35.Watanabe G. Lee R.J.

Statistical analyses were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test with significant differences established as p < 0.05. Previous studies have demonstrated that cyclin D1 levels are increased (19.Albanese C. Johnson J. Watanabe G. Eklund N. Vu D. Arnold A. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar) and that caveolin-1 levels are decreased in Ha-ras(G12V)-transformed fibroblast cells (31.Koleske A.J. Baltimore D. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1381-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). We have therefore examined the abundance of cyclin D1 and caveolin-1 in tumors derived from murine mammary tumor virus ras-transformed cells. Cyclin D1 levels were increased in each of the tumors examined (Fig.1 A) and were associated with reduced or undetectable caveolin-1 levels. In previous studies, we showed that cyclin D1 levels were increased in mammary tumors from murine mammary tumor virus src transgenic mice (36.Lee R.J. Albanese C. Stenger R.J. Watanabe G. Inghirami G. Haines G.K.I. Webster M. Muller W.J. Brugge J.S. Davis R.J. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7341-7350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), whereas caveolin-1 levels were undetectable in these tumors (32.Engelman J.A. Lee R.J. Karnezis A. Bearss D.J. Webster M. Siegel P. Muller W.J. Windle J.J. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20448-20455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of serum and growth factors on caveolin-1 and cyclin D1 levels, NIH-3T3 cells were serum-starved or treated with serum, FGF, or PDGF for 16 h. Serum starvation was associated with a reduction in cyclin D1 levels and an increase in caveolin-1 abundance. The addition of serum, FGF (5 ng/ml), or PDGF (50 ng/ml) induced cyclin D1 levels and reduced caveolin-1 abundance (Fig. 1 B). To determine whether caveolin-1 overexpression can directly regulate cyclin D1 levels, cell lines stably overexpressing antisense caveolin-1 (28.Galbiati F. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) were examined for the abundance of cyclin D1. Revertants of 3T3 cells that have lost antisense caveolin expression (28.Galbiati F. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), similar to the parental NIH-3T3 cell line (data not shown), showed a 4-fold increase in caveolin-1 protein levels (Fig. 1 C) compared with the antisense caveolin-1-expressing clone. Cyclin D1 levels were increased by 60% in the antisense caveolin-1 stable cell line compared with the revertant (Fig. 1 C). Caveolin-1 and cyclin D1 expression levels therefore appear to be inversely related in 3T3 cells and mammary tumor tissue. In contrast with the reduction in cyclin D1 protein levels by caveolin-1, the JunB protein was increased in association with increased caveolin-1 levels (Fig. 1 C). To determine whether caveolin-1 overexpression can regulate the activity of the cyclin D1 gene promoter, transient expression studies were performed using a caveolin-1 expression plasmid and the empty expression vector (pCB7). The results summarized in Fig.2 B show that overexpression of caveolin-1 repressed the activity of the cyclin D1 promoter in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, overexpression of caveolin-3 (Fig. 2 A, Cav-3) did not inhibit the activity of the cyclin D1 promoter (Fig. 2 B). Cyclin D1 promoter-luciferase construct was repressed by 70% using a reporter/expression vector ratio of 4:1 (Fig. 2 B). Previous studies have shown that caveolin-1 can inhibit the function of the serum-responsive transcription factor Elk-1 in a heterologous luciferase reporter assay (32.Engelman J.A. Lee R.J. Karnezis A. Bearss D.J. Webster M. Siegel P. Muller W.J. Windle J.J. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20448-20455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of caveolin-1 overexpression on the native c-fos gene promoter. Comparison was made with the effect of caveolin-1 on the cyclin D1 promoter. The data are shown as mean luciferase activity in Fig.3 A. In contrast with the −1745CD1LUC reporter, which was repressed by caveolin-1, the c-fos promoter was not significantly repressed using a reporter/expression vector ratio of 4:1. As recent studies identified a serum response element in the cdc25A gene that is distinct from the one in the c-fos gene (13.Chen X. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4695-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the activities of thecdc25A promoter and those of the immediate-early genes c-jun and junB were determined in cells transfected with caveolin-1. The results shown in Fig. 3 Cdemonstrate that caveolin-1 inhibited the activity of thecdc25A promoter by 80% and that of the c-jungene reporter by 70%. The effect of caveolin-1 on the cyclin D1 and c-fos promoters was not significantly changed by serum concentrations (data not shown). In contrast, the junBpromoter was induced by caveolin-1 by 15–30-fold (Fig. 3 D). Together, these studies suggest that caveolin-1 repression of cyclin D1 promoter activity is inhibited by a serum-independent mechanism. To examine the DNA sequences in the cyclin D1 promoter required for repression by caveolin-1, the promoter activities in a series of cyclin D1 promoter constructs containing truncations and point mutations were assayed. Repression of the cyclin D1 promoter by caveolin-1 was maintained when the sequences between −1745 and −163 base pairs of the promoter were deleted (Fig.4 A). Since the cAMP response element site of the cyclin D1 promoter was previously shown to convey serum responsiveness in fibroblasts (18.Brown J.R. Nigh E. Lee R.J. Ye H. Thompson M.A. Saudou F. Pestell R.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5609-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and the AP-1 site is involved in mitogenic responses to angiotensin II and Ras (19.Albanese C. Johnson J. Watanabe G. Eklund N. Vu D. Arnold A. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 35.Watanabe G. Lee R.J. Albanese C. Rainey W.E. Batlle D. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22570-22577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), we used point mutants in these sites and found that the inhibitory effect of caveolin-1 on the cyclin D1 promoter was not affected in these mutants (Fig. 4, B and C). Within the proximal −163 base pairs that are still responsive to caveolin-1 overexpression, a binding site for the β-catenin· TCF complex was recently identified (40.Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J. Simcha I. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Pestell R. Ben-Ze'ev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5522-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 A). Mutation of the β-catenin/TCF element (−163FOP) reduced the ability of caveolin-1 to inhibit the cyclin D1 promoter from 80 to <50% (Fig. 4 D). Additional experiments were conducted comparing the effect of caveolin-1 with equal amounts of empty expression vector cassette (pCB7) at a reporter/expression vector ratio of 1:4 (n = 12). When normalized as paired experiments with the effect of the expression vector normalized to 100%, further experiments confirmed the trend of reduced repression by mutation of the TCF site (Fig. 4 D). These findings suggest that the TCF site is required for full repression of the cyclin D1 promoter by caveolin-1 and that additional elements may contribute to full repression. The TCF/LEF sequence in the cyclin D1 promoter is identical to the consensus TCF/LEF-1 site (40.Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J. Simcha I. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Pestell R. Ben-Ze'ev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5522-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar) and was sufficient for repression by caveolin-1 when it was linked to a minimal promoter (Fig.4 E). To determine the domains in caveolin-1 that are required for inhibition of the cyclin D1 promoter, various caveolin-1 mutants were assayed for their ability to inhibit a full-length cyclin D1 promoter-luciferase construct. These mutants have previously been shown to be expressed at equivalent levels to the wild-type caveolin-1 in cultured cells (37.Scherer P.S. Tang Z. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J.

Cav-1β-(32–178) repressed the cyclin D1 promoter to a similar extent as the full-length α-isoform (residues 1–178) (Fig. 5 A). Deletion of the caveolin-1 carboxyl terminus did not affect repression. In contrast, deletion of the N-terminal 95 residues (positions 96–178) not only abolished repression, but caused a modest induction of the cyclin D1 promoter. The abundance of the transfected ΔC and ΔN mutants was identical by Western blotting of cultured cells (48.Song K.S. Tang Z. Li S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4398-4403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), suggesting that loss of expression is not responsible for the failure of the ΔN mutant to repress the cyclin D1 promoter. Since deletion of the N-terminal residues 61–101 prevents caveolin-1 oligomerizationin vivo (48.Song K.S. Tang Z. Li S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4398-4403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and this domain is sufficient as a glutathioneS-transferase fusion for multimerization in vitro(44.Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z.-L. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar), we therefore determined whether oligomerization of caveolin-1 was required for repression of cyclin D1 promoter activity. Using the caveolin-1 N-terminal mutant Cav-1-(Δ61–101), we found that this mutant was capable of repressing cyclin D1 promoter activity to a similar extent as the α-isoform (Fig. 5 A). The C-terminal half of the oligomerization domain of caveolin binds to and regulates the activity of several signaling molecules in the Ras/ERK pathway (29.Engelman J.A. Chu C. Lin A. Jo H. Ikezu T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 30429-30438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). To determine further the possibility of whether ERK signaling is involved in the repression of the cyclin D1 promoter, we used a mutant caveolin-1 that is completely defective in inhibiting p42/p44 MAPK signaling (Cav-1-(1–81) (45.Schlegel A. Schwab R.B. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22660-22667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar)) and found that repression of the cyclin D1 promoter activity by this mutant was minimally affected (Fig.5 A). These results suggest that caveolin-1 oligomerization and inhibition of the ERK signaling pathway are not required for repression of the cyclin D1 promoter activity and that the region responsible for this activity resides between amino acids 32 and 60; thus, a unique domain is required for full repression of cyclin D1. Interestingly, this region is not conserved among the various caveolins (Fig. 5 B). The cyclin D1 gene encodes the regulatory subunit of the holoenzyme that phosphorylates and inactivates the pRB protein, thereby promoting entry into the DNA synthetic phase of the cell cycle (2.Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4311) Google Scholar). Antisense cyclin D1 inhibits S phase entry induced by serum, growth factors, or steroids and inhibits transformation by Ha-ras,src, and neu (3.Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Reutens A.T. Segall J.E.

Karnezis A. Bearss D.J. Webster M. Siegel P. Muller W.J. Windle J.J. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20448-20455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), whereas increasing the level of caveolin-1 levels can suppress the transformed phenotype (28.Galbiati F. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that cyclin D1 protein abundance and promoter activity were inhibited by overexpression of caveolin-1 protein. Caveolin-1 also inhibited the activity of thecdc25A promoter. The Cdc25A phosphatase dephosphorylates inhibitory phosphorylation sites on cyclin-dependent kinases (12.Jinno S. Suto K. Nagata A. Igarashi M. Kanaoka Y. Nojima H. Okayama H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1549-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 53.Galaktionov K. Lee A.K. Eckstein J. Draetta G. Meckler J. Loda M. Beach D. Science. 1995; 269: 1575-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), and overexpression of Cdc25A enhances transformation by oncogenic ras (53.Galaktionov K. Lee A.K. Eckstein J. Draetta G. Meckler J. Loda M. Beach D. Science. 1995; 269: 1575-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies demonstrate that the transcriptional activity of two major components of the cell cycle regulatory apparatus that governs DNA synthesis and cell transformation may be regulated by caveolin-1. Caveolin-interacting proteins include G-protein α-subunits, Ha-Ras, Src family tyrosine kinases, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase, epidermal growth factor receptor, and other related tyrosine kinases and protein kinase C isoforms (54.Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). The caveolin-1 mutants used in the present study suggest that repression of the cyclin D1 promoter activity most probably involves different domains of the caveolin-1 molecule than those required for regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling and formation of caveola structures. Three distinct caveolin genes have so far been identified (caveolin-1, -2, and -3), which can form homo- or hetero-oligomers (54.Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the loss of only caveolin-1, but not the other family members, was observed in tumors; and selective reduction of caveolin-1 levels, without affecting caveolin-2, was sufficient to drive transformation of NIH-3T3 cells (28.Galbiati F. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 30.Smart E.J. Graf G.A. McNiven M.A. Sessa W.C. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7289-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). The structural conservation is high among the three caveolar proteins, but divergence is displayed at the N terminus of these molecules (Fig. 5 B) (30.Smart E.J. Graf G.A. McNiven M.A. Sessa W.C. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7289-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). In agreement with this observation, caveolin-1, but not caveolin-3, was found to repress the cyclin D1 promoter. Caveolin oligomers directly bind cholesterol and interact with glycosphingolipids, enhancing the formation of the caveolar structures (55.Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E. Song K. Sanders M. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). A central hydrophobic domain (residues 102–134) forms a hairpin-like structure within the membrane, which positions both the N- and C-terminal domains of the molecule in the cytoplasm. Deletion of the C-terminal domain abrogates the interaction of homo-oligomers; this interaction contributes to the formation of the caveolin-rich scaffold (48.Song K.S. Tang Z. Li S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4398-4403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Similar to the effect observed by the α-isoform of caveolin-1, the C-terminal mutant (Cav-1ΔC) repressed the cyclin D1 promoter, suggesting that interaction of caveolin-1 homo-oligomers is apparently not required for cyclin D1 promoter inhibition. Deletion of the N-terminal 95 residues of the molecule abolished this repression of the cyclin D1 promoter by caveolin-1. The N terminus of caveolin-1 is involved in homo-oligomerization and interaction with the ERK signaling pathway (50.Couet J. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30429-30438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), but its deletion (Cav-1-(Δ61–101)) did not affect the magnitude of cyclin D1 promoter inhibition, supporting the view that formation of caveolin-containing structures is not necessary for cyclin D1 promoter repression. This study links, for the first time, the caveolin-1 protein with inhibition of the cell cycle regulatory apparatus involved in tumorigenesis. Cyclin D1 overexpression is known to induce mammary tumors in transgenic mice (56.Wang T.C. Cardiff R.D. Zukerberg L. Lees E. Arnold A. Schmidt E.V. Nature. 1994; 369: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar) and cooperates in oncogenic transformation with several oncogenes, including ras,myc, and E1A (57.Bodrug S.E. Warner B.J. Bath M.L. Lindeman G.J. Harris A.W. Adams J.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2124-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 58.Hinds P.W. Dowdy S.F. Eaton E.N. Arnold A. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cdc25A also cooperates in cell transformation with ras (53.Galaktionov K. Lee A.K. Eckstein J. Draetta G. Meckler J. Loda M. Beach D. Science. 1995; 269: 1575-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Since cyclin D1 is frequently overexpressed in a variety of human tumors (3.Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Reutens A.T. Segall J.E. Lee R.J. Arnold A. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 501-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and caveolin-1 abundance is reduced in many tumors (54.Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar), our studies point to the possibility that loss of caveolin-1 expression during tumorigenesis may lead to cellular proliferation through induction of the cyclin D1 gene. The cyclin D1 gene is induced by several signaling pathways implicated in cellular transformation, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, β-catenin/TCF/LEF, ERK, and nuclear factor-κB signaling pathways (40.Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J. Simcha I. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Pestell R. Ben-Ze'ev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5522-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar, 60.Guttridge D.C. Albanese C.

Chem. 1999; 274: 22033-22040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Examining the effect of caveolin-1 mutants on cyclin D1 promoter activity, we found that repression of the cyclin D1 promoter apparently does not involve the ERK pathway since an N-terminal caveolin-1 mutant incapable of inhibiting signaling by the Ras/ERK pathway (45.Schlegel A. Schwab R.B. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22660-22667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) could still repress cyclin D1 promoter activity. Thus, although the ERK pathway can activate cyclin D1 (19.Albanese C. Johnson J. Watanabe G. Eklund N. Vu D. Arnold A. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 35.Watanabe G. Lee R.J. Albanese C. Rainey W.E. Batlle D. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22570-22577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), a different pathway is most probably affected by caveolin-1. A mutation in the TCF/LEF site of the cyclin D1 promoter that abolished binding to TCF proteins in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (40.Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J. Simcha I. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Pestell R. Ben-Ze'ev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5522-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar) reduced repression by caveolin-1. Interestingly, we found that caveolin-1 also inhibited the activity of the c-junpromoter, a gene that is also activated by β-catenin/TCF signaling and that contains a TCF site in its promoter (62.Mann B. Gelos M. Siedow A. Hanski M.L. Gratchev A. Ilyas M. Bodmer W.F. Moyer M.P. Riecken E.O. Buhr H.J. Hanski C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1603-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). In contrast, the c-fos promoter, which is induced by ERK, was not significantly repressed by caveolin-1, further supporting the view that caveolin-1 repression of promoters in mammary epithelial cells involves a pathway that is distinct from the ERK pathway. Future studies will have to address the molecular mechanisms involved in the role of caveolin-1 in the regulation of the β-catenin/TCF/LEF signaling pathway."

Here we demonstrate that the stress signaling agents anisomycin, arsenite, and tumor necrosis factor-α stimulate the specific enzyme activity of CK2 in the human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells by up to 8-fold, and this could be blocked by the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580. We show that p38α MAP kinase, in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, can directly interact with the α and β subunits of CK2 to activate the holoenzyme through what appears to be an allosteric mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate that anisomycin- and tumor necrosis factor-α-induced phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-392, which is important for the transcriptional activity of this growth suppressor protein, requires p38 MAP kinase and CK2 activities.

While the increased expression of CK2 is linked with neoplastic transformation, little is known concerning acute regulation of this protein kinase. HeLa cells were grown at 37 °C on 125-cm2 flasks in M199 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For cell stimulation, HeLa cells were split at 2 × 106cells/10-cm2 dish 24 h prior to starvation. Cells were starved with 0.5% fetal calf serum for 15–20 h before exposure to stimuli. Starved cells were incubated with 10 μm SB203580 (Calbiochem) for 30 min prior to addition of 10 μg/ml anisomycin (Sigma) for 30 min, 50 μm arsenite (Sigma) for 15 min, or 20 ng/ml TNFα for 15 min. Adhering cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, then lysed in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 20 mm sodium fluoride in Buffer A (1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1% Nonidet P-40). Lysates were subjected to brief sonication for 2 × 10 s, centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatants were collected and stored frozen prior to use. Protein was determined by the method of Bradford (17.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. In some experiments, anisomycin-treated cells were lysed with ice-cold 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm ZnCl2, and 1% Nonidet P-40. After sonication for 2 × 10 s, the lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min and the supernatant was incubated with 0.5 units/μg alkaline phosphatase (Calbiochem) for 2 h at 37 °C. Ten volumes of ice-cold Buffer B (10 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate) were added and the sample was subjected to MonoQ anion-exchange chromatography. Cell lysates (2 mg protein) were diluted 1:10 in Buffer B and loaded onto a MonoQ (1 ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column at 4 °C. The anion-exchange column was eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient of 0–0.8 mNaCl in Buffer B and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Immunoprecipitations were performed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody for p38α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and a mouse monoclonal antibody for CK2β. Cell extracts (0.5 mg) were precleared by incubation for 1 h with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose, and then for 30 min with 20 μl of protein-A Sepharose that had been blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin. The precleared lysates were further incubated with 4 μg of the appropriate antibody and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose in the presence of 0.1% SDS for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl in Buffer A. CK2 activity following column chromatography was assayed when 5 μl of MonoQ fractions were incubated in a final volume of 25 μl with 5 μg of partially phosphorylated casein and 100 μm[γ-32P]ATP (2.5 μCi/assay) in Buffer C (12 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), and 15 mm MgCl2) for 10 or 15 min at 30 °C. These and other CK2 assays were performed in the absence and presence of either 20 μg/ml heparin (Sigma), 20 μm DRB (Sigma) or 20 μm SB203580 (CalBiochem). In cytosolic extracts, CK2 activity was assayed with 0.5 mm substrate peptide RRADDSDDDDD (Calbiochem). The phosphorylation of casein was quantitated by spotting 20 μl on to a 1.5-cm2 piece of Whatman P-81 phosphocellulose paper. The papers were washed extensively in 1% (w/v) phosphoric acid, transferred into 6-ml plastic vials containing 0.5 ml of Ecolume (ICN) scintillation fluid, and the incorporated radioactivity was measured in Wallac (LKB) scintillation counter. For immune complex kinase assays, immunoprecipitated beads were washed with Buffer C and incubated with 5 μg of casein in a final volume of 25 μl with 5 μCi of 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP in Buffer C for 10 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by either spotting 20 μl onto Whatman P-81 paper and the incorporated radioactivity was measured as described above, or by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (18.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar). After boiling, the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE for autoradiography with x-ray film or immunoblotting analysis. Western blotting was carried out with 0.1 to 1 μg/ml of the rabbit polyclonal antibodies: phospho-p38 (New England Biolabs), p38α (StressGen Biotechnologies), CK2α-III (19.Charlton L. Sanghera J.S. Clark-Lewis I. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8840-8845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), CK2β (Kinetek Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), and phospho-p53 Ser-392 (New England Biolabs). Recombinant CK2 holoenzyme (Calbiochem) (1 μg) was incubated with 250 ng of the wild-type glutathione S-transferase (GST)-p38α or wild-type GST-Erk1 (Kinetek Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) in a final volume of 25 μl with 10 μCi of 100 μm[γ-32P]ATP in Buffer C for 15 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (18.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar). After SDS-PAGE, radioactivity incorporated into CK2 was detected by autoradiography. Either 2 μg of recombinant CK2 holoenzyme, CK2α or CK2β (Calbiochem) were mixed with 400 ng of GST-p38, GST, or GST-Erk1. The recombinant proteins were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in Buffer D (12.5 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 7.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm sodium fluoride), and the GST was captured by addition of 25 μl of a 1:1 slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for another hour at 4 °C. In some experiments, 20 μm SB203580, 20 μg/ml heparin, or 20 μm DRB was incubated with the GST-p38α or the recombinant CK2 for 15 min at 30 °C prior to the addition of the recombinant CK2 or GST-p38, respectively. The beads were washed 3 times with Buffer D containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and the bound proteins were eluted by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After boiling, the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 12% acrylamide gels and immunoblotted with either CK2α-III (19.Charlton L. Sanghera J.S. Clark-Lewis I. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8840-8845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or CK2β antibodies. To explore the role of stress stimuli in the regulation of CK2, we investigated the effect of a 30-min treatment of serum-deprived HeLa cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin. The casein phosphotransferase activity of CK2 was assessed following MonoQ fast protein liquid chromatography of the cell lysates. Anisomycin treatment caused an 8-fold activation of CK2, which eluted with 0.6 mNaCl in primarily fraction numbers 18 and 19 (Fig.1 A). This was confirmed by the sensitivity of the casein phosphotransferase activity peak to the CK2 inhibitor heparin (Fig. 1 A), and the elution of the α, α′, and β subunits of CK2 in these MonoQ fractions as revealed by immunoblotting analysis (Fig. 2,A and D). Exposure of the serum-starved cells to the mitochondrial oxidation inhibitor arsenite or the inflammatory cytokine TNF-α for 15 min was also observed to stimulate CK2 activity by 3–4-fold (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, using a highly specific CK2 substrate peptide (RRADDSDDDDD), cytosolic extracts from HeLa cells treated with arsenite or anisomycin, respectively, contained 6.33 ± 0.06 and 7.44 ± 0.03 (mean ± S.E., n = 3) fold more phosphotransferase activity than was detectable with cytosol from non-treated cells (data not shown).Figure 2Phosphorylated and active p38 MAP kinase coelutes with CK2 from MonoQ. Following MonoQ fractionation of lysates from untreated (A, D, and G) HeLa cells or those exposed to anisomycin in the absence (B, E, andJ) and presence of 10 μm SB203580 (C, F, and I), there were no detectable changes in the distribution or amount of immunoreactive CK2 α- (A toC) and β-subunits (D to F). p38 eluted principally in the wash-through and CK2-containing fractions. Following anisomycin (10 μg/ml for 30 min) treatment of cells, the amount of p38 associated with CK2 was increased (H) as compared with untreated cells (G) or 10 μmSB203580-pretreated cells subsequently exposed to anisomycin (I).

Wilson S. Belham C.M. Robinson C.J.M. Scott M.H. Gould G.W. Plevin R. Cell Signal. 1997; 9: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). To assess whether a p38 MAP kinase mediated stress factor-induced activation of CK2, we took advantage of the specific p38 inhibitor SB203580 (21.Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F.

Treatment of the serum-deprived HeLa cells with SB203580 for 30 min prior to their exposure to anisomycin, arsenite, or TNFα abrogated the ability of each of these agents to stimulate CK2 (Fig. 1, A and B). As the anisomycin treatment consistently elicited the most striking activation of CK2, we exploited this agent to further explore the mechanism for the CK2 stimulation. There were no differences in the intensity of immunostaining of the α, α39, and β subunits of CK2 in serum-deprived anisomycin and SB203580-treated cells (Fig. 2, A-F). Consequently, the anisomycin appeared to increase the specific enzyme activity of CK2 without alteration of the α, α39/β subunit ratio or the total amount of CK2 protein. There were also no apparent reductions in the mobilities of the CK2 subunits following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the MonoQ-fractionated lysates from cells exposed to anisomycin. Such retardation of CK2 subunits usually reflects their increased phosphorylation. CK2 subunits have been reported to interact with many other proteins (4.Guerra B. Issinger O.J. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 391-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), including the protein kinases Mos, RafA, and Rsk, which bind to CK2β (25.Bozzetti M.P. Massari S. Finelli P. Meggio F.

Biochem. 1999; 191: 51-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether a p38 MAP kinase might directly associate with CK2. The peak of immunoreactivity of the α-isoform of p38 was found to coelute with CK2 following MonoQ fractionation, and this was most pronounced in lysates from anisomycin-treated cells (Fig. 2, G and H). By contrast, the amount of p38α coeluting with CK2 was substantially reduced in extracts from cells treated with both anisomycin and SB203580, and a large portion of the MAP kinase failed to bind to the MonoQ column and eluted in wash-through fractions 4–7 (Fig.2 I). An even more dramatic redistribution of p38α away from CK2 was produced when the lysates from cells exposed to anisomycin were incubated with alkaline phosphatase to dephosphorylate the p38α prior to MonoQ chromatography (Fig. 2 J). CK2 subunits were not detectable by immunoblotting in MonoQ fractions 4–7 neither before nor after alkaline phosphatase treatment. Furthermore, the alkaline phosphatase treatment abolished the anisomycin-induced activation of CK2 (data not shown). An implication of these experiments was that p38α MAP kinase must be in an active conformation in order to maximally bind and activate CK2. While the preceding data for CK2 and p38α residing in a common complex was only correlative, direct evidence was obtained through coimmunoprecipitation studies. The p38α antibody was used to immunoprecipitate equivalent amounts of p38α from lysates of serum-deprived, anisomycin-, and SB203580 + anisomycin-treated cells (Fig. 3 B). The casein phosphotransferase activity was approximately 4-fold higher in the immunocomplexes from anisomycin-treated as compared with untreated cells, and this was reduced to less than a 2-fold stimulation by the SB203580 (Fig. 3 A). These immunocomplexes with p38α antibody were shown to contain both the α and β subunits of CK2 by immunoblotting, and their presence was increased in the immunocomplexes from anisomycin-treated cells (Fig. 3, C and D). Reciprocally, in immunocomplexes obtained with an antibody specific for CK2β, p38α was largely immunodetected in samples from anisomycin-treated cells, with little if any evident in immunocomplexes from serum-starved or SB203580 + anisomycin-treated cells (Fig.3 E). Further support for the direct interaction of CK2 and p38α was obtained through the use of recombinant CK2 and partially active p38α expressed as a GST fusion protein. GST-p38 displayed binding for both α and β subunits of CK2 when they were expressed separately (data not shown). Therefore p38 can interact with both CK2 subunits independently. The interaction of CK2 for GST-p38α was specific, since no binding of CK2α was detected when either GST or GST fused to the MAP kinase Erk1 was substituted for GST-p38α (Fig.4 C). GST-p38 stimulated the casein phosphotransferase activity of recombinant CK2 by 2-fold, and this was sensitive to SB203580 and the CK2 inhibitors heparin and 5,6-dichloro-ribifuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) (Fig. 4 A). When the CK2·GST-p38α complex immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP, there was strong phosphorylation of the β-subunit of CK2 (Fig. 4 B), but not the α-subunit of CK2 (data not shown). This phosphorylation was abolished when the incubations with [γ-32P]ATP were carried out with SB203580, DRB, or heparin. When the presence of CK2α was ascertained by immunoblotting, the DRB and heparin did not dissociate the CK2·GST-p38α complex, whereas SB203580 did (Fig.4 C). These findings indicated that the radiolabeling of CK2β in the presence of GST-p38 was largely due to autophosphorylation, apparently from the stimulation of CK2 catalytic activity. This was further supported by experiments in which the CK2 was preincubated with unlabeled ATP for 15 min to saturate the autophosphorylation sites, and then with [γ-32P]ATP in the absence and presence of GST-p38α for an additional 10 min. Under these circumstances, there was no enhanced incorporation of radioactivity into the α and β subunits of CK2 with the addition of GST-p38α (data not shown). Collectively, our results support a model in which phosphorylated p38α is able to engage CK2 in a complex through direct interaction with both the α and β subunits of CK2. It would appear that an active conformation of p38α is needed for binding, since the SB203580 prevented complex formation. Through an allosteric effect exerted by active p38α, CK2 may become stimulated to phosphorylate other targets. It is unclear if the increased autophosphorylation of CK2 may be sufficient to preserve the state of activation of CK2 after p38α is dissociated. The ability of 4-fold lower levels of p38α to activate CK2 in vitro is consistent with this possibility. The functional consequences of the stress activating of CK2 may include activation of the p53 growth suppressor protein. Phosphorylation at Ser-392 in human p53 (equivalent to Ser-389 in murine p53) is known to increase its DNA binding ability and transcriptional activity (29.Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Curr.

Furthermore, p38 could be co-immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with p53 by using antibodies against p53 (32.Huang C. Ma W.-Y. Maxiner A. Sun Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12229-12235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). But Kraiss et al. (33.Kraiss S. Barnekow A. Montenarh M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 845-855PubMed Google Scholar) have found that CK2 is also co-immunoprecipitated with p53. Our experiments support a model in which a p38·CK2 complex binds to p53, and the direct phosphorylation of Ser-389 in response to UV radiation is catalyzed by CK2. To test the hypothesis that the p53 is a downstream target of the stress stimuli anisomycin, arsenite, and TNFα, we performed immunoblotting studies of lysates from HeLa cells that had been treated with these factors using a p53 Ser-392 phosphorylation site-specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 5, the treatment of serum-deprived HeLa cells with any of these agents enhanced the phosphorylation of p53 at this site. The phosphorylation of p53 in response to anisomycin and TNFα, but not arsenite, was markedly attenuated by either DRB or SB203580. This indicated that the phosphorylation of p53 at an activating site in response to anisomycin or TNFα was mediated by p38 MAP kinase and CK2. In the case of arsenite, there may be an alternative pathway, in addition to the p38 MAP kinase-CK2 route, by which p53 can be phosphorylated at the Ser-392 site. The implication of CK2 in mediation of stress signaling downstream of p38 MAP kinase is a surprising outcome of our study. Our findings underline the importance of phosphatase inhibitors to preserve the state of CK2 activation and the potential influence of agents that are commonly used to inhibit cellular processes (e.g. protein synthesis, mitochondrial function, and cell cycle progression) in order to study the regulation and role of CK2."

We have further suggested that the equilibria between SNO-Hb and iron nitrosylhemoglobin, on the one hand (Equation 1), and GSNO, on the other hand (Equation 4), have important functional implications for the regulation of blood flow and platelet activity (5.Stamler J.S.

In support of this contention, we have shown both in vitro and in vivo that SNO-Hb dilates blood vessels (1.Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S.

Circulation. 1998; 97: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) under conditions that promote its T structure, but not under conditions that promote its R structure. Moreover, we have shown that SNO-Hb bioactivity is promoted by low pO2, thiols, and heme oxidation (1.Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S.

The vasodilator and antiplatelet activities of SNO-Hb and promoting role of exogenous thiols have recently been confirmed by others (23.Wolzt M. MacAllister R.J. Davis D. Feelisch M. Moncada S.

Kitabatake A. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1999; 167: 12-16Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that SNO-Hb can sense the physiological O2 gradient in resistance vessels (small arterioles that control blood flow), thereby coupling the release of vasodilator SNO with regional metabolic needs of the tissue (5.Stamler J.S.

Additional work that supports the importance of SNO-Hb includes the myriad studies of the systemic effects of inhaled NO (25.Troncy E. Francoeur M Salazkin I. Yang F. Charbonneau M. Leclerc G.

Conway D.A Hrinczenko B.W. Nichols J.S. Pease-Fye M.E. Noguchi C.T. Rodgers G.P. Ognibene F.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 937-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It is tempting to suggest, moreover, that the hypoxia-increased tissue levels of NO in kidneys of animals that had been treated with NO synthase inhibitors (30.Heyman S.N. Goldfarb M. Darmon D. Brezis M. Microcirculation. 1999; 6: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) implicate SNO-Hb as the source of the elevated NO. The levels of SNO-Hb in arterial blood are ∼1 μm. Release of such an amount of SNO (from Hb) during each arterial-venous cycle would not, however, be compatible with life or NO biology for two reasons. First, it would cause life-threatening hypotension and shunting of blood. This effect can be understood by appreciating that regulation of blood flow, which is a function of arteriolar diameter to the fourth power (31.Guyton A.C. Textbook of Medical Physiology. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1981: 53-54Google Scholar), requires only low nanomolar SNO (1.Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar, 5.Stamler J.S. Jia L. Eu J.P. McMahon T.J. Demchenko I.T. Bonaventura J. Gernert K. Piantadosi C.A.

Res. 1994; 28: 691-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Second, it would impose an insurmountable metabolic burden on an organism that produces less NO, in toto (35.Castillo L. Beaumier L. Ajami A.M. Young V.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11460-11465Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), than the amount that would be turned over by Hb alone (6.Gow A.J. Luchsinger B.P. Pawloski J.R. Singel D.J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9027-9032Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Only a small fraction (0.1–1%) of SNO bound to hemoglobin is involved in signaling during arterial-venous transit to regulate blood flow (1.Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar, 5.Stamler J.S. Jia L. Eu J.P. McMahon T.J. Demchenko I.T. Bonaventura J. Gernert K. Piantadosi C.A. Science. 1997; 276: 2034-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). The NO unit is thus quantitatively and functionally dissimilar from O2. Whereas millimolar O2 is delivered by Hb to meet basal metabolic requirements, NO/SNO functions as a signal that is dispensed at nanomolar concentrations. The fundamental challenge to our understanding of SNO-Hb function is therefore not whether enough SNO can be released to dilate blood vessels, as recently questioned by some (23.Wolzt M.

Curry S.R. Vali R.J. Fattor T.J. Olson J.S. Lemon D.D. Nature Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), but rather how red blood cells are able to conserve the vast majority of SNO when their Hb is routinely exposed to hypoxic tissue and to ambient intracellular glutathione. We have previously suggested that part of the solution lies in the autocapture by hemes of the NO released from the thiols in Hb (1.Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar, 2.Gow A.J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1998; 391: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 6.Gow A.J. Luchsinger B.P.

In this study, we report on the functional behavior of (SNO)2-Hb((Fe(II))O2)4 (here called SNO-Hb) and on the allosteric mechanisms that regulate NO group release from this molecule. We show that 1) NO group release from SNO-Hb is favored in the T structure, thus conforming to principles of thermodynamic linkage; 2) as with other S-nitrosothiols, vasorelaxation by SNO-Hb is not mediated by free NO (as recently misapprehended (23.Wolzt M. MacAllister R.J. Davis D. Feelisch M. Moncada S. Vallance P. Hobbs A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28983-28990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar)); and 3) by stabilizing thiol-bound NO in the R structure and autocapturing a significant fraction of NO released upon transition to T structure, Hb can conserve NO that would otherwise be released in an untimely, nonspecific, deleterious, or prodigal manner. Chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma, except where otherwise stated. Human hemoglobin (HbA0; Apex Bioscience, NC) was purified (>99%) from outdated human blood as described previously (1.Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar, 7.McMahon T.J. Stamler J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 301: 99-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The buffer used in the final chromatographic purification process was lactated Ringer's solution, pH 7.40. Unless otherwise stated, working solutions of HbA0 were prepared by rapid centrifugation over a Sephadex G-25 chromatography column (20-fold volume excess) equilibrated with PBS, pH 7.40, containing 0.5 mm EDTA. Hb was dialyzed against 2% aerated borate, pH 9.20, containing 0.5 mm EDTA. S-Nitrosocysteine (0.5 m) was prepared immediately before use by reacting 1 mNaNO2 in H2O with 1 ml-Cys hydrochloride dissolved in 0.5 n HCl and 0.5 mm EDTA. S-Nitrosocysteine was partially neutralized prior to addition to the hemoglobin solution by dilution in PBS, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mm EDTA (7.McMahon T.J. Stamler J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 301: 99-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Hb wasS-nitrosylated by incubation at room temperature with 10-fold molar excess S-nitrosocysteine; the extent ofS-nitrosylation was determined by the duration of incubation. The reaction was stopped by rapid transfer of the mixture to a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with PBS, pH 7.40, containing 0.5 mm EDTA. Human HbA0 contains three pairs of cysteine residues: Cysβ93, Cysβ112, and Cysα104. Mass spectroscopic analysis of the product formed under study conditions revealed that only Cysβ93is nitrosylated (data not shown) (16.Gladwin M.T. Schechter A.N. Shelhamer J.H. Pannell L.K. Conway D.A Hrinczenko B.W. Nichols J.S. Pease-Fye M.E. Noguchi C.T. Rodgers G.P. Ognibene F.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 937-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 19.Ferranti P. Malorni A. Mamone G. Sannolo N. Marino G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). SNO-Hb samples were made fresh on the day of an experiment, kept on ice, and protected from light. The SNO yield was determined by the Saville method in aliquots from SNO-Hb solutions used for functional studies (1.Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar). SNO content is expressed as a ratio normalized to the spectrophotometrically determined tetrameric Hb concentration. Tetrameric Hb or SNO-Hb concentration was adjusted to 15 μm by dilution in PBS, pH 7.40, except where otherwise stated. Some binding study results were confirmed at 50 μm in order to check for effects of dimer/tetramer equilibrium (38.Imai K. Yonetani T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 490: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 39.Yonetani T. Tsuneshige A. Zhou Y. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20323-20333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). SNO-Hb or Hb(Fe(II))O2 was diluted as described above to 15 or 50 μm final tetrameric concentration and added to a sealed glass tonometer fitted with a cuvette. A base-line visible (500–700 nm) spectrophotometric scan in the oxygenated state was obtained (Perkin-Elmer, Beaconsfield, United Kingdom). Rigorous deoxygenation was accomplished through several cycles of alternately flushing with ultra-high purity argon gas and applying a measured vacuum. The tonometer was mechanically rotated for 7 min in a 20 °C water bath, and a spectrum was obtained. A second round of deoxygenation was performed to verify the completeness of conversion to deoxy-Hb and its stability. An airtight syringe (Hamilton, Ontario, Canada) was then used to incrementally deliver measured volumes of room air into the tonometer through a rubber septum. Following each injection, the tonometer was rotated in a temperature-controlled (20 °C) water bath for 7 min to allow equilibration between the head space (∼300 ml) and the Hb solution (3 ml), and then a visible spectrum was obtained. Injections of air were repeated until a fully oxygenated spectrum was observed. The tonometer pO2 resulting with each injection was calculated, taking into account the cumulative volume injected, the tonometer volume, the measured barometric pressure, the ambient room temperature, the water bath (tonometer) temperature, and the relative humidity. The fractional O2 saturation at each step was calculated based on a mean of the change in absorbance at each of three characteristic wavelengths (542, 555, and 577 nm) relative to the respective absorbances of the fully oxygenated and fully deoxygenated species studied in the first two and the last steps of the experiment. Fractional O2 saturation (Y) or log[Y/(1 − Y)] (Hill plot) was plotted as a function of the logarithm of pO2, except where otherwise stated. Spectral decomposition procedures using extinction coefficient spectra obtained from standard synthetic solutions of pure Hb(Fe(II))NO, MetHb, Hb(Fe(II))O2, and deoxy-Hb were used to determine the fractional content of MetHb and Hb(Fe(II))NO (6.Gow A.J. Luchsinger B.P. Pawloski J.R. Singel D.J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9027-9032Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In addition, Hb(Fe(II))NO and SNO-Hb were measured by the photolysis-chemiluminescence method (7.McMahon T.J. Stamler J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 301: 99-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). SNO-Hb and Hb solutions at varying pH were prepared by dilution in PBS solutions pre-titrated to the specified pH with either NaOH or HCl. In the case of the acidification of PBS to achieve pH 6.80, the added concentration of chloride ion (an allosteric effector) was <1.0% of the total anion concentration of PBS maintained at pH 7.40. Hb or SNO-Hb prepared as described above was diluted in PBS solutions (pH 7.40) of monobasic and dibasic sodium phosphate calculated to yield a final PO43− concentration of either 10 or 100 mm. The change in anion concentration (specifically [Cl−]) with pH adjustment of these solutions was estimated to be negligible. Inositol hexaphosphate (150 μm), 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (150 μm), or β-NADPH (Calbiochem) was dissolved in Hepes and adjusted to the specified pH before the addition of Hb/SNO-Hb. The O2 equilibria of SNO-Hb (1.8 SNO/tetramer) were compared in the presence and absence of varying concentrations of GSH to test the ability of a thiol acceptor to facilitate denitrosylation of SNO-Hb and, consequently, the offloading of O2 as a function of the O2-linked allosteric transition in Hb. In experiments in which GSH was present, the oxidation of hemes routinely observed with the oxygenation-deoxygenation process was accelerated. The formation of MetHb was minimized by using purified stroma-free Hb (PSF-Hb), a partially purified hemolysate containing physiological levels of catalase, superoxide dismutase, methemoglobin reductase, and HbA0. The hemolysates were stripped of phosphates and studied in Hepes containing 5 mm NADPH (naturally present in the red blood cell), included to provide reducing equivalents, but also functioning as an allosteric effector of the organic phosphate class (40.Cashon R. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Focesi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12700-12705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Ogo S. Focesi Jr., A. Cashon R. Bonaventura J. Bonaventura C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11302-11306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thoracic aortic rings were harvested from New Zealand White rabbits as described previously (5.Stamler J.S. Jia L. Eu J.P. McMahon T.J. Demchenko I.T. Bonaventura J. Gernert K. Piantadosi C.A. Science. 1997; 276: 2034-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). The rings were mounted on stirrups in tissue baths filled with Krebs-Henseleit buffer, pH 7.40 (no chelating agent), bubbled with either 21% O2, 5% CO2, and balance N2(“normoxia”) or 5% CO2 and balance N2(“hypoxia”; <1% O2), and maintained at 37 °C. This buffer contains ∼125 mm Cl− and ∼1 mm PO43−. Changes in isometric tension were measured and recorded with Statham pressure transducers and a Grass polygraph. Phenylephrine was added to the tissue baths in concentrations sufficient to elicit an active basal tension of ∼2 g. Tension was equally maintained in normoxia and hypoxia by adjusting the dose of phenylephrine. Under typical bioassay conditions (<50 μm Hb, 95% O2), tetrameric hemoglobin will dissociate into dimers, a fundamental problem that NO pharmacologists have not previously considered. Because dimers do not transition to T structure, the allosteric effect of hypoxia cannot be tested. To adequately limit dimerization with dilute solutions of cell-free Hb in bioassays (38.Imai K. Yonetani T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 490: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we have found it necessary to work at ≤1% O2, a level much lower than that used by Wolztet al. (23.Wolzt M. MacAllister R.J. Davis D. Feelisch M. Moncada S. Vallance P. Hobbs A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28983-28990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) to assess the allosteric transition. The functional integrity of the endothelium was confirmed in each vessel ring studied by demonstrating vasodilator responses to acetylcholine. In some experiments, reduced GSH dissolved in PBS, pH 7.40, was added to tissue baths 15 min prior to the administration of SNO-Hb. Responses to SNO-Hb are expressed as the percent change from the initial tension achieved with phenylephrine. Statistical testing for differences was by analysis of variance for repeated measures or by the pairedt test, with p < 0.05 accepted as the criterion for statistical significance. The influence of the extent of S-nitrosylation of Hb on O2 affinity in SNO-Hb was studied in O2-binding experiments using solutions of Hb S-nitrosylated to varying degrees. As outlined above, the extent of Hb S-nitrosylation was varied by arresting the incubation of Hb withS-nitrosocysteine at predetermined points in time. The O2-binding curve for SNO-Hb was shifted leftward relative to that of HbA0 (Fig.1 A). When expressed in the form of the Hill plot (log pO2 versuslog[Y/(1 − Y)], where Y is the fractional O2 saturation), it becomes clear that the leftward shift for SNO-Hb is asymmetric in that differences in affinity are most pronounced at low pO2 values (Fig.1 B). Accordingly, the n 50 (the slope of the Hill plot at half-maximal O2 saturation, a measure of cooperativity) is lower in SNO-Hb than in HbA0 (TableI). Oxygen affinity rises (andP 50 decreases) as a function of SNO content across the full range from 0 to (the maximal) 2 SNO groups/Hb tetramer (Fig. 1 C), in contrast to the findings of Patel et al. (36.Patel R.P. Hogg N. Spencer N.Y. Kalyanaraman B. Matalon S. Darley-Usmar V.D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15487-15492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and in agreement with those of Bonaventura et al. (42.Bonaventura C. Ferruzi G. Te"
https://openalex.org/W2032474685,"Chromosomal translocations in human lipomas frequently create fusion transcripts encoding high mobility group (HMG) I-C DNA-binding domains and C-terminal sequences from different presumed transcription factors, suggesting a potential role for HMG I-C in the development of lipomas. To evaluate the role of the HMG I-C component, the three DNA-binding domains of HMG I-C have now been expressed in transgenic mice. Despite the ubiquitous expression of the truncated HMG I-C protein, the transgenic mice develop a selective abundance of fat tissue early in life, show marked adipose tissue inflammation, and have an abnormally high incidence of lipomas. These findings demonstrate that the DNA-binding domains of HMG I-C, in the absence of a C-terminal fusion partner, are sufficient to perturb adipogenesis and predispose to lipomas. We provide data supporting the central utility of this animal model as a tool to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of one of the most common kind of human benign tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2027117246,"Seeds from the legume tree Maackia amurensis contain two lectins that can agglutinate different blood cell types. Their specificity toward sialylated oligosaccharides is unique among legume lectins; the leukoagglutinin preferentially binds to sialyllactosamine (alphaNeuAc(2-3)betaGal(1-4)betaGlcNAc), whereas the hemagglutinin displays higher affinity for a disialylated tetrasaccharide (alphaNeuAc(2-3)betaGal(1-3)[alphaNeuAc(2-6)]alphaG alNAc). The three-dimensional structure of the complex between M. amurensis leukoagglutinin and sialyllactose has been determined at 2.75-A resolution using x-ray crystallography. The carbohydrate binding site consists of a deep cleft that accommodates the three carbohydrate residues of the sialyllactose. The central galactose sits in the primary binding site in an orientation that has not been observed previously in other legume lectins. The carboxyl group of sialic acid establishes a salt bridge with a lysine side chain. The glucose residue is very efficiently docked between two tyrosine aromatic rings. The complex between M. amurensis hemagglutinin and a disialylated tetrasaccharide could be modeled from the leukoagglutinin/sialyllactose crystal structure. The substitution of one tyrosine by an alanine residue is responsible for the difference in fine specificity between the two isolectins. Comparison with other legume lectins indicates that oligosaccharide specificity within this family is achieved by the recycling of structural loops in different combinations."

In the last few years, the dystrophin-associated protein complex proteins have been isolated; their genes have been cloned; and the following model of the complex has been hypothesized (3.Ervasti J.M.

Its actinin-like N terminus binds F-actin (6.Koenig M. Monaco A.P. Kunkel L.M. Cell. 1988; 53: 219-226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar), whereas its C terminus is anchored to the transmembrane protein, β-dystroglycan, which is linked through α-dystroglycan to the extracellular merosin (laminin-2) (7.Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O.

Then, this complex bridges the muscle membrane from the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. In addition, dystroglycan is the receptor for agrin, a protein with a pivotal role in the clustering of acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction (8.Campanelli J.T. Roberds S.L.

The three known syntrophin isoforms, α1, β1, and β2, are encoded by distinct genes with specific expression (33.Ahn A.H. Freener C.A. Gussoni E. Yoshida M. Ozawa E. Kunkel L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2724-2730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). α1-Syntrophin is most abundant in skeletal muscle, where it is located close to the sarcolemma together with β1-syntrophin. In contrast, β2-syntrophin is largely concentrated at the neuromuscular junction, but is barely detectable at the sarcolemma. Syntrophins bind directly to the C-terminal domain of dystrophin, in the region encoded by exons 74 and 75 (34.Ahn A.H. Kunkel L.M. J.

Each syntrophin has a characteristic domain organization in mammals (human, mouse, rabbit) as well as in the genetically distantTorpedo californica. Two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains and one PDZ domain are constantly present (46.Shaw G. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 47.Ponting C.P. Phillips C. Davies K.E. Blake D.J. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), with the first PH domain split into two regions (PH1a and PH1b) by the PDZ domain and its flanking regions. In addition, another region has been recognized in the C-terminal 57 amino acids and termed the syntrophin unique (SU) domain (32.Adams M.E. Dwyer T.M. Dowler L.L. White R.A. Froehner S.C. J. Biol.

Here, we report the identification, through expressed sequence tag (EST) data base searching and cDNA library screening, of two novel human genes belonging to the syntrophin family. Approximately 500,000 plaques from a human fetal brain cDNA library in the λgt10 vector (CLONTECH) and the NT2 neuronal precursor cell cDNA library in the Uni-ZAP XR vector (Stratagene) were screened using EST clones 49263 and c-1gb01 (IMAGE Consortium) according to standard procedures (48.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1–3. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). Sixteen positive clones (eight for each probe) were isolated. The open reading frames of γ1- and γ2-syntrophins were sequenced in at least two independent clones. Human total RNA and rat poly(A) RNA Northern blots were purchased from CLONTECH and Origene, respectively, and hybridized according to standard procedures (48.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1–3. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). The 701- and 432-bp rat cDNA fragments, used as probes for γ1- and γ2-syntrophins, were obtained by RT-PCR using human-specific primer pairs. All PCR amplifications were performed in a PTC-100 thermal cycler (MJ Research, Inc.) as described previously (18.Nigro V. Piluso G. Belsito A. Politano L. Puca A.A. Papparella S. Rossi E. Viglietto G. Esposito M.G. Abbondanza C. Medici N. Molinari A.M. Nigro G. Puca G.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1179-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignment of proteins was realized using the CLUSTAL W1.7 program with default parameters (49.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55399) Google Scholar). The alignment data were also utilized to obtain a phylogenetic tree of proteins. A prevision of secondary structure was obtained using the PHDsec algorithm (50.Rost B. Sander C. Schneider R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 53-60PubMed Google Scholar). To search domains or functional sites in the sequences, we scanned PROFILE and PROSITE data bases using the ISREC web site. The cDNAs encoding γ1-syntrophin (amino acids 195–302) and γ2-syntrophin (amino acids 209–299) as well as the corresponding regions of α1-syntrophin (amino acids 173–505), β1-syntrophin (amino acids 205–351), and β2-syntrophin (amino acids 193–357) were cloned in frame with GST into the pGEX-2TK vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), introduced into Escherichia coli JM109 cells, and induced using standard procedures. The GST fusion proteins used in rabbit polyclonal antibody production (GST-γ1-syntrophin and GST-γ2-syntrophin) were purified using a continuous elution SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis apparatus (Model 491 Prep Cell, Bio-Rad), digested with thrombin protease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and reloaded on the apparatus to separate GST from peptide. Protein concentration was determined (Bio-Rad protein assay). For GST pull-down assay, cDNAs encoding dystrophin (amino acids 3194–3685), α-dystrobrevin (amino acids 422–564), and β-dystrobrevin (amino acids 444–606) were cloned in frame with GST into the pGEX-2TK vector and introduced into E. coli JM109 cells. Twenty-ml overnight cultures were diluted 1:10 with LB medium supplemented with 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 20 mm glucose. After induction with 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in a 0.02 initial volume with 50 mmglucose, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA, and 10 mg/ml lysozyme. After incubation for 10 min at room temperature (all following steps were carried out at 4 °C or on ice), an equal volume of 2× lysis buffer (final concentration: 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors) was added, and cells were fractured with repeated cycles of freezing-thawing. The protein extract was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min and incubated with 100 μl of a 50% slurry of glutathione-agarose CL-4B (Fluka) for 2 h with shaking. After extensive washing in PBS supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitors, GST-dystrophin/dystrobrevin bead-bound fusion proteins was utilized in assay. Anti-γ1- and anti-γ2-syntrophin antibodies were generated by subcutaneous injection of New Zealand White rabbits with 100 μg of purified γ1-syntrophin-(195–302) and γ2-syntrophin-(209–299) peptides, respectively, using the immunization protocol previously described (18.Nigro V. Piluso G. Belsito A. Politano L. Puca A.A. Papparella S. Rossi E. Viglietto G. Esposito M.G. Abbondanza C. Medici N. Molinari A.M. Nigro G. Puca G.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1179-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The antiserum titer (1:60,000 and 1:80,000, respectively) was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and specificity was verified by Western blotting. Both antisera were affinity-purified on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) blocked with purified GST-γ1-syntrophin-(195–302) and GST-γ2-syntrophin-(209–299) fusion proteins, respectively. Cyclic incubations of antiserum were followed by elution of affinity-purified antibodies with 100 mm glycine (pH 2.7), neutralized with Tris base at a final concentration of 25 mm at pH 7.8. For anti-γ1-syntrophin antiserum, a very weak cross-reactivity with α1-syntrophin was eliminated by preincubation on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane blocked with purified GST-α1-syntrophin-(173–505) fusion protein. Affinity-purified antibodies were concentrated using an Ultrafree-CL unit (M r cutoff = 100,000; Millipore Corp.), supplemented with 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.5% NaN3, and stored at 4 °C. Samples were run on 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose sheets. Membranes were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies diluted 1:1000 in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 200 mm NaCl) with 0.5% nonfat milk, 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40. After washing, membranes were incubated for 1 h with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG diluted 1:10,000 in Tris-buffered saline with 0.5% nonfat milk, 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by ECL according to the specifications of the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The C terminus of dystrophin (amino acids 3194–3685) and regions of α-dystrobrevin (amino acids 422–564) and β-dystrobrevin (amino acids 444–606) were cloned in frame with the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 into the pGBT9 plasmid (pGBT9-DYS, pGBT9-DTNA, and pGBT9-DTNB, respectively), whereas γ1-syntrophin (amino acids 19–517) and γ2-syntrophin (amino acids 1–539) were cloned in frame with the activating domain of GAL4 into the pGAD424 plasmid (pGAD-G1SYN and pGAD-G2SYN, respectively) (CLONTECH). For γ1-syntrophin, a plasmid in which exon 18 is deleted (pGAD-G1SYNΔ18) was also utilized. In addition, human α1-syntrophin (amino acids 173–505; pGAD-A1SYN) was utilized as a positive control for the interaction with dystrophin and related proteins. The p53 and pSV40 control plasmids were supplied with a kit. The pGBT9-DYS, pGBT9-DTNA, and pGBT9-DTNB plasmids were cotransformed in the YRG-2 yeast strain, containing two Gal4-inducible reporter genes, HIS3 and lacZ, with pGAD-G1SYN, pGAD-G1SYNΔ18, pGAD-G2SYN, or pGAD-A1SYN according to the specifications of the manufacturer (CLONTECH). The double transformants were plated onto selective plates lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine to show the activation of the Gal4-inducible HIS3 reporter gene through protein-protein interaction. Positive clones were also replica-plated on selective medium and tested for β-galactosidase activity using the colony lift assay following the directions supplied with the kit obtained fromCLONTECH to confirm the interaction through the activation of the second Gal4-inducible reporter gene,lacZ. Full-length γ1- and γ2-syntrophins were cloned into the pCT expression vector under the cytomegalovirus promoter and transiently transfected into COS-7 cells by electroporation. After 48–72 h, the cells were washed in PBS, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors), and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with shaking. The protein extract was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Then, 100 μl of extract was incubated with 25 μl of GST-dystrophin/dystrobrevin bead-bound fusion proteins and GST-alone bead-bound fusion protein overnight at 4 °C with shaking. After extensive washing with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors, 25 μl of sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 8m urea, 4% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.001% bromphenol blue) was added to the beads. After boiling, samples were run on 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Western blotting. Adult Wistar rats (3 months old, 250–300 g) were killed under deep anesthesia (0.1 mg/g sodium barbital), and their brains and spinal cords were quickly dissected out and frozen immediately on dry ice. Cryostat sections 10 μm thick were collected onto Superfrost Plus slides (Erie Scientific, Portsmouth, NH) and stored at −80 °C until processed. The rat γ1- and γ2-syntrophin cDNA fragments obtained by RT-PCR were subcloned into theEcoRV site of the pBluescript SK vector. The 701- and 432-nucleotide cRNA probes were transcribed in both the antisense and sense orientations from the properly linearized plasmids, using 20 units of T3 or T7 RNA polymerase (Promega), 30 μm35S-UTP (1300 Ci/mmol), and 10 mm each unlabeled ATP, CTP, and GTP. In situ hybridization was performed on 10-μm tissue sections from fresh frozen, non-perfused rat brain and spinal cord as described (51.Angerer L.M. Stoler M.H. Angerer R.C. In Situ Hybridization with RNA Probes: An Annotated Recipe. Oxford University Press, Oxford1987Google Scholar, 52.Johnson S.A. McNeill T. Cordell B. Finch C.E.

Briefly, after fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde, sections were treated with 0.5% acetic anhydride in 100 mmtriethanolamine (pH 8.0) and prehybridized for 1 h at 55 °C in prehybridization buffer (50% formamide, 750 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 10 mmEDTA, 200 μg/ml heparin, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 0.5 mg/ml purified tRNA) containing 10% dextran sulfate and 35S-RNA probe (2 × 108 cpm/ml). After hybridization, sections were treated with 20 μg/ml RNase, washed at high stringency for 1 h at 60 °C, and agitated overnight in 1× SSC. The dehydrated sections were coated with NBT-2 emulsion (Eastman Kodak Co.) and exposed for 2–5 weeks. The autoradiograms were developed, lightly counterstained with methylene blue or hematoxylin and eosin, and examined by dark- and bright-field microscopy. A sense strand probe labeled to the equivalent specific radioactivity of the antisense probe was used on adjacent sections in all experiments to check for background hybridization. Sections were dried at room temperature, fixed in cold acetone, and pretreated with 0.3% H2O2 in PBS to quench the endogenous peroxidase activity; rinsed in PBS; and incubated with 10% normal goat serum and 0.2% Triton X-100 for 60 min to mask nonspecific adsorption sites. Sections were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the anti-γ1- and anti-γ2-syntrophin rabbit polyclonal antibodies (diluted 1:200 in PBS). Omission of the primary antibodies or their replacement by preimmune sera was used for control experiments. After several rinses in PBS, the sections were incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG, washed in PBS, and then incubated with the ABC complex according to the manufacturer's instructions (Vectastain ABC, Vector Labs, Inc.). Peroxidase staining was obtained by incubating the sections in 0.075% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine and 0.002% H2O2 in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.6) for 10 min. In control experiments, when primary antibodies were omitted or replaced by nonimmune sera, the immunoreaction did not take place. Unfixed cryostat sections (5 μm thick) were cut from diagnostic muscle biopsies, air-dried, fixed in cold acetone, preincubated with 10% normal goat serum in PBS for 30 min, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a 1:50 dilution of anti-γ1- or anti-γ2-syntrophin antibody in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. After several rinses in PBS, indirect immunofluorescence was visualized using biotinylated secondary antibodies (1:40) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled streptavidin (1:250) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sections were covered with a glycerol mount and examined with an Olympus photomicroscope equipped with epifluorescence.

Because the tumor suppressor protein p53 may be involved in these effects, we have investigated the role of p53 in mIMCD3 response to hyperosmotic stress. Acute elevation of osmolality with NaCl addition from the control level of 320 mosmol/kg to 500–600 mosmol/kg greatly increased the levels of total and Ser15-phosphorylated p53 within 15 min. However, similar elevation of osmolality with urea did not increase p53 levels. Our studies indicate that induced p53 is transcriptionally active because NaCl addition to 500–600 mosmol/kg stimulated transcription of a luciferase reporter containing a p53 consensus element and appropriately altered mRNA levels of known transcriptional targets of p53, i.e. increased MDM-2 and decreased BCL-2 levels. Elevating NaCl further to 700–800 mosmol/kg rapidly killed most of the cells by apoptosis. At these higher NaCl concentrations, p53 levels were further increased although Ser15 phosphorylation and transcriptional activity were significantly lower than levels at 500–600 mosmol/kg. At NaCl-induced 500 mosmol/kg, apoptosis was rare in the presence of control, nonspecific oligonucleotide but highly prevalent upon addition of p53 antisense oligonucleotide that substantially reduced p53 levels. We conclude that induction of active p53 in mIMCD3 cells by hypertonic stress contributes to cell survival.

Numerous stresses cause increases in p53 activity, which results in either arrest of cell growth until damage is repaired or apoptosis, eliminating cells that are potentially dangerous to the organism. p53 is induced when DNA damage is caused by cytotoxic drugs, free radical formation, or ionizing radiation (4.Meek D.W. Pathol. Biol. 1997; 45: 804-814PubMed Google Scholar). p53 can also be induced in the absence of observed DNA damage by growth factor withdrawal, hypoxia, metabolic change, virus infection, cytokines, or deregulated expression of cell cycle genes (4.Meek D.W. Pathol. Biol. 1997; 45: 804-814PubMed Google Scholar). High concentrations of solutes like NaCl or urea induce apoptosis in numerous types of cells including thymocytes (5.Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A.

Chen I.T. Antinore M.J. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2768-2778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that p53 might be induced by osmotic stress in these cells, an hypothesis supported by reports of nuclear accumulation of p53 in primary human skin fibroblasts in response to high NaCl levels (12.Sugano T. Nitta M. Ohmori H. Yamaizumi M. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1995; 86: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The present studies were performed to determine what role p53 might have in the response of mIMCD3 cells to osmotic stress. We discovered that increasing medium NaCl to a total osmolality of 500 mosmol/kg increased the level of p53 and that this p53 is both phosphorylated on Ser15 and transcriptionally active. Our studies also indicate that the increase in p53 activity protects mIMCD3 cells, because when p53 activation was blocked by a specific p53 antisense oligonucleotide, a marked increase in apoptosis was observed. Subconfluent cultures of mIMCD3 cells (13.Rauchman M.I. Nigam S.K. Delpire E. Gullans S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F416-F424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (generously provided by S. Gullans) were used in passages 13–17. The medium contained 45% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, low glucose, 45% Coon's improved medium mF-12 (Irvine Scientific), and 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Osmolality of control (designated “isosmotic” or “isotonic”) medium, was 320 mosmol/kg. Hyperosmotic medium, which was prepared by adding NaCl or urea, was substituted for the control medium as indicated. Cells were incubated at 37 °C and grown in 5% CO2, 95% air during all experiments. Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, adjusted with NaCl and/or urea to the same osmolality as the medium, and then lysed with 300 μl of lysis buffer (100 mm NaF, 50 mm Tris, 250 μm thimerosal, 1% Igepal (v/v), 16 mm Chaps, 5 mm activated NaVO4, 50 mg/liter Pefabloc, 100 mg/liter leupeptin, and 10 mg/liter aprotinin). Cell lysates were scraped and then homogenized with 10 strokes in Teflon/glass homogenizers (Wheaton) that were chilled in ice water. The combination of lysis buffer with physical homogenization was used to disrupt all membranes. After centrifugation for 20 min at 15,000 × g and 4 °C, the supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Protein content was measured using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Equal amounts of protein (6 μg) were loaded onto each lane of 12% acrylamide/Tris/glycine gels, and electrophoresis was performed at 125 V constant voltage. Proteins were blotted onto Immobilon P membranes (Millipore Corp.) at 1 mA/cm2 constant current for 90 min. Immunodetection procedures were carried out using specific antibodies against p53 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or phospho-p53 (Ser15) (New England Biolabs). To measure p53 protein levels in immunoblots for p53 antisense experiments, cells grown in two-chamber plastic slides (Nalge Nunc International) were lysed with 50 μl of lysis buffer, and 3 μg of protein were loaded onto each lane. To detect apoptosis in the antisense oligonucleotide experiments, cells grown on eight-chamber plastic slides (Nalge Nunc International) were fixed in 100% methanol at −20 °C for 15 min. After fixation, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, incubated with 1 mg/ml RNase (Sigma) for 15 min, stained with 10 μg/ml PI for 5 min, and then mounted with 200 μl of Antifade (Molecular Probes, Inc.). p53 transcriptional activity was determined by transfecting with a reporter construct containing a p53 response element (basic TATA element and tandem repeats of the p53 enhancer element (TGCCTGGACTTGCCTGG) upstream of thePhotinus pyralis (firefly) luciferase gene (p53-Luc, Stratagene). To control for transfection efficiency, cells were cotransfected with a constitutively active plasmid, pRL-B19 (14.Ferraris J.D. Williams C.K. Jung K.-Y. Bedford J.J. Burg M.B. Garcia-Perez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18318-18321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), containing a B19 parvovirus promoter subcloned upstream of theRenilla luciferase gene in the promoterless pRL-null vector (Promega). mIMCD3 cells were grown in isotonic medium in 10-cm dishes (Corning Inc.) and cotransfected with p53-Luc and pRL-B19 using a CellPhect transfection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Transfected cells were seeded onto 35-mm dishes overnight. Then the medium was changed to the same isotonic medium or to medium made hypertonic to 500, 600, or 700 mosmol/kg with NaCl. Cells were lysed with passive lysis buffer (dual luciferase reporter assay system, Promega). Lysates were analyzed for total protein using the BCA protein assay and for firefly and Renilla luciferase activities using the dual luciferase reporter assay system with a Monolight 2010C luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). P. pyralis luciferase activity was normalized by Renilla luciferase activity to adjust for transcription efficiency, and all values were further normalized to the ratio in isotonic medium. Statistical analyses were performed by the analysis of variance Friedman nonparametric repeated test followed by Dunn's multiple comparison test. mIMCD3 cells were grown to 40% confluence in isosmotic medium in 10-cm dishes, which was then changed to the same isosmotic medium or to one made hypertonic with NaCl (500 or 600 mosmol/kg). After 24 h the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and total RNA was isolated using a total RNA isolation kit (Ambion). Antisense, biotin-labeled RNA probes encoding mouse mRNA for MDM-2, BCL-2, BAX, BCL-x, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and cyclophilin (Antisense Probe Templates, Ambion) were synthesized using T7 polymerase (MAXIscript in vitro transcription kit, Ambion). Using a ribonuclease protection assay kit (Ambion), antisense probes were hybridized with 5 μg of RNA, and nonhybridized RNA was digested. Protected fragments were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (6% TBE/urea precast gel, NOVEX), performed at 23 mA constant current. RNA was transferred to BrightStar nylon membrane (Ambion) using 200 mA of constant current for 60 min. RNA was immobilized on the membrane by UV cross-linking immediately after transfer (UV Stratalinker 1800, Stratagene). The biotinylated probes were visualized using a BrightStar BioDetect nonisotopic detection kit (Ambion). Antisense oligonucleotides and controls for regulating p53 expression have been designed and manufactured by Biognostik, Germany. Cells were grown on eight-chamber plastic slides. In experiments aimed at establishing the time course of oligonucleotide uptake by mIMCD3 cells, fluorescein-labeled randomized sequence phosphorothioate oligonucleotide (FITC-Control, Biognistic, Germany) was added for 0–48 h, followed by fixation in 100% methanol. Based on that result, cells were preincubated for 16 h with p53 antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotide (CGTCATGTGCTGTGAC) or the control, CG-matched randomized sequence phosphorothioate oligonucleotide (GACTACGACCTACGTG). Medium was changed to iso- or hypertonic containing the same oligonucleotides. After 6 h, cells were fixed with 100% methanol and stained with PI. Apoptosis was detected using a laser scanning cytometer (CompuCyte Corp.) to measure total PI fluorescence and the peak intensity of PI fluorescence in cell nuclei (15.Furuya T. Kamada T. Murakami T. Kurose A. Sasaki K. Cytometry. 1997; 29: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 16.Bedner E. Li X. Gorczyca W. Melamed M.R. Darzynkiewicz Z. Cytometry. 1999; 35: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Total nuclear PI fluorescence is the integral of fluorescence calculated over the entire area of a nucleus and corresponds to DNA content. The peak intensity is the highest pixel value within the nucleus, which increases as nuclear chromatin condenses during apoptosis. The data are displayed as bivariate cytograms, plotting peak PI fluorescence versus total PI fluorescence in each nucleus or particle. A gate representing the approximate limit of peak fluorescence in cells to which no oligonucleotide was added was set by eye. Peak fluorescence exceeding this limit identified chromatin condensation associated with apoptosis. To confirm apoptosis, representative cells in the different areas of the cytograms were located on slides using spatial coordinates recorded by the laser scanning cytometer, and morphology was recorded microscopically. High peak fluorescence corresponded to nuclei that were bright and shrunken, consistent with the hypercondensation of chromatin that occurs relatively early in apoptosis. Statistical analyses were performed by analysis of variance Friedman nonparametric repeated test followed by Dunn's multiple comparison test. The increase of medium NaCl to a total osmolality of 600 mosmol/kg stopped proliferation of mIMCD3, but after approximately 18 h, cells resumed growth (10.Kultz D. Madhany S. Burg M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13645-13651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). At substantially higher levels of NaCl many of the cells died, and growth was suppressed (8.Santos B.C. Chevaile A. Hebert M.J. Zagajeski J. Gullans S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F1167-F1173PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Michea L. Ferguson D.R. Peters E.M. Andrews P.M. Kirby M.R. Burg M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F209-F218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, 700, 24 h). Thus, we confirmed that mIMCD3 cells can survive acute increases in NaCl up to approximately 600 mosmol/kg but not to 700 mosmol/kg. After acute elevation of NaCl to 600 mosmol/kg, there was a large increase in total and Ser15-phosphorylated p53 levels (Fig.2, A and C). The initial increase in p53 levels following NaCl addition occurred within 15 min and persisted with some fluctuation for at least 24 h (Fig.2, A and C). The NaCl-induced concentration-dependent increase in total p53 levels differed significantly from that of Ser15-phosphorylated p53 (Fig. 3). One hour after NaCl was added, p53 levels increased progressively between 400 and 700 mosmol/kg. In contrast, Ser15-phosphorylated p53 peaked at 600 mosmol/kg and decreased substantially at higher levels of NaCl (Fig. 3). Addition of urea from 500 to 800 mosmol/kg did not increase p53 (Fig. 3 A, urea). Moreover, addition of urea to 600 mosmol reproducibly decreased p53 levels (Fig.2 B).Figure 3p53 (total or Ser15-phosphorylated) levels in mIMCD3 cells as a function of NaCl or urea concentration. Cells were exposed for 1 h to isotonic medium (320 mosmol/kg) or to medium to which NaCl or urea was added to different osmolalities (500, 600, 700, and 800 mosmol/kg).

Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6740) Google Scholar), we tested the effect of high NaCl on p53 transcriptional activity in mIMCD3 cells. We transiently transfected the mIMCD3 cells with a plasmid containing a p53 response element in a synthetic promoter driving a luciferase reporter gene. p53 transcriptional activity increased with added NaCl at 500 or 600 mosmol/kg but not at 700 mosmol/kg (Fig. 4). We also tested the effect of high NaCl on mRNA levels of genes that are transcriptionally regulated by p53, namely MDM-2 (17.Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6740) Google Scholar), BCL-2 (18.Miyashita T. Harigai M. Hanada M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3131-3135PubMed Google Scholar), and BAX-1 (17.Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6740) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). Increasing NaCl to a total osmolality of 500–600 mosmol/kg substantially increases MDM-2 mRNA whereas it decreases BCL-2 mRNA, consistent with previous observations on the effect of p53 on transcription of these genes. In contrast, levels of BCL-x and BAX-1 mRNA were not significantly affected by NaCl addition. Thus, the survival of mIMCD3 cells after an increase of NaCl to a total of 500–600 mosmol/kg correlated with increases in p53 phosphorylation on Ser15 and p53 transactivation. However, a large proportion of these cells did not survive when NaCl was added to a higher level (700 mosmol/kg), even though a further increase in total p53 was observed. The lower survival rate correlated with a lower degree of p53 phosphorylation on Ser15 and p53 transactivation as measured by luciferase assay. These results raised the possibility that the increased p53 activity at 500–600 mosmol/kg might contribute to the survival of the cells. To test this directly, we blocked the increase in p53 by adding p53 antisense oligonucleotides. To characterize oligonucleotide uptake by the mIMCD3 cells, fluorescein-labeled randomized sequence phosphorothioate oligonucleotide (FITC-Control) was used. The fluorescein signal increased within 6 h and maintained a high level for at least 24 h (Fig. 6, A andB). On the basis of this experiment, the preincubation time for p53 antisense oligonucleotide was chosen, and its effect on p53 protein level was checked to test for persistence and function of the intact oligonucleotide in the cells. Incubation with p53 antisense oligonucleotide for 16 h greatly diminished p53 expression under both iso- and hyperosmotic conditions (Fig. 6 C). Laser scanning cytometry was used to determine the effect of p53 antisense oligonucleotide on cell survival. When osmolality was increased to 500 mosmol/kg with NaCl, p53 antisense oligonucleotide substantially reduced cell number (Fig.7 C) and correspondingly increased the proportion of the cells that displayed high peak intensity of PI staining within their nuclei (Fig. 7, A(PI Max Pixel) and D) compared with controls not exposed to oligonucleotides or exposed to the nonspecific oligonucleotide. Representative cells from the areas indicated byarrows in the cytograms in Fig. 7 A were located on the original slides and examined microscopically. With NaCl added to 500 mosmol/kg, cells treated with control, nonspecific oligonucleotide had normal nuclear morphology (Fig. 7 B). However, cells treated with p53 antisense oligonucleotide were clumped and nuclei were condensed, characteristic of apoptosis. The level of p53 rises rapidly within minutes after acute hypertonic stress caused by increasing the concentration of NaCl in mIMCD3 cell medium. Rapid increases in p53 were previously noted to occur in response to a variety of other stresses such as DNA damage, arrest of DNA or RNA synthesis, and nucleotide depletion (reviewed in Refs. 2.Agarwal M.L. Taylor W.R. Chernov M.V. Chernova O.B. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar and 3.Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). The rapid rise in p53 levels generally occurs because of an increase in its half-life, i.e. from 5–20 min in untreated cells to about 150 min in UV-treated cells (19.Maltzman W. Czyzyk L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). MDM-2 is a major intracellular regulator of p53 stability. It binds to the transcriptional activation domain of p53 and targets p53 for rapid ubiquitin-mediated proteosomal degradation, accounting for the normally short half-life of p53. When MDM-2 binding to p53 is prevented, the intracellular levels of p53 increase. The increase in total p53 level with hypertonicity was accompanied by phosphorylation on Ser15. A number of kinases have been implicated in phosphorylation of Ser15 in vitro, including DNA-PK (DNA-dependent protein kinase), ATM (ataxia telangiectasia, mutated) and ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and rad3-related kinase) (1.Oren M.

Nevertheless, the phosphorylation of Ser15 has multiple effects including inhibiting MDM-2 binding, which increases p53 levels by reducing its rate of degradation (3.Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). Ser15 phosphorylation also increases transcriptional activity of p53 (3.Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). As is shown in this study and others (22.Barak Y. Lupo A. Zauberman A. Juven T. Aloni-Grinstein R. Gottlieb E. Rotter V.

Biol. 1994; 59: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), increased p53 transactivation concerns the mdm-2 gene itself, which in turn results in increased levels of MDM-2 and a negative feedback loop for time-dependent regulation of p53 activity during stress. On the other hand, p53 transrepression of thebcl-2 gene has been reported for other stresses (23.Budhram-Mahadeo V. Morris P.J. Smith M.D. Midgley C.A. Boxer L.M. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15237-15244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), a finding that is consistent with its transrepression during osmotic stress (Fig. 5). Interestingly, transcriptional activity and phosphorylation of p53 increase upon adding NaCl only up to approximately 600 mosmol/kg. At higher levels of NaCl, both phosphorylation and transcriptional activity fall dramatically even though there is a further increase in p53 levels. p53 acts as a tumor suppressor either by signaling cell cycle arrest during repair of stress-induced damage or by causing apoptosis, which eliminates highly damaged cells (1.Oren M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36031-36034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 2.Agarwal M.L. Taylor W.R. Chernov M.V. Chernova O.B. Stark G.R. J. Biol.

Thus, activation of p53 can either enhance or reduce survival of stressed cells. In the present studies, the phosphorylation of p53 and its transcriptional activation correlate with cell survival at 500–600 mosmol/kg, which suggests a protective role for p53. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that there is a large increase in apoptosis (Figs. 6 and 7) when, at 500 mosmol/kg, the rise in p53 is prevented with p53 antisense oligonucleotide. The mechanism by which increased p53 activity protects these cells after acute hypertonicity is uncertain. One possibility is induction of growth arrest. When NaCl is acutely increased to a total osmolality of 500–600 mosmol/kg, the mIMCD3 cell cycle is greatly slowed down (8.Santos B.C. Chevaile A. Hebert M.J. Zagajeski J. Gullans S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F1167-F1173PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Michea L. Ferguson D.R. Peters E.M. Andrews P.M. Kirby M.R. Burg M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F209-F218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is also observed following p53 activation by other stresses and provides time for the repair of stress-induced damage (2.Agarwal M.L. Taylor W.R. Chernov M.V. Chernova O.B. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 24.Taylor W.R. Agarwal M.L. Agarwal A. Stacey D.W. Stark G.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The rapid activation of p53 following acute but survivable hypertonicity may protect these cells during an initial period of vulnerability while longer acting protective systems are being activated. Renal medullary as well as other cells respond to hypertonicity over the long term by accumulating compatible organic osmolytes (25.Yancey P.H. Clark M.E. Hand S.C. Bowlus R.D. Somero G.N. Science. 1982; 217: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (3013) Google Scholar, 26.Garcia-Perez A. Burg M.B. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 1081-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). This normalizes both cell volume, which is initially reduced with hypertonicity, and intracellular inorganic ion concentration, which is initially increased. However, it takes many hours to synthesize the transporters and enzymes that are responsible for accumulating the organic osmolytes. The rapid activation of p53 could help protect the cells during this interval. The same role has been proposed for the increase in HSP 70 that also occurs in the early stages of acute hypertonic stress (27.Cohen D.M. Wasserman J.C. Gullans S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C594-C601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mIMCD3 cells used in the present studies are immortalized by constitutive expression of SV40 (13.Rauchman M.I. Nigam S.K. Delpire E. Gullans S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F416-F424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immortalization by SV40 is known to involve its binding to p53 (28.Kierstead T.D. Tevethia M.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1817-1829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which raises the question of possible influence of SV40 on the induction of p53 by hypertonicity. However, nuclear accumulation of p53 was also previously noted in human primary skin fibroblasts with addition of NaCl to 500–600 mosmol/kg (12.Sugano T. Nitta M. Ohmori H. Yamaizumi M. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1995; 86: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), suggesting that SV40 expression is not required for hypertonic induction of p53. An acute increase in the concentration of urea causes cell cycle delay and apoptosis to approximately the same extent as NaCl at the same osmolality (8.Santos B.C. Chevaile A. Hebert M.J. Zagajeski J. Gullans S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F1167-F1173PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Michea L. Ferguson D.R. Peters E.M. Andrews P.M. Kirby M.R. Burg M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F209-F218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this, numerous differences exist in the cellular responses of high NaCl- and urea-treated cells (29.Cohen D.M. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1999; 26: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For example, high urea but not NaCl activates transcription of immediate-early genes via an extracellular signal-regulated kinase/Elk-1-dependent pathway. Urea also activates multiple effectors characteristic of a tyrosine kinase-like signaling cascade. High NaCl, in contrast to urea, activates transcription of numerous tonicity-responsive and heat shock genes. Our finding that high NaCl, but not urea, activates p53 provides another distinction. Thus, despite similar effects of high NaCl and urea on the cell cycle and apoptosis, the two molecules may utilize different signaling pathways."

The alkyl substituents of each inhibitor make extensive hydrophobic contacts in the soluble epoxide hydrolase active site, and each urea carbonyl oxygen accepts hydrogen bonds from the phenolic hydroxyl groups of Tyr381 and Tyr465. These hydrogen bond interactions suggest that Tyr381 and/or Tyr465 are general acid catalysts that facilitate epoxide ring opening in the first step of the hydrolysis reaction; Tyr465 is highly conserved among all epoxide hydrolases, and Tyr381 is conserved among the soluble epoxide hydrolases. In one enzyme-inhibitor complex, the urea carbonyl oxygen additionally interacts with Gln382. If a comparable interaction occurs in catalysis, then Gln382 may provide electrostatic stabilization of partial negative charge on the epoxide oxygen. The carboxylate side chain of Asp333accepts a hydrogen bond from one of the urea NH groups in each enzyme-inhibitor complex. Because Asp333 is the catalytic nucleophile, its interaction with the partial positive charge on the urea NH group mimics its approach toward the partial positive charge on the electrophilic carbon of an epoxide substrate.

DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In mammals, these enzymes exist in two major forms: soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH),1 which is found in the cytosol and peroxisomal matrix, and microsomal epoxide hydrolase, which is membrane-anchored (1.Oesch F. Xenobiotica. 1973; 3: 305-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 3.Wixtrom R.N. Hammock B.D. Zakim D. Vessey D.A. Biochemical Pharmacology and Toxicology. 1.

Both sEH and microsomal epoxide hydrolase are involved in the metabolism of numerous xenobiotics, and sEH also plays a crucial role in lipid epoxide homeostasis. For example, sEH catalyzes the hydrolysis ofcis-9,10-epoxyoctadec-9(Z)-enoic acid (leukotoxin) to form its corresponding diol,threo-9,10-dihydroxyoctadec-12(Z)-enoic acid (leukotoxin diol), and sEH similarly catalyzes the hydrolysis ofcis-12,13-epoxyoctadec-9(Z)-enoic acid (isoleukotoxin) to form its corresponding diolthreo-12,13-dihydroxyoctadec-9(Z)-enoic acid (isoleukotoxin diol) (5.Moghaddam M.F. Grant D.F. Cheek J.M. Greene J.F. Williamson K.C. Hammock B.D. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 562-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Leukotoxins can perturb membrane permeability and ion transport and cause inflammatory responses (5.Moghaddam M.F. Grant D.F. Cheek J.M. Greene J.F. Williamson K.C. Hammock B.D. Nat.

Accordingly, sEH is a possible pharmaceutical target for the treatment of acute disorders such as multiple organ failure and adult respiratory distress syndrome (7.Morisseau C. Goodrow M. Dowdy D.

Recently, the crystal structure of native sEH was reported at 2.8 Å resolution (8.Argiriadi M. Morisseau C. Hammock B.D. Christianson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10637-10642Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The enzyme adopts a homodimeric, domain-swapped architecture in which the C-terminal domain belongs to the α/β hydrolase fold family (9.Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra Frolow F. Franken S.M.

The C-terminal domain, or “catalytic domain,” contains the active site residues required for epoxide hydrolysis. By analogy with related α/β hydrolases such as haloalkane dehalogenase (11.Franken S.M. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkstra B.W.

Asp333 hydrogen bonds to His523, and this interaction may help to stabilize Asp333 in the ionization state required for catalysis. The side chain of Asp495 is close to His523, and a hydrogen bond may form between these two residues during catalysis. Given its active site location and absolute conservation among all sequenced epoxide hydrolases, Tyr465 is a likely general acid that donates a proton to the epoxide oxygen in the first step of catalysis (8.Argiriadi M. Morisseau C. Hammock B.D. Christianson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10637-10642Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 17.Nardini M. Ridder I.S. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Rink R. Janssen D.B. Dijkstra B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14579-14586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The structure of native sEH also reveals that Tyr381 is similarly located in the active site; being conserved among the sEH enzymes, this residue is likewise a candidate general acid (8.Argiriadi M.

However, because Tyr381 is not universally conserved among all epoxide hydrolases (it is apparently absent from the microsomal enzymes), it cannot be a universal general acid. The active site tunnel is L-shaped, with catalytic residues located at the corner of the L. Both ends of the L open to solvent; one end consists of a long, narrow hydrophobic channel, and the other end consists of a shorter, wider cleft containing a hydrophobic pocket. Although the N-terminal domain of sEH resembles other hydrolytic enzymes such as haloacid dehalogenase (18.Hisano T. Hata Y. Fujii T. Liu J.-Q. Kurihara T. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biol.

Dialkylureas are potent inhibitors of the recombinant murine and human enzymes (7.Morisseau C. Goodrow M. Dowdy D. Zheng J. Greene J.F. Sanborn J.R. Hammock B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8849-8854Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and the crystal structure of the murine sEH-N-cyclohexyl-N′-(3-phenyl)propylurea (CPU;K i = 3.1 nm) complex reveals an unusualtrans, cis-conformation for the dialkylurea moiety; inhibitor binding is stabilized by numerous hydrophobic van der Waals' contacts and a single hydrogen bond between Tyr465 and a urea NH group (8.Argiriadi M. Morisseau C. Hammock B.D. Christianson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10637-10642Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Although the structure of the sEH-CPU complex confirmed the location of the sEH active site, it did not provide meaningful clues about substrate or transition state binding; the polarity of the single enzyme-inhibitor hydrogen bond was inconsistent with a potential function for Tyr465 as a catalytic proton donor, and the known catalytic nucleophile Asp333 did not contact the inhibitor. Thus, the mechanistic inferences from the first and only available structure of an sEH-inhibitor complex were quite limited. Could Tyr381 or other polar residues in the sEH active site participate in inhibitor and/or substrate binding? To clarify mechanistic inferences from the binding of potent alkylurea inhibitors to sEH, we now report the x-ray crystal structure determinations of sEH complexed with two different inhibitors:N-cyclohexyl-N′-decylurea (CDU;K i = 6.3 ± 0.5 nm) andN-cyclohexyl-N′-(4-iodophenyl)urea (CIU;K i = 17 ± 4 nm) (Fig.2). These inhibitors bind in the sEH active site and directly mimic interactions consistent with the activation of a substrate epoxide ring for nucleophilic attack by Asp333.

Briefly, CDU and CIU were dissolved to concentrations of 100 mm in 100% ethanol and Me2SO, respectively. 1 μl of each stock solution was added in sitting drop wells containing 100 μl of mother liquor. The sEH crystals were transferred to these wells and soaked in the 1 mm inhibitor solution for 4 days. Crystals were flash-cooled following the addition of 30% glycerol to the mother liquor (v/v). Diffraction data were collected at Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source at a wavelength of 0.890 Å at 100 K. Diffraction intensities were measurable to 3.0–3.1 Å resolution.

Open table in a new tab Although the resolution of these enzyme-inhibitor complexes is considered modest at 3.0–3.1 Å, the information content of these structures is nevertheless quite high. The binding conformations of CDU and CIU are determined unambiguously, and these conformations are quite similar; that similar conformations are observed in two independent experiments with two independent inhibitors strengthens the interpretation of intermolecular interactions despite the modest resolution. Importantly, the intermolecular interactions of CDU and CIU provide the first glimpse of a constellation of hydrogen bonds that activate epoxide substrates for hydrolysis, and these interactions were not observed in the previously determined structure of the sEH-CPU complex (8.Argiriadi M. Morisseau C. Hammock B.D. Christianson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10637-10642Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The discussion below outlines the structures of the sEH-CDU and sEH-CIU complexes and then incorporates this new structural information into a brief discussion of substrate specificity and a proposed mechanism for the hydrolysis of complex epoxide substrates. The binding of CDU does not trigger any significant tertiary or quaternary structural changes in sEH, as indicated by the r.m.s. deviation of 0.4 Å for 994 Cα atoms between the native enzyme and the enzyme-inhibitor complex. However, some local structural changes are observed in the active site that may reflect possible binding interactions of larger epoxide substrates such as the leukotoxins. The inhibitor binds with a trans,trans dialkyl urea linkage, and the N′-decyl tail extends out of the active site and makes numerous van der Waals' contacts with hydrophobic residues such as Met361, Val372, Trp334, Val337, and Pro363 (Fig.3). Thermal B factors increase toward the end of the decyl tail of CDU, which may indicate increased flexibility in substrate binding toward the end of the active site tunnel. TheN-cyclohexyl group packs in the hydrophobic pocket and makes numerous van der Waals' contacts with hydrophobic residues Val497, Phe406, Phe265, Trp524, and Tyr381. Significantly, the urea carbonyl group accepts hydrogen bonds from Tyr465 and Tyr381. Tyr465 is a conserved residue in the epoxide hydrolase family and is a proposed general acid in catalysis (8.Argiriadi M. Morisseau C. Hammock B.D. Christianson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10637-10642Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 17.Nardini M. Ridder I.S. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Rink R. Janssen D.B. Dijkstra B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14579-14586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Although Tyr381 is not conserved in the microsomal epoxide hydrolases, it is also considered a possible general acid catalyst (8.Argiriadi M. Morisseau C. Hammock B.D. Christianson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10637-10642Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 17.Nardini M. Ridder I.S. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Rink R. Janssen D.B. Dijkstra B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14579-14586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Recent experiments show that mutation of Tyr381 and Tyr465 to phenylalanine individually and together dramatically reduces catalytic activity, particularly with chemically stable substrates; notably, catalytic activity in the double variant is completely eliminated. 2T. Yamada, C. H. Morisseau, J. E. Maxwell, M. A. Argiriadi, D. W. Christianson, and B. D. Hammock, submitted for publication. Likewise, site-directed mutagenesis studies of the epoxide hydrolase fromA. radiobacter AD1 indicate that both of the corresponding tyrosine residues are important for catalysis (26.Rink R. Spelberg J.H.L. Pieters R.J. Kingma J. Nardini M. Kellogg R.M. Dijkstra B.W. Janssen D.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 7417-7418Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, both x-ray crystallography and site-directed mutagenesis together indicate that Tyr381 and Tyr465 serve as general acid catalysts that activate the substrate epoxide ring for nucleophilic atack by Asp333. Interestingly, Asp333 accepts a hydrogen bond from the urea NH group of CDU, which may mimic the interaction between the catalytic nucleophile and the partial positive charge on the substrate epoxide carbon. Another polar active site residue may play a role in the hydrolysis reaction. The side chain of Gln382 undergoes a conformational change and moves closer to the bound inhibitor, donating an additional hydrogen bond to the urea carbonyl group. Because Gln382 is conserved among the mammalian isozymes, it is possible that this residue is an electrostatic catalyst that helps to stabilize the epoxide oxygen in catalysis by hydrogen bonding. As in the sEH-CDU complex, the binding of CIU does not trigger any major tertiary or quaternary structural changes in sEH, as indicated by the r.m.s deviation of 0.5 Å for 994 Cα atoms between the native enzyme and the enzyme-inhibitor complex. Nevertheless, some local structural changes in the active site accommodate inhibitor binding. The inhibitor binds with a trans,trans-dialkyl linkage, and the cyclohexyl ring packs in the hydrophobic pocket, making van der Waals' contacts with Val497, Phe406, Phe265, Trp524, and Tyr381 (Fig.4). Interestingly, the cyclohexyl ring of CIU adopts a different conformation with respect to the urea group, corresponding to a 58° rotation about the C-N linkage; this is visible in the superposition of Fig. 5. This reflects the large size of the hydrophobic pocket that can accommodate large substrate substituents and different conformations of such substituents in this region of the active site. The iodophenyl group of CIU binds in the hydrophobic channel, making van der Waals' contacts with Trp334, Leu498, Met361, and Val337 (Fig.4). Because both CDU and CIU bind withtrans,trans-dialkylurea linkages and CPU binds with an unusual trans,cis-dialkylurea linkage (8.Argiriadi M. Morisseau C. Hammock B.D. Christianson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10637-10642Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), we advance that the binding mode of CPU is probably exceptional and not preferential for this series of inhibitors (7.Morisseau C. Goodrow M. Dowdy D. Zheng J. Greene J.F. Sanborn J.R. Hammock B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

As observed in the sEH-CDU complex, the carbonyl group of CIU accepts hydrogen bonds from Tyr465 and Tyr381; however, it does not interact with Gln382, even though Gln382 undergoes a small conformational change. Finally, Asp333 accepts a hydrogen bond from the urea NH group of CIU. The common binding modes of both inhibitors in the sEH active site are clearly visible in the superposition of Fig. 5. With only three or four intermolecular hydrogen bond interactions made in each enzyme-inhibitor complex, the substrate binding conformation is mostly governed by van der Waals' contacts made with the residues defining the unique active site contour. The binding modes of CDU and CIU show how sEH accommodates large aliphatic substrates such as the leukotoxins. As mentioned previously, the active site is in the middle of a hydrophobic, L-shaped tunnel. The long, aliphatic inhibitor CDU conforms to this hydrophobic L-shaped contour, and corresponding substrate binding modes can be postulated based on the structure of the sEH-CDU complex (Fig. 6). The specificity of sEH will be greatest toward the larger aliphatic substrates that can achieve favorable binding conformation in the L-shaped tunnel; presumably, substrate binding modes in which epoxide substituents dangle out of one end of the active site tunnel would be disfavored. Introduction of multiple degrees of unsaturation in the substrate can possibly hinder substrate binding, or may alter regiochemical preferences for the nucleophilic attack of Asp333 at one or the other epoxide carbon. For example, in the hydrolysis ofcis-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, optimal sEH activity favors the 14(R),15(S)-epoxide rather than the 14(S),15(R) stereoisomer or the 5,6-, 8,9-, or 11,12-epoxide isomers (27.Zeldin D.C.

The cis-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids have significant conformational restraints imposed upon binding because of their unsaturation. Apparently, only the 14(R),15(S)-epoxide isomer can achieve an optimal substrate binding conformation in the L-shaped active site tunnel of sEH. Moreover, preferential formation of thevic-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid product with 14(R),15(R) stereochemistry indicates a regiochemical preference for nucleophilic attack of Asp333at C-15 of the 14(R),15(S)-cis-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid substrate (27.Zeldin D.C.

Previous structural and biochemical evidence suggest that sEH catalysis proceeds through an SN2-like reaction at the substrate epoxide carbon (8.Argiriadi M. Morisseau C. Hammock B.D.

The epoxide moiety displays partial positive charges on each carbon and a partial negative charge on the oxygen, and the distribution of partial charge in the reaction coordinate of epoxide ring opening is mimicked by the dialkylurea inhibitors CDU and CIU (Fig. 2). From the hydrogen bond interactions observed in the sEH-CDU and sEH-CIU complexes it is inferred that the carboxylate group of Asp333 performs a backside nucleophilic attack on the electrophilic epoxide carbon in concert with proton donation to the epoxide oxygen by Tyr465 or Tyr381. Each tyrosine hydroxyl group is oriented nearly perfectly in-line with a lone electron pair on the epoxide oxygen when the epoxide is aligned for nucleophilic attack by Asp333 (Fig.7). Therefore, the constellation of interactions with Asp333, Tyr465, and Tyr381 define the reaction coordinate of the first step of catalysis. Possible hydrogen bond interactions with Gln382may mimic additional polar interactions that stabilize the transition state. In conclusion, the mechanism of leukotoxin hydrolysis outlined in Fig.8 incorporates the new structural information emanating from the sEH-CDU and sEH-CIU complexes, and this mechanism is representative for the hydrolysis of a lipid epoxide substrate. The carboxylate side chain of Asp333 is the catalytic nucleophile that attacks the electrophilic carbon of the epoxide. Directly across the active site cavity from Asp333are the phenolic side chains of Tyr465 and Tyr381, one of which can serve as a proton donor to activate and accelerate epoxide ring opening. The tyrosine that does not donate its proton can nevertheless serve as an electrostatic catalyst, along with Gln382, by hydrogen bond donation to the epoxide oxygen. Parenthetically, we note that Tyr465 is flanked by edge-to-face interactions with Trp334 and Phe385 that would stabilize the intermediate phenolate anion; no such interactions can be achieved by the phenolate anion of Tyr381, but this does not rule out Tyr381 as a proton donor. The alkylenzyme ester intermediate is subsequently hydrolyzed by a water molecule promoted by general base His523. The basicity of His523 is likely enhanced by the negatively charged carboxylate side chain of Asp495 and the partial negative charge of the indole ring of Trp524; the imidazole ring makes a classic cation-π interaction with Trp524. Finally, an “oxyanion hole” containing backbone NH groups of Phe265 and Trp334 may stabilize the oxyanion of the tetrahedral intermediate in alkylenzyme hydrolysis and collapse of this intermediate yields the product leukotoxin diol.

Many premalignant and malignant cells exhibit a reduced RARβ expression. However, in some of these cells (e.g. H157 human squamous cell carcinoma cells), RARβ can be induced by retinoids (e.g. all-trans-retinoic acid, ATRA) because its promoter contains a retinoic acid response element. To examine the hypothesis that RARβ induction is important for inhibition of cell proliferation by retinoids, we blocked ATRA-induced RARβ expression in H157 cells using a retroviral vector harboring multiple copies of antisense RARβ2 sequences. Antisense RARβ-transfected cells showed not only decreased expression of ATRA-induced RARβ protein but also reduced ATRA-induced RARE binding activity and transactivation. Importantly, all antisense RARβ transfectants of H157 cells were less responsive than vector-transfected cells to the growth inhibitory effects of the retinoids ATRA and Ch55 in vitro. These results demonstrate that RARβ induction may play an important role in mediating growth inhibitory effects of retinoids in cancer cells.

Retinoids are thought to exert most of their effects by regulating gene expression primarily through two classes of nuclear receptors, RARs1 and RXRs (3.Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M.

However, it is not clear to what extent if any the induced RARβ contributes to the response to growth-inhibitory effects of retinoids or whether it plays no role in the overall response to retinoids. To further understand the importance of RARβ induction, we constructed and transfected a retroviral expression vector harboring antisense RARβ2 into the H157 human lung squamous cell carcinoma cell line, which expresses RARβ only after ATRA treatment, and found that blocking RARβ induction decreases cell sensitivity to retinoids. ATRA and Ch55 were kindly provided by Dr. Werner Bollag (F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and Dr. Koichi Shudo (Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan), respectively. They were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide at a concentration of 10 mm under N2 and stored in the dark at −80 °C. Stock solutions were diluted to the desired concentrations with growth medium just prior to use. The H157 lung squamous cell carcinoma cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and grown in monolayer culture in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C. The retroviral vector LNSX, obtained from Dr. D. Miller (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA) (29.Miller A.D. Rosman G. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-990PubMed Google Scholar), was used in this study. We introduced into the LNSX vector multiple copies of hRARβ2 cDNA fragments corresponding to the initial site of RARβ2 translation in an antisense orientation by ligating 385-base pair BamHI/SphI cDNA fragments released from pSG5-RARβ plasmid (30.Brand N. Petkovitch M. Krust A. Chambon P. De The H. Marchio M. Tiollais P. Dejean A. Nature. 1988; 332: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar) into unique HindIII,ClaI, and BamHI sites through blunt end ligation with T4 DNA ligase, respectively. We obtained a series of vectors harboring different number of copies of RARβ2 cDNA inserts in an antisense orientation as identified by sequencing and enzymatic digestions. Vectors harboring one, two, three, four, five, and six antisense RARβ2 inserts were designated as LNASβ, LNASβII, LNASβIII, LNASβIV, LNASβV, and LNASβVI, respectively. The LNASβVI shown in Fig. 1 was used in all subsequent experiments. LNASβVI or LNSX as a vector control was transfected directly into PA317 amphotropic packaging cell line by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (31.Shambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.30-16.36Google Scholar). The transfected cells were cultured in G418 (500 μg/ml), and individual clones of resistant cells were picked up using cloning cylinders after 14 days and expanded. The supernatants from these retroviral producers were titered on thymidine kinase-negative NIH3T3 target cells as described previously (31.Shambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.30-16.36Google Scholar). Supernatant from the highest titer producer clone for either LNASβVI or LNSX (up to 5 × 105/ml) was used in all subsequent experiments. H157 cells were plated at 1:10 split in 6-cm diameter tissue culture dishes (Corning). On the second day, the medium was replaced with 2 ml of fresh medium containing different amounts of viral supernatant and 8 μg/ml of polybrene, and 2 h later, 2 ml of fresh medium was added. Cells were split at 1:10 into 10-cm diameter dishes and selected after 24 h using G418 (1000 μg/ml)-containing medium. Surviving clones were isolated after 12–15 days using cloning cylinders. The rest of the clones from different dishes were pooled as pool transfectants. Transfectants were expanded and maintained under continuous G418 selection at 500 μg/ml. Total cellular RNA purification and Northern blotting were performed as described previously (32.Sun S-Y. Yue P. Dawson M.I. Shroot B. Michel S. Lamph W.W. Heyman R.A. Teng M. Chandraratna R.A.S. Shudo K. Hong W.K. Lotan R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4931-4939PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty micrograms of RNA was loaded per lane. The 385-base pair BamHI/SphI fragment of RARβ from pSG5 expression vector harboring human RARβ2 cDNA (30.Brand N. Petkovitch M. Krust A. Chambon P. De The H. Marchio M. Tiollais P. Dejean A. Nature. 1988; 332: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar), obtained from Dr. Pierre Chambon (Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, Illkirch, C.U. de Strasbourg, France), was used as a probe for Northern blotting. The 340-base pairEcoRI/XbaI cDNA for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX), was used as a control of RNA loading. Nuclear extracts were prepared from H157 transfectants by a method described by Pollocket al. (33.Pollock R. Treisman R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6197-6204Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Eighty micrograms of protein was electrophoresed through a 10% polyacrylamide slab gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) by electroblotting. The blot was immersed in blocking solution (15% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline) at room temperature for 1 h and then incubated with a 1:50 dilution of rabbit anti-RARβ polyclonal antiserum (generously provided by Dr. P. Chambon) in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C with agitation. The blot was washed four times with blocking solution and incubated with 125I-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG at a 1:2500 dilution in blocking solution at room temperature for 1 h. The blot was then washed four more times with blocking solution containing 0.1% Tween 20 and exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C for 2–5 days. Nuclear extracts from H157 transfectants used in this assay were the same as those prepared for Western blotting. The following synthetic oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (4000 Ci/mol; ICN Rediochemicals, Irvine, CA) using T4 polynucleotide kinase: wild-type RARE-β2, 5′-TCGAGGGTAGGGTTCACCGAAAGTTCACTCG-3′; mutant RARE, 5′-TCGAGGGTAGGcTTacCCGAAAGTTCA-3′. Nuclear extracts were preincubated with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) for 15 min on ice and then incubated with labeled RARE-β2 (approximately 10,000 cpm) for 15 min on ice in the presence of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 20% glycerol. For the gel supershift assay, receptor-specific monoclonal antibodies of RARs and RXRs (provided by Dr. P. Chambon) (0.3 μl) were added to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixtures (10 μl) were electrophoresed on a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 192 mm glycine, and 1 mm EDTA, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. The (RARE)3-TK-Luc reporter plasmid, which contains three direct repeats of RARE from the P2 promoter region of the human RARβ2 gene (from −59 to −33) connected to herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter, and TK-LUC control reporter plasmids were provided by Dr. R. A. Heyman (Ligand Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA). The AP1-TK-Luc reporter plasmid, which contains the luciferase gene controlled by a promoter fragment of the collagenase gene (−74 to −63) harboring a consensus AP-1 binding site (TGAGTCA) connected to the thymidine kinase promoter, was obtained from Dr. J. Kurie (University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). pCH110 plasmid encoding β-galactosidase was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The plasmid purification, transfection, and luciferase activity assay procedures were the same as described previously (34.Sun S-Y. Yue P. Shroot B. Hong W.K. Lotan R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The effects of retinoids on the growth of different transfectants were evaluated by the sulforhodamine B assay as described previously (32.Sun S-Y. Yue P. Dawson M.I. Shroot B. Michel S. Lamph W.W. Heyman R.A. Teng M. Chandraratna R.A.S. Shudo K. Hong W.K. Lotan R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4931-4939PubMed Google Scholar). Colony formation assay was performed as follows. Cells were plated at a density of 2000 cells in 6-cm diameter tissue culture dishes (Corning) and treated on the next day with retinoids. The medium was replaced with fresh medium containing retinoids every 3 days. After a 12-day treatment, colonies were stained with 0.5% methylene blue in 70% ethanol and counted. H157 cells express undetectable levels of RARβ (by Northern blotting) but a high level of induced RARβ after treatment with ATRA or other retinoids. This cell line was infected with the LNASβVI retroviral vector (Fig.1), and individual G418-resistant clones were isolated. These clones were designated H157-LNASβ. Vector-only control clones were obtained by infecting the same cell line with the retroviral vector LNSX, which does not contain the antisense RARβ sequence (Fig. 1). These control clones were designated H157-LNSX. Northern blotting was performed on transfectants to determine the expression level of antisense RARβ mRNA. The 4.3-kilobase antisense mRNA controlled by the SV40 promoter and the antisense mRNA larger than 5 kilobases driven by the long terminal repeat promoter were detected using a 385-base pairBamHI/SphI RARβ2 cDNA fragment as a probe in all of the LNASβVI-infected clones but not in the LNSX-infected control cells (Fig. 2 A). Western blot analysis using an RARβ-specific polyclonal antiserum (35.Rochette-Egly C. Gaub M.P. Lutz Y. Ali S. Scheuer L. Chambon P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2197-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) revealed high levels of RARβ protein in ATRA-treated LNSX-P cells (vector only) (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, ATRA induced less RARβ protein in most antisense RARβ-transfected clones, indicating that antisense RARβ expression was effective in the cells. To examine the effect of stable transfection of antisense RARβ on the formation of complexes between nuclear receptors and RARE, we performed gel shift and supershift assays, which are very sensitive methods for detecting functional RAR proteins. Fig. 3 A shows that a weak signal of shifted band was observed with extract from untreated LNSX-P cells. This band was decreased in untreated LNASβ-9 cells. Antibodies against RARα and RARβ failed to supershift complexes in untreated LNSX-P or LNASβ-9 cell extracts. However, antibodies against RARγ and RXRs did supershift complexes in both cell types. Treatment with ATRA increased markedly the amount of shifted complexes in LNSX-P cells, but only a very small increase in the amount of shifted complex was observed in ATRA-treated LNASβ-9 cells. Importantly, antibodies against RARβ supershifted a major complex in the ATRA-treated LNSX-P cells but not at all in the LNASβ-9 cells (Fig. 3 A). These results clearly show that the antisense RARβ transfectants do not express functional RARβ even after ATRA treatment, whereas the vector controls exhibit a large increase in functional RARβ. The band specificity was assured by the fact that they were competed out by a 100-fold molar excess of nonradioactive wild-type RARE but not by the same amount of nonradioactive mutated RARE (data not shown). Furthermore, we found that induction of RARE transcriptional activation by ATRA was markedly decreased in antisense RARβ-transfected cells in comparison with LNSX-transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 3 B, RARE transactivation was increased 20–30-fold in both LNSX-transfected clones but only 8-fold in two LNASβ transfectants. One possible explanation for the residual transactivation capacity in LNASβ-transfected cells is the presence of other RARs and RXRs. Fig.3 A shows that RARγ and at least one RXR protein and traces of RARβ can be supershifted from complexes with RARE in LNASβ-9 cells after ATRA treatment. It is plausible to suggest that these receptors are responsible for the activation of RARE-Luc reporter in the antisense RARβ transfectants. The partial suppression of RARE transactivation in the LNASβ-transfected cells appeared to be specific for RARE, because the transactivation of another reporter construct mediated by AP-1 binding was not suppressed in these transfectants (Fig. 3 C). We next compared the responsiveness of LNASβVI-transfected clones to retinoid treatment with that of LNSX-transfected cells. Fig.4 A shows the effects of different retinoids on the population growth of LNASβVI-transfected and LNSX-transfected cells. Four LNASβVI-transfected clones exhibited much lower sensitivity to ATRA treatment than three LNSX-transfected cells did. ATRA at concentrations of 1 and 2.5 μm caused 20–40% growth inhibition in LNSX-transfected cells but less than 20% growth inhibition in all LNASβ VI-transfected clones (Fig.4 A). The synthetic retinoid Ch55 is a pan-RAR-selective agonist and has better receptor binding affinities, especially to RARβ, than ATRA, but it is much more active than ATRA in inhibiting the growth of H157 and other lung cancer cells (32.Sun S-Y. Yue P. Dawson M.I. Shroot B. Michel S. Lamph W.W. Heyman R.A. Teng M. Chandraratna R.A.S. Shudo K. Hong W.K. Lotan R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4931-4939PubMed Google Scholar). To better demonstrate the low responsiveness of antisense RARβ-transfected cells, we further examined the effects of Ch55 on the growth of different LNSX-transfected cells and LNASβVI-transfected clones. As shown in Fig. 4 A, Ch55 caused dose- and time-dependent growth-inhibitory effects in all LNSX-transfected cells. However, the responsiveness of all LNASβVI-transfected cells to Ch55 was lower than that of LNSX-transfected cells; Ch55 at 1 and 2.5 μm inhibited cell growth by 40–60 and 65–80%, respectively in LNSX-transfected cells but by less than 20 and 35%, respectively, in LNASβVI-transfected cells after a 6-day treatment (Fig.4 A). In addition, we analyzed the effects of ATRA and Ch55 on the colony formation of different transfectants. Similar to the population growth inhibition results, all LNASβVI-transfected cells exhibited less sensitivity (about 50%) than LNSX-transfected cells to inhibition of colony formation by ATRA and Ch55 (Fig. 4 B). These results clearly show that blockage of RARβ induction decreased the cell responsiveness to retinoids. It has been suggested that RARβ may play a role as a tumor suppressor. This hypothesis was based on the observation that RARβ levels decreased in a variety of tumor cell lines including lung carcinomas (9.Gebert J.F. Moghal N. Frangioni J.V. Sugarbaker D.J. Neel B.G. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1859-1868PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Houle B. Ledue F. Bradley W.E.C. Choromosomes Cancer. 1991; 3: 358-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 11.Hu L. Crowe D.L.

It has been shown that RARβ expression, which is suppressed at early stages of head and neck and lung carcinogenesis, can be induced by retinoid treatment (27.Lotan R. Xu X.C. Lippman S.M. Ro J.Y.

Oncol. 1999; 17: 3546-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The induction of RARβ by retinoids is not surprising, because the RARβ gene promoter contains a RARE (5.De The H. Vivanco-Ruiz M.M. Tiollais P. Stunnenberg H. Dejean A. Nature. 1990; 343: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 6.Sucov H.M. Murakami K.K. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, it was not clear whether this induction is important for the overall effect of ATRA on cell phenotype, namely whether RARβ increase plays a role in growth inhibition. Our study has addressed this question by blocking RARβ induction by ATRA using a retroviral vector harboring antisense RARβ. The results show clearly that the antisense vector was effective in decreasing the level of the RARβ protein and that this was accompanied by a decrease in the response of the transfected cells to two RAR-selective retinoids (ATRA and Ch55). Thus, our data support the conclusion that the induction of RARβ by retinoids may be an early step in the cascade of events leading to growth inhibition. We used H157 lung carcinoma cells, which do not express RARβ constitutively but can be induced to express this receptor after ATRA treatment. These cells were, therefore, a good system to explore the role of RARβ induction in mediating the growth-inhibitory effects of retinoids. We used for the first time antisense RARβ to block induction of RARβ by retinoids. This approach does not involve severe selective pressure as isolation of transfectants expressing sense RARβ would, because the H157 cells do not express endogenous sense RARβ. Therefore, the expression of exogenous antisense RARβ should not affect them until they are treated with ATRA. Our present study provides the first direct evidence supporting the important role of RARβ induction in mediating growth-inhibitory effects of retinoids in human cancer cells. Our in vitro finding that induction of RARβ by retinoids is important for growth inhibition may explain the correlation that we had established previously in vivobetween the induction of RARβ and clinical response in patients with oral premalignant lesions (27.Lotan R. Xu X.C. Lippman S.M. Ro J.Y. Lee J.S. Lee J.J. Hong W.K. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1405-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) and patients with renal cell carcinoma (16.Berg W.J. Nanus D.M. Leung A. Brown K.T. Hutchinson B. Mazumdar M. Xu X.C. Lotan R. Reuter V.E. Motzer R.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 1671-1675PubMed Google Scholar). Antisense RARβ2 has been used previously to generate transgenic mice with reduced levels of RARβ2. Interestingly, mice expressing the antisense RARβ2 transgene developed lung carcinomas, demonstrating that partial inactivation of RARβ2 predisposes the mice to lung cancer (37.Berard J. Laboune F. Mukuna M. Masse S. Kothary R. Bradley W.E. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1091-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The precise function of RARβ2 is still unknown; however, recent studies with F9 mouse teratocarcinoma cells rendered RARβ2 null by homologous recombination have found that the cells become resistant to growth arrest by ATRA. In addition, the cells were somewhat compromised in their ability to undergo differentiation by ATRA and showed a markedly lower induction of several ATRA-responsive genes (38.Faria T.N. Mendelsohn C. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26783-26788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These results suggest that RARβ is required for ATRA-induced growth arrest in F9 cells. Severe defects in RARβ expression have been observed in cells where ATRA treatment cannot induce RARβ expression (39.Geradts J. Chen J.Y. Russell E.K. Yankaskas J.R. Nieves L. Minna J.D. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 799-809PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Zhang X.K. Liu Y. Lee M.O. Pfahl M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5663-5669PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Moghal N. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3945-3959Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that transfection of RARβ sense expression vectors into cells deficient in this receptor resulted in restoration of growth inhibition, apoptosis, and decreased tumorigenicity by retinoids (21.Li Y.

Thus, both induction of endogenous RARβ by retinoids (this study) and expression of exogenous RARβ (studies by others) (21-25) may lead to a similar result, namely growth inhibition by retinoids. However, the role of induction of endogenous RARβ by retinoids may be more relevant to explain ongoing clinical chemoprevention trials with retinoids. We thank Drs. W. Bollag and K. Shudo for providing the retinoids used in this study. We are also grateful to Drs. D. Miller, P. Chambon, and R. A. Heyman for providing the plasmids and antibodies used in this study."

We have synthesized the complete suite of acyclic permutants of kalata B1 and examined the effect of acyclic permutation on structure and activity. Only two of six topologically distinct backbone loops are critical for folding into the native conformation, and these involve disruption of the embedded ring in the cystine knot. Surprisingly, it is possible to disrupt regions of the β-sheet and still allow folding into native-like structure, provided the cystine knot is intact. Kalata B1 has mild hemolytic activity, but despite the overall structure of the native peptide being retained in all but two cases, none of the acyclic permutants displayed hemolytic activity. This loss of activity is not localized to one particular region and suggests that cyclization is critical for hemolytic activity.

It may be thought of as joining the ends of a protein and then opening the chain elsewhere. These experiments have shown that it is possible in some cases to permute the termini of a protein and still allow folding into the native conformation (1.Boissinot M. Karnas S. Lepock J.R.

Biol. 1996; 3: 874-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), thus providing valuable information on protein folding. In practice the conceptual “circular proteins” intrinsic to the design of circular permutants are never actually synthesized but are theoretical intermediates. The recent discovery of a naturally occurring family of circular proteins, however, allows us to start from a circular protein and explore the concept of “acyclic permutation.” In the current study we introduce this concept for the prototypic circular protein, kalata B1, the first circular protein to be structurally characterized. Kalata B1 belongs to a family of macrocyclic peptides termed the cyclotides (3.Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Bond T. Waine C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1327-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) that are approximately 30 amino acids in length with three disulfide bonds and are isolated from plants in the Rubiaceae and Violaceae families (4.Gran L.

These peptides display an interesting range of biological activities, which led to their initial discovery. The circulins were found in a screen for anti-human immunodeficiency virus activity (8.Gustafson K.R. Sowder II R.C. Henderson L.E. Parsons I.C. Kashman Y. Cardellina J.H., II McMahon J.B.

The varv peptides A-H have been isolated from Viola arvensis (14.Claeson P. Göransson U. Johansson S. Luijendijk T. Bohlin L. J. Nat. Prod. (Lloydia). 1998; 61: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 15.Göransson U. Luijendijk T. Johansson S. Bohlin L. Claeson P. J. Nat. Prod.

Daly N.L. Bond T. Waine C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1327-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). There is approximately 40% sequence conservation throughout the known sequences. The importance of this family of unusually large cyclic peptides has been increased by the discovery of their anti-microbial activity against various strains of bacteria and fungi (13.Tam J.P. Lu Y.A. Yang J.L. Chiu K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8913-8918Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of three members of this family (kalata B1 (10.Saether O. Craik D.J. Campbell I.D. Sletten K. Juul J. Norman D.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4147-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), circulin A (16.Daly N.L. Koltay A. Gustafson K., R. Boyd M.R. Casas-Finet J.R. Craik D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 333-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and cycloviolacin O1 (3.Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Bond T. Waine C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1327-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar)) have been determined by NMR spectroscopy and reveal the presence of a cyclic cystine knot motif, so named because of the N- to C-cyclized backbone and knotted three-dimensional structure (3.Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Bond T. Waine C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1327-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 12.Daly N.L. Love S. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10606-10614Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The disulfide bonds are in a cystine-knot arrangement with the Cys connectivities I-IV, II-V, and III-VI (10.Saether O. Craik D.J. Campbell I.D. Sletten K. Juul J. Norman D.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4147-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 17.Derua R. Gustafson K.R. Pannell L.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) in which two disulfide bonds and their connecting backbone segments produce an eight-residue cycle through which the third disulfide bond “threads” (10.Saether O. Craik D.J. Campbell I.D. Sletten K. Juul J. Norman D.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4147-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The threading of this embedded eight-residue cycle is highlighted in Fig.1. The cyclic cystine knot motif is distinct because of its cyclic backbone; however, the cystine knot motif is present in a large number of peptides and proteins with diverse functions. These include ion channel toxins (18.Pallaghy P.K. Nielsen K.J. Craik D.J. Norton R.S. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1833-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), proteinase inhibitors (18.Pallaghy P.K. Nielsen K.J. Craik D.J. Norton R.S. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1833-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), and growth factors (19.McDonald N.Q. Hendrickson W.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 421-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), and it has recently been suggested that a phenoloxidase inhibitor is also a member of this family (20.Daquinag A.C. Sato T. Koda H. Takao T. Fukuda M. Shimonishi Y. Tsukamoto T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2179-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It is therefore of great interest to explore the folding of this important motif. Numerous other peptide families contain characteristic cystine frameworks (i.e. the positions and spacings between the cysteine residues) that appear to stabilize structural motifs (21.Tamaoki H. Miura R. Kusunoki M. Kyogoku Y. Kobayashi Y. Moroder L. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 649-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and thus, it is interesting to examine the effect of changing the cystine framework on folding and structure. Permuting the termini of acyclic derivatives of kalata B1 effectively alters the cystine framework, and thus, this study has broader implications than just for cystine knot peptides. We have previously reported the synthesis and folding of kalata B1 using two separate strategies (12.Daly N.L. Love S. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10606-10614Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), one in which the disulfide bonds were formed before cyclization, and the other in which cyclization preceded oxidation of the cysteine residues. These two strategies allowed a comparison of the folding of kalata B1 in the linear and cyclic forms. Cyclization appeared to have a dramatic effect on folding, as oxidation of cyclic-reduced kalata B1 produced the correctly folded peptide in aqueous solution, in contrast to the case for the linear form where oxidation in water produced mainly misfolded products. However, a significant proportion of correctly folded peptide was obtained from the linear precursor when oxidation reactions were performed in the presence of organic solvents. A hydrophobic solution environment appeared to be required to stabilize the surface-exposed hydrophobic residues that are formed upon folding into the native conformation (12.Daly N.L. Love S. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10606-10614Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Furthermore, hemolytic activity was observed for cyclized kalata B1 but not for the oxidized linear derivative (12.Daly N.L. Love S. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10606-10614Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). These results implied that cyclization was either very important for activity or that the particular backbone segment that was opened in the linear derivative was important for maintaining activity. It was evident that further linear analogues were required to resolve this question. In the current study we have synthesized the complete suite of topologically distinct acyclic permutants of kalata B1. The effects of acyclic permutation on folding, structure, and activity are examined. Permutants of kalata B1 were assembled using manual solid phase peptide synthesis with tert-butoxycarbonyl chemistry on a 0.5-mmol scale.p-Methylbenzhydrylamine or 4-(oxymethyl)phenylacetamidomethyl resin was used (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and amino acids were added to the resin using 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium with in situ neutralization (22.Schnölzer M. Alewood P. Jones A. Alewood D. Kent S.B.H. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1992; 40: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the peptide from the resin was achieved using hydrogen fluoride (HF) with cresol and thiocresol as scavengers (HF:cresol:thiocresol; 9:1:1 v/v). The reaction was allowed to proceed at −5–0 °C for 1 h. After cleavage, the peptides were dissolved in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and lyophilized. The crude, reduced peptides were purified using preparative reverse-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC)1 on a Vydac C18 column. Gradients of 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and 90% acetonitrile, 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid were employed with a flow rate of 8 ml/min, and the eluant was monitored at 230 nm. These conditions were used in the subsequent purification steps. Mass analysis was performed on a Sciex (Thornhill, Ontario) triple quadrupole mass spectrometer using electrospray sample ionization. Oxidation reactions were performed using the best conditions established for the cyclic peptide (12.Daly N.L. Love S. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10606-10614Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The purified reduced peptides were dissolved in 50% 2-propanol, 1–10 mm reduced glutathione in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.5). The reactions were left at room temperature for 24 h. The pH was lowered with trifluoroacetic acid before purification with RP-HPLC. Samples for 1H NMR measurements contained 1 mm peptide in either 99.99%2H2O or 90% H2O, 10%2H2O (v/v) at ∼pH 4.2H2O (99.9% and 99.99%) was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Woburn, MA. Spectra were recorded at 12 °C and 25 °C on a Bruker ARX-500 spectrometer equipped with a shielded gradient unit. Low temperature studies employed a temperature-controlled stream of cooled air using a Bruker BCU refrigeration unit and a B-VT 2000 control unit. Two-dimensional NMR spectra were recorded in phase-sensitive mode using time-proportional phase incrementation for quadrature detection in thet 1 dimension (23.Marion D. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3524) Google Scholar). The two-dimensional experiments included DQF-COSY (24.Rance M. Sørensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2596) Google Scholar), TOCSY (25.Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 521-528Crossref Scopus (3111) Google Scholar) using a MLEV-17 spin lock sequence (26.Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar) with a mixing time of 80 ms, and NOESY (27.Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4845) Google Scholar) with mixing times of 200 ms and 250 ms. For DQF-COSY experiments, solvent suppression was achieved using selective low power irradiation of the water resonance during a relaxation delay of 1.8 s. Solvent suppression for NOESY and TOCSY experiments was achieved using a modified WATERGATE (water suppression by gradient-tailored excitation) sequence (28.Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3538) Google Scholar). Spectra were routinely acquired over 6024 Hz with 4096 complex data points in F 2 and 512 increments in the F 1 dimension. Slowly exchanging NH protons were detected by acquiring a series of one-dimensional and TOCSY spectra of the fully protonated peptide immediately after dissolution in 2H2O. Exchange rates for amide protons were determined using these spectra, with the volumes measured using XWINNMR and normalized to a non-exchangeable proton. The exchange rates were calculated by fitting the volume of the decaying signals over time to the equation I = I oexp(−k ex × t) + I (∞) (29.Chakshusmathi G. Ratnaparkhi G.S. Madhu P.K. Varadarajan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7899-7904Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). 3 J αHNH coupling constants were measured either from one-dimensional spectra or from DQF-COSY spectra transformed to 8192 × 1024 over the region of interest. Spectra were processed on a Silicon Graphics Indigo workstation using XWINNMR (Bruker) software. The t 1 dimension was zero-filled to 2048 real data points, and 90° phase-shifted sine bell window functions were applied before Fourier transformation. Chemical shifts were referenced to DSS at 0.00 ppm. Human erythrocytes (blood group O) were washed several times with phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged at 3500 rpm until a clear supernatant was obtained. A 1% solution of the red blood cells in phosphate-buffered saline was used in the assays, which were performed by adding 20 μl of test compound to 80 μl of the 1% suspension of red blood cells. A 1% solution of SDS was used as a control for 100% hemolysis (30.Terras F.R.G. Schoofs H.M.E. De Bolle M.F.C. Van Leuven F. Rees S.B. Vanderleyden J. Cammue B.P.A. Broekaert W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15301-15309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mixtures were left at room temperature for 1 h and then centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 1 min. The supernatant (20 μl) was diluted with 580 μl of deionized (Milli-Q) water, and the absorbance was measured at 415 nm. There are six cysteine residues in peptides from the cyclotide family and, hence, six loops in the backbone that can be opened to form six topologically distinct acyclic permutants. We have synthesized a series of truncated acyclic permutants of kalata B1 in which each of the six loops has been opened to examine the effects of acyclic permutation on folding, structure, and activity. A schematic representation of the acyclic permutants is shown in Fig.2. In general the permutants were designed to include one residue adjacent to each of the two cysteine residues spanning the cut site, with any intervening residues deleted. However, in some cases only a single residue was deleted or the permutants contain the entire amino acid sequence of kalata B1 but are acyclic. The sequences and nomenclature of the seven permutants synthesized are shown in Table I. Since the parent protein is cyclic, the choice of the numbering system for amino acid residues is arbitrary, but we have followed that introduced earlier by Daly et al. (16.Daly N.L. Koltay A. Gustafson K., R. Boyd M.R. Casas-Finet J.R. Craik D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 333-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, since our focus here is on the concept of acyclic permutation, it is also convenient to refer to individual peptides via the backbone loop that is removed, (1–6), as summarized in Table I and Fig. 2. Single permutants were made for loops 1–5, and two acyclic permutants were made for loop 6: 6a, which corresponds to complete removal of the loop, and 6b, in which the loop is cut but no residues are removed.Table IAcyclic permutants of kalata B1The native sequence is backbone-cyclized. The N and C termini of the acyclic permutants are in bold. The nomenclature chosen describes the residues deleted, or in the case of the full length, non-cyclic permutants, the residue numbers of the N and C termini are in parentheses. The numbers in parentheses after the name of the permutant refer to the loop that is perturbed, with des-(23–28)-kalata B1 and kalata B1(24–23) designated 6a and 6b, respectively. Open table in a new tab The native sequence is backbone-cyclized. The N and C termini of the acyclic permutants are in bold. The nomenclature chosen describes the residues deleted, or in the case of the full length, non-cyclic permutants, the residue numbers of the N and C termini are in parentheses. The numbers in parentheses after the name of the permutant refer to the loop that is perturbed, with des-(23–28)-kalata B1 and kalata B1(24–23) designated 6a and 6b, respectively. All permutants, with the exception of kalata B1(8–7), i.e. 2, were synthesized on p-methylbenzhydrylamine resin to produce a C-terminal amide upon cleavage with HF. This peptide was available from a previous study (12.Daly N.L. Love S. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10606-10614Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) on the total chemical synthesis of kalata B1, where the linear peptide was synthesized with a free C terminus to allow cyclization. The N termini of the permutants were unprotected and, hence, positively charged. The permutants of kalata B1 were assembled using manual solid phase peptide synthesis and subsequently purified using RP-HPLC before oxidation. The oxidation conditions were chosen based on our previous studies (12.Daly N.L. Love S. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10606-10614Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) on the synthesis of kalata B1, which revealed that cyclic, reduced kalata B1 folds very efficiently in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8), 1 mm reduced glutathione in 50% (v/v) 2-propanol at room temperature. Applying these oxidation conditions to the folding of the kalata B1 permutants enabled a comparison of the efficiency of folding and allowed the effect of opening the loops of the parent circular molecule to be assessed. The HPLC traces used to monitor the folding reactions of the acyclic permutants of kalata B1 are given in Fig.3. We have shown previously (12.Daly N.L. Love S. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10606-10614Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) that correctly folded kalata B1 elutes significantly later than the reduced circular peptide because of a large patch of surface-exposed hydrophobic residues in the native conformation (10.Saether O. Craik D.J. Campbell I.D. Sletten K. Juul J. Norman D.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4147-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The RP-HPLC trace for folding of the circular form is, thus, included in Fig. 3 for comparison. Inspection of the traces for the new acyclic permutants shows that in all but two cases a sharp, late-eluting peak is observed together with a set of broader, earlier-eluting peaks. It appears likely that the sharp peaks (marked N* in Fig. 3) correspond to native-like folds and that the broader peaks correspond to misfolded derivatives. This interpretation is consistent with our earlier study (12.Daly N.L. Love S. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10606-10614Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) of kalata B1(8–7), which we used as a precursor in the synthesis of circular kalata B1. There we noted that linear kalata B1(8–7) displays similar HPLC properties to the cyclic peptide, in that the reduced form elutes much earlier than the correctly folded form, which yields a sharp, late-eluting peak. The misfolded forms had broad peaks that were poorly resolved and were much more hydrophilic than the correctly folded form, as shown by their shorter retention times. The absence of late-eluting peaks for des-3-kalata B1 (1) and des-(16)-kalata B1 (4) suggests that correctly folded peptides are not formed in these cases. In an attempt to find conditions where des-(3)-kalata B1 and des-(16)-kalata B1 produce a similar folding pattern to the other permutants and to the native peptide, several conditions were varied, including the buffer, temperature, length of oxidation, and presence of denaturants. However, the HPLC traces from these reactions did not differ significantly from those shown in Fig. 3. These results imply the regions between Cys-1 and Cys-5, and Cys-15 and Cys-17, which correspond to loops 1 and 4 (Table I), are structurally very important. Opening the peptide chain in these loop segments produces a fundamental change in the ability of the molecule to fold to a native-like conformation. By contrast, the other four loops can be cut and still allow folding into the native conformation. To further characterize the conformations of the folded forms associated with the late- eluting peaks, they were purified by RP-HPLC and studied by 1H NMR spectroscopy. TOCSY and NOESY spectra were recorded for the acyclic permutants2, 3, 5, 6a, and6b, and resonance assignments were obtained using established techniques (31.Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Chemical shifts are extremely sensitive to structural changes and, thus, an analysis of the chemical shifts was first used to compare the structures of the permutants. Fig. 4shows the differences in αH chemical shifts between the acyclic permutants and the native peptide. For most residues, the permutants have similar shifts to the native peptide, indicating that the overall three-dimensional structure is retained. This confirms the finding from the HPLC data that it is possible to produce correctly folded acyclic permutants. In general, the largest chemical shift differences are near the introduced termini, as might be expected because of the breakage of a peptide bond and the introduction of new charges; however, other differences also exist. The most significant are in kalata B1(24–23),i.e. 6b, the permuted derivative where loop 6 is opened. In this case the large chemical shift changes over residues 23–29 relative to the native peptide reflect an untethering of loop 6. The chemical shifts in this region of the acyclic permutant are much closer to random coil values than they are in the native peptide, consistent with local structuring of this region in the native circular protein but disorder in the open chain derivative. This conclusion is also consistent with the HPLC retention time for this permutant, which is significantly faster than for the native peptide despite having the same amino acid composition and with chemical shift data for the truncated permutant, 6a. Most of the residues in loop 6 are removed in the truncated permutant, and the expected large changes in chemical shifts occur at the new terminal residues, 23 and 29, but other residues are unaffected. Putting aside these local conformational changes due to the introduction of breaks in the circular protein backbone, the very significant finding to emerge from the αH chemical shift analysis is that the overall structures of the folded acyclic permutants are very similar to that of the native circular protein. Circularization is not essential for correct folding. Changes in βH chemical shifts were also found to be extremely useful for comparing structures of the permutants, particularly for Cys side-chain conformations. The chemical shift separation of the two β-protons in each AMX spin system in the permutants was measured, and the values were subtracted from the corresponding shift separations in the native peptide. The results are shown in Fig.5, but before examining these relative changes in βH shift separations, it is useful to examine the base-line values in the native peptide. In kalata B1 the βH chemical shift separations for individual AMX residues range from 0.0 ppm (Asn-11, Ser-13, Trp-19) to 1.20 ppm (Cys-15) and are typically 0.35 ± 0.1 ppm for the other Cys residues. In general, the larger the βH chemical shift separation for an individual methylene pair of protons, the more likely that pair is located in a highly structured environment. A decrease in shift separation in a permutant relative to the native peptide indicates a change to a more disordered environment. Fig. 5 shows that most of the changes in shift separations are indeed negative in sign, so that permutation does in general lead to decreased order in side-chain environments. The effects are very small for kalata B1(8–7) (2) and des-(19–20)-kalata B1 (5), whose βH shift separations are within 0.2 ppm of the native peptide, confirming that there are no significant structural changes associated with opening of loops 2 or 5. There are more significant differences for des-(12–13)-kalata B1 (3), des-(24–28)-kalata B1 (6a), and kalata B1(24–23) (6b), particularly at Cys-15. Opening of loop 3 or 6 thus appears to have a greater effect on disulfide bond geometry than does opening loop 2 or 5. Interestingly, increased βH shift separations are observed in most of the permutants for Cys-10 and Cys-22, which make up the “penetrating” disulfide bond. A range of additional structural data was also measured for the various permutants, including the location of hydrogen bonds, inferred from slow exchange amide data, long range αα NOEs indicative of β-sheet, and 3 J αHNH coupling constants indicative of β-strands.

Transduction of torque exerted by the rotating stalk on V0 requires a fixed structural link (stator) between the complexes to prevent energy loss through futile rotation of V1 relative to V0; this work sought to identify stator components. The 95-kDa V-ATPase subunit, Vph1p, has a cytosolic NH2terminus (Nt-Vph1p) and a membrane-associated COOH terminus. Two-hybrid assays demonstrated that Nt-Vph1p interacts with the catalytic V1 subunit, Vma1p. Co-immunoprecipitation of Vma1p with Nt-Vph1p confirmed the interaction. Expression of Nt-Vph1p in aΔvph1 mutant was necessary to recruit Vma13p to V1. Vma13p bound to Nt-Vph1p in vitrodemonstrating direct interaction.

Organellar acidification is essential for a variety of cellular processes such as receptor-mediated endocytosis, processing of proteins, intracellular degradation of ingested pathogens, and proton-coupled transport of small molecules (reviewed in Ref. 1.Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). V-ATPases are evolutionarily related to the mitochondrial F1F0 H+-ATPases (F-ATPases) (2.Gogarten J.P. Kibak H. Dittrich P. Taiz L. Bowman E.J. Bowman B.J. Manolson M.F. Poole R.J. Date T. Oshima T. Konishi J. Denda K. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6661-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Thus, the 2.8-Å resolution of the catalytic complex of the F-ATPase (3.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar) and experiments describing how intersubunit rotation leads to energy transduction in F-ATPases (4.Sabbert D. Engelbrecht S.

Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar) have provided significant insight into the structure and function of V-ATPases. V-ATPases have a similar bipartite structure to F-ATPases, consisting of a membrane bound proton channel (V0) and a peripherally bound catalytic core (V1). Electron microscopy reveals the V1 complex as a lollipop-like structure with a 6-nm long and 4-nm wide “central stalk” rising out of the membrane (6.Boekema E.J. Ubbink-Kok T. Lolkema J.S. Brisson A.

Biol. 1992; 172: 57-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ball is a hexamer composed of alternating 69- (Vma1p) and 60-kDa (Vma2p) subunits symmetrically arranged to form a hollow core through the middle of the sphere. Vma1p and Vma2p both contain consensus sequences for ATP-binding domains (9.Manolson M.F. Ouellette B.F. Filion M. Poole R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17987-17994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Bowman E.J. Tenney K. Bowman B.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1988; 263: 45-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) while Vma2p is thought to play a regulatory role (13.Manolson M.F. Rea P.A. Poole R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12273-12279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hollow core formed by the ATP-binding subunits contains a central stalk, the composition of which is still debated. Xu et al. (14.Xu T. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28909-28915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) propose that the central stalk is composed of just Vma7p (14 kDa) and Vma8p (32 kDa) while Tomasheket al. (15.Tomashek J.J. Graham L.A. Hutchins M.U. Stevens T.H. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26787-26793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) hypothesize that the structure also includes Vma4p (27 kDa) and Vma10p (16 kDa). The membrane-bound V0complex contains six copies of the 17-kDa proteolipid, Vma3p (16.Zhang J. Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23518-23523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), one copy of Vma6p (36 kDa), and at least one (17.Arai H. Terres G. Pink S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8796-8802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but possibly up to three copies (18.Supek F. Supekova L. Mandiyan S. Pan Y.C. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24102-24106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), of Vph1p (95 kDa). Vma11p (19.Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24526-24532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Vma16p (20.Apperson M. Jensen R.E. Suda K. Witte C. Yaffe M.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) are 17- and 23-kDa subunits with 56 and 35% amino acid identity to Vma3p, respectively. They are indispensable for V-ATPase activity, yet their role and stoichiometry in the V0 complex is unknown (21.Hirata R. Graham L.A. Taktsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In F-ATPases, ATP hydrolysis rotates a stalk structure composed of the γ subunit in a counterclockwise direction within the core of the catalytic hexamer (5.Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar). As energy coupling is thought to occur from the physical rotation of the stalk connecting the F1 and F0 complexes, a “stator”-like structure must exist to prevent the rotation of the catalytic hexamer with respect to the F0 complex. A stator (defined as the stationary portion of a motor, dynamo, or turbine) would have to be anchored within the membrane and extend up to the catalytic hexamer without interfering with the rotation of the stalk. Structural evidence supports the presence of this second structural link between the two sectors. Electron microscopy of Escherichia coli F-ATPases revealed the presence of two stalks, a central shaft as previously discussed, and a second peripheral stalk that extends from the side of the F1 complex down to the F0 complex (22.Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This second physical link between the two complexes is ideally suited to serve as a stator. Cross-linking studies suggest that the peripheral stalk structure is likely composed of the a, (b)2, and δ subunits (23.Ogilvie I. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16652-16656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 24.Rodgers A.J. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29406-29410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To date, the structure of the V-ATPase remains less well defined, however, the extensive homology between V- and F-ATPases suggests that the mechanical coupling of the V1 and V0complexes likely occurs by a method analogous to that described for F-ATPase. Visualization of bacterial and bovine V-ATPases by electron microscopy supports both the presence of a central shaft linking V1 to V0 and a peripheral stalk (13 nm long and 6.5 nm off-center from the central stalk) that appears to originate from the V0 complex and extend to the top of the V1 complex (6.Boekema E.J. Ubbink-Kok T. Lolkema J.S. Brisson A. Konings W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14291-14293Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 7.Wilkens S. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol.

Nature. 1999; 401: 37-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As there are no clear V-ATPase homologues for the F-ATPase a, b, or δ subunits, the components of the V-ATPase peripheral stalk are unknown. The function of the catalytic (Vma1p), regulatory (Vma2p), and proteolipid (Vma3p) subunits are reasonably established. The composition of the central stalk is suggested to be either Vma7p and Vma8p (14.Xu T. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28909-28915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), or Vma7p and Vma8p together with Vma4p and Vma10p (15.Tomashek J.J. Graham L.A. Hutchins M.U. Stevens T.H. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26787-26793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, four to six candidate subunits with unassigned function remain to form the second peripheral stalk or stator: Vma4p, Vma5p, Vma6p, Vma10p, Vma13p, and/or hydrophilic portions of Vph1p. The 95-kDa Vph1p subunit is unique to vacuolar H+-ATPases with no homologue found in any F-ATPase. Hydropathy analysis of Vph1p predicts two distinct structural domains; a hydrophilic NH2-terminal domain (∼45 kDa) and a hydrophobic COOH-terminal domain (∼50 kDa) containing up to 9 putative membrane-spanning regions (26.Leng X.H. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14655-14661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We have unambiguously localized the NH2 terminus of Vph1p to the cytosol, making this domain an ideal candidate to contribute to the formation of a peripheral stalk (27.Landolt-Marticorena C. Kahr W.H. Zawarinski P. Correa J. Manolson M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26057-26064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the NH2 terminus of Vph1p interacts with Vma1p and Vma13p, and present proteolytic evidence that suggests Vph1p is involved in coupling V1 ATP hydrolysis to V0 proton translocation. Zymolase was purchased from ICN Biochemicals and bafilomycin A1 from Kamiya Biomedical Co.

Additional transformed strains are described below. Wild type yeast cells were grown overnight in 1% yeast extract (Difco), 2% Bacto-peptone (Difco), and 2% dextrose (YEPD medium). The Δvma1p strains were grown in YEPD adjusted to pH 5.0 with HCl, because cells lacking vacuolar ATPase activity grow optimally in acidified medium (29.Liu J. Kane P.M.

It does not complement aΔvph1 mutation and the expected 55-kDa protein was barely detectable as assayed by immunoblotting. A 4.15-kilobaseXhoI-NotI fragment of pRS316-Nt-Vph1p cloned intoXhoI-NotI cut pRS426.

All components were obtained fromCLONTECH and all assays were carried out as suggested by the manufacturer. The bait, pAS2-1-Nt-Vph1p, was created as described above. The pACT yeast cDNA library was introduced the yeast reporter strain, Y190, and 5 × 106transformants were selected for tryptophan, leucine, and histidine prototrophy. Isolated colonies (100) were subsequently tested for β-galactosidase activity. Transformed cells were streaked onto sterile Whatman No. 1 filters and grown on selective media plates. Following colony growth, the filters were assayed for β-galactosidase activity. The cells were permeabilized by a freeze-thaw cycle. Filters were floated on liquid nitrogen for 20 s and allowed to thaw at room temperature. Each filter was soaked with 2 ml of Z-buffer (CLONTECHMatchmakerTM protocol manual) containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-β-d-galactosidase. The filters were placed in a covered plastic container and incubated at 37 °C for a maximum of 3 h. Yeast cells were grown overnight (to a concentration no greater than 1.4 × 107 cells/ml in selective medium), spun down, and resuspended at 3 × 107 cell/ml in 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm glycine-NaOH, pH 10, for 10 min at 30 °C.

Following confirmation of cell wall digestion, the spheroplasts were gently washed twice in 1.2 m sorbitol and resuspended at 1 × 108 cells/ml in solubilization buffer (phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 5.4 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4), 1%N-tetradecyl-N,N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1-propanesulfonate (ZW3–14), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm benzamidine, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml antipain, 20 μg/ml chymostatin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2 mm PMSF).

Bacterial cultures containing one of each of the three plasmids were grown overnight (37 °C at 300 rpm) in LB with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The cultures were diluted 1:20 in LB/ampicillin and grown (37 °C at 300 rpm) to A 600 = 0.6. Protein expression was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) for 4 h at 24 °C at 300 rpm. Cultures were cooled to 4 °C, the cells were pelleted (2540 ×g at 4 °C), washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and stored at −20 °C. Thawed pellets were resuspended in 50× in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.1 mm PMSF, 1 mg/ml chicken egg white lysozyme (Sigma)), incubated for 30 min at 24 °C, sonicated on ice, and centrifuged (2540 × g at 4 °C for 30 min). The supernatant resulting from the induction of pMN21 was aliquoted and stored at −20 °C. The supernatants resulting from the induction of the pET-based vectors were incubated (30 min at 24 °C) with Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). The resin was pelleted (45 × g) and washed (5 × 4 volumes) with wash buffer (50 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole). Resin-bound proteins were suspended (75% slurry) in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100), aliquoted, and stored at −20 °C. Ten μg of Ni-NTA-bound pET-32b and pET-Nt-Vph1p (as estimated by Coomassie staining) were each incubated for 30 min with 2 μl of induced supernatant containing Vma13p (described above) in a final volume of 75 μl of binding buffer. The resin was then pelleted (45 × g), the supernatant collected (unbound protein fraction), and the resin washed (5 × 4 volumes binding buffer). The bound proteins were then eluted from the Ni-NTA resin by boiling the resin in SDS sample buffer. The bound and unbound proteins from the pET-32b and pET-Nt-Vph1p affinity matrices and a sample of the induced supernatant containing Vma13p were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membrane was cut at 30 and 46 kDa and assessed with the following primary antibodies, <30 kDa 1:500 α-6xHis (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), 30–46 kDa 1:500 α-Vma13p (32.Ho M.N. Hirata R. Umemoto N.

Purified vacuolar membranes were subjected to controlled trypsin proteolysis in the following manner: 20 μg of purified vacuolar membranes in 25 mm MES/Tris, pH 7.8, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm ATP were incubated with 0.1 μg/ml trypsin at 37 °C for 30 min in a final reaction volume of 100 μl. Trypsin proteolysis was inhibited by the addition of PMSF to a final concentration of 1 mm andN α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) to a final concentration of 5 mmfollowed by incubation on ice for 15 min. Samples were utilized for activity assays as detailed below. Remaining samples were denatured by the addition of 5 × SDS sample buffer and assayed by SDS-PAGE (35.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) and immunoblotting as described (36.Olmsted J.B.

Purified vacuolar membranes were subjected to controlled trypsin proteolysis in the following manner: 20 μg of purified vacuolar membranes in 5 mm ATP, 25 mm MES/Tris, pH 7.8, and 25 mm KCl were incubated with either 0.1 or 1.0 μg/ml trypsin at 37 °C for 30 min in a final reaction volume of 100 μl. Trypsin proteolysis was inhibited as described above. Samples were denatured, assayed by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted as described above. ATPase assays and proton pumping activity were assayed on freshly prepared vacuolar membrane vesicles. Vesicles were trypzinised with 0.1 μg/ml in 25 mm MES/Tris, pH 7.8, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm ATP for 15 or 30 min at 37 °C. The final protein concentration was 0.2 μg/ml. Control samples were similarly treated excluding the addition of proteases. Trypsin activity was inhibited by the addition of PMSF (1 mm final concentration) and TLCK (5 mm, final concentration). Samples were incubated for 10 min on ice and trypsin-treated and control samples were assayed for ATPase and proton pumping activity. Proton pumping activity was measured by tracking the ATP-dependent quenching of acridine orange using a Perkin-Elmer 650-40 fluorescence spectrophotometer with emission at 545 nm and excitation at 493 nm. Assays were performed in a 1-ml volume of 25 mm MES/Tris, pH 7.2, 5 mm ATP, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm acridine orange, and 5 mm MgCl2. Acidification rate was defined as the slope of the quench during the first 10 s immediately after the addition of MgCl2; in all cases the first 10 s gave a linear response and was not limited by the formation of a proton-motive force.

NADPH stimulated the production of superoxide anion and H2O2 in human aortic endothelial cells that was inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium and was significantly attenuated in cells transiently expressing a dominant negative allele of the small GTP-binding protein Rac1, which is required for oxidase activity. In permeabilized Mag-indo 1-loaded cells, NADPH and H2O2 each decreased the threshold concentration of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) required to release intracellularly stored Ca2+ and shifted the InsP3-Ca2+ release dose-response curve to the left. Concentrations of H2O2 as low as 3 μm increased the sensitivity of intracellular Ca2+ stores to InsP3 and decreased the InsP3 EC50 from 423.2 ± 54.9 to 276.9 ± 14.4 nm. The effect of NADPH on InsP3-stimulated Ca2+ release was blocked by catalase and by diphenyleneiodonium and was not observed in cells lacking functional Rac1 protein.

To test this hypothesis, the effect of NADPH oxidase stimulation on intracellular Ca2+ stores was examined in permeabilized HAEC using the low affinity (micromolar range) Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent indicator Mag-indo 1. To characterize the specific role of NADPH oxidase stimulation, diphenyleneiodonium was used to pharmacologically inhibit the oxidase, and studies were performed using HAEC transiently expressing Rac1N17 (18.Irani K.

A vascular NADH/NADPH oxidase is a major source of reactive oxygen species in the vasculature (24.Griendling K.K. Minieri C.A. Ollerenshaw J.D. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 1141-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar), and previous studies have demonstrated the expression of one or more components of the NADPH oxidase in endothelial cells (1.Bayraktutan U.

Physiol. 1996; 271: H1626-H1634PubMed Google Scholar). Although it has been suggested that reactive oxygen species produced upon activation of the vascular oxidase may play a role in endothelial dysfunction (25.Harrison D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2153-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar, 26.Brandes R.P. Koddenberg G. Gwinner W. Kim D. Kruse H.J. Busse R. Mugge A.

Many stimuli that activate the oxidase increase endothelial [Ca2+]i, but this is the first study to show a direct effect of NADPH oxidase activation on endothelial Ca2+ signaling.In the present study, stimulation of the endothelial NADPH oxidase by NADPH (2.Jones S.A.

Physiol. 1994; 266: H2568-H2572PubMed Google Scholar) produced H2O2 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. That NADPH stimulated H2O2 production via NADPH oxidase activation is supported by the finding that H2O2 production was inhibited by DPI and was significantly reduced in cells lacking a functional GTP-binding protein Rac1, which is required for oxidase activity. NADPH oxidase stimulation generated O⨪2 in the present study, and this is most likely the source of oxidase-derived H2O2. Although neither NADPH nor H2O2 alone affected intracellular Ca2+ stores, each stimulated additional release of intracellular Ca2+ stores during an established response to a submaximal concentration of InsP3. In the presence of either H2O2 or NADPH, the threshold concentration of InsP3-stimulated intracellular Ca2+ release was decreased to <10 nm, the InsP3 dose-response curve was shifted to the left, and the EC50 to InsP3 was significantly decreased. Heparin, a competitive inhibitor of InsP3-induced Ca2+ release (28.Ghosh T.K. Eis P.S. Mullaney J.M. Ebert C.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11075-11079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), blocked the effect of H2O2 in the presence of a submaximal concentration of InsP3. This suggests that the addition of H2O2 or the generation of H2O2 by NADPH affects intracellular Ca2+ stores by increasing the sensitivity of the InsP3 receptor in HAEC. The finding that the effect of NADPH on the sensitivity of intracellular Ca2+ stores to InsP3 was blocked by catalase but was not affected by SOD suggests a specific effect of H2O2 on the InsP3 receptor. Redox sensitivity of the InsP3receptor has been reported previously in other cell types (16.Renard D.C. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Biochem J. 1992; 284: 507-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 17.Nomura T. Higashi K. Hoshino M. Saso K. Itou M. Hoek J.B. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1996; 20 (suppl.): 325A-329ACrossref Google Scholar).The present study suggests that small changes in the intracellular concentration of H2O2 are likely to have significant effects on InsP3-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores, given the effects on the EC50 of InsP3 of relatively small changes in the concentration of either H2O2 or NADPH. Such a narrow range between subthreshold and maximal responses suggests that the intracellular concentration of H2O2 is tightly regulated in vivo. Since the concentrations of H2O2 that are generated by vascular cells as a result of NADPH oxidase activation are not accurately known, it is difficult to determine how the concentrations of H2O2 observed following NADPH addition to permeabilized cell suspensions in the present study compare with that which occurs in vivo. Importantly, however, even concentrations of H2O2 in the low micromolar range increased the sensitivity of intracellular Ca2+stores to InsP3 in HAEC.Our data indicate that NADPH oxidase-derived H2O2 decreases the threshold concentration for intracellular Ca2+ release in endothelial cells to <10 nm InsP3. Since basal intracellular levels of InsP3 are in the 50 nm range (29.Missiaen L. Taylor C.W. Berridge M.J. J. Physiol. 1992; 455: 623-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 30.Zhao H. Khademazad M. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14822-14827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), stimuli that activate the oxidase may affect endothelial Ca2+signaling, even without altering levels of InsP3. It may be of interest in this regard that we recently showed that H2O2, at concentrations that do not increase levels of InsP3 (14.Vercellotti G.M. Severson S.P. Duane P. Moldow C.F. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1991; 117: 15-24PubMed Google Scholar), stimulate Ca2+oscillations in human endothelial cells (11.Hu Q. Corda S. Zweier J.L. Capogrossi M.C. Ziegelstein R.C. Circulation. 1998; 97: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Since intracellular Ca2+ oscillations can occur even at constant levels of InsP3 (31.Wakui M. Potter B.V. Petersen O.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), the increased sensitivity of intracellular Ca2+ stores to InsP3 resulting from NADPH oxidase activation may facilitate the generation of intracellular Ca2+ oscillations or the regulation of their frequency. Such an effect may underlie recent observations in platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated vascular smooth muscle cells. In this cell type, platelet-derived growth factor induces intracellular Ca2+ oscillations (32.Diliberto P.A. Gordon G. Herman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12612-12617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), generates O⨪2, and stimulates the activity of the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-κB (33.Marumo T. Schini-Kerth V.B. Fisslthaler B. Busse R. Circulation. 1997; 96: 2361-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB by platelet-derived growth factor is inhibited by both SOD and DPI, suggesting a link between NADPH oxidase activation and proinflammatory signaling pathways in the vasculature. Since the frequency of intracellular Ca2+oscillations regulates the activity of proinflammatory transcription factors like NF-κB (34.Dolmetsch R.E. Xu K. Lewis R.S.

Res. 1996; 20 (suppl.): 325A-329ACrossref Google Scholar), we hypothesized that activation of the NADPH oxidase affects endothelial Ca2+signaling by increasing the sensitivity of intracellular Ca2+ stores to InsP3-stimulated Ca2+ release. To test this hypothesis, the effect of NADPH oxidase stimulation on intracellular Ca2+ stores was examined in permeabilized HAEC using the low affinity (micromolar range) Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent indicator Mag-indo 1. To characterize the specific role of NADPH oxidase stimulation, diphenyleneiodonium was used to pharmacologically inhibit the oxidase, and studies were performed using HAEC transiently expressing Rac1N17 (18.Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J. Der C.J. Fearon E.R. Sundaresan M. Finkel T. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J.

DISCUSSIONThis study shows that NADPH oxidase activation stimulates the production of H2O2 and increases the sensitivity of intracellular Ca2+ stores to InsP3 in human endothelial cells. A vascular NADH/NADPH oxidase is a major source of reactive oxygen species in the vasculature (24.Griendling K.K. Minieri C.A. Ollerenshaw J.D. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 1141-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar), and previous studies have demonstrated the expression of one or more components of the NADPH oxidase in endothelial cells (1.Bayraktutan U.

Physiol. 1996; 271: H1626-H1634PubMed Google Scholar). Although it has been suggested that reactive oxygen species produced upon activation of the vascular oxidase may play a role in endothelial dysfunction (25.Harrison D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2153-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar, 26.Brandes R.P. Koddenberg G. Gwinner W. Kim D. Kruse H.J. Busse R. Mugge A.

Many stimuli that activate the oxidase increase endothelial [Ca2+]i, but this is the first study to show a direct effect of NADPH oxidase activation on endothelial Ca2+ signaling.In the present study, stimulation of the endothelial NADPH oxidase by NADPH (2.Jones S.A.

Physiol. 1994; 266: H2568-H2572PubMed Google Scholar) produced H2O2 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. That NADPH stimulated H2O2 production via NADPH oxidase activation is supported by the finding that H2O2 production was inhibited by DPI and was significantly reduced in cells lacking a functional GTP-binding protein Rac1, which is required for oxidase activity. NADPH oxidase stimulation generated O⨪2 in the present study, and this is most likely the source of oxidase-derived H2O2. Although neither NADPH nor H2O2 alone affected intracellular Ca2+ stores, each stimulated additional release of intracellular Ca2+ stores during an established response to a submaximal concentration of InsP3. In the presence of either H2O2 or NADPH, the threshold concentration of InsP3-stimulated intracellular Ca2+ release was decreased to <10 nm, the InsP3 dose-response curve was shifted to the left, and the EC50 to InsP3 was significantly decreased. Heparin, a competitive inhibitor of InsP3-induced Ca2+ release (28.Ghosh T.K. Eis P.S. Mullaney J.M. Ebert C.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11075-11079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), blocked the effect of H2O2 in the presence of a submaximal concentration of InsP3. This suggests that the addition of H2O2 or the generation of H2O2 by NADPH affects intracellular Ca2+ stores by increasing the sensitivity of the InsP3 receptor in HAEC. The finding that the effect of NADPH on the sensitivity of intracellular Ca2+ stores to InsP3 was blocked by catalase but was not affected by SOD suggests a specific effect of H2O2 on the InsP3 receptor. Redox sensitivity of the InsP3receptor has been reported previously in other cell types (16.Renard D.C. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Biochem J. 1992; 284: 507-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 17.Nomura T. Higashi K. Hoshino M. Saso K. Itou M. Hoek J.B. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1996; 20 (suppl.): 325A-329ACrossref Google Scholar).The present study suggests that small changes in the intracellular concentration of H2O2 are likely to have significant effects on InsP3-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores, given the effects on the EC50 of InsP3 of relatively small changes in the concentration of either H2O2 or NADPH. Such a narrow range between subthreshold and maximal responses suggests that the intracellular concentration of H2O2 is tightly regulated in vivo. Since the concentrations of H2O2 that are generated by vascular cells as a result of NADPH oxidase activation are not accurately known, it is difficult to determine how the concentrations of H2O2 observed following NADPH addition to permeabilized cell suspensions in the present study compare with that which occurs in vivo. Importantly, however, even concentrations of H2O2 in the low micromolar range increased the sensitivity of intracellular Ca2+stores to InsP3 in HAEC.Our data indicate that NADPH oxidase-derived H2O2 decreases the threshold concentration for intracellular Ca2+ release in endothelial cells to <10 nm InsP3. Since basal intracellular levels of InsP3 are in the 50 nm range (29.Missiaen L. Taylor C.W. Berridge M.J. J. Physiol. 1992; 455: 623-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 30.Zhao H. Khademazad M. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14822-14827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), stimuli that activate the oxidase may affect endothelial Ca2+signaling, even without altering levels of InsP3. It may be of interest in this regard that we recently showed that H2O2, at concentrations that do not increase levels of InsP3 (14.Vercellotti G.M. Severson S.P. Duane P. Moldow C.F. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1991; 117: 15-24PubMed Google Scholar), stimulate Ca2+oscillations in human endothelial cells (11.Hu Q. Corda S. Zweier J.L. Capogrossi M.C. Ziegelstein R.C. Circulation. 1998; 97: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Since intracellular Ca2+ oscillations can occur even at constant levels of InsP3 (31.Wakui M. Potter B.V. Petersen O.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), the increased sensitivity of intracellular Ca2+ stores to InsP3 resulting from NADPH oxidase activation may facilitate the generation of intracellular Ca2+ oscillations or the regulation of their frequency. Such an effect may underlie recent observations in platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated vascular smooth muscle cells. In this cell type, platelet-derived growth factor induces intracellular Ca2+ oscillations (32.Diliberto P.A. Gordon G. Herman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12612-12617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), generates O⨪2, and stimulates the activity of the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-κB (33.Marumo T. Schini-Kerth V.B. Fisslthaler B. Busse R. Circulation. 1997; 96: 2361-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB by platelet-derived growth factor is inhibited by both SOD and DPI, suggesting a link between NADPH oxidase activation and proinflammatory signaling pathways in the vasculature. Since the frequency of intracellular Ca2+oscillations regulates the activity of proinflammatory transcription factors like NF-κB (34.Dolmetsch R.E. Xu K. Lewis R.S.

For hCaR, a model of the VFT domain begins at amino acid Gly36 and ends at amino acid Val513 (17.Ray K. Hauschild B.C. Steinbach P.J. Goldsmith P.K. Hauache O. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27642-27650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). The majority of naturally occurring activating and inactivating mutations identified in patients with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia cluster in this region. This region also contains multiple aspartates and glutamates possibly involved in low affinity calcium binding. Between VFT domain and 7 TM domain, a Cys-rich region with nine highly conserved cysteines in a closely spaced (about 60-amino acid-long) sequence is present in all of the members of family 3 except GABABR1 (Fig. 1 B). Aside from the nine cysteines, the majority of other residues in this region are not conserved in family 3 members. It is speculated that multiple intramolecular disulfide bonds are formed within this region, which may give rise to a separate and tightly packed domain (Cys-rich domain) in ECD. A recent report (19.Okamoto T. Sekiyama N. Otsu M. Shimada Y. Sato A. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13089-13096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) showed that truncated forms of mGluR1 receptor containing ECD without the Cys-rich domain did not express well and showed no significant ligand binding, while other truncated receptors containing whole ECD with Cys-rich domain expressed well and bound the ligand. It was speculated that mGluR1 Cys-rich domain might impose a structural constraint on the receptor. Other than this, little is known about the function of this Cys-rich domain. Previous results from our laboratory showed that substitution of any of the nine cysteines in this domain in hCaR by serine causes loss of receptor function (20.Fan G.F. Ray K. Zhao X.M. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. FEBS. 1998; 436: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Mutants failed to express at the cell surface, possibly due to misfolding or incomplete processing of the receptor. C582Y, a naturally occurring inactivating mutation of the hCaR, was identified in a subject with neonatal severe primary hyperparathyroidism (21.Pearce S.H. Trump D. Wooding C. Besser G.M. Chew S.L. Grant D.B. Heath D.A. Hughes I.A. Paterson C.R. Whyte M.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2683-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), indicating the structural importance of one of these nine cysteines. In contrast to VFT domain, very few naturally occurring mutations, only C582Y (21.Pearce S.H. Trump D. Wooding C. Besser G.M. Chew S.L. Grant D.B. Heath D.A. Hughes I.A. Paterson C.R. Whyte M.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2683-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and G549R (22.Li, L. D., Cole, D. E. C., Hanley, D. A., Kooh, S. W., Salisbury, S., Juppner, H., and Hendy, G. N. (1998) ASBMR-IBMS Second Joint Meeting, San Francisco, December 1–6, 1998, abstr. W350, American Society for Bone and Mineral Research-International Bone and Mineral SocietyGoogle Scholar), have been identified so far in the hCaR Cys-rich domain. Given the lack of information on the function of the Cys-rich domain and the dearth of naturally occurring mutations in this domain, we set out to address two questions. Is the Cys-rich domain required for activation of hCaR by [Ca2+]o? If required, is the specific hCaR sequence of the Cys-rich domain (other than the nine highly conserved cysteines) critical? To address these questions, we constructed a series of chimeric hCaRs as well as a Cys-rich deletion mutant hCaR and analyzed their expression and function. The hCaR cDNA cloned in the pCR3.1 expression vector was described previously (23.Ray K. Fan G.F. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31355-31361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and was kindly provided by Dr. Kausik Ray. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mutagenic oligonucleotide primer pair for introducing a Phe539 to Arg mutation in hCaR was 5′-GGGTTCTCCAGGGAGGTGCCGCGGTCCAACTGCAGCCGAGACTGC-3′ and 5′-GCAGTCTCGGCTGCAGTTGGACCGCGGCACCTCCCTGGAGAACCC-3′. The primer pair for introducing the Glu602-Ile603-Glu604 to Pro-Val-Arg mutation in hCaR was 5′-CCACACCTCCTGCATTGCCAAGCCCGTACGGTTTCTGTCGTGGACGGAGC-3′ and 5′-GCTCCGTCCACGACAGAAACCGTACGGGCTTGGCAATGCAGGAGGTGTGG-3′. Parental hCaR cDNA in pCR3.1 vector was amplified usingPfu Turbo DNA polymerase with these primers for 16 cycles in a DNA thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer). After digestion of the parental DNA with DpnI for 1 h, the amplified DNA with incorporated nucleotide substitution was transformed into E. coli (XL-1 blue or DH-5α strain). The mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing using a dRhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit and ABI prism-373A DNA sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sense primer 5′-GATCCCGCGGTCTAACTGCAGCGAGGACTGC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-GACTCGTACGGGCTTCAGAAAGCAGAAGGTGTGG-3′ were used to amplify Fugu CaR Cys-rich sequence with incorporation of SacII andBsiWI sites at its 5′- and 3′-end respectively. Sense primer 5′-GATCCCGCGGTCTGTGTGCAGTGAGCCTTGC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-GACTCGTACGGGAATGGGCTCACAGCCTGTG-3′ were used to amplify mGluR1 Cys-rich sequence with incorporation of SacII andBsiWI sites at its 5′- and 3′-end respectively. mGluR1 cDNA cloned in pcDNA1 expression vector was kindly provided by Dr. Robert Wenthold. Sense primer 5′-GACTCGTACGTTATCTTGAGTGGAGTGACATAG-3′ and antisense primer 5′-GATACTCGAGTCACTACAGGGTGGAAGAGCTTTGC-3′ were used to amplify mGluR1 7 TM plus C-tail with incorporation of BsiWI andXhoI sites at its 5′- and 3′-end, respectively. Primer pairs 5′-GATCCCGCGGGCAGCAGCTGCAGCCGTACGAGTC-3′ and 5′-GACTCGTACGGCTGCAGCTGCTGCCCGCGGGATC-3′ were annealed to form a linker adaptor with SacII and BsiWI sites at its 5′- and 3′-end, respectively, and coding sequence for five alanines in between. All of the polymerase chain reaction products and the synthetic fragment were digested by unique restriction enzymes and subsequently cloned into hCaR receptor at matching sites, as explained under “Results.” Transfections were performed using 13 μg of plasmid DNA for single plasmid transfection or 6.5 μg of DNA of each of two different plasmids in co-transfection in each 75-cm2flask of HEK-293 cells. DNA was diluted in serum-free DMEM (BioFluids Inc., Rockville, MD) and mixed with diluted Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The DNA-Lipofectamine complex was further diluted in 6 ml of serum-free DMEM and was added to 80% confluent HEK-293 cells plated in 75-cm2 flasks. After 5 h of incubation, 15 ml of complete DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (BioFluids) was added. 24 h after transfection, transfected cells were split and cultured in complete DMEM. 48 h after transfection, cell surface proteins of the intact HEK-293 cells were labeled with membrane-impermeant Biotin-7-NHS using the Cellular Labeling Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Briefly, adherent cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and treated with 50 μg/ml Biotin-7-NHS in biotinylation buffer (50 mm sodium borate, 150 mm NaCl) for 15 min at room temperature to biotinylate cell surface proteins. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 mm NH4Cl and incubated for 15 min on ice. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized with 1 ml of lysis buffer per well containing 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, freshly added 50 mm iodoacetamide (Sigma), and freshly added protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 600 μg of total protein of the whole cell lysate was incubated with either 5 μg of 7F8 mouse monoclonal hCaR-specific antibody (raised against the purified hCaR ECD) or 5 μg of affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal hCaR-specific antibody GGD (raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 1037–1050 of the hCaR) for 1–2 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, 25 μl of protein A/G-agarose (for 7F8) or protein A-agarose (for GGD) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 1–2 h at 4 °C. The protein A/G- or protein A-agarose was washed three times with lysis buffer containing 0.1% SDS, and the immunoreactive proteins bound on agarose were eluted in 100 μl of 1× sample buffer containing either no β-mercaptoethanol or 300 mm β-mercaptoethanol at room temperature for 5 min. 50 μl of sample was loaded per lane, and immunoblotting was performed as described below. Confluent cells in 75-cm2 flasks or six-well plates were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped on ice in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, freshly added 50 mm iodoacetamide (Sigma), and freshly added protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The protein content in each sample was determined by the modified Bradford method (Bio-Rad), and 40–60 μg of protein per lane was separated on 5% SDS-PAGE gel. The proteins on the gel were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with 0.1 μg/ml of protein A-purified mouse monoclonal anti-hCaR antibody ADD (raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 214–235 of hCaR protein). Subsequently, the membrane was incubated with a secondary goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) at a dilution of 1:5000. The hCaR protein was detected with an ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Biotinylated proteins were detected using peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) followed by visualization of the biotinylated bands using the same ECL kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Densitometry was performed by using GelExpert software (NucleoTech Corp.), and results were expressed as ratio of mutant to wild type (WT) hCaR. Note that only the density of upper band of CaR immunoreactants on the blot was analyzed, since this was previously shown to correspond to cell surface expression (23.Ray K. Fan G.F. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31355-31361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The PI hydrolysis assay has been described previously (23.Ray K. Fan G.F. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31355-31361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, 24 h after transfection, transfected cells from a confluent 75-cm2 flask were split. Typically, one-eighth of cells were plated in one well in a six-well plate, and whole cell lysate was prepared 48 h post-transfection for Western blot assay. Remaining cells were plated in two 12-well plates in complete DMEM containing 3.0 μCi/ml of [3H]myoinositol (NEN Life Science Products) and cultured for another 24 h. Culture medium was replaced by 1× PI buffer (120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5.6 mmglucose, 0.4 mm MgCl2, 20 mm LiCl in 25 mm PIPES buffer, pH 7.2) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After removal of PI buffer, cells were incubated for an additional 1 h with different concentrations of Ca2+in 1× PI buffer. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 1 ml of acid-methanol (1:1000, v/v) per well. Total inositol phosphates were purified by chromatography on Dowex 1-X8 columns, and radioactivity for each sample was counted with liquid scintilator counter. Graphs of concentration dependence for stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis by [Ca2+]o for each transfection were drawn by using GraphPad Prism version 2.0 software. Each value on a curve is the mean of duplicate determinations. Graphs shown in this paper were representative ones from at least three independent experiments. The Cys-rich sequence alignment (Fig. 1 B) shows that although the overall amino acid sequence homology among members in family 3 of GPCRs is low, all nine cysteines in the Cys-rich region are strictly conserved in the hCaR, Fugu CaR, mGluR1, putative pheromone receptors, and putative taste receptors but not in GABABR1, which completely lacks these cysteines. To test if the hCaR Cys-rich domain is tolerant of amino acid changes in residues other than the conserved cysteines, we constructed hCaR/Fugu CaR and hCaR/mGluR1 Cys-rich domain chimeras, taking advantage of the fact that all nine cysteines in Cys-rich domain are strictly conserved among hCaR, Fugu CaR, and mGluR1, while multiple noncysteine amino acid differences exist in this domain. To facilitate making the chimeras, we introduced unique restriction sites for SacII and BsiWI to flank the nine cysteines in hCaR. Site-directed mutagenesis was applied to mutate Phe539 to arginine with incorporation of a SacII restriction site, which was followed by a second round of mutation changing amino acids Glu602-Ile603-Glu604 to Pro-Val-Arg with incorporation of a unique BsiWI site, which gave rise to a mutant hCaR termed hCaR/SB. Note that in addition to the incorporated new restriction sites, the amino acid substitutions in hCaR/SB change hCaR residues Phe539 and Glu602-Ile603-Glu604 to the corresponding residues of mGluR1. We transfected hCaR/SB DNA into HEK-293 cells and analyzed mutant and wild type receptor expression on immunoblots stained with anti-hCaR monoclonal antibody ADD to detect total hCaR immunoreactive species. Fig. 2shows, under reducing conditions, ADD antibody detected two major bands in size of about 130 and 150 kDa for both WT hCaR and hCaR/SB at comparable expression levels. Previous studies have shown that the monomeric ∼150-kDa band represents hCaR forms expressed at the cell surface and modified with N-linked, complex carbohydrates; the ∼130-kDa band represents high mannose-modified forms, trapped intracellularly and sensitive to Endo-H digestion (23.Ray K.

We tested whether the mutant receptor is capable of signal transduction by using the intact cell [Ca2+]o-stimulated PI hydrolysis assay. Fig. 2 shows that hCaR/SB's maximal responses to [Ca2+]o and EC50 were identical to those of WT hCaR, indicating that the four amino acid changes did not change the receptor's response to [Ca2+]o. We amplified by polymerase chain reaction the corresponding Fugu CaR and mGluR1 Cys-rich sequence using primers with the same mutations forSacII site and BsiWI site at their 5′- and 3′-end, respectively, and cloned into hCaR/SB to replace the hCaR Cys-rich sequence. In the hCaR/Fugu Cys-rich chimera (Ca-Fugu-Ca; note that in this and other chimeras we designate the source of the VFT/Cys-rich/7 TM plus C-tail domains), 20 of 53 non-cysteine amino acids were substituted in the Cys-rich domain (Fig. 1 B). Subsequent transient expression and PI hydrolysis assay showed that the chimera was well expressed in HEK-293 cells and was fully functional if compared with WT hCaR (Fig. 3). In hCaR/mGluR1 Cys-rich chimera (Ca-Glu-Ca), 40 of 53 non-cysteine amino acids were substituted in the same region (Fig. 1 B). Transient expression in HEK-293 cells shows this chimera's mobility was altered on a SDS-PAGE gel, and it was expressed at a lower level than that of WT hCaR when an equal amount of cDNAs was used for transfection (Fig. 4; also see Figs.5 and 8). Densitometry analysis of blots in Figs. 4, 5, and 8 showed the protein expression ratios of Ca-Glu-Ca/WT hCaR were 0.80, 0.71, and 0.52). PI assay shows that the chimera's function was severely compromised, but it was still partially functional at high concentrations of [Ca2+]o. Its EC50 was significantly right-shifted from 4 mm to more than 10 mm. As an indirect test of the folding and function of VFT domain and 7 TM domain of this chimera, we superimposed L125P (a naturally occurring gain of function mutation in the VFT domain of the hCaR) (26.Nakae J. Shinohara N. Tanahashi Y. Murashita M. Abe S. Hasegawa T. Hasegawa Y. Fujieda K. Horm. Res. 1998; 48: 179Google Scholar) and F788C (a naturally occurring gain of function mutation in the fifth transmembrane domain of the hCaR) (27.Watanabe T. Bai M. Lane C.R. Matsumoto S. Minamitani K.

Thus, some of the 24 amino acids that are conserved between hCaR and Fugu CaR but changed in mGluR1 appear to be critical for the normal function of the hCaR Cys-rich domain. Inspection of this sequence showed that among those 24 amino acids, there is one postulated glycosylation site (Asn541) (25.Ray K. Clapp P. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34558-34567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and two acidic residues (Glu567 and Asp587) that could be involved in low affinity calcium binding. We individually changed back the glycosylation site and two acidic residues by site-directed mutagenesis but found that none of these changes were able to restore the chimera's response to [Ca2+]o toward WT hCaR (data not shown).Figure 5Concentration dependence for [Ca2+]o stimulation of PI hydrolysis (left) and immunoblot of CaR (right) in transiently transfected HEK-293 cells expressing WT hCaR , WT mGluR1 , and three chimeric receptors (Ca-Ca-Glu, Ca-Glu-Glu, and Ca-Glu-Ca).

We have evaluated the effects of the interaction of amphipols with sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase either in a membrane-bound or a soluble form. If the addition of amphipols to detergent-solubilized ATPase was followed by removal of detergent, soluble complexes formed, but these complexes retained poor ATPase activity, were not very stable upon long incubation periods, and at high concentrations they experienced aggregation. Nevertheless, adding excess detergent to diluted detergent-free ATPase-amphipol complexes incubated for short periods immediately restored full activity to these complexes, showing that amphipols had protected solubilized ATPase from the rapid and irreversible inactivation that otherwise follows detergent removal. Amphipols also protected solubilized ATPase from the rapid and irreversible inactivation observed in detergent solutions if the ATPase Ca2+ binding sites remain vacant. Moreover, in the presence of Ca2+, amphipol/detergent mixtures stabilized concentrated ATPase against inactivation and aggregation, whether in the presence or absence of lipids, for much longer periods of time (days) than detergent alone.

Thus, detergents are generally used to facilitate the handling of these proteins in aqueous media (1.Møller J.V. le Maire M. Andersen J.P. Progress in Protein-Lipid Interactions. 2. Elsevier Science Publishers BV, Amsterdam1986: 147-196Google Scholar). However, detergents do not always maintain solubilized membrane proteins in an active and stable state (see Refs. 2.Lund S.

The use of short amphipathic polymers (“amphipols”), comprising a hydrophilic backbone with hydrophobic chains, has been proposed as an alternative approach (4.Tribet C. Audebert R. Popot J.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15047-15050Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Amphipols can interact with hydrophobic surfaces at many points along their length. They should therefore form a noncovalent but stable layer at the interface between the transmembrane region of the protein and the aqueous solution. Initial studies with four integral membrane proteins showed that complexes of these proteins with amphipols could indeed be handled in surfactant-free aqueous solutions as if they were soluble proteins (4.Tribet C.

Biochimie. 1998; 80: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); back-exchange between amphipols and detergents was also demonstrated (5.Tribet C. Audebert R. Popot J.-L. Langmuir. 1997; 13: 5570-5576Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar), but its kinetics was not studied. Amphipols have a wide range of potential applications in biochemistry, biophysics, and biotechnology. Little is known, however, about their effects on membrane protein function. Published data are limited to cytochromeb 6 f, which was shown to retain its ability to catalyze electron transfer following injection of cytochrome b 6 f-amphipol complexes into a detergent-containing reaction medium (4.Tribet C. Audebert R. Popot J.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15047-15050Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Various degrees of inhibition were nevertheless observed, depending on the charge of the amphipols. This inhibition was hypothesized to be due to the electrostatic repulsion of one of the substrates of the reaction, but other effects of amphipols on function, an essential determinant of their usefulness in membrane biology, remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the interaction of amphipols (mainly amphipol A8-35, a polyacrylate backbone derivatized with octyl and isopropyl chains) with the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)1 Ca2+-ATPase from rabbit skeletal muscle. This enzyme, a P-type ATPase, is responsible for active calcium transport from the cytosol to the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (7.Inesi G. Lewis D. Nikic D. Hussain A. Kirtley M.E. Adv.

In addition to its transmembrane region, it has a bulky cytosolic region that is critical for catalytic activity.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2558-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The ATPase is highly sensitive to the nature of its hydrophobic environment; it may aggregate, and changes in its aggregation state may be associated with a reversible or irreversible loss of protein activity. Thus, Ca2+-ATPase is an appropriate model for studying the functional consequences of protein dispersion using amphipols. We first briefly characterized the interaction of amphipols with intact SR membranes. We then studied the effects of the association of amphipols with solubilized ATPase, with special emphasis on the complexes formed upon subsequent removal of detergent. In some respects, functional and structural properties of these complexes were not up to our expectations, particularly as regards monodispersity of the complexes. However, we also observed that, in the presence of both amphipol and detergent, the ATPase was much more stable than when it was exposed to either of the surfactants alone (in the presence or absence of calcium), and it remained monomeric for longer periods of time. These synergistic effects provide evidence for the rapid formation of a mixed detergent/amphipol layer at the hydrophobic surface of the protein. The remarkable protective effect of amphipols may be of particular value in studies of membrane protein states prone to rapid denaturation. A general description of amphipol synthesis and use has already been published (4.Tribet C. Audebert R. Popot J.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15047-15050Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 12.Wang T.K. Iliopoulos I. Audebert R. Polym. Bull. 1988; 20: 577-582Crossref Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Most experiments in this work were performed using amphipol A8-35 (4.Tribet C. Audebert R. Popot J.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15047-15050Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). A8-35 (SchemeFS1) is an anionic polymer with a mean apparent molecular mass of 8 kDa, prepared by forming amide bonds between hydrophobic amines and the carboxyl groups of polyacrylic acid precursors, with about 35% (mol/mol) of the carboxyl groups in the sodium carboxylate form. On average, 24 carboxylic groups in the polymer molecule are free, 18 have reacted with octylamine, and the remaining 28 have reacted with isopropylamine (Scheme FS1). These values are means for a polydisperse population of molecules, some of which have chains with more or fewer acrylic acid units than the mean value of 70 determined by gel filtration of the polyacrylic precursor (4.Tribet C. Audebert R. Popot J.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15047-15050Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The A8-35 stock solution was 50 mg/ml in water. The nonionic detergents C12E8 and DM were obtained from Nikko and Calbiochem (or Anatrace), respectively. Their critical micellar concentrations and approximate aggregation numbers are about 0.05 mg/ml (0.09 mm) and 100–120, and 0.09 mg/ml (0.18 mm) and 110–140, respectively (23.Møller J.V. le Maire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18659-18672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dispersion state of amphipol polymers in buffer has not yet been described. SR vesicles were prepared as described previously (13.Champeil P. Guillain F. Vénien C. Gingold M.P. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Deoxycholate (DOC)-purified membrane-bound ATPase was a gift from Prof. J. V. Møller and was obtained by treating SR vesicles with a low concentration of deoxycholate (16.Meissner G. Conner G.E. Fleischer S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 298: 246-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Unilamellar liposomes were a gift from A. Bluzat and were prepared from egg yolk phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidic acid (9/1, w/w) by reverse phase evaporation (14.Paternostre M.T. Roux M. Rigaud J.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 1988 27: 2668-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). For several of the experiments described below, the aqueous medium contained 100 mm KCl, 1 mm Mg2+, 0.1 mm Ca2+, and 50 mm TES-Tris at pH 7.5 (20 °C). This medium is referred to as the “TES 7.5 medium.” In particular, it was used to assess the solubilization of SR membranes and liposomes, from light-scattering measurements (Refs.11.de Foresta B. le Maire M.

Naturforsch. 1982; 37c: 513-516Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar, and Fig. 1 C), and the hydrolytic activity of the SR Ca2+-ATPase. The elution buffer for HPLC was slightly different, and contained 100 mm KCl, 1 mm Mg2+, 0.5 mm Ca2+, and 20 mm TES-NaOH at pH 7. It is referred to as the “TES 7.0” medium. This medium was used as the initial solubilization medium in all experiments in which the ATPase was subsequently delipidated. The hydrolytic activity of the SR Ca2+-ATPase was determined at 20 °C with a coupled enzyme assay (2.Lund S. Orlowski S. de Foresta B. Champeil P. le Maire M. Møller J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4907-4915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Møller J.V. Lind K.E. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1912-1920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in 2 ml of TES 7.5 medium supplemented with 5 mm MgATP, 0.05 mg/ml pyruvate kinase, 1 mm PEP, 0.05 mg/ml lactate dehydrogenase, and an initial concentration of about 0.3 mmNADH. The hydrolytic activity of membrane-bound ATPase (Fig.1 A) was assayed in the presence or absence of the ionophore A23187 (Calbiochem). The hydrolytic activity of solubilized ATPase was assayed in the presence of various concentrations of C12E8 (Fig. 2) or DM (Fig. 4). Excess C12E8 (1 mg/ml final concentration) was also used to determine the proportion of ATPase molecules that had escaped irreversible inactivation during preliminary incubation (Figs. 3, 11,12, and 14; see also Ref. 2.Lund S. Orlowski S. de Foresta B. Champeil P. le Maire M. Møller J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4907-4915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In all cases, the final SR protein concentration during the ATPase assay was 0.002 mg/ml. At this low concentration of protein, the final concentrations of DM and amphipol resulting from dilution of the initial samples are very low, and should not themselves affect ATPase activity significantly, either in detergent-free assay medium or in the presence of 1 mg/ml C12E8. For all figures, the low (about 0.2 μmol·mg−1·min−1) Ca2+-independent ATPase activity observed in the presence of excess EGTA was subtracted.Figure 4Diluted ATPase-amphipol complexes recover activity with low concentrations of DM , whereas very high concentrations are inhibitory. HPLC-delipidated ATPase was incubated in the presence of DM and amphipol A8-35 (1 mg/ml ATPase, 2 mg/ml DM, and 5 mg/ml A8-35, open squares) and subsequently diluted with ATPase assay medium (4 μl in 2 ml). Various concentrations of DM were then sequentially added, with NADH oxidation recorded continuously to monitor ATPase activity. In a control experiment (open circles), permeabilized SR vesicles were used instead of ATPase·DM·A8-35 complexes (in this case, the diluted sample consisted of 0.002 mg/ml SR protein (without DM or A8-35) to which 1 μg/ml A23187 had been added).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Protection conferred by amphipol A8-35 against the irreversible inactivation of solubilized ATPase induced by its dilution with detergent-free medium.

Aliquots (4 μl) of these samples were diluted in 2 ml of ATPase assay medium, which either was detergent-free (right traces) or contained 1 mg/ml C12E8 from the start (left traces). NADH absorbance was recorded to monitor ATPase activity. Various additions were also made, as indicated (arrows): 1 mm EGTA and 1 mm extra Ca2+ (for panels A and B), and 1 mg/ml C12E8 at the end for thetraces on the right. Panel C, HPLC-delipidated ATPase was used for a similar experiment. The initial sample contained 0.2 mg/ml delipidated ATPase, 0.4 mg/ml DM, and 1 mg/ml A8-35, and was diluted for ATPase assay (20 μl in 2 ml).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 11C12E8-induced activity recovery for Bio-Bead-treated (A) or diluted (B) ATPase· A8-35 complexes, after incubation for various periods in the presence of different concentrations of A8-35 or DM. Panel A, delipidated ATPase (0.5 mg/ml) was incubated with DM (0.75 mg/ml) in TES 7.0 medium along with various concentrations of A8-35 (from 0.125 to 1 mg/ml, as indicated) and the mixture was then incubated with Bio-Beads for 1 h 45 min. This resulted in low DM concentrations, here notedε(BB). The samples were then incubated at 20 °C and aliquots (8 μl) were taken after various periods during the course of several days, to measure residual ATPase activity after dilution with 2 ml of medium containing 1 mg/ml C12E8. Delipidated ATPase (0.5 mg/ml) was also incubated with DM (1 mg/ml) and A8-35 (2.5 mg/ml), treated with Bio-Beads for 3 h 20 min, and residual ATPase activity was measured 3 h later in the presence of 1 mg/ml C12E8 (square and dotted arbitrary line). Panel B, instead of being treated with Bio-Beads, an ATPase·DM·A8-35 sample (0.5/1/1) was diluted 1:50 in detergent-free TES 7.0 medium, such that the final concentration of DM dropped to 0.02 mg/ml (and that of ATPase to 0.01 mg/ml). This sample was incubated for several days at 20 °C, either in this form (rightside-up triangles) or in the presence of 0.06 or 0.48 mg/ml of additional DM, resulting in final concentrations of 0.08 or 0.5 mg/ml DM during incubation (upside-down triangles and open circles, respectively). The ability to recover activity after various periods was measured by 1:5 dilution into a C12E8-containing assay medium. A control was also included, in which solubilized ATPase in the absence of amphipol was diluted and incubated in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml DM (closed circles).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 12Protection of solubilized ATPase by the simultaneous presence of amphipol and detergent during long term incubation in the presence of Ca2+. Panel A, SR ATPase was solubilized in DM and incubated in TES 7.0 buffer with or without A8-35 (SR protein, DM, and A8-35 concentrations, in mg/ml, were as indicated), and assayed for residual ATPase activity (20-μl aliquots diluted in 2 ml of C12E8-containing assay medium) after various periods on ice. Panel B, same experiment but with delipidated ATPase. Panels C and D, same experiment but at 20 °C, with 0.5 mg/ml delipidated ATPase, 1 mg/ml DM, and a series of A8-35 concentrations. The results are plotted as open symbols. Half-times for inactivation are plotted in panel D against the A8-35/DM w/w ratio. For comparison, closed triangles inpanel C illustrate the irreversible inactivation of an amphipol- and Bio-Bead-treated sample (originally containing 0.3 mg/ml delipidated ATPase, 0.6 mg/ml DM, and 0.6 mg/ml A8-35, and subsequently treated for 50 min with Bio-Beads) in which residual DM was 0.007 mg/ml. In the latter experiment, control data points in the absence of Bio-Bead treatment were also collected; they fell on the same line as those for the 0.5/1/1 sample above, and have therefore been plotted with the same open triangles.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 14Protection conferred by amphipol A8-35 against irreversible inactivation of DM - or C12E8-solubilized ATPase in the absence of Ca2+.

The incubation medium (at 20 °C) was a KCl/TES medium at pH 7.35, containing 1 mm Mg2+ and 0.25 mmCa2+ plus 2.5 mm EGTA (hence a very low free Ca2+concentration). After various periods, 40-μl aliquots were diluted with 2 ml of assay medium containing 1 mg/ml C12E8 (and 0.1 mm Ca2+) to measure activity recovery. Panel B, similar experiment with SR membranes and C12E8. Forcircles and squares, samples containing SR protein (1 mg/ml) and C12E8 (5 mg/ml) were incubated without or with A8-35 (5 mg/ml) for various periods of time in the standard Ca2+-containing TES 7.5 medium supplemented with 1 mm EGTA, at 20 °C. Residual activity was measured by diluting 4-μl aliquots with 2 ml of assay medium. Fortriangles, other samples were first diluted 1:250 and incubated with EGTA. After various periods of time, 1-ml aliquots of these diluted samples were supplemented with 10 μl of 100 mm Ca2+ and were mixed with 1 ml of a modified assay medium with twice the normal concentrations of substrates, regenerating enzymes, and C12E8, so that the final conditions for the ATPase assay were identical. Panel C, delipidated ATPase in DM, with or without A8-35 (concentrations were 0.3/0.6/0.6 or 0.3/0.6/0, in mg/ml), was diluted 1:15 with a buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 50 mmMOPS-KOH (pH 7, 20 °C), 50 μm Ca2+, and 50 μg/ml C12E8, and intrinsic fluorescence was recorded. EGTA (1 mm) and Ca2+ (1.1 mm) were then added, sequentially (arrows).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Ca2+ uptake into SR vesicles and its release after the exhaustion of ATP was measured with the calcium-sensitive dye Arsenazo III, essentially as described previously (18.Gerdes U. Nakhla A.M. Møller J.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 734: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The medium used contained 100 mm KCl, 10 mm Mg2+, 5 mm Pi, 0.1 mg/ml pyruvate kinase, and 50 mm MOPS-Tris at pH 6.7. Ca2+ (three sequential additions of 20 μm), PEP (0.04 or 0.2 mm), and MgATP (0.04 mm) were added at the beginning of each experiment (see Fig. 1 B). The experiment was performed at 25 °C, and SR vesicles were present at 0.4 mg/ml. Similar experiments were performed using the standard TES 7.5 buffer. They gave similar results, but less Ca2+ was taken up by SR vesicles at the lower Mg2+ concentration and higher pH of the TES 7.5 buffer. Fig. 1 B therefore shows the data obtained at pH 6.7 and in the presence of 10 mm Mg2+. These ionic conditions correspond to those of the original transport assay (18.Gerdes U. Nakhla A.M. Møller J.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 734: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), except that we used MOPS-Tris rather than Tris-maleate, to eliminate possible maleate-specific effects (19.Sorensen M.M. de Meis L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 465: 210-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 20.Chu A. Tate C.A. Bick R.J. Van Winckle W.B. Entman M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1656-1664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we included 5 mm phosphate to provide a membrane-permeant calcium-complexing agent. A sharp transition between the end of the Ca2+ uptake phase and the beginning of the Ca2+release phase (after ATP and PEP exhaustion) was observed even in the absence of an adenylate kinase inhibitor, suggesting that contamination with adenylate kinase (18.Gerdes U. Nakhla A.M. Møller J.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 734: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) was negligible for our membranes. Light scattering and fluorescence measurements were performed with a SPEX fluorolog instrument. Light scattering was measured before and after the addition of amphipol or detergent, at 90°, with excitation and emission wavelengths both set at 546 nm. Intrinsic (tryptophan) fluorescence was measured with excitation and emission wavelengths of 290 and 330 nm, respectively (bandwidths were 5 and 10 nm, respectively). A few measurements were also made with an extrinsic probe, fluorescein 5′-isothiocyanate covalently bound to the ATPase (see Refs. 21.Champeil P. Riollet S. Orlowski S. Guillain F. Seebregts C.J.

FEBS Lett. 1982; 146: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Absorbance measurements (either at a single wavelength, for NADH, or at multiple wavelengths, for Arsenazo III and Murexide) were made with a diode array HP 8453 spectrophotometer. In some cases, turbidity changes were recorded with this spectrophotometer (e.g. Fig. 10). In all cases, samples were stirred continuously in the thermostat-regulated cuvette. Arsenazo III and Murexide were obtained from Sigma. In many experiments, amphipol was incubated with solubilized ATPase. The detergent-solubilized ATPase was prepared either together with its endogenous lipids, by simple detergent-induced solubilization of SR or DOC-purified membranes, or in an essentially delipidated form, by preparative size exclusion chromatography in the presence of DM of a solubilized concentrated sample (23.Møller J.V. le Maire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18659-18672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For experiments performed in the presence of endogenous SR lipids, the protocol generally involved preliminary solubilization of SR vesicles with dodecylmaltoside (DM) or C12E8 (2 mg/ml SR protein and 10 mg/ml detergent in TES 7.5 buffer at room temperature) followed by 2-fold dilution in the presence or absence of amphipol, so that the final samples contained 1 mg/ml SR protein and 5 mg/ml detergent, with or without 5 mg/ml of amphipol. The resulting SR/detergent/amphipol mixture was used after equilibration for 15–30 min. For the experiment illustrated in Fig. 5 (A andB), DOC-purified membrane-bound ATPase was used as the starting material, rather than SR vesicles (although SR vesicles gave similar results). This purified ATPase was treated with DM (2 mg/ml protein and 10 mg/ml DM) and was then centrifuged (Beckman TL100, 200-μl aliquots in a TLA100 rotor, 55,000 rpm for 6 min at 8 °C) to remove nonsolubilized material (which accounted for a very small proportion of the original protein content). For size exclusion HPLC in the presence or absence of detergent, 200-μl samples were loaded onto a TSK 3,000 SW silica gel column (7.5 mm × 30 cm, i.e. about 11.5 ml total volume), and subjected to chromatography (22.le Maire M.

The elution buffer was TES 7.0 medium, to protect the gel phase, containing 0.5 mm Ca2+ (to stabilize the ATPase), in the presence or absence of 1 mg/ml DM (20 °C). For calibration (K d versus R S, Ref. 24.le Maire M. Ghazi A. Møller J.V. Aggerbeck L.P. Biochem. J. 1987; 243: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we used Bio-Rad (catalog no. 151-1901) or Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (catalog no. 17-0441-01) gel filtration standard proteins, to which DM and amphipol were added if required. In some cases, we also used an elution buffer of greater ionic strength (250 mmNaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 20 mm TES-Tris at pH 7), with similar results both for ATPase complexes and for aggregates of pure A8-35. We used two different columns of the same type in this work, one for the early experiments illustrated in Fig. 5, and the other for all other experiments. For experiments performed in the absence of most of the endogenous SR lipids, delipidated ATPase was prepared by preliminary preparative chromatography (see Fig. 1A of Ref. 23.Møller J.V. le Maire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18659-18672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar for description of a similar experiment), starting from a highly concentrated detergent-solubilized SR sample, and using size exclusion chromatography in the presence of detergent to separate mixed lipid/detergent micelles from an essentially delipidated (and monomeric) ATPase·DM complex (note, however, that this HPLC-“delipidated” ATPase is known to retain some of the original SR lipids: 10–12 mol of lipid (see Ref. 23.Møller J.V. le Maire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18659-18672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) out of the 100 mol of lipid/mol of ATPase in native SR membranes). In this case, SR (10 mg/ml protein) was solubilized using 100 mg/ml DM in TES 7.0 medium. The mixture was centrifuged (as described above for DOC-ATPase) to remove nonsolubilized material. 200-μl aliquots of supernatant were applied to the TSK column and eluted with 1 mg/ml DM. The peak fractions of eluted ATPase (data not shown) were pooled, generally resulting in a total of about 0.6 ml (per 200 μl of injected sample) of a solutio"

G proteins regulate the activity of a variety of effector enzymes that generate second messengers or directly regulate other signaling proteins. Many G protein pathways propagate a signal to the nucleus, where they ultimately regulate gene expression. Accurate signal transduction in such pathways depends upon proper subcellular localization and, often, regulated changes in localization of constituent proteins. G protein α subunits (Gα) and βγ subunits (Gβγ) are often found tightly associated with cellular membranes, where receptors and many effectors also reside. Membrane binding is mediated, at least in part, by covalently attached lipids (1.Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys.

Palmitoylation, on the other hand, is a reversible post-translational attachment of 16-carbon palmitate via a thioester bond to cysteine residues. Gα can be divided into four families, αs, αi, αq, and α12, based on amino acid identity, and they can also be categorized based on the type and number of N-terminal fatty acid acylations. Gα can be myristoylated (e.g. αt), both myristoylated and palmitoylated (e.g. αi, αo, αz), singly palmitoylated (e.g.αs, α12), or dually palmitoylated (e.g. αq). The reversible nature of palmitoylation makes it a particularly interesting lipid modification, and, indeed, regulation of palmitoylation has been observed for several Gα (8.Degtyarev M.Y.

In addition, palmitoylation, rather than myristoylation, may dictate specific targeting to plasma membranes, as opposed to intracellular membranes (13.Schroeder H. Leventis R. Shahinian P.A.

For the Gα that are both myristoylated and palmitoylated (αi class), mutations that abolish both modifications result in a cytoplasmic and soluble, rather than plasma membrane-bound, protein (4.Jones T.L.

Mutant Gα that remain myristoylated but are no longer palmitoylated are found in both membrane and cytosolic fractions and appear to be widely distributed among intracellular membranes and plasma membranes (15.Morales J. Fishburn C.S. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In contrast, results are less consistent from a number of studies of the nonmyristoylated Gα. Mutations of palmitoylated cysteines in αs, αq, α11, and α12 have revealed either little or no change in membrane association (10.Mumby S.M. Kleuss C. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In terms of signaling activity, studies with nonpalmitoylated mutants of αs, αq, α11, and α12 have consistently demonstrated a partial or complete loss of signaling in cultured cells (27.Jones T.L. Gutkind J.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3196-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 28.Wedegaertner P.B. Chu D.H. Wilson P.T. Levis M.J. Bourne H.R. J. Biol.

Although a lack of attached palmitate on Gα appears to result in a lack of signaling, the mechanism of this effect remains unclear. Defective signaling by cysteine mutants could be due to a failure to localize correctly at plasma membranes, an absence of palmitate-mediated protein-protein interactions, or the loss of important interactions mediated by the cysteine side chains. A goal of the studies presented here was to gain a better understanding of palmitoylation by analyzing its importance in localization and signaling by α13. α13, together with α12, comprise the α12 class of Gα, and these proteins regulate a variety of pathways involved in cell growth and differentiation (30.Dhanasekaran N. Tsim S.T. Dermott J.M. Onesime D. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1383-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Cellular activities regulated by α13 include oncogenic transformation of fibroblasts, Na+/H+ exchange, c-Jun N-terminal kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, tyrosine phosphorylation, apoptosis, actin stress fiber formation, neurite retraction, focal adhesion assembly, and serum response element-mediated gene expression (30.Dhanasekaran N. Tsim S.T. Dermott J.M. Onesime D. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1383-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Some of these pathways require the small GTPase Rho, and indeed, α12 and α13 can stimulate the formation of active, GTP-bound RhoA in cultured cells (31.Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Drechsel D. Hall A. Moolenaar W.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1851-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). An important connection between α13 and Rho was revealed recently by the identification of the first direct effector for α13, a Rho-specific guanine-nucleotide exchange factor termed p115-RhoGEF (32.Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Interestingly, α12 was unable to activate p115-RhoGEF, indicating that this may be an α13-specific effector. Not only is p115-RhoGEF a direct effector for α13, p115-RhoGEF also can regulate α13, and to a lesser extent α12, by virtue of an RGS domain that stimulates the GTPase activity of α13 (33.Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that α13 is palmitoylated at cysteine 14 and/or cysteine 18 and demonstrate a palmitoylation-dependent plasma membrane anchoring of α13. Palmitoylation of α13 was also required for Rho-mediated serum response factor (SRF) activation and stress fiber formation. However, p115-RhoGEF interacted with both wild type and CS mutant of α13. Furthermore, we demonstrate that p115-RhoGEF can translocate from cytoplasm to plasma membrane in response to activated α13, but a nonpalmitoylated mutant of α13 fails to induce this translocation. These observations agree with the hypothesis that one of the major roles of palmitoylation is to tether the acylated protein(s), α13in this case, to plasma membranes and thus allow productive protein-protein interactions, either by increasing the acylated protein's concentration in the vicinity of interacting proteins or delivering other proteins (e.g. p115-RhoGEF) to important locations in the cell. The HA epitope (DVPDYA)-tagged pcDNAIIIHA G13wt and pcDNAIIIHA G13QL were kind gifts from J. S. Gutkind (34.Fukuhara S. Murga C. Zohar M. Igishi T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5868-5879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) and will hereafter be referred to as α13 and α13QL. α13QL, without an epitope tag, was provided by N. Dhanasekaran. The reporter plasmid that expresses the luciferase gene under the control of a mutant serum response element lacking a ternary complex factor binding site (SRF), termed pSRF-Luc, was purchased from Stratagene. The expression vector for Myc epitope-tagged C3-transferase, pEF-Myc-C3-transferase, was a kind gift from A. Hall (35.Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding Myc epitope-tagged p115-RhoGEF, pEXV-Myc-p115-RhoGEF, was a gift from M. Hart (36.Hart M.J. Sharma S. elMasry N. Qiu R.G. McCabe P. Polakis P. Bollag G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25452-25458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The plasmids carrying HA epitope-tagged activated RhoA cDNA (RhoV14) or the β-galactosidase gene (pCMV-β-gal) were obtained from P. Tsichlis (Kimmel Cancer Institute, Philadelphia). The Stratagene QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit was used to replace cysteines at positions 14 and 18 of α13. We mutated both cysteines separately and dually in the wild type and QL background of α13 by using two sets of forward and reverse primers carrying base changes in appropriate codons. The forward and the reverse primers used to mutate cysteine 14 to serine to create α13wtC14S or α13QLC14S, were 5′-ccgtgctgtccgtaagcttcccgggctgc-3′ and 5′-gcagcccgggaagcttacggacagcacgg-3′, respectively. Another set of primers, forward (5′-gtgtgcttcccgggctcagtactgacgaacggc-3′) and reverse (5′-gccgttcgtcagtactgagcccgggaagcacac-3′), were used to mutate cysteine 18 to serine to create α13wtC18S and α13QLC18S. The set of primers to mutate cysteine 18 to serine was utilized on C14S mutants to create double mutants, α13wtCCSS and α13QL CCSS. The correct DNA sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the entire open reading frame (Kimmel Cancer Center Nucleic Acid Facility). HEK293, COS, and Rat-1 cells were propagated in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (unless otherwise mentioned) and Gentamicin. Unless otherwise noted, cells were plated in six-well plates at 7.0 × 105 cells per well and grown for 24 h prior to transfection. 1 μg of each expression plasmid was transfected into the cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technology Inc.) or FuGene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). HEK293 cells were plated at 2 × 106 cells in 6-cm plates, grown for 24 h, and transfected with 3 μg of expression plasmid. 24 h after transfection, the cells were transferred to 10-cm plates and grown for another 24 h. Particulate (P) and soluble (S) fractions were prepared from cell lysates, and expressed proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting exactly as described previously (37.Evanko D.S. Thiyagarajan M.M. Wedegaertner P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1327-1336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We used the anti-HA antibody (12CA5) and the anti-Myc antibody (36.Hart M.J. Sharma S. elMasry N. Qiu R.G. McCabe P. Polakis P. Bollag G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25452-25458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) to detect HA epitope-tagged proteins and Myc epitope-tagged proteins, respectively. 24 h after transfection in six-well plates, HEK293 cells were replated on glass coverslips and grown for 24 h. Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min and permeabilized by incubation in blocking buffer (2.5% nonfat milk and 1% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 30 min. Cells were then incubated with appropriate monoclonal antibody (3 μg/ml), as mentioned in each figure legend, in blocking buffer for 1 h. The cells were washed with blocking buffer and incubated for 30 min in a 1:100 dilution of a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody. Donky anti-mouse antibodies labeled with Texas Red or fluorescein isothiocyanate (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) and goat anti-mouse antibodies labeled with Alexa488 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) were used. The coverslips were washed with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS, rinsed in distilled water, and mounted on glass slides with 10 μl of Prolong Antifade reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Microscopy was performed with an Olympus BX60 microscope equipped with a 60X/NA1.4 objective. Images were recorded with a Sony DKC-5000 digital camera and transferred to Adobe Photoshop for digital processing. Radiolabeling with [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (NEN Life Science Products) was performed exactly as described (37.Evanko D.S. Thiyagarajan M.M. Wedegaertner P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1327-1336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). COS cells (4 × 105) were plated in 24-well plates and grown for 24 h. Cells were then switched to serum-free medium (with antibiotic) and transfected, using FuGene 6, with pCMV-β-gal (0.12 μg), pSRF-Luc (0.12 μg), and other plasmids as indicated. After 24 h of transfection, cells were carefully washed twice with cold PBS and were lysed by using reporter lysis buffer (Promega). 20 μl of each lysate was mixed at room temperature with 50 μl of luciferase substrate (Promega), and luciferase activities were determined by measuring luminescence intensity. Lysates were assayed for β-galactosidase activity by the colorimetric method and were used to normalize transfection efficiency. After allowing Rat-1 cells to attach to coverslips, the culture medium was changed to Dulbecco's minimal essential medium plus 0.1% fetal bovine serum. 24 h later, the culture medium was changed to Dulbecco's minimal essential medium without serum. 24 h after that, the cells on coverslips were transfected using FuGene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde 24 h after transfection. Coverslips were prepared for fluorescence microscopy, as described under “Immunofluorescence Localization,” with the exception that a 1:40 dilution of Alexa594 conjugated to phalloidin (Molecular Probes) was included during the secondary antibody incubation to detect actin fibers HEK293 cells were transfected according to the earlier described protocol, with plasmid encoding Myc epitope-tagged p115-RhoGEF together with plasmids encoding HA epitope-tagged α13, α13QL, α13CCSS, and α13QL CCSS. After transfection, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and were lysed at 4 °C in 1 ml of buffer containing 25 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10 μm AlCl3, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin. Lysates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. HA epitope-tagged α13 and its mutants were immunoprecipitated from the cleared lysates by incubating for 1 h at 4 °C with anti-HA antibody. Immunocomplexes were recovered with the aid of Protein A/G PLUS agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Lysates and the immunocomplexes were analyzed by immunoblotting with appropriate monoclonal antibody as mentioned in each figure legend. In our experiments, we utilized anti-HA epitope (12CA5) and anti-Myc epitope (32.Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) mouse monoclonal antibodies. Inspection of the amino acid sequence of α13 (Fig. 1) identified cysteine 14 and/or cysteine 18 as potential sites for palmitoylation. To test this prediction, we mutated the appropriate codons to replace cysteines 14 and 18 with serines, either individually (α13C14S and α13C18S) or doubly mutated (α13CCSS). The double cysteine to serine mutant was also created in α13QL (α13QL CCSS), a constitutively active form of α13 in which a conserved glutamine at position 226 is replaced with a leucine (38.Voyno Yasenetskaya T. Conklin B.R. Gilbert R.L. Hooley R. Bourne H.R. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4721-4724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To facilitate immunoprecipitation and immunolocalization and to easily distinguish transfected α13 from endogenous G protein α subunits, α13 and its mutants described here also contained a HA epitope tag at the N termini. The presence of the HA tag does not affect the ability of α13QL to activate signaling pathways (34.Fukuhara S. Murga C. Zohar M. Igishi T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5868-5879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5), nor does it prevent palmitoylation of α13 (Fig. 2).Figure 5Activation of SRF-mediated transcription by α13QL, but not by α13QL CCSS. pSRF-Luc (0.12 μg) and pCMV-β-gal (0.12 μg) plasmids were coexpressed in COS cells with 0.16 μg of pCDNAIII (Vector), 0.08 μg of plasmid encoding HA-tagged activated α13(α13QL), 0.08 μg of plasmid encoding untagged activated α13 (α13 QL (no tag)), or 0.08 μg of plasmid encoding activated RhoA (rhoV14). In addition, transfections included (+C3) or excluded (−C3) 0.08 μg of plasmid encoding C3-transferase. 24 h after transfection, cells were lysed, and cell extracts were assayed for luciferase activity and β-galactosidase activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Luciferase activity was normalized by β-galactosidase activity present in each sample. Data are expressed as percentage activity with respect to control cells (Vector), and are the average ± S.E. of triplicate transfections. Similar results were obtained in three other independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 2Cysteines 14 and cysteine 18 are required for palmitoylation of α13. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmid alone (lane 1) or with plasmids encoding HA epitope-tagged α13 (lane 2), α13C14S (lane 3), α13C18S (lane 4), α13CCSS (lane 5), α13QL (lane 6), or α13QL CCSS (lane 7). 48 h after transfection, cells were incubated with 1.0 mCi/ml [3H]palmitic acid in 6-cm dishes. α13proteins were immunoprecipitated by using the 12CA5 antibody against the HA epitope. Immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and identical gels were subjected to fluorography (A, 30-day exposure) and immunoblotting (B) with 12CA5 antibody. C, a fluorogram of a long exposure (20 weeks) of a separate experiment.Lanes 1–5 represent samples from cells transfected with identical plasmids as described above forlanes 1–5 in A and radiolabeled with [3H]palmitic acid.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) [3H]Palmitic acid labeling of transiently transfected HEK293 cells, followed by immunoprecipitation with 12CA5 monoclonal antibody, demonstrated that α13 (Fig. 2 A,lane 2) and α13QL (Fig.2 A, lane 6) incorporated radiolabeled palmitate. This is consistent with the previously described incorporation of radiolabeled palmitate into α13 after expression in insect cells (39.Veit M. Nurnberg B. Spicher K. Harteneck C. Ponimaskin E. Schultz G. Schmidt M.F.G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Importantly, the single (Fig.2 A, lanes 3 and 4) and double cysteine to serine mutants (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5 and 7) of α13 failed to incorporate detectable levels of radiolabeled palmitate. Fig.2 B shows that similar levels of α13 proteins were immunoprecipitated from the cell extracts. This result suggests that both cysteine 14 and cysteine 18 are required for efficient palmitoylation of α13 and are probably the sites of covalent attachment of palmitate. A long exposure of an additional palmitate-labeling experiment confirms the lack of palmitoylation of the single and double cysteine mutants (Fig. 2 C). The failure of the single cysteine to serine mutants, α13C14S and α13C18S, to incorporate palmitate is similar to a previous study with αq (28.Wedegaertner P.B. Chu D.H. Wilson P.T. Levis M.J. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25001-25008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like α13, two N-terminal cysteines, at positions 9 and 10, were required for palmitoylation of αq; single cysteine to serine mutants of αq incorporated very low levels of radiolabeled palmitate. To determine the role of palmitoylation in proper membrane localization of α13, we assayed the subcellular localization of α13 and its palmitoylation-deficient cysteine to serine mutants. Immunofluorescence microscopy of transiently transfected 293 cells demonstrated the importance of palmitoylation for plasma membrane localization of α13. Wild type α13 was detected predominantly at plasma membranes, as shown by bright staining at the cell periphery (Fig.3, wt). However, both of the single cysteine mutants, α13C14S (Fig. 3,C14S) and α13C18S (Fig. 3, C18S), and the double cysteine mutant, α13CCSS (Fig. 3,CCSS), exhibited no detectable plasma membrane staining but instead displayed a diffuse cytoplasmic staining. These results indicate that preventing palmitoylation by cysteine to serine mutations blocks the ability of α13 to stably bind to plasma membranes. To extend this analysis of subcellular localization, α13and its mutants were assayed for their presence in membrane-containing and cytosolic fractions after cell lysis. Transfected HEK293 cells were lysed in a hypotonic buffer, and cellular proteins were separated into particulate (P) or soluble (S) fractions by high speed centrifugation. Immunoblotting indicated that α13partitioned almost exclusively into the particulate fraction (Fig.4), suggesting that α13 is tightly bound to cellular membranes in agreement with our immunofluorescence microscopy results (Fig. 3). The CCSS mutants of α13 displayed pronounced increases in the soluble fractions (S) (Fig. 4 B). Fig. 4 A, a graphical representation of three cellular fractionation experiments, demonstrates that the distribution of α13 (98:2, P:S) and α13QL (92:8, P:S) has shifted to 47:53 (P:S) and 50:50 (P:S) for α13CCSS and α13QL CCSS, respectively. This increased partitioning into the cytosol by the α13 cysteine to serine mutants is consistent with their lack of palmitoylation (Fig. 2) and immunofluorescence microscopy indicating a cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 3). Recently, it has become evident that α13 can mediate activation of the small G protein RhoA by certain G protein-coupled receptors (e.g. the lysophosphatidic acid receptor) (40.Gohla A. Harhammer R. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4653-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In addition, constitutively active forms of α13 can stimulate RhoA and RhoA-dependent signaling pathways. Thus, we investigated two Rho-dependent signaling end points to test the signaling ability of CS mutants of α13. To examine signaling functions of α13 in a receptor-independent manner, α13QL was compared with α13QL CCSS. First, we assayed the ability of α13QL or α13QL CCSS to activate SRF-mediated gene transcription (41.Mao J. Yuan H. Xie W. Simon M.I. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27118-27123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Activation of gene transcription was evaluated in a transient transfection assay employing a reporter plasmid containing a serum response element that binds SRF and promotes the transcription of a luciferase gene. Expression of activated forms of α13markedly stimulated the production of the reporter luciferase (F"
https://openalex.org/W1976712056,"We investigated the dynamics of nuclear transcription factor κB (NF-κB) by using fusion proteins of the p65 subunit with mutants of green fluorescent protein (GFP). GFP-NF-κB chimeras were functional both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and reporter gene studies. GFP-p65 was regulated by IκBα similar to wild type p65 and associated with its inhibitor even if both proteins were linked to a GFP protein. This finding was also verified by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy and studies showing mutual regulation of the intracellular localization of both GFP chimerae. Incubation of GFP-p65 with fluorescently labeled NF-κB-binding oligonucleotides also resulted in FRET. This effect was DNA sequence-specific and exhibited saturation characteristics. Application of stopped-flow fluorometry to measure the kinetics of FRET between GFP-p65 and oligonucleotides revealed a fast increase of acceptor fluorescence with a plateau after about 10 ms. The observed initial binding rate showed a temperature-dependent linear correlation with the oligonucleotide concentration. The association constant calculated according to pre-steady state kinetics was 3 × 10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>−1</sup>, although equilibrium binding studies implied significantly higher values. This observation suggests that the binding process involves a rapid association with a rather high off-rate followed by a conformational change resulting in an increase of the association constant."
https://openalex.org/W2080082509,"Expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) is controlled by heat shock transcription factors (HSFs). Vertebrates express multiple HSFs whose activities may be regulated by distinct signals. HSF3 is specifically activated in unstressed proliferating cells by direct binding to the c-myb proto-oncogene product (c-Myb), which plays an important role in cellular proliferation. This suggests that the c-Myb-induced HSF3 activation may contribute to the growth-regulated expression of HSPs. Here we report that the p53 tumor suppressor protein directly binds to HSF3 and blocks the interaction between c-Myb and HSF3. In addition, p53 stimulates the degradation of c-Myb through a proteasome-dependent mechanism, which is, at least partly, mediated by induction of Siah in certain types of cells. Induction of p53 by a genotoxic reagent in DT40 cells disrupts the HSF3-c-Myb interaction and down-regulates the expression of certain HSPs. Mutated forms of p53 found in certain tumors did not inhibit c-Myb-induced HSF3 activation. The regulation of HSF3 activity by c-Myb and p53 sheds light on the molecular events that govern HSP expression during cellular proliferation and apoptosis.

The regulation of HSF3 activity by c-Myb and p53 sheds light on the molecular events that govern HSP expression during cellular proliferation and apoptosis. heat shock protein heat shock transcription factor heat shock element β-galactosidase glutathioneS-transferase Many heat shock proteins (HSPs)1 remain essential even under nonstressful conditions, a fact that is consistent with their established role in protein folding and translocation (for review see Ref. 1.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). The transcription of HSP genes is not only induced by various stresses (reviewed in Ref. 1.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar) but is also growth-regulated (2.Milarski K.L. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9517-9521Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the view that actively proliferating cells, which express various proteins to high levels, require more HSPs than nonproliferating cells. HSPs also play a role in the regulation of apoptosis, because overexpression of HSPs is known to block apoptosis (3.Mosser D.D. Caron A.W. Bourget L. Denis-Larose C. Massie B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5317-5327Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar, 4.Jäättelä M. Wissing D. Kokholm K. Kallunki T. Egeblad M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6124-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Therefore, HSP expression might be modulated during apoptosis. However, the mechanism through which HSP expression is linked to cellular growth or apoptosis remains unknown. In response to stress, heat shock factors (HSFs) bind to heat shock element (HSE) and mediates transcriptional induction of HSP genes (reviewed in Ref. 5.Lis J.T. Wu C. Cell. 1993; 74: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). HSF activation is regulated in a number of steps. Upon heat shock, a cryptic form of an inactive HSF1 monomer is converted to a DNA-binding trimer via the hydrophobic repeat (HR-A/B) located in the central region of HSF1 molecule (6.Baler R. Dahl G. Vollemy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2486-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 7.Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). The C-terminal hydrophobic repeat (HR-C) was suggested to function in suppression of trimer formation by interacting with HR-A/B (8.Clos J. Westwood J.T. Becker P.B. Wilson S. Wu C. Cell. 1990; 63: 1085-1097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 9.Rabindran S.K. Haroun R.I. Clos J. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Science. 1993; 259: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Some HSPs such as Hsp90 and Hsp70 bind to HSF1 and maintain it in the inactive state in the absence of stress (10.Zou J. Guo Y. Guettouche T. Smith D.F. Voellmy R. Cell. 1998; 94: 471-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar, 11.Morimoto R.I. Science. 1993; 259: 1409-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar). Heat shock stress not only regulates the DNA binding activity of HSF1 but also regulates itstrans-activating capacity. The activity of the transcriptional activation domain is negatively modulated by othercis-regulatory domains and by phosphorylation (12.Knauf U. Newton E.M. Kyriakis J. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2782-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 13.Kline M.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2107-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In addition to HSF1, vertebrates express multiple HSFs (14.Schuetz T.J. Gallo G.J. Sheldon L. Tempst P. Kingston R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6911-6915Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 15.Rabindran S.K. Giorgi G. Clos J. Wu C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kawazoe Y. Tanabe M. Nagata K Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5168-5178Google Scholar), suggesting that they are regulated by a diverse array of environmental and developmental cues. HSF1 and HSF3 are activated by heat shock at different temperature (19.Nakai A. Tanabe M. Kawazoe Y. Inazawa J. Morimoto R.I. Nagata K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), but heat shock does not significantly affect the activity of HSF2 (20.Sistonen L. Sarge K.D. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2087-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The c-myb proto-oncogene product (c-Myb) directly binds to HSF3 via the DNA-binding domain of both proteins and induces activation of HSF3 (21.Kanei-Ishii C. Tanikawa J. Nakai A. Morimoto R.I. Ishii S. Science. 1997; 277: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although c-Myb is a transcriptional activator that binds to the specific DNA sequence, 5′-AACNG-3′ (22.Biedenkapp H. Borgmyer U. Sippel A.E. Klempnauer K.-H. Nature. 1988; 335: 835-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 23.Sakura H. Kanei-Ishii C. Nagase T. Nakagoshi H. Gonda T.J. Ishii S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5758-5762Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), it activates HSF3 by a protein-protein interaction. c-Myb is induced at G1/S transition in the cell cycle and plays an important role in the regulation of cellular proliferation and apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 24.Weston K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). These facts suggest that HSF3 activation mediated by c-Myb may contribute to the growth-regulated expression of HSP genes. Although a lot of evidence indicates that HSF1 is activated by heat stress, disruption of the HSF3 gene also results in a reduction in HSP gene expression in response to heat stress (25.Tanabe M. Kawazoe Y. Takeda S. Morimoto R.I. Nagata K. Nakai A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This suggests that HSF3 is also involved in the transcriptional induction of HSP genes following heat stress. However, little is known about how HSF3 regulates heat stress-induced transcription. Thus, HSF3 acts both in Myb- and heat shock-mediated HSP induction. The products of proto-oncogenes such as c-Myb activate cellular proliferation, whereas the products of tumor suppressor genes have an opposite effect. The p53 protein is the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor to be identified so far in a wide range of human tumors (26.Nigro J.M. Baker S.J. Preisinger A.C. Jessup J.M. Hostetter R. Clearly K. Bigner S.H. Davidson N. Baylin S. Devilee P. Glover T. Collins F.S. Weston A. Modali R. Harris C.C. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1989; 342: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (2573) Google Scholar,27.Hollstein M. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Harris C.C. Science. 1991; 253: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (7479) Google Scholar). Loss of function of p53 appears to confer selective advantages on cells through deregulated growth and resistance to apoptosis (28.Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1996; 379: 19-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The p53 protein contains the three functional domains responsible for the transcriptional activation, sequence-specific DNA binding, and tetramerization from the N terminus (reviewed in Ref. 29.Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar). Most of the p53 mutations found in tumor are localized in the sequence-specific DNA-binding domain in the central portion of the molecule (30.Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar). Although p53 is present in small quantities in most cells, several different types of DNA damage produced by γ-irradiation, ultraviolet irradiation, or genotoxic reagents, induces p53 (31.Nelson W.G. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). p53 induces cell cycle arrest in essentially all types of cells or triggers apoptosis in some specific cell lineages and under certain cellular context (reviewed in Ref. 29.Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar). This was shown to be related, at least partly, to its function as a sequence-specific transcription factor for the induction of a group of target genes (32.Pietenpol J.A. Tokino T. Thiagalingam S. El-Deiry W.S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1998-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) including p21WAF1/CIP1 (33.El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7957) Google Scholar), GADD45 (34.Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. El-Deiry W.S. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V. Plunkett B.S. Vogelstein B. Fornance Jr A.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 587-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar), and Bax (35.Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Among these, the p21WAF1/CIP1 gene has received the most attention (33.El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7957) Google Scholar). p21WAF1/CIP1 binds to the cyclin/cyclin-dependent protein kinases complexes and inhibits the function of cyclin-dependent protein kinases during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, leading to DNA-damage-induced G1 arrest. p53 also induces the expression of GADD45, which interacts with the replication and repair factor PCNA, thereby inhibiting the entry of cells into S phase (34.Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. El-Deiry W.S. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V. Plunkett B.S. Vogelstein B. Fornance Jr A.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 587-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar,36.Smith M.L.

The p53 target gene, bax, encodes a protein that promotes cell death. Siah-1A, which is a murine homologue ofDrosophila Sina (seven in absentina) (37.Carthew R.W. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 561-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), is also induced by p53 and inhibits cell growth (38.Matsuzawa S. Takayama S. Froesch B.A. Zapata J.M. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2736-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Drosophila Sina interacts with a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBCD1) and assists in the proteasome-dependent degradation of the transcription factor, Tramtrack (39.Li S. Li Y. Carthew R. Lai Z.-C. Cell. 1997; 90: 469-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 40.Tang A. Neufeld T. Kwan E. Rubin G. Cell. 1997; 90: 459-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Human Siah also regulates the degradation of tumor suppressor DCC (deleted in colorectalcancer) and transcriptional co-repressor N-CoR via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (41.Hu G. Zhang S. Vidal M. Baer J.L. Xu T. Fearon E.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2701-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 42.Zhang J. Guenther M.G. Carthew R.W. Lazar M.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1775-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Thus, p53 induces the expression of multiple target genes whose products act in a variety of processes including cell cycle regulation, replication, apoptosis, and protein degradation. p53 not only induces the expression of specific target genes but also directly binds to and acts on several cellular proteins such as TFIIH (43.Wang X.W. Yeh H. Schaffer L. Roy R. Moncollin V. Egly J.-M. Wang Z. Friedberg E.C. Evans M.K. Taffe B.G. Bohr V.A. Weeda G. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Forrester K. Harris C.C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). TFIIH is a component of the RNA polymerase II basal transcription factor and consists of two helicases. p53 binds to these two helicases and modulate their activities (43.Wang X.W. Yeh H. Schaffer L. Roy R. Moncollin V. Egly J.-M. Wang Z. Friedberg E.C. Evans M.K. Taffe B.G. Bohr V.A. Weeda G. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Forrester K. Harris C.C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Thus, p53 can induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through multiple mechanisms. Here we demonstrate that p53 directly binds to HSF3 and inhibits the c-Myb-induced activation of HSF3. Plasmids to express chicken HSF3, mouse c-Myb, and human p53 were constructed using pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) containing the cytomegalovirus promoter. For luciferase assays using 293T cells (see Fig. 1, A—E; see also Fig.3 C), a mixture containing 0.5 μg of the HSE-containing luciferase reporter plasmid (44.Kanei-Ishii C. Yasukawa T. Morimoto R.I.

Adriamycine treatment (Sigma) (see Fig. 1 C) was performed for 24 h before the luciferase assays. Heat shock treatment (42 °C for 1 h) (see Fig. 1 E) was performed 36 h after transfection, and the cells were then further cultivated at 37 °C for further 5 h, and luciferase assays were performed. To investigate the effect of heat shock on p53 activity, a mixture of 0.5 μg of the luciferase reporter containing tandem repeats of the p53-binding site (45.Aoyama N. Nagase T. Sawazaki T.

Immunostaining of HSF3 was performed as described (21.Kanei-Ishii C. Tanikawa J. Nakai A. Morimoto R.I. Ishii S. Science. 1997; 277: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The mutants of p53 and Siah-1A were constructed by the polymerase chain reaction-based method or using appropriate enzyme sites. The vector pSPUTK (Stratagene) was used forin vitro translation of p53, c-Myb, and Siah-1A. GST pull-down assays were performed using approximately 3 μg of GST fusion protein/assay as described previously (21.Kanei-Ishii C. Tanikawa J. Nakai A. Morimoto R.I. Ishii S. Science. 1997; 277: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The following binding buffers were used: 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 125 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 5 mm dithiothreitol for HSF3-p53 interaction; 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm dithiothreitol for interaction between Siah-1A and c-Myb.

To study the interaction among HSF3, c-Myb, and p53 (Figs. 2, C and D, and 3 B), a mixture of various amounts of HSF3 or FLAG-HSF3, p53, and c-Myb expression plasmid as indicated in the figures, or the blank control plasmid, and 0.5 μg of the internal control plasmid pact-β-gal was transfected into 293T cells using the CaPO4 method. In the plasmids used in these transfections, the chicken cytoplasmic β-actin promoter was linked to the HSF3, c-Myb, or p53 cDNA. 40 h after transfection, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 μm NaF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). The amounts of lysates used for immunoprecipitation was normalized by β-galactosidase activity. After decreasing the NaCl concentration to 175 mm by addition of lysis buffer lacking NaCl, lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG M2 (KODAK) or anti-HSF3 antibodies, and the immunocomplex was analyzed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by Western blotting using anti-c-Myb monoclonal antibody (mAb1-1) and anti-p53 goat polyclonal (C-19) or mouse monoclonal (DO-1) antibody (Santa Cruz). To investigate the interaction between c-Myb and Siah-1A (see Fig. 5 B), a mixture of 5 μg of c-Myb expression plasmid, 5 μg of the Siah-1AΔ22 expression plasmid pact-Siah-1AΔ22 or the control blank DNA, and 0.5 μg of pact-β-gal DNA was transfected into 293T cells using the CaPO4 method. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 20% glycerol) by sonication (10 s × 3), and immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-FLAG M2 antibody. For co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins, approximately 108 DT40 cells were lysed in 5 ml of the lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 20% glycerol) by sonication (10 s × 3), and lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HSF3 antibody.Figure 5Siah-1A mediates c-Myb degradation.

Lactacystin (Sigma) treatment was performed for 2 or 4 h at a final concentration of 25 μm before lysate preparation. In the experiments using 293T cells (see Fig. 1 B), transfection was performed as described for luciferase assays, lysates were prepared using an aliquot of the cells, and Western blotting was performed as described above. To examine the effect of Siah-1A on the Myb protein level (see Fig.5 A), a mixture of 1 μg of the c-Myb expression plasmid pcDNA3-c-Myb, 1 or 2 μg of the Siah-1A expression plasmid pcI-Siah-1A or the control blank DNA, and 0.5 μg of pCMV-β-gal was transfected into CV-1 cels, and Western blotting was performed as described above. To analyze the half-life of c-Myb (see Fig. 4 D), CV-1 cells were transfected with a mixture of 3 μg of the c-Myb expression plasmid, 0.6 μg of the p53 expression plasmid or the control DNA, and 0.5 μg of pCMV-β-gal. 24 h after transfection, cells were labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine for 2 h, and then the radioactivity was chased with an excess of cold amino acids. At various times, lysates were prepared using the lysis buffer described above and immunoprecipitated by anti-c-Myb polyclonal antibody, which was raised against the c-Myb protein containing the N-terminal 200 amino acids. The amount of lysates used for immunoprecipitation was normalized by the β-galatosidase activity. To determine the p53 protein level (Figs. 1 C and6 A), the CV-1 cells transfected for luciferase assays or DT40 cells were treated with the indicated concentration of adriamycine for 24 h, and lysates were prepared as described above. Western blotting was performed using anti-p53 antibody PAb240 (Santa Cruz). DT40 cells were cultivated to approximately 10 × 106 cells/10-cm dish and treated with adriamycine for 24 or 4.5 h. Total RNA was prepared using TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred onto nylon membrane. Hybridization was performed using the probes for mouse HSP70, HSP9-α, HSP90β, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as described by Tanabe et al. (25.Tanabe M. Kawazoe Y. Takeda S. Morimoto R.I. Nagata K. Nakai A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To identify proteins other than c-Myb that modulate HSE-dependent transcription, we examined the effect of various proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor gene products on HSE-dependent transcription. When the p53 expression plasmid was co-transfected into 293T cells with the HSE-containing luciferase reporter, luciferase activity was significantly repressed to 40% of that of the control (Fig. 1 A). This p53-induced repression was relieved by co-expression of c-Myb. Next, we investigated the effect of p53 on HSE-dependent transcription activation mediated by c-Myb (Fig. 1 B). In 293T cells, c-Myb activated 57-fold the luciferase expression from the HSE-containing promoter. Addition of increasing amounts of the p53 expression plasmid inhibited this c-Myb-induced luciferase expression in a dose-dependent manner. The c-Myb protein level was not dramatically lowered by p53 expression in the transfected cells (Fig.1 B). Furthermore, we investigated the effect of a genotoxic reagent, which induces p53 protein, on HSF3-mediated transcriptional activation (Fig. 1 C). The HSE-containing luciferase reporter was transfected into 293T cells together with the c-Myb expression plasmid, and luciferase activity was examined in the absence or presence of adriamycine. Adriamycine treatment inhibited c-Myb-induced luciferase expression from the HSE-containing promoter in a dose-dependent manner. Overexpression of HSF3 alone activates transcription from the HSE-containing promoter even in the absence of a co-transfected c-Myb expression vector (21.Kanei-Ishii C. Tanikawa J. Nakai A. Morimoto R.I. Ishii S. Science. 1997; 277: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). p53 also inhibited this HSF3-dependent transcription (Fig.1 D). HSF3 is involved not only in c-Myb-dependent HSP induction but also in heat shock-induced transcription (25.Tanabe M. Kawazoe Y. Takeda S. Mori"

Purified endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) can generate superoxide (O⨪2) under special conditions but is only known to participate in cell signaling through NO. Here we show that eNOS regulates tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) through a mechanism dependent on the production of O⨪2 and completely independent of NO. Expression of eNOS in transfected U937 cells increased phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced TNFα promoter activity and TNFα production.N ω-Methyl-l-arginine, an inhibitor of eNOS that blocks NO production but not its NADPH oxidase activity, did not prevent TNFα up-regulation. Likewise, Gln361eNOS, a competent NADPH oxidase that lacks NOS activity, retained the ability to increase TNFα. Similar to the effect of eNOS, a O⨪2 donor dose-dependently increased TNFα production in differentiated U937 cells. In contrast, cotransfection of superoxide dismutase with eNOS prevented TNFα up-regulation, as did partial deletion of the eNOS NADPH binding site, a mutation associated with loss of O⨪2 production. Thus, eNOS may straddle a bifurcating pathway that can lead to the formation of either NO or O⨪2, interrelated but often opposing free radical messengers. This arrangement has possible implications for atherosclerosis and septic shock where endothelial dysfunction results from imbalances in NO and O⨪2 production.

It has a C-terminal reductase domain that binds NADPH, FAD, and FMN, and a N-terminal oxygenase domain that binds a heme moiety, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), and l-arginine (3.Chen P.F. Tsai A.L.

NO produced by eNOS regulates vascular tone through a cGMP-dependent signaling pathway (4.Waldman S.A. Murad F. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1988; 12 (Suppl. 5): S115-S118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, NO also has cGMP-independent effects within the vasculature, such as inhibition of leukocyte adhesion, that relies on its ability to inactivate or antagonize O⨪2 (5.Gaboury J.

Notably, in cell free systems, purified eNOS can be shown in the absence of BH4to generate small quantities of O⨪2 rather than NO (7.Xia Y. Tsai A.L. Berka V. Zweier J.L. J. Biol.

However, cell regulation directly attributable to eNOS production of O⨪2 has not been previously demonstrated. Superoxide (O⨪2) and other reactive oxygen species (ROS), conventionally viewed as cytotoxins, have recently been recognized as important signal transduction intermediates that regulate gene expression, cell differentiation, immune activation, and apoptosis (9.Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X.

In the vasculature, increased O⨪2 production disproportionate to NO synthesis has been associated with endothelial dysfunction, an early pathogenic event in atherosclerosis (14.Bouloumie A.

Further, elevated O⨪2 production in the presence of NO has been linked to endothelial injury and organ damage in septic shock (18.Szabó C. Zingarelli B. Salzman A.L. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 1051-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), possibly through the formation of peroxynitrite (ONOO−), a cytotoxic metabolite (19.Hausladen A. Fridovich I. J. Biol.

However, the precise enzymatic origins of ROS in either signaling events or pathologic conditions have remained obscure (23.Wolin M.S.

ROS have many potential sources within cells including mitochondria, xanthine oxidase, cyclooxygenases, and NADPH oxidases, making it difficult to associate a specific enzyme with a corresponding ROS-related event (23.Wolin M.S.

We have previously described the expression of functional human eNOS in U937 cells using a pCEP4 vector (25.Yan L. Wang S. Rafferty S.P. Wesley R.A. Danner R.L.

Human monoblastoid U937 cells lack NOS expression in either their naı̈ve or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) differentiated states (26.Wang S. Yan L. Wesley R.A. Danner R.L. J. Biol.

At resting levels of intracellular calcium, eNOS expression in transfected U937 cells does not result in NO release, but NO is rapidly produced upon exposure to calcium ionophore (25.Yan L. Wang S.

A. 1998; 95: 9220-9225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar), suggested that these cells might be useful for exploring NO-independent signaling by eNOS. A firefly luciferase reporter vector pGL2 (Promega) containing the full-length human tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) promoter (pTNF-GL2) was used to assay for TNFα promoter activity. pTNF-GL2 (20 μg) and a vector (5 μg) for expression of secreted placental alkaline phosphatase (to control for transfection efficiency) were cotransfected into U937 cells with either the eNOS pCEP4 construct (20 μg) or the empty pCEP4 vector (20 μg) using electroporation (240 V, 960 microfarad). Then cells were differentiated with 100 nm PMA for 48 h, and luciferase and secreted placental alkaline phosphatase activity were measured (Promega and Tropix Inc). The human eNOS expression vector was constructed by using the eukaryotic expression vector pCEP4 (Invitrogen) (25.Yan L. Wang S. Rafferty S.P. Wesley R.A. Danner R.L. Blood. 1997; 90: 1160-1167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A Glu361 → Gln361 mutant eNOS cDNA was ligated into pCEP4 atHindIII/NotI sites to create Gln361eNOS. Human Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) cDNA (American Type Culture Collection) was ligated into pCEP4 atHindIII/BamHI sites to generate the SOD expression vector. eNOS NADPH binding site deletion mutants, d(NADPH) eNOS and d(NADPH) Gln361eNOS, were constructed by digesting eNOS and Gln361eNOS with XhoI, thereby removing a 717-base pair fragment from eNOS containing the sequence for its NADPH-adenine binding site. All expression vectors were partially sequenced to confirm the correct sequence and orientation. U937 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in RPMI 1640 complete medium containing HEPES (25 mm), 10% fetal calf serum, l-glutamine (2 mm) and antibiotics. Empty pCEP4 (control vector) or expression vectors containing human eNOS, Gln361eNOS, Cu/Zn SOD, d(NADPH)eNOS, or d(NADPH)Gln361eNOS were transfected into cells by electroporation and then selected with hygromycin B (275 units/ml; Calbiochem), as described previously (25.Yan L. Wang S. Rafferty S.P. Wesley R.A. Danner R.L. Blood. 1997; 90: 1160-1167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After selection, transfectants (1 × 107 cells each) were suspended in 100 ml of RPMI 1640 complete medium and 100 nm PMA for 48 h. Adhered cells were removed by incubation with 1 mm EDTA in Hanks' balanced salt solution without Ca2+ and Mg2+ for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution without Ca2+ and Mg2+, resuspended in RPMI 1640 complete medium, counted, tested for viability, and plated into 24-well plates at 5 × 105 cells/ml for 22 h. In one experiment, untransfected U937 cells were differentiated with PMA, as described above, and then incubated for 22 h with increasing doses of phenazine methosulfate, a O⨪2 donor (28.Gardner P.R. Raineri I. Epstein L.B. White C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13399-13405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Cell-free supernatants were assayed for TNFα using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R & D Systems). NOS activity was determined by measuring the conversion of [14C]l-arginine to [14C]l-citrulline in total cell lysates from PMA-differentiated U937 cells, as reported previously (25.Yan L. Wang S. Rafferty S.P. Wesley R.A. Danner R.L. Blood. 1997; 90: 1160-1167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the aconitase assay, differentiated cells incubated in RPMI complete medium for 22 h were removed by scraper, washed with ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution without Ca2+ and Mg2+, and disrupted using a microtip sonicator. Lysate supernatants were assayed for aconitase activity as described elsewhere (28.Gardner P.R. Raineri I. Epstein L.B. White C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13399-13405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Data are shown as the means ± S.E., and differences were considered significant where p < 0.05. Paired comparisons were performed using t tests. Dose response effects were analyzed using a Sen-Theil estimate of slope followed by a one-sample t test. Three-way comparisons were made using t tests followed by Holm's multiple comparisons adjustment. Two-way analysis of variance followed by Fisher's least significant difference test was used for higher order comparisons. Differentiation of U937 cells with PMA (100 nm) induces development of monocytic characteristics and TNFα production (29.Hass R. Lonnemann G. Mannel D. Topley N. Hartmann A. Kohler L. Resch K. Goppelt-Strube M. Leuk. Res. 1991; 15: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of eNOS expression on TNFα promoter activity, we used a luciferase reporter system in PMA-differentiated U937 cells. As shown in Fig.1 A, eNOS expression increased TNFα promoter activity as compared with control vector transfectants (p = 0.0004). Next we examined whether this increase in TNFα promoter activity resulted in increased TNFα protein production (Fig. 1 B). PMA-differentiated, eNOS-transfected U937 cells produced more TNFα compared with control vector-transfected cells (p = 0.01). However,N ω-methyl-l-arginine (l-NMA), an inhibitor that blocks the NOS activity of eNOS but not its NADPH oxidase activity (30.List B.M. Klosch B. Volker C. Gorren A.C. Sessa W.C. Werner E.R. Kukovetz W.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), did not prevent eNOS enhancement of TNFα production. These findings suggested that eNOS produced a signaling molecule other than NO that up-regulated TNFα production and raised the possibility that this alternative messenger was related to the NADPH oxidase activity of eNOS. To further eliminate the possibility that NO was responsible for TNFα up-regulation by eNOS, we tested the mutant Gln361eNOS, which has a single amino acid substitution from Glu to Gln at position 361 in the l-arginine binding site of wild type eNOS. This mutation abolishes the ability of eNOS to produce NO, but NADPH oxidase activity remains intact (31.Chen P.F. Tsai A.L. Berka V. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6114-6118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Expression of Gln361eNOS (Fig. 1 C) up-regulated TNFα production compared with control vector cells (p = 0.01) and had an effect similar to that of wild type eNOS (p = 0.5). Fig.1 D shows that wild type eNOS and Gln361eNOS were both expressed by their respective transfectants. Further, PMA differentiation is shown to increase expression of eNOS genes incorporated into the pCEP4 vector as described previously (25.Yan L. Wang S. Rafferty S.P. Wesley R.A. Danner R.L. Blood. 1997; 90: 1160-1167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Empty vector transfectants did not express eNOS either before or after PMA differentiation. Thus, two separate experiments, one using a NOS inhibitor (Fig. 1 B) and the other a mutant eNOS unable to produce NO (Fig. 1 C), demonstrate that up-regulation of TNFα by eNOS was independent of NO. Next, phenazine methosulfate, a O⨪2 donor (28.Gardner P.R. Raineri I. Epstein L.B. White C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13399-13405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), was shown to increase TNFα production in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2 A; p = 0.001). This result was consistent with the possibility that ROS generated by eNOS could play a role in TNFα production. To further test whether O⨪2 released by eNOS might be responsible for TNFα up-regulation, Cu/Zn SOD was cotransfected into U937 cells. In PMA-differentiated transfectants (Fig. 2 B), SOD expression was found to totally abolish TNFα up-regulation by eNOS (p = 0.007). eNOS expression was not affected by the coexpression of Cu/Zn SOD (Fig. 2 C). These data suggest that eNOS-induced TNFα production required the production of O⨪2or a closely related metabolite. To investigate the role of NADPH oxidase activity in TNFα up-regulation, the adenine binding site for NADPH was deleted from eNOS. Two NADPH binding site deletion mutants, d(NADPH)eNOS and d(NADPH)Gln361eNOS, were constructed, one from wild type eNOS and the other from Gln361eNOS. Again we found that wild type eNOS expression (Fig.3 A) increased TNFα production compared with control vector (p = 0.002). However, neither d(NADPH)eNOS nor d(NADPH)Gln361eNOS expression significantly altered TNFα production (p = 0.4). This result indicates that the NADPH oxidase activity of eNOS, which requires an intact NADPH recognition site, was necessary for TNFα up-regulation in PMA-differentiated U937 cells. Fig.3 B demonstrates that eNOS and its NADPH binding site deletion mutants were all expressed in the PMA-differentiated cells used for these experiments. Finally, NOS activity and O2 production were measured by l-arginine to l-citrulline conversion (25.Yan L. Wang S. Rafferty S.P. Wesley R.A. Danner R.L. Blood. 1997; 90: 1160-1167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and by aconitase assay (28.Gardner P.R. Raineri I. Epstein L.B. White C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13399-13405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar,32.Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18515-18517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar), respectively, to determine which enzymatic function corresponded to the ability of transfectants to up-regulate TNFα. The presence of NOS activity in cells transfected with wild type human eNOS or with one of the eNOS mutants did not correlate with the capacity to up-regulate TNFα (Fig. 4 A). Only wild type eNOS transfectants were found to have NOS activity compared with control cells (p = 0.001). Although the Gln361eNOS mutant also up-regulated TNFα (Fig.1 C), it was completely devoid of NOS activity (Fig.4 A; compared with control p = 0.3). Next, suppression of aconitase activity was used as a measure of intracellular O⨪2 production (28.Gardner P.R. Raineri I. Epstein L.B. White C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13399-13405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 32.Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18515-18517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Aconitase activity in both wild type eNOS transfectants and Gln361eNOS mutants was lower than that of control vector transfectants (p< 0.0003 for both), indicating the presence of increased O⨪2production (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, both d(NADPH)eNOS and d(NADPH)Gln361eNOS transfected U937 cells, which do not produce increased amounts of TNFα (Fig. 3 A), had aconitase activity similar to that measured in control vector transfectants (Fig.4 B; p = 0.1, for both). This shows, as expected, that the NADPH binding site mutants of eNOS did not produce increased amounts of O⨪2. Notably, l-NMA, a NOS inhibitor, did not change the aconitase activity pattern of eNOS transfectants (p = 0.8), demonstrating that decreases in aconitase activity in eNOS transfectants relative to control vector were not related to NO production (Fig. 4 C) (19.Hausladen A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29405-29408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further, Fig. 4 D shows that eNOS and its respective mutants were expressed in the PMA-differentiated U937 cells used in these experiments. Thus, the ability of various eNOS transfectants to up-regulate TNFα corresponded to their capacity to generate O⨪2 but not NO. Many cell types including endothelial cells, fibroblasts, hepatocytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells have been shown to utilize ROS as second messengers (9.Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J.

These ROS-dependent signal transduction pathways have been shown to regulate important cellular functions such as growth, differentiation, gene expression, and apoptosis. However, even as the signaling mechanisms distal to ROS release are becoming increasingly well defined, identification of the precise enzymatic sources for ROS involved in specific signal transduction events has been relatively elusive (23.Wolin M.S.

The results presented here demonstrate that eNOS may be a source of O⨪2within cells and that eNOS-generated ROS can participate in the modulation of inflammatory responses. eNOS has close homology with cytochrome P-450 reductases (1.Janssens S.P.

In intact cells andin vivo, the availability of substrate and cofactors might be expected to keep this alternative electron shunting pathway inactive. However, several investigations (14.Bouloumie A.

Circulation. 1995; 91: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) using human endothelial cell cultures, canine coronary arteries, or aortic rings from rats and rabbits are consistent with the possibility that eNOS might be capable of releasing oxygen intermediates under certain pathological conditions. Notably, the infusion of BH4 into patients with hypercholesterolemia was shown to restore endothelial-dependent vascular responses (15.Stroes E. Kastelein J. Cosentino F. Erkelens W. Wever R. Koomans H. Luscher T. Rabelink T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), supporting the concept that eNOS dysfunction with impaired NO production and possibly increased O⨪2 formation might occur in vivo (16.Pritchard Jr., K.A.

The capacity of a single enzyme to produce both NO and O⨪2 may have important implications for atherosclerosis (14.Bouloumie A. Bauersachs J. Linz W. Scholkens B.A. Wiemer G. Fleming I. Busse R.

Res. 1996; 78: 1051-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) in which an altered balance between these two free radicals might lead to tissue injury. Direct chemical interaction of NO and O⨪2produces peroxynitrite (ONOO−), a highly toxic metabolite that can damage macromolecules and injure cells (19.Hausladen A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29405-29408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Radi R. Rodriguez M. Castro L. Telleri R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). In addition to the possibility of toxic effects, eNOS-generated O⨪2 and other ROS molecules derived from it, in particular H2O2, are likely to participate in signal transduction events and the regulation of cell function. In our eNOS transfected U937 cells, the molecular identity of the ROS that up-regulates TNFα was not precisely determined. Although Cu/Zn SOD efficiently converts O⨪2 to H2O2 and effectively blocked eNOS-related increases in TNFα production, effector molecules other than O⨪2 may contribute to this response. Manna et al. (13.Manna S.K. Zhang H.J. Yan T. Oberley L.W. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13245-13524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) have shown that redox-dependent activation of NF-κB probably reflects the total cellular balance of a number of prooxidants and antioxidants. Further, Manna et al. suggest that induction of manganese SOD by TNFα and ROS-dependent NF-κB activation may function as a negative feedback loop (13.Manna S.K. Zhang H.J. Yan T. Oberley L.W. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13245-13524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 33.Jones P.L. Ping D. Boss J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6970-6981Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Therefore, ROS up-regulation of TNFα in our system may lead to manganese SOD induction, which might attenuate further proinflammatory responses and thus reduce injury caused by eNOS-generated O⨪2. Notably, vessel shear stress has been shown to increase endothelial cell expression of both Cu/Zn SOD and eNOS (34.Dimmeler S. Hermann C. Galle J. Zeiher A.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Co-regulation of these genes might serve to reduce the prooxidant potential of eNOS and to thereby maximally suppress oxidant-triggered apoptosis (34.Dimmeler S. Hermann C. Galle J. Zeiher A.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In the current investigation, we have shown that eNOS can generate small amounts of O⨪2 in intact cells. This eNOS-derived O⨪2 participated in cell signaling events that regulated the production of TNFα, a pivotal mediator of inflammation. Depending on the cell-type and triggering event investigated, ROS have been shown to transduce signals through the activation of tyrosine kinases, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and c-Jun N-terminal kinases and ultimately to alter promoter activity by increasing the DNA binding of transcription factors such as NFκB and AP-1 (9.Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X.

In recent experiments, we have found in U937 cells that eNOS-based O⨪2signaling activates p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (35.Wang W. Wang S. Wesley R. Danner R. FASEB J. 1999; 13 (abstr.) 132Google Scholar). Therefore, eNOS may occupy a signal bifurcation point controlling the production of two interrelated but distinct free radical messengers. Determining whether this arrangement exists in endothelium and, if so, how it is regulated might lead to an understanding of its possible benefits, given the potential danger it poses for the formation of ONOO−.

Nature. 1997; 388: 629-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). A multitude of ligands are binding to these complement-type repeats, some exhibiting cross-competition such as, for example, tissue-type plasminogen activator and transformed α2-macroglobulin (α2M*), while others do not. This suggests a variety of individual binding sites. So far, no reports have succeeded in identifying single residues as important for the ligand specificity of any LDLR-like receptor. Recently, Rong et al. (32.Rong L. Gendron K. Bates P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8467-8472Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) were able to substitute the fourth ligand binding repeat (LB4) of LDLR into the avian receptor for subgroup A Rous sarcoma virus (the Tva receptor), instead of the single naturally occurring complement-type repeat. They succeeded with only a few mutations converting LB4 residues to residues originally present in the Tva receptor repeat to obtain a chimeric receptor that functioned indistinguishably from the native Tva receptor. This engineered module has three mutations: Ala-19LB4 → LeuTva, Asp-23LB4 → HisTva, and Δ(Pro-34LB4–Gln-35LB4/Arg-36LB4→ GlyTva. Solving the crystal structure of LB5 of LDLR revealed that the residue corresponding to Asp-23LB4 is located on the surface of the molecule with its backbone carbonyl group in a rigid position coordinating a calcium ion (27.Fass D. Blacklow S. Kim P.S. Berger J.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 691-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The solution structure of CR8 from LRP also showed an aspartic acid residue located at the surface at this position (30.Huang W. Dolmer K. Gettins P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14130-14136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This is interesting, since ligand binding has previously been suggested to be dependent on charged residues, but the conserved acidic SDE-cluster, formerly speculated to bind positive charged ligands, is buried in the interior of the module and is in fact coordinating Ca2+. The present study was undertaken to define and characterize the minimal functional unit in LRP binding RAP. Our molecular dissection of the second ligand binding cluster of CR modules of LRP and expression inEscherichia coli now delineate a minimal two-repeat RAP-binding unit and demonstrate the importance of a conserved acidic residue in each RAP-binding CR for the LRP high affinity binding of RAP. A plasmid containing a complete LRP cDNA insert (kindly provided by Dr. J. Herz, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas) served as template in polymerase chain reactions (PCRs), using the following sets of primers to generate ubiquitin (U)-fused expression constructs encoding the four single-repeat derivatives CR3, CR4, CR5, and CR6 and the seven two-repeat derivatives CR34, CR45, CR56, CR67, CR78, CR89, and CR910 corresponding to CR pairs 3–4, 4–5, 5–6, 6–7, 7–8, 8–9, and 9–10.

For U-CR34 (LRP residues Ala-844 to Arg-934), the primer pairs 5′-GGC GGA TCC ATC GAG GGT AGG GCG AAC CCA TCC TAC G-3′ and 5′-GCC AAG CTT AGC GGG CTG AAC AAG TG-3′; for U-CR45 (LRP residues Gln-892 to Pro-974), the primer pairs 5′-GGC CGA TCC ATC GAG GGT AGG CAG CAC ACC TGC CCC-3′ and 5′-GCC AAG CTT AGG GAT AGG CAC ACG AAG-3′; for U-CR56 (LRP residues Ser-932 to His-1013), the primer pairs 5′-GGC GGA TCC ATC GAG GGT AGG TCA GCC CGC ACC TGC-3′ and 5′-GCC AAG CTT AGT GGC TGC AGC CGG-3′; for U-CR67 (LRP residues Tyr-973 to Arg-1057), the primer pairs 5′-GGC GGA TCC ATC GAG GGT AGG TAT CCC ACC TGC TTC-3′ and 5′-GCC AAG CTT ACC TCG TGG CCT GGT TG-3′; for U-CR78 (LRP residues Ser-1012 to His-1102), the primer pairs 5′-GGC GGA TCC ATC GAG GGT AGG AGC CAC TCC TGT TCT AG-3′ and 5′-GCC AAG CTT AGT GGG TCA CTC CCT C-3′; for U-CR89 (LRP residues Thr-1056 to Leu-1143), the primer pairs 5′-GGC GGA TCC ATC GAG GGT AGG ACG AGG CCC CCT GG-3′ and 5′-GCC AAG CTT ACA GGG ACT CGC AGT TC-3′, and for U-CR910 (LRP residues Gly-1099 to Gln-1184), the primer pairs 5′-GGC GGA TCC ATC GAG GGT AGG GGA GTG ACC CAC GTC-3′ and 5′-GCC AAG CTT ACT GGT CGC AGA GCT C-3′ were used. Each set of primers was designed to introduce BamHI andHindIII restriction sites, a sequence encoding a factor Xa cleavage site and a stop codon at appropriate sites in the amplified products. PCR amplification products were digested withBamHI and HindIII and cloned intoBamHI–HindIII-cut E. coli T7 expression vector pT7H6Ubi (15.Ellgaard L. Holtet T.L. Nielsen P.R. Etzerodt M. Gliemann J. Thøgersen H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins encoded by these vector constructs, pT7H6UbiFXCRxy, contain a hexahistidine affinity tag followed by residues 2–76 of human ubiquitin and a factor Xa recognition sequence preceding the receptor fragment, CRxy. Mutations were performed using the Quickchange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and pT7H6UbiFXCR34, pT7H6UbiFXCR45, or pT7H6UbiFXCR56 where appropriate as template for the mutagenesis. As template for the tandem mutant U-CR56D958N,D999N, pT7H6UbiFXCR56D958N was constructed first and then used as template in a second mutagenesis cycle. Mutagenesis primers were from DNA Technology A/S (Aarhus, Denmark). The initial melting temperature of all primers used for mutagenesis was designed to be at least 62 °C, and mutation sites were located in the central region of the primers. All constructs and mutations were verified by DNA sequencing using the Thermo SequenaseTM II dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The RAPd3 expression construct described by Ellgaard et al. (15.Ellgaard L. Holtet T.L. Nielsen P.R. Etzerodt M. Gliemann J. Thøgersen H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was modified to include three additional N-terminal residues (RAP residues 216–218) and an upstream methionine residue to allow removal of the N-terminal fusion partner by CNBr cleavage. Briefly, the extended RAPd3 construct was generated using the oligodeoxynucleotides 5′-GGC GGA TCC ATG GCT GAG TTC GAG GAG CC-3′ and 5′-CAG CCA ACT CAG CTT CCT TTC GGG C-3′ as primers and the pT7H6FXα2MRAP expression plasmid (33.Nykjær A.

The final expression vector, pT7H6UbiMetRAPd3, was obtained by inserting theBamHI–HindIII-digested PCR fragment into the pT7H6Ubi vector (15.Ellgaard L. Holtet T.L. Nielsen P.R. Etzerodt M.

Methods Enzymol. 1987; 135: 102-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Recombinant U-CRxy protein was expressed in E. coli essentially as described (35.Ellgaard L. Holtet T.L. Moestrup S.K. Etzerodt M. Thøgersen H.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 180: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and the protein preparation was applied to a Ni2+-activated nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose column (36.Hochuli E. Dobeli H. Schacher A. J. Chromatogr. 1987; 411: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar) and washed with 8m urea, 500 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (buffer A) until stable A 280 of the effluent. The protein was eluted from the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose with buffer A supplemented with EDTA to 10 mm and loaded to a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) after desalting into 8m urea, 10 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Elution was performed with a NaCl gradient, and when necessary the protein eluate was concentrated by ultrafiltration on a 10-kDa cut-off filter (Amicon). Refolding was carried out by dialysis against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm CaCl2, 3 mm reduced glutathione, and 0.3 mm oxidized glutathione for 24 h at 4 °C. The mixtures of correctly and incorrectly folded U-CRxyfusion proteins were loaded on a RAPd3 column in MB buffer (140 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mmMgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2) supplemented with CaCl2 to a final concentration of 12 mm, at 0.5 ml/min at 4 °C. Bound proteins were eluted with 100 mm glycine-HCl, pH 3.0, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA. Non-RAP-binding and RAPd3-binding derivatives were loaded on a Superdex 75 (Prep grade) 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated in MB buffer and eluted at room temperature at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Pure monomeric fractions eluted at peak position relative to a total column volume of 0.66 (∼14.5 ml). Where appropriate, the U-CRxy was gel-filtrated into 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2 and liberated from the ubiquitin fusion partner by cleavage with the endoproteinase FXausing a 1:50 (w/w) enzyme/substrate ratio and an incubation time of 4–9 h at 4 °C. Uncleaved material, fusion partner, and factor Xa were removed by passage through Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid and factor Xainhibitor Sepharoses (Protein Engineering Technology ApS, Aarhus, Denmark). Extinction coefficients (ε280,m−1 cm−1) used for protein quantification were estimated using the ExPaZy server facilities (on the World Wide Web) to be 15380 (U-CR34, U-CR78), 14660 (U-CR45, U-CR56), 15940 (U-CR67), 13380 (U-CR89), and 8410 (U-CR910). The ε280 predicted for CR34 was verified by amino acid analysis. Aliquots of isolated protein were analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE, followed by either Coomassie staining, where staining intensities for U-CRxy confirmed that the use of ε280 for the proteins was justifiable, or45Ca blotting, essentially as in Ref. 37.Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar. Briefly, identical samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE or transferred to nitrocellulose membrane; washed three times with 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 60 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2; and incubated for 10 min in the same buffer containing 45CaCl2 (1 mCi/liter) before washing with 50% ethanol, drying, and exposure for 24 h before analysis with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Approximately 250 μg of recombinant CR56 were solubilized in 5% formic acid and digested with pepsin using a 1:50 (w/w) enzyme/substrate ratio and an incubation time of 16 h. Following lyophilization, the digest was solubilized in 100 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, and subjected to further proteolysis with trypsin using a 1:50 (w/w) enzyme/substrate ratio and an incubation time of 6 h. Finally, the peptide mixture was subjected to digestion with chymotrypsin using the same conditions as for trypsin. All digestions were at 37 °C. Following digestion and lyophilization, peptides were separated by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a Vydac C18 column using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech system. The peptides were separated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted with a stepwise linear gradient of acetonitrile (B) developed over 50 min (0–5 min, 0% B; 5–40 min, 0–50% B; 40–50 min, 50–95% B) at a flow rate of 0.85 ml/min. The column was operated at 40 °C, and peptides were detected in the effluent by monitoring absorbance at 226 nm. Edman degradation was performed on an Applied Biosystems 477A sequencer equipped with an on-line HPLC. For sample loading, isolated peptides (20–200 pmol) were pipetted onto polybrene-coated glass filters. Mass spectra were acquired with a Bruker BIFLEX matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight instrument (Bruker-Franzen, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a 1-m flight tube, a reflector, a 337-nm nitrogen laser, and a 500-MHz digitizer. Thin film matrix surfaces were prepared using the fast evaporation technique (38.Vorm O. Roepstorff P. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 3281-3287Crossref Scopus (645) Google Scholar) from α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) dissolved in acetone/water (99:1) to 30 μg/μl. A 0.5-μl volume of analyte (0.1–10 pmol/μl) was deposited on the matrix surface and allowed to dry onto the crystals. Spectra were obtained by averaging 20–50 single-shot spectra and calibrated internally by co-crystallizing small amounts of angiotensin II (Sigma) and adrenocorticotropic hormone, fragment 18–39 (Sigma), with the analyte and by using the calibration constants of well known matrix ions. U-CRxyfusion proteins were immobilized on CM5 BIAcore sensor chips using the Amine Coupling Kit as described by the manufacturer (BIAcore, Sweden). After chip activation by the injection of 0.2 m N-ethyl-N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccimide, purified U-CRxy proteins in 25 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2 were diluted to a concentration of 10 μg/ml by the addition of 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, and passed through the BIAcore flow cell at a rate of 5 μl/min. After coupling of proteins, BIAcore chips were capped by exposure to 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. Total protein coupling yields for U-CR34, U-CR56, and U-CR78 were 64/25, 64/47, and 57/17 fmol/mm2 (Chip SM2310D1–98/SM2901E2–99), and for U-CR45, U-CR67, and U-CR89 yields were 33, 40, and 26 fmol/mm2 (Chip SM2903E1–99), respectively. Analyte proteins were desalted into Ca-HBS buffer (HBS buffer with calcium added to 1.5 mm), and protein binding analysis was performed at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Before loading of the protein sample, the chip was equilibrated in Ca-HBS buffer, which also was used as running buffer. Aliquots of 40 μl of protein sample were injected using the KINJECT option, and regeneration of the sensor chip was performed using 1.6 m glycine-HCl, pH 3.0. Kinetic parameters were determined by using the BIAevaluation program version 3.0 (BIAcore, Sweden). Labeling of RAP using the chloramine-T method (39.Nykjær A. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Lookene A. Moestrup S.K. Petersen C.M. Weber W. Beisiegel U. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15048-15055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and ligand competition analysis (15.Ellgaard L.

Human LRP was purified from placenta essentially as described (40.Moestrup S.K. Kaltoft K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12623-12628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, microtiter wells (Nunc Maxisorp, Denmark) were coated with approximately 1 μg/ml LRP by incubation for 16 h at 4 °C in 50 mmNaHCO3, pH 9.6. After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature, the wells were washed three times with MB buffer before incubation with 125I-RAP (∼7000 cpm/well) and 500 nm or 1 μmU-CRxy and derivatives (all proteins were in MB buffer) was performed for 16 h at 4 °C in MB buffer supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin. Following washes with MB buffer, bound radioactivity was released by adding 10% SDS. Nonspecific binding of tracer to wells coated with LRP and inhibited with 10 mmEDTA was determined and subtracted from the values determined in the binding experiments. Fig.1 outlines the structural architecture of LRP and the dissection of the second ligand binding cluster of complement-type repeats (cluster II) into single- or double-repeat fragments produced in E. coli cells. An identified high affinity RAP binding site in LRP (41.Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14011-14017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has previously been located to cluster II (42.Moestrup S.K. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Thøgersen H.C. Nykjær A. Andreasen P.A. Rasmussen H.H. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13691-13696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but none of the tested single repeats (CR3, CR4, CR5, and CR6) displayed affinity for RAP or RAPd3 affinity columns afterin vitro refolding. We subsequently generated a complete set of overlapping two-domain derivatives of cluster II, representing CR pairs CR34, CR45, CR56, CR67, CR78, CR89, and CR910. Except for the last construct, all bound the RAP and RAPd3 affinity matrices used for purification of the constructs. Each RAP affinity-purified derivative was recovered as a pure homogeneous product, producing a well defined single band by SDS-PAGE analysis of nonreduced samples (Fig.2 A). Analysis of crude and affinity-purified receptor fragment preparations by nonreducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 B) showed that the well defined single bands corresponding to the affinity-purified species (U-CR34, U-CR45, U-CR56, U-CR67, U-CR78, and U-CR89) were abundant components in the crude refolding mixture. A similar prominent (i.e. probably correctly folded) component was also present in the crude U-CR910 refolding product, suggestive of efficient refolding of this receptor fragment also. In order to provide further evidence for correct folding we analyzed the disulfide-bridging pattern in one of the refolded, factor Xa-processed, and affinity-purified two-domain products, CR56. A set of disulfide-bridged peptides from digested constructs was isolated by reverse-phase HPLC, characterized by partial sequencing and mass spectrometry, and found compatible with the expected three CysI–CysIII, CysII–CysV, and CysIV–CysVI disulfide bridges of both CR5 and CR6 (a data summary is presented in TableI).Table IVerification of authentic disulfide topology in recombinant CR56A set of disulfide-bridged peptides, accounting for the assignment of all three authentic disulfide bridges, CysI–CysIII, CysII–CysV, and CysIV–CysVI in each domain, was isolated by reverse-phase HPLC after sequential incubation of CR56 two-domain protein with pepsin, trypsin, and chymotrypsin.

Despite their essential nature, the contacts betweenb and the α, β, and a subunits remain largely undefined. We have introduced cysteine residues individually at various positions within the wild type membrane-bound bsubunit, or within b 24–156, a truncated, soluble version consisting only of the hydrophilic C-terminal domain. The introduced cysteine residues were modified with a photoactivatable cross-linking agent, and cross-linking to subunits of the F1 sector or to complete F1F0 was attempted. Cross-linking in both the full-length and truncated forms ofb was obtained at positions 92 (to α and β), and 109 and 110 (to α only). Mass spectrometric analysis of peptide fragments derived from the b 24–156A92C cross-link revealed that cross-linking took place within the region of α between Ile-464 and Met-483. This result indicates that the b dimer interacts with the α subunit near a non-catalytic α/β interface. A cysteine residue introduced in place of the highly conserved arginine at position 36 of the b subunit could be cross-linked to the a subunit of F0 in membrane-bound ATP synthase, implying that at least 10 residues of the polar domain ofb are adjacent to residues of a.

The membrane-integral F0 sector is a proton pore, and inEscherichia coli has a subunit composition ofab 2 c 9–12. The membrane-peripheral F1 sector has a subunit stoichiometry of α3β3γδε. A key feature of the F1 sector, as seen in the bovine heart mitochondrial crystal structure (4.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2733) Google Scholar), is that the α and β subunits alternate in a ring around a lengthy pair of α-helices of γ. Each β subunit bears one catalytic nucleotide-binding site, while non-catalytic nucleotide-binding sites are found on the α subunits. These nucleotide-binding sites are located close to the interfaces between α and β subunits, with one site near each of the six interfaces.Subunits from each sector contribute to the formation of two stalks that join F1 and F0. The γ and ε subunits form the central stalk, rotation of which is believed to be caused by translocation of protons across the membrane by the a andc subunits. This rotation is thought to cause conformational changes in the catalytic sites, driving synthesis of ATP (1.Nakamoto R.K. Ketchum C.J. Al-Shawi M.K. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 205-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It is believed that the α and β subunits are prevented from rotating by a peripheral stalk consisting of δ and the two b subunits (5.Ogilvie I. Wilkens S. Rodgers A.J.W. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A.

Becauseb has a single membrane-spanning region at its N terminus, the remainder of the subunit must span a distance of over 100 Å to come in contact with δ. Consistent with this proposed arrangement, the region of interaction between b and δ has been localized to the C terminus of b (10.McLachlin D.T. Bestard J.A. Dunn S.D. J. Biol.

The propensity of cysteines introduced within residues 2–18 of b to form disulfides suggests that the twob subunits are adjacent to one another in the membrane (27.Dmitriev O. Jones P.C. Jiang W.

Chem. 1999; 274: 15598-15604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).More information about contacts of the second stalk with F1F0 is essential for an understanding of its function in the enzyme complex. In the present work we have introduced cysteine residues into the b subunit at various positions to allow the attachment of chemical cross-linkers. Activation of these cross-linkers and analysis of the resultant products has allowed us to develop a model of the interactions between the b subunits and the rest of the ATP synthase.DISCUSSIONIn the work described here, chemical cross-linking was used to identify sites within the b subunit of E. coliATP synthase that interact with the α, β, and asubunits. The results indicate that the b subunit makes contacts with α through the region spanning residues 92–110, along a non-catalytic α/β interface, and with a at a position 10 residues removed from the membrane-spanning domain of b.Modification of a cysteine introduced intob 24–156 at position 92 with BPM resulted in cross-linking within the region Ile-464 to Met-483 of α. The activated benzophenone is reactive to methylene groups, particularly those adjacent to nitrogen or sulfur, and the cross-linking span of BPM is about 10 Å (45.Dormán G. Prestwich G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5661-5673Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). For comparison, F1 is about 100 Å across and 80 Å high, not counting the stalk (4.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2733) Google Scholar). Using the structure of the highly homologous beef mitochondrial F1 as a model, residues 464–483 of E. coli α (Fig.7, shown in purple) are in the C-terminal helical bundle domain, which is the part of α closest to the membrane. They are predominantly solvent-exposed and are located on the side of α near the non-catalytic α/β interface, well positioned for interaction with the b subunit in its proposed location.Notably, the bA92C site could also be cross-linked to β, confirming that this region of b binds at an α/β interface. Although the location of the cross-link betweenbA92C and β was not conclusively determined, the site is probably within one of the three regions that were not observed in the trypsin mass spectrometry experiment (Fig. 4 A). Because disulfide bond formation studies indicate that the two bsubunits are largely parallel throughout their lengths (7.Rodgers A.J.W. Wilkens S. Aggeler R. Morris M.B. Howitt S.M. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31058-31064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 20.Rodgers A.J.W. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29406-29410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 28.McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the two A92C residues should be proximal in the b dimer and therefore the sites of cross-linking on α and β should also be close together. Therefore, residues β-(113–156) are probably too far away to contain the site of cross-linking. However, residues β-(360–372) and β-(389–399) (red and cyan, respectively, in Fig. 7) are both solvent-exposed and reasonably close to residues 464–483 of α; thus the site of cross-linking to β is probably within one of these regions.To achieve cross-linking of A92C to F1 in the whole ATP synthase complex, it was necessary to strip the membranes of F1 before adding cross-linker. This result implies that position 92 was not accessible to the cross-linker in the presence of F1, suggesting a very close interaction of b and F1. The location of residue 92 of b within a crevice at an α/β interface, as indicated by the sites of cross-linking proposed above, is consistent with this hypothesis.The other site of cross-linking for which mass spectrometric data were collected was at position 109 of b, 17 residues distant from position 92. The region between residues 92 and 109 of b is part of the dimerization domain of b (residues 53–122), which was shown by analytical ultracentrifugation to have a shape consistent with an α-helical coiled-coil structure (18.Revington M.J. McLachlin D.T. Shaw G.S. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31094-31101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Assuming that the sequence from 92 to 109 does assume a helical conformation, one would expect position 109 to be about 25 Å further from the membrane than position 92. While the site of cross-linking between modified I109C and α was not conclusively determined by the trypsin mass spectrometry experiment, several regions of α were not represented among the observed peaks (Fig. 4 B); these regions are candidates for the site of cross-linking. Using the structure of bovine F1 as a reference, we suggest that the site of cross-linking between bI109C and α is within one of the regions 212–250 or 102–106. In particular, the residues corresponding to E. coli α-(213–220) (white in Fig. 7) are solvent-exposed and near the non-catalytic α/β interface, approximately 25 Å above the site of cross-linking betweenbA92C and α. Residues 102–106 (yellow in Fig.7) are also positioned at the surface of the α subunit, slightly further away from the site where the cross-link to bA92C was formed. The other regions implicated in Fig. 4 B, with one exception, are either not exposed to the surface or were judged to be an inappropriate distance from the site of the bA92C cross-link. The one exception was the region between residues 368 and 391, which is on the surface of the α subunit. However, this region is located at the catalytic interface between α and β, and it seems unlikely that the b subunit crosses over to that interface in this area of the complex.The location of the bA92C cross-link to α, 55–65 Å from the surface of the membrane assuming a stalk length of 45 Å (46.Gogol E.P. Lücken U. Capaldi R.A. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), has implications for the structure of b near the membrane. If the model of residues 53–122 as a continuous α-helix (18.Revington M.J. McLachlin D.T. Shaw G.S. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31094-31101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) is accepted, and if this helix extends in a relatively straight line directly toward the membrane, then the N-terminal residue of the helix (residue 53) would be close to the surface of the membrane. Since theb subunit is thought to emerge from the membrane around residue 26 (27), there appear to be about 25 more residues than required to span the distance between the membrane and the site of cross-linking at position 92. The presence of these “extra” residues could partially account for the observation that a functional ATP synthase complex could be formed despite deletions of up to 11 residues within the region of residues 50–75 of b (19.Sorgen P.L. Caviston T.L. Perry R.C. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27873-27878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In light of our ability to cross-link position 36 of b to thea subunit (Fig. 6), it is probable that at least some of the residues of b between positions 26 and 52 interact with the cytoplasmic loops of a. There are a number of possible functions for these interactions. First, they may be important for anchoring the b subunits to a, maintaining the integrity of the stator complex. Second, given the observation that theb subunit is required for the formation of a functional proton pore upon reconstitution of F0 from the purified subunits (47.Schneider E. Altendorf K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7279-7283Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 48.Schneider E. Altendorf K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the interactions between b anda in this region may have a role in assembly and organization of F0. This idea is further supported by evidence implicating the second stalk in the maturation of F0 to a proton-conducting state (49.Takeyama M. Noumi T. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16106-16112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50.Brusilow W.S.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Finally, the effects of mutations at residue bArg-6 on proton pumping (44.Caviston T.L. Ketchum C.J. Sorgen P.L. Nakamoto R.K. Cain B.D. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) suggest the possibility that the interaction of b anda may play a specific functional role, rather than a purely structural role, in coupling.It is also noteworthy that the positioning of the bdimerization helices as shown in Fig. 7 places residues 80–84, which in many species are predicted to form a bend, at the base of the α3β3 hexamer. A flexible joint at this location would allow some angular movement of α3β3 relative to a and the membrane-integral N-terminal helices of the b subunits, as might be expected during stages of rotation.The proposed sites of cross-linking imply that the b subunit dimer contacts the α3β3 hexamer near a non-catalytic interface. Recently, a cysteine residue introduced at the C terminus of b was found to form a disulfide bond with the endogenous Cys-90 of α (20.Rodgers A.J.W. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29406-29410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); the corresponding residue of the bovine heart mitochondrial crystal structure, Arg-90, lies near the catalytic interface between α and β (see Fig. 7, residue inmagenta). The number of residues between the cross-linked positions described here and the C terminus of b is more than sufficient to span the distance from the proposed sites of cross-linking to the top of F1 as an α-helix. Previous evidence has suggested that the region of b C-terminal to residue 122 may form a more globular structure (10.McLachlin D.T. Bestard J.A. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15162-15168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 18.Revington M.J. McLachlin D.T. Shaw G.S. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31094-31101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore a location of the C-terminal residue of b close to the catalytic interface is consistent with our current picture of theb subunit.The work presented here suggests a close interaction of theb subunits with a, α, and β. It remains unclear what structural perturbations, if any, take place within theb subunit during the course of catalysis. Since the rotary mechanism of catalysis predicts that the second stalk resists considerable torque, extended α-helices within b could undergo elastic stretching or bending as ATP is synthesized or hydrolyzed. Additional studies are required to determine the extent ofb movements during catalysis. In particular it would be interesting to discover whether covalent linkage of the band α subunits in the C-terminal domain of α would have an effect on the function of the ATP synthase complex. ATP synthase, or F1F0-ATPase, utilizes a transmembrane proton gradient to synthesize ATP and is responsible for the final step in oxidative phosphorylation and photophosphorylation. The enzyme (reviewed in Refs. 1.Nakamoto R.K. Ketchum C.J. Al-Shawi M.K. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 205-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 2.Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev.

The membrane-integral F0 sector is a proton pore, and inEscherichia coli has a subunit composition ofab 2 c 9–12. The membrane-peripheral F1 sector has a subunit stoichiometry of α3β3γδε. A key feature of the F1 sector, as seen in the bovine heart mitochondrial crystal structure (4.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2733) Google Scholar), is that the α and β subunits alternate in a ring around a lengthy pair of α-helices of γ. Each β subunit bears one catalytic nucleotide-binding site, while non-catalytic nucleotide-binding sites are found on the α subunits. These nucleotide-binding sites are located close to the interfaces between α and β subunits, with one site near each of the six interfaces. Subunits from each sector contribute to the formation of two stalks that join F1 and F0. The γ and ε subunits form the central stalk, rotation of which is believed to be caused by translocation of protons across the membrane by the a andc subunits. This rotation is thought to cause conformational changes in the catalytic sites, driving synthesis of ATP (1.Nakamoto R.K. Ketchum C.J. Al-Shawi M.K. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 205-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It is believed that the α and β subunits are prevented from rotating by a peripheral stalk consisting of δ and the two b subunits (5.Ogilvie I. Wilkens S. Rodgers A.J.W. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A.

Becauseb has a single membrane-spanning region at its N terminus, the remainder of the subunit must span a distance of over 100 Å to come in contact with δ. Consistent with this proposed arrangement, the region of interaction between b and δ has been localized to the C terminus of b (10.McLachlin D.T. Bestard J.A. Dunn S.D. J. Biol.

However, following cell-cell adhesion, cadherin-6 becomes stabilized and accumulates by >50-fold at cell-cell contacts while the E-cadherin level increases only 5-fold during the same period. To investigate a role of β-catenin in regulation of cadherin expression in MDCK cells, we examined the effects of expressing signaling-active β-catenin mutants (ΔGSK, ΔN90, and ΔN131). In these cells, while levels of E-cadherin, α- and β-catenin are similar to those in control cells, levels of cadherin-6 are significantly reduced due to rapid degradation of newly synthesized protein. Additionally, these cells appeared more motile and less cohesive, as expression of ΔGSK-β-catenin delayed the establishment of tight confluent cell monolayers compared with control cells. These results indicate that the level of cadherin-6, but not that of E-cadherin, is strictly regulated post-translationally in response to Wnt signaling, and that E-cadherin and cadherin-6 may contribute different properties to cell-cell adhesion and the epithelial phenotype.

Misexpression of cadherins has been correlated with altered adhesion phenotypes of numerous cancers, and it has been proposed that E-cadherin can function as a tumor suppressor gene (7.Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 8.Perl A.K. Wilgenbus P. Dahl U. Semb H. Christofori G.

Nature. 1998; 392: 402-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of cadherins mediates calcium-dependent, homotypic binding between opposed cells, and the intracellular domain binds cytoplasmic proteins, termed catenins (10.Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). β-Catenin binds directly to the cytoplasmic domain of cadherin and to α-catenin, an actin-binding protein (11.Jou T.S. Stewart D.B. Stappert J. Nelson W.J. Marrs J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5067-5071Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). This hierarchy of protein interactions connects the cadherin-catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton, thereby leading to the clustering and stabilization of the complex at the plasma membrane (12.Rimm D.L. Koslov E. Kebriaei P. Cianci D. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8813-8817Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 13.Ozawa M. Ringwald M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4246-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). β-Catenin binding is also required for efficient transport of cadherin to the plasma membrane (14.Chen Y.T. Stewart D.B. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 687-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in cell adhesion, β-catenin is a homolog of the Drosophila segment polarity protein armadillo and a central player in the Wnt/Wg signaling pathway (15.Willert K. Nusse R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 16.Bullions L.C. Levine A.J. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1998; 10: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Activation of this pathway results in inhibition of Zw-3/GSK-3β1 kinase, leading to the accumulation of hypophosphorylated β-catenin/armadillo (15.Willert K. Nusse R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 17.Peifer M. Sweeton D. Casey M. Wieschaus E. Development. 1994; 120: 369-380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This signaling-active form of β-catenin is in a low molecular weight pool and is not complexed with E-cadherin (18.Papkoff J. Rubinfeld B. Schryver B. Polakis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2128-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 19.Barth A.I. Stewart D.B. Nelson W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4947-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Accumulation of β-catenin in this pool is thought to drive it into a complex with members of the TCF/Lef-1 family of transcription factors in the nucleus where the complex directly activates target gene transcription (20.Behrens J. von Kries J.P. Kuhl M. Bruhn L. Wedlich D. Grosschedl R. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 382: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (2605) Google Scholar, 21.Huber O. Korn R. McLaughlin J. Ohsugi M. Herrmann B.G. Kemler R. Mech. Dev. 1996; 59: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). In the absence of Wnt signaling, GSK-3β is active and β-catenin is phosphorylated, which leads to rapid ubiquitination and degradation of cytosolic β-catenin by the 26 S proteasome (19.Barth A.I. Stewart D.B. Nelson W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4947-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 22.Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 16641-16645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Deletions (ΔN90, ΔN131) or amino acid substitutions (ΔGSK) of putative N-terminal phosphorylation sites for GSK-3β in β-catenin result in a signaling-active form of β-catenin that can induce TCF-mediated gene transcription (19.Barth A.I. Stewart D.B. Nelson W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4947-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although many studies have examined the effects of cadherin overexpression, misexpression, and inhibition on cellular organization, little is known about mechanisms involved in the regulation of endogenous cadherin expression and function (24.Dufour S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 521-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 25.Heasman J. Crawford A. Goldstone K. Garner H.P. Gumbiner B. McCrea P. Kintner C. Noro C.Y. Wylie C. Cell. 1994; 79: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). The involvement of β-catenin in both cell-cell adhesion and a signaling pathway raises the possibility that these two pathways are connected. Although it has been reported that over-expression of Wnt-1 in AtT20 cells correlates with increased levels of β-catenin and N-cadherin and with increased calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion (26.Hinck L. Nelson W.J. Papkoff J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 729-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), a similar study in PC12 cells revealed an apparent decrease in cell-cell adhesion (27.Bradley R.S. Cowin P. Brown A.M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1857-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Additionally, the promoter for the E-cadherin gene has an upstream consensus sequence for TCF binding which could be a target for β-catenin/TCF regulation (21.Huber O. Korn R. McLaughlin J. Ohsugi M. Herrmann B.G. Kemler R. Mech. Dev. 1996; 59: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). However, studies with mutant forms of E-cadherin and armadillo in Drosophila indicate that the adhesion and signaling properties of β-catenin are separate (28.Orsulic S. Peifer M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1283-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 29.Sanson B. White P. Vincent J. Nature. 1996; 383: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). We sought to further define members of cadherin- and catenin-containing complexes in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and to examine changes in these complexes in the presence and absence of signaling-active forms of β-catenin. We have identified cadherin-6 as a second, major cadherin in MDCK cells. Significantly, we demonstrate differential regulation of E-cadherin and cadherin-6 expression and function in these cells, both after initiation of cell-cell contact and in response to the expression of β-catenin mutants, which activate the Wnt-1/Wg signaling pathway. Madin-Darby canine kidney type II/J (MDCK J) and MDCK type II/G (MDCK G) cells have been described previously (30.Mays R.W. Siemers K.A. Fritz B.A. Lowe A.W. van Meer G. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1105-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). MDCK clone T23 (MDCK T23), ΔN90, ΔN131, and ΔGSK cell lines have also been described previously (19.Barth A.I. Stewart D.B. Nelson W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4947-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 31.Barth A.I.M. Pollack A.L. Altschuler Y. Mostov K.E. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 693-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). MDCK T23, ΔN90, ΔN131, and ΔGSK cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with either without (−Dox) or with (+Dox) an additional 20 ng/ml doxycycline (Sigma) for a minimum of 5 consecutive days prior to use to regulate exogenous gene expression of mutant β-catenins. 3G8 mouse monoclonal antibody, specific for the extracellular domain of canine E-cadherin (32.Shore E.M. Nelson W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19672-19680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against α-catenin, β-catenin, plakoglobin (26.Hinck L. Nelson W.J. Papkoff J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 729-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), and the cytoplasmic domain of mouse E-cadherin (33.Marrs J.A. Napolitano E.W. Murphy E.C. Mays R.W. Reichardt L.F. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) have been described previously. Monoclonal antibodies specific for β-catenin, E-cadherin, and desmoglein-1 were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Polyclonal antibodies specific for cadherin-6 (SpK3) were raised in rabbits against the peptide sequence PHVEPRFLYLGPFKDSC, coupled through the cysteine to maleimide activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce). For chase and pulse-chase metabolic labeling experiments, 2.5 × 106 cells were seeded on 24-mm collagen-coated Transwell filters (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY) and grown for 3 days. When labeling to steady-state, cells on filters were washed three times with labeling medium (DMEM minus methionine/cysteine (Met/Cys)) incubated for 22 h in overnight labeling medium (labeling medium with 10% DMEM (v/v)) with 0.4 mCi of [35S]Met/Cys added to the basolateral side of each Transwell filter. 0.4 mCi of additional radioactive label was added to the basolateral side after 11 h of incubation. Cells were then either harvested immediately (0 h chase) or washed three times with chase medium (DMEM supplemented with 10,000-fold excess unlabeled Met/Cys), incubated for 1 or 6 h, and then extracted in 1.1 ml of CSK buffer (50 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 10 mm PIPES pH 6.8, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (0.1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Pefabloc (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, antipain, chymostatin, and pepstatin A). Extracts were centrifuged 20 min at 22,000 × g, and when indicated, the remaining pellet (CSK insoluble) was solubilized by boiling in 100 μl of 1% SDS buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% SDS (w/v), 1 mm EDTA) and then diluted with 1 ml of CSK buffer prior to processing for immunoprecipitation. For determination of molecular ratios, the number of methionines and cysteines per protein were estimated based on sequences submitted to GenBank™: murine E-cadherin, 12; rat K-cadherin, 16. For pulse-chase experiments, cells on filters were washed two times with labeling medium, preincubated for 30 min in labeling medium, and pulse-labeled for 15 min at 37 °C in labeling medium + 250 μCi of [35S]Met/Cys per filter. After the labeling period, cells were chased for times indicated and harvested as described above for chase samples. Superose 6 size exclusion chromatography was performed as described previously except that DHE buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) replaced MEBC buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) throughout (1.Stewart D.B. Nelson W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29652-29662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitations, extracts were preincubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 5 μl of preimmune serum and 35 μl of Pansorbin cells (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), and then centrifuged 10 min at 22,000 × g. 10 μl of antibody specific for β-catenin, 20 μl of antibody specific for cadherin-6, or 500 μl of 3G8 supernatant were preincubated 18 h at 4 °C with 65 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose (β-catenin and cadherin-6) or protein G-Sepharose (3G8) and washed one time with 1 ml of CSK prior to addition of cell extract. Extract-antibody mixtures were rotated 4–6 h at 4 °C, and then washed once with high stringency buffer (HSB; 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA), once with HSB + 1 m NaCl, and then twice with HSB. 65 μl of 2× sample buffer was added to each sample, and samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min prior to loading on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. 1% SDS total protein extracts, protein concentration determination, gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (1.Stewart D.B. Nelson W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29652-29662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Metabolically labeled samples were processed as described previously and quantified using a Storm 820 PhosphorImager system (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) (34.Hinck L. Nathke I.S. Papkoff J. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1327-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Phase contrast microscopy was performed as described previously (1.Stewart D.B. Nelson W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29652-29662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For indirect immunofluorescence, 2 × 105 cells were plated on collagen-coated glass coverslips and grown for 48–72 h. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, 8.1 mm NaHPO4) with 0.008% SDS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized with CSK, blocked with 5% goat serum, and incubated with antibodies specific for E-cadherin, cadherin-6, or β-catenin. After washing, cells were incubated with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). All antibodies for immunofluorescence were used at 1:100 dilution. Slides were viewed using an Axioplan microscope equipped for epifluorescence (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) and photographed using Fujichrome Provia 400 color reversal film (Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan). MDCK cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/100-mm culture dish, and total RNA was extracted 2 days after plating with the RNeasy Total RNA kit as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RT-PCR was performed with the 5′ primer223GGCAAGTTACATTCAGACCAGGATAGAGGAGATGGATC260and the 3′ primer1961TCTCTGATGTCCTCTTTGGAAATGATCAAAGGCTC1927using total RNA from T23 MDCK cells cultured without Dox and the Access RT-PCR kit as described by the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI). The 1.7-kb PCR cDNA product was cloned into the SmaI site of Bluescript pSK+/− (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The identity of the cloned cDNA, encoding a region corresponding to amino acids 75–653 in human cadherin-6, was confirmed by sequencing. This sequenced region encoded a peptide with 95% sequence identity to mouse cadherin-6 (GenBank™ accession no. D82029), 97% identity to rat cadherin-6 (GenBank™ accession no. D25290) and 98% identity to human cadherin-6 (GenBank™ accession no. D31784). For comparison the homology between human and rat cadherin-6 is 97% for the mature protein. A 1.5-kbSacI fragment of the MDCK cadherin-6 cDNA or aBamHI/XhoI fragment with the complete human α-tubulin cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. Eugenio de Hostos, University of California, San Francisco) was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the high prime DNA labeling kit as described by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The labeled cDNAs were separated from unincorporated nucleotides with a Sephadex G-50 DNA column (Nick Column; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used as a probe for hybridization to Northern blots of total RNA from the different MDCK cell lines. Agarose gel electrophoresis, Northern blotting onto Hybond NX nylon membrane, and hybridization were performed as described by the manufacturer of the nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were seeded and grown on 24-mm Transwell filters as described above. Cells were biotinylated at 4 °C with 20 μg/ml non-reducible biotin (NHS-biotin; Pierce), washed five times with ice cold Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), three times with Hepes-buffered saline (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), extracted in DHE buffer with inhibitors, and processed as described previously (1.Stewart D.B. Nelson W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29652-29662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To clear glycosylated proteins from samples, extracts were incubated with either concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B (Sigma) or with Sepharose 4B as a control. For detection of biotinylated proteins, membranes were blocked overnight in TBS + 7.5% ovalbumin, washed once with TBS, twice with TBS + 0.1% Tween 20, incubated with HRP-avidin (Vectastain ABC kit; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), washed six times with TBS + 0.1% Tween 20, then visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In previous studies, we identified two high molecular weight complexes containing α- and β-catenin in MDCK cells (1.Stewart D.B. Nelson W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29652-29662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). One of these complexes contained E-cadherin, but the components of the other complex were not defined. In order to identify proteins in this second high molecular weight complex, we used a β-catenin antibody to immunoprecipitate protein complexes from [35S]Met/Cys-labeled MDCK cell extracts that had been fractionated by Superose 6 gel FPLC (Fig.1 A). The β-catenin immunoprecipitates from fractions containing high molecular weight catenin complexes (fractions 15–20) had four proteins, three of which could be identified by their apparent molecular masses and reactivity to specific antibodies: proteins of 120, 102, and 95 kDa, corresponding to E-cadherin, α-catenin, and β-catenin, respectively. A protein of 130 kDa did not react with any of these antibodies (Fig. 1 A,arrowhead). Note that the 120-kDa protein (E-cadherin) eluted in a peak at fraction 16, whereas the unknown 130-kDa protein eluted in a peak at fraction 17. α-Catenin and β-catenin co-eluted in a peak between fractions 16 and 17. To confirm that the 130-kDa protein was not E-cadherin, we first immune-depleted [35S]Met/Cys-labeled MDCK cell extracts of E-cadherin by six consecutive rounds of immunoprecipitations with an anti-E-cadherin antibody. Note that, in addition to E-cadherin, these antibodies recognize several classical cadherins, including P- and N-cadherin (11.Jou T.S. Stewart D.B. Stappert J. Nelson W.J. Marrs J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5067-5071Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Following immune depletion, extracts were fractionated by Superose 6 FPLC. β-Catenin immunoprecipitates from the E-cadherin immune-depleted lysate prior to FPLC fractionation (Fig. 1 B, −EC) and following Superose 6 FPLC fractionation (Fig.1 B, fractions 15–20) contained three major proteins, the unidentified 130-kDa protein and α-catenin and β-catenin, all of which co-eluted as a complex in a peak at fraction 17. As expected, E-cadherin was not present in any of these column fractions. To begin the characterization of the 130-kDa protein, we examined whether it was a cell surface glycoprotein (Fig. 1, C–E). Cells grown on Transwell filters were biotinylated for 20 min at 4 °C with a non-reducible biotin (sulfo-NHS-biotin), and subsequently extracted with DHE buffer (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Extracts were incubated with concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B (Fig. 1, C–E, lanes 2and 4) to bind glycosylated proteins, or with Sepharose 4B beads (Fig. 1, C–E, lanes 1 and3) as a control. Following centrifugation to remove the beads, the remaining extract was immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies against either E-cadherin (Fig. 1, C–E,lanes 1 and 2) or β-catenin (Fig. 1,C–E, lanes 3 and 4). Using avidin-HRP to detect biotinylated proteins, E-cadherin immunoprecipitates contained a 120-kDa protein (Fig. 1 C,lane 1), and the β-catenin immunoprecipitate contained 120- and 130-kDa cell surface proteins (Fig. 1 C,lane 3). Neither the 120- nor 130-kDa biotinylated protein was detected in immunoprecipitates from extracts pre-cleared with concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B (Fig. 1 C,lanes 2 and 4), indicating that they were both glycoproteins. As predicted, E-cadherin and β-catenin were detected in E-cadherin and β-catenin immunoprecipitates from extracts pre-cleared with Sepharose 4B beads (Fig. 1, D andE, lanes 1 and 3). Additionally, neither E-cadherin nor β-catenin was detected in the E-cadherin immunoprecipitates from concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B-treated extracts (Fig. 1, D and E, lane 2), and only a small amount of β-catenin remained in β-catenin immunoprecipitates from concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B-treated extracts (Fig. 1, D and E, lane 4). Additional β-catenin immunoprecipitations were performed on extracts from cells grown on filters and biotinylated as above. Extracts were either untreated (Fig. 1, C–E, +E-cad,lane 5) or were immune-depleted of E-cadherin (Fig. 1, C–E, −E-cad, lane 6) prior to immunoprecipitation. Again, avidin-HRP revealed the presence of 120- and 130-kDa biotinylated proteins co-immunoprecipitated with β-catenin from untreated samples (Fig.1 C, lane 5), and a 130-kDa biotinylated protein in β-catenin immunoprecipitations from E-cadherin immune-depleted extracts (Fig. 1 C,lane 6). No E-cadherin, and only a reduced level of β-catenin, was detected in the β-catenin immunoprecipitate from the extract that had been immune-depleted of E-cadherin (Fig. 1,D and E, lane 6) relative to the untreated control β-catenin immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1,D and E, lane 5). Together, these data indicate that p130 is a glycosylated, cell surface protein that binds β-catenin and is not recognized by a polyclonal antibody raised against the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin. In order to identify p130, we performed large scale β-catenin immunoprecipitations of this protein complex to obtain sufficient amounts of p130 for peptide microsequencing. Sequence analysis of three peptides from the 130-kDa protein revealed an exact match with corresponding sequences in rat K-cadherin and human cadherin-6 (Fig.1 F). To analyze cadherin-6 expression in MDCK cells, we generated a polyclonal antibody (SpK3) against a peptide (PHVEPRFLYLGPFKDSC) whose sequence is found in the extracellular domain of cadherin-6, but not in E-cadherin or other known cadherins. In Fig.2 A, total protein from a 1% SDS extract of MDCK T23 cells was processed for immunoblotting with the anti-cadherin-6 antibody. In Fig. 2 B, equal amounts of total protein from three independent lines of MDCK cells were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and processed for immunoblotting with antibodies specific for cadherin-6, E-cadherin, and β-catenin. The antibody generated against the cadherin-6 peptide sequence recognized a single 130-kDa protein in all three cell lines. To further test the specificity of the antibodies, SpK3 (cadherin-6) and 3G8 (E-cadherin) antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate and immunoblot cadherin-6 and E-cadherin complexes from MDCK cell CSK extracts (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). The E-cadherin immunoprecipitate contained E-cadherin but not cadherin-6 (Fig. 2 C, lane 1), while the cadherin-6 immunoprecipitate contained cadherin-6 but not E-cadherin (Fig. 2 C, lane 2). The level of cadherin-6 in CSK extracts from MDCK cells was not reduced following immune depletion of E-cadherin, while the level of β-catenin was reduced by approximately 60%, consistent with the removal of one of β-catenin's binding partners from the extract (Fig. 2 D,lanes 1 and 2). β-Catenin immunoprecipitates from similar CSK extracts contained both cadherin-6 and E-cadherin (Fig. 2 D, lane 3), while extracts immune depleted of E-cadherin removed all of the fraction of β-catenin associated with E-cadherin and left the level of cadherin-6 unaltered (Fig. 2 D, lanes 3 and 4). These data indicate strongly that E-cadherin and cadherin-6 are in separate complexes containing β-catenin. We next sought to determine the relative amounts of E-cadherin and cadherin-6 associated with β-catenin. MDCK cells were grown on Transwell filters, labeled with [35S]Met/Cys for 20 h, and then extracted with CSK buffer. Extracts were divided into three equal portions and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies specific for cadherin-6, E-cadherin, or β-catenin (Fig.2 E). The cadherin-6 immunoprecipitate (Fig. 2 E,C6) contained major proteins of 130, 102, and 95 kDa that correspond to cadherin-6, α-catenin, and β-catenin, respectively. E-cadherin immunoprecipitates (EC) contained 120-kDa E-cadherin, and α- and β-catenin. Proteins in the β-catenin immunoprecipitate (BC) were identified as cadherin-6, E-cadherin and α- and β-catenin. Quantification of the relative amounts of cadherin-6 and E-cadherin in the β-catenin immunoprecipitate, when corrected for differences in methionine and cysteine contents, revealed E-cadherin (120 kDa) and cadherin-6 (130 kDa) in an ∼3:2 ratio (Fig. 2 E). In order to confirm that cadherin-6 is part of a high molecular weight protein complex with catenins, MDCK cells were extracted with DHE buffer and fractionated by Superose 6 FPLC (Fig.3). Immunoblot analysis showed that cadherin-6 eluted in a single, high molecular weight peak at fraction 17. E-cadherin eluted in a single high molecular weight peak with a peak at fraction 16. Significantly, the distributions of cadherin-6 and E-cadherin overlapped with that of the high molecular weight pool of catenins in fractions 15–19. In summary, these data demonstrate that cadherin-6 is present at a level similar to that of E-cadherin in confluent monolay"

It is unknown if these interactions are subject to control and modulation by developmental cues and thus have tissue or stage specificity. By using promoter sequences containing a canonical HSE from the αB-crystallin gene, we demonstrate a tissue-specific transition from monomeric (in fetal and early neonatal stages that lack oligomeric HSF·HSE complexes) to oligomeric HSF-HSE interactions by postnatal day 10–21 in the ocular lens. Developmental control of these interactions is further demonstrated by induction of oligomeric HSF·HSE complexes in neonatal extracts by in vitro manipulations, interestingly, only in the lens and not in the brain, heart, or liver extracts. The exclusive presence of oligomeric HSF·HSE complexes in the postnatal/adult lens corresponds to known highly increased number of αB-crystallin transcripts in this tissue.

Transcriptional activation is brought about by the interaction of the heat shock element (HSE)1 and the pre-existing transactivating protein, the heat shock factor (HSF). With the exception in yeast, in which the HSF is constitutively bound to DNA, interaction of HSF with HSE is initiated by trimerization of the monomeric HSF. Most of our knowledge about activation of HSF and its binding to HSE comes from cells cultured in vitro that have been subjected to a physical or chemical stress (1.Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev.

Although the highest amount of αB protein is found in the ocular lens, appreciable expression of the αB-crystallin gene is detected very early in the developing heart (13.Bhat S.P. Nagineni C.N.

Elevated expression of αB has been associated with a myriad of pathologies such as desmin-related cardiomyopathy and cataractogenesis (15.Vicart P. Caron A. Guicheney P. Li A. Prevost M. Faure A.

Increased levels of αB have been reported in NIH3T3 cells transformed with plasmids expressing v-mos and Ha-rasoncogenes (reviewed in Refs. 19.de Jong W.W. Leunissen J.A.M. Voorter C.E.M. Mol. Biol.

Given its wide range of expression and the presence of a canonical HSE in its promoter, theαB-crystallin gene presents an attractive paradigm for investigating the potential HSF-HSE interactions in the context of developmental control and tissue-specific expression. The rodent (21.Quax-Jeuken Y. Quax W. van Rens G. Khan M. Bloemendal H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5819-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 22.Srinivasan A.N. Bhat S.P.

Genomics. 1990; 7: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) have been well characterized. The rat αB-crystallin gene employs one predominant transcription initiation site, 44 base pairs upstream from the ATG. The sequences between −164/+44 of the mouseαB-crystallin gene have been suggested to regulate lens-specific expression in transgenic mice (25.Gopal-Srivastava R. Piatigorsky J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1281-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The HSE is one of the significant landmarks of these sequences. Activation of the αB heat shock promoter-reporter gene constructs upon exposure to heat stress in cultured cells (26.Klemenz T. Frohli E. Steiger R.H. Schafer T. Aoyama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3652-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) and HSF1 binding to HSE in the αB promoter in rat astrocytes, exposed to osmotic and chemical stress, have been demonstrated (27.Head M.W. Hurwitz L. Goldman J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1029-1039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are two HSEs in the ratαB-crystallin gene promoter (22.Srinivasan A.N. Bhat S.P. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 651-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) as follows: a dimeric HSE (5′-GGAAGATTCC-3′) with the 5′-NGAAN-3′ motifs arranged in a head:head fashion at position −391 and a trimeric element that contains the pentamer motif arranged in a tail:tail-head:head order at position −54. In this report we have used this HSE (HSEαB) (Fig. 1) to explore the status of HSF-HSE interactions in four rat tissues (lens, liver, heart, and brain) that express αB-crystallin differentially. We also investigated the temporally dictated appearance of the oligomeric HSF·HSE complexes in the developing ocular lens. Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA.). Newborn rat pups, 3–4 days after birth, and rats of different ages were sacrificed under ether, and different organs were harvested for the preparation of whole cell extracts (WCEs). Oligonucleotide probes were synthesized on an ABI DNA synthesizer (Perkin-Elmer) or purchased from commercial sources (Life Technologies, Inc.). Protein standard markers were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The oligonucleotide probes were end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) with [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products) (28.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Harvested tissues (400–500 mg) were rinsed in cold tissue culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum) before extraction. WCEs were prepared according to the procedure described previously (29.Manley J.L. Fire A. Cano A. Sharp P.A. Gefter M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3855-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. After the final ammonium sulfate precipitation the 16,000 ×g pellet was dissolved in 0.1 volume of the supernatant in dialysis buffer (200 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mmKCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.9, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 17% glycerol) and dialyzed (Spectropor membranes, 3500-kDa cut-off, Pierce). After 10–12 h of initial dialysis, the buffer was changed and dialysis continued for an additional 2-h period. After a brief centrifugation in a microcentrifuge to remove any insolubles, aliquots (20–30 μl per tube) were quick-frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. The aliquots were used only once. Protein estimation was done using the BCA assay kit (Pierce). Gel mobility-shift assays were performed as described (30.Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). Twenty to thirty femtomoles of32P-labeled oligonucleotides and whole cell extracts (∼30 μg of protein) were used in a typical assay that contained 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 40 mm KCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, 10% glycerol, 1.0 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Sigma), and 250 μg/ml of bovine serum albumin (New England Biolabs). The reaction mix was assembled on ice and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. Whole reaction volumes were electrophoresed on an 8% acrylamide gel in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 40 mm glycine, and 1 mm EDTA. The gels were run until the tracking dye (bromphenol blue), loaded a few minutes ahead of the reaction mix, reached the bottom. The gels were transferred onto Whatman DE81 paper, dried, and exposed to Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at −70 °C with or without an intensifier screen. For super-shift experiments, we used a commercially available anti-human HSF1 antibody (ABR Inc., Golden, CO). For these reactions we first determined the minimum amount of WCE needed for obtaining the bound complexes. This minimum amount was then used in the super-shift reactions. This was done to optimize the interaction of the antibody with the gel-shift complexes. The DNA-protein complexes resolved in the gel-shift assays were exposed to UV (in-gel), (Stratalinker, Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA). The gels were kept at a distance of 4–5 cm from the UV source. The top 3–4 cm of the gel (containing all the three complexes, see Fig. 3 A) were cut away and equilibrated with the SDS-PAGE running buffer and run in the second dimension on 12.5% denaturing gels. The gels were dried before autoradiography. A gel mobility-shift assay using HSEαB with WCEs, made from the neonatal rat lens (3–4-day-old), produces three complexes (I, II, and III) (Fig. 1 and Figs.Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). The formation of these three complexes is dependent on the presence of 5′-NGAAN-3′ motifs in the probe as ascertained by using HSEαB probes, M1 and M2, mutated at different positions in the HSE. Using HSEαB-M1 oligonucleotide, wherein all the 5′- NGAAN-3′ motifs were mutated, abolished almost all the complexes (Fig. 1 A, M1). However, HSEαB-M2 oligonucleotide, which retained one 5′-NGAAN-3′ motif, showed reduced intensity of binding in all complexes (Fig. 1 A, M2) in comparison to the wild-type HSEαB. Competition experiments demonstrated the specific nature of the three complexes. An oligonucleotide competitor containing consensus HSE sequences (HSEcon) competes efficiently with HSEαB, whereas HSE probe derived from the promoter of the hsp82 gene is a less efficient competitor (Fig. 1 B).Figure 2Effect of temperature on the generation of complex III. The WCE (10-day lens) was preincubated for 5 min at indicated temperatures ( °C) and then added to the gel-shift assay reaction containing 32P-HSEαB as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Note that with increase in temperature there is a decrease in the intensity of the complexes I and II, with concomitant increase in the intensity of the complex III. The top panel shows the relevant autoradiograph and the bottom panel the corresponding densitometric scan.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although of reproducible mobility, the complexes I–III varied in intensity from experiment to experiment. This was particularly the case with complex III. Most of the fresh extracts made from neonatal 3–4-day-old rat lenses either produced a very weak intensity complex III or none at all. We discovered that this variability was created by the length of time that a particular lens extract spent in storage before the assay was conducted. The longer the period of storage the higher the intensity of the complex III (data not shown). We used these stored extracts to study the effect of other parameters such as pH on the generation of HSF·HSEαB complexes. At pH 6.0 only a weak complex I was obtained. At pH 7.9, the formation of the complex III is most favored (data not shown). Fig. 2 shows the temperature dependence of the appearance of complex III. There seems to be an inverse relationship between the intensities of complexes I and II and the complex III as the temperature of incubation is increased. Incubation of liver extracts at higher temperatures did not produce complex III, and the pH optima for the only complex obtained (complex I) in liver (see below) was 6.5 (data not shown). In order to understand the relationship of the three complexes obtained with lens extracts to data published previously (4.Baler R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2486-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 27.Head M.W. Hurwitz L. Goldman J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1029-1039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P.

Commun. 1994; 201: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), we ran a gel mobility-shift assay using lens and liver WCEs. Interestingly, with the liver WCEs only one complex is obtained in comparison to three complexes obtained with the lens WCE (Fig.3 A). Complex I obtained with the liver and lens extracts has similar mobility. Complexes I and II have molecular masses between 70 and 87 kDa (Fig. 3 A), suggesting that these two complexes possibly represent monomeric complexes of HSF with HSEαB. The molecular mass of complex III is more than 200 kDa. Thus the complex III seems to be an oligomeric complex (at least trimeric) of HSF with HSEαB (Fig. 3 A). The following observation further strengthen this assessment. The commercially available recombinant HSF1 (which is known to exist as a trimer), when used in the gel mobility-shift assay with HSEαB also produces a complex of mobility similar to the complex III (Fig.3 B). The generation of complex III with recombinant HSF1 is, however, very inefficient, possibly due to lack of other molecular inputs (in this in vitro assay) that may be normally presentin vivo. To explore further the relationship between them, complexes I/II and complex III were analyzed by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE (two-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) after photo-cross-linking. Fig. 3 C shows that complexes I/II and the complex III contain DNA-protein complexes that have similar molecular masses. The data presented in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 suggest that the complex III is related to complexes I/II, at least in the composition of the monomeric units that make all or part of the complex III. The photo-cross-linking of the complex III was far more efficient than the photo-cross-linking of either the complex I or complex II (seeopen arrows in Fig. 3 C), confirming known instability of the constitutive monomeric HSF-HSE interactions (33.Takahashi R. Heydari A.R. Gutsman A. Sabia M. Richardson A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows super-shift of the complexes obtained with a commercially available anti-HSF1 antiserum further supporting the above data that the complex III does indeed contain HSF (s). Examination of the super-shifted complex obtained (Fig. 4) shows that the addition of the antiserum enhances the intensity of binding, corroborating previously published data on the enhanced activation of HSF binding to the DNA by anti-HSF antibodies (34.Zimarino V. Wilson S. Wu C. Science. 1990; 249: 546-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). By having established conditions for the generation of trimeric HSF·HSEαB complex in neonatal lens extracts, which do not possess this capability when freshly assayed, we decided to investigate four representative tissues as follows: the lens (expressing αB at very high levels), the heart (low levels of αB expression), the brain (very low levels of expression), and the liver (no αB expression at all) (13.Bhat S.P. Nagineni C.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 14.Kato K. Shinohara H. Kurobe N. Inaguma Y. Shimizu K. Ohshima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1074: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The extracts were prepared from 3- to 4-day-old neonatal rat tissues. Gel-shift assays were conducted with frozen-stored extracts at pH 7.9. The HSF·HSEαB complex III appears efficiently and exclusively in the lens extracts (Fig.5). These data suggest that long storage in liquid nitrogen facilitates the appearance of the HSF·HSEαB complex III only in lens extracts and not in the extracts made from the heart, brain, or the liver. In light of the data presented in Fig. 5, we asked the question if complex III can be found naturally without the intervention of “long storage”? WCEs were prepared from temporally defined different stages of the lens and the liver tissues. The gel mobility-shift assays were conducted within 3–4 days of the preparation of the extracts. The oligomeric HSF·HSEαB complex appears gradually with a maximum at day 11 to day 21 in the postnatal rat lens (Fig.6). The intensity of the complex III decreases with age. Interestingly, over the same period complex III does not appear in the liver extracts (Fig. 6). The data presented in this investigation reveal that activation of the HSF via oligomerization (trimerization) and its binding to DNA (HSE) is not only tissue-specific but appears in a developmentally regulated fashion, apparently without any tangible physical or chemical stress. The basal or constitutive state of the HSF-HSE interaction is transcriptionally inactive. The presence of such a constitutive state has been demonstrated and seems to be present differentially in a number of tissues including the rat liver (32.Fawcett T.W. Sylvester S.L. Sarge K.D. Morimoto R.I. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32272-32278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Takahashi R. Heydari A.R. Gutsman A. Sabia M. Richardson A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Based on the data presented in this investigation, complex I may represent this constitutive monomeric HSF-HSE interaction. Complex I is seen in all the extracts made from lens, liver, heart, and brain (Fig. 5). With lens extracts, HSEαB produces three complexes as follows: complex I (similar to that obtained in other tissues), and complexes II and III, which are lens-specific. The molecular masses of the complexes I and II range from 70 to >87 kDa (Fig. 3). This is very similar to the published data (Ref. 33.Takahashi R. Heydari A.R. Gutsman A. Sabia M. Richardson A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar and references cited in the Introduction). The data presented in Fig. 3, A—C, strongly suggest that complex III represents an oligomeric (trimeric) aggregate of one or both of the lower molecular mass monomeric complexes. The actual identity of the HSF in the rat lens is not known. The sequence of the rat HSF1 2S. K. Swamynathan, C. J. Revathi, and U. K. Srinivas, GenBankTM accession number X83094. is very similar (87% sequence similarity) to the sequence of the human HSF1. The data presented in Fig. 1 establish that the appearance of complexes I–III is dependent on the 5′- NGAAN-3′ unit in HSEαB. Considering the complexity of the expression of HSFs (2.Morimoto R.I. Kroeger P.E. Cotto J.J. Feige U. Morimoto R.I. Yahara I. Polla B.S. Stress-inducible Cellular Responses. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel1996: 139-163Crossref Google Scholar, 35.Fiorenza M.T. Farkas T.

Biol. 1997; 17: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), it is possible that the complexes II and even complex I (although with mobility similar to that obtained with other tissues) represent lens-specific isoforms of HSF. This is also suggested by competition experiments, which show that HSE derived from hsp82 gene is a less efficient competitor as opposed to a consensus HSE (Fig.1 B). HSEαB is very similar to consensus HSE than to HSE82 (see sequences in Fig. 1 A and legend to Fig. 1 B). The organization of the monomeric 5′-NGAAN-3′ units and possibly the surrounding sequences also contribute to the specificity and modulation of the HSF-HSE interactions. Special sequence preferences may also be inherent in the HSFs. HSF2 has been previously suggested to be involved in hemin-induced activation of HSP70 in K562 cells (2.Morimoto R.I. Kroeger P.E. Cotto J.J. Feige U. Morimoto R.I. Yahara I. Polla B.S. Stress-inducible Cellular Responses. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel1996: 139-163Crossref Google Scholar). However, recently it was reported that it is HSF1 that mediates this activation (37.Yoshima T. Yura Y. Yanagi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25466-25471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Also, it is known that heat shock has no effect on the DNA-binding ability and oligomeric state of HSF2 (31.Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). We compared the generation of complex III in extracts made from lenses preincubated at 37 and 4 °C before preparation of WCEs. The enhanced presence of complex III was detected in lenses preincubated at 37 °C indicating the stress (heat) sensitivity of its appearance. 3T. Somasundaram and S. P. Bhat, unpublished observations. The heat sensitivity of the appearance of the complex III is further established by the data presented in Fig. 2. The data presented in Fig. 4, in which a human HSF1 antibody was used for super-shift analyses, establish that these complexes contain heat shock factors. The presence of the monomeric HSF·HSEαB constitutive complexes (complex I in all tissues examined and complex II in the lens) does not correspond to the known expression patterns of αB. Both in the heart (which is known to express αB) and in the liver (which is known not to express αB), there is a robust presence of the constitutive (monomeric) HSF·HSEαB complexes. The neonatal brain extracts show a general lack of binding to HSEαB (Fig. 5) corresponding well with absence of significant αB expression (13.Bhat S.P. Nagineni C.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar,14.Kato K. Shinohara H. Kurobe N. Inaguma Y. Shimizu K. Ohshima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1074: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). 4M. Sapru-Koul, D. Bok, A. Srinivasan, J. Horwitz, and S. P. Bhat, unpublished observations. The appearance of the trimeric complex (complex III), on the other hand, corresponds very well with the known expression patterns of theαB-crystallin gene. The fact that the complex III (produced in vitro by long storage and heat) is the same complex that increases in a temporally defined fashion (Fig. 6) in the lens extracts without any in vitro manipulation clearly establishes that the formation of these complexes is related to the expression of the αB-crystallin gene. This conclusion is evident because this very heat shock element has been previously shown (a) to respond to heat stress by activation of transcription of the downstream gene in cells transfected with αB heat shock promoter-reporter constructs (26.Klemenz T. Frohli E. Steiger R.H. Schafer T. Aoyama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hurwitz L. Goldman J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1029-1039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A quantitative analysis shows that the adult lens contains about 10-fold more αB transcripts than either the fetal or early postnatal lens.4 These data suggest that although the expression of αB starts early in the fetal life (e.g. in the heart and the lens), the lens may depend on the activation of the heat shock promoter for high expression during late post-natal/adult stages. It is noteworthy that among different extracts made from 3–4-day-old rat tissues, only the lens extract can produce the trimeric complex when facilitated in vitro by long storage (Fig. 5). Interestingly, the extracts from day 11 to 21 lens do not need anyin vitro manipulation for the production of the complex III (Fig. 6). These data suggest that “competence” for the production of complex III exists in the day 3–4 lenses; however, it is not functional until activated in vitro (by long storage or heat) or in vivo by the developmental cues (or temporally defined stages). It will not be out of place to speculate that “long storage” of extracts or exposure to high temperatures may facilitate conformational changes within the HSF. It has been suggested that in HSF, transitions from intramolecular interactions to intermolecular interactions may lead to trimerization and DNA binding (38.Zuo J. Baler R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7557-7568Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The tissue specificity of such transitions may suggest that special HSF isoforms are involved as suggested above or that tissue-specific activator or facilitator molecules are present in the lens. The in vivomechanism that leads to trimerization of the HSF and its binding to DNA at day 11–21 remains to be investigated. It is tempting to speculate the presence of a developmentally controlled activator-switch that leads to HSF oligomerization and DNA binding. HSF3 has been shown to be activated by direct interaction with other transcription factors (39.Kane-Ishii C. Tanikawa J. Nakai A. Morimoto R.I. Ishi S. Science. 1997; 277: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The exclusive presence of the multimeric HSF·HSEαB complex only in the lens and its absence in the liver clearly establish involvement of the heat shock promoter in tissue- and developmental stage-specific control of the αB-crystallin gene expression. We believe that other genes containing heat shock elements in their promoters may utilize HSF-HSE interactions to modulate their expression under normal non-stress conditions (40.Jedlicka P. Martin M.A. Wu C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2452-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 41.Xiao X. Zuo X. Davis A.A. McMillan D.R. Curry B.B. Richardson J.A. Benjamin I.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5943-5952Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although it is has been suggested by in vitro studies that HSF may have an “intrinsic” ability to respond to temperature by oligomerization and DNA binding (42.Larson J.S. Schuetz T.J. Kingston R.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1902-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), these data point to a tissue-specific and developmental control of this ability.

Here, we identified a small molecule that induces the assembly of the interferon-β (IFN-β) enhanceosome by stimulating all the enhancer-binding activator proteins: ATF2/c-JUN, IRF3, and p50/p65 of NF-κB. This compound stimulates mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1), which is a member of a family of proteins involved in stress-mediated signaling pathways. Consistent with this, MEKK1 activates IRF3 in addition to ATF2/c-JUN and NF-κB for the assembly of the IFN-β enhanceosome. MEKK1 activates IRF3 through the c-JUN amino-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway but not the p38 and IκB kinase (IKK) pathway. Taken together with previous observations, these results implicate that, for the assembly of an IFN-β enhanceosome, MEKK1 can induce IRF3 and ATF2/c-JUN through the JNK pathway, whereas it can induce NF-κB through the IKK pathway. Thus, specific MEKK family proteins may be able to integrate some of multiple signal transduction pathways leading to the specific activation of the IFN-β enhanceosome.

This enhancer organization is the basis of a combinatorial mechanism that is required for the selective activation of genes in response to extracellular signals or developmental queues (reviewed in Refs. 1.Carey M.

Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). One model for studying the combinatorial gene regulation mechanism is provided by the enhancer of an IFN-β gene (reviewed in Ref. 4.Maniatis T. Falvo J.V. Kim T.H. Kim T.K. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Wathelet M.G. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The IFN-β enhancer includes an overlapping set of regulatory elements designated positive regulatory domains (PRDs)1 I through IV. PRDII, PRDI–III, and PRDIV are recognized, respectively, by the transcription factors p50/p65 (NF-κB), IRF3, and ATF2/c-JUN. Based on the analyses of these activator proteins, it was proposed that they may form a stereospecific enhancer complex termed an enhanceosome. Direct biochemical evidence has been obtained for this hypothesis (5.Kim T.K. Kim T.H. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12191-12196Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 6.Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 119-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 7.Yie J. Merika M. Munshi N. Chen G. Thanos D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3074-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). A functional interferon β (IFN-β) enhanceosome was assembled in vitro using the purified PRD-binding proteins. Synergistic activation of transcription by this enhanceosome requires the precise arrangement of activator binding sites in the enhancer DNA. Detailed mechanistic studies showed that transcriptional synergy is due to the cooperative assembly and increased stability of the enhanceosome. Furthermore, stereospecific assembly of the enhanceosome is critical for the efficient and specific recruitment of the transcriptional apparatus to the promoter and the formation of a stable preinitiation complex for synergistic activation. These results demonstrate the importance of enhanceosome structure in transcriptional synergy, and they reveal new insights into the detailed mechanisms involved in this process with complex and intact enhancers. The next important questions include the nature of the signal transduction pathways leading to the activation of the enhanceosome. Little is known about the upstream kinases that coordinate the activation of the multiple transcription factors in the enhanceosome. We have taken a chemical genetic approach that uses bioactive chemicals as molecular probes to study these signaling pathways (reviewed in Refs. 8.Mitchison T.J. Chem. Biol. 1994; 1: 3-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 9.Schreiber S.L. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1998; 6: 1127-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 10.Crew C.M. Splittgerber U. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 317-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It is increasingly clear that, like genetic mutations, chemical ligands can either inactivate (e.g. trapoxin binding to histon deacetylase) or activate the protein (e.g.steroids binding to nuclear receptors). The first step in the chemical genetic approach is to screen for small molecules that affect specific cellular pathways. These chemicals can be used to elucidate the pathways by identification of the target proteins for which activities are affected. In the present studies, we identified a small molecule that induces the IFN-β enhancer through the assembly of an enhanceosome. Based on the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1) by this compound, we showed that specific MEKK family proteins facilitate the assembly of the IFN-β enhanceosome: they can induce IRF3 and ATF2/c-JUN through the c-JUN amino-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, and NF-κB through the IκB kinase (IKK) pathway. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected with LipoFectamine reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) using the plasmids indicated (see Figs Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6).Figure 6MEKK-JNK pathway is involved in the activation of IRF3. A, HeLa cells were cotransfected with 2 μg of G5E1b-CAT reporter plasmid and 0.5 μg of an expression plasmid containing no insert (0.5 μg; lane 1) or GAL4-IRF3 (lanes 2–8) in the absence (lane 2) or presence (1 μg in lanes 3, 5, and 7; 2 μg in lanes 4, 6, and 8) of an expression plasmid for JNK, IKKβ, or p38 as indicated. CAT activities were determined in extracts of transfected cells after treatment with CG-18.B, HeLa cells were transfected with an expression plasmid for flag-tagged JNK, IKKβ, or p38. After 6 h of treatment with CG-18 (10 μg/ml), kinases were immunoprecipitated and their amounts were normalized by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). The kinase activity was then measured in vitro using purified recombinant his-tagged IRF3 or GST-IκBα protein as a substrate.C, CAT activities were measured in extracts of cells transfected with 2 μg of a (PRDI–III)3-CAT reporter plasmid and the following expression plasmids: 0.5 μg of mock (lane 1), 0.5 μg of IRF3 (lanes 2–7), and IRF3mt containing mutations in IRF3 phosphorylation sites (lanes 8 and 9) plus 0.5 μg of JNK (lanes 3,6, and 9), or p38 (lanes 4 and7) in the absence or presence of 0.5 μg of MEKK1 as indicated.

Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) and pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH), respectively. The G5E1b-CAT reporter plasmid containing five copies of GAL4 DNA binding sites with E1b TATA was described previously (12.Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids for MEKK1, MEKK3, MEKK4, MLK3, IKK, and p38 were described previously (13.Zhao Q. Lee F.S. J. Biol.

The (PRDII)2-CAT, (PRDI–III)3-CAT, and (PRDIV)6-CAT reporter plasmids contain the indicated multiple copies of each PRD, as described (14.Du W. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 74: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The (−110IFN-β)-GFP was constructed by replacing the CAT reporter gene in the (−110IFN-β)-CAT plasmid (14.Du W.

HeLa cells were stably transfected with (−110IFN-β)-GFP. This cell line was used for the screening of a chemical library (Chembridge Corporation). Cells plated in 96-well plates were treated with compounds at concentrations of 10–20 μg/ml. At 24–36 h post-treatment, induction of the GFP reporter gene was analyzed under a fluorescence microscope. In the transient transfection experiments with GFP-IRF3, at 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with compounds as indicated (see Figs. 4 and 6). After 6–8 h, cellular localization of GFP-IRF3 was analyzed under a fluorescence microscope. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with compounds as indicated in Figs Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7. Expression of the CAT reporter gene was analyzed 12–15 h after treatment, with normalization of protein concentrations in cell extracts. Transfection efficiencies were monitored by transfection of a CMV-lacZ control plasmid on parallel plates. CAT and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described (15.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). All the transfection experiments were repeated at least twice and deviations are indicated (see FigsFigure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7). Immunoprecipitations were performed as described (13.Zhao Q. Lee F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8355-8358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 16.Widmann C. Gerwins P.

Cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After centrifugation of cell lysates at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were incubated with specific antibodies. After 1 h of incubation at 4 °C, the immunoprecipitates were extensively washed three times with lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitated kinase was incubated with 0.3 μg of purified recombinant substrate protein, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mmNaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 20 min. Kinase reaction products were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Cells were transfected with an expression plasmid for hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged IRF3. After extensive washing in phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 30 min before addition of [32P]orthophosphate for 6 h. Extracts were prepared with lysis buffer and precleared on protein A/G-Sepharose. IRF3 was then immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for detection of phosphorylated IRF3 using the PhosphorImager. To gain insight into the signaling pathways that induce the enhanceosome, we screened small molecules for their abilities to activate the intact IFN-β enhancer. HeLa cells were stably transfected with green fluorescence protein (GFP) as a reporter gene linked to the intact IFN-β enhancer. This cell-based assay system was used to screen the chemical inducers of the IFN-β enhancer. Among the 400 synthetic chemicals (Chembridge), high levels of fluorescent signal were detected in several, including CG-18 (Fig.1 A). CG-18 (Fig.1 C) was chosen for further experiments because of its high level of induction. The IFN-β enhancer was induced with increasing amounts of CG-18 in a dose-dependent manner, when CAT was used as a reporter gene (Fig. 1 B). To understand how CG-18 activates the IFN-β enhancer, we analyzed the effects of CG-18 on the activation of each PRD. The IFN-β enhancer contains multiple PRDs that bind distinct transcription factors, including NF-κB (PRDII), IRF3 (PRDI–III), and ATF2/c-JUN (PRDIV) (4.Maniatis T. Falvo J.V. Kim T.H. Kim T.K. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Wathelet M.G. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected with reporters linked to multiple copies of PRDII, PRDI–III, or PRDIV and then treated with CG-18. Treatment with CG-18 stimulated the CAT reporter linked to the intact IFN-β enhancer (Fig. 2 A,lane 2). Under these conditions, CG-18 also activated reporters containing multiple copies of each individual PRD (PRDII,lane 4; PRDI–III, lane 6; PRDIV, lane 8). Thus, the IFN-β enhancer is activated in response to CG-18 through induction of all the PRDs. To further investigate the role of each PRD-binding transcription factor in the CG-18 induction of the IFN-β enhancer, HeLa cells were cotransfected with reporters linked to the IFN-β enhancer and plasmids expressing NF-κB, IRF3, and ATF2/c-JUN (Fig. 2 B). Transfection of each PRD-binding factor slightly increased reporter gene expression from the IFN-β enhancer (compare lane 1with lanes 3, 5, or 7). Under these conditions, treatment with CG-18 further potentiated these activator-dependent reporter gene activities (lanes 4, 6, and 8). These results suggest that NF-κB, IRF3, and ATF2/c-JUN can be involved in the CG-18 induction of the IFN-β enhancer. Activation of all the enhancer-binding proteins is not sufficient, and assembly of the enhanceosome is required for the specific activation of the IFN-β enhancer (4.Maniatis T. Falvo J.V. Kim T.H.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3074-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To test the involvement of the enhanceosome in CG-18 induction of the IFN-β enhancer, we tested IFN-β enhancers in which a half or full helical turn of DNA was inserted between PRDI and PRDII (Fig. 2 C). HeLa cells were transfected with reporters containing either the intact IFN-β enhancer or enhancers with insertion mutations. Induction of the intact IFN-β enhancer by CG-18 resulted in a marked increase in reporter gene activity (Fig. 2 C, lane 2). However, when a half helical turn (6 base pairs (bp)) was introduced between PRDI and PRDII, the level of induction was sharply reduced (I/II6; lane 4). Remarkably, insertion of a full helical turn (10 bp), which re-establishes the relative positions of the PRDs on the face of the DNA helix, almost fully restored the activation of the IFN-β enhancer (I/II10; lane 6). Thus, CG-18 induction requires the stereospecific alignment of each activated PRD-binding transcription factor in the IFN-β enhancer. Treatment with CG-18 induced the assembly of the IFN-β enhanceosome by stimulating all the enhancer-binding proteins: NF-κB, IRF3, and ATF2/c-JUN (Figs. 1 and 2). Interestingly, CG-18 also stimulated transcriptional activity of p53 (data not shown) and a number of stress inducers (e.g. genotoxic agents) were shown to activate NF-κB (17.Karin M. Delhase M.

In response to environmental stresses, members of the MEKK protein family play a role in the induction of specific gene regulation pathways. For example, MEKK1 was demonstrated to activate ATF2/c-JUN (22.Fanger G.R. Gerwins P. Widmann C. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Gen.

Thus, one possibility emerging from these observations is that CG-18 may activate all the IFN-β enhancer-binding proteins by stimulating the MEKK family member(s). To test this possibility, the kinase activity of MEKK1 was measured after treatment with CG-18. MEKK1 and MLK3 were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with antibodies raised against their specific sequences (16.Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N.L. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Treatment with CG-18 increased both MEKK1 phosphorylation of JNKK1 and autophosphorylation of MEKK1 (Fig.3 B; data not shown). Under these conditions, CG-18 failed to induce another MEKK family member, MLK3, indicating the specificity in the CG-18-dependent activation of MEKK1 (see also Fig. 5 C). We also determined whether the activation of MEKK1 is correlated to the activation of IRF3 using the reporter linked to multiple copies of PRDI–III. Concomitant with MEKK1 activation, we detected the activation of IRF3 (and IFN-β enhancer) with increasing amounts of CG-18 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 A; see also Fig.1 B). Thus, MEKK1 can be the specific part of CG-18 signaling pathways for the activation of IFN-β enhancer-binding proteins, including IRF3.Figure 5MEKK1/3 specifically induce the assembly of the IFN-β enhanceosome.

To this end, the transcriptional activity of the GAL4-IRF3 fusion protein was analyzed with a reporter plasmid containing GAL4 binding sites in the absence or presence of the ectopic expression of the active form of MEKK1 (32.Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 33.Xu S. Robbins D.J. Christerson L.B. English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5291-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In these experiments, GAL4-IRF3 protein levels were normalized to compare the transcriptional activities (data not shown). Expression of GAL4-IRF3 resulted in low levels of the reporter gene expression (Fig.4 A, lane 2). Under these conditions, transcriptional activity of GAL4-IRF3 was strongly stimulated by increasing amounts of MEKK1 in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 3-5). Consistently, treatment with CG-18 also markedly potentiated the transcriptional activity of GAL4-IRF3 (lane 6). Thus, the transcriptional activity of IRF3 can be stimulated by MEKK1 like that of ATF2/c-JUN and NF-κB. To further address the MEKK1-dependent IRF3 activation, we investigated the subcellular localization of IRF3 in the presence of MEKK1 (21.Kim T. Kim T.Y. Song Y.-H. Min I.M. Yim J. Kim T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30686-30689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). IRF3 was linked to GFP, transfected into cells, and then examined for MEKK1-induced changes in its subcellular localization (Fig. 4 B). In uninduced cells, GFP-IRF3 was localized almost exclusively to the cytoplasm. Under these conditions, nuclear localization was observed in cells transfected with MEKK1 expression plasmids. As expected, treatment with CG-18 also induced the nuclear localization of GFP-IRF3. These results, together with data from Fig.4 A, indicate that MEKK1 can induce the transcriptional activity of IRF3, along with its nuclear translocation. To confirm the role of MEKK1 in the IRF3 activation, we tested whether a catalytically inactive form of MEKK1 (K432M) could act as a dominant inhibitor of CG-18 induction of the IRF3. To this end, the transcriptional activity of the GAL4-IRF3 fusion protein was analyzed with a reporter plasmid containing GAL4 binding sites in the presence of the ectopic expression of the mutant form of MEKK1 (Fig.4 C). The mutant MEKK1 significantly blocked the CG-18 induction of GAL4-IRF3 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4 C, lanes 3-5). Consistent with this, ectopic expression of the MEKK1 mutant inhibited the CG-18-dependent nuclear translocation of IRF3 (CG-18 + MEKK1*; Fig. 4 B). We also examined whether a dominant negative mutant of MEKK1 inhibited the in vivo phosphorylation of IRF3 after treatment with CG-18. HeLa cells were cotransfected with a MEKK1 mutant along with HA-tagged IRF3. Transfected cells were labeled with radioactive orthophosphate upon CG-18 treatment, and IRF3 protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig.4 D, phosphorylation of IRF3 was induced by CG-18 (lane 2). This induced phosphorylation of IRF3 was significantly attenuated with ectopic expression of an MEKK1 mutant (CG-18 + MEKK1*;lane 3). Taken altogether with data from Fig. 4, these results indicate that MEKK1 can activate IRF3, whereas its dominant mutant blocks the activation of IRF3 in response to CG-18. MEKK1, like CG-18, can stimulate all the enhanceosome components (IRF3, ATF2/c-JUN, and NF-κB). Thus, we examined whether MEKK1 could induce all the PRDs for the assembly of an IFN-β enhanceosome (Fig.5 A). HeLa cells were cotransfected by the reporters linked to multiple copies of PRDII, PRDI–III, or PRDIV along with the expression plasmid for the active form of MEKK1. MEKK1 activated reporters containing multiple copies of each PRD (PRDII, lane 2; PRDI–III, lane 4; PRDIV, lane 6). Under these conditions, intact IFN-β enhancer was also stimulated by MEKK1 (lane 8). Thus, MEKK1 can induce the IFN-β enhancer by activating all the PRD-binding transcription factors. To assess the involvement of the enhanceosome in MEKK1 induction of the IFN-β enhancer, we tested IFN-β enhancers in which a half or full helical turn of DNA was inserted between PRDI and PRDII (Fig.5 B). HeLa cells were cotransfected by CAT reporters containing the intact or phasing mutant IFN-β enhancers along with an expression plasmid for MEKK1. Intact IFN-β enhancer was activated by MEKK1 (lane 2). In contrast, the level of MEKK1 induction decreased with insertion of a half helical turn between PRDI and PRDII (lane 4). Insertion of a full helical turn restored the activity of the IFN-β enhancer (lane 6). Thus, the stereospecific alignment of each activated PRD-binding factor is required for the MEKK1-induced transcriptional activity of the IFN-β enhancer. The MEKK family of enzymes shares a conserved carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain (32.Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 33.Xu S. Robbins D.J. Christerson L.B. English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5291-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, MEKK members other than MEKK1 may also activate the IFN-β enhancer. To address the specificity in the activation of an IFN-β enhancer, we examined several MEKK family members for their abilities to induce the IFN-β enhancer (Fig.5 C). HeLa cells were cotransfected with the CAT reporter linked to the intact IFN-β enhancer and expression plasmids for MEKK1, MEKK3, MEKK4, and MLK3. As expected, the IFN-β enhancer was stimulated by MEKK1 (lane 2). However, MEKK4 and MLK3 failed to stimulate reporter gene activity from the IFN-β enhancer (lanes 3 and 4). MEKK4 and MLK3 are functionally active, because their coexpression with JNK in parallel experiments resulted in the marked activation of JNK, which were determined in immunocomplex kinase assays using the substrate GST-c-JUN protein (data not shown). Under these conditions, the transcriptional activity of the IFN-β enhancer was strongly potentiated by MEKK3 (lane 5). This MEKK3 Induction was specifically observed with the IFN-β enhancers containing the correct"

A FLAG epitope was engineered on to the N terminus of the type III IP3R to distinguish the transfected from the endogenous isoform. This was not necessary for the type I IP3R, since the endogenous levels of this isoform were extremely low. Based on sucrose gradient analysis, the transfected type I or FLAG-type III IP3Rs assembled into tetramers. Confocal immunofluorescence experiments confirmed that the constructs were primarily targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum. Recombinant type I IP3R expressed in COS cells over a 48-h period showed a negligible capacity to form hetero-oligomers with endogenous type III IP3Rs, based upon co-immunoprecipitation assays. However, substantial formation of hetero-oligomers was observed between recombinant receptors when the cells were simultaneously transfected with type I and FLAG-type III IP3Rs. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments using lysates from metabolically labeled cells allowed the quantitation of homo- and hetero-oligomers in cells transfected with different ratios of type I and FLAG-type III IP3R DNA. These studies show that the relative expression level of the two isoforms influences the fraction of hetero-oligomers formed. However, the proportion of hetero-oligomers formed were less than predicted by a binomial model in which the association of subunits is assumed to be random. In doubly transfected cells, the early kinetics of 35S label incorporation into homotetramers showed a lag period corresponding to the time taken to synthesize a full-length receptor. However, hetero-oligomers were synthesized with a longer lag period, suggesting that there may be kinetic constraints that favor homo-oligomers over hetero-oligomers.

In addition, it has also been suggested that individual isoforms may be preferentially localized to specific regions of the cell (15.Nathanson M.N. Fallon M.B. Padfield P.J. Maranto A.R. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1996; 270: C1255-C1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Targeted gene knock-outs of IP3R isoforms in DT-40 cells have also shown that cells expressing the three different isoforms have distinct patterns of Ca2+ signaling (14.Miyakawa T. Maeda A. Yamazawa T. Hirose K. Kurasaki T. Iino M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). It is not known if the formation of IP3R hetero-oligomers results in channels with intermediate regulatory properties or if the regulatory properties of one isoform dominate within a heterotetramer. In the study on DT-40 cells, the expression of any two isoforms led to an intermediate IP3 sensitivity, but the modulatory effects of Ca2+ and ATP were dictated by one dominant isoform (14.Miyakawa T. Maeda A. Yamazawa T. Hirose K. Kurasaki T. Iino M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). These data indicate that hetero-oligomerization can have functional consequences. Therefore, it can be anticipated that a major factor that would impact on the regulatory properties of IP3Rs in a cell are the extent to which they participate in hetero-oligomerization as well as their subunit composition. The present study was undertaken in an attempt to address these questions and to learn more about the assembly of these ion channels. Hetero-oligomerization was studied in COS-7 cells transfected with DNA encoding both the type I and type III IP3R isoforms. Homo- and hetero-oligomers were detected by a co-immunoprecipitation assay. The experimental data indicate that the combination of isoforms may not be a simple random process and suggest that mechanisms exist in cells that favor the formation of IP3R homo-oligomers over hetero-oligomers.

The type III-specific Abs used were a monoclonal against amino acids 22–230 in the ligand binding domain (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). or a polyclonal Ab raised to amino acids 2657–2670 of the C terminus (19.Joseph S.K.

Antibody against the type II IP3R isoform was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The monoclonal Ab to the FLAG M2 epitope was obtained form Sigma. The type I IP3R cDNA was kindly given by Dr. Thomas Sudhof (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) and was in the expression plasmid pCMVI-9 (20.Mignery G.A. Newton C.L. Archer III, B.T. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12679-12685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The type III IP3R cDNA was kindly given by Dr. Graeme Bell (University of Chicago) and was in the expression plasmid pCB6 (21.Blondel O. Takeda J. Janssen H. Seino S. Bell G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11356-11363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The type III IP3R was epitope-tagged at the N terminus by using polymerase chain reaction to amplify the entire coding sequence with rat type III IP3R cDNA as template. The forward primer encoded an NheI restriction site and the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK). The reverse primer encoded an EcoRI site. The reaction was carried out using the Expand long template polymerase chain reaction system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The 8037-base pair polymerase chain reaction product was digested with NheI/EcoRI, purified, and ligated into NheI/EcoRI-digested expression plasmid pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). All plasmids used for transfection were purified by CsCl banding (22.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, New York1989Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were grown to approximately 70% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5% fetal bovine serum. Both LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and TransIt (PanVera) reagents were used as transfection agents in the present study. The procedures for transfection were as recommended by the manufacturers. The transfection reagent used and the concentration of DNA transfected are indicated in the figure legends. At 48 h post-transfection, the medium was removed, and the plates were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and solubilized in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1% Triton X-100 (w/v), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml each of aprotinin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and leupeptin (lysis buffer). Lysates were prepared as described above and precleared for 30 min by incubation with 20 μl of a 50%(v/v) slurry of Staphylococcus aureus cell wall (Pansorbin, Calbiochem). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 25,000 × g. Aliquots of lysate protein (100 μg) were incubated with IP3R Ab for 4–16 h at 4 °C together with 50 μl of Protein A-Sepharose (20%, v/v). Immune complexes were isolated by centrifugation, washed three times in lysis buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In some experiments, the polypeptides in the gel were transferred to nitrocellulose, which was autoradiographed and then immunoblotted with IP3R isoform-specific antibodies to locate the receptor. Repeated immunoblotting of the same nitrocellulose sheet was carried out after treating blots for 30 min at 60 °C in a stripping buffer containing 65 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, and 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. COS cells were grown and transfected on coverslips. At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were washed twice with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS and fixed in 100% ice cold methanol for 20 min at −20 °C. The cells were subsequently permeabilized by incubation in 0.1% saponin in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. The coverslips were blocked in a solution of 5% fetal bovine serum, 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C and then incubated for a further 1 h in primary antibody. These were employed at the following dilutions: 1:200 type I IP3R polyclonal (Affinity BioReagents); 1:100 type III IP3R monoclonal (Transduction Laboratories), and 1:1000 ribophorin polyclonal (kind gift of Dr. Christopher Nicchitta). The cells were washed three times in a solution of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15M NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 (TNT buffer) and then incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h at 37 °C. These were employed at the following dilutions: 1:500 of either donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase or goat anti-mouse HRP (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). The cells were washed three times with TNT buffer and incubated with fluorescein- or rhodamine-linked tyramide for 5 min at room temperature as described by the manufacturer (NEN Life Science Products). and washed subsequently three times with TNT. The cells were mounted with VectaShield antifade reagent (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and examined by confocal microscopy (Bio-Rad MRC 600). These studies indicated that the transfection efficiency was 40–60%. The predominant endogenous IP3R isoforms in COS cells have been reported to be type III and type II IP3Rs (23.Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). This was confirmed by immunoblotting of cell lysates from mock-transfected cells using type III IP3R Ab (Fig.1, type III blot, lane 1) and type II IP3R Ab (data not shown). The very low levels of endogenous type I IP3Rs could not be detected by immunoblotting but could be visualized after immunoprecipitation with type I IP3R Ab (e.g. see Fig. 4). However, type I IP3Rs were readily detected in cell lysates prepared from type I IP3R-transfected cells (Fig. 1, middle panel, lane 2). In the case of the type I IP3R isoform, the low background allowed the transfected and endogenous receptors to be easily distinguished. Transient transfection with type III IP3R DNA elevated the levels of type III IP3R approximately 10-fold above the endogenous levels. The addition of the FLAG epitope tag allowed the transfected type III IP3Rs to be clearly distinguished from the endogenous pool (Fig. 1, lower panel, lane 4).Figure 4Hetero-oligomerization of type I and type III IP3R isoforms. A, COS cells were transfected in 60-mm plates with 8 μg of pcDNA3.1 (mock transfection) or type I IP3R cDNA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lysates were prepared from the cells 48 h post-transfection, and equal aliquots were immunoprecipitated with either type I or type III IP3R-specific Abs. The immunoprecipitates were run on 5% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted sequentially with type I or type III IP3R Ab. B, COS cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 (mock transfection) and type I IP3R cDNA, FLAG-type III IP3R cDNA, or both type I and FLAG-type III IP3R cDNA. Each IP3R cDNA was used at 8 μg, and the total DNA concentration was maintained at 16 μg for all conditions using pcDNA 3.1. Both sets of immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with either type I IP3R or FLAG Abs.

The major peak of immunoreactivity in type I and FLAG-III IP3R transfected cell lysates coincided with the migration of tetrameric cerebellar IP3Rs. There was no evidence for substantial amounts of disassembled IP3Rs in cell lysates analyzed on Triton X-100-containing gradients, although the tetramers could be disassembled in Zwittergent-containing gradients (24.Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). To further examine the localization of the transfected receptors, we carried out confocal immunofluorescence studies. An example of COS cells transfected with both type I and FLAG-type III IP3Rs and examined by double labeling with fluorescein and rhodamine-conjugated secondary Abs is shown in Fig.3.Figure 3Immunoflourescence localization of type I and FLAG-type III IP3R isoforms. COS cells were grown on coverslips and transfected with 3 μg of type I and 3 μg of FLAG-type III IP3R cDNA using the LipofectAMINE reagent. The coverslips were processed for double label immunofluorescence with type I polyclonal Ab (green) and FLAG monoclonal Ab (red) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The receptors were visualized using a Bio-Rad confocal microscope with optical sections taken at 0.25-μm intervals. Independent measurements of single labeled cells indicate that spill-over between red and green channels is <10%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Overlay of the fluorescein and rhodamine images at low levels of magnification indicated that >95% of the transfected cells express both DNAs (data not shown). Both type I and FLAG-type III IP3Rs showed an identical reticular localization similar to the pattern observed with the endoplasmic reticulum resident protein ribophorin (data not shown). There was no evidence for a selective localization of the FLAG-type III IP3R adjacent to the plasma membrane (but see Refs. 16.Khan A.A. Soloski M.J. Sharp A.H. Schilling G. Sabatini D.M. Li S.

Overall, the data indicate that the recombinant receptors expressed in COS cells assemble into tetramers and are localized to the endoplasmic reticulum.

Type I IP3Rs immunoprecipitated from the lysates of mock-transfected cells showed a weak signal corresponding to endogenous type I IP3Rs (Fig. 4 A, upper panel, lane 1), as well as a small amount of endogenous type III IP3R present as hetero-oligomers (Fig.4 A, lower panel, lane 1). A reproducible finding was that this pool of type III containing hetero-oligomers was decreased in COS cells transfected with type I IP3R (Fig. 4 A, lower panel, lane 3). The reason for this is not clear but may reflect suppression of endogenous type I IP3R expression in cells transfected with type I IP3R DNA. However, the main finding in these experiments was that immunoprecipitation of endogenous type III IP3Rs did not co-precipitate any detectable type I IP3R in COS cells transfected with this isoform (Fig. 4 A, upper panel, lane 4). Since formation of hetero-oligomers is a co-translational event (4.Monkawa T. Miyawaki A. Sigiyama T. Yoneshima H. Yamamoto-Hino M. Furuichi T. Saruta T. Hasegawa M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1579-1588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), it is possible that the lack of combination between transfected and endogenous receptors arises from a large difference in the rate of biosynthesis of the two receptor populations. If this is the case, it should be possible to detect the formation of hetero-oligomers when COS cells are simultaneously transfected with two different isoforms. An example of such an experiment is shown in Fig. 4 B in which type I and FLAG-tagged type III IP3R DNA were transfected separately or together into COS cells. Lysates immunoprecipitated with type I IP3R Ab and immunoblotted with FLAG Ab showed the presence of hetero-oligomers only in COS cells transfected with both IP3R isoforms (Fig. 4 B, lane 4,arrow). Similarly, immunoprecipitation of the lysates from doubly transfected cells with FLAG Ab followed by immunoblotting with type I IP3R Ab revealed the presence of type I subunits present as hetero-oligomers (Fig. 4 B, lane 8,arrow). An approximate estimate of the proportion of each isoform present as hetero-oligomers can be obtained by comparison of the immunoreactive protein in lanes 4 and 8 of Fig.4 B. The type I IP3R present as hetero-oligomers in FLAG immunoprecipitates (upper panel,lane 8, arrow) is approximately 20% of the amount detected in type I IP3R Ab immunoprecipitates (upper panel, lane 4). The latter quantity presumably reflects the total type I IP3R subunits present as both homo- and heterotetramers. However, the same comparison carried out for the FLAG-III indicates that almost all the FLAG-III IP3Rs are present as hetero-oligomers (Fig.4 B, lower panel, comparelanes 4 and 8). Such a skewed distribution of hetero-oligomers may arise artifactually if the conditions used for immunoprecipitation were not quantitative. This question has been addressed in the experiments shown in Fig.5. Lysates from 35S-labeled COS cells transfected with both type I and FLAG-III IP3R isoforms were subjected to three repeated rounds of immunoprecipitation with type I IP3R Ab to completely deplete the lysate of type I containing homo- and heterotetramers. It would be predicted that immunoprecipitation of the remaining supernatant with FLAG Ab should bring down only type III IP3R subunits present as homotetramers. The first round of immunoprecipitation with type I Ab was sufficient to bring down the majority of type I homo- and heterotetramers (Fig. 5 A, lane 1). As predicted, the final immunoprecipitation with FLAG Ab brought down primarily a single labeled band corresponding to FLAG-type III homotetramers (Fig.5, lane 4). When the initial rounds of immunodepletion were carried out with FLAG Ab, the amount of type III IP3R immunoprecipitated by the first round was lower (Fig. 5 B,lane 5). The final round of immunoprecipitation with type I IP3R Ab indicates that a substantial proportion of the type III subunits remain in the supernatant as hetero-oligomers (Fig.5 B, lane 8). The same result was obtained when the first three rounds of immunoprecipitation were carried out using a type III monoclonal Ab directed at the N terminus or a type III-specific C-terminal polyclonal Ab (data not shown). This suggests that type III IP3R subunits present as hetero-oligomers may not be efficiently immunoprecipitated by several type III Abs, and this may account for the apparent skewed distribution of hetero-oligomers seen in Fig. 4. However, the immunoprecipitation with type I IP3R Ab is quantitative and efficiently immunoprecipitates both homo- and hetero-oligomeric subunits. There are five possible ways in which two different monomers can be assembled into tetramers. If we refer to the type I monomer as a and type III monomer as b, these tetrameric forms correspond to aaaa, aaab,aabb, abbb, and bbbb. If the combination of subunits is random, then the relative proportions of each of these forms is predicted by the binomial distribution and can be expressed by terms in the expansion of (a +b)4 where a + b = 1. Since the absolute amount of each subunit is not known, we can define a ratio r = a/b. Then the distribution ratio of each of the five forms is given byr 4:4r 3:6r 2:4r:1. The fraction of type I polypeptide present as heterotetramers (F a) is given by (12r 3 + 12r 2 + 4r)/(4r 4 + 12r 3 + 12r 2 + 4r). The fraction of type III polypeptide present as heterotetramers (F b) is given by (4r 3 + 12r 2 + 12r)/(4r 3 + 12r 2 + 12r + 4). Fig. 6 shows experiments in which COS cells were doubly transfected with different amounts of DNA corresponding to one IP3R isoform while keeping the DNA for the other isoform fixed. Labeled lysates were immunoprecipitated with either type I IP3R Ab, FLAG Ab, or both. Fig. 6 Ashows representative autoradiograms corresponding to these immunoprecipitates. Quantitation of the lower band in the type I immunoprecipitates and the upper band in the FLAG immunoprecipitates yields values for type III- and type I-containing hetero-oligomers, respectively. In COS cells expressing FLAG-type III IP3R alone, the overnight immunoprecipitation with FLAG monoclonal Ab was sufficient to bring down >85% of the homotetrameric receptors (data not shown). Hence, the upper and lower bands after immunoprecipitation with both Abs together can be used to estimate the total type I and FLAG-type III IP3R subunits. From these values, it was possible to calculate experimental values for F a andF b, and these are plotted as a function of the ratio (r) of type I/type III IP3Rs (Fig. 6,B and C). The equations given above were used to calculate the predicted variation in F a andF b over this range of r values. As the ratio of type I/type III IP3R increases, it would be expected that the fraction of type I subunits present as hetero-oligomers (F a) would decrease and the fraction of type III subunits present as hetero-oligomers (F b) would increase. This trend is evident from the experimental data. However, it is also clear that the data do not follow the distribution predicted from binomial statistics. This is not surprising for F a (Fig. 6 B), since these data rely on immunoprecipitation with FLAG Ab, which underestimates the hetero-oligomeric pool (Fig. 5 B). The same considerations do not apply to F b (Fig. 6 C), which also does not fit the predicted relationship. We therefore conclude that the association between subunits under our experimental conditions is not a random process. One possible reason for this result is that the assumption that all possible combinations of hetero-oligomers can be formed may not be valid. Attempts were made to determine if the data would fit better to a model in which one or more of the three possible hetero-oligomeric forms were excluded from the analysis. This was done by fitting the data using the predicted relationship forF a and F b but considering the coefficients of the r 3,r 2, and r terms as unknowns. As shown in Fig. 6 B, the best fit from a nonlinear regression analysis of the data for F a was obtained if only the co-efficient of the r 3 term was given a value and the other two hetero-oligome"

Conservation of several cysteine and histidine residues among E4 34k sequences from a variety of adenovirus serotypes suggests the presence of a zinc binding domain important for function. Consistent with the hypothesis that E4 34k is a zinc metalloprotein, zinc binding by baculovirus-expressed E4 34k protein was demonstrated in a zinc blotting assay. To investigate the relationship between the potential zinc-binding region and E4 34k function, a series of mutant genes containing single amino acid substitutions at each of the conserved cysteine and histidine residues in E4 34k were constructed. The mutant proteins were examined for the ability to complement the late protein synthetic defect of an E4 deletion mutant, to physically interact with the viral E1b 55-kDa protein (E1b 55k) and cellular p53 protein, to relocalize E1b 55k, and to destabilize the p53 protein. These analyses identified a subset of cysteine and histidine residues required for stimulation of late gene expression, physical interaction with E1b 55k, and p53 destabilization. These data suggest that a zinc-binding domain participates in the formation of the E4 34k-E1b 55k physical complex and that the complex is required in late gene expression and for p53 destabilization."

In the case of the mammary gland, HGF/SF is produced by stromal fibroblasts, and it has been shown to have a potent morphogenic activity on cultured mammary epithelial cells and epithelial rudiments (3.Niranjan B.

HGF/SF has two distinct types of receptors, a transmembrane tyrosine kinase, which corresponds to the product of the c-met protooncogene and proteoglycans bearing the glycosaminoglycans heparan sulfate (HS) or dermatan sulfate (5.Deakin J.A.

After HGF/SF binding, which is thought to induce c-met dimerization, the c-met receptor undergoes autophosphorylation on a number of tyrosine residues. The latter provide docking sites for proteins with phosphotyrosine recognition domains, which recruit and activate a number of signaling pathways (11.Graziani A. Gramaglia D. Cantley L.C.

The MAPK family includes extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2, also called p44 and p42, respectively. Phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK on both threonine and tyrosine in the TEY motif by a cytoplasmic dual specificity MAPK kinase, MEK-1, activates these kinases (16.Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin.

The activated p42/44MAPK then phosphorylate a number of cellular substrates, which include Ser/Thr effector kinases. If it is to stimulate cell division or cell migration, HGF/SF must interact with a dual receptor system consisting of the c-met receptor and the HS (or dermatan sulfate) proteoglycan receptor (5.Deakin J.A.

However, the mechanism by which the HS receptors or the more recently described dermatan sulfate receptors contribute to the delivery of growth-stimulatory signals by HGF/SF is unclear. The resting mammary ductal epithelium is composed of two main cell types: epithelial cells, which line the lumen of the ducts, and myoepithelial cells, which lie between the epithelial cells and the basement membrane (21.Rudland P.S. Baraclough R. Fernig D.G. Smith J.A. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. Leinster S. Lunt G.G. Mammary Development and Cancer. 63. Portland Press, Colchester, UK1998: 1-20Google Scholar). Because HGF/SF is a product of the mammary stroma that acts on the epithelium (10.Richardson L. Schwall R.H. Zioncheck T.F. Trends Glycosci.

Cell Res. 1998; 241: 476-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), it will first come into contact with the myoepithelial cells. We have therefore examined how HGF/SF regulates in vitro the proliferation of human mammary myoepithelial-like cells (Huma 109). When cells were cultured on plastic, HGF/SF did not stimulate DNA synthesis and only elicited a transient phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK. DNA synthesis was stimulated by HGF/SF when Huma 109 cells were cultured on collagen I or on fibronectin, and it was always associated with a sustained phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK. We have also demonstrated that the HS receptor is required for HGF/SF-induced proliferation. Indeed HGF/SF only stimulated DNA synthesis and sustained phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK in chlorate-treated cells, when they were cultured on a substratum of medium-derived HS proteoglycans. FGF-2 and HGF/SF were obtained from R & D Systems (Abingdon, UK) and mouse epidermal growth factor (EGF) was obtained from Pepsyn (Liverpool, UK).

Endo-β-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.103) and heparinase III were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and from Grampian Enzymes (Orkney, UK), respectively. Collagen I from rat tail was from Beckton Dickinson (London, UK). Huma 109 myoepithelial-like cells were cultured as described previously (24.Rudland P.S. Histol. Histopathol. 1993; 8: 385-404PubMed Google Scholar). For DNA synthesis assays, cells were seeded into 24-well plates and were allowed to attach for 24 h. They were then washed twice in PBS and grown in serum-free medium containing 0.2% (w/v) of bovine serum albumin for 24 h before adding growth factors. [methyl-3H]Thymidine (40 μCi/ml at 0.8 μm) (ICN, Basingstoke, UK) was added directly to the culture medium 18 h later for 4 h. At 18 h, well synchronized cells were all in S phase and then were capable of incorporation of [3H]thymidine. DNA was precipitated with 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, and the radioactivity incorporated into DNA was determined by liquid scintillation counting. In parallel experiments, cells plated at equal density into 24-well plates were harvested after 48 h in presence of growth factors by trypsinization and counted using a hemocytometer. Statistics were performed using Student's t test. In some experiments, wells were first coated at room temperature with collagen I (50 μg/ml), fibronectin (10 μg/ml), or HSPGs (3 μg/ml). After 4 h, the wells were rinsed twice with PBS before seeding the cells. Sulfated glycosaminoglycan-deficient Huma 109 cells were prepared as described previously (5.Deakin J.A. Lyon M. J.

Cells were incubated for 4 h in sulfate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum (v/v) and 15 mmNaClO3. Following trypsinization, the cells were seeded in 24-well plates or 10-cm dishes as described for DNA synthesis or Western blot analysis, respectively, except that sulfate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15 mm NaClO3 was used throughout. As others have described, cells can be kept viable in sulfate-free medium containing chlorate for up to 1 month (25.Delehedde M. Deudon E. Boilly B. Hondermarck H. Exp.

Checks were always made on cell death and protein synthesis. DNA synthesis and cell proliferation could be induced normally in such chlorate-treated cells when they are treated with non-heparin-binding growth factors such as EGF and more commonly by adding fetal calf serum to the cells. In some experiments, cells were seeded onto culture substrata coated with HSPGs purified from the Huma 109 cells (3 μg/ml) or from the Huma 109 cell culture medium (3 μg/ml). Cells were seeded at equal densities in 10-cm-diameter cultured dishes and treated identically as for the DNA synthesis assays up to the addition of 30 ng/ml HGF/SF in fresh serum-free medium. In parallel experiments, PD98059, an inhibitor of MEK1 (10 mm stock solution in Me2SO) was added directly to the medium at a final concentration of 50 μmand 15 min before the addition of HGF/SF. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 300 μl of lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 0.2% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and bromphenol blue). Equal amounts of protein in the cell lysates were subjected to electrophoresis in 15% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels in the presence of SDS. Cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting as described previously (26.Rudland P.S. Platt-Higgins A.M. Wilkinson M.C. Fernig D.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1993; 41: 887-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Finally, immunoreactive proteins were revealed with the SuperSignal chemiluminescent detection system (Pierce and Warriner, Chester, UK) on Hyperfilm (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HS proteoglycans were purified as described (9.Rahmoune H. Chen H.L. Gallagher J.T. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7303-7310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The medium from 90% confluent cultures of Huma 109 myoepithelial-like cells grown in 15-cm-diameter dishes was collected, and the cell monolayers were rinsed twice with 10 ml of PBS, pH 6.8. The medium was clarified by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 15 min. Cells were lysed in 10 ml of lysis buffer (PBS, pH 6.8, containing 6 m urea and 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100). The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min, and the two supernatants were combined. Before applying the samples onto a 20-ml DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with PBS, pH 6.8 (medium samples), or lysis buffer (cell lysates), the medium was diluted with one volume of PBS, pH 6.8, and the cell lysate was diluted with 5 volumes of lysis buffer. The column was then extensively washed with 300 mm NaCl in the same buffer. Strongly anionic molecules, including proteoglycans, were eluted with 2 m NaCl in the same buffer. A second DEAE Fast Flow column (2 ml) was used to concentrate the eluate. The 2 m NaCl fractions were desalted on a 75-ml G-25 Sephadex (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated in 100 mm NH4HCO3. After freeze-drying, the proteoglycans were treated sequentially with sialidases, chondroitinase ABC, α-fucosidase, endo-β-galactosidase, and nucleases to remove anionic contaminants (9.Rahmoune H.

The proteoglycans were concentrated on a 1-ml DEAE Fast Flow column and the 2M NaCl fraction was desalted using a 10 ml G-25 Sephadex column, as described above. After freeze-drying, the powders were weighed, and stock solutions were made at 1 mg/ml of either medium HSPGs or cell HSPGs in PBS. Purified HSPGs were always boiled 5 min before adding to the culture medium (9.Rahmoune H. Chen H.L. Gallagher J.T. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. J. Biol.

DNA synthesis in Huma 109 myoepithelial-like cells was stimulated by addition of fetal calf serum and EGF (Fig.1 A), as described for other myoepithelial-like cells (27.Smith J.A. Winslow D.P. Rudland P.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 119: 120-126Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In contrast, the HS-binding growth factors FGF-2 and HGF/SF had no stimulatory effect on DNA synthesis in these cells plated on plastic (Fig. 1 A). When cells were plated on fibronectin or collagen I, HGF/SF stimulated DNA synthesis by 1.5- and 3-fold, respectively (Student's t test,p < 0.05), whereas FGF-2 remained without effect (Fig.1 B). The [3H]thymidine incorporation was always higher in cells plated on substratum compared with cells plated directly on plastic (Fig. 1). In parallel experiments, changes in total cell numbers were assessed 48 h after addition of growth factors (Fig. 2 A). HGF/SF induced a similar 3-fold increase in the number of cells grown on collagen I compared with cells grown on plastic (Student's t test,p < 0.05). No change in cell morphology was observed when cells were grown on collagen I or fibronectin (data not shown). The c-met polypeptide, the receptor for HGF/SF, was clearly detected in Huma 109 cells by Western blotting using an antibody against the N terminus of the human polypeptide (Fig. 2 B). As controls, the antibody also strongly detected c-met in HT29 cells, which are known to express this receptor (28.Sunitha I. Meighen D.L. Hartman D.P. Thompson E.W. Byers S.W. Avigan M.I. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1994; 12: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), but not in T47D cells, which barely express c-met (29.Beviglia L. Matsumoto K. Lin C.S. Ziober B.L. Kramer R.H. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 74: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The higher very faint band seen in T47D cells did not correspond to the size of c-met and hence was presumably due to cross-reacting molecules present at low levels. No change was observed in the amount of c-met polypeptide by Western blotting and in the localization of c-met by laser scanning confocal microscopy, when Huma 109 cells were grown on plastic, fibronectin, or collagen I (data not shown).Figure 2FGF-2 and HGF/SF effects on cell number and c-met expression in Huma 109 myoepithelial-like cells.

Cells were then harvested by trysinization and counted using a hemocytometer.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3252) Google Scholar) and also an antibody that recognized the doubly phosphorylated pTEpY motif and hence the enzymatically active forms of p42/44MAPK (17.Payne D.M. Rossomando A.J. Martino P. Erickson A.K. Her J.H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar), were used to analyze the activation of the MAPK pathway in Huma 109 cells. PD98059 clearly abolished the stimulation of DNA synthesis induced by HGF/SF in cells plated on collagen I or fibronectin substrata (Fig.3 A). Thus the MAPK pathway is required for the growth-stimulatory effects of HGF/SF in myoepithelial-like cells. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the addition of HGF/SF caused an increase in the phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK (detected as a doublet of 42 and 44 kDa), even though it did not stimulate DNA synthesis when cells were grown on plastic. In fact, the levels of dually phosphorylated p42/44MAPK were substantially up-regulated by HGF/SF, when cells were grown on all three substrata, but with the collagen I and fibronectin substrata giving a slightly increased response over the plastic substratum (Fig. 3 C). We observed that cells were not well synchronized when they were grown on collagen I, and a low basal level of dual phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK was observed in untreated cells (Fig. 3, B and C). However, we demonstrated that PD98059 indeed inhibited the specific phosphorylation and hence activation of p42/44MAPK after addition of HGF/SF to cells plated on collagen (Fig.3 C). We then investigated the kinetics of p42/44MAPK dual phosphorylation following the addition of HGF/SF to Huma 109 cells plated on plastic, fibronectin, or collagen I substrata (Fig. 4). When cells were grown on plastic, HGF/SF induced a rapid and transient phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK, which reached a maximum at 10 min and then decreased to near basal levels by 20 min. In contrast, the kinetics of phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK were different when the cells were grown on dishes coated with fibronectin or collagen I. When the cells were grown on fibronectin-coated dishes, HGF/SF induced a maximum phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK at 15 min, which then decreased slightly to 95% of the maximum by 30 min and then further decreased to 80% of the maximum at 45 min (Fig. 4). Moreover, this level of phosphorylation stayed at 50% of its maximum level for at least up to 2 h (data not shown). In the case of the collagen I substratum, the initial increase in phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK was faster and was detected as early as 1 min (Fig. 4). The maximum phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK was observed at 10 min and then was maintained at 90% of this maximum level (Fig. 4). On both collagen I and fibronectin substrata, a sustained phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK was observed after addition of HGF/SF. This result suggested that for HGF/SF to stimulate DNA synthesis in myoepithelial-like cells a sustained dual phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK was required and that this could be achieved on collagen I or fibronectin substrata but not on plastic where only a transient dual phosphorylation was elicited, which did not result in DNA synthesis. To determine whether proteoglycans played a role in the promotion of the growth-stimulatory activity of HGF/SF by collagen I substrata, sulfated glycosaminoglycan-deficient Huma 109 cells were generated by growing cells in medium containing sodium chlorate. Chlorate is a potent inhibitor of sulfation (31.Baeuerle P.A. Huttner W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 32.Keller K.M. Brauer P.R.

Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). Following this treatment, cells were quiescent, and the level of [3H]thymidine incorporation into cellular DNA was always very low, probably because of the greater cell synchrony obtained with this treatment (Fig.5 A). As reported in other systems (25.Delehedde M. Deudon E. Boilly B. Hondermarck H. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 31.Baeuerle P.A. Huttner W.B. Biochem.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8100-8107Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), no change in cell morphology or cell death (assessed by exclusion of Trypan Blue and cell numbers using a hemocytometer) was detected (data not shown). In controls, HGF/SF still failed to stimulate DNA synthesis in chlorate-treated Huma 109 cells plated on plastic (Fig. 5 A). However, when chlorate-treated cells were plated on collagen I-coated dishes, HGF/SF now failed to stimulate DNA synthesis (compare Figs. 5 A and1 A). These data indicated that sulfation of HS (and/or dermatan sulfate) was necessary for the growth-stimulatory effect of HGF/SF. HSPGs purified from the Huma 109 cells (cell-derived HSPGs) or their culture medium (medium-derived HSPGs) were then added to cultures of chlorate-treated Huma 109 cells in attempt to restore the growth-stimulatory activity of HGF/SF. Addition of cell- or medium-derived HSPGs in solution (3 μg/ml) failed to restore the stimulation of DNA synthesis by HGF/SF on cells grown on collagen I (Fig. 5 A). When chlorate-treated cells were plated onto wells coated with cell-derived HSPGs, no effect of addition of HGF/SF was observed on DNA synthesis. The presence of soluble medium-derived HSPGs was similarly ineffective in restoring DNA synthesis in chlorate-treated cells, when they were plated onto wells coated with cell-derived HSPGs (Fig. 5 A). In marked contrast, when chlorate-treated cells were plated onto wells coated with medium-derived HSPGs, HGF/SF now stimulated DNA synthesis (Fig.5 A). A 2-fold increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation was obtained 22 h after addition of HGF/SF compared with that for the unstimulated cells grown on wells coated with medium-derived HSPGs (Student's t test, p< 0.05). The addition of the same amount of soluble medium-derived HSPGs still had no effect on DNA synthesis. HSPGs purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” were free of any contaminating growth factors because no growth activity was detected following their addition in cell growth assays on these cells and on fibroblastic cells, which are extremely responsive to the growth promoting effects of the heparin-binding FGF-2 and other growth factors (9.Rahmoune H. Chen H.L. Gallagher J.T. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7303-7310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 21.Rudland P.S. Baraclough R. Fernig D.G. Smith J.A. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. Leinster S. Lunt G.G. Mammary Development and Cancer. 63. Portland Press, Colchester, UK1998: 1-20Google Scholar). An increase of [3H]thymidine incorporation was also observed when soluble medium-derived HSPGs were added simultaneously to HGF/SF on cells plated onto wells coated with medium-derived HSPGs. For the same number of attached cells, the basal level of [3H]thymidine incorporation was always higher in unstimulated cells plated onto wells coated with medium-derived HSPGs compared with unstimulated cells grown on plastic (Fig. 5, Aand B). A decrease in the concentration of coated-HSPGs reduced or totally abolished the stimulation of DNA synthesis by HGF/SF on chlorate-treated cells (data not shown). Treatment of the wells coated with medium-derived HSPGs with heparinase III prior to seeding of the chlorate-treated cells prevented HGF/SF from stimulating DNA synthesis (Fig. 5 B). Soluble medium-derived HSPGs were unable to restore DNA synthesis in the presence of HGF/SF in cells grown on the wells coated with the core protein of the medium-derived HSPGs. Thus, the HS chains, rather than the core protein of the medium-derived HSPGs, were ultimately responsible for restoring the stimulation of DNA synthesis by HGF/SF. Moreover, in chlorate-treated Huma 109 cells plated on plastic, a stimulation of phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK was barely detectable (Fig. 5 C). The same result was obtained when cells were grown on collagen I or if medium-derived HSPGs were added in solution (data not shown). In contrast, HGF/SF clearly induced a sustained phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK in HS-deficient Huma 109 myoepithelial-like cells plated on a substratum of medium HSPGs (Fig. 5 C). Taken together, these results showed that the stimulation of DNA synthesis and sustained phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK in Huma 109 myoepithelial-like cells were dependent on the anchorage of medium-derived heparan sulfate proteoglycans. HGF/SF is a stroma-derived growth factor, which is well described to act on neighboring epithelia in the mammary gland (22.Brinkmann V. Foroutan H. Sachs M. Weidner K.M. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1573-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 23.Yant J. Buluwela L. Niranjan B. Gusterson B. Kamalati T. Exp.

Neoplasia. 1999; 4: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). HSPGs that bind HGF/SF have been purified from both the cell-associated and culture medium fractions of Huma 109 myoepithelial-like cells (7.Rahmoune H. Rudland P.S. Gallagher J.T. Fernig D.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6003-6008Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The Huma 109 myoepithelial-like cells also possess the c-mettyrosine kinase receptor for HGF/SF (Fig. 1). These results suggest that mammary myoepithelial cells may be a target for HGF/SF, because HGF/SF is known to require a dual receptor system consisting of both its HS and c-met receptors (10.Richardson L. Schwall R.H. Zioncheck T.F. Trends Glycosci. Glycotech. 1996; 8: 167-182Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of action of the HGF/SF dual receptor system and the nature of the signaling pathways activated by c-met are not well understood. Intriguingly, HGF/SF did not stimulate DNA synthesis in Huma 109 myoepithelial-like cells cultured on plastic. In contrast, when the cells were plated on collagen I or fibronectin substrata, HGF/SF was able to stimulate DNA synthesis. This result was not due to the extracellular matrix substrata altering the level of expression of c-met or its cellular location. We first showed that there were striking differences in the kinetics of the p42/44MAPKphosphorylation by HGF/SF in cells plated on plastic, collagen I, or fibronectin. In cells plated on plastic, HGF/SF stimulated a transient dual phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK but failed to stimulate DNA synthesis. In cells plated on collagen I or fibronectin substrata, HGF/SF stimulated both a sustained dual phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK and DNA synthesis. The stimulation of DNA synthesis induced by HGF/SF was clearly dependent upon the activation of the MAPK pathway because it was inhibited by PD98059 (Fig. 4) and because DNA synthesis was always associated with a sustained phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK (Figs. 3 and 5 C). A number of studies have also suggested a link between sustained MAPK phosphorylation and mitogenesis with various mitogens (37.Pages G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.C. Meloche S.

We furthermore showed that sustained phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK and consequently DNA synthesis was dependent upon the anchorage of medium-derived HSPGs in chlorate-treated Huma 109 cells (Fig. 5). Chlorate was added to the culture medium of the cells as we and others have described previously (5.Deakin J.A. Lyon M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1999-2009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Rahmoune H.

Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). Chlorate has been shown to abolish sulfation on proteins and on carbohydrate residues in intact cells without inhibiting cell growth or protein synthesis (31.Baeuerle P.A. Huttner W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 32.Keller K.M. Brauer P.R. Keller J.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8100-8107Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The positive growth-stimulatory response of chlorate-treated cells with EGF or with serum (data not shown) confirms that chlorate treatment in itself is not inhibitory to DNA synthesis. It has been well described that exposure of cells to chlorate markedly reduces the binding of FGF-2 to its receptors, without affecting appreciably other cellular functions including their ability to be stimulated to synthesize DNA with non-heparin-binding growth factors such as EGF (9.Rahmoune H.

However, we showed that addition of the same amounts of soluble cell- or medium-derived HSPGs to the culture medium did not restore the growth-stimulatory activity of HGF/SF on chlorate-treated H109 cells. HGF/SF thus differs markedly from the FGF family of HS-binding growth factors. Moreover, not all HGF/SF-binding HS species were able to restore the growth-stimulatory activity of HGF/SF in HS-deficient Huma 109 cells. Indeed cell-derived HSPGs, which bind HGF/SF (7.Rahmoune H. Rudland P.S. Gallagher J.T. Fernig D.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6003-6008Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), were ineffective in restoring the HGF/SF effect on DNA synthesis even when they were coated on the substratum. Structural differences within the glycosaminoglycan chains may be responsible for the differences in activity of HGF/SF, and these questions will need further investigation. Both HGF/SF and HS chains have been shown to interact with macromolecules from the extracellular matrix (6.Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Rahmoune H. Fernig D.G. Nakamura T. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol.

Binding studies in an optical biosensor have shown that collagen I and the Hep 1 domain of fibronectin do indeed bind to HS chains purified from Huma 109 cells. 2H. Rahmoune and D. G. Fernig, unpublished observations. Furthermore, our results suggest that the growth-stimulatory activity of HGF/SF may require that the HSPG receptors be immobilized either directly or via interaction with collagen I or fibronectin at the basal membrane level and then facilitate interactions between the growth factors and their receptors. When Huma 109 myoepithelial-like cells are grown on collagen, on fibronectin, or even on medium-derived HSPGs, they had a better uptake of [3H]thymidine (Figs. 1 and 4) than when they are grown on plastic. Myoepithelial-like cells are know to produce their own growth factors (21.Rudland P.S. Baraclough R. Fernig D.G. Smith J.A. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. Leinster S. Lunt G.G. Mammary Development and Cancer. 63. Portland Press, Colchester, UK1998: 1-20Google Scholar, 27.Smith J.A. Winslow D.P. Rudland P.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 119: 120-126Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and their retention by the substratum may result in a residual level of DNA synthesis higher than that for cells grown on plastic. The requirement for anchored HSPG is then in favor of a preferential localization of the binding sites of HGF/SF on the basement membrane to induce HGF/SF signaling. Interestingly, the stimulation of cell scattering by HGF/SF in chlorate-treated MDCK epithelial cells has recently been demonstrated to require also an immobilized HSPG receptor (5.Deakin J.A. Lyon M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1999-2009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Correct orientation of glycosaminoglycan chains seems to be crucial to cellular events such as cell proliferation or cell scattering. Taken together the results suggest that the stimulation of proliferation of Huma 109 myoepithelial-like cells by HGF/SF requires a sustained dual phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK, which in turn requires the cells to possess both c-met and an immobilized HSPG receptor for HGF/SF. Whether the HSPG receptors are located in the extracellular matrix/basement membrane, at the surface of the responsive cell, or at the surface of an adjacent cell is an intriguing question that remains to be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W1995147287,"PAX6 is required for proper development of the eye, central nervous system, and nose. PAX6 has two DNA binding domains, a glycine-rich region that links the two DNA binding domains, and a transactivation domain. There is evidence that the different DNA binding domains of PAX6 have different target genes. However, it is not clear if the two DNA binding domains function independently. We have studied the effect of structural changes in the paired domain on the function of PAX6 mediated through its homeodomain. The R26G and I87R mutations have been reported in different human patients with clinically different phenotypes and are in the N- and the C-terminal halves of the paired domain, respectively. Surprisingly, we found that the I87R mutant protein not only lost the transactivation function but also failed to bind DNA by either of its DNA binding domains. In contrast, the R26G mutant protein lost DNA binding through its paired domain but had greater DNA binding and transactivation than wild-type PAX6 on homeodomain binding sites. Like R26G, the 5a isoform showed higher DNA binding than wild-type PAX6. This study demonstrates that the two subdomains of the paired domain influence the function of the homeodomain differentially and also provides an explanation for the difference in phenotypes associated with these mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2092307147,"Isothermal titration calorimetry has been used to investigate the thermodynamic parameters of the binding of thymidine (dT) and ATP to herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV1 TK). Binding follows a sequential pathway in which dT binds first and ATP second. The free enzyme does not bind ATP, whose binding site becomes only accessible in the HSV1 TK·dT complex. At pH 7.5 and 25 °C, the binding constants are 1.9 × 10<sup>5</sup>m<sup>−1</sup> for dT and 3.9 × 10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>−1</sup> for ATP binding to the binary HSV1 TK·dT complex. Binding of both substrates is enthalpy-driven and opposed by a large negative entropy change. The heat capacity change (Δ<i>Cp</i>) obtained from Δ<i>H</i> in the range of 10–25 °C is −360 cal K<sup>−1</sup> mol<sup>−1</sup> for dT binding and −140 cal K<sup>−1</sup> mol<sup>−1</sup> for ATP binding. These large Δ<i>Cp</i> values are incompatible with a rigid body binding model in which the dT and ATP binding sites pre-exist in the free enzyme. Values of Δ<i>Cp</i> and<i>T</i>Δ<i>S</i> strongly indicate large scale conformational adaptation of the active site in sequential substrate binding. The conformational changes seem to be more pronounced in dT binding than in the subsequent ATP binding. Considering the crystal structure of the ternary HSV1 TK·dT·ATP complex, a large movement in the dT binding domain and a smaller but substantial movement in the LID domain are proposed to take place when the enzyme changes from the substrate-free, presumably more open and less ordered conformation to the closed and compact conformation of the ternary enzyme-substrate complex."
https://openalex.org/W2076555071,"Signal sequences for insertion of proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum induce translocation of either the C- or the N-terminal sequence across the membrane. The end that is translocated is primarily determined by the flanking charges and the hydrophobic domain of the signal. To characterize the hydrophobic contribution to topogenesis, we have challenged the translocation machinery in vivo in transfected COS cells with model proteins differing exclusively in the apolar segment of the signal. Homo-oligomers of hydrophobic amino acids as different in size and shape as Val19, Trp19, and Tyr22 generated functional signal sequences with similar topologies in the membrane. The longer a homo-oligomeric sequence of a given residue, the more N-terminal translocation was obtained. To determine the topogenic contribution of all uncharged amino acids in the context of a hydrophobic signal sequence, two residues in a generic oligoleucine signal were exchanged for all uncharged amino acids. The resulting scale resembles a hydrophobicity scale with the more hydrophobic residues promoting N-terminal translocation. In addition, the helix breakers glycine and proline showed a position-dependent effect, which raises the possibility of a conformational contribution to topogenesis. Signal sequences for insertion of proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum induce translocation of either the C- or the N-terminal sequence across the membrane. The end that is translocated is primarily determined by the flanking charges and the hydrophobic domain of the signal. To characterize the hydrophobic contribution to topogenesis, we have challenged the translocation machinery in vivo in transfected COS cells with model proteins differing exclusively in the apolar segment of the signal. Homo-oligomers of hydrophobic amino acids as different in size and shape as Val19, Trp19, and Tyr22 generated functional signal sequences with similar topologies in the membrane. The longer a homo-oligomeric sequence of a given residue, the more N-terminal translocation was obtained. To determine the topogenic contribution of all uncharged amino acids in the context of a hydrophobic signal sequence, two residues in a generic oligoleucine signal were exchanged for all uncharged amino acids. The resulting scale resembles a hydrophobicity scale with the more hydrophobic residues promoting N-terminal translocation. In addition, the helix breakers glycine and proline showed a position-dependent effect, which raises the possibility of a conformational contribution to topogenesis. endoplasmic reticulum Proteins destined for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 are synthesized with a hydrophobic signal sequence of typically 10–20 uncharged, mainly apolar amino acids. This sequence is recognized by the signal recognition particle, which targets the nascent chain-ribosome complex via the signal recognition particle receptor to the ER membrane (1.Walter P. Johnson A.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). The ribosome binds to the translocon, a gated pore made of several copies of the heterotrimeric Sec61 complex (2.Görlich D. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 615-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 3.Hanein D. Matlack K.E.S. Jungnickel B. Plath K. Kalies K.-U. Miller K.R. Rapoport T.A. Akey C.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 4.Wang L. Dobberstein B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The signal sequence inserts into the translocon, specifically contacting Sec61α, in a manner that leads to translocation of either the C terminus or the N terminus across the membrane (5.Mothes W. Jungnickel B. Brunner J. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cleaved signals of secretory and type I membrane proteins (e.g. glycophorin) and signal anchor sequences of type II membrane proteins (e.g. transferrin receptor) translocate the C-terminal sequence, whereas the reverse signal anchors of cytochrome P-450, microsomal epoxide hydrolase, and opsin, for example, translocated the N-terminal sequence. The end of the signal that is translocated is determined by several factors. Charged residues flanking the apolar segment of the signal influence the insertion process in a manner that induces the more positive end to stay on the cytoplasmic side (6.von Heijne G. Gavel Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 7.Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). However, the charge distribution is not generally sufficient to determine the orientation and to generate a unique topology (8.Beltzer J.P. Fiedler K. Fuhrer C. Geffen I. Handschin C. Wessels H.P. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 973-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Parks G.D. Lamb R.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 777-787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Hydrophilic sequences N-terminal of the signal may inhibit their translocation if they fold in the cytosol before targeting is completed (10.Denzer A.J. Nabholz C.E. Spiess M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6311-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Similarly, we have recently observed that glycosylation at sites near the signal sequence can influence topogenesis by glycan attachment to polypeptide segments that are transiently exposed to the ER lumen (11.Goder V. Bieri C. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In addition, the apolar segment of the signal itself makes a significant contribution to orienting the signal within the translocon and the membrane. In diagnostic mutant constructs, an increased fraction of N-terminal translocation was obtained with increasing length and hydrophobicity of this segment (12.Sato T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2391-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 13.Sakaguchi M. Tomiyoshi R. Kuroiwa T. Mihara K. Omura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 16-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 14.Wahlberg J.M. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 15.Harley C.A. Holt J.A. Turner R. Tipper D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24963-24971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The influence of oligoleucine signals of different lengths on the topology was additive with the effects of flanking charges and of the N-terminal hydrophilic sequence (14.Wahlberg J.M. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The topogenic contribution of the hydrophobic sequence was also shown to be important for natural proteins, since the correct and unique insertion of the signals of the vasopressin precursor (Ncyt/Cexo) and of microsomal epoxide hydrolase (Nexo/Ccyt) was compromised upon extending or shortening the apolar sequence, respectively (16.Eusebio A. Friedberg T. Spiess M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In most constructs, both the length of the hydrophobic domain and its total hydrophobicity were altered simultaneously, hampering the distinction between these two factors with respect to their influence on topogenesis. Summing up the hydropathy indices for different sequences did not yield a good correlation between total hydrophobicity and the resulting topologies (14.Wahlberg J.M. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 15.Harley C.A. Holt J.A. Turner R. Tipper D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24963-24971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The analysis suggested that neither the length of the apolar segment nor its hydrophobicity alone is responsible for the observed effects on insertion behavior. In fact, it was observed that orientation was also strongly affected by the distribution of hydrophobicity within the apolar segment, since the more hydrophobic terminus appeared to be preferentially translocated (15.Harley C.A. Holt J.A. Turner R. Tipper D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24963-24971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is obvious that two different sequences of the same length also differ in properties other than just hydrophobicity, such as the shape of the molecule and the propensity to assume α-helical conformation. To identify the features within the hydrophobic segment of the signal that influence topogenesis and favor N- or C-terminal translocation, we have tested the effect of homo-oligomeric sequences of hydrophobic residues other than leucine. In addition, we tested the effect of individual residues of all uncharged amino acids within the context of a generic oligoleucine sequence. The resulting ranking of amino acids with respect to their effect on N-terminal translocation resembles a hydrophobicity scale yet differs from all existing major scales. This insertion scale may be useful to improve topology prediction and to characterize the functional properties of the inside of the translocation pore. The plasmids encoding H1ΔQL16 and H1ΔQL19 have been described previously (14.Wahlberg J.M. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). H1ΔQ derivatives with hydrophobic sequences Ala16, Ile16, Val16, Phe16, (Leu-Val)8, (Leu-Ala)8, Tyr22, Met16, and Met22 were generated by annealing two complementary oligonucleotides encoding the sequence MGPQ and the respective hydrophobic sequences with 5′ and 3′ sticky ends for ligation into a KpnI and a BamHI site, respectively. For example, to construct H1ΔQV16, the oligonucleotides CATGGGACCGCAGGTAGTTGTCGTGGTGGTCGTAGTTGTAGTTGTCGTGGTAGTTGTCGTGG and GATCCCACGACAACTACCACGACAACTACAACTACGACCACCACGACAACTACCTGCGGTCCCATGGTAC were used. The annealed oligonucleotides were ligated into the plasmid pE-BE, digested with KpnI and BamHI. pE-BE corresponds to the expression vector pECE (17.Ellis L. Clauser E. Morgan D.O. Edery M. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cell. 1986; 45: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar) with a modified polylinker and containing the H1 cDNA from BamHI toEcoRI, encoding the C-terminal domain (residues 60–291) immediately following the transmembrane anchor of H1. Using annealing oligonucleotides designed to produce H1ΔQW22, constructs were obtained, which upon sequencing turned out to represent H1ΔQW19 and H1ΔQW21. Constructs encoding extended homo-oligopeptide sequences were generated by polymerase chain reaction with Vent polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using an antisense oligonucleotide corresponding to the 3′-end of the oligopeptide sequence of an existing construct, extending it by three codons, and providing again a BamHI sequence, in combination with a 5′-primer corresponding to a sequence in the plasmid. For example, H1ΔQV19, H1ΔQV22, and H1ΔQV25 were produced using a the mutagenic antisense oligonucleotides CGCGGATCCCACCACCACCACGACAACTACCACG, CGCGGATCCGACGACGACCACCACCACCACGACA, and CGCGGATCCTACTACAACGACGACGACCACCACC with the templates H1ΔQV16, H1ΔQV19, and H1ΔQV22, respectively. The polymerase chain reaction products were digested with KpnI and a BamHI and ligated into pE-BE. To introduce different amino acids within the oligoleucine sequence of H1ΔQL16 and H1ΔQL19 for the constructs H1ΔQX 2/16 and H1ΔQX 2/19, polymerase chain reaction was performed using an antisense oligonucleotide corresponding to the 3′-end of the oligoleucine sequence of H1ΔQL16 or H1ΔQL19 including the BamHI site and containing mutations to alter the sequence of Leu-8 and Leu-13 or the sequence of Leu-11 and Leu-16, respectively, to codons of the desired amino acid X. To introduce the amino acids in the N-terminal half of the oligoleucine sequence of H1ΔQL19 for the constructs H1ΔQX 2/19N, polymerase chain reaction was performed using a sense oligonucleotide corresponding to the 5′-end of the sequence including the KpnI site and containing mutations to alter the sequence of Leu-4 and Leu-9 to the desired codons. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Cell culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. COS-7 cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C with 7.5% CO2. The media were supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transfection of COS-7 cells was performed using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) in six-well clusters, and the cells were processed the second day after transfection. For in vivo labeling, transfected cells were incubated for 30 min in methionine-free medium, labeled for 30 min at 37 °C with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products) in starvation medium, transferred to 4 °C, and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. To extract cytoplasmic proteins, the cells were incubated with 500 μl of 0.1% saponin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at 4 °C. The saponin extract was removed, and the cells were lysed. Both fractions were immunoprecipitated using a rabbit antiserum directed against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 277–287 near the carboxyl terminus of the ASGP receptor H1 (anti-H1C). The immune complexes were isolated with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For analysis with endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), the immune complexes were isolated with protein A-Sepharose and boiled in 50 μl of 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 6, 1% SDS. Aliquots were incubated with 1 milliunit of endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H for 2 h at 37 °C. Finally, samples were boiled in SDS-sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels were fixed, soaked in 1 m sodium salicylate containing 1% glycerol, dried, and fluorographed on Kodak BioMax MR films. Quantitation was performed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). As a starting point to test the topogenic properties of different hydrophobic sequences, we used protein H1ΔQ, a derivative of subunit H1 of the human asialoglycoprotein receptor. Wild-type H1 is a typical type II membrane protein with a 40-residue N-terminal, cytosolic domain. Truncation of the 36 N-terminal amino acids in H1Δ (Fig.1 A) did not affect its orientation in the membrane (14.Wahlberg J.M. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In H1ΔQ, the arginine preceding the transmembrane domain was in addition mutated to glutamine, reducing the N-terminal positive charge. The charge distribution for the signal of H1ΔQ is still typical of a type II membrane protein: +1 at the N terminus due to the α-amino group of Met-1 versus −1 in the C-terminal flanking region (calculated according to Ref. 7.Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, ∼20% of the polypeptides inserted with an Nexo/Ccyt orientation (14.Wahlberg J.M. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). With a Leu16 sequence in place of the wild-type 19-residue hydrophobic sequence, H1ΔQL16 inserted with an increased fraction of ∼60% N-terminal translocation (14.Wahlberg J.M. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This construct was therefore a good model to test the insertion behavior of a variety of derivatives with different hydrophobic sequences. Constructs were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, labeled with [35S]methionine for 30 min, immunoprecipitated, and analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Their topologies with respect to the membrane (schematically shown in Fig.1 B) were derived from the glycosylation state of the proteins and from their extractability with 0.1% saponin. Translocation of the C terminus is apparent by glycosylation of the products. Translocation of the N terminus results in unglycosylated polypeptides, which can be distinguished from molecules that failed to insert by extraction with 0.1% saponin. This treatment allows soluble polypeptides to be released into the medium, whereas the membranes remain sufficiently intact to retain integrated proteins. As shown in Fig. 1 C (lanes 1–4), both the endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H-sensitive, glycosylated form and the unglycosylated form of H1ΔQL16 were completely resistant to extraction into the saponin supernatant (S) and were recovered with the remainder of the cells (C). This indicates that they were integral membrane proteins. In contrast, H1ΔQA16 was entirely extracted with saponin (Fig. 1 C, lanes 5–8). Thus, a sequence of 16 alanines is not functional as a signal sequence for targeting and insertion into the ER membrane. H1ΔQ with the wild-type transmembrane segment (lanes 9–12) produced a small fraction of unglycosylated, inextractable polypeptides corresponding to proteins spanning the membrane with an exoplasmic N terminus. The majority of the polypeptides were glycosylated. However, a significant fraction was slightly smaller and saponin-extractable. This material is the product of signal peptidase cleavage, as has previously been observed for H1Δ translated in vitro (18.Schmid S.R. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16886-16891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There, the cleavage site had been identified by radiosequencing to be between glycine and serine at the end of the apolar segment. Depending upon the presence or absence of the N-terminal tail, the signal sequence is most likely positioned differently within the translocon or the membrane, exposing a cryptic site to signal peptidase. Interestingly, H1Δ was not significantly cleaved in vivo (14.Wahlberg J.M. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 19.Wahlberg J.M. Geffen I. Reymond F. Simmen T. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 285-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), possibly because the kinetics of leaving the range of signal peptidase is much faster in vivo. Mutation of the N-terminal flanking arginine to glutamine in H1ΔQ appeared to further enhance accessibility of the cleavage site, resulting in more than 50% cleavage in vivo. The other hexadecamer sequences tested in the context of H1ΔQ,i.e. Ile16, Phe16, Met16, and Val16, produced functional signal sequences giving rise to very few polypeptides that were both unglycosylated and extractable (Fig. 2). In comparison with Leu16, only Ile16 generated a larger fraction of polypeptides with a translocated N terminus (86%; Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4). All others exclusively translocated their C terminus (lanes 7–12). An alternating sequence of leucines and valines, ((LV) 8), yielded an intermediate distribution with 40% N-terminal translocation. The signal-anchor of H1ΔQV16 and H1ΔQ(LV)8 was almost completely cleaved. In order to determine the relative topogenic preference of homo-oligomers of valine, phenylalanine, and methionine, we generated constructs with extended sequences (Val16 to Val25, Phe16 to Phe25, Met22). In addition, we also analyzed oligomers of tryptophan (Trp19 and Trp21) and tyrosine (Tyr22), i.e. of the amino acids with the most bulky side chains. Residues that are less hydrophobic than alanine were not tested, since they are unlikely to yield functional signal sequences. All of the sequences tested were capable of targeting and inserting the protein into the ER membrane, although not always completely (Fig. 2, lanes 19–42). As observed before for oligoleucine sequences (14.Wahlberg J.M. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) (Fig.3), longer oligomers of valine, tryptophan, or phenylalanine produced increasing fractions of polypeptides with N-terminal translocation (Figs. 2 and 3). The length dependence of orientation for the different amino acids is approximately parallel but shifted relative to each other (Fig. 3). Fifty percent N-terminal translocation is obtained with approximate lengths of 14 (leucine), 19 (valine and tryptophan), and 23 residues (phenylalanine). In the oligovaline series, an increasing population of products was found not to be targeted (i.e. was not glycosylated but was extractable), indicating that the functionality of the signal sequence was reduced with increasing length. Yet, long hydrophobic sequencesper se did not cause poor functionality, since even 25-mers of leucine (14.Wahlberg J.M. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and phenylalanine (Fig. 2) were completely integrated. Incomplete insertion was also obtained for constructs with Trp19, Trp21, and Tyr22. In the case of Tyr22, however, even glycosylated polypeptides without apparent signal cleavage were partially extracted, suggesting that an oligotyrosine sequence may not be capable of efficiently anchoring a protein in the membrane. From the quantitation of the results (Fig. 3), the following ranking of the amino acids with respect to their ability as a homo-oligomer to translocate the N terminus can be derived: Ile > Leu > Val ≈ Trp > Tyr > Phe > Met. We have recently observed that glycosylation can influence topogenesis of proteins with ambiguous topogenic determinants (11.Goder V. Bieri C. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This indicated that, within the translocon, the nascent polypeptides undergo dynamic reorientation, which can be influenced by protein modifications occurring simultaneously. Since signal cleavage, like glycosylation, occurs cotranslationally, it might also affect topogenesis. To test this possibility, we compared the insertion behavior of the signals Val16, (Leu-Val)8, Leu16, and Ile16 with sequences carrying individual mutations designed to prevent or to allow signal cleavage. The most probable reason why Val16, (Leu-Val)8, and wild type, but not Leu16 and Ile16, allow signal cleavage is the presence of valines near the C terminus that fit into position −3 or −1 relative to the cleavage site where signal peptidase requires small, uncharged residues (20.von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar). Indeed, mutation of the last two valines of Val16 to leucines in V14LL blocked cleavage entirely (Fig.4, lanes 3 and4), as did mutation of the last valine of (Leu-Val)8 to leucine in (LV)7LL (lanes 7 and 8). Conversely, exchanging the penultimate residue of Leu16 to valine in L14VL (lanes 11 and 12) induced efficient cleavage of the glycosylated products. However, mutations to valine in the terminal positions of Ile16(I13VII, I14VI, and I15V;lanes 15–20) were ineffective. Most importantly, the mutations did not significantly affect the ratio of N- to C-terminal translocation, as is evident from quantitation of the products (values indicated in Fig. 4). Thus, signal cleavage did not detectably influence topogenesis. Therefore, cleavage of a construct does not interfere with the analysis of the topogenic properties of different sequences. The hydrophobic segment of natural signal sequences is not exclusively composed of hydrophobic amino acids; it may also contain polar, uncharged residues. To determine the contribution of all uncharged amino acids in the context of a hydrophobic signal sequence on its orientation, two residues in the generic oligoleucine signal of H1ΔQL16 or H1ΔQL19 were exchanged for all uncharged residues (H1ΔQX 2/16 or H1ΔQX 2/19; Fig.5). The nonleucine residues were placed at positions n and n + 5, which places them on opposite sides of an α-helix. The expression products are shown in Fig. 5 (A and B), and the resulting topologies are quantified in Fig. 6. The residues that were tested in both H1ΔQX 2/16 and H1ΔQX 2/19 showed the same relative behavior: Leu ≈ Trp > Tyr > Cys > Ala > Thr. Only isoleucine and valine increased the fraction of polypeptides with a translocated N terminus in comparison with an oligoleucine sequence. Tryptophan had no effect, whereas all the other amino acids reduced N-terminal translocation to various degrees. The amino acids that most effectively reduced N-terminal translocation are the most polar uncharged residues histidine, glutamine, and asparagine and the helix breakers proline and glycine.Figure 6Quantitation of the topologies of H1ΔQX 2/16, H1ΔQX 2/19, and H1ΔQX 2/19N.Multiple experiments similar those shown in Fig. 5 were quantified using a PhosphorImager. The fraction of polypeptides with a translocated N terminus (i.e. unglycosylated and inextractable) as a percentage of the total inextractable products is plotted for each amino acid X in H1ΔQX 2/16 (A, bars), H1ΔQX 2/19 (B, bars), and H1ΔQX 2/19N (B, open circles). The mean and S.D. of three or four determinations are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the initial series H1ΔQX 2/16 and H1ΔQX 2/19, the nonleucine residues were placed in positions 4 and 9 from the C-terminal end of the hydrophobic sequence. To test whether the position in the second half of the hydrophobic sequence is important for topology, constructs were made in which Thr, Ser, Gly, Asn, Gln, His, and Pro, i.e. the residues most strongly affecting the topogenic behavior of the apolar sequence, were placed in positions 4 and 9 from the N-terminal end (H1ΔQX 2/19N; Fig. 5 C and Fig. 6,circles). Moving these residues from the C-terminal to the N-terminal half of the signal inverts the hydrophobicity gradient along the hydrophobic sequence, which was expected to result in a slight reduction of N-terminal translocation (15.Harley C.A. Holt J.A. Turner R. Tipper D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24963-24971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This effect was observed for asparagine, whereas for threonine, serine, glutamine, and histidine, no statistically significant difference could be observed. In the case of proline and glycine, however, N-terminal translocation was significantly increased in H1ΔQX 2/19N versus H1ΔQX 2/19. Since proline and glycine are the two strongest helix breakers, this result suggests that the conformation of the hydrophobic sequence also influences topogenesis. Signal sequences have two distinct functions: to target the nascent chain-ribosome complex to the ER membrane and to initiate translocation of the sequence on either one of its ends. The first function is to recruit the signal recognition particle in an interaction that requires a sufficiently hydrophobic core of the signal (1.Walter P. Johnson A.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 21.Hatsuzawa K. Tagaya M. Mizushima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 270-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). After targeting to the ER membrane, the signal is recognized by the Sec61 translocation complex, leading to a tight junction between the ribosome-nascent chain complex and the translocon (22.Jungnickel B. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 261-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Photocross-linking analysis revealed that upon complete insertion into the channel, signal sequences are precisely positioned with respect to the protein components of the channel and lipids, suggesting a specific binding site of protein-protein interactions at the interface between the channel and the surrounding lipids (5.Mothes W. Jungnickel B. Brunner J. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 23.Martoglio B. Hofmann M.W. Brunner J. Dobberstein B. Cell. 1995; 81: 207-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic segment of the signal was found to specifically contact the transmembrane helices 2 and 7 of Sec61p in yeast (24.Plath K. Mothes W. Wilkinson B.M. Stirling C.J. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1998; 94: 795-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). An additional component, TRAM (translocating chain-associatingmembrane protein), was shown by in vitrocross-linking to be in contact with signal sequences (2.Görlich D. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 615-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 25.Voigt S. Jungnickel B. Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 26.Hegde R.S. Voigt S. Rapoport T.A. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1998; 92: 621-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and in particular with the N-terminal hydrophilic segments (27.High S. Martoglio B. Görlich D. Andersen S.S. Ashford A.J. Giner A. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. Dobberstein B. Brunner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26745-26751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In reconstitution assays, TRAM was found to be particularly important for signals with relatively short N-terminal hydrophilic segments (25.Voigt S. Jungnickel B. Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The TRAP (translocon-associatedprotein) complex has also been shown to be in proximity to translocating signal sequences (28.Görlich D. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 29.Hartmann E. Görlich D. Kostka S. Otto A. Kraft R. Knespel S. Burger E. Rapoport T.A. Prehn S. Eur. J.

Recognition of the signal sequence by a binding site in or closely associated with the translocon is likely to be a key event in defining the orientation of the signal and thus whether the N terminus or the C terminus of the protein is translocated across the membrane. The flanking charges of the signal are most likely to exert their effect on orienting the peptide by electrostatic interactions with the translocon. It is less clear how the apolar segment affects topogenesis. The effect of a hydrophobicity gradient along the apolar sequence, as observed by Harley et al. (15.Harley C.A. Holt J.A. Turner R. Tipper D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24963-24971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), could be explained by a similar gradient in the signal binding site of the translocon. A more hydrophobic surface near the luminal side would result in preferential orientation of the signal with its more hydrophobic end pointing toward the ER lumen. How longer and/or more hydrophobic sequences without hydropathy gradients induce increased N-terminal translocation is not obvious. To analyze the topogenic properties of the apolar signal sequence, we challenged the insertion machinery in vivo, using transfected COS-7 cells, with a variety of diagnostic constructs differing exclusively in the hydrophobic segment of the signal. This segment was either a homo-oligomer of a hydrophobic amino acid or oligoleucine sequences with two interspersed uncharged amino acids. The behavior of homo-oligomer signals showed that the machinery can cope with sequences that differ dramatically in size and shape,e.g. oligovaline versus oligotryptophan. Oligotryptophan and oligotyrosine sequences were sufficiently hydrophobic to be recognized by the signal recognition particle and by the translocon. This is not trivial, since various hydrophobicity scales differ considerably in the classification of these two residues (Table I). According to some criteria, tryptophan is considered the most hydrophobic amino acid, whereas according to others it is ranked below serine and threonine. Similarly, tyrosine is regarded as a very hydrophilic residue by some scales. Although the oligotyrosine sequence was functional for targeting and insertion, it appeared not to be an efficient membrane anchor, since glycosylated (and therefore initially integrated) polypeptides were partially extractable by saponin. Furthermore, our results confirm as a general rule what was previously observed for oligoleucine sequences of 7–25 residues (14.Wahlberg J.M. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar); the longer a homo-oligomeric sequence of a given residue, the higher the proportion of proteins with a translocated N terminus.Table ITopogenic preference of amino acids for N-terminal translocation versus hydrophobicity and helix propensity scalesTopogenesisHydrophobicity scalesα-Helix propensityHomoMixedKDGESVARHPGHCWWLDCFIIIFFMWIWIELVVMMLFVFLMVWLWLIIFICFYVAYFFLVLVWIMLLFLFYCCCALVMIAKMCMWACYACMFMAAGVTGMGQAGTTWGWGYIWTTGYTCTVCVSSSSSAHPSSTDGWPQPREPTWHNYYNYKHAHSRQPHPGQDYNHTHHQHQSNPQSPDENQNKRNQQRCKEEHEKRNYRKDNDRKDNDREDKGRKEEPDPThe ranking of amino acids (one-letter codes) with respect to topogenic preference for N-terminal translocation as determined by homo-oligopeptide signal sequences in constructs H1ΔQX n (homo; from Fig. 3) or by amino acids inserted into oligoleucine signals in constructs H1ΔQX 2/16 and H1ΔQX 2/19(mixed; from Fig. 6, bars) is compared with the ranking with respect to hydrophobicity (KD, Kyte and Doolittle (31.Kyte J.

J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 30.Landolt-Marticorena C. Williams K.A. Deber C.M. Reithmeier R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). It can thus serve as a generic hydrophobic matrix to assess the relative effect of interspersed nonleucine residues, even if they are polar and cannot possibly function as a targeting signal by themselves. The ranking order of residues with respect to promoting or allowing N-terminal translocation in an oligoleucine context can be seen to resemble a hydrophobicity scale. However, existing hydrophobicity scales, which are based on different theoretical calculations and/or various experimental measurements, differ considerably from each other (Table I). Our topogenic scale resembles most closely the hydropathy scale by Kyte and Doolittle (31.Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar). The main disagreements are the rankings of tryptophan, tyrosine, glycine, and proline. One observation suggests, however, that the hydrophobicity of the side chains is not the only criterion influencing topogenesis. The helix breakers glycine and proline showed a position-dependent effect. Proline is a helix breaker because it cannot form a hydrogen bond between its amide nitrogen and the backbone carbonyl of a residue at position −4 in an α-helix. For this reason, a proline is tolerated in positions 1–4 of a helix. In H1ΔQP2/19 and H1ΔQP2/19N, there is one proline near the center of the hydrophobic sequence and a second one at position 4 either from the C terminus, where it destabilizes or kinks the α-helix, or from the N terminus, where it does not. In H1ΔQP2/19N, the effect of the prolines on the topologies is smaller than in H1ΔQP2/19, correlating with the conformational effect of the second proline. Similarly, the effect of glycine, which destabilizes an α-helix by increasing the conformational freedom, is reduced near the N terminus of the helix. The conformation of the hydrophobic core of the signal may therefore play a role in topogenesis. There is clearly no correlation between the topogenic effects and the α-helix propensities of the amino acids as determined from the structures of soluble proteins (32.Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar) (Table I, column CF) or from circular dichroism analysis of peptides in aqueous solution (33.Liu L.P. Deber C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23645-23648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, it has been shown that the helix propensities are dramatically different in a hydrophobic environment (33.Liu L.P. Deber C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23645-23648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 34.Li S.C. Deber C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Testing the effect of different amino acids X on the helix content of peptides with the sequence KKAAAXAAAAAXAAWAAXAAAKKKK-amide in n-butanol yielded a helicity scale that is quite similar to hydrophobicity scales (33.Liu L.P. Deber C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23645-23648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (Table I, column LD). This scale is also quite similar to the topogenic scale determined here. The major differences concern glycine, whose properties are position-dependent in our system, and tryptophan. A recent study on the insertion of polypeptides with closely spaced conflicting signal sequences demonstrated that dynamic reorientation of polypeptides can occur within the translocon (11.Goder V. Bieri C. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This is also likely to happen for the signals analyzed here, since the topogenic determinants are somewhat ambiguous, resulting in a mixture of orientations. Signals that form a short, unstable, or kinked hydrophobic helix may reorientate more easily within the translocon than those with a long and stable helix. Since this correlates with preferential translocation of the C and the N terminus, respectively, it might indicate that the signal initially inserts into the translocon with its free N terminus and subsequently, depending on its flanking charges, tends to invert its orientiation as the nascent polypeptide grows at the C-terminal end. A sizable N-terminal hydrophilic extension would be expected to inhibit initial insertion with the N terminus and reduce N-terminal translocation. This is indeed the case, since N-terminal translocation, which for the tailless protein H1ΔLeu25 amounted to ∼80%, was entirely blocked for H1Leu25, which carries the 40-residue N-terminal extension of the wild-type receptor (14.Wahlberg J.M. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Only in combination with inverted flanking charges was the effect of the long hydrophobic sequence restored (H1–4ΔLeu19–22). In this study, we have presented a new scale ranking amino acids with respect to their tendency to induce N-terminal translocation of a signal sequence. The precise mechanism by which components of the ER membrane determine the final orientation of a protein remains unclear. However, this scale, determined in vivo, will be useful in giving a more accurate method to predict the behavior of amino acids in protein topogenesis.

Mutations of these residues affected steroid binding affinity, specificity, and/or steroid-dependent transactivation.

Their structures contain 12 α-helices that are folded in a very similar way into a three-layered antiparallel α-helical sandwich that creates a hydrophobic pocket for the ligand.

The A-ring of the steroid, which has quite a similar structure in all classes of steroids, also seems to be anchored in a very similar manner via a hydrogen bond network with water and two amino acids of the receptor. In all three co-crystallized receptors an arginine, which is conserved throughout the nuclear receptor family, makes a hydrogen bond to the 3-OH substituent of estradiol (ERα), the 3-keto group of progesterone (PR), and the corresponding hydroxyl position in genistein and raloxifene (ERβ). The other amino acid involved is a glutamine in PR and a glutamate in ERα and ERβ. Because all steroid receptors binding ligands with a 3-keto containing A-ring (PR, androgen receptor, MR, and GR) have a glutamine in the corresponding position, A-ring binding selectivity is probably determined by the presence of a glutamate or a glutamine at this position.The D-ring, which is anchored at the opposite end of the ligand binding pocket, shows a greater variability of its substituents between steroids, and the amino acids of different receptors interacting with the D-ring also seem to be more variable. Of six amino acids identified to interact with the D-ring of estradiol in ERα, four amino acids at the corresponding positions in PR interacted with the D-ring of progesterone, none of which were conserved between the receptors (15.Williams S.P. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1998; 393: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar,16.Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engström O. Öhman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.-Å.

The D-ring interactions are thus likely to be involved in binding specificity.The key feature at the D-ring of most glucocorticoids is a 17β side chain containing a 20-carbonyl and a 21-OH group likely to be engaged in hydrogen bonding. Many glucocorticoids also contain additional substitutions at carbon 16 and 17, for example methyl, hydroxyl or 16α,17α-acetonide groups, that could be involved in specific interactions.To identify possible interactions between steroids and receptors whose structures are not available, homology models based on resolved crystal structures for other receptors can be built. We have developed a homology model of the GR LBD based on the ER LBD crystal structure (16.Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engström O. Öhman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.-Å. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar), in which experimental binding affinity data of several ligands were correlated to calculated binding affinity data to create an optimal model. To investigate the interactions between glucocorticoid receptor and the D-ring substituents of various glucocorticoids, we have in this paper performed site-directed mutagenesis of four amino acids (Met-560, Met-639, Gln-642, and Thr-739) likely to interact with substituents on the D-ring of the ligand as deduced from the homology model. The homology model was subsequently revised to accommodate the functional data in an optimal manner.RESULTSIn an initial homology model of hGR LBD the four amino acids Met-560, Met-639, Gln-642, and Thr-739 were located at the surface of the steroid-binding pocket and have the opportunity to interact with the 20-carbonyl, the 17-OH, the 16-oxygen, and the 21-OH group of the D-ring of the steroid, respectively (for steroid structures see Fig.1). To elucidate the role of these amino acids in ligand binding, site directed mutagenesis was performed, and the mutants were characterized with regard to binding and transactivation. Generally, amino acid substitutions were chosen to be as conservative as possible, but such that they would lead to disruption of the potential specific interactions with the ligand (e.g. hydrogen bond or electrostatic interaction) as deduced from the model. In some cases, alanine mutants were also created to mimic removal of the particular amino acid side chain. The assumption was made that if an amino acid interacts with a specific group on the steroid, mutation of this amino acid would decrease the affinity of the receptor only for steroids containing this group. The affinity for ligands containing different functional groups was estimated by competitive binding assays.Mutation of Gln-642In the initial model, the amide nitrogen of Gln-642 appeared to make a hydrogen bond (distance 3 Å) to the 16-oxygen of triamcinolone acetonide, desonide, and triamcinolone. To investigate the role of Gln-642 in steroid binding we first created mutants Q642A and Q642V. As seen in TableI (Gln-642, Series 1), Q642A had an affinity for TA similar to that of wild type, whereas Q642V had a slightly but significantly reduced affinity. A more substantial loss in affinity might have been expected if the interaction with the 16-oxygen atom was important. However, ether oxygen atoms are not very strong hydrogen bond acceptors, and van der Waals' interactions of the receptor with the hydrophobic acetonide moiety of TA may largely compensate for the loss of a hydrogen-bonding interaction.Table IAffinity for triamcinolone acetonide (Kd) and transactivating activity induced by triamcinolone acetonide (EC50) for wild type and mutant GRK dK d relative to wild typeEC50EC50 relative to wild typenmnmGln-642, Series 1 Wild type GR0.652 ± 0.074 (n = 5)0.206 ± 0.074 (n = 5) Q642A0.734 ± 0.079 (n = 5)1.11 ± 0.0850.048 ± 0.032 (n = 5)aSignificantly different from wild type GR (p < 0.05).0.231 ± 0.131 Q642V0.890 ± 0.165 (n = 5)aSignificantly different from wild type GR (p < 0.05).1.36 ± 0.1570.169 ± 0.060 (n = 5)0.861 ± 0.284Gln-642, Series 2 Wild type GR0.366 ± 0.128 (n = 4)0.267 ± 0.12 (n = 3) Q642E1.48 ± 0.751 (n = 3)aSignificantly different from wild type GR (p < 0.05).3.73 ± 0.41613.8 ± 3.0 (n = 3)aSignificantly different from wild type GR (p < 0.05).56.0 ± 16.3 Q642N0.534 ± 0.146 (n = 4)1.54 ± 0.4270.91 ± 0.38 (n = 3)3.42 ± 0.50Thr-739 Wild type GR0.473 ± 0.222 (n = 9)0.172 ± 0.144 (n = 4) T739A0.578 ± 0.227 (n = 8)1.38 ± 0.321.65 ± 0.276 (n = 4)aSignificantly different from wild type GR (p < 0.05).15.9 ± 12.8 T739V0.727 ± 0.178 (n = 4)1.33 ± 0.190.394 ± 0.238 (n = 4)2.72 ± 1.84Met-560 Wild type GR0.506 ± 0.220 (n = 4)0.425 ± 0.317 (n = 3) M560L0.851 ± 0.576 (n = 4)1.53 ± 0.490.225 ± 0.141 (n = 2)0.675 ± 0.530 M560T0.794 ± 0.353 (n = 4)1.58 ± 0.148.2 ± 1.046 (n = 2)aSignificantly different from wild type GR (p < 0.05).31.25 ± 0.071Met-639 Wild type GR0.601 ± 0.125 (n = 3)0.437 ± 0.208 (n = 2) M639V1.36 ± 0.286 (n = 3)aSignificantly different from wild type GR (p < 0.05).2.27 ± 0.3111.1 ± 0.141 (n = 2)aSignificantly different from wild type GR (p < 0.05).28.7 ± 14.0Affinity was analyzed by Scatchard analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Transactivating activity was determined by dose response in a transient expression reporter system.

Open table in a new tab To examine whether the specificity of the mutant receptors for other steroids was affected, the affinity for a range of steroids containing several different functional groups was determined in binding competition assays (Fig. 2). Interestingly, both Q642A and Q642V had a clearly reduced affinity for the steroids cortisol, 9α-fluorocortisol, prednisolone, triamcinolone, and dexamethasone, containing a 17α-OH group as a common feature (Fig. 2, A–E), whereas the affinity for desonide, corticosterone, and deoxycorticosterone, lacking the 17α-OH group, was unaltered (Fig. 2, F–H), or even somewhat enhanced for the Q642V mutant (deoxycorticosterone and corticosterone). These interesting specificity changes suggested to us that there might be a direct interaction between the Gln-642 side chain and the 17α-OH group and that the shorter and more hydrophobic alanine and valine were not able to make this interaction.Figure 2Steroid binding specificity of GR mutants Q642A and Q642V.

Like the alanine and valine mutants, Q642N had almost similar affinity for TA as wild type, whereas the Q642E mutant displayed a significantly reduced affinity (Table I, Gln-642, Series 2).Similar to the alanine and valine mutants, both Q642E and Q642N had a severe reduction in affinity for the steroids containing a 17α-OH group (Fig. 3, A–D), with the exception of dexamethasone, where a milder reduction was seen (Fig.3 E). Both mutants, however, also had a slightly reduced affinity for steroids lacking a 17α-OH group (Fig. 3,F–H). In the case of Q642E the loss in affinity for desonide, corticosterone, and deoxycorticosterone was similar to the loss in affinity for TA, because the binding curves were overlapping. A summary of the steroid binding specificity of Gln-642 mutants as measured by competition assays, and analysis by log-logit plots is shown in Table II. Statistical analysis of the data was not performed because of the relatively low number of analyses for each specific set of criteria. However, clear trends can be identified in the data presented.Figure 3Steroid binding specificity of GR mutants Q642E and Q642N.

Open table in a new tab Transactivation studies, following transient expression of Gln-642 mutants, were carried out using various concentrations of TA. Interestingly, there was a varied degree of coupling between changes in affinity and changes in transactivation sensitivity for the four mutants studied. As seen in Fig.4 A and Table I, no difference in transactivation sensitivity was detected with mutant Q642V, even though the affinity of this mutant for TA was slightly reduced (p < 0.05). In contrast, the Q642A mutant showed an increase in transactivation sensitivity with an EC50 of around four times less than that of wild type despite similar binding affinity. This might indicate an active role for Gln-642 in the steroid-dependent conformational change in its immediate environment and the formation of the transactivating surface. As expected, Q642E, which had reduced binding affinity, was clearly less sensitive in the transactivation assay (Fig. 4 B and Table I) having an EC50 of more than 50 times that of wild type. No significant difference was seen in the transactivating sensitivity of the mutant Q642N compared with wild type (Fig. 4 B and TableI).Figure 4Dose response of Gln-642 mutants in transactivation induced by TA.

The potential function of this residue was tested by mutation to alanine and valine. There was no significant change in binding affinity for [3H]TA with either of the mutants (Table I). Binding specificity of these mutants for corticosterone, deoxycorticosterone, and 11β-OH progesterone was analyzed by competition assay to test the possible interaction of Thr-739 with the 21-OH group of the steroid (TableIII). The steroids selected also resulted in an analysis of the function of the 11β-OH group. The alanine mutant had a reduction in relative affinity for corticosterone and deoxycorticosterone (Fig. 5, Aand B) but not for 11β-OH progesterone (Fig.5 C), supporting the hypothesis of an interaction between Thr-739 and the 21-OH group. The T739V mutant, on the other hand, did not display the same specificity change. There was no relative change in affinity for corticosterone, whereas there was a small relatively increased affinity for the more hydrophobic ligands deoxycorticosterone and 11β-OH progesterone (Table III and Fig. 5).Table IIIBinding specificity of Thr-739 wild type and mutant GRWild type GRT739AT739VCorticosterone17.3 ± 15.7 (n = 4)50.9 ± 44.7 (n = 3) 2.9×23.4 ± 13.9 (n = 3) 1.3×Deoxycorticosterone20.4 ± 8.7 (n = 4)93.9 ± 71 (n = 3) 4.6×12.0 ± 8.0 (n = 3) 0.59×11β-OH progesterone35.6 ± 27.5 (n = 4)41 ± 28.1 (n = 3) 1.1×16.3 ± 15 (n = 3) 0.46×Relative binding affinity was determined by competition binding assay.

This is in clear contrast to the lack of significant change in affinity to TA for the T739A mutant. Thus, Thr-739 appears to play an active role in the signal transduction from hormone to the transactivating surface of the receptor.Mutation of Met-560In the initial model, the sulfur of Met-560 made a putative favorable electrostatic interaction (distance, <3 Å) with the 20-carbonyl oxygen of the steroid. Such nonbonded sulfur-nucleophile close contacts have been reported earlier in the crystallographic literature (35.Burling F.T. Goldstein B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 2313-2320Crossref Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 36.Rosenfield R.E. Parthasarathy R. Dunitz J.D. J. Am. Chem.

Two mutants were created; the relatively conservative M560L and the less conservative, more polar M560T. As seen in Table I, the affinity for TA was not significantly affected for either mutant. In the transactivation assay with TA, however, M560T was clearly less sensitive than wild type (Table I) despite similar binding affinity, perhaps indicating that M560T affects the AF-2 domain. M560L had a sensitivity for TA similar to that of wild type in the transactivation assay (Table I).Another possible interaction of Met-560 with the 17β side chain of the steroid D-ring was investigated by competition assay with corticosterone and 11β-OH progesterone (Fig.6). M560L had the same relative affinity for both ligands as wild type GR, whereas M560T had greatly reduced affinity for both ligands. Thus, there is no correlation with the presence of a 21-OH group in the steroid or not. Instead, the results indicate a more general hydrophobic interaction between Met-560 and the ligand, which is apparently lost by replacing methionine with the smaller and more hydrophilic threonine. Replacing methionine with the slightly more hydrophobic leucine appears to maintain this interaction.Figure 6Steroid binding specificity of Met-560 wild type and mutant GR.

We mutated this amino acid to the smaller and slightly more hydrophobic valine residue. M639V had significantly lower affinity for [3H]TA and was much less sensitive in the transactivation assay with TA (Table I). To test the role of the 17α-OH group, binding competition assays with cortisol and corticosterone were carried out (Fig. 7). M639V had a decreased affinity for both steroids to a similar degree, independent of the presence of 17α-OH. Thus, Met-639 clearly plays an active role in steroid binding, although the nature of the interaction remains unclear.Figure 7Steroid binding specificity of Met-639 wild type and mutant GR.

However, in a homology model of the closely related MR, in addition to the corresponding amino acid to Thr-739 (MR Thr-945), the amino acid corresponding to Asn-564 (MR Asn-770) could interact with the 21-OH group, which was also supported by functional analysis (38.Fagart J.

In our initial model Asn-564 was quite far from the steroid with the closest distance being 4–6 Å to the 11β-OH group, depending on which steroid is docked. To test whether there was any interaction with the 21-OH of the steroid in GR as described for MR or alternatively with the 11β-OH, we mutated Asn-564 to alanine and valine. Both mutations decreased binding of [3H]TA to a level where binding affinity was hard to determine (data not shown).

Sugars are supposed to slide over a stretch of aromatic residues facilitated by continuous making/breaking of hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl groups of the sugars and charged amino acids, the “polar tracks.” The effect of nine single and three multiple mutations in the polar track residues was investigated by current fluctuations, liposome swelling assays, and in vivo uptake of radiolabeled substrates. Additionally, sugar transport through wild-type LamB was investigated by current fluctuation analysis in water and deuterium. This way the effects onk on and k off could be investigated separately. Analyses of the various mutants revealed a strong effect on the k on values. Because steering to the binding site requires only a few interactions, consequently the loss of even one bond will have a strong effect. Deuterium experiments, which changed the characteristic of all hydrogen bonds, showed a strong effect on k off rates, because at this stage the sugar has numerous interactions with the channel. Furthermore, all the mutations induces a strong decreaseof in vivo uptake of sugars. These results clearly demonstrate the importance of the polar track residues on both on and off rates in sugar transport and reveal a strong cooperative effect of hydrogen bond formation.

The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria contains passive diffusion channels, which are used for the uptake of nutrients and the exchange of ions through this protective barrier (1.Benz R. Bauer K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 2.Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3905-3908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Schulz G.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Most abundant are the general porins, which allow the passage of small hydrophilic molecules with molecular masses of up to 500 Da (4.Rosenbusch J.P. Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J.S.

Substrate-specific porins, like maltoporin, are moderately specific for a certain class of substances. The structure of the trimeric maltoporin (LamB protein) from Escherichia coli has been recently determined to a resolution of 3.1 Å (6.Schirmer T. Keller T.A. Wang Y.F. Rosenbusch J.P. Science. 1995; 267: 512-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). This protein is composed of three 18-stranded antiparallel β-barrels forming the framework of the channel. Three inwardly folded surface loops contribute to a constriction approximately halfway through the channel. Two structural features were observed along the sugar translocation path. First, six adjacent aromatic residues, dubbed the “greasy slide,” line the channel forming a path from the vestibule to the periplasmic outlet. Second, the remainder of the channel at the constriction zone is composed of ionizable residues, lined up in two “ionic tracks.” These ionizable residues are arranged pairwise but in most cases are too far apart from each other to form salt bridges, thus they constitute potential hydrogen bond donors/acceptors with substrates (7.Wang Y.F. Dutzler R. Rizkallah P.J. Rosenbusch J.P. Schirmer T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 56-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies (8.Dutzler R. Wang Y.F. Rizkallah P.

Multiple H bonds are formed between the sugar hydroxyl groups and the charged residues of the two ionic tracks. Constant breaking and remaking of these hydrogen bonds has been suggested to allow movement of the substrate through the channel (8.Dutzler R. Wang Y.F. Rizkallah P. Rosenbusch J.P. Schirmer T.

The role of the greasy slide in sugar translocation through the channel will be discussed in a future paper. In this study the role of the polar track residues was investigated in detail. We used a site-directed mutagenesis strategy for introducing mutations into the polar tracks. The ability of the various mutants to transport different sugars was checked by liposome swelling assays andin vivo uptake experiments. The on and off rates of maltohexaose to the binding site of the LamB protein mutant channels was determined by current fluctuation analysis and compared with those of wild-type LamB. The implications of the polar track residues for sugar uptake will be discussed, and a possible mechanism of translocation will be presented. Site-directed mutagenesis of a plasmid-encoded lamB gene was performed as described (10.Prilipov A. Phale P.S. Van Gelder P. Rosenbusch J.P. Koebnik R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 163: 65-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most polar track residues were substituted for alanines resulting in the mutant maltoporins, LamBR8A, LamBR33A, LamBR82A, LamBR109A, LamBD111A, LamBH113A, and LamBD116A. Also two isosteric replacements were made giving mutant proteins LamBD116N and LamBE43Q. Additionally two double mutant porins, LamBR109A-D111A and LamBE43Q-R109A, and a quintuple mutant, LamBR33A-E43A-R109A-H113A-D116A, were constructed. All mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis (Perkin-Elmer ABI prism, 310 genetic analyzer). DNA manipulations were according to Sambrook et al. (11.Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Mutant maltoporins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)omp5(ΔlamB ompR) (10.Prilipov A. Phale P.S. Van Gelder P. Rosenbusch J.P. Koebnik R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 163: 65-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) grown in 600 ml of LB under selection of the antibiotic ampicillin. Expression was enhanced by addition of 100 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested after overnight growth, and proteins were isolated essentially as described previously (10.Prilipov A. Phale P.S. Van Gelder P. Rosenbusch J.P. Koebnik R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 163: 65-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Four ml of minimal M9 medium, supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg·ml−1) and 0.2% maltose, was inoculated with plasmid containing derivatives of E. coli strain BL21opm5 (10.Prilipov A. Phale P.S. Van Gelder P. Rosenbusch J.P. Koebnik R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 163: 65-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) expressing the various maltoporin mutants. Gene transcription depended on the leakage of the promoter (no isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added) to avoid overexpression of the proteins. Furthermore, the use of maltose as sole carbon source induced the ABC transporter (12.Boos W. Shuman H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 204-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in a situation where the maltose concentration in the periplasm approaches zero. The bacteria were harvested at late log phase, collected by a quick spin, extensively washed in M9 medium, and redissolved in M9 medium to an A 600 of 0.2. Two ml of the suspension were used to prepare cell envelope fractions as described previously (13.Agterberg M. Adriaanse H. Lankhof H. Meloen R. Tommassen J. Vaccine. 1990; 8: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the rest was used for the in vivo transport assay. The isolated cell envelopes were analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis together with a series of increasing amounts of purified LamB of known concentration. After Coomassie Blue staining, the protein bands were quantified using a Computing densitometer model 300A (Molecular Dynamics). For the transport assay, 10 μl of [14C]maltose (ARC Chemical Inc.; specific activity, 600 mCi·mmol−1) was added to 1.5 ml of the cell suspension, and the final sugar concentration was adjusted to 1 μm with cold maltose. At different time points after the addition of the sugar, 150 μl of the suspension were filtered through a glass microfiber filter (Whatman GF/C) and washed with 5 ml of M9 medium. The filters were dried 10 min at 60 °C and counted in a scintillation counter. Lipid bilayers were made as described (14.Van Gelder P. Dumas F. Rosenbusch J.P. Winterhalter M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) with some minor modifications. Bilayers (Soybean lipid, asolectin type II S, Sigma) were formed across a hole (0.1 mm diameter) in a 0.025-mm-thick polytetrafluorethylene film (Goodfellow, Cambridge, GB dividing two half-cells containing 2.5 ml of buffer (1 m KCl, 1 mm CaCl2 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4) each. Highly purified protein in detergent (1% octyl-polyoxy-ethylene) was added to the electrolyte, and its insertion into the bilayer was favored by applying 120–170 mV across the membrane. Subsequently, the buffer in one of the half-cells was exchanged by approximately 20 half-cell volumes of fresh buffer. Ag/AgCl electrodes (Biologic, Claix, France) were used to measure membrane current via an amplifier (109 Ω, BLM-120 from Biologic) allowing the application of adjustable potentials (typically 20 mV) across the membrane. The output voltage was recorded on a storage oscilloscope (LeCroy) equipped with a Fast Fourier Transform module. The Fast Fourier Transform was performed with a rectangular filter on the oscilloscope. Power spectrum densities were recorded with a resolution of 1–5000 Hz and averaged 100–200 times. Analyzing the ion current fluctuations with respect to their frequency yields a background 1/f power spectrum, which was subtracted from the Lorentz power spectrum obtained in presence of sugar (15.Nekolla S. Andersen C. Benz R. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1388-1397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For experiments in a deuterated buffer, the pD was adjusted to 7.8, which corresponds to a pH of 7.4 (16.Gutfreund D. Press C.U. Kinetics for the Life Science: Receptors, Transmitters and Catalysis. Cambridge University Press, London1995: 275-280Google Scholar). Sugar permeation rates were determined by liposome swelling assays as described by Luckey and Nikaido (17.Luckey M. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Purified protein was reconstituted in liposomes. The rate of diffusion of sugars into vesicles was monitored by light scattering measurements of swelling of the liposome induced by the transport of sugars. For each mutant the uptake of maltose was normalized to 100%. Wild-type protein showed relative permeation rates of 222 and 57% for glucose and maltotriose, respectively, whereas sucrose transport was below the detection limit (data not shown). All mutants showed similar relative permeation rates with marginal variations. Noticeable exceptions were R8A, R109A, E43Q/R109A, and the quintuple mutant, which had acquired the ability to transport sucrose (with a rate of about 10% of that of maltose). All the mutants showed a strong decrease of sugar transport compared with wild type (Fig. 1), revealing the physiological importance of residues belonging to the polar tracks in the transport process. Current fluctuation analysis reveals the time-dependent closing and opening of the channel caused by the sugar binding, thus yielding the on and off rates of the sugar to the binding site in the channel. To avoid the problem of asymmetrical channel energy barriers (14.Van Gelder P. Dumas F. Rosenbusch J.P. Winterhalter M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), sugar was added to both sides of the membrane. The resulting kinetic rates are thus an average of the dissociation/association rates from both sides of the channels. The maltohexaose on and off rates and the corresponding affinity constants (K) were determined for each mutant, and the corresponding transport rates were estimated for high or low sugar concentration (Table I). Compared with wild-type LamB protein, all mutants showed a strongly decreased affinity (53–99.7%) for maltohexaose. These results clearly show that all the charged amino acids constituting the polar tracks play an important role in sugar translocation as predicted by structure analysis of protein-sugar complexes (8.Dutzler R. Wang Y.F. Rizkallah P. Rosenbusch J.P. Schirmer T. Structure. 1996; 4: 127-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Altogether, the association constants for maltohexaose have considerably decreased in all mutant proteins, even by 2 orders of magnitude for D116N and the multiple mutants. Interestingly, mutant D116A, which is not only unable to form H bonds but additionally also decreases the channel constriction, shows less affected k on values than the isosteric substitution mutant D116N, which displayed a dramatic decrease of thek on constant. Dissociation constants, however, showed little change; in most cases, the change was an increase. Only the single mutants R33A and D116N and the multiple mutants show a slightly decreased k off rate. Again, drastic differences were observed with D116A and D116N.Table IOn and off rates and resulting binding constant K as determined by current fluctuation analysis in the presence of maltohexaoseAmino acid change in LamBk onvaluesk off valuesAffinity constant (K)V maxaCalculated number of sugar molecules transported per monomer and per second in saturating conditions (V max) or with a sugar concentration of 5 × 10−5m (V 5×10−5).

A decreased k off of 50% for maltohexaose and of 30% for maltotriose (Table II) was observed. Thus, tighter H bonds in the sugar-protein complex results in a longer residence at the binding site. Remarkably, no effect on the on rates was detected.Table IICurrent fluctuation analysis for maltohexaose and maltotriose in H2O or D2O bufferExperimental conditionsk onvaluesk off valuesAffinity constant (K)V maxaCalculated number of sugar molecules transported per monomer and per second in saturating conditions (V max) or with a sugar concentration of 5 × 10−5m (V 5×10−5).

Confidence intervals are computed for a 90% confidence level. Previously, structure determination of LamB-maltooligosaccharide complexes revealed the presence of several hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl groups of the sugar and charged amino acids at the channel lining, the polar tracks (Fig. 2). A see-saw mechanism of hydrogen bond formation was supposed to aid sugar translocation through the porin. This study aimed to justify this hypothesis and to determine the role in transport of each of these polar track residues. The polar track residues were one by one or in combinations substituted by other amino acids (see “Experimental Procedures”). All these mutants could be isolated as trimers from the bacterial cell envelope as visualized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (results not shown), and they formed functional channels as demonstrated in liposome swelling assays and planar lipid bilayers. Most mutants showed a significant decrease of the on rates (from 31% to 0.31% of wild-type values; Table I), indicating that polar track residues are clearly involved in the fixation of the sugar to the binding site of the protein. The k off values, however, showed more variability with, unexpectedly, increasing dissociation rates for most single mutants (Table I). Intuitively, a decreased k off is expected when H bonds, which facilitate sugar movement through the channel, are removed. Replacement of charged residues by the less bulky alanine side chain, however, may not only remove H bonding partners but at the same time may also enlarge the channel and thereby lower the sterical hindrance, thus giving a possible explanation for the increase in off rates. Interestingly, all multiple mutants show strongly decreasedk off values. Here, the loss of multiple hydrogen bonds can probably not compensate for the decrease in steric hindrance, and thus these residues must be involved in facilitating movement of the sugar molecule. It also reveals a high cooperative effect of hydrogen bond formation with the sugar. Moreover, a similar effect is observed with mutant D116N, which showed a decreasedk off, whereas mutant D116A showed an increase of the dissociation rate, thus supporting the idea that decreased steric hindrance is compensating for the loss of H bonds. The second isosteric replacement, E43Q, results in an opposite effect on the off rate, a finding that this time cannot be explained by steric influences. Tentatively, two opposite effects may result from hydrogen bonding. First, H bonds can facilitate transport (Arg33, Arg109, Asp111, and Asp116), consequently after (isosteric) replacement, this will lead to a decrease in k off. Second, H bonds may stabilize the sugar-protein complex (Glu43); thus removal of an H bond will result in increased k off values. Another line of evidence for steric effects is provided by osmotic swelling experiments. In agreement with earlier studies (17.Luckey M. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), liposome swelling clearly shows that short sugars diffuse faster than longer ones. The most significant change observed is that some of them (R8A, R109A, E43Q/R109A, and the quintuple mutant) gained the ability to transport sucrose. This may again be explained by a decrease in steric hindrance because the substitutions will lead to an enlargement of the channel. Indeed, it has been observed that most of the polar track residues are conserved in the sucrose porin ScrY (20.Schmid K. Ebner R. Jahreis K. Lengeler J.W. Titgemeyer F. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 941-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), except that the corresponding residue of Arg109 has a considerably shorter aspartyl group. Measurements in D2O have the advantage that protein-sugar interactions can be modified without changing the protein structure; the deuterium bonds are known to be slightly stronger than hydrogen bonds (18.Némethy G. Scheraga H.A. J. Chem. Phys. 1964; 41: 680-689Crossref Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 19.Arnett E.M. McKelvey D.R. Coetze J.F. C. D. R. Solute-Solvent Interactions. Marcel Dekker, New York1969: 351-355Google Scholar). The results show that increasing the strength of noncovalent bonds between the protein and the sugar increases the off rate (Table II). Surprisingly, the k on values are not affected. Although mutagenesis mainly affects the k onvalues, experiments with D2O affect thek off rates. This is easily understood considering that both kinetic constants represent two different states of the sugar at the constriction site (Fig.3). The k on correspond to the association rate of the sugar. During this step only the first (and maybe also part of the second) glucosyl moiety of the oligosaccharide interact with amino acids via a few hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3 a). For this reason, the k on is very sensitive to the loss of bonds (i.e. mutations) and weakly sensitive to a slight increase of the strength of these bonds (i.e. D2O experiments). The k off correspond to the dissociation rate of the sugar. At this point the sugar is deeply embedded in the protein, all the glucosyl moieties can (and must) interact with the protein, and thus many more hydrogen bonds are formed (only a limited number of all possible interactions are shown in Fig. 3 b). Loss of a few H bonds by amino acid substitution will only weakly affect the dissociation rate (i.e. mutations), whereas increasing strength of the sum of H bonds will maintain the sugar longer at the binding site (i.e. D2O experiments). In agreement with our previous observations, in vivoexperiments demonstrated that all the mutants showed a strongly decreased sugar transport as compared with that of wild-type maltoporin (Fig. 1). For the multiple mutants, the variations observed here with maltose in vivo are less pronounced than those observedin vitro with maltohexaose. Possibly the effect of these mutations might be stronger on the transport of longer sugars. The calculated V max value for wild-type maltoporin is rather low as compared with theV max of many of the mutant channels. However, the mutant channels need much higher concentrations, far beyond physiological conditions, to reach their maximal flow (Table I). Indeed, at very low sugar concentrations wild-type channel is performing optimally (Table I), which is in harmony with the in vivo experimental results. Finally, the channel can be considered as an enzyme that catalyzes the transport of substrates from one compartment to another (21.Eisenberg R.S. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In response to the external low sugar concentration, this system appears to have evolved in a way to optimize the k onrather than the k off to transport-specific substrates with a high efficiency.

https://openalex.org/W2019280464,"Biochemical and molecular modeling studies of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase (RT) have revealed that a structural element, the minor groove binding track (MGBT), is important for both replication frameshift fidelity and processivity. The MGBT interactions occur in the DNA minor groove from the second through sixth base pair from the primer 3′-terminus where the DNA undergoes a structural transition from A-like to B-form DNA. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis had previously demonstrated that Gly262 and Trp266 of the MGBT contributes important DNA interactions. To probe the molecular interactions occurring in this critical region, eight mutants of RT were studied in which alternate residues were substituted for Trp266. These enzymes were characterized in primer extension assays in which the template DNA was adducted at a single adenine by either R- or S-enantiomers of styrene oxide. These lesions failed to block DNA polymerization by wild-type RT, yet the Trp266mutants and an alanine mutant of Gly262 terminated synthesis on styrene oxide-adducted templates. Significantly, the sites of termination occurred primarily 1 and 3 bases following adduct bypass, when the lesion was positioned in the major groove of the template-primer stem. These results indicate that residue 266 serves as a “protein sensor” of altered minor groove interactions and identifies which base pair interactions are altered by these lesions. In addition, the major groove lesion must alter important structural transitions in the template-primer stem, such as minor groove widening, that allow RT access to the minor groove.

When examined alone, the leading/lagging strand polymerases from human, Escherichia coli, and T4 bacteriophage are poorly processive, but become highly processive after binding accessory proteins (1.Kuriyan J. O'Donnell M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 2.Stillman B. Cell. 1994; 78: 725-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Each of these replication machines also exhibits high fidelity. Although the presence of an editing 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity contributes significantly to this low error rate, evidence supports a general correlation between polymerase processivity and fidelity (3.Kunkel T.A.

However, RT does not have an associated 3′ → 5′ exonuclease function (4.Roberts J.D. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1171-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar) and is only moderately processive (5.Williams K.J. Loeb L.A. Fry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18682-18689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RT is one of the most error-prone DNA polymerases examined to date, averaging one error per 2 kilobase pairs replicated (4.Roberts J.D. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A.

RT appears to lack a true processivity factorin vivo, although HIV nucleocapsid protein may operate in a manner similar to single-stranded binding protein to increase RT processivity through regions of DNA secondary structure (7.Ji X. Klarmann G.J. Preston B.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 132-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Since the rapid mutation rate of HIV is widely considered a major stumbling block in the development of therapies to combat acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, an understanding of how RT structure is correlated with function during DNA synthesis is a high priority.Several crystal structures of RT have been reported, including the apoprotein (8.Rodgers D.W.

Whereas the polymerase and RNase H domains are formed by the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of the p66 subunit, both the p66 and p51 subunits form an apparent DNA-binding cleft. The primary sequence that links the polymerase and RNase H domains has been termed the connection subdomain. The p51 subunit lacks a RNase H domain. One subdomain (residues 244–322; referred to as “thumb” using the hand analogy (see Ref. 9.Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A. Steitz T.A.

Indeed, comparisons of RT crystal structures with and without template-primer suggest that this subdomain may move as much as 30 Å (8.Rodgers D.W. Gamblin S.J. Harris B.A. Ray S. Culp J.S. Hellmig B.

However, the specific protein contacts provided by RT to bind template-primer, along with a detailed structural description of these interactions, remain elusive. Molecular modeling has been successfully applied to the RT/DNA crystal structure in an attempt to examine specific protein-DNA interactions since the resolution of the crystal structure was insufficient to define these interactions (15.Bebenek K.

Since these major groove lesions do not significantly alter the solution structure of DNA (21.Feng B. Zhou L. Passarelli M. Harris C.M. Harris T.M. Stone M.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14021-14036Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22.Feng B. Voehler M. Zhou L. Passarelli M. Harris C.M. Harris T.M. Stone M.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7316-7329Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), it was suggested that the adducts may restrict DNA bending in the template-primer stem and/or interfere with key RT-DNA contacts (possibly those supplied by MGBT residues) (23.Latham G.J. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28527-28530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we examine whether the major groove SO lesions induce structural alterations in the DNA minor groove that are monitored by residues known to interact in the minor groove in the vicinity of the DNA bend (15.Bebenek K. Beard W.A. Darden T.A. Li L. Prasad R. Luxon B.A. Gorenstein D.G. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 3: 194-197Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 16.Beard W.A. Bebenek K. Darden T.A.

To monitor structural changes in the minor groove, mutants have been created at residues Gly262and Trp266 that are known to affect DNA binding (16.Beard W.A. Bebenek K. Darden T.A. Li L. Prasad R.

Eight mutants at residue 266 have been analyzed and compared with previous work (16.Beard W.A. Bebenek K. Darden T.A. Li L. Prasad R. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30435-30442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) to ascertain whether the influence of the SO lesions occurs in a systematic manner consistent with altered DNA interactions with this residue. By examining the replication profiles of wild-type RT and Gly262 and Trp266 mutant enzymes on SO-adducted templates, we have manipulated potential nucleic acid interactions at the protein surface as the position of the SO lesion changes as the primer is progressively extended. Analyses of our results further define the structural role of these residues, as well as confirm their sites of interaction during nucleic acid synthesis.RESULTSIn order to assess the consequence(s) of mutations in the MGBT of RT on damaged DNA, the primer extension activity of each enzyme was measured on a 63-mer template containing either no adduct, or theR- or S-SO adduct coupled to theN 6 position of a specific adenine (Fig.1). The methods for the chemical synthesis of these unique lesions has been described elsewhere (23.Latham G.J. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28527-28530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,24.Harris C.M. Zhou L. Strand E.A. Harris T.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4328-4329Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The solution structure of the R- and S-SO lesions within an oligodeoxynucleotide duplex revealed that the adducts, which lie in the major groove, are well accommodated by the DNA duplex and do not distort the local helix geometry (21.Feng B. Zhou L. Passarelli M. Harris C.M. Harris T.M. Stone M.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14021-14036Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22.Feng B. Voehler M. Zhou L. Passarelli M. Harris C.M. Harris T.M. Stone M.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7316-7329Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, the R- and S-SO stereoisomers differ in their spatial orientation; the R-SON 6-adenine adduct is directed toward the 5′-end of the template (21.Feng B. Zhou L. Passarelli M. Harris C.M. Harris T.M. Stone M.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14021-14036Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), whereas the S-SO adduct is directed toward the 3′-terminus of the template (22.Feng B. Voehler M. Zhou L. Passarelli M. Harris C.M. Harris T.M. Stone M.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7316-7329Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As a result, they have nearly opposite orientations in duplex DNA, although the R- and S-SO adducts are chemically identical. The two adducts, therefore, may report protein-DNA interactions at different positions within the template-primer, even though they are attached to the same nucleotide in the template.

Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar), indicate that the DNA is A-like near the polymerase active site. Since DNA polymerases interact with duplex DNA through the DNA backbone and minor groove, these adducts allow us to assess whether there are structural perturbations translated to the minor groove and/or whether the local DNA structure is altered by these lesions as RT deforms the DNA substrate during replication.To simplify analysis of the experiments, primer extension reactions were conducted under conditions allowing single encounters between RT and the template-primer (i.e. most of the primer is left unextended). Consequently, the data could be analyzed in terms of termination probabilities, or the percentage of polymerase molecules that dissociate at each template base (29.Abbotts J. SenGupta D.N. Zon G. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15094-15103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).R- and S-SO Lesions in a Template-Primer Construct Do Not Significantly Terminate DNA Synthesis by Wild-type RTIn a previous report, we demonstrated that site-specificN 6-adenine R- or S-SO lesions situated in a 33-mer template terminated RT extension of a 17-mer primer 3–5 bases after adduct bypass (23.Latham G.J. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28527-28530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, extension past these adducts by wild-type RT on a 63-mer template primed with a 17-mer primer was essentially unhindered by the SO modification, based on limited termination observed in the vicinity of the lesion (Fig.2). This apparent discrepancy is due to the different template-primers used in these studies. The local sequence context of the R- and S-SO lesions in this work (5′-GGCAGGTGGTG-3′, where the underlined adenine was modified) and the previous study (5′-CGGACAAGAAG-3′, where the SO adducts were localized to one of the three underlined adenines) are distinct. Single base changes in the nucleotides flanking the SO adduct can alter termination probability of RT on these substrates by as much as 4-fold (23.Latham G.J. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28527-28530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the difference in the local sequence contexts between the adducted template-primer constructs could readily explain the differences in adduct bypass.Additionally, the 63-mer template shown in Fig. 1 would have a much longer single-stranded overhang than the template-primer substrate characterized previously (23.Latham G.J. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28527-28530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) when RT encountered the adduct. It has been suggested that optimal RT binding to nucleic acid requires an overhang of 6 or 7 nucleotides (14.Patel P.H. Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J.P. Tantillo C. Clark Jr., A.D. Raag R. Nanni R.G. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5351-5363Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 30.Wöhrl B.M. Tantillo C. Arnold E. Le Grice S.F.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5343-5350Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), yet the region 3–5 bases after adduct bypass where maximal RT termination was observed only provided a 3–6-nucleotide single-stranded overhang. Since that template-primer may not offer an “optimal” substrate for RT binding, the termination probabilities calculated at certain positions may have been amplified by the weak DNA interactions occurring near the end of the template. 2It should be noted that weak RT binding near the end of SO-adducted templates does not alter the interpretation or conclusions of our previous work (23.Latham G.J. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28527-28530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The consequences of a lower DNA binding affinity in the vicinity of the adduct would be fully manifested in the control (i.e. unadducted template-primer). In contrast, the 63-mer template primed with a 17-mer primer studied here provides a 23-nucleotide overhang once the polymerase encounters the adduct. As a result, this template-primer construct is an optimal (i.e. fully stabilizing) substrate in the region analyzed. Since the termination probabilities in this study are analyzed relative to the unadducted template-primer, the reason for the apparent differences with the previous work does not affect our interpretations in this study.G262A and W266A RT Are Less Processive and Exhibit More Adduct-directed Termination than Wild-type RTCharacterization of a “horizontal” 3A “vertical scan” describes the site-directed mutagenesis of a single protein residue to several alternate amino acids. In contrast, a “horizontal scan” represents mutagenesis of a series of adjacent protein residues to the same amino acid. scan of alanine mutants in αH implicated Gly262 and Trp266 as being important in RT binding to template-primer (17.Beard W.A. Stahl S.J. Kim H.-R. Bebenek K. Kumar A. Strub M.-P. Becerra S.P. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28091-28097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the activity of both mutants was comparable to wild-type enzyme, the mutants displayed dissociation rate constants for template-primer that were several orders of magnitude greater than wild-type RT. These mutants also exhibited a lower fidelity than wild-type enzyme for template-primer slippage initiated errors (18.Bebenek K. Beard W.A. Casas-Finet J.R. Kim H.-R. Darden T.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19516-19523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Since these results strongly suggested that Gly262 and Trp266 influence RT interactions with template-primer, the behavior of each alanine mutant at these two residues on SO-adducted DNA was analyzed (Fig. 2). In contrast to the activity of wild-type RT (lanes 1–3) on the SO-adducted substrates, both the W266A (lane 6) and the G262A (lane 9) enzymes terminated DNA synthesis 1–3 bases after bypassing the lesion (Fig. 2). The findings that the dominant termination sites arose after synthesis past the adduct, as opposed to opposite or one base 3′ to the adduct, are consistent with earlier results (23.Latham G.J. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28527-28530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As observed earlier with M13 DNA, both G262A RT and W266A RT were poorly processive as compared with the wild-type enzyme (18.Bebenek K. Beard W.A. Casas-Finet J.R. Kim H.-R. Darden T.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19516-19523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).The contrast between the wild-type RT and the mutant enzymes, G262A and W266A is more clearly illustrated in Fig. 2 B, where termination probability is plotted at each nucleotide position within a 10-nucleotide window around the adducted site. The position of the SO adduct is designated 0, and DNA synthesis is from left to right. Although the termination probabilities manifested by wild-type RT (upper panel) were nearly indiscriminate of the SO lesion, the replication profiles of the G262A and W266A mutants were strongly influenced by one or both of the styrene adducts. For example, when W266A replicated DNA containing the S-SO adduct, significantly elevated termination was observed 1, 3, and 4 nucleotides after bypass of the lesion (sites designated +1, +3, and +4, respectively). This termination was severalfold greater for the template containing the S-SO adduct than for the unadducted template or the template containing the R-SO lesion. Similar results were observed with G262A in which the major termination sites were +1 and +2 with the S-SO template. Much like the W266A mutant, translesion synthesis past the S-SO adduct by G262A induced more termination than replication past the R-SO lesion.“Vertical” Scan Mutants of Trp266 Differ Dramatically in Their Ability to Bypass R- and S-SO AdductsGiven the key role of Trp266 in RT-nucleic acid interactions several base pairs upstream of the polymerase active site, we examined whether this side chain can recognize changes in the DNA minor groove during replication past the SO adduct. To do this, we examined the ability of seven vertical scan mutants of residue 266, in addition to W266A, to bypass the SO adducts. Alternate side-chain substitutions included two aromatic (W266Y, W266F), three aliphatic (W266I, W266L, W266V), and two charged side chains (W266R, W266E). These mutants have been extensively studied and demonstrated to alter RT-nucleic acid interactions in a manner that indicates that Trp266contributes both van der Waals and hydrogen bonding interactions (16.Beard W.A.

We are therefore in a position to decipher whether translesional DNA synthesis also occurs in a manner consistent with altered interactions with residue 266.Primer extension by these mutants is shown in Fig.3 A. The termination pattern by the wild-type RT and two mutants with aromatic substitutions (W266F and W266Y) was similar, in that both mutants bypassed the SO adducts with termination probabilities comparable to the wild-type enzyme. Both W266F and W266Y, however, demonstrated a slight elevated termination probability at the +1 position after bypassing the S-SO (i.e. when the adduct is one base into the template-primer stem).Figure 3In vitro replication ofR- and S-SO adducted templates by mutants of Trp266. A, conditions were as in Fig. 2.

The amount of polymerase and time of DNA synthesis were as follows: wild-type, 12.5 fmol for 4 min (lanes 1–3); W266F, 12 fmol for 3 min (lanes 4–6); W266Y, 3 fmol for 3 min (lanes 7–9); W266I, 12 fmol for 3 min (lanes 10–12); W266L, 12 fmol for 3 min (lanes 13–15); W266V, 12 fmol for 3 min (lanes 16–18); W266A, 12.5 fmol for 1.5 min (lanes 19–21); W266R, 15.5 fmol for 3 min (lanes 22–24); W266E, 3 fmol for 3 min (lanes 25–27). The arrow indicates the position of the site of the template lesion. B, termination probabilities were calculated for a 10-nucleotide window around the adduct site, in which incorporation opposite the adduct is the 0 position.

The capacity to recruit large amounts of neutral lipids, triacylglycerols (TAG), and cholesterol esters is unique to apoB and is thought to be conferred by regions along its sequence that are enriched in amphipathic β-strands with a strong lipid-binding motif (4.Segrest J.P.

Acta. 1999; 1437: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In addition to lipidation, the folding of apoB also involves glycosylation and disulfide bond formation, all of which occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The ER lumen provides an optimal milieu for proper folding of proteins that enter the secretory pathway since (a) it provides oxidizing environment (27.Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar) necessary to support the formation of native disulfide bridges and (b) it contains folding catalysts and molecular chaperones which mediate the folding of nascent proteins. The oxidizing environment in the ER is maintained primarily by reduced and oxidized glutathione at 1:1–3:1 ratio ([GSH]/[GSSG]), respectively (27.Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). A recently identified protein, ERO1, seems to play a critical role in protein oxidation in the ER of eukaryotic cells (28.Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol.

The formation of native disulfides is catalyzed by protein-disulfide isomerase, a member of the thioredoxin superfamily (31.Luz J.M. Lennarz W.J. Exper. Suppl. (Basel). 1996; 77: 97-117PubMed Google Scholar), which functions both by introducing disulfides and by rearranging nonnative disulfides that form co-translationally (31.Luz J.M. Lennarz W.J. Exper. Suppl. (Basel). 1996; 77: 97-117PubMed Google Scholar). A number of other members of thioredoxin family have been identified in the ER (e.g. ERp72 and ERp57/ER60) (33.Mazzarella R.A. Srinivasan M. Haugejorden S.M. Green M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1094-1101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Hirano N. Shibasaki F. Sakai R. Tanaka T. Nishida J. Yazaki Y. Takenawa T. Hirai H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), however, their role in catalyzing disulfide bonding in vivo has not been established. The redox state in the ER can be manipulated in vivo by low levels of the reducing agent, dithiothreitol (DTT), which rapidly equilibrates across membranes to alter the redox state of the ER, thereby abrogating the formation of disulfide bonds, leading to the retention of reduced proteins in the ER (35.Braakman I.

This manipulation has the following advantages: (a) the secretory pathway remains unperturbed, (b) the inhibitory effects are fully reversible upon removal of DTT, and (c) fully or correctly folded proteins are not affected (35.Braakman I.

Chem. 1997; 272: 10279-10286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) were demonstrated to be sensitive to DTT reduction which led to their failure to fold into their mature form and as a result, their secretion was blocked. These findings suggested that disulfide bonds are critical for the folding of apoB. However, while apoB-28 could fold and be secreted following removal of DTT (42.Ingram M.F. Shelness G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10279-10286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), apoB-100 was incapable of refolding and instead, was rapidly degraded (40.Shelness G.S. Thornburg J.T. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 408-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Macri J. Adeli K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2982-2994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), making it impossible to isolate folding intermediates in the maturation of apoB-100 for further characterization. On the other hand, important information has been derived from studies using apoB-28 as a model for early folding events of apoB (42.Ingram M.F. Shelness G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10279-10286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, at least 37% of apoB is required for the formation of TAG-rich lipoproteins (7.Linton M.F. Farese Jr., R.V. Young S.G. J. Lipid. Res. 1993; 34: 521-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we extended these studies to include apoB-41, apoB-29, and apoB-17 which have different requirements for lipidation representing different stages in the maturation of apoB. ApoB-17 has 6 disulfides, while both apoB-29 and apoB-41 have 7 of the 8 disulfides in apoB-100 (43.Yang C.Y. Kim T.W. Weng S.A. Lee B.R. Yang M.L. Gotto Jr., A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 1990: 5523-5527Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These apoB forms were expressed by stably transfected mammary-derived C127 cells. These cells are unique since they do not express MTP, yet secrete apoB-41 exclusively on high density lipoprotein-like particles containing a TAG-rich core (44.Herscovitz H. Kritis A. Talianidis I. Zanni E. Zannis V. Small D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 659-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In contrast, apoB-17 is secreted primarily lipid-poor (15.Herscovitz H. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Walsh M.T. Cladaras C. Zannis V.I. Small D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7313-7317Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) while apoB-29 is secreted either lipid-free or associated with mostly polar lipids.2 We show that these apoB forms are sensitive to DTT regardless of their lipidation state, and that the inhibitory effects of DTT on their secretion are fully reversible. Therefore, these cells provide a unique model system in which folding intermediates during different stages of maturation can be isolated to study the details of the folding pathway of apoB, including lipidation and characterization of cellular factors that mediate folding, such as molecular chaperones and folding catalysts.

Cells were then pulse-labeled with 150 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine with or without 4 mmDTT for the indicated times, and then chased in DMEM supplemented with 3 mm each methionine and cysteine and 10 μmcycloheximide to stop further protein synthesis, with or without 4 mm DTT. Cells and media were harvested as described below. At the conclusion of the pulse or the chase cells were washed in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated for 10 min with 50 mmiodoacetamide in phosphate-buffered saline to alkylate free sulfhydryls, and prevent random formation of disulfides. Cells were then washed and lysed for 30 min on ice in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (lysis buffer) containing 0.05% NaN3 and protease inhibitors: 10 μg/ml each, aprotinin, and leupeptin, 0.1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzylsulfonyl fluoride and 5 μg/ml ALLN. Post-nuclear lysates were adjusted to 5 mg/ml albumin and 5 mm EDTA. Media collected after the chase were spun at 800 × g for 15 min to remove cellular debris, adjusted to 5 mg/ml albumin, 0.05% NaN3, and 5 mm EDTA and then concentrated about 10-fold by Centricon microconcentrators. Concentrated media were adjusted to 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm EDTA and protease inhibitors as described above. Media and post-nuclear lysates were precleared by incubation with non-immune goat serum, gelatin- and Protein G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. ApoB was immunoprecipitated from cleared supernatants by incubation with polyclonal antibodies to apoB overnight. Immunocomplexes were then captured on Protein G-Sepharose, washed in lysis buffer followed by phosphate-buffered saline, and solubilized in sample buffer (45.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207165) Google Scholar) containing 8 m urea. Proteins were resolved by 7% SDS-PAGE (45.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207165) Google Scholar), followed by autoradiography using a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics). ApoB was quantified using “Imagequant ”software and normalized to cell protein (46.Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5328) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was performed using a software package RS/1 (BBN Research Systems). The formation of disulfide bonds often results in the generation of more compact intermediates that can be distinguished from reduced forms by their faster migration on non-reducing SDS-PAGE. However, since apoB is a large protein and most of its disulfides are formed between adjacent cysteines, the shift in the migration of the disulfide-bonded form compared with its reduced form is virtually undetectable. Since 7 out of 8 disulfides occur in the first 21% of apoB the difference in migration between reduced and oxidized forms is easily observed in the shorter forms of apoB. Therefore, we chose apoB-17, which contains 6 disulfides, to determine the rate of the formation of disulfide bridges. Cells were pretreated with puromycin to synchronize the translating ribosomes, and then pulse-labeled for the indicated times, treated with iodoacetamide and lysed. ApoB-17 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and analyzed on nonreducing gels. Fig.1 shows that full-length apoB-17 was detected within 4 min after the beginning of the pulse (lane 3). Furthermore, nascent apoB-17 even at its earliest appearance migrated faster than its reduced counterpart (compare lane 3 to lane 1), and its mobility did not change with time (lanes 3–10), indicating that most if not all the native disulfides were formed either co- or immediately posttranslationally. To determine whether the formation of native disulfides is critical for folding and secretion of apoB we used DTT, to prevent the formation of disulfides by changing the redox state in the ER (35.Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). First, it was necessary to ensure that exposure to DTT does not perturb the secretory pathway in C127 cells. To that end we studied the effects of 2 or 4 mm DTT on the secretion of apoA-I which lacks disulfide bonds. C127 cells transfected to express and secrete apoA-I (47.Herscovitz H. Gantz D. Tercyak A.M. Zannis V.I. Small D.M. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were pulse-labeled for 4 min with or without 2 or 4 mm DTT, and then chased for 2 h in the presence or absence of the corresponding concentration of DTT. Such experiments showed that the amount of labeled apoA-I secreted into the medium following incubation with DTT was indistinguishable from the corresponding controls (data not shown). Thus, the secretory pathway in C127 cells is not perturbed by either 2 or 4 mm DTT. Next, we determined the effects of 4 mm DTT on the secretion of apoB-17 (15.Herscovitz H. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Walsh M.T. Cladaras C. Zannis V.I. Small D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7313-7317Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cells were pulse (4 min)-chased (2 h) with or without DTT. Under control conditions (−DTT), about 60% of the labeled pool of apoB-17 was secreted following a 2-h chase (Fig.2 A). However, inclusion of 4 mm DTT in the pulse and chase media blocked its secretion, as less than 1% of control levels accumulated in the media (p = 0.0001). Likewise, the secretion of apoB-17 was significantly reduced (p = 0.0001) when cells were pulsed in media lacking DTT, and chased in the presence of DTT (Fig.2 A). Thus, the inhibitory effects of DTT on the secretion of apoB-17 can be exerted both co- or immediately post-translationally. Under control conditions (−DTT), almost no apoB-17 was degraded, as over 95% of labeled apoB-17 was recovered. In contrast, a fraction of the reduced pool of apoB-17, 30 and 40%, was degraded following a 2-h chase in the presence of DTT after a pulse either with or without DTT, respectively. Nonetheless, the majority, about 60 and 70% of newly synthesized apoB-17 was still present in the cells by the end of the 2-h chase, suggesting that the reduced pool was fairly stable. Next, we designed experiments to determine if the inhibitory effects of DTT on the secretion of apoB-17 could be reversed, i.e.whether the reduced, misfolded protein can be rescued. As depicted in Fig. 2 A, the secretion of apoB-17 synthesized in the presence of DTT and then chased in media lacking DTT was comparable to control levels. Thus, the inhibitory effects of DTT on the secretion of apoB-17 were fully reversible, and reduced apoB-17 could be rescued. Furthermore, the formation of native disulfide bonds can occur both co- or post-translationally. The migration of cellular nascent apoB-17 on non-reducing gels was analyzed to confirm that the inhibitory effects of DTT on the secretion of apoB-17 were due to perturbation of disulfide bond formation. Fig.2 B shows that apoB-17 synthesized in media lacking DTT migrated faster than the form synthesized in the presence of DTT (compare lanes 1 and 2 to lanes 3 and4). Thus, under oxidizing conditions disulfide bonds were formed co-translationally consistent with the data shown in Fig. 1. After a 2-h chase in the presence of DTT either following a pulse with DTT (lane 7) or without DTT (lane 9), apoB-17 migrated as a reduced form. In contrast, apoB-17 synthesized in the presence of DTT, but chased in media lacking DTT, migrated as a more compact form (lane 8) consistent with the formation of disulfide bonds post-translationally, and its subsequent secretion into the media (Fig. 2 A). Since the migration of apoB-17 overall correlated with its presumed oxidation state, we conclude that DTT inhibited the secretion of apoB-17 by preventing the formation of native disulfide bridges. To estimate the rate of post-translational disulfide bonding we examined the migration of apoB-17 on nonreducing gels. Cells were pulse-labeled for 4 min in the presence of 4 mm DTT, and then washed and chased for up to 20 min in medium lacking DTT. Within 5 min of chase most of the native disulfides already formed, but full formation took up to 15 min (data not shown). These data suggest that post-translational formation of disulfide bonds after removing DTT occurred rather quickly but not as rapid as co-translational disulfide bonding. Next, apoB-29, which contains 7 of the 8 disulfides in apoB-100 (43.Yang C.Y. Kim T.W. Weng S.A. Lee B.R. Yang M.L. Gotto Jr., A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 1990: 5523-5527Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar) was analyzed. Although a small fraction is secreted lipid-poor, the majority of the secreted pool of apoB-29 is associated with particles containing about 26% lipids (by weight), most of which are polar lipids such as phospholipids (PL) and diacylglycerols.2 As depicted in Fig.3 about 35% of the labeled pool was secreted by 2 h, and about 80% of the pool synthesized during the pulse was recovered at the end of the chase. Like apoB-17, DTT blocked the secretion of apoB-29 both co- and post-translationally (p = 0.0001). Furthermore, it was rescued by removing DTT from the chase, so that it could undergo post-translational disulfide bonding and subsequent maturation into its secretion-competent form. Reduced apoB-29 like apoB-17 was relatively stable, as about 60% was recovered after a 2-h chase in media containing DTT. ApoB-41 like apoB-29 contains 7 disulfides (43.Yang C.Y. Kim T.W. Weng S.A. Lee B.R. Yang M.L. Gotto Jr., A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 1990: 5523-5527Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Unlike apoB-17 or apoB-29, it absolutely requires lipids, both TAG and PL, for its folding and is secreted exclusively on large high density lipoprotein-like lipoproteins containing a TAG-rich core (44.Herscovitz H. Kritis A. Talianidis I. Zanni E. Zannis V. Small D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 659-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 4, only about 17% of apoB-41 pool synthesized during the pulse was secreted by 2-h of chase, presumably due to insufficient lipids (primarily TAG) available to form TAG-rich lipoproteins. Furthermore, unlike apoB-17 and apoB-29, only 70% of the pool of apoB-41 synthesized during the pulse was recovered after a 2-h chase, indicating that about 30% was degraded. Despite the differences between apoB-41 and the shorter forms of apoB in their dependence on lipidation, the effects of DTT on the secretion of apoB-41 were very similar to those observed for both apoB-17 and apoB-29. Thus, the secretion of apoB-41 was blocked by DTT when added either co- or post-translationally (p = 0.0001), and its inhibitory effects on the secretion of apoB-41 were fully reversible if DTT was removed from the chase medium (Fig. 4). The amount of apoB-41 recovered by the end of the chase in the presence of DTT was similar to control levels, indicating that reduced apoB-41 did not exhibit increased propensity to degradation compared with controls. The slight increase in the recovery of apoB-41 following addition of DTT into the chase supports the presumed DTT-sensitive protease in the secretory pathway (48.Wu X. Sakata N. Lele K.M. Zhou M. Jiang H. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11575-11580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). DTT at relatively low concentrations reduces disulfide bonds during early stages of folding since they are accessible to the surrounding milieu. However, as folding progresses, disulfide bonds become inaccessible to reduction and the protein is expected to complete its folding and be secreted. The experiments depicted in Figs.Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 demonstrated that the addition of DTT immediately post-translationally was still effective in preventing the folding of apoB into a secretio"

(2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 5270–5274). In this study, each amino acid from Asn-2 to Gly-44 in the putative TM1 and loop1–2 regions or that from Ser-328 to Gly-366 in TM11 and its flanking regions was individually replaced with cysteine. With respect to the TM1 region, 10 mutants, from T5C to L14C, were all not reactive withN-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and from D15C to I22C, NEM-reactive and non-reactive mutations periodically appeared every two residues. Three mutants, M23C to V25C, were all NEM-reactive, but the degree of the latter two mutants was very low. Seven mutants, from L26C to E32C, were all highly reactive with NEM. Therefore, the region of TM1 is composed of the 21 amino acid residues from Thr-5 to Val-25. It is a partially amphiphilic helix, that is, the N-terminal (cytoplasmic) half is embedded in the hydrophobic interior, and the C-terminal (periplasmic) half faces a water-filled channel. With respect to TM11, nine mutants, from S328C to G336C, and six mutants, from L361C to G366C, were all reactive with NEM. On the other hand, out of the 24 mutants, from L337C to S360C, 17 were not reactive with NEM, and the 7 NEM-reactive mutants were scattered, indicating that this region is a transmembrane segment. The 7 residues from Val-347 to Phe-353 including Pro-350 formed a central hydrophobic core, and the 7 NEM-reactive mutations were periodically distributed in its flanking regions, indicating that both ends of TM11 face a water-filled channel. Ala-354 is located at about 1/3 of the length from the periplasmic end of TM11. Disulfide cross-linking experiments on double-cysteine mutants having the combination of A354C and a cysteine-scanning mutation in the loop1–2 region indicated that loop1–2 is very flexible and close to the periplasmic end of TM11. Tetracycline prevented the cross-linking formation between the periplasmic ends of TM1 and TM11; however, it did not affect the cross-linking between loop1–2 and TM11, indicating that the substrate-induced conformational change involves a shift in the relative locations of TM1 and TM11. Putative transmembrane helices (TM) 1 and 11 in the metal-tetracycline/H+ antiporter are predicted to be close to each other on the basis of disulfide cross-linking experiments of the double-cysteine mutants in the periplasmic loop regions (Kubo, Y., Konishi, S., Kawabe, T., Nada, S., and Yamaguchi, A.

The 7 residues from Val-347 to Phe-353 including Pro-350 formed a central hydrophobic core, and the 7 NEM-reactive mutations were periodically distributed in its flanking regions, indicating that both ends of TM11 face a water-filled channel. Ala-354 is located at about 1/3 of the length from the periplasmic end of TM11. Disulfide cross-linking experiments on double-cysteine mutants having the combination of A354C and a cysteine-scanning mutation in the loop1–2 region indicated that loop1–2 is very flexible and close to the periplasmic end of TM11. Tetracycline prevented the cross-linking formation between the periplasmic ends of TM1 and TM11; however, it did not affect the cross-linking between loop1–2 and TM11, indicating that the substrate-induced conformational change involves a shift in the relative locations of TM1 and TM11. N-ethylmaleimide transmembrane 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2–2′-disulfonic acid The transposon Tn10-encoded metal-tetracycline/H+antiporter TetA(B) (2.McMurry L. Petrucci Jr., R.E. Levy S.E.

Chem. 1990; 265: 4809-4813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has been studied as a paradigm of antiporters belonging to a major facilitator superfamily (MFS). Its 12-membrane-spanning structure was at first determined on the basis of the results of hydropathy analysis and limited protease digestion (4.Eckert B. Beck C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11663-11670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Afterward, the 12-membrane-spanning structure of TetA(C), which is a homolog of TetA(B) encoded by pBR322, was confirmed by a PhoA fusion experiment (5.Allard J.D. Bertrand K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17809-17819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We finally established the topology of TetA(B) by means of site-directed competitive chemical modification of cysteine-introduced mutants, in which a cysteine residue was introduced into each putative loop region of the cysteine-free TetA(B), with membrane-permeable and -impermeable maleimide derivatives using whole mutant TetA(B) proteins retaining normal transport activity (6.Kimura T. Ohnuma M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 580-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of the difference in reactivity between SH groups in hydrophilic and hydrophobic environments withN-ethylmaleimide (NEM),1 the detailed boundaries between transmembrane segments and medium-exposed loop regions were determined in putative transmembrane segments (TM) 9 (7.Kimura T.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). TM3, 6, and 9 were totally embedded in the hydrophobic interior of the membrane, and thus, none of the cysteine-scanning mutants in these transmembrane regions were reactive with NEM (7.Kimura T. Suzuki M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15896-15899Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 8.Kimura T. Shiina Y. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A similar SH-reagent non-reactive nature of cysteine-scanning mutants of transmembrane segments has also been reported for an erythrocyte anion exchanger (11.Tang X-B. Fujinaga J. Kopito R. Casey J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22545-22553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and Escherichia coli multidrug exporter EmrE (12.Mordoch S.S. Granot D. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19480-19486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). On the other hand, TM2 is amphiphilic, that is, one side of its helix faces a water-filled transmembrane channel (9.Kimura-Someya T. Iwaki S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32806-32811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Very recently, we found that TM5 also comprises amphiphilic helices facing a water-filled channel and that the water-filled channel has a permeability barrier for solutes in the middle of the membrane (13.Iwaki S. Tamura N. Kimura-Someya T. Nada S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275 (in press)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Second-site suppressor mutation studies reveal that both the cytoplasmic and periplasmic ends of putative TM1 and TM11 are conformationally linked to each other (14.Kawabe T. Yamaguchi A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Cross-linking experiments on disulfide mutants in which two cysteine residues were introduced into any two putative periplasmic loop regions of TetA(B) confirmed that the periplasmic ends of TM1 and 11 are close to each other (1.Kubo Y. Konishi S. Kawabe T. Nada S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5270-5274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In this study, in order to determine the precise boundaries of TM1 and TM11 and the detailed spatial relationship between loop1–2 and TM11, cysteine-scanning mutants were constructed as to TM1 and TM11 and their flanking regions (Fig. 1). As a result, the boundaries of TM1 and TM11 were changed from the originally estimated ones on the basis of the hydropathy profile. Leu-30 and Ala-354, which had been estimated to be located at the periplasmic ends of TM1 and TM11, respectively (14.Kawabe T. Yamaguchi A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), were revealed to be located at about the N-terminal half of loop1–2 and in the transmembrane region of TM11, respectively. Loop1–2 seems to protrude into a water-filled channel and to be close to TM11. N-[ethyl-1-14C]Maleimide (NEM) (1.5 GBq/mmol) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. All other materials were of reagent grade and obtained from commercial sources. Cysteine-scanning mutants were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis according to the method of Kunkel (15.Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar) using synthetic oligonucleotides. For the mutagenesis, plasmid pCTC377A (7.Kimura T. Suzuki M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15896-15899Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which carries the 2.45-kilobase Cys-less Tn10 tetA andtetR gene fragments, was used as a template. All of the mutations were detected as the appearance of a newly introduced restriction site and then verified by DNA sequencing in the region of the restriction fragments, which had been transferred to low copy number plasmids. Low copy number mutant plasmids were constructed through the exchange of BglII-EcoRV fragments (TM1) orEcoRI-BamHI fragments (TM11) of the Cys mutants with the corresponding fragments of the low copy number plasmid, pLGC377A, which encodes a cysteine-less mutant of TetA(B) (7.Kimura T. Suzuki M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15896-15899Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and then used for tetA(B) gene expression. Tetracycline resistance was determined by means of a 2-fold agar dilution method as described previously (16.Yamaguchi A. Ono N. Akasaka T. Noumi T. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15525-15530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and expressed as the minimum inhibitory concentration. The [14C]NEM binding experiment was performed using sonicated membranes prepared from E. coli W3104 cells carrying one of the derivatives of pLGC377A as described previously (17.Yamaguchi A. Someya Y. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19155-19162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After solubilization and immunoprecipitation with anti-TetA(B) C-terminal antiserum (18.Yamaguchi A. Adachi K. Sawai T. FEBS Lett. 1990; 165: 17-19Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and PansorbinStaphylococcus aureus cells (19.Philipson L. Anderson P. Olshevsky U. Weinberg R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1978; 13: 189-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) followed by SDS gel electrophoresis, the protein bands and the radioactive bands were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and with a BAS-1000 Bio-Imaging Analyser (Fuji Film Co., Ltd., Tokyo), respectively. Prevention of [14C]NEM binding by AMS was measured in intact cells as described previously (6.Kimura T. Ohnuma M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 580-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Double-Cys mutants were constructed by the recombination of a BglII-EcoRI fragment of each single-Cys mutant gene in TM1 or the loop1–2 region with the corresponding fragment of the A354C mutant gene in the low copy number plasmid. The resulting mutants were confirmed by restriction analysis using restriction sites introduced to site-directed Cys mutagenesis sites through a silent mutation. Disulfide cross-linking was detected as a mobility shift on SDS gel electrophoresis after oxidation with Cu2+/o-phenanthroline, as described previously (1.Kubo Y. Konishi S. Kawabe T. Nada S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5270-5274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As a control, the sulfhydryl groups of the double-Cys mutants were masked by preincubation with excess NEM before the cross-linking reaction. The S4C (6.Kimura T. Ohnuma M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 580-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), R31C to G44C (9.Kimura-Someya T. Iwaki S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 580-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) mutants were constructed previously. The other 59 mutants were constructed in this study. With respect to TM1 and the loop1–2 region, no mutants completely lost the tetracycline resistance (Table I). Asp-15 is one of three transmembrane-conserved acidic residues, and its mutation to Asn drastically reduced the resistance (21.Yamaguchi A. Akasaka T. Ono N. Someya Y. Nakatani M. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7490-7498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, the D15C mutant retained the wild-type resistance level. Only two mutants, P24C and G44C, exhibited largely reduced resistance (6.3 and 12.5 μg/ml, respectively). The reduction of the resistance of these mutants is probably due to structural distortion. In addition, G18C, G20C, and D38C exhibited moderate resistance (50 μg/ml). The other 38 mutants retained wild-type resistance. On the other hand, in the case of TM11 and its flanking regions, G336C completely lost the drug resistance (Table II). Five mutants, G332C, Q335C, G346C, P350C, and Y357C, exhibited very low resistance ranging between 3.1 and 12.5 μg/ml. Six other mutants, V339C, S340C, V347C, I363C, W364C, and G366C, showed moderate resistance (50 μg/ml).Table ITetracycline resistance levels of E. coli W3104 cells harboring plasmids encoding each cycteine-scanning mutant as to putative TM1 and its flanking regions of TetA(B)MutantMICMutantMIC(μg/ml)(μg/ml)Host cell1.6M23C200pLGT2 (wild type)200P24C6.3N2C100V25C200S3C200L26C200S4C200P27C100T5C100T28C200K6C100L29C20017C100L30C200A8C200R31C200L9C200E32C200V10C200F33C200I11C200I34C200T12CC200A35C200L13C200S36C200T14C200E37C200D15C200D38C50A16C100I39C200M17C200A40C100G18C50N41C100I19C200H42C100G20C50F43C100L21C200G44C12.5I22C200The resistance levels are indicated as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of tetracycline determined by the agar-dilution method.

On the basis of the hydropathy profile, TM1 was predicted to extend over 24 amino acid residues from Ile-7 to Leu-30 (4.Eckert B. Beck C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11663-11670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Afterward, we slightly changed the length of TM1 from Ile-7 to Thr-28 because we found that the L29C and L30C mutants were highly reactive with NEM (20.Kimura T. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6941-6946Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the NEM binding ability of 43 cysteine-scanning mutants, from N2C to G44C, in sonicated membrane vesicles (Fig. 2). There were no significant differences in the expression levels of these mutants (Fig. 2, upper panels). As shown in Fig. 2(lower panels), K6C unexpectedly showed no reactivity with NEM and the T5C mutant. Thus, TM1 at the N-terminal end seems to start from Thr-5 instead of Ile-7. With respect to the C-terminal end of TM1, mutants M26C to T28C were all highly reactive with NEM. Therefore, it does not seem likely that Leu-29 is located at the boundary between TM1 and loop1–2. The region of TM1 is composed of 21 amino acid residues, from Thr-5 to Val-25. Regarding this region, three mutants, A16C, I19C, and M23C, were highly reactive with NEM. The G20C and P24C mutants were moderately reactive. The D15C and V25C showed low but significant reactivity with NEM. These residues are all located in the C-terminal half of TM1, indicating that only the C-terminal (periplasmic) half of TM1 may face a water-filled channel. Although NEM-reactive mutations occur every two residues from D15C to I22C, the terminal three mutations, M23C, P24C and V25C, were all reactive with NEM in greater or less degree, probably indicating that the terminal end of TM1 may protrude to the medium. With respect to the putative loop1–2 region, out of 19 mutants, M26C to G44C, 14 showed high reactivity with NEM. Only five mutants, F33C, I34C, E37C, I39C, and N41C, were low reactive or not reactive with NEM, the direction of the side chains at these positions probably being inaccessible to NEM. It is of interest that the NEM-non-reactive positions were only in the downstream half of the putative loop1–2 region, probably reflecting some conformational difference between the upstream and downstream halves of this region. On the basis of the hydropathy profile, TM11 was estimated to extend over 24 amino acid residues, from Ala-333 to Ile-356 (20.Kimura T. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6941-6946Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Afterward, we slightly changed the boundary of TM11 from Ala-333 to Phe-353 because we found that the Ala-354 mutant was highly reactive with NEM (14.Kawabe T. Yamaguchi A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In this study, 39 cysteine-scanning mutants, Ser-328 to Gly-366, were analyzed. There were no significant differences in the expression levels of these mutants except for the P350C mutant, of which expression level was very low but certainly expressed (Fig. 3,upper panels). Among them, the mutants upstream from G336C and those downstream from L361C showed high reactivity with NEM (Fig.3, lower panels). The NEM-non-reactive 17 mutants were clustered between L337C and S360C, indicating that the TM11 region comprises the 24 amino acid residues between Leu-337 and Ser-360. Seven mutants, V347C to F353C, exhibited no NEM reactivity, this region being the hydrophobic core of TM11. NEM-reactive mutations were periodically observed about every two residues at both ends of TM11. In an Edmandson wheel projection of TM11 (Fig. 4), NEM-reactive mutants at the upstream (Fig. 4 B, inner ring) and downstream (Fig. 4 B, outer ring) ends of TM11 were located on the same side of the wheel. Considering the delay of the helix pitch at Pro-350 (22.Sansom M.S.P. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the NEM-reactive sides at both ends were consistent with each other (Fig. 4), indicating that both ends of TM11 face a water-filled channel on the same side. The central one-turn of the helix was embedded in the hydrophobic interior, suggesting that the central region may be pushed outward by helix bending due to the presence of a proline (Pro-350).Figure 4Helical wheel projection of the downstream half of putative TM1 (A) and the whole putative TM11 region (B). The residues with which cysteine mutants exhibited high or moderate reactivity with NEM are depicted asreverse type. The pale gray background indicates the low reactive positions.

Each ring is rotated counterclockwise by a factor of 20° against its inside neighbor ring, reflecting the delay of the helical pitch due to Pro-350.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify the channel break point in TM1 and TM11, which is necessary to avoid uncoupling, the prevention of [14C]NEM binding by a membrane-impermeable maleimide derivative, AMS, in intact cells was investigated. TM1 is a partially amphiphilic helix, i.e.only the periplasmic half faces a channel. To our surprise, the A16C and I19C mutants were not accessible from the periplasmic side to AMS (Fig. 5 A), despite these positions being located in the periplasmic half of TM1. G20C was hardly reactive with NEM in intact cells, and NEM binding to M23C was prevented by AMS. Thus, the permeability barrier is present between Ile-19 and Met-23. With respect to TM11, the NEM binding to Cys mutants downstream from A354C was prevented by AMS, whereas the binding to ones upstream from G346C was not affected by AMS in intact cells. Thus, the permeability barrier is present between Gly-346 and Ala-354, this region being the central hydrophobic core of TM11. To reveal the proximity of TM1 and TM11 and to investigate the spacial relationship between loop1–2 and TM11, we constructed 22 double Cys mutants containing the A354C mutation and a Cys mutation at each of the loop1–2 residues starting from M23C, and disulfide cross-linking under oxidized conditions was detected as a mobility shift on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.6). Surprisingly, mobility-shift bands (30 kDa) under oxidized conditions were observed for most of these double-Cys mutants. When the SH groups of these mutants were masked with NEM before oxidation (NEM+, negative control), the band shifts were not observed. Therefore, the 30-kDa bands clearly indicated intermolecular disulfide cross-linking. The M23C/A354C mutant gave a 30-kDa band, but the amount was smaller than that of the 34-kDa band. In addition, it gave an unidentified 33-kDa minor band. On the other hand, the P24C/A354C mutant exhibited no cross-linking, and the V25C/A354C mutant exhibited a very low degree of cross-linking. In contrast, the L26C/A354C mutant exhibited a high degree of cross-linking formation (30 kDa/34 kDa band density ratio, about 2). Therefore, the TM1 helical structure seems to extend to Leu-26, in which four residues, Met-23 to Leu-26, may extrude to the periplasmic medium. The Met-23 and Leu-26 side of TM1 faces Ala-354, whereas Pro-24 and Val-25 are probably present on the opposite side of this helix. The remaining 18 double-Cys mutants exhibited high or moderate cross-linking, indicating that these residues comprise a flexible loop structure accessible to Cys-354. Among them, the double-Cys mutants involving A35C, S36C, and E37C each gave a significant 64-kDa band, corresponding to dimerization through intermolecular cross-linking. The mutants involving D38C, I39C, and A40C also exhibited weak dimerization. These six residues are probably located at the periphery of the loop structure. It may be surprising that SH groups introduced to these positions can simultaneously gain access to Cys-354 in the TM11 region in addition to those in the next molecule, probably reflecting the flexibility of loop1–2. The I34C, E37C, and I39C mutants efficiently formed cross-linking with A354C despite their low reactivity with NEM. To provide insight as to whether a substrate-induced conformational change involves a shift in the relative locations of TM1, loop1–2, and TM11, we investigated the effect of tetracycline on the disulfide cross-linking formation of some double-Cys mutants. As shown in Fig. 7, the cross-linking formation of the M23C/A354C mutant was completely prevented by tetracycline, whereas those of the L30C/A354C and G44C/A354C mutants were not affected. These results suggest that tetracycline caused the increase in the distance between the periplasmic ends of TM1 and TM11 or the alteration of the relative orientation of these transmembrane segments. It is interesting that the M23C/A354C mutant exhibited a 64-kDa dimer band due to the intermolecular cross-linking when it was oxidized in the presence of tetracycline (Fig. 7). Since the other two double-Cys mutants involving the A354C mutation showed no dimer band, M23C was responsible for the tetracycline-induced intermolecular cross-linking, indicating a possibility that the side chain at position 23 became oriented to periphery of the helix bundle by substrate-induced conformational change. The results of this study are schematically summarized in Fig.8. TM1 comprises 21 residues, Thr-5 to Val-25, in which three residues, Met-23 to Val-25, may protrude to the periplasmic medium, and TM11 comprises 24 residues, Leu-337 to Ser-360. NEM-reactive Cys mutations of TM1 periodically occur only in the periplasmic half of this helix, indicating that only the periplasmic half of TM1 faces a water-filled channel. On the other hand, NEM-reactive mutations of TM11 periodically occur over the whole length except for the central hydrophobic core. Pro-350 is located in the middle of the core. Thus, TM11 seems to bend at Pro-350, and the central part may project into the hydrophobic interior. The break in the water-filled channel is located close to the periplasmic end of TM1. On the other hand, it is located in the central hydrophobic core of TM11. We observed that the permeability barrier is located in the middle of the membrane in TM5.2 There are two possibilities for the reason why the permeability barrier is located close to the periplasmic end of TM1, as follows. 1) The cytoplasmic portion of the water channel extends along TM1, or 2) the length of TM1 at the periplasmic end may be underestimated. On the basis of the current results, TM2 is close to TM11, similar to or rather than TM1 because G44C and F43C, which are located at the periplasmic end of TM2 (9.Kimura-Someya T. Iwaki S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32806-32811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), were more efficiently cross-linked with A354C than M23C. TM2 also faces a water-filled channel along its whole length (9.Kimura-Someya T. Iwaki S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32806-32811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, the channel wall is mainly composed of TM2 (9.Kimura-Someya T. Iwaki S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32806-32811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), TM5,2 and TM11. Another channel wall constituent candidate is TM8, which contains His-257 (23.Yamaguchi A. Samejima T. Kimura T. Sawai T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4359-4364Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Now we are analyzing cysteine-scanning mutants of TM8. TM1 seems to partly face the channel. Loop1–2 is located at the exit of the channel and, thus, forms a conformational-sensitive domain (14.Kawabe T. Yamaguchi A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Kaback et al. (24.Kaback H.R. Voss J. Wu J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and Goswitz and Brooker (25.Goswitz V.C. Brooker R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) independently present a model of the helix arrangement of lactose permease, based on the results of cross-linking experiments and second-site suppressor mutation, respectively. Although the helix arrangements of lactose permease in their models are greatly different from each other, TM11 is placed next to TM2 in both models (24.Kaback H.R. Voss J. Wu J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 25.Goswitz V.C. Brooker R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the model of Goswitz and Brooker (25.Goswitz V.C. Brooker R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), TM1 is placed across the substrate translocation channel from TM11. If cross-linking does occur across the channel, our result is very similar to their model, suggesting the structural similarity between major facilitator superfamily-type symporters and antiporters. The cross-linking formation between the periplasmic ends of TM1 and TM11 was prevented by tetracycline; however, those between TM2 and TM11 and between loop1–2 and TM11 were not affected. These observations also supported the idea that the substrate translocation channel is located between TM1 and TM11, and the periplasmic end of TM1 may be related to the substrate-induced gating function."
https://openalex.org/W2012755097,"As defined by hydropathy analysis, the membrane-spanning segments of the yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase contain seven negatively charged amino acids (Asp and Glu) and four positively charged amino acids (Arg and His). To explore the functional role of these residues, site-directed mutants at all 11 positions and at Glu-288, located near the cytoplasmic end of M3, have been constructed and expressed in yeast secretory vesicles. Substitutions at four of the positions (Glu-129, Glu-288, Asp-833, and Arg-857) had no significant effect on ATP hydrolysis or ATP-dependent proton pumping, substitutions at five additional positions (Arg-695, His-701, Asp-730, Asp-739, and Arg-811) led to misfolding of the ATPase and blockage at an early stage of biogenesis, and substitutions of Asp-143 allowed measurable biogenesis but nearly abolished ATP hydrolysis and proton transport. Of greatest interest were mutations of Glu-703 in M5 and Glu-803 in M8, which altered the apparent coupling between hydrolysis and transport. Three Glu-703 mutants (E703Q, E703L, E703D) showed significantly reduced pumping over a wide range of hydrolysis values and thus appeared to be partially uncoupled. At Glu-803, by contrast, one mutant (E803N) was almost completely uncoupled, while another (E803Q) pumped protons at an enhanced rate relative to the rate of ATP hydrolysis. Both Glu-703 and Glu-803 occupy positions at which amino acid substitutions have been shown to affect transport by mammalian P-ATPases. Taken together, the results provide growing evidence that residues in membrane segments 5 and 8 of the P-ATPases contribute to the cation transport pathway and that the fundamental mechanism of transport has been conserved throughout the group.

Kielland-Brandt M.C. Fink G.R. Nature. 1986; 319: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), belongs to the large and physiologically versatile family of P-type ATPases found throughout prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells (2.Fagan M.J. Saier M.H. J. Mol. Evol. 1994; 38: 57-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 3.Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H.

Members of this family transport at least 10 different cations (H+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Hg2+, Pb2+) with stoichiometries ranging from 1H+/ATP in Neurospora crassa (5.Warncke J. Slayman C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 591: 224-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 6.Slayman C.L. Zuckier G.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Thus, there is a strong incentive to map the transport pathways in representative P-ATPases and to identify the molecular determinants of cation specificity and stoichiometry. Structurally, the P-ATPases share a common topology in which a central catalytic domain is flanked by hydrophobic segments that serve to embed the protein in the lipid bilayer. For the P2 subfamily, including the fungal and plant plasma membrane H+-ATPases as well as mammalian Na+, K+-, H+-, K+-, and Ca2+-ATPases, hydropathy analysis predicts four transmembrane segments at the N-terminal end of the molecule and six at the C-terminal end (3.Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-1561328Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). This model has recently been supported by 8-Å maps of the NeurosporaH+-ATPase (10.Auer M. Scarborough G.A. Kuhlbrandt W. Nature. 1998; 392: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (11.Zhang P. Toyoshima C. Yonekura K. Green N.M. Stokes D. Nature. 1998; 392: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), obtained by cryoelectron microscopy. Unlike the central hydrophilic domain, which contains well conserved sequences for ATP binding and formation of the β-aspartyl phosphate reaction intermediate, the transmembrane segments show little amino acid sequence conservation. Only M4 and, to a lesser extent, M5 and M6 contain residues that have remained relatively constant throughout prokaryotic and eukaryotic evolution (12.Green N.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 671: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, there are ample structural differences in the membrane-embedded portion of the P-ATPases that may underlie the known differences in transport properties. In the work to be described below, we have studied the functional role of charged residues within the 10 transmembrane segments of the yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase. Multiple substitutions were made at each of these positions by site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting ATPases were then expressed in yeast secretory vesicles (13.Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and examined for the ability to undergo proper biogenesis, hydrolyze ATP, and pump protons. Nearly half of the mutant ATPases proved to be misfolded, as judged by limited trypsinolysis, and were arrested at an early point in the secretory pathway. Of the remainder, many were functionally normal, but mutants of Glu-703 in membrane segment 5 and Glu-803 in membrane segment 8 displayed apparent alterations in the coupling between ATP hydrolysis and H+ pumping. As described below, these two residues are conserved in other P-ATPases, where mutational evidence also suggests a role in the cation transport pathway. Both the Amersham kit for oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom) and the polymerase chain reaction (14.Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar) were used to introduce mutations into PMA1 gene fragments (596-bp1 ClaI toBstEII; 615-bp BstEII to EcoRI; 519-bpBglII to SalI; 1769-bp BglII toSacI; Ref. 1.Serrano R. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Fink G.R. Nature. 1986; 319: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) that had previously been subcloned into a modified version of Bluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Each fragment was sequenced to verify the presence of the mutation and the absence of unwanted base changes, and moved into the full-lengthPMA1 gene in plasmid pPMA1.2 (13.Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 3770-bpHindIII to SacI piece containing the entire coding sequence of the gene was then transferred to the centromeric plasmid YCp2HSE, placing the mutated gene under heat shock control; the resulting plasmids were transformed into strain SY4 ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae (13.Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In strain SY4 (MATa, ura3–52, leu2–3, 112, his4–619, sec6–4, GAL, pma1::YIpGAL-PMA1; Ref. 13.Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the chromosomal PMA1 gene has been placed under control of theGAL1 promoter (P GAL -PMA1) by the gene disruption strategy of Cid et al. (15.Cid A. Perona R. Serrano R. Curr. Genet. 1987; 12: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). SY4 also carries a temperature-sensitive mutation in the SEC6 gene, blocking the last step in plasma membrane biogenesis and leading to the accumulation of secretory vesicles (16.Schekman R. Novick P. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Metabolism and Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 361-398Google Scholar). For expression studies, SY4 cells transformed with the desired plasmid were grown to mid-exponential phase (A 600 ∼ 0.7–1.2) on supplemented minimal medium containing 2% galactose at 23 °C, shifted to medium containing 2% glucose for 3 h to turn off expression of the chromosomal copy of the PMA1 gene, and then shifted to 37 °C for 2 h to turn on expression of the plasmid-borne allele. Secretory vesicles containing newly synthesized plasmid-encoded ATPase were isolated by differential centrifugation and further purified by gel filtration (13.Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Petrov V.V. Slayman C.W. J. Biol.

Cell. 1994; 79: 245-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 19.Ambesi A. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 251: 127-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In both cases, cells were converted to spheroplasts and lysed by homogenization in 0.4 m sorbitol, 10 mm triethanolamine-acetic acid (TEA), pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 2 μg/ml chymostatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin (for gel filtration or sorbitol gradient centrifugation) or in the same buffer containing 12.5% sucrose (for sucrose gradient centrifugation). After centrifugation at 14,500 × g for 10 min to remove debris, the supernatant fraction was spun at 160,000 × g for 35 min to collect a crude secretory vesicle fraction, which was suspended in 0.8 msorbitol, 10 mm TEA, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA (for gel filtration or sorbitol gradient centrifugation) or 12.5% sucrose, 10 mm TEA, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA (for sucrose gradient centrifugation). Both resuspension buffers contained protease inhibitors. Gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-1000 column was carried out as described previously (13.Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Petrov V.V. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28535-28540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For gradient centrifugation, 3 ml of vesicle suspension was applied to the top of a two-step density gradient of either sorbitol (7.5 ml of 22.5% sorbitol, 21 ml of 42.5% sorbitol in 10 mm HEPES-KOH, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) or sucrose (8 ml of 20% sucrose, 20 ml of 37.5% sucrose in 10 mm HEPES-KOH, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5). After sedimentation at 113,000 × g for 60 min, the vesicles (2.5–3.5 ml) were collected at the interface, diluted 4–5-fold with 1 mm EGTA-Tris, pH 7.5, and sedimented at 100,000 ×g for 35 min. The pellet was washed with 0.8 msorbitol, 10 mm TEA, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, re-centrifuged, and suspended at a protein concentration of 0.7–2.5 mg/ml in the same buffer including all protease inhibitors except diisopropyl fluorophosphate. Synthesis of plasmid-encoded ATPase was assayed by35S labeling and immunoprecipitation under conditions permitting expression of the plasmid but not the chromosomalPMA1 gene as described by Nakamoto et al. (20.Nakamoto R.K. Verjovski-Almeida S. Allen K.E. Ambesi A. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7338-7344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Total membranes containing radiolabeled ATPase were isolated and treated as described by Nakamoto et al. (20.Nakamoto R.K. Verjovski-Almeida S. Allen K.E. Ambesi A. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7338-7344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). ATPase expression in secretory vesicles was measured by SDS-gel electrophoresis and Western blotting, as described elsewhere (13.Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Petrov V.V. Slayman C.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 6708-6713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were treated with affinity-purified polyclonal antibody against the closely related plasma membrane H+-ATPase of N. crassa (22.Hager K.M. Mandala S.M. Davenport J.W. Speicher D.W. Benz Jr., E.J. Slayman C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7693-7697Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and then with 125I-protein A (ICN, Irvine, CA), and assayed either by exposure to Kodak XAR-5 film at −70 °C, followed by excision of the 100-kDa ATPase band and γ-counting or by means of a PhosphorImager equipped with ImageQuant software version 3.3 (Molecular Dynamics). In both cases, the expression of mutant ATPase was calculated relative to a wild-type control run in parallel (17.Petrov V.V. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28535-28540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis was assayed at 30 °C in buffer containing 50 mm MES-Tris, pH 5.7, 5 mmNa2ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KN3, and an ATP-regenerating system (5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate and 50 μg/ml pyruvate kinase) in the absence or presence of 100 μm sodium orthovanadate. Inorganic phosphate was measured by the method of Fiske and Subbarow (23.Fiske C.H. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), and protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowryet al. (24.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and/or Bensadoun and Weinstein (25.Bensadoun A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2722) Google Scholar); for the protein assay, an appropriate aliquot of vesicle resuspension buffer was added to the bovine serum albumin standard to compensate for changes in absorbance due to the presence of interfering compounds. For the determination of pH optimum, the pH was adjusted to values between 5.0 and 7.0. K m determinations were made in the same medium except that 5 mm ATP was replaced with varying amounts of MgATP (1:1); in each case, the true concentration of MgATP was calculated according to Fabiato and Fabiato (26.Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar). H+ pumping into the secretory vesicles was monitored by fluorescence quenching of the pH-sensitive dye acridine orange as described previously (13.Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Petrov V.V. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28535-28540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Assays were carried out at 29 °C with continuous stirring on a Hitachi F2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer (excitation, 430 nm; emission, 530 nm) equipped with Intracellular Cation Measurement System software. Freshly prepared vesicles (50–100 μg) were suspended in 1.5 ml of 0.6m sorbitol, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 6.7, 100 mm KCl, 2 μm acridine orange, and ATP (0.2–3.0 mm), and after stabilization of base-line fluorescence (120–150 s), proton pumping was initiated by the addition of MgCl2 (5.2–8.0 mm). Parallel measurement of ATPase activity under the same conditions was performed in 100–150 μl of 0.6 m sorbitol, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 6.7, 100 mm KCl, containing ATP (0.2–3.0 mm) and MgCl2 (5.2–8.0 mm) at 29 °C for 2–60 min. The reaction was stopped with 1 ml of 1.25% trichloroacetic acid, and inorganic phosphate was measured as above. Fig.1 illustrates the 10 postulated transmembrane segments of the yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase. The present study has focused on seven negatively charged residues (Glu-129, Asp-143, Glu-703, Asp-730, Asp-739, Glu-803, Asp-833) and four positively charged residues (Arg-695, His-701, Arg-811, Arg-857) located within these segments. Glu-288, which lies close to the cytoplasmic end of M3, was also included. In each case, site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace the charged amino acid by two different neutral amino acids of roughly equivalent size (Asp by Asn or Val; Glu by Gln or Leu; Arg by Leu or Met; His by Gln or Leu), and the resulting ATPase was expressed in yeast secretory vesicles (13.Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because it seemed likely that some of the mutant ATPases might be structurally altered in a way that would prevent normal biogenesis, isolated secretory vesicles were examined by quantitative immunoblotting with anti-ATPase antibody. Indeed, of the 24 mutants examined in the initial set, 11 showed major defects in biogenesis (R695L, R695M, H701L, H701Q, D730N, D730V, D739N, D739V, E803L, R811L, and R811M), with ATPase protein reaching the vesicles at only 1–13% of the level observed for the wild-type enzyme (Table I).Table ICharged residues in transmembrane segments of the yeast PMA1 H + -ATPase: effect of mutations on expression and ATP hydrolysisMutationMembrane segmentExpressionaThe specific expression of 100-kDa ATPase protein was calculated by quantitative immunoblotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.”ATP hydrolysisbATP hydrolysis was measured as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” This series of experiments included 62 wild-type preparations with an average ATPase activity of 4.25 ± 0.21 μmol of Pi/min · mg.

Open table in a new tab Previous work has revealed that mutations at two of these positions, Arg-695 and Asp-730, lead to severe misfolding of the ATPase, greatly increasing the sensitivity of the 100-kDa protein to trypsin (27.Sen Gupta S. DeWitt N.D. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34328-34334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 2, mutations at His-701 and Asp-739 had a similar effect. In this experiment,35S-labeled total membranes were incubated at a trypsin:protein ratio of 1:20 and immunoprecipitated with anti-ATPase antibody. By contrast with the wild-type ATPase, in which a major 97-kDa fragment appeared at 0.5 min and remained at 1.0 min, H701Q and D739V were completely degraded by 0.5 min, with no trace of the 97-kDa band; similar results were obtained for H701L and D739N (data not shown). Thus, as with Arg-695 and Asp-730, His-701 and Asp-739 appear to play a critical role in protein folding. Of the remaining mutants, three (D143N, D143V, D833N) reached the secretory vesicles in reduced but measurable amounts and gave very low rates of ATP hydrolysis (8–13%). It is interesting to note that at least two members of this group were relatively resistant to limited trypsinolysis, even though the 97-kDa band was not seen (D143V, illustrated in Fig. 2; D143N, data not shown). The rest of the mutants (E129Q, E129L, E288Q, E288L, E703Q, E703L, E803Q, D833V, R857M, R857L) were well expressed in the vesicles (71–111%) and hydrolyzed ATP at a sufficient rate (37–123%) to be studied in detail. A simple way to screen for qualitative changes in mutant H+-ATPases is to measure several standard kinetic properties including the K m for MgATP,IC 50 for orthovanadate, and pH optimum. When this was done for the 10 mutants listed above, only minor differences were observed from the wild-type control (TableII). Thus, there is no evidence for significant defects in the ATP or vanadate binding sites, which are presumably located in the cytoplasmic portion of the molecule. Equally important, there does not seem to be any appreciable shift in the equilibrium between the E 1 andE 2 conformational states of the enzyme, since such a shift would be expected to result in a coordinated change ofK m, K i, and pH optimum (for further discussion, see Ref. 28.Ambesi A.

In each case, the initial rate of acridine orange fluorescence quenching was measured over a range of MgATP concentrations, and the rate of quenching was plotted as a function of the rate of ATP hydrolysis, measured in parallel under the same conditions. For the wild type ATPase, as observed previously (28.Ambesi A. Pan R.L. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22999-23005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), there was a linear relationship between the two rates (Fig.3), consistent with the idea that the stoichiometry of proton transport remained roughly constant over the entire range of pump velocities. Seven of the mutants gave data points that superimposed with those seen in the wild-type control (Fig. 3). For E703Q and E703L, however, the slope of quenching versusATPase activity was significantly lower than in the wild type, suggesting that proton transport was partially uncoupled from ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, one mutant (E803Q) gave an increased slope, consistent with the idea that proton transport was enhanced relative to the rate of hydrolysis (Fig. 4).Figure 4Proton pumping as a function of ATP hydrolysis in mutants of Glu-703 and Glu-803. For details, see “Experimental Procedures” and legend to Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It was important to ask whether any difference in proton leak could be detected in secretory vesicles containing the Glu-703 and Glu-803 mutant ATPases. To address this question, the MgATP concentration was adjusted to give approximately equal maximal values of ΔpH in E803Q and wild-type vesicles (1 and 3 mm MgATP, respectively) and in E703Q and wild-type vesicles (3 and 1 mm MgATP, respectively), and the time courses of ATP hydrolysis and acridine orange fluorescence quenching were compared in detail. In each case, hydrolysis was linear for at least 12 min (Fig.5, bottom panels), while quenching reached a maximum within 1–2 min (Fig. 5, top panels); at this point, the inward pumping of protons was presumably balanced by the outward leak. At the steady state, the pump was then turned off by addition of 250 μm vanadate (Fig.5, top) or 0.5 mg of hexokinase + 1% glucose (data not shown). In both mutants, the pH gradient decayed with a time course very similar to that seen in the corresponding wild-type control. Thus, there is no evidence that the passive permeability of the secretory vesicle membrane is different in the mutants; rather, the pumps themselves appear to be altered in the coupling between proton transport and ATP hydrolysis, with “undercoupling” in E703Q and “overcoupling” in E803Q. From the data described thus far, Glu-803 clearly emerged as an intriguing residue; replacement by Gln produced an enzyme with enhanced proton pumping, while replacement by Leu blocked biogenesis. To gain a better understanding of structure-function relationships at this position, five additional mutants were constructed and analyzed (TableIII). The ability of the mutants to be expressed in secretory vesicles ranged widely, from 8% in E803S to 24% in E803D, 45% in E803C, 82% in E803N, and 93% in E803R, showing no obvious correlation with the size, charge, or hydrophobicity of the substituted amino acid. In the mutants that were expressed sufficiently well to allow a reliable assay of ATP hydrolysis, activity was undetectable in E803R, barely detectable in E803C, and reasonably good in E803N (45% of the wild-type control after correction for expression; Table III). There were no significant abnormalities ofK m, IC 50, or pH optimum in E803N (Table II). Interestingly, however, the comparison of acridine orange fluorescence quenching with ATP hydrolysis over a range of MgATP concentrations revealed that E803N was very poorly coupled (Fig. 4). Thus, Glu-803 is a residue at which substitutions can either increase or decrease the apparent coupling between hydrolysis and transport.Table IIIEffect of additional mutations at Asp-730 and Glu-803 on expression and ATP hydrolysisMutationMembrane segmentExpressionATP hydrolysisaThis series of experiments included 21 preparations of wild-type vesicles with an average ATPase activity of 4.64 ± 0.26 μmol of Pi/min · mg.

In the present study, we show that CMF1 is a member of an emerging family of proteins that includes centromeric protein-F, mitosin, and LEK1. These proteins are characterized by their large size (350 kDa), dynamic subcellular distribution, and potential functions in cell division and differentiation. The current data suggest that CMF1 is a unique member of this family by virtue of its restricted protein expression and variant subcellular distribution. Immunochemical analysis demonstrates that CMF1 protein is expressed in cardiogenic cells prior to the activation of cardiac structural gene products. In addition, we show that expression of CMF1 is not dependent on the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway during development. Still, CMF1 cannot direct cardiomyogenesis in the absence of such factors as NKX-2.5. Taken with our previous data, this study suggests that CMF1 is a BMP-independent component of the cardiomyogenic pathway.

Studies investigating the expression of contractile proteins indicate that differentiation of cardiac myocytes occurs after approximately 25 h of development and progresses from anterior to posterior within the cardiogenic mesoderm (5.Ruzicka D.L.

Development. 1994; 120: 871-883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In recent years, several genes encoding transcription factors have been implicated in the restriction of anterior mesodermal cells to the cardiogenic cell lineage. For example, the NKX, MEF2, GATA, and HAND gene families clearly play important and interacting roles in the regulation of vertebrate cardiac myogenesis (9.Fishman M.C. Chien K.R. Development. 1997; 124: 2099-2117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Fishman M.C. Olson E.N. Cell. 1997; 91: 153-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The expression of regulators such as NKX-2.5 is dependent upon an interaction of cardiogenic mesoderm with endoderm that is mediated by BMP1 signaling (11.Schultheiss T.M. Xydas S. Lassar A.B. Development. 1995; 121: 4203-4214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Schultheiss T.M. Birch J. Lassar A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 451-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Although none of these genes regulates cardiogenic commitment and/or differentiation individually, the deletion of any one of them leads to a deviation in the cardiomyogenic differentiation pathway. The specific cellular mechanisms that are regulated by these factors remain unresolved. Our laboratory has recently identified a novel transcript, CMF1, that is expressed at high levels in early embryonic hearts (1.Wei Y. Bader D. Litvin J. Development. 1996; 122: 2779-2789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous studies have shown that retrovirally mediated disruption of CMF1 function inhibits the expression and/or accumulation of sarcomeric myosin heavy chain proteins (MHC) in differentiating cardiac myocytes. These data suggest that CMF1 may play a regulative role in the commitment and/or differentiation of cardiogenic cells. Preliminary sequence analysis has determined that CMF1 is related to a recently identified group of proteins, CENP-F, mitosin, and LEK1, which are expressed in a wide variety of cell types and have a generally conserved structure and size (13.Liao H. Winkfein R.J. Mack G. Rattner J.B. Yen T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 507-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 14.Zhu X. Mancini M.A. Chang K.-H. Liu C.-Y. Chen C-F. Shan B. Jones D.

Chem. 1999; 274: 18597-18604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The predicted secondary structure is also conserved among these proteins consisting mainly of α-helices separated by loops with a globular carboxyl terminus. HeLa cell-derived CENP-F and mitosin are identical except for a perfect repeat in the 5′-end of CENP-F and a slightly longer 3′-end in mitosin (13.Liao H. Winkfein R.J. Mack G. Rattner J.B. Yen T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 507-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 14.Zhu X. Mancini M.A. Chang K.-H. Liu C.-Y. Chen C-F. Shan B. Jones D. Yang-Feng T.L. Lee W.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5017-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Immunocytological analyses of CENP-F and mitosin suggest that these proteins are expressed in all dividing cells in vitro and that they have a dynamic subcellular localization (13.Liao H. Winkfein R.J. Mack G. Rattner J.B. Yen T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 507-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 14.Zhu X. Mancini M.A. Chang K.-H. Liu C.-Y. Chen C-F. Shan B. Jones D. Yang-Feng T.L. Lee W.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5017-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). During S phase, these proteins become localized to the nucleus. During mitosis they associate with the kinetochore, and subsequently with the spindle apparatus and midbody, and are rapidly degraded after mitosis. This intriguing expression pattern suggested that CENP-F and mitosin could be involved in the regulation of mitosis. Initial functional analyses support this hypothesis, because a dominant-negative construct of mitosin inhibits the G2/M transition of the cell cycle (14.Zhu X. Mancini M.A. Chang K.-H. Liu C.-Y. Chen C-F. Shan B. Jones D. Yang-Feng T.L. Lee W.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5017-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Although there is an obvious similarity of predicted structure among these proteins, preliminary studies suggest a heterogeneity of function within this family. Although murine LEK1 is more than 80% homologous to human CENP-F and mitosin, it has a vastly different pattern of expression and subcellular localization. LEK1 is ubiquitously expressed in early mouse development, but there is a general cessation of expression throughout the embryo as cell division subsides (15.Goodwin R.L. Pabón-Peña L.M. Foster G.C. Bader D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18597-18604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although LEK1 is present in all cardiac myocytes early in heart development, its expression sharply declines after 4 days postpartum when mitosis in myogenic cells ceases (15.Goodwin R.L. Pabón-Peña L.M. Foster G.C. Bader D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18597-18604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 16.Soonpaa M.H. Kim K.K. Pajak L. Franklin M.

LEK1 is not expressed in adult proliferative cells such as skin and intestinal epithelia. Additionally, the subcellular distribution of LEK1 varies from that of CENP-F and mitosin, as LEK1 is present in the nucleus of interphase cells. During mitosis, it is not detected in the kinetochore and midbody but is detected in the cytosol. Preliminary functional analysis indicates that LEK1 influences proliferation and skeletal muscle differentiation (15.Goodwin R.L. Pabón-Peña L.M. Foster G.C. Bader D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18597-18604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The present study suggests that CMF1 is a member of the CENP-F/mitosin/LEK1 family. Despite the significant similarities among this group of proteins, CMF1 is unique in that its expression is highly restricted and its subcellular localization is vastly different from other family members. In addition, we show that CMF1 RNA is expressed before cardiogenic differentiation. The current data also demonstrate that CMF1 protein is present in cardiogenic cells before the appearance of structural proteins, and its expression precedes that of muscle structural proteins along the anteroposterior axis of the differentiating heart. Interestingly, early CMF1 expression is not dependent upon BMP signaling. Taken with our previous data indicating that CMF1 is an essential regulator of cardiac myogenesis (1.Wei Y. Bader D. Litvin J. Development. 1996; 122: 2779-2789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our current data reveal an essential BMP-independent component in the regulation of cardiac myogenesis. White Leghorn chicken eggs were purchased from Truslow Farms, Charlestown, MD. Eggs were maintained under high humidity in a 37 °C incubator. Embryos were staged according to Hamburger and Hamilton (18.Hamburger V. Hamilton H.L. J. Morphol. 1951; 88: 49-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (10014) Google Scholar), and all tissues were dissected and processed immediately postmortem. For analysis of BMP signaling, stage 4 cardiogenic mesendoderm was isolated using standard techniques (19.Gannon M. Bader D. Development. 1995; 121: 2439-2450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cultured in the presence or absence of the BMP antagonist, noggin (12.Schultheiss T.M. Birch J. Lassar A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 451-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Medium conditioned by noggin-producing or nontransfected COS cells (kindly provided by Dr. Tom Schultheiss, Harvard University) was added to standard culture medium (50% v/v). Cultures were maintained for 24 h and processed for RT-PCR analysis. During the course of the current study, we discovered that the 5′-most clone of CMF1 contained an inverted cDNA fused to CMF1 sequences. Therefore, we recloned the 5′ sequences of CMF1 using as a probe pCMF1.2.11.b.1 from an embryonic chick heart library (1.Wei Y. Bader D. Litvin J. Development. 1996; 122: 2779-2789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple overlapping clones were identified, and both strands of all cDNA clones were sequenced and analyzed using the MacVector and Expasy programs. Rabbit antisera were prepared against selected CMF1 peptide sequences (SGHILDSVKELRSSTPSKYN; Biosynthesis). Antibodies were affinity purified with the immunopeptide using standard techniques (20.Bader D. Masaki T. Fischman D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar) and applied in Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses. For Western blot analysis, tissues were isolated from stage 6, day 11 embryos, sonicated in protein sample buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) and immediately loaded on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel after boiling. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to an Immobilon membrane (Millipore) using standard protocols. Membranes were blocked in 2.5% nonfat dry milk, 1% bovine serum albumin, 1× TBST for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with the affinity-purified anti-CMF1 antibody overnight at 4 °C. After extensive washing with 1× TBST, the membrane was incubated with goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) for 1 h and reacted with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) from 1–5 min. For immunofluorescence analysis, chicken and quail embryonic tissues were isolated and immediately placed in O.C.T. compound (Sakura) and frozen in isopentane/liquid nitrogen. Frozen tissues were cryosectioned using a Jung CM 3000 cryostat (Leica) in 8–10 micron increments and collected on gelatin coated slides. Slides were fixed with 70% methanol for 10 min and treated with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Nonspecific binding was blocked using 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Monoclonal antibodies MF20 and QH1 were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Affinity-purified anti-CMF1 was incubated overnight at 4 °C. After extensive washing in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, donkey anti-rabbit IgG or donkey anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Cy2 or Cy3 (Jackson Laboratory) was incubated at room temperature for 1 h and washed extensively in phosphate-buffered saline. These samples were then visualized using epifluorescence or laser confocal microscopy. Peptide competitions (100 molar excess of immune peptide) were performed for Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses to ensure antibody specificity. This treatment completely abolished antibody binding in both assays (see Fig. 4 A as an example). Staged embryonic tissues and cultured cardiogenic mesendoderm were collected, and total RNA was isolated using the Trizol reagent per the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). The Access RT-PCR system (Promega) was used to amplify cDNAs from 100 ng of total RNA. Primers used to amplify CMF1 are 5′-GAGTTGAATCTGAAGGCACAACC-3′ and 5′-CACCTTTTCTTGCAGGACCTC-3′. vMHC primers are 5′-GCTACAAACACCAAGCAGAG-3′ and 5′-TCTTATATCTGGGAGCCAGG-3′. GAPDH primers are 5′-GGGTCTTATGACCACTGTCC-3′ and 5′-GTAAGCTTCCCATTCAGCTCAG-3′. NKX-2.5 was amplified using primers designed by Schultheiss et al. (11.Schultheiss T.M. Xydas S. Lassar A.B. Development. 1995; 121: 4203-4214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conditions for amplification were: 48 °C, 45 min; [94 °C, 0.5 min; 53 °C, 0.75 min; 68 °C, 1 min] × 25; and 68 °C, 7 min. Negative controls including no template and no reverse transcriptase did not produce an amplification product under these conditions. Primer concentration, RNA input, and cycle numbers were optimized to ensure amplification in the linear range. Chicken genomic DNA was digested overnight at 37 °C with each of the following restriction endonucleases: EcoRI, HindIII, BamHI, and PstI (Promega). This DNA was then electrophoresed in an 0.8% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide. DNA was then transferred via capillary action to a nylon membrane and UV-cross-linked (Stratagene). The blot was prehybridized in RapidHyb (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 65 °C and hybridized overnight with radiolabeled chicken pCMF1.29a.1 probe containing sequences for the carboxyl terminus of CMF1 at 65 °C. Blots were washed three times in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 1 h at 65 °C. When corresponding murine LEK1 probe (pLEK1.29a.1) was used, hybridization was performed at 55 °C, and the blot was washed three times in 2× SSC; 0.1% SDS for 1 h at 60 °C. After the specified washes, blots were exposed using Biomax intensifying screen and Biomax film (Kodak). Sequence analyses indicate that CMF1 is related to an emerging family of nucleoproteins that include CENP-F (13.Liao H. Winkfein R.J. Mack G. Rattner J.B. Yen T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 507-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), mitosin (14.Zhu X. Mancini M.A. Chang K.-H. Liu C.-Y. Chen C-F. Shan B. Jones D. Yang-Feng T.L. Lee W.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5017-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and LEK1 (15.Goodwin R.L. Pabón-Peña L.M. Foster G.C. Bader D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18597-18604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The predicted chicken CMF1 protein is 65% similar to human CENP-F/mitosin and mouse LEK1. An additional unifying characteristic of these proteins is that approximately 40% of their amino acid composition is leucine, glutamic acid, or lysine. These proteins are also predicted to have a similar secondary structure that is composed mainly of α-helices separated by loops and a globular carboxyl terminus. In addition, this novel protein family has a conserved collinear array of potential regulatory domains. All domains depicted in Fig. 1 are conserved in all proteins. Similar to CENP-F, mitosin, and LEK1, CMF1 contains multiple putative leucine zippers located throughout its length. A carboxyl-terminal bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) that has been shown to be functional in the mammalian proteins is also present within CMF1. The isolated NLS of CMF1 can direct the efficient nuclear transport of a reporter protein. 2E. Dees, L. M. Pabón-Peña, R. L. Goodwin, and D. Bader, submitted for publication. Adjacent to the NLS, all four proteins have an atypical Rb binding site. Ligand screening and fusion protein-binding assays have shown that mitosin can interact with Rb using this atypical domain (14.Zhu X. Mancini M.A. Chang K.-H. Liu C.-Y. Chen C-F. Shan B. Jones D. Yang-Feng T.L. Lee W.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5017-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Similarities in amino acid composition and conservation of putative regulatory domains raise the possibility that CMF1, LEK1, CENP-F, and mitosin are related members of a gene family. To determine whether related sequences were present in the avian genome, chicken genomic blots were probed with a well conserved 3′ region of CMF1 and LEK1 cDNAs. Hybridizations with the CMF1 probe showed a single band at both high and low stringencies (Fig.2 A). However, when LEK1 probe was utilized, additional bands other than the CMF1-specific hybridization were observed (Fig. 2 b). These results, along with data presented below, suggest that CMF1 may not be the only avian member of this emerging gene family. LEK1, CENP-F, and mitosin are observed in a wide variety of cells. Nevertheless, only the expression pattern and subcellular localization of LEK1 in embryos have been reported (15.Goodwin R.L. Pabón-Peña L.M. Foster G.C. Bader D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18597-18604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To better understand CMF1 function during embryogenesis, we characterized the expression of CMF1 protein. Western blot analyses using hearts of stage 15 chicken embryos show that CMF1 is significantly larger than the 200-kDa MHC protein (Fig.3 A, lanes 1 and3, respectively). The predicted size of CENP-F/mitosin/LEK1 proteins is approximately 350 kDa. Competition analysis with the immune peptide shows that the band detected in the Western blots is specific to this CMF1 antibody (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). Furthermore, the expression of various CMF1 constructs in bacterial or eukaryotic cells demonstrates that this antibody specifically detects a product derived from the CMF1 transcript (data not shown). To determine the spatial distribution of CMF1 protein, we analyzed various regions of stage 15 chicken embryos. Western blot analyses show that although CMF1 protein is expressed at high levels in the heart, it is not detected in the anterior or posterior regions of early chicken embryos (Fig. 3 B). Immunofluorescence analyses were performed to characterize the cellular distribution of CMF1 expression in developing embryos. A transverse section of a stage 13 chicken thorax demonstrates that CMF1 protein expression is restricted to the heart (Fig. 3 C). Phase and immunofluorescence analyses of a day 7 chicken heart demonstrate that CMF1 expression is absent in epicardial cells but is present in myogenic cells (Fig.4, A and B). Double immunostaining with the CMF1 antibody and the molecular marker of quail endothelial cells QH1, demonstrates that CMF1 is absent from endothelial cells within developing vessels and the endocardium (Fig.4 C). Cardiac expression of CMF1 is detected throughout embryogenesis; however, it significantly decreases after day 7 (Fig.5 and data not shown). These data suggest that, unlike CENP-F, mitosin, and LEK1, with their broad expression patterns, CMF1 protein expression is confined to myocytes. Although disruption of CMF1 function inhibits the expression and/or accumulation of cardiac structural proteins, the cellular mechanisms regulated by this novel protein remain unknown. However, the homology of CMF1 to CENP-F/mitosin/LEK1 and the presence of a carboxyl-terminal bipartite NLS that is conserved among members of this family suggest that CMF1 has the potential to perform its function within the nucleus. The subcellular localization of CMF1 within embryonic cardiac myocytes was analyzed using laser scanning confocal microscopy. For this purpose, the distribution of CMF1 was compared with known markers of nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. As seen in Fig. 4 D, depicting the atrioventricular junction of a stage 15 chicken heart, CMF1 is detected in the cytoplasm of developing cardiac myocytes. In these experiments, the nuclear stain YoPro (Molecular Probes) was utilized to visualize the nucleus. Cytoplasmic localization was maintained in differentiated myocytes. CMF1 did not colocalize with any marker of thick, thin, or intermediate filaments or any other marker of cytoplasmic organelles (data not shown). The cytoplasmic localization of CMF1 differs significantly from the subcellular distribution observed for CENP-F, mitosin, and LEK1 that are present in the nucleus. Disruption of MHC expression as a result of the retrovirally mediated inhibition of CMF1 function in cardiogenic mesoderm indicated that this novel protein had a regulative role in cardiac myogenesis (1.Wei Y. Bader D. Litvin J. Development. 1996; 122: 2779-2789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If CMF1 were to have a regulative role in the initial steps of heart development, its mRNA and/or protein products should be expressed prior to the initiation of expression of structural muscle genes. To characterize the temporal expression pattern of CMF1 mRNA during early chicken embryogenesis, we performed RT-PCR analyses using RNAs between stages 4 and 15. In these experiments, the expression of CMF1 is detected as early as stages 4–5 (Fig. 5). During this time frame, progenitor cells are committed to the cardiac myogenic lineage but have not differentiated into myocytes. The onset of cardiac myogenic differentiation is marked by the expression of structural genes such as vMHC (6.Bisaha J.G. Bader D. Dev. Biol. 1990; 148: 355-364Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 8.Yutzey K.E. Rhee J.T. Bader D. Development. 1994; 120: 871-883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Schultheiss T.M. Xydas S. Lassar A.B. Development. 1995; 121: 4203-4214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A comparison of CMF1 and vMHC reactions in Fig. 5 shows that the expression of CMF1 is detected prior to the initiation of vMHC expression. The consistent levels of GAPDH demonstrate that equivalent amounts of RNA were utilized in the embryonic stages analyzed. It should be noted that the CMF1 transcript can be detected by RT-PCR in non-cardiogenic tissues (data not shown). Therefore, analysis of CMF1 protein expression was conducted during these early stages. We examined the expression pattern of CMF1 protein with reference to cardiac myogenesis, using the expression of sarcomeric MHC as a marker of differentiation. Cardiogenic mesoderm or hearts from stages 6–14 and day 11 embryos were isolated and processed for Western blot analysis. As seen in Fig. 5 B, CMF1 is first detected in stage 6 cardiogenic mesoderm and is maintained during the early stages of heart development. The level of CMF1 expression falls after the first week of development (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, expression of sarcomeric MHC is first detected at stage 10 and is maintained throughout embryogenesis. It should be noted that Han et al.(7.Han Y. Dennis J.E. Cohen-Gould L. Bader D.M. Fischman D.A. Dev. Dynam. 1992; 193: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) detected MHC protein expression in a minor group of cells flanking the anterior intestinal portal at stage 8 using immunofluorescence analysis. Our Western analyses included the entire cardiogenic field and did not detect the expression of MHC in this group of cells. The present data show that CMF1 protein is detected prior to cardiomyogenic differentiation. To determine the cellular distribution of CMF1 protein prior to the differentiation of cardiac myocytes, we conducted immunofluorescence analysis of stage 5 embryos. As seen in Fig.5 C, CMF1 protein is observed at high levels in the anterior mesoderm (panels a–c); however, it is absent from posterior mesoderm (panels d–f). CMF1 protein distribution is broad within the anterior mesoderm, extending from midline laterally at this stage. At this early embryonic stage, we cannot determine whether all CMF1-positive cells are cardiac precursors. The implications of these observations are discussed below (see “Discussion”). CMF1 protein is detected in the mesoderm prior to the differentiation of cardiac myocytes. However, the previous data do not determine the relationship of CMF1 protein expression relative to the expression of structural proteins in the heart. To determine the pattern of CMF1 protein expression during the initial phases of cardiac myogenic differentiation, stage 10 hearts were serial sectioned and reacted with anti-CMF1 and anti-MHC for double immunofluorescence analysis. At this point in development, lateral anterior splanchnic mesoderm has fused to form a single heart tube. Posteriorly, the paired heart tubes have not yet fused (diagrammed in Fig.6 A). Cardiomyogenesis, including the expression of muscle-specific genes and their protein products, proceeds along the anteroposterior axis within cardiogenic mesoderm (5.Ruzicka D.L. Schwartz R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2575-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 7.Han Y. Dennis J.E. Cohen-Gould L. Bader D.M. Fischman D.A. Dev. Dynam. 1992; 193: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 8.Yutzey K.E. Rhee J.T. Bader D. Development. 1994; 120: 871-883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Ehrman L.A. Yutzey K.E. Dev. Biol. 1999; 207: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). An analysis of serial sections with MF20 reveals the anteroposterior wave of myogenic differentiation from the fused heart tube (Fig. 6 B, d) into the unfused, paired heart tubes (Fig. 6 B, h, and at minor levels in 6B, l). The posterior regions of the unfused tubes are not positive for MHC (Fig. 6 B, p). Later, all myogenic cells of the heart tubes express muscle-specific structural proteins. Interestingly, examination of the same sections demonstrated that CMF1 protein is expressed throughout the fused and unfused heart tubes (Fig. 6 B,c, g, k, and o). Taken together, these data demonstrate that CMF1 protein expression precedes that of muscle-specific protein expression in a temporal and spatial manner. Our previous data demonstrated that disruption of CMF1 function blocks cardiomyogenic differentiation (1.Wei Y. Bader D. Litvin J. Development. 1996; 122: 2779-2789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Schultheisset al. (11.Schultheiss T.M. Xydas S. Lassar A.B. Development. 1995; 121: 4203-4214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that NKX-2.5 expression, which is critical for the differentiation of avian cardiac myocytes, is dependent upon BMP signaling. To determine whether CMF1 expression is regulated in the same BMP-dependent manner as NKX-2.5, cardiogenic mesoderm and associated endoderm were isolated, cultured in the presence or absence of the BMP antagonist noggin (12.Schultheiss T.M. Birch J. Lassar A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 451-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), and assayed for cardiomyogenic differentiation using RT-PCR and immunochemical analyses. RT-PCR analyses showed that control cultures expressed high levels of NKX-2.5, CMF1, and vMHC (Fig.7 A). As previously reported by Schultheiss et al. (11.Schultheiss T.M. Xydas S. Lassar A.B. Development. 1995; 121: 4203-4214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), noggin blocked the expression of NKX-2.5 and the downstream gene product vMHC in the anterior mesendoderm. Interestingly, noggin treatment did not block the expression of CMF1 in these same cultures when assayed by RT-PCR (Fig.7 A). The sensitivity of RT-PCR assays raises the possibility that the CMF1 RNA detected after noggin treatment is derived from a minor non-cardiogenic component of the embryonic explants. To address the possibility that only non-cardiogenic cells express CMF1 following noggin treatment, we analyzed cardiogenic mesendoderm explants at the cellular level using the CMF1 antibody (Fig. 7 B).

The molecular mass of BLIP-I was estimated to be 17.5 kDa by gel filtration fast protein liquid chromatography. The N-terminal sequence was NH2-Asn-Ser-Gly-Phe-Ser-Ala-Glu-Lys-Tyr-Glu-Gln-Ile-Gln-Phe-Gly. BLIP-I inhibited Bacto® Penase (Difco), and plasmid encoded TEM-1 β-lactamase, whereas it did not inhibit Enterobacter cloacae β-lactamases. The K i value of BLIP-I against TEM-1 β-lactamase was determined to be 0.047 nm. The gene (bliA) encoding BLIP-I protein was identified by screening a genomic library using an oligonucleotide probe with a sequence based on the N-terminal sequence of BLIP-I. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed that the gene was 558 base pairs in length and encoded a mature protein of 157 amino acid residues preceded by a 29-amino acid signal sequence. Pairwise comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence showed 38% identity with BLIP ofStreptomyces clavuligerus. Furthermore, the 49th amino acid residue of BLIP-I was identical to Asp-49 of BLIP that was characterized to be an important residue for the inhibitory activity of BLIP. A modified BLIP-I in which Asp-49 was replaced by alanine (D49A) was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis. The inhibitory activities of recombinant (r) BLIP-I and its D49A mutant derivative, expressed in Escherichia coli, were compared. The K i value of rBLIP-I against TEM-1 β-lactamase was similar to that of wild-type BLIP-I, but the D49A mutation increased the K i of rBLIP-I inhibition approximately 200-fold. A disruption mutant of the bliAgene in S. exfoliatus SMF19 was obtained by replacing the wild-type bliA gene with a copy inactivated by inserting a hygromycin resistance gene. The disruption mutant showed a bald phenotype, indicating that the bliA gene plays a role in morphological differentiation.

Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1979; 33: 113-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Widespread use of β-lactam antibiotics has led to the evolution of β-lactamase-mediated resistance in bacteria, which is now a serious threat to antibiotic therapy (2.Neu H.C.

Antibiotics Containing β-Lactam Structure. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1983: 1-4Google Scholar). TEM-1 β-lactamase, encoded by the bla TEM-1 gene, is one of the most prevalent β-lactamases and efficiently hydrolyzes penicillins and most cephalosporins (4.Bush K. Jacoby G.A. Medeiros A.

Recently, specific mutations have appeared in β-lactamases including TEM-1 β-lactamase, and these mutations enable the enzyme to hydrolyze the newer third generation antibiotics. These extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs)1 have provided clinically relevant levels of resistance to even the most recently developed β-lactams (7.Medeiros A.A. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1997; 24: 19-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Jacoby G.A. Medeiros A.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1991; 35: 1697-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 9.Venkatachalam K.V.

The incentive to maintain the efficacy of the classic β-lactams is great because they are still the antibiotics of choice in terms of having minimal side effects and a low cost of production (2.Neu H.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1064-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2351) Google Scholar). In addition to developing new β-lactams unable to be cleaved by β-lactamases, developing new potent inhibitors of β-lactamase is another strategy to circumvent ESBL-mediated inactivation of β-lactam antibiotics. Although β-lactamase inhibitors such as clavulanic acid and tazobacta have been used clinically (11.Reading C. Cole M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1977; 11: 852-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar), their wide application is somewhat hindered by the emergence of organisms bearing inhibitor-resistant β-lactamases (7.Medeiros A.A.

A protein showing an inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus β-lactamase was isolated from Streptomyces gedaensis (15.Hata T. Omura S. Iwaw Y. Ohno H. Takeshima T. Yamguchi N. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1972; 25: 473-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thereafter, BLIPs from Streptomyces clavuligerus (16.Doran J.L. Leskiw B.K. Aippersbach S. Jensen S.E. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and BLIP-II from Streptomyces exfoliatus SMF19 (17.Kim M.K. Lee K.J. Appl. Environ.

BLIP from S. clavuligerus was a potent inhibitor of TEM-1 β-lactamase (K i = 0.6 nm), and the crystal structure of BLIP was determined, as well as the co-crystal with TEM-1 β-lactamase (19.Strynadka N.C.J.

James M.N.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It was reported that Asp-49 and Phe-142 of BLIP contribute to the inhibitory activity by interacting with Ser-70 of TEM-1 β-lactamase and mimicking the benzyl of penicillin G, respectively (21.Petrosino J. Rudgers G. Gilbert H. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2394-2400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). BLIP-II and the gene (bliB) encoding BLIP-II were recently identified from S. exfoliatus SMF19, but the deduced amino acid sequence did not show similarity to that of BLIP (18.Park H.U. Lee K.J. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 2161-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The eventual understanding of the inhibitory activity of BLIPs may lead to the development of new strategies for coping with the clinical occurrence of β-lactam antibiotic resistance. Although both of the BLIPs showed in vitro inhibitory activity against various β-lactamases, the biological roles of BLIP and BLIP-II are not well understood. Pairwise comparisons of the amino acid sequence of the two BLIPs did not show any evolutionary or structural relationship with other proteins (16.Doran J.L. Leskiw B.K. Aippersbach S. Jensen S.E. J.

This report describes purification, characterization, and cloning of a gene (bliA) encoding the new β-lactamase inhibitory protein (BLIP-I) from S. exfoliatus SMF19. ThebliA gene was also expressed at high levels inEscherichia coli to facilitate mutagenic study and to produce a large amount of functional BLIP-I. The contribution of certain amino acid residues to the inhibitory activity of TEM-1 β-lactamase was shown by site-specific mutagenesis and kinetic measurement. In order to see the biological importance ofbliA in the production strain, an insertional inactivation mutation of bliA was made, and the phenotypic changes were demonstrated.

Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11460) Google Scholar), pBluescriptII-KS(+) (Stratagene), and pZErO-2 (Invitrogen) were used to clone DNA fragments. E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) and plasmid pET-30a(+) (Novagen) were used to express wild-type bliA and the corresponding gene encoding the D49A mutant form. S. exfoliatus SMF19 was maintained on Bennett agar (28.Jones K.L. J. Bacteriol. 1949; 57: 141-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and spore suspensions were stored in 20% (v/v) glycerol at −20 °C. YEME, TSB, and R2YE media (24.Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8182) Google Scholar) were used to grow streptomycetes for DNA manipulation. To prepare seed cultures of S. exfoliatus SMF19, YED medium was inoculated with spore stocks in 20% glycerol and cultured at 30 °C on a rotary shaker (150 rpm). YED medium contained 1% glucose and 1% yeast extract (w/v). Seed cultures were used to inoculate BLIP-I production medium containing 1.5% glucose, 1.5% soytone, 0.2% yeast extract, 0.12% K2HPO4, 0.06% CaCO3, 0.001% CoCl2, and 0.0025% FeSO4 (w/v). The minimal medium for selecting a bliA disruption mutant contained 1.0% glucose, 0.2% NH4Cl, 1% MOPS, 0.1% KH2PO4, 0.05% MgSO4, 0.001% CaCl2, 0.002% ZnSO4, 0.0007% FeSO4, 0.0002% MnCl2, 0.0004% CuSO4, and 0.0004% CoCl2 (w/v). Production cultures were grown in glass jar fermentors (model KF-5L, Korea Fermentor) at 30 °C for 48 h. Agitation and aeration were 300 rpm and 1 v/v/min, respectively. Strains of E. coli were grown in LB medium containing appropriate antibiotics for plasmid or cosmid maintenance (29.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Ford N. Nolan C. Ferguson M. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The culture broth from a 48-h culture of S. exfoliatus SMF19 was collected by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 20 min. Ammonium sulfate was added to the culture broth up to 60% saturation, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 20 min and discarded. Ammonium sulfate was then added to the supernatant to 80% saturation, and the resulting precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The protein precipitate was resuspended in 5 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. The dialysate was loaded onto a 5 × 20 cm hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and eluted with a linear gradient of 5–300 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Active fractions for β-lactamase inhibitory activity were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration with a PM-10 membrane (Amicon). The sample obtained by hydroxyapatite chromatography was loaded onto a 5 × 20-cm DEAE-Sephadex A-50 column (Sigma) that was equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, and the column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1.0 m NaCl. Active fractions for β-lactamase inhibitory activity were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration with a PM-10 membrane (Amicon). The concentrated active fractions were applied to a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and then the pooled active fractions from Superdex 75 column were loaded onto a Mono Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1 mNaCl. The active fractions were pooled and loaded onto a Resource-PHE column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 50 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.0, supplemented with 40% (NH4)2SO4. The column was eluted with a linear reverse phase gradient of 40 to 0% (NH4)2SO4. Active fractions were desalted using a gel permeation chromatography column and then freeze-dried. The native molecular weight of BLIP-I was estimated using a Superose 12 FPLC gel filtration column equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The column was calibrated using Bio-Rad gel filtration standards. Protein concentration was analyzed by the Bradford method (30.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216033) Google Scholar). Purity of BLIP-I samples was assessed by SDS-PAGE, which was performed according to the method of Laemmli (31.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207129) Google Scholar). For N-terminal sequencing, the purified BLIP-I was electrophoresed on Tricine/SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) in transfer buffer A (10 mm CAPS and 10% methanol, pH 11.0). The N-terminal sequence was determined by the method of Edman degradation using a MilliGen/Biosearch ProSequencer 6600 (Millipore). General methods for DNA manipulations in Streptomyces spp. and E. coliwere performed as described by Hopwood et al. (23.Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T. Bruton C.J. Kieser H.M.

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Ford N. Nolan C. Ferguson M. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The genomic library of S. exfoliatus SMF19 was prepared as described (18.Park H.U. Lee K.J. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 2161-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A 45-mer, mixed oligonucleotide probe (5′-AATTC(G/C)GGCTTCTC(G/C)GC(G/C)GAGAA GTACGAGCAGATCCAGTTCGGC-3′) was designed based on the sequence of the N-terminal 15 amino acids of BLIP-I (Genosys). E. coli colonies containing recombinant cosmids were screened for hybridization to the oligonucleotide probe. The probe was labeled with the ECL 3′-oligolabeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Southern hybridization, colony hybridization, and physical mapping of the selected recombinant plasmid were performed using standard techniques (29.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Ford N. Nolan C. Ferguson M. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Both DNA strands of the insert of the selected recombinant plasmid were sequenced by the dideoxy method of Sanger et al. (32.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52648) Google Scholar) using Sequenase 2 and 7-deaza-GTP (Promega) in place of dGTP to relieve compressions. The DNA sequence of each fragment was determined repeatedly to provide unequivocal results in regions of high G + C content. The sequences of DNA fragments were assembled into a complete sequence using the DNASIS program (Hitachi). The nucleotide sequence data were also analyzed with the DNASIS program to identify restriction sites and regions of dyad symmetry. The location of the open reading frame was confirmed with the Frameplot program (33.Bibb M.J. Findlay P.R. Johnson M.W. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 30: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 34.Ishikawa J. Hotta K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 174: 251-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To produce functional BLIP-I in E. coli, an expression system was developed using pET-30a(+) vector (Novagen) that has an N-terminal His tag and enterokinase cleavage site. The structural gene of bliA encoding mature BLIP-I was first amplified by PCR. The primers are BLIPEXP1 (a top strand primer), 5′-GT CGCGGGTACCGACGACGACGACAAGAATTCGGGCTTTTCGGCC-3′, and BLIPEXP2 (a bottom strand primer), 5′-GGCGTCGGATCCTCAGGTCAGGCTGCGCTGGTAGCGGTA CGTCAG-3′. The primers were designed to incorporate KpnI andBamHI sites, respectively. TheKpnI/BamHI-digested PCR fragment was inserted between KpnI and BamHI sites of pET-30a(+), creating pSMF1130. The positioning of bliA in pSMF1130 allowed the gene to be expressed by induction of the T7lacpromoter with IPTG, and the His6 tag facilitated the purification of BLIP-I using an appropriate nickel- or cobalt-based affinity column. The mature BLIP-I protein can then be obtained by using enterokinase cleavage. A recombinant plasmid to produce the D49A mutant form of BLIP-I was constructed. Site-directed mutagenesis of Asp-49 to Ala was accomplished using the Altered Sites II in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega). AnEcoRI-SacI fragment of pSMF1130 containing the Asp-49 coding region was cloned into pAlter-1 (pSMF11302), and then site-specific mutagenesis of Asp to Ala was carried out as described in the technical manual. The mutagenic oligonucleotide used was 5′-GAGTCGGGCGCCTACGCCCCC-3′ (underlined was theNarI site). Plasmid DNA was isolated from candidate mutant clones and screened by digestion with NarI, incorporated in the mutagenic oligonucleotide. The corresponding codons ofNarI site in the wild-type bliA gene were GGCGCG, not digested with NarI. The plasmid carrying presumptive mutant bliA gene was named pSMF11307. TheEcoRI-SacI fragment from pSMF11307 was cloned into EcoRI/SacI-digested pSMF1130 (named pSMF11308), and then the SacI fragment of bliApurified from pSMF1130 was inserted into SacI-digested pSMF11308 in the proper orientation (to give pSMF11309). Finally,BglII-BamHI fragments of pSMF1130 and pSMF11309 were cloned into pUC18, and their sequences were confirmed by the dideoxy chain termination method. The plasmids pSMF1130 and pSMF11309 were transformed intoE. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. Overnight culture of each was grown with shaking in 40 ml of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37 °C in the presence of 34.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 50 μg/ml kanamycin. The 40-ml overnight cultures were used to inoculate 2-liter amounts of LB medium containing 34.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 50 μg/ml kanamycin. The cultures were then grown with shaking at 37 °C untilA 600 = 0.5–0.7. For induction, IPTG was added to each culture to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the cultures were then allowed to grow an additional 3 h. Following the 3-h induction, the cells were harvested and resuspended in 50 ml of ice-cold binding buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 500 mm NaCl). The cells were then sonicated to disrupt the cells and shear chromosomal DNA, and insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation. The insoluble material was resuspended in 50 ml of binding buffer containing 6 m urea, and any residual insoluble material was removed by ultracentrifugation after 1-h incubation at 4 °C. The supernatant was purified using a 1-ml HisTrap column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) under denaturing conditions according to the manufacturer's instructions. Binding buffer containing 10 mm imidazole was utilized to remove loosely bound protein from the column. His-tagged rBLIP-I and His-tagged D49A mutant were eluted using binding buffer containing 200 mmimidazole, pH 8.0. The purified His-tagged proteins were cleaved by enterokinase (Novagen) to remove the His tag, and then rBLIP-I and D49A mutant were purified by a Mono Q chromatography. Fractions were examined by SDS-PAGE to estimate purity and yield. β-Lactamase inhibitory activity of culture broth or samples collected during purification was analyzed at pH 7.0 and 37 °C by the modified iodometric assay method (35.Sawai T. Takahashi T. Yamagashi S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1978; 13: 910-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). β-Lactamase inhibitory activity was calculated as follows: β-lactamase inhibitory activity (%) = ((A − B)/A) × 100, whereA is the β-lactamase activity without the inhibitor, andB is the β-lactamase activity with the inhibitor. One unit of β-lactamase inhibitory activity was defined as the amount of inhibitor needed for 50% inhibition of 10,000 IU of Bactopenase (Difco). Kinetic parameters of BLIP-I, rBLIP-I, and the D49A mutant were determined by fitting the data to the equation of Dennis and co-workers (21.Petrosino J. Rudgers G. Gilbert H. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2394-2400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 36.Dennis M.S. Lazarus R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22129-22136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or Lineweaver-Burk plot. Varying concentrations of BLIP-I were incubated with 1 nm preparations of various β-lactamases for 2 h at 25 °C in 0.05 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Following the 2-h incubation, cephaloridine was added to a concentration of 10–200 μm. The final volume for the reaction was 2.5 ml. Hydrolysis of cephaloridine was monitored atA 260 on a Shimazu UV-160 spectrophotometer. The extinction coefficient used for cephaloridine was Δε = 10,200m−1 cm−1 (37.Cantu III, C. Huang W. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22538-22545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Plots of the concentration of free β-lactamase versus inhibitor concentration were fitted by nonlinear regression analysis to the equation. From the equation, apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (K i*) were determined (21.Petrosino J. Rudgers G. Gilbert H. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2394-2400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 36.Dennis M.S. Lazarus R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22129-22136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AbliA::hyg mutant of S. exfoliatus SMF19 was constructed by inserting a hygromycin resistance (hyg) gene into the middle of bliA. A 2-kb KpnI-XhoI fragment from pSMF1101 containing the complete bliA gene together with 800 bp of upstream and 800 bp of downstream sequence was subcloned into pZErO-2, creating pSMF11041. The hyg gene from pJOE829 was amplified by PCR. The primers are BLIPDIS1 (a top strand primer), 5′-GTCGCACAATTGGGCGGTGGCGTACACCGT-3′, and BLIPDIS2 (a bottom strand primer), 5′-GAGCTGCAATTGAAGCTCGGCCGACCACCC-3′, which are designed to contain an MfeI site at the ends of the amplified PCR fragment. The resulting PCR product was digested withMfeI and then was inserted into the EcoRI site of pSMF11041, creating pSMF11042. A 3.5-kb KpnI-SphI fragment from pSMF11042 was ligated toKpnI/SphI-digested pIJ702, and then transformed into S. lividans. A transformant able to grow in TSB medium containing hygromycin (50 μg ml−1) and thiostrepton (50 μg ml−1) was selected. The plasmid from the colony, pSMF11043, was purified and introduced into S. exfoliatusSMF19 by transformation. A disruption mutant defective inbliA gene resulting from gene conversion by homologous recombination was isolated as described by Aidoo et al. (38.Aidoo K.A. Wong A. Alexander D.C. Rittammer R.A.R. Jensen S.E. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 147: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The transformant harboring pSMF11043 was cultured in minimal medium containing only hygromycin (50 μg ml−1) for 5 rounds, and then the recombinants of Hygr and thiostrepton-sensitive (Thios) colonies unable to grow in the minimal medium containing thiostrepton (50 μg ml−1) were selected as disruption mutants. The insertional inactivation ofbliA was confirmed by Southern hybridization using the 1.2-kb EcoRI-KpnI fragment labeled with the ECL direct nucleic acid labeling system as a probe. A new β-lactamase inhibitory protein (BLIP-I) was purified from the culture supernatant of S. exfoliatus SMF19. Final recovery of BLIP-I upon complete purification was 29.8% with a purification fold of 36.1 (Table I). The mass was estimated to be 17.5 kDa by gel filtration FPLC, and the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified BLIP-I was determined to be NH2-Asn-Ser-Gly-Phe-Ser-Ala-Glu-Lys-Tyr-Glu-Gln-Ile-Gln-Phe-Gly. Purified BLIP-I from S. exfoliatus SMF19 was clearly separable from BLIP-II, indicating that S. exfoliatus SMF19 produced two different BLIPs (Fig. 1,A and B).Table IPurification of BLIP-ISampleTotal BLIPTotal proteinSpecific activityYieldPurificationunitsaOne unit of BLIP-I activity is defined as that amount of material that gives 50% inhibition of 10,000 IU Bactopenase used in the standard spectrophotometer β-lactamase inhibition assay.mgunits/mg protein%-foldCulture filtrate410,500520.0789.4100.01.0Ammonium sulfate369,000442.0834.889.91.1Hydroxyapatite350,500247.01419.085.41.8DEAE-Sephadex150,73698.81525.736.71.9Superdex-75138,67511.811752.133.814.9Mono Q128,9707.716749.431.421.2Resource-PHE122,5124.328491.229.836.1a One unit of BLIP-I activity is defined as that amount of material that gives 50% inhibition of 10,000 IU Bactopenase used in the standard spectrophotometer β-lactamase inhibition assay.

https://openalex.org/W1994840728,"MelR is an Escherichia colitranscription factor that activates expression of the melABoperon in response to the presence of melibiose in the environment. MelR stimulates transcription initiation at the melABpromoter by binding to four sites centered at positions −120.5, −100.5, −62.5, and −42.5 upstream of the transcript start point. In a previous study, we described a spontaneous mutant that exhibited increased melAB expression. Sequence analysis showed that this mutant carries five consecutive base changes at positions −49, −50, −51, −52, and −53 upstream of the melAB transcript start. Here we show that these changes improve MelR binding to the target site centered at position −42.5 at the melABpromoter and that this improvement is responsible for increased promoter activity. Thus, the activity of the melAB promoter is fixed by the occupation by MelR of a DNA site that overlaps the −35 hexamer: MelR appears to be a typical class II-type transcription activator.

RNA polymerase holoenzyme polymerase chain reaction Melibiose metabolism by Escherichia coli is contingent on expression of the melA and melB genes, that are cotranscribed from a single promoter in response to the presence of melibiose in the growth medium: melA encodes an α-galactosidase, whereas melB encodes a melibiose transporter (1.Prestidge L. Pardee A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 100: 591-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 2.Schmitt R. J. Bacteriol. 1968; 96: 462-471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Levinthal M. J.

An unusual feature of E. coli K12 strains is that they are able to metabolize melibiose at 30 °C, but they become progressively less able to metabolize melibiose at temperatures above 37 °C, due to thermal lability of themelB melibiose transporter (6.Tsuchiya T. Lopilato J. Wilson T. J. Membr. Biol. 1976; 42: 45-59Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In recent work (7.Tamai E. Shimamoto T. Tsuda M. Mizushima T. Tsuchiya T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16860-16864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), we have studied the W3133-2 mutant that is able to grow at higher temperatures with melibiose as the sole carbon source. Although we had expected that the melB gene in this mutant would be altered in some way, we found that the W3133-2 mutant carried five consecutive base changes in the melAB promoter. We showed that these changes led to an increase in expression of the melAB operon at all temperatures and that this increase, apparently, could compensate for the thermolability of the melB melibiose transporter (7.Tamai E. Shimamoto T. Tsuda M. Mizushima T. Tsuchiya T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16860-16864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The principal objective of the work presented here has been to understand the effects of the base changes in the W3133-2 mutant. Transcription initiation at the melAB promoter is totally dependent on MelR, a melibiose-triggered transcription activator (8.Webster C. Gardner L. Busby S. Gene. 1989; 83: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). MelR is encoded by the melR gene, which is located immediately upstream of the melA gene, and transcribed from a promoter that is divergent from the melAB promoter (the transcription start points of the melAB and melRpromoters are 237 bases apart; see Fig. 1) (9.Webster C. Gaston K. Busby S. Gene. 1988; 68: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). MelR is a member of the AraC family of transcription factors and binds to 18-base pair target sequences (10.Williams J. Michán C. Webster C. Busby S. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). At the melAB promoter, MelR binds to four such target sequences: site 1′, site 1, site 2, and site 2′ centered at positions −120.5, −100.5, −62.5, and −42.5, respectively, upstream of the melAB transcript start point (Fig. 1). Recent studies (11.Belyaeva T. Wade J. Webster C. Howard V. Thomas M. Hyde E. Busby S. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) have shown that the occupation of site 2′ by MelR is the most crucial for the activation of the melAB promoter, but that, of the four target sites, site 2′ binds MelR most weakly. We noted that the base changes in the melAB promoter in the W3133-2 mutant changed the DNA sequence of MelR binding site 2′ such that it corresponded better to the tighter binding site 1′, site 1, and site 2. This suggested that the increased melAB expression in the W3133-2 mutant could be due to better binding of MelR to site 2′. In the work reported here, we prove that this is indeed the case, by studying the binding of purified MelR and purified RNA polymerase holoenzyme (RNAP)1 to DNA fragments carrying the melAB promoter from both the wild type and W3133-2 mutant strain Plasmids pBM3133, carrying the entire wild type mel operon, and pBM3133-2, carrying the mel operon from the W3133-2 mutant, were described in our previous study (7.Tamai E. Shimamoto T. Tsuda M. Mizushima T. Tsuchiya T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16860-16864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar).EcoRI-HindIII fragments, carrying the wild type or mutant mel operon regulatory region, were derived using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using pBM3133 or pBM3133-2 as templates. The KK81 fragment, carrying an EcoRI site at position −312 with respect to the melAB transcript start, and a HindIII site at +36 was generated using the primers 5′-GCAGAATTCCGGGCTGCGGGT-3′ and 5′-GCAAAGCTTGGATGCAGGTCGACGGATCTC-3′ (see Fig. 1). The shorter JK14 fragment, with an EcoRI site at position −94 with respect to the melAB transcript start, and a HindIII site at +36, was made with the primers 5′-GCAGAATTCGATTTACTGCTGCTTCACG-3′ and 5′-GCAAAGCTTGGATGCAGGTCGACGGATCTC-3′ (see Fig. 1). PCR products carrying wild type or W3133-2 mutant sequences were restricted with EcoRI and HindIII and cloned either into plasmid vectors pSR (12.Kolb A. Kotlarz D. Kusano S. Ishihama A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) or pRW50 (13.Lodge J. Fear J. Busby S. Gunaseker P. Kamini N-R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 95: 271-276Crossref Google Scholar). The KK81 or JK14EcoRI-HindIII fragments containing the wild type or mutant melAB promoters were cloned into pRW50, a low copy number lac expression vector (13.Lodge J. Fear J. Busby S. Gunaseker P. Kamini N-R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 95: 271-276Crossref Google Scholar), to generatepmelAB::lac fusions. Recombinant plasmids were propagated in strain WAM131 (11.Belyaeva T. Wade J. Webster C. Howard V. Thomas M. Hyde E. Busby S. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), an mel+ strain derived from GM-1 (14.Coulondre C. Miller J. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 117: 525-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase levels in these cells were measured using the method of Miller (15.Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar): cells were grown in media either with or without melibiose exactly as in our previous work (5.Webster C. Kempsell K. Booth I. Busby S. Gene. 1987; 59: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the histidine-tagged variant used here (MelRH), the carboxyl terminus of the MelR is extended by 7 amino acid residues, including 6 tandem histidines; the full sequence of this extension is (in single-letter code) IHHHHHH. To construct modified melR encoding the MelRH, we started with plasmid pBM3133 (7.Tamai E. Shimamoto T. Tsuda M. Mizushima T. Tsuchiya T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16860-16864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), in which the melibiose operon was cloned into the EcoRI site of pBR322. To insert a unique NdeI site at the initiation codon site of themelR gene and to remove the termination codon ofmelR, we used PCR mutagenesis using the primer melR(N-NdeI) (5′-ACATATGAATACAGATACGTTTATG-3′) and melR(C) (5′-GCCGGGAAACGTCTGGCG-3′). The amplified DNA fragment was cloned into the EcoRV site of plasmid pBF4-11, 2E. Tamai, unpublished data. which possesses a DNA sequence encoding 6 tandem histidines after the EcoRV site in pBluescript II SK(+). In the final step, anNdeI-BamHI fragment from the resulting plasmid was ligated to pET30a, a T7 expression vector obtained from Novagen, and digested with NdeI and BamHI. This generated plasmid pETRH, in which the encoded protein acquired the extension of 7 amino acid residues noted above. The construction was organized such that overexpressed product was initiated at the melR AUG initiation codon. A control plasmid, pETR, carrying authenticmelR, was constructed using a similar strategy with melR(BamHI) (5′-TGGATCCTTAGCCGGGAAACGTCTG-3′) as a PCR primer and pBluescript II SK(+) as a vector instead of melR(C) and pBF4-11, respectively. BL21(DE3) cells (from Novagen) harboring pETRH were used to overexpress His-tagged MelR protein. Cells from an overnight culture were diluted 50-fold into fresh M9 medium supplemented with 0.4% glucose, 0.2% casamino acid, and 60 mg/liter of kanamycin (200 ml), and grown at 37 °C for 3–4 h. After the optical density at 650 nm reached 0.8, addition of 1 mmisopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside allowed induction of MelRH during the following 3- to 4-h incubation. All subsequent work was done at 4 °C. After cells were harvested by centrifugation, and they were resuspended 10 ml of sonication buffer (100 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 8.3, 200 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA) and subjected to lysis by ultrasonication (15 s × 12 times with 10-s intervals). After centrifugation at 22,500 × g for 20 min, inclusion body was resuspended in the same volume of the sonication buffer containing 4% Triton X-100 and recentrifuged at 22,500 × g for 20 min. The inclusion body was washed twice with the sonication buffer, and finally the inclusion body was solubilized in 10 ml of solubilization buffer (100 mmpotassium phosphate, 200 mm KCl, 6 mguanidine-HCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3). After centrifugation at 22,500 ×g for 20 min, the supernatant fraction was kept at −20 °C until use. For protein purification, we used 0.5-ml bed-volume amounts of Ni2+-agarose (Qiagen). The resin equilibrated with the solubilization buffer was added to 9.5 ml of the solubilized protein and kept for 30 min with gentle shaking to allow for binding of MelRH. The mixture was then placed in a column, unbound material was collected by gravity elution, and the column was washed with 10 ml of the solubilization buffer (pH 8.0). After nonspecifically bound material had been removed, MelRH was eluted with the solubilization buffer (pH 6.3). The eluted protein was dialyzed against a 50-fold volume of dialysis buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA) four times. The dialyzed protein was concentrated by using Microcon 10 or Centricon 10 (Amicon). The purified protein was stored at −70 °C until use. To measure in vitro transcription initiation, we used the pSR plasmid vector (12.Kolb A. Kotlarz D. Kusano S. Ishihama A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), which carries the bacteriophage λ oop transcription terminator just downstream of the EcoRI andHindIII cloning sites. Transcription experiments were performed using the protocols described by Kolb et al. (12.Kolb A. Kotlarz D. Kusano S. Ishihama A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The KK81 or JK14 EcoRI-HindIII fragments containing the wild type or mutant melAB promoters were cloned into pSR such that transcripts initiating at themelAB promoter would run to the λ oopterminator. The resulting recombinants were purified by cesium chloride centrifugation and used as template for RNA synthesis. The preincubation mixtures contained 10 nm supercoiled plasmid DNA template in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Up to 1500 nm MelR and 10 mm melibiose (as appropriate) were added and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The incubation was continued with the addition of 20 nm purified RNAP (supplied by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for a further 5 min, prior to the addition of 200 μm ATP, CTP, and GTP, 10 μmα-32P-labeled UTP, and 100 μg/ml heparin. After an additional 5-min incubation, 32P-labeled RNA was analyzed on calibrated polyacrylamide sequencing gels. Transcription initiation at the melAB promoter gives rise to an easily detectable discrete transcript that terminates at the oop terminator, with the control RNA I from the pSR ColE1 origin acting as an internal control. Transcripts were quantified with the aid of a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Starting with plasmid pBM3133 or pBM3133-2 as templates, PCR was used to amplify DNA fragments covering MelR binding sites 1′, 1, 2, and 2′ (ET1) from the wild typemelAB promoter or the W3133-2 mutant. To do this, we used the −160 primer (5′-CGAGGGGACTCTCCGAGTATC-3′) together with the −10 primer (5′-TAACTTCATCATGGCAGGCGA-3′) shown schematically in Fig. 1. Before the PCR reaction, the −160 primer was end-labeled with32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeled PCR product was used as a probe in gel retardation assays. Incubation mixtures contained 32P-labeled DNA probe and purified His-tagged MelR in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA, 10 mmmelibiose, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After incubation for 5 min at 37 °C, samples were applied to 5% polyacrylamide gels that were run in standard Tris-borate/EDTA electrophoresis buffer at 150 V. After electrophoresis, gels were fixed, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. Gel retardation assays were also performed with the shorter ET2 and ET3 probes illustrated in Fig.1. These probes were made by annealing the appropriate complementary oligos after 5′-end labeling with 32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase. These experiments were performed with EcoRI-HindIII fragments carrying the wild type or mutant mel operon regulatory region using previously described protocols (16.Savery, N., Belyaeva, T., and Busby, S. (1996) Essential Techniques: Gene Transcription (Docherty, K., ed) pp. 1–5, 21–33, BIOS Scientific Publishers, OxfordGoogle Scholar). Incubations contained 4–10 nm of the purified fragment that had been specifically radiolabeled at the HindIII end using [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase, and different amounts of purified His-tagged MelR and melibiose as indicated. After DNase I treatment, footprint patterns were analyzed on polyacrylamide sequencing gels that were calibrated with Maxam-Gilbert sequence ladders. In our previous work, we described the W3133-2 mutant that results from five consecutive base changes in the melAB promoter (7.Tamai E. Shimamoto T. Tsuda M. Mizushima T. Tsuchiya T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16860-16864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To study the effects of these changes in vitro, we subclonedEcoRI-HindIII DNA fragments carrying the wild type or W3133-2 mutant melAB promoter sequences (Fig.1). First, using PCR, we amplified the KK81 fragment that carries the entire melAB promoter with all four MelR binding sites (sites 1′, 1, 2, and 2′) that are known to be essential for optimal melAB promoter activity (10.Williams J. Michán C. Webster C. Busby S. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 11.Belyaeva T. Wade J. Webster C. Howard V. Thomas M. Hyde E. Busby S. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Second, we amplified the shorter JK14 fragment that carries themelAB transcript start site and only the MelR binding sites 2 and 2′. In preliminary experiments, we checked the activity of themelAB promoter carried by these fragments. To do this, the different EcoRI-HindIII fragments were cloned into the broad host range lac fusion vector, pRW50, and the resulting plasmids were transformed into WAM131, a Δlac mel+ strain derived from GM-1 (11.Belyaeva T. Wade J. Webster C. Howard V. Thomas M. Hyde E. Busby S. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 14.Coulondre C. Miller J. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 117: 525-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Expression of the promoter melAB::lacZ fusions carried by the pRW50 recombinants was measured in transformants grown either with or without the inducer, melibiose. The results, listed in Table I, indicate that, with the longer KK81 fragment, expression from the melAB promoter is clearly induced by melibiose and that the W3133-2 mutant promoter is 8- to 9-fold more active than the wild type promoter. With the shorter JK14 fragment, the removal of MelR binding sites 1′ and 1 results in a 4-fold reduction in expression of the melAB promoter. However, in contrast, with the W3133-2 mutant, melABpromoter activity is only slightly affected by removal of MelR binding sites 1′ and 1. Thus, the base changes in the W3133-2 mutant result in a >20-fold increase in melAB promoter activity in the context of the shorter JK14 fragment. These results show that the effects of the base changes in the W3133-2 mutant are easily detected in short fragments and encouraged us to attempt in vivostudies.Table ITranscription activation of the melAB promoterDNA fragmentβ-Galactosidase activity− Melibiose+ MelibioseunitsKK81 (wild type)344KK81 (mutant)6363JK14 (wild type)011JK14 (mutant)5239β-Galactosidase activities (in Miller units) were measured in WAM131 cells containing pRW50 carrying the KK81 or JK14 fragments with the wild type or W3133–2 mutant melAB promoter sequences.

Cells were grown in minimal media with fructose as a carbon source either with or without melibiose exactly as in our previous work (5.Webster C. Kempsell K. Booth I. Busby S.

Open table in a new tab β-Galactosidase activities (in Miller units) were measured in WAM131 cells containing pRW50 carrying the KK81 or JK14 fragments with the wild type or W3133–2 mutant melAB promoter sequences. The measured activities are indicative of the expression ofmelAB promoter::lac fusions carried by the pRW50 derivatives. Cells were grown in minimal media with fructose as a carbon source either with or without melibiose exactly as in our previous work (5.Webster C. Kempsell K. Booth I. Busby S. Gene. 1987; 59: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Data shown are the average values from three independent experiments. To performin vitro study, we needed to purify MelR. However, the published method for purification of MelR required a large amount of medium and a complicated column works (20.Caswell R. Williams J. Lyddiatt A. Busby S. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, we employed Ni2+ affinity chromatography for the purification and T7 expression system for overexpression of MelR. First we constructed a plasmid that carries a derivative melR encoding MelR with the carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine tag (MelRH). The derivativemelR gene is located downstream from the T7 promoter. To confirm that the MelRH is functional in vivo, aXbaI-EcoRI fragment, which carries a Shine-Dalgarno sequence was subcloned from pETRH or pETR into pMW119, in which expression of melRH or melR is controlled by the lac promoter. A MelR-defective mutant, Y1089 (ΔmelR) (19.Bourgerie S. Michán C. Thomas M. Busby S. Hyde E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1685-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), harboring either one of the constructed plasmids, formed similar red colonies on a MacConkey-melibiose (5 mm) plate (data not shown). This result indicates that the MelRH worked as a transcription activator for the melibiose operon in vivo. Other results from gel retardation assay and in vitro transcription assay done with MelR or MelRH indicated that MelRH had almost the same DNA binding affinity and transcription activation activity as wild type MelR (data not shown). For overexpression of MelRH, we used the T7 system. We tested several media and found that M9 medium increased the expression level of our target protein and reduced background proteins. The MelRH protein produced in BL21(DE3)/pETRH after addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside reached about 10–20% of total cell protein. However, most of the overproduced MelRH protein formed inclusion body. The advantage of this preparation was that the MelRH in the inclusion body was more than 80% pure without any column works. The inclusion body was solubilized with 6 m guanidine buffer and purified using Ni2+-agarose. The purified protein was renatured by dialysis and then concentrated by ultrafiltration. When concentration of the purified MelRH was high, precipitation occurred during dialysis and most protein bound to filter during ultrafiltration. Our protocol yielded 500 μg of ≥95% pure His-tagged MelR from 200 ml of culture. This amount is enough forin vitro analysis. The renatured MelRH showed almost identical transcription activation activity as that observed with MelR purified by the method reported previously (19.Bourgerie S. Michán C. Thomas M. Busby S. Hyde E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1685-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) without denaturation (data not shown). It is important to test whether the results obtained in thein vivo system (Table I and Ref. 7.Tamai E. Shimamoto T. Tsuda M. Mizushima T. Tsuchiya T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16860-16864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) are reproducible in thein vitro system. To do this, we clonedEcoRI-HindIII DNA fragments carrying the wild type or W3133-2 mutant melAB promoter sequences into the pSR vector plasmid, which carries the bacteriophage λ ooptranscription terminator just downstream of the HindIII site (12.Kolb A. Kotlarz D. Kusano S. Ishihama A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The resulting recombinant plasmids were used to monitor MelR-dependent activation at the melAB promoter;i.e. transcripts initiating at the melAB promoter run to the λ oop terminator and give discrete transcripts that are easy to detect by gel electrophoresis. In addition, because pSR contains a ColE1 replication origin, the RNA I transcript can be used as an internal control to aid quantification of MelR-dependent transcripts. Fig.2 shows the results from a typical experiment, where purified RNAP, together with purified MelR and melibiose, was preincubated with purified circular pSR plasmid carrying the JK14 or KK81 insert, prior to the addition of labeled nucleoside triphosphates. Each incubation produces the control RNA I transcript, but a longer transcript originating at the melAB transcript start is seen when the preincubation includes purified MelR and melibiose. With both the JK14 and KK81 inserts, more transcript initiating at the melAB promoter is observed with template from the W3133-2 mutant. We have done three sets of the same experiment and two sets of an experiment in which concentration of RNA polymerase was increased to 150 nm. All of the results were almost identical to the result in Fig. 2. From these experiments, we conclude that the effects of the base changes in the W3133-2 mutant can be reproduced, at least partially, in vitro. It had previously been noted that the base changes in the melAB promoter in the W3133-2 mutant changed the DNA sequence of MelR binding site 2′ such that it corresponded better to the tighter binding sites 1′, 1, and 2. Therefore, gel retardation assays were used to measure the binding of purified MelR to the different sites at the wild type or W3133-2 mutantmelAB promoter. In the first experiment (Fig.3 A), we measured the binding of MelR to ET1 fragments carrying MelR binding sites 1′, 1, 2, and 2′ (the ET1 fragments were made using PCR with the −160 and −10 primers and pBM3133 or pBM3133-2 as templates: see Fig. 1). With the wild type ET1 fragment, four retarded bands are observed, with the most retarded bands appearing at higher MelR concentrations. We attribute these bands to progressive occupation of the four DNA sites for MelR: as expected, the fourth, most retarded band remained quite weak, in agreement with our previous observation that MelR binds weakly to site 2′. However, with the ET1 fragment from the W3133-2 mutant, this fourth retarded band appears much stronger, suggesting that the base changes in the mutant have tightened the binding of MelR to site 2′. The second experiment (Fig. 3 B) with the shorter ET2 fragment, carrying only MelR binding sites 2 and 2′, confirmed this interpretation: with the fragment derived from the wild type melAB promoter, two retarded bands are observed, with only a small amount of the more retarded band appearing at higher MelR concentrations. However, with the ET2 fragment from the W3133-2 mutant, this second more retarded band appears much stronger. Finally, the control experiment (Fig.3 C) with the ET3 fragment carrying only MelR binding site 2 shows just one retarded band that is unaffected by the base changes from the W3133-2 mutant. Note that the version of this fragment derived from the mutant does contain the five base changes (see Fig. 1), but these do not affect MelR binding to site 2. It should also be noted that MelR did not bind to the fragment carrying just site 2′ (data not shown). To confirm the conclusions from gel retardation assays, we used DNase I footprinting to study the binding of purified MelR to the JK14 fragment carrying the wild type or W3133-2 mutant melAB promoter sequences. The results (Fig.4) show that, with the wild typemelAB promoter sequence, MelR affords clear protection of the segment of DNA corresponding to MelR binding site 2. However, even in the presence of melibiose and higher concentrations of MelR, very poor protection of the segment of DNA corresponding to MelR binding site 2′ is observed. However, with the JK14 fragment derived from the W3133-2 mutant, clear protection of both site 2 and site 2′ is seen, even in the absence of melibiose. From our results, we conclude that, as predicted, the five base changes in the melAB promoter of the W3133-2 mutant improve the binding of MelR to site 2′. We suppose that this improvement in MelR binding is responsible for the increasedmelAB promoter activity in the W3133-2 mutant, although we cannot prove that it is solely responsible. In our previous paper, we noted that the five base changes in the W3133-2 mutant create an extended 28-nucleotide inverted repeat at the melAB promoter (7.Tamai E. Shimamoto T. Tsuda M. Mizushima T. Tsuchiya T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16860-16864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We suggested that this inverted repeat might facilitate the formation of a stem-loop structure and that this may be responsible for the increased melAB promoter activity in the W3133-2 mutant. However, our observation that the increased melAB promoter activity is observed even in the absence of MelR binding sites 1′ and 1 (i.e. with the JK14 fragment, which lacks the extended inverted repeat) proves that this cannot be the case. Indeed, the effects of the five base changes are greater with the JK14 fragment: this appears to be because MelR binding to site 2′ is aided by MelR binding to sites 1′ and 1, and thus, in the absence of sites 1 and 1′, improvement of site 2′ has a proportionately greater effect. Taken together, our results show that the activity of themelAB promoter is limited by the binding of MelR to site 2′. Because this site overlaps the −35 hexamer of the melABpromoter, it appears that MelR, like AraC and many other members of the AraC family, may be a typical “Class II” transcription activator (17.Gallegos M.-T. Schleif R. Bairoch A. Hofmann K. Ramos J.-L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 393-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the principal function of the upstream sites 1′ and 1 is to help the occupation of site 2′. Thus, the requirement of sites 1′ and 1 for melAB promoter activity is greatly reduced when MelR binding site 2′ is improved (Table I). It is known that Class II transcription activators function by making a direct contact with Region 4 of the RNAP ς subunit (18.Rhodius V. Busby S. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, the challenge now is to understand the molecular details of the MelR-ς subunit interactions. We thank Victoria Howard, Eva Hyde, and Joseph Wade of The University of Birmingham for many helpful discussions."
