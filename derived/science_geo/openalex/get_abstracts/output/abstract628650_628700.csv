https://openalex.org/W2916332658,"""Topological Quantum Chemistry (TQC) links the chemical and symmetry structure of a given material with its topological properties. This field tabulates the data of the 10398 real-space atomic limits of materials, and solves the compatibility relations of electronic bands in momentum space. A material that is not an atomic limit or whose bands do not satisfy the compatibility relations, is a topological insulator/semimetal. We use TQC to find the topological stoichiometric non-magnetic, ""high-quality'' materials in the world. We develop several code additions to VASP which can compute all characters of all symmetries at all high-symmetry points in the Brillouin Zone (BZ). Using TQC we then develop codes to check which materials in ICSD are topological. Out of 26938 stoichiometric materials in our filtered ICSD database, we find 2861 topological insulators (TI) and 2936 topological semimetals (2505 and 2560 non-f electron, respectively). Our method is uniquely capable to show that none of the TI's found exhibit fragile topology. We partition the topological materials in different physical classes. For the majority of the 5797 ""high-quality'' topological material, we compute: the topological class (equivalence classes of TQC elementary band representations -- equivalent to the topological index), the symmetry(ies) that protects the topological class, the representations at high symmetry points and the direct gap (for insulators), and the topological index. For topological semimetals we then compute whether the system becomes a topological insulator (whose index/class we compute) upon breaking symmetries -- useful for experiments. 2152 more TI's are obtained in this way. For almost all 5065 non-f-electron topological materials, we provide the electronic band structures, allowing the identification of quantitative properties (gaps, velocities). Remarkably, our exhaustive results show that a large proportion ( ~ 24% !) of all materials in nature are topological (confirmed by calculations of ""low-quality'' materials). We confirm the topology of several new materials by Wilson loop calculations. We added an open-source code and end-user button on the Bilbao Crystallographic Server (BCS) which checks the topology of any material. We comment on the chemistry of each compound and sample part of the ""low-quality'' ICSD data to find more materials."""
https://openalex.org/W2884871106,"Topological electronic materials are new quantum states of matter hosting novel linear responses in the bulk and anomalous gapless states at the boundary, and are for scientific and applied reasons under intensive research in physics and in materials sciences. The detection for such materials has so far been hindered by the level of complication involved in the calculation of the so-called topological invariants, and is hence considered a specialized task that requires both experience with materials and expertise with advanced theoretical tools. Here we introduce an effective, efficient and fully automated algorithm in obtaining the topological invariants for all non-magnetic materials that are known to human, based on recently developed principles that allow for exhaustive mappings between the symmetry representation of occupied bands and the topological invariants. Our algorithm requires as input only the occupied-band information (energy and wavefunction) at a handful (up to eight) of high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone, which is readily calculable with any first-principles software. In return, it is capable of providing a detailed topological classification of all non-magnetic materials. Equipped with this method we have scanned through a total of 39519 materials available in structural databases, and found that as many as 8056 of them are actually topological (8889 if spin-orbital coupling is neglected). These are further catalogued into classes of 5005 topological semimetals,1814 topological insulators and 1237 topological crystalline insulators, most of which are new to human knowledge. All the results are available and searchable at http://materiae.iphy.ac.cn/ ."

https://openalex.org/W2917547201,"T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CAR T cells) targeting human CD19 (hCD19) have shown clinical efficacy against B cell malignancies1,2. CAR T cells have been less effective against solid tumours3–5, in part because they enter a hyporesponsive (‘exhausted’ or ‘dysfunctional’) state6–9 triggered by chronic antigen stimulation and characterized by upregulation of inhibitory receptors and loss of effector function. To investigate the function of CAR T cells in solid tumours, we transferred hCD19-reactive CAR T cells into hCD19+ tumour-bearing mice. CD8+CAR+ tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and CD8+ endogenous tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes expressing the inhibitory receptors PD-1 and TIM3 exhibited similar profiles of gene expression and chromatin accessibility, associated with secondary activation of nuclear receptor transcription factors NR4A1 (also known as NUR77), NR4A2 (NURR1) and NR4A3 (NOR1) by the initiating transcription factor NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells)10–12. CD8+ T cells from humans with cancer or chronic viral infections13–15 expressed high levels of NR4A transcription factors and displayed enrichment of NR4A-binding motifs in accessible chromatin regions. CAR T cells lacking all three NR4A transcription factors (Nr4a triple knockout) promoted tumour regression and prolonged the survival of tumour-bearing mice. Nr4a triple knockout CAR tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes displayed phenotypes and gene expression profiles characteristic of CD8+ effector T cells, and chromatin regions uniquely accessible in Nr4a triple knockout CAR tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes compared to wild type were enriched for binding motifs for NF-κB and AP-1, transcription factors involved in activation of T cells. We identify NR4A transcription factors as having an important role in the cell-intrinsic program of T cell hyporesponsiveness and point to NR4A inhibition as a promising strategy for cancer immunotherapy. Transfer of NR4A-deficient T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors is shown to reduce tumour burden and increase survival by shifting T cell transcriptional programs away from exhaustion and towards increased effector function."

Some cannabinoids, the hallmark constituents of Cannabis, and their analogues have been investigated extensively for their potential medical applications2. Certain cannabinoid formulations have been approved as prescription drugs in several countries for the treatment of a range of human ailments3. However, the study and medicinal use of cannabinoids has been hampered by the legal scheduling of Cannabis, the low in planta abundances of nearly all of the dozens of known cannabinoids4, and their structural complexity, which limits bulk chemical synthesis. Here we report the complete biosynthesis of the major cannabinoids cannabigerolic acid, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, cannabidiolic acid, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabivarinic acid and cannabidivarinic acid in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, from the simple sugar galactose. To accomplish this, we engineered the native mevalonate pathway to provide a high flux of geranyl pyrophosphate and introduced a heterologous, multi-organism-derived hexanoyl-CoA biosynthetic pathway5. We also introduced the Cannabis genes that encode the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of olivetolic acid6, as well as the gene for a previously undiscovered enzyme with geranylpyrophosphate:olivetolate geranyltransferase activity and the genes for corresponding cannabinoid synthases7,8. Furthermore, we established a biosynthetic approach that harnessed the promiscuity of several pathway genes to produce cannabinoid analogues. Feeding different fatty acids to our engineered strains yielded cannabinoid analogues with modifications in the part of the molecule that is known to alter receptor binding affinity and potency9. We also demonstrated that our biological system could be complemented by simple synthetic chemistry to further expand the accessible chemical space. Our work presents a platform for the production of natural and unnatural cannabinoids that will allow for more rigorous study of these compounds and could be used in the development of treatments for a variety of human health problems."
https://openalex.org/W2916738215,"T cells become dysfunctional when they encounter self antigens or are exposed to chronic infection or to the tumour microenvironment1. The function of T cells is tightly regulated by a combinational co-stimulatory signal, and dominance of negative co-stimulation results in T cell dysfunction2. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie this dysfunction remain unclear. Here, using an in vitro T cell tolerance induction system in mice, we characterize genome-wide epigenetic and gene expression features in tolerant T cells, and show that they are distinct from effector and regulatory T cells. Notably, the transcription factor NR4A1 is stably expressed at high levels in tolerant T cells. Overexpression of NR4A1 inhibits effector T cell differentiation, whereas deletion of NR4A1 overcomes T cell tolerance and exaggerates effector function, as well as enhancing immunity against tumour and chronic virus. Mechanistically, NR4A1 is preferentially recruited to binding sites of the transcription factor AP-1, where it represses effector-gene expression by inhibiting AP-1 function. NR4A1 binding also promotes acetylation of histone 3 at lysine 27 (H3K27ac), leading to activation of tolerance-related genes. This study thus identifies NR4A1 as a key general regulator in the induction of T cell dysfunction, and a potential target for tumour immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2917237457,"The extracellular matrix is a major component of the local environment—that is, the niche—that determines cell behaviour1. During metastatic growth, cancer cells shape the extracellular matrix of the metastatic niche by hydroxylating collagen to promote their own metastatic growth2,3. However, only particular nutrients might support the ability of cancer cells to hydroxylate collagen, because nutrients dictate which enzymatic reactions are active in cancer cells4,5. Here we show that breast cancer cells rely on the nutrient pyruvate to drive collagen-based remodelling of the extracellular matrix in the lung metastatic niche. Specifically, we discovered that pyruvate uptake induces the production of α-ketoglutarate. This metabolite in turn activates collagen hydroxylation by increasing the activity of the enzyme collagen prolyl-4-hydroxylase (P4HA). Inhibition of pyruvate metabolism was sufficient to impair collagen hydroxylation and consequently the growth of breast-cancer-derived lung metastases in different mouse models. In summary, we provide a mechanistic understanding of the link between collagen remodelling and the nutrient environment in the metastatic niche. Exogenous pyruvate is needed for breast cancer cells to form metastases, and the inhibition of pyruvate metabolism impairs collagen hydroxylation and the growth of lung metastases in different mouse models."

https://openalex.org/W2916899099,"Bites of Anopheles mosquitoes transmit Plasmodium falciparum parasites that cause malaria, which kills hundreds of thousands of people every year. Since the turn of this century, efforts to prevent the transmission of these parasites via the mass distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets have been extremely successful, and have led to an unprecedented reduction in deaths from malaria1. However, resistance to insecticides has become widespread in Anopheles populations2–4, which has led to the threat of a global resurgence of malaria and makes the generation of effective tools for controlling this disease an urgent public health priority. Here we show that the development of P. falciparum can be rapidly and completely blocked when female Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes take up low concentrations of specific antimalarials from treated surfaces—conditions that simulate contact with a bed net. Mosquito exposure to atovaquone before, or shortly after, P. falciparum infection causes full parasite arrest in the midgut, and prevents transmission of infection. Similar transmission-blocking effects are achieved using other cytochrome b inhibitors, which demonstrates that parasite mitochondrial function is a suitable target for killing parasites. Incorporating these effects into a model of malaria transmission dynamics predicts that impregnating mosquito nets with Plasmodium inhibitors would substantially mitigate the global health effects of insecticide resistance. This study identifies a powerful strategy for blocking Plasmodium transmission by female Anopheles mosquitoes, which has promising implications for efforts to eradicate malaria. Treatment of female Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes with atovaquone causes arrest of the Plasmodium falciparum parasite in the midgut, and this holds promise for malaria eradication in areas with insecticide-resistant mosquito populations."
https://openalex.org/W2916059302,"The realization of robust universal quantum computation with any platform ultimately requires both the coherent storage of quantum information and (at least) one entangling operation between individual elements. The use of continuous-variable bosonic modes as the quantum element is a promising route to preserve the coherence of quantum information against naturally-occurring errors. However, operations between bosonic modes can be challenging. In analogy to the exchange interaction between discrete-variable spin systems, the exponential-SWAP unitary [$\mathbf{U}_{\mathrm{E}}\left(\theta_c\right)$] can coherently transfer the states between two bosonic modes, regardless of the chosen encoding, realizing a deterministic entangling operation for certain $\theta_c$. Here, we develop an efficient circuit to implement $\mathbf{U}_{\mathrm{E}}\left(\theta_c\right)$ and realize the operation in a three-dimensional circuit QED architecture. We demonstrate high-quality deterministic entanglement between two cavity modes with several different encodings. Our results provide a crucial primitive necessary for universal quantum computation using bosonic modes."
https://openalex.org/W2917430324,"Dysregulation of lipid homeostasis is a precipitating event in the pathogenesis and progression of hepatosteatosis and metabolic syndrome. These conditions are highly prevalent in developed societies and currently have limited options for diagnostic and therapeutic intervention. Here, using a proteomic and lipidomic-wide systems genetic approach, we interrogated lipid regulatory networks in 107 genetically distinct mouse strains to reveal key insights into the control and network structure of mammalian lipid metabolism. These include the identification of plasma lipid signatures that predict pathological lipid abundance in the liver of mice and humans, defining subcellular localization and functionality of lipid-related proteins, and revealing functional protein and genetic variants that are predicted to modulate lipid abundance. Trans-omic analyses using these datasets facilitated the identification and validation of PSMD9 as a previously unknown lipid regulatory protein. Collectively, our study serves as a rich resource for probing mammalian lipid metabolism and provides opportunities for the discovery of therapeutic agents and biomarkers in the setting of hepatic lipotoxicity. The integration of liver and plasma quantitative lipidomic and proteomic data from 107 distinct mouse strains provides important insights into regulators of mammalian lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2919219367,"Despite extensive literature on leadership and its impact employee innovative behavior, few studies have explored the relationship between inclusive leadership and employee innovative behavior. To address this gap, this study aimed to investigate how inclusive leadership influenced employee innovative behavior by examining perceived organizational support (POS) as a mediator. We used multi-wave and multi-source data collected at 15 companies in China to test our theoretical model. Results revealed that inclusive leadership had significantly positive effects on POS and employee innovative behavior. Furthermore, POS was positively related to employee innovative behavior and partially mediated the relationship between inclusive leadership and employee innovative behavior. We discussed implications and limitations of this study as well as avenues for future research."
https://openalex.org/W2915668598,"The cytokine interferon-γ (IFNγ) is a central coordinator of innate and adaptive immunity, but its highly pleiotropic actions have diminished its prospects for use as an immunotherapeutic agent. Here, we took a structure-based approach to decoupling IFNγ pleiotropy. We engineered an affinity-enhanced variant of the ligand-binding chain of the IFNγ receptor IFNγR1, which enabled us to determine the crystal structure of the complete hexameric (2:2:2) IFNγ-IFNγR1-IFNγR2 signalling complex at 3.25 Å resolution. The structure reveals the mechanism underlying deficits in IFNγ responsiveness in mycobacterial disease syndrome resulting from a T168N mutation in IFNγR2, which impairs assembly of the full signalling complex. The topology of the hexameric complex offers a blueprint for engineering IFNγ variants to tune IFNγ receptor signalling output. Unexpectedly, we found that several partial IFNγ agonists exhibited biased gene-expression profiles. These biased agonists retained the ability to induce upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class I antigen expression, but exhibited impaired induction of programmed death-ligand 1 expression in a wide range of human cancer cell lines, offering a route to decoupling immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive functions of IFNγ for therapeutic applications."

https://openalex.org/W2917299118,"The GABAB (γ-aminobutyric acid type B) receptor is one of the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain, and it signals through heterotrimeric G proteins to activate a variety of effectors, including G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels (GIRKs)1,2. GABAB-receptor signalling is tightly regulated by auxiliary subunits called KCTDs, which control the kinetics of GIRK activation and desensitization3-5. However, the mechanistic basis for KCTD modulation of GABAB signalling remains incompletely understood. Here, using a combination of X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy, and functional and biochemical experiments, we reveal the molecular details of KCTD binding to both GABAB receptors and G-protein βγ subunits. KCTDs associate with the receptor by forming an asymmetric pentameric ring around a region of the receptor carboxy-terminal tail, while a second KCTD domain, H1, engages in a symmetric interaction with five copies of Gβγ in which the G-protein subunits also interact directly with one another. We further show that KCTD binding to Gβγ is highly cooperative, defining a model in which KCTD proteins cooperatively strip G proteins from GIRK channels to induce rapid desensitization following receptor activation. These results provide a framework for understanding the molecular basis for the precise temporal control of GABAB signalling by KCTD proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2920350379,"Climate change's effect on sea surface temperature (SST) at the regional scale vary due to driving forces that include potential changes in ocean circulation and internal climate variability, ice cover, thermal stability, and ocean mixing layer depth. For a better understanding of future effects, it is important to analyze historical changes in SST at regional scales and test prediction techniques. In this study, the variation in SST across the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman (PG&GO) during the past four decades was analyzed and predicted to the end of 21st century using a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) model. As input, daily optimum interpolation SST anomaly (DOISSTA) data, available from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the United States, were used. Descriptive analyses and POD results demonstrated a gradually increasing trend in DOISSTA in the PG&GO over the past four decades. The spatial distribution of DOISSTA indicated: (1) that shallow parts of the Persian Gulf have experienced minimum and maximum values of DOISSTA and (2) high variability in DOISSTA in shallow parts of the Persian Gulf, including some parts of southern and northwestern coasts. Prediction of future SST using the POD model revealed the highest warming during summer in the entire PG&GO by 2100 and the lowest warming during fall and winter in the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman, respectively. The model indicated that monthly SST in the Persian Gulf may increase by up to 4.3 °C in August by the turn of the century. Similarly, mean annual changes in SST across the PG&GO may increase by about 2.2 °C by 2100."

https://openalex.org/W2915319112,"Culture of human endothelial cells for 10 d in real microgravity onboard the International Space Station modulated more than 1000 genes, some of which are involved in stress response. On Earth, 24 h after exposure to simulated microgravity, endothelial cells up-regulate heat shock protein (HSP) 70. To capture a broad view of endothelial stress response to gravitational unloading, we cultured primary human endothelial cells for 4 and 10 d in the rotating wall vessel, a U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration-developed surrogate system for benchtop microgravity research on Earth. We highlight the crucial role of the early increase of HSP70 because its silencing markedly impairs cell survival. Once HSP70 up-regulation fades away after 4 d of simulated microgravity, a complex and articulated increase of various stress proteins (sirtuin 2, paraoxonase 2, superoxide dismutase 2, p21, HSP27, and phosphorylated HSP27, all endowed with cytoprotective properties) occurs and counterbalances the up-regulation of the pro-oxidant thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP). Interestingly, TXNIP was the most overexpressed transcript in endothelial cells after spaceflight. We conclude that HSP70 up-regulation sustains the initial adaptive response of endothelial cells to mechanical unloading and drives them toward the acquisition of a novel phenotype that maintains cell viability and function through the sequential involvement of different stress proteins.-Cazzaniga, A., Locatelli, L., Castiglioni, S., Maier, J.

https://openalex.org/W2918767663,"Introduction Dementia is a major public health concern but one that continues to be stigmatised. We examine lay knowledge of dementia and attitudes to people with dementia as potential precursors of public anxiety, focusing on the social characteristics associated with (a) the formation of these attitudes, and (b) the perception of the need for restriction and control for people with dementia. Methods Analysis of the 2014 Northern Ireland Life and Times survey, which included questions on knowledge of, attitudes to and personal experience with dementia. We used (a) latent class analysis and (b) logistic regression to examine factors associated with respondent attitudes towards dementia. Results Respondents (n = 1211) had relatively good general knowledge of dementia, but limited knowledge of specific risk factors. Negative perceptions of dementia were mitigated somewhat by personal contact. A high proportion of respondents felt that high levels of control were appropriate for people diagnosed with dementia, even at early stages of the disease. Conclusion Personal antipathy to dementia was highly prevalent despite ongoing public campaigns to increase public awareness of developments in its prevention, treatment and consequent care pathways and hampering efforts to widen social inclusion. Fresh thinking and more resources may be needed to challenge persisting common misapprehension of the condition and the formation of entrenched stigma."

Our aim was two-fold; 1) to investigate the diagnostic pattern and mortality among EMS patients to whom an ambulance was dispatched due to difficulty breathing, and 2) to investigate the initial symptoms and mortality for EMS patients diagnosed with respiratory diseases in hospital.Population-based historic cohort study in the North Denmark Region 2012-2015. We included two patient groups; 1) patients calling the emergency number with breathing difficulty as main symptom, and 2) patients diagnosed with respiratory diseases in hospital following an emergency call. Main outcome was estimated 1- and 30-day mortality rates.There were 3803 patients with the symptom breathing difficulty, nearly half were diagnosed with respiratory diseases 47.3%, followed by circulatory diseases 13.4%, and symptoms and signs 12.0%. The 1-day mortality rate was highest for circulatory diseases, then respiratory diseases and other factors. Over-all 30-day mortality was 13.2%, and the highest rate was for circulatory diseases (17.7%) then respiratory diseases and other factors. A total of 4014 patients were diagnosed with respiratory diseases, 44.8% had the symptom breathing difficulty, 13.4% unclear problems and 11.3%. chest pain/heart disease. 1-day mortality rates were highest for decreased consciousness, then breathing difficulties and unclear problem. Over-all 30-day mortality rates were 12.5%, the highest with symptoms of decreased consciousness (19.1%), then unclear problem and breathing difficulty. There was an overlap of 1797 patients between the two groups.The over-all mortality rates alongside the distribution of symptoms and diagnoses, suggest the breathing difficulty patient group is complex and has severe health problems. These findings may be able to raise awareness towards the patient group, and thereby increase focus on diagnostics and treatment to improve the patient outcome."

It accounts to 50% of maternal death in sub-Saharan Africa and precedes 15% of perinatal deaths worldwide. In this study, we looked at the perinatal outcomes and factors associated with unfavorable perinatal outcomes among women with hypertensive disorders in pregnancy at Wolaita Sodo teaching and referral hospital, southern Ethiopia.A hospital based retrospective cross-sectional study design was employed among women hospitalized for hypertensive disorders in pregnancy. Socio-demographic, obstetrics, clinical laboratory, pregnancy complications and outcome were checked from patient records. Descriptive statistics were used to describe parameters collected from patient records. Bivariate and multiple logistic regressions were done to determine factors associated with unfavorable perinatal outcome. A P-value of less than 0.05 and 95% confidence interval not including 1 were considered statically significant.There were 168 (2.3%) cases of HDP of the total 7, 347 deliveries during the period of the study from January 2014-December 2016. 72.5% of mothers (72.5%) had vaginal delivery and 26.1% had Caesarean Section. This study revealed a perinatal mortality rate of 111.1 per 1000 live births. On bivariate logistic regression variables such as referral status, diastolic blood pressure, ANC use, types of HDP, fetal weight at birth, maternal complication and maternal outcome were found to be associated with unfavorable perinatal outcomes. On multiple logistic regression fetal weight at birth and maternal outcome were found to be an independent predictors of unfavorable perinatal outcome.Our study shows higher perinatal mortality in a tertiary hospital where emergency obstetric and newborn care is set and quality obstetric care is expected. However, tertiary facilities manage difficult cases which can explain the high PMR. But it is high which means there is enough room for improvement. Hence, the referral hospital and neighboring health facilities should give due emphasis for early detection and management of women with HDP."
https://openalex.org/W2918414699,"Chinese Simmental beef cattle are the most economically important cattle breed in China. Estimated breeding values for growth, carcass, and meat quality traits are commonly used as selection criteria in animal breeding. The objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of alternative statistical methods for the estimation of genomic breeding values. Analyses of the accuracy of genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP), BayesB, and elastic net (EN) were performed with an Illumina BovineHD BeadChip on 1,217 animals by applying 5-fold cross-validation. Overall, the accuracies ranged from 0.17 to 0.296 for ten traits, and the heritability estimates ranged from 0.36 to 0.63. The EN (alpha = 0.001) model provided the most accurate prediction, which was also slightly higher (0.2-2%) than that of GBLUP for most traits, such as average daily weight gain (ADG) and carcass weight (CW). BayesB was less accurate for each trait than were EN (alpha = 0.001) and GBLUP. These findings indicate the importance of using an appropriate variable selection method for the genomic selection of traits and suggest the influence of the genetic architecture of the traits we analyzed."
https://openalex.org/W2915998978,"Genome instability is a common feature of tumor cells, and the persistent presence of genome instability is a potential mechanism of tumorigenesis. The E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 is intimately involved in genome instability, but its mechanisms are unclear. Our data demonstrated that the transcription factor HBP1 is a target of MDM2. MDM2 facilitates HBP1 proteasomal degradation by ubiquitinating HBP1, regardless of p53 status, thus attenuating the transcriptional inhibition of HBP1 in the expression of its target genes, such as the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 and histone methyltransferase EZH2, which results in global DNA hypermethylation and histone hypermethylation and ultimately genome instability. The repression of HBP1 by MDM2 finally promotes cell growth and tumorigenesis. Next, we thoroughly explored the regulatory mechanism of the MDM2/HBP1 axis in DNA damage repair following ionizing radiation. Our data indicated that MDM2 overexpression-mediated repression of HBP1 delays DNA damage repair and causes cell death in a p53-independent manner. This investigation elucidated the mechanism of how MDM2 promotes genome instability and enhances tumorigenesis in the absence of p53, thus providing a theoretical and experimental basis for targeting MDM2 as a cancer therapy."

In contrast to other model species, however, limited detailed information is available that characterizes cellulolytic activity and systems in basal hexapod groups. As part of a screening effort to identify insects with highly active cellulolytic systems, we have for the first time, identified species of Zygentoma that displayed the highest relative cellulase activity levels when compared to all other tested insect groups under the experimental conditions, including model species for cellulolytic systems such as termite and cockroach species in Rhinotermitidae (formerly Isoptera) and Cryptocercidae (formerly Blattodea). The goal of the present study was to provide a morphohistological characterization of cellulose digestion and to identify highly active cellulase enzymes present in digestive fluids of Zygentoma species. Morphohistological characterization supported no relevant differences in the digestive system of firebrat (Thermobia domestica) and the gray silverfish (Ctenolepisma longicaudata). Quantitative and qualitative cellulase assays identified the foregut as the region with the highest levels of cellulase activity in both T. domestica and C. longicaudata. However, T. domestica was found to have higher endoglucanase, xylanase and pectinase activities compared to C. longicaudata. Using nano liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC/MS/MS) and a custom gut transcriptome we identified cellulolytic enzymes from digestive fluids of T. domestica. Among the identified enzymes we report putative endoglucanases matching to insect or arthropod enzymes and glucan endo-1,6-β-glucosidases matching bacterial enzymes. These findings support combined activities of endogenous and symbiont-derived plant cell wall degrading enzymes in lignocellulose digestion in Zygentoma and advance our understanding of cellulose digestion in a primitive insect group."
https://openalex.org/W2919583544,"Treatment of multi-drug resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is challenging because it mostly relies on drugs with lower efficacy and greater toxicity than those used for drug-susceptible TB.Aim of the study was to describe the frequency and type of adverse drug reactions in a cohort of MDR-TB patients and their potential impact on treatment outcome.We conducted a retrospective study in a cohort of MDR-TB patients enrolled at a tertiary referral hospital in Italy from January 2008 to December 2016. The records of patients were reviewed for epidemiological, clinical, microbiological and adverse drug reactions data.Seventy-four MDR-TB patients (mean age 32 years, 58.1% males, 2 XDR, 12 pre-XDR TB) were extracted from the Institute data base and included in the retrospective study cohort in the evaluation period (January 2008-December 2016). Median length of treatment duration was 20 months (IQR 14-24). Treatment outcome was successful in 57 patients (77%; 51 cured, 6 treatment completed); one patient died and one failed (2.7% overall); 15 patients were lost to follow-up (20.3%). Sixty-six (89.2%) presented adverse drug reactions during the whole treatment period. Total number of adverse drug reactions registered was 409. Three hundred forty-six (84.6%) were classified as adverse events (AEs) and 63 (15.4%) were serious AEs (SAEs). One third of the total adverse drug reactions (134/409; 32.8%) was of gastrointestinal origin, followed by 47/409 (11.5%) ototoxic drug reactions, thirty-five (8.6%) regarded central nervous system and 33 (8.1%) affected the liver. All 63 SAEs required treatment suspension with 61 SAEs out of 63 (96.8%) occurring during the first six months of treatment. Factors associated with unsuccessful treatment outcome were smoking (p = 0.039), alcohol abuse (p = 0.005) and homeless condition (p = 0.044). Neither the number of antitubercular drugs used in different combinations nor the number of AEs showed significant impact on outcome. Patients who completed the treatment experienced a greater number of AEs and SAEs (p < 0.001) if compared to lost to follow-up patients.Our data demonstrate that, despite the high frequency of adverse drug reactions and long term therapy, the clinical management of MDR-TB patients in a referral center could reach successful treatment according to WHO target, by implementing active and systematic clinical and laboratory assessment to detect, report and manage suspected and confirmed adverse drug reactions."

Results The experimental group had reduction in time to full oral feeds compared to the control group (-4.1 days, HR 1.37 (1.03, 1.82) p = 0.03). In the 29–30 weeks subgroup, infants in the experimental group had a significant reduction in time to discharge (-10 days, HR 1.87 (1.23, 2.84) p < 0.01). This difference was not observed in the 26–28 weeks subgroup. There was no difference in growth, mortality or morbidities between the two groups. Conclusions Patterned, frequency-modulated oro-somatosensory stimulation improves feeding development in premature infants and reduces their length of hospitalization.

https://openalex.org/W2808743239,"Background The generation or persistence of sexual arousal may be compromised when inhibitory processes such as negative emotions, outweigh sexual excitation. Disgust particularly, has been proposed as one of the emotions that may counteract sexual arousal. In support of this view, previous research has shown that disgust priming can reduce subsequent sexual arousal. As a crucial next step, this experimental study tested whether disgust (by means of odor) can also diminish sexual arousal in individuals who are already in a state of heightened sexual excitation. Methodology In this study, participants were all men (N = 78). To elicit sexual arousal, participants watched a pornographic video. Following 4.30 minutes from the start of the video clip, they were exposed to either a highly aversive/disgusting odor (n = 42), or an odorless diluent/solvent (n = 36), that was delivered via an olfactometer, while the pornographic video continued. In both conditions the presentation of the odor lasted 1 second and was repeated 11 times with intervals of 26 seconds. Sexual arousal was indexed by both self-reports and penile circumference. Principal findings The disgusting odor (released when the participants were already sexually aroused) resulted in a significant decrease of both subjective and genital sexual arousal compared to the control (odorless) condition. Significance The finding that the inhibitory effect of disgust was not only expressed in self-report but also expressed on the penile response further strengthens the idea that disgust might hamper behavioral actions motivated by sexual arousal (e.g., poor judgment, coercive sexual behavior). Thus, the current findings indicate that exposure to an aversive odor is sufficiently potent to reduce already present (subjective and) genital sexual arousal. This finding may also have practical relevance for disgust to be used as a tool for self-defence (e.g., Invi Bracelet)."
https://openalex.org/W2917805418,"Two smyd1 paralogues, smyd1a and smyd1b, have been identified in zebrafish. Although Smyd1b function has been reported in fast muscle, its function in slow muscle and the function of Smyd1a, in general, are uncertain. In this study, we generated 2 smyd1a mutant alleles and analyzed the muscle defects in smyd1a and smyd1b single and double mutants in zebrafish. We demonstrated that knockout of smyd1a alone had no visible effect on muscle development and fish survival. This was in contrast to the smyd1b mutant, which exhibited skeletal and cardiac muscle defects, leading to early embryonic lethality. The smyd1a and smyd1b double mutants, however, showed a stronger muscle defect compared with smyd1a or smyd1b mutation alone, namely, the complete disruption of sarcomere organization in slow and fast muscles. Immunostaining revealed that smyd1a; smyd1b double mutations had no effect on myosin gene expression but resulted in a dramatic reduction of myosin protein levels in muscle cells of zebrafish embryos. This was accompanied by the up-regulation of hsp40 and hsp90-α1 gene expression. Together, our studies indicate that both Smyd1a and Smyd1b partake in slow and fast muscle development although Smyd1b plays a dominant role compared with Smyd1a.-Cai, M., Han, L., Liu, L., He, F., Chu, W., Zhang, J., Tian, Z., Du, S.

https://openalex.org/W2920032315,"Background Although achieved development goals on maternal and child health, in the era of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Bangladesh still needs to promote skilled attendance at birth as well as a continuum of care for mothers and babies. How to implement effective interventions by strengthening the community health system also remains as a crucial policy issue. The objective of the proposed study is to evaluate the impact of a community-based intervention as part of a bilateral development aid project on utilization of maternal and neonatal care provided by skilled providers and qualified facilities. Methods A cluster randomized trial was conducted in Kalaroa Upazila of Satkhira District. Community Clinics (CCs) in the study setting were randomly allocated to either intervention or control. We recruited all eligible women covered by CC catchment areas who gave a birth during the past 12 months of data collection at the baseline and end-line surveys. In the intervention areas, three Community Support Groups (CSGs) were developed in each of the CC areas. The members of CSG were trained to identify pregnant women, educate community people on pregnancy related danger signs, and encourage them for utilization of skilled services in the community and health facilities. The primary outcomes were the utilization of services for antenatal care, delivery, postnatal care and sick newborns. Difference-in-Difference (DID) analysis was performed to identify the changes by the intervention with adjustment of cluster effects by generalized mixed effects regression models. Result The major indicators of the utilization of maternal and neonatal care among pregnant women with different wealth status showed significant improvement after the intervention. The impacts of the intervention were in particular significant among the women of 2nd and 3rd quintiles of household wealth status. The use of CCs increased after the intervention and private hospitals / clinics served as the major health providers. The study also identified increased practices of cesarean section. Conclusion The success of the intervention suggests a potential of the government efforts to strengthen the community support system for promotion of safe motherhood. The intervention helps to identify and remove existing and emerging barriers that lie between women and healthcare providers for safe motherhood and continuum of care.

https://openalex.org/W2920667541,"Background Early markers to predict delayed kidney graft function (DGF) may support clinical management. We studied the ability of four biomarkers (neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL), liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP), cystatin C, and YKL-40) to predict DGF after deceased donor transplantation, and their association with early graft function and GFR at three and twelve months. Methods 225 deceased donor kidney transplant recipients were included. Biomarkers were measured using automated assays or ELISA. We calculated their ability to predict the need for dialysis post-transplant and correlated with the estimated time to a 50% reduction in plasma creatinine (tCr50), measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) and estimated GFR (eGFR). Results All biomarkers measured at Day 1, except urinary L-FABP, significantly correlated with tCr50 and mGFR at Day 5. Plasma NGAL at Day 1 and a timed urine output predicted DGF (AUC = 0.91 and AUC 0.98). Nil or only weak correlations were identified between early biomarker levels and mGFR or eGFR at three or twelve months. Conclusion High plasma NGAL at Day 1 predicts DGF and is associated with initial graft function, but may not prove better than P-creatinine or a timed urine output. Early biomarker levels do not correlate with one-year graft function. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01395719"

This study aims to determine HBV and HCV infection prevalence in DM2 patients from Northeast and Southeast Brazil. A total of 537 DM2 patients were included, 194 (36.12%) males and 343 (63.87%) females, with mean age of 57.13±11.49 years. HBV and HCV markers were determined using serological and molecular analysis, and risk factors were evaluated in a subgroup from Southeast (n = 84). Two HBV acute (HBsAg+/anti-HBc -) and one HBV chronic case (HBsAg+/anti-HBc+) were found. Six individuals (1.1%) were isolated anti-HBc, 37 (6.9%) had HBV infection resolved (anti-HBc+/anti-HBs+), 40 (7.4%) were considered HBV vaccinated (anti-HBc-/anti-HBs+). Thirteen patients (2.42%) had anti-HCV and 7 of them were HCV RNA+. In the subgroup, anti-HBc positivity was associated to age and anti-HCV positivity was associated to age, time of diabetes diagnosis, total bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase at bivariate analysis, but none of them was statistically significant at multivariate analysis. As conclusion, low prevalence of HBV and high prevalence HCV was found in DM2 patients."
https://openalex.org/W2920544883,"Most of what we know about parafoveal preprocessing during reading is based on the boundary paradigm in combination with parafoveal masks as a presumably neutral baseline condition. Recent evidence questions the neutrality of the baseline condition by showing that parafoveal masks inflict preview costs. Using a novel, incremental boundary paradigm we studied the effect of parafoveal masks. Manipulating the salience of parafoveal previews, we found that increasing salience of the masks resulted in increasingly longer fixation times on target words, but also on pretarget words—suggesting preview costs. We conclude that the hidden preview costs of parafoveal masks in the classical boundary paradigm inflate the processing times for the baseline condition and hence lead to an overestimation of the preview benefit. Thus, the present study questions the validity of some of the conclusions drawn on the basis of the classical boundary paradigm."
https://openalex.org/W2919317775,"To assess whether a battery of performance markers, both individually and as group, would be sensitive to fatigue, a within group random cross-over design compared multiple variables during seated control and fatigue (repeated sprint cycling) conditions. Thirty-two physically active participants completed a neuromuscular fatigue questionnaire, Stroop task, postural sway, squat jump, countermovement jump, isometric mid-thigh pull and 10 s maximal sprint cycle (Sprintmax) before and after each condition (15 min, 1 h, 24 h and 48 h). In comparison to control, larger neuromuscular fatigue questionnaire total score decrements were observed 15 min (5.20 ± 4.6), 1 h (3.33 ± 3.9) and 24 h (1.83 ± 4.8) after cycling. Similarly, the fatigue condition elicited greater declines than control at 15 min and 1 h post in countermovement jump height (1.67 ± 1.90 cm and 1.04 ± 2.10 cm), flight time-contraction time ratio (0.03 ± 0.06 and 0.05 ± 0.11), and velocity (0.06 ± 0.07 m∙s-1 and 0.04 ± 0.08 m∙s-1). After fatigue, decrements were observed up to 48 h for average Sprintmax cadence (4-6 RPM), up to 24 h in peak Sprintmax cadence (2-5 RPM) and up to 1 h in average and peak Sprintmax power (45 ± 60 W and 58 ± 71 W). Modelling variables in a stepwise regression demonstrated that CMJ height explained 53.2% and 51.7% of 24 h and 48 h Sprintmax average power output. Based upon these data, the fatigue induced by repeated sprint cycling coincided with changes in the perception of fatigue and markers of performance during countermovement and squat jumps. Furthermore, multiple regression modelling revealed that a single variable (countermovement jump height) explained average power output."
https://openalex.org/W2919690114,"T cells expressing invariant γδ antigen receptors (γδ T cells) bridge innate and adaptive immunity and facilitate barrier responses to pathogens. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an upstream mediator of host defense that up-regulates the expression of pattern recognition receptors and sustains inflammatory responses by inhibiting activation-induced apoptosis in monocytes and macrophages. Surprisingly, Mif-/- γδ T cells, when compared with wild type, were observed to produce >10-fold higher levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-17 after stimulation with gram-positive exotoxins. High-IL-17 expression was associated with the characteristic features of IL-17-producing γδ T (γδ17) cells, including expression of IL-23R, IL-1R1, and the transcription factors RORγt and Sox13. In the gram-positive model of shock mediated by toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST-1), Mif-/- mice succumbed to death more quickly with increased pulmonary neutrophil accumulation and higher production of cytokines, including IL-1β and IL-23. Mif-/- γδ T cells also produced high levels of IL-17 in response to Mycobacterium lipomannan, and depletion of γδ T cells improved survival from acutely lethal Mycobacterium infection or TSST-1 administration. These data indicate that MIF deficiency is associated with a compensatory amplification of γδ17 cell responses, with implications for innate immunity and IL-17-mediated pathology in situations such as gram-positive toxic shock or Mycobacterium infection.-Kim, H.

https://openalex.org/W2918989749,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from the destruction of pancreatic β-cells by the immune system, and CD8+ T lymphocytes are critical actors in this autoimmune response. Pancreatic islets are surrounded by a mesh of nervous cells, the peri-insular Schwann cells, which are also targeted by autoreactive T lymphocytes and express specific antigens, such as the neurotrophic factor S100-β. Previous work has shown increased proliferative responses to whole S100-β in both human T1D patients and the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse model. We describe for the first time naturally processed and presented epitopes (NPPEs) presented by class I human leukocyte antigen–A*02:01 (A2.1) molecules derived from S100-β. These NPPEs triggered IFN-γ responses more frequently in both newly diagnosed and long-term T1D patients compared with healthy donors. Furthermore, the same NPPEs are recognized during the autoimmune response leading to diabetes in A2.1-transgenic NOD mice as early as 4 wk of age. Interestingly, when these NPPEs are used to prevent diabetes in this animal model, an acceleration of the disease is observed together with an exacerbation in insulitis and an increase in S100-β-specific cytotoxicity in vaccinated animals.

https://openalex.org/W2919675336,"Therapeutic ineffectiveness involves drug-related therapeutic failure, inefficacy or resistance and has not been sufficiently studied. Objective of our study was to evaluate reporting trends in therapeutic ineffectiveness by year and describe factors affecting therapeutic ineffectiveness using the Korea Adverse Event Reporting System. Proportion of therapeutic ineffectiveness reports was based on total submitted reports between 2000 and 2016. Utilizing 2016 alone, we compared the characteristics of therapeutic ineffectiveness with age group and gender matching by random extraction. We conducted a logistic regression analysis to estimate reporting odds ratios (ROR) and its 95% confidence intervals (CI) for reports by type of reporters, e.g., doctors, pharmacists, or consumers. We presented most frequent reports by the anatomical main groups and therapeutic subgroups according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system. For the 17-years, the proportion of therapeutic ineffectiveness adverse drug reactions reporting ranged from 0.0% to 3.7% between 2000 and 2016. Of 228,939 reports, 2,797 (1.2%) were submitted in 2016. Consumers accounted for 6.92% of reports and doctors accounted for 45.49%, in which, consumers were more likely to report therapeutic ineffectiveness than doctors (adjusted ROR 3.98; 95% CI, 2.92 to 5.41). According to the ATC classification system, ""nervous system"" was the most frequently reported anatomical group (18.7%) and ""parathyroid hormones and analogues"" was reported most frequently in the pharmacological subgroup (23.7%).

https://openalex.org/W2919908695,"Pharmacogenetics studies have identified several allelic variants with the potential to reduce toxicity and improve treatment outcome. The present study was designed to determine if such findings are reproducible in a heterogenous population of patients with lung cancer undergoing therapy with paclitaxel. We designed a prospective multi-institutional study that recruited n = 103 patients receiving paclitaxel therapy with a 5-year follow up. All patients were genotyped using the Drug Metabolizing Enzymes and Transporters (DMET) platform, which ascertains 1931 genotypes in 235 genes. Progression-free survival (PFS) of paclitaxel therapy and clinically-significant paclitaxel toxicities were classified and compared according to genotype. Initial screening revealed eleven variants that are associated with PFS. Of these, seven variants in ABCB11 (rs4148768), ABCC3 (rs1051640), ABCG1 (rs1541290), CYP8B1 (rs735320), NR3C1 (rs6169), FMO6P (rs7889839), and GSTM3 (rs7483) were associated with paclitaxel PFS in a multivariate analysis accounting for clinical covariates. Multivariate analysis revealed four SNPs in VKORC1 (rs2884737), SLC22A14 (rs4679028), GSTA2 (rs6577), and DCK (rs4643786) were associated with paclitaxel toxicities. With the exception of a variant in VKORC1, the present study did not find the same genetic outcome associations of other published research on pharmacogenetics variants that affect paclitaxel outcomes. This finding suggests that prior pharmacogenomics research findings may not be reproduced in the most frequently-diagnosed malignancy, lung cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2920471767,"Background Marinobufagenin (MBG) is an endogenous cardiotonic steroid (CTS) that inhibits the Na+/K+-ATPase. Human MBG is significantly increased in end-stage renal disease and immunization against MBG attenuates cardiovascular fibrosis in a rat model of uremic cardiomyopathy. Mineralocorticoid antagonists (MRA) block MBG binding sites and decrease proteinuria in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. We therefore aimed to investigate the association of MBG and albuminuria, as a marker of renal damage, as well as MBG and decline of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Methods The Graz endocrine causes of hypertension (GECOH) study is a single center study of adults routinely referred for screening of endocrine hypertension. Plasma MBG was measured by an enzyme-linked immunoassay, and in a post-hoc analysis, follow-up creatinine levels were obtained. Patients with proteinuria >3.5g/day at baseline were excluded from further evaluation. Results We measured MBG concentrations in 40 hypertensive subjects and excluded one patient due to pre-existing proteinuria. Plasma MBG was significantly correlated with albuminuria (Spearman ρ = .357; p = .028) and proteinuria (ρ = .336; p = .039). In linear regression analysis, the association remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI (β = .306; p = .036), and for mean systolic blood pressure (β = .352; p = .034). In follow-up analyses (N = 30), MBG was significantly associated with decline in GFR after adjustment for time-to-follow-up (β = -.374; p = .042). Conclusion The findings suggest that MBG plasma concentrations were associated with albuminuria as well as decline in kidney function. Whether MBG predicts hard renal endpoints warrants further investigations."

The aim of this naturally-occurring field experiment was to assess the influence of a non-talking rule on the actual sound level and perception of patients in an outpatient infusion center. In a quasi-randomized trial two conditions were compared in real life. In the control condition, patients (n = 137) were allowed to talk to fellow patients and visitors during the treatment. In the intervention condition patients (n = 126) were requested not to talk to fellow patients and visitors during their treatment. This study measured the actual sound levels in dB(A) as well as patients’ preferences regarding sound and their perceptions of the physical environment, anxiety, and quality of health care. A linear-mixed-model showed a statistically significant, but rather small reduction of the non-talking rule on the actual sound level with an average of 1.1 dB(A). Half of the patients preferred a talking condition (57%), around one-third of the patients had no preference (36%), and 7% of the patients preferred a non-talking condition. Our results suggest that patients who preferred non-talking, perceived the environment more negatively compared to the majority of patients and perceived higher levels of anxiety. Results showed no significant effect of the experimental conditions on patient perceptions. In conclusion, a non-talking rule of conduct only minimally reduced the actual sound level and did not influence the perception of patients."

Methods One hundred and seven children aged 4–14 years with SepAD received one of two cognitive behavioral treatment programs for SepAD (TAFF; TrennungsAngstprogramm Für Familien; English: Separation Anxiety Family Therapy or CC; Coping Cat). Their parents (N = 189; 101 mothers and 88 fathers) were assessed at baseline and post-treatment for symptoms of separation anxiety, general anxiety, and depression. A comparison group of parents (N = 74; 42 mothers and 32 fathers) of 45 children without SepAD, who did not receive any treatment, were also assessed. Results Results indicated a significant interaction effect between group and time on mothers’ depression and separation anxiety, indicating that maternal symptoms of depression and separation anxiety improved in the child treatment condition in comparison to mothers of healthy children. There was no significant improvement in parental pathology levels among fathers of children treated for SepAD. Conclusions Treatment for child SepAD may have subsequent positive effects on mothers’ own levels of separation anxiety and depression, though the mechanisms are yet unknown. Future studies are needed that test the transgenerational effect of child SepAD treatment on parental mental health as the primary research question."

As previously demonstrated, immunization of the submandibular gland with tissue culture-derived murine cytomegalovirus (tcMCMV) or replication-deficient adenoviruses expressing individual murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) genes protected mice against a lethal MCMV challenge. Here, we report that salivary gland inoculation of BALB/cByJ mice with tcMCMV or recombinant adenoviruses differentially activates T helper (Th)1, -2, and -17 cells in the salivary glands vs. the associated lymph nodes. After inoculation with tcMCMV, lymphocytes from the submandibular gland preferentially express the transcription factor T-cell-specific T-box transcription factor (T-bet), which controls the expression of the hallmark Th1 cytokine, IFN-γ. Lymphocytes from the periglandular lymph nodes (PGLNs) express both T-bet and GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA3), which promotes the secretion of IL-4, -5, and -10 from Th2 cells. In contrast, after inoculation with replication-deficient adenoviruses, lymphocytes from the submandibular gland express T-bet, GATA3, and RAR-related orphan receptor γ, thymus-specific isoform (RORγt) (required for differentiation of Th17 cells) and forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) (required for the differentiation of regulatory T cells). Lymphocytes from the PGLNs were not activated.

However, this issue has not yet been researched regarding colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. With our study, we aimed to examine the relationship between people's goal-orientation or focus on advantages or disadvantages and their CRC screening participation, as this could provide insights for supporting people in making this complex decision.An online survey was carried out among a sample of first-time CRC screening invitees (1282 respondents, response rate 49%). We assessed people's goal-orientation (i.e. promotion-orientation and prevention-orientation), focus on the advantages or disadvantages of CRC screening, screening participation and main considerations (e.g. cancer is a serious illness) concerning their screening decision.Generally, CRC screening participants scored higher on both promotion-orientation and prevention-orientation than non-participants. Both CRC screening participation and non-participation were not associated with a dominant goal-orientation. CRC screening participants did show a dominant focus on the advantages of CRC screening. Mediation analysis showed support for our premise that the relationship between people's goal-orientation or focus on advantages or disadvantages and their screening participation could be (partially) mediated by people's main considerations concerning CRC screening.CRC screening participants and non-participants differed in their goal-orientation and focus on advantages or disadvantages. CRC screening participation appears to be associated with a focus on the advantages of CRC screening, which could impede the making of an informed decision. CRC screening non-participation appears not to be associated with any clear goal-orientation or focus, or we have not yet managed to capture this, which could be either beneficial or problematic for making an informed decision."

Methodology Descriptive, cross-sectional study of secondary data. Measurements were taken with a calibrated pulse oximeter; our participants resided in host cities for more than 2 months and underwent clinical evaluations by physicians. The results were categorized according to their age group and the altitude of residence using centile charts. Results Our sample size consisted of 6,289 subjects across different villages in Peru. Using Pearson correlation between HR and altitude, it was found in the group of patients aged 1–5 years, a coefficient of -0.118 (p value = 0.012), in the group of patients aged 6–17, 0.047 (p value = 0.025), in the group of patients aged 18–50, -0.044 (p value = 0.041) and for the group of patients aged 51–80, 0.042 (p value = 0.256). In the groups of 1–5, 6–17 and 18–50 years of age, the variations were negligible but statistically significant due to our large sample size. When all of the data was evaluated, HR values were also found to have negligible variations according to the residence altitude, with a Pearson coefficient of -0.033 (p value = 0.009). Centiles charts were used to describe the distribution of HR for different age groups by altitude of residence. Conclusion There are minimal variations of the HR according to the altitude of residence in all age groups."

Transition probabilities of health stages and costs were adapted from published data.An increasing uptake of RAS drugs would incur a projected total treatment cost ranged from MYR 4.89 billion (PMPM of MYR 27.95) at Year 1 to MYR 16.26 billion (PMPM of MYR 92.89) at Year 5. This would represent a range of incremental costs between PMPM of MYR 0.20 at Year 1 and PMPM of MYR 1.62 at Year 5. Over the same period, the care costs showed a downward trend but drug acquisition costs were increasing. Sensitivity analyses showed the model was minimally affected by the changes in the input parameters.Mild impact to the overall healthcare budget has been reported with an increased utilization of RAS. The long-term positive health consequences of RAS treatment would reduce the cost of care in preventing deterioration of kidney function, thus offsetting the rising costs of purchasing RAS drugs. Optimizing and increasing use of RAS drugs would be considered an affordable and rational strategy to reduce the overall healthcare costs in Malaysia."
https://openalex.org/W2918724579,"Liver metastases from neuroendocrine tumors in multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome are common (75%) and significantly impairs the prognosis. Characterisation of liver lesions in these patients is challenging, as liver metastases are difficult to differentiate from benign liver lesions such as haemangioma.In this study we aimed to characterize the radiological findings of hepatic metastases in MEN patients. The findings of contrast-enhanced CT were considered for the main diagnosis. We retrospectively evaluated 25 patients with MEN-syndrome (10 MEN1/ 15 MEN2) including 11 men and 14 women between 28-62 years of age.Liver metastases (48%, 12/25) and hemangioma (40%, 10/25) were the most common liver lesions among our patients. The most common primary tumors in our MEN1 and MEN2 patients with liver metastases were of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (70%, 7/10) und medullary thyroid carcinoma (100%, 15/15) origin, respectively. CT-characteristics were grouped into three main categories, depending on contrast dynamics. The majority of hepatic metastases (75%, 14/25) are presented as multiple lesions with a slow growth in an average 5 years of follow-up-period. We were able to find a common CT pattern and categorise these for each MEN-syndrome. Hepatic metastases in MEN1 presented commonly a blurred arterial enhancement with a low portal venous enhancement and less frequently a prominent enhancement in the arterial phase, which mimics the classical haemangioma. In MEN2 the liver metastases exhibited disseminated mixed hyper- and hypo-enhanced lesions in CT-scans. Moreover, lesion calcifications are pathognomonic in MEN2. The main limitation of this study is the missing histopathological confirmation in the majority of cases.In this retrospective imaging study, we were able to categorise and find a common CT pattern for hepatic lesions in patients with MEN-syndrome. In order to differentiate these lesions sufficiently, a combination of a 3-phasic CT-scan with US is required. Other liver specific imaging modalities (MRI, CEUS, SMS-PET/CT) should complement the diagnosis in individual cases."
