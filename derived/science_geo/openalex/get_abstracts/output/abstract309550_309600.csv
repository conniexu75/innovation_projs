https://openalex.org/W2169270915,A preliminary report on some possible effects of nursing on the mammary gland tumor incidence in mice is presented. 3 litters of mice from an inbred strain of mice with a mammary gland tumor incidence of 88% were fostered by a strain of mice with a tumor indicence of about 10%. Of the 9 females fostered by the low tumor strain 3 developed mammary gland tumors 4 had primary lung tumors and 2 died nontumorus. Among 40 of their progeny who were fostered 12 developed breast tumors 2 had breast and pulmonary cancers 13 had primary lung tumors and 13 died nontumorus. 10 of the 13 progeny of the fostered females which had breast cancer developed similar growths as compared with 4 of the 24 progeny from fostered females which had lung tumors. The respective proportions were 77% and 17%. These results support the belief in the extrachromosomal influence as a cause in the development of mammary tumor.

https://openalex.org/W1986740993,"Evolutionary time has a characteristic direction as demonstrated by the asymmetry of clade diversity diagrams in large statistical samples. Evolutionary groups generally concentrate diversity during their early histories, producing a preponderance of bottom-heavy clades among those that arise early in the history of a larger group. This pattern holds across taxonomic levels and across differences in anatomy and ecology (marine invertebrates, terrestrial mammals). The quantitative study of directionality in life's history (replacing vague, untestable, and culturally laden notions of ""progress"") should receive more attention from paleobiologists."

Many of my contributions, and especially those in political economy and fiscal theory, might be described as varied reiterations, elaborations, and extensions of Wicksellian themes; this paper is no exception. One of the most exciting intellectual moments of my career was my 1948 discovery of Wicksell's unknown and untranslated dissertation, Finanztheoretische Untersuchungen (1896), buried in the dusty stacks of Chicago's old Harper Library. Only the immediate postdissertation leisure of an academic novice allowed for the browsing that produced my own dramatic example of learning by serendipity. Wicksell's new principle of justice in taxation gave me a tremendous surge of self-confidence. Wicksell, who was an established figure in the history of economic ideas, challenged the orthodoxy of public finance theory along lines that were congenial with my own developing stream of critical consciousness. From that moment in Chicago, I took on the determination to make Wicksell's contribution known to a wider audience, and I commenced immediately a translation effort that took some time, and considerable help from Elizabeth Henderson, before final publication. Stripped to its essentials, Wicksell's message was clear, elementary, and self-evident. Economists should cease proffering policy advice as if they were employed by a benevolent despot, and they should look to the structure within which political decisions are made. Armed with Wicksell, I, too, could dare to challenge the still-dominant orthodoxy in public finance and welfare economics. In a preliminary paper (1949), I called upon my fellow economists to postulate some model of the state, of politics, before proceeding to analyze the effects of alternative policy measures. I urged economists to look at the constitution of economic policy, to examine the rules, the constraints within which political agents act. Like Wicksell, my purpose was ultimately normative rather than antiseptically scientific. I sought to make economic sense out of the relationship between the individual and the state before proceeding to advance policy nostrums. Wicksell deserves the designation as the most important precursor of modern public choice theory because we find, in his 1896 dissertation, all three of the constitutive elements that provide the foundations of this theory: methodological individualism, homo economicus, and politics-as-exchange. I shall discuss these elements of analytical structure in the sections that follow. In Section V, I integrate these elements in a theory of ecot This is the lecture James Buchanan delivered in Stockholm, Sweden, December 8, 1986, when he received the Nobel Prize in Economic Science.

A similar edifice collapse of the volcano and ensuing sea wave occurred during an eruption in 1883. Other sea waves resulting in great loss of life and property have been generated by the eruption of coastal volcanos around the world. Although Mount St. Augustine remained intact during this eruptive cycle, a possible recurrence of the 1883 events spurred a numerical simulation of the 1883 sea wave. This simulation, which yielded a forecast of potential wave heights and travel times, was based on a method that could be applied generally to other coastal volcanos."

https://openalex.org/W2031805795,"Filaments and extracellular material from colorless sulfur bacteria (Beggiatoa spp.) form extensive white sulfur mats on surface sediments of coastal, oceanic, and even deep-sea environments. These chemoautotrophic bacteria oxidize soluble reduced sulfur compounds and deposit elemental sulfur, enriching the sulfur content of surface sediment fivefold over that of deeper sediments. Laboratory flume experiments with Beggiatoa mats from an intertidal sandflat (Nova Scotia) demonstrated that even slight erosion of sediment causes a flux of 160 millimoles of sulfur per square meter per hour, two orders of magnitude greater than the flux produced by sulfur transformations involving either sulfate reduction or sulfide oxidation by benthic bacteria. These experiments indicate that resuspension of sulfur bacterial mats by waves and currents is a rapid mechanism by which sediment sulfur is recycled to the water column. Benthic communities thus lose an important storage intermediate for reduced sulfur as well as a high-quality bacterial food source for benthic grazers."
https://openalex.org/W2057932459,"Palynological studies of the nonmarine Newark Supergroup of eastern North America and of rift basins in the northern Gulf of Mexico facilitate correlation with well-dated marine sections of Europe. New information emphasizes the chronological link between the Newark basins and a Gulf of Mexico basin and their common history in the rifting of North America from Pangea. Shales from the subsurface South Georgia Basin are shown to be of late Karnian age (early Late Triassic). The known time of earliest sedimentation in the Culpeper Basin is extended from Norian (late Late Triassic) to mid-Karnian, and the date of earliest sedimentation in the Richmond and Deep River basins is moved to at least earliest Karnian, perhaps Ladinian. The subsurface Eagle Mills Formation in Texas and Arkansas has been dated palynologically as mid- to late Karnian. The oldest parts of the Newark Supergroup, and the Eagle Mills Formation, mostly began deposition in precursor rift basins that formed in Ladinian to early Karnian time. In the southern Newark basins, sedimentation apparently ceased in late Karnian but continued in the northern basins well into the Jurassic, until genesis of the Atlantic ended basin sedimentation."

https://openalex.org/W2055956354,A recent computer simulation reproduced all of the solid-state transitions known for sulfur hexafluoride and predicted the unknown structure of its coldest phase. Subsequent neutron diffraction experiments that were performed to establish the structure of this phase could not be interpreted by conventional procedures. A method for analyzing Debye-Scherrer diffraction patterns was designed to avoid the many false minima that are encountered in standard analyses of low-symmetry phases. The structure found with this method confirmed the previous theoretical prediction.

https://openalex.org/W2015155936,"In a recent note in Science, Mueller pointed out that commercial I-leucine is contaminated with methionine. The presence of a sulfur-containing impurity was recognized by Emil Fischer in 1900. Unsuccessful attempts to purify natural I-leucine have included: the amino-acid ester method, repeated recrystallization from water, electrodialysis, precipitation of methionine as mercury complex and recrystallization from acidified butyl alcohol. Recrystallization of the formylated amino-acid has now been found, however, to yield a sulfur-free leucine without appreciable racemization."
