https://openalex.org/W2090241102,"Epithelial cancers are believed to originate from transformation of tissue stem cells. However, bone marrow–derived cells (BMDCs), which are frequently recruited to sites of tissue injury and inflammation, might also represent a potential source of malignancy. We show that although acute injury, acute inflammation, or transient parietal cell loss within the stomach do not lead to BMDC recruitment, chronic infection of C57BL/6 mice with Helicobacter , a known carcinogen, induces repopulation of the stomach with BMDCs. Subsequently, these cells progress through metaplasia and dysplasia to intraepithelial cancer. These findings suggest that epithelial cancers can originate from marrow-derived sources and thus have broad implications for the multistep model of cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2095002834,"Polycomb group proteins preserve body patterning through development by maintaining transcriptional silencing of homeotic genes. A long-standing hypothesis is that silencing involves creating chromatin structure that is repressive to gene transcription. We demonstrate by electron microscopy that core components of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 induce compaction of defined nucleosomal arrays. Compaction by Polycomb proteins requires nucleosomes but not histone tails. Each Polycomb complex can compact about three nucleosomes. A region of Posterior Sex Combs that is important for gene silencing in vivo is also important for chromatin compaction, linking the two activities. This mechanism of chromatin compaction might be central to stable gene silencing by the Polycomb group."

https://openalex.org/W2046618236,"A conceptual framework for integrating diverse functional genomics data was developed by reinterpreting experiments to provide numerical likelihoods that genes are functionally linked. This allows direct comparison and integration of different classes of data. The resulting probabilistic gene network estimates the functional coupling between genes. Within this framework, we reconstructed an extensive, high-quality functional gene network for Saccharomyces cerevisiae , consisting of 4681 (∼81%) of the known yeast genes linked by ∼34,000 probabilistic linkages comparable in accuracy to small-scale interaction assays. The integrated linkages distinguish true from false-positive interactions in earlier data sets; new interactions emerge from genes' network contexts, as shown for genes in chromatin modification and ribosome biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2110481174,"The widespread extinctions of large mammals at the end of the Pleistocene epoch have often been attributed to the depredations of humans; here we present genetic evidence that questions this assumption. We used ancient DNA and Bayesian techniques to reconstruct a detailed genetic history of bison throughout the late Pleistocene and Holocene epochs. Our analyses depict a large diverse population living throughout Beringia until around 37,000 years before the present, when the population's genetic diversity began to decline dramatically. The timing of this decline correlates with environmental changes associated with the onset of the last glacial cycle, whereas archaeological evidence does not support the presence of large populations of humans in Eastern Beringia until more than 15,000 years later."
https://openalex.org/W1972178991,"Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes of the innate immune system that are involved in the early defenses against foreign cells, as well as autologous cells undergoing various forms of stress, such as microbial infection or tumor transformation. NK cell activation is controlled by a dynamic balance between complementary and antagonistic pathways that are initiated upon interaction with potential target cells. NK cells express an array of activating cell surface receptors that can trigger cytolytic programs, as well as cytokine or chemokine secretion. Some of these activating cell surface receptors initiate protein tyrosine kinase (PTK)–dependent pathways through noncovalent associations with transmembrane signaling adaptors that harbor intracytoplasmic ITAMs (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs). Additional cell surface receptors that are not directly coupled to ITAMs also participate in NK cell activation. These include NKG2D, which is noncovalently associated to the DAP10 transmembrane signaling adaptor, as well as integrins and cytokine receptors. NK cells also express cell surface inhibitory receptors that antagonize activating pathways through protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). These inhibitory cell surface receptors are characterized by intracytoplasmic ITIMs (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs). The tyrosine-phosphorylation status of several signaling components that are substrates for both PTKs and PTPs is thus key to the propagation of the NK cell effector pathways. Understanding the integration of these multiple signals is central to the understanding and manipulation of NK cell effector signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2088810112,"The circumrotation of a submolecular fragment in either direction in a synthetic molecular structure is described. The movement of a small ring around a larger one occurs through positional displacements arising from biased Brownian motion that are kinetically captured and then directionally released. The sense of rotation is governed solely by the order in which a series of orthogonal chemical transformations is performed. The minimalist nature of the [2]catenane flashing ratchet design permits certain mechanistic comparisons with the Smoluchowski-Feynman ratchet and pawl. Even when no work has to be done against an opposing force and no net energy is used to power the motion, a finite conversion of energy is intrinsically required for the molecular motor to undergo directional rotation. Nondirectional rotation has no such requirement."
https://openalex.org/W2030023744,Chromatin folding determines the accessibility of DNA constituting eukaryotic genomes and consequently is profoundly important in the mechanisms of nuclear processes such as gene regulation. Nucleosome arrays compact to form a 30-nanometer chromatin fiber of hitherto disputed structure. Two competing classes of models have been proposed in which nucleosomes are either arranged linearly in a one-start higher order helix or zigzag back and forth in a two-start helix. We analyzed compacted nucleosome arrays stabilized by introduction of disulfide cross-links and show that the chromatin fiber comprises two stacks of nucleosomes in accord with the two-start model.
https://openalex.org/W2064982871,"Neurotrophin treatment has so far failed to prolong the survival of individuals affected with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), an incurable motoneuron degenerative disorder. Here we show that intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) delivery of recombinant vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) in a SOD1G93A rat model of ALS delays onset of paralysis by 17 d, improves motor performance and prolongs survival by 22 d, representing the largest effects in animal models of ALS achieved by protein delivery. By protecting cervical motoneurons, i.c.v. delivery of Vegf is particularly effective in rats with the most severe form of ALS with forelimb onset. Vegf has direct neuroprotective effects on motoneurons in vivo, because neuronal expression of a transgene expressing the Vegf receptor prolongs the survival of SOD1G93A mice. On i.c.v. delivery, Vegf is anterogradely transported and preserves neuromuscular junctions in SOD1G93A rats. Our findings in preclinical rodent models of ALS may have implications for treatment of neurodegenerative disease in general."

https://openalex.org/W2052381091,"Reproductive strategies such as sexual reproduction and recombination that involve the shuffling of parental genomes for the production of offspring are ubiquitous in nature. However, their evolutionary benefit remains unclear. Many theories have identified potential benefits, but progress is hampered by the scarcity of relevant data. One class of theories is based on the assumption that mutations affecting fitness exhibit negative epistasis. Retroviruses recombine frequently and thus provide a unique opportunity to test these theories. Using amino acid sequence data and fitness values from 9466 human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) isolates, we find in contrast to these theories strong statistical evidence for a predominance of positive epistasis in HIV-1."
https://openalex.org/W2149720080,"In vitro studies suggest a role for c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) in proatherogenic cellular processes. We show that atherosclerosis-prone ApoE –/– mice simultaneously lacking JNK2 ( ApoE –/– JNK2 –/– mice), but not ApoE –/– JNK1 –/– mice, developed less atherosclerosis than do ApoE –/– mice. Pharmacological inhibition of JNK activity efficiently reduced plaque formation. Macrophages lacking JNK2 displayed suppressed foam cell formation caused by defective uptake and degradation of modified lipoproteins and showed increased amounts of the modified lipoprotein-binding and -internalizing scavenger receptor A (SR-A), whose phosphorylation was markedly decreased. Macrophage-restricted deletion of JNK2 was sufficient to decrease atherogenesis. Thus, JNK2-dependent phosphorylation of SR-A promotes uptake of lipids in macrophages, thereby regulating foam cell formation, a critical step in atherogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1978180730,"Plants use a structurally very simple gas molecule, the hydrocarbon ethylene, to modulate various developmental programs and coordinate responses to a multitude of external stress factors. How this simple molecule generates such a diverse array of effects has been the subject of intense research for the past two decades. A fascinating signaling pathway, with classical as well as novel plant-specific signaling elements, is emerging from these studies. We describe the four main modules that constitute this signaling pathway: a phosphotransfer relay, an EIN2-based unit, a ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation component, and a transcriptional cascade. The canonical and Arabidopsis ethylene signaling pathways in the Signal Transduction Knowledge Environment Connections Maps provide a complete panoramic view of these signaling events in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2071375100,"Resource pulses are occasional events of ephemeral resource superabundance that occur in many ecosystems. Aboveground consumers in diverse communities often respond strongly to resource pulses, but few studies have investigated the belowground consequences of resource pulses in natural ecosystems. This study shows that resource pulses of 17-year periodical cicadas ( Magicicada spp.) directly increase microbial biomass and nitrogen availability in forest soils, with indirect effects on growth and reproduction in forest plants. These findings suggest that pulses of periodical cicadas create “bottom-up cascades,” resulting in strong and reciprocal links between the aboveground and belowground components of a North American forest ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W2135990544,"Individual variation in gene expression is important for evolutionary adaptation1,2 and susceptibility to diseases and pathologies3,4. In this study, we address the functional importance of this variation by comparing cardiac metabolism to patterns of mRNA expression using microarrays. There is extensive variation in both cardiac metabolism and the expression of metabolic genes among individuals of the teleost fish Fundulus heteroclitus from natural outbred populations raised in a common environment: metabolism differed among individuals by a factor of more than 2, and expression levels of 94% of genes were significantly different (P < 0.01) between individuals in a population. This unexpectedly high variation in metabolic gene expression explains much of the variation in metabolism, suggesting that it is biologically relevant. The patterns of gene expression that are most important in explaining cardiac metabolism differ between groups of individuals. Apparently, the variation in metabolism seems to be related to different patterns of gene expression in the different groups of individuals. The magnitude of differences in gene expression in these groups is not important; large changes in expression have no greater predictive value than small changes. These data suggest that variation in physiological performance is related to the subtle variation in gene expression and that this relationship differs among individuals."

For a particle suspended in anisotropic liquid, theory predicts that the drag coefficient should also be anisotropic. Using video microscopy coupled with particle tracking routines, the Brownian fluctuations of micrometer-sized particles were analyzed to yield a quantitative measurement of the diffusion coefficients parallel and perpendicular to the nematic director. The experimental values agree quite well with recent numerical calculations that take into account the distortions of the director field in the vicinity of the particles."
https://openalex.org/W2072199290,"Research on Alzheimer's disease led to the identification of a novel proteolytic mechanism in all metazoans, the presenilin/γ-secretase complex. This unique intramembrane-cleaving aspartyl protease is required for the normal processing of Notch, Jagged, β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), E-cadherin, and many other receptor-like proteins. We recently provided indirect evidence of γ-secretase activity at the cell surface in HeLa cells following inhibition of receptor-mediated endocytosis. Here, we directly identify and isolate γ-secretase as an intact complex (Presenilin, Nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2) from the plasma membrane, both in overexpressing cell lines and endogenously. Inhibition of its proteolytic activity allowed cell surface γ-secretase to be captured in association with its plasma membrane-localized APP substrates (C83 and C99). Moreover, non-denaturing isolation of the intact enzyme complex revealed that cell surface γ-secretase can specifically generate amyloid β-protein from an APP substrate and similarly cleave a Notch substrate. These data directly establish the proteolytic function of γ-secretase on the plasma membrane, independent of a hypothesized substrate trafficking role. We conclude that presenilin/γ-secretase exists as a mature complex at the cell surface, where it interacts with and can cleave its substrates, consistent with an essential function in processing many adhesion molecules and receptors required for cell-cell interaction or intercellular signaling.

Therefore, we undertook a systematic analysis of the entire γ-secretase complex and its activity on APP and Notch substrates at the cell surface. In this article, we provide direct evidence for a role of γ-secretase in the proteolysis of substrates on the plasma membrane, in accord with an essential function in processing various receptors and adhesion molecules required for cell-cell interaction and intracellular signaling. Cell surface cleavage of γ-secretase substrates that are involved in intercellular adhesion suggests a potential role for γ-secretase in the structural disassembly of cell-cell adhesions, in addition to its role in releasing intracellular signaling fragments. Furthermore, our data demonstrate the involvement of the cell surface in Aβ generation, suggesting that inhibitors of β- or γ-secretase targeted to the exterior of the cell may prove efficacious.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Cell Lysate Preparation—γ-30 cells (5Kimberly W.T. LaVoie M.J. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6382-6387Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, G418, puromycin, zeocin, and hygromycin. HeLa dynamin K44A cells were grown as described previously (33Chyung J.H. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51035-51043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Tetracycline was present in all media to maintain inhibition of dynamin K44A expression. For the γ-secretase inhibitor studies, 10 μm DAPT or Me2SO was applied for 4 h in 5 ml of fresh medium. Cells were lysed and nuclei were pelleted as described previously (33Chyung J.H. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51035-51043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) with the following changes. Some samples were prepared in 1% CHAPSO (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) or 1% digitonin (Calbiochem) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2 containing Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science).Surface Biotinylation—Confluent 10-cm dishes of γ-30 cells and HeLa cells were biotinylated as described previously (33Chyung J.H. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51035-51043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) with the following changes. Cells were biotinylated for 30 min at 4 °C. Samples were then quenched with 100 mm glycine/Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) for at least 10 min, and followed with three Hanks' balanced salt solution washes. Lysates were prepared in 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% CHAPSO, or 1% digitonin as described above. Surface biotinylated Western blots shown are representative of at least five independent experiments.Western Blotting—Equal lysate volumes were analyzed by Western blotting. 4–20% Tris glycine gels (Invitrogen) were used to separate proteins. Full-length APP, C83, and C99 were blotted with the COOH-terminal-specific polyclonal antibody, C8. C99 was specifically detected with 6E10 (Signet Laboratories, Inc., Dedham, MA). Tubulin and ribophorin were blotted with antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was blotted with an antibody from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). γ-Secretase proteins were blotted as follows: Nct with the rabbit polyclonal antibody N1660 (Sigma); PS with the rat monoclonal antibody 1563 (Chemicon) and the rabbit polyclonal antibody AB14 (gift from S. Gandy); Aph-1-HA with rat monoclonal antibody 3F10 (Roche); endogenous Aph-1 with H2D2 (gift) and O2C2 (gift); FLAG-Pen-2 with the mouse monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma); endogenous Pen-2 with the rabbit polyclonal antibody α-pen2 (gift from C. Haass). Biotin was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody from Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX). C100-FLAG and AICD-FLAG were detected using the monoclonal antibody M2. Western blots were developed with Pierce Femto Super-Signal (Pierce). All Western blots shown were repeated in at least five independent experiments with the exception of the detection of biotinylated FLAG-Pen-2 co-immunoprecipitated with 1563 in γ-30 cells, which was repeated in three independent experiments.Immunoprecipitations and Affinity Resin Precipitations—For direct pulldown of biotinylated proteins, samples were prepared in 1% Nonidet P-40 + 0.1% SDS. Samples were pre-cleared three times with protein A-Sepharose (PAS) (Sigma) containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h each. γ-Secretase was immunoprecipitated with M2-agarose (Sigma). Surface-biotinylated proteins were precipitated with streptavidin-agarose (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) overnight. Beads were washed in 0.5 m STEN, SDS STEN, and STEN wash buffers and proteins were eluted with 1× Laemmli sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol. For co-immunoprecipitations, lysates were pre-cleared with PAS containing 1% bovine serum albumin three times for 1 h each, and then incubated overnight with antibodies or affinity resins. Co-immunoprecipitations were performed in 1% CHAPSO and 1% digitonin, and washes were performed in the same detergent/lysis buffers three times for at least 20 min each. Co-immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted in 1× sample buffer and β-mercaptoethanol. 81 Times immunoprecipitated samples subjected to a second round of C9 immunoprecipitation were eluted using 1% Nonidet P-40 and 1% SDS and heated to 65 °C for 5 min to disrupt protein-protein interactions. We then diluted samples to achieve final detergent concentrations of 1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.1% SDS and pre-cleared with PAS prior to C9 immunoprecipitations. FLAG peptide elutions were performed using 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma) for 4 h. Eluted proteins were subjected to a second round of pulldown using streptavidin-agarose. 1563 pH-eluted proteins were eluted using 100 mm glycine, pH 2.8, for 15–30 s followed by quenching with 1 n NaOH. Samples were prepared for SDS-PAGE by adding 1× sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol and for blue native PAGE by adjusting to 1% digitonin and 1× blue native PAGE lysis buffer (34LaVoie M.J. Fraering P.C. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Kimberly W.T. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol.

Kimberly W.T. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Diehl T.S. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2720-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar).In Vitro γ-Secretase Activity Assay—In vitro activity assays were performed as described previously with the following modifications. Samples were prepared in 100-μl volumes, and incubated for either 6 or 24 h at 37 °C. For γ-30 cells, samples were first immunoprecipitated with M2-agarose. Surface biotinylated γ-secretase was selected from this pool of total cellular γ-secretase using a second streptavidin-agarose pulldown of FLAG-peptide elutions of the M2-agarose-immunoprecipitated samples. 10 μm DAPT was added to some samples prior to the addition of C100-FLAG or N100-FLAG substrates and phospholipids as a control. Biotinylated HeLa cell lysates were precipitated with streptavidin-agarose directly for activity assays.ELISA—ELISA for Aβ X-40 was performed as described previously (33Chyung J.H. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51035-51043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Standards of Aβ1–40 were diluted in specimen diluent buffer. Serial dilutions of in vitro activity assay samples were made in specimen diluent buffer. Standards and samples were incubated for 2 h. Bound Aβ was detected with biotinylated 266 antibody (0.15 μg/ml) (gift of P. Seubert and D. Schenk, Elan Pharmaceuticals, San Francisco, CA). Plates were washed briefly three times between incubations with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20, and then washed four times before developing with tetramethylbenzidine-ELISA (Pierce).Quantitative Western Blotting—PS NH2-terminal fragment (NTF) levels in M2-agarose immunoprecipitations and in M2-agarose/streptavidin-agarose sequential precipitations were quantified by densitometry using ImageQuaNT software (Amersham Biosciences). Standard curves for PS NTF were generated by Western blotting 2-fold serial dilutions of M2-agarose in parallel with experimental samples. The fraction of cell surface-associated PS NTF was quantified using the standard curve generated from Western blots of serial 2-fold dilutions of PS NTF from M2-agarose immunoprecipitations.RESULTSDirect Biotinylation of Each γ-Secretase Complex Member at the Cell Surface—First, we attempted to demonstrate the presence of each γ-secretase complex member on the plasma membrane using surface biotinylation. Nct and PS have previously been biotinylated at the cell surface (17Schwarzman A.L. Singh N. Tsiper M. Gregori L. Dranovsky A. Vitek M.P. Glabe C.G. George-Hyslop P.H. Goldgaber D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Aph-1 contains one primary amine group available for biotinylation at the free amino terminus of the protein, which protrudes into the lumenal space. The internal lysines are all facing the cytoplasmic side and are not available for biotinylation. Pen-2 is oriented with both its amino and carboxyl termini facing the lumenal side, thus presenting its free amino terminus as well as two lysines at positions 11 and 17 for possible biotinylation.The γ-30 Chinese hamster ovary cell line, which stably overexpresses human PS1, Aph-1-HA, and FLAG-Pen-2 in the presence of high amounts of endogenous Nct, has markedly elevated γ-secretase activity (5Kimberly W.T.

We biotinylated intact γ-30 cells and precipitated biotinylated surface proteins using streptavidin-agarose beads. Following surface biotinylation and pulldowns, we recovered biotinylated mature Nct, holo-PS, and the PS NTF produced by endoproteolysis of PS (38Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H.

In addition, we specifically recovered biotinylated Aph-1-HA and FLAG-Pen-2 from the cell surface (Fig. 1). Each biotinylated protein co-migrated with its corresponding non-biotinylated form in straight lysates run on the same gel. As negative controls, we found no biotinylation of ribophorin, a type I transmembrane protein resident in the ER, or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, an abundant cytosolic protein (Fig. 1, bottom panel).Fig. 2Cell surface biotinylation of intact γ-secretase. γ-Secretase was immunoprecipitated from surface-biotinylated γ-30 cells using the PS NTF antibody, 1563, in 1% digitonin lysis buffer, which keeps the γ-complex intact. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted using a brief 100 mm glycine, pH 2.8, elution and analyzed for co-immunoprecipitated and biotinylated proteins. A, analysis by SDS-PAGE after immunoprecipitation with 1563 (to PS1) reveals the co-precipitation of Nct, Aph-1, and Pen-2 (right panels). Probing with an anti-biotin antibody reveals the presence of biotinylated proteins that co-migrate with Nct, PS, Aph-1, and Pen-2 (left panels). B, analysis of the 1563-precipitated complex by blue native PAGE reveals the presence of a biotinylated complex migrating slightly larger than 232 kDa (left panel) that contains Nct, PS, Aph-1, and Pen-2 (4 right panels), thus representing γ-secretase.

These changes provide the basis for a new monitoring technique and possibly for future midterm eruption forecasting at volcanoes. The fast anisotropic direction was measured during three seismometer deployments in 1994, 1998, and 2002, providing an in situ measurement of the stress in the crust under the volcano. The stress direction changed because of an eruption in 1995–1996. Our 2002 measurements revealed a partial return to the pre-eruption stress state. These changes were probably caused by repeated filling and depressurizing of a magmatic dike system."

We show that granzyme B initiates a two-tiered caspase activation cascade involving seven caspases, where caspase-3 is required for the second tier of caspase activation events. Using a two-dimensional gel-based proteomics approach we have also examined the scale of granzyme B-initiated alterations to the proteome in the presence or absence of effector caspase-3 or -7.

The latter event results in the entry of multiple CTL/NK granule proteins (granzymes) into the target cell, but how these granzymes coordinate death of the target is still poorly understood as substrates for several of the granzymes have yet to be found.

However, because multiple caspases undergo proteolytic maturation in response to Gzm B, it has proved difficult to determine the primary target(s) of Gzm B in the caspase cascade and to unravel the hierarchy of caspase activation events that follow downstream. In contrast, Gzm A does not appear to target any of the caspases but rather targets proteins within the nuclear envelope and also activates a DNase complex through degradation of its inhibitor, SET (20Zhang D.

The route chosen by Gzm B to initiate caspase activation (whether direct or via Bid) most likely depends on the effective concentration of this granzyme that is delivered by the CTL/NK into the target cell. At present, the concentration of Gzm B, or of the other granzymes, that is delivered into target cells during CTL/NK-mediated attack is unknown. However, studies using purified Gzm B suggest that nanomolar (50–100 nm) amounts of this granzyme are sufficient to engage the target cell death machinery (30Sutton V.R. Wowk M.E. Cancilla M. Trapani J.A. Immunity. 2003; 18: 319-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). At these concentrations, Bid has been proposed as the preferred Gzm B substrate although this has been the subject of debate (23Pinkoski M.J. Waterhouse N.J. Heibein J.A. Wolf B.B. Kuwana T.

Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Irrespective of how Gzm B engages the caspase activation cascade, it also remains unclear what contributions individual caspases make to the terminal phase of apoptosis. Several caspases (caspase-3, -6, and -7) are thought to contribute to the destruction of the cell from within, probably through targeting hundreds of proteins for restricted proteolysis (33Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 349-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar, 34Fischer U. Janicke R.U. Schulze-Osthoff K. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 76-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). However, this aspect of apoptosis remains relatively poorly understood due to the sheer number of substrates that may be targeted by caspases. Here, we have explored the hierarchy of caspase activation events that are initiated by Gzm B and have delineated a two-tiered caspase activation cascade where caspase-3 plays a required role in the activation of several other caspases. Furthermore, using proteomic analysis we also show that caspase-3 is the major target protease of granzyme B and is responsible for proteolysis of numerous cellular substrate proteins during the demolition phase of apoptosis.

Preparation of Cell-free Extract and Induction of Granzyme B- or Apoptosome-dependent Caspase Activation—Cell-free extract was generated from exponentially growing healthy Jurkat T lymphocytic cells as described previously (27Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J.

Two volumes of ice-cold cell extract buffer were added (CEB: 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin), and the cells were allowed to swell for 15–20 min on ice. Cells were then lysed by homogenization with 10–15 strokes of a B-type pestle. Lysates were then clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min to remove nuclei, mitochondria, and other cellular debris. Extracts were then frozen at -70 °C prior to use. For in vitro granzyme B-mediated activation of caspases, aliquots of cell-free extract were diluted 2-fold in CEB supplemented with a final concentration of 100 nm purified human granzyme B. Alternatively, to provoke apoptosome-dependent caspase activation, bovine heart cytochrome c and dATP were added to parallel reactions to final concentrations of 50 μg/ml and 1 mm, respectively. Coupled in Vitro Transcription and Translation—35S-Labeled proteins were generated using the TNT kit (Promega), as described previously (13Martin S.J. Amarante-Mendes G.P. Shi L. Chuang T.H.

Immunodepletion of Caspases from Cell-free Extracts—Cell free extracts were immunodepleted of various caspases, essentially as described previously (35Murphy B.M. O'Neill A.J. Adrain C. Watson R.W. Martin S.J. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 36Slee E.A. Adrain C. Martin S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7320-7326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of antibody were precoupled to 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2 for 3–4 h at 4 °C. Bead-immobilized antibodies were then washed in CEB and incubated overnight with 50 μl of freshly made unfrozen cell free extract. The depleted extracts were then stored at -70 °C prior to use. Fluorimetric Assessment of Caspase Activity—To measure the ability of Gzm B to stimulate executioner caspase activity, cell-free reactions were assembled in the presence or absence of 100 nm Gzm B. After incubating for 2 h at 37 °C, ∼2.5 μl of the cell-free reactions were diluted to a final volume of 50 μl in CEB. An equal volume of DEVD-AFC was added to a final concentration of 50 μm, and the liberation of free AFC was monitored for 1 h at 37 °C in a fluorimeter using excitation and emission wavelengths of 430 and 535 nm, respectively. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—For proteomic analysis, 350 μg of cell free extract solubilized in 350 μl 2D sample buffer (8 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% SDS, 0.5% ampholyte 3–10 and a trace of bromphenol blue) were rehydrated passively into 17-cm pH 5–8 IPG strips. Isoelectric focusing was performed in a Bio-Rad protean isoelectric focusing cell under the following conditions: 1) linear voltage ramp to 500 V over 1 h, 2) 5 h at 500 V, 3) linear voltage ramp to 3500 V over 5 h, and 4) 12 h at 3500 V. Following isoelectric focusing, the IPG strips were reduced for 5 mins each in equilibration buffer (6 m urea, 375 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol) containing 2% dithiothreitol and then alkylated in equilibration buffer instead containing 2.5% indole-3-acetic acid. Strips were then mounted on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and electrophoresed at 37.5 mA per gel in a Bio-Rad Protean II xi electrophoresis cell (Bio-Rad). Two-dimensional gels were stained using a mass spectrometry-compatible silver staining protocol (37Mortz E. Krogh T.N. Vorum H. Gorg A. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 1359-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Protein Identification by MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry—Protein spots excised from two-dimensional gels were incubated in oxidation buffer (15 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 50 mm Na2S2O3) until the spots were completely destained. Gel pieces were then washed extensively in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid and equilibrated in 50 mm NH4HCO3 followed by dehydration in 100% acetonitrile. After drying in a Speed-Vac (Thermo Savant), 25–50 ng of trypsin in digestion buffer (25 mm NH4HCO3, 0.1 n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside) were allowed to rehydrate directly into the gel piece for 5 min. A further 10 μl of digestion buffer were then added and samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C. The following day, peptides were extracted twice into 40 μl 66% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in a sonicating water bath and lyophilized in a Speed-Vac at room temperature. For mass spectrometric analysis, peptides were solubilized in 5 μl of 5% formic acid. Samples (0.5–1 μl) were applied to a Teflon-coated 96-well MALDI target plate (Applied Biosciences, UK), followed by the addition of 0.5 to 1 μl of a 10 mg/ml matrix solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 60% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Samples were allowed to air-dry at room temperature before analysis in positive reflectron mode in a Voyager DE Pro-MALDI mass spectrometer (Applied Biosciences). After applying a filter to remove common background contaminant peaks, the de-isotoped spectra were submitted to the MS-Fit and MASCOT web-based data bases for protein identification. Gzm B Promotes Activation of Multiple Caspases—To explore the Gzm B-initiated caspase activation cascade, we used a well established cell-free system based upon cytosolic extracts of Jurkat T lymphocytic cells (13Martin S.J.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2134-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, addition of nanomolar amounts (100 nm) of purified human Gzm B to Jurkat cell-free extracts triggered the processing of multiple caspases to their signature active forms, with the exception of caspase-14. For comparison, cell-free extracts were also triggered to undergo caspase activation via the well characterized apoptosome pathway by addition of cytochrome c (Cyt c)/dATP to the extracts (Fig. 1A). These experiments revealed that caspase-2, -3, -6, and -7 were activated with similar kinetics in the granzyme B- and Cyt c/dATP-initiated pathways (Fig. 1). However, the kinetics of caspase-8 and caspase-10 processing were significantly faster in response to Gzm B, suggesting that these caspases were activated earlier in the Gzm B-driven cascade (Fig. 1A). As reported previously, Cyt c/dATP triggered processing of caspase-9 predominantly to the p35 form of the enzyme, indicating that the majority of active caspase-9 was derived from autoprocessing (Fig. 1A; Refs. 27Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J.

Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast, the p37 form of caspase-9 was the predominant species observed in the presence of Gzm B. Because this site has previously been identified as a caspase-3 processing site on caspase-9 (27Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W.

Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar), this suggested that caspase-3 was responsible for the majority of caspase-9 processing seen in the Gzm B pathway (Fig. 1). Thus, although Gzm B and Cyt c/dATP activated the same repertoire of caspases, the kinetics and hierarchy of proteolytic events clearly differed between these distinct caspase activation mechanisms. Direct Processing of Caspase-3, -7, -8, and -10 by Gzm B—Because certain caspases can activate other members of the caspase family, it was clearly possible that some of the caspase activation events triggered by Gzm B were indirect. To explore this possibility, cell-free reactions were carried out in the presence or absence of the polycaspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk, to separate Gzm B-dependent and caspase-dependent processing events (Fig. 1B). As reported previously, addition of Z-VAD-fmk arrested the autoproteolytic maturation of caspase-3, as indicated by a p24 fragment corresponding to the caspase-3 large subunit/prodomain (Fig. 1B; Ref. 13Martin S.J. Amarante-Mendes G.P. Shi L. Chuang T.H. Casiano C.A. O'Brien G.A. Fitzgerald P. Tan E.M. Bokoch G.M. Greenberg A.H. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2407-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). More importantly, this analysis revealed that the processing of caspase-2, -6, and -9 was completely arrested in the presence of Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 1B). Thus, contrary to previous reports (14Duan H. Orth K. Chinnaiyan A.M. Poirier G.G. Froelich C.J. He W.W. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16720-16724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 17Harvey N.L.

These data suggest that only caspase-3, -7, -8, and-10 are direct targets of Gzm B. Relative Susceptibility of Caspases Versus Bid to Gzm B Proteolysis—Although Gzm B can directly process several caspases, much evidence also indicates that the BH-3-only molecule Bid is an important substrate for Gzm B (22Barry M.

Indeed, Bid may be a significantly better substrate for Gzm B than either caspase-3 or caspase-8 (23Pinkoski M.J. Waterhouse N.J. Heibein J.A. Wolf B.B. Kuwana T. Goldstein J.C. Newmeyer D.D. Bleackley R.C. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12060-12067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, a recent study has proposed that Bid proteolysis during Gzm B/perforin-mediated killing may be an indirect event that occurs as a consequence of solubilization of endosomes by detergents during cell lysis (32Metkar S.S. Wang B. Ebbs M.L. Kim J.H. Lee Y.J. Raja S.M. Froelich C.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To date, the relative sensitivity of Bid versus the caspases as substrates for GzmB has not been examined comprehensively or in a setting where all of these proteins are present at physiological levels. To explore this question, we titrated human Gzm B into Jurkat cell-free extracts in the presence of Z-VAD-fmk to preclude the possibility that caspase-dependent amplification events would complicate the analysis (Fig. 2A). Of the caspases examined, caspase-7 was found to be the most susceptible to Gzm B-mediated proteolysis and was still partially processed in the presence of 12 nm Gzm B (Fig. 2A). Bid was also highly susceptible to Gzm B-mediated proteolysis and, similar to caspase-7, was also cleaved at concentrations of 12 nm Gzm B (Fig. 2A). In contrast, caspase-3, -8, and -10 were markedly less sensitive to Gzm B-mediated proteolysis, with concentrations of 50–100 nm Gzm B being required to provoke significant maturation of these proteases (Fig. 2A). Thus, under conditions where Gzm B substrates are present at physiological levels, Bid and caspase-7 exhibited broadly similar sensitivities to Gzm B-mediated proteolysis. However, because caspase-7 cannot amplify the caspase activation cascade by processing other caspases (27Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar), Bid is probably the most relevant target of Gzm B when the latter is delivered into target cells at limiting concentrations. We also explored whether human and murine Gzm B exhibited a similar preference for proteolysis of Bid relative to caspase-3. Thus, we added murine Gzm B into cell-free extracts derived from murine J774 macrophages and compared the efficiency of proteolysis of Bid and caspase-3 within these extracts (Fig. 2B). In sharp contrast to what we observed using human Gzm B and cell-free extracts derived from human Jurkat cells, murine Gzm B preferentially cleaved caspase-3 rather than Bid in J774 cell-free extracts (Fig. 2B). This observation suggests that mouse and human Gzm B differ significantly in their substrate preferences. Furthermore, this observation was confirmed in experiments using murine Gzm B within the context of human cell free extract (Fig. 2C). As shown in Fig. 2C, although murine Gzm B displayed reduced activity toward human substrates as compared with murine substrates (Fig. 2B), the enzyme still exhibited a distinct preference for caspase-3 as opposed to Bid (Fig. 2C). By sharp contrast, human Gzm B cleaved Bid much more efficiently than caspase-3 (Fig. 2A). Taken together, these data suggest that the inability of murine GzmB to cleave Bid derives from differences in the enzymatic specificities between the murine and human enzymes, given that the behavior of murine Gzm B is similar in both human and murine extracts. Interestingly, two of the amino acids that represent determinants of the S2′ pocket subsite are not conserved between human and mouse or rat Gzm B, suggesting a possible basis for the observed differences in the specificities of the enzymes (41Rotonda J.

Caspase-3 Disseminates the Gzm B-triggered Caspase Activation Cascade—Because Gzm B was not directly responsible for the processing of procaspase-2, -6, and -9 (Fig. 1B), we next sought to identify the caspase(s) responsible for these downstream amplification events. To address this question, we used an immunodepletion approach to generate a panel of cell free extracts devoid of specific caspases, as described under “Experimental Procedures” (27Slee E.A.

The outline of the general sequence of events during hydrogenase metallocenter assembly in E. coli has been largely derived from studies of the hydrogenase 3 large subunit (HycE), although the overall process is similar for the other isoenzymes (for recent reviews see Refs. 2Kuchar J.

Trans. 2002; 30: 674-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The main auxiliary proteins are encoded by the hypA–F genes (10Lutz S. Jacobi A. Schlensog V. Bohm R. Sawers G. Böck A. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 11Jacobi A. Rossmann R. Böck A. Arch. Microbiol. 1992; 158: 444-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 12Maier T. Binder U. Böck A. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 165: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and the general purpose folding chaperones GroEL and GroES may also be required for optimal maturation (13Rodrigue A. Batia N. Muller M. Fayet O. Bohm R. Mandrand-Berthelot M.A. Wu L.F. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4453-4460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During the first steps of the pathway the iron and its diatomic ligands are prepared and inserted into the hydrogenase 3 precursor protein HycE by HypCDEF. Next, HypC remains associated with HycE while HypA and the GTPase HypB facilitate insertion of the nickel ion. The nickel serves as part of the recognition motif for the isoenzyme-specific protease HycI, and the processing of the [NiFe]-containing protein is completed following cleavage of a C-terminal fragment. Many of the details of the hydrogenase biosynthetic pathway are not yet understood, and it is possible that not all of the individual components are known. For example, a nickel metallochaperone for E. coli hydrogenase 3 has not been identified. To search for other factors involved in this process we are using a proteomics approach to characterize native multiprotein complexes (14Zeghouf M. Li J. Butland G. Borkowska A. Canadien V. Richards D. Beattie B. Emili A. Greenblatt J.F. J. Proteome Res. 2004; 3: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These experiments led to the isolation of SlyD, an E. coli protein of unknown function that has not been previously associated with this pathway (see Fig. 1). SlyD is a member of the FK506-binding protein (FKBP) 1The abbreviations used are: FKBP, FK506-binding protein; EDC, 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride); MS, mass spectrometry; PPIase, peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerase; SPA, sequential peptide affinity; TCEP, Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride. family of peptidyl-prolyl isomerases (PPIases) that was originally cloned because genetic mutations provide resistance to lysis induced by the phage ϕX174 (sensitivity to lysis) (15Roof W.D. Horne S.M. Young K.D. Young R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2902-2910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the PPIase domain at the N terminus, SlyD also has a 50-residue C-terminal domain that is rich in potential metal-binding residues (Fig. 1), containing 15 histidines, 6 cysteines, and 7 glutamates/aspartates (15Roof W.D. Horne S.M. Young K.D. Young R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2902-2910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Wülfing C. Lombardero J. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2895-2901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that SlyD can bind a variety of different metals including up to three nickel ions (16Wülfing C. Lombardero J. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2895-2901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hottenrott S. Schumann T. Plückthun A. Fischer G. Rahfeld J-U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15697-15701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The metal-binding domain of SlyD is not required for PPIase activity (17Hottenrott S. Schumann T. Plückthun A. Fischer G. Rahfeld J-U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15697-15701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), although metal-ion binding inhibits the PPIase activity of the full-length protein (17Hottenrott S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15697-15701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and in practice it allows for purification by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (16Wülfing C. Lombardero J. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2895-2901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report we show that SlyD interacts with the hydrogenase accessory protein HypB and that it has a role in hydrogenase metallocenter assembly. Knocking out the gene for SlyD results in reduced hydrogenase activity and the detection of unprocessed HycE protein, indicating that the maturation pathway is blocked. This deficiency can be complemented by the addition of nickel to the growth medium. Furthermore, the ΔslyD strain accumulates less nickel then the wild-type strain when grown under anaerobic conditions. How SlyD might participate in hydrogenase metallocenter assembly, including a possible role as a nickel source, is discussed. Materials—Restriction endonucleases were purchased from New England Biolabs. DNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Sigma. DNA ligase was purchased from MBI Fermentas. Pfu DNA polymerase was from Stratagene. All water was eluted from a Milli-Q water system (Millipore). The anti-HypB (18Maier T. Jacobi A. Sauter M. Bock A. J.

Tandem MS analysis of the samples was performed by microcapillary liquid chromatography electrospray tandem MS (liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-MS/MS). Briefly, the protein mixture was resuspended in 100 mm NH4HCO3, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 8.5, and digested by trypsin overnight at 37 °C with 2 μl of immobilized trypsin Poros beads (PerSeptive). The digested peptides were fractionated on a 7.5-cm (100 μm ID) reverse phase C18 capillary column attached inline to a ThermoFinnigan LCQ-Deca ion trap mass spectrometer.

All tandem mass spectra were searched using the SEQUEST computer algorithm against an E. coli protein sequence data base compiled in-house. Each spectral match was validated by using the STATQUEST probability algorithm and was significant at a 99% confidence level (24Kislinger T. Rahman K. Radulovic D. Cox B. Rossant J. Emili A. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 96-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Growth Conditions and Preparation of Crude Cell Extracts for Biochemical Assays—Cells were grown anaerobically following inoculation with 1% (v/v) overnight culture at 37 °C in sealed flasks of buffered TGYEP medium containing 10 g of tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, 69 mm K2HPO4, and 22 mm KH2PO4/liter (25Begg Y.A. Whyte J.N. Haddock B.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1977; 2: 47-50Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar) for the indicated times. The medium was supplemented with 1 μm sodium molybdate, 1 μm sodium selenite, 30 mm sodium formate, and 0.5% glucose, except for in the analysis of hydrogenase 1 and 2 or induction of the pBAD vectors, in which case the glucose and formate were replaced with 0.8% glycerol and 15 mm sodium fumarate (26Hube M. Blokesch M. Böck A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3879-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). NiSO4 or ZnCl2 salts were added to the medium at the indicated concentrations. When required, the antibiotics kanamycin (50 μg/ml) or chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) were included in the growth medium. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and resuspended in the same buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and trace amount of DNase I. Crude cell extracts were prepared by sonication and subsequent centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was quickly frozen in N2(l) and stored at –80 °C. The protein concentrations of crude cell extracts were determined by the BCA protein assay system (Pierce). The addition of extra nickel to the extracts did not affect any of the activities monitored (data not shown). Plasmids—To clone into the pET24b plasmid (Novagen), the slyD gene was amplified by PCR from DH5α E. coli by using the forward 5′-CAGGAGATCATATGAAAGTAGCAAAAGACCTGGTG-3′ and reverse 5′-GTCACTTCTCGAGTATTAGTGGCAACCGCAAC-3′ primers. The PCR product was purified by using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and digested with NdeI and XhoI. Following elution from an agarose gel with the QIAquick kit, the fragment was ligated with pET24b digested with the same enzymes and then transformed into XL-2 Blue E. coli (Stratagene). Plasmid DNA was isolated from cultures grown in kanamycin-supplemented LB by using a Qiagen HiSpeed Plasmid Miniprep kit. The pET24-SlyD construct was verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing (ACGT, Toronto). The same procedure was used to clone slyD into the pBAD24 vector (American Type Culture Collection) to make pBAD24-SlyD except that the forward 5′-CTATTCTTCGCTAGCTCAGGAGATATCATGAAAG-3′ and reverse 5′-GTCACTTTCTAGATATTAGTGGCAACCGCAAC-3′ primers were used, the PCR product and plasmid DNA were cut with NheI and XbaI, and ampicillin was used in the medium. Purification of SlyD—BL21(DE3) E. coli transformed with pET24-SlyD were grown in kanamycin-containing LB to an A600 of 0.7, induced by the addition of 0.35 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and incubated for an additional 3 h at 37 °C. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation (30 min at 4600 rpm), and the cell pellet was resuspended in 25 ml of lysis buffer/liter of culture (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and sonicated on ice. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 18,000 rpm in an SS34 rotor, and the supernatant was loaded onto a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer containing 100 mm NaCl. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, the proteins were eluted in lysis buffer containing 100 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, and the eluate was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA. The solution was loaded onto a Mono-Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and eluted with linear gradient of 200–400 mm NaCl over 75 ml. The fractions containing SlyD were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, concentrated in a Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter, and loaded onto a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 10 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.6. The fractions containing pure SlyD were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, treated with 100 mm TCEP and stored in the anaerobic glove box at 4 °C. Chemical Cross-linking—SlyD and/or HypB were incubated in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, for 30 min at room temperature. A final concentration of 12.5 mm 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride) (EDC, Pierce) was added to the reactions, followed by a 1-h incubation at room temperature and analysis on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels that were stained with Coomassie dye. Western Analysis—Cell extracts were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride (HycE Western) membranes. The blots were probed with the appropriate primary antibody at a 1:3000 dilution (mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody, Sigma) or a 1:1000 dilution (anti-HycE, anti-HypB). The 2° antibody used, diluted 1:30,000, was either the goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad). The enhanced chemiluminescence technique (Pierce) was used for detection. Hydrogenase Activity Assays—Total hydrogenase activity of crude cell extracts was measured by hydrogen-dependent reduction of benzyl viologen according to the procedure of Ballantine and Boxer (27Ballantine S.P. Boxer D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 454-459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were prepared in a septum-sealed cuvette in an anaerobic glove box (95% N2 and 5% H2). One unit of activity is defined as 1 μmol of benzyl viologen reduced/min and an extinction coefficient of 7400 m–1 cm–1 was used (27Ballantine S.P. Boxer D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 454-459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To measure the activities of hydrogenases 1 and 2 an in-gel assay was performed (28Blokesch M. Rohrmoser M. Rode S. Böck A. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2603-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Crude cell extracts were resolved on 10 or 12.5% polyacrylamide gels run at 4 °C for 4 h at 200 V. All buffers and gels contained 0.1% SDS. The gels were incubated in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, containing 0.5 mm benzyl viologen (Sigma) and 1 mm triphenyltetrazolium chloride (Sigma) in the anaerobic glove box at room temperature for 16 h. The data were analyzed on a Fluorochem 8800 gel documentation system (Alpha Innotech). Cellular Nickel Accumulation—The indicated concentrations of 63Ni (specific activity 420 mCi/mmol; PerkinElmer life Sciences) were added to cells grown anaerobically. BL21(DE3) transformed with pET24-SlyD or pET24b were grown in LB, and DY330 and ΔslyD cells were grown in TGYEP supplemented with glucose and formate. The cells were harvested and extensively washed with 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, then crude extracts were prepared by sonication in the same buffer and subsequent centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min. The radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting in 5 ml of UltimaGold scintillation fluid with a Liquid Scintillation Analyzer Tri-Carb 2100TR (Packard Instruments). SlyD Directly Interacts with HypB—The SPA system is a method to identify the components of multiprotein complexes in bacterial cells under native conditions (14Zeghouf M. Li J. Butland G. Borkowska A. Canadien V. Richards D. Beattie B. Emili A. Greenblatt J.F. J. Proteome Res. 2004; 3: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The protein of interest is genomically tailored with a tag that encodes three modified FLAG sequences as well as a calmodulin-binding peptide. The target protein and any associated proteins are then isolated by two affinity chromatography steps. The identity of each protein is determined either by tryptic digestion of the whole eluent followed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-MS/MS or resolution on SDS-PAGE followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization MS/MS of individual gel bands. We are using this procedure to map out protein-protein interactions between the Hyp factors and other E. coli proteins 3G. Butland, J. W. Zhang, J. F. Greenblatt, A. Emili, and D. B. Zamble, unpublished data. in bacteria grown under conditions that favor hydrogenase expression (11Jacobi A. Rossmann R. Böck A. Arch. Microbiol. 1992; 158: 444-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 25Begg Y.A. Whyte J.N. Haddock B.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1977; 2: 47-50Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Upon SPA purification of tagged HypB from ST713, both the HypB protein and the histidine-rich protein called SlyD (Fig. 1) were identified (data not shown). Furthermore, inspection of data collected for another study revealed that HypB was identified in the purified SlyD-SPA complex isolated from strain ST395 (63Butland G. Peregrin-Alvarez J.M. Li J. Yang W. Yang X. Canadien V. Starostine A. Richards D. Beattie B. Krogari N. Davey M. Parkinson J. Greenblatt J.F. Emili A. Nature. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). SlyD was not detected in a complex with any of the other accessory proteins investigated to date, including HypA, HypC, HypD, or HybG. 3G. Butland, J. W. Zhang, J. F. Greenblatt, A. Emili, and D. B. Zamble, unpublished data. To confirm the HypB and SlyD protein-protein interaction, chemical cross-linking of purified recombinant proteins was performed (Fig. 2). Upon incubation of SlyD with EDC, a slightly faster mobility band was observed, possibly because of an internal cross-link. In the cross-linking reaction containing both HypB and SlyD, a new band was observed at the mobility of a 1:1 HypB-SlyD complex. The presence of HypB in this covalent complex was confirmed by Western analysis with an anti-HypB antibody (18Maier T. Jacobi A. Sauter M. Bock A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 630-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). A faint band at a larger molecular weight than the heterodimer was also observed in the HypB reactions both with or without SlyD (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 6), and it is most likely a HypB homodimer (18Maier T. Jacobi A. Sauter M. Bock A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 630-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of slyD—It is not known what factors control the expression of slyD, although complementation experiments indicated uninduced constitutive expression driven by a cryptic promoter (15Roof W.D. Horne S.M. Young K.D. Young R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2902-2910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and homology to the promoters that utilize σ70 was noted (16Wülfing C. Lombardero J. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2895-2901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hydrogenases are regulated by various metabolites, but expression of all of the hydrogenase isoenzymes is repressed by oxygen (29Sawers R.G. Ballantine S.P. Boxer D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 1324-1331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Self W.T. Hasona A. Shanmugam K.T. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and the hyp operon is regulated by the anaerobic transcription factor FNR (31Messenger S.L. Green J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 228: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Furthermore, nickel regulates the expression of the nickel uptake transporter in E. coli and various nickel-containing enzymes in other organisms (Ref. 7Mulrooney S.B. Hausinger R.P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 239-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar and references therein). To determine whether these growth conditions also affect SlyD production, Western analysis was performed on extracts from strain ST395 with an anti-FLAG antibody. The amount of SlyD-SPA detected was not affected by excess nickel (up to 300 μm) in the growth medium whether cells were grown open to the atmosphere instead of in sealed anaerobic flasks or whether LB medium was used instead of TGYEP containing formate (data not shown). SlyD Contributes to Hydrogenase Activity—Many auxiliary proteins for metallocenter assembly in enzymes were originally identified, because genetic mutants are deficient in the enzyme activity (9Blokesch M. Paschos A. Theodoratou E. Bauer A. Hube M. Huth S. Böck A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 674-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To test whether SlyD plays a role in hydrogenase maturation, the slyD gene was disrupted (20Yu D. Ellis H.M. Lee E-C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Court D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 97: 5978-5983Crossref Scopus (1367) Google Scholar). This deletion resulted in a noticeably slower growth rate under our anaerobic conditions (data not shown) to a similar degree as that previously reported for ΔslyD strains grown aerobically (32Roof W.D. Fang H.Q. Young K.D. Sun J. Young R. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 1031-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and this difference was not investigated further. Wild-type and ΔslyD cells were grown under anaerobic conditions for 6 or 17 h, and hydrogenase activity was measured in cell extracts by monitoring anaerobic benzyl viologen reduction in a solution containing hydrogen gas (27Ballantine S.P. Boxer D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 454-459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activity detected in the wild-type extracts prepared after 6 h of growth was similar to that previously reported (29Sawers R.G. Ballantine S.P. Boxer D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 1324-1331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Theodoratou E. Paschos A. Magalon A. Fritsche E. Huber R. Böck A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1995-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and in either strain relatively less hydrogenase activity was routinely detected after the longer growth period (Fig. 3 and data not shown). At both time points, however, hydrogenase activity was significantly abrogated by the slyD deletion (Fig. 3, A and B). To confirm that this phenotype was a result of the slyD deletion and not a downstream polar effect, slyD was expressed in-trans from a pBAD24 vector (34Guzman L-M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3957) Google Scholar) transformed into the ΔslyD strain. The PBAD promoter is induced with arabinose and inhibited by glucose (34Guzman L-M.

https://openalex.org/W2009568124,"High-resolution images of the surface of asteroid 433 Eros revealed evidence of downslope movement of a loose regolith layer, as well as the degradation and erasure of small impact craters (less than ∼100 meters in diameter). One hypothesis to explain these observations is seismic reverberation after impact events. We used a combination of seismic and geomorphic modeling to analyze the response of regolith-covered topography, particularly craters, to impact-induced seismic shaking. Applying these results to a stochastic cratering model for the surface of Eros produced good agreement with the observed size-frequency distribution of craters, including the paucity of small craters."

However, how this occurs is poorly understood. Recently, in vivo analysis of transcriptional termination for the human beta-globin gene revealed a new phenomenon--co-transcriptional cleavage (CoTC). This primary cleavage event within beta-globin pre-messenger RNA, downstream of the poly(A) site, is critical for efficient transcriptional termination by RNA polymerase II. Here we show that the CoTC process in the human beta-globin gene involves an RNA self-cleaving activity. We characterize the autocatalytic core of the CoTC ribozyme and show its functional role in efficient termination in vivo. The identified core CoTC is highly conserved in the 3' flanking regions of other primate beta-globin genes. Functionally, it resembles the 3' processive, self-cleaving ribozymes described for the protein-encoding genes from the myxomycetes Didymium iridis and Physarum polycephalum, indicating evolutionary conservation of this molecular process. We predict that regulated autocatalytic cleavage elements within pre-mRNAs may be a general phenomenon and that functionally it may provide the entry point for exonucleases involved in mRNA maturation, turnover and, in particular, transcriptional termination."
https://openalex.org/W2080135618,"Low Mg2+ promotes phosphorylation of the response regulators PhoP and PmrA and transcription of their activated genes in Salmonella enterica. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we have now determined that the PhoP and PmrA proteins are recruited to the regulatory region of their target genes when bacteria experience low Mg2+ but not when they are grown in high Mg2+. Even when the PhoP protein was artificially produced at 4-fold higher levels than the wild-type strain, promoter occupancy required the low Mg2+ signal. Substitution of the predicted phosphorylation site Asp-52 with a valine residue abolished phosphorylation of the PhoP protein, resulting in loss of PhoP binding to target promoters and transcription of PhoP-activated genes. Our results indicate that the promoter binding ability of the PhoP and PmrA proteins occurring in low Mg2+ is correlated with phosphorylation of these proteins in vivo.

The PhoP/PhoQ two-component system governs the adaptation to low Mg2+, virulence in mammals as well as several other physiological functions in Salmonella enterica and other Gram-negative bacteria (1Groisman E.A.

Low Mg2+ also stimulates transcription of genes under the control of the PmrA/PmrB two-component system (6Soncini F.C. Garcia Vescovi E. Solomon F. Groisman E.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5092-5099Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) in a mechanism that involves the PhoP-activated PmrD protein (7Kox L.F. Wosten M.M. Groisman E.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1861-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) promoting the phosphorylated state of the PmrA protein (8Kato A. Groisman E.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2302-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In vitro experiments have demonstrated that phosphorylation of the PhoP protein promotes a conformational change in its C-terminal DNA-binding domain (9Yamamoto K. Ogasawara H. Fujita N. Utsumi R. Ishihama A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 423-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), which increases the affinity of the PhoP protein for its promoters (9Yamamoto K. Ogasawara H. Fujita N.

Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6287-6294Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Likewise, phospho-PmrA binds more tightly to its target promoters than unphosphorylated PmrA (11Wosten M.M. Groisman E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27185-27190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, overexpression of the PhoP protein can reportedly promote gene transcription in a phoQ mutant or when the putative phosphorylation site of the PhoP protein has been mutated (12Lejona S.

Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2476-2480Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), suggesting that phosphorylation of the PhoP protein may not be required for binding to its target promoters. To examine the role of low Mg2+-induced phosphorylation in PhoP- and PmrA-regulated gene expression, we investigated binding of the PhoP and PmrA proteins to their target DNAs in vivo using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). 1The abbreviations used are: ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; MES, 4-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid; HA, hemagglutinin; IPTG, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactoside; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains used in this study are derived from strain 14028s. Phage P22-mediated transductions were performed as described (13Davis R.W. Bolstein D. Roth J.R. Advanced Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1980Google Scholar). A strain with chromosomally encoded epitope-tagged proteins was constructed as follows. First, the CmR cassette from plasmid pKD3 was amplified using primers 2566 and 2567 and integrated at the 3′ end of the phoP gene in the chromosome by selecting for CmR transformants (14Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11202) Google Scholar). Primer 2566 (5′-CCCGCAGCGACAGCGGCAGAAAATGGCGAGCAAATTTATTCATATGAATATCCTCCTTAG-3′) harbors the sequence immediately downstream of the start codon of phoQ attached to priming site 2 of pKD3 harboring a ribosome binding site and start codon (14Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11202) Google Scholar). Primer 2567 (5′-TACCACCGTACGCGGACAAGGATATCTTTTTGAATTGCGCTATCCGTATGATGTTCCTGATTATGCTAGCCTCTGATGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTCG-3′) was designed to encode the HA sequence immediately upstream of the stop codon of the phoP gene following the priming site 1 sequence of pKD3 (14Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11202) Google Scholar). The CmR cassette was removed using plasmid pCP20 as described (14Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11202) Google Scholar) and the resulting stain was designated EG13918. And second, we used primers 2491 (5′-TCGCGGGTTTGGCTACATGCTGGTTGCCACTGAGGAAAGCGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGTGATGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTCG-3′) and 2482 (5′-TTAAACGCTGGCGAAGGGTCATCGCTCTTCGCTGAAAACGCATATGAATATCCTCCTTAG-3′) to amplify the CmR cassette from plasmid pKD3 and integrated the PCR product at the 3′ end of the pmrA gene in a strategy analogous to that described above. The pmrA-FLAG::CmR allele was then transferred to strain EG13918 by P22 transduction and the CmR cassette was removed using plasmid pCP20. The resulting strain was designated EG13922. The regions corresponding to the junctions between phoP-HA and phoQ, and that of pmrA-FLAG and pmrB were amplified from the chromosome by PCR and were confirmed to have the predicted sequences by nucleotide sequencing. To construct a strain harboring a chromosomal deletion of the phoP and phoQ genes (EG15599), the CmR cassette from plasmid pKD3 was amplified using primers 3726 and 4986 (14Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11202) Google Scholar). Primer 4986 (5′-AACGCTAGACTGTTCTTATTGTTAACACAAGGGAGAAGAGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTCG-3′) carries the sequence immediately upstream of the start codon of the phoP gene following priming site 1 sequence of pKD3 (14Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11202) Google Scholar). Primer 3726 (5′-GGATGCTTAACGAGATGCGTGGAAGAACGCACAGAAATGTCATATGAATATCCTCCTTAG-3′) harbors the sequence immediately downstream of the stop codon of phoQ attached to priming site 2 of pKD3 (14Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11202) Google Scholar). The resulting PCR product was integrated into the chromosome as described above. Deletion of the phoP and phoQ genes was verified by PCR and transferred to the wild-type strain by P22 transduction.Fig. 2The PhoP and PmrA proteins are recruited to their target promoters in response to the low Mg2+ signal. A, in vivo PhoP and PmrA binding to target promoters in wild-type (14028s) and tagged (EG13922) strains examined using ChIP assay. Immunoprecipitated (IP) and total (input) DNA were subject to PCR using primers specific to target promoters. B, the results of the PCR shown in A were quantified using a phosphorimager. The “relative IP” of each promoter represents the value of the immunoprecipitated signal divided by the particular input signal, which corresponds to the total DNA before precipitation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IBacterial strains and plasmids used in this studyStrain or plasmidDescriptionRef. or sourceS. enterica serovar Typhimurium 14028sWild-type28Fields P.I.

Vescovi E.G. Groisman E.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4364-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) a PCR fragment containing the phoP-HA/phoQ coding region generated with primers 2851 (5′-CGGAATTCAACACAAGGGAGAAGAGATGATGCG-3′), 2852 (5′-AACTGCAGTGCGTGGAAGAACGCACAGAAATG-3′), and chromosomal DNA from strain EG13918 as template. Sequence of the phoP-HA/phoQ region in the recombinant plasmid was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Plasmids for overexpression of variants of PhoP (D52V substitution) or PhoQ (T281R substitution) were constructed using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani broth (LB) (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or N-minimal medium, pH 7.7 (17Snavely M.D. Gravina S.A. Cheung T.T. Miller C.G. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 824-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), supplemented with 0.1% casamino acids, 38 mm glycerol, and the indicated concentration of MgCl2. Ampicillin and isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactoside (IPTG) were used at 50 μg/ml and 0.5 mm, respectively. Western Blot Analysis—Bacteria were grown in N-minimal medium, pH 7.7, with 10 mm or 10 μm MgCl2 to A600: 0.3 to 0.4, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and opened by sonication. A whole cell lysate (30 μg of protein) was run on a bis-Tris 4–12% gradient gel (Invitrogen) with MES-SDS running buffer, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and analyzed by Western blot using monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Sigma). Western blot was developed using anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody and the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). In Vivo Phosphorylation of the PhoP Protein—Cells were grown in low phosphate N-minimal medium (0.3 mm phosphate) supplemented with 10 mm or 10 μm MgCl2. Cells in mid-exponential growth phase were taken and incubated with 100 μCi of 32-phosphorus (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min. After centrifugation, cells were suspended in 50 μl of lysis solution (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, and 4% SDS), which was 20-fold diluted with ice-cold IP buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS). The PhoP protein was immunoprecipitated using monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Sigma) and a protein A affinity gel (Sigma) sequentially. After vigorously washing the beads (three times with IP buffer), the precipitates were eluted with 2× SDS sample buffer at 37 °C for 5 min and resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After drying the gel, autoradiography was performed for detection of phosphorylated proteins. β-Galactosidase Assay—β-Galactosidase assays were carried out in duplicate and the activity was determined as described (18Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). All assays correspond to mean values of three independent experiments done in duplicate. Error bars correspond to the standard deviation (and are only shown if larger than the resolution of the figure). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—ChIP assays were performed as described (19Kuras L. Struhl K. Nature. 1999; 399: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. After bacterial growth, formaldehyde (1%) was added to the cultures and placed at room temperature for 15 min, before quenching the reaction with glycine (125 mm) for 5 min. Cells were collected and washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline twice. The cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis solution (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 20% sucrose, 10 mg/ml lysozyme) and 0.5 ml of 2× RIPA solution (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 2% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS). The cell extract was sonicated to fragment DNA to an average size of 500 bp. Fifty microliters of the extract was removed for total DNA preparation. For immunoprecipitation of PhoP cross-linked DNA, a portion of the extracts (400 μl) was incubated with 4 μl of monoclonal anti-HA H7 antibody (Sigma) at 4 °C for 4 h. PmrA cross-linked DNA was immunoprecipitated with 4 μl of monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) using the same cell extract. After incubation with Protein G affinity gel (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed twice with 1× RIPA solution, then twice with LiCl/detergent solution (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mm LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate), and finally with TE buffer. The immunoprecipitated material was eluted with 100 μl of elution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS). Cross-linking of immunoprecipitated and total DNA was reversed by incubation at 65 °C overnight. After Proteinase K (Invitrogen) treatment, the immunoprecipitated and total DNA were purified using phenol extraction, precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in TE buffer. Quantitative PCR Analysis—Analysis of the immunoprecipitated DNA was performed using quantitative PCR as described (19Kuras L. Struhl K. Nature. 1999; 399: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). All promoter-specific primers used in this study are listed in Table II. Reactions were performed in 25 μl containing 1/100 of immunoprecipitated DNA (or 1/10,000 of total DNA), 1 μm of each primer, 0.1 mm dNTPs, and 0.1 mCi/ml of [α-32P]dATP with 27 cycles of amplification. To determine the linearity of the reactions, the PCRs were performed with each set of primers and serially diluted total DNA as templates. The PCR products were resolved on a 5% polyacrylamide gel and the signals of the products were quantified using a FLA-5000 Imaging System (Fuji Film).Table IIPromoter-specific primers used in ChIP assayPrimersTarget promotersSequences2777phoP forward5′-TGAAACAGTTTATTGATAGTCTGGC-3′2778phoP reverse5′-GTGGCGTAATAATGCATTATCCTC-3′2779mgtA forward5′-GGCGATGTCTTTGATAGTGAGCCG-3′2780mgtA reverse5′-CCTCCGGTAAGTAAATAATTTGCGC-3′2783pmrD forward5′-AGACGTGAACCTCGCTGAATG-3′2784pmrD reverse5′-ACAGCACCAGAACATGGCAC-3′2785pmrC forward5′-TGATGGTGATCACCGCGCTGTATG-3′2786pmrC reverse5′-TCAGGCAGACGGCAATATAAAAGG-3′3005pbgP forward5′-AATGAAATTCCGCAACGGAAGACCAGG-3′3006pbgP reverse5′-GCCGCTTTTCAAATATTTCGGCAATAG-3′3552mgtC forward5′-TACGTGCAGGCATCATAACAGAGC-3′3553mgtC reverse5′-TAGCGTGCGTTAACTTGCCAGATG-3′ Open table in a new tab For quantification of the immunoprecipitated DNA, real-time PCR was used. The reaction containing the 1/50 of immunoprecipitated DNA (or 1/1,000 of total DNA) was performed using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and amplification of the PCR product was analyzed using the ABI 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). For amplification of the mgtA, phoP, and rpoD promoter regions, primers 3041 (5′-TCAAGCGAAGGGCAATGG-3′) and 3042 (5′-ATGGCGGTATCATACCGTTACG-3′), and primers 3039 (5′-ATCGGTCGCGCTGTGACT-3′) and 3040 (5′-AGAGGGTGAGGCAGGCATT-3′), and primers 4149 (5′-ACCGTGGCACAAATGATGCT-3′) and 4150 (5′-TCGGCAATCGCCTTATCTG-3′) were used, respectively. The amount of PCR product was calculated from standard curves obtained from PCR with promoter-specific primers and serially diluted total DNA. A Strain Expressing Chromosomally Encoded Epitope-tagged PhoP and PmrA Proteins That Displays a Wild-type Response to Mg2+—To facilitate the recovery of DNA fragments bound by the PhoP and PmrA proteins, we constructed a strain (EG13922) that expressed a PhoP protein with an HA epitope tag at its C terminus and a PmrA protein with a FLAG epitope tag at its C terminus from their respective wild-type promoters and chromosomal locations as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1A). We established that strain EG13922 displayed a normal response to Mg2+ as transcription of the PhoP-activated mgtA and pmrD genes, and of the PmrA-activated pmrC and pbgP genes was induced in low (10 μm) Mg2+ and repressed in high (10 mm) Mg2+ N-minimal medium, pH 7.7 (17Snavely M.D. Gravina S.A. Cheung T.T. Miller C.G. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 824-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the epitope-tagged PhoP and PmrA proteins promoted gene transcription at similar levels as the wild-type PhoP and PmrA proteins (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that the HA and FLAG tags do not interfere with the ability of the PhoP and PmrA proteins to regulate gene transcription. Binding of the PhoP and PmrA Proteins to Their Target Promoters Is Dependent on Low Mg2+ Signal—To examine binding of the PhoP and PmrA proteins to their target promoters in vivo, we carried out a ChIP experiment (19Kuras L. Struhl K. Nature. 1999; 399: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) using bacteria experiencing either high (10 mm) or low (10 μm) Mg2+. When PCR was performed on the DNA that was precipitated with the anti-HA antibody (to recover DNA fragments bound by the PhoP protein) using primers specific for the mgtA and pmrD promoters, a dramatic enrichment of PhoP-associated DNA was observed for the epitope-tagged strain grown in low Mg2+ (Fig. 2, A and B). On the other hand, PhoP barely bound to the mgtA and pmrD promoters in cells experiencing high Mg2+ (Fig. 2, A and B). Analysis of the PmrA-dependent pmrC and pbgP promoters showed the same binding pattern: PmrA-associated DNA was observed only in the epitope-tagged strain grown in low Mg2+ (Fig. 2, A and B). The ChIP assay was specific because: first, there was no significant enrichment of PhoP- and PmrA-bound DNA to the examined promoters when a wild-type (i.e. lacking epitope tags) strain was used (Fig. 2, A and B). And second, no products were recovered when the PCR was performed using primers specific for the phoP coding region or the rpoD promoter, which lack sequences resembling the PhoP box (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the PhoP and PmrA proteins bind to their target promoters in response to low Mg2+. PhoP Recruitment to Target Promoters Requires the Low Mg2+ Signal Even When the PhoP Protein Is Produced at Nonphysiological Higher Levels—Because transcription of the phoPQ operon is positively autoregulated (15Soncini F.C. Vescovi E.G. Groisman E.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4364-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), binding of the PhoP protein to the mgtA and pmrD promoters in cells experiencing low Mg2+ (Fig. 2, A and B) could be mediated by the PhoP protein present at higher levels (as opposed to higher levels of phosphorylated PhoP protein). To address this issue, we constructed a strain that lacked the ability to positively autoregulate phoPQ transcription because it was deleted for the chromosomal copy of the phoP gene and harbored plasmid pEG13918, which expressed the phoP-HA and phoQ genes from the lac promoter. Western blot analysis revealed that, as expected, production of the PhoP protein was dependent on the inducer of the lac promoter IPTG and independent of the Mg2+ concentration (Fig. 3A). When grown in low Mg2+ and in the presence of IPTG (final concentration 0.5 mm), the PhoP protein levels were 4-fold higher in the strain with the plasmidencoded PhoP-HA than in the strain producing the chromosomally encoded PhoP-HA protein (data not shown). We established that binding of the PhoP protein to the PhoP-activated phoP, mgtA, and mgtC promoters required both IPTG and low Mg2+, as cells experiencing IPTG and high Mg2+ displayed weak PhoP binding to these promoters (Fig. 3, B and C). No significant binding of the PhoP protein was observed in cells grown without IPTG regardless of the Mg2+ levels (Fig. 3, B and C). The transcriptional activities of the three examined promoters were consistent with the results of the ChIP experiment: expression was observed only in cells grown with IPTG and low Mg2+ (Fig. 3D), even though this strain produced similar levels of PhoP protein in high and low Mg2+ (Fig. 3A). The D52V Mutation in the Putative Phosphorylation Site of the PhoP Protein Prevents PhoP Binding to Its Target Promoters in Vivo—To examine the role of phosphorylation on promoter occupancy, we conducted a ChIP experiment using cells that expressed a mutant form of PhoP with the D52V amino acid substitution in its predicted phosphorylation site. The D52V mutation abolishes transcription of PhoP-regulated genes (4Chamnongpol S. Groisman E.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 291-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Binding to the target promoters was not detected with the PhoPD52V protein in cells experiencing the low Mg2+ signal (Fig. 4, A and B), which is in contrast to what we observed using the PhoP protein with the intact phosphorylation site (Fig. 3, B and C). The DNA Binding Ability of the PhoP Protein Is Correlated with Its Phosphorylation State in Vivo—To examine the phosphorylation state of the PhoP protein in vivo, we constructed two isogenic strains that were deleted in the chromosomal copy of the phoPQ operon and carried plasmids expressing PhoP and PhoQ variants from the lac promoter. Plasmid pEG13920 encodes wild-type PhoP-HA protein and the mutant PhoQT281R protein, whereas plasmid pEG13921 produces the PhoPD52V-HA protein and the PhoQT281R protein. We used the PhoQT281R mutant because response regulators are often dephosphorylated due to the phosphatase activity of their cognate sensors, and the T281R mutation was predicted to abolish the phosphatase activity of the sensor PhoQ. Cells harboring either pEG13920 or pEG13921 were grown with 32-phosphorus and the PhoP protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. Phosphorylation of the wild-type PhoP protein was observed in cells grown in media containing IPTG (Fig. 5A). Phosphorylation was detected even in high Mg2+ concentrations, presumably because PhoQT281R protein fails to dephosphorylate phospho-PhoP (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the D52V mutation abrogated phosphorylation of the PhoP protein (Fig. 5A). The absence of phosphorylation is not due to decreased protein levels because the Western blot assay showed that both the wild-type and mutant PhoP proteins were expressed at similar levels when IPTG was added to the media (Fig. 5B). ChIP analysis revealed that PhoP binding to its target promoters is correlated with the phosphorylation state of the PhoP protein in vivo: PhoP bound to the mgtA and phoP promoters only when PhoP was phosphorylated (Fig. 5C). Transcriptional activity of mgtA was consistent with the result of the ChIP assay: binding of phosphorylated PhoP protein to mgtA promoter resulted in transcription of mgtA (Fig. 5D). These results indicate that phosphorylation of PhoP is necessary for PhoP binding to its target promoters and transcriptional activation of target genes. In bacterial two-component systems, sensor proteins modify the phosphorylation state of their cognate response regulators usually in response to external stimuli (20Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-Component Signal Transduction. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Crossref Google Scholar). Response regulators are typically DNA binding transcription factors whose phosphorylation can have two possible roles: (i) it can promote DNA binding, possibly by stimulating response regulator oligomerization (21Nakashima K. Kanamaru K. Aiba H. Mizuno T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10775-10780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Porter S.C. North A.K. Wedel A.B. Kustu S. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2258-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 23Fiedler U. Weiss V. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3696-3705Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar); and/or (ii) modulate activities of the regulators taking place after DNA binding (e.g. the interaction between the response regulator and RNA polymerase) (24Chen Y. Abdel-Fattah W.R. Hulett F.M. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1493-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Our in vivo experiments with the response regulator PhoP have demonstrated that, when the Salmonella PhoP/PhoQ system is physiologically activated by low Mg2+, binding of the PhoP protein to its target promoter sequences is correlated with phosphorylation of the PhoP protein because: (i) PhoP bound to its target promoters when Salmonella experienced the low Mg2+ inducing signal (Fig. 2), which has been shown to promote the phosphorylated form of the PhoP protein (3Castelli M.E. Garcia Vescovi E. Soncini F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22948-22954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 4Chamnongpol S. Groisman E.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 291-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 5Montagne M. Martel A. Le Moual H. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1787-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); (ii) PhoP did not bind to its target promoters when Salmonella experienced the high Mg2+ repressing signal even when the PhoP protein was produced at levels that were four times higher than those normally produced from the autoregulated phoPQ operon (Fig. 3, B and C); and (iii) D52V substitution in the PhoP protein prevented both PhoP phosphorylation and the ability of PhoP to bind DNA (Figs. 4 and 5). Phosphorylation may be important to promote dimerization of the PhoP protein, which may be the form that binds DNA because PhoP appears to recognize a direct hexanucleotide repeat (9Yamamoto K. Ogasawara H. Fujita N. Utsumi R. Ishihama A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 423-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Therefore, conditions that promote PhoP dimerization may bypass the requirement for PhoP phosphorylation in DNA binding and gene transcription. For example, in vitro experiments have shown that unphosphorylated PhoP protein can specifically bind to DNA (10Lejona S. Aguirre A. Cabeza M.L. Vescovi GarciaE. Soncini F.C. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6287-6294Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 25Minagawa S. Ogasawara H. Kato A. Yamamoto K. Eguchi Y. Oshima T. Mori H. Ishihama A. Utsumi R. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3696-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and promote transcription from the mgtA promoter (9Yamamoto K. Ogasawara H. Fujita N. Utsumi R. Ishihama A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 423-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Likewise, overexpression of the PhoP protein at >10-fold higher levels than those normally produced by the wild-type strain from its promoters allowed transcription of PhoP-regulated genes even in the absence of the sensor protein PhoQ, which is required for PhoP phosphorylation (12Lejona S. Castelli M.E. Cabeza M.L. Kenney L.J. Garcia Vescovi E. Soncini F.C. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2476-2480Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The stimulation of DNA binding resulting from phosphorylation may be a general feature of response regulators because binding of the PmrA protein to its target promoters was also signal dependent: it was detected in organisms experiencing low Mg2+ but not in those exposed to high Mg2+ (Fig. 2). Low Mg2+ promotes the synthesis of the PhoP-activated PmrD protein, which binds to the phosphorylated form of the PmrA protein protecting it from dephosphorylation by PmrB, the cognate sensor of PmrA (8Kato A. Groisman E.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2302-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Taken together with the finding that phosphorylated PmrA binds its target promoters with higher affinity than unphosphorylated PmrA (11Wosten M.M. Groisman E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27185-27190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the stimulation in gene transcription that takes place in low Mg2+ (7Kox L.F. Wosten M.M. Groisman E.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1861-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) is likely because of increased binding by phosphorylated PmrA. Finally, it has been proposed that binding of E. coli OmpR to its specific target sequences stimulates OmpR phosphorylation (26Ames S.K. Frankema N. Kenney L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11792-11797Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Whereas this implies that unphosphorylated OmpR binds efficiently to DNA, others did not find DNA to have a stimulatory effect on OmpR phosphorylation by its cognate sensor EnvZ (27Qin L. Yoshida T. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 908-913PubMed Google Scholar), and our results with the PhoP and PmrA proteins indicate that it is unlikely to be a general phenomenon."

Analysis of haploid yeast cells and their response to peptide mating pheromones has produced important advances in our understanding of G protein and MAP kinase signaling mechanisms. Many of the components, their interrelationships, and their regulators were first identified in yeast.

https://openalex.org/W2062615292,"Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a promising cancer therapy that preferentially induces apoptosis in cancer cells. However, many neoplasms are resistant to TRAIL by mechanisms that are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that human breast cancer cells, but not normal mammary epithelial cells, are dramatically sensitized to TRAIL-induced apoptosis and caspase activation by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) agonists of the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class. Although TZDs do not significantly alter the expression of components of the TRAIL signaling pathway, they profoundly reduce protein levels of cyclin D3, but not other D-type cyclins, by decreasing cyclin D3 mRNA levels and by inducing its proteasomal degradation. Importantly, both TRAIL sensitization and reduction in cyclin D3 protein levels induced by TZDs are likely PPARγ-independent because a dominant negative mutant of PPARγ did not antagonize these effects of TZDs, nor were they affected by the expression levels of PPARγ. TZDs also inhibit G1 to S cell cycle progression. Furthermore, silencing cyclin D3 by RNA interference inhibits S phase entry and sensitizes breast cancer cells to TRAIL, indicating a key role for cyclin D3 repression in these events. G1 cell cycle arrest sensitizes breast cancer cells to TRAIL at least in part by reducing levels of the anti-apoptotic protein survivin: ectopic expression of survivin partially suppresses apoptosis induced by TRAIL and TZDs.

Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). Although TNF-α and FasL induce apoptosis in both normal and cancer cells, TRAIL preferentially induces apoptosis in transformed cells. TRAIL initiates apoptosis by binding to its DR4 and DR5 death receptors, which contain a cytoplasmic death domain that serves as a protein interaction module to recruit the death domain-containing adaptor protein FADD to the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) (2Schneider P.

However, type II cells require the mitochondria to amplify the cell death signal: caspase-8 cleaves the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member BID, which triggers its translocation to the mitochondria and the release of cytochrome c and Smac into the cytoplasm (7Li H.

TRAIL also has three decoy receptors (DcR1, DcR2, and osteoprotegerin), which inhibit apoptosis by sequestering TRAIL from DR4 and DR5 death receptors (3LeBlanc H.N. Ashkenazi A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar).TRAIL is expressed in hepatic natural killer cells and is essential for natural killer cell-mediated tumor surveillance: inhibition of TRAIL with blocking antibodies or germ-line deletion of TRAIL sensitizes mice to carcinogen-induced fibrosarcomas and promotes primary tumor growth and metastasis in experimental models (11Takeda K.

Consistent with its normal physiologic function, recombinant soluble TRAIL potently induces apoptosis in a variety of human cancer cells in vitro and in xenograft carcinomas in vivo (13Ashkenazi A.

Furthermore, a monoclonal antibody targeting DR5 was recently demonstrated to induce apoptosis in human hepatocellular and breast carcinomas in vitro and in xenograft tumors in vivo without causing liver toxicity (17Ichikawa K.

Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that activation of the TRAIL signaling pathway (via ligand and/or agonistic antibodies) may be an effective cancer therapy with limited toxicity.Unfortunately, many human cancers are resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis or become resistant to TRAIL when TRAIL is used as a single agent (19Keane M.M.

Clearly, the identification of drugs that sensitize tumors to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, without compromising its tumor selectivity, could substantially broaden the therapeutic impact of TRAIL. Indeed, radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs have been shown to promote TRAIL-induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo at least in part by increasing the expression of DR5 and Bax/Bak (19Keane M.M.

However, these cancer therapies have significant systemic toxicity.In an effort to identify non-toxic agents that sensitize tumors to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, we postulated that drugs that bind to and activate PPARγ, a ligand-activated transcription factor of the nuclear hormone receptor family (27Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37731-37734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar), might alter the expression of proteins that regulate TRAIL-induced apoptosis and “reprogram” TRAIL-resistant tumors to respond to TRAIL. Synthetic agonists of PPARγ, the thiazolidinediones (TZDs) troglitazone and rosiglitazone, inhibit the growth of xenograft tumors at high doses (150–1000 mg/kg/day) by inducing G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (28Elstner E.

In addition, a structurally unrelated PPARγ agonist (GW7845) was shown to be effective as a chemoprevention agent in a rat mammary carcinogenesis model (31Suh N. Wang Y. Williams C.R. Risingsong R. Gilmer T. Willson T.M. Sporn M.B. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5671-5673PubMed Google Scholar). The antitumor effects of TZDs require an intact adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene: treatment of ApcMin/+ mice with these drugs paradoxically increases polyp formation (32Lefebvre A.M. Chen I.

Although PPARγ ligands have been shown previously to promote TRAIL-induced apoptosis in vitro (35Goke R. Goke A. Goke B. Chen Y. Cell.

Chem. 2002; 277: 22320-22329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), we demonstrate here that PPARγ agonists promote TRAIL-induced apoptosis by a novel PPARγ-independent mechanism, viz. by selectively repressing cyclin D3, a cell cycle regulator overexpressed in diverse cancers (37Bartkova J.

Cyclin D3 repression, in turn, induces G1 cell cycle arrest and reduces the levels of survivin, an anti-apoptotic protein whose expression is cell cycle-regulated with lowest levels at G1 (40Li F. Ambrosini G. Chu E.Y. Plescia J. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar), thereby linking G1 arrest to TRAIL-sensitivity. In addition, we show for the first time that TZDs sensitize human breast carcinomas to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in vivo, suggesting that the combination of TZDs and TRAIL may be an effective therapy for cancer.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Reagents—Human MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-468, and T47D breast carcinoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 4.5 g/liter glucose and 4 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Human mammary epithelial cells (Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ) were cultured according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell cultures were grown in 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. The PPARγ agonists used in these studies were troglitazone (TGZ) (kindly provided by Dr. Andrea Dunaif, Northwestern University) and rosiglitazone (RSG) (Avandia, GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC).Expression and Large Scale Purification of Recombinant TRAIL— BL-21 competent cells (Novagen, Madison, WI) were transformed with a pET15b plasmid (Novagen) containing a partial TRAIL cDNA encoding amino acids 95–281 (41Pan G. O'Rourke K. Chinnaiyan A.M. Gentz R. Ebner R. Ni J. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 276: 111-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar). Protein expression was induced by adding 2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to exponentially growing bacterial cultures (OD600 0.5–0.7), and His-tagged TRAIL was purified under native conditions using the QIAexpressionist system (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and protein assay (Bio-Rad) to determine the amount of purified TRAIL; those fractions with high concentrations of TRAIL were pooled. Aliquots were stored in 10% glycerol at –80 °C.Apoptosis Experiments—Cancer cells were treated with TGZ (0–50 μm) or RSG (0–50 μm) for 48 h and then treated with TRAIL (0–2.5 μg/ml) for 16 additional h. To score apoptosis, nuclei were visualized by staining with Hoescht 33258 (Sigma-Aldrich) as described previously (42Kamradt M.C. Chen F. Cryns V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16059-16063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 43Byun Y. Chen F. Chang R. Trivedi M. Green K.J. Cryns V.L. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), and the percentage of nuclei with apoptotic condensation or fragmentation was determined. At least 200 nuclei were scored per experiment and all experiments were performed three times; the data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance of differences was examined by two-tailed, paired Student's t test. Cell death was also measured by flow cytometry using the Annexin-PE apoptosis detection kit I (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Annexin V-positive cells were scored as apoptotic.PPARγ Adenovirus Experiments—Adenoviral constructs expressing wild-type murine PPARγ (Ad-WT PPARγ), dominant-negative murine L466A PPARγ (Ad-DN PPARγ), or control β-galactosidase (Ad-βGal) were described previously (44Park Y. Freedman B.D. Lee E.J. Jameson J.L. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 365-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells were infected with Ad-βGal, Ad-WT PPARγ, or Ad-DN PPARγ at 25 plaque-forming units per cell as detailed (44Park Y. Freedman B.D. Lee E.J. Jameson J.L. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 365-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Seven hours later, adenovirus-infected cells were treated with vehicle alone, TGZ alone, TRAIL alone, or the combination of TGZ and TRAIL, and apoptosis was scored as described above.Immunoblotting—Cell lysates were prepared in modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 1% Nonidet P-40) and analyzed by immunoblotting as described (45Cryns V.L. Bergeron L. Zhu H. Li H. Yuan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31277-31282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used for immunoblotting: DR4, DR5, DcR2 (Stressgen, Victoria, Canada), tubulin, FLAG, phospho-RB (Sigma-Aldrich), caspase-3, p27, RIP, Bcl-XL, cyclin D3, cyclin A, CDK2, CDK4, FADD, TRADD, DcR1, FLIP, caspase-8, Bak, PARP, p21 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), XIAP and survivin (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), Bcl-2, PPARγ, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and Bax (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and BID (kindly provided by Dr. Honglin Li, Northwestern University). To determine whether inhibition of cyclin D3 expression by TGZ was mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, cells were preincubated with vehicle or 50 μm TGZ for 48 h, and then treated with the proteasomal inhibitor epoxomicin (200 nm, EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) for an additional 16 h.Real-time RT-PCR—MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells were treated with vehicle or 50 μm TGZ for 64 h. Total RNA was extracted from these cells with the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was prepared using Superscript First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). CyclinD3 mRNA and human 18 S rRNA (for normalization) were amplified by real-time PCR using iQ Supermix and an iCycler iQ real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Primers and probes for Cyclin D3 and 18 S rRNA were designed with Primer Express TM1.5 software (Applied Biosystems) set at default parameters to select optimized primer and probe sets. The cyclin D3 primers were 5′-TGGTCCTAGGGAAGCTCAAGTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTGTAGCACAGAGGGCCAAAA-3′ (reverse). The probe for cyclin D3 was 5′-[FAM]-CTTCATTCTGCACCGGCTCTCTCTGC-[BHQ]-3′. The primers for 18 S rRNA were 5′-CGGCTACCACATCCAAGGAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCTGGAATTACCGCGGCT-3′ (reverse). The 18 S rRNA probe was 5′-[FAM]-TGCTGGCACCAGACTTGCCCTC-[Qsy7]-3′. 100 ng of total cDNA, 100 nm probe, and 200 nm primers were used in PCR reactions (40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min).Construction of pSUPER-Cyclin D3 and RNAi Experiments— pSUPER was made as described (46Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3941) Google Scholar) and verified by DNA sequencing. To create pSUPER-cyclin D3 the following oligonucleotides were annealed: 5′-gatccccGACCAGCACTCCTACAGATttcaagagaATCTGTAGGAGTGCTGGTCtttttggaaa-3′ and 5′-agcttttccaaaaaGACCAGCACTCCTACAGATtctcttgaaATCTGTAGGAGTGCTGGTCggg-3′ (the capitalized letters are the cyclin D3 target sequence corresponding to nucleotides 840–858). After annealing, the oligonucleotides were ligated into the corresponding BglII and HindIII sites in pSUPER, and the sequence of the silencing construct was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma cells were co-transfected with 0.2 μg of pEGFP-N1 (BD Bioscience) and 0.8 μg of pSUPER-cyclin D3 or pSUPER vector using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Forty-eight hours later, GFP-positive cells were sorted by FACS analysis and analyzed for cyclin D1, cyclin D3 and survivin expression by immunoblotting. Alternatively, for apoptosis experiments, MDA-MB 435 cells were co-transfected with pEGFP-N1 and pSUPER-cyclin D3 (or pSUPER vector), and 48 h later, treated with vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline) or 2.5 μg/ml TRAIL for an additional 24 h. GFP-positive cells were identified by immunofluorescence as detailed previously (47Chen F. Kamradt M. Mulcahy M. Byun Y. Xu H. McKay M.J. Cryns V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16775-16781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and nuclei were scored for apoptosis as described under “Apoptosis Experiments.”Cell Cycle Blockade—MDA-MB-435 cells were treated with vehicle, double thymidine block (overnight 2 mm thymidine treatment on two consecutive nights with normal growth media between thymidine treatments) or nocodazole (0.1 μg/ml) for 24 h, and cells were then treated with 2.5 μg/ml TRAIL for an additional 8 h. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed by propidium iodide staining for DNA content using flow cytometry, and cell death was measured using the Annexin-PE Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Bioscience).Survivin Transfection Experiments—MDA-MB-435 cells were co-transfected with 0.2 μg of pEGFP-N1 (BD Bioscience) and 0.8 μg of pcDNA3 vector or pcDNA3-survivin using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen). 24 h later, transfected cells were treated with TGZ (0–50 μm) for 48 h and then treated with TRAIL (0–2.5 μg/ml) for an additional 16 h. Apoptosis was measured in transfected (GFP-positive) cells by flow cytometry using the Annexin-PE Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Bioscience).Xenograft Tumor Experiments—2.5 × 106 MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma cells were implanted subcutaneously (s.c.) into the mammary fat pads of a single 4–5-week old female athymic nude mouse (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Madison, WI) and xenograft tumors established. 1-mm3 pieces of the xenograft tumor were then transplanted s.c. into both mammary fat pads of 4–5-week old female athymic nude mice. Two weeks after tumor implantation, mice were randomized into 6 treatment groups (10 mice per group) for 5 weeks: 0.75% methylcellulose vehicle (Sigma-Aldrich), RSG 20 mg/kg/day by oral gavage, RSG 50 mg/kg/day by oral gavage, TRAIL 5 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally, RSG 20 mg/kg/day orally + TRAIL 5 mg/kg/day intraperitoneal, or RSG 50 mg/kg/day orally + TRAIL 5 mg/kg/day intraperitoneal. Tumors were measured weekly with Vernier calipers, and tumor volume was calculated using the equation: tumor volume (mm3) = (length × width2) × π /6. To determine the effect of these treatments on the induction of apoptosis, female athymic nude mice with established MDA-MB-435 xenograft tumors were treated for 2 weeks with vehicle, RSG 50 mg/kg/day by oral gavage, TRAIL 10 mg/kg/day intraperitoneal, or RSG and TRAIL. Xenograft tumors were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned by standard methods. Apoptotic nuclei were identified by TUNEL assay (in Situ Cell Death Detection kit, TMR Red, Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Tumors were also analyzed for cyclin D3 and survivin levels as described in “Immunoblotting.” All procedures involving animals were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Northwestern University.RESULTSPPARγ Agonists Sensitize Human Breast Cancer Cells, but Not Normal Human Mammary Epithelial Cells, to TRAIL-induced Apoptosis in Vitro—To examine whether PPARγ agonists might restore the sensitivity of TRAIL-resistant human cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, we incubated estrogen receptor (ER)-negative human MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma cells with the synthetic PPARγ agonist troglitazone (TGZ, 0–50 μm) for 48 h and then added TRAIL (0–2.5 μg/ml) for an additional 16 h. MDA-MB-435 cancer cells were highly resistant to TRAIL alone: <10% of these cells were apoptotic after treatment with 2.5 μg/ml TRAIL (Fig. 1A). Similarly, TGZ alone (at concentrations ≤50 μm) did not induce apoptosis in these cancer cells. However, TGZ (50 μm but not 10 μm) dramatically sensitized MDA-MB-435 cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, with >60% apoptosis induction in cells treated with 50 μm TGZ and 2.5 μg/ml TRAIL. Similar results were observed when apoptosis was measured by annexin V labeling (Fig. 1B). TGZ also sensitized T47D and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells to TRAIL (data not shown). A second synthetic PPARγ agonist, rosiglitazone (RSG), also acted synergistically with TRAIL to promote apoptosis in human T47D breast cancer cells, an ER-positive, TRAIL-resistant breast cancer cell line (Fig. 1C). Like TGZ, RSG did not induce apoptosis when used as a single agent, but sensitized T47D breast cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (some synergy was seen with 10 μm RSG). Taken together, these findings indicate that TZDs promote TRAIL-induced apoptosis in multiple TRAIL-resistant breast cancer cell lines.Because much of the enthusiasm for TRAIL stems from its ability to preferentially indu"
https://openalex.org/W1995670880,"Abstract Scorpion β-toxins that affect the activation of mammalian voltage-gated sodium channels (Navs) have been studied extensively, but little is known about their functional surface and mode of interaction with the channel receptor. To enable a molecular approach to this question, we have established a successful expression system for the anti-mammalian scorpion β-toxin, Css4, whose effects on rat brain Navs have been well characterized. A recombinant toxin, His-Css4, was obtained when fused to a His tag and a thrombin cleavage site and had similar binding affinity for and effect on Na currents of rat brain sodium channels as those of the native toxin isolated from the scorpion venom. Molecular dissection of His-Css4 elucidated a functional surface of 1245 A2 composed of the following: 1) a cluster of residues associated with the α-helix, which includes a putative “hot spot” (this cluster is conserved among scorpion β-toxins and contains their “pharmacophore”); 2) a hydrophobic cluster associated mainly with the β2 and β3 strands, which is likely to confer the specificity for mammalian Navs; 3) a single bioactive residue (Trp-58) in the C-tail; and 4) a negatively charged residue (Glu-15) involved in voltage sensor trapping as inferred from our ability to uncouple toxin binding from activity upon its substitution. This study expands our understanding about the mode of action of scorpion β-toxins and illuminates differences in the functional surfaces that may dictate their specificities for mammalian versus insect sodium channels."
https://openalex.org/W2077697175,"The induction of apoptosis in neutrophils is an essential event in the resolution of an inflammatory process. We found recently that the reduction of the activity of the neutrophil survival factor p38 MAPK and dephosphorylation and thus activation of caspases must occur to initiate such cell death in these leukocytes. Here, we report a previously undetected early and transient activation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in neutrophils undergoing apoptosis. The pharmacological inhibition of this phosphatase during Fas-induced apoptosis augmented the levels of phosphorylation of both p38 MAPK and caspase 3, resulting in a decreased activity of caspase 3 and an increased neutrophil survival. The complementary finding of a time-dependent association among PP2A, p38 MAPK, and caspase 3 in intact neutrophils indicated that there is a direct regulatory link among these signaling enzymes during Fas-provoked apoptosis. Moreover, immunoprecipitated active p38 MAPK and recombinant phosphorylated caspase 3 were dephosphorylated by exposure to purified PP2A in vitro. Consequently, the early and temporary activation of PP2A in neutrophils impaired not only the p38 MAPK-mediated inhibition of caspase 3 but also restored the activity to caspase 3 that had already been phosphorylated and thereby inactivated.

Human neutrophils are short-lived cells that undergo apoptosis soon after they are released from the bone marrow (1Cartwright G.E. Athens G.W. Wintrobe M.M. Blood. 1964; 24: 780-803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Grigg J.M. Savill J.S. Sarraf C. Haslett C. Silverman M. Lancet. 1991; 338: 720-722Abstract PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 3Savill J.S.

The life span of these leukocytes is regulated by endogenous factors and extracellular stimuli, which in turn determine the length of an inflammatory process. Neutrophil apoptosis can be delayed by several factors in the local environment, such as lipopolysaccharides and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, whereas it is accelerated by Fas ligand (4Haslett C. Br. Med. Bull. 1997; 53: 669-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 5Ward I. Dransfield I. Chilvers E.R. Haslett I. Rossi A.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 503-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Knowledge about the signaling mechanisms involved in the regulation of apoptosis in human neutrophils is still fairly limited, in part because of methodological limitations, that is, the short life span of neutrophils rules out transfection, and microinjection of these cells is not feasible (6Glogauer M. Hartwig J. Stossel T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In previous studies, our research team (7Alvarado-Kristensson M. Porn-Ares M.I. Grethe S. Smith D. Zheng L. Andersson T. FASEB J. 2001; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) and other investigators (8Aoshiba K. Yasui S. Hayashi M. Tamaoki J. Nagai A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1692-1700PubMed Google Scholar) have observed that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PP, protein phosphatase; Ab, antibody; Cal, calyculin; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; ATF, activating transcription factor. exhibits constitutive activity in freshly isolated human neutrophils, and we noted that this activity is transiently decreased and subsequently regained during spontaneous and Fas-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we proposed that the constitutive activity of p38 MAPK in neutrophils is probably caused by factors present in the blood; therefore, the elimination of such elements during the isolation of these primary cells could explain the subsequent decrease in this activity. In the same study, we also found that the inactivation of the intrinsic p38 MAPK activity increased the number of apoptotic neutrophils. The mechanism underlying Fas-induced inactivation of p38 MAPK has not been identified. However, in a very recent study (9Alvarado-Kristensson M. Melander F. Leandersson K. Ronnstrand L. Wernstedt C. Andersson T. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), we identified caspase 8 and 3 as downstream targets of p38 MAPK in neutrophils, and we found that p38 MAPK-induced phosphorylation of the serine 150 residue of caspase 3 and the serine 364 residue of caspase 8 impaired the activities of these caspases, thereby favoring survival of the neutrophils. These observations suggest that neutrophil apoptosis is initiated by and dependent on the inactivation of p38 MAPK. The molecular mechanisms whereby extracellular factors modify the activity of p38 MAPK in neutrophils undergoing apoptosis are currently unknown. The serine/threonine kinase p38 MAPK is activated by the concomitant phosphorylation of tyrosine and threonine residues within a conserved threonine-glycine-tyrosine motif in its activation loop (10Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar). Accordingly, p38 MAPK can be down-regulated by various protein phosphatases that dephosphorylate either the threonine or the tyrosine residue or both (11Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). One such enzyme is protein phosphatase type 2A (PP2A). PP2A is a phosphoserine/phosphothreonine phosphatase, which has been reported (12Freshney N.W. Rawlinson L. Guesdon F. Jones E. Cowley S. Hsuan J. Saklatvala J. Cell. 1994; 78: 1039-1049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 13Takekawa M. Maeda T. Saito H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4744-4752Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) to dephosphorylate the threonine residue of p38 MAPK and thereby impair its activity. PP2A is also a highly conserved phosphatase that plays essential roles in several signal transduction pathways, translational control, endosome trafficking, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis (14Millward T.A. Zolnierowicz S. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 186-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). The PP2A holoenzyme consists of a 36-kDa catalytic subunit C (Cα or Cβ) and a 65-kDa structural subunit A (Aα or Aβ), that together form the inseparable AC core dimer (PP2AAC). The A subunit appears to function primarily as a scaffolding structure that assembles the different subunits into the holoenzyme complex. PP2A also comprises a third highly diversified regulatory subunit B (B, B′, or B″) that regulates the substrate specificity and subcellular localization of the holoenzyme complex (14Millward T.A. Zolnierowicz S. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 186-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Theoretically, the various combinations of the subunits can give rise to a large number of different PP2A holoenzymes. In the present study, we conducted experiments to determine whether PP2A is involved in the regulation of neutrophil apoptosis and thus also in the termination of inflammatory responses. Cells—Human neutrophils were isolated under endotoxin-free conditions from whole blood drawn from healthy volunteers. The neutrophils were isolated by dextran sedimentation followed by a brief hypotonic lysis of contaminating erythrocytes and centrifugation on Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C, as described originally (15Bo ̈yum A. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Investig. Suppl. 1968; 97: 77-89PubMed Google Scholar). The isolated cells were immediately suspended at 4 °C in a complete RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 0.2 mml-glutamine, and 100 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells/ml. Cell aliquots for the time 0 values were taken immediately after the cells were suspended in this medium. The incubations of the cells were then initiated by placing them in multiwell cell culture plates at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 and 95% air environment. Fas receptors were engaged by incubating the cells with an anti-Fas monoclonal Ab (150 ng/ml) (catalog no. CH-11, Beckman) for the indicated periods of time. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Neutrophils were lysed in a buffer (if not otherwise indicated) containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, Tris 20 mm (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride after which the remaining cell debris was removed by centrifugation (7Alvarado-Kristensson M. Porn-Ares M.I. Grethe S. Smith D. Zheng L. Andersson T. FASEB J. 2001; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The supernatant was precleared with protein G PLUS-agarose (Oncogene Science), after which one of the following was added: agarose-conjugated anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr-180/Tyr-182) IgG1 Ab (New England Biolabs), anti-p38 MAPK IgG Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-caspase 3 polyclonal IgG Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). As a control, one of the following Abs was added: agarose-conjugated anti-c-Myc IgG1 (Clontech), anti-Fyn IgG1, non-immune anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), non-agarose-conjugated anti-PP2A IgG2bκ (clone 1D6) (Upstate Biotechnology) or anti-E-cadherin IgG2. The samples were subsequently incubated overnight under rotation at 4 °C. Non-agarose-conjugated immunocomplexes were allowed to absorb to protein G-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer, and either the precipitates listed above or lysates of intact cells were boiled in a sample buffer (7Alvarado-Kristensson M. Porn-Ares M.I. Grethe S. Smith D. Zheng L. Andersson T. FASEB J. 2001; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), after which the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were analyzed with the following: anti-PP2A IgG2bκ Ab (clone 1D6) or monoclonal Ab 4G10 (mouse anti-phosphotyrosine) (Upstate Biotechnology); anti-caspase 3 IgG Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p38 MAPKα IgG Ab, or anti-hemagglutinin IgG2a Ab (catalog no. F-7, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr-180/Tyr-182) IgG1 Ab, anti-phospho-ATF2 (Thr-71) IgG Ab (New England Biolabs), or anti-phosphoserine IgMκ Ab (catalog no. 16B4, Biomol). As indicated in the figure legends, certain blots were stripped and reprobed according to the instructions of the manufacturers. PP2A Phosphatase Assay—The PP2A phosphatase assay was performed as stipulated by the manufacturer (serine/threonine assay kit 1, Upstate Biotechnology). Briefly, neutrophils were preincubated on ice for 15 min in the absence or presence of 3 μm PP1 (Biomol) or for 45 min with or without 20 μm DEVD-fluoromethyl ketone (ICN Biomedical, Inc.). Thereafter, the cells were exposed to anti-Fas Ab at 37 °C for different periods of time and were then lysed as indicated above in a lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, Tris 50 mm (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm NaF, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm Na3VO4). Subunit C (catalytic) of PP2A was immunoprecipitated as described above. The precipitates were washed by centrifugation twice in the lysis buffer and twice in a serine/threonine kinase buffer (100 μm CaCl2 and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0)). The pellet was resuspended in the kinase buffer, and PP2A activity was measured after the addition of 250 μm phosphopeptide. The phosphatase reactions were carried out for 15 min at 30 °C. The release of phosphate from the added phosphopeptide was quantified using a malachite green reagent. In short, a sample (25 μl) of the reaction medium was transferred to a microtiter assay plate, and 100 μl of malachite green reagent was added to each well, after which the plates were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. Changes in absorbance were measured at 650 nm in a Fluostar plate reader (BMG Lab Technologies). The phosphatase activity in each well was determined as a percentage of the maximal activity recorded in each experiment. Alternatively, PP2A (10 units/ml) purified from human erythrocytes (Upstate Biotechnology) was added to agarose-conjugated active (phosphorylated) p38 MAPK immunoprecipitates in the presence or absence of 10 nm calyculin A (Cal A). The phosphatase reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 30 min, and the activity remaining in the p38 MAPK immunoprecipitates was measured by running a p38 MAPK phosphorylation assay in the presence of ATF2-(19–96), as described previously (7Alvarado-Kristensson M. Porn-Ares M.I. Grethe S. Smith D. Zheng L. Andersson T. FASEB J. 2001; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of Human Caspase 3—The pET21b vector containing C-terminally His6-tagged human pro-caspase 3 (16Srinivasula S.M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Zangrilli J. Robertson N. Armstrong R.C. Wang L.

Alnemri. Recombinant human caspase 3 was purified as described previously (9Alvarado-Kristensson M. Melander F. Leandersson K. Ronnstrand L. Wernstedt C. Andersson T. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In Vitro Assays for p38 MAPK Phosphorylation and PP2A Dephosphorylation—The p38 MAPK phosphorylation assay was performed as reported previously (7Alvarado-Kristensson M. Porn-Ares M.I. Grethe S. Smith D. Zheng L. Andersson T. FASEB J. 2001; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 9Alvarado-Kristensson M. Melander F. Leandersson K. Ronnstrand L. Wernstedt C. Andersson T. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) in the presence of recombinant caspase 3 or active ATF2-(19–96). The assays were run for 60 min at 30 °C. Thereafter, radiolabeled phosphorylated caspase 3 was either incubated in the presence of 10 units/ml PP2A (Upstate Biotechnology) or was immunoprecipitated in active PP2A from neutrophils stimulated with anti-Fas Ab for 30 min, and a PP2A phosphatase assay was run as described above. The degree of phosphorylation of recombinant caspase 3 was analyzed by autoradiography, whereas the phosphorylation of ATF2-(19–96) was assessed by Western blotting (7Alvarado-Kristensson M. Porn-Ares M.I. Grethe S. Smith D. Zheng L. Andersson T. FASEB J. 2001; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). 32P Phosphorylation of Caspase 3 in Vivo—Neutrophils (5 × 107/ml) were preincubated for 1 h and 50 min at 37 °C in a calcium- and phosphate-free medium (136 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 5.0 mm NaHCO3, 5.5 mm glucose, 0.1% human bovine serum albumin, and 2 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)) supplemented with [32P]orthophosphate (2 mCi/ml). Thereafter, the cells were washed and resuspended in RPMI medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, and some cells were also exposed to 40 nm Cal A for 10 min at 37 °C. Next, the cells were stimulated with the anti-Fas monoclonal Ab at 37 °C for 30 min in the absence or presence of 40 nm Cal A. Caspases were subsequently immunoprecipitated as described above using agarose-conjugated anti-caspase 3 polyclonal Ab. The degree of phosphorylation was analyzed by autoradiography performed on a PhosphorImager, and the membranes were subsequently immunoblotted for caspase 3. Fluorometric Assays for Caspase Activities—Neutrophils were first incubated in the absence or presence of 40 nm Cal A for 20 min on ice prior to exposure to anti-Fas Ab (150 ng/ml). The cells were incubated with the anti-Fas Ab for 75 min at 37 °C and then harvested and lysed as described previously (7Alvarado-Kristensson M. Porn-Ares M.I. Grethe S. Smith D. Zheng L. Andersson T. FASEB J. 2001; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). DEVD-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Upstate Biotechnology), which is a fluorogenic substrate for caspase 3, was added to each cell lysate, and the activity of caspase 3 (cleavage of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin) was measured as described previously (7Alvarado-Kristensson M. Porn-Ares M.I. Grethe S. Smith D. Zheng L. Andersson T. FASEB J. 2001; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of Nuclear Morphology—Neutrophils were incubated for 15 min at 4 °C in the absence or presence of 40 nm Cal A. Thereafter, the cells were washed with RPMI 1640 medium at 4 °C prior to the engagement of their Fas receptor. The cells were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in the presence of anti-Fas Ab. Subsequently, 25 μl of each cell suspension was transferred to an Eppendorf tube, and 1 μl of a mixture of acridine orange and ethidium bromide (100 μg/ml each) was added to the cell suspension. The stained cells were examined immediately in a Nikon Eclipse E800 fluorescence microscope equipped with a 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole/fluorescein isothiocyanate filter. A minimum of 100 nuclei was counted in each sample, and the percentage of nuclei displaying condensed chromatin was calculated. Statistical Evaluations—All data are expressed as means ± S.D. (n < 6) or S.E. (n ≥ 6), and Student's paired t test was used for statistical analysis of the differences. Activity and Regulation of the Serine/Threonine PP2A in Neutrophils Undergoing Apoptosis—To address the possibility that a protein phosphatase regulates the previously demonstrated transient loss of p38 MAPK activity during Fas-induced apoptosis in human neutrophils (7Alvarado-Kristensson M. Porn-Ares M.I. Grethe S. Smith D. Zheng L. Andersson T. FASEB J. 2001; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), we measured the phosphatase activity in immunoprecipitates of PP2A (the catalytic subunit). Spectrophotometric analysis revealed a rapid increase in PP2A activity that reached a peak after 30–45 min and declined to the starting level after 1 h at 37 °C in the absence or the presence of the anti-Fas Ab (Fig. 1A). Notably, PP2A regained its activity after 2 h of Fas-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1A). This pattern of action correlated well with the increased activity of caspase 3 we recorded previously under the same conditions (9Alvarado-Kristensson M. Melander F. Leandersson K. Ronnstrand L. Wernstedt C. Andersson T. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Santoro et al. (17Santoro M.F. Annand R.R. Robertson M.M. Peng Y.W. Brady M.J. Mankovich J.A. Hackett M.C. Ghayur T. Walter G. Wong W.W. Giegel D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13119-13128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) have reported that caspase 3 can cleave and thereby activate PP2A during the execution phase of apoptosis. To determine whether the second increase in PP2A activity that we observed might have been caspase 3-dependent, we used DEVD-fluoromethyl ketone to inhibit the activity of this caspase. Such treatment decreased the activity in PP2A immunoprecipitates of Fas-treated cells after 2 h of incubation (Fig. 1B). These findings suggested that the second increase in PP2A activity we noticed (Fig. 1A) was caused by the Fas-induced increase in caspase activity in neutrophils. Therefore, we focused further experiments on elucidating the molecular mechanisms that regulated the transient activity of PP2A seen in Fas-treated cells during the first hour of incubation. The activity of PP2A can be modulated by different mechanisms, some of which involve the various regulatory subunits of this protein. In addition, the core subunit can undergo a number of biochemical modifications that deactivate PP2A; for example, some tyrosine kinases belonging to the Src kinase family can phosphorylate PP2A on tyrosine 307 (18Lechward K. Awotunde O.S. Swiatek W. Muszynska G. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2001; 48: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We found that in neutrophils the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the core subunit of PP2A was only modestly affected during spontaneous apoptosis (Fig. 1, C and E), whereas it was increased temporarily during the first 45 min of Fas-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1, D and E). A comparison of PP2A tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1E) with PP2A activity (Fig. 1A) during Fas-induced apoptosis revealed a parallel increase during the first 30 min, after which the phosphatase activity started to decrease before there was a drop in the phosphorylation. Incubating the cells with the Src kinase inhibitor PP1 augmented the activity of PP2A 45 min after the initiation of anti-Fas-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1F). This finding indicated that a Src kinase participated in the decrease in PP2A activity seen after 30 min during anti-Fas-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, these data argue against the involvement of a Src kinase in the initiation of PP2A activity during either spontaneous or Fas-induced apoptosis in neutrophils. PP2A Can Directly Regulate the Activity of p38 MAPK—Our data showing corresponding activities of p38 MAPK (7Alvarado-Kristensson M. Porn-Ares M.I. Grethe S. Smith D. Zheng L. Andersson T. FASEB J. 2001; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) and PP2A suggested the existence of direct interactions between these signaling proteins, and that assumption was supported by the time-dependent recovery of PP2A from immunoprecipitates of total p38α MAPK (the most abundant p38 MAPK isoform in neutrophils (19Hale K.K. Trollinger D. Rihanek M. Manthey C.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4246-4252PubMed Google Scholar)) and active p38 MAPK from anti-Fas-treated cells (Fig. 2A). We observed that PP2A was not associated initially with p38 MAPK in freshly isolated neutrophils; instead, the association was first detected 30 min after the engagement of Fas receptors (Fig. 2A). To determine whether PP2A was involved in the Fas-induced dephosphorylation and inactivation of p38 MAPK, we used a precoupled antibody to immunoprecipitate total p38α MAPK from freshly isolated neutrophils (because such cells exhibit a high level of p38 MAPK activity). These immunocomplexes were incubated in the absence or presence of active PP2A (10 units/ml) purified from human erythrocytes (Fig. 2B) for 30 min at 30 °C and were then washed extensively to remove residual PP2A. The p38 MAPK activity that remained in these immunocomplexes was measured by performing an in vitro kinase assay for 1 h at 30 °C in the absence or presence of 10 nm Cal A with added ATF2. We detected a significant decrease in p38 MAPK-induced phosphorylation of ATF2 when immunoprecipitated p38 MAPK was incubated in the presence of PP2A (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the PP2A-mediated decrease in p38 MAPK-induced phosphorylation of ATF2 was inhibited in the presence of Cal A (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrate that PP2A can directly dephosphorylate and inactivate p38 MAPK obtained from freshly isolated human neutrophils, which strongly suggests that PP2A is responsible for mediating the transient reduction of p38 MAPK activity seen in intact neutrophils. PP2A Causes the Transient Dephosphorylation of p38 MAPK during Apoptosis in Neutrophils—Notably, the peak in PP2A activity (Fig. 1A) and the transient decline in p38 activity (Fig. 3A) (7Alvarado-Kristensson M. Porn-Ares M.I. Grethe S. Smith D. Zheng L. Andersson T. FASEB J. 2001; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) occurred simultaneously, and it was at the same point in time during an incubation that the activity of caspase 3 started to increase and could be detected (9Alvarado-Kristensson M. Melander F. Leandersson K. Ronnstrand L. Wernstedt C. Andersson T. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Considering the findings mentioned above, it is interesting that Cal A, which is an inhibitor of type 1 and 2A protein phosphatases (20Sheppeck II, J.E. Gauss C.M. Chamberlin A.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 1739-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), augmented the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK during the first hour of incubation and that the effect abolished the temporary decline in p38 MAPK activity (Fig. 3B). These observations support the idea that the initial, transitory inhibition of p38 MAPK during neutrophil apoptosis is caused by the transient increase in PP2A activity. PP2A Dephosphorylates Caspase 3 at Serine 150—We had observed previously that p38 MAPK plays a role in the survival of human neutrophils by virtue of its ability to phosphorylate (at Ser-150) and thereby inactivates caspase 3 (9Alvarado-Kristensson M. Melander F. Leandersson K. Ronnstrand L. Wernstedt C. Andersson T. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). That finding, along with the present results showing that PP2A participates in the regulation of p38 MAPK activity in neutrophils, prompted us to determine whether PP2A also affects the activity of caspase 3 in neutrophils undergoing apoptosis. Caspase 3 has been found to cleave PP2A in Jurkat cells (17Santoro M.F. Annand R.R. Robertson M.M. Peng Y.W. Brady M.J. Mankovich J.A. Hackett M.C. Ghayur T. Walter G. Wong W.W. Giegel D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13119-13128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), which suggests that these two enzymes could also interact with each other in human neutrophils. Indeed, immunoprecipitation of caspase 3 and PP2A indicated a similar time-dependent interaction between these proteins in neutrophils (Fig. 4A), which suggests that PP2A can directly dephosphorylate caspase 3 and thereby regain its impaired activity. To test that assumption, we performed an assay in vitro to determine whether p38 MAPK-phosphorylated caspase 3 can serve as a substrate for PP2A. Active p38 MAPK that had been immunoprecipitated from newly isolated neutrophils was incubated with recombinant human caspase 3 in the presence of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (9Alvarado-Kristensson M. Melander F. Leandersson K. Ronnstrand L. Wernstedt C. Andersson T. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). After p38 MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of caspase 3 had occurred, the agarose-conjugated active p38 MAPK immunoprecipitates were removed. The phosphorylated caspase 3 was incubated with 10 units/ml PP2A for 30 min at 30 °C and was purified of human erythrocytes and PP2A immunoprecipitates from neutrophils that had been exposed to anti-Fas Ab for 30 min in the presence or absence of 10 nm Cal A (Fig. 4B). Thereafter, we analyzed the level of caspase 3 phosphorylation by autoradiography and found that both purified and immunoprecipitated PP2A caused dephosphorylation of caspase 3 and that this dephosphorylation could be inhibited by Cal A (Fig. 4B). Together, these results indicate that PP2A can mediate Fas-induced dephosphorylation of caspase 3. PP2A Participates in Regulation of Neutrophil Apoptosis— The interaction among p38 MAPK, caspase 3, and PP2A in intact neutrophils and our finding that PP2A can directly dephosphorylate p38 MAPK and caspase 3 in vitro suggest that PP2A plays an important role in the regulation of neutrophil apoptosis by directly inducing biochemical changes in both p38 MAPK and caspase 3, resulting in the reduced activity of p38 MAPK but the increased activity of caspase 3. To ascertain the validity of that assumption, we used two different experimental approaches to detect PP2A-dependent dephosphorylation of caspase 3 in intact neutrophils. First, we employed a general anti-phosphoserine antibody to investigate the effect of the PP2A inhibitor Cal A (40 nm) on the level of phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated caspase 3. We chose that method because it enables analysis of the phosphorylation immediately after isolation of the cells. The results show that the inhibition of PP2A in Fas-engaged neutrophils led to increased phosphorylation of caspase 3 (Fig. 5A). Second, we labeled freshly isolated human neutrophils with 32P for 1 h and 50 min and then incubated them for 10 min with or without 40 nm Cal A. We then engaged the Fas receptors of these cells in the absence or presence of Cal A. The time points indicated in Fig. 5B cannot be compared with those in the other figures because the cells in this experiment had been preincubated for a significant period of time at 37 °C before they were exposed to the anti-Fas Ab. Compared with Fas-treated cells, 32P-labeled cells incubated with anti-Fas Ab and Cal A displayed augmented phosphorylation of both the 32-kDa proform and the 20-kDa active form of caspase 3. To ascertain whether PP2A actually is involved in neutrophil apoptosis, we pretreated those leukocytes with Cal A and then analyzed the effect that this phosphatase inhibitor had on Fas-induced activation of caspase 3. The results revealed that the inhibition of PP2A significantly impeded the Fas-provoked activity of caspase 3 (Fig. 5C). In addition, we also analyzed the effect of Cal A on apoptosis by staining the nuclei of anti-Fas-treated neutrophils with acridine orange (Fig. 5D). These experiments show conclusively that the inhibition of PP2A decreased the number of anti-Fas Ab-treated cells with an apoptotic morphology. Together, these findings show that the inhibition of PP2A in Fas-engaged neutrophils led to an increased phosphorylation of caspase 3, which inhibited the activity of this caspase and thereby delayed the apoptotic process. We have shown previously that the ability of p38 MAPK to phosphorylate caspases constitutes a survival signal in isolated human granulocytes (7Alvarado-Kristensson M. Porn-Ares M.I. Grethe S. Smith D. Zheng L. Andersson T. FASEB J. 2001; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 9Alvarado-Kristensson M. Melander F. Leandersson K. Ronnstrand L. Wernstedt C. Andersson T. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Specifically, such biochemical modifications impair the activities of caspases and thereby weaken the capacity of these proteins to induce apoptosis (9Alvarado-Kristensson M. Melander F. Leandersson K. Ronnstrand L. Wernstedt C. Andersson T. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Therefore, inactivation of the constitutively active p38 MAPK facilitates stimulation of the caspase cascade during spontaneous and Fas-induced neutrophil apoptosis (7Alvarado-Kristensson M. Porn-Ares M.I. Grethe S. Smith D. Zheng L. Andersson T. FASEB J. 2001; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of the temporary deactivation of p38 MAPK has not yet been examined in human neutrophils. In the present study, we noted that a transient increase in PP2A activity occurred at the same time as the decrease in p38 MAPK activity, which suggests that PP2A could be involved in regulating the phosphorylation and thus also the activity of p38 MAPK. The finding that both the increase in PP2A activity and the decrease in p38 MAPK activity take place at a point in time when caspase 3 starts to display increased activity (7Alvarado-Kristensson M. Porn-Ares M.I. Grethe S. Smith D. Zheng L. Andersson T. FASEB J. 2001; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 9Alvarado-Kristensson M. Melander F. Leandersson K. Ronnstrand L. Wernstedt C. Andersson T. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) implies that p38 MAPK as well as PP2A is involved in the control of neutrophil apoptosis. The existence of a possible regulatory relationship between p38 MAPK and PP2A is supported by results reported by Keyse (11Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), showing that various protein phosphatases can down-regulate the activity of p38 MAPK by dephosphorylating either a specific threonine or a specific tyrosine residue or both. The author documented that the serine/threonine phosphatases PP2A and PP2Cα can deactivate p38 MAPK by phospho-threonine dephosphorylation (11Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). The present finding of a Fas-dependent association between PP2A and p38 MAPK provides the basis for a signaling interaction between these two enzymes and hence implies that PP2A is involved in regulating the induction of apoptosis in neutrophils. To ascertain whether PP2A does play a role in neutrophil apoptosis, we pretreated such leukocytes with the phosphatase inhibitor Cal A, which is known to efficiently block the effects of PP1 and PP2A but not PP2Cα (20Sheppeck II, J.E. Gauss C.M. Chamberlin A.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 1739-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Only PP2A and PP2Cα can dephosphorylate p38 MAPK, and therefore it seems reasonable to assume that any influence of Cal A on Fas-induced neutrophil apoptosis is mediated by its effect on PP2A. We found that the inhibition of PP2A by Cal A abolished the Fas-induced transient decrease in p38 MAPK activity and that it also increased the phosphorylation of caspase 3 and thereby reduced the activity of this apoptotic protease and the morphological alterations characteristic of apoptotic cells. Our data reveal an association between p38 MAPK and caspase 3 and show that PP2A interacts with both of those proteins. Consequently, it could be hypothesized that PP2A may directly dephosphorylate not only p38 MAPK but also caspase 3. In accordance with that idea, the results of our experiments performed in vitro revealed such a direct effect of PP2A on caspase 3 and on p38 MAPK, and therefore we propose that, in addition to its influence on p38 MAPK, PP2A has a direct impact on the phosphorylation statues and activity of caspase 3. These findings suggest that PP2A promotes neutrophil apoptosis through dual actions, more precisely, by dephosphorylating p38 MAPK and thus inhibiting subsequent phosphorylation of caspase 3 and by dephosphorylating caspase 3 that has already been phosphorylated and thereby restoring its activity. The signaling events that occur during the first hour of Fas-induced apoptosis in neutrophils are relatively straightforward to interpret, whereas the subsequent alterations in intracellular signaling are more difficult to understand because of the increased activity of caspases in apoptotic cells. The stimulated caspases are known to degrade and thereby abolish the activities of a number of signaling molecules (21Degterev A. Boyce M. Yuan J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8543-8567Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar), or, as in the case of PP2A, they increase its activity (17Santoro M.F. Annand R.R. Robertson M.M. Peng Y.W. Brady M.J. Mankovich J.A. Hackett M.C. Ghayur T. Walter G. Wong W.W. Giegel D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13119-13128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We found that the inhibition of caspase 3 in neutrophils exposed to anti-Fas Ab for 90 min led to reduced activity of PP2A. Accordingly, it is logical to conclude that the secondary increase in PP2A activity observed in neutrophils with engaged Fas receptors is mediated indirectly by the Fas-induced increase in caspase activities. Based on this knowledge, we focused our present efforts on understanding how PP2A participates in the initial induction phase of apoptosis in neutrophils. PP2A has been implicated primarily as a proapoptotic signal in several human and murine cell lines (22Chiang C.W. Kanies C. Kim K.W. Fang W.B. Parkhurst C. Xie M. Henry T. Yang E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6350-6362Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 23Deng X. Ito T. Carr B. Mumby M. May Jr., W.S. J. Biol.

Damuni Z. Eriksson J.E. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7677-7686Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and such an effect is mediated probably by the ability of this protein to dephosphorylate Bcl-2 and Bad (22Chiang C.W. Kanies C. Kim K.W. Fang W.B. Parkhurst C. Xie M. Henry T. Yang E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6350-6362Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 23Deng X. Ito T. Carr B. Mumby M. May Jr., W.S. J.

However, PP2A can also indirectly exert a proapoptotic effect on cells by down-regulating signal transduction molecules such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (24Ha ̈rma ̈la ̈-Braske ́n A.S.

In tumor necrosis factor-α-stimulated human neutrophils, Avdi et al. (25Avdi N.J. Malcolm K.C. Nick J.A. Worthen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40687-40696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) have demonstrated a functional cross-talk between p38 MAPK and JNK, whereby p38 MAPK acts to limit the activation of a proapoptotic signal from JNK. These authors suggest that this cross-talk is mediated via the p38 MAPK-mediated activation of PP2A and the subsequent inhibition of MAPK kinase 4 and JNK (25Avdi N.J. Malcolm K.C. Nick J.A.

In contrast, results from the present study suggest that the proapoptotic impact of PP2A in primary human neutrophils occurs through direct regulation of another member of the MAPK family, namely p38 MAPK, and also caspase 3, which is a downstream substrate of p38 MAPK. These effects are possible because of the interactions of PP2A with p38 MAPK and caspase 3, which enable a transient PP2A-mediated deactivation of p38 MAPK and the dephosphorylation and reconstitution of previously impaired caspase 3 activity. These molecular modifications, in turn, increase the activity of caspase 3 and thus initiate apoptosis in human neutrophils. Taken together, these data could of course be readily explained by the ability of Fas- and tumor necrosis factor-α receptors to activate distinctly different downstream signaling events that result in an increased neutrophil survival. However, the data convincingly reveal the capacity of both PP2A and p38 MAPK to regulate each other and show that such signaling interactions are important in regulating neutrophil survival.

https://openalex.org/W1993847375,"Defects in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor pathway are sufficient for neoplastic transformation as the initiating step in colorectal carcinogenesis. In contrast, hyperplastic tumors possess normal APC function, and it is unclear whether they represent significant precursor lesion in cancer development. CEACAM1 is a tumor suppressor whose expression is known to be lost in the great majority of early adenomas and carcinomas. We found that loss of CEACAM1 expression is more common in neoplastic tumors than APC mutations. While APC function was normal in hyperplastic aberrant cypt foci and hyperplastic polyps, loss of CEACAM1 was observed as frequently as in the neoplasias. Moreover, the presence or absence of CEACAM1 expression in the hyperplastic tumors correlates with normal or reduced apoptosis, respectively. In vitro, CEACAM1 acts as a regulator of apoptosis in CEACAM1-transfected Jurkat cells. Finally, in human HT29 colon cancer cells, apoptosis can be specifically restored by induction of CEACAM1 expression. These data suggest an oncodevelopmental link between neoplasia and hyperplasia and demonstrate that CEACAM1 acts as a regulator of apoptosis in the colonic epithelium. Thus, failure of the maturing colon cell to express CEACAM1 is likely to contribute to the development of hyperplastic lesions, which may eventually pave the way to neoplastic transformation and colon cancer development."

Dose-dependent saturable high affinity binding was demonstrated between N-terminal fragments, between furin processed C-terminal fragments, and between these N- and C-terminal fragments.

Lateral fibrillin-1 assembly is another critical, but unexplained, feature of microfibril assembly. Electron microscopy of isolated microfibrils, and mass mapping, suggest that there are eight molecules in cross-section (20Baldock C. Koster A.J. Ziese U. Rock M.J. Sherratt M.J. Kadler K.E.

It is unclear whether any of these interactions are mutually exclusive. We have undertaken a detailed analysis of fibrillin-1 homotypic interactions, using recombinant fragments that span the entire coding region of human fibrillin-1, to define fibrillin-1 sequences that interact. The N terminus binds very strongly to itself and to an overlapping downstream sequence. The furin-processed C terminus and the proteolytically released C-terminal 20-kDa fragment both bind homotypically and tightly to the N terminus. No other homotypic fibrillin-1 interactions were detected. MAGP-1 inhibits the N- to C-terminal interaction but not the N- to N-terminal interaction. These interactions may regulate linear head-to-tail and lateral fibrillin-1 assembly.

Recombinant Expression of Post-furin Cleavage Site Fibrillin-1 Fragment—Fibrillin-1 fragment CP encoded by exon 65 (the final 420 bp) was expressed using the pGEX4T-3 expression vector in Escherichia coli. Cells were treated with 1% Triton X-100, then sonicated, and lysates were collected after centrifugation (7,800 × g, 10 min) in the presence of 2 mm sodium azide and a mixture of protease inhibitors (protease inhibitor mixture, Sigma). The recombinant protein was purified as a fusion protein on a glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was first washed with phosphate-buffered saline, then the protein was eluted in 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, containing 30 mm glutathione, in 1-ml fractions. Eluted fractions were then dialyzed into 0.1 m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, containing 0.001 m CaCl2, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE in reducing conditions (Fig. 1C), Western blot, and size exclusion chromatography using Superdex 200. Pure GST expressed in this E. coli system was a gift from Prof. M. J. Humphries (University of Manchester, Manchester, UK). Solid-phase Binding Assays—Solid-phase binding assays utilized recombinant human fibrillin-1 fragments PF1, PF2, PF3, PF4, PF5, PF7, PF8, PF9, PF10, PF11, PF12, PF13, CP, and the GST control. The soluble ligands were biotinylated and the binding assays were conducted at 37 °C. The block for these biotinylated ligands was bovine serum albumin (BSA). For biotinylation of soluble ligands, each fibrillin-1 fragment or full-length human MAGP-1 was rotated at room temperature for 30 min with an approximate 10-fold molar excess of 10 mg/ml solution of Immunopure sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester-biotin (Pierce) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline. Each mixture was then dialyzed against several changes of 0.02 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, containing 0.1 m NaCl and 0.001 m CaCl2 (TBS/CaCl2) to remove excess biotin. Flat-bottomed microtiter plates (ThermoLabsystems, Franklin, WI) were coated with N- or C-terminal fibrillin-1, each at 0.12 μm (100 μl) in TBS/CaCl2, overnight at 37 °C. The plates were then incubated with TBS/CaCl2 containing 10 mg/ml heat denatured filtered BSA for at least 3 h at room temperature to block nonspecific binding sites and then washed with TBS/CaCl2 containing 1 mg/ml heat-denatured filtered BSA (wash buffer) (3 × 200 μl). Initially, 5 μg/ml soluble fibrillin-1 protein fragments that together span the full-length molecule were screened for binding to each other or to MAGP-1 by incubating in TBS/CaCl2 for 3 h, or overnight at 37 °C. Subsequently, detailed binding assays of the interacting fibrillin-1 fragments were conducted, with addition of soluble biotinylated ligand at concentrations from 0 to 0.15 μm in TBS/CaCl2 for 3 h or overnight at 37 °C. Plates were washed (3 × 200 μl) before detection of bound fibrillin-1. Biotinylated ligands were quantified by incubating with 1:200 dilution of ExtraAvidin peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) in TBS/CaCl2 at room temperature for 10-15 min, and read at a wavelength of 405 nm. For both methods, wells were washed four times and the color developed using 40 mm 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) solution (Sigma) for ∼10-20 min at room temperature. Plates were read at a wavelength of 405 nm. All assays were performed in triplicate and repeated at least twice to confirm results. Calcium Dependence Binding Assays—Binding assays were performed as above, except that dilution buffers and washes were with or without calcium (0.001 m CaCl2). The wash buffer contained 1 mg/ml filtered, heat-denatured BSA in Tris-buffered saline (TBS). Solid-phase protein fragments at 0.12 μm were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in the presence or absence of 10 mm EDTA, before adherence to the plate and overnight incubation at 37 °C. The wells were blocked with 10 mg/ml filtered, heat-denatured BSA for 3 h, and washed with wash buffer with or without calcium, depending on whether or not the solid phase had been pretreated with EDTA. Each soluble protein ligand was biotinylated and dialyzed, as described above. Each protein ligand was incubated at 4 °C in the presence or absence of 10 mm EDTA for 1 h, re-equilibrated in TBS with or without calcium, then added to the wells at (0.02 μm) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Plates were washed three times with wash buffer with or without calcium, before detection of bound fibrillin-1. Biotinylated ligand was quantified by incubating with 1:200 dilution of ExtraAvidin peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) in TBS with or without CaCl2, for 10-20 min at room temperature. Wells were washed four times with wash buffer with or without calcium, and the color was developed following addition of 40 mm ABTS solution for 10-20 min at room temperature. Plates were read at a wavelength of 405 nm. All experiments were done in triplicate wells, and repeated at least twice to confirm results. Fibrillin-1 Inhibition Binding Assays—Inhibition binding assays were also conducted using both non-biotinylated and biotinylated soluble protein ligands. Flat bottomed microtiter plates were coated with N-terminal (PF4) or C-terminal (PF13) fragments at 0.12 μm in TBS/CaCl2 overnight at 37 °C. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with TBS/CaCl2 containing 10 mg/ml BSA, at room temperature for at least 3 h. The plates were washed with wash buffer (3 × 200 μl) and incubated with 0.02 μm (or as specified) non-biotinylated fibrillin-1 fragments in TBS/CaCl2 overnight at 37 °C. The plates were washed again three times, then 0.02 μm (or as specified) of the second biotinylated protein in TBS/CaCl2 was added, overnight at 37 °C. Control wells were incubated overnight in TBS/CaCl2 with the first non-biotinylated soluble ligand omitted, prior to addition of the biotinylated second soluble ligand. After a further three washes, plates were incubated with 1:200 dilution of ExtraAvidin peroxidase conjugate at room temperature for 15 min. Bound protein was quantified after four more washes by the colorimetric assay described above, using ABTS solution for 10-20 min at room temperature. Plates were read at a wavelength of 405 nm. All experiments were done in triplicate wells, and repeated at least twice to confirm results. MAGP-1 Inhibition Binding Assays—Assays were performed as described above for competition assays involving only fibrillin-1 protein fragments. Flat bottomed microtiter plates were coated with N-terminal fibrillin-1 (0.12 μm) in TBS/CaCl2 overnight at 37 °C. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked as described. The plates were washed with wash buffer (3 × 200 μl) and incubated with increasing concentrations of non-biotinylated MAGP-1 in TBS/CaCl2 overnight at 37 °C. The plates were then washed with wash buffer (3 × 200 μl) and incubated with 0.03 μm biotinylated N- (PF4) or C- (PF13, CP) terminal fibrillin-1 protein fragments in TBS/CaCl2 overnight at 37 °C. The reaction was completed as described above. N-Ethylmaleimide Treatment—Solid-phase assays were performed, as described above, to investigate N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) capping of a free cysteine within the PF4 hybrid domain (27Reinhardt D.P. Gambee J.E. Ono R.N. Bächinger H.P. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2205-2210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). PF4, at a concentration of 0.12 μm was preincubated at 4 °C with or without 2 mm NEM (molar excess) for 1 h. NEM-treated PF4 was allowed to adsorb to flat-bottomed microtiter plates, prior to solid-phase binding assays with soluble untreated PF4, as outlined above. Dissociation Constants for Fibrillin-1 Interactions—We previously used surface plasmon resonance with a BIAcore biosensor (BIAcore 3000, BIAcore AB, Sweden) to define the dissociation constants for fibrillin-1 interactions with MAGP-1 and tropoelastin (29Rock M.J. Cain S.A. Freeman L.J. Morgan A. Mellody K. Marson A. Shuttleworth C.A. Weiss A.S. Kielty C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23748-23758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In those experiments, MAGP-1 or tropoelastin was attached to CM5 chips, with fibrillin-1 fragments as soluble analytes. Here it was possible to bind the C-terminal fragment CP to CM5 BIAcore chips for analysis of this interaction with PF4. However, fibrillin-1 PF1, PF3, PF4, and PF13 fragments were found not to attach stably to either CM5 or streptavidin-coated chips, in contrast to a previous report of N- and C-terminal fibrillin-1 halves (26Lin G.K.

Therefore, we derived kinetic data on fibrillin-1-fibrillin-1 interactions using solid-phase assays, percentage saturation was analyzed using GraphPad Prism software and Scatchard plots. We investigated fibrillin-1 homotypic interactions to gain new insights into how microfibrils assemble. To date, there has not been a comprehensive analysis of fibrillin-1 interactions, although it was reported that the N-terminal half of fibrillin-1 (encoded by exons 1-36) interacted with the C-terminal half of the molecule (encoded by exons 36-65) (26Lin G.K.

We have used shorter overlapping human fibrillin-1 fragments encompassing the entire sequence (Fig. 1A), and full-length human MAGP-1 in solid-phase binding and inhibition assays, and BIAcore analyses. The interactions show dose dependence and saturation kinetics. Fibrillin-1 N-terminal Interactions—Homotypic N-terminal fibrillin-1 interactions were studied using solid-phase binding assays. Immobilized PF4 (encoded by exons 1-8) interacted strongly with soluble PF4 (Figs. 2A and 3A), so a homotypic interaction site must be present within this N-terminal fragment. PF4 also interacted strongly with downstream fragment PF2 (encoded by exons 9-17) (Fig. 2A), but PF2 bound only weakly to itself (not shown). The longer N-terminal fragment PF1 also bound PF2 (not shown). Thus, N-terminal sequences can interact with PF2. This interaction could stabilize predicted folding at the proline-rich region.Fig. 2Solid-phase binding assays of soluble fibrillin-1 fragments to immobilized fibrillin-1 fragments. Fibrillin-1 fragments were coated to the plastic surfaces of multiwell plates, and then incubated with soluble biotinylated fibrillin fragments at increasing concentrations.

https://openalex.org/W2069280199,"Endothelial cell migration is promoted by chemoattractants and is accompanied with microtubule extension toward the leading edge. Cytoskeletal microtubules polarize to function as rails for delivering a variety of molecules by motor proteins during cell migration. It remains, however, unclear how directional migration with polarized extension of microtubules is regulated. Here we report that Rap1 controls the migration of vascular endothelial cells. We found that Rap1-associating molecule, RAPL, which belongs to the Ras association domain family (Rassf), localized on microtubules and that activated Rap1 induced dissociation of RAPL from microtubules. A Rap1 activation-monitoring probe based on the fluorescence resonance energy transfer enabled us to demonstrate that local Rap1 activation occurs at the leading edge of the cells under the two types of cell migration, chemotaxis and wound healing. Time lapse imaging of microtubules marked by enhanced green fluorescent protein-RAPL showed the directional growth of microtubules toward the leading edge of the migrating cells. Using adenovirus, inactivation of Rap1 by expression of rap1GAPII inhibited wound healing. In addition, disconnection of Rap1 and RAPL by expression of a RAPL mutant also perturbed wound healing. Collectively, the locally activated Rap1 and its association with RAPL controls the directional migration of vascular endothelial cells."

BRCA1 comprises a RING domain at the N terminus and a BRCT domain at the C terminus, through which it associates with DNA repair proteins. The key sequences that target BRCA1 to DNA damage-induced foci have not been identified. Here, we mapped the BRCA1 foci-targeting domains of yellow fluorescence protein (YFP)-tagged BRCA1 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells exposed to ionizing radiation (IR). Cancer mutations specific to the BRCT domain, but not the RING domain, abolished BRCA1 recruitment to IR-induced foci. The YFP-BRCT domain itself, however, localized poorly at IR-induced foci, and the RING domain and other sequences were negative. We discovered that only when the RING and BRCT domains were combined was foci targeting restored to levels observed for wild-type BRCA1. The RING-BRCT fusion co-localized at foci with the MDC1 DNA damage response factor and inhibited entry of endogenous BRCA1 into nuclear foci. Our results explain why exon 11-deficient BRCA1 splice variants are targeted to IR-induced foci even though they are incapable of repairing DNA damage.

Germ line mutations in BRCA1 (or in BRCA2) are found in ∼50% of patients with inherited breast cancer and up to 90% of families with breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility (2Miki Y. Swensen J.

BRCA1 contains two important protein interaction domains. The first is a zinc-binding RING motif at the N terminus, which forms an enzymatically active ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) when BRCA1 heterodimerizes with BARD1 through its N terminus (7Baer R.

Therefore, the RING and the BRCT domains contribute to multiple BRCA1 nuclear functions.BRCA1 is implicated in different DNA repair pathways, including homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining, which facilitate repair of double-stranded DNA breakages (6Scully R.

Various in vitro biochemical assays and genetic studies revealed a direct influence of BRCA1 on DNA repair and showed that mutations in BRCA1, including those in the RING domain (e.g. C61G) and in the C-terminal BRCT domain, impair BRCA1 DNA repair function (1Khanna K.K.

Cellular BRCA1 is detected primarily in the nucleus and found to cluster in discrete nuclear “foci” during DNA replication at S-phase (23Scully R. Chen J. Plug A. Xiao Y. Weaver D. Feunteun J.

Co-localization with the replication protein proliferating cell nuclear antigen was only observed in S-phase cells after treatment with the replication inhibitor hydroxyurea, suggesting that BRCA1/BARD1/RAD51/proliferating cell nuclear antigen complexes can assemble at stalled DNA replication forks (23Scully R.

BRCA1 also responds to different types of DNA damage induced by chemicals or by ultraviolet and ionizing radiation (IR), 1The abbreviations used are: IR, ionizing radiation; YFP, yellow fluorescence protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: IR, ionizing radiation; YFP, yellow fluorescence protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. which cause DNA dimerization and double-stranded breaks, respectively.In IR-treated cells, BRCA1 redistributes into distinct nuclear foci that often co-stain with RAD51 or with RAD50/MRE11/NBS1 protein complexes that mediate homology-directed DNA repair or non-homologous end joining, respectively (6Scully R.

These are then followed by the appearance of RAD50/MRE11/NBS1 (22Zhong Q. Chen C.F. Li S. Chen Y. Wang C.C. Xiao J. Chen P.L. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H.

Despite predictions that the BRCT domain of BRCA1 is likely involved, the key targeting sequences have in fact not been delineated. Involvement of the RING region was suggested by our earlier finding that the N-terminal partner, BARD1, stimulated targeting of BRCA1 to nuclear foci after DNA damage by methyl methanesulfonate (33Fabbro M. Rodriguez J.A. Baer R. Henderson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21315-21324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The BRCT domain was implicated by studies showing that the BRCT mutant form of BRCA1 (5382insC) expressed in HCC1937 breast cancer cells did not form DNA damage-induced foci (21Scully R. Ganesan S.

Moreover, because the tandem BRCT domain from the PAX transactivating domain-interacting protein formed IR-inducible foci in transfected U2OS cells (12Manke I.A. Lowery D.M. Nguyen A. Yaffe M.B. Science. 2003; 302: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), one might predict that the BRCA1 BRCT domain is also sufficient to target BRCA1 to foci. In this study, we show that the BRCT region is sufficient to target BRCA1 to nuclear foci at modest levels in MCF-7 cells and that the RING domain enhanced the efficiency of targeting. This explains the previously reported staining at IR-induced foci of the murine BRCA1 exon 11 splice variant, which lacks the middle half of BRCA1 but retains the RING and BRCT domains (33Fabbro M.

Yellow fluorescence protein (YFP)-tagged BRCA1 wild-type, Δ306–1312, and 1–304 plasmids, and the FLAG-tagged BARD1 plasmid were constructed as described previously (33Fabbro M. Rodriguez J.A. Baer R.

Other YFP-labeled BRCA1 constructs were produced by inserting the YFP coding sequence into the NotI site upstream of the BRCA1 coding sequence in the FLAG-tagged constructs described previously (36Rodriguez J.A.

For the RING-BRCT fusion plasmids, BRCA1 DNA sequences (underlined) encoding the amino acids 1470–1862 (C393) and 1620–1862 (C243) were amplified using the PCR forward primers 5′-AGTCGGAATTCTCTGCAGATAGTTCTACC-3′ and 5′-AGTCGGAATTCACTGATACTGCTGGGTA-3′, respectively, and the reverse primer 5′-AGTCGGAATTCGTAGTGGCTGTGGGGGA-3′. These BRCA1 fragments were inserted into the EcoRI (italicized) site at the end of the 1–304 sequence in the pYFP-BRCA1-(1–304) plasmid. All of the ectopic proteins were expressed from the pFLAG CMV2 human expression vector (Sigma-Aldrich) except for the YFP-BRCA1 C243 plasmid, which was constructed by inserting the BRCA1 C243 fragment (amplified by PCR primers 5′-TGATGCGTCGACACTGATACTGCTGGGTA-3′ and 5′-TGATGCGTCGACGTAGTGGCTGTGGGGGA-3′) into the SalI site of the pEYFP-C1 vector (Clontech).Fig. 3Mapping of BRCA1 nuclear focus-forming regions.

For transfections, cells were seeded on glass coverslips and grown to ∼50% confluence. For each sample, a maximum of 3 μg of plasmid DNA was transfected using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) as indicated by the manufacturer. At 6 h post-transfection, the transfection medium was removed and replaced with the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described above.DNA Damage Treatment and Immunostaining—Approximately 44 h post-transfection, cells were either left untreated or exposed to 15 Gy of γ radiation from a cesium137 source (Gammacell 1000 irradiator, Atomic Energy of Canada) and then allowed to recover at 37 °C for 4 h. This dose and recovery time was determined to produce the most consistent IR response in BRCA1 and closely matches that used in previous BRCA1 studies (e.g. Refs. 12Manke I.A. Lowery D.M. Nguyen A. Yaffe M.B. Science. 2003; 302: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar and 35Huber L.J. Yang T.W. Sarkisian C.J. Master S.R. Deng C.X. Chodosh L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4005-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde-phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min and then permeabilized in 0.2% Triton-PBS for 10 min. To reduce nonspecific staining, cells were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin-PBS for 45 min. We used mouse monoclonal antibody Ab-4 (Oncogene Research) to detect endogenous BRCA1 protein. For BARD1 and MDC1 staining, rabbit BARD1 antibody 59L (gift from Professor Richard Baer) and rabbit MDC1 BL578 antibody (Bethyl Laboratories) were used, respectively. Following 50 min of incubation of the primary antibody, the cells were stained with either biotinylated secondary antibodies (Dako) and Texas Red-avidin D (Vector Laboratories) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33285 (Sigma).Scoring of BRCA1 Nuclear Foci and Cell Imaging—Stained and transfected cells were observed and scored using an Olympus BX40 fluorescence microscope. Each BRCA1 construct was transfected in at least two separate experiments to obtain an average score, and at least 100 cells were counted for each sample. Ectopic BRCA1 foci were scored using a ×100 objective. BRCA1 nuclear focus formation was recorded as either no focus, 1–10 foci, or >10 foci. Cell images were captured by a SPOT RT camera (Diagnostic Instruments) attached to an Olympus BX51 fluorescence microscope.Western Blot Analysis—MCF-7 cells were transfected with various YFP-BRCA1 constructs, and total cell extracts were prepared after 48 h of expression for immunoblot analysis. Cells were resuspended in protein extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with protease inhibitor mix (Roche Applied Science) and shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen. After a quick thaw at 37 °C, the cells were refrozen in liquid nitrogen, rethawed on ice for 20 min, and cleared of insoluble components by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min. Cell extracts were then mixed (2:1) with sample buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and 5% SDS) and denatured at 95 °C for 5 min. Up to 200 μg of whole cell protein extract was loaded per lane, separated on a 6% or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore). The membranes were incubated in blocking solution (5% skim milk powder in PBST (PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20)) for 60 min at room temperature followed by incubation with primary antibody diluted in PBST for 2 h at room temperature. Incubation with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Sigma, 1:10,000) was followed by detection by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) reaction. YFP-BRCA1 fusion proteins were detected using either an anti-green fluorescent protein monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science, 1:800 dilution), or the BRCA1 monoclonal antibody Ab1 (Oncogene Research, 1:100).RESULTSEctopic YFP-BRCA1 Forms Nuclear Foci That Co-localize with BARD1 and MDC1—Several studies have noted the redistribution of endogenous BRCA1 (22Zhong Q.

Deng C.X. Chodosh L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4005-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and of ectopic BRCA1 (37Wu X. Petrini J.H. Heine W.F. Weaver D.T. Livingston D.M. Chen J. Science. 2000; 289: 11Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) after cellular DNA damage elicited by IR. To define those sequences responsible for the damage-dependent relocalization, we first compared the subcellular distribution patterns of transiently expressed YFP-BRCA1 with that of the endogenous BRCA1 protein before and after IR treatment. We examined endogenous BRCA1 in the T47D breast cancer cell line, which expresses a higher level of BRCA1 than MCF-7 cells. Transiently expressed YFP-BRCA1 wild type was assessed in both MCF-7 cells and T47D cells and was co-transfected with pFLAG-BARD1, which we previously showed enhances nuclear localization and focus formation of BRCA1 (33Fabbro M. Rodriguez J.A. Baer R. Henderson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21315-21324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In the majority of untreated cells, both endogenous and ectopic BRCA1 formed large foci (usually <10 per cell), which co-localized with BARD1 and with endogenous MDC1 (Fig. 1). When examined 4 h after a 15-Gy pulse of ionizing radiation, both the endogenous and ectopic BRCA1 had redistributed from large spots (presumably the S-phase foci) to a large number of small foci, which co-stained with BARD1 and the DNA damage response factor MDC1 (Fig. 1). YFP alone did not form nuclear foci with or without IR treatment (data not shown). These tests confirmed that overexpressed YFP-BRCA1 formed IR-responsive nuclear foci in a manner similar to endogenous BRCA1. Because YFP-BRCA1 displayed a clearer IR response in MCF-7 cells than in T47D cells (% cells with >10 foci increased from 9 to 22% in T47D and from 19 to 65% in MCF-7), we used MCF-7 cells to map the foci-targeting sequences of BRCA1.Fig. 1Endogenous BRCA1 and ectopic YFP-BRCA1 form nuclear foci with BARD1 and MDC1.A, endogenous BRCA1 nuclear foci (stained with Ab-4 and Texas Red) co-localize with BARD1 and MDC1 (stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate) in T47D cells before and after 15-Gy IR treatment and 4 h of recovery. B, YFP-tagged wild-type BRCA1 was transfected into MCF-7 cells and assessed 48 h later for nuclear foci, which also co-localized with BARD1 and MDC1 (stained with Texas Red). Note the redistribution of BRCA1 from few and larger spots in untreated cells to small and more dispersed foci in IR-treated cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cancer Mutations in the BRCT Domain Disrupt BRCA1 Nuclear Focus Formation—To compare the effect of known cancer mutations on BRCA1 nuclear focus formation, we co-transfected different YFP-tagged BRCA1 mutant proteins with pFLAG-BARD1 into MCF-7 cells (Fig. 2). The majority (67%) of untreated transfected cells expressing wild-type BRCA1 exhibited <10 distinct nuclear foci. After IR treatment, the proportion of YFP-BRCA1-positive cells with >10 foci had increased from 19% (no treatment) to 65%. As we recently observed in cells exposed to methyl methanesulfonate (34Rodriguez J.A. Au W.W. Henderson B.R. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 293: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the BRCT-truncated mutant BRCA1–5382insC failed to cluster in nuclear foci before or after IR-induced DNA damage (Fig. 2). Similarly, three other frequently studied C-terminal BRCT mutants, P1749R, M1775R, and Y1853X, all displayed a dramatic decrease in foci localization compared with the wild-type protein. In contrast, the N-terminal RING domain mutant C61G, which is defective for ubiquitin ligase activity (8Hashizume R. Fukuda M. Maeda I. Nishikawa H. Oyake D. Yabuki Y. Ogata H. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14537-14540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), was only modestly reduced in its overall ability to form foci and still exhibited a potent response to IR treatment (59% of cells with >10 foci). Note that only nuclear-stained cells were scored and that BARD1 can stimulate nuclear localization of all the BRCA1 mutants tested (33Fabbro M. Rodriguez J.A. Baer R. Henderson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21315-21324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 34Rodriguez J.A. Au W.W. Henderson B.R. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 293: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that cancer mutations in the BRCT domain, but not the RING domain, affect the recruitment of BRCA1 to the sites of DNA damage and repair.The Combination of RING and BRCT Domains Results in Highly Efficient Targeting to IR-induced Nuclear Foci—We next mapped the critical foci targeting sequence(s) of BRCA1, employing the same co-transfection strategy as described in Fig. 2. In transfected MCF-7 cells, ectopic YFP-BRCA1 with a C-terminal truncation of both BRCT motifs (amino acids 1–1637) exhibited severe loss of foci in untreated and IR-treated cells (see Fig. 3). Deletion of the RING domain (amino acids 170–1863) also caused a marked reduction in focus formation but not as dramatic as the loss of the BRCT domain, with 53% of untreated cells displaying 1–10 foci and following IR treatment up to 18% of cells revealing >10 foci (Fig. 4A). These results are generally consistent with results observed for the cancer point mutations (Fig. 2) and indicated that the C terminus of BRCA1 may play a more significant role than the N terminus in nuclear focus formation.Fig. 4Quantification of IR-induced BRCA1 nuclear foci.A, BRCA1 nuclear foci scoring results for each of the various YFP-BRCA1 sequences expressed in MCF-7 cells with or without 15 Gy of IR and 4 h of recovery. B, similar quantification of foci formed in T47D cells transfected with key BRCA1 constructs as shown. Average percentage of transfected cells (±S.E) are shown for no focus, 1–10 foci, and >10 foci. White bars represent untreated samples, and black bars represent irradiated samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We therefore tested three sequential (and slightly overlapping) BRCA1 subfragments comprising amino acids 1–304, 279–1315, and 1290–1863. Although the 1290–1863 fragment is less nuclear due to lack of nuclear import signals (33Fabbro M. Rodriguez J.A. Baer R. Henderson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21315-21324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), it displayed sufficient nuclear staining for unambiguous detection of IR-inducible foci. Interestingly, all three individual subfragments lost the ability to form nuclear foci efficiently (±IR treatment). The 1290–1863 fragment contains the BRCT domain, and we were interested to know if the BRCT sequence alone would respond the same way, given that the BRCT fragment of the PAX transactivating domain-interacting protein was reported to form IR-induced nuclear foci (12Manke I.A. Lowery D.M. Nguyen A. Yaffe M.B. Science. 2003; 302: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). We therefore cloned and tested the core BRCT domain of BRCA1 (amino acids 1620–1862, named “C243”), which was observed to form some foci before IR (53% of cells with 1–10 foci) and after IR treatment (cells with >10 foci increased from 2 to 13%).

https://openalex.org/W2102489344,"Previous studies have shown that epithelial Na+ channels (ENaCs) are activated by laminar shear stress (LSS). ENaCs with a high intrinsic open probability because of a mutation (βS518K) or covalent modification of an introduced Cys residue (αS580C) in the pre-second transmembrane domain (pre-M2) were not activated by LSS, suggesting that the pre-M2 region participates in conformational rearrangements during channel activation. We examined the role of the pore region of the α-subunit in channel gating by studying the kinetics of activation by LSS of wild-type ENaC and channels with Cys mutations in the tract Ser576–Ser592. Whole cell Na+ currents were monitored in oocytes expressing wild-type or mutant ENaCs prior to and following application of LSS. Following a 2.2-s delay, a monoexponential increase in Na+ currents was observed with a time constant (τ) of 8.1 s in oocytes expressing wild-type ENaC. Cys substitutions within the α-subunit in the tract Ser580–Ser589 resulted in: (i) a reduction (Ser580–Trp585, Gly587) or increase (Ser589) in delay times preceding channel activation by LSS, (ii) an increase (Gln581, Leu584, Trp585, Phe586, Ser588) or decrease (Ser589) in the rate of channel activation, or (iii) a decrease in the magnitude of the response (Ser583, Gly587, Leu584). Cys substitutions at a putative amiloride-binding site (αSer583 or βGly525) or within the selectivity filter (αGly587) resulted in a reduction in the LSS response, and exhibited a multiexponential time course of activation. The corresponding γ-subunit mutant (αβγG542C) had a minimal response to LSS and exhibited a high intrinsic open probability. These data suggest that residues in the pore region participate in the sensing and/or transduction of the mechanical stimulus that results in channel activation and are consistent with the hypothesis that the ENaC pore region has a key role in modulating channel gating.

The amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) 1The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial sodium channel; LSS, laminar shear stress; mENaC, mouse ENaC; M2, second membrane-spanning domain; TEV, two-electrode voltage clamp; ANOVA, analysis of variance. is a member of the degenerin/ENaC family of ion channels that encodes a group of related proteins implicated in the control of Na+ homeostasis, salt taste, nociception, and mechanotransduction (1Kellenberger S. Schild L. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 735-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 2Mano I. Driscoll M. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 568-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Degenerin/ENaC family members form homo- or heteromeric channels composed of subunits that are similar in structure, with two membrane-spanning domains linked by a large extracellular region, and intracellular N and C termini. ENaCs are composed of three subunits α, β, and γ, arranged with a presumed subunit stoichiometry of 2α:1β:1γ (3Kosari F. Sheng S. Li J. Mak D.O. Foskett J.K. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol.

ENaCs mediate Na+ transport across apical membranes of epithelial cells that line the distal nephron, airway and alveoli, and distal colon. In addition, ENaC subunits are expressed in mechanosensory structures, including the Merkel cell-neurite complex and baroreceptor terminal endings (6Welsh M.J. Price M.P. Xie J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2369-2372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), although their functional roles have not been elucidated. Micropuncture and microperfusion studies of distal nephron segments have revealed that rates of K+ secretion and Na+ reabsorption are flow-dependent (7Khuri R.N. Strieder W.N. Giebisch G. Am. J.

Similar to cells lining the vasculature, cortical-collecting duct cells experience two kinds of forces in response to changes in rates of flow, circumferential stretch, and fluid flow-induced shear (12Liu W.

We recently demonstrated that laminar fluid perfusion of oocytes expressing ENaCs resulted in a flow-dependent increase in whole cell Na+ currents. Furthermore, mutant channels (αβS518Kγ or αS580Cβγ following modification by a specific sulfhydryl reagent) that are known to exhibit a high intrinsic open probability did not respond to laminar shear stress (LSS), suggesting that LSS activates ENaC by increasing channel open probability (13Carattino M.D. Sheng S.

For example, the combination of site-specific introduction of Cys residues and covalent modification by thiol-reactive reagents has shown that the pre-M2 region of ENaC subunits has a role in the regulation of channel gating (16Sheng S.

Channels with introduced Cys residues at selected sites in the α-subunit preceding a putative amiloride-binding site (Val572, Ser576, Asn577, Ser580, Gln581, and Trp582) responded to thiol-reactive reagents with increases in activity that are likely caused by increases in channel open probability (16Sheng S.

In contrast, an amiloride binding site mutant (αS583C) responded to thiol-reactive reagents with a large decrease of channel activity. We have examined whether the introduction of Cys residues in the pre-M2 region of the α-subunit, at sites adjacent to or within the selectivity filter region, alters the response of ENaC to LSS. We observed that Cys substitutions within the tract αSer580–αSer589 produced significant changes in the time course of channel activation by LSS, suggesting that conformational changes in this area occur during channel gating in response to LSS. DNA Constructs—Point mutations of mouse ENaC subunits were previously generated by site-directed mutagenesis with the sequential polymerase chain reaction method using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (16Sheng S.

Oocyte Expression—cRNAs for α, β, and γ mENaC subunits were synthesized with T3 mMessage mMachine™ (Ambion, Austin, TX). Stage V-VI Xenopus laevis oocytes were pretreated with 1.5 mg/ml type IV collagenase and injected with 0.2–4 ng of cRNA/subunit depending on the mutant to be investigated. Injected oocytes were maintained at 18 °C in modified Barth's saline (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 15 mm HEPES, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, pH 7.4) supplemented with 10 μg/ml sodium penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate. Two-electrode Voltage Clamp—Two-electrode voltage clamp (TEV) was performed at 22–25 °C using a GeneClamp 500B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Temperatures were determined with a probe localized in close proximity to the oocyte with a TC-10 temperature controller (Dagan, Minneapolis, MN). Data were acquired through Clampex 8.0 using a DigiData 1200 interface and stored on the hard disk of a 233 MHz Pentium II computer. Pipettes filled with 3 m KCl had resistances of 0.5–5 MΩ. The extracellular solution (TEV solution) was (in mm): 110 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.54 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. The recording chamber was perfused at a rate of 3.5 ml/min. Laminar shear stress was applied by perfusing TEV solution through a vertical pipette localized above the oocyte surface at a rate of 1.6 ml/min, corresponding to 0.137 dynes/cm2 of shear stress as described previously (13Carattino M.D. Sheng S. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4120-4126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Bath perfusion was maintained during application of LSS. ENaC-mediated whole cell Na+ currents were defined as the benzamil-sensitive component of the current. To determine the time course of activation by LSS, oocytes were clamped at a holding potential of –60 mV and stimulated by perfusion through a vertical pipette with a computer-controlled protocol generated in pClamp 8.0. Following the stimulation process, the ENaC-mediated component of the whole cell Na+ current was determined by bath perfusion with TEV solution supplemented with 5 μm benzamil, unless otherwise indicated. Na+ Self-inhibition—Two-electrode voltage clamp was performed 20–48 h after injection of oocytes with cRNAs for αβγ or αβγG542C mENaCs. Oocytes were bathed in a low or high [Na+] solution and continuously clamped at –60 mV. The bath solutions contain either 1 mm (low) or 110 mm (high) NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES with a pH of 7.4. In the low [Na+] solution, Na+ was replaced by N-methyl-d-glucamine. Low and high [Na+] bath solutions were rapidly exchanged with a computer-controlled perfusion system (Auto-Mate Scientific Inc., San Francisco, CA). The inward current decay following a fast switching from low [Na+] to high [Na+] bath solution represents the response of Na+ self-inhibition as described previously (20Sheng S. Bruns J.B.

Chem. 2004; 279: 31687-31696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The decay was fitted with an exponential equation to obtain a time constant (τ). The magnitude of the inhibition is indicated by the ratio of the steady state (Iss) to the peak current (Ipeak). Single Channel Studies—Bath and pipette solutions were identical containing 110 mm LiCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm KCl, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Oocytes were placed in a hypertonic solution (bath solution supplemented with 200 mm sucrose) for 5–10 min, and the vitelline membranes were removed manually. The oocytes were then transferred to the bath solution at room temperature (22–25 °C). Patch pipettes with a tip resistance of 5–12 megohms were used. Currents were recorded in the cell-attached mode using an Axopatch 200B Amplifier (Axon Instruments) and a DigiData 1322A interface (Axon Instruments) connected to a Pentium 4 PC (Gateway). Single channel recordings were acquired using pClamp 9.0 (Axon) at 20 kHz, filtered at 1000 Hz by a 4-pole low pass Bessel Filter built in the amplifier, and stored on the hard disk. Single channel currents were further filtered at 100 Hz with a Gaussian filter for display and analysis. Recordings were performed at +60 mV (pipette potential). Single channel currents were estimated from amplitude histograms generated from recordings. Open probabilities were determined by fitting amplitude histograms of at least 4 min in duration with Gaussian functions by the Levenberg-Marquardt method using pClamp 6 (Axon Instruments). Data and Statistical Analyses—Data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. (n), where n equals the number of independent experiments analyzed. Data were analyzed with Clampfit 9.0 (Axon Instruments) or SigmaPlot 8.02 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The time constant of activation (τ) was determined by fitting experimental data with the exponential function shown in Equation 1, I=c+a×e−t/τ(Eq. 1) where I is the macroscopic current, τ is the time constant, and a and c are constants determined by curve fitting. For αG587Cβγ channels, the time course of activation was fit with Equation 2, I=c+a1×e−t/τ1+a2×e−t/τ2(Eq. 2) where I is the macroscopic current, τ1 and τ2 are time constants, a1, a2, and c are constants determined by curve fitting. To determine the parameters of the exponential function, currents were fit excluding data within 5–10% of the beginning of the exponential phase, which produced the best fit of the exponential increase. For mutants carrying mutations in the amiloride binding site (αS583Cβγ and αβG525Cγ), the response to LSS was not monoexponential. For oocytes expressing αS583Cβγ channels only the late phase of current increase was adequately estimated by fitting with an exponential function. For the αβG525Cγ mutant, recordings were visually inspected and currents were fit by a single exponential function including data from each of the two exponential steps. The delay time (δ) was estimated as the time between the delivery of the stimulus and the intersection of the exponential phase with the baseline current, using Equation 3, δ=−τ×lnI0−ca(Eq. 3) where I0 is the current at time 0 before stimulation (see Fig. 2). For the mutants αS583Cβγ, αβG525Cγ, and αG587Cβγ, delay times were determined as the time at which the initial change in current occurred by inspection of the recordings. Statistical comparisons were performed using GraphPad Instant (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Whereas the location and nature of the ENaC gate and mechanisms by which signals are transmitted to alter channel openings and closures have not been defined, analyses of ENaC mutants have shown that multiple regions within ENaC influence channel gating (1Kellenberger S.

Previous studies have shown that selected mutations within the pre-M2 tract have dramatic effects on channel gating (18Snyder P.M. Bucher D.B. Olson D.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 22Waldmann R. Champigny G. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11735-11737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We examined the kinetics of ENaC activation by LSS, and the effects of Cys substitutions of residues in the pre-M2 region of the α-subunit on this process. Fig. 1 shows the pre-M2 region of mouse ENaC (mENaC) subunits. Sites associated with alterations of ENaC activity following covalent modification of introduced Cys residues with thiol-reactive reagents are illustrated. A putative amiloride-binding site and a key three-residue selectivity filter are also shown. Oocytes expressing wild-type channels or ENaCs with individual Cys substitutions in the tract αSer576–αSer592 of mENaC were positioned in a chamber and stimulated by delivery of a fluid jet of TEV solution as described under “Materials and Methods.” Whole cell Na+ currents were monitored at a holding potential of –60 mV. Following the stimulation period, oocytes were perfused with TEV solution containing 5 μm benzamil, unless otherwise indicated. Previous analyses of the kinetics of the voltage-dependent activation of Shaker potassium channels have shown a discrete delay time between a voltage pulse and observable increase in channel open probability (23Schoppa N.E. Sigworth F.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 271-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 24Zagotta W.N. Hoshi T. Dittman J. Aldrich R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 279-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In a similar manner, analyses of ENaC activation by LSS show a delay time between the delivery of the LSS stimulus and the monoexponential increase in whole cell Na+ current (Fig. 2). The delay time for oocytes expressing wild-type channels was 2.18 ± 0.11 s (n = 57, see Fig. 2). We previously reported a half-time for activation (time at which the current is 50% of maximum) by LSS of ∼5 s (13Carattino M.D. Sheng S. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4120-4126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In agreement with our previously published findings, the time constant (τ) for ENaC activation was 8.06 ± 0.33 s (n = 57). Fig. 2 illustrates a representative response to LSS, as well as the methods employed to determine the delay time (δ) and the time constant (τ) for the monoexponential increase in whole cell Na+ current. Analyses of delay times between the delivery of the LSS stimulus and a monoexponential increase in whole cell Na+ current (Fig. 3) revealed that oocytes expressing Cys mutations in the tract αSer580–αTrp585 exhibited a significantly reduced δ, compared with wild-type channels (Fig. 3). Analyses of oocytes expressing mutations in the amiloride binding site (αS583Cβγ, αβG525Cγ, αβγG542C) and the selectivity filter (αS587C and αS589C) are shown in separate figures. The delay time for channel activation by LSS likely represents electrically silent steps that occur prior to increases in macroscopic currents. Analyses of the time course of the exponential activation by LSS showed that Cys substitutions at αGln581, αLeu584, αTrp585, αPhe586, and αSer588 led to a significant reduction of the time constant for channel activation (Fig. 4). Fig. 5 illustrates representative recordings of whole cell current activation by LSS of wild-type channel and selected ENaC mutants that exhibited an altered δ or τ. We previously presented a structural model of the ENaC pore region, based on MTS reagent accessibility and secondary structural predictions (16Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Kieber-Emmons T. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1326-1334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Residues between αVal572 and αSer580 were proposed to form a α-helix. Furthermore, we proposed that a transition region (residues αSer580–αSer583) was followed by an extended region (αLeu584–αSer592) that includes the selectivity filter (αSer587–αSer589). Our results indicate that mutations in the predicted transition and extended regions from αSer580 to αSer589 are associated with changes in the time course of activation during LSS stimulation.Fig. 5Representative tracings of LSS-induced activation of wild-type and Cys-substituted mENaCs. Wild-type- or Cys-substituted mENaC-expressing oocytes were perfused with TEV solution, and a computer-controlled perfusion system was used to activate fluid-jet perfusion via a vertical pipette as is indicated by the vertical dash line. Currents were monitored at a holding potential of –60 mV. Data were fit by an exponential function as indicated under “Materials and Methods” (gray line).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also examined whether Cys substitutions in the tract αSer576–αSer592 affects the magnitude of the LSS response. Whole cell Na+ currents were measured prior to and following stimulation by LSS, and after bath perfusion with 5 μm benzamil. Ratios of the benzamil-sensitive peak current, relative to the benzamil-sensitive basal current (Ipeak/Ibasal) are shown in Fig. 6. Data are presented relative to the response of wild-type ENaC. The Ipeak/Ibasal of wild-type ENaC was 1.37 ± 0.04 (n = 62), in agreement with our previously published findings (13Carattino M.D. Sheng S. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4120-4126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Cys substitutions at multiple sites between αSer576 and αSer592 modified the magnitude of the response to LSS. However, a statistically significant difference was only observed between oocytes expressing wild-type and αL584Cβγ channels when data were compared by nonparametric ANOVA (Kruskal Wallis test) followed by Dunn's multiple comparisons post-test. Previous studies have identified a homologous site in the β- and γ-subunits (βGly525 and γGly542) where Cys substitutions result in a dramatic decrease in the apparent affinity of the channel for amiloride (3Kosari F.

Firsov D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Cys substitution at the homologous position in the α-subunit (αSer583) was associated with only a modest change in amiloride affinity (3Kosari F. Sheng S. Li J. Mak D.O. Foskett J.K. Kleyman T.R. J.

Furthermore, covalent modification of channels with Cys substitutions at these sites (αSer583, βGly525, or γGly542) by sulfhydryl-reactive reagents led to irreversible channel block (3Kosari F.

Oocytes expressing the amiloride-binding site mutants αS583Cβγ or αβG525γ responded to LSS with a biphasic activation of whole cell Na+ currents (Fig. 7). The delay times for αS583Cβγ and αβG525Cγ were also significantly shorter than that observed for wild-type channels (Fig. 8A and Table I). Current activation of oocytes expressing αS583Cβγ and αβG525Cγ channels stimulated by LSS was fit by visual inspection of the recordings (Fig. 8B). For oocytes expressing αS583Cβγ channels, only the late phase of current increase was adequately estimated by a single exponential function. For αβG525Cγ channels, currents were fit by single exponential functions including data from each of the two exponential steps. The results show that the activation process involved multiple steps as indicated by delay times and time constants of activation (Table I). The extent of activation of mutated channels at the amiloride-binding site in response to LSS was significantly reduced, when compared with wild-type channels (Fig. 8C). Surprisingly, for αβγG542C the response was too small to determine delay times and time constants.Fig. 8Delay times, time constants, and relative responses to LSS of oocytes expressing wild-type ENaCs or channels with mutations in the putative amiloride-binding site.

For αS583Cβγ, τ was determined for the late phase of channel activation in response to LSS. For αβG525Cγ, τ was determined for the early and late phase of channel activation. C, relative response to LSS. The peak response of the whole cell Na+ current following the initiation of LSS was normalized to the basal current immediately preceding LSS.

A substantial fraction of ischemic EAA release occurs via volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs). Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is abundantly produced during ischemia and reperfusion, activates a number of protein kinases critical for VRAC functioning and has recently been reported to activate VRACs. In the present study, we explored the effects of H2O2 on volume-dependent EAA release in cultured astrocytes, measured as the release of preloaded d-[3H]aspartate. 100–1,000 μm H2O2 enhanced swelling-induced EAA release by ∼2.5–3-fold (EC50 ≈ 10 μm). The VRAC blockers ATP, phloretin, and 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoate (NPPB) potently inhibited both control swelling-induced and the H2O2-potentiated release, suggesting a role for VRACs. The H2O2-induced component of EAA release was attenuated by the Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM) and completely eliminated by the calmodulin antagonists trifluoperazine and W-7 and the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitor KN-93. Inhibitors of tyrosine kinases, protein kinase C, and the myosin light chain kinase were ineffective in blocking the H2O2 response. H2O2 treatment of swollen astrocytes, but not swelling alone, resulted in CaMKII activation that was inhibited by KN-93, as determined by a phospho-Thr286 CaMKII antibody. These data demonstrate that H2O2 strongly up-regulates astrocytic volume-sensitive EAA release via a CaMKII-dependent mechanism and in this way may potently promote pathological EAA release and brain damage in ischemia.

VRACs are ubiquitously expressed, activated in response to cell swelling, and characterized by Eisenman type I anion selectivity (I– > NO –3 > Br– > Cl– > F–), moderate outward rectification, and inactivation at positive potentials (7Strange K.

These anion channels are also permeable to a variety of small organic osmolytes including amino acids, polyols, and methylamines (7Strange K. Emma F. Jackson P.S. Am. J.

Although the molecular identity of VRACs and the precise mechanisms of their regulation are not known, VRAC activation is probably provoked by pronounced pathological cell swelling, primarily seen in astrocytes in ischemia (12Garcia J.H. Kalimo H. Kamijyo Y. Trump B.F. Virchows Arch. B Cell Pathol. 1977; 25: 191-206PubMed Google Scholar, 13Liu K.F. Li F.H. Tatlisumak T. Garcia J.H. Sotak C.H. Fisher M. Fenstermacher J.D.

It is not known whether, in addition to cell swelling, other pathological factors play a role in VRAC-mediated EAA release. Several recent publications have demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induces typical VRAC currents in the absence of cell swelling in HeLa and hepatoma cell lines (15Shimizu T. Numata T.

J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 192: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Because H2O2 and other reactive oxygen species are abundantly produced in ischemia and during reperfusion (18Chan P.H.

In line with such a suggestion, reactive oxygen species positively modulate the activity of a number of protein kinases, such as tyrosine kinases, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), protein kinase C (PKC), and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) (20Cai H.

In the present work, we examined the potential role of H2O2 in mediating the activation or modulation of excitatory amino acid release via a putative VRAC pathway and explored intracellular signaling mechanisms involved in the H2O2 effects in primary astrocyte cultures. Chemicals—The neutral protease dispase was obtained from Roche Diagnostics, and all other cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen. d-[3H]aspartate was purchased from PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences and Na2[51Cr]O4 from Amersham Biosciences. Hydrogen peroxide, ATP disodium salt, phloretin, 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoate (NPPB) and trifluoperazine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. PP2, U0126, W-7, and W-5 were obtained from Tocris (Ellisville, MO). SU6656, tyrphostin A51, chelerythrine, Go6983, bisindolylmaleimide I, Ro32-0432, BAPTA-AM, ML-7, and KN-93 were purchased from Calbiochem. Cell Culture—Confluent primary astrocyte cultures were prepared according to the method of Frangakis and Kimelberg (33Frangakis M.V. Kimelberg H.K. Neurochem. Res. 1984; 9: 1689-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) with minor modifications as described elsewhere (34Mongin A.A. Cai Z. Kimelberg H.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C823-C832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the cerebral cortices of neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats were separated from the basal ganglia, followed by the removal of the meninges. Tissue was dissociated using the neutral protease Dispase. The cells were then plated on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips or Petri dishes and grown for 3–4 weeks in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and 50 units/ml penicillin plus 50 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified 5% CO2/95% air atmosphere at 37 °C. Culture medium was replaced biweekly, and the penicillin and streptomycin were removed from the medium after 10 days of cultivation. Excitatory Amino Acid and [51Cr] Release—Confluent astrocyte cultures grown on 18 × 18 mm glass coverslips were loaded overnight with d-[3H]aspartate (4 μCi/ml; final concentration, 270 nm) or Na2[51Cr]O4 (16 μCi/ml; final concentration, 340 nm) in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum. d-[3H]aspartate is a non-metabolized analogue of l-glutamate and l-aspartate, which is taken up by glutamate transporters in the same manner as l-glutamate. Before the start of each experiment, extracellular isotope was washed out with a basal HEPES-buffered medium (122 mm NaCl, 3.3 mm KCl, 0.4 mm MgSO4, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm d-glucose, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 285 mOsm). The coverslips were then placed into a custom-made Lucite perfusion chamber, maintained in a 37 °C incubator throughout the experiments, and superfused at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min with the basal HEPES-buffered medium or a hypo-osmotic HEPES-buffered medium (72 mm NaCl, 3.3 mm KCl, 0.4 mm MgSO4, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm d-glucose, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 195 mOsm). Media osmolarities were checked using a freezing point μOsmette osmometer (Precision Systems, Natick, MA). The superfusate samples were collected each minute, and at the end of each experiment, the remaining intracellular isotope was extracted with 2% SDS + 8 mm EDTA. The radioactivity of each sample was counted for 3Hor 51Cr by a Tri-Carb 2900TR liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences). Isotope release levels are presented as fractional release values for each time point, calculated by dividing the radioactivity released at each minute interval by the radioactivity remaining in the cells at that time point (includes isotope levels from cell lysis plus isotope levels in the remaining fractions). Cell Volume Measurements—Relative cell volume changes were measured using the cell-permeable fluorescent probe calcein. Changes in the calcein signal positively correlate with changes in cell volume (35Solenov E. Watanabe H. Manley G.T. Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C426-C432Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Cells were loaded with 1 μm calcein-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 15 min at room temperature. After washout of extracellular calcein, astrocytes plated on round coverslips were transferred into a perfusion chamber (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT), and perfused at ∼1 ml/min throughout the experiment with HEPES-buffered basal or hypo-osmotic media (see above for composition). All experiments were performed at room temperature. The changes in fluorescence intensity of a field of confluent cells were monitored with a 25× objective using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Heidelberg, Germany) at 488-nm excitation and long pass 505-nm emission. Images were scanned every 30 s. Relative changes in fluorescence intensity were calculated using Zeiss image analysis software. Intracellular Calcium Measurements—Qualitative changes in [Ca2+]i levels were determined using the cell-permeable fluorescent [Ca2+]i indicator fluo-4-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Confluent cultured astrocytes, plated on round coverslips, were loaded for 1 h with 5 μm fluo-4-AM at room temperature. After the washout of extracellular fluo-4, the coverslips were placed in a perfusion chamber (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) and perfused with HEPES-buffered basal or hypo-osmotic medium (for media composition see above). The experiments were all performed at room temperature. The fluorescent images were scanned every 5 s with a 25× objective using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Heidelberg, Germany) at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and a long pass 505 nm emission. The relative changes in fluo-4 intensity for a field of confluent cells were calculated using Zeiss image analysis software. Western Blot Analysis—Autophosphorylated active CaMKII levels and total CaMKII expression were assessed by Western blot analysis using a phospho-Thr286 CaMKII antibody (Promega, Madison, WI) and a pan CaMKII antibody (gift of Dr. Harold A. Singer, Albany Medical College, Albany, NY), respectively. Confluent astrocyte cultures were subjected to various treatment conditions as specified under “Results” and subsequently lysed with 2% SDS plus 8 mm EDTA. The total protein content of the lysates was determined using a colorimetric BCA assay kit (Pierce). Whole cell lysates were diluted with a standard reducing buffer and separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel followed by transfer to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The transfer membranes were blocked overnight with 10% nonfat milk in a Tris-buffered solution containing 0.05% Tween 20. Membranes were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with either a phospho-Thr286 CaMKII polyclonal antibody (1:5,000 dilution) or a pan CaMKII polyclonal antibody (1:2,000 dilution). After five washes with Tris-buffered solution containing 0.05% Tween 20, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary rabbit antibodies (1:10,000; Amersham Biosciences). The horseradish peroxidase signal was detected by autoradiography using a chemiluminescence ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and SuperRX x-ray film (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). The optical densities of the immunoreactive bands were analyzed using TotalLab Control Centre software (Nonlinear Dynamics, Durham, NC). Statistical Analysis—The statistical significance of the data was determined with one-way analyses of variance, followed by post-hoc Newman-Keuls tests for multiple comparisons. Repeated-measures analyses of variance were also used where indicated. Origin 7.5 (OriginLab Corp, Northampton, MA) and Statistica 6.1 (StatSoft, Tulsa, OH) were used for statistical analysis. Hydrogen Peroxide Potentiates Swelling-sensitive EAA Release—We used d-[3H]aspartate as a tracer for EAA because it is not metabolized and is released through the same swelling-induced permeability pathways as l-[3H]glutamate (36Kimelberg H.K. Goderie S.K. Higman S. Pang S. Waniewski R.A. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In astrocyte cultures, cell swelling induced by a 30% reduction in medium osmolarity (–90 mOsm) initiated a large release of preloaded d-[3H]aspartate (Fig. 1A). H2O2, given 10 min before and continuously during hypo-osmotic medium application, potentiated peak swelling-induced EAA release in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). The H2O2-effect was saturated at concentrations ≥100 μm (EC50 = 8.2 ± 4.0 μm, as determined by a dose-response curve fit, R2 = 0.98). 500 μm H2O2 was used throughout the study to ensure maximal activity. 100–1,000 μm H2O2 enhanced swelling-induced EAA release by ∼2.5–3-fold (Fig. 1, A and B). In the absence of cell swelling, 500 μm H2O2 failed to initiate any rapid increases in EAA release, although it did induce a gradual upward shift in d-[3H]aspartate baseline values (Fig. 1A). After removal of H2O2, we typically observed a secondary increase in d-[3H]aspartate release compared with control baseline release, the degree of which varied between cell culture preparations. Because this secondary release was observed only after the removal of H2O2, we did not investigate its origin. To verify that the H2O2-induced potentiation of EAA release was not caused by additional cell swelling, we monitored relative cell volume changes using calcein fluorescence (35Solenov E. Watanabe H. Manley G.T. Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C426-C432Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Exposure to hypo-osmotic medium produced a ∼4.5% increase in calcein fluorescence (Fig. 1C), which positively correlates to changes in cell volume (35Solenov E. Watanabe H. Manley G.T. Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C426-C432Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). 500 μm H2O2 produced no additional changes in calcein fluorescence before and during hypo-osmotic medium exposure (Fig. 1C).Fig. 1Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) augments volume-sensitive excitatory amino acid release in cultured astrocytes.

The data are the means ± S.E. of four to six experiments, representing peak swelling-induced d-[3H]aspartate release in the presence of 1–1,000 μm H2O2. C, H2O2 does not induce additional cell swelling. Calcein-loaded cultured astrocytes were exposed to hypo-osmotic medium for 10 min in the absence (○, n = 7) or presence (•, n = 6) of 500 μm H2O2. The data represent the means ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Hydrogen Peroxide-induced EAA Release Is Mediated by Volume-regulated Anion Channels—To confirm that the H2O2-induced enhancement of EAA release was not caused by cell lysis or detachment, we monitored the efflux of preloaded Na2[51Cr]O4. Radiolabeled chromate is taken inside cells where it binds to intracellular components, and its appearance in the superfusate corresponds mostly to cell lysis or detachment (37Kimelberg H.K. Bonville D.J. Goderie S.K. Brain Res. 1993; 622: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Exposure to 500 μm H2O2 produced negligible increases in [51Cr] efflux levels compared with the robust release of d-[3H]aspartate, thus ruling out cell lysis or toxicity as a reason for H2O2-induced EAA release (Fig. 2A). 20-min exposure to 500 μm H2O2 produced no changes in astrocyte morphology (Supplemental Figure). To establish that the H2O2 enhancement of hypo-osmotic EAA release is mediated by VRACs, we used several VRAC blockers and compared their effects on EAA release in the presence or absence of H2O2. 10 mm ATP (which at this concentration acts as an open pore VRAC blocker (8Okada Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C755-C789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), 100 μm phloretin (which inhibits VRACs but not cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator channel or Ca2+-activated Cl– channels at the concentration used (38Fan H.T. Morishima S. Kida H. Okada Y. Br.J. Pharmacol. 2001; 133: 1096-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar)), and the broad spectrum anion channel blocker 100 μm NPPB (8Okada Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C755-C789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) all potently inhibited hypo-osmotic medium-induced EAA release both during control astrocyte swelling and in the presence of 500 μm H2O2 (Fig. 2B). Intracellular Signaling Mechanisms Involved in the H2O2 Effect on EAA Release—H2O2 activates non-receptor tyrosine kinases of the src family, receptor tyrosine kinases, and, down-stream, enzymes of the MAPK cascade (22Droge W. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 47-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (7268) Google Scholar, 39Griendling K.K. Sorescu D. Lassegue B. Ushio-Fukai M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2175-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar), all of which have been found to contribute to VRAC activation (23van Tilly B.C. Den B.N. Tertoolen L.G.

Therefore, we tested for the contribution of tyrosine and MAP kinases in mediating the H2O2 effect on swelling-induced EAA release. The selective src kinase inhibitors PP2 (10 μm) or SU6656 (5 μm) (40Bain J. McLauchlan H. Elliott M. Cohen P. Biochem.J. 2003; 371: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar), the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin A51 (20 μm) (41Levitzki A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 40: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), or the MEK inhibitor U0126 (10 μm) (42Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem.J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3908) Google Scholar), did not block the H2O2-induced potentiation of EAA release (Fig. 3A). We also examined the potential role of PKC because this enzyme is also activated by H2O2 (43Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11233-11237Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 44Konishi H. Yamauchi E. Taniguchi H. Yamamoto T. Matsuzaki H. Takemura Y. Ohmae K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In contrast, the PKC inhibitor 5 μm chelerythrine completely blocked the H2O2-evoked enhancement in EAA release (Fig. 3B). Two Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent enzymes known to be activated by H2O2, the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), and CaMKII, have also been found to regulate VRACs (20Cai H. Davis M.E. Drummond G.R. Harrison D.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1571-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 27Cardin V. Lezama R. Torres-Marquez M.E. Pasantes-Morales H.

Fisher S.K. J. Neurochem. 2003; 87: 476-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We therefore explored whether changes in intracellular Ca2+ and the activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent enzymes are involved in the H2O2 effect. Using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fluo-4-AM, we found that H2O2 pretreatment produces a steady rise in [Ca2+]i levels before the induction of cell swelling (Fig. 4, A and B). Hypo-osmotic medium-induced cell swelling itself caused a steep increase in [Ca2+]i followed by a gradual recovery toward baseline values (Fig. 4B). In the presence of 500 μm H2O2, swelling-induced [Ca2+]i release on average tended to be somewhat higher, but this effect was not statistically significant (Fig. 4B). To test for Ca2+ involvement in the H2O2 effect on EAA release, we pretreated cultured astrocytes for 20 min with the cell membrane-permeable Ca2+ chelator 10 μm BAPTA-AM, followed by a 10-min wash out. BAPTA-AM pretreatment partially reduced the H2O2-induced increment in EAA release but had no statistically significant effect on control swelling-induced EAA release (Fig. 4C). The calmodulin antagonists trifluoperazine (20 μm) and W-7 (20 μm) (51Massom L. Lee H. Jarrett H.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 671-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 52Hidaka H. Asano M. Tanaka T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1981; 20: 571-578PubMed Google Scholar) completely eliminated the H2O2-induced potentiation of swelling-induced d-[3H]aspartate release (Fig. 4D). On the other hand, the inactive structural analogue of W-7, W-5 (20 μm), was ineffective in reducing the H2O2 effect (Fig. 4D). In contrast to their effects in the presence of H2O2, trifluoperazine and W-7 did not reduce EAA release under control hypo-osmotic conditions (Fig. 4D). To determine the specific Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent enzymes involved in the H2O2 effect, we used inhibitors of MLCK (ML-7 (40Bain J. McLauchlan H. Elliott M. Cohen P.

Here we show that LiCl can alleviate the translational repression of these mRNAs when progression through the cell cycle is blocked at G0, G1/S, or G2/M phases in different cell lines and by various physiological and chemical means. This derepressive effect of LiCl does not involve resumption of cell division. Unlike its efficient derepressive effect in mitotically arrested cells, LiCl alleviates inefficiently the repression of TOP mRNAs in amino acid-deprived cells and has no effect in lymphoblastoids whose TOP mRNAs are constitutively repressed even when they are proliferating. LiCl is widely used as a relatively selective inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase-3. However, inhibition per se of this enzyme by more specific drugs failed to derepress the translation of TOP mRNAs, implying that relief of the translational repression of TOP mRNAs by LiCl is carried out in a glycogen synthase kinase-3-independent manner. Moreover, this effect is apparent, at least in some cell lines, in the absence of S6-kinase 1 activation and ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation, thus further supporting the notion that translational control of TOP mRNAs does not rely on either of these variables.

The translation of these mRNAs is selectively repressed when proliferation of vertebrate cells is blocked by a wide variety of treatments or when the cells are amino acid-starved (2Hornstein E.

The shift of TOP mRNAs from polysomes into messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (subpolysomal fraction) under such circumstances clearly indicates that the translational repression results from a blockage at the translational initiation step (3Meyuhas O. Hornstein E. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 671-693Google Scholar).

Thus, recruitment of TOP mRNAs into polysomes by serum- or amino acid-refeeding can be abolished by pharmacological blocking of PI3-kinase with LY294002 as well as by overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of PI3-kinase or of its effectors, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 and PKB (4Tang H.

PKB has been implicated through bioinformatic genetic and biochemical approaches in the phosphorylation of multiple cytoplasmic and nuclear substrates (8Lawlor M.A. Alessi D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One attractive substrate is GSK-3, which plays a key role in numerous signaling pathways involving various cellular processes ranging from glycogen and protein synthesis to cell cycle regulation and differentiation (9Doble B.W. Woodgett J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar). GSK-3 appears in two closely related isoforms, GSK-3α and GSK-3β, which are ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues (10Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2431-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). However, their activity is repressed when phosphorylated by PKB or upon LiCl treatment (for review see Ref. 11Cohen P. Frame S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). For decades, lithium salts have provided effective pharmacotherapy for bipolar disorder yet the underlying mechanism is still unknown (Ref. 12Phiel C.J. Klein P.S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 789-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar and references therein). Lithium has been shown to be a direct and reversible inhibitor of GSK-3 (13Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar) by acting as a competitive inhibitor of Mg2+ (14Ryves W.J. Harwood A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) and by inducing the inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK-3 on either serine 21 of GSK-3α or serine 9 of GSK-3β (15Zhang F. Phiel C.J. Spece L. Gurvich N. Klein P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33067-33077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In addition, lithium has been shown to inhibit other targets including inositol monophosphatase, other structurally related phosphomonoesterases, phosphoglucomutase, and possibly other enzymes (Ref. 12Phiel C.J. Klein P.S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 789-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar and references therein). Potent and more selective low molecular weight organic GSK-3 inhibitors have recently been developed in attempts to specifically interfere in cellular processes regulated by these enzymes (16Coghlan M.P.

The temporal relationship between the translational activation of TOP mRNAs as well as S6K activation and the phosphorylation of its substrate, rpS6, led to a model that proposed a causal relationship between these variables (18Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 695-717Google Scholar). However, using a wide variety of genetic manipulations and biochemical approaches, it has recently been shown that neither the activation of S6K nor rpS6 phosphorylation is necessary for translational activation of TOP mRNAs upon mitogenic, growth, or nutritional stimuli (4Tang H. Hornstein E. Stolovich M. Levy G. Livingstone M. Templeton D.J. Avruch J. Meyuhas O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8671-8683Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 5Stolovich M. Tang H.

Here we show that LiCl can alleviate the translational repression of TOP mRNAs when cells are withdrawn from the cell cycle at various phases. This effect of LiCl does not involve resumption of cell division, activation of S6K, or phosphorylation of rpS6 and does not rely on inhibition of GSK-3. In contrast, translational repression elicited by amino acid deprivation is partially resistant to LiCl treatment, whereas that observed in dividing lymphoblastoids is completely resistant. Cell Culture and DNA Transfection—HEK 293 cells were grown and transfected as well as starved for serum or amino acids as described previously (4Tang H. Hornstein E. Stolovich M. Levy G.

The proliferation of contact-inhibited cells was quantified by the methylene blue-staining protocol (22Oliver M.H. Harrison N.K. Bishop J.E. Cole P.J. Laurent G.J. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 92: 513-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa 229 cells were grown as monolayer as described previously (6Avni D. Biberman Y. Meyuhas O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and arrested by a 24-h treatment with 15 μm nocodazole (Sigma). WHI1660, a human lymphoblastoid cell line, was grown and manipulated as described previously (5Stolovich M. Tang H. Hornstein E. Levy G. Cohen R. Bae S.S. Birnbaum M.J. Meyuhas O. Mol. Cell.

CHIR 98014 and CHIR 99021 (Chiron) were added at 0.55 and 3.8 μm, respectively (5-fold their respective EC50 values) (17Ring D.B. Johnson K.W. Henriksen E.J. Nuss J.M. Goff D. Kinnick T.R. Ma S.T.

The isolated fragment probes used in the Northern blot analysis were a 0.97-kb fragment bearing the rpL32 processed gene 4A (23Chung S. Perry R.P. Mol. Cell.

Anti-phospho rpS6 (Ser240/244), anti-phospho-GSK-3β (Ser9), and anti-phospho-S6K1 (Thr389) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. The preparation and the specificity of the antibodies against rpS6 and its phosphorylated derivatives have been described previously (4Tang H. Hornstein E. Stolovich M. Levy G. Livingstone M. Templeton D.J. Avruch J. Meyuhas O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8671-8683Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-rpS6 antibody was raised against a peptide corresponding to non-phosphorylatable residues 185–205 of mouse rpS6 (LQHKRRRIALKKQRTKKNKEE) and was kindly provided by Cell Signaling Technology. Monoclonal anti-β-catenin was from BD Transduction Laboratories. AT180 (Pierce Endogen) is a monoclonal antibody that recognizes tau when it is phosphorylated at Thr231 (Ref. 26Cho J.H. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar and references therein). Tau-5 is a phosphorylation-independent tau antibody (Ref. 26Cho J.H. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar and references therein). LiCl Relieves the Translational Repression of TOP mRNAs in Cells Arrested at Various Phases of the Cell Cycle—The identification of the PKB as a crucial mediator along the pathway transducing serum signals into translational efficiency of TOP mRNAs has prompted us to look for its effector. One such candidate is GSK-3, which exerts an inhibitory effect on the synthesis of both glycogen and proteins when unphosphorylated (27Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). Its activity is repressed when phosphorylated by PKB or upon LiCl treatment, and thereby its inhibitory effect is abolished (11Cohen P. Frame S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). Therefore, we set out to examine whether LiCl can relieve the translational repression of TOP mRNAs in quiescent cells. First, we applied LiCl (20 mm) to HEK 293 cells that were arrested at G0 by 40 h of serum starvation. Inhibition of GSK-3β by LiCl is associated with the phosphorylation of Ser9 as can be judged by the gradual enhancement of the phosphorylation upon treatment of serum-starved HEK 293 cells with increasing concentrations of LiCl (Fig. 1a) (15Zhang F. Phiel C.J. Spece L. Gurvich N. Klein P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33067-33077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 28Wang X. Janmaat M. Beugnet A. Paulin F.E. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Concomitantly, treatment of these cells with 1 mm LiCl for the last 18 h of starvation was sufficient to elevate polysomal association of rpL32 mRNA, whereas 20 mm LiCl elicited derepression of rpL32 mRNA nearly as efficiently as that elicited by serum refeeding (Fig. 1, b and c). Similarly, the efficient translation of TOP mRNAs could be rescued by LiCl (60 mm) treatment of NIH 3T3 cells withdrawn from the cell cycle by contact inhibition (arrested at G0) (Fig. 2a). The specificity of the effect of the lithium ion is exemplified by the failure of 60 mm KCl to relieve the translational repression in contact-inhibited cell (data not shown). Furthermore, LiCl exerts its effect in these cells without inducing mitogenic activity as demonstrated in Fig. 2b. We were intrigued by the question of whether the capacity of LiCl to rescue the translation efficiency of TOP mRNAs is confined to cells arrested at G0 or whether LiCl functions similarly when cells are blocked at other phases of the cell cycle. To address this issue directly, we arrested NIH 3T3 cells at G1/S phase by applying hydroxyurea, which inhibits ribonucleotide reductase and thereby DNA synthesis (29Hatse S. De Clercq E. Balzarini J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 539-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Likewise, we blocked HeLa cells at G2/M phase by nocodazole treatment, which inhibits the polymerization of microtubules and thereby the assembly of the mitotic spindle (30De Brabander M.J. Van de Veire R.M. Aerts F.E. Borgers M. Janssen P.A. Cancer Res. 1976; 36: 905-916PubMed Google Scholar). Both these treatments led to selective translational repression of rpL32 mRNA as demonstrated by its unloading from polysomes, yet this repression could be relieved by LiCl (Fig. 2, a and c). Therefore, it appears that LiCl can rescue the translation of TOP mRNAs in resting cells, regardless of the cell type, the means used for mitotic arrest, and the phase along the cell cycle at which the block was set. It has been shown previously that serum replenishment leads to inhibition of GSK-3β as judged by phosphorylation of Ser9 (28Wang X. Janmaat M. Beugnet A. Paulin F.E. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 31Sithanandam G. Smith G.T. Masuda A. Takahashi T. Anderson L.M. Fornwald L.W. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 1581-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, our results clearly demonstrate indistinguishable levels of phosphorylation of these sites in untreated or serum-starved HEK 293 cells as well as in untreated NIH 3T3 and HeLa cells and their mitotically arrested counterparts (Fig. 3). These results might reflect the fact that GSK-3β is not significantly activated when these cells cease to proliferate, and consequently, the apparent translational repression does not result from GSK-3 activation. Alternatively, GSK-3β is activated upon mitotic arrest in a Ser9 phosphorylation-independent fashion and thus still may be involved in translational repression of TOP mRNAs. Inhibition of GSK-3 Is Not Sufficient to Relieve the Translational Repression of TOP mRNAs in Quiescent Cells—P1798 mouse lymphosarcoma cells can be arrested at G0 by dexamethasone treatment, and even though serum was available, this block led to selective translational repression of TOP mRNAs (Fig. 4) (32Meyuhas O. Thompson A.E. Perry R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2691-2699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Withdrawal of the hormone induced the translation of TOP mRNAs in a PI3-kinase-dependent manner as demonstrated by the ability of LY294002 (a PI3-kinase inhibitor) to completely suppress the translational activation of TOP mRNAs (Fig. 4). In contrast, LiCl could completely rescue TOP mRNAs from repression by dexamethasone when both these reagents were added together (compare the polysomal association of rpL32 mRNA in dexamethasone-treated cells with or without LiCl to that in hormonally withdrawn cells in Fig. 4). Interestingly, unlike the treatments leading to mitotic arrest in HEK 293, NIH 3T3, and HeLa cells, dexamethasone treatment by itself was able to enhance, at least partially, the phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser9 (Fig. 3). Conceivably, if inhibition of GSK-3 is indeed necessary for derepression of TOP mRNAs, this enzyme remained sufficiently active in dexamethasone-treated P1798 cells. Alternatively, inactivation of GSK-3 plays no role in the relief of the translational repression of TOP mRNAs. To further examine these two possibilities, we selected newly developed aminopyrimidine derivatives, CHIR 98014 and CHIR 99021, that potently and specifically inhibit GSK-3 (17Ring D.B. Johnson K.W. Henriksen E.J. Nuss J.M. Goff D. Kinnick T.R. Ma S.T. Reeder J.W. Samuels I. Slabiak T. Wagman A.S. Hammond M.E. Harrison S.D. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying their inhibitory effect does not involve significant phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser9 (Fig. 5, a and c). Hence, to ascertain their capacity to inhibit this enzyme, we employed an indirect assay of GSK-3 activity based on the apparent accumulation of cytoplasmic β-catenin protein in response to inactivation of GSK-3 (Ref. 15Zhang F. Phiel C.J. Spece L. Gurvich N. Klein P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33067-33077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar and references therein). GSK-3 was indeed active in dexamethasone-treated P1798 cells (β-catenin level was very low). However, when these cells were cotreated with CHIR 98014 for 24 h or with CHIR 99021 for 8 or 24 h, their GSK-3 was inactivated as judged by the robust accumulation of β-catenin (Fig. 5a). Nevertheless, this inhibition of GSK-3 failed to alleviate the translational repression of rpL32 mRNA, even though 3 h of hormonal withdrawal was sufficient for efficient recruitment of this mRNA into polysomes (Fig. 5b). The failure of the two examined aminopyrimidine derivatives to relieve the translational repression of rpL32 mRNAs in P1798 cells might reflect an exceptional behavior of this cell type or that of the readout of the assay for GSK-3 activity. To address this issue directly, we also examined the effect of CHIR 99021 in HEK 293 cells. First, we set out to examine whether CHIR 99021 can inhibit GSK-3 in these cells. We took advantage of the fact that GSK-3 is known to phosphorylate the neuronal protein tau at Thr231 (26Cho J.H. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Hence, HEK 293 cells were cotransfected with tau and GSK-3β expression vectors. Fig. 5c shows that CHIR 99021 inhibited tau phosphorylation as efficiently as LiCl. We next demonstrated that CHIR 99021 failed to derepress the translation of rpL32 mRNA in serum-starved cells (Fig. 5d), unlike the apparent ability of LiCl to exert such an effect under similar conditions (Fig. 1a). Taken together, our results clearly show that translational activation of TOP mRNAs by LiCl cannot be attributed to the inhibition of GSK-3, regardless of the nature of the examined cell line, the means used for mitotic arrest, or the assay applied for monitoring GSK-3 activity. LiCl Can Only Partially Rescue the Translation of TOP mRNAs in Amino Acid-starved Cells—The apparent ability of LiCl to alleviate the translational repression of TOP mRNAs in mitotically arrested cells and the fact that amino acids can transiently inactivate GSK-3 (33Peyrollier K. Hajduch E. Blair A. Hyde R. Hundal H. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 34Armstrong J.L. Bonavaud S.M. Toole B.J. Yeaman S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 952-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) prompted us to extend this study to amino acid-starved cells. rpL32 mRNA is translationally repressed by 2 h of amino acid starvation (Fig. 6a). LiCl treatment starting 16 h before deprivation of amino acids inefficiently derepressed the translation of rpL32 mRNA, as most of this mRNA still remained translationally inactive (only 47% in the polysomal fraction). Conversely, refeeding for just 0.5 h led to efficient recruitment of rpL32 mRNA into polysomes (77% in the polysomal fraction). Notably, LiCl efficiently elicited the phosphorylation of GSK-3β on Ser9 (Fig. 6b), indicating that cells did respond to LiCl treatment. Therefore, we have concluded that amino acid starvation represses the translation of TOP mRNAs through a pathway(s), which differs from that utilized by mitotic blockers, because it is only partially LiCl-sensitive. LiCl Failed to Derepress the Translation of TOP mRNAs in Dividing Lymphoblastoids—We have previously shown that the translation of a wide variety of TOP mRNAs is constitutively repressed in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human lymphoblastoids, even when proliferating (5Stolovich M. Tang H. Hornstein E. Levy G. Cohen R. Bae S.S. Birnbaum M.J. Meyuhas O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8101-8113Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 6Avni D. Biberman Y. Meyuhas O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 7Avni D. Shama S. Loreni F. Meyuhas O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3822-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Hence, we set out to examine whether LiCl can alleviate this repression in one such cell line (WHI 1660). Fig. 7A shows that LiCl exerted its typical inhibitory effect on GSK-3β (inducing phosphorylation at Ser9). Nonetheless, the translation of rpL32 mRNA remained repressed when these cells were LiCl-treated for 24 h at concentrations ranging from 20 (Fig. 6b) to 80 mm (data not shown). These results suggest that the apparent translational repression of TOP mRNAs in lymphoblastoids functions constitutively in a LiCl-resistant manner. LiCl Can Relieve the Translational Repression of TOP mRNAs in the Absence of S6K1 Activation or rpS6 Phosphorylation—It has previously been argued that the translation of TOP mRNAs in serum-stimulated cells is induced through activation of S6K1 and phosphorylation of rpS6 (18Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 695-717Google Scholar). Hence, we set out to verify whether either or both of these variables mediate the effect of LiCl. Fig. 3 shows that mitotic arrest of HEK 293 and P1798 cells (at G0), of NIH 3T3 cells (at G1/S), and of HeLa cells (at G2/M) is associated with inactivation of S6K1. This is exemplified by the dephosphorylation of Thr389, a critical site for its activity (35Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Han J.W. Williamson N.A. Kozma S.C. Wettenhall R.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5279-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), and of its substrate rpS6 (see the phosphorylation status of Ser240 and Ser244 in Fig. 3). However, LiCl, which very potently rescued the translation of TOP mRNAs in similarly treated cells, failed to activate S6K1 or to induce rpS6 phosphorylation in serum-starved HEK 293 or dexamethasone-treated P1798 cells (Fig. 3). Clearly, the apparent lack of effect of LiCl on the phosphorylation of either of these proteins does not reflect a technical problem because LiCl induced the phosphorylation of Ser9 in GSK-3β. However, it should be noted that LiCl partially induced S6K1 activation and rpS6 phosphorylation in hydroxyurea-treated NIH 3T3 cells and nocodazole-treated HeLa cells (Fig. 3) yet the physiological significance of this cell type-specific effect is not clear. Taken together, these data suggest that LiCl can relieve the translational repression of TOP mRNAs in an S6K1 and rpS6 phosphorylation-independent fashion, at least in some cell types. The data presented in this study suggest that inhibitory signals stemming from various blocks along the cell cycle converge into a pathway that leads to repression of TOP mRNA translation. Currently available information regarding the effect of the various mitotic inhibitory treatments used in this study on known signal transduction pathways is quite fragmentary or missing completely. Nevertheless, a tentative model depicting a pathway conveying signals from the mitogenic blocks to the translational repressor (denoted as Y) is presented in Fig. 8. The existence of a putative repressor has previously been inferred from circumstantial evidence (for review see Ref. 1Meyuhas O. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6321-6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). According to the proposed model, LiCl inhibits the activation of the repressor by blocking an upstream activator (denoted as X in Fig. 8). In contrast, amino acid starvation activates the repressor via a different mechanism, which is only partially lithium-sensitive (Fig. 6). This differential regulation of TOP mRNAs translation is further supported by a recent report, demonstrating that deprivation of both amino acids and serum has an additive repressive effect on the translation efficiency of TOP mRNAs (36Caldarola S. Amaldi F. Proud C.G. Loreni F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13522-13531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Likewise, the constitutively repressed translation of TOP mRNAs in Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized lymphoblastoids is resistant to LiCl treatment, implying a different mechanism. We reasoned that GSK-3 is an attractive kinase to comprise the putative activator X in the tentative model. This was based on the following observations. (a) GSK-3 is a direct target of PKB, a critical component in the pathway transducing mitogenic signals into translational efficiency of TOP mRNAs (4Tang H. Hornstein E. Stolovich M. Levy G. Livingstone M. Templeton D.J. Avruch J. Meyuhas O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8671-8683Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 5Stolovich M. Tang H. Hornstein E. Levy G. Cohen R. Bae S.S. Birnbaum M.J. Meyuhas O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8101-8113Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). (b) Several of the established GSK-3 targets are active in the cytoplasm (9Doble B.W. Woodgett J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar). (c) GSK-3 has already been implicated in the regulation of protein synthesis through phosphorylation of eIF2B (37Welsh G.I. Miller C.M. Loughlin A.J. Price N.T. Proud C.G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have shown here that LiCl, a GSK-3 inhibitor, can relieve the translational repression of TOP mRNAs in mitotically arrested cells. Nevertheless, we also have demonstrated that translational repression of TOP mRNAs occurred despite inhibition of GSK-3 by CHIR 98014 or CHIR 99021 treatment of P1798 and HEK 293 cells (Fig. 5) or when proliferating lymphoblastoids were treated by lithium (Fig. 7). These two observations appear to be inconsistent with GSK-3 being an activator of translational repression of TOP mRNAs as initially hypothesized. However, it should be noted that overexpression of a constitutively active mutant of GSK-3β (GSK-3β S9A) (38Stambolic V. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) in mitotically induced (serum-refed) HEK 293 cells fully suppressed the translational activation of a chimeric TOP mRNA but had no inhibitory effect on a non-TOP chimeric mRNA. 2M. Stolovich and O. Meyuhas, unpublished results. Formally, we cannot exclude the possibility that translational activation of TOP mRNAs requires down-regulation of GSK-3. Nonetheless, in light of the other data presented in this report, it is conceivable that the apparent inhibitory effect of the constitutively active mutant simply reflects physiologically irrelevant high activity of GSK-3β obtained by its overexpression. Thus, it is possible that non-physiological substrates that are only fortuitously phosphorylated by endogenous GSK-3β were significantly phosphorylated to the extent that one or more of them affected the translational efficiency of TOP mRNAs. It should be mentioned that previously reported results derived from overexpression of various active and dominant negative kinases have been subjected to controversial interpretations (20Pende M. Um S.H. Mieulet V. Sticker M. Goss V.L. Mestan J. Mueller M. Fumagalli S. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3112-31124Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 39Lange-Carter C.A.

Thomas G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3693-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). An apparent correlation under some physiological circumstances between S6K activation and rpS6 phosphorylation on one hand and translational up-regulation of TOP mRNAs on the other hand has led to the assumption of a cause and effect relationship (18Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 695-717Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated that LiCl can alleviate the translational repression of TOP mRNAs in HEK 293 and P1798 cells, even though S6K remains inactive and rpS6 is unphosphorylated in these cells (Figs. 1, 3, and 4). Therefore, these results contradict the prevailing dogma but are consistent with multiple other observations. (a) Hyperphosphorylation of rpS6 by overexpression of RSK2 (a non-physiological S6 kinase) or inhibition of rpS6 phosphatase by calyculin A failed to relieve the translational repression of TOP mRNAs in amino acid-starved cells (4Tang H. Hornstein E. Stolovich M. Levy G. Livingstone M. Templeton D.J. Avruch J. Meyuhas O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8671-8683Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). (b) The translation of TOP mRNAs is constitutively repressed in dividing lymphoblastoids, even though their S6K1 is active and rpS6 is phosphorylated (Fig. 6) (5Stolovich M. Tang H. Hornstein E.

Biol. 1994; 14: 3822-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). (c) TOP mRNAs are translationally activated by serum refeeding or amino acid replenishment in S6K–/– ES cells (4Tang H. Hornstein E. Stolovich M. Levy G. Livingstone M. Templeton D.J. Avruch J. Meyuhas O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8671-8683Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 5Stolovich M. Tang H.

Stratton C.A. Parrott L. Myerson H. Meyuhas O. Templeton D.J. Landreth G.E. Hensold J.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1919-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), even though their rpS6 is constitutively unphosphorylated or dephosphorylated, respectively, indicating that rpS6 phosphorylation is not necessary for efficient translation of TOP mRNAs. (d) Mistargeting of upstream signals by overexpression of a kinase-dead S6K1 mutant completely abolished any S6K activity without a concomitant inhibitory effect on translation of TOP mRNAs (4Tang H. Hornstein E. Stolovich M. Levy G. Livingstone M. Templeton D.J. Avruch J. Meyuhas O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8671-8683Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). (e) Rapamycin, a specific mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, completely blocks S6K activity and rpS6 phosphorylation, yet it exerts only a minor or no repressive effect on the translational activation of TOP mRNAs in several cell lines (Ref. 5Stolovich M. Tang H. Hornstein E. Levy G. Cohen R. Bae S.S. Birnbaum M.J. Meyuhas O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8101-8113Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar and references therein). (f) The translation of TOP mRNAs is normally controlled in mouse cells derived from double knock-out mice lacking both S6K1 and S6K2 (20Pende M. Um S.H. Mieulet V. Sticker M. Goss V.L. Mestan J. Mueller M. Fumagalli S. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3112-31124Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Finally, lithium has been used to treat bipolar disorder for more than five decades and, in addition, it also exhibits neuroprotective qualities (Ref. 48Agam G. Shaltiel G. Prog. Neuropsychopharmacol. Biol. Psychiatry. 2003; 27: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar and 49Wood N.I. Morton A.J. Brain Res. Bull. 2003; 61: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar and references therein). Despite its clinical usefulness and multiple identified sites of action, the precise mechanism by which lithium exerts its beneficial effect is still unknown. The data presented in this study have extended the list of LiCl targets to include induced synthesis of the translational apparatus through activation of the translation of TOP mRNAs. Nevertheless, this activation cannot account for the neuroprotective or therapeutic properties of lithium because the concentration of LiCl that is required for efficient translational activation of TOP mRNAs is ∼15–40-fold higher than the upper limits of the serum concentration (1.5 mm) allowed in treated patients (www.mentalhealth.com/drug/p30-l02.html) (50Hymen S.E.

https://openalex.org/W2164811390,"The plant immune system relies to a great extent on the highly regulated expression of hundreds of defense genes encoding antimicrobial proteins, such as defensins, and antiherbivore proteins, such as lectins. The expression of many of these genes is controlled by a family of mediators known as jasmonates; these cyclic oxygenated fatty acid derivatives are reminiscent of prostaglandins. The roles of jasmonates also extend to the control of reproductive development. How are these complex events regulated? Nearly 20 members of the jasmonate family have been characterized. Some, like jasmonic acid, exist in unmodified forms, whereas others are conjugated to other lipids or to hydrophobic amino acids. Why do so many chemically different forms of these mediators exist, and do individual jasmonates have unique signaling properties or are they made to facilitate transport within and between cells? Key features of the jasmonate signal pathway have been identified and include the specific activation of E3-type ubiquitin ligases thought to target as-yet-undescribed transcriptional repressors for modification or destruction. Several classes of transcription factor are known to function in the jasmonate pathway, and, in some cases, these proteins provide nodes that integrate this network with other important defensive and developmental pathways. Progress in jasmonate research is now rapid, but large gaps in our knowledge exist. Aimed to keep pace with progress, the ensemble of jasmonate Connections Maps at the Signal Transduction Knowledge Environment describe (i) the canonical signaling pathway, (ii) the Arabidopsis signaling pathway, and (iii) the biogenesis and structures of the jasmonates themselves."

https://openalex.org/W1998099484,"Several protein domains acting through seemingly different mechanisms have been reported to have the capacity to target proteins to dense core secretory granules. Because proteins enter secretory granules with different efficiencies and because some of these proteins contain more than one granule-targeting motif, we have investigated whether compounding sorting signals could alter the efficiency of protein entry into secretory granules. In the current study we demonstrate that a paired basic cleavage site from human prorenin and an α-helix-containing secretory granule-sorting signal from the prohormone convertase PC1/3 can synergize to increase granule-sorting efficiency not only when located on the same protein, but also when located on distinct proteins that associate in the secretory pathway.

Once proteins in the secretory pathway arrive in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) 1The abbreviations used are: TGN, trans-Golgi network; HA, hemagglutinin; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PC, prohormone convertase. they must be sorted to their appropriate cellular destination. Although certain proteins (e.g. cathepsin B) are sorted to lysosomes, other proteins are recycled into earlier secretory compartments by recognition of a retention signal (e.g. KDEL for the endoplasmic reticulum). Still other proteins are secreted constitutively from the cell at a rate that is only limited by their rate of synthesis. This pathway, called the constitutive secretory pathway, is thought to be the default pathway for proteins that do not contain a specific sorting or retention signal. Finally, certain endocrine and neuroendocrine cells send a specific subset of proteins to electron-dense cytoplasmic granules (dense core secretory granules) where they are stored until the cell receives a signal for their release. This process, called regulated secretion, depends on a highly selective triage of proteins within or just after the TGN. Retention in dense core secretory granules is not a random process and granule-sorted proteins must possess unique properties or must interact with other cellular components in a unique way to end up in this organelle (1Chung K.N.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10445-10455Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Several protein domains have been identified that have the capacity to sort cargo proteins to dense core secretory granules. The function of these domains can be grossly subdivided into three groups. First, aggregation appears to be a common property of many granule-targeted cargo proteins as evidenced by their ability to form electron-dense cores (reviewed in Ref. 8Dannies P.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 177: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A direct correlation between the ability to aggregate in vitro and to be sorted to secretory granules in transfected cells has been established for chromogranin A (9Jain R.K. Chang W.T. Geetha C. Joyce P.B. Gorr S.U. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and rat pro-atrial natriuretic factor (10Canaff L. Brechler V. Reudelhuber T.L. Thibault G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9483-9487Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Indeed, expression of a variety of granule cargo proteins including chromogranin A (11Kim T. Tao-Cheng J.H. Eiden L.E. Loh Y.P. Cell. 2001; 106: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 12Beuret N. Stettler H. Renold A. Rutishauser J. Spiess M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 20242-20249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) is sufficient to induce aggregate-containing cytoplasmic vesicles, although these vesicles do not have all of the characteristics of secretory granules (12Beuret N. Stettler H. Renold A. Rutishauser J. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20242-20249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Proinsulin, proopiomelanocortin, and engineered proteins containing the C-terminal tail of PC1/3 also form multimers; however, this property alone is insufficient to direct granule sorting (3Jutras I. Seidah N.G. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40337-40343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 13Quinn D. Orci L. Ravazzola M. Moore H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A second group of granule-sorting domains may act by anchoring cargo proteins to other granule-resident proteins including carboxypeptidase E (2Cool D.R. Normant E. Shen F. Chen H.C. Pannell L. Zhang Y. Loh Y.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) and (14Brechler V. Chu W.N. Baxter J.D. Thibault G. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20636-20640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Finally, granule-sorting domains in some granule-resident proteins such as PC1/3 (3Jutras I. Seidah N.G. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40337-40343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 7Arnaoutova I. Smith A.M. Coates L.C. Sharpe J.C. Dhanvantari S.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) bind to membranes raising the possibility that specific lipids in the TGN act to either sequester or retain such proteins in nascent granules. The existence of multiple sorting domains has almost certainly contributed to the historical difficulty in assigning a canonical sorting signal for granule cargo proteins. The efficiency with which proteins enter secretory granules can also vary significantly. For example, in the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney it has been estimated that only 25-30% of prorenin is sorted to secretory granules where it is converted to active renin (15Pratt R.E. Carleton J.E. Richie J.P. Heusser C. Dzau V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7837-7840Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This inefficient sorting is in large part responsible for the fact that circulating levels of prorenin are 5-10 times higher than those of active renin in humans (16Toffelmire E.B. Slater K. Corvol P. Menard J. Schambelan M. J. Clin. Investig. 1989; 83: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Conversely, proinsulin is targeted almost quantitatively to secretory granules (17Rhodes C.J. Halban P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) where a high percentage is converted to active insulin. As a result, mature insulin levels are roughly five times higher than those of proinsulin in circulation in normoglycemic humans (18Hojlund K. Wildner-Christensen M. Eshoj O. Skjaerbaek C. Holst J.J. Koldkjaer O. Moller J.D. Beck-Nielsen H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: E50-E58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the proteolytic activation of many of these precursors only occurs after their entry in secretory granules (19Orci L. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Madsen O. Perrelet A. Vassalli J.D. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2273-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 20Schmidt W.K. Moore H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1271-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 21Taugner R. Kim S.J. Murakami K. Waldherr R. Histochemistry. 1987; 86: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), modulation of the granule-sorting efficiency could represent a key step of evolutionary selection in controlling animal physiology. Although some of the variation in sorting efficiency could be due to differences in the internal machinery of the cell types expressing these proproteins, they could also conceivably be due to the exposure, multiplicity, and the particular combination of sorting signals present on the sorted precursor proteins. In the current study we have tested the latter hypothesis and demonstrate that unique secretory granule-sorting signals can be compounded both in cis and in trans to modulate the efficiency of protein targeting to dense core secretory granules. Recombinant Plasmid Construction—Naturally occurring peptide fragments to be analyzed for secretory granule sorting were derived from the mouse PC1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_013628) and the human prorenin cDNAs (GenBank™ accession number NM_000537). The numbering used to identify the protein domains used is relative to initiator methionine of both proteins. Protein fragments were tested for their ability to sort heterologous proteins to secretory granules by attachment to a fragment of mouse immunoglobulin IgG2b (referred to as Fc) as described previously ((3Jutras I. Seidah N.G. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40337-40343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and illustrated in Fig. 1). Fusion proteins were constructed by selective amplification of corresponding fragments using polymerase chain reaction. For co-targeting studies (Fig. 3), a peptide encoding the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (YPYDVPDYA) was inserted between the signal peptide and the 16-amino acid human prorenin prosegment by overlap extension PCR. All of the resulting coding sequences were verified in their entirety by DNA sequencing and were inserted into the pCDNA3 mammalian expression vector.Fig. 3A, schematic diagram of the fusion proteins used to transfect GH4C1 cells. The HA peptide (YPYDVPDYA) is inserted between the signal peptide and dibasic cleavage site-containing prosegment. B, double labeling of transfected cells with antibody for endogenous growth hormone (contained in dense core granules at the cell periphery) and the HA peptide (detects only HA:Pro:Fc). The merged image shows areas stained by both markers in yellow superimposed on a Nomarski view of the cells. Note that when co-transfected with the fusion protein containing a granule targeting domain from the PC1 C terminus (PC1 C-term), the HA-tagged fusion protein shifts from a predominantly TGN labeling pattern to one that includes both the TGN and the cell periphery where growth hormone-containing dense core secretory granules (G) are stored.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cell Culture, Transfection, and Secretion Analysis—Rat somatotrophic GH4C1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 0.01% gentamicin (Invitrogen), and 0.1% SerXtend (Irvine Scientific, Santa Anna, CA) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in 5% CO2. 24 h before transfection, cells were replated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well in 6-well dishes. For each well, 1 μg of the appropriate expression plasmid was combined with 150 μl of EC reagent, 8 μl of enhancer, and 10 μl of Effectene (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The transfection mixture was added dropwise to the cells in 600 μl of fresh culture medium and was left on the cells for 24 h. After 24 h, the medium was changed, and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. For metabolic labeling, transfected cells were depleted of methionine for 90 min by incubation in methionine-free Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and labeled by addition of 300 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine per well (Tran35S-label, MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) for an additional 2 h. The labeling medium was then replaced with prewarmed complete medium for 90 min (chase). To test for regulated secretion the cells were sequentially incubated for 20 min in medium containing 50 mm NaCl (basal or constitutive secretion) after which the medium was replaced, and the cells were incubated for a further 20 min in medium containing 50 mm KCl (stimulation of granule release or regulated secretion). Culture supernatants were then immunoprecipitated with protein A-Sepharose (Sigma), and the immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The gels were incubated with three changes of 10% 2,5-diphenyloxazole in dimethyl sulfoxide, rinsed in water, dried, and subjected to fluorography. Dried gels were subsequently exposed to storage phosphor screens (Amersham Biosciences), and emissions were quantified using an Amersham Biosciences Storm PhosphorImager. Results were compared by one-way ANOVA using Dunnett's post-test and are expressed in Fig. 1C as mean ± S.E. Immunocytochemistry—GH4C1 cells transiently transfected with the appropriate expression vector were seeded onto Lab Tek glass chambers (Nalgene Nunc, Napierville, Il) at a density of 75,000 cells/chamber. 24 h later the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 10 min at room temperature, rinsed in TBS, and permeabilized with absolute methanol at -20 °C for 10 min. Nonspecific binding was blocked for 30 min with 5% nonfat milk in TBS at 4 °C for 1 h. Slides were incubated with a monoclonal rat anti-HA antibody conjugated to fluorescein (1:200, Roche Applied Science) overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer. The next day, slides were washed with TBS and incubated with a polyclonal rabbit anti-growth hormone antibody (1:40) (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) for 30 min at 37 °C. Slides were then washed with TBS and incubated anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to rhodamine (Chemicon) (1:100) for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were rinsed in TBS, mounted using the SlowFade light antifade kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and visualized using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Protein Cross-linking Assay—GH4C1 cells transiently transfected with the appropriate expression vectors were pulse-labeled with 300 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Tran35S-label, MP Biomedicals) for 30 min. The labeling medium was then replaced with prewarmed complete medium for 30 min at 20 °C to block cellular secretion at the level of the Golgi. Cells were then washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 0.25 mm of disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce) for 30 min at room temperature. Cross-linking was stopped with 1 m Tris (pH 7.5), and cells were lysed with a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% deoxycholate. Cells were scraped off the culture dishes with a rubber policeman, and lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000 rpm. Fc-containing proteins in the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with protein A-Sepharose, separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by fluorography as described under “Cell Culture, Transfection, and Secretion Analysis.” Synergy between Compounded Sorting Domains—Rat somatomammotrophic GH4C1 cells were transfected with a series of plasmid expression vectors in which a fragment of the mouse immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region (Fc) is linked to a signal peptide and combinations of two previously described secretory granule-sorting domains (Fig. 1A and B). These consist of the C-terminal tail of the prohormone convertase PC1/3 (3Jutras I. Seidah N.G. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40337-40343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and a dibasic protease cleavage site from the human prorenin prosegment (14Brechler V. Chu W.N.

As shown in Fig. 1B, all of the fusion proteins can be detected in the supernatant of the transfected cells even during the 2-h pulse labeling period (lane P), confirming that they are efficiently synthesized and secreted by the cells. Likewise, a roughly equivalent amount of the various fusion proteins is secreted from the cells during the first 90-min chase period (lane C). A second chase period in medium supplemented with 50 mm sodium (lane Na) reveals the amount of labeled protein secreted constitutively from the cells during a 20-min time window, whereas a subsequent 20-min incubation in the presence of 50 mm potassium (lane K) will cause the cells to depolarize and release secretory granule contents. Thus, the ratio of the amount of labeled fusion protein secreted in the presence of potassium versus that secreted in the presence of sodium is a reflection of amount of protein stored in secretory granules. Such an analysis (Fig. 1, B and C) reveals that only a very small amount of the Fc fusion protein containing 6 amino acids of the human prorenin prosegment (Pro6:Fc) enters granules, confirming our previous report obtained in AtT-20 cells that this region of the human prorenin prosegment is inactive in secretory granule targeting (14Brechler V. Chu W.N. Baxter J.D. Thibault G. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20636-20640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The sorting efficiency of the prorenin prosegment is increased ∼2-fold, however, when it is extended to contain paired basic residues (Pro16:Fc), constituting a weak sorting signal. Addition of the targeting region containing the PC1 C-terminal α-helical region to the C terminus of the Pro6:Fc fusion protein (Pro6:Fc: PC1) leads to a more efficient targeting of the fusion protein to granules than the paired basic residues. Strikingly, combining both the paired basic residues and the PC1 α-helical region in the fusion protein (Pro16:Fc:PC1) leads to an increase in sorting efficiency that appears to exceed the sum of the effects seen with the individual domains (Fig. 1, B and C). Loss of stimulated secretion when the same cells express an analogous protein in which the α-helix in the PC1/3 C-terminal tail is disrupted by proline substitutions (3Jutras I. Seidah N.G. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40337-40343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (Pro16:Fc:PC1PP) confirms that this synergy is due to the interaction of the α-helical element and the paired basic cleavage sites. These results suggest that independent sorting domains contained in cis on the same protein can act synergistically to increase secretory granule-sorting efficiency. Protein-Protein Association Modulates Sorting Efficiency— To determine whether protein complex formation could alter the efficiency of either protein entry or retention in secretory granules, various combinations of the fusion proteins described above were co-expressed in GH4 cells. As immunoglobulin heavy chains normally form dimers, we expected that the Fc domains of the fusion proteins would promote protein-protein interactions. As shown in Fig. 2, co-expression of the fusion proteins containing either 6 or 16 amino acids of the human prorenin prosegment did not lead to significant targeting of either protein to dense core secretory granules as evidenced by the lack of a detectable band in the potassium-stimulated supernatant (Fig. 2, lane K). Strikingly, when either of these proteins is co-expressed with the fusion protein containing the targeting sequence from the PC1 C-terminal tail, both of the prosegment-containing fusion proteins enter secretory granules with greatly increased efficiency and are secreted in response to potassium stimulation. To confirm the rerouting of the prosegment-containing fusion proteins when co-transfected, an HA epitope was inserted between the signal peptide and the human renin prosegment of Pro16:Fc (Fig. 3A), and distribution of the fusion protein was followed in transfected GH4 cells in the presence or absence of co-expressed Pro6:Fc: PC1 protein (Fig. 3B). The results show that when expressed alone, the HA-containing fusion protein is located primarily in the perinuclear Golgi apparatus and is lacking from the fraction just under the plasma membrane where growth hormone is stored in secretory granules (Fig. 3B, upper panel). In contrast, co-expression of the same protein with the fusion protein containing the PC1/3 C-terminal tail targeting motif causes a dramatic redistribution of the HA-tagged protein to the periphery of the cell where the growth hormone-containing dense core granules are located (Fig. 3B, lower panel). These results are consistent with the formation of heterodimeric protein complexes that “pull” the prorenin prosegment-containing fusion proteins into secretory granules. Formation of heterodimers between the two fusion proteins is confirmed by intracellular cross-linking experiments (Fig. 4). Although the Pro16:Fc protein shows a slight tendency to form dimers, dimerization is greatly increased when the fusion protein contains the C-terminal tail of PC1/3 (3Jutras I. Seidah N.G. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40337-40343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). When the two proteins are co-expressed, a new dimer species of intermediate molecular weight is formed, confirming the formation of heterodimers in the secretory pathway of the co-transfected cells. In conclusion, trans association of granule targeting signals by protein-protein contact is also capable of increasing protein targeting to dense core secretory granules.Fig. 4Heterodimer formation between the Fc fusion proteins. GH4C1 cells transfected with the corresponding expression vectors either alone or in combination were treated with a cell-permeable cross-linker, and the fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated from the lysates.

This molecular step plays a key role in vertebrate biology because it not only provides for physiological control over protein hormone secretion, but it also provides a measure of control over the efficiency of activation of certain protein precursors (such as proinsulin, proopiomelanocortin, prorenin, and others) that are only proteolytically processed after the precursor is sorted to the nascent granule. Despite the importance of this biological event, it has been difficult to agree on canonical secretory granule-sorting sequences most likely because of three main reasons: First, the protein domains required for secretory granule sorting might be different in different cell types. For example, the C terminus of the prohormone convertase PC2 is capable of directing sorting to secretory granules in Neuro2A cells (6Assadi M. Sharpe J.C. Snell C. Loh Y.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7798-7807Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) but is not required for PC2 sorting to granules in corticotrophic AtT-20 cells (22Taylor N.A. Jan G. Scougall K.T. Docherty K. Shennan K.I. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 21: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Likewise, chromogranin A has been reported to require an N-terminal sorting signal for granule entry in PC12 cells, whereas a C-terminal domain is required for granule sorting in GH4C1 cells (23Cowley D.J. Moore Y.R. Darling D.S. Joyce P.B. Gorr S.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7743-7748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Second, several distinct secretory granule-sorting signals have been reported suggesting that there is more than one mechanism for sorting proteins to secretory granules. These include paired basic residues that may interact with granule-resident PC enzymes (14Brechler V. Chu W.N. Baxter J.D. Thibault G. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol.

Cell. 1997; 88: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), calcium-binding domains that lead to aggregation (reviewed in Ref. 8Dannies P.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 177: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and α-helices that either traverse or interact with membranes (3Jutras I. Seidah N.G. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40337-40343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 5Dhanvantari S. Arnaoutova I. Snell C.R. Steinbach P.J. Hammond K. Caputo G.A. London E. Loh Y.P.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10445-10455Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Finally, proteins may contain more than one single type of sorting domain so that analyses in which any one of these is eradicated will not eliminate sorting in the context of the native protein. Indeed, because insulin has been shown to aggregate in nascent granules (29Orci L. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1986; 2: 71-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), form multimers (13Quinn D. Orci L. Ravazzola M. Moore H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), bind CPE (30Cool D.R. Loh Y.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 139: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and be cleaved by PC enzymes (31Steiner D.F. Rouille Y. Gong Q. Martin S. Carroll R. Chan S.J. Diabetes Metab. 1996; 22: 94-104PubMed Google Scholar), all of which have been shown to direct secretory granule targeting in various systems, it is perhaps not surprising that the eradication of hexamerization or the dibasic cleavage sites alone does not prevent its entry into secretory granules (13Quinn D. Orci L. Ravazzola M. Moore H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 32Halban P.A. Irminger J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1195-1203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is puzzling that the mechanisms for sorting proteins to other cellular destinations such as the nucleus (33Christophe D. Christophe-Hobertus C. Pichon B. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), the endoplasmic reticulum (34Gomord V. Wee E. Faye L. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 607-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and endosomes and lysosomes (35Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar) display less heterogeneity than those involved in secretory granule sorting. One possible explanation is that the heterogeneity in granule-sorting signals is the result of evolutionary selection pressure to achieve greater flexibility in modulating granule-targeting efficiencies. In support of this hypothesis proinsulin, which contains multiple sorting motifs (see above), is sorted with far greater efficiency to secretory granules than is, for example, human prorenin the secretory granule sorting of which in model cell lines is dependent on a single pair of basic amino acids (14Brechler V. Chu W.N. Baxter J.D. Thibault G. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20636-20640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The existence of multiple sorting mechanisms might also provide a greater measure of physiological control over sorting efficiency as a means of controlling active hormone production. Indeed, some pathological conditions can lead to increases or decreases in the constitutive release of proinsulin (36Hostens K. Pavlovic D. Zambre Y. Ling Z. Schravendijk VanC. Eizirik D.L. Pipeleers D.G. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and prorenin (15Pratt R.E. Carleton J.E. Richie J.P. Heusser C. Dzau V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7837-7840Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), suggesting a diversion from the regulated secretory pathway although the exact mechanisms are not yet known. In addition, our results provide evidence that partnering of proteins in higher order complexes would enhance sorting efficiency because a sorting domain on only one of the unit monomers would be sufficient to direct sorting of associated partners. The aggregation that characterizes many secretory granule cargo proteins (8Dannies P.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 177: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) could serve a similar function and thereby lead to a dramatic amplification of the primary tethering interactions between granule cargo and sorting acceptor proteins or lipids. In conclusion, we show that the efficiency of protein sorting to the regulated secretory pathway and dense core secretory granules can be modulated by combining multiple, distinct sorting signals either in cis or in trans. This phenomenon may contribute to the observed differences in sorting efficiencies of proteins destined to the regulated secretory pathway. We thank Drs. Christian Deschepper and Savita Dhanvantari for critical reading of the manuscript."

The effect of these inhibitors was markedly less significant at higher extracellular pH. Moreover, dysfunction of the mitochondrial calcium handling greatly decreased CCE sensitivity to extracellular Ca2+ when the pH of extracellular solution was 7.2 (apparent Kd toward extracellular Ca2+ rose from 2.3 ± 0.6 mm in control cells to 11.0 ± 1.7 mm in CCCP-treated cells) as compared with pH 7.8 (apparent Kd toward extracellular Ca2+ increased from 1.3 ± 0.4 mm in control cells to 2.4 ± 0.4 mm in uncoupler-treated cells). Changes in intracellular pH triggered by methylamine did not influence Ca2+ influx. This suggests that, in Jurkat cells, store-operated calcium channels sense extracellular pH change as a parameter that modifies their sensitivity to intracellular Ca2+. In contrast, in human osteosarcoma cells, changes in extracellular pH as well as mitochondrial uncoupling did not exert any inhibitory effects on CCE.

This regulatory mechanism leading to the PM calcium permeability is known as capacitative calcium entry (CCE) (1Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar, 2Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). This is the most common mechanism of Ca2+ influx, at least in cells in which inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate triggers the depletion of ER. In fact, it is universal for all types of electrically non-excitable cells and has also been postulated for some electrically excitable cells (1Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar, 3Putney J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). In some cell types, e.g. in T lymphocytes, in which ER calcium stores are relatively small and thus contribute only slightly to the overall [Ca2+]c signal, calcium influx via CCE represents the major element in the cellular calcium signaling (for review, see Ref. 4Venkatchalam K. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Ma H.-T. Gill D.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E263-E272Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Full activation of CCE may be obtained by the action of thapsigargin, a specific inhibitor of ER Ca2+-ATPase (5Thastrup O. Dawson A.P. Scharff O. Foder B. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Bjerrum P.J. Christensen S.B. Hanley M.R. Agents Actions. 1994; 43: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Ca2+ influx into mitochondria is driven by the electrical potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane (6Nichols D.G. Biochem. J. 1978; 176: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter, which is a major route of calcium entry into mitochondrial matrix, exhibits a high Kd (>10 μm) value for calcium ions, whereas the bulk [Ca2+]c varies between 100 nm in resting cells and 1 μm in cells responding to a stimulus. Because of the discovery that [Ca2+]c in a close proximity of ER or of PM calcium channels may reach higher levels than measured in the bulk phase, it has been shown that, in these cellular microdomains, mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation occurs efficiently. Thereby mitochondria may play a role in the regulation of intracellular calcium signals (7Malli R. Frieden M. Osibow K. Graier W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10807-10815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 8Rizzuto R. Brini M. Pozzan T. Science. 1993; 262: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Respiring mitochondria located in the close vicinity of ER can buffer Ca2+ released from these stores, and this may regulate the opening probability of Ca2+-sensitive ER calcium channels. Additionally, mitochondria compete with the store-loading activity of Ca2+-ATPase, counteracting the refilling of the calcium stores. This results in a more complete depletion of ER and eventually a more efficient activation of CCE (9Gilabert J.A. Bakowski D. Parekh A.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2672-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 10Gilabert J.A. Parekh A.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6401-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Mitochondria can take up Ca2+ entering cells via plasma membrane channels. This may protect CCE from a feedback inhibition exerted by the excess of calcium accumulated in the subplasma membranous space, close to the mouths of calcium channels (7Malli R. Frieden M. Osibow K. Graier W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10807-10815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 10Gilabert J.A. Parekh A.B.

Zabøocki K. Duszyński J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Moreover, not only the buffering but also the signaling roles of mitochondria in the regulation of calcium influxes have been postulated (13Glitsch M.D. Bakowski D. Parekh A.B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6744-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 14Parekh A.B. News Physiol. Sci. 2003; 18: 252-256PubMed Google Scholar). The role of mitochondria in the regulation of calcium influx into electrically non-excitable cells has been intensively investigated (7Malli R. Frieden M. Osibow K. Graier W.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 44769-44779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). It was found that a decrease of the mitochondrial membrane potential inhibits Ca2+ flux into Jurkat cells activated by depletion of intracellular calcium stores (11Hoth M. Fanger C.M. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 633-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 12Makowska A. Zabøocki K. Duszyński J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This effect was attributed to the feedback inhibition of CCE by Ca2+ entering the cell. De-energized mitochondria could not buffer the excess of calcium and protect CCE against such inhibition. Previously, we have documented that a decrease in the electrochemical potential of the mitochondrial inner membrane results in a decrease of the initial rate of calcium influx into Jurkat cells pretreated with thapsigargin and that this effect was strongly dependent on extracellular pH (16Zabøocki K. Makowska A. Duszyński J. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We have proposed that PM calcium channels in Jurkat cells could act as pH sensors, which modify their own sensitivity to intracellular Ca2+ dependently on extracellular pH. In this study, we describe further progress in the study of mitochondrially dependent CCE regulation in electrically non-excitable cells. We demonstrated that, in Jurkat cells, not only dissipation of the mitochondrial potential but also other disturbances in mitochondrial Ca2+ handling, e.g. inhibition of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, cause a decrease in the initial rate of calcium influx in an extracellular pH-dependent manner. At pH 7.2, the CCE is depressed after mitochondrial calcium buffer blocking due to a marked increase of CCE Kd for extracellular Ca2+. In contrast, in human osteosarcoma cells, changes in extracellular pH as well as mitochondrial uncoupling do not exert any inhibitory effects on Ca2+ entry. Chemicals—High glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, glutamine, and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Invitrogen. RPMI 1640 medium was from the Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy (Wrocøaw, Poland). Fura-2/AM and BCECF/AM were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Streptomycin plus penicillin for cell culture as well as thapsigargin, CCCP, oligomycin, antimycin A, and ionomycin were purchased from Sigma, and CGP 37157 was from Tocris Cookson Ltd. (Northpoint, Avonmouth, Bristol, UK). Other chemicals were of analytical grade. Cell Culture—Human lymphoblastoid (Jurkat) T cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml) plus streptomycin (50 μg/ml). Human osteosarcoma cells were grown on cover glass slides in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). All cell cultures were kept in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air at 37 °C. [Ca2+]c Measurements—The buffered saline solution (BSS) consisted of 132 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm pyruvate, and 5 mm glucose; the pH was adjusted to a desired value with NaOH. Where indicated, 0.12 μm oligomycin, 2 μm CCCP, 0.5 μg/ml antimycin A, 10 μm CGP 37157, and 100 nm thapsigargin (final concentrations) were added as Me2SO solutions. Cytosolic free Ca2+ was measured with Fura-2 (17Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The cells were loaded with this probe in the culture medium supplemented with 1 μm Fura-2/AM at 37 °C for 15 min during incubation. After washing by centrifugation (Jurkat cells) in BSS supplemented with 0.1 mm CaCl2, the cells were suspended in nominally calcium-free BSS containing 0.05 mm EGTA, instead of CaCl2, and used for experiments in which [Ca2+]c was monitored. Osteosarcoma cells were rinsed twice with the same BSS as above. The cover glasses were installed in the fluorometer cuvettes. Where indicated, the mixtures were supplemented with uncouplers or inhibitors and an appropriate amount of CaCl2. The fluorescence was measured at 30 °C in a Shimadzu RF5000 fluorometer set in the ratio mode using 340 and 380 nm as excitation wavelengths and 510 nm as the emission wavelength. The time resolution of the measurements was 1 s. The calibration in each run was performed using externally added 3 mm CaCl2 and 3 μm ionomycin or 0.003% digitonin. Initial rates of calcium entry were expressed as a tangent of the curve representing increases in [Ca2+]c, calculated immediately after the addition of CaCl2. Both types of cells treated with CCCP were preincubated with 0.12 μm oligomycin to inhibit mitochondrial ATPase and thereby to protect the cells from ATP depletion under the conditions of collapse of electric potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane by mitochondrial uncouplers. The addition of oligomycin was also required to reduce mitochondrial potential in cells preincubated with antimycin A by preventing restoration of electric potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane due to the proton-pumping function of mitochondrial ATPase. The same amount of oligomycin was added to the control samples. We have shown previously (12Makowska A. Zabøocki K. Duszyński J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) that 0.12 μm oligomycin does not interfere with [Ca2+]c transients induced by the addition of thapsigargin plus CaCl2 to Jurkat cells and that glycolytic ATP production covered the needs of the cells, even under full inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation. In cells treated with CGP 37157, no oligomycin was added. Measurements of Intracellular pH—Cytosolic pH was measured with the fluorescent probe BCECF (18Rink T.J. Tsien R.Y. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). The cells were loaded with this probe and rinsed exactly as described for Ca2+ measurements with Fura-2. The fluorescence was measured at 30 °C in a Shimadzu RF5000 fluorometer set in the ratio mode using 500 nm (for deprotonated BCECF) and 450 nm (for protonated BCECF) as excitation wavelengths and 530 nm as the emission wavelength. The probe was calibrated by titration with NaOH or HCl in the presence of 0.003% digitonin. The purpose of cytosolic pH measurement was to estimate changes in this parameter because of switching extracellular pH between 7.2 and 7.8. It was also necessary for adjustment of the amount of methylamine used for the selective enhancement of intracellular pH. Fig. 1 shows the effects of CCCP (Fig. 1A), antimycin A (Fig. 1B), and CGP 37157 (Fig. 1C) on calcium influx to Jurkat cells suspended in BSS at pH 7.2. The first part of each trace reflects [Ca2+]c response to thapsigargin; transient increase in [Ca2+]c represents calcium release from the ER followed by Ca2+ extrusion to the extracellular space. Subsequent addition of CaCl2 results in a potent increase in [Ca2+]c because of the activation of CCE. Decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential caused by the action of CCCP or antimycin A plus oligomycin as well as the inhibition of Ca2+ efflux from mitochondria produced by the inhibitor of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger CGP 37157 causes a significant reduction of the initial rates of calcium influx. On the other hand, in Jurkat cells suspended in BSS at pH 7.8, the inhibition of CCE because of disturbed mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering by CCCP, antimycin A plus oligomycin, or CGP 37157 was much less pronounced (Fig. 1, D–F). The plateau of [Ca2+]c following the addition of CaCl2 reflects a steady-state balance between two opposite processes: Ca2+ flux into the cytosol through the CCE system and Ca2+ efflux from the cells mediated by PM Ca2+-ATPase and the Ca2+/Na+ exchanger (this latter activity in Jurkat cells is rather negligible, if any) (19Bautista D.M. Hoth M. Lewis R.S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 543: 877-894Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, D–F, the mitochondrial uncouplers or inhibitors of the respiratory chain (antimycin A) or of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (CGP 37157) have only small effects on the maximal value of [Ca2+]c in cells suspended in BSS at pH 7.8. Decrease in the extracellular pH from 7.8 to pH 7.2 due to the addition of HCl shifts the equilibrium between influx and efflux to lower steady-state levels of [Ca2+]c. This results most probably from both pH-dependent inhibition of CCE (20Wakabayashi J. Groschner K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and pH-dependent stimulation of Ca2+ efflux due to increased activity of PM Ca2+-ATPase (21Carafoli E. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1997; 92: 59-61Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Grover A.K. Samson S.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: C529-C534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a decrease of the final [Ca2+]c related to the reduction of BSS alkalinity is more pronounced in the cells with disturbed mitochondrial calcium buffering (Fig. 1, D–F). In other words, intracellular calcium homeostasis appeared to be more sensitive to the pH of the extracellular milieu in the cells pretreated with the mitochondrial uncouplers or inhibitors than in control cells. Because there is no reason to suspect that such modifications in the mitochondrial status might activate PM Ca2+-ATPase, these findings clearly indicate that disturbances in mitochondrial Ca2+ handling inhibit the activity of CCE in a pH-dependent manner. Statistical evaluation of the data described above is shown in Fig. 2. Note that the absolute values of the initial rate of calcium entry into Jurkat cells suspended in BSS at pH 7.8 are significantly higher than those in cells suspended in BSS at pH 7.2.Fig. 2Statistical evaluation of the effects of CCCP, antimycin A + oligomycin, and CGP 37157 on Ca2+ entry into Jurkat cells suspended in the BSS at pH 7.2 or 7.8.

To test this possibility, the pH-dependent effect of CCCP on CCE was studied in the cells suspended in high potassium BSS (65 mm KCl and NaCl concentration lowered to 72 mm). Under such conditions, PM depolarization occurs, and this allows us to differentiate the effect of CCCP on the mitochondria from that on the PM. Despite depolarization of the PM, CCCP still much more strongly inhibited CCE in Jurkat cells suspended in BSS at pH 7.2 (from 934 ± 119 to 340 ± 40) than in BSS at pH 7.8 (from 1018 ± 136 to 784 ± 166). As expected, the absolute values of the initial rates of Ca2+ entry were significantly lower because of the depolarization of PM (compare with Fig. 2). Alkalinization of the extracellular milieu led to the alkalinization of the cytosol but to a much smaller extent due to homeostasis of intracellular parameters (16Zabøocki K. Makowska A. Duszyński J. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 23Heming T.A. Bulayeva N.N. Bidani A. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 2003; 105: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 24Wakabayashi J. Groschner K. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To support the notion that changes in extracellular pH are critical for the regulation of the CCE, Jurkat cells suspended in BSS at pH 7.2 were exposed to methylamine to increase cytosolic pH without influencing extracellular pH (25Danthuluri N.R. Kim D. Brock T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19071-19076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of methylamine used increased cytosolic pH by 0.2–0.3 of a unit, which corresponded to cytosolic pH change after switching the extracellular pH from 7.2 to 7.8. As shown in Fig. 3, methylamine had only a small, if any, effect on the balance between Ca2+ influx and efflux in the cells treated with CCCP, whereas an increase in extracellular pH from 7.2 to 7.8 due to the addition of NaOH caused a fast and significant increase in [Ca2+]c. Similar effects were obtained for both control and antimycin-treated cells (not shown). Fig. 4 shows that the inhibitory effect of CCCP on the initial rate of calcium entry into cells suspended in BSS at pH 7.2 was inversely proportional to the concentration of extracellular CaCl2. On the other hand, in cells suspended in BSS at pH 7.8, the inhibition of calcium influx by CCCP was, as already described, smaller and virtually independent of the extracellular CaCl2 concentration in the range of 1–4 mm. This finding indicates that the kinetic parameters of CCE are modified by extracellular pH and dependent on the mitochondrial calcium-handling ability in Jurkat cells suspended in BSS at pH 7.2. Lineweaver-Burk analysis shown in Fig. 5 confirms this supposition. It revealed a significant increase in the apparent Kd of the CCE system for extracellular Ca2+ in cells suspended in BSS at pH 7.2 pretreated with CCCP (from 2.3 ± 0.6 mm for control cells to 11.0 ± 1.7 mm for cells with uncoupled mitochondria). In contrast, in cells suspended in BSS at pH 7.8, CCCP had only a slight influence on the apparent Kd value for extracellular Ca2+ (an increase from 1.3 ± 0.4 mm to 2.4 ± 0.4 mm). This approach does not allow for a full interpretation of these data as kinetic parameters of calcium channel per se, because of the high complexity of the whole-cell system. However, one could conclude that respiring mitochondria are necessary to keep Jurkat cells sensitive to extracellular calcium, only if the extracellular pH is rather low.Fig. 5Effect of CCCP on the Kd of the CCE system for extracellular Ca2+ in Jurkat cells suspended in BSS at pH 7.2 or pH 7.8. Lineweaver-Burk plots for one experiment of four is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Interestingly, thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ entry into human osteosarcoma cells suspended in BSS at pH 7.2 was not inhibited in the presence of the mitochondrial uncoupler (Fig. 6). Moreover, in these cells, CCCP caused an enhancement of the amplitude of the Ca2+ transient. The increase in extracellular pH from 7.2 to 7.8 influenced neither the initial rate of Ca2+ entry nor the sensitivity of CCE to the mitochondrial uncoupler (data not shown). Previously, we have shown that the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation by CCCP in Jurkat cells strongly decreases the rate of Ca2+ influx. This effect was postulated to be dependent on the extracellular pH (12Makowska A. Zabøocki K. Duszyński J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 16Zabøocki K. Makowska A. Duszyński J. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In this study, we present convincing evidence indicating that not only mitochondrial uncoupling but also other disturbances in mitochondrial calcium handling may reduce the activity of CCE and that these inhibitory effects are evidently dependent on extracellular pH. Moreover, we performed quantitative estimation of the effect of the mitochondrial uncoupler on the kinetic properties of the CCE system in Jurkat cells and proposed a functional model explaining the described phenomenon. In many cell types, especially in most electrically non-excitable ones, store-operated calcium channels require energized mitochondria for buffering the excess of Ca2+ and thereby for the protection of calcium influx against feedback inhibition (10Gilabert J.A. Parekh A.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6401-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 11Hoth M. Fanger C.M. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 633-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 12Makowska A. Zabøocki K. Duszyński J. Eur. J.

Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Ca2+ flux into Jurkat cells suspended in BSS at pH 7.2 results not only from the reduction of mitochondrial potential due to the addition of CCCP or antimycin plus oligomycin but may also be caused by inhibition of the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. This effect indicates that mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering capacity not only depends on the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake driven by membrane potential but also on mitochondrial capability for Ca2+ release. This is in agreement with the data showing that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, followed by tunneling and release of Ca2+ far from PM calcium channels, is crucial for the efficient calcium buffering in close vicinity of the PM (15Malli R. Frieden M. Osibow K. Zaratti C. Mayer M. Demaurex N. Graier W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44769-44779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Inhibitory effects of CCCP, antimycin A plus oligomycin, and CGP 37157 on the initial rate of calcium entry into Jurkat cells were strong when the cells were suspended in BSS at pH 7.2. In cells suspended in BSS at pH 7.8, Ca2+ influx was only slightly reduced. This finding confirms our previous observation that a gradual increase in extracellular pH from 7.0 to 7.8 progressively diminishes the sensitivity of CCE to the mitochondrial uncoupler (16Zabøocki K. Makowska A. Duszyński J. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A small (if any) effect of intracellular alkalinization by methylamine on [Ca2+]c in Jurkat cells suspended at pH 7.2 (see Fig. 3) indicates that the increase in intracellular pH could not explain potent effects of extracellular alkalinization on CCE activity. This is in agreement with our previous results with NH4Cl used for transient alkalinization of the cellular interior (16Zabøocki K. Makowska A. Duszyński J. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a very small but reproducible methylamine-induced increase in [Ca2+]c in Jurkat cells might be in agreement with the observation on human platelets, in which an increase in cytosolic pH causes slight activation of calcium influx (26Gende O.A. Platelets (Edinb.). 2003; 14: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Intracellular pH may, to some extent, regulate Ca2+ flux into the cell; however, these effects are small, and they could not be responsible for extracellular pH-dependent changes in the rate of CCE. This is also in agreement with observations on vascular endothelial cells (20Wakabayashi J. Groschner K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The finding that CCE needs functioning mitochondria for full activity in cells suspended at pH 7.2 and that this dependence is less obvious at pH 7.8 is further supported by the observation that the kinetic parameters of CCE in relation to inwardly transported Ca2+ are modified by extracellular pH. A large increase in the apparent Kd value for extracellular Ca2+ observed in the cells, suspended in BSS at pH 7.2 and exposed to CCCP in comparison to that in the cells with coupled mitochondria, suggests a competition-like relationship between extra- and intracellular calcium ions (Fig. 5). In fact, a decrease of mitochondrial potential has a negligible influence on calcium influx into Jurkat cells suspended in BSS at pH 7.2 and exposed to a very high (>6 mm) concentration of CaCl2 (data not shown). On the basis of the data presented in this study, we want to support our previous model of pH-dependent regulation of the channels involved in the CCE in Jurkat cells (16Zabøocki K. Makowska A. Duszyński J. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). According to this concept, intracellular Ca2+ could efficiently bind to and inhibit the channel only if the pH of the extracellular milieu dropped below 7.4. Under such conditions, mitochondria that accumulate calcium are crucial for keeping the channel active. Under more alkaline conditions, intracellular calcium, and in consequence, the mitochondrial energy state have only a slight influence on the kinetic parameters of CCE in Jurkat cells. In other words, the calcium channel acts as an extracellular pH sensor that may switch calcium conductivity from being sensitive to the intracellular Ca2+ mode (extracellular pH 7.2) to non-sensitive (extracellular pH 7.8). Recently, it has been demonstrated that a slight acidification of the extracellular milieu leads to protonation of the glutamate residue of the TRPV5 calcium channel protein and, in consequence, to the inhibition of calcium entry into the cell (27Yeh B-I. Sun T-J. Lee J.Z. Chen H-H. Huang C-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51044-51052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that this pH-sensing mechanism is responsible for pH-dependent conformational changes in the channel protein. In cultured vascular A7r5 cells, external acidosis decreases CCE (28Iwasawa K. Nakajima T. Hazama H. Goto A. Shin W.S. Toyo-Oka T. Omata M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 503: 237-251Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and this effect is not mimicked by intracellular acidification (for review, see Ref. 29Austin C. Wray S. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Similar dependencies between extracellular pH and Ca2+ entry were found in rabbit-resident alveolar macrophages, neurons, and pancreatic cells (23Heming T.A. Bulayeva N.N. Bidani A. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 2003; 105: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 30Hochstrate P. Dierkes P.W. Schlue W.R. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 184: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 31Muallem S. Pandol S.J. Beeker T.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: G917-G924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results presented in this study not only correspond well to these data but also indicate a novel mechanism connecting both extracellular pH and mitochondrial effects on CCE in Jurkat cells. It seems likely that extracellular pH-dependent regulation of CCE and its sensitivity to the mitochondrial energy state might be partially responsible for the abnormal behavior of lymphocytes exposed to the acidic environment and the limited availability of oxygen under some pathological conditions (33Fischer B. Muller B. Fischer K.G. Baur N. Kreuzt W. Clin. Immunol. 2000; 96: 252-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 34Muller B. Fischer B. Kreutz W.

Immunol. 2001; 31: 2829-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The regulatory mechanism of calcium entry into Jurkat cells (and many other electrically non-excitable cells) described in this study is based on the feedback inhibition of PM Ca2+ channels by intracellular calcium and a counteracting action of mitochondria buffering the excess of Ca2+. Surprisingly, mitochondrial de-energization does not reduce the rate of calcium entry into human osteosarcoma cells. Moreover, Ca2+ transients in osteosarcoma cells preincubated with thapsigargin exhibit much higher amplitude when electrical potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane collapsed (Fig. 6). This resembles, to some extent, the effects of mitochondrial uncouplers on the calcium entry into electrically excitable cells, in which mitochondrial sequestration of Ca2+ entering the excited cells decreases the amplitude of Ca2+ spikes and modulates the intensity of calcium signals. The gradual release of Ca2+ accumulated in the mitochondrial matrix prolongs the Ca2+ signal after the initial stimulus has been turned off. Reduction of the calcium buffering capacity by mitochondria (e.g. by depolarization of the mitochondrial inner membrane) results in the increased amplitude and shortened duration of the cytosolic Ca2+ signals (36Werth J.L. Thayer S.A. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 348-356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Friel D.D. Tsien R.W. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4007-4024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Friel D.D. Cell Calcium. 2000; 28: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The comparison of the regulatory mechanisms of calcium entry into Jurkat cells and osteosarcoma cells suggests that Ca2+ fluxes into these cells occur via different channel types.
