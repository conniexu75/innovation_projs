Whereas gender, residence, work hours per week, faculty, academic performance (GPA), lifestyle habits (smoking and alcohol drinking), and religious practice did not associate with smartphone addiction score; personality type A, class (year 2 vs. year 3), younger age at first smartphone use, excessive use during a weekday, using it for entertainment and not using it to call family members, and having depression or anxiety, showed statistically significant associations with smartphone addiction. Depression and anxiety scores emerged as independent positive predictors of smartphone addiction, after adjustment for confounders.Several independent positive predictors of smartphone addiction emerged including depression and anxiety. It could be that young adults with personality type A experiencing high stress level and low mood may lack positive stress coping mechanisms and mood management techniques and are thus highly susceptible to smartphone addiction."

Here we have investigated the development of the human atrial and ventricular lineages from hPSCs, and we show that retinoic acid signaling at the mesoderm stage of development is required for atrial specification. Analyses of early developmental stages revealed that ventricular and atrial cardiomyocytes derive from different mesoderm populations that can be distinguished based on CD235a and RALDH2 expression, respectively. Molecular and electrophysiological characterization of the derivative cardiomyocytes revealed that optimal specification of ventricular and atrial cells is dependent on induction of the appropriate mesoderm. Together these findings provide new insights into the development of the human atrial and ventricular lineages that enable the generation of highly enriched, functional cardiomyocyte populations for therapeutic applications."
https://openalex.org/W2745087321,"Adult mammalian cardiomyocyte regeneration after injury is thought to be minimal. Mononuclear diploid cardiomyocytes (MNDCMs), a relatively small subpopulation in the adult heart, may account for the observed degree of regeneration, but this has not been tested. We surveyed 120 inbred mouse strains and found that the frequency of adult mononuclear cardiomyocytes was surprisingly variable (>7-fold). Cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart functional recovery after coronary artery ligation both correlated with pre-injury MNDCM content. Using genome-wide association, we identified Tnni3k as one gene that influences variation in this composition and demonstrated that Tnni3k knockout resulted in elevated MNDCM content and increased cardiomyocyte proliferation after injury. Reciprocally, overexpression of Tnni3k in zebrafish promoted cardiomyocyte polyploidization and compromised heart regeneration. Our results corroborate the relevance of MNDCMs in heart regeneration. Moreover, they imply that intrinsic heart regeneration is not limited nor uniform in all individuals, but rather is a variable trait influenced by multiple genes."

Here, we report a 3D cryo-EM structure of a pre-catalytic human spliceosomal B complex. The U2 snRNP-containing head domain is connected to the B complex main body via three main bridges. U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP proteins, which are located in the main body, undergo significant rearrangements during tri-snRNP integration into the B complex. These include formation of a partially closed Prp8 conformation that creates, together with Dim1, a 5' splice site (ss) binding pocket, displacement of Sad1, and rearrangement of Brr2 such that it contacts its U4/U6 substrate and is poised for the subsequent spliceosome activation step. The molecular organization of several B-specific proteins suggests that they are involved in negatively regulating Brr2, positioning the U6/5'ss helix, and stabilizing the B complex structure. Our results indicate significant differences between the early activation phase of human and yeast spliceosomes."

We then used these data to (i) estimate the heritability and familial environmental patterns of 149 diseases and (ii) infer the genetic and environmental correlations for disease pairs from a set of 29 complex diseases. The majority (52 of 65) of our study's heritability estimates matched earlier reports, and 84 of our estimates appear to have been obtained for the first time. We used correlation matrices to compute environmental and genetic disease classifications and corresponding reliability measures. Among unexpected observations, we found that migraine, typically classified as a disease of the central nervous system, appeared to be most genetically similar to irritable bowel syndrome and most environmentally similar to cystitis and urethritis, all of which are inflammatory diseases."

CNS axons typically form highly branched terminal arbors in their synaptic target area. The branching complexity of an arbor defines the number and extent of post-synaptic partners a neuron can have and is a critical determinant of neural circuit assembly (Alsina et al., 2001Alsina B.

Arbor size and dynamics are influenced by extrinsic stimuli, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Netrin-1 (Cohen-Cory and Fraser, 1995Cohen-Cory S. Fraser S.E.

Shen K. Bülow H.E. Intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms of dendritic morphogenesis.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2015; 77: 271-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying axonal terminal branching in vivo. Many guidance cues that trigger local protein synthesis (LPS) in axons, such as Netrin-1, BDNF, Sema3A, and Slit2 (Campbell and Holt, 2001Campbell D.S. Holt C.E.

Dent E.W. Branch management: mechanisms of axon branching in the developing vertebrate CNS.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 15: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), suggesting a link between LPS and axonal branching. Indeed, recent evidence shows that knockdown of specific RBPs—Vg1RBP and Hermes—reduces retinal axon terminal arborization in Xenopus (Hörnberg et al., 2013Hörnberg H. Wollerton-van Horck F. Maurus D. Zwart M. Svoboda H. Harris W.A. Holt C.E. RNA-binding protein Hermes/RBPMS inversely affects synapse density and axon arbor formation in retinal ganglion cells in vivo.J.

Neurobiol. 2014; 74: 303-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Conversely, downregulation of the RBP fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), a negative translation regulator, increases axonal branching in Drosophila (Pan et al., 2004Pan L. Zhang Y.Q. Woodruff E. Broadie K. The Drosophila fragile X gene negatively regulates neuronal elaboration and synaptic differentiation.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1863-1870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and zebrafish (Tucker et al., 2006Tucker B. Richards R.I. Lardelli M.

Genet. 2006; 15: 3446-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) neurons, indicating that precise RBP-regulated mRNA translation is required for appropriate branching. These studies disrupted gene function across all neuronal compartments (soma, dendrites, and axons), however, leaving open the question of whether axonally localized LPS has a role in branching. Culture studies have uncovered an association between axonal branching and LPS. For example, newly synthesized green fluorescent protein (GFP) puncta localize to the base of collateral spikes in cultured retinal axons (Brittis et al., 2002Brittis P.A. Lu Q. Flanagan J.G. Axonal protein synthesis provides a mechanism for localized regulation at an intermediate target.Cell. 2002; 110: 223-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), and the translational machinery localizes to branch points in cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons (Spillane et al., 2012Spillane M. Ketschek A. Donnelly C.J. Pacheco A. Twiss J.L. Gallo G. Nerve growth factor-induced formation of axonal filopodia and collateral branches involves the intra-axonal synthesis of regulators of the actin-nucleating Arp2/3 complex.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 17671-17689Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Moreover, axonally synthesized regulators of the actin-nucleating Arp2/3 complex are involved in nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced collateral branching (Spillane et al., 2012Spillane M. Ketschek A. Donnelly C.J. Pacheco A. Twiss J.L. Gallo G. Nerve growth factor-induced formation of axonal filopodia and collateral branches involves the intra-axonal synthesis of regulators of the actin-nucleating Arp2/3 complex.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 17671-17689Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and targeting β-actin mRNA to axons supports collateral branching in an injury-conditioned paradigm (Donnelly et al., 2013Donnelly C.J. Park M. Spillane M. Yoo S. Pacheco A. Gomes C. Vuppalanchi D. McDonald M. Kim H.H. Merianda T.T. et al.Axonally synthesized β-actin and GAP-43 proteins support distinct modes of axonal growth.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 3311-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, mRNAs encoding proteins associated with branching are actively translated in arborizing mouse retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon terminals in vivo (Shigeoka et al., 2016Shigeoka T. Jung H. Jung J. Turner-Bridger B. Ohk J. Lin J.Q. Amieux P.S. Holt C.E. Dynamic axonal translation in developing and mature visual circuits.Cell. 2016; 166: 181-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that LPS may provide a critical link between extrinsic (branch-regulating) signals and branching, but the precise spatiotemporal dynamics of mRNA and LPS and their roles in axonal branching in vivo have not been examined. In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of RNA movements, LPS, and axon terminal arborization in vivo. We developed a method to visualize endogenous RNA granules for prolonged periods (>1 hr) in single axons in the Xenopus visual system and performed live imaging to simultaneously capture arbor dynamics and RNA trafficking in vivo. Our results reveal a close relationship between arbor dynamics and RNA trafficking and show that RNA docking predicts sites of branch emergence. Live visualization of β-actin synthesis reveals the rapid accumulation of nascent β-actin in discrete “hotspots” in branches and at branch points. Functional experiments show that LPS is required for proper axon arbor formation in vivo. Knockdown of local β-actin synthesis causes a marked reduction in the emergence of new branches and results in impoverished axon terminal arbors. Collectively, the findings provide evidence of a pivotal role of LPS in determining axon arbor architecture in vivo. To label endogenous RNA, we delivered labeled uridine-5'-triphosphate (UTP) analogs, Cy5-UTP or biotin-UTP, intracellularly by eye electroporation or blastomere injection in Xenopus embryos. UTP analogs become incorporated into RNA during its synthesis and can then be monitored by live fluorescence imaging in putative ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) in retinal axons in vitro (Piper et al., 2015Piper M. Lee A.C. van Horck F.P. McNeilly H. Lu T.B. Harris W.A. Holt C.E. Differential requirement of F-actin and microtubule cytoskeleton in cue-induced local protein synthesis in axonal growth cones.Neural Dev. 2015; 10: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The UTP analog was confirmed to be incorporated exclusively into RNA (including mRNA and rRNA) using qRT-PCR and bioanalyzer analysis of streptavidin/biotin-UTP pull-down following biotin-UTP blastomere injection and was not detected in genomic or mitochondrial DNA (Figures S1A–S1K). The method therefore provides an unbiased approach to label and track endogenous RNAs. Next, we examined the general characteristics of endogenous RNA motility in RGC axon terminals in the tectum in vivo. Cy5-UTP was delivered into developing RGCs along with a membrane-targeted GFP (mGFP) reporter by targeted eye electroporation at stage 28, the beginning of RGC axonogenesis. Cy5-RNA and GFP-labeled axons were imaged in the optic tectum with time-lapse microscopy (10–20 frames/min for >1 hr) during the early phase of arborization and map formation (stages 41–43). Cy5-RNA appeared as punctate granules, often highly mobile, indicative of RNPs. We refer to these as “RNA granules.” Motile RNA granules were observed in the majority of GFP-labeled retinal axon terminals with an average density of 2.6 ± 0.29 granules/10 μm (Movies S1 and S2). During an average 1 min period, 59.2% of the RNA granules were mobile and moved in anterograde (25.6% ± 3.4%) or retrograde (27.7% ± 3.4%) directions or bi-directionally (5.9% ± 2.0%), while 40.8% ± 3.9% remained stationary (Figure S1L). An analysis of granule speed along the main axon shaft (excluding branches) showed an average anterograde speed of 10.0 ± 0.7 μm/min and retrograde speed of 11.4 ± 1.3 μm/min (Figures S1M and S1N). We next investigated whether distinct aspects of branching, such as branch emergence and stabilization, are associated with the spatial and temporal positioning of RNA granules. New “branches” first appear as filopodial protrusions of less than 5 μm in length that emerge from the main axon shaft. Many of these are short lived, but some elongate to >5 μm and persist. We refer to these longer structures as “branches” to distinguish them from the shorter filopodial protrusions. Motile RNA granules were often observed to pause briefly (>10 s), or “dock,” at sites of branch emergence in the axon shaft immediately preceding the appearance of a new protrusion. 84% of the filopodial protrusions exhibited docked RNA granules at their bases in the 10 s time window preceding their emergence. The docked RNA granules often persisted at the bases of filopodia during emergence, although in some cases (5%), the dwell time was transient (<10 s), and the granules moved away before the filopodia became visible (Figure 1B). Individual RNA granules occasionally exhibited repetitive docking at different sites along an axon where each dock site preceded the emergence of a new protrusion (Figure 1A; Movie S1), suggesting that specific RNA granules may be highly potent in their ability to initiate filopodial protrusions. Interestingly, while we rarely observed filopodial emergence, retraction, and re-emergence at the same sites, we often saw repeated cycles of partial retraction and extension (Movie S2) and instances of multiple filopodia emanating in different directions in 3D from the site of some docked RNA granules (green arrowheads from ∼10 min onward in Movie S1). To estimate what fraction of docking events lead to protrusion events, we generated 20 sets of time points and axon positions randomly for each axon (n = 5). The closest RNA granule to the randomized position was tracked across time to find the first instance of docking >10 s, and we then scored whether a protrusion emerges at this position within the 10 s of docking. We found that 22.0% ± 5.1% of RNA granules displaying this docking motion were followed by protrusion emergence. To test the possibility that these correlations are meaningful and not simply coincidental, we compared how frequently RNA granules docked at random positions along the axons versus an equivalent number of bone fide protrusion sites. Even though some of the random positions fell indiscriminately on protrusion-forming sites, we found that RNA granules docked at just 16% of random sites, compared to 84% at protrusion sites. (Figure 1B), showing that the correlation between the site of branch initiation and RNA granule docking is not simply coincidental. Moreover, the temporal order in which these events occur (RNA docking followed by branch emergence) is consistent with a causal role of RNA granule docking in protrusion initiation. Previous work has shown that only a small subset of newly formed branches persist to form stabilized mature branches, while the majority are short lived and retract within 10 min (Witte et al., 1996Witte S. Stier H. Cline H.T. In vivo observations of timecourse and distribution of morphological dynamics in Xenopus retinotectal axon arbors.J. Neurobiol. 1996; 31: 219-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next asked whether branches with lifetimes > 30 min, which we define as “persistent,” exhibited any distinct RNA granule behavior. RNA granules were seen to invade persistent branches and often localized to their distal tips (>15 μm; Figure 1A; Movie S2). By contrast, RNA granules were rarely observed making excursions into short-lived (<30 min) branches. Notably, RNA granules inside persistent branches often docked at sites from which a new protrusion or secondary branch emerged (arrowheads in Movie S2). The association between branch persistence and RNA invasion suggests a link between the two. Occasionally, branches harboring RNA granules were seen to retract abruptly. Retrospective image analysis of these events showed, strikingly, that RNA granules were rapidly trafficked retrogradely out of the branch preceding retraction (yellow arrow in Figure 1A). Thus, branch formation, stabilization, and retraction appear to be closely coupled to the localization of RNA granules (Figure 1A; Movie S3). To evaluate whether RNA localization correlates with branch lifetime and branch length, we categorized the branches into two groups on the basis of their lifetime—short lived (0–30 min) and persistent (31–60 min)—and length. The total time of the presence/absence of RNA granules at each of the three branch locations (base, tip, and intervening mid-region) was scored. RNA granules were present for significantly longer times in persistent branches compared with short-lived branches (Figure 1C). RNA granules were also present more of the time in longer branches (>15 μm) than in shorter branches (5–15 μm) (Figure 1D). In accordance with these results, we found that branch lifetime positively correlated with the duration of RNA localization at different branch positions (Figure 1E). In addition, the maximal branch length also correlated with the duration of RNA presence (Figure 1F). Thus, the spatial and temporal dynamics of RNA granules correlate with branch lifetime and length, consistent with the observation of increased RNA localization in stabilized branches. Mitochondria supply the energy for organelle trafficking and mRNA translation and have previously been shown to localize to branch points in axons in vitro (Courchet et al., 2013Courchet J. Lewis Jr., T.L. Lee S. Courchet V. Liou D.Y. Aizawa S. Polleux F.

Mitochondria coordinate sites of axon branching through localized intra-axonal protein synthesis.Cell Rep. 2013; 5: 1564-1575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To visualize mitochondrial dynamics in axons in vivo, we introduced mitochondria-targeted GFP (mito-GFP) cDNA into RGCs by electroporation and conducted time-lapse imaging on axon arbors at stages 41–43. Mitochondria were commonly observed to accumulate at sites of axonal branch emergence (Figures S2A and S2B). They rarely entered transient branches but often moved into stabilized persistent branches (Figures S2A and S2C–S2F). Inside the branch, they commonly remained motile moving back and forth along the length of the branch and stalled at sites of new (secondary) branch formation. Like RNA granules, mitochondria moved out of branches immediately preceding retraction (Figure S2A). Dual imaging confirmed that Cy5-UTP and mito-GFP label distinct structures (Figure S3; Movie S4) and revealed that motile RNA granules frequently visited and stopped on mitochondria, remaining juxtaposed for significant periods (>3 min), and exhibited synchronous movements indicative of close interactions. Overall, our data indicate that endogenous RNA and mitochondria dock at sites associated with axonal branching in vivo, and their dynamics suggest a coupling of energy supply to RNA regulation. RNA transport and localization is intimately linked to LPS in neuronal compartments (Aakalu et al., 2001Aakalu G. Smith W.B. Nguyen N. Jiang C. Schuman E.M.

To test the functional role of LPS in axon branching in vivo, we first used a pharmacological approach on the exposed brain preparation. The intact larval brain was exposed by simple removal of the overlying skin epidermis and protein synthesis (PS) inhibitors (cycloheximide/CHX and anisomycin/ANI) were added to the medium. Following electroporation of fluorescent reporters in the eye optimized for single RGC labeling, the in vivo arborization dynamics of RGC axons were imaged in the optic tract and/or the optic tectum every 30 s over a period of 10 min (stages 41–43; Figure 2A). To confirm that the treatment effectively inhibited PS in live brains, we developed a puromycylation-based translation assay on whole-mount brains to obtain a quantitative measure of PS. Exposed brains were treated for 30 min with PS inhibitors, followed by puromycin (puro) treatment for 10 min and subsequent anti-puro immunocytochemistry in whole-mount brains. Puro mimics tRNA and, at the low concentration used, is incorporated into the C termini of polypeptide chains, releasing them from ribosomes. PS inhibitor treatment greatly reduced the puro-immuno signal, confirming the effectiveness of the PS inhibition (Figures 3B and 3C). In the control condition, single axon arbors were highly dynamic, with an average of 50 filopodia and 8 branches added and removed in 10 min (Figure 2B; Movie S5). By contrast, in brains treated with PS inhibitors, the arbor dynamics were reduced by 40%–70% (Figures 2C–2F; Movie S5). A detailed analysis revealed that the balance of addition and retraction of protrusions was also affected. In the control condition, slightly more filopodia (52 versus 47) and branches (7.8 versus 5.3) were added than were retracted (Figure 2B). This bias leads to a small, but consistent, net increase in the number of protrusions. Interestingly, upon acute inhibition of PS, the number of protrusions being added or removed became indistinguishable, tipping the normal balance from a net increase to an equilibrium (Figures 2C and 2D). The observed deficits were not due to PS inhibition in the RGC soma as we removed the eye prior to drug treatment. Previously, it was shown that somaless RGC axons continue to navigate to the tectum and arborize in a grossly normal manner in vivo for up to 3 hr (Harris et al., 1987Harris W.A. Holt C.E. Bonhoeffer F. Retinal axons with and without their somata, growing to and arborizing in the tectum of Xenopus embryos: a time-lapse video study of single fibres in vivo.Development. 1987; 101: 123-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We extend these findings to show that within the time window of our experimental protocols (<1 hr), eye removal does not affect branching dynamics (Figure S4). These results are consistent with a possible role for LPS in axonal branching in vivo. Embryos with eyes removed and treated with PS inhibitors for 30 min during the period of axon elongation in the optic tract (stages 35/36–37/38) did not exhibit abnormal pathfinding or stalling (Figure 3). Moreover, the speed of axon advance did not differ from control brains in either the ventral or the dorsal optic tract (Figures 3H and 3I). These findings indicate that acute PS inhibition does not cause gross defects in axon growth or navigation in the optic tract, whereas axonal branching is particularly sensitive to such treatment. β-actin mRNA localizes to axons (Bassell et al., 1998Bassell G.J. Zhang H. Byrd A.L. Femino A.M. Singer R.H. Taneja K.L. Lifshitz L.M. Herman I.M. Kosik K.S. Sorting of beta-actin mRNA and protein to neurites and growth cones in culture.J.

These two cues are expressed in the optic tectum, and both act as key branch regulators of retinal axons in the tectum in vivo (Cohen-Cory and Fraser, 1995Cohen-Cory S. Fraser S.E.

Neurosci. 2009; 29: 11065-11077Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Furthermore, targeting of β-actin mRNA to injury-conditioned axons promotes branch formation in vitro (Donnelly et al., 2013Donnelly C.J. Park M. Spillane M. Yoo S. Pacheco A. Gomes C. Vuppalanchi D. McDonald M. Kim H.H. Merianda T.T. et al.Axonally synthesized β-actin and GAP-43 proteins support distinct modes of axonal growth.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 3311-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and the local remodeling of the actin network has been shown to regulate axonal branching in vivo (Chia et al., 2014Chia P.H. Chen B. Li P. Rosen M.K. Shen K. Local F-actin network links synapse formation and axon branching.Cell. 2014; 156: 208-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We thus focused on β-actin mRNA to further examine the role of LPS in the dynamics of axonal branching in vivo. To block β-actin mRNA translation, a β-actin antisense morpholino (MO) was injected into the blastomeres fated to give rise to the CNS at the four-cell stage. This resulted in a 47% reduction in β-actin levels, in agreement with previous studies (Leung et al., 2006Leung K.M. van Horck F.P. Lin A.C. Allison R. Standart N. Holt C.E. Asymmetrical beta-actin mRNA translation in growth cones mediates attractive turning to netrin-1.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1247-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), and did not cause gross changes in embryogenesis (Figures S5A–S5E). To target the β-actin knockdown to RGCs and to visualize the trajectories of single axons, we electroporated the β-actin MO together with a reporter mGFP plasmid into the eye at stage 28. At stage 45, when RGC axon arbors have reached maturity and become relatively stable, we imaged single arbors in the tectum and performed quantitative analysis. While highly complex arbors were seen in the control MO (Con MO) embryos, β-actin MO-axons exhibited much simpler arbors (Figure 4A). Quantitative branching analysis showed that the branch numbers decreased across different branch orders, leading to an overall drop of 56% (Figure 4B) and a 50% reduction of the total branch length (Figure 4C). The distribution of branches shifted toward lower br"

Claims of significant population structure support hypotheses in many brain areas. However, these claims require first investigating the possibility that the population structure in question is an expected byproduct of simpler features known to exist in data. Classically, this critical examination can be either intuited or addressed with conventional controls. However, these approaches fail when considering population data, raising concerns about the scientific merit of population-level studies. Here we develop a framework to test the novelty of population-level findings against simpler features such as correlations across times, neurons and conditions. We apply this framework to test two recent population findings in prefrontal and motor cortices, providing essential context to those studies. More broadly, the methodologies we introduce provide a general neural population control for many population-level hypotheses."

These data demonstrate the potential of stroma recovery to improve HSC transplantation. Approximately 50,000 hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (HSC-T) are performed every year in order to treat patients with hematopoietic malignancy, aplastic anemia, and primary immunodeficiency (Majhail et al., 2012Majhail N.S.

Successful engraftment by exogenous HSCs requires a competitive advantage over endogenous HSCs, which is achieved by eliminating host marrow cells by combinations of chemotherapeutics and irradiation. The use of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC), better prophylaxis against infection, refined immunosuppressive therapies to control graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), and reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen with lower toxicities have improved overall survival over the last 2 decades (Majhail et al., 2012Majhail N.S.

Oncol. Stem Cell Ther. 2012; 5: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding, HSC-T still entails significant risks for patients: the overall survival probability for adult leukemia patients who receive allo-HSCT is only about 50% (Anasetti et al., 2012Anasetti C. Logan B.R. Lee S.J. Waller E.K. Weisdorf D.J. Wingard J.R. Cutler C.S. Westervelt P. Woolfrey A. Couban S. et al.Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials NetworkPeripheral-blood stem cells versus bone marrow from unrelated donors.N. Engl. J. Med. 2012; 367: 1487-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), which increases to 85% for the following 10 years if patients survive the critical first 2 years (Wingard et al., 2011Wingard J.R. Majhail N.S. Brazauskas R. Wang Z. Sobocinski K.A. Jacobsohn D. Sorror M.L. Horowitz M.M. Bolwell B. Rizzo J.D. Socié G. Long-term survival and late deaths after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation.J. Clin. Oncol. 2011; 29: 2230-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). About half of patient’s deaths are due to leukemic relapse, while 15% are caused by either GvHD or infections. Post-transplant patients suffer from myelosuppression for several weeks and deteriorated adaptive immunity increasing the risk of opportunistic infections (Storek et al., 2008Storek J. Geddes M. Khan F. Huard B. Helg C. Chalandon Y. Passweg J. Roosnek E. Reconstitution of the immune system after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in humans.Semin. Immunopathol. 2008; 30: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Even in the absence of GvHD, most patients require about 1 year for adequate reconstitution of the adaptive immune system. Donor-derived adaptive immunity is typically poor, since post-transplant, homeostatic expansion of T cells restricts clonal diversity and limits T cell-dependent B cell responses (Norlin et al., 2008Norlin A.C. Sairafi D. Mattsson J. Ljungman P. Ringdén O. Remberger M. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation: Low immunoglobulin levels associated with decreased survival.Bone Marrow Transplant. 2008; 41: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Humoral immunity is further reduced due to insufficient B lymphopoiesis characterized by a lack of B cell precursors (Storek et al., 2008Storek J. Geddes M. Khan F. Huard B. Helg C. Chalandon Y. Passweg J. Roosnek E. Reconstitution of the immune system after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in humans.Semin. Immunopathol. 2008; 30: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). B cell deficiency can be compensated by intravenous immunoglobulin replacement therapy, which, however, often produces side effects. Therefore, approaches increasing post-transplantation myelopoiesis and B lymphopoiesis may alleviate HSC-T related complications such as life-threatening infections. Hematopoietic stem cells have the capacity to self-renew and to generate all differentiated cell types present in the blood. Among the cell populations present in the bone marrow (BM), HSCs are uniquely able to stably engraft the BM of a recipient and to expand and provide long-term multi-lineage hematopoiesis. A number of studies have demonstrated improved outcome of HSC-T with increased doses of CD34+ stem and progenitor cells indicating that their expansion capability may be limited (Pulsipher et al., 2009Pulsipher M.A. Chitphakdithai P. Logan B.R. Leitman S.F. Anderlini P. Klein J.P. Horowitz M.M. Miller J.P. King R.J. Confer D.L. Donor, recipient, and transplant characteristics as risk factors after unrelated donor PBSC transplantation: Beneficial effects of higher CD34+ cell dose.Blood. 2009; 114: 2606-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In animal experiments, the number of donor HSCs after transplantation does not exceed around 10% of that present in controls even when excess amounts of HSCs are transplanted (Iscove and Nawa, 1997Iscove N.N. Nawa K. Hematopoietic stem cells expand during serial transplantation in vivo without apparent exhaustion.Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 805-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This may explain the impaired hematopoiesis with respect to lineage progenitors in the BM in human patients, which is still observed several years post-HSC-T (Domenech et al., 1995Domenech J. Linassier C. Gihana E. Dayan A. Truglio D. Bout M. Petitdidier C. Delain M. Petit A. Brémond J.L. et al.Prolonged impairment of hematopoiesis after high-dose therapy followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation.Blood. 1995; 85: 3320-3327PubMed Google Scholar). In the BM, HSCs are found in specialized stromal niches, which support HSC self-renewal and multipotency (Acar et al., 2015Acar M. Kocherlakota K.S. Murphy M.M. Peyer J.G. Oguro H. Inra C.N. Jaiyeola C. Zhao Z. Luby-Phelps K. Morrison S.J. Deep imaging of bone marrow shows non-dividing stem cells are mainly perisinusoidal.Nature. 2015; 526: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). However, sustained and quantitative engraftment by donor HSCs requires pre-conditioning using irradiation or chemotherapeutics (Tomita et al., 1994Tomita Y. Sachs D.H. Sykes M. Myelosuppressive conditioning is required to achieve engraftment of pluripotent stem cells contained in moderate doses of syngeneic bone marrow.Blood. 1994; 83: 939-948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which ablates most of the hematopoietic system of the host. Without pre-conditioning, donor chimerism remains very low (Bhattacharya et al., 2009Bhattacharya D. Czechowicz A. Ooi A.G. Rossi D.J. Bryder D. Weissman I.L. Niche recycling through division-independent egress of hematopoietic stem cells.J. Exp. Med. 2009; 206: 2837-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), indicating competition between donor and host HSCs for available niches. The niche supports HSCs by providing factors such as CXCL12 and Kit-ligand (or Stem Cell factor) and facilitates expansion without exhaustion. Given the proximity of dormant and cycling HSCs and committed progenitors within the BM, it is thought that the different hematopoietic populations are supported by distinct types of specialized niches (Ding and Morrison, 2013Ding L. Morrison S.J. Haematopoietic stem cells and early lymphoid progenitors occupy distinct bone marrow niches.Nature. 2013; 495: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar): e.g., arteriolar and sinusoidal niches that preferentially associate with either quiescent or proliferating HSCs, respectively (Itkin et al., 2016Itkin T. Gur-Cohen S. Spencer J.A. Schajnovitz A. Ramasamy S.K. Kusumbe A.P. Ledergor G. Jung Y. Milo I. Poulos M.G. et al.Distinct bone marrow blood vessels differentially regulate haematopoiesis.Nature. 2016; 532: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, Kunisaki et al., 2013Kunisaki Y. Bruns I. Scheiermann C. Ahmed J. Pinho S. Zhang D. Mizoguchi T. Wei Q. Lucas D. Ito K. et al.Arteriolar niches maintain haematopoietic stem cell quiescence.Nature. 2013; 502: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Understanding the biology of these niches may provide valuable therapeutic opportunities to improve hematopoiesis after transplantation or to correct hematopoietic disorders. For example, osteoblastic niches were shown to support B lymphopoiesis in the bone marrow (Wu et al., 2008Wu J.Y. Purton L.E. Rodda S.J. Chen M. Weinstein L.S. McMahon A.P. Scadden D.T. Kronenberg H.M. Osteoblastic regulation of B lymphopoiesis is mediated by Gsα-dependent signaling pathways.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 16976-16981Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Here, we find that pre-conditioning for HSC-T using total body irradiation (TBI) permanently incapacitates the BM stroma. This defect can be rescued by intra-bone transplantation of freshly isolated CD73+ CD105– SCA1+ multipotent bone marrow stromal stem cells but not using cultured cells. Indeed, the co-transplantation of HSCs with primary bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) markedly improves the expansion of donor-derived HSCs in irradiated hosts and reduces side effects of HSC-T such as neutropenia or B lymphocytopenia. Since irradiation damages DNA and thus targets proliferating cells, we used the colony-forming units fibroblasts (CFU-F) assay to estimate the content of proliferation-competent BM stromal cells after TBI at a dose (2 × 4.5 Gy, 4 hr apart) routinely used to pre-condition mice for HSC transplantation. Total bone marrow cells were isolated by first flushing the red marrow cavity (marrow suspension) and combining this preparation with cells isolated by crushing and treating the marrow-free bones with collagenase (endosteal and metaphysis fraction; Figure S1A). The latter preparation contained over 99% of CFU-F activity within the bone (Figure S1B). In contrast to controls, which gave rise to around 2,000 CFU-F per femur, irradiated mice showed an over 98% reduction of CFU-F activity 1 day after irradiation (Figure 1A). In order to determine whether TBI resulted in transient or permanent loss of CFU-F activity, we rescued hematopoiesis in irradiated mice by HSC-T (via systemic delivery by tail vein injection). Surprisingly, the CFU-F activity did not recover after 4 weeks and only marginally increased to 7% of controls after 4 months indicating that upon irradiation the stroma had permanently lost its ability to expand ex vivo. In agreement with these data, bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) isolated from irradiated, GFP+ donors by magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) to remove CD45+, CD11b+, LY76 (Ter119)+, and CD31+ (hematopoietic and endothelial lineage) cells (Figure S1C) did not engraft GFP– recipients, while BMSCs from non-irradiated GFP+ donors were readily detected 5 days after transplantation (Figure 1B). Further, stroma-derived factors and markers of stromal differentiation (Kitl, Vcam1, Angpt1, Spp1, Adipoq, Sp7) were severely reduced in BMSCs isolated 4 weeks after irradiation (and HSC-T) as compared to controls (Figure 1C). Together this indicates that the pre-conditioning, which is typically used for HSC engraftment leads to a severe and long-term defect of the BM stroma. Importantly, the reduction in CFU-F activity is paralleled by a reduction of HSC numbers after transplantation. Transplanting 5 × 10E6 bone marrow cells (containing ∼300 HSCs) into an irradiated mouse (which equals 2.5 × 10E8 BM cells per kilogram body weight and corresponds to the dose typically used in patients: 2–11 × 10E8 BM cells per kilogram body weight with about 1% of CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells; Sezer et al., 2000Sezer O. Possinger K. Metzner B. Illiger H.J. Wattad M. Heit W. Fuss H. Schultze W. Optimal CD34(+) cell dose in autologous peripheral-blood stem-cell transplantation.J. Clin. Oncol. 2000; 18: 3319-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) failed to restore the number of HSCs present in non-irradiated control mice. While one femur of an irradiated recipient contained around 1,200 donor-derived HSCs (Lin– SCA1+ KIT+ [LSK] CD150+ CD48–) after 4 weeks and 1,500 donor-derived HSCs after 12 weeks, around 8,400 HSCs were present in the femur of non-irradiated, non-transplanted control mice (Figures 1D and S1D). Together, these data reveal that pre-conditioning by irradiation permanently damages the BM stroma, which shows only insufficient, spontaneous recovery. The residual stroma may be ineffective at supporting HSC reconstitution. We next addressed whether HSC engraftment could be improved by restoring the BM stroma. To test whether stromal cells were recruited to irradiation-damaged stromal niches in the bone via the circulation, we irradiated a single femur while protecting the remainder of the body with a lead mask. As expected, the exposed femur lost over 95% of its stromal progenitors within 5 days after irradiation. Interestingly, CFU-F activity only recovered to about 20% of the control levels after 4 weeks (Figure 1E). This suggested inefficient mobilization and recruitment of stromal cells via the circulation. We thus performed rescue experiments with BMSCs by direct intra-bone transplantation instead of systemic delivery. Using cells obtained from BMSCs cultures (cBMSCs) expanded in vitro for 2 weeks did not improve the abundance of HSCs (Figure 1D). Together, these data reveal that pre-conditioning by irradiation permanently damages the BM stroma, which shows only insufficient, spontaneous recovery. The residual stroma may be ineffective at supporting HSC reconstitution. We next tested whether the co-transplantation of primary BMSCs into both femurs enhanced the efficiency of HSC-T (Figure 2A). To track transplanted cells, we used HSCs from mice ubiquitously expressing GFP (ACTIN-GFP). However, since GFP triggered cell rejection in wild-type hosts (Figures S2A and S2B), we used recipient mice expressing GFP in the pancreas under the control of the rat insulin promoter, which did not reject GFP-expressing cells (Figure S2C). Intra-bone engraftment of primary BMSCs was further improved using Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632 (Figure S2D), which possibly prevents anoikis of cells (Watanabe et al., 2007Watanabe K. Ueno M. Kamiya D. Nishiyama A. Matsumura M. Wataya T. Takahashi J.B. Nishikawa S. Nishikawa S. Muguruma K. Sasai Y. A ROCK inhibitor permits survival of dissociated human embryonic stem cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar). The co-transplantation of primary BMSCs had a significant effect on the abundance of Lin– SCA1+ KIT+ (LSK) cells (Figure 2B) and increased the frequency and absolute number of HSCs (LSK CD48– CD150+) and of LT-HSCs (LSK CD48– CD150+ CD34–) 4 weeks post-transplantation (Figures 2C and 2D). Competitive, long-term (16 weeks) reconstitution assays in secondary recipients confirmed expansion of functional HSCs in hosts co-transplanted with primary BMSCs and HSCs as compared to classical HSC-T alone (Figures 2E, 2F, and S2E–S2G). Chimerism at 16 weeks was more than doubled, and donor-derived contribution to the granulocytic (Gr1+ CD3– B220–) lineage increased over 3-fold by co-transplantation with primary BMSCs and HSCs. In contrast to primary BMSCs, HSC abundance remained low when the co-transplanted cells were obtained from BMSC cultures (cBMSCs) expanded in vitro for 2 weeks (Figure 2H; these data are displayed as fold change in comparison to HSC-T alone). If anything, cBMSCs decreased HSC and LT-HSC numbers and promoted the differentiation of common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs), which is in line with a lymphoid bias in patients receiving cultured BMSCs together with HSC-T (Ball et al., 2007Ball L.M. Bernardo M.E. Roelofs H. Lankester A. Cometa A. Egeler R.M. Locatelli F. Fibbe W.E. Cotransplantation of ex vivo expanded mesenchymal stem cells accelerates lymphocyte recovery and may reduce the risk of graft failure in haploidentical hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.Blood. 2007; 110: 2764-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). This may be due to altered expression of key regulators of HSC maintenance in primary as compared to cultured BMSCs. Indeed, Spp1 (OSTEOPONTIN), which limits the size of the HSC pool (Stier et al., 2005Stier S. Ko Y. Forkert R. Lutz C. Neuhaus T. Grünewald E. Cheng T. Dombkowski D. Calvi L.M. Rittling S.R. Scadden D.T. Osteopontin is a hematopoietic stem cell niche component that negatively regulates stem cell pool size.J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 1781-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), is strongly upregulated (300-fold) upon in vitro culture. This may blunt the effect of enhanced Kitl expression (30-fold) in cBMSCs (Figure 2I; Cxcl12 was not significantly altered, data not shown). Failure of the in-vitro-expanded cBMSCs to expand HSCs was confirmed by secondary reconstitution assays (Figures 2E, 2F, and S2E–S2G). Thus, only primary BMSCs significantly expanded the abundance of functional HSCs in irradiated recipients, indicating that deficient stromal support induced by TBI limited the number of HSCs. The beneficial effects of BMSC transplantation could be due to local or systemic effects. Restricting co-transplantation to only one femur allowed a direct comparison of HSC numbers in contralateral bones. We first ensured that donor-derived (GFP+) stromal cells transplanted into one femur were only very inefficiently recruited to the contralateral femur (Figure 3A). LT-HSCs were significantly more abundant in the primary BMSC-transplanted femur (Figure 3B). Interestingly, an increased number of HSCs and LT-HSCs was also observed when primary BMSCs were transplanted 4 weeks after the initial HSC-T (Figures 3C and 3D), indicating that HSCs dynamically responded to the presence of BMSCs and expanded as a function of available niche support. Competitive reconstitution assays in secondary recipients confirmed the increased abundance of HSCs upon delayed BMSC transplantation; however, due to the limited sample size the data did not reach statistical significance (data not shown). We conclude that BMSCs have a limited ability to systemically support hematopoiesis or to be mobilized. Primary BMSCs can dynamically expand the abundance of HSCs, indicating that the size and/or quality of HSC niches can be restored and modulated even post-HSC-T by providing exogenous stromal cells. Post-transplantation patients suffer from neutropenia and weak adaptive immunity, which increases the risk of opportunistic infections and poses major clinical problems. We thus evaluated whether BMSC co-transplantation (GFP+ cells into both femurs) as compared to classical HSC-T reduced some of these side effects. As expected, severe leukopenia (leukocyte levels less than 10% of controls) was observed in the peripheral blood 7 days after HSC-T (Figure 4A). After 14 days, recovery of leukocytes and in particular neutrophils as well as lymphocytes was improved at least 2-fold by co-transplantation of BMSCs (Figures 4A–4C; mice without successful engraftment of GFP+ BMSCs were excluded [one of 14], i.e., those yielding <20 CFU-F, which is the baseline in HSC-T without BMSC co-transplantation). Thrombocytopenia or anemia is not observed upon HSC-T in mice and was not affected by co-transplantation (data not shown). Mature B cells were decreased 3-fold 4 weeks after HSC-T compared to non-irradiated and non-transplanted controls. Co-transplantation of BMSCs slightly increased mature B cells; however, this was not statistically significant (p < 0.07) (Figure 4D). Several early B cell developmental stages, including proB cells and fraction B and C’ of preB cell development, were significantly increased when BMSCs were combined with HSC-T (Figures 4E–4J and S3A). Inefficient B lymphopoiesis in mice transplanted only with HSCs may be due to stromal damage and reduced production of stroma-derived factors known to support B cell development such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-7, or insulin growth factor (IGF)-1 (Figure 4K; Yu et al., 2016Yu V.W. Lymperi S. Oki T. Jones A. Swiatek P. Vasic R. Ferraro F. Scadden D.T. Distinctive mesenchymal-parenchymal cell pairings govern B cell differentiation in the bone marrow.Stem Cell Reports. 2016; 7: 220-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Consistent with improved B lymphopoises, splenic transitional B cells were significantly increased by BMSC co-transplantation (Figures 4L and S3B–S3G). Functionally, BMSC co-transplantation resulted in increased antigen-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) production in response to immunization with the T cell-independent hapten tri-nitrophenyl (TNP; Figure 4M). These data indicate that new strategies, which improve stromal recovery or limit stromal damage, may provide clinical benefit to HSC-T patients. We next used known surface markers of mesenchymal stroma cells (CD73, CD105, SCA1, CD140a, CD44), to define the engrafting BMSC population. Five days after irradiation and BMSC transplantation, engrafted cells were predominantly CD73hi SCA1hi CD140a+ cells, while CD44 was intermediate, and CD105 expression was absent (Figures 5A and 5B ). The CD73+ CD105– SCA1+ population is rare (around 3%) in BMSCs (Figures 5C and S4B). When the analysis was performed 9 weeks after irradiation, the transplanted cells were still all CD73+ and CD140a intermediate; however, CD105 expression was increased, and SCA1 expression was strongly decreased (Figure 5D). This indicates an initial selection for a rare, engrafting BMSC sub-population upon transplantation, followed by the re-generation of phenotypes present in the initial BMSC population. We used the CFU-F assay to determine the number of clonogenic cells in different BMSC sub-populations. CFU-F activity was confined to the CD73+ population (Figure 5E), which accounts for around 60% of all BMSCs (Figure 5A). Further, CFU-F activity was enriched in the CD105–, the CD44–, and the SCA1+ populations. The marker CD140a (PDGFR) did not correlate with CFU-F activity. By extending this analysis to marker combinations within the CD73+ subpopulation (Figure 5F), the highest CFU-F activity was found among CD73+ CD105– cells, which was in perfect agreement with the phenotype selected in vivo (Figure 5A). Since numerous studies of BM stromal cells are based on in-vitro-expanded cells, we evaluated the expression of the above markers after 2 weeks of in vitro culture starting from purified BMSC subpopulations (Figure S4A). The expression or the absence of CD73 remained stable. Similarly, expression of CD105 was hardly altered upon in vitro culture and only minor fractions (10%–20%) of CD105-defined cells changed their phenotype. In contrast, CD44, CD140a, and SCA1 expression was dynamic whereby negative cells gained marker expression in vitro while the majority of CD140a+ cells lost this marker during culture (Figure S4A). Strikingly, the CD73+ CD105– SCA1+ population, which had the capacity to engraft, was lost upon in vitro expansion (Figure S4B). These findings highlight significant phenotypic changes of BMSCs during in vitro culture, which may explain why these cultured cells fail to support HSC function following irradiation and transplantation. The beneficial effects of BMSC transplantation could be due to transient modulation of the BM microenvironment or to a long-term engraftment of progenitor cells, which reconstitute stromal niches in the BM. We therefore analyzed the long-term maintenance and fate of transplanted BMSCs in vivo. We combined HSC-T with intra-bone delivery of GFP+ BMSCs and measured stromal chimerism in the bone by assessing CFU-F activity (Figure S4C). Four weeks after irradiation/transplantation, stromal progenitors were mainly donor-derived in 66% of animals (n = 15) and even at 6 and 9 weeks half of the animals (n = 16 and 2, respectively) had over 50% of their CFU-F activity derived from GFP+ donor cells (Figure 5G). At 3 months, the frequency of donor-derived CD73+ CD105– SCA1+ cells within the recipient BM stroma still reached around 50% of the level found in in age-matched controls (Figure 5H). Furthermore, their differentiated progeny were frequently observed at 12 and 16 weeks (see below). We next determined whether the transplanted stromal progenitor cells expanded in vivo. Since transplantation selects for the CD73+ CD105– SCA1+ phenotype, we compared the CFU-F within this input population to that re-isolated from the femur 4–9 weeks after transplantation. This revealed that the engrafting BMSC progenitor cells expanded around 6-fold in vivo (n = 28; Figure 5I). Together, this suggested that only a rare CD73+ CD105– SCA1+ population within the BMSCs engrafted, self-renewed, and produced heterogeneous stromal progeny. In order to molecularly characterize the engrafting stromal cells defined herein and to compare them to known stromal stem and progenitor populations, we performed gene expression analysis of freshly isolated Lin– CD73+ CD105– and Lin– CD73+ CD105+ BMSC populations using Affymetrix MoGeneST1.0 arrays (Figure 6A). Published stromal cell types functionally contributing to HSC niches include NESTIN+ and leptin receptor (LEPR)+ skeletal stem cells (SSCs), SP7+ (OSTERIX+) osteoprogenitors, CXCL12+ reticular cells, GFAP+ non-myelinating Schwann cells, and sinusoidal endothelial cells. Some of these niche cell populations are thought to derive from SSCs. Consequently, we compared the gene expression data from engrafting BMSCs to available microarray data of the above stromal subsets and to data from SSCs isolated using lineage reporter transgenes (Ebf2-creERT and Grem1-creERT combined with Rosa26-YFP). In order to reduce the complexity of the data, we merged replicates into single profile representatives of the analyzed population and performed hierarchical clustering after correcting for batch effects. This revealed that stromal cells in the bone can be divided into two major branches with few sub-clusters. SSCs isolated based on Grem1 and Ebf2 transgenes clustered closely (Figure 6A). These cells reportedly show full chondrocyte and osteoblast differentiation potential and EBF2+ cells were found in close proximity to HSCs. A second, closely related sub-cluster of this branch included the CD73+ CD105– cells together with pre-BCSPs (bone cartilage a"

MIR features have implications for the formation of simple and complex rearrangements underlying human pathologies. Maintenance of genomic stability depends on the ability to both prevent formation of DNA damage and to repair damage faithfully. Accurate repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is paramount to avoid structural alterations of the genome. Homologous recombination (HR) repairs DSBs with high fidelity using an intact homologous donor sequence as a template. Yet, multiple mutant contexts have revealed that deregulated HR is prone to generate both chromosomal rearrangements (Kolodner et al., 2002Kolodner R.D. Putnam C.D. Myung K. Maintenance of genome stability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Science. 2002; 297: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) and toxic intermediates that threaten cellular viability (Fabre et al., 2002Fabre F. Chan A. Heyer W.D. Gangloff S. Alternate pathways involving Sgs1/Top3, Mus81/ Mms4, and Srs2 prevent formation of toxic recombination intermediates from single-stranded gaps created by DNA replication.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Homologous recombination is responsible for cell death in the absence of the Sgs1 and Srs2 helicases.Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 192-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Thus, the formidable accuracy of HR is not only an intrinsic property of the core HR machinery but is further enforced by a battery of regulatory activities that reverse intermediates of the pathway prior to final product formation (reviewed in Heyer, 2015Heyer W.D. Regulation of recombination and genomic maintenance.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2015; 7: a016501Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A crucial step of HR is the search for homology performed by a heterotypic nucleoprotein filament composed of the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) flanking the DSB site coated with the prototypical RecA-family recombinase (Rad51 in eukaryotes) and associated proteins (Bell and Kowalczykowski, 2016Bell J.C. Kowalczykowski S.C. RecA: regulation and mechanism of a molecular search engine.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2016; 41: 491-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A combination of in vitro and in vivo single molecule studies provided key insights into the long-lasting conundrum of homology search (Bell and Kowalczykowski, 2016Bell J.C. Kowalczykowski S.C. RecA: regulation and mechanism of a molecular search engine.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2016; 41: 491-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). First, the increased mobility of the broken molecule promotes exploration of the nuclear volume (Dion et al., 2012Dion V. Kalck V. Horigome C. Towbin B.D. Gasser S.M. Increased mobility of double-strand breaks requires Mec1, Rad9 and the homologous recombination machinery.Nat.

Increased chromosome mobility facilitates homology search during recombination.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 510-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Second, the multivalent nature of the RecA/Rad51-ssDNA filament exploits the several hundreds to thousands of nucleotides exposed by resection (Symington, 2016Symington L.S. Mechanism and regulation of DNA end resection in eukaryotes.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2016; 51: 195-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) to simultaneously sample multiple double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), in a model referred to as inter-segmental contact sampling (Forget and Kowalczykowski, 2012Forget A.L. Kowalczykowski S.C. Single-molecule imaging of DNA pairing by RecA reveals a three-dimensional homology search.Nature. 2012; 482: 423-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This search mechanism predicts that, if homology is present on different molecules, one filament may invade (i.e., form heteroduplex DNA within) multiple donors simultaneously. In agreement with this prediction, we uncovered multi-invasion (MI) intermediates in reconstituted in vitro reactions with ssDNA mimicking physiological resection products (Wright and Heyer, 2014Wright W.D. Heyer W.D. Rad54 functions as a heteroduplex DNA pump modulated by its DNA substrates and Rad51 during D loop formation.Mol. Cell. 2014; 53: 420-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Here, we investigate the potential threat to genomic stability posed by the MI byproduct of homology search during HR. We uncovered multi-invasion-induced rearrangements (MIR) wherein two intact dsDNA molecules are translocated upon invasion by a third, broken molecule. We outline its requirements, regulation, consequences for genomic stability, and discuss implications of MIR features for simple and complex rearrangements in other organisms. Using a reconstituted homologous DNA pairing reaction, we previously showed that Rad51 and Rad54 proteins can form higher order joint DNA molecules in addition to the primary, single displacement loop (D-loop) (Wright and Heyer, 2014Wright W.D. Heyer W.D. Rad54 functions as a heteroduplex DNA pump modulated by its DNA substrates and Rad51 during D loop formation.Mol. Cell. 2014; 53: 420-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We interpreted these species as being heteroduplex DNA formed in multiple dsDNA molecules by a single ssDNA. We named these new D-loop intermediates multiple invasions (MIs) (Wright and Heyer, 2014Wright W.D. Heyer W.D. Rad54 functions as a heteroduplex DNA pump modulated by its DNA substrates and Rad51 during D loop formation.Mol. Cell. 2014; 53: 420-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Here, we sought to formally demonstrate the nature of these joint DNA molecule species. First, we performed D-loop reactions using a substrate with 98 bp 5′ and 1,201 nt ssDNA (ds98-1201) (Wright and Heyer, 2014Wright W.D. Heyer W.D. Rad54 functions as a heteroduplex DNA pump modulated by its DNA substrates and Rad51 during D loop formation.Mol. Cell. 2014; 53: 420-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) homologous to donor plasmids of two different sizes (A, A∗), which allows electrophoretic differentiation of each D-loop species (Figure 1A). While each donor gives rise to a specific pattern of single (1°) and MIs (2° and 3°), addition of both donors produces a unique species corresponding to the simultaneous invasion of the A and A∗ donors in addition to the sum of the two independent profiles (Figure 1A, left). The presence of both donors in the A+A∗ MI product was corroborated by Southern blotting using donor-specific probes (Figure 1A, right). Thus, these results demonstrate that the slower migrating joint molecules are MIs, which account for ∼30% of D-loop products. Formation of MIs is not a consequence of the limited pairing length (≈200 nt) permitted by the number of supercoils in our standard donor plasmid, as they also form with a linear dsDNA donor devoid of such topological constraint (Figure S1A). Further, to demonstrate that one molecule of ssDNA can tether two non-related donor sequences, we generated substrates bearing ∼400 nt-long regions of homology to donors A and B (Figure S1B). While addition of either the A or B donor mainly gives rise to a single invasion, simultaneous addition of both donors produces a discrete MI band with supercoiled plasmid (Figures S1B and S1C) or linear dsDNA donors (Figure S1D). Terminal 5′ and 3′ heterologies do not prevent MI formation (Figure S1C). Quantification reveals that MIs are equal to the product of the independent single invasions (Figures 1A and S1D). These results demonstrate that MIs do not form sequentially at the 3′ end, but that invasions can occur internally and independently from one another.Figure S1Long Rad51-ssDNA Filaments Form Multi-invasion on Linear dsDNA In Vitro, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Time course analysis of single and multi-invasion of a linear dsDNA donor (1.5 nM molecules) by the ds98-1201 substrate (0.5 nM molecules).(B) D-loop reactions with chimeric ssDNA substrate (B401-A402, 1 nM molecules) sharing homology with two different sc DNA donors (A and B).(C) Same as in (B) but using a chimeric substrate with heterologous 5′- and 3′ ends (ss141-B402-ss17-A402-ss78; 1 nM molecules).(D) same as in (C) but using two linear dsDNA donors A and B bearing 5′- and 3- terminal heterologies of different length (100 and 200 bp for donor A and 400 and 200 bp for donor B; 1.5 nM molecules).

(A–D) Reaction performed with yeast Rad51, Rad54, and RPA. (A and D) Quantifications show the mean and standard deviation of three independent experiments. Yeast Rad51 has distinct biochemical features compared to human RAD51 (Bugreev and Mazin, 2004Bugreev D.V. Mazin A.V. Ca2+ activates human homologous recombination protein Rad51 by modulating its ATPase activity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 9988-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Therefore, whether human RAD51 and RAD54 proteins could produce MIs was an open question. Using the ds98-1201 substrate in combination with the A and A∗ donors, MIs are formed by the human RAD51 and RAD54 proteins (Figure 1B). Time course analysis revealed that the MI species accumulate with delayed kinetics relative to the primary, single D-loop species, to reach ∼17% of the total invasions (Figure 1C). Interestingly, the migration pattern of the MI species is slightly different from those generated with yeast proteins, possibly reflecting different shaped branched DNA molecules in the MI products. MIs are a newly recognized product of homologous recombination that we demonstrate here with yeast and human Rad51/Rad54. This byproduct of homology search and heteroduplex joint formation tethers together two intact dsDNA donors in a multi-branched intermediate (Figure 1D). These biochemical findings open the possibility that a DSB may lead to recombination between two unbroken donor molecules. To address this possibility, we designed a genetic assay in diploid S. cerevisiae (Figure 2A). A heterozygous DSB-inducible construct replaces the URA3 locus on chromosome V (chrV). The searching molecule is assumed by a “YS” sequence (the central portion of the LYS2 gene, hereafter referred to as YS or YS1000-1000) that is present on only one side of the DSB-inducible site (HOcs). This YS sequence bears ∼1 kb of homology to two donors (“LY” and “S2”) that do not share homology with each other. In our reference strain, these donors replace the LYS2 gene on each chrII homolog in an allelic configuration referred as to “inter-chromosomal”. Translocation of the two donors restores a functional LYS2 gene, resulting in lysine prototrophy (Lys+ cell). The basal and induced Lys+ frequencies are determined for each liquid culture by plating cells onto selective media prior and 2 hr after DSB induction (Figure S2A), when >99% of the molecules are cut (Figure 2B). The basal translocation (Lys+) frequency of ∼3 × 10−7 is independent of the presence of the HO gene (Figure S2B). DSB induction stimulates the translocation frequency by two orders of magnitude to 3.1 × 10−5 (Figures 2C and S2B). Formation of the translocation depends on (1) overlapping homology between the searching molecule and both donors (Figure 2E), (2) the presence of both donors (Figure 2E), and (3) a functional HR pathway (Rad51, Rad52, and Rad54) (Figure 2D). Translocation formation is independent of the key non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) factor Dnl4 (Wilson et al., 1997Wilson T.E. Grawunder U. Lieber M.R. Yeast DNA ligase IV mediates non-homologous DNA end joining.Nature. 1997; 388: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) and is only modestly affected by loss of Pol32, a Polδ subunit required for extensive DNA displacement synthesis that is essential for break-induced replication (BIR) (Lydeard et al., 2007Lydeard J.R. Jain S. Yamaguchi M. Haber J.E. Break-induced replication and telomerase-independent telomere maintenance require Pol32.Nature. 2007; 448: 820-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) (Figure 2D). In all cases, the translocants had restored the LYS2 gene in place of either the LY or the S2 donors on chrII and had repaired the DSB by gene conversion off the intact chrV (see below). These results demonstrate the existence of an HR-dependent mechanism that rearranges two initially intact chromosomes upon DSB induction in a third chromosome.Figure S2A Single Rad51-ssDNA Filament Invades and Causes Translocation of Two Intact Donors in S. cerevisiae, Related to Figures 2 and 3Show full caption(A) Experimental scheme.(B) Translocation frequency in the reference inter-chromosomal strain bearing or not the GAL-HO expression construct.

Interestingly, the translocation does not require homology between the two translocating donors, as LY and S2 do not share homology. To address whether the translocation results from the exact blunt rejoining of the donors or, instead, inserts sequence from the invading ssDNA, we generated a strain bearing a truncated LY donor lacking 200 bp of the 3′ extremity (LY-Δ200bp). The only source of information for this missing sequence is on the broken molecule. This strain exhibits a translocation frequency near identical to the reference LY strain (Figure 2F), demonstrating that the intervening sequence from the broken molecule is inserted at the translocation junction. We conclude that MI-induced rearrangements represent a potential mechanism to generate insertions. As cells undergoing DSB repair by HR are mainly in the S/G2 phase of the cell cycle (Barlow et al., 2008Barlow J.H. Lisby M. Rothstein R. Differential regulation of the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks in G1.Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 73-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), translocations likely result from cells bearing two Rad51-ssDNAs upon DSB induction. Two sets of experiments were conducted to address whether a single ssDNA molecule is sufficient to cause donor translocation. First, we induced DSB formation in G1-arrested cells (STAR Methods). The translocation frequency obtained upon DSB induction in G1-arrested cells was not significantly different from asynchronous cells (Figure 3A). The overall lower Lys+ frequency in this strain compared to wild-type was attributable to loss of MAT heterozygosity (Figure S2C; STAR Methods), a positive regulator of HR in diploids (Heude and Fabre, 1993Heude M. Fabre F. a/alpha-control of DNA repair in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: genetic and physiological aspects.Genetics. 1993; 133: 489-498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To corroborate this result, we triggered translocation in cells lacking the integrated break-inducible construct by transforming a linear dsDNA fragment bearing overlapping homology to the LY and S2 donors (Figure 3B). In this experiment, ≈90% of the transformed cells receive only one linearized molecule (STAR Methods). Transformation triggers normalized translocation frequencies comparable to those obtained with the chromosomally integrated construct (Figure 3B). Control transformations with an intact plasmid or lacking DNA did not yield any Lys+ cells. Southern blot analysis of the translocants confirmed restoration of the LYS2 gene in place of the donors (see below). These two approaches demonstrate that a single broken molecule causes translocation of the homologous donors. We next investigated whether translocation requires two concomitant invasions rather than successive individual invasions. We reasoned that if translocation requires the two invasions to happen in a short time frame, it should be strongly stimulated by (1) a greater homology search capacity conferred by increasing homology length (Forget and Kowalczykowski, 2012Forget A.L. Kowalczykowski S.C. Single-molecule imaging of DNA pairing by RecA reveals a three-dimensional homology search.Nature. 2012; 482: 423-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and (2) the physical proximity of the donors, which will promote invasion of the second donor upon encounter with the first donor. These presuppositions were tested using a series of constructs depicted in Figure 3C. First, translocation frequency increases more than linearly with the length of homology to both donors: a 5-fold decrease of both parts of the “YS” homology (in YS200-200) leads to a 750-fold drop in the translocation frequency. Conversely, lengthening homologies 2-fold (YS2000-2000) increases the translocation frequency 11-fold (Figure 3D). Hence, donor translocation is strongly stimulated by homology length, in stark contrast with the repair of a chromosomal DSB that requires only one invasion and is achieved with maximal efficiency with 200–300 bp of homology (Coïc et al., 2011Coïc E. Martin J. Ryu T. Tay S.Y. Kondev J. Haber J.E. Dynamics of homology searching during gene conversion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed by donor competition.Genetics. 2011; 189: 1225-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, Inbar et al., 2000Inbar O. Liefshitz B. Bitan G. Kupiec M. The relationship between homology length and crossing over during the repair of a broken chromosome.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30833-30838Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, Jinks-Robertson et al., 1993Jinks-Robertson S. Michelitch M. Ramcharan S. Substrate length requirements for efficient mitotic recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3937-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Second, physical tethering between the donors strongly stimulates translocation: the “intra-chromosomal” configuration yields translocation frequencies at least an order of magnitude higher than the inter-chromosomal configuration (Figure 3D). The extent of this increase is more pronounced for molecules harboring shorter homologies and hence more limited homology search capacity: 56-fold with YS200-200, 25-fold with YS1000-1000, and 18-fold with YS2000-2000 (Figure 3D). Astoundingly, the YS2000-2000 substrate with donors in the “intra” configuration reached a translocation frequency of almost 1%. This proximity effect is also significant when one of the donors is positioned ectopically on the same chromatid as the broken molecule (ectopic-cis) rather than on the homolog (ectopic-trans) (Figures 3C and 3E), although much less pronounced than upon tethering of the two donors in the intra configuration. Importantly, the ectopic and the intra-chromosomal donor configurations also rule out a requirement for flanking homologies around the LY and S2 donors for translocation formation. Finally, we addressed possible differential requirements for the internal (Y) versus the DSB-proximal (S) homology region. Interestingly, a 5-fold length reduction of the DSB-proximal homology in YS1000-200 causes a 3.6-fold greater decrease of the translocation frequency than reducing the internal homology in YS200-1000 (Figure 3F). Reversing the orientation of these YS sequence variants indicates that this bias is position-specific, not sequence-specific (Figure S2D). Hence, favoring the formation of the internal over DSB-proximal invasion inhibits translocation. YS1000-200 is expected to perform the internal invasion of the LY donor first in 83% of the cases and only 17% of the case with YS200-1000 (Figure 3H) (Inbar and Kupiec, 1999Inbar O. Kupiec M. Homology search and choice of homologous partner during mitotic recombination.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4134-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We surmised that cleavage of the 3′-proximal, homology-containing flap of the internal invasion product by Rad1-Rad10 (Fishman-Lobell and Haber, 1992Fishman-Lobell J. Haber J.E. Removal of nonhomologous DNA ends in double-strand break recombination: the role of the yeast ultraviolet repair gene RAD1.Science. 1992; 258: 480-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) reduces the potential for MI (Figure 3H) and could account for the difference observed between YS1000-200 and YS200-1000. Consistently, deletion of RAD1 stimulates translocation 6.6-fold with YS1000-200 (p value versus wild-type = 9.5 × 10−3) to the same frequency as YS200-1000, which is induced only 1.5-fold (Figure 3G). Both constructs remain ≈12-fold lower than the reference YS construct, which is induced 2-fold compared to the wild-type strain. Hence, clipping of the Rad51-ssDNA by Rad1-Rad10 upon internal invasion protects against MI and ensuing rearrangements (Figure 3H). These experiments support a mechanism by which one ssDNA molecule causes the translocation of two intact donors in a manner that requires their concomitant invasions. We termed this mechanism MIR. In order to provide physical evidences for MI in cells, we developed “MI-Capture,” a proximity ligation-based assay (de Wit and de Laat, 2012de Wit E. de Laat W. A decade of 3C technologies: insights into nuclear organization.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 11-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) that detects physical tethering of the LY and S2 donors (Figure 3I; STAR Methods). DNA-specific crosslinking of both heteroduplex DNAs constitutive of MI with psoralen leads to the covalent linkage of the LY and S2 donors, held together by the invading molecule. This tethering can be captured upon restriction digestion and ligation in dilute conditions of the unique sequences flanking the donors. The amount of the chimeric molecule produced is determined by quantitative PCR and reflects the amount of MIs in the cell population. This chimera is rare in the absence of DSB induction on chrV (Figure 3J) and likely corresponds to random inter-molecular ligation. Importantly, DSB induction resulted in donor tethering, as evident by chimeric ligation detection at 15-fold over background. This signal resulted from DNA strand invasions as it is reduced to background levels in a rad51Δ mutant. This DSB- and Rad51-dependent donor tethering demonstrates the existence of MI in cells. Fusion of two presumably intact dsDNA donors upon invasion by a ssDNA molecule implies that the linearity of the donors is compromised during the translocation process. Joint DNA molecules are substrates for structure-selective endonucleases (SSEs), which recognize and cleave the structures formed at the boundaries of DNA strand exchange intermediates (Schwartz and Heyer, 2011Schwartz E.K. Heyer W.D. Processing of joint molecule intermediates by structure-selective endonucleases during homologous recombination in eukaryotes.Chromosoma. 2011; 120: 109-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We addressed whether the conserved SSEs Mus81-Mms4, Yen1, and Slx1-Slx4 promote translocation. While single mutants do not significantly decrease translocation frequencies, any double mutant combination yields a significant 2-fold decrease (Figure 4A). This effect is independent of the varying degrees of viability in these strains (Figure S3A). The triple mus81Δ yen1Δ slx1Δ mutant shows a 6-fold decrease in translocation frequency (Figure 4A), not different from the elevated basal level observed in this strain (Figure S3B). Further deletion of RAD1 does not affect either basal or induced translocation frequencies (Figures 4A and S3B). Furthermore, transient overexpression of a catalytic-deficient Mus81-D414A/D415A(dd)/Mms4 caused a 3-fold reduction of the induced translocation frequency (Figure S3A). This dominant-negative behavior suggests that the in"

We asked how ON-OFF direction-selective ganglion cells (ooDSGCs) in mouse retina acquire their bistratified dendrites, in which responses to light onset and light offset are segregated to distinct strata. We found that the transcriptional regulator Satb1 is selectively expressed by ooDSGCs. In Satb1 mutant mice, ooDSGC dendrites lack ON arbors, and the cells selectively lose ON responses. Satb1 regulates expression of a homophilic adhesion molecule, Contactin 5 (Cntn5). Both Cntn5 and its co-receptor Caspr4 are expressed not only by ooDSGCs, but also by interneurons that form a scaffold on which ooDSGC ON dendrites fasciculate. Removing Cntn5 from either ooDSGCs or interneurons partially phenocopies Satb1 mutants, demonstrating that Satb1-dependent Cntn5 expression in ooDSGCs leads to branch-specific homophilic interactions with interneurons. Thus, Satb1 directs formation of a morphologically and functionally specialized compartment within a complex dendritic arbor."
https://openalex.org/W2742660525,"Antipsychotic treatment in patients with schizophrenia often reduces hallucinations and delusions, but cognitive deficits that impair performance of everyday activities may persist or worsen. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which increased NF-κB activity leads to increased HDAC2 levels, impairing synaptic plasticity and memory during prolonged antipsychotic treatment. Antipsychotic drugs remain the standard for schizophrenia treatment. Despite their effectiveness in treating hallucinations and delusions, prolonged exposure to antipsychotic medications leads to cognitive deficits in both schizophrenia patients and animal models. The molecular mechanisms underlying these negative effects on cognition remain to be elucidated. Here we demonstrate that chronic antipsychotic drug exposure increases nuclear translocation of NF-κB in both mouse and human frontal cortex, a trafficking event triggered via 5-HT2A-receptor-dependent downregulation of the NF-κB repressor IκBα. This upregulation of NF-κB activity led to its increased binding at the Hdac2 promoter, thereby augmenting Hdac2 transcription. Deletion of HDAC2 in forebrain pyramidal neurons prevented the negative effects of antipsychotic treatment on synaptic remodeling and cognition. Conversely, virally mediated activation of NF-κB signaling decreased cortical synaptic plasticity via HDAC2. Together, these observations may aid in developing therapeutic strategies to improve the outcome of schizophrenia treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2744896953,"Our objective was to assess the influence of visual flow direction on physiological changes and symptoms elicited by cybersickness. Twelve healthy subjects (6 male and 6 female) were exposed to a 15-min virtual ride on a rollercoaster on two different days in a counterbalanced manner, such half of participants were facing forward during the first ride while another half was facing backward. Forehead skin conductance, heart rate and HRV parameters (SDRR, RMSSD) were collected as objective measures; subjective symptoms were assessed with the Motion Sickness Assessment Questioner immediately after exposure. We found that while nausea ratings at which participants terminated the experiment did not differ between forward/backward rides, the mean ride tolerance time was significantly longer during reverse ride compared to forward ride (6.1±0.4 vs 5.0±0.5 min, respectively, p = 0.01, η2 = 0.45). Analysis of HRV parameters revealed significant reduction in both RMSSD (p = 0.02, t = 2.62, η2 = 0.43) and SDRR (p = 0.01, t = 2.90, η2 = 0.45) in the forward ride; no such changes were found in the backward ride. We also found that amplitude of phasic changes in forehead skin conductance increased significantly in both ride directions. This increase however was significantly lower (p<0.05) in backward ride when compared to the forward ride. When assessed immediately post-ride, subjects reported significantly lower (p = 0.04) subjective symptom intensity after the reverse ride compared to the forward ride. We conclude that the direction of visual flow has a significant effect on the symptoms reported by the subjects and on the physiological changes during cybersickness."

Disruption of genomic imprinting leads to biallelic expression which may affect disease susceptibility possibly reflected in high levels of S-adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH) and low levels of S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM). We investigated the association between folic acid supplementation during pregnancy and loss of imprinting (LOI) of IGF2 and H19 genes in placentas and cord blood of 90 mother-child dyads in association with the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) genotype. Pyrosequencing was used to evaluate deviation from monoallelic expression among 47 placentas heterozygous for H19 and 37 placentas and cord blood tissues heterozygous for IGF2 and H19 methylation levels of 48 placentas. We detected relaxation of imprinting (ROI) and LOI of H19 in placentas not associated with differences in methylation levels of the H19ICR. Placentas retained monoallelic allele-specific gene expression of IGF2, but 32.4% of cord blood samples displayed LOI of IGF2 and 10.8% showed ROI. High SAH levels were significantly associated with low H19 methylation. An interesting positive association between SAM/SAH ratio and high H19 methylation levels was detected among infants with low B12 levels. Our data suggest profound differences in regulation of imprinting in placenta and cord blood; a lack of correlation of the methylome, transcriptome, and proteome; and a complex regulatory feedback network between free methyl groups and genomic imprinting at birth.-Tserga, A., Binder, A.

To better understand antibody affinity/specificity trade-offs, we have selected single-chain antibody fragments specific for the negatively charged and hydrophobic Alzheimer's amyloid β peptide using weak and stringent selections for antibody specificity.

Antibody variants isolated using stringent selections for specificity were also enriched in arginine CDR mutations, but these antibodies possessed significant improvements in specificity. Importantly, the affinities of the most specific antibodies were much less dependent on their arginine mutations, suggesting that over-reliance on arginine for affinity leads to reduced specificity. Structural modeling and molecular simulations reveal unique hydrophobic environments near the arginine CDR mutations. The more specific antibodies contained arginine mutations in the most hydrophobic portions of the CDRs, whereas the less specific antibodies contained arginine mutations in more hydrophilic regions.

https://openalex.org/W2742692441,"To prolong residence on their hosts, ticks secrete many salivary factors that target host defense molecules. In particular, the tick Rhipicephalus sanguineus has been shown to produce three salivary glycoproteins named evasins, which bind to host chemokines, thereby inhibiting the recruitment of leukocytes to the location of the tick bite. Using sequence similarity searches, we have identified 257 new putative evasin sequences encoded by the genomes or salivary or visceral transcriptomes of numerous hard ticks, spanning the genera Rhipicephalus, Amblyomma, and Ixodes of the Ixodidae family. Nine representative sequences were successfully expressed in Escherichia coli, and eight of the nine candidates exhibited high-affinity binding to human chemokines. Sequence alignments enabled classification of the evasins into two subfamilies: C8 evasins share a conserved set of eight Cys residues (four disulfide bonds), whereas C6 evasins have only three of these disulfide bonds. Most of the identified sequences contain predicted secretion leader sequences, N-linked glycosylation sites, and a putative site of tyrosine sulfation. We conclude that chemokine-binding evasin proteins are widely expressed among tick species of the Ixodidae family, are likely to play important roles in subverting host defenses, and constitute a valuable pool of anti-inflammatory proteins for potential future therapeutic applications."

We aim to establish the prevalence of preoperative anemia and distribution of RDW and MCV among pre-surgical patients in Singapore. In addition, we aim to investigate the association between preoperative anemia, RDW and MCV levels with one-year mortality after surgery.Retrospective review of 97,443 patients aged > = 18 years who underwent cardiac and non-cardiac surgeries under anesthesia between January 2012 and October 2016. Patient demographics, comorbidities, priority of surgery, surgical risk classification, perioperative transfusion, preoperative hemoglobin, RDW, MCV were collected. WHO anemia classification was used. High RDW was defined as >15.7%. Multivariate regression analyses were done to identify independent risk factors for mild or moderate/severe anemia and high RDW (>15.7). Multivariate cox regression analysis was done to determine the effect of preoperative anemia, abnormal RDW and MCV values on 1-year mortality.Our cohort comprised of 94.7% non-cardiac and 5.3% cardiac surgeries. 88.7% of patients achieved 1 year follow-up. Anemia prevalence was 27.8%-mild anemia 15.3%, moderate anemia 12.0% and severe anemia 0.5%. One-year mortality was 3.5%.

https://openalex.org/W2744176192,"Eutrophication and climate warming are profoundly affecting fish in many freshwater lakes. Understanding the specific effects of these stressors is critical for development of effective adaptation and remediation strategies for conserving fish populations in a changing environment. Ecological niche models that incorporated the individual effects of nutrient concentration and climate were developed for 25 species of fish sampled in standard gillnet surveys from 1,577 Minnesota lakes. Lake phosphorus concentrations and climates were hindcasted to a pre-disturbance period of 1896-1925 using existing land use models and historical temperature data. Then historical fish assemblages were reconstructed using the ecological niche models. Substantial changes were noted when reconstructed fish assemblages were compared to those from the contemporary period (1981-2010). Disentangling the sometimes opposing, sometimes compounding, effects of eutrophication and climate warming was critical for understanding changes in fish assemblages. Reconstructed abundances of eutrophication-tolerant, warmwater taxa increased in prairie lakes that experienced significant eutrophication and climate warming. Eutrophication-intolerant, warmwater taxa abundance increased in forest lakes where primarily climate warming was the stressor. Coolwater fish declined in abundance in both ecoregions. Large changes in modeled abundance occurred when the effects of both climate and eutrophication operated in the same direction for some species. Conversely, the effects of climate warming and eutrophication operated in opposing directions for other species and dampened net changes in abundance. Quantifying the specific effects of climate and eutrophication will allow water resource managers to better understand how lakes have changed and provide expectations for sustainable fish assemblages in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2743945126,"Compartmentalized signaling in dendritic subdomains is critical for the function of many central neurons. In the retina, individual dendritic sectors of a starburst amacrine cell (SAC) are preferentially activated by different directions of linear motion, indicating limited signal propagation between the sectors. However, the mechanism that regulates this propagation is poorly understood. Here, we find that metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGluR2) signaling, which acts on voltage-gated calcium channels in SACs, selectively restricts cross-sector signal propagation in SACs, but does not affect local dendritic computation within individual sectors. mGluR2 signaling ensures sufficient electrotonic isolation of dendritic sectors to prevent their depolarization during non-preferred motion, yet enables controlled multicompartmental signal integration that enhances responses to preferred motion. Furthermore, mGluR2-mediated dendritic compartmentalization in SACs is important for the functional output of direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs). Therefore, our results directly link modulation of dendritic compartmentalization to circuit-level encoding of motion direction in the retina."

Metabolic parameters, expression of key mRNAs and proteins of hepatic lipid metabolism and autophagy in the vessel wall of mice were determined after the 15-week treatment.A HFD induced atherosclerosis formation and lipid metabolism disorders as well as reduced autophagy expression in the vessel wall of ApoE-knockout mice, but GTP treatment alleviated the lipid metabolism disorders, decreased the oxLDL levels in serum, and increased the mRNA and protein expressions of hepatic PPARα and autophagy markers (LC3, Beclin1 and p62) in the vessel wall of ApoE-knockout mice.Our findings suggest that GTP supplementation showed marked suppression of atherogenesis through improved lipid metabolism as well as through a direct impact on oxLDL and autophagy flux in the vessel wall."
https://openalex.org/W2742228676,"Unacylated ghrelin (UnAG) may lower skeletal muscle oxidative stress, inflammation, and insulin resistance in lean and obese rodents. UnAG-induced autophagy activation may contribute to these effects, likely involving removal of dysfunctional mitochondria (mitophagy) and redox state maintenance. In chronic kidney disease (CKD) oxidative stress, inflammation and insulin resistance may negatively influence patient outcome by worsening nutritional state through muscle mass loss. Here we show in a 5/6 nephrectomy (Nx) CKD rat model that 4 d s.c. UnAG administration (200 µg twice a day) normalizes CKD-induced loss of gastrocnemius muscle mass and a cluster of high tissue mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation, high proinflammatory cytokines, and low insulin signaling activation. Consistent with these results, human uremic serum enhanced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation and lowered insulin signaling activation in C2C12 myotubes while concomitant UnAG incubation completely prevented these effects. Importantly, UnAG enhanced muscle mitophagy in vivo and silencing RNA-mediated autophagy protein 5 silencing blocked UnAG activities in myotubes. UnAG therefore normalizes CKD-induced skeletal muscle oxidative stress, inflammation, and low insulin signaling as well as muscle loss. UnAG effects are mediated by autophagy activation at the mitochondrial level.

https://openalex.org/W2743901020,"The biogenic amine serotonin (5-HT) is an important neuroactive molecule in the central nervous system of the majority of animal phyla. 5-HT binds to specific G protein-coupled and ligand-gated ion receptors to regulate particular aspects of animal behavior. In Drosophila, as in many other insects this includes the regulation of locomotion and feeding. Due to its genetic amenability and neuronal simplicity the Drosophila larva has turned into a useful model for studying the anatomical and molecular basis of chemosensory behaviors. This is particularly true for the olfactory system, which is mostly described down to the synaptic level over the first three orders of neuronal information processing. Here we focus on the 5-HT receptor system of the Drosophila larva. In a bipartite approach consisting of anatomical and behavioral experiments we describe the distribution and the implications of individual 5-HT receptors on naïve and acquired chemosensory behaviors. Our data suggest that 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT7 are dispensable for larval naïve olfactory and gustatory choice behaviors as well as for appetitive and aversive associative olfactory learning and memory. In contrast, we show that 5-HT/5-HT2A signaling throughout development, but not as an acute neuronal function, affects associative olfactory learning and memory using high salt concentration as a negative unconditioned stimulus. These findings describe for the first time an involvement of 5-HT signaling in learning and memory in Drosophila larvae. In the longer run these results may uncover developmental, 5-HT dependent principles related to reinforcement processing possibly shared with adult Drosophila and other insects."

We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 1,023 patients who had both index and surveillance colonoscopy at a single institution. The cumulative occurrence rates of overall and advanced CRN at the time of surveillance colonoscopy were compared between patients with and without NAFLD using propensity score matching analysis. In an analysis of matched cohort of 441 patients, the cumulative rates of overall CRN occurrence at 3 and 5 years after index colonoscopy were higher in subjects with NAFLD than in those without NAFLD (9.1% vs. 5.0% & 35.2% vs. 25.3%, P = 0.01). Cox regression analysis showed that NAFLD independently increased the risk of overall CRN occurrence with marginal significance (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.31 95% CI: 1.01–1.71, P = 0.05). Additionally, NAFLD was associated with the development of 3 or more adenomas at the time of surveillance colonoscopy (aHR: 2.49, 95% CI: 1.20–5.20, P = 0.02). In subgroup analysis based on index colonoscopy risk categories, the effect of NAFLD on the overall CRN occurrence at the time of surveillance colonoscopy was confined to the normal group (aHR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.05–2.06, P = 0.02). Regarding advanced CRN occurrences at the time of surveillance colonoscopy, age was the only significant risk factor (aHR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.02–1.10, P = 0.001). NAFLD was associated with overall CRN occurrence, especially in patients with no adenoma at the index colonoscopy.

https://openalex.org/W2744517940,"Shortwave solar radiation is an important component of the surface energy balance and provides the principal source of energy for terrestrial ecosystems. This paper presents a machine learning approach in the form of a random forest (RF) model for estimating daily downward solar radiation flux at the land surface over complex terrain using MODIS (MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) remote sensing data. The model-building technique makes use of a unique network of 16 solar flux measurements in the semi-arid Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed and Critical Zone Observatory, in southwest Idaho, USA. Based on a composite RF model built on daily observations from all 16 sites in the watershed, the model simulation of downward solar radiation matches well with the observation data (r2 = 0.96). To evaluate model performance, RF models were built from 12 of 16 sites selected at random and validated against the observations at the remaining four sites. Overall root mean square errors (RMSE), bias, and mean absolute error (MAE) are small (range: 37.17 W/m2-81.27 W/m2, -48.31 W/m2-15.67 W/m2, and 26.56 W/m2-63.77 W/m2, respectively). When extrapolated to the entire watershed, spatiotemporal patterns of solar flux are largely consistent with expected trends in this watershed. We also explored significant predictors of downward solar flux in order to reveal important properties and processes controlling downward solar radiation. Based on the composite RF model built on all 16 sites, the three most important predictors to estimate downward solar radiation include the black sky albedo (BSA) near infrared band (0.858 μm), BSA visible band (0.3-0.7 μm), and clear day coverage. This study has important implications for improving the ability to derive downward solar radiation through a fusion of multiple remote sensing datasets and can potentially capture spatiotemporally varying trends in solar radiation that is useful for land surface hydrologic and terrestrial ecosystem modeling."
https://openalex.org/W2766985524,"Coordinating spatial perception between body space and its external surrounding space is essential to adapt behaviors to objects, especially when they are noxious. Such coherent multisensory representation of the body extended into external space is conceptualized by the notion of peripersonal reference frame, mapping the portion of space in which somatic and extra-somatic inputs interact closely. Studies on crossmodal interactions between nociception and vision have been scarce. Here we investigated how the perception of visual stimuli, especially those surrounding the body, can be impacted by a nociceptive and potentially harmful stimulus inflicted on a particular body part. In two temporal order judgment tasks, participants judged which of two lateralized visual stimuli, presented either near or far from the body, had been presented first. Visual stimuli were preceded by nociceptive stimuli, either applied unilaterally (on one single hand) or bilaterally (on both hands simultaneously). In Experiment 1 participants’ hands were always placed next to the visual stimuli presented near the trunk, while in Experiment 2 they could also be placed next to the visual stimuli presented far from the trunk. In Experiment 1, the presence of unilateral nociceptive stimuli prioritized the perception of visual stimuli presented in the same side of space as the stimulated hand, with a significantly larger effect when visual stimuli were presented near the body than when presented farther away. Experiment 2 showed that these visuospatial biases were related to the spatial congruency between the hand on which nociceptive stimuli were applied and the visual stimuli, independently of the relative distance of both the stimulated hand and the visual stimuli from the trunk. Indeed, nociceptive stimuli mostly impacted the perception of the closest visual stimuli. It is hypothesized that these crossmodal interactions may rely on representations of the space directly surrounding specific body parts."

Animal models demonstrate that the impact of the early life environment extends to subsequent generations, but there is a paucity of data from human populations on intergenerational transmission of environmentally induced phenotypes. Here we investigated the association of parental exposure to energy and nutrient restriction in utero on their children's growth in rural Gambia. In a Gambian cohort with infants born between 1972 and 2011, we used multiple regression to test whether parental season of birth predicted offspring birth weight (n = 2097) or length (n = 1172), height-for-age z score (HAZ), weight-for-height z score (WHZ), and weight-for-age z score (WAZ) at 2 yr of age (n = 923). We found that maternal exposure to seasonal energy restriction in utero was associated with reduced offspring birth length (crude:-4.2 mm, P = 0.005; adjusted: -4.0 mm, P = 0.02). In contrast, paternal birth season predicted offspring HAZ at 24 mo (crude: -0.21, P = 0.005; adjusted: -0.22, P = 0.004) but had no discernible impact at birth.

The investigated plants were subjected to a control, hypoxia, 0.1mM NaHS, 0.5 mM NaHS, 0.1 mM NaHS+hypoxia and 0.5 mM NaHS+hypoxia conditions. All experimental plants grew optimally under control, hypoxic and NaHS conditions in comparison to that grown in the combined exposure of hypoxia and hydrogen sulfide. For P. crispus and M. spicatum, significant decreases of total chlorophyll and increases in oxidative stress (measured by hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, and malondialdehyde, MDA) were observed with exposure to both sulfide concentrations. However, the decrease in catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) from exposure to 0.5 mM NaHS suggests that the function of the protective enzymes reached their limit under these conditions. In contrast, for E. densa and P. oxyphyllus, the higher activities of the three antioxidative enzymes and their anaerobic respiration abilities (ADH activity) resulted in higher tolerance and susceptibility under high sulfide concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2743480059,"Insulin resistance and β cell failure are the main causes of elevated blood glucose levels in Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a complex and multifactorial metabolic disease. Several medications to treat or reduce the symptoms of T2DM are used, including the injection of insulin and the application of insulin sensitizing or glucose production reducing drugs. Furthermore, the use of phytochemicals has attracted increasing attention for the therapy and prevention of T2DM. In order to identify and characterize antidiabetic compounds, efficient test systems are required. Here we present a modified chick embryo model (hens egg test, HET), which has originally been developed to determine the potential irritancy of chemicals, as a versatile tool for the characterization of phytochemicals with antidiabetic properties. We termed this modified assay variation Gluc-HET. More precisely, we determined the influence of variations in the incubation time of the fertilized eggs and studied the effects of different buffer parameters, such as the temperature, composition and volume, used for drug application. In addition, we tested several putative antidiabetic plant extracts, which have been identified in an in-vitro primary screening procedure, for their effectiveness in reducing blood glucose levels in-ovo. Taken together, our Gluc-HET model has proven to be a reliable and manageable system for the characterization of antidiabetic compounds."

The aim of this prospective observational study was to determine the predictive value of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) B cell subtypes in disease evolution of patients with MS.128 patients were included between 2004 and 2012. Median follow up time was 7.9 years (range 3.3-10.8 years). 10 patients were lost to follow-up. 32 clinically isolated syndrome- (CIS), 25 relapsing remitting MS- (RRMS), 2 secondary progressive MS- (SPMS) and 9 primary progressive MS- (PPMS) patients were included. The control group consisted of 40 patients with other neurological diseases (OND). CSF samples were analyzed for routine diagnostic parameters. B cell phenotypes were characterized by flow cytometry using CD19 and CD138 specific antibodies. Standardized baseline brain MRI was conducted at the time of diagnostic lumbar puncture. Main outcome variables were likelihood of progressive disease course, EDSS progression, conversion to clinical definite MS (CDMS) and relapse rate.CSF mature B cells (CD19+CD138-) were increased in bout-onset MS compared to PPMS (p<0.05) and OND (p<0.001), whereas plasma blasts (CD19+CD138+) were increased in bout-onset MS (p<0.001) and PPMS (p<0.05) compared to OND. CSF B cells did not predict a progressive disease course, EDSS progression, an increased relapse rate or the conversion to CDMS. Likelihood of progressive disease course (p<0.05) and EDSS (p<0.01) was predicted by higher age at baseline, whereas conversion to CDMS was predicted by a lower age at onset (p<0.01) and the presence of ≥9 MRI T2 lesions (p<0.05).We detected significant differences in the CSF B cell subsets between different clinical MS subtypes and OND patients. CSF B cells were neither predictive for disease and EDSS progression nor conversion to CDMS after a CIS."
https://openalex.org/W2744168624,"Mitochondrial kinase PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) and E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin function in a common pathway to regulate mitochondrial homeostasis contributing to the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease. The carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) acts as a heat shock protein 70/heat shock protein 90 cochaperone to mediate protein folding or as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to target proteins for degradation. In this study, overexpression of Drosophila CHIP suppressed a range of Pink1 mutant phenotypes in flies, including abnormal wing posture, thoracic indentation, locomotion defects, muscle degeneration, and loss of dopaminergic neurons. Mitochondrial defects of Pink1 mutant, such as excessive fusion, reduced ATP content, and crista disorganization, were rescued by CHIP but not its ligase-dead mutants. Similar phenotypes and mitochondrial impairment were ameliorated in Parkin mutant flies by wild-type CHIP. Inactivation of CHIP with null fly mutants resulted in mitochondrial defects, such as reduced thoracic ATP content at 3 d old, decreased thoracic mitochondrial DNA content, and defective mitochondrial morphology at 60 d old. CHIP mutants did not exacerbate the phenotypes of Pink1 mutant flies but markedly shortened the life span of Parkin mutant flies. These results indicate that CHIP is involved in mitochondrial integrity and may act downstream of Pink1 in parallel with Parkin.-Chen, J., Xue, J., Ruan, J., Zhao, J., Tang, B., Duan, R. Drosophila CHIP protects against mitochondrial dysfunction by acting downstream of Pink1 in parallel with Parkin."
https://openalex.org/W2742874574,"Eye movements provide insights into what people pay attention to, and therefore are commonly included in a variety of human-computer interaction studies. Eye movement recording devices (eye trackers) produce gaze trajectories, that is, sequences of gaze location on the screen. Despite recent technological developments that enabled more affordable hardware, gaze data are still costly and time consuming to collect, therefore some propose using mouse movements instead. These are easy to collect automatically and on a large scale. If and how these two movement types are linked, however, is less clear and highly debated. We address this problem in two ways. First, we introduce a new movement analytics methodology to quantify the level of dynamic interaction between the gaze and the mouse pointer on the screen. Our method uses volumetric representation of movement, the space-time densities, which allows us to calculate interaction levels between two physically different types of movement. We describe the method and compare the results with existing dynamic interaction methods from movement ecology. The sensitivity to method parameters is evaluated on simulated trajectories where we can control interaction levels. Second, we perform an experiment with eye and mouse tracking to generate real data with real levels of interaction, to apply and test our new methodology on a real case. Further, as our experiment tasks mimics route-tracing when using a map, it is more than a data collection exercise and it simultaneously allows us to investigate the actual connection between the eye and the mouse. We find that there seem to be natural coupling when eyes are not under conscious control, but that this coupling breaks down when instructed to move them intentionally. Based on these observations, we tentatively suggest that for natural tracing tasks, mouse tracking could potentially provide similar information as eye-tracking and therefore be used as a proxy for attention. However, more research is needed to confirm this."
https://openalex.org/W2742538226,"To identify the consumption of alcoholic beverage and the relation with hypertension, their prevalence and associated factors, in indigenous Mura, Brazil.A cross-sectional population-based study was conducted with 455 adult indigenous aged 18 years or more of Mura ethnics in Amazonia, Brazil. Interview was conducted and the alcohol intake was assessed by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. Blood pressure was measured in three measurements and the mean of the last two measurements was used. Physical examination included the following data: weight, height, waist and neck circumference, bioimpedance, and capillary measurement of glucose, triglycerides and cholesterol. Through multivariate Logistic regression in stepwise, the odds ratios for alcohol consumption and associated factors were identified.The prevalence of alcoholic beverage was 40.2%, with no significant difference for hypertension in those who drink (23.0%) and those who did not drink (29.0%). Referred hypertension in indigenous was associated to less use of alcoholic beverages (14.2% vs 24.3%, P = 0.009). After an adjusted analysis (Odds Ratio, 95% CI), there was a positive association between alcoholic drink intake and male sex (10.27, CI: 5.76-18.30), smoking (4.72, CI: 2.35-9.46) and live in rural areas (9.77, CI: 5.08-18.79). On the other hand, age (0.95, IC: 0.94-0.97), and absence of dyslipidemia (0.41, CI: 0.19-0.89) were associated to lower alcohol consumption.The prevalence of alcoholic beverage was high and associated with referred hypertension, but this association was not maintained after adjusted analysis. Changes to habits and inappropriate lifestyles in indigenous populations and living in urban areas may contribute to increase risk for cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, health policies should be implemented to meet the uniqueness of indigenous people."

https://openalex.org/W2744822081,"Albinism, a phenomenon characterized by pigmentation deficiency on the ocular side of Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), has caused significant damage. Limited mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) information is available on fish pigmentation deficiency. In this study, a high-throughput sequencing strategy was employed to identify the mRNA and miRNAs involved in P. olivaceus albinism. Based on P. olivaceus genome, RNA-seq identified 21,787 know genes and 711 new genes by transcripts assembly. Of those, 235 genes exhibited significantly different expression pattern (fold change ≥2 or ≤0.5 and q-value≤0.05), including 194 down-regulated genes and 41 up-regulated genes in albino versus normally pigmented individuals. These genes were enriched to 81 GO terms and 9 KEGG pathways (p≤0.05). Among those, the pigmentation related pathways-Melanogenesis and tyrosine metabolism were contained. High-throughput miRNA sequencing identified a total of 475 miRNAs, including 64 novel miRNAs. Furthermore, 33 differentially expressed miRNAs containing 13 up-regulated and 20 down-regulated miRNAs were identified in albino versus normally pigmented individuals (fold change ≥1.5 or ≤0.67 and p≤0.05). The next target prediction discovered a variety of putative target genes, of which, 134 genes including Tyrosinase (TYR), Tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1), Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) were overlapped with differentially expressed genes derived from RNA-seq. These target genes were significantly enriched to 254 GO terms and 103 KEGG pathways (p<0.001). Of those, tyrosine metabolism, lysosomes, phototransduction pathways, etc., attracted considerable attention due to their involvement in regulating skin pigmentation. Expression patterns of differentially expressed mRNA and miRNAs were validated in 10 mRNA and 10 miRNAs by qRT-PCR. With high-throughput mRNA and miRNA sequencing and analysis, a series of interested mRNA and miRNAs involved in fish pigmentation are identified. And the miRNA-mRNA regulatory network also provides a solid starting point for further elucidation of fish pigmentation deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2742280273,"In this study, the impact of infection stage on clinically and microbiologically efficacious doses and on antibiotic consumption was assessed during a naturally evolving infectious disease, using an original mouse model of pulmonary infection produced by air-borne contamination. When Pasteurella multocida was administered as pathogenic agent to immunocompetent mice, 60% of the animals exhibited clinical symptoms of pneumonia 2 to 4 days after bacterial contamination of the lungs. Two beta-lactam antibiotics were evaluated: amoxicillin and cefquinome, a fourth generation cephalosporin developed for food animals. First, a pharmacokinetic study was performed in infected mice to determine the exposure to amoxicillin or cefquinome required to treat clinically affected animals, based on the targeted values of PK/PD indices for beta-lactams. We then confirmed that these doses resulted in a 100% clinical cure rate in animals exhibiting clinical signs of infection and harboring a high pathogenic inoculum. More interestingly, we also showed that the same 100% clinical cure could be obtained in our model with 10-fold lower doses in animals at pre-patent stages of infection i.e. when harboring a low pathogenic inoculum. At the group level, antimicrobial drug consumption was reduced by treating animals at an early stage of the infection course with a pre-patent tailored dose. These results suggest that early treatment with a dose suitably adjusted to the stage of infection might help to reduce both overall antibiotic consumption and resistance selection pressure in the animals and in the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2742790422,"Objectives Life after severe burns is conditioned by the remaining sequelae. The pathophysiology and risk factors of Heterotopic Ossification (HO) after burns are still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to determine: 1) the incidence of HO after burns and 2) the risk factors associated with HO development, in a large retrospective study. Methods A case-control study of patients admitted to the burns intensive care unit of Percy Hospital, Paris, from the 1st January 2009 to the 31st December 2013 and then admitted to one of three centres specialised in the rehabilitation of patients with burns. Multivariate analysis was carried out to analyse the relationship between HO development and demographic and clinical data. Results 805 patients were included. 32 patients (4.0%) developed a total of 74 heterotopic ossifications, that is a little higher incidence than the incidence found in the literature. The epidemiological characteristics of the population studied was similar to the literature. HOs were mainly localized around the elbows, followed by the hips, shoulders and knees. Each case-patient was paired with 3 control-patients. There were significant associations between HO development and the length of stay in the burns intensive care unit, the extent and depth of the burns, the occurrence of pulmonary or cutaneous infections, use of curare and use of an air-fluidized bed. Conclusion In addition to recognized risk factors (duration of stay in the intensive care burns unit, extent and depth of burns, pulmonary and cutaneous infections), the use of curare and the use of a fluidized bed (with the duration of use) were significantly associated with HO formation."
https://openalex.org/W2744395836,"Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a pleiotropic, Th17-derived cytokine thought to critically contribute to the pathogenesis of diverse autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Treatment with monoclonal antibodies that block GM-CSF activity is associated with favorable therapeutic effects in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. We evaluated the role of GM-CSF as a potential target for therapeutic interference in psoriasis using a combined pharmacologic and genetic approach and the mouse model of imiquimod-induced psoriasiform dermatitis (IMQPD). Neutralization of murine GM-CSF by an anti-GM-CSF antibody ameliorated IMQPD. In contrast, genetic deficiency in GM-CSF did not alter the course of IMQPD, suggesting the existence of mechanisms compensating for chronic, but not acute, absence of GM-CSF. Further investigation uncovered an alternative pathogenic pathway for IMQPD in the absence of GM-CSF characterized by an expanded plasmacytoid dendritic cell population and release of IFNα and IL-22. This pathway was not activated in wild-type mice during short-term anti-GM-CSF treatment. Our investigations support the potential value of GM-CSF as a therapeutic target in psoriatic disease. The discovery of an alternative pathogenic pathway for psoriasiform dermatitis in the permanent absence of GM-CSF, however, suggests the need for monitoring during therapeutic use of long-term GM-CSF blockade."
https://openalex.org/W2744524440,"Despite threats to human wellbeing from ecological degradation, public engagement with this issue remains at low levels. However, studies have shown that crafting messages to resonate with people’s personal experiences can enhance engagement. Recreational fishing is one of the principal ways in which people interact with aquatic environments, but long-term data from this perspective are considered rare. We uncovered 852 popular media records of recreational fishing for an Australian estuary across a 140-year period. Using information contained in these articles we analysed the species composition of recreational catches over time and constructed two distinct time series of catch and effort (n fish fisher-1 trip-1; kg fish fisher-1 trip-1) for recreational fishing trips and fishing club competitions (mean n and kg fish caught across all competitors, and n and kg fish caught by the competition winner). Reported species composition remained similar over time. Catch rates reported from recreational fishing trips (1900–1998) displayed a significant decline, averaging 32.5 fish fisher-1 trip-1 prior to 1960, and 18.8 fish fisher-1 trip-1 post-1960. Mean n fish fisher-1 competition-1 (1913–1983) also significantly declined, but best n fish fisher-1 competition-1 (1925–1980) displayed no significant change, averaging 31.2 fish fisher-1 competition-1 over the time series. Mean and best kg fish fisher-1 competition-1 trends also displayed no significant change, averaging 4.2 and 9.9 kg fisher-1 competition-1, respectively. These variable trends suggest that while some fishers experienced diminishing returns in this region over the last few decades, the most skilled inshore fishers were able to maintain their catch rates, highlighting the difficulties inherent in crafting conservation messages that will resonate with all sections of a community. Despite these challenges, this research demonstrates that popular media sources can provide multiple long-term trends at spatial scales, in units and via a recreational experience that many people can relate to."
https://openalex.org/W2743579100,"Bacteria can rapidly evolve mechanisms allowing them to use toxic environmental pollutants as a carbon source. In the current study we examined whether the survival and evolution of indigenous bacteria with the capacity to degrade organic pollutants could be connected with increased mutation frequency. The presence of constitutive and transient mutators was monitored among 53 pollutants-degrading indigenous bacterial strains. Only two strains expressed a moderate mutator phenotype and six were hypomutators, which implies that constitutively increased mutability has not been prevalent in the evolution of pollutants degrading bacteria. At the same time, a large proportion of the studied indigenous strains exhibited UV-irradiation-induced mutagenesis, indicating that these strains possess error-prone DNA polymerases which could elevate mutation frequency transiently under the conditions of DNA damage. A closer inspection of two Pseudomonas fluorescens strains PC20 and PC24 revealed that they harbour genes for ImuC (DnaE2) and more than one copy of genes for Pol V. Our results also revealed that availability of other nutrients in addition to aromatic pollutants in the growth environment of bacteria affects mutagenic effects of aromatic compounds. These results also implied that mutagenicity might be affected by a factor of how long bacteria have evolved to use a particular pollutant as a carbon source."
https://openalex.org/W2744163213,"A priori registration of randomized clinical trials is crucial to the transparency and credibility of their findings. Aim of this study was to assess the frequency with which registered and completed randomized trials in orthodontics are published. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and ISRCTN for registered randomized clinical trials in orthodontics that had been completed up to January 2017 and judged the publication status and date of registered trials using a systematic protocol. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, chi-square or Fisher exact tests, and Kaplan-Meier survival estimates. From the 266 orthodontic trials registered up to January 2017, 80 trials had been completed and included in the present study. Among these 80 included trials, the majority (76%) were registered retrospectively, while only 33 (41%) were published at the time. The median time from completion to publication was 20.1 months (interquartile range: 9.1 to 31.6 months), while survival analysis indicated that less than 10% of the trials were published after 5 years from their completion. Finally, 22 (28%) of completed trials remain unpublished even after 5 years from their completion. Publication rates of registered randomized trials in orthodontics remained low, even 5 years after their completion date."

All de-novo (first lung-cancer occurrence) stage IIIA-IV patients, as well as de-novo stage IV subset was analyzed. Multi-state modeling (MSM) and a Cox PH regression model with propensity score weights adjusted for clinicopathological variables between: diagnosis and PD and PD to death.123 stage IIIA-IV patients were identified with 104 meeting RECIST-1.1-PD criteria. This RECIST-1.1-PD criteria subset included females (64.6%), Asians (39.4%), never/non-smokers (55.8%), and exon 19 deletion carriers (44.2%). Commonest treatment beyond initial-PD was continuing TKI alone (46/104), with another 21 patients continuing TKI plus additional systemic therapy. The median OS for patients who continued TKI treatment at initial-PD was 21.1 months versus 15.6 months for patients who discontinued TKI, p = 0.006. Via MSM analysis, continuing TKI at initial-PD followed by other systemic therapy was associated with an 83% reduced death risk, adjusted HR: 0.17 (95% CI: 0.07, 0.39). In the Cox PH model, ever-smokers with an exon 19 deletion had increased risk of death after PD (adjusted HR: 3.19, 95% CI: 1.54, 6.58), as did exon 21 mutation carriers, (adjusted HR: 2.10, 95% CI: 1.10, 4.00) and females (adjusted HR: 3.19, 95% CI: 1.54, 6.58).Subsequent systemic therapy after continuing TKI at initial-PD reduced the risk of death. Additionally, our data suggest that positive smoking history increases death risk for some EGFR mutation types and females."
https://openalex.org/W2744417474,"Photoproteins are responsible for light emission in a variety of marine ctenophores and coelenterates. The mechanism of light emission in both families occurs via the same reaction. However, the arrangement of amino acid residues surrounding the chromophore, and the catalytic mechanism of light emission is unknown for the ctenophore photoproteins. In this study, we used quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) and site-directed mutagenesis studies to investigate the details of the catalytic mechanism in berovin, a member of the ctenophore family. In the absence of a crystal structure of the berovin-substrate complex, molecular docking was used to determine the binding mode of the protonated (2-hydroperoxy) and deprotonated (2-peroxy anion) forms of the substrate to berovin. A total of 13 mutants predicted to surround the binding site were targeted by site-directed mutagenesis which revealed their relative importance in substrate binding and catalysis. Molecular dynamics simulations and MM-PBSA (Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann/surface area) calculations showed that electrostatic and polar solvation energy are +115.65 and -100.42 kcal/mol in the deprotonated form, respectively. QM/MM calculations and pKa analysis revealed the deprotonated form of substrate is unstable due to the generation of a dioxetane intermediate caused by nucleophilic attack of the substrate peroxy anion at its C3 position. This work also revealed that a hydrogen bonding network formed by a D158- R41-Y204 triad could be responsible for shuttling the proton from the 2- hydroperoxy group of the substrate to bulk solvent."

Claudins are major determinants of TJ permeability. Claudin-4 was the first claudin whose involvement in the TJ permeability in cultured cells was directly demonstrated, but the permeability properties of individual claudins including claudin-4 are still incompletely clarified. In this study, we established claudin-4 knockout cells using transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), a recently developed method for genome editing, and investigated the permeability property of claudin-4 in MDCK II cells. We found that claudin-4 knockout has no apparent effect on the localization of other claudins and electrophysiological properties in MDCK II cells. Therefore we further established claudin-2 and claudin-4 double knockout clones and investigated the effects on TJs. Claudin-4 knockout in addition to claudin-2 knockout slightly increased the localization of other claudins at TJs but showed no obvious effects on the electrophysiological properties in MDCK II cells. These results indicate that claudin-4 is dispensable for the barrier property of TJs in wild-type as well as claudin-2 knockout MDCK II cells.

To develop an appropriate method to control Aurelia sp.1 blooms, the toxic effects of tea saponin on Aurelia sp.1 ephyrae and polyps were tested in laboratory experiments. Our results revealed that tea saponin caused significant morphological changes, behavioral abnormality and mortality in Aurelia sp.1 ephyrae and polyps in 24 h and 48 h exposure experiments. The 24 h and 48 h median lethal concentrations (LC50) values of tea saponin for Aurelia sp.1 ephyrae were 1.9 and 1.1 mg L-1 respectively, while the LC50 value for Aurelia sp.1 polyps was 0.4 mg L-1 after 24h and 48 h of exposure to tea saponin. Comparison with literature results of tea saponin on A. japonicus indicates that the resistance of A. japonicus to tea saponin is 12–18 times greater than that of Aurelia sp.1 ephyrae. Therefore, the appropriate tea saponin dosage for the control of Aurelia sp.1 should be paid enough attention in order to minimize possible damage for sea cucumber. We suggest that the recommended level of tea saponin to eradicate Aurelia sp.1 ephyrae and polyps in sea cucumber culture ponds be lower than 1.35 mg L-1."

To investigate the compatibility of cIFs in arthropods, we expressed human vimentin (hVim), a cIF with filament-forming capacity in vertebrate cells and tissues, transgenically in Drosophila Transgenic hVim could be recovered from whole-fly lysates by using a standard procedure for intermediate filament (IF) extraction. When this procedure was used to test for the possible presence of IF-like proteins in flies, only lamins and tropomyosin were observed in IF-enriched extracts, thereby providing biochemical reinforcement to the paradigm that arthropods lack cIFs. In Drosophila, transgenic hVim was unable to form filament networks in S2 cells and mesenchymal tissues; however, cage-like vimentin structures could be observed around the nuclei in internal epithelia, which suggests that Drosophila retains selective competence for filament formation. Taken together, our results imply that although the filament network formation competence is partially lost in Drosophila, a rudimentary filament network formation ability remains in epithelial cells. As a result of the observed selective competence for cIF assembly in Drosophila, we hypothesize that internal epithelial cIFs were the last cIFs to disappear from arthropods.-Gullmets, J., Torvaldson, E., Lindqvist, J., Imanishi, S.

Although the kidney expresses all 4 EHD proteins, their physiologic roles are largely unknown. This study focused on EHD4, which we found to be expressed differentially across nephron segments with the highest expression in the inner medullary collecting duct. Under baseline conditions, Ehd4-/- [EHD4-knockout (KO)] mice on a C57Bl/6 background excreted a higher volume of more dilute urine than control C57Bl/6 wild-type (WT) mice while maintaining a similar plasma osmolality. Urine excretion after an acute intraperitoneal water load was significantly increased in EHD4-KO mice compared to WT mice, and although EHD4-KO mice concentrated their urine during 24-h water restriction, urinary osmolality remained significantly lower than in WT mice, suggesting that EHD4 plays a role in renal water handling. Total aquaporin 2 (AQP2) and phospho-S256-AQP2 (pAQP2) protein expression in the inner medulla was similar in the two groups in baseline conditions. However, localization of both AQP2 and pAQP2 in the renal inner medullary principal cells appeared more dispersed, and the intensity of apical membrane staining for AQP2 was reduced significantly (by ∼20%) in EHD4-KO mice compared to WT mice in baseline conditions, suggesting an important role of EHD4 in trafficking of AQP2. Together, these data indicate that EHD4 play important roles in the regulation of water homeostasis.-Rahman, S. S., Moffitt, A. E. J., Trease, A. J., Foster, K. W., Storck, M.

https://openalex.org/W2743458256,"This study proposes a method for classifying event-related fMRI responses in a specialized setting of many known but few unknown stimuli presented in a rapid event-related design. Compared to block design fMRI signals, classification of the response to a single or a few stimulus trial(s) is not a trivial problem due to contamination by preceding events as well as the low signal-to-noise ratio. To overcome such problems, we proposed a single trial-based classification method of rapid event-related fMRI signals utilizing sparse multivariate Bayesian decoding of spatio-temporal fMRI responses. We applied the proposed method to classification of memory retrieval processes for two different classes of episodic memories: a voluntarily conducted experience and a passive experience induced by watching a video of others' actions. A cross-validation showed higher classification performance of the proposed method compared to that of a support vector machine or of a classifier based on the general linear model. Evaluation of classification performances for one, two, and three stimuli from the same class and a correlation analysis between classification accuracy and target stimulus positions among trials suggest that presenting two target stimuli at longer inter-stimulus intervals is optimal in the design of classification experiments to identify the target stimuli. The proposed method for decoding subject-specific memory retrieval of voluntary behavior using fMRI would be useful in forensic applications in a natural environment, where many known trials can be extracted from a simulation of everyday tasks and few target stimuli from a crime scene."
