Ligation of RAGE by two other ligands, advanced glycation end products or amyloid β-peptide, is suggested to play a role in cell injury mechanisms involving cellular oxidant stress and activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. However, the RAGE signaling pathways in neurite outgrowth and cell injury are largely unknown. Here we show that transfection of RAGE to neuroblastoma cells induces extension of filopodia and neurites on amphoterin-coated substrates. Furthermore, ligation of RAGE in transfected cells enhances NF-κB-dependent transcription. Both the RAGE-mediated neurite outgrowth and activation of NF-κB are blocked by deletion of the cytoplasmic domain of RAGE. Moreover, dominant negative Rac and Cdc42 but not dominant negative Ras inhibit the extension of neurites induced by RAGE-amphoterin interaction. In contrast, the activation of NF-κB is inhibited by dominant negative Ras but not Rac or Cdc42. These data suggest that distinct signaling pathways are used by RAGE to induce neurite outgrowth and regulate gene expression through NF-κB.

Advanced glycation end products (AGE) resulting from nonenzymatic glycation of proteins and lipids accumulate during normal aging and at an accelerated rate in diabetes (4Brownlee M. Cerami A.

In diabetes, hyperglycemia-driven accumulation of AGEs has been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic vascular disease. The interaction of AGEs with RAGE, one of their cell-surface receptors, results in perturbation of a variety of vascular homeostatic functions and has been shown to play a major role in the development of diabetic vasculopathy (7Schmidt A.M.

In Alzheimer's disease, deposition of amyloid β-peptide containing plaques in the brain correlates with progressive neuronal dysfunction leading to dementia (10Yankner B.A. Duffy L.K. Kirschner D.A.

Extracellular amyloid β-peptide induces neuronal cell death presumably by interaction with cell-surface receptors. Neuronal RAGE has been shown to interact with amyloid β-peptide resulting in cellular oxidant stress and activation of NF-κB (12Yan S.D. Chen X. Fu J. Chen M. Zhu H. Roher A. Slattery T. Zhao L.

Moreover, ligation of neuronal RAGE by amyloid β-peptide has been shown to trigger a proinflammatory pathway leading to activation of microglial cells in Alzheimer's disease (13Du Y.S. Zhu H. Fu J.

Amphoterin is a heparin-binding, neurite outgrowth-promoting protein isolated from neonatal rat brain (14Rauvala H. Pihlaskari R. J. Biol.

Amphoterin is abundantly expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems during the later phases of embryonic development (14Rauvala H. Pihlaskari R. J. Biol.

Furthermore, anti-RAGE F(ab′)2 or soluble ectodomain of RAGE blocks neurite outgrowth of cortical neurons on amphoterin-coated substrates. Amphoterin and RAGE are coexpressed in the developing rat nervous system. Since AGEs and amyloid β-peptide are not expected to be present under non-pathophysiological conditions, amphoterin has been suggested to be the physiological ligand for RAGE (20Hori O. Brett J. Slattery T. Cao R. Zhang J. Chen J.X. Nagashima M. Lundh E.R. Vijay S. Nitecki D. Morser J. Stern D. Schmidt A.M. J. Biol.

Although previous studies have identified RAGE as a potential therapeutic target both in diabetic vascular disease and in Alzheimer's disease, the basic cell biology of RAGE is not well understood. The ligation of RAGE with either of the pathophysiologically relevant ligands, AGE or amyloid β-peptide, is suggested to result in generation of cellular oxidant stress and activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (12Yan S.D. Chen X. Fu J. Chen M. Zhu H. Roher A. Slattery T. Zhao L. Nagashima M. Morser J. Migheli A. Nawroth P. Stern D. Schmidt A.M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 9889-9897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is still not clear whether RAGE induces oxidant stress by tethering these oxidizing agents on the cell surface or by mechanisms of cell signaling. However, RAGE-mediated induction of oxidant stress has been shown to activate a Ras-MAP kinase pathway that may eventually lead to the nuclear translocation of NF-κB (22Lander H.M. Tauras J.M.

It is not known whether this signaling pathway is responsible for RAGE-mediated neurite outgrowth on amphoterin-coated substrates. Moreover, the proximal components of the RAGE signaling pathway are unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that the cytoplasmic domain of RAGE is required for both RAGE-mediated neurite outgrowth and activation of NF-κB-dependent transcription. We also show that not Ras but the Rho family small GTPases Rac and Cdc42 are involved in the neurite outgrowth induced by RAGE-amphoterin interaction. However, we were unable to find evidence for the involvement of Rac and Cdc42 in the RAGE-mediated activation of NF-κB suggesting that a signaling mechanism consisting of two parallel pathways can be activated by the cytoplasmic domain of RAGE. Human RAGE cDNA was a generous gift from Dr. David Stern, Columbia University, New York. The cytoplasmic domain mutant (Δ367–404) was generated by polymerase chain reaction using the following primers: 5′-ATAGTCGACATGGCAGCCGG-3′ and 5′-ATAGTCGACTTACCGCCTTTGCCA-3′. Full-length RAGE and the cytoplasmic deletion mutant were subcloned into pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen) containing a neomycin selection cassette. The full-length cDNAs for C3 transferase, N17Rac, and N17Cdc42 were a generous gift from Dr. Alan Hall, MRC, London, UK. The cDNA for N17H-Ras was a generous gift from Dr. Johan Peränen, University of Helsinki. These cDNAs were subcloned into pRK5 expression vector containing a Myc epitope tag. The cis-reporter plasmid pNFKB-Luc (Stratagene) contained a luciferase cDNA under a regular TATA box and an enhancer element with five NF-κB-binding sites. pFC-MEKK (the catalytic domain of MEKK, 360–672; Stratagene) was used as a positive control in the NF-κB assays. The authenticity of all constructs was confirmed by sequencing. N18 mouse neuroblastoma cells and C6 rat glioma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin G and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin and 10% fetal calf serum. N18 cells were transfected with Tfx-50TM reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. G418 (600 μg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to the medium 48 h after transfection to select the stably transfected clones. The expression of RAGE was verified by Northern blotting using the 1.2-kilobase RAGE cDNA as a probe. For further experiments the stable transfectants were cultured in a medium containing 100 μg/ml G418. C6 cells were transfected by electroporation. Briefly, 7.5 × 106 cells in the normal culture medium containing 5 mm BES (Sigma) were added to an electroporation cuvette (0.4-cm electrode gap; Bio-Rad) together with 5 μl of carrier DNA (10 mg/ml herring sperm DNA; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 10 μg of construct DNA. 1:1:2 ratio of RAGE:dominant negative mutant:cis-reporter plasmid was used. After 5 min on ice the cells were electroporated with a Gene-Pulser (Bio-Rad) at 340 V and 500 millifarads. After a 10-min incubation at 40 °C the cells were washed with medium and plated on regular tissue culture plates (Corning Glass). Baculovirus-derived recombinant amphoterin and HB-GAM were prepared and purified as described previously (17Parkkinen J. Raulo E. Merenmies J. Nolo R. Kajander E.O. Baumann M. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19726-19738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Raulo E. Julkunen I. Merenmies J. Pihlaskari R. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11408-11416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AGE-modified bovine serum albumin was prepared by preincubation of BSA (1 mm; fraction V, Sigma) with 1 m glucose at 37 °C for 10 weeks in PBS containing 0.1 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm NaN3. The unincorporated glucose was removed by dialysis against PBS (24 h, twice). The concentration of AGE-BSA was determined by the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad). Neurite outgrowth assays were performed essentially as described before (24Rauvala H. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1010-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Subconfluent, serum-starved N18 cells were detached by incubation in PBS containing 0.5 mm EDTA for 10 min followed by vigorous pipeting. Nunc Lab-Tek chamber slides were coated by incubating with recombinant amphoterin or HB-GAM solution (10–20 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were plated on coated wells and grown in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 24 h and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. After permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min, the cells were blocked with 2% BSA in PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-Myc tag antibodies (1:500; clone 9E10, Upstate Biotechnology). The primary antibodies were detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). F-actin was detected simultaneously with TRITC-labeled phalloidin (Sigma). Conventional fluorescence (Olympus Provis 70) and confocal laser fluorescence (Zeiss LSM 410 Invert Laser Scan) microscopes were used to analyze the results. The proportion of neurite-bearing cells (processes longer than one diameter of the cell) was counted on five random fields of three independent experiments. Statistically significant differences between control and experimental conditions (Student's t test) are indicated with asterisks in the bar graphs. PD98059, wortmannin (Calbiochem), and N-acetyl-l-cysteine (Sigma) were used in indicated concentrations and added to cells 30 min before plating on amphoterin matrix. Serum-starved C6 cells were detached by incubation in PBS containing 0.5 mm EDTA for 10 min followed by vigorous pipeting. 60-mm non-tissue culture-treated plates were coated with recombinant amphoterin as described above. Equal amount of cells (∼2 × 106 cells) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin was plated on amphoterin plates and regular tissue culture plates to which AGE-BSA was added after letting the cells attach for 2 h. The cells were stimulated under these conditions for 20–24 h after which luciferase activity was determined (48 h post-transfection) using standard reagents (Stratagene) and measured in a luminometer (Bio-Orbit, 1254 Luminova). In order to study further the role of RAGE as a neurite outgrowth receptor for amphoterin, we produced stable N18 neuroblastoma cell lines expressing either a full-length RAGE or a deletion mutant lacking the cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 367–404) of RAGE. These cells were serum-starved and grown overnight on glass slides coated with either 10 or 20 μg/ml of recombinant amphoterin. Filamentous actin was then stained with TRITC-phalloidin to study morphological differences between the cell lines. As shown in Fig. 1, cells expressing the full-length RAGE (designated as N18/RAGE) were capable of extending numerous filopodia on slides coated with 10 μg/ml amphoterin (Fig. 1 A), whereas cells expressing the cytoplasmic deletion mutant (designated as N18/RAGEΔcyto; Fig.1 B) or mock-transfected cells (Fig. 1 C) did not display such morphology. When grown on 20 μg/ml amphoterin-coated slides a proportion of N18/RAGE cells was capable of extending neurites (Fig. 1 D). In contrast, N18/RAGEΔcyto or N18/mock cells grew few processes and hardly any neurites (Fig. 1, E andF, respectively). In comparison to the cells transfected with the cytoplasmic domain deletion mutant of RAGE (2.7 ± 2.1%) or empty vector (3.1 ± 1.7%), the cells expressing full-length RAGE (20.0 ± 5.6%) had nearly 10 times higher capacity of growing neurites on amphoterin matrix (Fig. 1 G, black bars). To demonstrate that RAGE-mediated neurite outgrowth was specific for amphoterin-coated substrates, parallel experiments were performed with the cells plated on HB-GAM-coated slides. HB-GAM is another neurite outgrowth-promoting protein with similar characteristics as amphoterin, such as high affinity binding to heparin and a sequence rich in basic amino acids (for a review see Ref. 25Rauvala H. Peng H.B. Prog. Neurobiol. (New York). 1997; 52: 127-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). N18/RAGE cells grown on HB-GAM matrix displayed no morphological difference in comparison to N18/RAGEΔcyto or N18/mock cells (<5% neurite-bearing cells in each) (Fig. 1 G, gray bars). Thus, the neurite outgrowth-promoting effect of RAGE is specific for amphoterin and requires the presence of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. The Rho family of small GTPases is known to regulate various aspects of the actin cytoskeleton. In fibroblasts, Rho regulates the formation of stress fibers and focal complexes, Rac regulates membrane ruffling and the formation of lamellipodia, and Cdc42 regulates the formation of filopodia (reviewed in Ref. 26Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that they may also be involved in neuritogenesis and growth cone signaling (27Luo L. Hensch T.K. Ackerman L. Barbel S. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Nature. 1996; 379: 837-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 28Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 29Threadgill R. Bobb K. Ghosh A. Neuron. 1997; 19: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Considering the filopodial morphology of N18/RAGE cells grown on amphoterin matrix, we wanted to determine whether the Rho family GTPases are involved in RAGE signaling. Dominant negative mutants (T17N) of Rac or Cdc42 or a Rho-inhibitory molecule C3 transferase were expressed in N18/RAGE cells. As shown in Fig. 2, transient overexpression of either N17Rac or N17Cdc42 in N18/RAGE cells completely abolished neurite outgrowth on amphoterin matrix, whereas expression of the C3 transferase did not have a significant effect on RAGE-mediated neurite outgrowth. The binding of RAGE to the two other ligands, AGE and amyloid β-peptide, has been shown to result in induction of cellular oxidant stress (12Yan S.D. Chen X. Fu J. Chen M. Zhu H. Roher A. Slattery T. Zhao L. Nagashima M. Morser J. Migheli A. Nawroth P. Stern D. Schmidt A.M. Nature. 1996; 382: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (1827) Google Scholar, 21Yan S.D. Schmidt A.M. Anderson G.M. Zhang J. Brett J. Zou Y.S. Pinsky D. Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9889-9897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently RAGE-mediated induction of cellular oxidant stress has been shown to trigger a Ras-dependent MAP kinase pathway (22Lander H.M. Tauras J.M. Ogiste J.S. Hori O. Moss R.A. Schmidt A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17810-17814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Moreover, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase has been shown to be recruited to Ras by oxidant stress (30Deora A.A. Win T. Vanhaesebroeck B. Lander H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29923-29928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether components of this Ras-MAP kinase pathway are involved in RAGE-mediated neurite outgrowth. Expression of a dominant negative mutant (T17N) of Ha-Ras in N18/RAGE cells did not affect RAGE-mediated neurite outgrowth (Fig. 2, D, H, and I). To demonstrate also that the other components of the known RAGE signaling pathway are dispensable for RAGE-mediated neurite outgrowth, N18/RAGE cells were grown on amphoterin matrix in the presence of either an antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine, a MEK (MAP kinase kinase) inhibitor PD98059, or a PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin. None of these compounds had a significant effect on RAGE-mediated neurite outgrowth (Fig. 3). These data indicate that both Rac and Cdc42 but not Rho or Ras-MAP kinase pathway are involved in RAGE-mediated neurite outgrowth. To determine whether the cytoplasmic domain of RAGE is also required for RAGE-mediated activation of nuclear factor-κB, we expressed the full-length RAGE or the cytoplasmic domain deletion mutant of RAGE together with an NF-κB-responsive reporter gene (luciferase) construct in C6 rat glioma cells. This system was used because high transient expression levels could be obtained together with high efficiency transfection. Cells were serum-starved and stimulated overnight either on amphoterin matrix (20 μg/ml) or with AGE-modified BSA in solution (500 μg/ml). The enhancement of NF-κB-dependent transcription was then quantitated from the cell lysates by measuring the luciferase activity. Non-stimulated mock-transfected cells were used as a control of basal transcriptional activity. As shown in Fig.4 A, both amphoterin (black bars) and AGE (gray bars) were capable of activating NF-κB-dependent transcription in the cells transfected with full-length RAGE. With both amphoterin (337 ± 86%) and AGE (377 ± 104%) the activation of NF-κB-dependent transcription was significantly higher than in control cells. The level of NF-κB-dependent transcription in the cells transfected with RAGEΔcyto was not remarkably higher than in similarly treated mock-transfected cells. This indicates that the cytoplasmic domain of RAGE is also needed for activation of NF-κB, and in addition to AGE and amyloid β, amphoterin is also capable of activating NF-κB. In addition to the central role of Rho family small GTPases in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, they have also been shown to function as regulators of specific transcription factors such as NF-κB (31Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. Sanchez-Perez I. Bravo R. Lacal J.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). As Rac and Cdc42 are clearly involved in RAGE-mediated neurite outgrowth, we wanted to see whether, in addition to Ras, these Rho family small GTPases are also involved in RAGE-mediated activation of NF-κB. C3 transferase or one of the dominant negative mutants N17Rac, N17Cdc42, or N17Ras were transfected into C6 cells together with full-length RAGE and the NF-κB-responsive reporter gene construct. The relative luciferase activity in proportion to similarly stimulated RAGE-transfected cells was measured from cell lysates after an overnight stimulation with either amphoterin (20 μg/ml; black bars) or AGE (500 μg/ml; gray bars) and is shown in Fig. 4 B. The NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activity was only inhibited in cells co-transfected with N17Ras. The dominant negative Ras was able to inhibit significantly both amphoterin-induced (67 ± 4.3%) and AGE-induced (77 ± 7.5%) activation of NF-κB-dependent transcription, whereas inhibition of Rho, Rac, or Cdc42 had no significant effect. These data indicate that Ras but not the Rho family members are involved in the RAGE-mediated activation and apparent nuclear translocation of NF-κB. During the last few years, the signal transduction pathways responsible for neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth have been a subject for intense research. We have been interested in a particular receptor, namely RAGE, recently shown to be capable of mediating neurite outgrowth on amphoterin-coated substrates (20Hori O. Brett J. Slattery T. Cao R.

The effect of the two other ligands of RAGE, AGE and amyloid β-peptide (1Schmidt A.-M. Vianna M. Gerlach M. Brett J. Ryan J. Kao J. Esposito C. Hegarty H. Hurley W. Clauss M. Wang F. Pan Y.-C.E.

Both can generate significant cellular oxidant stress and activate transcription factor NF-κB in a RAGE-dependent manner (12Yan S.D. Chen X. Fu J. Chen M. Zhu H. Roher A. Slattery T. Zhao L.

Despite intensive investigation it is still unknown whether RAGE induces oxidant stress by bringing AGE and amyloid β-peptide, both sources of reactive oxygen species themselves (21Yan S.D.

A. 1994; 91: 3270-3274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar), close to the cell surface or by mechanisms of cell signaling. Thus, the signaling mechanism of RAGE presents several interesting questions. In this study our aim was to determine whether RAGE acts as a signaling receptor in a manner that requires the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. Transfection of full-length RAGE to N18 neuroblastoma cells is sufficient to induce neurite outgrowth on amphoterin matrix further confirming the role of RAGE as a neurite outgrowth receptor of amphoterin. However, when a cytoplasmic domain deletion mutant is transfected to N18 cells neurite outgrowth is reduced to the level of mock-transfected cells. This implies that the cytoplasmic domain of RAGE interacts with a molecule or perhaps a signaling complex necessary to initiate neurite extension. When RAGE-transfected N18 cells are grown on a lower concentration of amphoterin, extension of numerous filopodia rather than neurites is observed. This suggests a dose dependence of amphoterin-induced morphological changes. Rho family small GTPases are now widely accepted to be key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton (reviewed in Ref. 26Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). It is becoming apparent that these signaling molecules are also critical components of the cytoskeletally driven neurite outgrowth (27Luo L. Hensch T.K. Ackerman L. Barbel S. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Nature. 1996; 379: 837-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 28Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 29Threadgill R. Bobb K. Ghosh A. Neuron. 1997; 19: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The striking resemblance of the RAGE-transfected N18 cells grown on lower concentrations of amphoterin to the typical Cdc42-induced filopodial morphology (37Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3747) Google Scholar) suggested that the Rho family members might be involved in RAGE signaling. Indeed, dominant negative constructs of both Rac and Cdc42 completely blocked the RAGE-mediated neurite outgrowth on amphoterin matrix, whereas inhibition of Rho by C3 transferase had no effect. This is reasonable since Rho has been shown to be the mediator of the lysophosphatidic acid-induced neurite retraction rather than the extension of neurites (28Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Since inhibition of either Rac or Cdc42 alone is able to block RAGE-mediated neurite outgrowth, it seems that they lie on the same signaling pathway. In fact it was recently shown that Cdc42 can activate Rac through PAK, a downstream effector of both Cdc42 and Rac (38Obermeier A. Ahmed S. Manser E. Yen S.C. Hall C. Lim L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4328-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, considering the filopodial morphology of N18/RAGE cells on the lower concentration of amphoterin, it is possible that Cdc42 and Rac mediate their effects on the cytoskeleton independently, perhaps in different phases of neuritogenesis. The p21-activated kinase (PAK) family of serine/threonine kinases has been identified as targets for active Rac and Cdc42 (39Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). PAK family members are considered as main candidate effectors mediating the downstream effect of Rac and Cdc42 on the actin cytoskeleton (40Lim L. Manser E. Leung T. Hall C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 41Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Recently, Daniels et al. (42Daniels R.H. Hall P.S. Bokoch G.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 754-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) reported that membrane targeting of PAK1 via a C-terminal isoprenylation sequence is sufficient to induce neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells independently of PAK1 kinase activity. Quite interestingly, by using truncated mutants they found that an acidic glutamate/aspartate-rich region of PAK1 is necessary for neurite outgrowth. They speculated that this region might act to recruit signaling proteins to the plasma membrane, which is necessary to initiate neurite extension. The cytoplasmic domain of RAGE contains a similar highly acidic region. It will be interesting to see whether identification of molecules capable of binding to RAGE cytoplasmic domain will give further insight into the role of Rac and Cdc42 in RAGE-mediated neurite outgrowth. The involvement of PAK or other effectors of Rac and/or Cdc42 in RAGE signaling awaits further investigation. One of the best characterized transcription factors, NF-κB, is classically linked to inflammation and stress responses. Recently, evidence has begun to accumulate that NF-κB is also involved in brain function, particularly following injury and in neurodegenerative conditions but also in neuronal development (reviewed in Ref. 43O'Neill L.A. Kaltschmidt C. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 252-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB is a hallmark of RAGE ligation with either AGEs or amyloid β-peptide (12Yan S.D. Chen X. Fu J. Chen M. Zhu H. Roher A. Slattery T. Zhao L. Nagashima M. Morser J. Migheli A. Nawroth P. Stern D. Schmidt A.M. Nature. 1996; 382: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (1827) Google Scholar, 21Yan S.D. Schmidt A.M. Anderson G.M. Zhang J. Brett J. Zou Y.S. Pinsky D. Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9889-9897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the vascular system RAGE-mediated activation of NF-κB has been shown to induce expression of genes such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), which might contribute to the development of diabetic vascular disease (44Schmidt A.M. Hori O. Chen J.X. Li J.F. Crandall J. Zhang J. Cao R. Yan S.D. Brett J. Stern D. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1395-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). In neurons RAGE-mediated activation of NF-κB in response to amyloid β-peptide has been shown to induce expression of macrophage-colony-stimulating factor strengthening the inflammatory response in Alzheimer's brain (13Du Y.S. Zhu H. Fu J. Yan S.F. Roher A. Tourtellotte W.W. Rajavashisth Chen X. Godman G.C. Stern D. Schmidt A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5296-5301Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrate that amphoterin is also capable of activating NF-κB through RAGE. However, it is likely that amphoterin-induced changes in gene expression contribute to other than inflammatory processes. Recently, nerve growth factor-dependent activation of NF-κB was shown to contribute to the survival of sympathetic neurons (45Maggirwar S.B. Sarmiere P.D. Dewhurst S. Freeman R.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 10356-10365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that amphoterin could induce such a survival effect through RAGE-mediated activation of NF-κB. Interestingly, the analysis of the promoter region of RAGE gene revealed the presence of two functional NF-κB-binding sites (46Li J. Schmidt A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16498-16506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) suggesting a possible autoregulatory loop in the regulation of RAGE expression. However, when this manuscript was under preparation a finding was published (47Li J. Qu X. Schmidt A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30870-30878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) showing that amphoterin-induced increase in RAGE expression is mediated by binding of amphoterin to RAGE resulting in Sp1 activation rather than activation of NF-κB. Soluble amphoterin was used in their study, whereas we have used matrix-bound amphoterin. In our NF-κB assay soluble amphoterin had a weaker but still significant effect on the activation NF-κB when compared with matrix-bound amphoterin (data not shown). Thus, the differences in their study and our results may lie somewhere else, for example in the use of different cell types or the length of stimulation. Also it should be noted that our results have been obtained not by measuring the nuclear localization of NF-κB but by measuring the activation of NF-κB-dependent transcription. Further studies will be required to establish the molecular mechanism responsible for RAGE-mediated activation of NF-κB both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we show that the RAGE-mediated activation of NF-κB is dependent on the cytoplasmic domain of RAGE and functional Ras. Deletion of the cytoplasmic domain of RAGE blocked the activation of NF-κB-dependent transcription both with amphoterin and AGE. However, using the dominant negative approach again, we found that only Ras but not the Rho family GTPases is involved in the RAGE-mediated activation of NF-κB. The schematic model presented in Fig. 5 suggests that a similar, yet unknown, membrane-proximal signaling component is required for both amphoterin and AGE in RAGE signaling, but two parallel, independent pathways then lead to the activation of NF-κB or cytoskeletal reorganization. However, our experiments do not completely exclude the possibility of cross-talk between the Ras-MAP kinase and the Cdc42-Rac pathways in RAGE signaling. There is substantial evidence of such cross-talk between Ras and Rho pathways in other systems (37Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3747) Google Scholar, 48Frost J.A. Steen H. Shapiro P. Lewis T. Ahn N. Shaw P.E. Cobb M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). In addition, Rac has been shown to participate in the activation of NADPH complex in phagocytes (49Abo A. Pick E. Hall A. Totty N. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W. Nature. 1991; 353: 668-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 50Knaus U.G. Heyworth P.G. Evans T. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1991; 254: 1512-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) but also in a redox-dependent pathway necessary for NF-κB activation in nonphagocytic cells (51Sulciner D.J. Irani K. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Finkel T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7115-7121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus an interesting possibility that Rac might regulate intracellular production of radicals required for RAGE-mediated activation of NF-κB still remains. An intriguing scenario is appearing for the functions of RAGE and its three ligands: AGE, amyloid β-peptide, and amphoterin. Detailed understanding of the RAGE signaling mechanisms is important because of the pathophysiological relevance of AGE and amyloid β-peptide. On the other hand, amphoterin-induced neurite extension and the RAGE/Cdc42-Rac signaling pathway may be important in the formation of the neural connections during development and/or injury of the nervous system. We thank Dr. David Stern for generously providing us with the human RAGE cDNA; Dr. Alan Hall for providing us with the expression plasmids for C3 transferase and dominant negative Rac and Cdc42; and Dr. Johan Peränen for providing us with dominant negative Ras.

CDM-cultured ES cells responded very selectively to stimulation by various mesoderm inducers (BMP2/4, activin A, and basic fibroblast growth factor).

Dev. 1997; 68: 3-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Our understanding of the molecular mechanism mediating gastrulation is still insufficient, although over the past years many secreted growth factor-like molecules have been identified to play important roles in these early embryonic events (3David J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6259-6262PubMed Google Scholar). Among these signaling molecules are several members of the BMP1family. BMP-related growth factors belong to the TGF-β-superfamily and have been identified in a wide variety of organisms, ranging from insects to mammals (4Hogan B.L.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar). BMPs have originally been isolated for their ability to induce ectopic bone formation when injected under the skin or into the muscle of rodents (5Urist M.R. Science. 1965; 150: 893-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (4449) Google Scholar, 6Wozney J.M. Rosen R. Celeste A.J. Mitsock L.M. Whitters M.J. Kriz R.W. Hewick R.M. Wang E. Science. 1988; 242: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (3322) Google Scholar), but meanwhile many of the BMPs have been implicated in a variety of other developmental interactions, including very early embryonic inductive events. For example inDrosophila embryonic dorsal-ventral patterning is partly accomplished through the action of DPP (decapentaplegic) (7Ferguson E.L. Anderson K.V. Cell. 1992; 71: 451-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar,8Capovilla M. Brandt M. Betas J. Cell. 1994; 76: 461-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), which is the BMP member most closely related to mammalian BMP2 and BMP4. At the functional level these factors can substitute for one another in vertebrate and Drosophila embryos. Human BMP4 is able to rescue the dorsal-ventral pattern defects of dppnull mutants (9Padgett R.W. Wozney J.M. Gelbart W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2905-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), whereas Drosophila DPP protein can induce ectopic bone in mice (10Sampath T.K. Rashka E.E. Doctor J.C. Tucker R.F. Hoffmann F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6004-6008Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The striking evolutionary conservation of BMP2, BMP4, and DPP suggested that these molecules play crucial roles in early vertebrate development, as is confirmed meanwhile by many studies. In Xenopus laevis BMP4 ventralizes early mesoderm (11Dale L. Howes G. Price B.M.J. Smith J.C. Development. 1992; 115: 573-585PubMed Google Scholar, 12Jones C.M. Lyons K.M. Lapan P.M. Wright C.V.E.

Nature. 1995; 376: 331-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Blocking BMP2/4 receptor activity in the ventral part of the embryo eliminates blood formation and dorsalizes the mesoderm (15Graf J. Theis R. Song J. Celest A. Melton D.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3027-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar) have demonstrated the requirements for BMP2 and BMP4 during early mouse development. Embryos homozygous for the Bmp4 null mutation do not proceed beyond the egg cylinder stage and show little or no mesodermal differentiation (20Winnier G. Blessing M. Labosky P.A. Hogan B.L.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2105-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar), whereas mice deficient for BMP2 have defects in amnion/chorion and cardiac development (21Zhang H. Bradley A. Development. 1996; 122: 2977-2986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice lacking the BMP2/4 type I receptor die prior to gastrulation and fail to form mesoderm altogether (22Mishina Y. Susuki A. Ueno N. Behringer R.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3027-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). BMPs, like other members of the TGF-β superfamily, signal through heteromeric complexes of type I and type II transmembrane Ser/Thr kinase receptors (23Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 24Weis-Garcia F. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Binding of BMP dimers to either type of receptor triggers well defined signaling steps (25Kawabata M. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1998; 1: 49-61Crossref Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 26Kretzschmar M. Massagué J. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1998; 8: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) that finally lead to the activation of crucial target genes. However, relatively little is known about direct target genes of BMP signaling during early mammalian cell fate determination. Therefore, the identification of BMP-induced immediate early genes appeared of great interest. Toward this aim we analyzed BMP-mediated gene activation in murine ES cells. The in vitro differentiation process of ES cells can serve as a model for early mammalian development, permitting the expression of a variety of embryonic markers to be monitored (27Wiles M.V. Keller G. Development. 1991; 111: 259-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Keller G.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 862-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). When ES cells are cultivated in a chemically defined medium (CDM), they exhibit specific responses to defined growth factors. These cellular responses are influenced by the nature as well as the concentration of the factors. For example, BMP4 treatment induces expression of ventral mesoderm markers (29Johansson B.M. Wiles M.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), and, at higher BMP concentrations, hematopoietic cell development is induced (30Wiles M.V. Johansson B.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We used this system to investigate BMP2 and BMP4 effects on the expression of early embryonic marker genes by using the differential display (dd) RT-PCR technique (31Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4687) Google Scholar). We report the identification of several transcription units directly regulated by BMPs, including members of the Id gene family.DISCUSSIONEmbryonic stem (ES) cells represent totipotent cells that can contribute to normal embryonic development when incorporated into blastocysts. In vitro, ES cells can also be stimulated to differentiate along mesodermal and neuronal paths, which has yielded significant insight into processes of cellular differentiation during development. In the present study we confirm the ability of ES cells to respond efficiently and specifically to extracellular differentiation-inducing signals. Furthermore, we used the ES cell system to identify by dd-RT-PCR transcription units whose expression was hitherto unknown to be stimulated upon treatment with the mesoderm inducing factors BMP2 and BMP4. A similar experimental strategy led previously to the identification of Cryptic as a novel mesoderm-specific gene (61Shen M.M. Wang H. Leder P. Development. 1997; 124: 429-442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Expression of Transcriptional Control Genes upon BMP4 Treatment of ES CellsMsx GenesWe confirmed the Msx-1 andMsx-2 genes as target genes of BMP2/4 signaling in ES cells (Fig. 1 A and Fig. 2). Since Msx gene induction by BMPs did not require de novo protein synthesis, it is suggested that Msx-1 and Msx-2 represent direct target genes of BMP signaling. Msx-1 and Msx-2are two members of a divergent homeobox-related gene family displaying homology to the Drosophila msh gene (muscle segment homeobox) (reviewed in Refs. 62Davidson D.

Their overlapping expression patterns and sequence similarities strongly suggest that theMsx-1 and Msx-2 genes function in an equivalent manner during development (71Catron K.M. Wang H. Hu G. Shen M.M. Abate-Shen C. Mech. Dev. 1996; 55: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Since expression of Msxgenes correlates with that observed of BMPs during development, BMPs have been considered likely candidates for Msx-inducing factors (62Davidson D. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 405-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar).Our identification of murine Msx genes as direct targets of BMP signaling are in line with data recently published by Suzukiet al. (72Suzuki A. Ueno N. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Development. 1997; 124: 3037-3044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrating in Xenopus embryos that BMP receptor activity elicits Msx-1 induction and thatMsx-1 can mimic BMP effects in epidermal induction and the inhibition of neural differentiation.BMP activity and Msx gene expression have been identified as part of certain apoptotic mechanisms (47Graham A. Francis W.P. Brickell P. Lumsden A. Nature. 1994; 372: 684-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). However, as judged by TUNEL assays, our treatment of in vitro cultured ES cells with BMPs did not lead to enhanced apoptosis (data not shown).fos and jun GenesThe transcription factor AP-1 consists of Fos/Jun heterodimers or Jun/Jun homodimers and activates gene transcription programs in response to various stimuli, including cytokines, growth factors, and cellular stress, like UV irradiation or heat shock (44Kaplan F.S. Shore E.M. Bone (NY). 1996; 19: 13S-21SCrossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 45Liebermann D.A. Gregory B. Hoffman B. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 12: 685-700PubMed Google Scholar). The data presented here show that the c-fos gene did not significantly respond to treatment with BMP4 (Fig. 1), whereas the c-jun transcript exhibited a delayed and long lasting increase (Fig. 1 B). JunBmRNA levels were elevated very rapidly and transiently (Fig.1 B). This agrees with Chalaux et al. (73Chalaux E. López-Rovira T. Rosa J.L. Bartrons R. Ventura F. J. Biol.

Additionally, Jonk et al.(74Jonk L.J.C. Itoh S. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. Kruijer W. J. Biol.

The prolonged response of the c-jun gene correlates with similar effects elicited by TGF-β on human lung adenocarcinoma and erythroleukemia cells, as well as mouse embryo fibroblasts (75Kim S.J.

The identification of c-jun and JunB as BMP response genes in ES cells implicates AP-1 as a regulator of BMP-dependent gene expression during early embryogenesis. In this respect it is interesting to note that in mice null mutations of the individual AP-1 components c-jun and JunBlead to early embryonic death (78Johnson R.S. Spiegelman B.M. Papaioannou V.

These include genes encoding one extracellular matrix signaling molecule (Cyr61/clone A52), one translational regulator (EIF4AII/clone A59), and three transcriptional regulators (DEK/clone A51, Sp-1 homologue/clone C74, and Id3/clone G9).Cyr61Transcriptional activation of the Cyr61 gene by FGF, PDGF, and the BMP-related molecule TGF-β has been reported previously (81Brunner A. Chinn J. Neubauer M. Purchio A.F. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 82Grotendorst G.R. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). The encoded Cyr61 protein is a secreted cysteine-rich heparin-binding protein that associates with the cell surface and the extracellular matrix (83Kireeva M.L. Mo F.-E. Yang G.P. Lau L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1326-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions are known to exert important effects on embryonic development (84Adams J.C. Watt F.M.

During embryogenesis cyr61 is expressed most notably in mesenchymal cells that are differentiating into chondrocytes and in vessels of the developing vascular system (86Kireeva M.L. Latinkic B.V.

Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Murine EIF4AII expression shows tissue-specific distribution (54Nielsen P.J. Trachsel H. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2097-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We speculate that induction ofEIF4AII in response to BMP stimulation might facilitate translation of critical mRNAs present in ES cells.DEKDEK, a nuclear protein, has site-specific DNA binding activity that is likely involved in transcriptional regulation and signal transduction (92Fu G.K. Grosveld G. Markovitz D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1811-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). DEK transcripts are seen at high levels from embryonic day 10 onward, and the gene is expressed ubiquitously in different adult tissues (52von Lindern M. Fornerod M. van Baal S. Jaegle M. de Wit T. Buijs A. Grosveld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1687-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar).Clone74The BMP-inducible gene corresponding to clone C74 was previously identified as Glbp-23b, encoding a novel murine Sp1-like protein (55Subramaniam M. Harris S.A. Oursler M.J. Rasmussen K. Riggs B.L. Spelsberg T.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4907-4912Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Its human homologue TIEG was identified as a TGF-β- and BMP2-regulated gene in osteoblasts (2Tam P.P. Behringer R.R. Mech. Dev. 1997; 68: 3-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The TIEG protein contains three zinc finger motifs homologous to the transcription factors Sp1, Sp3, WT1, and GT box-binding protein. We speculate that the C74 gene product may play a role as an effector of BMP-mediated differentiation.Clone A79The gene represented by clone A79 awaits identification.Induced Expression of Id1, Id2, and Id3 upon BMP Treatment of ES CellsIn addition to the transcripts discussed above, our screen identified the Id3 gene to be activated by BMP2/4. We further show that its relatives, Id1 and Id2, also respond directly to treatment with BMP4. These inductions are seen in ES cells, as well as a diverse range of cell lines. Id family members encode negative regulators of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors that have been found to play a central role in the control of mammalian cell growth, differentiation, and tumorigenesis (reviewed in Ref. 56Norton J.D. Deed R.W. Craggs G. Sablitzky F. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 58-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Id proteins lack the basic region but possess the HLH motif. They can form heterodimers with the ubiquitously expressed E proteins (E2A, E2-2, and HEB) and render them inactive for DNA binding, dimerization with the tissue-restricted bHLH proteins, and, consequently, activation of their target genes. Down-regulation of Id genes is necessary for terminal differentiation in many developmental processes, including myogenesis (93Jen Y. Weintraub H. Benezra R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1466-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 94Kurobayashi M. Dutta S. Kedes L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31162-31170PubMed Google Scholar), myelopoiesis (95Kreider B.

A. 1993; 90: 9219-9222Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), glomerular mesangial cell development (97Simonson M.S. Rooney A. Herman W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5767-5774Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and trophoblast development (98Janatpour M.J. McMaster M.T. Israel M.A. Fisher S.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5 (suppl.): 453aGoogle Scholar).Cell cycle progression is also regulated by Id factors, in part via the induction of the p21-encoding gene, which in itself represents a BMP-regulated transcription unit (99Hara E. Yamaguchi T. Nojima H. Ide T. Campisi J. Okayama H. Oda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2139-2145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 100Jernvall J. Aberg T. Kettunen P. Keränen S. Thesleff I. Development. 1998; 125: 161-169PubMed Google Scholar). Id proteins are viewed generally as negative regulators of differentiation and as positive regulators of proliferation. However, in our ES cell system BMP-mediated enhancement of Id expression does not coincide with a stimulation in DNA synthesis, as judged by thymidine incorporation assays (data not shown).During organogenesis the expression patterns of Id1, Id2,and Id3 genes are highly overlapping with each other and with the expression domains of BMPs. These sites of expression are often associated with active mesenchymal-epithelial interactions (57Jen Y. Manova K. Benezra R. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 207: 235-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar,58Riechmann V. van Crüchten J. Sablitzky F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 749-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). During gastrulation Id1 and Id3 are expressed in the embryonic ectoderm, and Id2 is expressed in extraembryonic tissues, whereas Id4 expression cannot be detected at this stage of development (101Jen Y. Manova K. Benezra R. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 92-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This may suggest an involvement of Id1, Id2, and Id3, but not of Id4, in gastrulation and is in line with the absence of Id4 expression in ES cells observed here. The characterization of Id1, Id2, andId3 as BMP-induced immediate early genes in ES cells may implicate negative regulation of bHLH transcription factor activity to accompany BMP-mediated inductive events during early embryogenesis. BMP-mediated increase in Id expression may function as a molecular switch for lineage specification by functionally blocking the realization of developmental programs regulated by certain bHLH transcription factors (i.e. myogenesis). In this way, the realization of alternative programs (i.e. ventralization of mesoderm, bone formation, etc.) may be initiated.Misexpression of Bmp4 in Embryos Induces Ectopic Induction of Msx-2 and Id3Previous work in chicken using BMP-releasing beads implanted at selected embryonic sites has identified induced expression ofMsx-1 and Msx-2 in the vicinity of the beads (46Vainio S. Karavanova I. Jowett A. Thesleff I. Cell. 1993; 75: 45-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar,50Kim H.J. Rice D.P. Kettunen P.J. Thesleff I. Development. 1998; 125: 1241-1251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We made use of the dominant mouse mutant Fused toes(Ft) which is characterized phenotypically by fused toes of the forelimbs, coinciding with ectopical misexpression ofBmp4 in the anterior distal part of the forelimbs at E12.2 Although we found expression of Bmp4 (102Büscher D. Bosse B. Heymer J. Rüther U. Mech. Dev. 1997; 62: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and Id3 (57Jen Y. Manova K. Benezra R. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 207: 235-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) in wild-type limbs as described previously, at sites of ectopical BMP4 misexpression in Ft/+ limbs we observed the induced expression of Id3 (Fig. 6) as well asMsx-2 (not shown). This suggests that activation of these genes within the embryo is a direct consequence of local BMP expression. This in vivo correlation of BMP expression and target gene induction adds support to the experimental strategy of identifying in ES cells BMP-regulated genes whose induced expression may be relevant not only inside ES cells but also within the embryo.In conclusion, we propose that the direct target genes of BMP4 signaling identified here are involved in BMP-stimulated early processes of mammalian development. It will be of special interest to compare the expression patterns of Msx-1, Msx-2,c-jun, Id1, Id2, and Id3 in normal miceversus those deficient in BMP2, BMP4, and BMP2/4-type I receptor. The promoters of the genes identified in our study should serve as useful tools to characterize the molecular gene regulatory circuits that are governed by BMP signaling. One important stage in the development of the vertebrate embryo is reached when the three germ layers are formed and the body plan gets established during the process of gastrulation (1Beddington R.S. Robertson E.J. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 277-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 2Tam P.P. Behringer R.R. Mech. Dev. 1997; 68: 3-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Our understanding of the molecular mechanism mediating gastrulation is still insufficient, although over the past years many secreted growth factor-like molecules have been identified to play important roles in these early embryonic events (3David J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6259-6262PubMed Google Scholar). Among these signaling molecules are several members of the BMP1family. BMP-related growth factors belong to the TGF-β-superfamily and have been identified in a wide variety of organisms, ranging from insects to mammals (4Hogan B.L.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar). BMPs have originally been isolated for their ability to induce ectopic bone formation"
https://openalex.org/W2023253424,"We have isolated a cDNA from rat small intestine that encodes a novel Na+-independent neutral amino acid transporter with distinctive characteristics in substrate selectivity and transport property. The encoded protein, designated L-type amino acid transporter-2 (LAT-2), shows amino acid sequence similarity to the system L Na+-independent neutral amino acid transporter LAT-1 (Kanai, Y., Segawa, H., Miyamoto, K., Uchino, H., Takeda, E., and Endou, H.(1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 23629–23632) (50% identity) and the system y+L transporters y+LAT-1 (47%) and KIAA0245/y+LAT-2 (45%) (Torrents, D., Estevez, R., Pineda, M., Fernandez, E., Lloberas, J., Shi, Y.-B., Zorzano, A., and Palacin, M. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 32437–32445). LAT-2 is a nonglycosylated membrane protein. It requires 4F2 heavy chain, a type II membrane glycoprotein, for its functional expression inXenopus oocytes. LAT-2-mediated transport is not dependent on Na+ or Cl− and is inhibited by a systeml-specific inhibitor, 2-aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH), indicating that LAT-2 is a second isoform of the system L transporter. Compared with LAT-1, which prefers large neutral amino acids with branched or aromatic side chains, LAT-2 exhibits remarkably broad substrate selectivity. It transports all of the l-isomers of neutral α-amino acids. LAT-2 exhibits higher affinity (K m= 30–50 μm) to Tyr, Phe, Trp, Thr, Asn, Ile, Cys, Ser, Leu, Val, and Gln and relatively lower affinity (K m= 180–300 μm) to His, Ala, Met, and Gly. In addition, LAT-2 mediates facilitated diffusion of substrate amino acids, as distinct from LAT-1, which mediates amino acid exchange. LAT-2-mediated transport is increased by lowering the pH level, with peak activity at pH 6.25, because of the decrease in the K m value without changing the V max value. Because of these functional properties and a high level of expression of LAT-2 in the small intestine, kidney, placenta, and brain, it is suggested that the heterodimeric complex of LAT-2 and 4F2 heavy chain is involved in the trans-cellular transport of neutral amino acids in epithelia and blood-tissue barriers.

We have demonstrated that co-expression of LAT-1 and 4F2 heavy chain (4F2hc) results in the functional expression of system L activity. 4F2 antigen is a heterodimeric protein composed of two subunits, an ∼80-kDa glycosylated heavy chain and an ∼40-kDa nonglycosylated light chain (19Haynes B.F. Hemler M.E. Mann D.L. Eisenbarth G.S. Shelhamer J. Mostowski H.S. Thomas C.A. Strominger J.L. Fauci A.S. J. Immunol. 1981; 126: 1409-1414PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hemler M.E. Strominger J.L. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 623-628PubMed Google Scholar). 4F2hc is an integral membrane protein with a single membrane-spanning domain classified as a type II membrane protein (21Quackenbush E. Clabby M.

It has been shown that LAT-1 is one of the proteins formerly referred to as 4F2 light chain (22Mastroberardino L. Spindler B. Pfeiffer R. Skelly P.J. Loffing J. Shoemaker C.B. Verrey F.

When LAT-1 is co-expressed with 4F2hc in Xenopus oocytes, it induces the Na+-independent and trans-stimulable transport of large neutral amino acids such as leucine, isoleucine, valine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, methionine, and histidine, consistent with the property originally described by Christensen and co-workers (1Christensen H.N.

We expected that other unidentified subtypes of system L were structurally related to LAT-1. We searched for such proteins and identified a second isoform of system L transporter, which exhibits distinct characteristics in substrate selectivity and functional properties. The cDNA for a human expressed sequence tag (EST) (GenBank™/EBI/DDBJ accession no. N32639), which we found in the course of EST data base searches to show nucleotide sequence similarity to rat LAT-1, was obtained from the Integrated and Molecular Analysis of Genomes and their Expression (IMAGE). The 0.38-kilobase pair cDNA fragment was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using synthetic oligonucleotide primers 5′-CTCTTCACATGCATCTCCAC-3′ and 5′-GGTACACGACCACACACATC-3′ (corresponding to nucleotides 35–54 and 397–416, respectively, of the nucleotide sequence submitted to GenBank™/EBI/DDBJ under accession no. N32639) and using the IMAGE cDNA clone 267666 as a template. The cDNA fragment was labeled with [32P]dCTP (T7QuickPrime, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to use as a probe for screening a nondirectional cDNA library. The cDNA library was prepared from rat small intestine poly(A)+ RNA using the Superscript Choice system (Life Technologies, Inc.). The synthesized cDNA was ligated to λZipLox EcoRI arms (Life Technologies, Inc.). Screening cDNA library and isolation of positive plaques were performed as described elsewhere (5Utsunomiya-Tate N.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Hybridization was done in 50% formamide at 37 °C. Filters were washed at 37 °C in 0.1× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 msodium chloride, 0.015 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. cDNAs in positive λZipLox phages were rescued into plasmid pZL1 by in vivoexcision following the manufacturer's instruction (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cDNA was sequenced in both directions by the dye terminator cycle sequencing method (Perkin-Elmer and Applied Biosystems). The transmembrane regions of proteins were predicted on the amino acid sequence based on the SOSUI algorithm (28Hirokawa T. Boon-Chieng S. Mitaku S.

For co-expression experiments, 17 ng of LAT-2 cRNA and 8 ng of 4F2hc cRNA (mole ratio of 1:1) were mixed and injected for each oocyte. To solely express LAT-2 and 4F2hc in Xenopusoocytes, 17 and 8 ng of cRNAs were injected for LAT-2 and 4F2hc, respectively. The Xenopus oocyte expression of LAT-1 and 4F2hc was performed as described (18Kanai Y. Segawa H. Miyamoto K. Uchino H. Takeda E. Endou H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23629-23632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Groups of six to eight oocytes were incubated in 500 μl of standard uptake solution (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4) or Na+-free uptake solution in which NaCl in the standard uptake solution was replaced by choline chloride containing 0.5–3.0 μCi of radiolabeled compounds (5Utsunomiya-Tate N. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14883-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). To prepare uptake solution with varied pH for pH dependence experiments, MES-NaOH (pH 5.5, 5.75, 6.0, and 6.25), PIPES-NaOH (pH 6.5 and 7.0), HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5 and 8.0), and Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) were used for buffer systems (5Utsunomiya-Tate N. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14883-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments to determine the time course ofl-[14C]leucine (100 μm) uptake into oocytes expressing LAT-2 and 4F2hc indicated that the uptake was linearly dependent on incubation time up to 20 min (data not shown), so for all of the following experiments uptakes were measured for 15 min and the values were expressed as pmol/oocyte/min. The K m and V max of amino acid substrates were determined using the Eadie-Hofstee equation based on the LAT-2-mediated amino acid uptakes measured at 3, 10, 30, 100, 300, 1000, and 3000 μm. The LAT-2-mediated amino acid uptakes were calculated as the differences between the means of uptakes of the oocytes injected with cRNAs and those of the control oocytes injected with water. For the efflux measurements,14C-labeled l-leucine and other amino acids were preloaded by incubating the oocytes expressing LAT-2 and 4F2hc or LAT-1 and 4F2hc in the Na+-free uptake solution containing 150 (for LAT-2) or 20 μm (for LAT-1)l-[14C]leucine for 30 min. Then, the individual oocytes were washed five times with ice-cold Na+-free uptake solution and transferred to Na+-free uptake solution with or without nonradiolabeledl-leucine (18Kanai Y. Segawa H.

The radioactivity in the medium and the remaining radioactivity in the oocytes were measured. The values were expressed as: % radioactivity (radioactivity of medium or oocytes/(radio activity of medium + radio activity of oocytes) × 100%). Radiolabeled amino acids used were the following: U-14C-labeled compounds for l-leucine,l-alanine, l-serine, l-threonine,l-glutamine, l-isoleucine,l-valine, l-phenylalanine,l-tyrosine, l-histidine,l-aspartate, l-glutamate, l-lysine,l-arginine, l-proline, andl-cystine, [1-14C]glycine,l-[methyl-14C]methionine, andl-[side chain-3-14C]tryptophan from NEN Life Science Products, Inc.; andl-[1-14C]cysteine,l-[G-3H]asparagine,d-[1-14C]leucine,d-[1-14C]phenylalanine, andd-[1-14C]serine from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. For the measurements of the uptake and the efflux of radiolabeled amino acids in the present study, six to eight oocytes were used for each data point. Each data point in the figures represents the mean ± S.E. of uptake or efflux values (n = 6–8). To confirm the reproducibility of the results, three separate experiments were performed for each measurement using different batches of oocytes andin vitro transcribed cRNA, except for K mand V max determination (see Table I).

A cDNA clone with a 4117-base pair insert was isolated from a rat small intestine cDNA library. It contained an open reading frame from nucleotides 601 to 2199 encoding a 533-amino acid protein designated LAT-2 (L-type amino acid transporter-2). The start of the coding sequence was defined by the first ATG downstream of the in-frame stop codon and by the surrounding sequences (AAGATGG) corresponding to the KozaK consensus translation initiation sequence (35Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). The cDNA includes the poly(A) tail (17 As), which starts 22 nucleotide downstream from a typical polyadenylation signal AATAAA at nucleotide 4079. The LAT-2 amino acid sequence exhibited remarkable homology to those of rat system L transporter LAT-1 (50% identity) (18Kanai Y. Segawa H. Miyamoto K. Uchino H. Takeda E. Endou H. J. Biol.

LAT-2 also exhibited significant homology to system y+ transporters CAT1∼4 (30–31%) from mice and humans (2Palacin M. Estevez R. Bertran J. Zorzano A. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 969-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar) and amino acid permeases from bacteria and yeasts (e.g. 31% identity to Saccharomyces cerevisiaemethionine permease MUP1 (37Isnard A.D. Thomas D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar)). As shown in Fig. 1, 12 transmembrane regions were predicted on the LAT-2 amino acid sequence. There is a conserved cysteine residue (LAT-2 amino acid residue 155) in the putative extracellular loop between predicted transmembrane domains 3 and 4, which is supposed to link to 4F2hc via a disulfide bond (38Pfeiffer R. Spindler B. Loffing J. Skelly P.J. Shoemaker C.B. Verrey F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A tyrosine kinase-dependent phosphorylation site was predicted at residue 110 in the putative intracellular loop between predicted transmembrane domains 2 and 3, which is conserved for system L transporter LAT-1 but not for system y+L transporters y+LAT-1 and KIAA0245/y+LAT-2 (Fig. 1). Protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation sites were predicted in the putative intracellular loops (see legend for Fig. 1), among which one at residue 338 is conserved for LAT-1 and KIAA0245/y+LAT-2 but not for y+LAT-1. In vitro translation of LAT-2 showed a band of 49-kDa protein (Fig. 2). LAT-2 was not glycosylated by canine pancreatic microsomes (Fig. 2). LAT-2 required 4F2hc for its functional expression in Xenopus oocytes. As shown in Fig. 3 a, LAT-2 by itself did not induce l-[14C]leucine transport. 4F2hc induced a low level of l-leucine transport, probably because of the activation of oocyte endogenous transporters. The co-expression of LAT-2 and 4F2hc resulted in a large leucine uptake, indicating that 4F2hc is indispensable for the functional expression of LAT-2. The functional properties of LAT-2 were examined by co-expression with 4F2hc in Xenopus oocytes. Thel-[14C]leucine uptake was not dependent on Na+ or Cl− (Fig. 3 b). The uptake was saturable and followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with aK m value of 119.7 ± 33.6 μm(mean ± S.E. of 4 separate experiments) forl-[14C]leucine (Fig.4). Substrate selectivity of LAT-2 was investigated by inhibition experiments in which 50 μml-[14C]leucine uptake was measured in the presence of 5 mm nonlabeled amino acids. As shown in Fig.5 a, the leucine uptake was inhibited by glycine and l-isomers of the neutral amino acids and histidine. Proline, cystine, the acidic amino acids glutamate and aspartate and basic amino acids lysine and arginine did not inhibit LAT-2-mediated l-[14C]leucine uptake (Fig.5 a). β-amino acid β-alanine, taurine, and γ-amino acid γ-aminobutyric acid affected LAT-2-mediated transport less (data not shown). d-serine, d-asparagine, and some other d-amino acids exhibited weak inhibitory effects on LAT-2-mediated transport (Fig. 5 b). The leucine uptake was inhibited by system L-specific inhibitor 2-aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH) (39Christensen H.N. Handlogten M.E. Lam I. Tager H.S. Zand R. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1510-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas it was not inhibited by α-(aminomethyl)isobutyric acid or α-aminoisobutyric acid. The uptake rates of 100 μm radiolabeled amino acids were measured. As shown in Fig. 6, LAT-2 transported glycine and l-isomers of neutral amino acids, including small amino acids such as alanine, serine, threonine, and cysteine, and large amino acids with branched or aromatic side chains. LAT-2 did not transport the acidic amino acids, basic amino acids, andd-amino acids tested (Fig. 6). As shown in TableI, LAT-2 exhibits higher affinity (K m = 30–150 μm) to tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, threonine, asparagine, isoleucine, cysteine, serine, leucine, valine, and glutamine and relatively lower affinity (K m = 180–300 μm) to histidine, alanine, methionine, and glycine. The effect of pH on LAT-2-mediatedl-[14C]leucine transport was examined by changing the pH of the uptake solution. As shown in Fig.7 a, thel-[14C]leucine uptake value was higher at an acidic pH, with the peak uptake value at pH 6.25 (l-[14C]leucine uptake values at pH 7.5, 8.0, and 8.5 were significantly lower than at pH 6.25; p < 0.05; see Fig. 7 a legend). The concentration dependence ofl-[14C]leucine uptake was compared between pH 6.25 and 7.5. The K m value forl-[14C]leucine transport was altered by changing the pH of the uptake solution, whereas theV max value was less affected (K m = 96.6 μm,V max = 6.7 pmol/oocyte/min at pH 7.5;K m = 57.2 μm,V max = 7.0 pmol/oocyte/min at pH 6.25; determined on the same batch of oocytes) (Fig. 7 b). The efflux of radioactivity from the oocytes preloaded withl-[14C]leucine was measured in the absence or presence of extracellular l-leucine. As shown in Fig.8 a, time-dependent efflux of radioactivity was detected for LAT-2 in the absence ofl-leucine in the extracellular medium. Addingl-leucine into the extracellular medium did not significantly enhance the l-[14C]leucine efflux mediated via LAT-2. In contrast, only a low level of efflux of preloaded l-[14C]leucine was detected for LAT-1 in the absence of extracellular l-leucine (Fig.8 b). l-leucine applied extracellularly greatly enhanced the LAT-1-mediated l-[14C]leucine efflux. The efflux experiments were further conducted on various radiolabeled substrates. An efflux of alanine, serine, threonine, cysteine, asparagine, glutamine, isoleucine, valine, methionine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and histidine, as well as leucine, was detected (8 -25% of preloaded radioactivity for 5 min; data not shown). The expression of LAT-2 mRNA was analyzed by Northern blotting of poly(A)+ RNAs from various rat tissues. A 4.4-kilobase pair message was expressed in the jejunum, ileum, kidney, placenta, brain, testis, and skeletal muscle (Fig. 9 a). In contrast, the 4F2hc signal was detected ubiquitously.

https://openalex.org/W1996045753,"We have identified a new human cDNA, L-amino acid transporter-2 (LAT-2), that induces a system L transport activity with 4F2hc (the heavy chain of the surface antigen 4F2, also named CD98) in oocytes. Human LAT-2 is the fourth member of the family of amino acid transporters that are subunits of 4F2hc. The amino acid transport activity induced by the co-expression of 4F2hc and LAT-2 was sodium-independent and showed broad specificity for small and large zwitterionic amino acids, as well as bulky analogs (<i>e.g.</i> BCH (2-aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid)). This transport activity was highly<i>trans-</i>stimulated, suggesting an exchanger mechanism of transport. Expression of tagged N-<i>myc</i>-LAT-2 alone in oocytes did not induce amino acid transport, and the protein had an intracellular location. Co-expression of N-<i>myc</i>-LAT-2 and 4F2hc gave amino acid transport induction and expression of N-<i>myc</i>-LAT-2 at the plasma membrane of the oocytes. These data suggest that LAT-2 is an additional member of the family of 4F2 light chain subunits, which associates with 4F2hc to express a system L transport activity with broad specificity for zwitterionic amino acids. Human LAT-2 mRNA is expressed in kidney >>> placenta ≫ brain, liver > spleen, skeletal muscle, heart, small intestine, and lung. Human <i>LAT-2</i> gene localizes at chromosome 14q11.2–13 (13 cR or ∼286 kb from marker D14S1349). The high expression of LAT-2 mRNA in epithelial cells of proximal tubules, the basolateral location of 4F2hc in these cells, and the amino acid transport activity of LAT-2 suggest that this transporter contributes to the renal reabsorption of neutral amino acids in the basolateral domain of epithelial proximal tubule cells."
https://openalex.org/W1975199357,"Thrombin is a potent vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) mitogen. Because recent evidence implicates reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) in VSMC proliferation in general and atherogenesis in particular, we investigated whether ROI generation is necessary for thrombin-induced mitogenesis. Treatment of human aortic smooth muscle cells with thrombin increased DNA synthesis, an effect that was antagonized by diphenyleneiodonium but not by other inhibitors of cellular oxidase systems. This effect of thrombin was accompanied by increased O⨪2 and H2O2 generation and NADH/NADPH consumption. ROI generation in response to thrombin pretreatment could also be blocked by diphenyleneiodonium, suggesting that the NAD(P)H oxidase was necessary for ROI generation and thrombin-induced mitogenesis. Because of observed differences between the VSMC and neutrophil oxidase, we examined whether the cytosolic components of the phagocytic NAD(P)H oxidase were present in VSMC. p47phox and Rac2 were present in VSMC. Furthermore, thrombin increased expression of p47phox and Rac2 and stimulated their translocation to the cell membrane. We examined whether p47phoxmight be similarly regulated in vivo in a rat aorta balloon injury model and found that p47phox protein was increased after injury. Immunocytochemistry localized expression of p47phox to the neointima and media of injured arteries. Our data demonstrate that generation of O⨪2 and H2O2 is required for thrombin-mediated mitogenesis in VSMC and that p47phox is regulated by thrombin in vitro and is associated with vascular lesion formation in vivo.

Furthermore, thrombin increased expression of p47phox and Rac2 and stimulated their translocation to the cell membrane. We examined whether p47phoxmight be similarly regulated in vivo in a rat aorta balloon injury model and found that p47phox protein was increased after injury. Immunocytochemistry localized expression of p47phox to the neointima and media of injured arteries. Our data demonstrate that generation of O⨪2 and H2O2 is required for thrombin-mediated mitogenesis in VSMC and that p47phox is regulated by thrombin in vitro and is associated with vascular lesion formation in vivo. reactive oxygen intermediate(s) vascular smooth muscle cell(s) platelet-derived growth factor human aortic smooth muscle cell(s) diphenyleneiodonium chloride nitro blue tetrazolium 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate polymerase chain reaction reverse transcriptase-PCR Reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI)1 have well defined physiologic roles (e.g. generation of the neutrophil oxidative burst) and are postulated to contribute to pathologic conditions such as neoplastic and vascular disease (1Janssen Y.M.W. Van Houten B. Borm P.J.A. Mossman B.T. Lab. Invest. 1993; 69: 261-274PubMed Google Scholar). Physiologic concentrations of ROI (O⨪2 and H2O2) can elicit growth responses in numerous mammalian cell types (2Burdon R.H. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 775-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). It is now recognized that ROI induce activation of growth-related intracellular signaling pathways in a manner similar to that of endogenous growth factors, indicating that ROI may lie downstream of some growth factors in the course of intracellular signaling (3Lander H.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of death in the developed world. Cell types known to be involved in atherogenesis, such as endothelial cells, macrophages, and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), are sources of ROI production (4Segal A.W. Abo A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 43-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 5Griendling K.K. Minieri C.A. Ollerenshaw J.D. Alexander R.W. Circ.

Migration and proliferation of VSMC are contributory events in vascular lesions associated with atherosclerosis and restenosis after vascular injury (7Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9971) Google Scholar), and ROI can elicit specific growth and kinetic responses in VSMC (8Rao G.N. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 593-599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sundaresan M. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2311) Google Scholar). In turn, growth factors and cytokines known to play a role in atherogenesis, among them platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) (9Sundaresan M. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2311) Google Scholar), transforming growth factor-β (10Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30334-30338Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), insulin (11Krieger-Bauer H.I. Kather H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and tumor necrosis factor α (12Meier B. Radeke H.H. Selle S. Younes M. Sies H. Resch K. Habermehl G.G. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), lead to intracellular ROI production. The mechanism(s) by which these factors cause ROI accumulation is poorly understood, but it is thought to involve regulation and/or activation of specific cellular oxidases. In phagocytic cells, the major source of ROI is the NADPH oxidase, which generates O⨪2 by NADPH-derived one-electron reduction of molecular oxygen. Dismutation of O⨪2 results in the formation of H2O2. O⨪2 generation is catalyzed by a membrane-bound heterodimeric flavocytochrome (cytochromeb 558), which is composed of a 91-kDa glycoprotein (gp91phox) and a 22-kDa protein (p22phox) (13Thelen M. Dewald B. Baggiolini M. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 797-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Electron transfer from NADPH to oxygen requires interaction of the cytochrome with two cytosolic proteins, p47phox and p67phox, as well as with one of the small GTPases, Rac1 or Rac2 (14McPhail L.C. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 15De Leo F.R. Ulman K.V. Davis A.R. Jutila K.L. Quinn M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17013-17020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Upon activation, the cytosolic components translocate to the plasma membrane, and the functional NADPH oxidase is assembled (16Quinn M.T. Evans T. Loetterle L.R. Jesaitis A.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 268: 20983-20987Google Scholar). It is not clear whether the NAD(P)H oxidase of nonphagocytic cells shares the same structural properties as the NADPH-dependent oxidase of neutrophils. Recent evidence suggests that components of the NADPH oxidase are present in vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells and are activated by growth factors (5Griendling K.K. Minieri C.A. Ollerenshaw J.D. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 1141-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar, 6Matsubara T. Ziff M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 127: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In particular, p22phox is expressed in VSMC and is necessary for angiotensin II-mediated O⨪2 generation and hypertrophy in this cell type (17Ushio-Fukai M. Zafari A. Fukui T. Ishizaka N. Griendling K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23317-23321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 18Fukui T. Ishizaka N. Rajagopalan S. Laursen J.B. Capers Q. Taylor W.R. Harrison D.G. De Leon H. Wilcox J.N. Griendling K.K. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). However, apparent differences exist between the neutrophil and VSMC oxidase. gp91phox has not been detected in cultured rat smooth muscle cells, and the identities of other components of the complex are uncertain; in addition, the VSMC oxidase utilizes NADH in preference to NADPH, whereas the converse is true for the neutrophil oxidase (5Griendling K.K. Minieri C.A. Ollerenshaw J.D. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 1141-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar, 17Ushio-Fukai M. Zafari A. Fukui T. Ishizaka N. Griendling K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23317-23321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Despite these important differences, the components of the growth factor-activated oxidase in VSMC and the mechanisms by which they are regulated are not well understood. To characterize the nature of ROI generation associated with proliferation of VSMC, we have studied the ability of VSMC mitogens to generate ROI in these cell types and have characterized the presence and regulation of the cytosolic NAD(P)H oxidase component p47phox in response to atherogenic stimuli in vitroand in vivo. Initial experiments comparing ROI generation in response to various VSMC mitogens indicated that thrombin, a potent mitogen that is thought to participate in atherogenesis (19McNamara C.A. Sarembock I.J. Gimple L.W. Fenton J.W.I. Coughlin S.R. Owens G.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), elicited ROI production at higher and more sustained levels than did classic VSMC mitogens such as PDGF. Because thrombin has been shown to evoke sustained VSMC proliferation, we hypothesized that a relationship existed between the prolonged ROI generation elicited by thrombin and its effects on VSMC growth. In this report, we demonstrate 1) that ROI are generated in VSMC in response to thrombin stimulation and are necessary for thrombin-induced mitogenesis; 2) that p47phox, a component of the neutrophil NADPH oxidase, is present in VSMC and is regulated by thrombin; and 3) that p47phox protein expression is up-regulated in vivo in association with lesion formation in a rat aorta balloon injury model. These data support a model wherein induction of p47phox by thrombin augments VSMC NAD(P)H oxidase activity, which, in turn, may participate in thrombin-induced mitogenesis and, hence, in atherogenesis. Human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC) were obtained from Clonetics and were cultured as described previously (20Ruef J. Hu Z.Y. Yin L.-Y. Wu Y. Hanson S.R. Kelly A.B. Harker L.A. Rao G.N. Runge M.S. Patterson C. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Cells were used at passages 5–9. Prior to performing experiments, cells were growth-arrested at 80% confluence for 48 h with medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum. Cellular release of H2O2 was measured colorimetrically by determining the extent of horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of phenol red by H2O2. This reaction generates a compound with increased absorbance at 610 nm (21Pick E. Keisari Y. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 38: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Medium from growth-arrested HASMC in 24-well plates was aspirated and replaced by 0.5 ml of prewarmed assay buffer (140 mm NaCl, 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 5.5 mmdextrose, 0.1 g/liter phenol red, 8.5 units/ml horseradish peroxidase). After growth factor treatment, the assay buffer was removed and centrifuged for 5 min at 200 × g. NaOH was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 0.01 n. The specific absorbance at 610 nm was measured in a spectrophotometer. A standard curve was generated as described previously (21Pick E. Keisari Y. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 38: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar), and specific absorbance was converted to H2O2 concentration (μm). Cells in each well were counted using a Coulter Counter, and H2O2 release was normalized to cells per well for each experiment. In some experiments, the cells were pretreated with diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI; 10 μm) for 1 h prior to growth factor stimulation. The changes in absorbance in this assay that were inhibitable by pretreatment with catalase (100 units/ml) reflected H2O2release. Measurement of O⨪2in the media of HASMC was performed by detection of ferricytochromec reduction essentially as described (22Johnston R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Medium from growth-arrested HASMC grown in six-well plates (2 × 106 cells/well) was aspirated and replaced with 1 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 80 μmacetylated cytochrome c (Sigma) with or without thrombin or inhibitors as described. In some experiments, the cells were pretreated with DPI (10 μm) for 1 h prior to growth factor stimulation. After growth factor treatment, the assay buffer was removed and centrifuged for 2 min at 13,000 rpm to stop the reaction. The optical density was measured by spectrophotometry at 550 nm and converted to nmol of cytochrome c reduced using the extinction coefficient ΔE 550 = 21.0 × 103m−1 cm−1. The reduction of cytochrome c that was inhibitable by pretreatment with superoxide dismutase (10 units/ml) reflected O⨪2 release. Conversion of nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) to formazan was used as a measurement of intracellular O⨪2 generation. NBT was added to medium of growth-arrested HASMC to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. After treatment, microscopic examination and photography verified the generation of insoluble formazan as dark purple granules. After removal of the medium, the cells were lysed and formazan was dissolved with 2m KOH and 1.4 volumes of dimethyl sulfoxide. The absorbance was measured at 654 nm in a spectrophotometer. A standard curve was generated, and concentrations of NBT were calculated (23Dieter P. Arlt U. Fitzke E. Biol. Signals. 1995; 4: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Results were corrected for the number of cells per well for each experiment. In some experiments, the cells were pretreated with DPI (10 μm) for 1 h prior to growth factor stimulation. The changes in absorbance in this assay that were inhibitable by pretreatment with superoxide dismutase reflected O⨪2 generation. The fluorogenic substrate 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) is a cell-permeable dye that is oxidized to 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein by H2O2 and can therefore be used to monitor intracellular generation of H2O2 (24Carter W.O. Narayanan P.K. Robinson J.P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 253-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The medium of HASMC grown in 60-mm plates was replaced by Hanks' solution containing 10 μmDCFDA 30 min prior to beginning experiments. The generation of H2O2 was documented by fluorescence photomicroscopy using a blue excitation filter (450–490 nm) mounted on a fluorescence microscope (Nikon) to visualize generation of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein. Medium from HASMC grown in 24-well plates was replaced by phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 250 μm NADH or 250 μm NADPH prior to treatment with mitogens. The supernatant was removed after treatment for 1 h and was cleared by centrifugation for 5 min at 2000 × g. Light absorbance was measured using a spectrophotometer at 340 nm. Decreases in light absorbance were converted to consumption of NADH or NADPH, using the absorption coefficient E = 6.22/mm × cm. NADH and NADPH consumption were corrected for the number of cells per well as measured by a Coulter Counter. Values were expressed as the mean ± S.E. from six wells from two separate experiments. HASMC grown to near confluence in six-well tissue culture plates were made quiescent and pretreated with vehicle, DPI (10 μm), indomethacin (10 μm), allopurinol (100 μm),l-N γ-monomethylarginine (100 μm), catalase (100 units/ml), or superoxide dismutase (10 units/ml) for 1 h before the addition of thrombin (2 units/ml) or vehicle. Cells were incubated for an additional 24 h and labeled with [methyl-3H]thymidine (NEN Life Science Products) at 1 μCi/ml during the last 3 h of this time period. After labeling, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in cold 10% trichloroacetic acid and then washed with 95% ethanol. Incorporated [3H]thymidine was extracted in 0.2m NaOH and measured in a liquid scintillation counter as described previously (25Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Endege W.O. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.-E. Haber E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 490-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Values were expressed as the mean ± S.E. from six wells from two separate experiments. After treatment of growth-arrested HASMC with the respective agents, cell lysates were prepared, and immunoblotting was performed as described previously (20Ruef J. Hu Z.Y. Yin L.-Y. Wu Y. Hanson S.R. Kelly A.B. Harker L.A. Rao G.N. Runge M.S. Patterson C. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Antibodies used were polyclonal anti-human p47phox and p67phoxantibodies (Transduction Laboratories); polyclonal anti-human Rac2 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); monoclonal anti-human β-actin (Sigma); peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For immunoblot experiments, a human neutrophil cellular lysate and a PC12 lysate were used as positive controls for p47phox and p67phoxexpression, respectively. Membrane fractions from HASMC were separated as described (26Kuppuswamy D. Kerr C. Narishige T. Kasi V.S. Menick D.R. Cooper G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4500-4508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 2% Triton X-100, and the cytoskeleton was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant from this low speed centrifugation was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2.5 h in a Ti-50 rotor. The supernatant from this centrifugation was considered the cytosol, and the insoluble pellet was considered the membrane fraction. Fractions from equivalent numbers of cells were resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and immunoblot analysis was performed. HASMC were growth-arrested in 100-mm culture dishes and treated with or without thrombin. Total RNA was isolated by cesium chloride ultracentrifugation. RNA (2 μg) was converted to cDNA with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, and PCR amplification was performed with Taqpolymerase (Stratagene, Inc.). For the PCR, a set of primers generated from the human neutrophil p47phox sequence (27Volpp R.D. Nauseef W.M. Donelson J.E. Moser D.R. Clark R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7195-7199Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) was used to amplify a 305-base pair fragment of the p47phox gene product (p47–1, 5′-GTACCCAGCCAGCACTATG-3′; and P47–2, 5′-GTCTGGTTGTCTGTGGGGAG-3′). This fragment contains sequences coding for amino acids 19–133 of human neutrophil p47phox protein, and these primer pairs were designed to avoid amplification of the Src homology 3 domains, which are present in many proteins. Simultaneous amplification was performed with primers specific to the human α-tubulin gene, generating a 200-base pair product, as an internal control. Based on preliminary experiments, a cycle number of 21 was chosen for the PCR to ensure that amplification remained within the linear range. The PCR products were [32P]dATP-labeled, separated on a 1% agarose gel, and visualized by autoradiography. Bands were quantified by gel densitometry. All animal studies were approved by the animal care and use committee of the University of Texas Medical Branch. Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats (400 g, 3–4 months old) were used in the experiments. All procedures were carried out under general anesthesia induced by intraperitoneal injection of xylazine (2.2 mg/kg). Aortas were denuded completely with a 2F balloon catheter by retraction of the inflated balloon three times. Arteries were harvested 1 day, 1 week, and 3 weeks after injury for Western blot analysis and 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 6 weeks after injury for immunohistochemistry. Deendothelialized segments of arteries were identified by intravenous injection of Evans blue (0.3 ml of 5% solution in saline) 10 min before death. For immunohistochemistry, aorta sections were perfused and fixed for 6 h in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. For immunoblotting, aortas were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, immersed in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. Tissue was homogenized on ice in lysis buffer with a pestle. Cell lysates were passed through a 22-gauge needle five times. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 12 min. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (20Ruef J. Hu Z.Y. Yin L.-Y. Wu Y. Hanson S.R. Kelly A.B. Harker L.A. Rao G.N. Runge M.S. Patterson C. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Immunostaining for p47phox was performed on 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed rat aorta sections according to previously described protocols (20Ruef J. Hu Z.Y. Yin L.-Y. Wu Y. Hanson S.R. Kelly A.B. Harker L.A. Rao G.N. Runge M.S. Patterson C. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Slides were incubated with 0.3% H2O2 for 30 min and blocked with normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20 for 30 min. A 1:100 dilution of p47phox antibody (or normal rabbit IgG as a control) was applied to the slides for 12 h at 4 °C. After washing, slides were processed using the ABC Staining Kit (Vector, Inc.). p47phox staining was visualized with peroxidase using diaminobenzidine as a chromogen to yield a brown reaction product. After counterstaining with hematoxylin, slides were dehydrated and permanently mounted. Three different specimens were analyzed at each time point, and representative specimens are shown. When appropriate, data are expressed as mean ± S.E. For multiple treatment groups, a factorial analysis of variance followed by Fisher's least significant difference test was applied. Statistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05. We have examined thrombin-induced mitogenesis as a model system to understand the mechanisms of VSMC proliferation. To test the hypothesis that thrombin's mitogenic actions are mediated through ROI production, we first examined the effects of inhibitors of oxidase systems on thrombin-induced mitogenesis. We measured thymidine uptake by HASMC as a marker for DNA synthesis in response to thrombin stimulation. Consistent with previous reports (19McNamara C.A. Sarembock I.J. Gimple L.W. Fenton J.W.I. Coughlin S.R. Owens G.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), thrombin (2 units/ml) induced a 5-fold increase in thymidine uptake after 24 h (Fig.1). This mitogenic response was completely blocked by DPI (10 μm), an inhibitor of flavoprotein-containing enzymes such as the NAD(P)H oxidase, but not by indomethacin (10 μm), allopurinol (100 μm), or l-N γ-monomethylarginine (100 μm), which are inhibitors of cyclooxygenase, xanthine oxidase, and nitric-oxide synthase, respectively. DPI alone had negligible effects on DNA synthesis in the absence of thrombin. These initial experiments suggested to us that a system such as the NAD(P)H oxidase was necessary for thrombin-induced mitogenesis and provided a rationale for examining whether ROI are generated by HASMC in response to thrombin. We examined the generation of H2O2 and O⨪2 in HASMC in response to thrombin. Extracellular release of H2O2 from HASMC was measured in cells treated for 60 min with a single dose of thrombin (2 units/ml) or with PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml), which is known to generate H2O2 (9Sundaresan M. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2311) Google Scholar). H2O2was detected by a colorimetric assay of horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of phenol red. Treatment with either thrombin or PDGF-BB for 1 h significantly increased H2O2 release (5.3 ± 1.8 nmol/106 cells and 4.5 ± 1.0 nmol/106cells, respectively) compared with untreated cells (p< 0.05, Fig. 2 A). Measurements of H2O2 release at earlier time points showed half-maximal H2O2 generation after 30 min, whereas no significant release was detected after 10 min (data not shown). Interestingly, preincubation of HASMC with DPI (10 μm) for 30 min blocked the H2O2release induced by thrombin, providing evidence that a DPI-inhibitable oxidase system may be responsible for H2O2release under these conditions. To determine whether thrombin affected the rate of O⨪2generation by HASMC, we measured the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c by O⨪2. HASMC were treated with thrombin or PDGF-BB for 60 min. As shown in Fig.2 B, treatment with thrombin and PDGF-BB resulted in significantly increased O⨪2 generation (28.7 ± 3.4 nmol/106 cells and 22.5 ± 1.1 nmol/106cells, respectively) compared with untreated cells (7.1 ± 2.1 nmol/106 cells, p < 0.05). The effect of thrombin and PDGF on the rate of O⨪2 generation could also be blocked by DPI, again implicating the NAD(P)H oxidase system in the oxidative burst generated by growth factors in VSMC. Intracellular O⨪2 generation by HASMC was also quantified using a colorimetric assay that measures the reduction of NBT to formazan, a reaction that proceeds in the presence of O⨪2. This assay was used since NBT, in contrast with cytochrome c, is a membrane-permeable marker of oxidative species (23Dieter P. Arlt U. Fitzke E. Biol. Signals. 1995; 4: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 C, treatment with thrombin and PDGF-BB resulted in significantly increased O⨪2 generation (70.0 ± 10 nmol/106 cells and 52 ± 13 nmol/106cells, respectively) compared with untreated cells (10.0 ± 7 nmol/106 cells, p < 0.05). The effects of thrombin and PDGF on the rate of intracellular O⨪2 generation could also be blocked by DPI. Photomicroscopy was employed to confirm the results of Fig. 2 and to visualize directly intracellular generation of oxidative species (Fig.3). Reduction of NBT to formazan was measured in these assays. NBT reduction was tested in untreated HASMC (Fig. 3 A), HASMC treated with thrombin for 30 and 60 min (B and C), and HASMC treated with thrombin in the presence of DPI for 60 min (D). The formation of purple granules of formazan by thrombin pretreatment indicates reduction of NBT. Whereas NBT reduction may not reflect O⨪2 generation quantitatively (since, once reduced, NBT may lead to further O⨪2 production (28Auclair C. Voisin E. Greenwald R.A. CRC Handbood of Methods for Oxygen Radical Research. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1985: 123-132Google Scholar)), these results provide qualitative verification of the cytochrome c assays and indicate an intracellular accumulation of oxygen radicals in HASMC in response to thrombin stimulation. Similarly, the fluorogenic substrate DCFDA was used as a dye to demonstrate intracellular H2O2 production (Fig.2, E–H). In comparison with HASMC treated with vehicle (E), treatment of HASMC with thrombin for 30 min (F) or 60 min (G) induced intracellular H2O2 production as documented by fluorescence microscopy. H2O2 production was almost completely inhibited by DPI (H) and by catalase (not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate that thrombin elicits a burst of H2O2 and O⨪2 production in human VSMC that is blocked by the flavoprotein inhibitor DPI. On the basis of our determination that ROI generation in thrombin-treated HASMC is inhibitable by DPI, we hypothesized that these ROI were being generated, at least in part, by increased activity of a VSMC NAD(P)H oxidase system. Since DPI may inhibit flavoprotein-containing enzymes other than NAD(P)H oxidases (29Witteveen C.F.B. Giovanelli J. Kaufman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4143-4147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), it was necessary to demonstrate directly that thrombin activated NAD(P)H oxidase activity and that NADH and/or NADPH was consumed contemporaneously with ROI generation. Using an established assay (10Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30334-30338Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar,30Brightman A.O. Wang J. Miu R.K. Sun I.L. Barr R. Crane F.L. Morré D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1105: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), we measured the rate of NADH and NADPH consumption by HASMC to confirm the existence of a thrombin-inducible NAD(P)H oxidase in VSMC. As shown in Fig. 4, thrombin treatment for 60 min resulted in 6-fold increased consumption of NADH compared with untreated cells (p < 0.05) and 7-fold increased consumption of NADPH (p < 0.05). Similar effects were observed after serum stimulation, which probably reflects the presence of thrombin and other growth factors in serum. Once again, the effects of thrombin on both NADH and NADPH consumption could be blocked by DPI (p < 0.05), which by itself had minimal activity on base-line NADH or NADPH consumption.

In this report, we show that, in the presence of oxidative stress, human B lymphoma cells are unable to undergo apoptosis and die instead by a form of necrosis. This was established using the chemotherapy drug VP-16 or the calcium ionophore A23187 to induce apoptosis in Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines and by measuring classical markers of apoptotic death, including cell morphology, annexin V binding, DNA ladder formation, and caspase activation. In the presence of relatively low levels of H2O2 (75–100 μm), VP-16 and A23187 were unable to induce apoptosis in these cells. Instead, the cells underwent non-apoptotic cell death with mild cytoplasmic swelling and nuclear shrinkage, similar to the death observed when they were treated with H2O2 alone. We found that H2O2 inhibits apoptosis by depleting the cells of ATP. The effects of H2O2 can be overcome by inhibitors of poly(ADP)-ribosylation, which also preserve cellular ATP levels, and can be mimicked by agents such as oligomycin, which inhibit ATP synthesis. The results show that oxidants can manipulate cell death pathways, diverting the cell away from apoptosis. The potential physiological ramifications of this finding will be discussed.

The two most widely described forms of cell death are necrosis and apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 1Wyllie A.H. Duvall E. McGee J.O'D. Isaacson P.J. Wright N.A. Oxford Textbook of Pathology. Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 141-157Google Scholar). Necrosis is induced by severe environmental disturbances and is characterized by swelling of the cytoplasm and cytoplasmic organelles, early rupture of the plasma membrane, clumping of the chromatin, and usually swelling of the nucleus (1Wyllie A.H. Duvall E. McGee J.O'D. Isaacson P.J. Wright N.A. Oxford Textbook of Pathology. Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 141-157Google Scholar). Apoptosis is regarded as an active and progressive response to physiologic and pathologic stimuli (2Cohen J.J. Duke R.C. Fadok V.A. Sellins K.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 267-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar, 3Searle J. Kerr J.F.R. Bishop C.J. Pathol. Annu. 1982; 17: 229-259PubMed Google Scholar). It is characterized by early and prominent condensation of nuclear chromatin, loss of plasma membrane phospholipid asymmetry, activation of proteases and endonucleases, enzymatic cleavage of the DNA into oligonucleosomal fragments, and segmentation of the cells into membrane-bound “apoptotic bodies.” A significant physiological consequence of cell death by apoptosis is that the apoptotic bodies can be phagocytosed by nearby cells such that the contents are degraded intracellularly (4Savill J. Br. Med. Bull. 1997; 53: 491-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). As a result, cells dying by apoptosis cause minimal disturbance to the surrounding tissue. In contrast, the rupture of necrotic cells and the release of lysosomal and other enzymes into the surrounding tissue causes further tissue destruction and inflammation (1Wyllie A.H. Duvall E. McGee J.O'D. Isaacson P.J. Wright N.A. Oxford Textbook of Pathology. Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 141-157Google Scholar). This report examines the effects of oxidative stress on the cell death machinery. Oxidants such as superoxide, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the hydroxyl radical are generated under a variety of conditions in vivo such as during acute and chronic inflammation (5Klebanoff S. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Raven Press, New York1988: 391-444Google Scholar). Treatment of cells in vitrowith H2O2 causes DNA strand breaks (6Schraufstätter I.U. Hyslop P.A. Hinshaw D.B. Spragg R.G. Sklar L.A. Cochrane C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Depending on the concentration of H2O2employed and the type of cell being studied, the mode of cell death induced by H2O2 has been reported to be either apoptosis or necrosis (12Lennon S.V. Martin S.J. Cotter T.G. Cell Prolif. 1991; 24: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 13Buttke T.M. Sandstrom P.A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 17: 7-10Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2104) Google Scholar, 14Lee Y.-J. Shacter E. Blood. 1997; 89: 4480-4492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with necrosis generally being reported with higher concentrations of the oxidant (12Lennon S.V. Martin S.J. Cotter T.G. Cell Prolif. 1991; 24: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 15Gardner A.M. Xu F.-H. Fady C. Jacoby F.J. Duffy D.C. Tu Y. Lightenstein A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we found that Burkitt's lymphoma cells were highly susceptible to killing by H2O2 and that overexpression of the bcl-2 oncogene, which is known to inhibit apoptosis (16Hockenbery D. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3544) Google Scholar), did not prevent H2O2-induced cell death (14Lee Y.-J. Shacter E. Blood. 1997; 89: 4480-4492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), contrary to earlier studies suggesting that bcl-2 protects cells from oxidant-induced killing (17Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3297) Google Scholar). It was concluded that bcl-2was unable to inhibit the cell killing by H2O2because the primary form of cell death induced was non-apoptotic. In the present studies, we investigated the effects of H2O2 on the cell death machinery and found that H2O2 actually inhibits induction of apoptosis in Burkitt's lymphoma cells. That is, in the presence of H2O2, agents that normally kill Burkitt's lymphoma cells by inducing apoptosis are no longer able to do so. H2O2 inhibited all the major steps of apoptosis. The effects of H2O2 can be explained by its ability to deplete the cells of ATP. Thus, oxidative stress can manipulate the mechanism of cell death, diverting it away from apoptosis to necrosis. The Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines JLP 119, ST-486, and BL-41 were provided by Kishor Bhatia from the laboratory of Ian Magrath (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 50 μmβ-mercaptoethanol at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in air. Exponentially growing cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in fresh media to achieve a culture density of 5 × 105 cells/ml. H2O2 was added to the cell suspensions at the beginning of the experiments or after a 30-min preincubation with VP-16. The cells were then incubated for 2–24 h as indicated in the text. The poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)1 inhibitors 3-aminobenzamide (3AB) and 4-hydroxyquinazoline (4HQ) were added to cell suspensions 30 min prior to H2O2. For the experiments with oligomycin, cells were washed and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium without glucose but supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. After adaptation to this medium for 30 min, cells were exposed to 10 μmoligomycin. Cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide (PI) and visualized using fluorescence microscopy as described previously (14Lee Y.-J. Shacter E. Blood. 1997; 89: 4480-4492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A minimum of 200 cells were counted and classified as follows: (i) live cells (normal nuclei: blue chromatin with organized structure); (ii) membrane-intact apoptotic cells (bright blue chromatin, which is highly condensed, marginated, or fragmented); (iii) necrotic cells (red, enlarged nuclei with smooth normal structure); (iv) membrane-permeable apoptotic cells (bright red chromatin, highly condensed or fragmented); (v) pyknotic/necrotic cells (dense, bright red, slightly condensed nuclei sometimes divided into two or three spheres). Total cellular DNA was extracted by the procedure of Smith et al. (18Smith C.A. Williams G. Kingston R. Jenkinson E.J. Owen J.J.T. Nature. 1989; 337: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). DNA samples (equivalent to ∼2 × 106 cells) were applied to 2% agarose gels (molecular grade agarose, Life Technologies, Inc.), and electrophoresis was performed using 1× TBE for 12∼15 h at 30 V.HaeIII-digested φX174 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) was used as a molecular weight standard. The apoptosis detection kit (catalog no. KNX50) from R&D Systems was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were analyzed (10,000 cells/sample) on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) using CELLQUEST flow cytometric analysis software. FITC was detected using a 530/30-nm bandpass filter (FL1 channel), and PI was measured at 610 nm (FL2 channel). Crossover of FITC fluorescence into the PI detection window was electronically compensated. The activities of CPP32 (caspase-3) and other caspases were measured as described by others with minor modifications (19Sarin A. Wu M.L. Henkart P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2445-2450Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells treated variously were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ or Mg2+, and lysed in ICE buffer (50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose, and 0.1% Triton X-100) at a concentration of 107 cells/ml for 20 min on ice. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, supernatants were transferred to a tube containing dithiothreitol at a final concentration of 10 mm. 7-Amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin (AFC)-conjugated peptide substrate for each caspase was added to the cell lysates (75 μl, 1.5 × 106 cells) to a final concentration of 50 μm, and the final reaction volume was adjusted to 200 μl with ICE buffer. After incubation at 30 °C for 1 h, reactions were stopped by adding 2 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ or Mg2+ to each tube and the levels of released AFC were measured using a spectrofluorometer (PTI Delta Scan 1, Photon Technology International, Monmouth Junction, NJ) with excitation at 400 nm and emission at 505 nm. A 10 μm solution of free AFC gives about 10 × 104 fluorescence units in this system. The specific substrates for each caspase were as follows: carbobenzoxy (Cbz)-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-AFC (z-YVAD-AFC) for caspase-1, Cbz-Val-Asp-Val-Ala-Asp-AFC (z-VDVAD-AFC) for caspase-2, Cbz-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-AFC (z-DEVD-AFC) for caspases-3 and -7, Cbz-Val-Glu-Ile-Asp-AFC (z-VEID-AFC) for caspase-6, and Cbz-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-AFC (z-IETD-AFC) for caspase-8. The substrates were all dissolved in Me2SO and stored at −20 °C. Total cell lysates were prepared, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to membranes as described previously (14Lee Y.-J. Shacter E. Blood. 1997; 89: 4480-4492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After blocking with 5% milk, membranes were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-bovine PARP, mouse monoclonal anti-human CPP32, rabbit polyclonal anti-human DNA-PKcs, mouse monoclonal anti-human NuMA, rabbit polyclonal anti-human Rho-GDI/D4-GDI, mouse monoclonal anti-human ICH-1, or goat polyclonal anti-human lamin B, followed by a 1-h incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Bands were visualized by chemiluminescence using the ECL kit from NEN Life Science Products. Intracellular ATP levels were determined using luciferin-luciferase (20Spragg R.G. Hinshaw D.B. Hyslop P.A. Schraufstätter I.U. Cochrane C.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1471-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (∼5 × 105cells) that had been treated with H2O2 or oligomycin were collected by centrifugation; resuspended in 250 μl of 10 mm KH2PO4, 4 mmMgSO4, pH 7.4; heated at 98 °C for 4 min; and placed on ice. At the time of the assay, a 50-μl sample (∼1 × 105 cells) was added to 100 μl of 50 mmNaAsO2, 20 mm MgSO4, pH 7.4, and 80 μg of luciferin/luciferase. Light emission was quantified in a Dynatech ML 3000 microtiter plate luminometer (Chantilly, VA). ATP standard curves were run in all experiments and were linear in the range of 5–2500 nm. Stock ATP concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically at 259 nm using an extinction coefficient of 15,400. VP-16, 3-AB, 4-HQ, oligomycin, A23187, and luciferin-luciferase were purchased from Sigma. AFC-labeled caspase substrates were from Enzyme Systems Products (Dublin, CA). Antibodies to intracellular proteins were from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA) for PARP, Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) for CPP32, Oncogene Sciences (Cambridge, MA) for DNA-PK and NuMA, PharMingen (San Diego, CA) for ICH-1 and GDI/D4-GDI, and Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) for Lamin B. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Southern Biotechnologies (Birmingham, AL). VP-16 (etoposide) is a topoisomerase II inhibitor, which is widely used for cancer chemotherapy (21Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 351-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (1920) Google Scholar) and is known to kill a variety of different tumor cells by inducing apoptosis. As shown in Fig.1, VP-16 kills JLP 119 Burkitt's lymphoma cells entirely by inducing apoptosis. The time course of cell killing varies depending on the concentration of drug employed. Thus, at low concentrations of drug (0.5 μg/ml), induction of apoptosis in 75% of the cells (as determined by fluorescence microscopy) takes place gradually over the course of a 22-h incubation (Fig.1 A). By comparison, 80% of the cells show morphological signs of apoptosis within 6 h when treated with 5 μg/ml VP-16. VP-16-treated cells also show other classical markers of apoptosis (shown in Fig. 1, B–D, for the 5 μg/ml treatment) such as oligonucleosomal degradation of the DNA (ladder formation); cleavage of the caspase-3 protein (CPP32); activation of the enzyme activities of caspases-2, -3, and -6; and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Note that the substrate for assaying caspase-3 activity (DEVD) can also be cleaved by caspase-7 (22Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar), and possibly caspases-8 and 10 (23Kidd V.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 533-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Hence, the activity displayed with this substrate is referred to as “caspase-3-like.” In contrast to VP-16, when Burkitt's lymphoma cells are treated with 75–100 μm H2O2, the predominant form of cell death induced is non-apoptotic. This was determined previously by measuring molecular DNA fragmentation by conventional agarose gel electrophoresis and a FACS terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-x nick end labeling assay (14Lee Y.-J. Shacter E. Blood. 1997; 89: 4480-4492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Examination of cell morphology by fluorescence microscopy shows that most of the cells treated with 75–100 μmH2O2 remain roughly the same size as untreated cells and the nucleus undergoes mild nuclear condensation (pyknosis) without fragmentation. Examples of the morphological changes induced by H2O2 can be seen in Fig.2, where panel Ashows control (untreated) cells and panel B shows cells treated with 75 μm H2O2. Because these cells bear none of the classical biochemical or morphological features of apoptosis ( (14Lee Y.-J. Shacter E. Blood. 1997; 89: 4480-4492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and see below) yet show smaller nuclei than classical necrotic cells, we refer to them as pyknotic/necrotic. The data shown are for the Burkitt's lymphoma cell line JLP 119. Identical results were obtained with two other Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines: ST-486 and BL-41. To gain insight into the possible effects of oxidative stress on cell death pathways, we tested the effect of H2O2 on VP-16-induced apoptosis. In these experiments, 75 μm H2O2 was added to the cells 30 min after adding VP-16 (0.5 μg/ml) and the cells were allowed to incubate overnight. The mode of cell death was determined by fluorescence microscopy using Hoechst/PI staining. Photographs showing representative cell morphologies are given in Fig.2, and quantitative results are shown in Fig.3 A. The induction of apoptosis by 1 μg/ml VP-16 (Fig. 2 C) was almost completely inhibited by addition of 75 μm H2O2 (Fig.2 D) and the cells died instead by pyknosis/necrosis, identical to the mode of cell death induced by H2O2 alone (Fig. 2 B). In control experiments, H2O2 did not interact with and inactivate VP-16 directly. This was determined by preincubating VP-16 with 100 μm H2O2 for 30 min, removing the H2O2 with catalase, and then adding the VP-16 to the cells. Full apoptosis inducing activity was maintained. In addition, direct treatment with H2O2 did not alter the absorption spectrum of VP-16. The ability of H2O2 to inhibit VP-16-induced apoptosis was confirmed using two other Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines, ST-486 and BL-41 (data not shown). The effects of H2O2 on VP-16-induced cell killing could be overcome by co-treating the cells with two inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). These were 3AB (0.5 mm, Fig. 2 F) and 4HQ (50 μm, data not shown). H2O2 also inhibited induction of DNA ladder formation by VP-16 and this inhibition was also overcome by 3AB (Fig. 3 B) and 4HQ (data not shown). The concentrations of 3AB and 4HQ employed in these experiments are expected to cause specific inhibition of PARP without affecting mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation reactions (24Banasik M. Komura H. Shimoyama M. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1569-1575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neither compound caused any toxicity to the cells by themselves (Figs. 2 E and 3 A). Both PARP inhibitors also converted the mode of cell death induced by H2O2 alone from pyknosis/necrosis to apoptosis (Fig. 2 F and Fig. 3; data shown for 3AB only). Identical results were obtained when the calcium ionophore A23187 was employed to induce apoptosis instead of VP-16 (Fig. 3). A23187-induced apoptosis was inhibited by addition of 75 μmH2O2, and this effect of H2O2 was overcome by inhibitors of PARP. A concentration-response study of cell death induced by H2O2 alone is shown in Fig.4. Note that, at most, only 20% of the cells die by apoptosis and this occurs at a narrow concentration range around 50 μm. At higher concentrations (75–100 μm), the predominant form of cell death induced is pyknosis/necrosis. One of the earliest markers of apoptosis is the translocation of phosphatidylserine from the inner to the outer layer of the plasma membrane (25Martin S.J. Reutelingsperger C.P.M. McGahon A.J. Rader J.A. van Schie R.C.A.A. LaFace D.M. Green D.R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1545-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (2570) Google Scholar). This change can be detected by testing for binding of the protein annexin V to the cell surface (26Koopman G. Reutelingsperger C.P.M. Kuijten G.A.M. Keehnen R.M.J. Pals S.T. van Oers M.H.J. Blood. 1994; 84: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether cells undergo this early apoptotic change in the presence of H2O2, ST-486 cells were treated with VP-16, H2O2, or both for various times and annexin V binding was measured by FACS analysis. ST-486 cells were employed in place of JLP 119 cells because the latter had unusually high control levels of annexin V staining which interfered with quantification of VP-16-induced staining. As shown in Fig.5, VP-16 (30 μg/ml) induced a 4–5-fold induction of annexin V binding over the course of a 6-h incubation, during which time roughly 60–70% of the cells developed morphological features of apoptosis. H2O2 inhibited this increase by 50–60% and did not by itself induce any increase in annexin V staining. Another hallmark feature of apoptosis inhibited by H2O2 is the activation of caspases (reviewed in Ref. 22Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar). In the following experiments, different caspase activities were measured by incubating cell extracts from treated and control cells with specific peptide substrates for each enzyme. As shown in Fig. 6, caspase-1 activity was constitutively expressed in JLP 119 cells and was not induced further by VP-16 treatment. Caspases-2, -3, -6, and -8 were all induced by VP-16 treatment, with caspase-3-like (DEVDase) activities being the most profoundly activated. Co-treatment of the cells with H2O2 prevented this activation in all cases. Inhibition of the activation of caspase activity occurred only when H2O2 was added to cells and not when it was added to cell extracts, indicating that the oxidant inhibits activation of the enzymes in vivo and does not directly inhibit enzyme activity (data not shown). Inhibition of caspase activation by H2O2 was confirmed by Western blot analysis of cell extracts taken from cells treated for various times with VP-16 ± H2O2. These immunoassays look for proteolytic cleavage of known intracellular caspase substrates (22Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 7 show the results obtained using antibodies specific for 7 different caspase substrates: caspases-3 and -2 themselves (CPP-32 and ICH-1, respectively), a 470-kDa DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), a 240-kDa nuclear matrix protein (NuMA), PARP, GDP dissociation inhibitor (D4-GDI), and lamin B. H2O2 alone did not induce cleavage of any of these proteins, consistent with the conclusion that it kills cells through a non-apoptotic mechanism. VP-16 induced cleavage of all of the proteins. H2O2inhibited VP-16-induced proteolysis by 40–90% for each of the proteins examined (determined by densitometric scanning of the blots). Note that cleavage of CPP-32 is only detected as loss of the pro-enzyme band; the cleavage product is rapidly degraded in the cells and thus is not seen by Western analysis. Similar findings have been reported by other researchers (27Jänicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar, 28Juin P. Pelletier M. Oliver L. Tremblais K. Grégoire M. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 28: 17559-17564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with H2O2 is known to cause a rapid depletion of NAD and ATP levels, in part through activation of poly(ADP)ribosylation (6Schraufstätter I.U. Hyslop P.A. Hinshaw D.B. Spragg R.G. Sklar L.A. Cochrane C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4908-4912Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar,10Schraufstätter I.U. Hinshaw D.B. Hyslop P.A. Spragg R.G. Cochrane C.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1312-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The fact that H2O2 inhibited so many steps in apoptosis and that the inhibition could be overcome by PARP inhibitors suggested that H2O2 may be acting by lowering cellular energy stores. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of H2O2 on cellular ATP levels in JLP 119 cells using a luciferin-luciferase-based chemiluminescence assay (20Spragg R.G. Hinshaw D.B. Hyslop P.A. Schraufstätter I.U. Cochrane C.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1471-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The results are shown in Fig.8. At the subtoxic concentration of 25 μm (Fig. 4), H2O2 had no effect on ATP levels in the cells. At 50 μm, which induces both pyknosis/necrosis and apoptosis, there is a transient drop in ATP levels, which returns to control levels in 4 h. Concentrations of 75 and 100 μm, which kill cells entirely by pyknosis/necrosis and completely inhibit VP-16-induced apoptosis cause a rapid drop (within 30 min) in ATP, which remains low throughout the duration of the incubation. No attempt was made to measure ATP levels after an overnight incubation because the cells lose their permeability barrier, thus precluding accurate assessment of intracellular ATP levels. In order to determine whether the effect of H2O2 on ATP levels is responsible for its ability to inhibit apoptosis, conditions were developed so that we could either 1) prevent the drop in ATP and see if H2O2 is still able to inhibit apoptosis or 2) recreate the drop in ATP with a different agent to see if this inhibits apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 9, the drop in cellular ATP induced by 75 μmH2O2 could be completely inhibited by co-treating the cells with the PARP inhibitor 4HQ. Similar results were obtained with 3AB (data not shown). The effect of H2O2 on cellular ATP levels could be mimicked by treating the cells with the ATP synthesis inhibitor oligomycin in glucose-free medium (to prevent ATP synthesis through glycolysis) (Fig.9). Using these manipulations to control cellular ATP levels, we found that depletion of ATP with oligomycin mimicked the effects of H2O2 while protection of cellular ATP by co-treatment with 4HQ overcame the effects of H2O2, thus suggesting that H2O2 inhibits apoptosis by reducing cellular ATP levels. This was demonstrated at two time points (4 and 22 h) following H2O2 treatment (Fig.10). When cells were treated for 4 h with 5 μg/ml VP-16 in the presence of 75 μmH2O2, apoptosis was profoundly inhibited. Note that since H2O2-treated cells do not appear dead (PI-positive) under the fluorescence microscope until much later time points (12–22 h), the level of cell death observed at this time point was also dramatically decreased. The same effect was achieved by depleting cellular ATP with oligomycin. The ability of VP-16 to induce apoptosis in the presence of H2O2 was restored by preventing the drop in ATP with 4HQ. Similar results were obtained when cells were examined after an overnight incubation with 0.5 μg/ml VP-16 except that the overall level of cell death was higher: in the presence of H2O2 or oligomycin, the mode of cell death was converted from apoptosis to pyknosis/necrosis and this effect could be overcome by preventing the drop in ATP with 4HQ. The results show that H2O2 inhibits the ability of agents such as the chemotherapy drug VP-16 or the calcium ionophore A23187 to induce apoptosis in Burkitt's lymphoma cells. The effect of H2O2 on cell death is dominant. Thus, cells treated with VP-16 or A23187 in the presence of H2O2 resemble cells treated with H2O2 alone. Cells killed in the presence of 75–100 μm H2O2 are primarily pyknotic/necrotic. They show none of the classical markers of apoptosis but also are not typically necrotic since the nuclei are somewhat condensed instead of swollen. The biochemical steps that lead to this nuclear morphology are not known but should be examined since they may be common to both apoptosis and necrosis (29Fady C. Gardner A. Jacoby F. Briskin K.

Group A (hHa1, hHa3-I, hHa3-II, hHa4) and B (hHa7, hHa8) each contains structurally related hair keratins, whereas group C members hHa2, hHa5, and hHa6 represent structurally rather unrelated hair keratins. Antibodies produced against these individual hair keratins, first analyzed for specificity by one- dimensional Western blots of total hair keratins, were used to establish the two-dimensional catalog of the human type I hair keratin subfamily. The catalog comprises two different series of type I hair keratins: a strongly expressed, Coomassie-stainable series containing hair keratins hHa1, hHa3-I/II, hHa4, and hHa5, and a weakly expressed, immunodetectable series harboring hHa2, hHa6 hHa7, and hHa8. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical expression studies on scalp follicles show that two hair keratins, hHa2 and hHa5, define the early stage of hair differentiation, i.e. hHa5 expression in hair matrix and hHa5/hHa2 coexpression in the early hair cuticle cells. Whereas cuticular differentiation proceeds without the expression of further type I hair keratins, matrix cells embark on the cortical pathway by sequentially expressing hHa1, hHa3-I/II, and hHa4, which are supplemented by hHa6 at an advanced stage of cortical differentiation, and hHa8, which is expressed heterogeneously in cortex cells. Thus, six type I hair keratins are involved in the terminal differentiation of anagen hairs. The expression of hHa7 is conspicuously different from that of the other hair keratins in that it does not occur in the large anagen follicles of terminal scalp hairs but only in central cortex cells of the rare and small follicle type that gives rise to vellus hairs.

Both keratins are divided into type I (acidic) and type II (basic to neutral) members, which form the 10-nm intermediate filament cytoskeletal network of epithelial cells through obligatory association of equimolar amounts of type I and type II keratins (for review, see Refs. 1Steinert P.M.

Previous studies on the composition of the hair keratin family by one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the chemically unmodified keratins indicated the presence of four type I (44–48 kDa) and four type II members (55–60 kDa), which were invariably found in hairs of different species (9Heid H.W. Werner E. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1986; 32: 101-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 10Lynch M.H. O'Guin W.M. Hardy C. Mak L. Sun T-T. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2593-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). According to a proposal by Heid et al. (9Heid H.W. Werner E. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1986; 32: 101-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), the hair keratin proteins were collectively designatedH for hair, b for the basic hair keratins (Hb),1 and a for the acidic hair keratins (Ha), respectively, with the two dimensionally resolved and Coomassie-stained protein spots of each subfamily being numbered from 1 to 4 in an counterclockwise manner. In addition to the major hair keratins Ha1–4 and Hb1–4, a weakly expressed additional keratin pair was designated Hax/Hbx (9Heid H.W. Werner E. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1986; 32: 101-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 11Heid H.W. Moll I. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1988; 37: 137-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Independent of the species, the hair keratin family was therefore assumed to comprise 10 individual members and thus to be numerically smaller than that of the epithelial keratins. This notion seemed to be confirmed by the subsequent molecular cloning of four type I mouse hair keratins, mHa1–mHa4, and four type II sheep wool keratins, for which the designation K2.9–K2.12 has been proposed (12Bertolino A.P.

Expression studies in mouse skin revealed a differential synthesis of hair keratins in the central hair-forming compartment of the follicle. Apparently, only one type I hair keratin, mHa2, was expressed in the peripheral hair cuticle. In contrast, the inner hair cortex exhibited the sequential expression of three type I keratins, mHa1, mHa3, and mHa4, whereas keratins of the hair matrix were unknown (15Winter H. Siry P. Tobiasch E. Schweizer J. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recent investigations in our laboratory aimed at characterizing human hair keratin genes have shown that the hair keratin family is distinctly more complex than previously assumed on the basis of protein studies. Screening of a human scalp cDNA library with probes derived from mouse and sheep hair keratin clones yielded seven type I hair keratin clones (hHa1, hHa2, hHa3-I, hHa3-II, hHa4, hHa5, and hHa6) and four type II hair keratin clones (hHb1, hHb3, hHb5, and hHb6) (Refs. 19Fink P.

Fluorescence in situhybridization analyses to human metaphase chromosomes using preliminarily characterized genomic clones for the type I hair keratin hHa2 and the type II hair keratin hHb1 showed that, just like the human epithelial keratin genes, the hair keratin genes were located in a type-specific manner on chromosomes 17q12–q21 (type I) and 12q13 (type II), respectively (21Rogers M.A. Nischt R. Korge B. Krieg T. Fink T.M. Lichter P. Winter H. Schweizer J. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Considering further evidences for keratin gene clustering (Ref. 24Rogers M.A. Winter H. Wolf C. Jacobs M. Schweizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26683-26691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar and references therein), we recently subjected a human P1 artificial chromosome (PAC) library to a PCR-based screening with specific primers for the arbitrarily selected type I hair keratins hHa6 and hHa3-II. We were able to characterize 190 kilobase pairs of genomic DNA, which contained 10 type I hair keratin genes. They were clustered within a 140-kilobase pair domain and displayed the same direction of transcription (24Rogers M.A. Winter H. Wolf C. Jacobs M. Schweizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26683-26691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Besides the genes for the seven type I hair keratins previously characterized as cDNA clones, the DNA contig contained functional genes for two novel type I hair keratins, hHa7 and hHa8, and one transcribed hair keratin pseudogene,ϕhHaA. Because there was no evidence for further hair or epithelial keratin genes on the 190-kilobase pair PAC contig, the 140-kilobase pair gene domain was assumed to harbor the entire complement of human type I hair keratin genes (24Rogers M.A. Winter H. Wolf C. Jacobs M. Schweizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26683-26691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the present study we have explored the expression pattern of the nine functional type I hair keratin genes in the human hair follicle. To this purpose, antibodies were raised against the individual keratins, which were first analyzed for specificity by one-dimensional Western blots of total hair keratins and then used to establish a catalog of human type I hair keratins on the basis of two-dimensional Western blots. Subsequent in situ hybridization experiments and indirect immunofluorescence studies not only revealed a complex and differential keratin expression in all areas of the hair-forming compartment, which was indicative of an early and late phase of hair differentiation, but also yielded unexpected findings of hair phenotype specific keratin expression. Plucked beard hairs from two volunteers were freed from adhering outer and inner root sheaths as described (9Heid H.W. Werner E. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1986; 32: 101-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The lower part of the follicles was cut off and extracted for hair keratins as described (25Winter H. Hofmann I. Langbein L. Rogers M.A. Schweizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32345-32352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). One-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE; 10% polyacrylamide) and two-dimensional resolution of hair keratins by isoelectric focusing (IEF) were carried out as described (25Winter H.

For IEF, the following mixture of ampholines was used: pH 5–7 (0.8% w/v), pH 4–6 (0.8% w/v), and pH 3–10 (0.4% w/v) (Bio-Rad, München, Germany). One- and two-dimensional gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. For Western blot procedures, gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Eschborn, Germany) by semi-dry blotting. After staining (0.1% Coomassie Blue R250, 40% methanol, 1% acetic acid), destaining (50% methanol), and blocking with 5% nonfat milk powder in Tris-buffered saline, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies (see “Antibodies”). Peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (see “Antibodies”) were diluted 1:10,000 in 2.5% nonfat milk powder, 0.1% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline. Secondary antibodies were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). ISH on cryostat sections of human scalp or plucked hair follicles was carried out as described previously in detail (23Rogers M.A. Langbein L. Praetzel S. Krieg T. Winter H. Schweizer J.

For the detection of the various hair keratin mRNAs, the following probes were used: hHa3-I, a 250-bp 3′ PCR fragment; hHa4, a 150-bp 3′ PCR fragment; hHa6, a 170-bp PCR fragment from exon 1; hHa7, a 300-bp PCR fragment from exon 1; and hHa8, a 250-bp PCR fragment from exon 1 (all of the preceding were cloned into pMosBlue); hHa3-II, a 450-bpBamHI/XhoI 3′ fragment cloned into Bluscript II(KS) hHa5 (22Rogers MA.

Probes were radiolabeled byin vitro transcription using 35S rCTP. For the recording of the ISH signals by reflection microscopy, a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 410 UV, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) was used. The instrument allows simultaneous visualization of ISH in epi-illumination for the detection of reflection signals and transmitted light in bright field for hematoxylin staining. The two signal channels were combined by an overlay in pseudocolor (transmission image in green, electronically changed intoblack/white, reflection image, i.e.IHS signals, in red). IIF, on cryostat sections of human scalp or plucked hair follicles, was carried out as described previously in detail by Winter et al. (25Winter H. Hofmann I. Langbein L. Rogers M.A. Schweizer J. J.

Antisera against human hair keratins were produced in guinea pigs by the injection of specific synthetic oligopeptides (100 μg/injection; see Table II), coupled to keyhole limpet protein. After the third booster injection, the following antisera were obtained: hHa3-II (ECL dilution 1:5000, IIF dilution 1:500); hHa4 (ECL dilution 1:1,000, IIF dilution 1:300); hHa5 (ECL dilution 1:30,000, IIF dilution 1:2,500); hHa6 (ECL dilution 1:40,000, IIF dilution 1:1000); hHa7 (ECL dilution 1:2,000; IIF dilution 1:1,000); and hHa8 (ECL, dilution 1:80,000; IIF, dilution 1:5,000).

Open table in a new tab Multiple sequence comparisons of the hair keratins encoded by the nine functional genes contained in the human type I hair keratin gene domain led to a striking sorting into two groups, A and B, each containing highly related hair keratins, and a third group, C, of structurally unrelated hair keratins (Table I). Group A comprised hair keratins hHa1, hHa3-I, hHa3-II, and hHa4, and group B contained hair keratins hHa7 and hHa8. In addition to highly homologous rod domains, the members of groups A and B each possessed head domains of identical length (24Rogers M.A. Winter H. Wolf C. Jacobs M. Schweizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26683-26691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), for which the sequence homology was nearly as high as that of the rod domains (Table I). The third group, C, comprised hair keratins hHa2, hHa5, and hHa6. Their structural relationship was restricted solely to the rod domains, for which homology values were distinctly lower than those found for the members of groups A and B (Ref. 24Rogers M.A. Winter H. Wolf C. Jacobs M. Schweizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26683-26691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar and Table I). Both, mono- and polyclonal antibodies were raised against specific synthetic peptides that, in most cases, corresponded to the last 15–20 amino acid residues of the structurally variable tail domains (Table I) of the various type I hair keratins (TableII). One of the exceptions was the group A hair keratin isoforms hHa3-I and hHa3-II, in which the tail domains possessed close structural resemblance (24Rogers M.A. Winter H. Wolf C. Jacobs M. Schweizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26683-26691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We selected a hHa3-II carboxyl-terminal peptide region exhibiting the only perceptible sequence deviation from the hHa3-I tail for antibody production. Nevertheless, of its 17 amino acid residues, the hHa3-II peptide still contained nine amino acid residues in common with the hHa3-I isoform (Table II). Total hair keratins extracts of human anagen hair bulbs from which the outer and inner root sheaths had been mechanically removed were separated by SDS-PAGE. Because the one-dimensional resolution of hair keratins was primarily aimed at verifying the specificity of the antibodies, no special efforts were made to optimally resolve the individual type I and type II hair keratins. Hence, the Coomassie-stained pattern shown in Fig.1, lane a, consisted of a broad but distinct protein band ranging from 55 to 61 kDa, which contained the type II hair keratins, and a protein doublet between 44 kDa and 48 kDa, which harbored the smaller type I hair keratins. In accordance with previous investigations (25Winter H. Hofmann I. Langbein L. Rogers M.A. Schweizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32345-32352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), hHa1 immunodetection revealed a strong protein band apparently covering the entire upper portion of the Coomassie-stained bipartite type I hair keratin pattern (Fig. 1, lane c). In contrast, the hHa2 antiserum detected a protein above hHa1 that was not stainable with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 1,lane d). Consistently, the hHa2 antiserum reacted with a second, slightly larger, but extremely weak band, which in most cases was hardly separated from the major hHa2-reactive band (arrowhead in lane d). The hHa3-II, hHa4, and hHa5 antisera each detected single proteins with similar mobilities in the lower portion of the Coomassie-stained type I hair keratin pattern (Fig. 1, lanes e–g). The hHa6 antiserum reacted with a protein, which similar to hHa2, was located outside of the Coomassie-stained type I hair keratin pattern (Fig. 1,lane h). The same held true for the hHa7 and hHa8 antisera; each of them detected a single protein band at ∼54 kDa, immediately subjacent to the Coomassie-stained collective type II hair keratin band at 55–61 kDa (Fig. 1, lanes i and j). In most cases, the molecular mass values of the hair keratin proteins deduced from their migration in the gel were close to the values calculated from their sequences (Table II). This was, however, not the case for both hHa5, which despite a calculated molecular mass of 47,719 kDa migrated at the level of the small hHa3-II or hHa4 hair keratins, and hHa7/hHa8, for which the deduced molecular mass values deviated even more from the respective calculated values (Table II). The two-dimensional pattern of human hair keratins obtained by IEF in an ampholine mixture that differed only slightly from that used by Heidet al. (11Heid H.W. Moll I. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1988; 37: 137-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) is shown in Fig.2 a. It can be clearly seen that the high molecular mass portion (47–48 kDa) of the type I hair keratins was resolved into two protein spots of decreasing intensity, whereas the low molecular mass portion (44–46 kDa) consisted of three distinct protein spots, of which the most acidic one was slightly weaker in intensity than the others. After electroblotting and Coomassie staining, membranes were first exposed separately to the various antibodies (results not shown). For a more rational approach toward the arrangement of the reacting protein spots relative to each other, the membranes were then reacted consecutively with several antibody combinations. Fig. 2 bshows that the hHa1 antibody recognized the entire upper series of Coomassie-stainable protein spots, indicating that they represent isoelectric hHa1 variants. Re-exposure of the membrane to the hHa2 antibody confirmed the localization of this hair keratin above the Coomassie-stained pattern. hHa2 showed up as a single protein spot, which was located exactly above the main hHa1 variant (Fig.2 b). Moreover, the antibody reacted with a slightly larger and weakly expressed protein component, which was also seen in one-dimensional blots (arrowheads in Figs. 1 d and2 b). Additional exposure of the membrane to the hHa3-II antiserum revealed a specific reaction with the least acidic spot of the low molecular mass protein series (Fig. 2 b; see also Fig. 2 e). The detection of only one protein by the hHa3-II antibody in both one- and two-dimensional Western blots strongly indicated that, despite a substantial sequence homology of the hHa3-II peptide selected for immunization with the corresponding reg"

Expression ofArabidopsis thioredoxin AtTRX3 in theSaccharomyces thioredoxin Δ strain EMY63 restores a wild-type cell cycle, the ability to grow on methionine sulfoxide, and H2O2 tolerance. In order to isolate thioredoxin targets related to these phenotypes, we prepared a C35S (Escherichia coli numbering) thioredoxin mutant to stabilize the intermediate disulfide bridged complex and we added a polyhistidine N-terminal extension in order to purify the complex rapidly.

Expression in the Δ thioredoxin strain EMY63 allowed us to isolate a complex of the thioredoxin with YLR109, an abundant yeast protein related to PMP20, a peroxisomal protein of Candida. No function has so far been attributed to this protein or to the other numerous homologues described in plants, animals, fungi, and prokaryotes.

Three types of function have regularly been proposed. In the first type, they act as structural components required for the activity and synthesis of some components of T7 DNA polymerase or for phage assembly. These reactions are mostly redox independent, while the two other types are directly redox dependent. In the second type, they are intermediate energy donors to some enzymes like ribonucleotide reductase, PAPS1 reductase, methionine sulfoxide reductase, and hydrogen peroxide reductase which accept energy through a proton transfer on cysteines. In the third type, they regulate the function of enzymes or transcription factors by modifying their disulfide bridged conformation. Examples of redox regulated enzymes are most Calvin cycle enzymes, CF1 and malate dehydrogenase of plant chloroplasts (3Buchanan B.B. Schürmann P. Jacquot J.P. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Redox regulated transcription factors have been described in mammals, for example, NF-κB and AP1 (4Schenck H. Klein M. Erdbrügger W. Dröge W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1672-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). In most studies, the suggestion that a thioredoxin is the cellular reductant of a particular protein is sustained almost exclusively byin vitro experiments. Nevertheless, other cellular reducers like glutaredoxins, NADPH reductases, or even glutathione are also able to reduce disulfide bridges. The situation is even more complex in plants which present multiple thioredoxin genes and their products. For example, the Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes at least five cytosolic thioredoxins h (5Rivera-Madrid R. Mestres D. Marinho P. Jacquot J.P. Decottignies P. Miginiac-Maslow M. Meyer Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5620-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and seven chloroplastic thioredoxins (2Jacquot J.P. Lancelin J.M. Meyer Y.

While the inactivation of each of the genes does not significantly alter yeast growth, the disruption of both genes profoundly affects cell viability. This mutant strain (EMY63) is unable to use sulfate as sole a sulfur source and grows very poorly on methionine sulfoxide. Rapid growth is obtained with methionine but the cell cycle is profoundly modified, with a longer S phase and a shorter G1 phase. Moreover, this mutant yeast shows an increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide (11Muller E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9194-9200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,12Muller E.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1805-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the five A. thaliana thioredoxins h (AtTRX1 to AtTRX5) confer a normal cell cycle and the ability to grow on methionine sulfoxide as unique sulfur source when expressed in the yeast mutant. AtTRX3 confers H2O2 tolerance but cannot restore sulfur assimilation, while AtTRX2 restores sulfur assimilation, but is unable to confer H2O2 tolerance (13Mouaheb N. Thomas D. Verdoucq L. Monfort P. Meyer Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3312-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These data clearly indicate that yeast thioredoxins interact with multiple targets while each A. thaliana thioredoxin h interacts only with some of them. One way to characterize the exact function of the unique cytosolic Trx in mammals or of each Trx in plants would be the isolation of in vivo complexes between one thioredoxin and its target(s) protein(s). This approach has been unsuccessful so far, probably because the complexes have a very short half-life. At the present time, only two articles, one on human, the second on plants report indirect evidence for such complexes using the two-hybrid system (14Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 15Bower M.S. Matias D.M. Fernandes-Carvalho E. Mazzurco M. Gu T. Rothstein S.J. Goring D.R. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1641-1650PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we have developed a new in vivo approach in order to isolate biochemically complexes between thioredoxins and their cellular targets. We have used the recent knowledge on the reaction mechanism of thioredoxins to stabilize the complexes. In vitro studies have shown that Trx reduce protein disulfide bridges through a two-step reaction involving the two cysteine residues of the conserved redox active site WCxPC (x = G or P). In the first step, the more N-terminal cysteine of the Trx (equivalent to the Cys32 of Escherichia coliTrxA) attacks the target protein disulfide bridge, reducing one cysteine of the S-S bridge and establishing a disulfide bridge with the second cysteine of the target, forming a mixed intermediate between the Trx and the target protein. The second step involves an intramolecular attack by the second cysteine of the Trx (equivalent to the Cys35 for the E. coli thioredoxin) on the mixed disulfide intermediate, releasing the reduced target protein and the oxidized Trx (16Kallis G.B. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10261-10265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Wynn R. Cocco M.J. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11807-11813Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The intermediate disulfide bridged complex formed in vitro is stable if the second cysteine of the Trx is replaced by a structural analog of cysteine, like a serine or an alanine (18Qin J. Clore G.M. Poindexter Kennedy W.M. Huth J.R. Gronenborn A.M. Structure. 1995; 3: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 17Wynn R. Cocco M.J. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11807-11813Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In our report, we show that the ectopic expression of the C35S mutated AtTRX3 (amino acid numbering according to the E. colithioredoxin) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae induces H2O2 hypersensitivity, thus partially mimicking the phenotype of the yeast Δ Trx mutant. This suggests that the dominant negative mutant protein undergoes a stable interaction with the target responsible for H2O2 tolerance. We have purified this complex and shown that it results from the interaction of the mutated Trx with the product of ORF YLR109, an abundant protein to which no function has so far been attributed. We show that the E. coli recombinant YLR109 product presents all the characteristics of the peroxiredoxin family, and that its peroxidase activity is dependent of Trx activity. Moreover, we describe well conserved sequences similar to YLR109 for almost all organisms, including mammals, plants, and bacteria, suggesting an identical peroxiredoxin activity for these proteins. PCR products were cloned into the plasmid pMosBlue (Amersham Life Science), and introduced inE. coli strain DH5α. Plasmid pET16b (Novagen) was used to express recombinant protein in E. coli BL21(DE3), and the centromeric shuttle plasmid YCp2 (19Cole G.M. Stone D.E. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 510-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) was used to express thioredoxin in S. cerevisiae. EMY60 is the standard wild-type strain (Mata, ade2-1, ade3-100,his3-11, leu2-3, lys2-801,trp1-1, ura3-1) and EMY63 is the Trx double mutant, isogenic with EMY60 except at the Trx loci (Mata,ade2-1, ade3-100, his3-11,leu2-3, lys2-801, trp1-1,ura3-1, trx1::TRP1,trx2::LEU2). These two strains were generous gifts from E. G. D. Muller (University of Washington). Yeast minimal medium YNBRaf contained 7 g liter−1 Bacto-YNB (Difco) and 2% raffinose. YNBRGal minimal medium contained 7 g liter−1 Bacto-YNB, 1% raffinose, and 2% galactose. Manipulation of DNA, E. coli,and S. cerevisiae were performed using standard methods (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Ford N. Nolan C. Ferguson M. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.7-1.85Google Scholar,21Shermann F. Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1991: 3-21Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae cells were transformed after lithium chloride treatment (22Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA synthesis by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed with the Pfu DNA Polymerase (Stratagene). DNA was purified with Qiaquick Gel extraction kit (Qiagen). All restriction enzymes were provided by Roche Molecular Biochemicals and T4 DNA ligase was provided by Promega. All constructs were checked by sequencing. Dideoxynucleotide sequencing was performed with the ABI Prism Big Dye Terminator Cycle Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems), in our laboratory on a ABI 377A sequencer. AtTRX3 and YTRX1 ORFs were amplified by PCR using specific oligonucleotides designed to introduce a NdeI site upstream of the start codon and aBamHI site downstream from the termination codon. Site-directed mutagenesis of the thioredoxins active site were obtained by PCR-mediated overlap extension using a pair of complementary mutated oligonucleotides (23Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 77: 51-59Crossref Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). Single amino acid mutants of Trx were created by PCR using the following nucleotide pairs: for C35S AtTRX3, oligonucleotide AtTrx3CSdir 3′ (5′-GCAACATGGTGCCCACCTTCACG-3′) and oligonucleotide AtTrx3CSdir5′ (5′-AAACGTGAAGGTGGGCACCATG-3′); for C35S YTRX1, oligonucleotide YTrx1CSdir5′ (5′- GCAATCATTTTACTTGGACCGCACC-3′) and oligonucleotide YTrx1CSdir3′ (5′-GGTGCGGTCCAAGTAAAATGATTGC-3′) and then cloned in pMosBlue plasmid. After dideoxynucleotide sequencing, the mutated DNA fragments were digested by NdeI andBamHI restriction enzymes and subcloned into pET16b plasmid. This plasmid allows the fusion of a 10-His residue extension at the N-terminal part of the mutated thioredoxins, allowing purification on Ni2+ column (see below). A second round of PCR amplification was done with an oligonucleotide (16bMluIHis, 5′-TTTACGCGTAAGAAGGAGATATACCATGGGC-3′) designed to introduce aMluI restriction site upstream from the start codon of the polyhistidine extension, and with the same BamHI site containing oligonucleotide. To express thioredoxins and thioredoxin mutants in yeast, we cloned the corresponding ORFs by using the two unique cloning sites MluI and BamHI, present in the shuttle vector YCp2. This plasmid contains the URA3 gene as a selectable marker and ensures protein production after induction of the GAL1 promoter. Dideoxynucleotide sequencing was performed with the YCp5′ oligonucleotide (5′-CCTCTATACTTTAACGTCAAGG-3′), upstream from the MluI site in YCp2 plasmid. Recombinant site-mutated Trx were purified from E. coli and S. cerevisiae cells. Expression conditions are different for E. coli and S. cerevisiae but purification procedures are the same. BL21(DE3) containing pET16b-mutated Trx were grown in 1 liter of LB medium up to OD600 nm = 0.5, and recombinant protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted and stored at −80 °C for the subsequent protein extraction. 10-ml cultures of EMY60 or EMY63, containing YCp-polyHis-mutated Trx, were grown at 30 °C in YNBRaf appropriate medium, and then diluted in 5 liters of YNBRGal medium with an initial OD600 nm = 0.05. Cells were collected at OD600 nm = 1, and stored at −80 °C. E. coli-or S. cerevisiae-induced cells were broken by a hydraulic press (Carver, model 3968) at 3500 p.s.i., at −80 °C. Broken cells were resuspended in 10 ml of chilled 1 × Binding Buffer (His.BindTM System, Novagen), containing a protease inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM Mini, EDTA-Free, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and DNase A. Soluble proteins were recovered by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. Cell fragments were frozen and submitted two more times to protein extraction. All protein-containing supernatants were pooled and applied on the His.BindTM (Ni2+ resin) equilibrated column, and proteins were purified as recommended by Novagen. Purified proteins were washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, by ultrafiltration on a Microcon column (Amicon-Millipore) and submitted to subsequent analyses. His-tagged YTRX1 thioredoxin activity was tested in a 500-μl reaction volume using the insulin-disulfide reduction assay (24Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). YTRX1 served as positive control and bovine serum albumin as a negative control. The assay was monitored by addition of 1 mm DTT, and measurements were performed at OD650 nm for 45 min on a spectrophotometer (Model DU7400, Beckman). Metal-catalyzed oxidation DNA cleavage protection assays were performed as described previously (25Klimowski L. Chandrashekar R. Tripp C.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Reactive oxygen species were generated for 30 min at room temperature by addition of 0.32 mm DTT in the presence of 3 μm FeCl3. Reactions mixtures were incubated at room temperature with 20 μm YLR109 and 1 μg of plasmid DNA for 4 h. DNA degradation was checked by electrophoresis. His-tagged YLR109 and AtTPX2 peroxidase activity assays were performed as follows: the reaction was initiated by the addition of either A. thaliana NADPH Trx reductase (NTR: 180 nm) or H2O2 (100 μm) to 1 ml of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, reaction medium containing, 670 nm Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Trx h, 200 μm NADPH, 10–50 μg (0.5–2.5 μm) of Prx. The reaction was followed spectrophotometrically at 340 nm at 20 °C. Purified proteins were submitted to denaturing SDS-PAGE on a standard 15% polyacrylamide gel (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Ford N. Nolan C. Ferguson M. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.7-1.85Google Scholar), under reducing or nonreducing conditions. Gels were subsequently electroblotted for 40 min onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against YTRX1 and AtTRX3 (1:10000 dilution), goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad), and a colorimetric detection system (HRP color, Bio-Rad) were used to visualize protein and complexes according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified proteins were diluted in the standard SDS buffer without β-mercaptoethanol and submitted to a first SDS-PAGE on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. Gel slices were treated for 1 h with the reducing SDS buffer (containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol), applied on the top of 12% polyacrylamide gels and submitted to a second SDS-PAGE. Proteins were stained by Coomassie Blue, or revealed by silver nitrate detection, using the Bio-Rad Silver Stain Plus kit. To test H2O2 sensitivity, the transformed cells were first grown in YNBRGal up to a concentration of 107 cells per ml, and then diluted to OD600 nm= 0.2. Four 1/5 dilutions of this cell suspensions were prepared and a 15-μl droplet of each were plated on YNBRGal-agar medium containing different H2O2 concentrations. Plates were then incubated 3 days at 30 °C. DNA content of the transformant cells was measured by a flow cytometry technique. 10 ml of cells were grown in YNBRGal medium to OD600 nm = 0.5, centrifuged, and washed with 10 ml of Tris-HCl, 50 mm, pH 8. Cells were fixed overnight at 4 °C in 70% ethanol, centrifuged, and resuspended in 1 ml of Tris-HCl, 50 mm, pH 8, containing 1 mg ml−1 RNase A, and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After centrifugation, the cell pellet was treated for 1 h at 50 °C with 50 μl of proteinase K at 10 μg ml−1, resuspended in 500 μl of propidium iodide solution (50 μg ml−1), and stained overnight in the dark at 4 °C. Fluorescence was analyzed using a Bruker ACR 1000 flow cytometer. Data were collected with the FRIED software which was used to estimate the proportion of cells in G1 phase. Because our goal was the isolation of Trx targets and because Trx are not abundant proteins, we chose to use polyhistidine-tagged Trx in order to facilitate protein and complex purification. The first step of our work was to demonstrate that the addition of such His-extension does not modify thioredoxin activityin vivo. For this control, we chose the YTRX1 thioredoxin, which can restore wild-type phenotype when expressed in the Trx double mutant yeast EMY63. The YTRX1 open reading frame was then introduced into a production plasmid, pET16b, using theNdeI/BamHI restriction sites in order to fuse a polyhistidine extension at the N-terminal end. The recombinant protein was then produced in E. coli and purified on an Ni2+ column. The in vitro activity of thioredoxin is usually tested by measurement of insulin reduction and the subsequent β-chain precipitation is followed spectrophotometrically at 650 nm (24Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We checked that YTRX1 sharing an N-terminal polyhistidine extension is fully active in the reduction of human insulin (data not shown). We also had to check that the His-tagged YTRX1 is still able to complement EMY63 phenotype. For this purpose, the His-tagged ORF was transferred into the centromeric shuttle plasmid YCp2 under control of the inductive GAL1promoter. Transformed yeast EMY63 (Δ YTRX1, Δ YTRX2) were selected on YNBRaf minimal medium, and then transferred to the YNBRGal medium to ensure induction (see “Experimental Procedures”). The His-tagged YTRX1 complements EMY63 in all aspects, allowing growth on sulfate or methionine sulfoxide, re-establishing a normal cell cycle and H2O2 tolerance (not shown). We have constructed two shuttle plasmids, one encoding the HisYTRX1C35S mutant and the second encoding HisAtTRX3C35S, a His-tagged and mutated version of A. thaliana AtTRX3. Expression of the wild-type AtTRX3 allows EMY63 to grow with a normal cell cycle on methionine and to use methionine sulfoxide efficiently as sole sulfur source. AtTRX3 also allows EMY63 to tolerate 0.8 mm H2O2, but does not allow growth on sulfate. Based on the catalytic mechanism of Trx, if the mixed disulfide intermediates are stable, C35S Trx mutants should compete with the endogenous Trx for the target proteins and induce a mutant phenotype in the wild-type yeast. After introduction and induction of the mutant Trx in the wild-type yeast EMY60, the cells remained able to grow on sulfate and on methionine sulfoxide as sole sulfur source. This suggested that the mutated proteins do not efficiently compete with the endogenous Trx for the target proteins implicated in these aspects of the phenotype (not shown). In contrast, a small reduction of the number of cells in the G1 phase is observed in cells expressing HisYTRX1C35S and HisAtTRX3C35S, compared with EMY60 YCp2 wild-type cells (Fig.1). These results suggest a weak interaction between these mutated Trx and a protein involved in the S phase. But the most important phenotypic effect is a reduction of H2O2 tolerance induced by HisAtTRX3C35S as is shown by the reduced growth of EMY60 expressing HisAtTRX3C35S on 0.5 mm H2O2 (Fig.2 B). EMY60 expressing HisAtTRX3C35S was almost unable to grow on a medium containing 0.8 mm H2O2 (Fig. 2 C). This strongly suggests that HisAtTRX3C35S competes efficiently with the endogenous yeast Trx, probably by the formation of a stable complex with the protein target(s) implicated in H2O2tolerance. In contrast, expression of HisYTRX1C35S does not modify H2O2 tolerance of EMY60 cells (Fig. 2,B and C), because of a weak production of HisYTRX1C35S recombinant protein (data not shown).Figure 2H2O2 tolerance of wild-type yeast EMY60 expressing mutated thioredoxins. Cells were first grown in YNBRGal medium to a density of about 107cells per ml, and then diluted to OD600 nm = 0.2. 1/5 dilutions were prepared and 15 μl of each were plated on YNBRGal medium containing different H2O2concentrations, and incubated 3 days at 30 °C.

Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Purified extracts were then submitted to denaturing SDS-PAGE under nonreducing (without β-mercaptoethanol) conditions to preserve disulfide-bonded complexes, and analyzed by Western blot with anti-AtTRX3 antibodies (Fig. 3). For comparison, extracts of E. coli expressing HisAtTRX3C35S were purified on Ni2+ column and analyzed in the same way. In E. coli, most HisAtTRX3C35S is present as dimers and trimers (Fig. 3 A). Although dimers could result from a disulfide bridge between C32 of the two monomers, the presence of trimers suggests that the additional cysteine situated in the N-terminal part of the protein is also implicated in disulfide bridges. In EMY60, most HisAtTRX3C35S is monomeric and some dimers are present. Only one faint band that could correspond to a complex is detectable at 50 kDa. In EMY63 (the Trx minus strain), although HisAtTRX3C35S is expressed at equivalent levels as in EMY60, a far more complex pattern is observed. Using anti-AtTRX3 antibodies, five abundant bands are detectable by Western blot. A two-dimensional electrophoresis consisting in a nonreducing SDS-PAGE as first dimension followed by a reducing SDS-PAGE was analyzed by silver staining (Fig.3 B). Two bands of the first dimension correspond to the Trx monomer and dimer, while three bands (molecular mass 34, 36, and 50 kDa) are composed of Trx associated with one protein of 20 kDa. The silver staining also reveals the presence, in the Ni2+column eluate, of a free amount of the 20-kDa protein which is not disulfide-bonded to a Trx and which was consequently not detected by immunoblotting of the first dimension. One possibility is that the mutated Trx is bridged with one subunit of a target dimer, stabilized by noncovalent interactions. In the presence of SDS, the dimeric structure is destroyed, releasing a free target monomer and a Trx-target complex. In addition, a faint band of 40 kDa shown by anarrow is detectable. This band is abundant in large scale purifications performed using EMY63 and EMY60 cells and corresponds to alcohol dehydrogenase I (ADHI P00330), a Zn2+-binding protein, and which shows affinity for Ni2+. This protein is not related to Trx. In contrast, the 20-kDa band is present only in EMY63 cells expressing the mutated Trx HisAtTRX3C35S. The 20-kDa protein band was purified from 1 liter of EMY63/HisAtTRX3C35S cells in exponential growth (OD600 nm = 0.5) on Ni2+ column followed by a reducing SDS-PAGE. The Coomassie Blue-stained band was submitted to microsequencing. Because the N-terminal part of the protein was blocked, trypsin peptides were analyzed and showed the following sequences: ETNPGTDVTVSSVE, MEV(DV)Q(VA)I(VI)K, DQVI(VA)VTXDNPYA, IGFELAVGDGVYXS, A(NY)(PI)(VQ)Q(IV)(TG)(SF)N(AM)FQA, and (FM)P(GQ)TVYPDV. All these sequences are present in the yeast ORF product YLR109, a predicted 19.1-kDa cytosolic protein of unknown function. Similarities with other proteins were searched using blastx in the NCBI nonredundant data base. It appears that YLR109 is highly related to a peroxisomal membrane protein from Candida boidini (27Garrard L.J. Goodman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13929-13937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to a small number of proteins from very different sources including prokaryotes (Synechocystis, Hemophilus, andRhyzobium) and fungi (Aspergillus, Malassezia,and Lipomyces). We have searched for similar sequences in EST data bases using tblastn. Thirty-one human, 75 mouse, and 5Drosophila ESTs allowed the reconstruction of a unique and complete cDNA for each organism. In higher plants, 32 A. thaliana ESTs were found which can be build in to two contigs. We have fully sequenced one complete clone of each contig corresponding to two highly related cDNAs, deposited under the names AtTPX1 (GenBankAF121355) and AtTPX2 (GenBank AF121356). One complete cDNA was also reconstituted from ESTs for rice and Populus and partial clones can be deduced from maize, Pinus, andRicinus ESTs. This suggests the presence of highly conserved genes in fungi, animals, plants, and bacteria. The multiple alignment shown in Fig. 4indicates that the conservation is particularly high around Cys62 of YLR109. The good conservation of the C-terminal part of the proteins for all eukaryotic members is obvious. This part of the sequence addresses C. boidini PMP20 to the peroxisome, suggesting that in eukaryotes, all these proteins could be located in the peroxisome. In contrast, the prokaryotic sequences present various C termini. The Hemophilus sequence shows an interesting particularity: it is composed of two domains, the N-terminal region, which is similar to YLR109, followed by a C-terminal domain similar to a glutaredoxin active site. This structure reinforces the idea that all these proteins interact with dithiol reducers. No function has been attributed to YLR109 and homologous proteins so far, but they are abundantly accumulated in Saccharomycesand in Arabidopsis callus as shown by the size of th"

We have identified the cDNA sequences encoding two 3′→5′ exonucleases (TREX1 and TREX2) from mammalian cells. The TREX1 and TREX2 proteins are 304 and 236 amino acids in length, respectively. Analysis of the TREX1 and TREX2 sequences identifies three conserved motifs that likely generate the exonuclease active site in these enzymes. The specific amino acids in these three conserved motifs suggest that these mammalian exonucleases are most closely related to the proofreading exonucleases of the bacterial replicative DNA polymerases and the RNase T enzymes. Expression of TREX1 and TREX2 inEscherichia coli demonstrates that these recombinant proteins are active 3′→5′ exonucleases. The recombinant TREX1 protein was purified, and exonuclease activity was measured using single-stranded, partial duplex, and mispaired oligonucleotide DNA substrates. The greatest activity of the TREX1 protein was detected using a partial duplex DNA containing five mispaired nucleotides at the 3′ terminus. No activity was detected using single-stranded RNA or an RNA-DNA partial duplex.

For each cell division 4 billion nucleotides must be correctly replicated. The polymerization of incorrect or structurally modified nucleotides into DNA generates the 3′ termini that block chain elongation by the DNA polymerases. Oxidative damage to DNA can result in fragmented nucleotides at the 3′ termini that can not be elongated by DNA polymerases. Genetic recombination and mismatch repair pathways can require the removal of normal nucleotides from the 3′ termini of DNA chains. Enzymes containing 3′→5′ exonuclease activity remove these mismatched, modified, fragmented, and normal nucleotides to generate the appropriate 3′ termini for subsequent steps in the DNA metabolic pathways. Several 3′→5′ exonucleases have been described from a variety of animal cells (1Lindahl T. Gally J.A. Edelman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 5014-5019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hollis G.F. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8074-8079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Skarnes W. Bonin P.

These exonucleases demonstrate similar biochemical properties, but the relationships between these enzymes are not known. Also, there are 3′→5′ exonucleases contained in the structural domains of mammalian DNA pols1 δ (6Chung D.W. Zhang J. Tan C.-K. Davie E.W. So A.G. Downey K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11197-11201Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), ε (7Kesti T. Frantti H. Syväoja J.E. J. Biol.

These proofreading 3′→5′ exonucleases excise incorrectly polymerized nucleotides during DNA synthesis. Thus, a variety of 3′→5′ exonucleases are present in mammalian cells. These exonucleases might function in multiple pathways to generate 3′ termini that support further steps such as polymerization or ligation. Excision of incorrectly polymerized nucleotides by proofreading 3′→5′ exonucleases is an important mechanism to minimize errors during DNA synthesis. The polymerase-associated proofreading exonuclease was first described using Escherichia coli DNA pol I (9Brutlag D. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 241-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and further substantiated by the identification of viral, bacterial, and mammalian DNA polymerases with 3′→5′ exonuclease domains (10Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar). A separate protein provides a proofreading function for the replicative DNA pol III in the Gram-negative bacteria (11Scheuermann R.H. Echols H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7747-7751Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In these bacteria the exonuclease (ε subunit) and the polymerase (α subunit) are encoded by separate genes, and these subunits form a tight association within the polymerase III complex (12Maki H. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4389-4392Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The mammalian DNA pols α and β do not contain 3′→5′ exonucleases, and tightly associated proofreading exonucleases have not been unequivocally associated with these polymerases. However, the inefficient extension of mismatched 3′ termini by the mammalian DNA pol α leads to the suggestion that a separate proofreading exonuclease might function with this enzyme (13Perrino F.W. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3085-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar,14Perrino F.W. Loeb L.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5226-5231Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The incorporation of nucleotide analogs into DNA is a common strategy in antitumor and antiviral therapies. Polymerization of these analogs frequently generates 3′ termini that are poorly extended by DNA polymerases (15Wright G.E. Brown N.C. Pharmacol. Ther. 1990; 47: 447-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The proofreading exonucleases associated with the mammalian DNA polymerases have been shown to remove some nucleotide analogs, but the efficiency of this excision is poor (16Lee M.Y. Byrnes J.J. Downey K.M. So A.G. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 17Huang P. Chubb S. Hertel L.W. Grindey G.B. Plunkett W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6110-6117PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kamiya K. Huang P. Plunkett W. J. Biol.

In some cases, 3′→5′ exonucleases not associated with the mammalian DNA polymerases have been shown to remove nucleotide analogs from the 3′ termini (4Perrino F.W. Miller H. Ealey K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16357-16363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Skalski V. Liu S.H. Cheng Y.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The actions of 3′→5′ exonucleases would be expected to limit the amount of nucleotide analog that is incorporated into DNA and diminish the therapeutic potential of these drugs. The repair of oxidative DNA damage can require the removal of deoxyribose fragments from 3′ termini. In E. coli, the 3′-excision activities of exonuclease III and endonuclease IV are believed to be responsible for removing the 3′-deoxyribose fragments that block DNA polymerase action (20Demple B. Harrison L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 915-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). The APE protein is the eukaryotic homolog of exonuclease III (21Demple B. Herman T. Chen D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11450-11454Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), and this enzyme provides the major apurinic endonuclease activity in mammalian cells. However, unlike exonuclease III, the APE protein has only a modest 3′→5′ exonuclease activity, suggesting that additional repair exonucleases might exist in mammalian cells to remove 3′-blocking lesions (22Chen D.S. Herman T. Demple B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5907-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Models of genetic recombination and mismatch repair suggest that normal nucleotides might be removed from the 3′ termini of DNA by 3′→5′ exonucleases. The final steps of a genetic recombination process involving DNA reannealing might require a degradative repair step by a 3′→5′ exonuclease to remove unannealed DNA tails (23Kowalczykowski S.C. Dixon D.A. Eggleston A.K. Lauder S.D. Rehrauer W.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 401-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In E. coli, a 3′-overhanging tail might be removed by exonuclease I. During DNA mismatch repair excision reactions can result in the removal of hundreds of nucleotides to generate a gapped DNA molecule for repair synthesis (24Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). When repair is directed from a position 3′ to the mismatch, the 3′→5′ exonuclease activity of exonuclease I is required (25Cooper D.L. Lahue R.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11823-11829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar 3′→5′ exonucleases might be required in mammalian cells. Detection of 3′→5′ exonuclease activities in mammalian cells has been relatively straightforward, but identification of the genes encoding these enzymes has been elusive. In a previous study, we identified a 30-kDa protein containing 3′→5′ exonuclease by activity gel analysis (19Perrino F.W. Mazur D.J. Ward H. Harvey S. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; (in press): 30Google Scholar). We report here the identification and expression of the cDNA encoding this exonuclease. A second exonuclease was identified in data base searches. The two exonucleases have been named TREX1 and TREX2 to indicate the Three prime RepairEXonuclease activities of these enzymes. The TREX1 cDNA has also been identified in an independent study and referred to as DNase III (53Höss M. Robins P. Naven T.J.P. Pappin D.J.C. Sgouros J. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences and properties of the TREX1 and TREX2 proteins suggest the involvement of these independent 3′-excision enzymes in the mammalian DNA replication and repair pathways. Bovine cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of calf thymus mRNA using a poly(dT) primer and the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The degenerate inosine-containing oligomers (TCAGCAGAATTCGCI(T/C)TIGA(A/G)GGI(T/C)TI(T/A)(C/G)IGCICCICA(A/ G)GG) and (GGTGTTGGATCCIC(T/G)IATIA(A/G)(A/G)TTIAGIA(A/ G)(A/G)TCIGC(G/A)TC) were used in a polymerase chain reaction to recover a fragment of the TREX1 bovine cDNA (TREX1b). The TREX1b fragment was cloned and sequenced using an automated DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer ABI Prism 377). The ESTs for the complete human TREX1 (TREX1h), mouse TREX1 (TREX1m), and mouse TREX2 (TREX2m) were identified in BLAST searches of the GenBankTM dbEST data base. TREX1h (GenBankTM accession no. W24304), TREX1m (GenBankTM accession no. AA242227), and TREX2m (GenBankTM accession no. AA060540) were obtained from Genome Systems Inc. (St. Louis, MO). The TREX2h was identified on a COSMID clone (GenBankTM accession no. AF002998). For expression in E. coli the TREX1 and TREX2 cDNA sequences were recovered from parent vectors using polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the pOXO4 T7 expression vector (26Parsonage D. Miller H. Ross R.P. Claiborne A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3161-3167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to generate the pTREX1h, pTREX1m, and pTREX2m plasmids. A ribosome binding sequence AGGAGGT was included eight nucleotides 5′ to the initiator ATG in the upstream oligomer. Expression of the TREX1 and TREX2 proteins was in E. coli BL21(DE3). Cells containing pTREX1 plasmids were grown to A 595 = 0.2 in LB medium at 26 °C, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm for 16 h. Cells containing pTREX2 were grown in M9 medium at 37 °C. Cell extracts were prepared by sonication, and total protein in extracts was estimated by A 280. The TREX1h and TREX1m proteins were purified from bacterial extracts essentially as described (4Perrino F.W. Miller H. Ealey K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16357-16363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Perrino F.W. Mazur D.J. Ward H. Harvey S. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; (in press): 30Google Scholar). Reactions contained 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 12.5 nm 5′-32P-labeled oligomer as indicated in the figure legends, and 1 μl of the appropriate enzyme dilution. Partial duplex DNA substrates were prepared by hybridizing a 20-mer or 21-mer to a 35-mer as described (27Perrino F.W. Mekosh H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23043-23051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 35-mer·21-mer duplexes contain one to eight mispaired nucleotides at the 3′ terminus. The RNA 10-mer, araCMP-terminated 21-mer, and the complementary DNA templates have been described (19Perrino F.W. Mazur D.J. Ward H. Harvey S. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; (in press): 30Google Scholar, 28Harrington C. Perrino F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26664-26669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Enzyme dilutions were prepared in 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 4 °C. Reactions were performed at 37 °C for the indicated times and were quenched by the addition of 30 μl of cold 95% ethanol. Samples were dried in vacuoand resuspended in 5 μl of 95% formamide dye mixture. Samples were heated at 100 °C for 3 min and subjected to electrophoresis on a 23% polyacrylamide denaturing gel. Radiolabeled bands were visualized and quantified by phosphorimagery (Molecular Dynamics). One unit of exonuclease is the amount of enzyme needed to degrade 1 pmol of DNA 3′ termini in 1 min at 37 °C. The 30-kDa bovine exonuclease was subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. The protein band (12 pmols) was excised from the acrylamide gel and digested with trypsin in situ; the recovered peptides were separated by high pressure liquid chromatography. Selected peptides were sequenced by Edman degradation in the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University (Ken Williams, Director). In previous work from this laboratory, a 3′→5′ exonuclease was purified from human myeloblastic leukemia cells as an activity that removes araCMP from the 3′ termini of DNA (4Perrino F.W. Miller H. Ealey K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16357-16363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain sufficient quantities of the 3′→5′ exonuclease for primary structural analysis, the same enzyme was purified from calf thymus tissue (19Perrino F.W. Mazur D.J. Ward H. Harvey S. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; (in press): 30Google Scholar). The bovine exonuclease demonstrates the same DNA substrate specificity and physical properties as the human exonuclease (4Perrino F.W. Miller H. Ealey K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16357-16363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bovine and human enzymes exhibit a native molecular mass of about 52 kDa by gel filtration analysis (4Perrino F.W. Miller H. Ealey K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16357-16363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). The 3′→5′ exonuclease activities are associated with a 30-kDa protein when examined by SDS-PAGE activity gel analysis (19Perrino F.W. Mazur D.J. Ward H. Harvey S. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; (in press): 30Google Scholar). Together these results suggest that the 3′→5′ exonuclease is a dimer composed of two identical subunits. Purified bovine enzyme was used to generate tryptic peptides for primary sequence analysis. Four peptide sequences were obtained (Fig.1). Degenerate oligomer primers were designed from two of the peptides, and polymerase chain reaction was used to recover a 201-base pair fragment of the bovine TREX1b cDNA. The nucleotide sequence of this 201-base pair fragment provided the deduced primary amino acid sequence of a contiguous 67-amino acid fragment of TREX1b (Fig. 1). Data base searches were performed using the DNA and deduced protein sequences of the TREX1b fragment to identify ESTs encoding the complete TREX1h and TREX1m cDNA sequences. The nucleotide sequence of the TREX1h cDNA confirmed the presence of a single complete open reading frame of 304 amino acids encoding a protein of 32,375 molecular weight (Fig. 1). Similarly, the TREX1m cDNA identified a protein of 304 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 32,629 (Fig. 1). Thus, the predicted size of the TREX1-encoded protein was in close agreement with the estimated size of the purified human and bovine exonucleases. A second 3′→5′ exonuclease cDNA TREX2 was identified in the GenBankTM data base. The TREX2 sequence was detected in a BLAST search of the dbEST data base using TREX1 as the query sequence. The mouse TREX2m cDNA was found in the EST data base, but no EST was identified for the human TREX2h. The low abundance of TREX2m EST sequences and the absence of the TREX2h in the data base suggest that the TREX2 mRNA might be a rare or unstable mRNA in mammalian cells. The TREX2h sequence was identified as a single exon on a COSMID clone by searching the GenBankTM data base. The TREX2h and TREX2m nucleotide sequences encode proteins of 236 amino acids with molecular weights of 25,922 and 25,955, respectively. Alignments of the TREX1 and TREX2 sequences indicate that the two exonucleases are approximately 44% identical (Fig. 1). The COSMID clone containing the TREX2h sequence contains chromosomal DNA from the Xq28 region between markers DXS904 and BGN, 2G. Nordsiek, G. Gloeckner, K. Blechschmidt, B. Hinzmann, B. Drescher, J. Weber, R. Schattevoy, P. Kioschis, A. Poustka, M. Platzer, and Rosenthal, A., unpublished data. suggesting that the TREX2h gene maps to this position on the X-chromosome. Three sequence motifs are present in the TREX proteins that identify amino acids likely positioned at the exonuclease active sites. Structural and mutagenesis studies in the exonuclease domains of the E. coli DNA pol I large fragment and the bacteriophage T4 DNA pol have identified specific amino acids that participate directly in the exonuclease catalyzed reaction (30Freemont P.S.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8110-8119Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These active site residues are present in three conserved motifs Exo I, II, and III that have been identified in nucleases from viruses to mammals (36Bernad A. Blanco L. Lazaro J.M. Martin G.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 5110-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The sequences of the TREX proteins indicate that an Exo I motif is positioned near the N terminus between amino acids 5 and 18 for TREX1 and between amino acids 11 and 24 for TREX2 (Fig. 1). An Exo II motif is present between amino acids 111 and 125 for TREX1 and between amino acids 114 and 128 for TREX2, and an Exo III motif is positioned nearest the C terminus between amino acids 182 and 196 for TREX1 and between 185 and 199 for TREX2. The positions of the Exo motifs in the TREX1 and TREX2 proteins are similar, and the amino acid sequences within these motifs are highly conserved. The TREX1 protein also contains an additional 68 amino acids at the C terminus that are not present in the TREX2 protein. The TREX proteins were aligned with selected exonucleases to identify specific amino acids that might participate directly in the exonuclease reaction. Specific carboxylate residues within the Exo motifs of DNA pol I coordinate two metal ions that are critical in the hydrolytic mechanism of DNA cleavage by this exonuclease (30Freemont P.S. Friedman J.M. Beese L.S. Sanderson M.R. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8924-8928Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 31Beese L.S. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Four conserved carboxylate residues in the Exo motifs of TREX1 and TREX2 were identified in this alignment (Fig. 2). The Asp and Glu in Exo I (Fig. 2, labeled 1 and2) and the Asp in Exo III (Fig. 2, labeled 4) align with the three carboxylate residues in DNA pol I that contribute to the binding of one metal ion required for activity. The Asp in Exo II (Fig. 2, labeled 3) aligns with the fourth carboxylate residue in DNA pol I that contributes to the binding of a second metal ion. The specific alignment of these carboxylate residues in the TREX proteins with the corresponding amino acids in the exonuclease domain of DNA pol I suggests that these residues contribute to metal binding in the TREX proteins. Activity assays demonstrate that a divalent metal is required for activity in the TREX1 and TREX2 exonucleases (4Perrino F.W. Miller H. Ealey K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16357-16363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The number of bound metal ions required for activity is not known. This sequence alignment suggests that the TREX proteins utilize a two-metal ion mechanism similar to that utilized by DNA pol I for phosphodiester bond cleavage. The TREX proteins contain a H X A XX Dsequence that is present in the Exo III motif of a limited number of exonucleases (Fig. 2). Alignment studies suggest that most exonucleases contain the Y XXX Dsequence in the Exo III motif (38Moser M.J. Holley W.R. Chatterjee A. Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 5110-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Structural and mutagenesis studies of DNA pol I suggest a role for this conserved Tyr at the active site (31Beese L.S. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, 32Derbyshire V. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). For T4 DNA pol mutations at this Tyr affect both the polymerase and the exonuclease activities (35Wang J. Yu P. Lin T.C. Konigsberg W.H. Steitz T.A.

An alternative Exo III motif, named Exo IIIε, has been proposed based on mutagenesis studies of the exonuclease domain of Bacillus subtilis DNA pol III (40Barnes M.H. Spacciapoli P. Li D.H. Brown N.C. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 165: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Genetic studies of the ε subunit of DNA pol III indicate that theH X A XX Dsequence in the Exo IIIε motif defines the active site residues in this region (41Strauss B.S. Sagher D. Acharya S.

The nucleases that contain the H X A XX Dsequence include the ε subunits of DNA pols III from Gram-negative bacteria, the exonuclease domains of DNA pols III from Gram-positive bacteria, and the RNases T (38Moser M.J.

The significance of the H X A XX Dsequence in the TREX proteins and in the proofreading exonucleases will require additional mutagenesis and structural information on these proteins. The protein products of the TREX cDNA sequences were produced in E. coli to demonstrate the 3′→5′ exonuclease activities of the recombinant proteins. Extracts were prepared from cells containing the TREX1h, TREX1m, and TREX2m cDNA sequences, and the amount of 3′→5′ exonuclease was measured using a 5′-32P-labeled 23-mer oligonucleotide (TableI). In this assay, the total 3′→5′ exonuclease activity present in E. coli and any activity contributed by the recombinant protein are measured. The exonuclease activity detected in extracts of pTREX1h and pTREX1m transfected cells was about 40- and 17-fold greater, respectively, than in extracts of cells transfected with the control pOXO4 plasmid. Extracts prepared from pTREX2m transfected cells showed an 11-fold greater 3′→5′ exonuclease activity than the control cell extracts. To further confirm that increased exonuclease activity resulted from expression of the TREX proteins, the recombinant TREX1 proteins were purified fromE. coli extracts. The recombinant TREX1 proteins exhibit chromatographic properties consistent with the exonucleases purified from human and bovine sources (4Perrino F.W. Miller H. Ealey K.A. J. Biol.

Analysis of the purified recombinant TREX1m shows a major protein band corresponding to about 32 kDa by SDS-PAGE 3The SDS-PAGE analysis of recombinant TREX1h protein indicates that an active fragment of the TREX1h protein is purified from E. coli extracts. Therefore, the TREX1m protein was selected for further characterization. (Fig.3). These results show that the TREX1 and TREX2 sequences encode active 3′→5′ exonucleases and that these recombinant exonucleases can be expressed in E. coli.Table IExpression of TREX proteins in E. coliPlasmid3′ → 5′ Exonucleaseunits/pg proteinpOXO40.11pTREX1h4.3pTREX1m1.9pTREX2m1.2The strain BL21(DE3) containing the indicated plasmid was grown and treated with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside.

Extracts were prepared, and exonuclease reactions containing 100 ng of protein and a 5′-32P-labeled 23-mer were performed. Products were separated on a polyacrylamide gel and quantified. The catalytic properties of the TREX1 enzymes are indistinguishable from the 3′→5′ exonuclease previously purified from human leukemia cells (4Perrino F.W. Miller H. Ealey K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16357-16363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize the recombinant proteins, the exonuclease activities of TREX1h and TREX1m were compared with the previously purified 3′→5′ exonuclease. In a previous study it was demonstrated that the leukemia cell 3′→5′ exonuclease removes araCMP and dNMPs from the 3′ terminus of a single-stranded oligomer and from the same oligomer hybridized to form duplex DNA (4Perrino F.W. Miller H. Ealey K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16357-16363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A direct comparison of purified TREX1h and TREX1m to the leukemia cell exonuclease demonstrates the same excision results (data not shown). In addition, ribonuclease activity was not detected in reactions containing an RNA 10-mer or the same RNA 10-mer hybridized to a DNA 40-mer using concentrations of enzymes 100-fold higher than used in the DNA excision experiments (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the TREX1 enzyme is the same exonuclease that was previously characterized in this la"

Both proteins contain an amino-terminal PDZ domain. Cypher1, but not Cypher2, contains three carboxyl-terminal LIM domains and an amino acid repeat sequence that exhibits homology to a repeat sequence found in the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II. cypher1 and cypher2mRNAs exhibited identical expression patterns. Both are exclusively expressed in cardiac and striated muscle in embryonic and adult stages. By biochemical assays, we have demonstrated that Cypher1 and Cypher2 bind to α-actinin-2 via their PDZ domains. This interaction has been further confirmed by immunohistochemical studies that demonstrated co-localization of Cypher and α-actinin at the Z-lines of cardiac muscle. We have also found that Cypher1 binds to protein kinase C through its LIM domains. Phosphorylation of Cypher by protein kinase C has demonstrated the functional significance of this interaction.

LIM domains have been identified in a variety of proteins and can be roughly classified into three groups. One group, designated as homeodomain-containing LIM proteins, which includes founder family members LIN-11, ISL1, and MEC-3, has both LIM domain(s) and a homeodomain. The second group, designated as LIM-only proteins, is composed of LIM domain(s) only. The third group contains both LIM domain(s) and one or more other recognizable domains exclusive of homeodomains (7Sánchez-Garcı́a I. Rabbitts T.H. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 315-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar).Some LIM domains are nuclear proteins involved in cell lineage determination and pattern formation during development (8Lumsden A. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 491-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Others encode proteins associated with the cytoskeleton and play a role in adhesion plaque and actin microfilament organization (9Beckerle M.C.

Genetic studies have demonstrated important roles of LIM domain proteins in cell lineage determination, cytoskeletal structure, and organogenesis. Disruption of several homeodomain/LIM genes has demonstrated their importance in neuronal lineage development (8Lumsden A. Curr.

The LIM-only protein LMO2 is required for erythropoiesis at early developmental stages, as evidenced by the lack of erythropoiesis in LMO2-deficient mice, resulting in embryonic mortality (11Warren A.J.

Characterization of these proteins will help us to better understand the function of LIM domains and may identify candidate genes involved in cardiomyopathies. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a novel striated muscle-restricted LIM domain-containing protein that we have named Cypher owing to its homology to another LIM domain protein, Enigma.DISCUSSIONWe have identified a novel PDZ and LIM domain-containing protein, Cypher. cypher mRNA has two splice variants that we have termed cypher1 and cypher2. cypher1and cypher2 have an identical expression pattern during development and in adult tissues, both being exclusively restricted to cardiac and other striated muscle. This expression profile suggests that Cypher plays an important role in the development and/or function of striated muscle.PDZ domains interact with at least four distinct protein sequences.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Each PDZ domain may be capable of specifically binding to more than one protein. For example, the PDZ domain of PICK1 binds both to itself and to the C terminus of PKCα. Mutations of specific amino acids in the PDZ domain can selectively abolish binding to PKCα, but do not affect homo-oligomerization (30Staudinger J. Lu J. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32019-32024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar).Utilizing both in vitro GST fusion binding assays and cell transfection studies, we have shown that the PDZ domain of Cypher1 and Cypher2 can interact with α-actinin-2. The results of double-staining immunohistochemistry performed on cryosections of adult mouse heart demonstrated that the Cypher and α-actinin-2 proteins are indeed co-localized within the cardiac myofibril at the Z-lines, suggesting the biological significance of this interaction.Studies performed to determine whether the Cypher PDZ domain could form homodimers or bind to the C-terminal LIM domains of Cypher1 gave negative results. However, it is likely that there are other as yet unidentified proteins that interact with the PDZ domain of Cypher.As with Enigma and ENH, Cypher1 contains both PDZ and LIM domains. Interestingly, the LIM domains of ENH can selectively bind to PKCβ1, -γ, and -ε, but not to PKCα, -δ, or -ζ (15Kuroda S. Tokunaga C. Kiyohara Y. Higuchi O. Konishi H. Mizuno K. Gill G.N. Kikkawa U.

However, we have demonstrated that the LIM domains of Cypher1 bind to all six PKC isoforms without apparent selectivity. The reason for this discrepancy and its significance remain to be elucidated.Our observations suggest that Cypher1 functions as an adaptor to couple PKC-mediated signaling, via its LIM domains, to the cytoskeleton (α-actinin-2) through its PDZ domain. Cypher2 contains the PDZ domain, but no LIM domains. The intriguing possibility that Cypher2 may inhibit Cypher1 in a dominant-negative fashion remains to be explored.It has been shown that the LIM2 and LIM3 domains of the Cypher family member Enigma interact with the Tyr-containing tight-turn motifs of the Ret tyrosine kinase (glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor receptor) and the insulin receptor, respectively (17Wu R.Y.

For example, the PDZ domain of PICK1 binds both to itself and to the C terminus of PKCα. Mutations of specific amino acids in the PDZ domain can selectively abolish binding to PKCα, but do not affect homo-oligomerization (30Staudinger J. Lu J. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32019-32024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar).Utilizing both in vitro GST fusion binding assays and cell transfection studies, we have shown that the PDZ domain of Cypher1 and Cypher2 can interact with α-actinin-2. The results of double-staining immunohistochemistry performed on cryosections of adult mouse heart demonstrated that the Cypher and α-actinin-2 proteins are indeed co-localized within the cardiac myofibril at the Z-lines, suggesting the biological significance of this interaction.Studies performed to determine whether the Cypher PDZ domain could form homodimers or bind to the C-terminal LIM domains of Cypher1 gave negative results. However, it is likely that there are other as yet unidentified proteins that interact with the PDZ domain of Cypher.As with Enigma and ENH, Cypher1 contains both PDZ and LIM domains. Interestingly, the LIM domains of ENH can selectively bind to PKCβ1, -γ, and -ε, but not to PKCα, -δ, or -ζ (15Kuroda S. Tokunaga C. Kiyohara Y. Higuchi O. Konishi H. Mizuno K. Gill G.N. Kikkawa U.

However, we have demonstrated that the LIM domains of Cypher1 bind to all six PKC isoforms without apparent selectivity.

Cypher2 contains the PDZ domain, but no LIM domains. The intriguing possibility that Cypher2 may inhibit Cypher1 in a dominant-negative fashion remains to be explored.It has been shown that the LIM2 and LIM3 domains of the Cypher family member Enigma interact with the Tyr-containing tight-turn motifs of the Ret tyrosine kinase (glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor receptor) and the insulin receptor, respectively (17Wu R.Y.

Addendum—In the process of writing this report, we found the coding sequence of an unknown human gene (GenBankTM accession number AB014513) that shares high homology with Cypher1. Alignment of the two amino acid sequences revealed that they share 92% identity excluding a stretch of 64 amino acid sequences (amino acids 131–195 of Cypher1) that has no apparent homology between the two sequences. The 64-amino acid difference in sequence may result from differential mRNA splicing."

Nine members of this group of dual specificity phosphatases have previously been cloned. They show distinct substrate specificities for MAPKs, different tissue distribution and subcellular localization, and different modes of inducibility of their expression by extracellular stimuli. Here we have cloned and characterized a novel dual specificity phosphatase, which we have designated MKP-5. MKP-5 is a protein of 482 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 52.6 kDa and consists of 150 N-terminal amino acids of unknown function, two Cdc25 homology 2 regions in the middle, and a C-terminal catalytic domain. MKP-5 binds to p38 and SAPK/JNK, but not to MAPK/ERK, and inactivates p38 and SAPK/JNK, but not MAPK/ERK. p38 is a preferred substrate. The subcellular localization of MKP-5 is unique; it is present evenly in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. MKP-5 mRNA is widely expressed in various tissues and organs, and its expression in cultured cells is elevated by stress stimuli. These results suggest that MKP-5 is a novel type of dual specificity phosphatase specific for p38 and SAPK/JNK.

They consist of three major subfamilies, MAPK/ERK, SAPK/JNK, and p38. MAPK/ERK is activated mainly by growth factors and phorbol esters and is associated with cellular proliferation and differentiation. SAPK/JNK and p38 are activated by extracellular stresses, such as UV irradiation and osmotic stress, and by inflammatory cytokines, but are poorly activated by growth factors and phorbol esters. Activation of these protein kinases leads to variable responses, such as gene expression, cell proliferation, differentiation, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, early development, etc., depending on the cell type (1Ahn N.G.

They share sequence homology, but each has distinct properties concerning substrate specificity, tissue distribution, subcellular localization, and inducibility by extracellular stimuli.Here we report the cDNA cloning and characterization of a novel member of the dual specificity phosphatase family. We named it MKP-5. We isolated MKP-5 from a human liver cDNA library by yeast two-hybrid screening using p38 as a bait. MKP-5 shares structural features with other members of the dual specificity phosphatase family, including a Cdc25-like domain and a C-terminal phosphatase motif. MKP-5 has a high basal activity in vitro and inactivates both p38 and SAPK/JNK, but not MAPK/ERK. MKP-5 specifically binds to p38 and SAPK/JNK in the yeast two-hybrid system. Intracellular localization of MKP-5 differs from that of other dual specificity phosphatases. The expression of MKP-5 mRNA is elevated by stress stimuli. These results show that MKP-5 is a novel dual specificity phosphatase specific for p38 and SAPK/JNK.DISCUSSIONWe have isolated a cDNA clone encoding a novel dual specificity phosphatase, MKP-5, by yeast two-hybrid screening using p38 as bait. All of the amino acids previously shown to be important for the catalytic activity of dual specificity phosphatases are conserved in MKP-5. MKP-5 also has two CH2 domains (the Cdc25-like domain) in its middle portion that are also conserved in dual specificity phosphatases (39Keyse S.M. Ginsburg M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 377-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 40Kwak S.P. Hakes D.J. Martell K.J. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3596-3604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The previously described dual specificity phosphatases, except hVH5 (M3/6), consist of only two regions, the Cdc25-like domain and the phosphatase catalytic domain (Fig. 1 D). hVH5 (M3/6) has a long C-terminal stretch whose function is unknown (26Martell K.J. Seasholtz A.F. Kwak S.P. Clemens K.K. Dixon J.E. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1823-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 27Theodosiou A.M. Rodrigues N.R. Nesbit M.A. Ambrose H.J. Paterson H.

MKP-5 is unique in that it has an additional long N-terminal region, consisting of ∼150 amino acids, that is absent from other dual specificity phosphatases (Fig. 1 D). This region has no homology with other proteins, and so the role of this N-terminal region is unknown at present. The amino acid sequence identity of the Cdc25-like domain between MKP-5 and other dual specificity phosphatases is 20–34%. hVH5 shows 34% identity. The catalytic domain of MKP-5 shows 37–50% identity to that of other dual specificity phosphatases. From the standpoint of the amino acid sequence, MKP-3, Pyst2, and MKP-4 form one group, and CL100, PAC1, and MKP-2 form another. The identities among MKP-3, Pyst2, and MKP-4 are 42–59% in the Cdc25-like domain and 74–86% in the catalytic domain, and the identities among CL100, PAC1, and MKP-2 are 34–54% in Cdc25-like domain and 73–81% in the catalytic domain. hVH5 (M3/6) and hVH3/B23 share much lower similarities with either of the two groups and with each other. Because MKP-5 does not share high similarity with either of the two groups, hVH5 (M3/6) or hVH3/B23, MKP-5 may be a distinct member of the dual specificity phosphatase family.Bacterially expressed GST-MKP-5 possessed a high phosphatase activity for pNPP, which seems relatively strong. For example, under almost the same reaction conditions, incubation with 40 μg of GST-MKP-4/Pyst3 for 60 min (32Muda M. Boschert U. Smith A. Antonsson B. Gillierson C. Chabert C. Camps M. Martinou I. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5141-5151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) is equivalent to incubation with 3 μg of GST-MKP-5 for 15 min.It has previously been reported that the Cdc25-like domains of MKP-3/Pyst1/rVH6 and hVH5 (M3/6) determine their binding specificity and substrate specificity for MAPKs (39Keyse S.M. Ginsburg M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 377-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Using the semiquantitative yeast two-hybrid interaction assay, we tested whether MKP-5 could bind to MAPKs and whether the Cdc25-like domain was responsible for the binding. Full-length MKP-5 could bind to p38 and SAPK/JNK, but only very weakly to MAPK/ERK. The affinity for p38 appeared stronger than that for SAPK/JNK. The Cdc25-like domain of MKP-5 interacted specifically with p38, although the affinity seemed very low. Thereby, the proper binding of MKP-5 to p38 may require not only the Cdc25-like domain, but also other regions. That the binding between MKP-5 and SAPK/JNK is slightly weaker than that between MKP-5 and p38 may be accounted for by the fact that the Cdc25-like domain of MKP-5 has no affinity for SAPK/JNK.The binding of MAPK/ERK to MKP-3/Pyst1/rVH6, Pyst2, and MKP-4/Pyst3 has been reported to enhance the activities of these phosphatases up to ∼20-fold (31Dowd S. Sneddon A.A. Keyse S.M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 111: 3389-3399Google Scholar, 42Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron G. Antonsson B. Muda M. Chabert C. Boschert U. Arkinstall S.

There may be two kinds of dual specificity phosphatases. Members of one subfamily, which comprises MKP-3/Pyst1/rVH6, Pyst2, and MKP-4/Pyst3, may be activated by binding to their physiological substrates, and members of the other subfamily may exist as constitutively active forms. In fact, MKP-5 seems to have a higher basal activity than MKP-3/Pyst1/rVH6, Pyst2, and MKP-4/Pyst3 (see above). It is possible that the N-terminal portion of MKP-5 may serve as regulatory sites, i.e. binding sites for inhibitors and/or regulators.Each dual specificity phosphatase has its own substrate specificity. CL100/MKP-1 inhibits MAPK/ERK, p38, and SAPK/JNK; PAC1 and Pyst2 inhibit MAPK/ERK and p38; MKP-2/hVH2/TYP-1 inhibits MAPK and SAPK/JNK; hVH3/B23, MKP-3/Pyst1/rVH6, and MKP-4/Pyst3 inhibit MAPK/ERK; and hVH5 (M3/6) inhibits p38 and SAPK/JNK (24Kwak S.P Dixon J.E.

MKP-5 is shown here to localize evenly in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. This subcellular localization of MKP-5 is different from that of previously described dual specificity phosphatases. The subcellular localization of MKP-5 is unchanged after stress stimulation (data not shown). p38 and SAPK/JNK, targets of MKP-5, also localize in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and their localization does not dramatically change after stress stimulation. In contrast, MAPK/ERK, which is present in the cytoplasm before stimulation, is translocated to the nucleus upon stimulation. The correspondence of the subcellular localization between MKP-5 and its targets, p38 and SAPK/JNK, might have some physiological relevance or may reflect binding between them.The expression of some dual specificity phosphatases is known to be induced after growth factor stimulation and/or stress stimulation (18Sun H.

The MKP-5 mRNA was elevated significantly by anisomycin treatment, osmotic stress, and tumor necrosis factor-α treatment, which are known to activate p38 strongly. TPA, which is a good agonist for MAPK/ERK, did not induce MKP-5 mRNA; so there may be a correlation between MKP-5 mRNA inducibility and p38 activation in extracellular stimuli. However, UV irradiation, which is able to activate p38, did not increase the mRNA level. The mechanism of elevated expression of MKP-5 mRNA by stress stimuli should be elucidated in future studies.In summary, we have cloned and characterized a novel dual specificity phosphatase, designated MKP-5. MKP-5 does not seem to belong to known subfamilies of dual specificity phosphatases in terms of structural features. MKP-5 is specific for p38 and SAPK/JNK, and its subcellular localization is unique in that it is present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Thus, MKP-5 may be a novel member of the dual specificity phosphatase family acting on the MAPK family molecules. Members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)1 superfamily are proline-directed serine/threonine protein kinases that play a pivotal role in transducing various extracellular signals to the nucleus. They consist of three major subfamilies, MAPK/ERK, SAPK/JNK, and p38. MAPK/ERK is activated mainly by growth factors and phorbol esters and is associated with cellular proliferation and differentiation. SAPK/JNK and p38 are activated by extracellular stresses, such as UV irradiation and osmotic stress, and by inflammatory cytokines, but are poorly activated by growth factors and phorbol esters. Activation of these protein kinases leads to variable responses, such as gene expression, cell proliferation, differentiation, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, early development, etc., depending on the cell type (1Ahn N.G.

The magnitude and duration of activation of the MAPK superfamily are properly regulated and have a great effect on determination of the fates and responses of cells. In the case of PC12 cells, nerve growth factor treatment causes sustained activation of MAPK/ERK and p38 and drives the cells into neuronal differentiation, whereas epidermal growth factor treatment causes transient activation of MAPK/ERK and p38 and induces proliferation of the cells (7Marshall C.J.

MAPK/ERK, SAPK/JNK, and p38 are regulated by dual phosphorylation and dephosphorylation within the motifs TEY, TPY, and TGY, respectively, by several upstream dual specificity kinases (MAPK kinases) and several types of protein phosphatases. There is an emerging family of dual specificity phosphatases acting on the MAPK superfamily. Nine members of this group of dual specificity phosphatases have been reported, including VHR (14Ishibashi T. Bottaro D.P. Chan A. Miki T. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

They share sequence homology, but each has distinct properties concerning substrate specificity, tissue distribution, subcellular localization, and inducibility by extracellular stimuli. Here we report the cDNA cloning and characterization of a novel member of the dual specificity phosphatase family. We named it MKP-5. We isolated MKP-5 from a human liver cDNA library by yeast two-hybrid screening using p38 as a bait. MKP-5 shares structural features with other members of the dual specificity phosphatase family, including a Cdc25-like domain and a C-terminal phosphatase motif. MKP-5 has a high basal activity in vitro and inactivates both p38 and SAPK/JNK, but not MAPK/ERK. MKP-5 specifically binds to p38 and SAPK/JNK in the yeast two-hybrid system. Intracellular localization of MKP-5 differs from that of other dual specificity phosphatases. The expression of MKP-5 mRNA is elevated by stress stimuli. These results show that MKP-5 is a novel dual specificity phosphatase specific for p38 and SAPK/JNK. DISCUSSIONWe have isolated a cDNA clone encoding a novel dual specificity phosphatase, MKP-5, by yeast two-hybrid screening using p38 as bait. All of the amino acids previously shown to be important for the catalytic activity of dual specificity phosphatases are conserved in MKP-5. MKP-5 also has two CH2 domains (the Cdc25-like domain) in its middle portion that are also conserved in dual specificity phosphatases (39Keyse S.M. Ginsburg M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 377-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 40Kwak S.P. Hakes D.J. Martell K.J. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3596-3604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The previously described dual specificity phosphatases, except hVH5 (M3/6), consist of only two regions, the Cdc25-like domain and the phosphatase catalytic domain (Fig. 1 D). hVH5 (M3/6) has a long C-terminal stretch whose function is unknown (26Martell K.J. Seasholtz A.F. Kwak S.P. Clemens K.K. Dixon J.E. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1823-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 27Theodosiou A.M. Rodrigues N.R. Nesbit M.A. Ambrose H.J. Paterson H. McLellan-Arnold E. Boyd Y. Leversha M.A. Owen N. Blake D.J. Ashworth A. Davies K.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 96: 675-684Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). MKP-5 is unique in that it has an additional long N-terminal region, consisting of ∼150 amino acids, that is absent from other dual specificity phosphatases (Fig. 1 D). This region has no homology with other proteins, and so the role of this N-terminal region is unknown at present. The amino acid sequence identity of the Cdc25-like domain between MKP-5 and other dual specificity phosphatases is 20–34%. hVH5 shows 34% identity. The catalytic domain of MKP-5 shows 37–50% identity to that of other dual specificity phosphatases. From the standpoint of the amino acid sequence, MKP-3, Pyst2, and MKP-4 form one group, and CL100, PAC1, and MKP-2 form another. The identities among MKP-3, Pyst2, and MKP-4 are 42–59% in the Cdc25-like domain and 74–86% in the catalytic domain, and the identities among CL100, PAC1, and MKP-2 are 34–54% in Cdc25-like domain and 73–81% in the catalytic domain. hVH5 (M3/6) and hVH3/B23 share much lower similarities with either of the two groups and with each other. Because MKP-5 does not share high similarity with either of the two groups, hVH5 (M3/6) or hVH3/B23, MKP-5 may be a distinct member of the dual specificity phosphatase family.Bacterially expressed GST-MKP-5 possessed a high phosphatase activity for pNPP, which seems relatively strong. For example, under almost the same reaction conditions, incubation with 40 μg of GST-MKP-4/Pyst3 for 60 min (32Muda M. Boschert U. Smith A. Antonsson B. Gillierson C. Chabert C. Camps M. Martinou I. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5141-5151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) is equivalent to incubation with 3 μg of GST-MKP-5 for 15 min.It has previously been reported that the Cdc25-like domains of MKP-3/Pyst1/rVH6 and hVH5 (M3/6) determine their binding specificity and substrate specificity for MAPKs (39Keyse S.M. Ginsburg M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 377-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Using the semiquantitative yeast two-hybrid interaction assay, we tested whether MKP-5 could bind to MAPKs and whether the Cdc25-like domain was responsible for the binding. Full-length MKP-5 could bind to p38 and SAPK/JNK, but only very weakly to MAPK/ERK. The affinity for p38 appeared stronger than that for SAPK/JNK. The Cdc25-like domain of MKP-5 interacted specifically with p38, although the affinity seemed very low. Thereby, the proper binding of MKP-5 to p38 may require not only the Cdc25-like domain, but also other regions. That the binding between MKP-5 and SAPK/JNK is slightly weaker than that between MKP-5 and p38 may be accounted for by the fact that the Cdc25-like domain of MKP-5 has no affinity for SAPK/JNK.The binding of MAPK/ERK to MKP-3/Pyst1/rVH6, Pyst2, and MKP-4/Pyst3 has been reported to enhance the activities of these phosphatases up to ∼20-fold (31Dowd S. Sneddon A.A. Keyse S.M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 111: 3389-3399Google Scholar, 42Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron G. Antonsson B. Muda M. Chabert C. Boschert U. Arkinstall S. Science. 1998; 280: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). In contrast, incubation with p38 or SAPK/JNK enhanced the catalytic activity of MKP-5 only 1.6-fold. There may be two kinds of dual specificity phosphatases. Members of one subfamily, which comprises MKP-3/Pyst1/rVH6, Pyst2, and MKP-4/Pyst3, may be activated by binding to their physiological substrates, and members of the other subfamily may exist as constitutively active forms. In fact, MKP-5 seems to have a higher basal activity than MKP-3/Pyst1/rVH6, Pyst2, and MKP-4/Pyst3 (see above). It is possible that the N-terminal portion of MKP-5 may serve as regulatory sites, i.e. binding sites for inhibitors and/or regulators.Each dual specificity phosphatase has its own substrate specificity. CL100/MKP-1 inhibits MAPK/ERK, p38, and SAPK/JNK; PAC1 and Pyst2 inhibit MAPK/ERK and p38; MKP-2/hVH2/TYP-1 inhibits MAPK and SAPK/JNK; hVH3/B23, MKP-3/Pyst1/rVH6, and MKP-4/Pyst3 inhibit MAPK/ERK; and hVH5 (M3/6) inhibits p38 and SAPK/JNK (24Kwak S.P Dixon J.E.

When coexpressed, MKP-5 inactivated p38 and SAPK/JNK, but did not inactivate MAPK/ERK. The inactivation of p38 was greater than that of SAPK/JNK.

The MKP-5 mRNA was elevated significantly by anisomycin treatment, osmotic stress, and tumor necrosis factor-α treatment, which are known to activate p38 strongly. TPA, which is a good agonist for MAPK/ERK, did not induce MKP-5 mRNA; so there may be a correlation between MKP-5 mRNA inducibility and p38 activation in extracellular stimuli. However, UV irradiation, which is able to activate p38, did not increase the mRNA level. The mechanism of elevated expression of MKP-5 mRNA by stress stimuli should be elucidated in future studies.In summary, we have cloned and characterized a novel dual specificity phosphatase, designated MKP-5. MKP-5 does not seem to belong to known subfamilies of dual specificity phosphatases in terms of structural features. MKP-5 is specific for p38 and SAPK/JNK, and its subcellular localization is unique in that it is present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Thus, MKP-5 may be a novel member of the dual specificity phosphatase family acting on the MAPK family molecules. We have isolated a cDNA clone encoding a novel dual specificity phosphatase, MKP-5, by yeast two-hybrid screening using p38 as bait. All of the amino acids previously shown to be important for the catalytic activity of dual specificity phosphatases are conserved in MKP-5. MKP-5 also has two CH2 domains (the Cdc25-like domain) in its middle portion that are also conserved in dual specificity phosphatases (39Keyse S.M. Ginsburg M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 377-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 40Kwak S.P. Hakes D.J. Martell K.J. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3596-3604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The previously described dual specificity phosphatases, except hVH5 (M3/6), consist of only two regions, the Cdc25-like domain and the phosphatase catalytic domain (Fig. 1 D). hVH5 (M3/6) has a long C-terminal stretch whose function is unknown (26Martell K.J. Seasholtz A.F. Kwak S.P. Clemens K.K. Dixon J.E. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1823-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 27Theodosiou A.M. Rodrigues N.R. Nesbit M.A. Ambrose H.J. Paterson H.

MKP-5 is unique in that it has an additional long N-terminal region, consisting of ∼150 amino acids, that is absent from other dual specificity phosphatases (Fig. 1 D). This region has no homology with other proteins, and so the role of this N-terminal region is unknown at present. The amino acid sequence identity of the Cdc25-like domain between MKP-5 and other dual specificity phosphatases is 20–34%. hVH5 shows 34% identity. The catalytic domain of MKP-5 shows 37–50% identity to that of other dual specificity phosphatases. From the standpoint of the amino acid sequence, MKP-3, Pyst2, and MKP-4 form one group, and CL100, PAC1, and MKP-2 form another. The identities among MKP-3, Pyst2, and MKP-4 are 42–59% in the Cdc25-like domain and 74–86% in the catalytic domain, and the identities among CL100, PAC1, and MKP-2 are 34–54% in Cdc25-like domain and 73–81% in the catalytic domain. hVH5 (M3/6) and hVH3/B23 share much lower similarities with either of the two groups and with each other. Because MKP-5 does not share high similarity with either of the two groups, hVH5 (M3/6) or hVH3/B23, MKP-5 may be a distinct member of the dual specificity phosphatase family. Bacterially expressed GST-MKP-5 possessed a high phosphatase activity for pNPP, which seems relatively strong. For example, under almost the same reaction conditions, incubation with 40 μg of GST-MKP-4/Pyst3 for 60 min (32Muda M. Boschert U. Smith A. Antonsson B. Gillierson C. Chabert C. Camps M. Martinou I. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5141-5151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) is equivalent to incubation with 3 μg of GST-MKP-5 for 15 min. It has previously been reported that the Cdc25-like domains of MKP-3/Pyst1/rVH6 and hVH5 (M3/6) determine their binding specificity and substrate specificity for MAPKs (39Keyse S.M. Ginsburg M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 377-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Using the semiquantitative yeast two-hybrid interaction assay, we tested whether MKP-5 could bind to MAPKs and whether the Cdc25-like domain was responsible for the binding. Full-length MKP-5 could bind to p38 and SAPK/JNK, but only very weakly to MAPK/ERK. The affinity for p38 appeared stronger than that for SAPK/JNK. The Cdc25-like domain of MKP-5 interacted specifically with p38, although the affinity seemed very low. Thereby, the proper binding of MKP-5 to p38 may require not only the Cdc25-like domain, but also other regions. That the binding between MKP-5 and SAPK/JNK is slightly weaker than that between MKP-5 and p38 may be accounted for by the fact that the Cdc25-like domain of MKP-5 has no affinity for SAPK/JNK. The binding of MAPK/ERK to MKP-3/Pyst1/rVH6, Pyst2, and MKP-4/Pyst3 has been reported to enhance the activities of these phosphatases up to ∼20-fold (31Dowd S. Sneddon A.A. Keyse S.M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 111: 3389-3399Google Scholar, 42Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron G. Antonsson B. Muda M. Chabert C. Boschert U. Arkinstall S. Science. 1998; 280: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). In contrast, incubation with p38 or SAPK/JNK enhanced the catalytic activity of MKP-5 only 1.6-fold. There may be two kinds of dual specificity phosphatases. Members of one subfamily, which comprises MKP-3/Pyst1/rVH6, Pyst2, and MKP-4/Pyst3, may be activated by binding to their physiological substrates, and members of the other subfamily may exist as constitutively active forms. In fact, MKP-5 seems to have a higher basal activity than MKP-3/Pyst1/rVH6, Pyst2, and MKP-4/Pyst3 (see above). It is possible that the N-terminal portion of MKP-5 may serve as regulatory sites, i.e. binding sites for inhibitors and/or regulators. Each dual specificity phosphatase has its own substrate specificity. CL100/MKP-1 inhibits MAPK/ERK, p38, and SAPK/JNK; PAC1 and Pyst2 inhibit MAPK/ERK and p38; MKP-2/hVH2/TYP-1 inhibits MAPK and SAPK/JNK; hVH3/B23, MKP-3/Pyst1/rVH6, and MKP-4/Pyst3 inhibit MAPK/ERK; and hVH5 (M3/6) inhibits p38 and SAPK/JNK (24Kwak S.P Dixon J.E.

When coexpressed, MKP-5 inactivated p38 and SAPK/JNK, but did not inactivate MAPK/ERK. The inactivation of p38 was greater than that of SAPK/JNK. This specificity seems to be consistent with the binding ability of MKP-5 regarding various MAPKs. Among the known dual specificity phosphatases, only M3/6 (hVH5) shows the same or similar substrate specificity (44Muda M. Theodosiou A. Rodrigues N. Boschert U. Camps M. Gillieron C. Davies K.

MKP-5 is shown here to localize evenly in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. This subcellular localization of MKP-5 is different from that of previously described dual specificity phosphatases. The subcellular localization of MKP-5 is unchanged after stress stimulation (data not shown). p38 and SAPK/JNK, targets of MKP-5, also localize in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and their localization does not dramatically change after stress stimulation.

https://openalex.org/W2135326004,"Signaling through D2 class dopamine receptors is crucial to correct brain development and function, and dysfunction of this system is implicated in major neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. To investigate potential novel mechanisms of D2 receptor regulation, the third cytoplasmic loop of the D2 dopamine receptor was used to screen a rat hippocampal yeast two-hybrid library. Spinophilin, a recently characterized F-actin and protein phosphatase-1-binding protein with a single PDZ domain was identified as a protein that specifically associates with this region of D2 receptors. A direct interaction between spinophilin and the D2 receptor was confirmed in vitro using recombinant fusion proteins. The portion of spinophilin responsible for interacting with the D2 third cytoplasmic loop was narrowed to a region that does not include the actin-binding domain, the PDZ domain, or the coiled-coil. This region is distinct from the site of interaction with protein phosphatase-1, and both D2 receptors and protein phosphatase-1 may bind spinophilin at the same time. The interaction is not mediated via the unique 29-amino acid insert in D2long; both D2long and D2short third cytoplasmic loops interact with spinophilin in vitro and in yeast two-hybrid assays. Expression of D2 receptors containing an extracellular hemagglutinin epitope in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells results in co-localization of receptor and endogenous spinophilin as determined by immunocytochemistry using antibodies directed against spinophilin and the HA tag. We hypothesize that spinophilin is important for establishing a signaling complex for dopaminergic neurotransmission through D2 receptors by linking receptors to downstream signaling molecules and the actin cytoskeleton.

G protein-coupled receptor protein phosphatase-1 D2long D2short polymerase chain reaction glutathione S-transferase hemagglutinin Madin-Darby canine kidney phosphate-buffered saline Dopamine receptors are members of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)1 superfamily that mediate their actions by coupling to intracellular signal transduction cascades via heterotrimeric G proteins. Five different dopamine receptors have been described belonging to two classes that are defined based on structure, function, and pharmacology (1Missale C. Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). D2-like receptors, D2, D3, and D4, couple to G proteins of the Gi/o class and have diverse downstream effectors, including adenylyl cyclase and G protein-coupled inward rectifier K+ channels (GIRKs). In contrast, D1-like receptors D1 and D5 are coupled to increases in adenylyl cyclase activity through Gs. D1-like receptors have short third cytoplasmic loops (i3) and very long carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tails. Conversely, D2-like receptors are characterized by long third cytoplasmic loops and short carboxyl-terminal tails. D2-like receptors are more polymorphic than D1-like receptors; for example, D2 exists as two isoforms, D2long and D2short, which differ by 29 amino acids within the third cytoplasmic loop (2Monsma Jr., F.J. McVittie L.D. Gerfen C.R. Mahan L.C. Sibley D.R. Nature. 1989; 342: 926-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). In many GPCRs the third cytoplasmic loop is important for the coupling to G proteins. Typically, short peptide sequences near the amino and carboxyl termini of the third loop participate in the coordination of receptor-G protein interactions (3Malek D. Munch G. Palm D. FEBS Lett. 1993; 325: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 4Merkouris M. Dragatsis I. Megaritis G. Konidakis G. Zioudrou C. Milligan G. Georgoussi Z. Mol.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4381-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thus, the rest of the third cytoplasmic loop might then be free to interact with cytosolic or membrane-associated proteins that regulate receptor-mediated signaling cascades (6Wu G. Benovic J.L. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7197-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The complexity of signaling pathways and the specificity of effector action generated by G protein-coupled receptors suggest a higher order organization than is currently known to exist (7Neubig R.R. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 8Limbird L.E. Taylor P. Cell. 1998; 93: 157-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Regulation of GPCR desensitization and resensitization through phosphorylation-dependent events mediated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases and the arrestins have been worked out for many classes of GPCRs (9Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). These proteins are responsible for terminating receptor-mediated signaling following ligand binding and receptor activation. Although much progress has been made to define these pathways, little is known about the basic organization of G protein-coupled receptors, their effector molecules, and regulators of receptor function into complexes that affect GPCR-mediated signaling. In this study we show that the third cytoplasmic loop of D2 dopamine receptors binds to spinophilin, a protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1)-binding protein that contains an amino-terminal actin-binding domain and a single PDZ domain (10Allen P.B. Ouimet C.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9956-9961Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) through a novel, non-PDZ-dependent mechanism.

These fragments were ligated in frame to the corresponding sites in pPC97 (12Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), creating plasmids encoding either GAL4BD-D2Li3 or GAL4BD-D2Si3 fusion proteins. Two hybrid techniques were performed as described (Ref. 13Alam M.R. Caldwell B.D. Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol.

For screening cDNA libraries, the bait vector pPC97.D2Li3 was transformed into yeast strain CG-1945 (CLONTECH) using a modified lithium acetate protocol (14Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Methods Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 255-269Google Scholar). After confirming expression of the bait protein, a rat hippocampal cDNA library in the vector pPC86 (15Brakeman P.R. Lanahan A.A. O'Brien R. Roche K. Barnes C.A. Huganir R.L. Worley P.F.

His+colonies were then tested for β-galactosidase activity using the filter lift assay. Clones that were consistently phenotypically His+ and lacZ + were further characterized. Approximately 1 × 106 transformants were screened; several different clones met these criteria. A single clone was chosen for further pursuit based on its strongly His+/lacZ + phenotype. Library plasmids were isolated using the Yeast DNA Isolation system (Stratagene) and amplified in Escherichia coli. Sequencing was performed by the Automated Sequencing Facility (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill). The cDNA fragment encoding spinophilin (amino acids 100–767) was excised from pPC86.clone7 as aSalI-NotI fragment and subcloned into pGEX5X2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). This plasmid, pGEX5X2.spinophilin (100–767), was transformed into E. coli strain BL21DE3(pLysS) (Novagen), allowing expression of spinophilin as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. Deletion constructs were made using a combination of restriction endonuclease digestion and PCR cloning. Several GST fusion proteins showed a consistent pattern of lower molecular weight bands in the purified sample. We believe these are either unstable degradation products or incompletely translated products. A GST fusion protein encoding amino acids 101–372 of neurabin (16Nakanishi H. Obaishi H. Satoh A.

The cDNA fragment was subcloned into pGEX5X2 as described above. Bacterial fusion protein production was induced by addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and overnight growth at 30 °C. Fusion protein was either purified in large batches using glutathione-agarose (Sigma), or induced bacteria were frozen in small aliquots and fusion protein was purified at the time of the experiment. To generate a tagged D2L third cytoplasmic loop fusion, theSalI-NotI fragment encoding D2Li3 was excised from the bait plasmid and inserted into pET32c (Novagen), creating pET32c.D2Li3. This plasmid, encoding a fusion protein consisting of thioredoxin, an S tag, a His6 tag and the third cytoplasmic loop of D2L, was transformed into BL21DE3(pLysS) cells, and protein production was induced as above. The fusion protein was purified from the insoluble fraction using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Novagen) after solubilization of inclusion bodies in 6 m urea. Fusion protein was refolded by step-wise removal of denaturant by dialysis. For binding assays, GST-spinophilin (100–767) or negative control proteins were immobilized on GSH-agarose at 4 °C in binding buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.1% nonfat dry milk). His-tagged D2Li3 were incubated with the immobilized GST fusion proteins or GST alone in 200 μl of binding buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. Proteins bound to the immobilized resin were collected by centrifugation, washed extensively in binding buffer + 150 mm NaCl, eluted in 1× Laemmli sample buffer, and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Unbound proteins were precipitated with acetone and analyzed separately. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore) membranes, and bound (or unbound) tagged D2Li3 was detected by incubation with S protein-horseradish peroxidase (Novagen; 1:10,000) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed 3 times in TTBS (100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and developed using ECL (NEN Life Science Products). Binding assays were done essentially as described above, except that 35S-labeled proteins were produced using pET28c.D2Li3 as template in coupled in vitrotranscription/translation reactions (TNT system, Promega). This plasmid was created by subcloning the SalI-NotID2Li3 fragment into pET28c (Novagen), which lacks the thioredoxin and S protein tags and instead has a short sequence encoding a T7 and a His6 tag. 35S-Labeled PP-1γ1 was synthesized using pGEM-7z-rPP1γ1 (Provided by Dr. Ernest Y. C. Lee, New York Medical College) as template. 5 μl of TNT reaction product were added directly to the GST fusion protein-coupled beads in 500 μl of binding buffer. Beads were tumbled for 2 h at 4 °C and pelleted at 8000 rpm for 20 s, and supernatant was removed. Beads were washed three times with 1 ml of binding buffer plus 50 mm NaCl or 500 mm NaCl. Protein was eluted from beads in 1× Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins in the unbound fractions were precipitated and analyzed separately (data not shown). Total bound fractions were separated on 13.5% polyacrylamide gels. Dried gels were subjected to PhosphorImager analysis by exposure overnight followed by scanning on a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). All binding assays were performed multiple times to confirm reliability of the in vitro interactions. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated against two different peptides based on the primary sequence of rat spinophilin. Peptide 1 contains amino acids 114–131 (GTSVSERVSRFNSKPAPS); peptide 2 contains amino acids 367–390 (DNGRAPDMAPEEVDESKKEDFSEA). Peptides were synthesized and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin at the University of North Carolina Peptide Synthesis Core Facility. Antibodies were produced commercially (Covance). Antisera were tested for their ability to recognize the expected 140-kDa protein from lysates of MDCK cells, as well as the appropriate GST fusion protein, by Western blot. We chose to use the antibody NC152, directed against peptide 1, because it gave unambiguous results by Western blot analysis and had less background than the antibody against peptide 2 (NC153). Crude serum was purified using DEAE-Affy-Gel Blue (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions, except that serum was diluted 1:5 in application buffer before applying to column. The tagging of D2S was based on the scheme developed by Keefer et al.(17Keefer J.R. Kennedy M.E. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16425-16432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Wozniak and Limbird (18Wozniak M. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5017-5024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, PCR was used to generate a 514-base pair fragment containing a 5′ HindIII site, a Kozak sequence, and nucleotides encoding the HA tag/linker region (YPYDVPDYALV) inserted between Asp2 and Pro3 in the D2S protein sequence. The corresponding portion of the wild type receptor cDNA in pRc/RSV-hD2S (provided by Tony Sandrasagra, Hoechst-Marion Roussel) was excised and replaced with the HA tag encoding fragment. Recombinant receptor cDNAs were detected by PCR using a 5′ primer specific for the HA tag. Sequencing confirmed the presence of the HA tag in the correct reading frame. MDCK type II cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 + 5% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected with pRc/RSV.HA-hD2S using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable transfectants were selected by culturing in media containing 400 μg/ml G418. Colonies were subcloned and checked for expression of HA-D2S by immunofluorescence microscopy using monoclonal antibody HA.11 (BabCo). Nonclonal cell lines expressing high levels of HA-D2S receptor in ∼75% of cells were used for immunofluorescence microscopy. MDCK cells expressing HA-D2S were plated on Transwell filters and grown to confluence (5–7 days). Cells were fixed in −20 °C methanol for 3 min. After washing with PBS, cells were blocked in PBS + 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 4% nonfat dry milk, 0.1% Triton X-100 for either 4 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The cells were then incubated with primary antibodies diluted to the appropriate concentrations in PBS + 0.2% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed three times for 10 min in PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100 followed by one wash with PBS. Secondary antibodies were diluted in PBS + 0.2% bovine serum albumin and applied for >2 h at room temperature. Cells were washed as above and mounted on glass slides using a Molwiol 4–88 mounting medium. Images were captured using a Leica TCS-NT confocal microscope and processed in Adobe Photoshop 4.0. In an attempt to isolate D2 dopamine receptor-associated proteins, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact with the third cytoplasmic loop. Screening of a rat hippocampal cDNA library yielded several potential interactors (His+), one (clone 7) of which was chosen for further pursuit, based on its moderately strong blue phenotype in the β-galactosidase assay. The specificity of the interaction in yeast was tested by retransforming pPC86.clone7 along with the original bait pPC97.D2Li3, pPC97 alone, or a plasmid encoding an irrelevant bait back into yeast strain CG-1945. The interaction between the receptor loop and the novel protein specifically allowed growth on medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine (SC-Leu/Trp/His) (Fig. 1). Neither the bait protein, GAL4BD-D2Li3, nor the prey protein were able to activate transcription of the reporter genes in the presence of only empty prey or bait vectors, respectively (Fig. 1). Digestion of the library plasmid, pPC86.clone7, with SalI and NotI yielded an ∼2-kilobase pair cDNA fragment (data not shown). Sequencing of this fragment and analysis of the cDNA sequence using the BLAST programs at the NCBI indicated that the cDNA insert in pPC86.clone7 encoded amino acids 100–767 of the recently identified protein spinophilin. Spinophilin was originally identified in another yeast two-hybrid screen as a PP-1-interacting protein (10Allen P.B. Ouimet C.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9956-9961Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Subsequently, spinophilin was also described as an actin-binding protein, based on ability to bind 125I-labeled actin by blot overlay analysis, and termed neurabin-II (11Satoh A. Nakanishi H. Obaishi H. Wada M. Takahashi K. Satoh K. Hirao K. Nishioka H. Hata Y. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3470-3475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Spinophilin is an 817-amino acid protein that is expressed in many tissues but enriched in brain and contains several important structural domains. At the amino terminus, from amino acids 1–154, is a putative actin-binding domain (11Satoh A. Nakanishi H. Obaishi H. Wada M. Takahashi K. Satoh K. Hirao K. Nishioka H. Hata Y. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3470-3475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal half of the protein contains both a single PDZ domain and a region predicted to form a coiled-coil structure (10Allen P.B. Ouimet C.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9956-9961Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 11Satoh A. Nakanishi H. Obaishi H. Wada M. Takahashi K. Satoh K. Hirao K. Nishioka H. Hata Y. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3470-3475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 3 A). Typically, PDZ domains bind to specific carboxyl-terminal sequences of the form E(S/T)X(V/I)COOH, although there are exceptions to this consensus (19Kornau H.C. Seeburg P.H. Kennedy M.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In recent years this domain has been implicated as a common protein-protein interaction domain found in proteins that function as scaffolds for organizing ion channels, receptors, and cytoplasmic signaling components into macromolecular signaling complexes (see Refs. 19Kornau H.C. Seeburg P.H. Kennedy M.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar and 20Sheng M. Wyszynski M. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar for review). This protein was named spinophilin on the basis of its intense immunoreactivity in the head and neck of dendritic spines on hippocampal and striatal neurons. Although spinophilin is most highly concentrated in hippocampus, it also expressed at high levels in many brain regions, including caudate, putamen, and hypothalamus, with lower levels being expressed in cerebellum and cortex (10Allen P.B. Ouimet C.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9956-9961Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). These brain regions correspond to regions where moderate to high levels of D2 dopamine receptor expression have been observed (21Levey A.I. Hersch S.M. Rye D.B. Sunahara R.K. Niznik H.B. Kitt C.A.

A series of GST fusion proteins shown schematically (A, right) were expressed and purified from bacteria as shown in the Coomassie-stained gel (A, left). The fusions proteins are as follows:lane 1, GST alone; lane 2, GST-spinophilin (100–767) (two-hybrid clone, as marked by arrowheads); lane 3, GST-spinophilin (100–371); lane 4, GST-spinophilin (354–494); lane 5, GST-spinophilin (488–593); lane 6, GST-spinophilin (100–543). B, 5 μl of in vitro translated 35S-labeled His6-D2Li3 were incubated with each GST fusion protein immobilized on beads. Bound proteins were visualized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and a PhosphorImager analysis. One-half the input to each reaction was analyzed (In). The recombinant D2L third cytoplasmic loop bound specifically to GST-spinophilin fusion proteins containing amino acids 100–371.C, because spinophilin is known to bind PP-1, we tested where this binding occurs using the set of GST-spinophilin fusion proteins and in vitro translated PP-1γ1. PP-1 binds to spinophilin in the region between amino acids 371–488, at a site distinct from the D2Li3-binding site, because GST-spinophilin (100–371) can still bind D2Li3 but not PP-1, and GST-spinophilin (354–494) can bind PP-1 but not D2Li3. Therefore, D2 receptors and PP-1 may interact with spinophilin at distinct sites at the same time, as is shown inD. Lane numbers in B, C, andD correspond to the fusion proteins diagramed inA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To confirm the interaction between the third cytoplasmic loop of D2L and spinophilin biochemically, we used an in vitro binding assay to test for the direct interaction of recombinant fusion proteins. GST, GST-PAM (unrelated protein), and GST-spinophilin (100–767) were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and incubated with His6-tagged D2Li3. After extensive washing the bound fraction was analyzed by blotting with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated S protein. We found that the His6-D2Li3 fusion protein specifically bound the GST-spinophilin (100–767) fusion but not GST or GST-PAM-CD (Fig.2), confirming our yeast two-hybrid results. As discussed above, spinophilin has several domains that suggest specific functions. Spinophilin has been reported to bind F-actin through an amino-terminal actin-binding domain (11Satoh A. Nakanishi H. Obaishi H. Wada M. Takahashi K. Satoh K. Hirao K. Nishioka H. Hata Y. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3470-3475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), as well as PP-1 through an interaction carboxyl-terminal to amino acid 296 (10Allen P.B. Ouimet C.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9956-9961Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested in narrowing the site of interaction between D2Li3 and spinophilin to a specific region of spinophilin. To do this, a series of GST fusion proteins with various regions of spinophilin were constructed and purified from bacteria (Fig. 3 A).35S-Labeled proteins were incubated with GST fusion proteins, and bound protein complexes were isolated, washed, separated by electrophoresis, and analyzed by PhosphorImager analysis. Binding of labeled D2L third cytoplasmic loop to spinophilin only occurred with GST-spinophilin fusion proteins containing the region encompassed by amino acids 100–371 (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2,3, and 6). The site of interaction between spinophilin and D2L dopamine receptors occurs within the unique region distal to the actin-binding domain but upstream of the both the PDZ domain and the coiled-coil. Interestingly, the interaction occurs independently of the PDZ domain, suggesting that spinophilin links D2 receptors to other membrane-anchored proteins that contain carboxyl-terminal PDZ ligand sequences. Spinophilin is also known to associate with protein phosphatase-1. PP-1 is a ubiquitously expressed protein phosphatase; its activity is regulated in different tissues by tissue-specific binding proteins (24Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). In the nervous system, cells that receive dopaminergic input contain DARPP-32 (dopamine and cAMP regulated phosphoprotein,M r = 32,000), which, when phosphorylated in response to elevations in cAMP and protein kinase A activity mediated by D1 receptor activation, is a potent inhibitor of PP-1 activity. Recent data show that D2-selective agonists negatively regulate phosphorylation of DARPP-32 (25Nishi A. Snyder G.L. Greengard P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8147-8155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the initial description of spinophilin, the site of interaction with PP-1 was not mapped (10Allen P.B. Ouimet C.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9956-9961Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Several groups have reported consensus motifs for anchoring/targeting protein interactions with PP-1 (26Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 27Zhao S. Lee E.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28368-28372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar); spinophilin contains such a motif between amino acids 447–451 (R-K-I-H-F-S). We tested whether this site could mediate the interaction with PP-1 by incubating35S-labeled PP-1γ1 with the various GST-spinophilin fusion proteins as above. Fig. 3 C shows that PP-1γ1 bound specifically to all GST-spinophilin fusion proteins containing the putative PP-1 interaction site. Blot overlay assays with purified, digoxygenin-labeled PP-1 confirm that these three GST fusion proteins alone are able to bind PP-1. 2R. Terry and S. Shenolikar, personal communication. Binding of PP-1 was lost when spinophilin was truncated to delete this motif (Fig. 3C, lane 3, GST-spinophilin (100–371)). Interestingly, the same fragment was still able to bind to the third cytoplasmic loop of D2L (Fig. 3 B). These data indicate that D2 dopamine receptors bind to spinophilin through a distinct region upstream of the PP-1-binding site (Fig. 3). Furthermore, we tested whether D2Li3 and PP-1 could associate with spinophilin at the same time. Both radiolabeled proteins were able to bind GST-spinophilin when tested in the same reaction (Fig. 3 D). Although this result does not prove that the D2 third cytoplasmic loop and PP-1 interact with the same spinophilin molecule, it is consistent with the characterization of spinophilin as a linker protein that brings intracellular signaling molecules (PP-1) into close proximity of a membrane bound receptor (D2). Our data suggest that the interaction between the third cytoplasmic loop of D2 receptors and spinophilin occurs within the amino-terminal part of the region in spinophilin bridging the actin-binding domain and the PDZ domain. This segment is not well conserved among known proteins. In fact, spinophilin is similar to only one other protein, neurabin, in overall structural organization and primary sequence (11Satoh A. Nakanishi H. Obaishi H. Wada M. Takahashi K. Satoh K. Hirao K. Nishioka H. Hata Y. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3470-3475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar,16Nakanishi H. Obaishi H. Satoh A. Wada M. Mandai K. Satoh K. Nishioka H. Matsuura Y. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Alignment of the corresponding regions of spinophilin (100–371) and neurabin (101–372) reveals limited sequence identity, and ∼35% sequence similarity (Fig. 4 A). We were therefore interested in whether both spinophilin and neurabin could bind to the D2Li3 loop. The regions of spinophilin and neurabin above were produced as GST fusion proteins and assayed for binding to 35S-labeled D2Li3 loop. GST-spinophilin (101–370) specifically bound to the D2 third cytoplasmic loop (Fig. 4 B, lane 2), whereas the corresponding region of neurabin did not bind to the receptor loop (Fig. 4 B, lane 3). These data suggest that neurabin and spinophilin may serve distinct functions in vivo and furthers the suggestion of overlapping but distinct sets of binding partners. However, we have not tested other domains in neurabin and cannot rule out that another site in neurabin is responsible for binding the third cytoplasmic loop of D2 (or possibly other GPCRs). The functional significance of the two splice variants of D2 is still not understood. We therefore tested whether or not the interaction with spinophilin is specific for D2L versus D2S using both the yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro binding assays as described above. The third cytoplasmic loops of both D2L and D2S exhibit a comparable interaction; both are able to activate transcription of reporter genes in yeast and both bind specifically to GST-spinophilin fusion proteins when expressed in vitro as35S-labeled proteins (Fig.5). These data suggest that the 29-amino acid insert that is unique to the third cytoplasmic loop of D2L is not responsible for the interaction with spinophilin and that functional differences between the long and short isoforms are unlikely to arise from differential interactions with spinophilin. Although the data above demonstrate that the interaction between spinophilin and the third cytoplasmic loop of D2L and D2S seen in the yeast two-hybrid system also occurs as a direct interaction in vitro, they do not address the issue of an in vivointeraction. To begin to study this question, we constructed and expressed an HA-tagged D2S receptor in MDCK cells. MDCK cells are a cultured kidney epithelial cell line that grow as confluent monolayers of polarized cells. Previously, Satoh et al. (11Satoh A. Nakanishi H. Obaishi H. Wada M. Takahashi K. Satoh K. Hirao K. Nishioka H. Hata Y. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3470-3475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) showed that spinophilin is endogenously expressed in MDCK cells and is localized to the lateral cell surface, overlapping markers for adherens junctions. We expressed the HA-tagged receptor in these cells to see whether it would be targeted to the same subcellular domain as spinophilin. Saturation binding assays with the radioligand [3H]spiperone indicate the presence of functional ligand-binding sites only in the cells stably transfected with the HA-D2S construct (data not shown). Spinophilin was detected in these cells using rabbit polyclonal antibody NC152, and the receptor was detected using antibodies against the HA tag (BabCo). Spinophilin is localized to the lateral surface of MDCK cells (Fig. 6 A), as reported by Satoh et al. (11Satoh A. Nakanishi H. Obaishi H. Wada M. Takahashi K. Satoh K. Hirao K. Nishioka H. Hata Y. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3470-3475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, we also detect spinophilin staining apically in cells grown on Transwell filters, as well as a considerable amount of punctate intracellular staining (Fig.6 B). HA-D2S dopamine receptors are targeted to the lateral surface in these cells (Fig. 6), although as the expression level increases, significant amounts of receptor seem to be produced and stored in intracellular pools (data not shown). Merged images of the staining patterns of spinophilin and HA-D2S through a single optical slice indicate that the subcellular localization of these two proteins overlaps significantly, although not completely (data not shown), providing additional evidence for the interaction described above. Although these data do not provide direct evidence for an in vivo interaction, they do suggest that spinophilin and D2 receptors are found in the same membrane domain in polarized cells and that when co-expressed, they will be well positioned to form the interaction we observe in vitro. Currently, we are unable to co-immunopreciptate a D2 receptor-spinophilin complex. We speculate that this interaction may be intricately regulated in vivoand are exploring these possibilities. It will be important in the future to determine whether the disruption of the spinophilin-D2 receptor interaction has significant effects on downstream signaling events controlled by these receptors. Although we have co-localized spinophilin and D2 receptors in MDCK cells, it has yet to be determined whether these two molecules associate in neurons. One current hypothesis suggests that the polarity of membrane domains of epithelial cells mimics that of neurons (28Dotti C.G. Simons K. Cell. 1990; 62: 63-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar,29Craig A.M. Banker G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 267-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). It is not clear that such a model holds true in all cases (30Jareb M. Banker G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 855-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is necessary to look for an association between D2 receptors and spinophilin in neurons and to begin to probe the functional consequences of this interaction. Spinophilin and neurabin seem to be defining members of a family of single PDZ domain proteins that serve as direct links to the actin cytoskeleton. These two proteins share little homology with known proteins outside of the domains mentioned above but are themselves between 41 and 86% identical (11Satoh A. Nakanishi H. Obaishi H. Wada M. Takahashi K. Satoh K. Hirao K. Nishioka H. Hata Y. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3470-3475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The highest degree of homology is in the PDZ domain and in the region adjacent to and including the coiled-coil(s). These similarities again suggest that the two proteins may have overlapping but distinct functions in vivo. Recently, p70S6 kinase was shown to interact with the PDZ domain of neurabin through a carboxyl-terminal LRMNLCOOHmotif (31Burnett P.E. Blackshaw S. Lai M.M. Qureshi I.A. Burnett A.F. Sabatini D.M. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8351-8356Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This kinase is responsible for the phosphorylation of the S6 protein component of the 40 S subunit of ribosomes (32Proud C.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 181-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation generally occurs in response to mitogenic signals and results in an increased rate of protein synthesis (31Burnett P.E. Blackshaw S. Lai M.M. Qureshi I.A. Burnett A.F. Sabatini D.M. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8351-8356Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 32Proud C.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 181-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Spinophilin may provide a link between D2 dopamine receptors and intracellular mitogenic signaling events dependent on p70S6 kinase. Indeed, in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing D2 receptors, dopamine application elicits a wortmannin and rapamycin-sensitive activation of p70S6 kinase (33Welsh G.I. Hall D.A. Warnes A. Strange P.G. Proud C.G. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2139-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This activation is pertussis toxin-sensitive, suggesting that dopamine stimulation of p70S6 kinase activity proceeds through Gi/oclass G proteins (33Welsh G.I. Hall D.A. Warnes A. Strange P.G. Proud C.G. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2139-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Alternatively, spinophilin may serve as a scaffolding/adapter protein for multiple GPCRs. It is possible that spinophilin plays a central role in coordinating signaling pathways mediated by several different Gi-coupled receptors instead of acting specifically at a single type of receptor. Thus, a careful examination of the interactions between spinophilin and various membrane receptors and cytoplasmic signaling molecules will greatly aid our understanding of the specificity and diversity of GPCR signaling.

https://openalex.org/W1538376958,"The IκB kinases (IKKs) lie downstream of the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and activate NF-κB by phosphorylation of IκBα. This leads to IκBα degradation and release of NF-κB. In U937 monocytic cells, interleukin (IL)-1β (1 ng/ml) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α; 10 ng/ml) induced κB-dependent transcription equally. However, IKK activity was strongly induced by TNF-α but not by IL-1β. This was consistent with IκBα phosphorylation and degradation, yet TNF-α-induced NF-κB DNA binding was only 30–40% greater than for IL-1β. This was not explained by degradation of IκBβ, IκBε, or p105 nor nuclear translocation of NF-κB·IκBα complexes or degradation-independent release of NF-κB. Dominant negative (NIK) repressed TNF-α and IL-1β-induced κB-dependent transcription by ∼60% and ∼35%, respectively. These data reveal an imprecise relationship between IKK activation, IκBα degradation, and NF-κB DNA binding, suggesting the existence of additional mechanisms that regulate NF-κB activation. Finally, the lack of correlation between DNA binding and transcriptional activation plus the fact that PP1 and genistein both inhibited κB-dependent transcription without affecting DNA binding activity demonstrate the existence of regulatory steps downstream of NF-κB DNA binding. Therapeutically these data are important as inhibition of the NIK-IKK-IκBα cascade may not produce equivalent reductions in NF-κB-dependent gene expression. The IκB kinases (IKKs) lie downstream of the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and activate NF-κB by phosphorylation of IκBα. This leads to IκBα degradation and release of NF-κB. In U937 monocytic cells, interleukin (IL)-1β (1 ng/ml) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α; 10 ng/ml) induced κB-dependent transcription equally. However, IKK activity was strongly induced by TNF-α but not by IL-1β. This was consistent with IκBα phosphorylation and degradation, yet TNF-α-induced NF-κB DNA binding was only 30–40% greater than for IL-1β. This was not explained by degradation of IκBβ, IκBε, or p105 nor nuclear translocation of NF-κB·IκBα complexes or degradation-independent release of NF-κB. Dominant negative (NIK) repressed TNF-α and IL-1β-induced κB-dependent transcription by ∼60% and ∼35%, respectively. These data reveal an imprecise relationship between IKK activation, IκBα degradation, and NF-κB DNA binding, suggesting the existence of additional mechanisms that regulate NF-κB activation.

Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4282) Google Scholar and 2Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). Proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α rapidly induce NF-κB DNA binding and κB-dependent transcription in most cell types (1Barnes P.J. Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4282) Google Scholar, 2Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). NF-κB DNA binding activity comprises homo- and, more usually, heterodimers of Rel proteins such as RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, NF-κB1 (p105/p50), and NF-κB2 (p100/p52) (2Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). NF-κB is held inactive in the cytoplasm by inhibitory IκB proteins including IκBα, IκBβ, IκBγ, and IκBε. Agonists such as TNF-α and IL-1β result in phosphorylation of IκBα at serines 32 and 36 (3Traenckner E.B. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar, 4Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). These phosphorylation events lead to ubiquitination of IκBα followed by its rapid degradation by the 26 S proteasome (5Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). This releases active NF-κB, typically p50/p65 heterodimers, which translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription via κB enhancer elements. Recently a high molecular mass, ≈700 kDa, complex has been described that contains kinase activities specific for serines 32 and 36 of IκBα (6DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar, 7Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A.

Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). The two main IκBα kinase (IKK) activities in this complex, termed the IKK signalsome, have been cloned and are called IKKα and IKKβ. In addition, the upstream kinase, where the IL-1β and TNF-α signaling pathways converge before IKK activation, has been identified as a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase and named NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) (9Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). As NIK interacts with and stimulates IKK activity and can phosphorylate IKKα on serine 176, it is likely that NIK lies immediately upstream of the IKKs in the NF-κB activation cascade (10Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 11Nakano H. Shindo M. Sakon S. Nishinaka S. Mihara M. Yagita H. Okumura K. Proc. Natl.

A. 1998; 95: 3792-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). However, the degree to which these signaling events apply to different cell types and different inducing agents is presently unclear. In asthmatic individuals, elevated levels of activated NF-κB are found in sputum macrophage, suggesting that cells of the monocytic lineage may play a significant role in asthmatic inflammation (13Hart L.A. Krishnan V.L. Adcock I.M. Barnes P.J. Chung K.F. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1998; 158: 1585-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Human monocytic U937 cells were therefore used to investigate the NIK-IKK-IκB signal transduction pathway in the activation of NF-κB and κB-dependent transcription by IL-1β and TNF-α. U937 cells (ECACC code 85011440) were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Sigma), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2.8 μg/ml amphotericin B (complete medium) and were maintained between 2–9 × 105 cells/ml. Cells were stimulated in RPMI medium as above but supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum at 5 × 105cells/ml. IL-1β and TNF-α (R&D Systems, Abingdon, Oxon) were used at 1 ng/ml and 10 ng/ml, respectively. Where used, cycloheximide (10 μg/ml; Sigma) was added 5 min before stimulation,N-carbobenzyloxy-Leu-Leu-leucinal (MG-132) (10 μm; Sigma) was added 60 min before stimulation, and PP1 and genistein (Calbiochem) were added 30 min before stimulation at concentrations of 10 μm and 100 μm, respectively. Drugs were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and were diluted to final concentrations of less than 0.1% (v/v). At this level Me2SO had no effect on activation of NF-κB or κB-dependent transcription (data not shown). The NF-κB-dependent reporter, pGL3.6κB.BG.luc, contains two tandem repeats of the sequence 5′-GGG GAC TTT C CC TGG GGA CTT TCC CTGGGG ACT TTC CC-3′, which contains three copies of the decameric NF-κB binding site (underlined) upstream of a minimal β-globin promoter driving a luciferase gene as described previously (14Schwarzer N. Nost R. Seybold J. Parida S.K. Fuhrmann O. Krull M. Schmidt R. Newton R. Hippenstiel S. Domann E. Chakraborty T. Suttorp N. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3010-3018PubMed Google Scholar). The reporter, pGL3.6κBmut.luc, is as above except that the core NF-κB binding site is mutated to 5′-GCC ACT TTC C-3′ (mutated bases underlined). The NIK and dominant negative NIK expression vectors were gifts from David Wallach (9Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 10 × 106 cells in 250 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution were electroporated with 10 μg of either pGL3.6κB.BG.luc or pGL3.6κB.BG.luc using a Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad) set for 200 V, 950 microfarads. For overexpression studies, electroporation was performed using either 5 μg of pGL3.6κB.BG.luc plus 5 μg of pcDNA3 or NIK expression vector or using 2.5 μg of pGL3.6κB.BG.luc plus 10 μg of pcDNA3 or dominant negative NIK expression vector. Transfected cells were incubated in 10 ml of complete medium for 12 h before plating onto 2× 6-well plates in RPMI medium containing 2% fetal calf serum. Cells were harvested 6 h after stimulation and assayed for luciferase activity using a commercially available luciferase reporter gene assay (Promega, Southampton, UK). After normalization to protein concentration, data were expressed as fold activation. Extracts were prepared essentially according to Osborn et al. (15Osborn L. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2336-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution before resuspension in 10 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% v/v Nonidet P40 (Nonidet P-40), 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) (Buffer A). After a 2-min incubation on ice, nuclei were separated by centrifugation at 1000 g for 10 min. Supernatants (cytoplasmic extracts) were retained. For electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), nuclei were resuspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% v/v glycerol, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 1 mm DTT (Buffer B) and incubated on ice for 60 min with vigorous mixing. Nuclear debris was removed by centrifugation, and supernatants were diluted 4-fold in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 1 mm DTT (Buffer C). For Western blot analysis, nuclear pellets were rinsed twice in Hanks' balanced salt solution and then resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.65% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 1 mm DTT (lysis buffer) and subjected to one freeze/thaw cycle. Nuclear proteins, 5 μg, were used in binding reactions as described previously (16Newton R. Adcock I.M. Barnes P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 518-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Consensus NF-κB probe (Promega) containing the decameric NF-κB site (underlined) was 5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG-3′ (sense stand). Specificity was determined by the prior addition of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled competitor consensus oligonucleotide. For supershift analysis, nuclear extracts were incubated on ice for 90 min with antisera raised to various Rel proteins (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 0.4 μg/ml before the addition of radiolabeled oligonucleotide. Reactions were separated on 6% nondenaturing acrylamide gels in 0.25 × Tris-buffered EDTA. Gels were dried, and protein-DNA complexes were visualized by autoradiography. Cytoplasmic or nuclear extract, 20 μg, was added to an equal volume of 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% w/v SDS, 10% v/v glycerol, 0.1% w/v bromphenol blue, 2% v/v 2-mercaptoethanol (2× SDS loading buffer) and boiled for 5 min. Samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to hybond-ECL membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were probed with rabbit anti-sera to human IκBα (C-21), IκBβ (C-20), IκBγ (5177C), IκBε (M-121), or p65 (C-20) antibody (Santa Cruz) diluted 1:4000, 1:1000, 1:500, 1:500, or 1:2000, respectively. The p50/p105 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) was used at 1 μg/μl. For detecting the serine 32-phosphorylated IκBα, rabbit anti-human IκBα antibody (number 9240) (New England Biolabs, Hitchin, Herts) was used at 1:1000 dilution. After washing, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (DAKO Ltd, High Wickham, Buckinghamshire) and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cytoplasmic extracts, 100 μg, prepared in Buffer A supplemented with 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, and 5 μg/ml N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) were precleared by the addition of 1.0 μg of normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz) together with 20 μl of protein A-Agarose (Santa Cruz) for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, supernatants were incubated with 5 μl of p65 antibody-agarose conjugate (SC-109AC) (Santa Cruz) for 2 h at 4 °C, and immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation. After washing 4 times with buffer A supplemented with inhibitors and 0.05% Tween 20, immunocomplexes were resuspended in 40 μl of 1× SDS loading buffer and boiled for 5 min before Western blot analysis. IKK signalsomes were immunoprecipitated from cytoplasmic extracts, 200 μg, using 1 μg of IKKα antibody (H744) (Santa Cruz) and kinase assays performed as described previously (7Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar). Briefly, one-half of each immunoprecipitate was resuspended in 25 μl of 20 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 2 mmMgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 10 μm adenosine triphosphate (ATP), 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm 4-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmbenzamidine, 0.5 mm PMSF, aprotinin at 25 μg/ml, leupeptin at 10 μg/ml, pepstatin at 2 μg/ml, and 1 mmDTT (kinase buffer) in the presence of the substrates 1 μm GST-IκBα (1Barnes P.J.

Reactions were stopped by the addition of 6× SDS loading buffer before SDS-PAGE and visualization by autoradiography. Biochemically purified IKK signalsome complex was used as a positive control (gift from Jorg Eder, Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland). To check loading and confirm the presence of IKKs, remaining immunoprecipitates were subject to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using 1:500 dilutions of IKKα and IKKβ (H740) antibodies (Santa Cruz). Cells were incubated in phosphate-free RPMI media for 2 h before the addition of [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 0.2 mCi/ml and incubated for a further 4 h. Cells were then treated as indicated before harvesting in 200 μl of 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS (radioimmune precipitation buffer) supplemented with 0.5 mmPMSF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, and 50 mm NaF on ice for 15 min. Immunoprecipitation of p65 was performed as above except that radioimmune precipitation buffer was used in place of Buffer A. Samples were run on 10% SDS-PAGE before autoradiography or Western blotting. Transient transfection of the NF-κB-dependent reporter, pGL3.6κB.BG.luc, into U937 cells showed that IL-1β (1 ng/ml) and TNF-α (10 ng/ml) activate κB-dependent transcription to similar extents (8.3 ± 1.9-fold for IL-1β and 8.5 ± 1.6-fold for TNF-α) (Fig.1 A). These responses were κB-specific, as a reporter with mutated κB recognition sites, pGL3.6κB.mut.BG.luc, produced 10–100-fold lower luciferase expression, which was unaffected by TNF-α or IL-1β treatment (data not shown). EMSA revealed that both IL-1β and TNF-α strongly induced NF-κB DNA binding (Fig. 1 B). However, the TNF-α response occurred with faster kinetics than the IL-1β response and generally showed the highest overall activation (Fig. 1 B). Thus TNF-α-induced NF-κB was near maximal by 15 min, whereas IL-1β-induced NF-κB was not maximal until 30 min post-stimulation. Supershift analysis was performed to identify the Rel proteins involved in these responses (Fig. 1 C). In IL-1β and TNF-α treated extracts, anti-p50 antisera and anti-p65 antisera resulted in reduced mobility of DNA binding complexes. The NF-κB complex was unaffected by anti-c-Rel, RelB, and p52 antisera. These data indicate that in U937 cells, IL-1β- and TNF-α-inducible NF-κB DNA binding complexes are made up of both p50 and p65 proteins and not c-Rel, RelB, or p52. The fact that heterogeneous bands were observed suggests that both homo- and heterodimers of p50 and p65 may be present. Western blot analysis was performed on cytoplasmic extracts to examine the effect of IL-1β and TNF-α on IκBα degradation. Cells treated with vehicle showed no change in IκBα protein for the duration of the experiment (Fig. 2 A, left panel). After IL-1β treatment, little or no change in IκBα levels was observed during the first 15 min post-stimulation, and by 30 min, a maximum of only 40% loss of IκBα was observed (Fig.2 A, middle panel). By 1 h, IκBα protein levels had returned to above resting levels, which is consistent with NF-κB-dependent activation of the IκBαgene (17Le Bail O. Schmidt Ullrich R. Israel A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5043-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 18Ito C.Y. Kazantsev A.G. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3787-3792Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In marked contrast, TNF-α caused a rapid loss of IκBα within 15 min of stimulation, and again resynthesis was observed 1 h post-stimulation (Fig. 2 A, right panel). These data agree with the fact that NF-κB DNA binding was induced more rapidly by TNF-α than by IL-1β. However, by 30 min, NF-κB DNA binding was essentially similar with both stimuli, yet loss of IκBα by TNF-α stimulation was almost total, whereas IL-1β resulted in a mere 40% reduction. Furthermore, by 15 min, IL-1β resulted in only a 15% loss of IκBα yet caused over 60% relative DNA binding activity. One explanation for these discrepancies could be that IL-1β-dependent induction of IκBα resynthesis occurred more rapidly such that total disappearance of IκBα was prevented. This possibility was addressed by stimulation in the presence of cycloheximide to prevent new protein synthesis (Fig.2 B). In control cells, cycloheximide had little effect on IκBα protein levels (Fig. 2 B, left panel). After IL-1β treatment in the presence of cycloheximide, loss of IκBα protein was less than 50% that of control at 30 min. This contrasts with the complete loss of IκBα within 15 min of TNF-α treatment in the presence of cycloheximide. The above data raise the possibility that IκBα-dependent release of NF-κB may not fully account for the induction NF-κB DNA binding activity observed after IL-1β treatment in U937 cells. We therefore focused on the potential role of other IκB proteins in activation of NF-κB. At 60 min, IκBβ showed a maximal loss of 30–40% with IL-1β and more than 50% loss after TNF-α treatment (Fig. 2 C). The kinetics of TNF-α-induced loss of IκBβ were delayed with respect to loss of IκBα and the repression of IκBβ protein levels, although modest, were more prolonged. The effects of IL-1β on loss of IκBβ were less pronounced than for TNF-α and only observed around 1–2 h post-stimulation. Consequently, IκBβ does not appear to contribute to levels of activated NF-κB observed before 1 h after IL-1β treatment. Again, relatively minor decreases were observed for IκBε after IL-1β and TNF-α treatments, and in each case, the kinetics were similar, suggesting that IκBε does not play a major role in release of active NF-κB (Fig. 2 D). In addition, degradation of the p50 precursor, p105, via the ubiquitin pathway may release active p50/p65 heterodimers (19Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar), whereas in some cells types, including lymphoid cells, the C-terminal part of p105 can be independently transcribed to produce IκBγ (20Inoue J.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3003-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis with an antibody for IκBγ, which also reacts with p105, revealed only p105 in U937 cells. Loss of p105 after treatment with IL-1β or TNF-α occurred with similar kinetics and in each case was no more than 50% (Fig. 2 E). In addition, a p50 antibody that cross-reacts with p105 also detected p105 and gave similar results to the IκBγ antibody (data not shown). Furthermore and consistent with the supershift data, immunoblot analysis failed to detect either p52 or precursor protein p100 (data not shown). These data suggest that IκBβ, IκBε, or p105 may not be the major sources of active NF-κB observed on EMSA after IL-1β or TNF-α stimulation in U937 cells. In Jurkat T-cells, pervanadate causes release of NF-κB without degradation of IκBα, and this event involves tyrosine phosphorylation rather than serine phosphorylation of IκBα (22Imber"

More than 10 members of the PKC family have been identified by molecular cloning. All PKCs contain an amino-terminal regulatory domain and a carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain. Based on structural differences in the regulatory domain, PKCs are generally classified into three groups; conventional PKC (α, βI, βII, and γ subtypes), novel PKC (δ, ε, η, and θ subtypes), and atypical PKC (ζ and ι subtypes). The regulatory domain of conventional PKCs is composed of two conserved membrane-targeting modules, C1 and C2 domains, as well as a pseudosubstrate region and variable regions. Conventional PKCs are activated by the Ca2+-dependent translocation of proteins to the membrane containing phosphatidylserine (PS) and diacylglycerol (DAG). Structural (3Sutton R.B. Sprang S.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 1395-1405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and mutational (4Medkova M. Cho W. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15615-15623Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) studies have shown that the C2 domain of conventional PKC is responsible for the Ca2+-dependent translocation of the protein to membranes. It has also been shown that the C1 domain, which is composed of a tandem repeat of cysteine-rich zinc-finger domains (C1a and C1b), is involved in binding of PKC to DAG and its structural analogs, phorbol esters (6Ono Y. Fujii T. Igarashi K. Kuno T. Tanaka C. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4868-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 7Bell R.M. Burns D.J. J. Biol.

However, the temporal and spatial sequences of membrane targeting and activation of PKC have not been fully elucidated. Furthermore, the interplay of the C1 and C2 domains in these complex processes is poorly understood. Finally, the roles of individual zinc finger domains in the DAG-dependent membrane binding and activation of PKC are not well defined. To address these questions, we functionally expressed the isolated C1 and C2 domains of PKC-α and measured their vesicle binding and monolayer penetration. We also mutated C1a and C1b domain residues of the native PKC-α and measured the effects of mutations on vesicle binding, enzyme activity, and monolayer penetration. Results indicate that the C2 domain of PKC-α is responsible for its initial Ca2+- and PS-dependent membrane binding, whereas the C1 domain is involved in subsequent membrane penetration and DAG binding, which eventually lead to enzyme activation. These studies also show that the two C1 domains have distinct roles in membrane binding and activation of PKC-α.DISCUSSIONThe membrane translocation and activation of conventional PKC requires Ca2+, PS, and DAG under physiological conditions. Conventional PKCs have two membrane-targeting modules, the C1 and C2 domains, which are responsible for its membrane binding and activation. A consensus mechanism of in vitro PKC activation is that the C1 and C2 domains work in concert to bring the PKC molecule to the membrane surface, where the protein undergoes conformational changes to remove the pseudosubstrate region from the active site, resulting in PKC activation (1Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar, 37Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Extensive structural and mutation studies have helped understand the roles of individual domains in the membrane targeting and activation of PKCs and identify those amino acids that are critically involved in these processes. For instance, our structure-function study of the C2 domain of PKC-α defined the role of C2 domain as a membrane docking unit as well as a module that triggers conformational changes of protein for its activation (4Medkova M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17544-17552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Also, extensive mutagenesis studies on the C1b domain of PKC-δ identified the essential amino acids for phorbol ester binding (38Kazanietz M.G. Wang S. Milne G.W.A. Lewin N.E. Liu H.L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21852-21859Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar,39Wang S. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Marquez V.E. Milne G.W.A. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 2541-2553Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Less is known, however, about the temporal and spatial sequences of membrane targeting and activation of PKCs. A recent elegant cell study indicated that the activation of PKC-γ follows well defined sequential steps in which the Ca2+-dependent membrane binding of the C2 domain is followed by the DG/phorbol ester binding of the C1 domain (40Oancea E. Meyer T. Cell. 1998; 95: 307-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). This report describes systematic structure-function studies of the two domains of PKC-α that provide first detailed insights into the temporal and spatial sequences ofin vitro membrane targeting and activation of PKC-α.Differential Roles of C1 and C2 Domains in Membrane Binding of PKC-αFor most peripheral membrane binding proteins, both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions play roles in their membrane binding, although their relative contributions vary with the type of proteins (17Lichtenbergova L. Yoon E.T. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14128-14136Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 41Lee B.-I. Yoon E.T. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4231-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 42Snitko Y. Koduri R. Han S.-K. Othman R. Baker S.F. Molini B.J. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14325-14333Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We have shown that the membrane binding of PKC-α is also driven by these interactions; electrostatic interactions of the protein-bound calcium ions and other cationic residues of PKC-α with anionic phospholipids and hydrophobic interactions resulting from the Ca2+- and PS-dependent penetration of PKC into the hydrophobic core of the membrane (4Medkova M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17544-17552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 12Medkova M. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4892-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, Ca2+ and PS are involved not only in direct electrostatic interaction but also in eliciting hydrophobic interactions. Extensive in vitro studies have shown that the activation of conventional PKC requires the binding of multiple PS molecules (43Mosior M. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17271-17279Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and a single DAG (or phorbol ester) molecule to PKC (34Hannun Y.A. Loomis C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10039-10043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, the PS specificity of conventional PKC is much more pronounced in the presence of DAG in the membrane, suggesting the synergism between PS-binding site(s) and a DAG-binding site (44Newton A.C. Keranen L.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6651-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Structural (32Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) and mutation analyses (38Kazanietz M.G. Wang S. Milne G.W.A. Lewin N.E. Liu H.L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 39: 2541-2553Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) have clearly identified the DAG-binding site in each of two C1 domains, although it is unclear which of the two binding sites is actually involved in binding to a single DAG molecule. The presence and location of PS-specific binding site(s) remains controversial, however, because some synthetic phospholipids, such as dansyl-PE, are also able to simulate the effects of PS (23Mosior M. Golini E.S. Epand R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 1907-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Our studies indicate that the C2 domain of PKC-α has significant PS selectivity, whereas the C1 domain shows essentially no selectivity. Both the Ca2+ dependence (Fig. 3) and the anionic lipid content dependence (Fig. 5) of vesicle binding demonstrate that the isolated C2 domain prefers PS to PG. It should be noted that the observed PS selectivity of the isolated C2 domain is comparable to that of the native PKC-α measured in the absence of DAG under the same conditions (Fig. 4). Taking into account that the pronounced PS specificity of PKC-α results from the synergism between PS- and DAG-binding sites, these findings provide strong evidence that the C2 domain is largely responsible for the intrinsic PS-selectivity of PKC-α. This also points to the presence of PS-binding sites in the C2 domain. We previously showed that some residues in the C2 domain of PKC-α are involved in Ca2+- and PS-dependent partial membrane penetration (4Medkova M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17544-17552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The monolayer penetration properties of the isolated C2 domain corroborate this notion. When compared with the C1 domain, however, the C2 domain would play only a minor role in membrane penetration and hydrophobic interactions. In conjunction with our previous study on the C2 domain of PKC-α (4Medkova M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17544-17552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), these studies thus show that the C2 domain is mainly responsible for its Ca2+- and PS-dependent electrostatic binding to membranes.These studies also show that the C1 domain of PKC-α plays a central role in membrane penetration and resulting hydrophobic interactions. This notion is consistent with the DAG binding capacity of the C1 domain. Because DAG lacks a large polar head group, it would be slightly buried from the polar surface of phospholipid membranes, and as a result, it might not be readily accessible to PKC unless the C1 domain with a DAG-binding site penetrates into membranes. The isolated C1 domain demonstrates exceptional monolayer penetration power that far exceeds that of the native PKC-α. This suggests that the membrane penetrating power of the C1 domain in the PKC-α molecule is actually restrained by other parts of the molecule. The high affinity of the isolated C1 domain for PDBu (see Fig. 1) shows that it is functionally folded, thereby ruling out the possibility that high monolayer penetration power of the isolated C1 domain is due to the incomplete folding of the domain. The vesicle binding and monolayer penetration of the isolated C1 domain is independent of Ca2+ and PS. Thus, unlike the case of native PKC-α, the membrane penetration of the isolated C1 domain is not triggered by the specific PS binding and concomitant conformational changes (12Medkova M. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4892-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), but takes place spontaneously due to a propensity of the C1 domain to penetrate into the membrane. Both the vesicle binding and the monolayer penetration of the C1 domain require, however, the presence of anionic phospholipids, indicating that nonspecific electrostatic interactions are a driving force for its initial membrane binding. A recent monolayer study has shown that the monolayer penetration of surface active proteins, such as apolipoproteins, follows a two-step mechanism in which electrostatic surface adsorption precedes the insertion of hydrophobic side chains into the hydrophobic moiety of the monolayer (45Lecompte M.F. Bras A.C. Dousset N. Portas I. Salvayre R. Ayrault-Jarrier M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16165-16171Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Based on the tertiary structure and monolayer penetration properties of the isolated C1 domain, it appears that the membrane penetration of the C1 domain follows a similar mechanism. For the isolated C1 domain, nonspecific electrostatic interactions between anionic phospholipids and the cationic cluster in the middle of the C1 domain (see Fig.7 A) would bring the domain to the membrane surface and then the hydrophobic tip of the domain would penetrate into the hydrophobic core of the membrane to bind DAG. For the whole PKC-α molecule, the C2 domain would primarily play the role of bringing the C1 domain to the membrane surface. The contribution of C1 domain cationic residues to the initial electrostatic membrane interactions of PKC-α remains to be assessed. As is the case with the native PKC-α (12Medkova M. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4892-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), DAG does not enhance the penetration of the C1 domain, although it greatly increases the vesicle binding affinity. This indicates that the DAG binding is the consequence but not the driving force of the membrane penetration of the domain. In this regard, it is noteworthy that DAG has been shown to induce local PS-rich membrane domains (46Dibble A.R. Hinderliter A.K. Sando J.J. Biltonen R.L. Biophys J. 1996; 71: 1877-1890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The preferential binding of conventional PKCs to such domains would trigger the membrane penetration and DAG binding. Thus, DAG might indirectly promote the membrane penetration of conventional PKCs via the PS domain formation. Taken together, these studies show that the C1 domain is primarily involved in the membrane penetration of PKC-α, which is essential for its DAG binding, hydrophobic membrane interactions, and activation.Differential Roles of C1a and C1b DomainsOne-to-one stoichiometry of conventional PKC-DAG (or phorbol ester) binding indicates that only one of two DAG-binding sites is actually involved in the DAG binding and PKC activation. A recent binding study using a fluorescent phorbol ester analog suggested that PKC-α has two discrete phorbol ester-binding sites with different affinity (47Slater S.J. Kelly M.B. Taddeo F.J. Rubin E. Stubbs C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17160-17165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was also found that DAG and phorbol esters bind to the two discrete sites with opposite affinity, so that a high affinity DAG-binding site is a low affinity phorbol ester-binding site and vice versa(48Slater S.J. Ho C. Kelly M.B. Larkin J.D. Taddeo F.J. Yeager M.D. Stubbs C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4627-4631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Our structure-function analyses of the two zinc finger domains show that the C1a domain contains the high affinity DAG-binding site. We designed our mutations based on the premise that the removal of hydrophobic residues from the tip of each zinc finger domain that contains the DAG binding pocket would greatly reduce its ability to penetrate into the hydrophobic core of the membrane, thereby lowering DAG affinity. The effects of mutations on the monolayer penetration of PKC-α indicate that the upper part of the C1a domain penetrates into the membrane, whereas its counterpart in the C1b domain does not. Thus, only the C1a domain would be allowed to interact with DAG. These studies do not provide the quantitative information about the degree of membrane penetration by C1a domain. A large decrease in monolayer penetration by a single W58G mutation suggests that this residue might fully penetrate into the hydrophobic core of the membrane. Vesicle binding affinity and enzyme activity of the two groups of mutants corroborate the differential membrane penetration of the two C1 domains. C1a domain mutants (W58G and F60G) have much lower vesicle binding affinity and enzyme activity than does the wild type PKC-α, whereas corresponding C1b domain mutants (Y123G and L125G) behave essentially the same as the wild type does. Both W58G and F60G show much larger decreases in activity than expected from their reduced membrane affinity. In particular, W58G show only 10% of the wild type activity even when it is driven to fully bind to vesicles by electrostatic interactions (e.g. with high PS concentrations in vesicles; see Fig. 11). This indicates that the membrane insertion of the C1a domain is absolutely necessary for PKC activity. However, our results could not rule out a possibility that C1b domain might also be able to interact with DAG without penetrating into the membrane. It has been generally proposed that the activation of conventional PKC results from the removal of the pseudosubstrate region from the active site of PKC (49Orr J.W. Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15263-15266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C1a domain is immediately linked to the pseudosubstrate region, and thus conformational changes accompanying the penetration of C1a domain into the membrane might provide a mechanical force to remove the pseudosubstrate region from the active site.The origin of the different membrane penetrating power of the two zinc finger domains is still unclear. Based on the domain structure of conventional PKC, however, one can speculate that the difference derives from a mechanical reason. As described above, the C1 domain in the intact PKC molecule cannot fully express its intrinsic membrane penetration power, presumably because other parts of the molecule interfere with the penetration. The C1a domain is flanked by the amino-terminal pseudosubstrate region and the C1b domain, whereas the C1b domain is immediately linked to the C1a domain and the C2 domain (see Fig. 13). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the movement of the C1a domain, which is preceded only by a short and putatively flexible amino-terminal region, might be energetically more favorable than that of C1b domain, which might entail a gross conformational change. It is also possible that the C1b domain is involved in stabilizing interactions with the C2 domain, which must be disrupted for the penetration of C1a domain to take place. Indeed, a recent study suggested that the C1b domain of PKC-β provides several ligands for Ca2+ sites in the C2 domain (3Sutton R.B. Sprang S.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 1395-1405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar).Although our data indicate that a large difference in DAG affinity between the two C1 domains derives mainly from the difference in their membrane localization, one cannot rule out the possibility that the two zinc finger domains actually have different intrinsic DAG/phorbol ester affinities. Conflicting results have been reported with respect to the relative DAG/phorbol ester affinity of the two zinc fingers in the C1 domain. On one hand, a cell study using isolated C1a and C1b domains of PKC-γ tagged with green fluorescence protein indicated that the C1a domain is mainly responsible for DAG/phorbol esters binding (50Oancea E. Teruel M.N. Quest A.F. Meyer T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 485-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). On the other hand, mutations of a conserved proline in each C1 domain of PKC-δ showed that C1b is responsible for phorbol ester-induced membrane translocation in vivo (51Szallasi Z. Boggi K. Gohari S. Biro T. Acs P. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18299-18301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, depending on the PKC isoform and the nature of C1 domain ligand, relative affinity of C1a and C1b domains might vary to large degrees (52Bogi K. Lorenzo P.S. Szallasi Z. Acs P. Wagner G.S. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1423-1428PubMed Google Scholar). In any event, our results underscore that relative affinity of the two C1 domains for a particular ligand depends not only on their intrinsic binding affinity but also on the spatial arrangement of the binding site and the ligand in the membrane. The relationship between the relative affinity of the two C1 domains of PKC-α for various phorbol esters and different membrane localization of these ligands is under investigation.Proposed Mechanism of in Vitro Membrane Binding and Activation of PKC-αBased on our previous and present studies, we propose the following mechanism for the in vitro membrane binding and activation of conventional PKC (Fig. 13). The protein initially binds to the membrane surface via the Ca2+-dependent PS binding of the C2 domain. Once bound to PS-containing membranes, the protein undergoes conformational changes that include the insertion of C1a domain into the membrane. This membrane penetration allows for optimal DAG binding and drives the release of pseudosubstrate region from the active site. The former results in enhanced hydrophobic interactions and overall membrane affinity, and the latter leads to PKC activation. The proposed temporal and spatial sequences are further supported by the following observations. First, dominant negative mutants of the C2 domain of PKC-α (e.g. D246N) containing the intact C1 domain can neither bind to nor penetrate into membranes even in the presence of DAG (4Medkova M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17544-17552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This indicates that the C2 domain must first bind to the membrane prior to the membrane penetration of the C1 domain. Second, in the absence of DAG in the membrane, Ca2+- and PS-dependent membrane binding properties of isolated C2 domain and dominant C1 domain mutants (e.g. W58G) are essentially the same as the native PKC. This again indicates that the C2 domain alone can bring the PKC molecule to the membrane surface. Third, membrane binding properties of the isolated C1 domain are distinct from those of the native PKC-α under all conditions employed, suggesting that the membrane binding of C1 domain might have to be primed by the membrane binding of C2 domain.Our proposed mechanism can successfully account for the in vitro Ca2+, PS- and DAG-dependent membrane binding, and activation of conventional PKC. However, the mechanism of phorbol ester-induced activation of PKC might be different from this mechanism (53Kazanietz M.G. Krausz K.W. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20878-20886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 54Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7589-7593Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Also, other factors, most notably PKC phosphorylation (55Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) and PKC adapter proteins (56Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar), must be taken into account to understand the in vivo membrane targeting and activation of PKC. The fact that our proposed mechanism is consistent with one proposed by Oancea and Meyer (40Oancea E. Meyer T. Cell. 1998; 95: 307-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) based on their cell studies using fluorescence-tagged PKC-γ suggests that in vivo andin vitro activation of PKC follows essentially the same mechanism. The proposed mechanism provides a conceptual framework to quantitatively determine the forces involved in individual steps, to identify the PKC residues essential for each step, and finally to test whether or not other groups of PKC, novel and atypical PKCs, are targeted to membranes and activated by the same mechanism. Protein kinases C (PKCs)1 are a family of serine/threonine kinases that transduce the myriad of signals activating cellular functions and proliferation (1Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar, 2Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2355) Google Scholar). More than 10 members of the PKC family have been identified by molecular cloning. All PKCs contain an amino-terminal regulatory domain and a carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain. Based on structural differences in the regulatory domain, PKCs are generally classified into three groups; conventional PKC (α, βI, βII, and γ subtypes), novel PKC (δ, ε, η, and θ subtypes), and atypical PKC (ζ and ι subtypes). The regulatory domain of conventional PKCs is composed of two conserved membrane-targeting modules, C1 and C2 domains, as well as a pseudosubstrate region and variable regions. Conventional PKCs are activated by the Ca2+-dependent translocation of proteins to the membrane containing phosphatidylserine (PS) and diacylglycerol (DAG). Structural (3Sutton R.B. Sprang S.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 1395-1405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and mutational (4Medkova M. Cho W. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15615-15623Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) studies have shown that the C2 domain of conventional PKC is responsible for the Ca2+-dependent translocation of the protein to membranes. It has also been shown that the C1 domain, which is composed of a tandem repeat of cysteine-rich zinc-finger domains (C1a and C1b), is involved in binding of PKC to DAG and its structural analogs, phorbol esters (6Ono Y.

However, DsbC shows more pronounced chaperone activity than does PDI in promoting the in vitroreactivation and suppressing aggregation of denaturedd-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) during refolding. Carboxymethylation of DsbC at Cys98 decreases its intrinsic fluorescence, deprives of its enzyme activities, but lowers only partly its chaperone activity in assisting GAPDH reactivation. Simultaneous presence of DsbC and PDI in the refolding buffer shows an additive effect on the reactivation of GAPDH. The assisted reactivation of GAPDH and the protein disulfide oxidoreductase activity of DsbC can both be inhibited by scrambled andS-carboxymethylated RNases, but not by shorter peptides, including synthetic 10- and 14-mer peptides andS-carboxymethylated insulin A chain. In contrast, all the three peptides and the two nonnative RNases inhibit PDI-assisted GAPDH reactivation and the reductase activity of PDI. DsbC assists refolding of denatured and reduced lysozyme to a higher level than does PDI in phosphate buffer and does not show anti-chaperone activity in HEPES buffer.

The formation of disulfide bonds is now known to be catalyzed by protein disulfide isomerase (PDI)1 in endoplasmic reticulum for eukaryotes (1Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) and by proteins of the Dsb family in periplasm for Gram-negative bacteria (2Missiakas D. Raina S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2465-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). DsbA, a monomeric soluble member of the Dsb family is the primary factor that catalyzes the oxidative formation of disulfide bonds (3Sone M. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10349-10352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). DsbC is a homodimer with four thiol groups in each 23-kDa subunit, two in the active site -Cys98-Gly-Tyr-Cys101- and the other two at positions Cys141 and Cys163 (4Shevchik V.E. Condemine G.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2013-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). DsbC catalyzes the rearrangement of disulfide bonds in concert with DsbA for the formation of native disulfides and has been recognized as a counterpart of eukaryotic PDI (3Sone M. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10349-10352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 6Zapun A. Missiakas D. Raina S. Creighton T.E.

Secondary structure prediction of DsbC suggests that the molecule appears to consist of two domains (8Frishman D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Preliminary x-ray diffraction data of native and selenomethionine DsbC have been reported (9Rybin V. Zapun A. Torronen A.

Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 1219-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar).Many in vitro and in vivo data have supported that as a foldase, PDI displays both isomerase and chaperone activities (10Wang C.C.

The chaperone activity of PDI greatly increases its efficiency as a foldase in promoting protein folding and in catalyzing the formation of native disulfide bonds (19Wang C.C. Tsou C.L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 382-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Most disulfide-bonded proteins in bacteria are located in the periplasm and the outer-membrane or are secreted to extracellular medium through the periplasm as their disulfide bonds can be formed readily in the oxidative periplasm but not in the reductive cytoplasm (2Missiakas D. Raina S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2465-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The bacterial periplasm is separated from the environment by only the permeable outer membrane and is therefore liable to be affected by environmental fluctuation. However, no classical molecular chaperone has been identified in the periplasm so far (2Missiakas D. Raina S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2465-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Hence, we are interested in examining whether DsbC, like its eukaryotic counterpart PDI, has chaperone activity to promote the formation of correct disulfide bonds during protein folding. In fact, DsbA has been suggested to function as a chaperone in the maturation of secreted virulence factors of Vibrio cholerae (20Peek J.A. Taylor R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6210-6214Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and in pilus biogenesis of Escherichia coli. (21Jacob-Dubuisson F. Pinkner J. Xu Z. Striker R. Padmanhaban A. Hultgren S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11552-11556Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The high-resolution crystal structure analysis of DsbA (22Guddat L.W. Bardwell J.C.A. Zander T. Martin J.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1148-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) has shown that an extensive uncharged surface surrounding the active-site disulfide is responsible for peptide binding. We have also presented evidence for the chaperone activity of DsbA in assisting the in vitro refolding ofd-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (23Zheng W.D. Quan H. Song J.L. Yang S.L. Wang C.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recently, Darby et al. (24Darby N.J. Raina S. Creighton T.E. Biochemstry. 1998; 37: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) reported more substantial noncovalent interactions between peptides with DsbC than with DsbA.In this report, we propose to show an even stronger chaperone activity of DsbC than that of PDI for protein folding in vitro with possibly different mechanisms for target protein binding.DISCUSSIONIn bacteria periplasm, DsbA and DsbC are the two soluble members of Dsb family directly involved in the formation of disulfide bonds. However, compared with eukaryotic PDI, the in vitroisomerase activity is about 30% for DsbC and only 5% for DsbA (23Zheng W.D. Quan H. Song J.L. Yang S.L. Wang C.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).It has been suggested that, in evolution, some enzymes acquired substrate binding ability in a chaperone-like mode to improve their catalytic efficiency, such as PDI, the ATP-dependent proteases, or trigger factors (19Wang C.C. Tsou C.L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 382-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). DsbA has been found to have chaperone activity in vitro (23Zheng W.D. Quan H. Song J.L. Yang S.L. Wang C.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and suggested to function as a chaperone in vivo (20Peek J.A. Taylor R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6210-6214Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 21Jacob-Dubuisson F. Pinkner J. Xu Z. Striker R. Padmanhaban A. Hultgren S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11552-11556Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Recently, the requirement for DsbA in pullulanase secretion has been reported to be unrelated to its ability to catalyze the formation of disulfide bond, but possibly because of its chaperone-like effect on folding of the enzyme and presentation of the secretion signal (33Sauvonnet N. Pugsley A.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The peptide binding site of DsbA has been identified by high resolution crystallography (22Guddat L.W. Bardwell J.C.A. Zander T. Martin J.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1148-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and secondary structure prediction of DsbC has suggested a similar structure to that of DsbA in that they both have an extra domain in addition to the thioredoxin-like domain (8Frishman D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies on DsbA- and DsbC-catalyzed reactions in simple unfolded peptides have revealed that the interaction between DsbC and its substrate appears to be more substantial than that between DsbA and the same peptide (24Darby N.J. Raina S. Creighton T.E. Biochemstry. 1998; 37: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The noncovalent peptide binding ability is a prerequisite for a protein to be a chaperone. The isomerase activity of DsbC is low, but as very few periplasmic and outer membrane proteins have more than two disulfides per subunit, hence high isomerase activity may not be needed (7Joly J. Swartz J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10067-10072Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The fact, that bacteria possess a large Dsb family composed of at least six members in periplasm (2Missiakas D. Raina S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2465-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 34Andersen C.L. Matthey-Dupraz A. Missiakas D. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) makes it possible for some Dsb proteins to function as chaperones and in this way to make up for the deficiency of molecular chaperones in this compartment.In this report, we presented evidence that DsbC indeed shows chaperone activity independent from its isomerase activity more pronounced than PDI in promoting the reactivation of denatured GAPDH and concurrently decreasing aggregation during its refolding. DsbC assists the reactivation of denatured and reduced lysozyme to a higher extent than PDI does even though it has only 30% of the disulfide isomerase activity of PDI, providing further support for the high chaperone activity of DsbC.It is likely that during refolding of denatured GAPDH, the denatured enzyme passes through several intermediates before either spontaneous reactivation or misfolding to form aggregates. The additive effect of DsbC and PDI on GAPDH reactivation suggests that DsbC and PDI may recognize different GAPDH folding intermediates, and interaction with each intermediate contributes to the overall reactivation of GAPDH. The effect of delayed addition of DsbC on GAPDH reactivation suggests that compared with PDI, DsbC may recognize earlier folding intermediates. The fact that DsbC, unlike PDI (12Puig A. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7764-7771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Song J.L. Quan H. Wang C.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), does not display anti-chaperone activity during lysozyme reactivation in HEPES buffer also suggests that DsbC and PDI bind with different intermediates, and this may contribute to the higher efficiency of DsbC in assisting the folding of some proteins as compared with PDI.It is surprising that relatively short peptides, including peptides with 10, 14, and 21 residues, inhibit neither the reductase activity of DsbC nor the assisted reactivation of GAPDH. It appears that the interactions of these peptides with DsbC are not strong enough to compete with the binding of the GAPDH folding intermediates. The fact, that sRNase does inhibit both the assisted reactivation of GAPDH and the PDOR activity of DsbC offers a further hint that DsbC has a large surface for peptide binding. It seems that DsbC has a somehow extended surface for peptide binding so that only a relatively large unfolded peptide is able to compete with the target folding intermediate for binding to DsbC. It was suggested by Darby et al. (24Darby N.J. Raina S. Creighton T.E. Biochemstry. 1998; 37: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) that DsbA binds an extended peptide chain as its substrate binding area is a long cleft and appears to be in a stereochemically restricted form, whereas the binding site of DsbC may favor the binding of a compact form of the peptide molecule. The peptide binding surface of PDI might be constructed by combining sites from several domains to form a large pocket (35Darby N.J. Penka E. Vincentelli R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and this could also be the case for DsbC. By kinetics comparison, Joly and Swartz (7Joly J. Swartz J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10067-10072Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) indicated that DsbC has a higher affinity for the misfolded insulin-like growth factor-1 substrate than PDI and DsbA. However, like the effect of native staphylococcal nuclease on the PDI-assisted GAPDH reactivation (29Quan H. Fan G.B. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17078-17080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), native RNase shows little effect on the DsbC-assisted GAPDH reactivation, indicating that DsbC and PDI do not interact with native structures. The details of the topological arrangement of the four domains in the dimeric DsbC and eight domains in dimeric PDI molecules, the peptide binding surface and its relation to the active sites, and the functional implications of such a modular structure can only be clarified by crystal structure analysis.Secondary structure prediction suggested DsbC to be composed of two domains, the C-terminal thioredoxin-like domain and the N-terminal mixed α/β domain of unknown structure (8Frishman D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Recent NMR determination of the PDI b domain shows that it also contains the thioredoxin motif, and PDI has thus been considered to consist of active and inactive thioredoxin modules (36Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 239-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In this respect, it is tempting to assume that, in homology to PDI, dimeric DsbC is composed of two active-site containing domains and two domains without the active site sequence. The multiple-domain structure of PDI has been demonstrated to be essential for its high catalytic efficiency and chaperone activity by increasing substrate binding interactions (35Darby N.J. Penka E. Vincentelli R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The PDI-like modular structure of DsbC might be the structural basis for its PDI-like dual activities. Disulfide bonds are important for conformational stability and biological activity of proteins and intimately involved in protein folding. The formation of disulfide bonds is now known to be catalyzed by protein disulfide isomerase (PDI)1 in endoplasmic reticulum for eukaryotes (1Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem.

DsbC is a homodimer with four thiol groups in each 23-kDa subunit, two in the active site -Cys98-Gly-Tyr-Cys101- and the other two at positions Cys141 and Cys163 (4Shevchik V.E. Condemine G.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2013-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). DsbC catalyzes the rearrangement of disulfide bonds in concert with DsbA for the formation of native disulfides and has been recognized as a counterpart of eukaryotic PDI (3Sone M. Akiyama Y. Ito K.

Secondary structure prediction of DsbC suggests that the molecule appears to consist of two domains (8Frishman D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Preliminary x-ray diffraction data of native and selenomethionine DsbC have been reported (9Rybin V. Zapun A. Torronen A. Raina S. Misssiakas D. Creighton T.E. Metcalf P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 1219-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Many in vitro and in vivo data have supported that as a foldase, PDI displays both isomerase and chaperone activities (10Wang C.C. Tsou C.L.

The chaperone activity of PDI greatly increases its efficiency as a foldase in promoting protein folding and in catalyzing the formation of native disulfide bonds (19Wang C.C. Tsou C.L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 382-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Most disulfide-bonded proteins in bacteria are located in the periplasm and the outer-membrane or are secreted to extracellular medium through the periplasm as their disulfide bonds can be formed readily in the oxidative periplasm but not in the reductive cytoplasm (2Missiakas D. Raina S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2465-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The bacterial periplasm is separated from the environment by only the permeable outer membrane and is therefore liable to be affected by environmental fluctuation. However, no classical molecular chaperone has been identified in the periplasm so far (2Missiakas D. Raina S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2465-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Hence, we are interested in examining whether DsbC, like its eukaryotic counterpart PDI, has chaperone activity to promote the formation of correct disulfide bonds during protein folding. In fact, DsbA has been suggested to function as a chaperone in the maturation of secreted virulence factors of Vibrio cholerae (20Peek J.A. Taylor R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6210-6214Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and in pilus biogenesis of Escherichia coli. (21Jacob-Dubuisson F. Pinkner J. Xu Z. Striker R. Padmanhaban A. Hultgren S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11552-11556Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The high-resolution crystal structure analysis of DsbA (22Guddat L.W. Bardwell J.C.A. Zander T. Martin J.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1148-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) has shown that an extensive uncharged surface surrounding the active-site disulfide is responsible for peptide binding. We have also presented evidence for the chaperone activity of DsbA in assisting the in vitro refolding ofd-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (23Zheng W.D. Quan H. Song J.L. Yang S.L. Wang C.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recently, Darby et al. (24Darby N.J. Raina S. Creighton T.E. Biochemstry. 1998; 37: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) reported more substantial noncovalent interactions between peptides with DsbC than with DsbA. In this report, we propose to show an even stronger chaperone activity of DsbC than that of PDI for protein folding in vitro with possibly different mechanisms for target protein binding. DISCUSSIONIn bacteria periplasm, DsbA and DsbC are the two soluble members of Dsb family directly involved in the formation of disulfide bonds. However, compared with eukaryotic PDI, the in vitroisomerase activity is about 30% for DsbC and only 5% for DsbA (23Zheng W.D. Quan H. Song J.L. Yang S.L. Wang C.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).It has been suggested that, in evolution, some enzymes acquired substrate binding ability in a chaperone-like mode to improve their catalytic efficiency, such as PDI, the ATP-dependent proteases, or trigger factors (19Wang C.C. Tsou C.L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 382-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). DsbA has been found to have chaperone activity in vitro (23Zheng W.D. Quan H. Song J.L. Yang S.L. Wang C.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and suggested to function as a chaperone in vivo (20Peek J.A. Taylor R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6210-6214Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 21Jacob-Dubuisson F. Pinkner J. Xu Z. Striker R. Padmanhaban A. Hultgren S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11552-11556Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Recently, the requirement for DsbA in pullulanase secretion has been reported to be unrelated to its ability to catalyze the formation of disulfide bond, but possibly because of its chaperone-like effect on folding of the enzyme and presentation of the secretion signal (33Sauvonnet N. Pugsley A.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The peptide binding site of DsbA has been identified by high resolution crystallography (22Guddat L.W. Bardwell J.C.A. Zander T. Martin J.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1148-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and secondary structure prediction of DsbC has suggested a similar structure to that of DsbA in that they both have an extra domain in addition to the thioredoxin-like domain (8Frishman D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies on DsbA- and DsbC-catalyzed reactions in simple unfolded peptides have revealed that the interaction between DsbC and its substrate appears to be more substantial than that between DsbA and the same peptide (24Darby N.J. Raina S. Creighton T.E. Biochemstry. 1998; 37: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The noncovalent peptide binding ability is a prerequisite for a protein to be a chaperone. The isomerase activity of DsbC is low, but as very few periplasmic and outer membrane proteins have more than two disulfides per subunit, hence high isomerase activity may not be needed (7Joly J. Swartz J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10067-10072Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The fact, that bacteria possess a large Dsb family composed of at least six members in periplasm (2Missiakas D. Raina S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2465-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 34Andersen C.L. Matthey-Dupraz A. Missiakas D. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) makes it possible for some Dsb proteins to function as chaperones and in this way to make up for the deficiency of molecular chaperones in this compartment.In this report, we presented evidence that DsbC indeed shows chaperone activity independent from its isomerase activity more pronounced than PDI in promoting the reactivation of denatured GAPDH and concurrently decreasing aggregation during its refolding. DsbC assists the reactivation of denatured and reduced lysozyme to a higher extent than PDI does even though it has only 30% of the disulfide isomerase activity of PDI, providing further support for the high chaperone activity of DsbC.It is likely that during refolding of denatured GAPDH, the denatured enzyme passes through several intermediates before either spontaneous reactivation or misfolding to form aggregates. The additive effect of DsbC and PDI on GAPDH reactivation suggests that DsbC and PDI may recognize different GAPDH folding intermediates, and interaction with each intermediate contributes to the overall reactivation of GAPDH. The effect of delayed addition of DsbC on GAPDH reactivation suggests that compared with PDI, DsbC may recognize earlier folding intermediates. The fact that DsbC, unlike PDI (12Puig A. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7764-7771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Song J.L. Quan H. Wang C.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), does not display anti-chaperone activity during lysozyme reactivation in HEPES buffer also suggests that DsbC and PDI bind with different intermediates, and this may contribute to the higher efficiency of DsbC in assisting the folding of some proteins as compared with PDI.It is surprising that relatively short peptides, including peptides with 10, 14, and 21 residues, inhibit neither the reductase activity of DsbC nor the assisted reactivation of GAPDH. It appears that the interactions of these peptides with DsbC are not strong enough to compete with the binding of the GAPDH folding intermediates. The fact, that sRNase does inhibit both the assisted reactivation of GAPDH and the PDOR activity of DsbC offers a further hint that DsbC has a large surface for peptide binding. It seems that DsbC has a somehow extended surface for peptide binding so that only a relatively large unfolded peptide is able to compete with the target folding intermediate for binding to DsbC. It was suggested by Darby et al. (24Darby N.J. Raina S. Creighton T.E. Biochemstry. 1998; 37: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) that DsbA binds an extended peptide chain as its substrate binding area is a long cleft and appears to be in a stereochemically restricted form, whereas the binding site of DsbC may favor the binding of a compact form of the peptide molecule. The peptide binding surface of PDI might be constructed by combining sites from several domains to form a large pocket (35Darby N.J. Penka E. Vincentelli R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and this could also be the case for DsbC. By kinetics comparison, Joly and Swartz (7Joly J. Swartz J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10067-10072Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) indicated that DsbC has a higher affinity for the misfolded insulin-like growth factor-1 substrate than PDI and DsbA. However, like the effect of native staphylococcal nuclease on the PDI-assisted GAPDH reactivation (29Quan H. Fan G.B. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17078-17080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), native RNase shows little effect on the DsbC-assisted GAPDH reactivation, indicating that DsbC and PDI do not interact with native structures. The details of the topological arrangement of the four domains in the dimeric DsbC and eight domains in dimeric PDI molecules, the peptide binding surface and its relation to the active sites, and the functional implications of such a modular structure can only be clarified by crystal structure analysis.Secondary structure prediction suggested DsbC to be composed of two domains, the C-terminal thioredoxin-like domain and the N-terminal mixed α/β domain of unknown structure (8Frishman D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Recent NMR determination of the PDI b domain shows that it also contains the thioredoxin motif, and PDI has thus been considered to consist of active and inactive thioredoxin modules (36Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 239-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In this respect, it is tempting to assume that, in homology to PDI, dimeric DsbC is composed of two active-site containing domains and two domains without the active site sequence. The multiple-domain structure of PDI has been demonstrated to be essential for its high catalytic efficiency and chaperone activity by increasing substrate binding interactions (35Darby N.J. Penka E. Vincentelli R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The PDI-like modular structure of DsbC might be the structural basis for its PDI-like dual activities. In bacteria periplasm, DsbA and DsbC are the two soluble members of Dsb family directly involved in the formation of disulfide bonds. However, compared with eukaryotic PDI, the in vitroisomerase activity is about 30% for DsbC and only 5% for DsbA (23Zheng W.D. Quan H. Song J.L. Yang S.L. Wang C.C. Arch. Biochem.

Northern blot analysis indicates that Gab2 is widely expressed and has an overlapping but distinctive expression pattern as compared with Gab1, with high levels of Gab2 mRNA detected in the heart, brain, placenta, spleen, ovary, peripheral blood leukocytes, and spinal cord. Upon tyrosine phosphorylation, Gab2 physically interacts with Shp2 tyrosine phosphatase and Grb2 adapter protein. Strikingly, Gab2 has an inhibitory effect on the activation of Elk-1-dependent transcription triggered by a dominant active Ras mutant (RasV12) or under growth factor stimulation, whereas Gab1 acts to potentiate slightly the Elk-1 activity in the same system. In contrast to the reciprocal effects of Gab1 and Gab2 in mediating Elk-1 induction, these two molecules have a similar function in extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation induced by either oncogenic Ras or growth factor stimulation. Taken together, these results argue that Gab1 and Gab2, two closely related PH-containing adapter proteins, might have distinct roles in coupling cytoplasmic-nuclear signal transduction.

These modules apparently mediate specific protein-protein or protein-lipid interactions and therefore orchestrate cellular responses to various extracellular stimuli. The PH domain was originally identified as a protein module of around 120 amino acids in a number of cytoplasmic signaling proteins that display homology to a region repeated in the protein pleckstrin (3Mayer B.J.

Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Structurally, Gab1 contains a PH domain at the N terminus and multiple tyrosyl residues at the C-terminal part, which presumably serve as docking sites for SH2-containing proteins in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent fashion. Overexpression of Gab1 stimulates cell growth and transformation (10Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Accumulating biochemical data suggest that Gab1 functions as a major adapter molecule downstream of receptors for nerve growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, epidermal growth factor, insulin, and B cell antigen (10Holgado-Madruga M.

Genetic screening for suppressor mutations of a dominant active Sevenless protein in Drosophila led to the identification of the daughter of sevenless gene that also encodes for a PH-containing molecule, structurally related to mammalian Gab1 (15Raabe T. Riesgo-Escovar J. Liu X. Bausenwein B.S. Deak P. Maroy P. Hafen E. Cell. 1996; 85: 911-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Interestingly, daughter of sevenless seems to be a putative substrate for Corkscrew, a tyrosine phosphatase with two SH2 domains (16Perkins L.A. Larsen I. Perrimon N. Cell. 1992; 70: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), because a catalytically inactive mutant of Corkscrew trapped the daughter of sevenless protein in its highly tyrosine-phosphorylated form (17Herbst R. Carroll P.M. Allard J.D. Schilling J. Raabe T. Simon M.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 899-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). It remains to be defined whether Gab1 is a physiological substrate of Shp2, the mammalian homologue of Corkscrew. However, it was demonstrated that Shp2 physically interacts with Gab1, and this interaction might play a critical role in transducing signals into the Ras pathway (10Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R.

In this paper, we report the identification of another Gab1-related molecule, designated as Gab2, that also contains a PH domain at the N terminus. Evidence is presented that although it acts to promote mitogenic stimulation of ERK kinase activity, Gab2 appears as a negative effector in the modulation of cytoplasmic signaling into the nucleus. These results allow us to make an intriguing proposal that a family of PH-containing adapter proteins functions in both negative and positive ways to control intracellular signaling cascades. A human cDNA clone was identified in the GenBankTM that shows high homology to the human Gab1 sequence (10Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). This sequence was deposited by the Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Chiba, Japan and named as KIAA 0571 (clone: HH2388). A 6052-base pair fragment inserted at theSalI-NotI sites of pBluescript II SK+was kindly supplied to us by Dr. T. Nagase. In a comparison with the Gab1 sequence, this cDNA clone seemed to be incomplete at the 5′-end. Accordingly, a Human Testis Marathon-ReadyTMcDNA kit (CLONTECH) was used to amplify the 5′-end cDNA segment of Gab2. Primers and PCR parameters were designed according to the manufacturer's manual. Briefly, a touch-down program (5 cycles: 94 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 2 min; 5 cycles: 94 °C, 1 min, 70 °C, 2 min; and 20–25 cycles: 94 °C, 1 min, 68 °C, 2 min) was used for all PCR reactions. The first round of PCR reaction was performed with primer AP1 from theCLONTECH kit and an antisense primer Z4 (5′-CAT GGA CTT GAC CAC TGA TCC CGT T-3′). The second round PCR used the primer AP1 and a nested antisense primer Z2 (5′-TGC TGA GCT CAG CTG GAG AAG AGC G-3′). The PCR product was then digested with SacI andNotI and cloned into Bluescript SK. All clones with inserts were sequenced either by Perkin Elmer/Applied Biosystems 377 XL DNA sequencer or by Thermo Sequenase Radiolabeled Terminator Cycle Sequencing System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A composite Gab2 cDNA was generated by recombining a SacI-SacI fragment from KIAA0571 (480–1913) with a 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends product, clone C32 of 447 base pairs, which extends 12 base pairs at the 5′-end from the initiation codon ATG, as determined from comparison with Gab1. To engineer an HA-tagged Gab2 expression construct, the composite Gab2 cDNA was used as a template for PCR with a pair of primers: Z13 (5′-CGG GGT ACC ATG TAT GAT GTT CCT GAT TAT GCT AGC CTC ATG AGC GGC GGC GGC GAC GTG G-3′) and Z11 (5′-TAG GTA CTG TCT CTG AAT TCT G-3′). The PCR product was digested withKpnI and EcoRI and cloned into pcDNA3.1+ viaKpnI and BamHI sites, together with theEcoRI-BamHI fragment of KIAA0571 we previously made. The full-length construct was sequenced to confirm that no error had been introduced by PCR reaction. The mammalian expression construct for HA-tagged Gab1 was a gift from Drs. M. Hibi and T. Hirano at Osaka University (18Takahashi-Tezuka M. Yoshida Y. Fukada T. Ohtani T. Yamanaka Y. Nishida K. Nakajima K. Hibi M. Hirano T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4109-4117Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), and GST-tagged ERK1 was kindly provided by Dr. B. Mayer. α-HA (12CA5) antibody was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, α-Shp2 and α-Grb2 antibodies and the mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY99) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The expression of Gab2mRNA in various tissues was determined by using a Human Multiple Tissue Northern blot system purchased from CLONTECHas described previously (19Feng G.S. Ouyang Y.B. Hu D.P. Shi Z.Q. Gentz R. Ni J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12129-12132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Northern blotting was performed with Expresshyb Hybridization Solution from CLONTECHfollowing the manufacturer's protocol. DNA probes for Gab2or β-actin were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Prime-It II kit from Stratagen. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Sub-confluent 293 cells in 60-mm culture dishes were transfected with DNA constructs by using the Calcium Phosphate Transfection System (Life Technologies, Inc.). A DNA fragment encoding amino acid residues 260–676 of Gab2 was cloned into pGEX4T-1 via theEcoRI site. Bacterially produced GST-Gab2 fusion protein was purified by glutathione-Sepharose beads. To produce specific antiserum, purified fusion protein was injected into female New Zealand rabbits, according to a standard protocol, at Cocalico Biologicals, Inc., Reamstown, PA. Ba/F3 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and mouse recombinant interleukin-3 (IL-3) (0.1 ng/ml, R & D Systems). Cells were washed with serum-free medium twice and starved in RPMI 1640 plus 0.8% bovine serum albumin for 8–10 h before being treated with IL-3 (1 ng/ml) for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (20Yu D.H. Qu C.K. Henegariu O. Lu X. Feng G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21125-21131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Lysates were centrifugated at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies at 4 °C for 2–4 h. Resulting immune complexes were incubated with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C for 1–2 h. Immune complex beads were washed three times in HNTG buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and the membrane was blocked in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20) plus 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) or 5% nonfat milk (Bio-Rad). Blots were incubated first with primary antibodies for 1.5 h, washed three times in TBST buffer, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. Proteins were detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cell lysates were prepared and GST-ERK1 was pulled down by incubation with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The in vitro ERK kinase assay was performed as described previously (21Shi Z.Q. Lu W. Feng G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4904-4908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The precipitated ERK1 was washed twice with HNTG buffer. The reaction was carried out in 20 μl of kinase buffer, 1 mg/ml myelin basic protein, 80 μmATP, 0.075 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 10 min. The beads were spun down; 18 μl of supernatant was spotted on Whatman P81 paper. The papers were washed with 180 mmphosphoric acid, rinsed briefly with 95% ethanol, air-dried, and counted on a Beckman scintillation counter. Human 293 cells in 60-mm dishes were co-transfected with Gal4-Elk, which has the C-terminal transactivation domain of Elk-1 fused with the DNA binding domain of Gal4, and 5xgal4-Luc, which has the luciferase reporter gene under the control of five tandem Gal4 binding sites (22Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar, 23Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). pCMV/β-galactosidase (10 ng) was also included as an internal co-transfection control to normalize luciferase reporter activity. Elk-1 activation was driven by 0.2 μg of Ha-RasV12 cloned in the pBabe-puro vector or epidermal growth factor (EGF) (50 ng/ml) stimulation (24Diaz B. Barnard D. Filson A. MacDonald S. King A. Marshall M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4509-4516Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). By searching the GenBankTM data base, we identified a human cDNA sequence (KIAA 0571) that shows a high homology to Gab1. However, this 6-kilobase cDNA fragment contains an open reading frame for a polypeptide consisting of 638 amino acid residues that seemed to lack a portion of the N-terminal part when compared with Gab1. By performing 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, we isolated a number of cDNA fragments that complement the missing part of Gab2 to different extents (Table I). Upon recombining one 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends product with the KIAA0571 sequence, we obtained a cDNA fragment that encodes a protein of 676 amino acid residues. Based on the deduced amino acid sequence, this protein is comprised of a PH domain at the N terminus and multiple potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites at the C-terminal part, without any known enzymatic domains. Therefore, the architecture of this molecule is closely related to human Gab1 andDrosophila daughter of sevenless (10Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J.

The high sequence homology and the similarity of molecular architecture between Gab1, Gab2, and daughter of sevenless strongly suggest that these proteins constitute a subfamily of signal transducers with a PH domain and multiple potential SH2 binding sites. The IRS family of proteins also contain a PTB domain, in addition to the PH domain and multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites (7Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 615-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 8Lavan B.E. Lane W.S. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21403-21407Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined, however, whether Gab1 and/or Gab2 are mammalian homologues ofDrosophila daughter of sevenless. Also conserved between Gab1 and Gab2 are the potential Tyr phosphorylation sites over the C-terminal part of the molecule that have consensus sequences for binding SH2 domains (25Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2381) Google Scholar). Notably, there are three YXXM motifs that are presumably involved in binding the p85 SH2 domains of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, the YXIP motif for phospholipase C-γ1, YDXP for Nck, and YLAL for Shp2. Like Gab1, Gab2 possesses two proline-rich motifs that are presumably engaged in binding SH3-containing proteins. Another striking feature that is shared by Gab1, Gab2, and IRS proteins is the enrichment of Ser and Thr residues. For example, there are 135 Ser/Thr residues in Gab1 and 143 in Gab2. This would raise an interesting possibility that these adapter proteins might function to integrate or coordinate signaling pathways between Ser/Thr, Tyr kinases, and/or phosphatases. To determine the expression pattern of the human Gab2 gene, we performed Northern blot analysis on various human tissues. As shown in Fig.2, Gab2 is widely expressed, with high levels detected in the heart, brain, placenta, spleen, ovary, peripheral blood leukocytes, and spinal cord. Compared with theGab1 expression pattern described previously (10Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), there is an overlap for the expression of Gab1 and Gab2genes in tissues, such as heart, brain, spinal cord and placenta. Distinct expression of Gab1 and Gab2 was also observed in several other tissues. For example, Gab1was highly expressed in the small intestine and colon where there were low levels of Gab2 mRNA detected. On the other hand,Gab1 expression was almost undetectable in peripheral blood cells, in which Gab2 was expressed at a high level. This differential expression pattern might reflect the participation of Gab1 and Gab2 in overlapping yet distinct signaling pathways in different cell types. To explore the Gab2 function in cell signaling, we generated a specific antibody against Gab2 by immunizing rabbits with a GST fusion protein containing the C-terminal part of Gab2. This antibody recognized a protein of around 85 kDa (Fig. 3). Gab2 became tyrosine-phosphorylated and associated with Shp2 tyrosine phosphatase and Grb2 adapter protein in Ba/F3 cells treated with IL-3, as detected by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3). We also examined the response to EGF of HA-Gab1 and HA-Gab2 exogenously expressed in human 293 cells. EGF treatment of cells for 10 min induced a significant increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 and Gab2 (data not shown). As demonstrated in Fig. 1 A, there are two proline-rich motifs in Gab2, which might be engaged in SH3-mediated protein interaction. To test this hypothesis, we performed an in vitro binding assay on the interaction of HA-Gab2 expressed in 293 cells with purified GST fusion proteins that contain individual SH3 domains. These were isolated from a number of signaling molecules, including Grb2, Grap, c-Abl, Crk, c-Src, RasGTPase-activating protein, and phospholipase Cγ, as well as full-length Nck. As shown in Fig.4, the SH3-C domain of Grb2 has the highest affinity to bind Gab2, whereas there were modest levels of binding for Gab2 with the Grb2 SH3-N, Grap SH3-N, c-Src SH3, phospholipase C-γ SH3, and Nck. This result suggests that Grb2 might be a main partner of Gab2 in a cell-signaling scheme that involves SH3 function. It is interesting to note that the binding of Grb2 to Gab2 is apparently different from the Grb2-Sos1 interaction, which is primarily mediated through the SH3-N domain of Grb2 (26Rozakis-Adcock M. Fernley R. Wade J. Pawson T. Bowtell D. Nature. 1993; 363: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar, 27Gale N.W. Kaplan S. Lowenstein E.J. Schlessinger J. Bar-Sagi D. Nature. 1993; 363: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 28Buday L. Downward J. Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Structural and biochemical analyses on Gab2 described above would suggest that this novel PH domain-containing protein might participate in the Ras signaling pathway, with similar function to Gab1. To test this hypothesis, we compared the effect of Gab1 and Gab2 on the Ras-mediated activation of Elk-1, by monitoring the luciferase activity under the control of Elk-1, a member of the ternary complex factors family. Human 293 cells were co-transfected with RasV12, Gab1 or Gab2, Gal4-Elk, and Gal4-Luc. Surprisingly, Gab1 and Gab2 had opposite effects in the modulation of RasV12-driven Elk-1 activity. Whereas Gab1 had a modest promoting effect on Elk-1-dependent transcription in response to the dominant active Ras, Gab2 exhibited a significant suppression of RasV12-induced Elk-1 activity under the same conditions (Fig.5 A). To further examine its inhibitory effect, we examined the Elk-1-driven luciferase activity under growth factor stimulation. Cells were co-transfected with Gal4-Elk and Gal4-Luc together with Gab1 or Gab2. After 8 h, cells were serum-starved for 12 h and treated with human recombinant EGF (50 ng/ml, Becton Dickinson) for 8 h. Consistently, Gab2, in contrast to Gab1, had a dramatic suppressing activity on Elk-1 function under EGF stimulation (Fig. 5 B). To determine the expression levels of HA-Gab1 and HA-Gab2 in 293 cells, total cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody, and similar protein amounts of Gab1 and Gab2 were detected (Fig. 5 C). Taken together, these results indicate that Gab2 acts to suppress Ras signaling into the nucleus in the modulation of Elk-1 transcription activity. The results described above raised a very interesting possibility that Gab1 and Gab2, two structurally related molecules, might have opposite effects in mediating the Ras signal that is presumably transmitted through ERK kinase into the nucleus. To dissect the molecular mechanism, we examined the influence of Gab1 and Gab2 on activation of the ERK kinase by RasV12. Cells were co-transfected with RasV12, HA-Gab1 or HA-Gab2, and GST-ERK1. After 48 h, GST-ERK1 was precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose beads from cell lysates, and ERK activity was measured in an in vitro kinase assay using myelin basic protein as a substrate. As shown in Fig.6 A, expression of RasV12 in 293 cells induced a significant increase in the ERK1 activity. This effect was slightly enhanced by co-transfection of either Gab1 or Gab2, suggesting that these two molecules have similar roles in mediating the Ras to ERK signaling. To corroborate this observation, we further compared the effect of Gab1 and Gab2 on EGF-induced ERK activation. As shown in Fig. 6 B, expression of Gab1 or Gab2 had a similar and modest enhancing effect on EGF-stimulated ERK1 activity. These results suggest that Gab1 and Gab2 act in the same fashion in the Ras-ERK signaling cascade activated by growth factor or oncogenic Ras. However, Gab2 apparently functions as a unique negative effector to modulate the signal output of the Ras-ERK pathway in the control of gene expression. We have described a novel adapter protein, Gab2, that contains a PH domain at the N terminus and shares the same molecular architecture as Gab1. Gab2 is widely expressed in many human tissues. We also demonstrate a physical interaction between Gab2 and Shp2, Grb2. The SH3-C domain of Grb2 has a high binding affinity toward Gab2. Gab2 has a positive effect similar to Gab1 in mediating the induction of ERK kinase activity by growth factor or oncogenic Ras. However, Gab2 appears to function in a unique way in Ras signaling by uncoupling Elk-1 activation from ERK kinase activity, in contrast to the positive role of Gab1 in the same pathway. Although the physiological function of Gab1 has not been fully understood, it apparently acts to promote cell growth and transformation. Overexpression of Gab1 leads to enhanced cell division and anchorage-independent cell growth in soft agar (10Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 and its association with Grb2 might also play an important role in cellular transformation by Tpr-Met, an oncoprotein consisting of the catalytic domain of hepatocyte growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase fused with sequences encoded by the tpr gene (13Fixman E.D. Holgado-Madruga M. Nguyen L. Kamikura D.M. Fournier T.M. Wong A.J. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20167-20172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A mutant Tpr-Met protein (Tyr489 → Phe) that fails to bind to Grb2 has significantly impaired transforming activity. Although it is unclear how Gab1 functions in cytoplasmic signaling, the molecular architecture of this protein strongly suggests that Gab1 is tyrosine phosphorylated at numerous sites and therefore is engaged in the formation of a complex that consists of many proteins, including phospholipase Cγ, Shp2, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. In this regard, Gab1 and Gab2 might work in cells in a similar manner as the family of insulin receptor substrates, IRS1–4, by coupling to multiple signaling pathways. However, the difference is the possession of a PTB domain following the PH domain in the IRS proteins, which is missing from Gab1 and Gab2. Without a PTB domain, Gab1/2 might interact with growth factor receptors indirectly via other SH2-containing molecules, such as Grb2. Gab1 and Gab2 share structural similarity with theDrosophila daughter of sevenless protein (15Raabe T. Riesgo-Escovar J. Liu X. Bausenwein B.S. Deak P. Maroy P. Hafen E. Cell. 1996; 85: 911-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Not only is daughter of sevenless physically associated with Corkscrew, but daughter of sevenless is the major phosphoprotein trapped by a catalytically inactive mutant of Corkscrew that was overexpressed in cells (17Herbst R. Carroll P.M. Allard J.D. Schilling J. Raabe T. Simon M.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 899-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Both Gab1 and Gab2 have been detected in association with Shp2, the mammalian homologue of Drosophila Corkscrew. Now the critical issue is to determine whether they are the physiological substrates of Shp2 and how this dephosphorylation event could contribute to the Ras signaling pathway. It is possible that these two molecules may serve as substrates of the ubiquitously expressed Shp2 phosphatase in different cell types. Further, these proteins may also be potential substrates of another Shp2-related phosphatase, Shp1, which is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells (29Feng G.S. Pawson T. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 54-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 30Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). The most striking finding in this report is the reciprocal effects of Gab1 and Gab2 in mediating Ras-responsive Elk-1 activation in cells. Gab2 does not seem to block the ERK kinase activation by either receptor tyrosine kinase or dominant active Ras, but rather it acts to uncouple signals from activated ERK to Elk-1, a member of ternary complex factors family. While this paper was under review, Gu et al. (31Gu H. Pratt J.C. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 729-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) reported the cloning of mouse p97/Gab2. Consistent with our data, transient expression of p97/Gab2 in Ba/F3 cells also lead to a suppression of IL-3-induced Elk-1 activity, whereas ERK1 kinase activation was not affected. This inhibitory effect of mouse Gab2 on IL-3-stimulated Elk-1 activity was exacerbated by the introduction of a C-terminal truncation mutation that abolished its binding to Shp2. A similar uncoupling effect on ERK kinase to Elk-1 stimulation was recently observed for the kinase suppressor of Ras (32Sugimoto T. Stewart S. Han M. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). When overexpressed, the kinase suppressor of Ras blocked EGF and the Ras induction of Elk-1-dependent transcription. Therefore, the Gab2 and kinase suppressor of Ras might represent components of a novel and poorly understood pathway that modulates the signal relay from the Ras-ERK kinase to the activation of nuclear ternary complex factors. Although the mechanism for its suppression on Elk-1 activation is to be understood, the Gab2 protein without any catalytic activities acts apparently by complexing with other enzymes, such as kinases and phosphatases, that contain SH2 and SH3 domains. Further investigation of the unique function of Gab2 will gain fundamental insight into the molecular mechanism by which the Ras-signaling scheme is concerted.

In this study, a molecular basis of the Btk co-localization with actin fibers is presented. Btk and other Tec family tyrosine kinases have a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain at their N termini. The PH domain is a short peptide module frequently found in signal-transducing proteins and cytoskeletal proteins. Filamentous actin (F-actin) is shown to be a novel ligand for a subset of PH domains, including that of Btk. The actin-binding site was mapped to a 10-residue region of the N-terminal region of Btk. Basic residues in this short stretch are demonstrated to be involved in actin binding. Isolated PH domains induced actin filament bundle formation. Consistent with these observations, Btk binds F-actinin vitro and in vivo. Wild-type Btk protein is in part translocated to the cytoskeleton upon FcεRI cross-linking, whereas Btk containing a mutated PH domain is not. Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated membrane translocation of Btk was enhanced in cytochalasind-pretreated, FcεRI-stimulated mast cells. These data indicate that PH domain-mediated F-actin binding plays a role in Btk co-localization with actin filaments.

Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2229) Google Scholar), Btk is composed of several functional domains as follows: pleckstrin homology (PH), Tec homology (TH), Src homology (SH) 3, SH2, and SH1 (=kinase) domains in this order from N to C termini. Unlike Src family PTKs, Btk lacks the N-terminal myristoylation site and the C-terminal negative regulatory tyrosine residue (corresponding to Tyr-527 in pp60c-src). Upon B cell receptor stimulation, Btk is recruited to the plasma membrane through the interaction between the PH domain and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) (5Li Z. Wahl M.I.

Then it is activated by phosphorylation at the activation loop (Tyr-551) by Lyn or Syk (8Rawlings D.J. Scharenberg A.M. Park H. Wahl M.I. Lin S. Kato R.M. Fluckiger A.-C. Witte O.N. Kinet J.-P.

Since the proline-rich sequence in the TH domain has the capacity to interact with the SH3 domains of Src family PTKs (11Cheng G. Ye Z.-S. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8152-8155Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), this interaction may be involved in Lyn phosphorylation of Btk. Btk regulates tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C (PLC)-γ2 (and probably PLC-γ1 as well) and the sustained phase of calcium response in B cells (6Scharenberg A.M. El-Hillal O. Fruman D.A.

The core of the compact domain structures shared by these PH domains is a β sandwich formed by two nearly orthogonal antiparallel β sheets of 4 and 3 strands, respectively. One corner of the β sandwich is capped by the C-terminal α-helix. Three classes of molecules have so far been shown to interact with these apparently multifunctional domains. First, studies by Lefkowitz and co-workers (28Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) established that the C-terminal portion and their flanking sequences of the PH domains of several proteins bind to the βγ complexes of heterotrimeric G-proteins. Second, several studies (26Hyvonen M. Macias M.J. Nilges M. Oschkinat H. Saraste M. Wilmanns M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4676-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 30Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J.

A. 1995; 92: 10472-10476Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) showed that various PH domains bind to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and related molecules through the positively charged residues in their N-terminal halves. Low affinity binding of PIP2 (K D = ∼30 μm(pleckstrin N-terminal PH domain) and 1.7 μm (PLC-δ1)) and Gβγ led to the hypothesis that PH domains function as membrane-localizing surfaces for PH domain-containing proteins. More recently, the Btk PH domain was shown to interact with PIP3(32Salim K. Bottomley M.J. Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I. Scaife R. Margolis R.L. Gigg R. Smith C.I.E. Driscoll P.C. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6241-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) and inositol polyphosphates (33Fukuda M. Kojima T. Kabayama H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30303-30306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Third, our previous studies (34Yao L. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9175-9179Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar,35Kawakami Y. Yao L. Tashiro M. Gibson S. Mills G.B. Kawakami T. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3556-3562PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that multiple isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC) interact with several PH domains, including that of Btk. Btk was shown to be phosphorylated and enzymatically down-regulated by PKC in vitro and in vivo. A subsequent mapping study revealed that the second and third β-strands of the Btk PH domain interact with the C1 regulatory region of PKC that encompasses the pseudosubstrate region and the diacylglycerol/phorbol ester-binding region (36Yao L. Suzuki H. Ozawa K. Deng J. Lehel C. Fukamachi H. Anderson W.B. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13033-13039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In the present study, we provide evidence that a subset of the tested PH domains including that of Btk bind to the filamentous form of actin (F-actin) but not the globular (or monomer) form of actin (G-actin). PH domains induce actin bundle formation in vitro. The actin-binding site was mapped within the N-terminal 10 residues of the Btk PH domain. As expected from the binding site mapping data, PIP2 competed with actin for binding to the PH domains, whereas neither PKC nor Gβγ competed with actin for the PH domain binding. Furthermore, the intact Btk molecule could interact with F-actin. Consistent with these in vitro data, a fraction of Btk was translocated from the cytosol to the cytoskeleton to co-localize with actin fibers upon FcεRI cross-linking. Monoclonal anti-actin antibodies were purchased from Sigma and Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Anti-Btk, anti-PKC(MC5), anti-PLC-γ2, and anti-Gβ antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (4G10) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Polyclonal anti-GST and mAb H902 against an epitope on the human immunodeficiency virus gp120 were gifts from W. Northemann (ELIAS Entwicklungslabor, Freiburg, Germany) and T. Mustelin (La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology), respectively. Pansorbin (Calbiochem), protein A-agarose (Sigma), or protein G-agarose (Sigma) were used for immunoprecipitation. Biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG and streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate were purchased fromBIOSOURCE International and Zymed Laboratories Inc., respectively. Rat brain PKC (Calbiochem) and phospholipids (all from Sigma) were used as competitors in in vitro binding assays. Rhodamine-phalloidin and wortmannin were also purchased from Sigma. Cytochalasin D was from Biomol. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were engineered by PCR-assisted cloning as described previously (34Yao L. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9175-9179Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Briefly, PCR was performed between a 5′ primer with a BamHI recognition sequence at the 5′ extension and a 3′ primer, corresponding to the N and C termini of individual PH domains, respectively, using cDNA clones. PCR products were cloned into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen), and the correct clone, confirmed by a limited sequence determination, was cloned into the pGEX-3T vector (37Frorath B. Abney C.C. Bertholt H. Scanarini M. Northemann W. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 558-563PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant PH domains were also engineered by PCR. Expression and purification of fusion proteins were carried out as described (38Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Wild-type GST fusion proteins used in this study were as follows: GST-BtkPH (coding for residues 1–139 of Btk), GST-EmtPH (residues 1–109), GST-PleNPH (residues 1–105), GST-PleCPH (residues 241–350), GST-OSBPPH (residues 93–190), GST-PLC-γ2PH (residues 476–527), GST-VavPH (residues 348–459), GST-AFAP-110CPH (residues 346–445), GST-SynCPH (residues 291–404), and GST-BtkSH3 (residues 216–274). In some experiments, the GST portion was removed from the oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) PH domain by digestion with thrombin (Sigma) followed by chromatography with benzamidine-Sepharose 6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In vitro solution binding was assayed as described (36Yao L. Suzuki H. Ozawa K. Deng J. Lehel C. Fukamachi H. Anderson W.B. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13033-13039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, glutathione-agarose-bound GST fusion proteins were incubated with MCP-5 murine mast cell lysates in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer in the presence or absence of competing molecules, and bound proteins, after extensive washes, were detected by immunoblotting with anti-actin, anti-PKC, or anti-Gβ antibodies. In some experiments, bound proteins were silver-stained using a kit from Bio-Rad. Filter binding was also done as described (34Yao L. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9175-9179Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted. Blots were incubated with purified rabbit skeletal muscle actin (obtained from Sigma or freshly prepared according to Spudich and Watt (39Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and bound actin was detected by probing with anti-actin. Freshly prepared G-actin was first polymerized in F buffer (G buffer (Ref. 52Tang J.X. Janmey P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8556-8563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) plus 100 mmKCl and 2 mm MgCl2) at room temperature for 20–30 min, incubated with GST fusion proteins or isolated PH domains for another 20 min, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. Both the supernatants and pellets recovered in SDS-PAGE sample buffer were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining or immunoblotting. Co-immunoprecipitation of Btk and actin. COS-7 cells were electroporated with 10 μg of the N-terminally epitope (H902)-tagged wild-type or kinase-dead (K430R) btk cDNA in the pME18S vector (40Yamada N. Kawakami Y. Kimura H. Fukamachi H. Baier G. Altman A. Kato T. Inagaki Y. Kawakami T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer 48 h after transfection. H902 mAb immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-actin. Actin polymerization was measured by changes in fluorescence of pyrene-labeled actin based on the 25-fold increase in fluorescence of actin monomers when they incorporate into filaments. Actin polymerization was initiated by the addition of 2 mm MgCl2 and 150 mm KCl to mixtures of 3 μm G-actin and various concentrations of PH domain proteins in buffer A (2 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.2 mmCaCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm ATP). The fluorescence intensity was measured with a Perkin-Elmer LS-50 instrument as a function of time using an excitation wavelength of 365 nm and measuring emission at 386 nm. The total light scattering intensity and the intensity of autocorrelation function of samples containing F-actin and various amounts of PH domains were measured using a Brookhaven Instruments BI30AT apparatus with a 128-channel autocorrelator. Samples were placed in a 6-mm inner diameter siliconized glass tube, and the autocorrelation function of quasielastically scattered light at 90° was determined by measurements of 5 min duration using a channel delay time of 10, 40, 160, and 640 μs in four sets of 321 channels to span the range of the delay. Samples containing 3 μmF-actin and either 0.8 μm OSBP PH domain or 0.8 μm GST in solutions containing 2 mmMgCl2, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.3 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm ATP were negatively stained and observed by electron microscope using standard techniques. Carbon-coated mica squares were floated on the samples, rinsed with the same solution lacking proteins, and stained with 2% uranyl acetate in H2O. Stained replicas were laid onto formic acid-washed carbon mesh grids, and the grids were observed in a JEOL electron microscope at 100 kV. RBL-2H3 rat mast cells were grown as a monolayer in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were sensitized with anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP) IgE and stimulated with DNP conjugates of bovine serum albumin for the indicated times. Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized, and incubated with anti-Btk followed by fluoresceinated anti-rabbit IgG as well as rhodamine-phalloidin. Stained cells were observed with a Bio-Rad MRC600 confocal laser scanning system. Bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) were cultured in an interleukin-3-containing medium and stimulated by FcεRI cross-linking with anti-DNP IgE and DNP-human serum albumin conjugates as described (42Kawakami T. Inagaki N. Takei M. Fukamachi H. Coggeshall K.M. Ishizaka K. Ishizaka T. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3513-3519PubMed Google Scholar). One percent Triton X-100 insoluble proteins recovered in SDS-PAGE sample buffer were analyzed by immunoblotting. Subcellular fractionation of mast cells into particulate (=membrane) and soluble compartments was carried out as described previously (43Kawakami Y. Yao L. Tsukada S. Witte O.N. Kawakami T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5108-5113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Non-tagged and human immunodeficiency virus gp120 epitope-tagged Btk proteins were expressed in Sf9 insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector, pVL1393, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Tagging was done by inserting into the NcoI site of the btk cDNA a double-stranded oligonucleotide, and the resulting Btk has a peptide Met-Ala-Arg-Ile-Gln-Arg-Gly-Pro-Gly-Arg-Ala-Phe-Val-Thr-Ile-Gly-Lys-Ser in front of the first codon. Btk proteins were partially purified by ion exchange chromatography with DEAE-Sepharose or Mono-Q (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or by affinity chromatography with H902 mAb immobilized onto Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad). FcεRI cross-linking induces dramatic cytoskeletal changes accompanied by increased F-actin content, membrane ruffling, increased cell adhesion and spreading, and the formation of actin-rich adhesion structures, termed actin plaques (44Pfeiffer J.R. Seagrave J.C. Davis B.H. Deanin G.G. Oliver J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2145-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In order to finely localize the Btk protein in mast cells undergoing these dynamic changes, RBL-2H3 rat mast cells were stained immunofluorescently with anti-Btk antibody, which gave a single Btk band in immunoblotting of RBL-2H3 cell lysates (Fig.1 A). Confocal microscopy revealed that Btk has a diffuse distribution in the cytoplasm in resting cells. However, upon FcεRI cross-linking, co-staining of F-actin with rhodamine-phalloidin showed that a portion of the Btk protein pool is co-localized with F-actin in a spacio-temporally specific manner. Thus, co-localization peaked 2–3 min after stimulation beneath the membrane ruffles on the dorsal surface of the cells and persisted for at least 10 min (Fig. 1 B). Actin plaques at the cell-substrate interface contained large amounts of actin but showed no co-localization with Btk (data not shown). The immunofluorescence results suggest that Btk may interact with actinin vivo. This possibility was further tested by immunoprecipitation from heterologous cells expressing Btk proteins. Actin was co-immunoprecipitated with anti-epitope antibody (H902) from lysates of COS-7 cells expressing epitope-tagged wild-type or kinase-dead (K430R) Btk (Fig. 2). These data suggest that actin interacts directly or indirectly with Btk and that the kinase activity of Btk is not required for this interaction. In order to find the molecular basis for the Btk-actin interaction, we examined whether individual domains of Btk and other proteins bind to actin. GST fusion proteins containing the PH domains of Btk or OSBP immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads were incubated with MCP-5 mast cell lysates. Proteins bound to these fusion proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained by silver (data not shown). The GST fusion protein of the OSBP PH domain (GST-OSBPPH) specifically bound a major protein of 43 kDa. The binding of the 43-kDa protein to GST-OSBPPH was resistant to a high salt (1.2 m NaCl) wash. The closeness of this protein in size prevented GST-BtkPH from being separated from the 43-kDa protein by SDS-PAGE. The identity of this protein as actin was demonstrated by immunoblotting of proteins bound to GST-BtkPH or GSTOSBPPH with anti-actin antibody (Fig. 3 A). GST-BtkPH bound slightly more actin than GST-OSBPPH in repeated experiments. In similar experiments using several other PH domains (Fig. 3 B), binding of GST-VavPH to actin was very weak, whereas GST-PLCγ2PH containing the N-terminal portion of the split PH domain of rat PLC-γ2 did not bind to actin. In contrast, GST, GST-BtkSH3, or GST-BtkSH2 did not bind actin in the same assay (Fig.3 B and data not shown). These results indicate that only a subset of PH domains bind to actin. Next, we tested whether the interaction between actin and PH domains is direct or not. Purified actin (>98% pure) was used in place of mast cell lysates in a co-immunoprecipitation experiment. When affinity purified GST or GST-OSBPPH released from glutathione-agarose beads was incubated with actin and precipitated with anti-GST antibodies and Pansorbin, actin was co-precipitated with GST-OSBPPH but not with GST (data not shown), suggesting that the interaction between actin and PH domains takes place without the involvement of other proteins. Another approach to demonstrate the direct interaction between PH domains and actin was used to test the actin-binding capacity of various PH domains. Affinity purified GST fusion proteins derived from various signaling proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Blots were incubated with actin, and bound actin was immunologically detected. In this filter binding assay (Fig. 3 C and the data summarized in Fig.4 B), actin binding capacities were observed with the PH domains from Btk, Emt, OSBP, and pleckstrin (both N- and C-terminal PH domains). However, PH domains derived from PLC-γ2, AFAP-110 (C-terminal PH domain), or syntrophin (C-terminal PH domain) did not bind to actin. The Vav PH domain had a weak binding capacity. The actin-binding site was mapped within the PH domain of Btk. Filter binding assays were performed using various truncated and mutated GST fusion proteins and the data summarized in Fig. 4 A. Since some actin-binding proteins interact with actin via their positively charged residues, mutants with substitutions of basic residues with alanine were tested. The results demonstrate that the amino acid sequence encompassing residues 11–20 is a minimal actin-binding stretch in which the basic residues play critical roles in the actin-PH domain interaction. The importance of the basic residues in this stretch is also reflected in the lack of actin binding capacity in the PH domains that lack the corresponding basic residues, e.g. those derived from PLC-γ2, AFAP-110, and syntrophin (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, we examined several mutant PH domains of PLC-γ2 in which basic residues were introduced within the first β sheet. As shown in Fig.4 C, the PLC-γ2 mutant PH domain with triple substitutions, T477K/M483K/W484K, was positive for actin binding, whereas the other mutants with single substitutions at position 477 or 483 or with double substitutions at positions 483 and 484 failed to show any actin binding capacity. The creation of a gain-of-function mutant with the PLC-γ2 PH domain further underscores the involvement of the basic residues in binding to actin. The above data did not specify or exclude either the monomeric G-actin or the polymerized F-actin as the PH domain ligand. Therefore, we took two approaches to determine which form of actin binds PH domains. Co-sedimentation experiments were carried out on a mixture of freshly purified actin and either GST, GST-OSBPPH, or GST-BtkPH(1/76) in F buffer. Affinity purified PH domain fusion proteins specifically co-sedimented with F-actin, whereas negligible amounts of these proteins co-sedimented with bovine serum albumin (Fig.5 A). In accordance with thein vitro binding results (Fig. 3), GST-BtkPH(1/76) co-sedimented with F-actin more efficiently than GST-OSBPPH, whereas GST did not. Purified OSBPPH and BtkPH-(1/76) proteins that were released from GST by thrombin digestion also co-sedimented with F-actin (data not shown). In another type of experiment, mixtures of actin with either GST or GST-PH fusion proteins in G buffer were analyzed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. None of the GST-PH proteins made complexes with G-actin (data not shown). Binding characteristics of PH domain with F-actin were analyzed using GST-OSBPPH. Co-sedimentation experiments were done on a fixed amount of freshly purified actin and increasing concentrations of GST-OSBPPH. When saturating amounts of GST-OSBPPH were bound to F-actin, the binding stoichiometry was one molecule of GST-OSBPPH to 5 molecules of actin (Fig. 5 B, upper). Scatchard analysis of bound and unbound GST-OSBPPH proteins showed that the dissociation constantK D for this interaction was ∼2 μm(Fig. 5 B, lower). Although similar analysis on GST-BtkPH was hampered by limited yields of soluble protein released from glutathione beads, the affinity of GST-BtkPH would be higher than that of GST-OSBPPH given the better in vitro binding results. These characteristics are similar to those of some actin-binding proteins (45Pollard T.D. Kreis T. Vale R. Guidebook to the Cytoskeletal and Motor Proteins. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 3-11Google Scholar). Since the PKC-, PIP2-, and inositol polyphosphate-binding sites were also mapped within the N-terminal portion of PH domains (26Hyvonen M.

https://openalex.org/W2017795729,"Induction of apoptosis in HL-60 cells, using a variety of cytotoxic drugs, resulted, in all cases, in inhibition of CDP-choline:1,2-diacylglycerol choline phosphotransferase, leading to an accumulation of its substrate, CDP-choline, and inhibition of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. Incubation of the cells with phosphatidylcholine reduced the number displaying an apoptotic morphology following drug treatment, and this was inversely related to the degree to which the drugs inhibited phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. Inhibition of choline phosphotransferase by two of the drugs, farnesol and chelerythrine, was shown to be due to direct inhibition of the enzyme, while inhibition by the other drugs, etoposide and camptothecin, could be explained by the intracellular acidification that followed induction of apoptosis.

Kerr J.F.R. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6683) Google Scholar, 2Raff M.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (2486) Google Scholar). Execution of the apoptotic program leads to a morphologically distinct form of cell death characterized typically by cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation, and the formation of apoptotic bodies. The latter can be phagocytosed in vivo in a process that does not incite the inflammation that normally accompanies cellular necrosis (3Savill J.S. Wyllie A.H. Henson J.E. Walport M.J. Henson P.M. Haslett C. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar). Apoptosis occurs in tissues during development, as a result of normal cell turnover and in the removal of damaged cells. Deregulation of the process has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases including cancer and AIDS (4Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6162) Google Scholar). The apoptotic program can be initiated by a variety of stimuli, for example by binding of tumor necrosis factor to its receptor (5Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) or by withdrawal of factors required for cell proliferation, such as growth factors, cytokines and hormones (6Collins M.K.L. Lopez Rivas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 307-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition the process can be induced by a wide range of cytotoxic drugs, many of which are used in cancer therapy (7Williams G.T. Cell. 1991; 65: 1097-1098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). We used 31P NMR spectroscopic methods recently to investigate the effects of apoptosis-inducing drugs on the metabolism of two mammalian cell lines in culture (8Williams S.N.O. Anthony M.L. Brindle K.M. Magn. Reson. Med. 1998; 40: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Since these agents have different cellular targets, it was anticipated that metabolic changes common to all of the agents might provide markers for apoptosis, which would allow the noninvasive detection of the processin vivo using 31P NMR, e.g. in a tumor following chemotherapy. All of the agents investigated caused an accumulation of CDP-choline, suggesting that there was inhibition of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho)1biosynthesis, via inhibition of the enzyme CDP-choline:1,2-diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase (CPT; EC2.7.8.2). PtdCho is the most abundant phospholipid in mammalian cells and is synthesized mainly through the CDP-choline pathway (9Kent C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 315-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). This pathway has been implicated as being important in the control of cell proliferation and cell death (10Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3858-3867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20219-20222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and its selective inhibition has been shown to be sufficient to induce apoptosis (12Cui Z. Houweling M. Chen M.H. Record M. Chap H. Vance D.E. Terce F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14668-14671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 13Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2169-2173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We show here that the drugs used previously to induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells (8Williams S.N.O. Anthony M.L. Brindle K.M. Magn. Reson. Med. 1998; 40: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and which caused an accumulation of CDP-choline, do indeed inhibit CPT and, as a result, PtdCho biosynthesis. Inhibition of CPT by two of the drugs, farnesol and chelerythrine, could be explained by their direct inhibition of the enzyme. Inhibition of CPT by farnesol has been observed previously (14Voziyan P.A. Goldner C.M. Melnykovych G. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and was shown recently to be due to binding of the drug to the enzyme (15Miquel K. Pradines A. Terce F. Selmi S. Favre G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26179-26186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the enzyme by chelerythrine, however, was unexpected, since the drug has been widely used as a potent and selective inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC). A recent study, however, failed to observe inhibition of PKC by chelerythrine and suggested that the reported effects of the drug should be considered as being independent of PKC inhibition (16Lee S.K. Qing W.G. Mar W. Luyengi L. Mehtra R.G. Kawanishi K. Fong H.H.S. Beecher C.W.W. Kinghorn A.D. Pezzuto J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19829-19833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The results presented here suggest that at least some of the biological effects of chelerythrine might be explained by its inhibition of CPT and consequent inhibition of PtdCho biosynthesis. Inhibition of CPT by the other two drugs, etoposide and camptothecin, is shown to be explicable by the cellular acidification that follows the onset of the apoptotic program. Since acidification is a common feature of the program, we examined the possibility that the resultant inhibition of PtdCho biosynthesis could be a component of the execution phase of the apoptotic program. Consistent with this suggestion was the observation that addition of exogenous PtdCho provided protection, at least partially, against the appearance of the morphological features of apoptosis. Ammonia, chloroform, ethanol, formaldehyde, hydrochloric acid, methanol, and liquid scintillation fluid (Hi-Safe) were obtained from Fisher Scientific UK (Loughborough, United Kingdom). [methyl-3H]Choline chloride (specific activity 83 Ci·mmol−1) and cytidine 5′-diphosphate [methyl-14C]choline (specific activity 55 mCi·mmol−1) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Little Chalfont, UK). Carboxy-SNARF-1-AM was obtained from Cambridge Biosciences (Cambridge, UK) and bisindolylmaleimide I was from Alexis Corp. (UK) Ltd. (Nottingham, UK). Tissue culture materials, culture medium, and medium supplements were supplied by Life Technologies, Inc. (Paisley, UK). All other chemicals were from Sigma (Poole, UK). Thin-layer plates were obtained from Camlab (Cambridge, UK). All chemicals were reagent grade or better. HL-60 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 g·l−1 glucose supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units·ml−1 penicillin, and 100 μg·ml−1streptomycin. The cells were grown in spinner flasks (Techne, Cambridge, UK) with continuous stirring at 37 °C, in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air. Cells were seeded at a density of 2–3 × 105 cells·ml−1 and used when in logarithmic growth. Cell number and viability were established by erythrosin B dye exclusion and counting on a hemocytometer slide. Apoptosis was initiated by incubating cells with 15 μm camptothecin, 10 μm chelerythrine, 40 μm etoposide, or 60 μm farnesol, for various time intervals. Me2SO was used as the solvent vehicle for all the agents with the exception of camptothecin and chelerythrine (water). Me2SO did not exceed 0.5% v/v of the culture medium, a concentration that did not affect cell growth or viability. Confirmation and quantification of apoptosis was determined by fluorescence microscopy. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in 1% formaldehyde (in phosphate-buffered saline) prior to staining with acridine orange at a final concentration of 5 μg·ml−1 (17Lennon S.V. Kilfeather S.A. Hallett M.B. Campbell A.K. Cotter T.G. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1992; 87: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Stained cells were observed using a Zeiss Axiovert 100TV microscope, and those that showed condensed or fragmented nuclei were scored as apoptotic. Cells from spinner flasks were seeded at a density of 3 × 105·ml−1 in RPMI 1640 medium and incubated for 24 h in T flasks. They were then harvested by centrifugation and resuspended at a density of 1 × 106cells·ml−1 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with [methyl-3H]choline chloride (2 μCi·ml−1). An apoptosis-inducing agent was added and the cells harvested, at various time intervals, by centrifugation followed by two washes in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cellular lipids were separated from aqueous metabolites using a modified Bligh-Dyer procedure (18Suidan H.S. Tolkovsky A.M. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1190-1201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The radioactivity associated with the lipid fraction was measured over a 5-min period in a Beckman LS-2800 liquid scintillation counter. Water-soluble choline metabolites were separated by chromatography on silica gel G-coated thin-layer plates using the solvent H2O/ethanol/NH3 (95:48:7, v/v/v), essentially as described in Ref. 19Walkey C.J. Kalmar G.B. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5742-5749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The positions of the labeled metabolites on the plates were determined by adding an excess of the unlabeled compounds to the extract. CDP-choline was visualized by illumination with uv light (254 nm), with the remaining PtdCho precursors revealed following their exposure to iodine vapor. Approximate R F values in this system were CDP-choline, 0.7; phosphocholine, 0.6; and choline, 0.1. Sections of silica gel containing the choline metabolites were wetted in 0.5 ml of 0.5 m hydrochloric acid and scraped into scintillant. The radioactivity released into the scintillant after 24 h was determined as described above. Samples of approximately 6 × 106cells were removed from incubations with the apoptosis-inducing agents, centrifuged, and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5. The cells were loaded with carboxy-SNARF-1-AM by incubation with 10 μm dye for a further 30 min at 37 °C and then resuspended in fresh HEPES buffered RPMI 1640 medium. Flow cytometry was performed on a Coulter EPICS Elite flow cytometer with excitation at 488 nm and fluorescence detection at 575 and 635 nm, as described in Ref. 20Ishaque A. Singh R.P. Al-Rubeai M. Genetic Eng. Biotechnol. 1997; 17: 85-88Google Scholar. Measurements of forward and side light scatter were made simultaneously in order to confirm the occurrence of apoptosis. Debris were excluded by electronic gating based upon light scatter profiles. The enzyme assay was based on protocols described in Refs. 14Voziyan P.A. Goldner C.M. Melnykovych G. Biochem.

Cells were washed three times with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Earle's salts and then resuspended in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μm pepstatin A. After homogenization in a Dounce homogenizer, cell debris was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 × g. The pellet, containing the microsomal fraction, was resuspended in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and stored on ice prior to enzyme assay. The assay system contained 175 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 8 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm diacylglycerol, 0.1 mm cytidine 5-diphospho[methyl-14C]choline and up to 15 μg of protein in a final volume of 140 μl. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the microsomal preparation and was continued for up to 10 min at 37 °C and terminated by the addition of an equal volume of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). Radioactivity in the chloroform/methanol phase was measured by scintillation counting. Incorporation of label into the phospholipid fraction was shown to be linear with time under these conditions. Statistical analysis was performed, where appropriate, using Student's t test for unpaired samples. Apoptosis was induced in HL-60 cells using a variety of cytotoxic agents. Camptothecin and etoposide are inhibitors of DNA topoisomerases I and II, respectively (24Gong J.P. Li X. Darzynkiewicz Z. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 25Yoshida A. Ueda T. Takauji R. Liu Y.P. Fukushima T. Inuzuka M. Nakamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 927-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and chelerythrine has been used as a specific inhibitor of PKC (26Jarvis W.D. Turner A.J. Povirk L.F. Traylor R.S. Grant S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1707-1714PubMed Google Scholar). Farnesol has been shown to inhibit PtdCho biosynthesis, by decreasing CPT activity (14Voziyan P.A. Goldner C.M. Melnykovych G. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A more recent study showed that the drug is an inhibitor of the enzyme and that drug binding is competitive with diacylglycerol (15Miquel K. Pradines A. Terce F. Selmi S. Favre G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26179-26186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Incubation of HL-60 cells with farnesol, chelerythrine, camptothecin, and etoposide was shown previously, by31P NMR, to result in the accumulation of CDP-choline (8Williams S.N.O. Anthony M.L. Brindle K.M. Magn. Reson. Med. 1998; 40: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), implying that the induction of apoptosis by these compounds had resulted in inhibition of PtdCho biosynthesis. PtdCho biosynthesis was investigated in this study by measuring the incorporation of label from [methyl-3H]choline into the water-soluble intermediates of the CDP-choline pathway and into the phospholipid fraction. Chromatographic separation of the phospholipids showed that the majority of the label was incorporated into PtdCho (data not shown). Farnesol inhibited label incorporation into PtdCho (Fig.1), increased labeling of CDP-choline and the cellular uptake of choline, and had little effect on labeling of phosphocholine, when compared with control cells (Fig.2). These results are similar to those found previously in other cell lines and are consistent with inhibition of PtdCho biosynthesis via inhibition of CPT (14Voziyan P.A. Goldner C.M. Melnykovych G. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Miquel K. Pradines A. Terce F. Selmi S. Favre G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26179-26186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Camptothecin produced a less marked but nevertheless significant inhibition of label incorporation into PtdCho, increased labeling of CDP-choline and uptake of choline, and decreased labeling of phosphocholine. These data are again consistent with inhibition of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis via inhibition of CPT and with previous 31P NMR data showing an increase in CDP-choline concentration and decrease in phosphocholine concentration following treatment with this drug (8Williams S.N.O. Anthony M.L. Brindle K.M. Magn. Reson. Med. 1998; 40: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The temporal relationship between CDP-choline formation and the induction of apoptosis by camptothecin was further investigated by prelabeling the cells for 24 h with [methyl-3H]choline prior to drug treatment. The increase in CDP-choline concentration (Fig.3 A) coincided with an increase in the number of cells displaying an apoptotic morphology, as determined from fluorescence microscopy measurements of nuclear condensation (Fig. 3 B). Etoposide produced a much smaller decrease in PtdCho labeling, but this was significantly less than in control cells after 6 h of drug treatment (Fig. 1). There was a significant increase in CDP-choline labeling and cellular uptake of labeled choline but no change in the labeling of phosphocholine (Fig.2). In conjunction with the earlier 31P NMR data (8Williams S.N.O. Anthony M.L. Brindle K.M. Magn. Reson. Med. 1998; 40: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which showed an increase in the concentration of CDP-choline following drug treatment, these results again indicate inhibition of PtdCho biosynthesis via inhibition of CPT. Chelerythrine, unlike the other drugs, markedly reduced the cellular uptake of labeled choline. However despite this decrease there was a marked increase in label incorporation into CDP-choline, compared with controls, which was consistent with the increased CDP-choline concentration observed previously by 31P NMR (8Williams S.N.O. Anthony M.L. Brindle K.M. Magn. Reson. Med. 1998; 40: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and indicates again that there is inhibition of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis via inhibition of CPT. The decreased labeling of phosphocholine can be explained by the reduced cellular uptake of label and by a decrease in phosphocholine biosynthesis, as the earlier 31P NMR study showed a decrease in the concentration of this metabolite following treatment with this drug.Figure 2Effect of inducing apoptosis on labeling of cellular CDP-choline, phosphocholine, and choline.

We also observed inhibition of CPT activity when farnesol or chelerythrine were added to a microsomal preparation of HL-60 cells (Table I), although the inhibition by farnesol was greater than that observed previously. The inhibition by chelerythrine increased with drug concentration and with the time of preincubation of the drug with the microsomal fraction. However the inhibition appeared not to be due to an indirect effect of PKC inhibition as none was observed with bisindolylmaleimide I, which is a potent and selective inhibitor of PKC (27Toullec D.

Therefore direct inhibition of CPT activity could explain the accumulation of CDP-choline and inhibition of PtdCho biosynthesis observed here with farnesol and chelerythrine but not that observed with camptothecin and etoposide.Table IEffect of apoptosis-inducing agents on CPT activity in a microsomal preparationCompoundConcentrationPreincubation time of drug with microsomal preparationCPT activityμmmin% of controlCamptothecin1530122Etoposide4030118Farnesol603025.7Chelerythrine10090.8101075.9353033.8Bisindolylmaleimide I0.5097.00.51094.2CPT activity was measured in a microsomal fraction prepared from HL-60 cells, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results shown are the mean of two values, which differed from each other by less than 10%. Open table in a new tab CPT activity was measured in a microsomal fraction prepared from HL-60 cells, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results shown are the mean of two values, which differed from each other by less than 10%. Intracellular acidification is a relatively early and common feature of the apoptotic program (28Barry M.A. Eastman A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Acta. 1984; 779: 217-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), this suggested a possible mechanism whereby camptothecin and etoposide might inhibit PtdCho biosynthesis. The number of acidotic cells, following the induction of apoptosis, was determined by loading the cells subsequently with the pH-sensitive dye carboxy-SNARF-1-AM. The intracellular pH in individual cells was determined using ratiometric flow cytometry. Intracellular pH was assessed by excitation at 488 nm, and the fluorescence emission was monitored at 575 nm and 635 nm (20Ishaque A. Singh R.P. Al-Rubeai M. Genetic Eng. Biotechnol. 1997; 17: 85-88Google Scholar). In Fig.4 the intracellular pH for each individual cell is expressed as the ratio of 575:635 nm fluorescence. Untreated cell populations exhibited a relatively narrow range of ratios indicating a homogeneous population of cells with respect to internal pH (Fig. 4 A). This peak shifted to a lower ratio, indicating cellular acidification, following treatment with an apoptosis-inducing agent (Fig. 4 B). The development of this acidic cell population was time-dependent and preceded the appearance of the morphological features of apoptosis (Figs. 1 and 3), the inhibition of PtdCho biosynthesis (Fig. 1) and the accumulation of CDP-choline (Fig. 2). In order to confirm that cellular acidification could explain the inhibition of PtdCho biosynthesis and the accumulation of CDP-choline observed with camptothecin and etoposide, we manipulated intracellular pH by varying extracellular pH in the presence of the K+/H+ exchanger, nigericin. The results are shown in Fig. 5. Incubation of cells in a low pH medium containing nigericin, conditions that are known to rapidly lower intracellular pH (34Park H.J. Makepeace C.M. Lyons J.C. Song C.W. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 32A: 540-546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), resulted in the accumulation of CDP-choline and inhibition of PtdCho biosynthesis. Lowering intracellular pH can itself induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells (34Park H.J. Makepeace C.M. Lyons J.C. Song C.W. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 32A: 540-546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); however, the number of cells displaying an apoptotic morphology during the 4-h incubation in this low pH medium were in the control range (<10%). By 7 h, however, 27% of the cells exhibited an apoptotic morphology. Selective inhibition of PtdCho biosynthesis has been shown to induce apoptosis (12Cui Z. Houweling M. Chen M.H. Record M. Chap H.

Induction of apoptosis by farnesol, for example, was shown to be inhibited by the addition of PtdCho to the culture medium (35Haug J.S. Goldner C.M. Yazlovitskaya E.M. Voyizan P.A. Melnykovych G.

This protection was also observed in this study, where the addition of 100 μm PtdCho to the medium produced an 80% decrease in the number of cells displaying an apoptotic morphology following treatment with this drug (TableII). This protection was also observed with the other drugs used in this study, the degree of protection showing an inverse correlation, albeit a loose one, with the extent to which the drugs inhibited PtdCho biosynthesis. Thus the protection was greater with cells treated with farnesol or chelerythrine, which produced the greatest inhibition of PtdCho biosynthesis, than with cells treated with camptothecin or etoposide, where the inhibition of PtdCho synthesis was more modest (Table II). Furthermore this protection was specific for PtdCho, as was observed previously (35Haug J.S. Goldner C.M. Yazlovitskaya E.M. Voyizan P.A. Melnykovych G. Biochim. Biophys.

The ability of Par-4 to promote apoptotic cell death is dependent on the binding and inactivation of the atypical protein kinases C (PKCs). This subfamily of kinases has been reported to control nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) through the regulation of the IκB kinase activity. NF-κB activation by tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) provides a survival signal that impairs the TNFα-induced apoptotic response. We show here that expression of Par-4 inhibits the TNFα-induced nuclear translocation of p65 as well as the κB-dependent promoter activity. Interestingly, Par-4 expression blocks inhibitory κB protein (IκB) kinase activity, which leads to the inhibition of IκB phosphorylation and degradation, in a manner that is dependent on its ability to inhibit λ/ιPKC. Of potential functional relevance, the expression of Par-4 allows TNFα to induce apoptosis in NIH-3T3 cells. In addition, the down-regulation of Par-4 levels by oncogenic Ras sensitizes cells to TNFα-induced NF-κB activation. Par-4 is a novel protein identified in cells undergoing apoptosis.

In this regard, the aPKCs selectively bind to, and are inhibited by, Par-4, which was initially identified by differential screening in cells that were undergoing apoptosis (3Berra E. Municio M.M.

In addition, recent studies show that the expression of Par-4 sensitizes prostate cancer and melanoma cells to apoptotic stimuli (27Sells S.F. Han S-S. Muthukkumar S. Maddiwar N. Johnstone R.

Therefore, the study of the mechanisms of action of Par-4 and the atypical PKCs may be of great importance for the understanding of the signaling events involved in programmed cell death.Because the atypical PKCs regulate ERK (see above) and this kinase has been shown to be important in cell survival (3Berra E.

Therefore, it is conceivable that the impairment of the NF-κB pathway through the inhibition of the atypical PKCs may contribute to the pro-apoptotic actions of Par-4. TNFα, although it shares some components of the Fas signaling cascade, is an interesting example of the activation by a single cytokine of two different pathways with opposite effects. Thus, TNFα triggers the caspase-8 route to apoptosis and simultaneously activates NF-κB, which is an important survival signal (for a recent review, see Ref. 29Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5112) Google Scholar, and references therein). Therefore, TNFα induces apoptosis if the NF-κB pathway is inactivated (18Beg A.A. Baltimore D.

Recently, two IκB kinases (IKKα and IKKβ) have been identified that phosphorylate residues 32 and 36 of IκBα, and whose activity is potently stimulated by TNF and IL-1 (36DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M.

Results from this laboratory demonstrated that the atypical PKCs are critical regulators of the IKK activity, which offers a mechanistic explanation to the proposed role of these PKCs on NF-κB activation (41Lallena M.J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Bren G. Payá C.V. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2180-2188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The studies reported here address the possibility that Par-4 potentiates TNF-induced apoptosis by inhibiting NF-κB through the blockade of the aPKC-IKK signaling cascade.DISCUSSIONThe molecules involved in signaling events controlling cell death and survival are important targets for novel therapies in cancer and inflammatory diseases. The recent discovery that the product ofpar-4, a gene induced in cells undergoing apoptosis (26Sells S.F. Wood D.P. Joshi-Barve S.S. Muthukumar S. Jacob R.J. Crist S.A. Humphreys S. Rangnekar V.M. Cell Growth & Diff. 1994; 5: 457-466PubMed Google Scholar), binds to and inhibits the atypical subfamily of PKCs (3Berra E. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Frutos S. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1996; 16: 105-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggests that these kinases play important roles in the control of cell survival. Actually, the overexpression of wild-type ζPKC or λ/ιPKC (3Berra E. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Frutos S. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4346-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 6Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 16: 105-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) protects cells from apoptosis induced by different genotoxic and stress insults. Therefore, the investigation of the mechanisms whereby the atypical PKCs regulate cell function is of potential great interest. In this regard, the ability of the atypical PKCs to regulate ERK (3Berra E. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Frutos S. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4346-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 46Berra E. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10792-10797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) seems important from the point of view of programmed cell death because the basal ERK activity has been shown to be critical for cell survival at least in some cell systems (22Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (5027) Google Scholar, 47Canman C.E. Kastan M.B. Nature. 1996; 384: 213-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Therefore, one of the mechanisms whereby the inhibition of the atypical PKCs by Par-4 induces apoptosis could at least in part involve the reduction of the ERK activity (3Berra E. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Frutos S. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4346-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 46Berra E. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10792-10797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). This pathway is antagonized by serum survival factors acting through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt cascade (46Berra E. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10792-10797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), unveiling an interesting cross-talk between different signaling events, which explains why Par-4 induces apoptosis more efficiently in cell cultures maintained under low serum conditions.There are other apoptotic pathways that are activated in a more direct way such as those of the Fas system (46Berra E. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10792-10797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Briefly, Fas binds to the adapter molecule FADD, which interacts with caspase-8 (also known as FLICE/MACH) triggering the whole caspase cascade (46Berra E. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10792-10797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Apoptosis induced by TNFα, although it shares some components of the Fas signaling cascade, is an interesting example of the activation by a single cytokine of two different pathways with opposite effects (30Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4581) Google Scholar, 31Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5542) Google Scholar, 32Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). Thus, TNFα triggers the caspase-8 route to apoptosis and simultaneously activates NF-κB through independent although highly interconnected elements (29Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5112) Google Scholar). NF-κB is an important survival signal, and TNFα induces apoptosis if the NF-κB pathway is inactivated (30Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4581) Google Scholar, 31Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev.

Because the atypical PKCs contribute to the activation of NF-κB by regulating the IKK enzymatic activity, in the study reported here, we sought to investigate if Par-4 may provide a signal that inactivates NF-κB, allowing TNFα to induce apoptosis. We show in this study that expression of Par-4 blocks NF-κB and IKK activation in a manner that is dependent on the inhibition of the atypical PKCs. These are very interesting observations because they provide independent evidence, other than those obtained with dominant negative mutants (11Sontag E. Sontag J.M. Garcia A. EMBO.

Virol. 1996; 70: 223-231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), that the atypical PKCs are critically involved in the control of NF-κB and IKK activation (41Lallena M.J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Bren G. Payá C.V. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2180-2188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also of potential functional relevance is our finding that expression of Par-4, which by itself is a relatively weak inducer of apoptosis in the presence of high serum concentrations, allows TNFα to promote cell death, most probably by inhibiting NF-κB. Collectively, these results set an scenario in which the inhibition of the atypical PKCs by Par-4 induces apoptosis in resting cells by reducing ERK activity if the serum/phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt system is simultaneously inactivated (46Berra E. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10792-10797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). However, if the induction of apoptosis is an active process, as in the case of TNFα signaling, Par-4 contributes to cell death by inactivating the stimulation of the NF-κB survival branch. This suggests that potential inhibitors of the atypical PKCs could be used as sensitizers in cancer therapy. How NF-κB promotes cell survival is a matter of recent interest. Thus, Baldwin and co-workers (48Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the induction of TRAF1, TRAF2, cIAP1, and cIAP2 may account for the anti-apoptotic effects of TNFα signaling. In addition, other molecules such as IEX-1L (49Wu M.X. Ao Z. Prasad K.V. Wu R. Schlossman S.F. Science. 1998; 281: 998-1001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have also been demonstrated to mediate NF-κB-induced protection. Future work in our laboratory will address the impact that Par-4 and the atypical PKCs have on the expression of these survival genes.A critical question that arises from this study is the pathophysiological implications of these findings. We have evidence that tumor transformation by the Ras oncogene provokes a profound depletion of Par-4 mRNA and protein levels (see above). This may be of potential functional relevance from the point of view of tumor progression because it may constitute a mechanism whereby cancer cells are able to survive and proliferate more efficiently than the normal cells. We demonstrate here that the down-regulation of Par-4 by oncogenic Ras has a measurable impact on TNFα signaling toward NF-κB activation. Thus, cells expressing oncogenic Ras display a much more efficient nuclear translocation of p65 in response to TNFα than control cells. This also seems to be dependent on the down-regulation of Par-4, because its ectopic expression dramatically inhibits Ras synergistic actions on NF-κB. Together, all these results will be in good agreement with a role of Par-4 during tumorigenic transformation. In this regard, recent data from Rangnekar and co-workers (50Cook J. Krishnan S. Ananth S. Sells S.F. Shi Y. Walther M.M. Linehan W.M. Sukhatme V.P. Weinstein M.H. Rangnekar V.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1205-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) demonstrate the complete depletion of Par-4 in renal cell carcinoma. Of potential interest, these authors presented evidence that the ectopic expression of Par-4 in cell lines derived from those tumors sensitizes them to TNFα-induced apoptosis. This is clearly in keeping with the data reported in this paper and with the observations that down-regulation of NF-κB severely impairs Ras-induced transformation (51Mayo M.W. Wang C.Y. Cogswell P.C. Rogers-Graham K.S. Lowe S.W. Der C.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1997; 278: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Therefore, Par-4 emerges a novel tumor suppressor gene acting on the aPKCs-IKK signaling axis. The atypical protein kinase C (PKC)1 subfamily of isozymes (aPKCs) has recently been the focus of considerable attention. It is composed of two members, ζPKC and λ/ιPKC (1Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2353) Google Scholar), which appear to be involved in a number of important cellular functions including cell proliferation and survival (2Berra E.

We therefore examined the activation (GTP loading) of Ras by the following hypertrophic agonists: phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), endothelin-1 (ET-1), and phenylephrine (PE). All three increased Ras·GTP loading by 10–15-fold (maximal in 1–2 min), as did bradykinin. Other G protein-coupled receptor agonists (e.g. angiotensin II, carbachol, isoproterenol) were less effective. Activation of Ras by PMA, ET-1, or PE was reduced by inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC), and that induced by ET-1 or PE was partly sensitive to pertussis toxin. 8-(4-Chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (CPT-cAMP) did not inhibit Ras·GTP loading by PMA, ET-1, or PE. The association of Ras with c-Raf protein was increased by PMA, ET-1, or PE, and this was inhibited by CPT-cAMP. However, only PMA and ET-1 increased Ras-associated mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1-activating activity, and this was decreased by PKC inhibition, pertussis toxin, and CPT-cAMP. PMA caused the rapid appearance of phosphorylated (activated) extracellular signal-regulated kinase in the nucleus, which was inhibited by a microinjected neutralizing anti-Ras antibody.

By increasing its GTP loading in a regulated manner, Ras acts as a “molecular switch” and transmits signals from a variety of cell surface receptors to downstream effector proteins. The best characterized effector is c-Raf, one of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)1 kinase kinases of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade. Ras·GTP (but not Ras·GDP) has a high affinity for c-Raf, causing it to translocate to the membrane (reviewed in Ref. 2Daum G. Eisenmann-Tappe I. Fries H.-W. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Trends Biochem.

These include phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase, other small G proteins, the Ral-GDS family, and other protein kinases (reviewed in Ref. 1Vojtek A.B. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19925-19928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Ras is converted back to its inactive state by its innate GTPase activity, which may be enhanced by GTPase-activating proteins. In the terminally differentiated, cell cycle-arrested ventricular myocyte (in contrast to transformed cell lines and other dividing cells), G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists such as endothelin-1 (ET-1), bradykinin (BK), and α1-adrenergic agonists promote a stronger activation of the ERK cascade members (c-Raf/A-Raf, MAPK kinase 1/2 (MKK1/2), and ERK1/ERK2) than peptide growth factors (6Bogoyevitch M.A. Glennon P.E.

This activation is mediated at least in part through the Gq/G11 group of GPCRs (recently also demonstrated in vivo (10Akhter S.A. Luttrell L.M. Rockman H.A. Iaccarino G. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J.

Thus, phorbol esters such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) also powerfully activate the ERK cascade in myocytes (6Bogoyevitch M.A. Glennon P.E. Andersson M.B. Clerk A. Lazou A. Marshall C.J.

In terms of biology, ET-1, α1-adrenergic agonists such as phenylephrine (PE), and phorbol esters cause myocytes to hypertrophy, a response that manifests itself with increases in myocyte size, increased myofibrillogenesis, and alterations in gene and protein expression (reviewed in Refs. 13Chien K.R. Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar and 14Sugden P.H. Clerk A. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 725-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Myocyte hypertrophy is important in pathophysiological conditions in vivo, since it allows the heart to maintain or increase its contractile power following partial loss of viable myocytes (as occurs following myocardial infarction) or when faced with a demand for increased pressure-volume work. There is evidence that GPCR- and Gαq-mediated activation of Ras and the ERK cascade brings about at least some of these changes (reviewed in Ref. 14Sugden P.H. Clerk A. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 725-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Although regulation of Ras activity has been examined extensively in cell lines, relatively little is known about this topic in primary cells (such as the ventricular myocyte). In this study, we have used a nonradioactive method (15Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 16de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) to assess the activation of Ras by PMA and GPCR agonists in myocytes. We have examined the stimulation of the association between Ras·GTP and c-Raf and show that Ras is essential for the PMA-stimulated phosphorylation of ERKs. These results are relevant to the understanding of myocyte hypertrophy and of GPCR-linked signaling pathways generally. Mouse monoclonal antibodies to pan-Ras (catalog no.

PMA (prepared as a 1 mm stock in Me2SO) and other agonists, pertussis toxin (PTX), 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (CPT-cAMP), and Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide) were from Sigma. Myelin basic protein was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). General laboratory reagents were from Sigma or Merck. Myocytes were prepared from the ventricles of neonatal Harlan Sprague Dawley rat hearts by an adaptation of the method of Iwaki et al. (22Iwaki K. Sukhatme V.P. Shubeita H.E. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13809-13817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (23Bogoyevitch M.A. Clerk A. Sugden P.H. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The cells were preplated to remove fibroblasts. For measurement of Ras·GTP loading and Ras-Raf association etc., myocytes were plated at a density of 1.4 × 103 cells/mm2 onto 60-mm gelatin-coated dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/medium 199 (4:1, v/v) containing 10% (v/v) horse serum, 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. After 18 h, the cells were confluent and beating. The cells were incubated for 24 h in 4 ml of serum-free medium and before exposure to agonists. For immunofluorescence and microinjection experiments, cells were plated in 60-mm dishes at a density of 700 cells/mm2. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10 or 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose as described earlier (24Bogoyevitch M.A. Parker P.J. Sugden P.H. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat milk powder in 20 mmNaH2PO4, 80 mmNa2HPO4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (pH 7.5) (PBST) for 30 min, and the blots were incubated with Ras or c-Raf antibodies (1:1000 dilution in blocking solution, overnight, 4 °C). For monoclonal antibodies, the blots were washed with PBST (three times for 5 min, room temperature), incubated with a polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution in PBST containing 1% (w/v) nonfat milk powder, 1 h, room temperature) and then washed again in PBST (three times for 5 min, room temperature). Blots were then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit IgG tertiary antibody (1:5000 dilution in PBST containing 1% (w/v) nonfat milk powder, 1 h, room temperature), and, after washing in PBST (three times for 5 min, room temperature), bands were detected using ECL with exposure to Hyperfilm MP. When polyclonal rabbit antibodies were used, the rabbit anti-mouse antibody was omitted. Blots were quantified by laser scanning densitometry. The assay was performed essentially as described by de Rooij and Bos (16de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Ventricular myocytes were exposed to agonists in serum-free medium. The medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and extracted by scraping into 300 μl of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaF, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 2 μm microcystin, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mm leupeptin, 0.01 mm trans-epoxy succinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane, 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were centrifuged (10,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), and the supernatants were assayed for protein by the Bradford method (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). Supernatants (equalized for protein) were incubated with mixing at 4 °C for 2 h with GST-RBD that had been previously bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads resuspended in Buffer A. Beads were washed four times with 1 ml of buffer A and boiled with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer (0.33 m Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 10% (w/v) SDS, 13% (v/v) glycerol, 133 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg/ml bromphenol blue). The eluted proteins were resolved on 12% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Ras was visualized with the monoclonal pan-Ras antibody (1:1000). In some cases, membranes were probed with antibodies to Ha-Ras or N-Ras (1:1000). Ras was immunoprecipitated from 2 mg of supernatant protein with 10 μg of Y13–238 antibody prebound to protein G-Sepharose beads by rocking at 4 °C for 2 h. Myocyte supernatants were prepared as for the Ras·GTP loading assays described above (four dishes pooled). The beads were washed four times in 1 ml of buffer A, and immunocomplexes were immunoblotted for c-Raf or Ras. Immunoprecipitated Ras was assayed for associated MKK1 activating activity using a coupled assay with GST-MKK1, GST-ERK2, and myelin basic protein in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (7Bogoyevitch M.A. Marshall C.J. Sugden P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26303-26310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The protein G-Sepharose beads were washed four times with buffer B (30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 20 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaF, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 1 μmmicrocystin, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.3% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol). Immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 20 μl of buffer B containing unlabeled 0.16 mm ATP, 6.5 μg/ml GST-MKK1, and 100 μg/ml GST-ERK2. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with intermittent mixing and were stopped by 20 μl of 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm NaF, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 1 μm microcystin, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.3% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm EGTA and then were cooled on ice. Supernatants were mixed with 40 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EGTA, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mg/ml myelin basic protein, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After 15 min at 30 °C, the reactions were terminated by spotting 40 μl of the reaction mixture onto P81 papers, and the papers were washed four times in 75 mmH3PO4. Radioactivity was counted by Cerenkov counting. Radioactivity incorporated into myelin basic protein in the absence of Y13–238 was similar to blanks performed in the absence of extract. After incubation with agonists and washing three times in ice-cold PBS, myocytes were extracted by scraping into ice-cold 10 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mmNaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl (pH 6.8). Extracts were centrifuged (10,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), and the supernatants were assayed for cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) by phosphorylation of 50 μm Kemptide in the absence or presence of 2 μm cAMP as described previously (26Bogoyevitch M.A. Fuller S.J. Sugden P.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H1247-H1257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Results were expressed as activity ratios (activity in the absence of cAMP relative to that in the presence of 2 μm cAMP). Myocytes in serum-containing medium were microinjected (150–200 cells in marked areas of the dishes) intracytoplasmically at 24 h after plating with anti-Ras (Y13–259) (6 mg/ml in PBS) or normal rat IgG (6 mg/ml in PBS) (27Graessmann M. Graessmann A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 482-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). After 20 h, the cells were placed in 4 ml of serum-free medium. After a further 9 h, PMA in Me2SO was added to a final concentration of 1 μm. An equivalent volume of Me2SO was added to the control (0.1% (v/v) final concentration). At 4 min, cells were rinsed in PBS and fixed for 15 min in 4% formaldehyde in PBS at room temperature. All washes and dilutions were performed in PBS. Fixed cells were washed for 30 min and permeabilized in 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 10 min, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were incubated with mouse phospho-ERK antibody (1:50 dilution, 2 h, 37 °C) and washed for 30 min. Cells were incubated (1 h, 37 °C) with a mixture of fluorescein isothiocyanate-anti-mouse IgG (1:250 dilution) to reveal phospho-ERKs and Texas Red-conjugated anti-rat IgG (1:250 dilution) to reveal microinjected rat IgG. Following a final 30-min wash, areas of dishes containing microinjected cells were mounted in Moviol aqueous mountant (28Heimer G.V. Taylor C.E. J. Clin. Pathol. 1974; 27: 254-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) under glass coverslips. In immunohistochemical experiments that did not involve microinjection, the Texas Red anti-IgG was omitted. Immunofluorescence analysis was performed using a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal imaging system in conjunction with a Nikon Eclipse 600 fluorescence microscope. Using concentrations of agonists that we have shown elsewhere to be maximally effective in activating the ERK cascade, we examined the stimulation of Ras·GTP loading by PMA, ET-1, and PE using the pan-Ras antibody (Fig. 1). Small amounts of Ras·GTP were detected in control myocytes. PMA (1 μm) induced a rapid 12–15-fold increase in Ras·GTP loading, which was maximal within 1–2 min and was sustained for at least 10 min (Fig. 1, A, top panel, andB). Both ET-1 (100 nm) and PE (100 μm) stimulated Ras·GTP loading by approximately 12- and 10-fold, respectively, with a similar time course to PMA (Fig. 1,A, center panels, and B). Although Ras·GTP loading declined subsequently, it remained above control values for at least 10 min (Fig. 1, A, center panels, and B). In all cases, we confirmed that the total amounts of Ras in myocyte extracts before affinity precipitation were similar, and a typical result for a PMA time course is shown in Fig. 1 A, bottom panel. There was no change in Ras·GTP loading with time in cells not exposed to agonists (results not shown). We next examined whether there were differences in GTP loading of Ras isoforms by probing with antibodies selective for N-Ras and Ha-Ras. Both isoforms were activated in myocytes exposed to PMA, ET-1, or PE for 1 min (Fig. 1 C). We also attempted to determine GTP loading of K-Ras. Although some experiments indicated that the stimulation of K-Ras·GTP loading by PE was less than that with PMA or ET-1, the results were equivocal (results not shown). Numerous agonists (epinephrine, norepinephrine, isoproterenol, angiotensin II (ANGII), carbachol (CCH), BK, fibroblast growth factors) activate ERKs to varying degrees in myocytes (6Bogoyevitch M.A. Glennon P.E.

Res. 1985; 56: 884-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar)), whereas others (e.g. CCH and BK) are much less so (8Clerk A. Gillespie-Brown J. Fuller S.J. Sugden P.H. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar,33Post G.R. Goldstein D. Thuerauf D.J. Glembotski C.C. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8452-8457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We examined the stimulation of Ras·GTP loading at 1 min by a variety of GPCR agonists and by acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF). This time point was chosen because Ras·GTP was maximal at 1–3 min for PMA, ET-1, and PE (Fig. 1 B), as it was for aFGF, ANGII, and isoproterenol (results not shown). All agonists tested increased Ras·GTP loading, although the extent of stimulation differed (Fig.2). Activation of Ras·GTP loading by PE was 77 ± 9% of the level achieved by ET-1 (the most potent agonist), whereas activation by other catecholamines such as epinephrine or norepinephrine was 65 ± 13 or 60 ± 14%, respectively (Fig. 2). BK was also very effective, stimulating Ras to 85 ± 12%, whereas that for aFGF was 50 ± 13% (all relative to ET-1). The poorest activators were isoproterenol, ANGII, and CCH, with a relative potency of 35–45% (Fig. 2). PMA pretreatment (1 μm for 24 h) essentially completely down-regulates the “classical” and “novel” PKCs (cPKCs and nPKCs) present in ventricular myocytes (34Clerk A. Bogoyevitch M.A. Fuller S.J. Lazou A. Parker P.J. Sugden P.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: H1087-H1097PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition of the stimulation of Ras·GTP loading by PMA, ET-1, or PE in PMA-pretreated cells was 75–90% (Table I). However, interpretation of the data is complicated by the fact that PMA pretreatment increased basal Ras·GTP loading by about 4-fold (Fig.3 A). We have encountered a similar problem when examining activation of c-Raf in myocytes (7Bogoyevitch M.A. Marshall C.J. Sugden P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26303-26310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Despite this problem, the stimulation of Ras·GTP loading elicited by acute exposure of PMA-pretreated myocytes to agonists was always less than that in myocytes that had not been pretreated (Fig.3 A). These data suggest that cPKCs/nPKCs are involved in the stimulation of Ras·GTP loading by PMA, ET-1, and PE. We also assessed the effects of the PKC-selective inhibitors GF109203X and Ro318220. Both had minimal effects on basal Ras·GTP loading (results not shown). Although GF109203X inhibited agonist-stimulated Ras·GTP loading by 45–55%, Ro318220 significantly inhibited only PMA-stimulated Ras·GTP loading (Table I). Stimulation of Ras·GTP loading by ET-1 or PE was decreased by 70–80% by 150 ng/ml PTX (TableI), suggesting that Gi/Go proteins are involved in addition to PKC. Although PMA-stimulated Ras·GTP loading was decreased by PTX (Table I), this result did not attain statistical significance (p > 0.02). In a second series of experiments, we examined the effects of PKC inhibition and PTX on aFGF-induced Ras·GTP loading (Fig. 3 B and Table I). In contrast to Fig. 3 A, the stimulation of Ras·GTP loading elicited by acute exposure of PMA-pretreated myocytes to aFGF was always greater than that in myocytes exposed to aFGF alone (Fig.3 B), and any inhibition (after subtraction of the appropriate controls) was relatively slight (Table I). GF109203X inhibited aFGF-induced Ras·GTP loading (Table I), but this could reflect inhibition of the “atypical” PKC species that are not down-regulated by PMA (34Clerk A. Bogoyevitch M.A. Fuller S.J. Lazou A. Parker P.J. Sugden P.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: H1087-H1097PubMed Google Scholar).

Ras was immunoprecipitated (antibody Y13–238) from myocytes exposed to PMA, ET-1, or PE and was immunoblotted for associated c-Raf (Fig.4). Activation of Ras resulted in the formation of Ras·c-Raf complexes following stimulation by all agonists. We also attempted to determine whether A-Raf, the other Raf isoform detectable in ventricular myocytes by immunoblotting (7Bogoyevitch M.A. Marshall C.J. Sugden P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26303-26310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), associated with Ras·GTP. We were not able to demonstrate an association, but, in the absence of a suitable positive control, these results are equivocal. c-Raf, A-Raf, and B-Raf (and possibly other MAPK kinase kinases) activate MKK1. Ras immunoprecipitates (antibody Y13–238) from myocytes exposed to PMA or ET-1 clearly contained a MKK1 activating activity (Fig. 5), for which c-Raf is likely to be at least partly responsible (Fig. 4). The stimulation of MKK1 activating activity (about 10-fold) was maximal within 1 min and was sustained for at least 3 min (Fig. 5). Only small amounts of MKK1 activating activity could be detected in Ras immunoprecipitates from PE-treated myocytes (Fig. 5), although PE clearly increased Ras·GTP loading to a degree comparable with that with PMA or ET-1 (Figs. 1 and2), and also promoted association of Ras and c-Raf (Fig. 4). PMA pretreatment for 24 h essentially abolished the activation of Ras-associated MKK1 activating activity by 1 μm PMA or 100 nm ET-1 (Fig. 6). PMA pretreatment did not significantly affect t"

This indicated that part of the α4 receptors containing [3H]muscimol binding sites did not contain [3H]Ro15–4513 binding sites.

Pharmacol. Rev. 1995; 47: 181-234PubMed Google Scholar). These receptors are thought to be composed of five subunits (2Nayeem N. Green T.P. Martin I.L. Barnard E.A. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 3Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). So far, 6α, 4β, 3γ, one δ, one ε, one π, and 3ρ subunits of GABAA receptors have been cloned and sequenced (1Sieghart W. Pharmacol. Rev. 1995; 47: 181-234PubMed Google Scholar, 4Barnard E.A.

Recombinant receptor studies have indicated that α, β, and γ subunits are required to produce receptors with pharmacological properties resembling most native GABAA receptors. δ, ε, and π subunits seem to be able to replace γ subunits in triple subunit combinations, whereas ρ subunits seem to combine only with each other and represent a separate class of GABAAreceptors (4Barnard E.A.

Depending on their subunit composition, GABAA receptors have different pharmacological and electrophysiological properties (1Sieghart W. Pharmacol. Rev. 1995; 47: 181-234PubMed Google Scholar). The subunit diversity results in a very large number of potential subunit combinations and, thus, in a large number of possible GABAA receptor subtypes. Presently, the subunit composition and stoichiometry of not a single native GABAA receptor subtype has been unequivocally established. GABAA receptors containing α4subunits are expressed in several rat brain regions (5Laurie D.J. Seeburg P.H. Wisden W. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1063-1076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Persohn E. Malherbe P. Richards J.G. J. Comp. Neurol. 1992; 326: 193-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 7Wisden W. Laurie D.J. Monyer H. Seeburg P.H. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1040-1062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and have quite special pharmacological properties. These receptors exhibit a high affinity for the imidazobenzodiazepines Ro15–4513 or bretazenil but no affinity for diazepam and other classical benzodiazepines and, thus, resemble GABAA receptors containing α6subunits, which are predominantly expressed in granule cells of the cerebellum (1Sieghart W. Pharmacol. Rev. 1995; 47: 181-234PubMed Google Scholar). Several attempts have been made to investigate the subunit composition of native GABAA receptors containing α4subunits (8Kern W. Sieghart W. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 764-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 9Khan Z.U. Gutiérrez A. Mehta A.K. Miralles C.P. De Blas A.L.

For this, antibodies were generated that were able to specifically identify the α4 subunit protein in Western blots and to immunoprecipitate GABAA receptors containing this subunit. Results obtained indicated that in addition to α4 subunits, α1, α2, α3, β2/3, and γ2 subunits could be copurified using these antibodies (8Kern W. Sieghart W. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 764-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 9Khan Z.U. Gutiérrez A. Mehta A.K. Miralles C.P. De Blas A.L.

A copurification of other subunits so far could not be demonstrated, because suitable antibodies were lacking. The relative abundance of GABAA receptors containing α4 subunits was estimated by different investigators. Whereas Benke et al. (10Benke D. Michel C. Möhler H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 806-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) demonstrate that these receptors were present in various brain areas at comparatively low abundance (3–6% of all receptors in the respective brain area) and exhibit virtually identical patterns of distribution, Khan et al.(9Khan Z.U. Gutiérrez A. Mehta A.K. Miralles C.P. De Blas A.L. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) were able to immunoprecipitate 10–28% of the GABAAreceptors in various brain regions. Similar discrepancies were noted during investigation of the binding properties of the precipitated receptors. The α4subunit-specific antibodies of Benke et al. (10Benke D. Michel C. Möhler H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 806-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) precipitated [3H]muscimol as well as diazepam-insensitive [3H]Ro15–4513 binding sites in all tissues investigated. The α4 subunit-specific antibodies of Khan et al. (9Khan Z.U. Gutiérrez A. Mehta A.K. Miralles C.P. De Blas A.L. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), however, predominantly precipitated [3H]muscimol binding sites but little or no diazepam-insensitive [3H]Ro15–4513 binding sites in any brain region. To clarify these discrepancies, a novel polyclonal antibody directed against an α4 subunit-specific amino acid sequence was used to specifically precipitate α4 subunit containing GABAA receptors. Interestingly, there was a large difference in the percentage of [3H]muscimol and [3H]Ro15–4513 binding sites precipitated by this antibody from brain membrane extracts. A subsequent investigation of the subunit composition of GABAA receptors containing α4 subunits clarified this discrepancy and indicated that a significant part of these receptors contained neither γ nor δ subunits.

Polyclonal anti-peptide α4(379–421) antibodies were raised against a maltose-binding protein-α4(379–421)-7His fusion protein and were purified by affinity chromatography on a column containing the corresponding glutathioneS-transferase-α4(379–421)-7His fusion protein (18Ebert V. Scholze P. Sieghart W. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 1323-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Transformed human embryonic kidney 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, CRL 1573) were grown and transfected with rat α1, α4, β3, or γ2 subunit cDNAs as described (14Slany A. Zezula J. Tretter V. Sieghart W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 385-391PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ebert V. Scholze P. Sieghart W.

Pharmacol. 1995; 289: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Membranes from the brain (without cerebellum) of adult rats or membranes from human embryonic kidney 293 cells transfected with various GABAAreceptor subunit cDNAs were extracted with a deoxycholate buffer containing 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.05% phosphatidylcholine, 10 mm Tris-chloride pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm benzamidine, 100 μg/ml bacitracin, and 300 μm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. Treatment with this deoxycholate buffer resulted in a recovery of 76% of receptors present in the membranes, indicating that 24% of receptors became denatured by this procedure. 89% of the recovered receptors were found in the soluble extract, whereas 11% remained in the 100,000 ×g pellet. Thus, 68% of the [3H]Ro15–4513 or [3H]muscimol binding sites present in the membranes could be solubilized. Because there was no significant difference in the efficiency of solubilization by detergent between [3H]muscimol binding sites or diazepam-sensitive or -insensitive [3H]Ro15–4513 binding sites, it can be concluded that the extracted receptors were representative of the entire functional GABAA receptor population. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described (13Jechlinger M. Pelz R. Tretter V. Klausberger T. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2449-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 300 μl of the clear deoxycholate membrane extract were mixed with 30 μl of antibody solution (0–20 μg of antibody), and the mixture was incubated under gentle shaking at 4 °C overnight. Then 50 μl of immunoprecipitin (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) plus 150 μl of an immunoprecipitation-low buffer containing 5% dry milk powder were added, and incubation was continued for 2 h at 4 °C. The precipitate was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 ×g, and the pellet was washed twice with 500 μl of immunoprecipitation-high and once with 500 μl immunoprecipitation-low buffer (13Jechlinger M. Pelz R. Tretter V. Klausberger T. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2449-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For [3H]Ro15–4513 binding assays, the precipitated receptors were suspended in 1 ml of a solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-citrate buffer, pH 7.1, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 or 20 nm[3H]Ro15–4513 (20.9 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) in the absence or presence of 100 μm Ro15–1788 or 100 μm diazepam and were incubated for 90 min at 4 °C. For [3H]muscimol binding assays, the precipitated receptors were suspended in 1 ml of a solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-citrate buffer, and 20 nm[3H]muscimol (17.5 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) in the absence or presence of 10 μm GABA and were incubated for 60 min at 4 °C (13Jechlinger M. Pelz R. Tretter V. Klausberger T. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2449-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The suspensions were then filtered through Whatman GF/B filters. The filters were washed twice with 5 ml ([3H]Ro15–4513 assay) or with 3.5 ml ([3H]muscimol assay) of a 50 mm Tris-citrate buffer, pH 7.1. To determine the percentage of α4receptors retained by an immunoaffinity column, immunoprecipitation with the α4(379–421) antibody and the subsequent [3H]muscimol binding assays were performed with the original extract and the immunoaffinity column efflux in parallel. Total [3H]muscimol or [3H]Ro15–4513 binding in brain membrane extracts before or after immunoprecipitation of α4 subunit-containing GABAA receptors was measured after precipitating GABAA receptors with an antibody mixture containing 8 μg of β1 (350–404) plus 8 μg of β2 (351–405) plus 10 μg of β3(1Sieghart W.

Antibodies generated against these sequences were able to specifically precipitate solubilized recombinant GABAA receptors consisting of α4β3γ2 but not those consisting of α1β3γ2, α1β1γ2, or α1β3γ1 subunits (experiments not shown). In extracts from α4β3γ2-transfected human embryonic kidney cells, the antibodies α4(1–14), α4(379–421), and the previously available antibody α4(517–523) (8Kern W. Sieghart W. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 764-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) precipitated 37 ± 5%, 85 ± 3%, and 49 ± 3% of total [3H]muscimol binding sites present in the extract, respectively. The different length of the antigenic α4 sequence and, thus, the number of antibodies generated against different epitopes might have contributed to the different efficiency of these polyclonal antibodies in immunoprecipitation experiments. Because of their high efficiency in precipitating recombinant α4 receptors, α4(379–421) antibodies were used for all subsequent experiments. α4(379–421) antibodies were also capable of precipitating native GABAA receptors solubilized from rat brain membranes. These antibodies dose-dependently precipitated [3H]muscimol as well as [3H]Ro15–4513 binding sites with a comparable potency. Maximal precipitation of each binding site was observed already using 5 μg of antibody (experiments not shown). The number of binding sites precipitated, however, was low. Thus, α4(379–421) antibodies were able to precipitate only 6 ± 1% (mean values ±S.D., n = 5) of all [3H]muscimol and 2.3 ± 0.4% (mean values ±S.D.,n = 4) of all [3H]Ro15–4513 binding sites present in the extract. Scatchard analysis of [3H]muscimol binding to receptors precipitated by α4(379–421) antibodies resulted in aK d of 4.5 nm and in aB max of 68 fmol of [3H]muscimol/mg of protein (mean of two experiments performed in triplicate). A comparable affinity for [3H]muscimol was determined previously in recombinant α4β3γ2 receptors (18Ebert V. Scholze P. Sieghart W. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 1323-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Scatchard analysis of [3H]muscimol binding to all GABAA receptors present in the same extract resulted in aK d of 4.7 nm and aB max of 1490 fmol [3H]muscimol/mg of protein. A comparison of the B max values indicated that 4.6% of all [3H]muscimol binding sites could be precipitated by α4(379–421) antibodies. Finally, brain membrane extracts were cycled three times through an immunoaffinity column containing immobilized anti-peptide α4(379–421) antibodies. By this procedure all α4 receptors could be removed from the extract, as indicated by the observation that in the final efflux of this column anti-peptide α4(379–421) antibodies no longer were able to precipitate GABAA receptors, and α4subunits no longer could be detected in Western blots. In the same column efflux, [3H]muscimol binding was reduced by 4%, and [3H]Ro15–4513 binding was reduced by 2% compared with the original extract. Considering that these data resulted from a difference between large numbers, they excellently correlated with those obtained after precipitation by α4(379–421) antibodies (see above). The observation that this antibody no longer was able to precipitate the remaining GABAA receptors after all receptors containing α4 subunits had been removed by immunoaffinity chromatography support the conclusion that the α4(379–421) antibody was highly specific and did not cross-react with any other GABAA receptor subunit. Receptors bound to the α4(379–421) immunoaffinity column were then eluted by a change in the pH value of the buffer and were probed with digoxigenated α4(379–421) antibodies. These antibodies identified two proteins with apparent molecular mass of 67 and 57 kDa (Fig.1). The 67-kDa protein could also be identified by α4 (1Sieghart W. Pharmacol.

Each of these proteins could also be identified in human embryonic kidney cells transfected with α4β3γ2 subunits (experiments not shown). Because the signal for the 57-kDa protein increased with preparation time, this protein might be a degraded form of the 67-kDa protein. To identify GABAA receptor subunits that were copurified with α4 subunits, the α4(379–421) immunoaffinity column eluate was probed with 13 different antibodies, each of which specifically recognized a distinct GABAAreceptor subunit (13Jechlinger M. Pelz R. Tretter V. Klausberger T. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2449-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, in addition to the α4 subunit, α1, α2, α3, β1, β2, β3, γ1, γ2, γ3, and δ subunits were present in the α4(379–421) column eluate. The identity of the individual subunits was confirmed by the observation that the respective recombinant subunit exhibited an identical apparent molecular mass in parallel control experiments (experiments not shown). The identification of two different proteins by the β3(345–408) antibody is in agreement with previous results with this antibody. The protein with lower apparent molecular mass seemed to be a partially degraded β3 subunit, as discussed in Jechlinger et al. (13Jechlinger M. Pelz R. Tretter V. Klausberger T. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2449-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with a previous study (10Benke D. Michel C. Möhler H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 806-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), α5 subunits could not be detected in the α4(379–421) immunoaffinity column eluate. This either indicates that receptors containing α4 as well as α5 subunits are not very abundant or that they do not exist at all. Because of differences in the avidity of the antibodies used, the relative staining intensity does not necessarily reflect the relative abundance of the individual subunits in the eluate. To estimate the quantity of α4 receptors containing γ1, γ2, γ3, or δ subunits, brain membrane extracts were chromatographed on immunoaffinity columns containing either γ1(324–366), γ2(319–366), γ3(322–372), or δ(1–44) antibodies. The complete removal of receptors containing the respective subunits was demonstrated by the observation that the respective antibodies no longer were able to precipitate GABAAreceptors in the efflux of the column and that the respective subunits no longer could be identified in Western blots from receptors precipitated with α4(379–421) antibodies. The proportion of α4 receptors removed by these columns was estimated by a determination of [3H]muscimol binding to receptors precipitated by α4(379–421) antibodies in the original extract and in the column efflux. As shown in TableI, the γ1(324–366), γ2(319–366), γ3(322–372), or δ(1–44) immunoaffinity columns eliminated 7, 33, 4, or 7% of all α4 receptors, respectively. Overall this indicates that a total of 51% of all α4 receptors could be removed by these columns.Table IPercentage of α4 receptors containing γ1, γ2, γ3, and δ subunitsImmunoaffinity column% α4 receptors removedγ1(324–366)7 ± 2γ2(319–366)33 ± 4γ3(322–372)4 ± 3δ(1–44)7 ± 3Total51 ± 12Brain membrane extracts were chromatographed on the immunoaffinity columns as indicated.

GABAA receptors containing α4subunits were precipitated in the original extract or in the column efflux, and [3H]muscimol binding to precipitated receptors was determined. Results are means ± S.D. from six separate experiments performed in duplicate. In the eluate of these columns many different GABAAreceptor subunits could be identified by Western blot analysis. In the eluates of the γ1(324–366), γ2(319–366), or γ3(322–372) columns, however, it was not possible to identify a δ subunit or a γ subunit type different from that against which the column was directed. Similarly, in the eluate of the δ(1–44) immunoaffinity column, none of the different γ subunits could be identified (experiments not shown). This is in agreement with previous results (13Jechlinger M. Pelz R. Tretter V. Klausberger T. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2449-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Mossier B. Tögel M. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25777-25782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicating that GABAA receptors do contain only a single type of γ subunit. In addition, these data support previous conclusions that γ and δ subunits seem not to occur in the same GABAA receptors to a significant extent (13Jechlinger M. Pelz R. Tretter V. Klausberger T. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2449-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Quirk K. Whiting P.J. Ragan C.I. McKernan R.M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 290: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Finally, the absence of copurification of these subunits indicates that an aggregation of extracted GABAA receptors was not a problem in the present study. In another experiment brain membrane extracts were chromatographed first on the γ1(324–366), subsequently on the γ3(322–372), then on the δ(1–44), and finally on the γ2(319–366) immunoaffinity column. The proportion of α4 receptors removed by this consecutive chromatography on 4 different immunoaffinity columns was 43 ± 7% (mean ±S.D.,n = 4) and, thus, was comparable with the sum of α4 receptors removed by the individual columns. In the same experiment, however, it was demonstrated that these 4 immunoaffinity columns were able to remove a total of 98 ± 10% (mean ± S.D., n = 4) of all α1subunit-containing receptors from brain membrane extracts. α4 receptors remaining in the extract were then adsorbed to the α4(379–421) immunoaffinity column. As expected, in Western blots from the eluate of this column no γ1, γ2, γ3, or δ subunits could be detected. In this eluate, however, significant staining of α4, α2, and β3 subunits and weak staining of α1, β1, and β2 subunits could be observed (experiments not shown). Because of the low number of α4 receptors present in the original brain membrane extracts and because of the long time needed to subsequently remove receptors containing γ1, γ2, γ3, or δ subunits, a quantification of the composition of α4 receptors remaining in the extract no longer was possible. Because of a relatively low amount of specific α4(379–421) antibodies available and because of the large amounts of antibodies needed for the synthesis of the immunoaffinity column (5 mg) and for the determination of the subunit composition of α4 receptors containing γ1, γ2, γ3, or δ subunits, the relative proportion of α4 receptors containing α1, α2, α3, β1, β2, or β3 subunits could not be determined. In the present investigation an antibody was generated that specifically recognized the α4 subunit of GABAA receptors. This α4(379–421) antibody was able to precipitate approximately 5% of all [3H]muscimol binding sites present in rat brain extracts. A comparable percentage of [3H]muscimol binding sites could also be removed from brain extracts by an immunoaffinity column containing these antibodies. In the efflux of this column α4 subunit-containing GABAA receptors no longer could be detected. Considering the precipitation efficiency (85%) of the antibody used, these data indicated that approximately 6% of all GABAA receptors present in the extract contained the α4 subunit. These results are consistent with recent experiments (10Benke D. Michel C. Möhler H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 806-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) indicating that 6.4 ± 1.9% of all [3H]muscimol binding sites from rat brain extracts could be precipitated by anti-α4 antibodies. Some of the α4 subunit-containing GABAA receptors present in the brain, however, might have been lost because of detergent-induced denaturation and incomplete extraction of receptors, and it cannot be excluded that these receptors had properties different from those described in this study. In the eluate of the α4(379–421) column, not only the α4 subunit, but also α1, α2, α3, β1, β2, β3, γ1, γ2, γ3, and δ subunits could be detected, suggesting that any one of these subunits can be colocalized with α4 subunits in native GABAAreceptors. These data support and extend previous studies (8Kern W. Sieghart W. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 764-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 9Khan Z.U. Gutiérrez A. Mehta A.K. Miralles C.P. De Blas A.L. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 10Benke D. Michel C. Möhler H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 806-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), indicating a colocalization of α4 subunits with α1, α2, α3, β2/3, and γ2 subunits. Interestingly, only about 2% of all [3H]Ro15–4513 binding sites present in the extract were precipitated by the α4(379–421) antibody, although this antibody precipitated 5% of all [3H]muscimol binding sites. This indicated that part of the α4 receptors containing [3H]muscimol binding sites did not contain a [3H]Ro15–4513 binding site. Recently, it has been demonstrated that receptors consisting of αβ, αβγ1, and αβδ subunits contained [3H]muscimol but no [3H]Ro15–4513 sites, whereas receptors consisting of αβγ2 or αβγ3 subunits contained both of these sites (1Sieghart W. Pharmacol. Rev. 1995; 47: 181-234PubMed Google Scholar,21Zezula J. Slany A. Sieghart W. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 301: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To clarify the reason for the discrepant percentages of [3H]muscimol or [3H]Ro15–4513 binding sites precipitated by α4(379–421) antibodies, the relative proportion of α4 receptors associated with γ1, γ2, γ3, and δ subunits was determined. Results obtained demonstrated that 7, 33, 4, or 7 of α4 receptors contained γ1, γ2, γ3, or δ subunits, respectively. This indicates that a total of 37% of receptors precipitated by α4(379–421) antibodies (corresponding to 1.9% of total GABAA receptors) contained α4 as well as γ2 or γ3 subunits, and thus, contained [3H]Ro15–4513 binding sites. These results excellently correlate with the 2% of total [3H]Ro15–4513 binding sites precipitated by the α4(379–421) antibody. In addition, these data indicated that about 50% of the α4 receptors present in the extract did not contain γ1, γ2, γ3, or δ subunits at all. This finding seemed to be unique for α4receptors, because in the same experiments it was demonstrated that 98% of all α1 receptors present in the extract contained γ1, γ2, γ3, or δ subunits. Thus, a significant part of α4 receptors presumably is composed of α4 and β1–3 subunits, only. Receptors consisting of α and β subunits have not been identified in the brain so far, although such receptors easily can form in heterological expression systems. The Zn2+ sensitivity of some native receptors (22Smart T.G. Constanti A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 99: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), however, supports the existence of αβ receptors in the brain (for review see Ref. 1Sieghart W. Pharmacol. Rev. 1995; 47: 181-234PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, α4 receptors lacking γ1, γ2, γ3, or δ subunits might contain ε (23Davies P.A. Hanna M.C. Hales T.G. Kirkness E.F.

GAIP behaves as an integral membrane protein as judged by its resistance to the stripping effect of Na2CO3 treatment (13De Vries L. McCaffery J.M. Fischer T. Hubler L. McQuistan T. Watson N.

RGSZ1, a Gz-selective RGS protein in the brain, is also tightly membrane-bound and requires membrane association for its GTPase-activating protein activity toward Gz (14Wang J. Ducret A. Tu Y.

Although palmitoylated GAIP is found only in pellet fractions, the functional significance of palmitoylation has yet to be established. Surprisingly, palmitoylation of RGS4 is shown not to be required for membrane targeting (12Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5584-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It is intriguing that a defective RGS4, which can no longer bind to G proteins, can be recruited to plasma membrane by a constitutively activating Gα subunit (16Druey K.M. Sullivan B.M. Brown D. Fischer E.R. Watson N. Blumer K.J. Gerfen C.R. Scheschonka A. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18405-18410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These data suggest that RGS association with the plasma membrane may not be through simple binding to GTP-bound G proteins on the membrane but may rather involve an independent mechanism. It has been shown recently that RGS4 requires its NH2terminus for membrane association and biological function as assessed by its ability to substitute the function of Sst2p, an RGS member in yeast (12Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5584-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). As noted by Linder and colleagues (12Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5584-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), the RGS4 NH2-terminal 33-amino acid domain is conserved in RGS5 and RGS16 and is predicted to adopt an amphipathic helix with clusters of basic residues. In this study, we demonstrate that the NH2-terminal domain of RGS16 is also required for membrane association and biological activity. Furthermore, with the aid of computer modeling, we found that the RGS16 membrane association domain has structural features most reminiscent of those found in the membrane intercalating domain of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (17Dunne S.J. Cornell R.B. Johnson J.E. Glover N.R. Tracey A.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11975-11984Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). With that in perspective, we have carried out extensive mutational analysis to study the structure-function relationship of the RGS16 NH2-terminal domain. Our results fine map the core membrane association domain to the NH2-terminal amino acids 7–32 region. The bulk of this region consists of an amphipathic helix. The hydrophobic residues of the nonpolar face and the positive charge side chains positioned along the polar/nonpolar interface of the amphipathic helix are essential for membrane association. Moreover, we show that the conserved palmitoylation site in RGS16, Cys-12, which has been shown to be palmitoylated in RGS4, plays a minor role in membrane association. Taken together, our findings and work done by others have defined a unique amphipathic domain that will provide a structural basis for RGS membrane association and biological activities. To visualize the subcellular localization of RGS16 protein in yeast cells, the coding region of RGS16 was fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) cDNA and was expressed in yeast cells under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter in the pMW29 vector as described previously (18Chen C. Zheng B. Han J. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8679-8685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Briefly, aBamHI site was introduced to RGS16 cDNA just before the stop codon by polymerase chain reaction. The sense and the antisense oligonucleotide primers were CTCGAGATGTGCCGCACCCTAGCCACCTTCC and CGGGTCGACTCGGAAGTGTGTGCCTAGGAATT, respectively. The polymerase chain reaction product was then treated with Klenow DNA polymerase and polynucleotide kinase and ligated to BamHI/Klenow-treated pBluescript (Stratagene) for sequencing analysis. The entire coding region of RGS16 was fused in-frame to GFP in pEGFPN1 (CLONTECH) through the BamHI site to create RGS16-GFP chimeric cDNA. The fusion cDNA fragment was then cloned into the yeast expression vector pMW29 to generate the pMW29-RGS16-GFP construct. Two deletion mutants, (7–201)RGS16 and (11–201)RGS16, were generated by polymerase chain reactions. The 5′-primers were CATATGACCTTCCCCAACACCTGCCTG and CATATGACCTGCCTGGAGAGAGCTAAAG, respectively; the common 3′-primer was GGGTCAAGTGTGTGAAGGCTCAGCTGGGC. The resultant NH2termini of these three deletion mutants were used to replace the wild type NH2 terminus of the above created pMW29-RGS16-GFP through the internal SacI site, creating pMW29-(7–201)-GFP and pMW29-(11–201)-GFP. To create RGS16 NH2-terminal GFP fusion constructs, the NH2-terminal coding fragments for the wild type RGS16 and individual deletion mutants were digested withSacI, blunt ended with Klenow polymerase, and released from the pBluescript with XhoI. These fragments were then fused in-frame to the start of the GFP coding region in the pEGFPN1 vector, which was cut with BamHI, Klenow treated (blunt ended), and digested with XhoI. The XhoI/NotI fragments of the generated RGS16 NH2terminal GFP fusion cDNA were blunt ended with Klenow polymerase and ligated to theSmaI site of pMW29, resulting in pMW29-(1–32)GFP, pMW29-(7–32)-GFP, and pMW29-(11–32)-GFP. A standard polymerase chain reaction method was used to produce six point mutations near the 5′-end of RGS16, C2A, F8D, F8G, F8K, P9A, P9D, and P9G. The other mutants, C12A, R15A, R15E, A16D, K17A, K17E, F19A, F19D, F19E, F19N, F19T, K20A, K20E, R22A, R22E, L23D, F26D, L27D, H28E/K29E, R15A/K17A, R15E/K17E, K20A/R22A, and K20E/R22E, were created by site-directed mutagenesis using the TransformerTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH). Using the above generated mutants R22A, R22E, K20A, and K20E as templates, double mutants R15A/R22A, R15E/R22E, K17A/K20A, and K17E/K20E were produced, respectively. The fragments containing specific point mutation(s) were released from the pBluescript with EcoRV/SacI to replace their corresponding wild type sequences in pMW29. The sequences of the oligonucleotide primers for mutagenesis are available upon request. The ability of individual RGS16 fusion GFP to attenuate the pheromone signaling in yeast was measured as described previously with some modifications (10Chen C. Lin S.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The yeast strain was YDM400 (MATa ura3–52 lys2–801amade2–101oc trp1- Δ 63 his3- Δ 200 leu2- Δ 1 sst2- Δ 2) (8Dohlman H.G. Song J. Ma D. Courchesne W.E. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5194-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of α-factor applied to the small discs of 3MM Whatman paper was 2 nmol. The expression levels of each RGS16 construct were monitored by Western blotting using anti-GFP antibody (CLONTECH) as described previously (10Chen C. Lin S.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were cultured in Ura− dropout liquid medium containing 2% galactose at 30 °C to midlog phase (A 600 = 0.9–1.2). The live yeast cells were then dotted onto a layer of 1% agarose gel on 12-well multitest slides (ICN). Cells were visualized using a Zeiss microscope connected with an MRC-1024 laser scanning confocal microscope (Bio-Rad). The confocal images of cells in middle planes were collected using a 100 × objective and processed with Adobe Photoshop 4.0. Cell fractionation by differential centrifuge was carried out as described (19Wise A. Grassie M.A. Parenti M. Lee M. Rees S. Milligan G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10620-10629Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast transformants carrying pMW29-RGS16-GFP (wild type) and pMW29-RGS16F19D-GFP (mutant) were grown in Ura− dropout medium with 2% galactose to logarithmic phase. Cells were harvested and washed once with ice-cold lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 mmbenzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Cells were lysed at 4 °C by vortexing with acid-treated glass beads. After centrifugation at 375 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the clear supernatant (S1) was then spun at 10,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to generate a low speed pellet (P2) and a low speed supernatant (S2). Supernatant S2 was centrifuged further at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to generate a high speed pellet (P3) and a high speed supernatant (S3). P2 and P3 were resuspended with the lysis buffer in the same volume as their respective supernatants. To determine RGS16-GFP fusion proteins in each fraction, an equal volume of individual fractions was separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to an ImmobilonTM-P filter (Millipore), and detected with the RGS16-specific antibody (10Chen C. Lin S.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To determine the nature of the membrane association of wild type RGS16 and mutant RGS16F19D proteins, the supernatant fraction (S1) was mixed with either 0.1 volume of H2O (control), 5m NaCl, 1 m Na2CO3 (pH 11.0), 8 m urea, or 10% Triton X-100. After incubation on ice for 1 h, these mixtures were centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. Each pellet fraction was resuspended in the same volume as that of its respective supernatant fraction. Samples were separated on the 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Western blotting assay as above. Modeling of structures was performed using LOOK (Molecular Application Group). The secondary structure prediction was based on discrimination of protein secondary structure class (20King R.D. Stemberg M.J.E. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2298-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The region predicted to form an α-helix was aligned to the target sequence (the membrane intercalation domain of cytidylyltransferase, PDB accession number 1 peh). The structure was subsequently modeled based on the algorithm of Lee and Subbiah (21Lee C. Subbiah S. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 373-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The algorithm uses self-consistent ensemble optimization to determine the global minimum structure resulting in the location of side chains with high accuracy. We have shown previously that removal of amino acids 1–12 renders RGS16 inactive in the yeast halo assay, and yet the core RGS domain retains all of the biochemical features of a GTPase-activating protein (10Chen C. Lin S.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18Chen C. Zheng B. Han J. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8679-8685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Most recently, Linder and colleagues (12Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5584-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) have shown that a similar domain in RGS4 serves as a membrane targeting sequence and is also required for RGS4 function. This prompted us to study if this membrane association is a general requirement for RGS function. We fused the RGS16 NH2terminus to GFP to test if this region could confer membrane-targeting activity to a heterologous protein in yeast. As shown in Fig.1 A, the first 32 amino acids were sufficient to direct GFP to the plasma membrane. We then tested if the dysfunction of the N-deletion mutants of RGS16 is correlated to its failure to localize to the plasma membrane using the halo assay and confocal microscopy. In the halo assay, yeast cells, in response to pheromone, are arrested in the G1 phase of cell cycle and hence form a clear area or halo on a cell growth lawn on an agar plate. RGS16 can substitute for the yeast Sst2p in the attenuation of pheromone signaling and prevents halo formation (18Chen C. Zheng B. Han J. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8679-8685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Deletion of amino acids 1–6 did not affect RGS16 membrane association or biological activity (Fig. 1 B). However, removal of amino acids 1–10 rendered RGS16 inactive in both membrane association and in attenuation of pheromone signaling (Fig. 1 B), indicating that membrane attachment of RGS16 is important for its function in the cell. Secondary structure analysis predicts two helices (H1 and H2, as depicted in Fig. 1) within the NH2-terminal membrane association domain, comprising approximately amino acids 1–5 and 12–30, respectively. To examine the role of these helices, three deletions, removing amino acids 1–6, 1–10, and 1–13, were made. As shown above (Fig. 1), deletion of 1–6 did not affect any membrane association or biological activity, whereas removal of 1–10 or 1–13 rendered RGS16 inactive in both membrane association and attenuation of pheromone signaling. To fine map residues essential for membrane association, residues 8 and 9 of RGS16 were mutated because these amino acids are conserved in RGS4, RGS5, and RGS16 (see Fig. 3 A). Position 8 is an amino acid with conserved hydrophobic side chain (leucine in RGS4 and 5 and phenylalanine in RGS16); position 9 is a conserved proline residue. In RGS16, removal of the hydrophobic side chain at position 8 (L8G, L8K) led to a loss of biological activity, correlating with a loss in membrane association (Fig. 2). Substitution of the conserved proline (P9A and P9G) had no effect on RGS16 function. At both positions, mutations, which introduce negative charge (L8D and P9D), significantly diminished RGS16 membrane association. The requirement of residue 8 to be hydrophobic and the deleterious effect associated with introducing negative charges at positions 8 and 9 suggest that the side chains of these two residues may physically interact with the plasma membrane. The above results, in combination of the deletion, thus define amino acids 7–32 as the core membrane association region.Figure 2Effects of two conserved residues Phe-8 and Pro-9 in amino acids 7–32 on RGS16 function. The conserved residue Phe-8 was mutated to Gly, Lys, or Asp; Pro-9 was changed to Ala, Gly, or Asp.

A. 1998; 95: 5584-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) suggest that the NH2-terminal amino acids 1–33 sequence of RGS4 cannot be subdivided for membrane localization. This region is conserved among RGS4, RGS5, as well as RGS16. We therefore proceeded to study the role and structural features of the second helix (amino acids 12–30) in addition to residues at positions 8 and 9. We first predicted its three-dimensional protein structure via computer modeling and verified the reliability of the structure with structure-function analysis. The predicted three-dimensional structure of the helix is that of an amphipathic helix with a strip of hydrophobic residues on top and strips of positively charged residues along the polar/nonpolar interface of the amphipathic peptide (Fig. 3, Band C). Mutations were made for both the hydrophobic and basic residues to examine the contribution of these residues toward membrane targeting. The hydrophobic strip consists of seven nonpolar residues. Single mutations of five of these nonpolar residues to an aspartate residue (A16D, F19D, L23D, F26D, and L27D) resulted in a loss of RGS16 biological activity (Fig. 4). Most notably, the A16D and F19D mutations completely abolished RGS16 function, as judged by its halo size close to that formed by cells transformed with GFP alone. To establish the relevance of hydrophobicity in driving membrane targeting, Phe-19 was selected and was replaced by a series of residues with a decreasing degree of hydrophobicity (F19A, F19T, F19N, F19E, and F19D). As shown in Fig.4 B, the F19A substitution alone had little effect, whereas mutations leading to a decrease in the degree of hydrophobicity gave rise to a corresponding increase in the size of halo and a proportional increase in its distribution in the cytoplasm. Based on the predicted model of the amphipathic helix (Fig. 3), the distribution of positively charged residues along the polar/nonpolar interface is reminiscent of those found in the amphipathic helices of phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (17Dunne S.J. Cornell R.B. Johnson J.E. Glover N.R. Tracey A.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11975-11984Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and prostaglandin H synthase (22Picot D. Garavito R.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In both enzymes, the helices serve as a membrane-targeting domain with positive charge residues positioned along the polar/nonpolar interface. To study the role of these basic residues, a series of single and double mutations was generated. First, each basic residue was replaced with an alanine. The R22A mutation resulted in the loss of membrane targeting (Table I). R15A and K17A mutations had weak effects, whereas K20A had no effect. For double mutations, where a pair of basic residues was mutated to alanine residues, all resulted in the loss of membrane targeting (R15A/K17A, K20A/R22A, R15A/R22A, and K17A/K20A) (Table I). We repeated the alanine-scanning mutagenesis with a glutamate. Double mutations were generally more defective than the single mutations, all of which resulted in the loss of membrane targeting and biological activity. Among the single mutation series, the K20E replacement had little effect compared with other single mutations (R22E, R15E, and K17E). In the double mutation series, the H28E/K29E combination was less severe than others (R15E/K17E, K20E/R22E, R15E/R22E, K17E/K20E). The loss of function resulting from the replacement of the basic residues with either a nonpolar residue (Ala) or an acidic residue (Glu) demonstrates the importance of these basic residues. Because not all mutations on these basic residues have a similar effect on RGS16 biological activity, the role of these basic residues likely depends on their position along the amphipathic helix (see “Discussion”).Table IEffects of positively charged residues in the membrane association region on the function of RGS16ProteinHalo sizeSubcellular localizationam, plasma membrane; cc, completely cytoplasmic; c, cytoplasm.RGS16 (WT)−mGFP (vector)++++ccAla(A) mutationsSingleR15A−bSmall, turbid halo.m/cK17A−bSmall, turbid halo.m/cK20A−mR22A+cDoubleR15A/K17A+cK20A/R22A+cR15A/R22A+cK17A/K20A+cGlu(E) mutationsSingleR15E++cK17E++cK20E+cR22E++cDoubleR15E/K17E+++ccK20E/R22E+++ccR15E/R22E+++ccK17E/K20E+++ccH28E/K29E++cFour positively charged residues, Arg-15, Lys-17, Lys-20, and Arg-22, were altered to Ala or Glu; His-28 and Lys-29 were changed to glutamic residues (H28E/K29E).

Open table in a new tab Four positively charged residues, Arg-15, Lys-17, Lys-20, and Arg-22, were altered to Ala or Glu; His-28 and Lys-29 were changed to glutamic residues (H28E/K29E). These mutants were assayed for their ability to attenuate pheromone response and subcellular localization. The halo sizes formed on different yeast cells were expressed using + or − relative to those of vector expressing GFP alone and wild type RGS16 (WT), respectively. To confirm the membrane localization of RGS16 in yeast, we fractionated by differential centrifugation cell homogenates from yeast cells transformed with the wild type RGS16 and from mutant F19D yeast cells as a control. Different fractions were then subjected to Western blotting analysis using the RGS16-specific antibody. As expected, most of the RGS16 (wild type) was present in the crude membrane pellet (P3 fraction, 100,000 × g), with less than 20% in the cytosol (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, the F19D mutant protein was exclusively cytosolic. To assess the physical nature of the RGS16 interaction with the plasma membrane, supernatants (S1 fractions, 375 × g) were treated with conditions that solubilize peripheral membrane proteins or integral membrane proteins. RGS16 was stripped off the membrane when incubated with 0.5 m NaCl (high salt), 0.1 mNa2CO3 (pH 11.0), or 1.0% Triton X-100 but was only partially released from the membrane by treatment with 0.8m urea (Fig. 5 B). These data indicate that RGS16 is a peripheral membrane protein. Cys-2 and Cys-12 of RGS4 have been shown to be palmitoylation sites (12Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5584-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). RGS16 contains cysteine residues at the same positions. In this study, we mutated Cys-2 and Cys-12 to Ala and examined the effect of these Cys residues on RGS16 activity and its membrane association. Although alteration of Cys-2 to alanine had very little effect on membrane association or on the attenuating activity of pheromone signaling, the C12A mutation was more detrimental to the functional properties of RGS16 (Fig.6). This is consistent with the results obtained with (7–201)-GFP showing that the first 6 amino acids are not essential for RGS16 function (Fig. 1 B). We have shown previously that the core RGS domain of RGS16 retains full activity in G protein binding and GTPase-activating protein activity in vitro but requires the NH2 terminus for biological activity in vivo as assayed by its ability to attenuate pheromone signaling in yeast. Our work in this study clearly shows that RGS16 NH2 terminus plays a critical role in membrane association and also shows that membrane association may be important for RGS biological function, in agreement with what has been shown with RGS4. The first 33 amino acids of RGS4, RGS5, and RGS16 are highly conserved. It was suggested that the entire domain of amino acids 1–33 in RGS4 forms a continuous amphipathic helix and is required for membrane association (12Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5584-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, our secondary structure analysis suggests that there may be two putative α-helices in the NH2-terminal amino acids 1–32. Our deletion experiments suggest that the sequence of amino acids 1–6, which includes the first α-helix, is not relevant for biological activity. The rest of the NH2 terminus (amino acids 7–32), which consists of predominantly the second putative α-helix from amino acids 12–30, has been defined as core membrane association domain. Furthermore, through detailed mutational analysis, we show that the amphipathic features of the α-helix determine membrane-targeting activity for RGS16, and these are likely shared by the homologous RGS4 and by RGS5. Analysis of the predicted model of the RGS16 amphipathic helix reveals many similar characteristics found in amphipathic α-helices involved in membrane intercalation, e.g. the membrane association domains of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase and prostaglandin H synthase (17Dunne S.J. Cornell R.B. Johnson J.E. Glover N.R. Tracey A.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11975-11984Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 22Picot D. Garavito R.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Typically, the nonpolar face of the amphipathic helices consists of a strip of hydrophobic residues, whereas strips of positively charged residues are positioned along the polar/nonpolar interface. The important factors contributing to membrane association are 2-fold. First, hydrophobic interactions of the nonpolar face of the helix and the lipid core increase the propensity of the helix. Second, electrostatic interactions between the side chains of arginine and lysine, which form strips of positive charges along the polar/nonpolar interface of the helix, and the negatively charged amphiphile of the anionic phospholipids in the membrane, are important. All mutations on hydrophobic residues on the nonpolar side of the putative amphipathic helix led to a loss of function. Among the hydrophobic residues, Ala-16 and Phe-19 seem to be the most crucial, consistent with their location in the middle of the core amphipathic helix. The requirement of hydrophobicity for membrane intercalation is supported further by a series of mutations on a selected residue Phe-19. As expected, replacing Phe-19 with alanine itself had no detectable effect. However, mutations leading to gradual reduction of hydrophobicity resulted in corresponding reductions in membrane association. However, it should be noted that none of the NH2-terminal mutants attains the null biological activity seen with GFP alone. As shown previously, the RGS domain of RGS16 still retains full GTPase-activating protein activity compared with the wild type protein (10Chen C. Lin S.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Fortuitous interaction with the Gpa1p of the RGS16 NH2-terminal mutants or/and small portions of the mutant proteins which still remain on the membrane (seen with even the most cytosolic mutant F19D (Fig.5 A)) may contribute to the observed partial activities. Similarly, most mutations on the basic residues expectedly led to a loss of function. A single replacement of basic residues with an alanine generally had lesser effect on RGS16 compared with double mutants. This observation is consistent with the fact that multiple basic residues are positioned at the polar/nonpolar interface. The lesser effect of removal of a single positive charge may be caused by redundancy as its loss can be countered by neighboring basic residues. However, similar replacement with a glutamate will significantly introduce electrostatic repulsion at the polar/nonpolar interface, leading to reduction of helical stabilization and hence membrane intercalation. This possibility is supported by the observation that (Glu) mutations on the basic residues have much dramatic effects than their (Ala) mutants. Another interesting observation is that the K20A mutation has no effect on biological activity of RGS16. This is consistent with the predicted structure of the amphipathic helix, where the side chain of Lys-20 is oriented toward the lipid core and away from the polar/nonpolar interface. This deviation explains why the loss of the positive side chain of Lys-20 has no effect on the helical stabilization. Many membrane association mechanisms commonly involve cooperative interaction of two components: hydrophobic components and a cluster of basic residues. In MARCKS (myristolated alanine-rich C kinase substrate) proteins or p60Src, the hydrophobic component is a myristoyl group (23McLaughlin S. Aderem A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 272-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 24Sigal C.T. Zhou W. Buser C.A. McLaughlin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12253-12257Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar); in CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, it is the hydrophobic side chains in the nonpolar face of the amphipathic α-helix (17Dunne S.J. Cornell R.B. Johnson J.E. Glover N.R. Tracey A.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11975-11984Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the case of RGS16 and most probably RGS4 and RGS5, the mechanism used may resemble that of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase. However, there are noticeable differences. The length of the predicted amphipathic α-helix of RGS16 is about half the size of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase. Second, unlike the latter, RGS16 has the conserved palmitoylation site within the amphipathic helix. Although studies on RGS4 and RGS16 in yeast do not demonstrate significant relevance of palmitoylation in membrane targeting, it is difficult to rule out its role in mammalian cells. It is of great interest to understand the role of palmitoylation in RGS proteins. As a first approximation, our findings suggest that RGS16 interacts with the plasma membrane through hydrophobic interactions between nonpolar residues of RGS16 and membrane lipids and through electrostatic interactions between the basic residues and the anionic phospholipids in the membrane. However, the mechanism of RGS membrane association is complicated by several reported observations. First, RGS4 and RGS16 appear to be largely present in the membrane in yeast cells, but these proteins are largely located in the cytosol in mammalian cells (16Druey K.M. Sullivan B.M. Brown D.

Yaw, and S.-C. Lin, data not shown. Second, cotransfection of a constitutively activating Gαi2 can bring a G protein-binding-defective RGS4 protein to the plasma membrane (16Druey K.M. Sullivan B.M. Brown D. Fischer E.R. Watson N. Blumer K.J. Gerfen C.R. Scheschonka A. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18405-18410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent report shows that the calcium ionophore A23187 mimics agonist-induced redistribution of RGS3 (25Dulin N.O. Sorokin A. Reed E. Elliott S. Kehrl J.H. Dunn M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 714-723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations all point to a possibility that there may be a complex mechanism regulating the subcellular redistribution of RGS proteins which involves downstream events of G protein activation. One possibility is that G protein activation somehow triggers binding of a cellular factor to the membrane-targeting region of the RGS proteins for translocation to the membrane. In fact, we have identified a membrane protein that binds strongly to the exact region required for membrane association. 3C. Chen and S. C. Lin, unpublished data. The biological significance of this interaction remains to be seen. Nevertheless, our extensive mutational analysis and computer modeling have defined a unique membrane association domain that is shared by RGS4, RGS5, and RGS16. Understanding the structural basis of the RGS membrane targeting domains will definitely help understand how RGS proteins function to attenuate signaling pathways by G protein-coupled receptors."

We now use a moderately stable complex of R183C Gαq bound to GTP to show that PLC-β1 acts directly as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for isolated Gαq in a membrane-free system. PLC-β1 accelerated the hydrolysis of GαqR183C·GTP up to 20-fold.

The Gαq GAP activity of RGS4 can also be quantitated by this assay; it accelerated hydrolysis of bound GTP about 100-fold. The Gq GAP activities of both PLC-β1 and RGS4 are blocked by Gβγ subunits, probably by a competitive mechanism. These data suggest either that the Gβγ subunits are not continuously required for receptor-catalyzed GDP/GTP exchange during steady-state GTP hydrolysis or that GAPs, either PLC-β or RGS proteins, can substitute for Gβγ in this set of reactions.

GTPase-activating protein phospholipase C-β guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid Heterotrimeric G proteins couple cell surface receptors to intracellular effector proteins according to a cycle of controlled GTP binding and hydrolysis. Receptors activate G proteins by driving the dissociation of bound GDP from the Gα subunit and the subsequent binding of GTP. Deactivation of Gα results from hydrolysis of Gα-bound GTP to GDP. Hydrolysis is generally slow (t 12 ∼0.2–7 min) but can be accelerated up to 600-fold by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs)1 (1Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

GAPs and receptors thus coordinately control both steady-state signal amplitude and the rates of signal initiation and termination. Three groups of proteins act as GAPs for heterotrimeric G proteins: PLC-βs, RGS proteins, and rhoGEFs. Members of the PLC-β family are both the major effectors for the Gq class of G proteins and Gq-specific GAPs. Their GAP activity is thought to allow rapid response to removal of agonist without significantly diminishing signal amplitude (6Berstein G. Blank J.L. Jhon D.-Y. Exton J.H. Rhee S.G. Ross E.M.

Mukhopadhyay, unpublished data. Kinetic analyses performed using the vesicle system suggested that PLC-β acts on Gαq to stimulate hydrolysis of bound GTP, and that the other components, receptor, Gβγ, and phospholipid, are involved only in promoting GDP/GTP exchange during steady-state hydrolysis. However, direct demonstration of a simple GAP activity was problematic because isolated Gαq binds GTP too slowly to allow preparation of the Gαq·GTP substrate needed for a straightforward GAP assay (16Berstein G.

Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We have now overcome this limitation by using a hydrolysis-impaired but still GAP-sensitive mutant protein, GαqR183C, to study Gαq-GAP interactions under single turnover conditions. Results with this assay indicate that PLC-β1 acts directly on Gαq to accelerate hydrolysis of bound GTP. Surprisingly, the Gq GAP activity of PLC-β1 is strongly inhibited by Gβγ. Competitive binding of Gβγ and PLC-β1, or of Gβγ and RGS proteins (5Wang J. Ducret A. Tu Y. Kozasa T. Aebersold R. Ross E.M. J. Biol.

PLC-β1 and Gβ1γ2 were expressed in Sf9 cells and purified as described (7Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M. J. Biol.

PLC-β1 purity was estimated from silver staining to be 95%. Mouse GαqR183C was purified exactly as described for wild type Gαq (7Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M. J. Biol.

Gαq was approximately 40% pure according to silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and was approximately 50% active based on the amount of bound GDP (16Berstein G. Blank J.L.

[γ-32P]GTP was synthesized as described by Johnson and Walseth (19Johnson R.A. Walseth T.F. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1979; 10: 135-168PubMed Google Scholar) or purchased from NEN Life Science Products, and was purified as described (7Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7999-8007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Gq GAP activity was assayed according to the acceleration of a single round of hydrolysis of GTP bound to GαqR183C. GαqR183C·[γ-32P]GTP was prepared by incubating 100 nm GαqR183C with 10 μm [γ-32P]GTP at 20 °C in 20 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 5.5 mm CHAPS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 900 μm MgSO4 (10 μm final free Mg2+), 30 mm(NH4)2SO4, 2% glycerol, and 0.1 mg/ml albumin. The reaction reached steady-state at about 2 h and was constant for at least 1 h more. Approximately 30% of active GαqR183C bound [γ-32P]GTP. The reaction mixture was diluted with an equal volume of buffer A (50 mmNa-HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.3% cholate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 900 μm MgSO4, 0.1 mg/ml albumin) at 0 °C. After 5 min, GαqR183C·[γ-32P]GTP was isolated by centrifugal gel filtration on a 3-ml column of Sephadex G25 in buffer A (18Wang J. Tu Y. Woodson J. Song X. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5732-5740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This procedure removed 99.9% of free nucleotide and yielded 20–30% recovery of active GαqR183C. For GAP assays, GαqR183C·[γ-32P]GTP was diluted 8–10-fold in assay buffer (20 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.2% cholate, 80 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 900 μmMgSO4, 0.04 mg/ml albumin, and 2% glycerol) plus other proteins (details in figure legends) to a final concentration of 300–500 pm. Samples were incubated for various times at 20 °C. Hydrolysis was measured routinely in 20–30-μl samples according to the release of [32P]Pi (18Wang J. Tu Y. Woodson J. Song X. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5732-5740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Background was <10%. Alternatively, hydrolysis was monitored as the loss of Gαq-bound [γ-32P]GTP using the standard nitrocellulose filter assay (18Wang J. Tu Y. Woodson J. Song X. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5732-5740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This assay detects both hydrolysis and dissociation of GTP, with dissociation being equal to the difference between the rate of loss of bound nucleotide and the appearance of [32P]Pi. The specified detergents were used in these procedures because [γ-32P]GTP binding to GαqR183C and GAP activity are differentially sensitive to detergents. Cholate, which is used for routine storage of wild type Gαq, destabilized GαqR183C during the [γ-32P]GTP binding reaction, and several other detergents (Lubrol, CHAPS, Triton X-100, octyl glucoside, dodecyl maltoside) allowed more efficient preparation of GαqR183C·[γ-32P]GTP. However, the Gq GAP activity of PLC-β1 could only be observed in the presence of cholate. Consequently, GαqR183C·[γ-32P]GTP was prepared in CHAPS, and GTP hydrolysis was assayed in cholate. The GAP activity of RGS4 was unaltered by octyl glucoside, dodecyl maltoside, cholate, or deoxycholate. GTP hydrolysis was analyzed according to Scheme 1, allowing for slow hydrolysis of GTP bound to free Gαq (k hyd) and for faster hydrolysis by a GAP·Gαq complex (k gap). GTP hydrolysis and dissociation in the absence of GAP both followed a mono-exponential time course. [γ-32P]GTP dissociation was significant over the time course of some assays and was monitored as excess loss of bound [γ-32P]GTP. Hydrolysis in the presence of either PLC-β1 or RGS4 was bi-exponential, with a fraction of the total GαqR183C·[γ-32P]GTP appearing to be GAP-insensitive. For time course experiments, the two rate constants (k hyd and k gap) and the fractions of the GαqR183C·[γ-32P]GTP substrate that were GAP-sensitive (Ss) or insensitive (Si) were estimated by simultaneous analysis of [32P]Pi release (Pt) and the loss of bound [γ-32P]GTP (Bt). Both measurements were made in the absence and presence of GAP, and data were fitted simultaneously to two-component decay equations. Pt=(Si)·(khyd/(khyd+kdiss)·(1–e–(khyd+kdiss)·t)+(Ss)·(1–e–kgap·t)Equation 1 Bt=(Si)·e–(khyd+kdiss)·t+(Ss)·e–kgap·tEquation 2 Data were fit using the SigmaPlot program package, withSs set to zero for experiments performed in the absence of GAP. All constants were allowed to float. Complete kinetic analyses were performed with GAPs at saturating concentrations. In routine GAP assays, GAP-sensitive GαqR183C·[γ-32P]GTP (Ss) was set equal to the amount of [32P]Pi released over 1 h in the presence of a maximally activating concentration (≥ 20 nm) of PLC-β1. Hydrolytic rate constants (k app) for the GAP-sensitive pool were calculated from single time points (8 min) essentially according to Wang et al. (18Wang J. Tu Y. Woodson J. Song X. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5732-5740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). At intermediate PLC-β1 concentrations, k appreflects a combination of k hyd andk gap weighted according to the concentration of the GAP and its affinity for the Gαq·GTP complex (18Wang J. Tu Y. Woodson J. Song X. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5732-5740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar,20Wang J. Tu Y. Mukhopadhyay S. Chidiac P. Biddlecome G.H. Ross E.M.

PLC-β accelerates the agonist-stimulated, steady-state GTPase activity of heterotrimeric Gαq and Gα11 in phospholipid vesicles that also contain m1 muscarinic cholinergic receptor (6Berstein G.

To study the GAP activity of PLC-β on the hydrolysis of Gαq-bound GTP in the absence of other proteins, we attempted to prepare a stable complex of Gαq and [γ-32P]GTP, the substrate for conventional single-turnover GAP assays. However, although Gαqhydrolyzes bound GTP somewhat more slowly than do Gi or Gs (∼0.7 min−1 versus 3 min−1) (6Berstein G. Blank J.L. Jhon D.-Y. Exton J.H. Rhee S.G. Ross E.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 411-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), it exchanges bound GDP for GTP much more slowly such that significant Gαq·[γ-32P]GTP does not accumulate (17Chidiac P.

GαqR183C still activates PLC-β1 however, and the homologous mutant of Gαi had been shown to respond to the GAP activity of RGS4, although other commonly used constitutively active mutants may not (2Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 24Druey K.M. Sullivan B.M. Brown D. Fischer E.R. Watson N. Blumer K.J. Gerfen C.R. Scheschonka A. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18405-18410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In initial experiments, [γ-32P]GTP bound to GαqR183C was hydrolyzed under standard assay conditions at a rate (k hyd) of about 0.005 min−1 (Fig. 1 A). Hydrolysis followed a single exponential time course. For comparison, wild-type Gq displayed a k hyd = 0.7 min−1 at 30 °C when assayed as the trimer in receptor-containing proteoliposomes (6Berstein G. Blank J.L. Jhon D.-Y. Exton J.H. Rhee S.G. Ross E.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 411-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The R183C mutation thus decreases the intrinsic hydrolytic rate of Gαq by 140-fold, comparable with the effect of the analogous mutation on Gαs (25Freissmuth M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21907-21914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Note that some GTP dissociated from GαqR183C during the course of the hydrolysis assay, such that the loss of bound [γ-32P]GTP is greater than the appearance of [32P]Pi. Control experiments indicated that the dissociation rate for GTP was 0.005 min−1, about equal to the basal hydrolysis rate (Fig.1 A). Although dissociation at this rate did not alter measured hydrolysis rates at high GAP concentrations, it was significant in the absence of GAPs, and all data are corrected for GTP dissociation. Both PLC-β1 and RGS4 markedly accelerated the rate of hydrolysis of GTP bound to GαqR183C (Fig. 1, B and C). In this experiment, 120 nm PLC-β1 accelerated hydrolysis of Gαq-bound GTP 10-fold, and 120 nm RGS4 accelerated hydrolysis 110-fold. However, hydrolysis time courses were biphasic, with the slower component displaying the same GTP hydrolysis rate that was observed in the absence of GAP. The data thus suggest the existence of two populations of GαqR183C·[γ-32P]GTP that have the same basal hydrolytic rates but only one of which interacts productively with GAPs. To determine the relative amounts of GAP-sensitive and GAP-insensitive GαqR183C·[γ-32P]GTP and the relevant hydrolytic rates, hydrolysis time course data obtained with and without GAP (Fig. 1) were simultaneously fit to a two-component rate equation (see “Experimental Procedures”). According to these analyses, the GAP-sensitive pool of GαqR183C·[γ-32P]GTP in such experiments was 44–67% of total, and the rate of the slow components was similar to the rate in the absence of a GAP. PLC-β1 increased the hydrolytic rate (the GAP-sensitive pool) to 0.041 min−1 and 120 nm RGS4 increased this parameter to 0.61 min−1in the experiment shown. The fraction of GAP-sensitive GαqR183C·GTP could be altered by changing the concentration or identity of detergent, but a GAP-insensitive component was always evident. Overall, the results of such experiments are consistent with the idea that too little detergent leads to aggregation of the G protein and consequent GAP-insensitivity, whereas too much or the wrong kind of detergent inhibits GAP activity. GAP activity was maximal at 80 mm NaCl; basal GTPase activity increased at higher concentrations and GAP-stimulated activity was reduced at lower concentrations. The concentration of Mg2+ (100 nm to 10 mm) had no effect on either basal or PLC-β1-stimulated GTP hydrolysis. Standard assay conditions were optimized for the GAP activity of PLC-β1. Based on experiments of the sort shown in Fig. 1, we routinely analyzed Gq GAP activity at intermediate GAP concentrations by measuring GTP hydrolysis at a single time point (usually 8 min) and then correcting for the size of the GAP-sensitive pool of GαqR183C·[γ-32P]GTP (Fig.2). GAP-sensitive GαqR183C·[γ32P]GTP was taken as the amount of GTP hydrolyzed after 60 min in the presence of a maximally effective concentration of PLC-β1 (>20 nm). The average fraction of GAP-sensitive substrate estimated by this method, 58 ± 11% (n = 9), compares favorably with the fitted values taken from time course experiments (Fig. 1). Moreover, the fitted maximal rate constant for PLC-β1-stimulated hydrolysis, 0.068 ± 0.006 min−1 (n = 4), also is consistent with the value of that parameter taken from the time course data (0.055 ± 0.020 min−1, n = 3). Interaction of a G protein and GAP is most readily analyzed by considering the GAP to be an “enzyme” that catalyzes conversion of Gα·GTP to Gα·GDP and which displays a characteristicK m and V max. To determineK m while maximizing signal, we titrated a low concentration of the GαqR183C substrate with excess PLC-β1 (20Wang J. Tu Y. Mukhopadhyay S. Chidiac P. Biddlecome G.H. Ross E.M. Manning D.R. G Proteins: Techniques of Analysis. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1999: 123-151Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The K m was 1.5 ± 0.4 nm (n = 4). This value is similar to both the EC50 for the GAP activity of PLC-β1 during steady-state GTP hydrolysis (1–2 nm) (7Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7999-8007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and with the EC50 for stimulation of the phospholipase activity of PLC-β1 by detergent-solubilized Gαq·GTPγS (2–3 nm for both wild type and mutant; see also Ref. 16Berstein G. Blank J.L. Smrcka A.V. Higashijima T. Sternweis P.C. Exton J.H. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8081-8088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The identity of these three values suggests that they all approximate theK d for the binding of PLC-β1 to the activated form of Gαq, wild type or mutant. We also attempted to determine the K m for RGS4 and GαqR183C. Although RGS4 stimulated the GTPase rate of GαqR183C to a higher maximum, its K mwas also much higher, at least 50 nm. Although we did not adequately demonstrate saturation, this estimate is consistent with the elevated EC50 of 100 nm determined for RGS4 and wild type Gq when assayed at steady-state in a receptor-Gq proteoliposome system (29Posner B.A. Mukhopadhyay S. Tesmer J.J. Gilman A.G. Ross E.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). At saturation (V max), PLC-β1 accelerated hydrolysis of GαqR183C·GTP 20-fold in the experiment shown in Fig. 2, and its average maximal stimulation was 15-fold in four independent experiments. This is a smaller relative effect than that observed for steady-state GTPase activity with wild type Gq in the receptor-coupled system, which is often greater than 50-fold (7Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7999-8007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The difference may reflect an intrinsically weak effect of PLC on the mutant Gαq, which is also suggested by its sensitivity to interference by detergents. Alternatively, it might reflect potentiation of GAP activity in the vesicles by other components of the system (receptor, lipid etc.), which is consistent with the detection of GAP activities of some RGS proteins in the vesicle-based assay but not in detergent solution (26Ingi T. Krumins A.M. Chidiac P. Brothers G.M. Chung S. Snow B.E. Barnes C.A. Lanahan A.A. Siderovski D.P. Ross E.M. Gilman A.G. Worley P.F. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7178-7188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Posner B.A. Mukhopadhyay S. Tesmer J.J. Gilman A.G. Ross E.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In similar experiments, RGS4 accelerated the hydrolysis of GαqR183C-bound GTP over 100-fold, which compares favorably with its GAP activity toward wild-type Gαq at steady-state in receptor-Gq vesicles. RGS4 also accelerates GTP hydrolysis 50–100-fold for Gαi1, Gαi1R178C, or Gαo in single turnover assays (2Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). A major difference between the solution-phase, single-turnover GTPase assay described here and the steady-state, vesicle-based assay is the presence of Gβγ in the latter. We therefore investigated the effect of Gβγ on the Gq GAP activity of PLC-β1 in solution. Rather than increasing GAP activity, however, Gβγ inhibited the Gq GAP activity of both PLC-β1 and RGS4 nearly completely (Fig. 3). Gβγ inhibited Gq GAP activity with IC50 values of 150 nm for PLC-β1 and 60 nm for RGS4. Such inhibition by Gβγ is similar both in extent and in IC50to the inhibition of RGSZ1 and RGS4 acting on soluble Gαz(5Wang J. Ducret A. Tu Y. Kozasa T. Aebersold R. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26014-26025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 18Wang J. Tu Y. Woodson J. Song X. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5732-5740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Inhibition of GAP activity by Gβγ thus appears to be a general phenomenon for both RGS proteins and PLC-β. At least in the case of Gαz, inhibition by Gβγ appeared only as an increasedK m, which could indicate that binding of GAP and Gβγ to Gα-GTP is competitive, that GAP binds the Gαβγ trimer with low affinity or, least likely, that Gβγ binds to the GAP and allosterically decreases its affinity for the Gα·GTP substrate. Based on the structures of the Gαβγ heterotrimer and of the RGS4·Gαi1 complex, it is likely that Gβγ cannot bind Gαq·GTP simultaneously with either PLC-β or an RGS protein (27Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Alternatively, if simultaneous binding of a GAP and Gβγ is possible, it is of much diminished affinity. By either mechanism, the greater sensitivity of RGS4 to inhibition by Gβγ probably reflects its lower intrinsic affinity for the Gα·GTP substrate as indicated by its higher K m. The effect of Gβγ could not be accounted for by direct inhibition of catalysisper se. Although Gβγ did decrease the intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis of GαqR183C, the effect was small (data not shown), as reported for Gαz (18Wang J. Tu Y. Woodson J. Song X. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5732-5740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A paradox remains in that Gβγ inhibits GAP activity in single-turnover assays in detergent solution but is presumably required for agonist-promoted GDP/GTP exchange (28Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Nature. 1993; 365: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Competition between Gβγ and a GAP during the receptor-stimulated steady-state hydrolysis of GTP would imply that the two proteins simply take turns interacting with Gα. For this to occur, Gα would have to bind and release first Gβγ and then GAP, repetitively, at least as fast as both receptor-stimulated nucleotide exchange and GAP-stimulated hydrolysis. This seems unlikely given the observed GAP-stimulated turnover rates at steady-state (∼25 min−1 with PLC-β1). If a GAP does not have time to dissociate and be replaced by Gβγ during each catalytic cycle, then we are forced to one of two novel mechanisms. Either GAPs (RGS proteins or PLC-β) can substitute for Gβγ in supporting ongoing receptor-promoted GDP/GTP exchange on Gα, or Gβγ is not required once receptor and Gα have established productive contact. Kinetic evidence suggests that steady-state GTPase turnover is carried out by a receptor·G protein·PLC-β complex that is stable over the multiple GTPase cycle turnovers (7Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7999-8007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). If Gβγ and PLC-β1 do not bind Gαq simultaneously, then PLC-β, the effector/GAP, might displace Gβγ from Gαq during stimulation by receptor and take over the role of Gβγ to support receptor-driven GDP dissociation. This would leave Gβγ free to bind and further activate PLC-β and/or other Gβγ-sensitive effectors.

Zymosan-induced AA liberation was markedly inhibited by methyl arachidonoyl fluorophosphonate, a dual inhibitor of group IV cytosolic phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (cPLA<sub>2</sub>) and iPLA<sub>2</sub>. We found that a relatively specific iPLA<sub>2</sub> inhibitor, bromoenol lactone, significantly decreased the zymosan-induced AA liberation in parallel with the decrease in iPLA<sub>2</sub> activity, without an effect on diacylglycerol formation. Consistent with this, attenuation of iPLA<sub>2</sub> activity by a group VI iPLA<sub>2</sub> antisense oligonucleotide resulted in a decrease in zymosan-induced prostaglandin D<sub>2</sub> generation. These findings suggest that zymosan-induced AA liberation may be, at least in part, mediated by iPLA<sub>2</sub>. A protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor diminished zymosan-induced AA liberation, while a PKC activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), enhanced the liberation. Bromoenol lactone suppressed the PMA-enhanced AA liberation without any effect on PMA-induced PKC activation. Down-regulation of PKCα on prolonged exposure to PMA also decreased zymosan-induced AA liberation. Under these conditions, the remaining AA liberation was insensitive to bromoenol lactone. Furthermore, the PKC depletion suppressed increases in iPLA<sub>2</sub> proteins and the activity in the membrane fraction of zymosan-stimulated cells. In contrast, the zymosan-induced increases in iPLA<sub>2</sub> proteins and the activity in the fraction were facilitated by simultaneous addition of PMA. Although intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion prevented zymosan-induced AA liberation, the translocation of PKCα to membranes was also inhibited. Taken together, we propose that zymosan may stimulate iPLA<sub>2</sub>-mediated AA liberation, probably through a PKC-dependent mechanism."

NADPH oxidase catalyzes reduction of molecular oxygen to superoxide with electrons derived from NADPH (1Thrasher A.J. Keep N.H. Wientjes F. Segal A.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1227: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Superoxide itself is a weak oxidant but is converted by enzymatic and nonenzymatic pathways to more potent oxidants including hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical, hypohalous acids, and other reactive oxygen species (2Miller R.A. Britigan B.E. J. Invest. Med. 1995; 43: 39-49PubMed Google Scholar). Neutrophils localize NADPH oxidase to the phagolysosomal membrane surrounding engulfed microbes, which in theory limits oxidation of host proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. It is not surprising that formation of the NADPH oxidase is controlled precisely to minimize inappropriate activation of superoxide generation in the absence of infection (1Thrasher A.J. Keep N.H.

Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The catalytic core of NADPH oxidase is the integral membrane protein cytochrome b 558 that consists of equimolar amounts of gp91phox and p22phox subunits in a 1:1 complex (4Huang J. Hitt N. Kleinberg M.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16753-16757Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 5Wallach T.M. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).

However, cytochromeb 558 is inactive in the absence of at least three cytosol proteins p47phox, p67phox, and Rac1 (or Rac2) that translocate to membrane and bind cytochromeb 558 coincident with stimulation of neutrophil pathways that elicit generation of superoxide (3DeLeo F.R.

A positively charged arginine- and lysine-rich (Arg/Lys) domain is located in the p47phox C terminus between the SH3B domain and the C-terminal proline-rich sequence.

To test the contributions of phosphorylations of individual serines to overall p47phoxactivity, Faust et al. (28Faust L.P. El Benna J. Babior B.M. Chanock S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) constructed a series of p47phox mutants with alanine substitutions for every individual p47phox serine between residues 303 and 379. EBV-transformed B lymphocytes derived from a patient with the p47phox-deficient form of chronic granulomatous disease were transfected with the alanine-substituted p47phox cDNA. No superoxide was generated by p47phox-deficient EBV B cells expressing p47phox S379A stimulated with phorbol esters. EBV B cells expressing mutated p47phox with S303A, S304A, S310A, and S328A mutations generated less than 50% of wild-type oxidase activity. p47phox S320A supported wild-type levels of NADPH oxidase activity, whereas S315A, S345A, S348A, and S370A mutations resulted in only moderate decreases in superoxide generation. In contrast, alanine substitutions at any serine had no effect on p47phox activityin vitro consistent with the observation that the p47phox C terminus containing the Arg/Lys domain is not required to reconstitute oxidase activity in the cell-free NADPH oxidase assay (27Hata K. Takashige K. Sumimoto H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report that the Arg/Lys domain maintains p47phox in an inactive state that does not interact spontaneously with cytochrome b 558. Our data suggest that phosphorylation of serines within the Arg/Lys domain activates p47phox by unmasking the p47phoxSH3A domain enabling binding to the p22phoxC-terminal proline-rich region.

John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 13.14.1-13.14.17Google Scholar). cDNA encoding p22phox C terminus (residues 135–195), p22phox C terminus (residues 135–195), P156Q, p47phox, and p67phox cDNA were gifts from Thomas Leto (NIAID, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). cDNA encoding full-length p47phox (native sequence and serine-substituted mutants), p47phox SH3A domain (p47SH3A), p47phoxSH3B domain (p47SH3B), p47phox SH3ABtandem domains (p47SH3AB) (see Fig. 1), and full-length p67phox (p67) were cloned into pJG4-5 and expressed as B42 activation domain (ad) fusion proteins. cDNA encoding p67, p22phox C terminus (p22CT), p22phox C terminus P156Q (p22*CT), p47phox N terminus (p47NT), p47phox proline-rich region (p47P), p47phox C terminus (p47CT), and p47phox Arg/Lys domain (p47Arg/Lys) (Fig. 1) were cloned into pEG202 and expressed as LexA binding domain (bd) fusion proteins. cDNAs for p47phox and p67phox fragments were constructed by polymerase chain reaction or by cleaving full-length p47phox and p67phox cDNA at internal endonuclease restriction sites. Mutations in p47phox were introduced using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Correct sequences of all cDNA were verified by DNA sequencing performed in the Biopolymer Laboratory at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. EGY48 was transformed with pJG4-5, pEG202, and pSH18-34 using lithium acetate as described (29Golemis E.A. Gyuris J. Brent R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seigman J.G. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 13.14.1-13.14.17Google Scholar). Expression of LexA and B42 fusion proteins in EGY48 was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (12Faris S.L. Rinckel L.A. Huang J. Hong Y. Kleinberg M.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Prototrophy in leucine-deficient media indicated reconstitution of LexA transactivator function and transcription of the LEU2 reporter (29Golemis E.A. Gyuris J. Brent R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R.

Neutrophil membrane and cytosol fractions were prepared as described (30Kleinberg M.E. Mital D. Rotrosen D. Malech H.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2686-2690Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Peptides were synthesized by the Biopolymer Laboratory at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. Final peptide purity was >90% estimated by high pressure liquid chromatography. Correct sequence of synthesized peptides was confirmed by mass spectrometry. The cell-free assay for superoxide generation was performed in 96-well microtiter plates with a final volume of 100 μl/well. Cytosol (2 × 106 cell equivalent) and synthetic peptides were added to individual wells prior to activation by adding a reaction mixture containing neutrophil membrane (1 × 107 cell equivalent), FAD (1 μm), NADPH (200 μm), GTPγS (10 μm), and arachidonic acid (30 μm) (30Kleinberg M.E. Mital D. Rotrosen D. Malech H.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2686-2690Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Membrane was solubilized with deoxycholate (1:12 w/w). The maximal rate of superoxide formation (V max) was obtained by calculating the maximal rate of superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochromec monitored at 550 nm using a Molecular Devices (Menlo Park, CA) Thermomax kinetic microtiter plate reader. All experiments were repeated at least three times. IC50 (concentration of peptide that inhibited 50% of NADPH oxidase activity) was calculated as described (30Kleinberg M.E. Mital D. Rotrosen D. Malech H.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2686-2690Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recombinant p47NT-SH3AB (residues 1–285) and Rac1 C189S were expressed in DH5α Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, purified, and cleaved from GST with thrombin as described (31Menard L. Snyderman R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13357-13361Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Recombinant full-length p47phox and p67phox were expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells and purified as described (32Leto T.L. Garrett M.C. Fujii H. Nunoi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19812-19818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (20 μl) bound with GST-p22CT, GST-p22*CT, and p47CT were washed and resuspended in 250 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm sodium phosphate, 1.4 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4) containing 0.2% Tween 20. Synthetic peptides and p47SH3AB were added, and the final volume was adjusted to 500 μl with deionized water. Final concentrations of peptides and p47phox SH3AB were 250 μm and 1.5 μg/ml, respectively. The mixture was gently tumbled at room temperature for 2 h and washed three times with 2-fold diluted phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20. The beads were pelleted, resuspended in 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207012) Google Scholar), and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 4–20% Tris glycine gels (NOVEX, San Diego, CA) and transferred onto Immobilon P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS (20 mm Tris, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.5) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were incubated with 1:2500 goat anti-p47phox antibody for 1 h at room temperature, washed extensively, and incubated with phosphatase-conjugated 1:5000 rabbit anti-goat IgG (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) for 1 h at room temperature. Protein bands were visualized with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium phosphatase substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories). Full-length p47phox does not bind spontaneously to cytochrome b 558 in the absence of activation despite affinity of the p47phox N-terminal SH3Adomain for the p22phox C-terminal protein-rich region (21Leto T.L.

EGY48 expressing full-length p47phox/B42 ad and the p22phox C-terminal/LexA bd did not grow on leucine-deficient media (see below) in contrast to yeast expressing p47phoxSH3AB/or p47phox SH3A/B42 ad with the p22phoxC-terminal/LexA bd (Fig. 2 a). We hypothesized that access to the SH3A domain is blocked in full-length p47phox by another region of p47phoxthat obstructs the SH3A domain binding groove. The abilities of N-terminal and C-terminal p47phox truncations to bind to the p47phox SH3 domains were tested in the yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 2 b). p47phox truncations containing the C-terminal Arg/Lys-rich domain bound p47phoxSH3AB. p47P, which encompasses the p47phox C-terminal proline-rich peptide, bound p47SH3A but not p47SH3AB. We investigated which regions within the p47phox Arg/Lys domain bound the SH3AB domains. Several laboratories reported that synthetic peptides corresponding to Arg/Lys domain sequences inhibited NADPH oxidase activity in vitro (35Nauseef W.M. McCormick S. Renee J. Leidal K.G. Clark R.A.

We synthesized peptides corresponding to Arg/Lys domain sequences encompassing p47phox serines 310 and 328. Immobilized GST-p47phox C terminus (p47CT) consisting of the Arg/Lys domain plus the C-terminal proline-rich region was incubated with p47phox SH3AB domains (p47SH3AB) with and without p47phox peptides-(301–320) and -(314–335) (Fig. 3). Both peptides blocked co-precipitation of p47SH3AB by GST-p47CT. p47phoxpeptide-(358–385), corresponding to the p47phox C-terminal proline-rich region, did not block co-precipitation of p47SH3AB by GST-p47CT. Both Arg/Lys domain peptides also blocked co-precipitation of p47SH3AB by GST-p22CT (Fig. 4) even though the p47phox Arg/Lys domain does not bind the p22phox C terminus in yeast two-hybrid or affinity precipitation experiments (data not shown). p47phoxArg/Lys-(314–335)-peptide was equivalent to p22phox-(149–165), a peptide corresponding to the p22phox proline-rich sequence, which would be expected to be a competitive inhibitor of p47SH3AB/p22CT binding (Fig.4 b).Figure 4p47phox Arg/Lys-(301–320)- and -(314–335)-peptides block binding of p47SH3AB to p22CT by immunoblot analysis. GST-p22CT immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads was incubated with p47SH3AB with and without native and phosphorylated Arg/Lys-(301–320)-peptides (a) and -(314–335)-peptides (b) as described under “Material and Methods.” GST-p22*CT was substituted for GST-p22CT in the control lane. Immobilized proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and incubated with anti-p47phox serum. Scrambled peptides corresponding to Arg/Lys-(301–320) and -(314–335) were substantially less potent in their abilities to block co-precipitation of p47SH3AB by GST-p22CT compared with native sequence peptides (data not shown). Figure shown is representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Additional p47phox Arg/Lys-(301–320)- and -(314–335)-peptides with phosphoserines substituted for serines 310 and 328 were used to assess the effects of phosphorylation of serines 310 and 328 on p47phox Arg/Lys domain function. In contrast to p47phoxArg/Lys-(314–335), p47phox Arg/Lys-(314–335)-S328pS, containing a single phosphoserine substitution for serine 328, did not inhibit co-precipitation of p47SH3AB by GST-p22CT (Fig. 4 b). A similar Arg/Lys domain peptide with three phosphoserine substitutions at serines 315, 320, and 328 did not inhibit p47SH3AB/p22CT binding. Substitution of phosphoserine for serine 310 decreased inhibition of p47SH3AB/p22CT binding by p47phox Arg/Lys-(301–320)-S310pS compared with wild-type Arg/Lys-(301–320)-peptide (Fig.4 a). Similarly, phosphorylated p47phoxArg/Lys-(301–320)- and -(314–335)-peptides were less potent inhibitors of p47SH3AB/p47CT binding compared with wild-type Arg/Lys peptides (Fig. 3). We examined the effects of p47phox serines 310 and 328 on p47phox binding to the p22phox C terminus in the yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 5). Mutations substituting alanines and aspartic acids at serines 310 and 328 were introduced into p47phox cDNA. Alanine substitutions were used to assess the effects of serine loss since alanine presents a steric profile similar to serine but has neutral polarity and cannot form hydrogen bonds. Aspartic acid substitutions mimic the negative charges that occur with phosphorylations of serines. In contrast to wild-type p47phox, both p47phox S310A/and p47phox S310D/B42 ad interacted with p22phoxC-terminal/LexA bd in the two-hybrid assay (Fig. 5). Binding of full-length p47phox S328A to the p22phox C terminus was not substantially different from wild-type p47phox. However, the S328D mutation enabled p47phox/p22phox C-terminal binding. The p47phox S310D/S328D double mutant also bound p22phox C terminus. Substituted p47phox/p22phox C-terminal binding was SH3 domain-dependent since no binding was seen to p22phox P156Q C terminus. Serine 310 and 328 substitutions did not affect binding of the p47phox C-terminal proline-rich region to the p67phox C-terminal SH3B. The effects of p47phox Arg/Lys domain peptides-(301–320) and -(314–335) on NADPH oxidase activity were tested in the cell-free assay (Fig. 6) using membrane and cytosol fractions isolated from resting neutrophils. Levels of NADPH oxidase activity were quantitated as maximal rates of superoxide generation (V max) expressed as milliOD/min (Fig. 6).V max was measured with varying concentrations of wild-type and phosphorylated p47phox Arg/Lys domain peptides. Wild-type p47phox-(301–320)- and -(314–335)-peptides inhibited superoxide production in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 values among the lowest reported for peptide inhibitors of NADPH oxidase activation (TableI). Phosphorylated p47phoxArg/Lys peptides were 7–20-fold less potent inhibitors of NADPH oxidase activity compared with wild-type peptides (Table I).Table IEffect of phosphorylation of synthetic p47phox Arg/Lys domain peptides on inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity in vitroPeptide sequenceIC50μmp47phox-(301–320)7.0 ± 0.3p47phox-(301–320) S310pS41 ± 2p47phox-(306–325)25 ± 1p47phox-(314–335)6.7 ± 0.3p47phox-(314–335) S328pS44 ± 2p47phox-(314–335) S(315,320,328)pS130 ± 9IC50 values were determined by fitting V max versus peptide concentration data to the modified Hill equation by nonlinear least squares fit using the Enzfitter program (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK) as described (30Kleinberg M.E.

Open table in a new tab IC50 values were determined by fitting V max versus peptide concentration data to the modified Hill equation by nonlinear least squares fit using the Enzfitter program (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK) as described (30Kleinberg M.E.

The role of the p47phox Arg/Lys domain in activating the NADPH oxidase was examined further in a cell-free system with recombinant p67phox, Rac1 C189S, and p47NT-SH3AB (instead of full-length p47phox) used in place of neutrophil cytosol. p47NT-SH3AB spanning amino acids 1–285 is a truncated p47phox consisting of the N terminus plus both SH3 domains but missing the Arg/Lys domain and the rest of the C terminus. Hata et al. (27Hata K. Takashige K. Sumimoto H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) reported that a similar truncated N-terminal p47phox was active in the cell-free assay indicating that the p47phox Arg/Lys domain was not required absolutely for activating the oxidase in vitro. Superoxide generation in vitro using p47NT-SH3AB was equivalent with and without arachidonic acid (Fig.7). In contrast to p47NT-SH3AB, full-length p47phox was completely inactive without arachidonic acid (Fig. 7 b). The abilities of p47phox Arg/Lys domain-(301–320)- and -(314–335)-peptides to inhibit this p47NT-SH3AB-containing cell-free system was not dependent on arachidonic acid. These results indicate that the abilities of Arg/Lys domain peptides to inhibit oxidase activity in vitro do not require the p47phox Arg/Lys domain. This suggests that these peptides do not inhibit oxidase activity by interfering with some function of the Arg/Lys domain in full-length p47phox. NADPH oxidase function requires activation of dormant p47phox by phosphorylation of one or more serines clustered in the Arg/Lys domain in the C terminus. Considerable insight into p47phox function has been gained in the last few years. p47phox is not absolutely required for NADPH oxidase activityin vitro. Normal amounts of superoxide are generated in the cell-free system using neutrophil membrane containing cytochromeb 558, GTP-bound Rac, and very high concentrations of p67phox (8Freeman J.L.

These observations suggest that access by the p22phoxproline-rich region to the p47phox SH3A domain is blocked in unphosphorylated p47phox. The requirement for arachidonic acid or SDS in the cell-free system is obviated by using p47phox phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase C (17Park J.-W. Hoyal C.R. el Benna J. Babior B.M. J. Biol.

We hypothesized that unmasking the p47phox SH3Adomain-binding site requires disruption of binding between the p47phox C terminus and the two SH3 domains. We found that the p47phox Arg/Lys domain bound p47SH3AB in a survey of potential p47phox-binding sites using the yeast two-hybrid assay. This result was confirmed in affinity precipitation experiments where GST-p47CT co-precipitated p47SH3AB (Fig. 3). The p47phox C terminus contains a proline-rich region in addition to the Arg/Lys domain. Several laboratories identified the p47phoxproline-rich region as the ligand for the p67phox C-terminal SH3 domain (20Finan P. Shimizu Y. Gout I. Hsuan J. Truong O. Butcher C. Bennett P.

A. 1994; 91: 10650-10654Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In the yeast two-hybrid assay, we found that the p47phox proline-rich region bound p47SH3A but not p47SH3B or p47SH3AB. This result is in partial agreement with observations by de Mendez et al. (19de Mendez I. Homayounpour N. Leto T.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2177-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) who showed that GST-p47SH3A, but not GST-p47SH3B, bound full-length p47phox. These authors assumed that the p47phox proline-rich region was the ligand for p47phox SH3A domain binding site. Synthetic Arg/Lys domain peptides-(301–320) and -(314–335) inhibited co-precipitation of p47SH3AB by GST-p47CT in contrast to p47phox proline-rich peptide-(358–385). These two Arg/Lys domain peptides were potent inhibitors of NADPH oxidase activityin vitro (Table I) in contrast to the p47phoxproline-rich peptide (data not shown). The p47phox Arg/Lys domain is the critical determinant for p47phox C-terminal binding to the p47phox SH3AB domains. The p47phox proline-rich region failed to bind p47phoxSH3AB in the yeast two-hybrid experiments, and the p47phox proline-rich region peptide did not block p47phox C-terminal/SH3AB binding nor inhibit superoxide production. This result is not surprising; if phosphorylation toggles the p47phox activation switch, then the Arg/Lys domain that encompasses most of the phosphorylated p47phox serines should be intimately involved in p47phox internal binding. In this study, the effects of phosphorylation were examined directly using synthetic p47phox Arg/Lys domain peptides where serines 310 and 328 were replaced by phosphoserines. Phosphoserine-substituted peptides were uniformly less able than wild-type Arg/Lys-(301–320)- and -(314–335)-peptides to block co-precipitation of p47SHAB by GST-p22CT and GST-p47CT and to inhibit cell-free superoxide generation. Phosphoserines cannot be substituted directly for p47phoxserines 310 and 328 in the yeast two-hybrid binding experiments. Instead, we examined the effects of alanine and aspartic acid substitutions at serines 310 and 328 in full-length p47phoxmutants. Analysis of these substitutions in full-length p47phoxovercomes problems with using truncated proteins in binding assays where some aspects of biological specificity may be lost (3DeLeo F.R. Quinn M.T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The SH3A domains in p47phox S310D and p47phoxS328D both bound p22phox proline-rich regions in the two-hybrid assay suggesting that introducing a single negative charge at either of these two positions is sufficient to disrupt p47phox Arg/Lys domain binding to the SH3AB domains. Alanine substitution at serines 310 and 328 yielded different results. p47phox S328A did not bind to the SH3AB domains indicating that loss of the serine 328 hydroxyl group was not sufficient to disrupt Arg/Lys domain binding to the SH3AB domains. In contrast, p47phox S310A interacted with the SH3AB domains in the two-hybrid assay. This suggests that the serine 310 hydroxyl side group may participate directly in an interaction that stabilizes Arg/Lys domain to the SH3AB domain. The abilities of Arg/Lys peptides-(301–320) and -(314–335) to block co-precipitation of p47SH3AB by GST-p22CT was surprising since the p47phox Arg/Lys domain does not bind to p22phox (data not shown) and does not bind to the binding groove in the p47phox SH3A domain (Fig. 2 b). p47SH3AB is equivalent to p47SH3A in its ability to bind the p22phoxproline-rich region (Fig. 2 a) suggesting that p47SH3AB exists normally in an open conformation where access to the p47phox SH3A domain is unimpeded. Masking the SH3A domain within full-length p47phox involves adoption of a new conformation by the two p47phox SH3 domains in concert such that the binding groove of the SH3A domain is no longer accessible. Binding to the Arg/Lys domain locks p47phox SH3AB in this closed conformation (Fig.8). Stimulation of phagocytes leads to phosphorylation of serines within the p47phox C terminus and disruption of this internal interaction. Phosphorylated p47phoxthen relaxes into the open conformation characteristic of p47SH3AB with unmasking of the SH3A domain, binding to p22phox, and activation of the NADPH oxidase. Internal binding of the p47phox Arg/Lys domain to the p47phox SH3AB domains appears to be sufficient to block spontaneous activation of the NADPH oxidase in the cell-free system. The requirement for arachidonic acid as the exogenous activator was bypassed when truncated N-terminal p47phox lacking the Arg/Lys and proline-rich domains was substituted for full-length p47phox (Fig. 7). Inhibition of superoxide generation by p47phox Arg/Lys-(301–320) and -(314–335) was also not dependent on arachidonic acid activation since both peptides inhibited oxidase activity in the cell-free system without arachidonic acid. p47phox SH3AB domain binding to the Arg/Lys domain is not dependent on other loci within the p47phox C terminus (such as the p47phox proline-rich region) since Arg/Lys peptides-(301–320) and -(314–335) inhibited oxidase activity with p47NT-SH3AB. An alternative model for function of the p47phox Arg/Lys domain is that phosphorylation of one or more serines creates a ligand recognized by a binding site on another Phox protein. This would be analogous to how phosphotyrosines are recognized by SH2 domains. Our findings that phosphoserine-containing Arg/Lys peptides are uniformly less potent than native peptides in binding and cell-free oxidase activity experiments argue against this model. A more complex model was presented by DeLeo et al. (36DeLeo F.R. Nauseef W.M. Jesaitis A.J. Burritt J.B. Clark R.A. Quinn M.T. J. Biol.

They found several peptides with sequences similar to Arg/Lys domain amino acids compassing serine 328 using purified cytochrome b 558 and recombinant p67phox as baits in screens of a phage display library. p47phox Arg/Lys peptides inhibited p47phoxphosphorylation, translocation of p47phox to membrane in vitro, and superoxide generation in vitro and in permeabilized neutrophils. These experimental findings are consistent with our findings. The fact that we and others (27Hata K. Takashige K. Sumimoto H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) can reconstitute NADPH oxidase activity in vitro using p47NT-SH3AB lacking the Arg/Lys domain indicates that the Arg/Lys domain is not required absolutely for activity in the cell-free system. Arg/Lys peptides inhibited oxidase activity in the cell-free system with p47NT-SH3AB indicating that the peptides are not acting as competitive inhibitors of the native p47phox Arg/Lys domain. Rather, Arg/Lys domain peptides mimic the p47phox Arg/Lys domain in vitro. In our model (Fig. 8), the p47phox Arg/Lys domain functions normally to inhibit activation of the oxidase. Therefore, peptides that mimic activity of the Arg/Lys domain also inhibit the oxidase. We anticipate that the situation in cells will be more complicated and that transfection studies using mutated full-length p47phoxwill prove useful in furthering understanding of p47phoxfunction."

In these proteins, a conserved region is located between the amino-terminal domain, which is the target for phosphorylation, and the catalytic domain. Previous studies have indicated that nested deletions encompassing this region cause an increase in catalytic activity, suggesting this domain exerts an inhibitory constraint on catalysis. Here, we have further investigated the presence and function of this domain. A time-dependent increase in hydrolytic activity was observed when PDE4D3 from FRTL-5 cells was incubated with the endoproteinase Lys-C. The activation was abolished by protease inhibitors and was absent when a phosphorylated enzyme was used. Western blot analysis with PDE4D-specific antibodies indicated the Lys-C treatment separates the catalytic domain of PDE4D3 from the inhibitory domain. Incubation with antibodies recognizing an epitope within this domain caused a 3- to 4-fold increase in activity of native or recombinant PDE4D3. Again, PDE activation by these antibodies had properties similar to, and not additive with, the activation by protein kinase A phosphorylation. An interaction between the inhibitory domain and both regulatory and catalytic domains of PDE4D3 was detected by the yeast two-hybrid system. Mutations of Ser54 to Ala in the regulatory domain decreased or abolished this interaction, whereas mutations of Ser54 to the negatively charged Asp strengthened it. These data strongly support the hypothesis that an inhibitory domain is present in PDE4D and that phosphorylation of the regulatory domain causes activation of the enzyme by modulating the interaction between inhibitory and catalytic domains.

Diffusing from the site of synthesis where adenylyl cyclases are located, the cyclic nucleotide binds to the regulatory subunits of the oligomeric PKA1 (1Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 237-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) or to binding sites on cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (2Goulding E.H. Tibbs G.R. Siegelbaum S.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The cyclic nucleotide binding and subsequent changes in conformation of these intracellular effectors are thought to be at the basis of most, if not all, cAMP effects on cell function. Alternatively, cAMP is degraded by phosphodiesterases, enzymes that inactivate and terminate the cAMP signaling (3Beavo J.A. Conti M. Heaslip P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 399-405PubMed Google Scholar, 4Beavo J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar). Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) belong to a large superfamily of enzymes regulated by a number of signal transduction pathways including the cAMP-signaling pathway (5Conti M. Nemoz G. Sette C. Vicini E. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 370-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Elegant work with nonhydrolyzable cAMP analogs (6Gettys T.W. Blackmore P.F. Redmon J.B. Beebe S.J.

Despite the several hypotheses proposed to explain this phenomenon, the exact function of this feedback mechanism in the cell remains uncertain. It may represent a dampening mechanism to prevent overstimulation, a mechanism for termination of the stimulus or a means by which the cells increase the sensitivity of responses. Although it was originally thought that a cGMP-inhibited phosphodiesterase (PDE3) is the enzyme involved in this feedback control of cAMP levels (8Macphee C.H. Reifsnyder D.H. Moore T.A. Lerea K.M.

A short term activation of a PDE4 has been observed in thyroid cells where TSH-dependent activation of PKA leads to phosphorylation and activation of PDE4D3, a splicing variant derived from the pde4d gene (11Sette C. Iona S. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9245-9252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sette C. Conti M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1980; 255: 2962-2968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), aortic smooth muscle cells (14Ekholm D. Belfrage P. Manganiello V. Degerman E. Biochim. Biophys.

Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 1739-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), underscoring the ubiquitous nature of this regulation. The exact mechanism by which phosphorylation causes the activation of PDE4D3 is unknown. Upon inspection of the sequence of the PDE4D3 splicing variant, it is evident that the catalytic domain, which is highly conserved in all PDEs, is flanked by two additional domains.In vitro phosphorylation and site-directed mutagenesis have identified a regulatory domain target for phosphorylation at the amino terminus of the rat PDE4D3 (12Sette C. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16526-16534Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). This domain coincides with a region named upstream conserved region 1 (UCR1) (18Bolger G. Michaeli T. Martins T. St. John T. Steiner B. Rodgers L. Riggs M. Wigler M. Ferguson K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6558-6571Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) conserved in different PDE4s. The regulatory domain lies upstream of an additional domain conserved in all PDE4s (18Bolger G. Michaeli T. Martins T. St. John T. Steiner B. Rodgers L. Riggs M. Wigler M. Ferguson K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6558-6571Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 19Swinnen J.V. Tsikalas K.E. Conti M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1993; 13: 6558-6571Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Of the splicing variants derived from the pde4d gene, PDE4D1 contains the entire UCR2 but lacks the phosphorylation domain, whereas the PDE4D2 splicing variant contains only a portion of the UCR2 domain. The so-called long variants, PDE4D3, PDE4D4, and PDE4D5, contain both domains as well as unique amino terminus regions (5Conti M. Nemoz G. Sette C. Vicini E. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 370-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 21Bolger G.B. Erdogan S. Jones R.E. Loughney K. Scotland G. Hoffmann R. Wilkinson I. Farrell C. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). During studies to map the boundaries of the catalytic domain, it was observed that nested deletions removing the conserved region corresponding to UCR2 of PDE4D1 yield an enzyme with increased catalytic activity (22Jin S.L. Swinnen J.V. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18929-18939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further deletion mutagenesis studies in PDE4D1 (23Kovala T. Sanwal B.D. Ball E.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2968-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and a PDE4A (24Jacobitz S. McLaughlin M.M. Livi G.P. Burman M. Torphy T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 891-899PubMed Google Scholar) have strengthened this hypothesis that a domain constraining the catalytic capacity of PDE4 is present upstream of the catalytic domain. These findings on PDE4s are in line with earlier observations on the calmodulin-regulated PDE (PDE1) and the cGMP-stimulated PDE (PDE2). Controlled proteolytic cleavage of these enzymes yields a constitutively activated catalytic fragment, indicating that calmodulin or cGMP binding alters the interaction of an inhibitory domain with the catalytic domain (25Tucker M.M. Robinson Jr., J.B. Stellwagen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9051-9058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kincaid R.L. Stith-Coleman I.E. Vaughan M. J. Biol.

From the data accumulated thus far, it is unclear whether the inhibitory domain coincides with the regulatory domain or whether a separate inhibitory domain does indeed exist in the PDE4D variants. Previous attempts to measure the catalytic activity of purified full-length enzymes or enzymes with truncations in the putative inhibitory domain have yielded inconsistent results because PDE4D3 is often inactivated during purification. Here we have used several alternative strategies to investigate the presence of an inhibitory domain in a PDE4D3. Our findings lend further support to the hypothesis that an inhibitory domain is present within the conserved region of PDE4 (UCR2) and that this domain mediates the phosphorylation-dependent activation of the enzyme. Yeast strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and cloning vectors for the yeast two-hybrid system (29Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar) were obtained from CLONTECH, (Palo Alto, CA) (Match Maker I and II), yeast media was from Difco, Inc. (Angsburg, Germany), and amino acids and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole were from Sigma. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and DNA-modifying enzymes and PCR reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. or Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). All the other reagents were of the highest analytical grade available and were purchased from Sigma. The yeast strainsY190, HF7c, and Y187 were obtained from CLONTECH. Yeast transformations were performed using the lithium acetate method. Single transformants were spread on selection medium (SD-medium) lacking either Leu or Trp. Cotransformants were propagated on SD-medium containing adenosine (10 mg/ml) and 50 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole only, thus increasing the selection pressure for protein-protein interaction and suppressing His leakiness of Y190. In the mating experiment Y187 was used to mate with Y190. Rat PDE4D3 amino terminus (amino acids 1–113) encoding the regulatory domain was generated by PCR using a partial cDNA clone of rPDE4D3 as template. The clone contained several changes in the 5′ end of nucleotide sequence of rPDE4D3, which gave a single amino acid change. 2S-L. C. Jin, W.-P. Kuo, and M. Conti, submitted for publication. Forward and reverse oligonucleotides with added restriction sites and a stop codon were used (EcoRI: 5′-GCT GAA TTC ATG ATG CAT GTG AAT-3′; SW1 andSalI/TAG: 5′-TGA GTC GAC TAC TCC TCT GTG ATG GTG GCT TT-3′; GUPA2). The amplified fragment was cloned intoEcoRI/SalI site of pGBT9 (CLONTECH) downstream from the GAL4 binding domain (construct pGBT9/0.4 or R of Figs. 7 and 8).Figure 8Mapping of the subdomains present in the inhibitory domain of PDE4D3: interaction with the regulatory domain. Deletion mutations were introduced in the inhibitory domain of PDE4D3 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The deletion included the removal of the first α helical subdomain (PDEtruA), the second α helical subdomain (PDEtruB), and the domain containing the epitope recognized by the polyclonal antibody K116 (PDEtruC). These constructs were transfected together with the construct containing the regulatory domain in yeast. The interaction was monitored both as growth or β-galactosidase activity. The interaction was scored as described and reported in arbitrary units (+, interaction; −, no interaction).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A fragment encoding the putative autoinhibitory domain (UCR2) (amino acids 134–229) of rPDE4D3 was generated by PCR using a cDNA clone of rPDE4D3 as template. Forward and reverse oligonucleotides with added restriction sites were used (EcoRI: 5′-AGC GAA TTC GAG GAG GCC TAC CAG AAA CTA-3′; LIMSI and SalI: 5′-GAT GTC CGA CAC TGA TCT GTG ACA TCG GCC TT-3′; LIMAI). The amplified fragment was cloned into EcoRI/SalI site of pGBT9 (CLONTECH) downstream from the GAL4 binding domain (pGBT9 I construct in Fig. 9). A fragment encoding the autoinhibitory (UCR2), catalytic, and carboxyl-terminal domains of rPDE4D3 (amino acids 134-end) was amplified by PCR with the full-length cDNA using the following forward and reverse primers with incorporated restriction sites and a stop codon (EcoRI: 5′-CGG AAT TCG AGG AGG CCT ACC AGA AAC-′; GUPA4 and SalI/TAG: 5′-TGA GTC GAC TAC GTG TCA AGG CAA CAA TGG TC-3′; GUPA3). The PCR products were cloned intoEcoRI/SalI site of pGAD424 (CLONTECH) downstream of the Gal4 activation domain. The clone was named pGAD/1.6 (see Figs. 7 and 8). A switch in yeast expression vectors was also carried out by subcloning procedure. The PCR was performed in the presence of recombinant Pfupolymerase (Stratagene) at a low cycle number (10 cycles) to ensure high fidelity reading. The insertions were entirely sequenced to confirm the correct reading frame and sequence. Sequencing was performed by the Molecular Biology facility at Stanford University using the ABI PRISM dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase, FS (Perkin-Elmer). The fusion proteins were expressed in the yeast strainY190 (CLONTECH) of S. cerevisiae: Ura 3–25, his 3–200, lys 2–801, ade 2–101, trp 1–901, leu 2–3, 112, gal4Δ, gal80Δ, cyhr2, LYS2::GAL1UAS-HIS3TATA-HIS3, URA3::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-lacZ. Intrinsic transcriptional autoactivation of pGBT9/0.4 was determined by transformation alone or cotransformation with control plasmids containing the Gal4 transcriptional activation domain alone (pGAD424) or with other in-frame cDNAs such as the SV40 large T-antigene (pTD1, CLONTECH) or the isoform of 14–3-3 (pGADGH/14–3-3). The pGAD/1.6 construct was tested with the Gal4 binding domain alone (pGBT9) and murine p53 (pVA3–1,CLONTECH) or an apoptotic protein (pGBT9/BAD) expressed with the Gal4 binding site. No background for β-galactosidase activity was detected after overnight incubation at 30 °C. No histidine expression was observed for the cotransformants after 5 days of incubation at 30 °C on selection medium (SD-medium, yeast nitrogen base without amino acids 6.7 g/liter, pH 5.8, agar 18 g/liter, adenine 10 mg/liter, 2% dextrose, and 50 mm3-amino-1,2,4,-triazol). Subdomains present in the putative autoinhibitory domain of rPDE4D3 (Fig. 1) were progressively deleted to map the site of interaction between inhibitory and regulatory domain. Three constructs were generated by PCR amplification or restriction digestion of the full-length cDNA. Construct PDEtruA (see Fig. 8) containing amino acids 164-end and missing the first α-helical region of UCR2 was generated by PCR using the full-length cDNA of rPDE4D3 as a template and forward and reverse primers with incorporated restriction sites (EcoRI: 5′-CGG AAT TCT CCG TCA GTG AGA TGG C-3′; GP1 and SalI/Stop: GUPA3). In construct PDEtruB an additional amphipathic helix is deleted (amino acids 179-end; see Fig. 8). A forward primer (EcoRI: 5′-CGG AAT TCC TCA CCC ACC TCT CTG-3′; GP2) and reverse primer (SalI/Stop; GUPA3) was used. In construct PDEtruC (Fig. 8) containing amino acids 214-end, the epitope recognized by K116 was removed. In this latter case the forward primer was GP3:EcoRI: 5′-CGG AAT TCC AGA AGG AAA AAG AGA AG-3′, whereas the reverse primer again was GUPA3. The PCR products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and extracted using a gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The final constructs were obtained following a three-point ligation strategy using two fragments for subcloning. The fragments containing the truncations in UCR2 were digested withEcoRI and XbaI and again purified by gel electrophoresis. The second fragment was obtained by restriction digestion of the full-length cDNA of rPDE4D3 with XbaI and BglII. Both fragments were cloned into pGAD424 cut byEcoRI and BglII. Positive clones were sequenced up to the XbaI cloning site to confirm the correct reading frame and sequence of the PCR fragment. The complete inserts were also subcloned into the EcoRI site of pGBT9. The point mutation in the phosphorylation site of PDE4D3 was introduced in the pGBT9-PDE0.4 by transfer of a restriction fragment from a previously prepared construct (12Sette C. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16526-16534Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). For qualitative detection of β-galactosidase activity in the transformants, the colony-lift-filter assay was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol (CLONTECH). Blue colonies were developed after incubation at 30 °C. When the measurement of the interaction required quantification, liquid culture β-galactosidase assay witho-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG) as substrate was used. Yeast colonies expressing the different constructs were inoculated into 5 ml of SD-medium lacking Leu, Trp, and His and were grown overnight at 30 °C with shaking. The overnight culture (2 ml) was inoculated into 8 ml of yeast-peptone-glucose (YPD) liquid medium and was grown at 30 °C for 3–5 h until theA 600 of 1 ml reached 0.5–0.8. TheA 600 of 1 ml of the culture was measured and recorded. An aliquot (1.5 ml) of culture was taken and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 1 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was washed and resuspended in 1.5 ml of Z buffer containing 60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm MgSO4. The solution was centrifuged again at 14,000 rpm for 1 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 0.3 ml of Z buffer. The cell suspension (0.1 ml) was placed into a fresh microcentrifuge tube and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen cell was thawed in 37 °C water bath for 1 min. A 0.7 ml aliquot of Z buffer containing 0.27% β-mercaptoethanol was added to the reaction tubes, and then 0.16 ml of ONPG in Z buffer was added. ONPG was dissolved in Z buffer at 4 mg/ml for 1–2 h. After adding ONPG, the incubation time was measured to calculate β-galactosidase units. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C until a yellow color developed. To stop the reaction, 0.4 ml of 1 m Na2CO3 was added. The reaction tube was centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm to pellet cell debris. The supernatant was removed with care, and absorbance was measured at 420 nm. A unit of β-galactosidase activity is defined as the amount that hydrolyzes 1 μmol of ONPG too-nitrophenol and d-galactose/min (30Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase units were calculated as follows: β-galactosidase units = 1000 × A 20/(t× V × A 600), wheret = elapsed time (in min) of incubation,V = volume of the culture used for the assay, andA 600 = A 600 of 1 ml of culture. Yeast strain Y187: MATa, ura3–52, his3–200, ade 2–101, trp 1–901, leu 2–3, 112, gal4Δ, met−, gal80Δ, URA3:: GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-lacZwas single-transformed with pGBT9, pGBT/0.4, pGBT/1.6, pGBT/2kb, and pVA3 as the positive control and selected for Trp+transformants. The yeast strain, HF7c, was single-transformed with the AD-vector p GAD424 alone, with pGAD/0.4, pGAD/1.6, pGAD/2kb, and the control plasmid pTD1. Transformants were propagated on SD/-Leu. Single positive clones for Trp and Leu were separately streaked in strips on the corresponding SD-medium and incubated for 3–4 days at 30 °C. The different transformants of Trp+ and Leu+were replica-plated in a grid pattern on YPD medium and incubated for 1 day at 30 °C. Colonies of diploid cells were replica-plated on SD-medium lacking Leu, Trp, and His. His+ colonies were observed 6 days after incubation at 30 °C. LacZ expression was detected using the β-galactosidase colony-lift-filter assay. Cells were grown in Coon's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% calf serum, TSH (1 milliunit/ml), insulin (10 μg/ml), and transferrin (5 μg/ml) as previously reported (growth medium) (11Sette C. Iona S. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9245-9252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At 70–80% confluence, growth medium was removed, cells were rinsed two times with Hanks' buffered saline solution, and quiescent medium (Coon's F12 medium with 0.1% bovine serum albumin without insulin or TSH) was added to the cells. After 3 days in quiescent medium, cells were rinsed, and fresh medium was added to the cultures. After a 1-h equilibration, TSH (30 nm) or forskolin (100 μm) was added to some plates, whereas vehicle was added to the control plates. In those experiments where rolipram was used, the inhibitor was added at a final concentration of 10 μm for 15 min before the TSH addition. At the end of the treatment, cells were rinsed several times with PBS and harvested in homogenization buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, and 5.4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol with protease inhibitors including 0.01 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.01 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 50 mm benzamidine. Supernatants were prepared by microcentrifugation at maximum speed for 30 min at 4 °C. We have previously demonstrated that most of the PDE activity recovered in the supernatant of FRTL-5 cells corresponds to PDE4D3. Lys-C was used at a concentration of 0.1 μg/μl in buffer containing 50 mmTricine, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA. Crude extracts of PDE4D3 from FRTL-5 cells were prepared in homogenization buffer without protease inhibitors. The crude enzyme preparation was incubated with Lys-C (Sigma) in a ratio of 1:150 (w/w) at room temperature for 10 min. At the end of the incubation, the reaction was stopped by adding excess bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml), and aliquots of the reaction products were immediately used for the PDE assay. For the SDS-PAGE analysis of the Lys-C cleavage products, purified recombinant PDE4D3 was partially digested with Lys-C in a ratio of 1:100 (w/w) at room temperature for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. SDS-PAGE (10% gels) was used to separate the fragments was generated by Lys-C digestion. The recombinant PDE4D3 was expressed in Sf-9 cells using baculovirus as previously reported (12Sette C. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16526-16534Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody (M3S1) was used to purify the recombinant PDE4D3. After incubation for 3 days at 27 °C, Sf-9 cells were centrifuged at 100 × g for 10 min, and supernatant was discarded. The pellet was homogenized in homogenization buffer with protease inhibitors and centrifuged at 188,000 ×g for 40 min at 4 °C in an Ultracentrifuge (SW41Ti rotor, Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA). The supernatant was diluted 1:1 with sample binding/washing buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6) and then applied to a M3S1 affinity column. The column was rinsed with washing buffer until base-line absorbance at 280 nm was reached. The enzyme was eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.8, and the 500-μl fractions were neutralized with 1 m Tris-Cl, pH 10. The purified PDE4D3 was stored in the presence of 30% ethylene glycol at −20 °C for further analysis. The details of the preparation of the column and purification procedure were previously reported in Salanova et al. (31Salanova M. Jin C.S-C. Conti M. Methods. 1998; 14: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The purified PDE4D3 from Sf-9 cells had a specific activity of approximately 3–5 μmol/min/mg and showed a single 93-kDa band on SDS-PAGE. The properties of the purified recombinant PDE4D3 are similar to those of native PDE4D3 from FRTL-5 cells. The K mfor cAMP is ∼1.5 μm for both enzymes. They both are inhibited by rolipram with IC50 values of 10∼30 nm. Crude PDE4D3 extracts from FRTL-5 cells or purified recombinant PDE4D3 were diluted in 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The antibodies used included the polyclonal antipeptide antibodies (K111, K115, and K116) and the monoclonal antibody (M3S1) against PDE4D and the polyclonal antibody against the carboxyl terminus domain of PDE4A (AC55). The properties of these antibodies have been previously described (32Iona S. Cuomo M. Bushnik T. Naro F. Sette C. Hess M. Shelton E.R. Conti M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Antibodies were added at final concentrations ranging between 0.05 to 25 μl/ml incubation mixture. The samples were incubated for 1 h on ice with occasional mixing. At the end of the incubation, aliquots of the incubation were used for the PDE assay. The PDE activity was measured following the method of Thompson and Appleman (33Thompson W.J. Appleman M.M. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (34Conti M. Toscano M.V. Petrelli L. Geremia R. Stefanini M. Endocrinology. 1982; 10: 1189-1196Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In those experiments where antibody binding was blocked with the peptide used as an immunogen, the peptide was added at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. In the initial experiments, crude soluble preparations for FRTL-5 cells were the source of PDE4D3, because this is the enzyme most readily activated by phosphorylation. This PDE4D3 is the predominant form recovered in the soluble fraction of FRTL-5 cells as judged by DEAE-ion exchange chromatography and Western blot analysis (data not shown) (11Sette C. Iona S. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9245-9252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Jin C.S-L. Bushnik T. Lan L. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19672-19678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The crude PDE4D3 preparation from quiescent FRTL-5 cells was incubated with the endoproteinase Lys-C for times up to 60 min at room temperature, and PDE activity was measured. This treatment caused a time-dependent increase in PDE activity (Fig.2) with a greater than 4-fold increase observed after a 30-min incubation. A longer incubation time with Lys-C caused an overall reduction in activity, indicating a proteolytic inactivation of the catalytic domain. This increase in PDE activity is the result of the proteolysis because inclusion of protease inhibitors completely blocked the PDE activation (Fig.3). The activity recovered after proteolysis was completely inhibited by 10 μm rolipram (data not shown), confirming that a PDE4 is indeed affected by the digestion and that the treatment does not uncover unrelated cryptic PDE activity.Figure 3PDE4D3 activation by Lys-C treatment is blocked by protease inhibitors.

These data indicate for the first time that tryptases α and β/II are functionally different human proteases.

Human MCs express at least four closely related tryptases (designated human tryptases I, β/II, III, and α) 2Although the initial publication (2Miller J.S. Westin E.H. Schwartz L.B. J. Clin.

Although the amino acid sequences of the varied tryptases are ≥93% identical, there are at least four genes on human chromosome 16 that encode related but distinct tryptases (6Pallaoro M. Feizo M.S.

Hunt J. Stevens R.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1910-1919PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is presently unclear why human MCs express so many homologous tryptases. Native (15Schwartz L.B. Bradford T.R. Littman B.H. Wintroub B.U. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 2762-2767PubMed Google Scholar) and recombinant (16Ren S. Lawson A.E. Carr M. Baumgarten C.M. Schwartz L.B. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3540-3548PubMed Google Scholar) human tryptase β/II can degrade fibrinogen but whether or not human tryptase α is a functional enzyme is controversial. While normal human basophils contain a small amount of tryptase α protein (17Castells M.C. Irani A.M. Schwartz L.B. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 2184-2189PubMed Google Scholar) and mRNA (18Xia H.Z. Kepley C.L. Sakai K. Chelliah J. Irani A.M. Schwartz L.B. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5472-5480PubMed Google Scholar), substantial numbers of tryptase α+ cells have been found in the blood of patients with asthma, chronic allergies, or adverse drug reactions (19Li L. Li Y. Reddel S.W. Cherrian M. Friend D.S. Stevens R.L. Krilis S.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5079-5086PubMed Google Scholar). The level of tryptase α is also elevated in the sera of patients with systemic mastocytosis (20Schwartz L.B. Sakai K. Bradford T.R. Ren S. Zweiman B. Worobec A.S. Metcalfe D.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2702-2710Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Thus, whether or not tryptase α is a functional neutral protease in humans is of critical importance. Using an expression/site-directed mutagenesis approach, we now show that tryptases α and β/II are functional enzymes but that tryptase α exhibits a more restricted substrate specificity due to an alteration in one of the loops that forms its S1, S2, and S3 sites. Thus, like in the mouse, a primordial human tryptase gene duplicated a number of times to generate a family of functionally distinct granule proteases. Using a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction approach, cDNAs were isolated from human lung RNA (CLONTECH) that encode tryptases α and β/II. In each instance, synthesis of the first DNA strand was accomplished using total RNA, random primers, and avian myeloblastosis virus-derived reverse transcriptase. The tryptase α cDNA was amplified from the multitude of lung cDNAs in the preparation using oligonucleotides (5′-ATGCTGAGCCTGCTGCTG-3′ and 5′-TGACTCACGGCTTTTTGGG-3′) that correspond to relatively conserved sequences in the hydrophobic signal peptide and the C terminus of the tryptase transcript. The tryptase β/II cDNA was amplified using oligonucleotides 5′-GTGGCCAGGATGCTGAATCTG-3′ and 5′-TGACTCACGGCTTTTTGGG-3′. Each cycle of the polymerase chain reaction consisted of a 1-min denaturing step at 90 °C, a 2-min annealing step at 60 °C, and a 3-min extension step at 72 °C. The polymerase chain reaction products were purified on a 1% low melting point gel and ligated into the TA-cloning vector (Novagen, Milwaukee, WI). After Novablue competent cells were transformed with the plasmids, clones were isolated, and the nucleotide sequences of their inserts were determined to confirm that the isolated cDNAs encode authentic tryptases α and β/II. Recombinant human tryptases α and β/II were expressed as pseudozymogens in baculovirus-infected High FiveTM insect cells (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), as described previously for mMCP-6 (14Huang C. Friend D.S. Qiu W.-T. Wong G.W. Morales G. Hunt J. Stevens R.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1910-1919PubMed Google Scholar) and mMCP-7 (13Huang C. Wong G.W. Ghildyal N. Gurish M.F. S̆ali A. Matsumoto R. Qiu W.-T. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31885-31893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) pseudozymogens. We have shown previously that the C terminus does not influence substantially the enzymatic activity of mMCP-6 and mMCP-7 (13Huang C. Wong G.W. Ghildyal N. Gurish M.F. S̆ali A. Matsumoto R. Qiu W.-T. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31885-31893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 14Huang C. Friend D.S. Qiu W.-T. Wong G.W. Morales G. Hunt J. Stevens R.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1910-1919PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the 8-residue FLAG peptide was attached to the C terminus in order to facilitate the purification of each human tryptase pseudozymogen from the insect cell-conditioned medium. To enable the recombinant pseudozymogen to be activated after its purification at low pH, the enterokinase (EK)-susceptible peptide Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys was also placed in between the natural propeptide and the mature portion of the human tryptase. Purified plasmid DNA (∼5 μg) was mixed with ∼0.5 μg of linearized BaculoGoldTM DNA (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) and calcium phosphate. The resulting DNA solution was added to 3 × 106 adherent Spodoptera frugiperda 9 insect cells (Invitrogen) that were in their log phase of growth, and the infected cells were cultured for 7 days at 27 °C in medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS (Sigma). Recombinant virus particles (≥3 × 107) from these insect cells were added to a new culture dish containing 6 × 106 Trichoplusia ni High FiveTMinsect cells (Invitrogen) in their log phase of growth, and then the infected cells were cultured in serum-free, Xpress medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD). Generally 4 days later, the conditioned medium was centrifuged at 1500 × g for 15 min at room temperature before purification of the secreted recombinant protein was attempted. Asp215 resides in one of the loops predicted to form the substrate-binding cleft of tryptase α based on the crystallographic structures of pancreatic trypsin (21Walter J. Steigemann W. Singh T.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Sci. 1982; 38: 1462-1472Crossref Google Scholar) and tryptase β/II (22Pereira P.J. Bergner A. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Huber R. Matschiner G. Fritz H. Sommerhoff C.P. Bode W. Nature. 1998; 392: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). To evaluate the functional role of this amino acid, the bioengineered cDNA that encodes the pseudozymogen form of the tryptase was subcloned into the pALTER®-1 vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Altered Sites® II in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mutagenic oligonucleotide 5′-GTCAGCTGGGGCGAGGGCTGT-3′ (corresponding to nucleotides 724–744 in the isolated tryptase α cDNA) was used to convert Asp215 to Gly215. A similar site-directed mutagenesis approach was used to evaluate whether or not Arg−3 was essential for the proper folding and/or activation of recombinant tryptase β/II in our expression system. In these latter experiments, the mutagenic oligonucleotide 5′-CAGGCCCTGCAGCAAGTGGGC-3′ was used to convert Arg−3 to Gln−3 in the tryptase β/II pseudozymogen. MC tryptases bind to heparin in a conformation-dependent manner due to the alignment of a number of positively charged residues on the surface when the serine protease is properly folded (23Matsumoto R. S̆ali A. Ghildyal N. Karplus M. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19524-19531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Analogous to that carried out on recombinant pro-mMCP-7 (23Matsumoto R. S̆ali A. Ghildyal N. Karplus M. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19524-19531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), heparin-Sepharose chromatography was therefore used to evaluate whether or not recombinant tryptase β/II, tryptase α, and the D215G mutant of tryptase α were properly folded. Samples were applied to 3-ml columns of heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been equilibrated in 100 mm NaCl and 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0. After each column was washed with 10 ml of equilibration buffer, the column was subjected to a 40-ml gradient in which the NaCl concentration was increased linearly from 0.1 to 4.0 m. The 1-ml eluate fractions were evaluated for their protein content; samples were also subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-FLAG Ig. An immunoaffinity column (24Brizzard B.L. Chubet R.G. Vizard D.L. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 730-735PubMed Google Scholar) (International Biotechnol. Inc., New Haven, CT) was used to purify recombinant tryptase α, the D215G mutant of tryptase α, tryptase β/II, and the R-3Q mutant of tryptase β/II from the insect cell-conditioned medium. Each column (2 ml) was equilibrated in 50 mmTris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. After application of ∼200 ml of the insect cell-conditioned medium, the column was washed with the pH 7.4 buffer. Bound recombinant protein was eluted with 0.1m glycine, pH 4.0. The final eluate was collected into tubes that contained 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, to minimize acid-mediated denaturation of the recombinant pseudozymogen. The protein concentration of the eluate was estimated using a Bio-Rad colorimetric assay or by measuring its optical density at 280 nm. Purified pseudozymogen (∼100 μg in 100 μl) was placed in 100 μl of a pH 5.5 buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm calcium chloride, and 0.1% Triton X-100, with or without 50 μg of heparin glycosaminoglycan. The heparin (Sigma) used in the study had been subjected to a guanidine HCl/CsCl density-gradient centrifugation step (14Huang C. Friend D.S. Qiu W.-T. Wong G.W. Morales G. Hunt J. Stevens R.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1910-1919PubMed Google Scholar) to denature and remove any trace protein contaminants that might be present in the commercial preparation of this glycosaminoglycan. In most cases, a 1-μl solution containing 0.4 units of recombinant EK (New England Biolabs) was added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 17 h to allow EK to activate each tryptase pseudozymogen. Samples from insect cell-conditioned medium infected with varied recombinant baculovirus or proteins purified using the immunoaffinity column were diluted in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) buffer (1% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 500 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) and boiled for 5 min before being loaded onto a 12% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue or was placed in a Bio-Rad immunoblotting apparatus. In the latter instance, the resolved proteins were transferred for 2–4 h at 200 mA to an Immobilon-P membrane in a solution consisting of 20% methanol, 16 mm Tris-HCl, and 120 mm glycine, pH 8.3. The resulting protein blot was washed three times with Tris-buffered saline and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat milk and 0.02% Tween 20 (TBST buffer). After three washes with TBST buffer, the protein blot was incubated with a 1:500 dilution of affinity-purified anti-human tryptase immunoglobulin (Ig) (∼1.5 μg/ml final concentration) (25Schwartz L.B. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 526-531PubMed Google Scholar) (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) or with mouse anti-FLAG M2 Ig (∼5 μg/ml final concentration) (Sigma) in TBST buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with TBST buffer, the protein blot was incubated for 1 h in a 1:1000 dilution of an alkaline phosphatase conjugate of goat anti-rabbit Ig or goat anti-mouse Ig (∼1 ng/ml final concentration) in TBST buffer. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized with nitro blue tetrazolium (0.2 mg/ml) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (0.1 mg/ml) as substrates. For N-terminal amino acid analysis, relevant SDS-PAGE protein blots were briefly stained with Ponceau S red (Sigma). The visualized protein bands were isolated and then were subjected to automated Edman degradation by the Harvard Microchemistry Facility (Harvard Biological Laboratories, Cambridge, MA). After EK activation, recombinant tryptase α, the D215G mutant of tryptase α, and tryptase β/II (∼16 μg) were suspended in 33 μl of 0.15 m NaCl, 20 mmTris, pH 7.4, buffer containing ∼8 μCi of [3H]diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) (4 Ci/nmol; Ci = 37 Gbq; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The samples were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. SDS-PAGE loading buffer was added (33 μl), and each sample was boiled for 5 min before subjecting the [3H]DFP-labeled proteins to SDS-PAGE analysis. The resulting gel was treated with EN3HANCE (NEN Life Science Products), dried, and exposed to x-ray film. A duplicate gel was stained with Coomassie Blue to confirm that similar amounts of protein were placed in each lane. Tryptase α, the D215G mutant of tryptase α, tryptase β/II, and the R-3Q mutant of tryptase β/II were incubated at room temperature or 37 °C for up to 24 h to determine the stability of each recombinant protease. At various times, samples of the digest were evaluated for the ability of the tryptase to cleave the trypsin-susceptible p-nitroanilide (pNA) chromogenic substrates Ile-Phe-Lys-pNA,N-acetyl-Ile-Glu-Ala-Arg-pNA,N-benzoyl-Arg-pNA,N-benzoyl-Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-pNA,N-benzoyl-Phe-Val-Arg-pNA,N-benzoyl-Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA, tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-pNA, tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-pNA (Sigma), and H-d-HHT-Ala-Arg-pNA (American Diagonstica Inc., Greenwich, CT), as described previously for recombinant mouse tryptases (13Huang C.

One unit is defined as the amount of enzymatic activity that induces an 0.001 change in optical density at 405 nm/5 min when tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-pNA is used as a substrate. The ability of recombinant tryptase α, the D215G mutant of tryptase α, tryptase β/II, and the R-3Q mutant of tryptase β/II to degrade the more physiologic substrate fibrinogen was also evaluated. Human fibrinogen (Sigma) (∼40 μg), 50 μl of digestion buffer (25 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), and 10 μl of mature tryptase β/II (∼2 μg), the tryptase β/II mutant (∼2 μg), tryptase α (∼2 μg), or the tryptase α mutant (∼2 μg corresponding to ∼20 units of tryptase β/II) were mixed and incubated for 1–2 h at 37 °C. The resulting digests were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis, as described previously for the evaluation of the mMCP-7-mediated digestion of mouse fibrinogen (13Huang C. Wong G.W. Ghildyal N.

Recombinant tryptase α, tryptase β/II, and the R-3Q mutant of tryptase β/II were generated in insect cells to determine whether residue −3 was critical for the three-dimensional folding of their zymogens, as well as to compare the substrate specificities of these tryptases in their mature forms. Insect cells could be induced to express large amounts (up to 10 μg/ml conditioned medium) of pseudozymogen forms of tryptase α (Fig.1 A), tryptase β/II (Fig.1 B), and the tryptase β/II mutant (data not shown) that, in each instance, contained an EK-susceptible site in its propeptide and the FLAG peptide in its C terminus. The recombinant pseudozymogens were secreted into the conditioned media and were recognized by an anti-human tryptase antibody. Because the recombinant tryptases also bound to an anti-FLAG immunoaffinity column (Figs. 1 A and1 B) and a heparin-Sepharose column in a conformation-dependent manner (data not shown), all three expressed pseudozymogens appeared to be properly folded. After EK treatment, the activated recombinant tryptase monomers exhibited the appropriate molecular mass in an SDS-PAGE gel (Fig.1 C). The mature forms of tryptases α and β/II also possessed the expected N-terminal amino acid sequence of Ile-Val-Gly-Gly-Gln-Glu-Ala-Pro-Arg. The initially expressed mutated tryptases β/II zymogen secreted into the insect cell culture media also possessed the expected N-terminal amino acid sequence of Ala-Pro-Ala-Pro-Gly-Gln-Ala-Leu-Gln-Gln-Val-Gly which corresponds to residues −12 to −1. Mature tryptase α (Fig.2) and β/II (data not shown), but not the inactive pseudozymogens, readily bound the active site inhibitor DFP. Recombinant tryptase β/II and its R-3Q mutant were both able to degrade tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-pNA and tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-pNA, but not Ile-Phe-Lys-pNA,N-acetyl-Ile-Glu-Ala-Arg-pNA,N-benzoyl-Arg-pNA,N-benzoyl-Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-pNA,N-benzoyl-Phe-Val-Arg-pNA, orN-benzoyl-Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA. Thus, residue −3 is not essential for generating active enzyme in this in vitrosystem. Recombinant mature tryptase α was able to cleave H-d-HHT-Ala-Arg-pNA and was able to cleave tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-pNA, but only if the digestion reaction was carried at room temperature for at least 4 h. The observation that tryptase α cleaves H-d-HHT-Ala-Arg-pNA much less efficiently than trypsin and cleaves tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-pNA much less efficiently than tryptase β/II suggests that tryptase α possess a substrate specificity that is even more restricted than that of tryptase β/II. Seven loops form the substrate-binding cleft of each tryptase (Fig.3 A). When the substrate-binding cleft of tryptase α was compared with that of tryptases I, β/II, and III, 9 amino acid differences were seen in loops A, B, C, 1, and 2 (Fig. 3 A). The discovery that a novel charged residue in loop 2 dominantly controls the substrate specificity of granzyme B, coupled with discovery that most MC tryptases cloned from different species have a noncharged Gly at residue 215 (Fig. 3 B), raised the possibility that Asp215 restricts the substrate specificity of tryptase α. A site-directed mutagenesis approach was therefore carried out to convert Asp215 in tryptase α to Gly. The mutant was expressed in insect cells, and after EK treatment, it was able to cleave tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-pNA and tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-pNA (Fig.4), but not Ile-Phe-Lys-pNA,N-acetyl-Ile-Glu-Ala-Arg-pNA,N-benzoyl-Arg-pNA,N-benzoyl-Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-pNA,N-benzoyl-Phe-Val-Arg-pNA, orN-benzoyl-Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA. Using tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-pNA as the substrate in reactions carried out at room temperature, the estimated K m,k cat, andk cat/K mvalues 3In these comparative studies, similar amounts (as measured by the Bio-Rad protein bioassay) of tryptase β/II pseudozymogen and the D215G mutant of tryptase α pseudozymogen were exposed to EK. The processed recombinant tryptases were then examined for their relative ability to cleave tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-pNA. Even when comparing tryptases whose amino acid sequences are 93% identical, such as these two proteases, obtained K m, kcat, and kcat/K m values can only be estimated, because a number of assumptions have to be made. Studies carried out on recombinant mouse tryptases have revealed that this family of serine proteases must spontaneously form a tetramer to become enzymatically active. It is therefore assumed that the percentage of pseudozymogen in each preparation which is converted by EK into active enzyme is the same. It is also assumed that the rate of conversion of inactive monomer to active tetramer and then back to inactive monomer is the same for both tryptases. Finally, it is assumed that each tryptase tetramer has the same number of active sites. of the D215G mutant of tryptase α were 120 μm, 1.9 s−1, and 0.016 μm−1 s−1, respectively, whereas the corresponding values of tryptase β/II were 49 μm, 21 s−1, and 0.43 μm−1 s, respectively. Because tryptase β/II cleaved tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-pNA ∼25-fold better than the D215G mutant of tryptase α, it is likely that pocket residues 21, 22, 23, 46, 84, 85, 88, and/or 91 (Fig. 3) contribute to the different substrate specificities of the two human tryptases.Figure 4Heparin-dependent activation and stabilization of the D215G mutant of recombinant human tryptase α. The purified D215G mutant of tryptase α was incubated at room temperature (♦, ▪) or 37 °C (○, ▴) for up to 24 h with EK in the presence (▴, ♦) or absence (○, ▪) of heparin. At the indicated times, samples were removed from the activation mixture and assayed for their ability to cleave tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-pNA during a 5-min incubation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Kinetic experiments revealed that the enzymatic activity of the D215G mutant was maintained for at least 24 h if heparin was present (Fig. 4). In addition, there was no evidence of autolysis of the recombinant protein by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1 C). Wild type tryptase β/II and its R-3Q mutant were able to cleave the α and β chains of fibrinogen but not the γ chain of this plasma protein (Fig. 5 A). Although fibrinogen was not susceptible to wild type tryptase α, its D215G mutant was able to degrade the α chain of fibrinogen (Fig.5 B). Using a bioengineering approach, pseudozymogen forms of human tryptases α and β/II were expressed in insect cells that could be activated and studied immediately (Fig. 1). Although Mirza et al. (31Mirza H. Schmidt V.A. Derian C.K. Jesty J. Bahou W.F. Blood. 1997; 90: 3914-3922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were able to obtain enzymatically active tryptase α in transiently transfected COS cells, Sakaiet al. (32Sakai K. Ren S. Schwartz L.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 988-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) concluded that this human MC protease probably is not functional in vivo. The latter investigators noted that the propeptide of tryptase α differs from that of mouse, rat, and other human tryptase zymogens at residue −3. Based on their inability to obtain active enzyme in an insect cell expression system, Sakai et al. (32Sakai K. Ren S. Schwartz L.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 988-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) concluded that all tryptases probably undergo an unusual multistep activation process in MCs that is exquisitely heparin-dependent. To explain their in vitro findings, these investigators proposed that a conformation-dependent change occurs when a tryptase zymogen initially binds to heparin, which in turn causes a partial autocatalytic event resulting in the removal of the first 8 residues of the propeptide. It was then proposed that dipeptidyl peptidase I removes the remaining 2 residues of the zymogen in the granule to create the mature enzyme. Unexplained in the Sakai et al.(32Sakai K. Ren S. Schwartz L.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 988-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) mechanism of tryptase activation is how a heparin-bound tryptase zymogen can partially activate itself yet still fail to cleave varied low molecular weight substrates. We have noted that certain recombinant mouse MC chymases denature spontaneously during their expression in insect cells. 4C. Huang and R. L. Stevens, unpublished results. Because the propeptide often is needed for the proper folding of a serine protease (33Urata H. Karnik S.S. Graham R.M. Husain A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24318-24322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we examined whether or not Arg−3 is essential for the proper folding of tryptases in insect cells. Using a site-directed mutagenesis approach, Arg−3 in tryptase β/II was converted to Gln−3. Analogous to wild type tryptase β/II, the R-3Q derivative of the pseudozymogen could be readily activated in our in vitro system. While this finding alone does not prove that tryptase α is post-translationally processed into a functional enzyme in human MCs, a tryptase has been cloned from gerbil jejunal MCs (30Murakumo Y. Ide H. Itoh H. Tomita M. Kobayashi T. Maruyama H. Horii Y. Nawa Y. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), which is enzymatically active (34Nawa Y.Y. Horii Y. Okada M. Arizono N. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1994; 104: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) even though its zymogen possesses a Glu at residue −3. In addition, Wang et al. (35Wang Z.-M. Walter M. Selwood T. Rubin H. Schechter N.M. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) recently generated active tryptase β/II in insect cells using a fusion protein approach in which the natural propeptide of human tryptase β/II was replaced by that which encodes ubiquitin followed by a short EK-susceptible peptide. More definitive data relevant to this issue have been obtained recently during analysis of the transgenic mouse we created which is unable to express heparin due to targeted disruption of theN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase-2 gene. Although the MCs developed from these heparin-null mice are unable to store the chymase mMCP-5 and the exopeptidase mMC-CPA in their granules, they do contain substantial amounts of enzymatically active tryptase. 5D. E. Humphries and R. L. Stevens, unpublished results. The cumulative findings from all of these studies now indicate that heparin is not essential for tryptase expression in MCs and that Arg−3 is not essential for the proteolytic activation of tryptase zymogens. Because we concluded that Mirza et al. (31Mirza H. Schmidt V.A. Derian C.K. Jesty J. Bahou W.F. Blood. 1997; 90: 3914-3922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are probably correct in their conclusion that human tryptase α is a functional enzyme in vivo, we expressed this tryptase and tryptase β/II in our insect cell expression system to try to address why human MCs produce so many nearly identical neutral proteases. Insect cell-derived recombinant tryptases α and β/II have all of the features of biologically active serine proteases (Fig.3 A). DFP binds to each mature tryptase but, importantly, not to their pseudozymogens (Fig. 2). These observations indicate that DFP is not binding to either tryptase in a nonspecific manner. In vitro and in vivo studies carried out in mice with recombinant mouse tryptases (13Huang C. Wong G.W. Ghildyal N. Gurish M.F. S̆ali A. Matsumoto R. Qiu W.-T. Stevens R.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1987; 262: 1363-1373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which had suggested that mouse MC tryptases possess substrate specificities that are considerably more restricted than that of trypsin. The physiologic function of tryptase α remains to be determined. However, the in vitro studies carried out in the present investigation now suggest that tryptase α also has a restricted substrate specificity and one that is different from that of tryptase β/II. Fibrinogen is a major protein constituent of blood. Although tissue edema can be quite pronounced during a MC-mediated inflammatory reaction, one generally does not see the deposition of large amounts of fibrin/platelet clots in affected tissues. Fibrinogen is a physiologic substrate of mMCP-7 (13Huang C. Wong G.W. Ghildyal N. Gurish M.F. S̆ali A. Matsumoto R. Qiu W.-T. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31885-31893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and both native (15Schwartz L.B. Bradford T.R. Littman B.H. Wintroub B.U. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 2762-2767PubMed Google Scholar) and recombinant tryptase β/II (16Ren S. Lawson A.E. Carr M. Baumgarten C.M. Schwartz L.B. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3540-3548PubMed Google Scholar) can cleave fibrinogen in vitro. Thus, tryptase β/II probably plays an important role in preventing the accumulation of clots that would physically hinder lymphocyte and granulocyte extravasation into the inflamed tissue. Although the amino acid sequences of tryptase α and β/II are 93% identical, recombinant tryptase α was unable to degrade human fibrinogen in vitro(Fig. 5). Seven loops form the substrate-binding cleft of each serine protease (37Perona J.J. Craik C.S. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 337-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Although the loops that comprise the substrate-binding cleft of a human tryptase represent only ∼20% of the mature enzyme, 9 of the 18 amino acid differences between tryptase α and tryptase β/II reside precisely in this small portion of the protease (Fig.3 A). Because the substrate-binding cleft was selectively mutated during the evolution of these two human proteases, we reasoned that it probably occurred to generate functionally distinct tryptases. Based on the crystallographic structure of tryptase β/II (22Pereira P.J. Bergner A. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Huber R. Matschiner G. Fritz H. Sommerhoff C.P. Bode W. Nature. 1998; 392: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), loop 2 (corresponding to amino acid residues 211–218) contributes substantially to the enzyme's S1, S2, and S3 sites. A comparative analysis of their amino acid sequences revealed that tryptase α has an Asp at residue 215 rather than Gly, which is found in mouse, rat, dog, gerbil, and other human tryptases (Fig. 3 B). This observation raised the possibility that human tryptases α and β/II might be functionally different, in part, due to this amino acid substitution. To explore this possibility, a site-directed mutagenesis approach was carried out to change Asp215 in tryptase α to Gly (Fig. 1). Like wild type tryptase β/II, the resulting D215G mutant of tryptase α was able to effectively cleave the chromogenic substrate tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-pNA (Fig. 4). The mutant also was able to cleave the α chain of human fibrinogen (Fig. 5). It is well known that loop 2 impacts the substrate specificities of other serine proteases. For example (38Caputo A. James M.N. Powers J.C. Hudig D. Bleackley R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the presence of an Arg in loop 2 causes granzyme B to prefer substrates which have an Asp at the P1 site rather than a hydrophobic residue preferred by many other members of the chromosome 14 family of serine proteases. Although the bulky negatively charged amino acid at residue 215 explains the restricted substrate specificity of tryptase α relative to that of tryptase β/II, it is likely that, in vivo, tryptase α still prefers substrates that have a positively charged amino acid at their P1 sites. Like mMCP-6 and mMCP-7 in the mouse, human tryptases α and β/II are functional proteases that differ in their substrate specificities. It now appears that these two neutral proteases evolved so that human MCs can degrade different extracellular proteins during an inflammatory reaction.

Seven STAT proteins are known termed STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5A, STAT5B, and STAT6. Four JAK enzymes are known termed JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and Tyk2. Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT proteins by the JAK kinases promotes STAT homo- and heterodimerization and translocation of activated STAT dimers to the nucleus. In the nucleus, the STATs regulate the expression of various genes important in cell proliferation. Angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced signal transduction in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), for example, proceeds in part through activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. We have shown previously that Ang II signaling through the G-protein-coupled AT1receptor stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of JAK2 and Tyk2 in VSMCs followed by tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT2, and STAT3 and translocation of STAT1 to the nucleus (4Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Heerdt L. Berk B.C. Delafontaine P. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). In addition to the JAK kinases, the Src family of tyrosine kinases has also been implicated in phosphorylation and activation of STAT proteins (5Yu C.-L. Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Larner A.C. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Jove R. Science. 1995; 269: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 6Cao X. Tay A. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. Mol. Cell.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1749-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have recently investigated the role of specific Src family tyrosine kinases in Ang II-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT1 in VSMCs (10Venema R.C. Venema V.J. Eaton D.C. Marrero M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30795-30800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Using selective enzyme inhibitors and antisense oligonucleotides, we have shown that JAK2 and the Src family p59 Fyn tyrosine kinase (but not the p60 c-Src tyrosine kinase) are required for phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT1. Neither of these two kinases, however, appears to function upstream from the other in a tyrosine phosphorylation cascade. Rather, p59 Fyn serves as an Ang II-activated docking protein for both JAK2 and STAT1. In this role, p59 Fyn brings JAK2 and STAT1 together in close physical proximity, thereby facilitating JAK2-mediated STAT1 phosphorylation. In addition, we also identified the dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase, MKP-1, as the enzyme responsible for STAT1 tyrosine dephosphorylation in VSMCs.Neutralizing antibodies against either STAT1 or STAT3 completely abolish the proliferative response of VSMCs to Ang II, suggesting that both transcription factors have an essential role in the response (11Marrero M.B.

Therefore, in the present study we have examined whether Ang II-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in VSMCs is regulated by the same tyrosine kinases and tyrosine phosphatases that regulate tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1. Because maximal activation of transcription by STAT1 and STAT3 also requires serine phosphorylation of these proteins (12Zhang X. Blenis J. Li H.-C. Schindler C. Chen-Kiang S. Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 13Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar), we have also identified the serine/threonine-specific protein kinases and serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatases that are responsible for Ang II-induced STAT3 serine phosphorylation and subsequent dephosphorylation.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe have shown previously that Ang II-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 in VSMCs is mediated by JAK2 and, in addition, requires activated p59 Fyn functioning as an Ang II-activated docking protein for both JAK2 and STAT1 (10Venema R.C. Venema V.J. Eaton D.C. Marrero M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30795-30800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To determine whether Ang II-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in VSMCs is also mediated by JAK2, we utilized the JAK2-selective inhibitor, AG-490. This inhibitor inhibits JAK2 with an IC50 in the low micromolar range (<5 μm) but does not inhibit Src family tyrosine kinases even at concentrations as high as 50 μm (15Meydan N. Grunberger T. Dadi H. Shahar M. Arpala E. Lapidot Z. Leeder J.S. Freedman M. Cohen A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Rolfman C.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Cultured rat aortic VSMCs were preincubated in the presence or absence (control) of AG-490 (10 μm for 1 h) prior to stimulation of the cells for 0, 30, or 60 min with Ang II (100 nm). Cells were then lysed and lysates were immunoblotted with a STAT3 phosphotyrosine-specific antibody that recognizes the tyrosine residue 705-phosphorylated (but not the nonphosphorylated) form of STAT3. In the control, Ang II induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 (92-kDa band) within 60 min (Fig.1 A). Phosphorylation, however, was unaffected by AG-490 treatment, indicating that, in contrast to the case of Ang II-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1, Ang II-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 is not mediated by JAK2. To verify the lack of a role of JAK2 in Ang II-induced STAT3 phosphorylation, we also carried out experiments in which we utilized a specific JAK2 antisense oligonucleotide to suppress JAK2 protein expression. VSMCs were treated with the antisense oligonucleotide or a complementary sense oligonucleotide (negative control) for 12 h prior to stimulation of the cells for 0, 30, or 60 min with Ang II (100 nm). The antisense oligonucleotide (but not the sense oligonucleotide) completely abolished JAK2 expression in VSMCs after 12 h of treatment (data not shown) as reported previously (10Venema R.C. Venema V.J. Eaton D.C. Marrero M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30795-30800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). When Ang II-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation in oligonucleotide-treated cells was then assessed by immunoblotting with the phosphotyrosine-specific anti-STAT antibody, no effect of either sense or antisense oligonucleotides on Ang II-stimulated STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation was observed (Fig. 1 A), confirming that JAK2 is not required for Ang II-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in VSMCs.We have shown previously that the Src family tyrosine kinases, p60 c-Src and p59 Fyn, are activated in VSMCs in response to Ang II stimulation (10Venema R.C.

Res. 1995; 77: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We have shown further that p59 Fyn (but not p60 c-Src) is required for Ang II-induced STAT1 phosphorylation in VSMCs by functioning as a Ang II-activated docking protein for both JAK2 and STAT1 (10Venema R.C. Venema V.J. Eaton D.C. Marrero M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30795-30800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To determine whether Src family tyrosine kinases are required for Ang II-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in VSMCs, we utilized the Src family kinase-selective inhibitor, PP1. PP1 inhibits Src family kinases in the low nanomolar range but does not inhibit JAK2 even at 1000-fold higher concentrations (18Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar). VSMCs were preincubated in the presence or absence (control) of PP1 (1 μm for 30 min) prior to stimulation of the cells for 0, 30, or 60 min with Ang II (100 nm). Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 was then quantitated by immunoblotting of cell lysates with the phosphotyrosine-specific anti-STAT3 antibody. As shown in Fig.1 B, STAT3 was tyrosine-phosphorylated in the control condition within 60 min after Ang II exposure. PP1 pretreatment, however, completely blocked Ang II-induced phosphorylation of the factor. To confirm the requirement for Src family tyrosine kinases in phosphorylation of STAT3 in Ang II-stimulated VSMCs and to determine the specific roles of p59 Fyn and p60 c-Src in phosphorylation, experiments were also carried out using p59 Fyn and p60 c-Src antisense oligonucleotides. VSMCs were treated for 24 h with antisense or complementary sense (negative control) oligonucleotides to p59 Fyn or p60 c-Src prior to stimulation of the cells for 0, 30, or 60 min with Ang II (100 nm). As reported previously (10Venema R.C. Venema V.J. Eaton D.C. Marrero M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30795-30800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), the two antisense oligonucleotides completely abolished p59 Fyn and p60 c-Src protein expression in VSMCs within 24 h (data not shown). In contrast, the two sense oligonucleotides had no effect on expression of the two proteins. Additional experiments were then carried out to examine the effect of 24-h treatment with the antisense oligonucleotides on subsequent Ang II-stimulated STAT3 phosphorylation. The p59 Fyn antisense oligonucleotide had no effect on Ang II-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown) indicating that, unlike the case of STAT1, Ang II-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 does not require p59 Fyn. However, when the effect of the p60 c-Src antisense oligonucleotide was examined, this oligonucleotide (but not the sense oligonucleotide) was found to completely block Ang II-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that among members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases, it is p60 c-Src specifically that is required for Ang II-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation. p60 c-Src likely phosphorylates STAT3 directly, since the STAT3 protein has been shown previously to be an excellent substrate for the p60 c-Src tyrosine kinase in vitro(6Cao X. Tay A. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1595-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar).Phosphorylation of STAT proteins, including STAT3, promotes their translocation to the nucleus. Therefore, we examined whether the p60 c-Src antisense oligonucleotide could block the Ang II-induced nuclear translocation of STAT3 in VSMCs. Cells were pretreated with either antisense or sense (negative control) oligonucleotides for 24 h prior to treatment with Ang II (100 nm) for 0, 30, 60, or 120 min. Cells were lysed, and cell nuclei were isolated as described previously (4Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Heerdt L. Berk B.C. Delafontaine P. Bernstein K.E.

Relative amounts of STAT3 in nuclear fractions were then quantitated by immunoblotting with an anti-STAT3 antibody. In cells pretreated with the sense oligonucleotide, STAT3 was translocated to the nucleus within 60 min (Fig. 2). However, in cells pretreated with the antisense oligonucleotide, translocation was completely blocked, demonstrating an essential role for p60 c-Src in mediating the translocation response.Figure 2Effect of p60 c-Src sense and antisense oligonucleotides on Ang II-induced nuclear translocation of STAT3 in VSMCs . VSMCs were treated with Ang II (100 nm) for the times shown following pretreatment of cells with either p60 c-Src sense or antisense oligonucleotides. Nuclei were isolated and STAT3 in nuclear fractions was quantitated by immunoblotting with anti-STAT3 antibody. Similar results were obtained in three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Ang II-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation is transient in nature and, therefore, is controlled by the combined actions of both tyrosine kinases and tyrosine phosphatases. In our previous study (10Venema R.C. Venema V.J. Eaton D.C. Marrero M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30795-30800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we identified the nuclear dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase, MKP-1, as the enzyme responsible for STAT1 tyrosine dephosphorylation in VSMCs by showing that dephosphorylation of STAT1 is blocked by a specific MKP-1 antisense oligonucleotide. To determine whether MKP-1 also dephosphorylates STAT3 in VSMCs, cells were treated for 16 h with an MKP-1 antisense oligonucleotide (termed 8155) shown previously to significantly inhibit MKP-1 protein expression in rat aortic VSMCs (10Venema R.C.

After 16 h, cells were stimulated with Ang II (100 nm) for 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 h. Cell lysates were prepared and immunoblotted with the phosphotyrosine-specific anti-STAT3 antibody. In both antisense and sense conditions, STAT3 was significantly tyrosine-phosphorylated within 1 h and subsequently completely dephosphorylated by 2 h (data not shown), suggesting that MKP-1 does not have a role in tyrosine dephosphorylation of STAT3 in VSMCs.Another protein phosphatase that is active in the cell nucleus following its translocation from the cytosol in response to Ca2+ signals (21Shibasaki F. Price E.R. Milan D. McKeon F. Nature. 1996; 382: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) is the Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase known as calcineurin or protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B) (22Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Calcineurin is generally considered a serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase, based on its specificity in in vitro activity assays for a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 81–99 of the RII subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (23Blumenthal D.K. Takio K. Hansen R.S. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8140-8145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calcineurin dephosphorylates both phosphoserine and phosphotyrosine in this peptide but the k cat for phosphotyrosine is 2 orders of magnitude lower than that for phosphoserine (22Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Calcineurin, however, has also been shown to effectively dephosphorylate free phosphotyrosine and other tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides and proteins in vitro (24Pallen C.J. Wang J.H. J. Biol.

Calcineurin is activated in response to Ang II stimulation in rat adrenal glomerulosa cells (29Baukal A.J. Hunyady L. Catt K.J. Balla T. J. Biol.

To determine whether calcineurin is activated in response to Ang II stimulation in VSMCs, cells were either pretreated or not pretreated (control) with the highly selective calcineurin-specific inhibitor, FK506 (100 μm for 1 h) (31Liu J.

Cells were lysed, and calcineurin was immunoprecipitated from lysates with an anti-calcineurin antibody that recognizes the catalytic subunit of the enzyme. Immunoprecipitates were then assayed for tyrosine phosphatase activity by measuring the rate of formation of p-nitrophenol from p-nitrophenyl phosphate as described previously (14Marrero M.B.

Ang II did indeed activate calcineurin in these experiments and activation was sustained out to at least 1 h. Furthermore, activation was completely blocked by FK506 (Fig. 3).Figure 3Ang II-induced activation of calcineurin in VSMCs . VSMCs were treated with Ang II (100 nm) for the times shown following either no pretreatment (●[bond]●) or pretreatment (○[bond]○) of cells with FK506.

Whether the enzyme undergoes a similar nuclear translocation in response to Ca2+-mobilizing hormones, however, has not been described previously. To determine whether Ang II stimulation of VSMCs results in nuclear translocation of calcineurin, cells were treated with Ang II (100 nm) for 0, 30, and 60 min followed by isolation of cell nuclei as described previously (4Marrero M.B.

Relative amounts of calcineurin in nuclear fractions were then quantitated by immunoblotting with the antibody that recognizes the catalytic subunit of calcineurin (61-kDa band). As shown in Fig.4, Ang II stimulation of VSMCs resulted in a translocation of calcineurin into the nucleus within 30 min after Ang II exposure. To determine whether calcineurin is responsible for tyrosine dephosphorylation of STAT3 in VSMCs, cells were treated with Ang II (100 nm) for 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 h following either no pretreatment (control) or pretreatment with FK506 (100 μm for 1 h). Cells were lysed, and lysates were immunoblotted with the phosphotyrosine-specific anti-STAT3 antibody. As shown in Fig. 5, STAT3 in the control condition was tyrosine-phosphorylated at 1 h and subsequently completely dephosphorylated within 2 h. In FK506-treated cells, however, STAT3 remained maximally tyrosine-phosphorylated out to at least 4 h, suggesting that calcineurin is the phosphatase responsible for STAT3 tyrosine dephosphorylation following its Ang II-induced tyrosine phosphorylation.Figure 4Ang II-induced nuclear translocation of calcineurin in VSMCs . VSMCs were treated with Ang II (100 nm) for the times shown followed by isolation of cell nuclei.

SIF binds to gene promoter elements known as SIEs. To determine whether calcineurin-mediated tyrosine dephosphorylation of STAT3 reverses SIF binding to SIE, we carried out electrophoretic mobility shift assays with nuclear extracts from Ang II-stimulated VSMCs following preincubation of the cells in the absence (control) or presence of FK506. VSMCs were preincubated with or without FK506 (100 μm for 1 h) and then treated for 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 h with Ang II (100 nm). Nuclear extracts were prepared and tested for their abilities to gel shift a 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe containing the SIF consensus binding site. With nuclear extracts from both control and FK506-pretreated cells, Ang II treatment induced a clear gel shift within 1 h, presumably due to binding of SIF to the SIE (Fig. 6). In the control condition, binding was maximal at 1 h and subsequently declined in a time-dependent manner so that, after 4 h, binding was <10% of that observed at 1 h. In contrast, nuclear extracts from the FK506-pretreated cells sustained a maximal level of binding out to at least 4 h. When nuclear extracts were incubated with both the 32P-labeled probe and with an anti-STAT3 antibody, a gel supershift was observed (Fig. 6, far right lane), demonstrating that the SIF was comprised of STAT3 homo- and/or heterodimers. Taken together, the results of the electrophoretic mobility shift assays suggest that calcineurin-mediated tyrosine dephosphorylation of STAT3 is responsible for SIF dissociation from the SIE and thus termination of Ang-II-induced JAK/STAT signaling through the SIE promoter element.Figure 6Effect of FK506 on Ang II-induced SIF binding with SIE . VSMCs were treated with Ang II (100 nm) for the times indicated following either no pretreatment (Control) or pretreatment with FK506.

These two proteins have also been shown to be phosphorylated on serine residues in other cell types in response to both growth factor and cytokine receptor signaling. Phosphorylation of a single serine residue (residue 727) in each protein is required for maximal transcriptional activity and appears to be mediated by MAP kinase, because it occurs within a PMSP MAP kinase recognition sequence (12Zhang X. Blenis J. Li H.-C. Schindler C. Chen-Kiang S. Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar,13Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E.

Experiments were also performed in which cells were pretreated with PD98059 (30 μm for 1 h), a highly selective MAP kinase kinase (and hence MAP kinase) inhibitor (34Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J.

Lysates were immunoblotted with a STAT3 phosphoserine 727-specific antibody that recognizes the serine-phosphorylated (but not the nonphosphorylated) form of STAT3. As shown in Fig. 7, Ang II induced the serine phosphorylation of STAT3 within 1 h. Phosphorylation was sustained out to 3 h after which the factor became dephosphorylated by 4 h. Phosphorylation was almost completely blocked by PD98059 confirming that the modification was catalyzed by MAP kinase.Figure 7Ang II-induced serine phosphorylation of STAT3 in VSMCs .

We now show that in PC12 cells, overexpression of the kinase domain of MRCKα and ROKα resulted in retraction of neurites formed on nerve growth factor (NGF) treatment, as observed with RhoA.

Neurite outgrowth induced by either agent was blocked by kinase-dead MRCKα lacking the p21-binding domain or by a minimal C-terminal regulatory region consisting of the cysteine-rich domain/pleckstrin homology domain plus a region with homology to citron.

Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). GEK, the Drosophila homolog of MRCK, has also been suggested to regulate actin polymerization as a Cdc42 effector (16Luo L. Lee T. Tsai L. Tang G. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12963-12968Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In this study, we have microinjected constructs of MRCKα and ROKα and their various mutant forms into PC12 cells and investigated their effects on neurite morphology. We show that although ROKα can cause neurite retraction, MRCKα may conversely participate in neurite outgrowth downstream of Cdc42 and Rac. Full-length ROKα1–1379, kinase-dead ROKαK112A, ROKα1–543, full-length MRCKα1–1732, MRCKα1–473, kinase-dead MRCKα-KD, the triple mutant kinase-dead and p21-binding deficient MRCKα-TM (MRCKαK106A/H1579A/H1582A), Cdc42N17, Rac1N17, and RhoAN19 were cloned in pXJ40 vector containing N-terminal HA or FLAG epitope as described (7Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Tan I. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 13Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MRCKα-CPC (amino acids 930–1492) was obtained by first subcloning a 1.4-kilobase BglII fragment from full-length MRCKα into pXJ40-FLAG vector to generate a construct containing the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) and vicinal PH domain (CRD/PH domains) and subsequently replaced by an NheI/DraI fragment at the 3′ end. MRCKα-CC (amino acids 930–1492Δ1117–1181) was obtained by anEcoRV/NheI in-frame deletion from MRCKα-CPC construct. MRCKα-C containing the citron homology domain alone (amino acids 1395–1492) was obtained by polymerase chain reaction of the MRCKα full-length DNA with primers 5′-CTGGATCCCTCCATTCAAATGACCAC-3′ and pXJ40 reverse primer. The subsequentBamHI/DraI fragment was subcloned into pXJ40-FLAG vector. The human Crk-SH3 construct encompassing the C-terminal SH3 domain of CrkII (amino acids 102–304) was derived from an expressed sequence tag cDNA sequence (GenBankTMaccession number AA197266). The ACK-SH3 construct was obtained by subcloning a BamHI/BstEII fragment (amino acids 267–498) from an ACK cDNA (17Manser E. Leung T. Salihiddin H. Tan L. Lim L. Nature. 1993; 363: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). All subclones were confirmed by sequencing, and the production of the right sized proteins from these constructs was analyzed by appropriate transfection of COS cells. PC 12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 10% horse serum (Sigma). For microinjection of nondifferentiated PC12 cells, subconfluent cells plated on collagen-coated coverslips for 48 h were microinjected with different constructs (50 ng/μl). 2–4 h after injection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with the combination of various primary antibodies: anti-HA (12CA5; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or anti-FLAG, (M2; IBI). Stained cells were analyzed with an MRC 600 confocal imager adapted to a ZEISS Axioplan microscope. For differentiation, 50 ng/ml NGF (human recombinant; Sigma) in serum-free medium was used. After 3 days of NGF treatment, cells were microinjected with different constructs and stained as described previously (13Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For PC12 cell transfection, subconfluent cells plated on 20 μg/ml laminin-coated coverslips were transfected with various HA- or FLAG-tagged DNA constructs (1 μg/ml) with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to recommended protocol. 5 h after transfection, cells were exposed to 50 ng/ml NGF in medium containing 2% serum for 48 h before fixing and staining as described above. For evaluation of neurite outgrowth, the total number of cells expressing the HA- or FLAG-tag were counted, and cells with neurite of more than two body lengths were regarded as exhibiting neurite growth. Control cells were either injected or transfected with a pXJ40-GST construct. COS-7 cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum were transfected with Crk-SH3, ACK-SH3, MRCKα-CPC, MRCKα-CC, MRCKα-C, and other constructs. 24 h after transfection, cell extracts were obtained with lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 0.15 m NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 20 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 5% glycerol, and 0.2% Triton X-100), separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibodies for expression. Total soluble extracts from rat brain and PC12 were used for Western blotting using anti-ROKα (monoclonal antibody 1A1, Ref.13Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or rabbit anti-MRCKα raised against the Cdc42-binding domain of MRCKα. Although various isoforms of ROKα and MRCKα are ubiquitously expressed in many tissues and cultured cells, the highest levels are detectable in the brain (7Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Tan I. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 13Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In PC12 cells, the levels of ROKα and MRCKα are comparable with those in the brain (Fig.1 A). In nonneuronal cells, expression of either ROKα or MRCKα, or their kinase domains, resulted in increases in stress fibers and focal adhesions (13Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Amano M.K. Chihara K. Fukuta N. Nakamura Y. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Here using PC12 cells treated with NGF for 48 h, we find that microinjection of the MRCKα catalytic domain construct resulted in neurite retraction (Fig. 1 B) as did that of the ROKα. Similar results were obtained with full-length ROKα or MRCKα (data not shown), which are catalytically activein vitro, phosphorylating similar substrates (7Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Tan I. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 13Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown in HeLa cells and fibroblasts that the kinase-dead ROKα-KD caused rapid losses of stress fibers and focal adhesion, which were not observed with the kinase-dead MRCKα-KD, suggesting distinctive differences in their activity on the actin cytoskeleton (7Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Tan I. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 13Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In PC12 cells, microinjection of the dominant negative ROKα-KD construct can induce outgrowth in the absence of NGF. This effect was very similar to that observed with C3 toxin injection, which inhibits RhoA by ADP-ribosylation. However, no such effect was observed when MRCKα-KD was expressed in these cells (Fig. 1 C). We conclude that inhibition of the catalytic activity of ROKα, but not of MRCKα, can mimic the effects of inhibiting RhoA in PC12 cells in inducing neurite outgrowth. Unlike NGF treatment which gave obvious effects only after 1–2 days, microinjection of either ROKα-KD or C3 toxin produced neurites within hours. These neurites were also more extensively branched than those obtained after NGF treatment (see Fig.2 A and Fig.3 B).Figure 3Mutant forms of MRCK-α block both NGF- and ROK α-induced neurite outgrowth.

C, graphical analysis of neurite outgrowth as described in Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next investigated whether the action of NGF and of ROKα-KD in inducing neurite outgrowth involved components in common. GTPases such as Cdc42 and Rac1 (3Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) and the adaptor protein Crk (18Tanaka S.

Mahadeo D. Kraemer R. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1964-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) have been shown to be required for neurite outgrowth with their dominant negative mutants being potent inhibitors of outgrowth. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, transfection of constructs encoding Cdc42N17, Rac1N17, and Crk-SH3 but not ACK-SH3 could effectively block NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. These constructs exerted similar blocking effects on the neurite outgrowth induced by ROKα-KD (Fig. 2,A and B). These data suggest that neurite outgrowth induced either by NGF treatment or inhibition of the RhoA pathway by ROKα-KD expression involve common downstream components, including Cdc42 and Rac. As in other cells, endogenous MRCKα does not appear to be involved in mediating Rho-type actions in PC12 cells. In nonneural cells, there is evidence that MRCKα can potentiate the effects of Cdc42 in promoting peripheral changes (7Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Tan I. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). To determine whether MRCKα exerted a similar peripheral effect in PC12 cells, they were transfected with various plasmid constructs of MRCKα (Fig. 3 A) including MRCKα-TM (which was kinase and p21-binding defective), MRCKα-CPC (containing the cysteine-rich/PH domains as well as a region with marked homology to citron; Refs. 20Madaule P. Furuyashiki T. Teid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. Morii N. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholarand 21Di Cunto F. Calautti E. Hsiao J. Ong L. Topley G. Turco E. Dotto G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29706-29711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and MRCKα-CC (containing the cysteine-rich domain/citron homology region with the PH domain deleted). The response of these transfected cells to NGF treatment was examined. In separate experiments, these constructs were also microinjected together with ROKα-KD to assess their effects on ROKα-KD-induced neurite outgrowth. A substantial attenuation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth was observed with all three mutants, MRCKα-TM, -CPC, and -CC (Fig. 3, Band C). Strikingly, a similar effect was obtained when cells were transfected with the mutant MRCKα-C, which contained only the C-terminal region with homology to citron (bottom photograph). MRCKα-TM and MRCKα-CPC also blocked neurite outgrowth induced by ROKα-KD expression but to a lower extent, whereas MRCKα-CC and MRCKα-C were ineffective in this respect. These results indicate that endogenous MRCKα is involved in promoting neurite outgrowth induced by either NGF or ROKα-KD. Further, they revealed the presence of functional domains in MRCKα including cysteine-rich/PH domains and a regulatory citron homology domain. The inhibitory effects were more prominent with NGF treatment, in which the minimal citron homology domain alone was highly effective. With regard to outgrowth induced by ROKα-KD, the PH domain of MRCKα appears to be crucial. The alignment of the important citron homology domain with homologous sequences in the data base is shown in Fig.4 A. Sequence similarities extended from the newly reported mammalian citron kinase (20Madaule P. Furuyashiki T. Teid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. Morii N. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 21Di Cunto F. Calautti E. Hsiao J. Ong L. Topley G. Turco E. Dotto G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29706-29711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), the nck-interacting kinase NIK to the yeast guanine nucleotide exchange factor ROM-2. Interestingly cysteine-rich and PH domains are often found in front of the citron homology domain at the C-terminal end of the proteins. Neuronal cells in culture respond differently to various growth factors that regulate their neurite morphology (3Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 4Jalink K. van Corven R.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J.

Neurochem. 1996; 66: 537-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Treatment of neuroblastoma cells with lysophosphatidic acid causes neurite retraction through RhoA activation (4Jalink K. van Corven R.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 5Tigyi G. Fischer D. Sebok S. Yang C. Dyer D.L. Miledi R. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 537-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). On the other hand, treatment with acetylcholine acting as a growth factor results in neurite growth cone filopodial and laemellipodial formation, with these morphological effects being regulated by Cdc42 and Rac, respectively (3Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). In PC12 cells, treatment with NGF causes neurite outgrowth (22Bar-Sagi D. Feramisco J.R. Cell. 1985; 42: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) with Ras thought to be involved, because dominant negative Ras blocks this NGF effect (23Szeberenyi J. Cai H. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5324-5332Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that Cdc42 and Rac1 are also major players in these morphological events as their dominant negatives are potent inhibitors of neurite formation (3Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). In NGF-differentiated PC12 cells ROKα promotes retraction of neurites. This retraction is also observed when these cells are microinjected with the ROKα catalytic domain construct. While this work was in progress, similar findings were reported in PC12 (24Katah H. Aoki J. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2489-2492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and NIE-115 (25Hirose M. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. Uehata M. Kranenburg O. Moolenaar W.H. Matsumura F. Maekawa M. Bito H. Narumiya S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1625-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) cells. The MRCKα catalytic domain elicits similar results as the ROKα catalytic domain clearly indicating that the overexpression of the catalytic domain of these related kinases in PC12 cells is sufficient for the retraction activity. This is not unexpected because these two kinases can act on similar substrates, with nonmuscle myosin light chain phosphorylation being most important for actomyosin contractility (7Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Tan I. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 11Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Chihara K. Nakano T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). However, whereas expression of the kinase-dead ROKα-KD can induce neurite outgrowth MRCKα-KD is totally ineffective. The multipolar outgrowth pattern induced by ROKα-KD is similar to that reported for C3 toxin (4Jalink K. van Corven R.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). These results are in keeping with RhoA being an important regulator of neurite morphology (26Gebbink M.F.B.G. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P.G. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Activation of RhoA results in neurite retraction, whereas blocking of RhoA by C3 or kinase-dead ROKα promotes neurite outgrowth. Neurite outgrowth induced by ROKα-KD expression or by NGF treatment appears to involve common components. The outgrowth effects of both agents are blocked by the inhibitory N-terminal truncated c-Crk-II102–304, Cdc42N17 and Rac1N17 (Fig. 2, B and C), and RapN17 (data not shown). As the c-Crk mutant was a potent inhibitor in both cases, it is possible that c-Crk (c-Crk-l in PC12 cells) provides a link between the RhoA and the NGF signaling pathways. v-Crk has been recently reported to regulate RhoA activity (27Altun-Gultekin Z.F. Chandriani S. Bougeret C. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. de Graaf P. van Bergen en Henegouwen P. Hanafusa H. Wagner J.A. Birge R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3044-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), whereas c-Crk is known to mediate Rap1 effects through the exchange factor C3G believed to be essential for sustaining Ras signaling and PC12 differentiation (28York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Natur e. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a direct activation of Rac1 through c-CrkII and DOCK180 has also been documented (29Nolan K.M. Barrett K. Lu Y. Hu K.-Q. Vincent S. Settleman J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3337-3342Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 30Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kobayashi S. Sugimura H. Kurata T. Matusuda M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Blocking of the action of RhoA by C3 or ROKα-KD could allow c-Crk to be available for alternate pathways for which Cdc42 and Rac1 are required (see model in Fig. 4 B). RasGAP120 and RhoGAP190 interactions may also be crucial to the cross-talk between these two pathways (31Chang J.-H. Gell S. Settleman J. Parsons S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Whereas NGF-induced neurite outgrowth could be blocked with either PD-98059 or SB-203580 (32Morooka T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24285-24288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), which are specific inhibitors for extra cellular signal-regulated kinases and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, respectively, these agents were ineffective in preventing ROKα-KD-induced neurite outgrowth (results not shown). Mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways are therefore not involved in the production of neurites through Rho inhibition, and it is possible that the different types of neurite morphologies in the PC12 cells we observe reflects the involvement of different final pathways. As RhoA inhibition is a crucial step in this process, a major step in growth factor signaling may be in fine tuning of the RhoA pathway. The neurite outgrowth induced by either ROKα-KD or NGF was effectively blocked by the kinase-dead and p21-binding deficient MRCKα-TM mutant, strongly suggesting that MRCKα is an important component involved in the outgrowth process. Another most striking finding was that a fragment containing just the citron homology region of MRCKα was sufficient for blocking NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. This minimal fragment did not affect ROKα-induced outgrowth, whose blocking requires inclusion of the PH domain in the mutants (Fig. 3). The use of these MRCKα mutants thus also reveals further differences between the NGF- and ROKα-KD-induced processes. The meshwork of neurites that emanate immediately on inhibition of Rho activities suggests that the latter is important in eliciting neurite outgrowth and that the cell is already primed to respond rapidly but perhaps in a disorganized fashion. It is possible that for proper neuritic outgrowth initiated by growth factors such as NGF, apart from stimulating Cdc42 and Rac activities, the regulated dampening of Rho activities is required and that the integration of such activities may explain the relatively longer period required for cells to respond to NGF. We conclude that in PC12 cells, the two myotonic dystrophy kinase-related kinases, MRCKα and ROKα, are involved in regulating neurite morphology but with contrasting roles as depicted in Fig.4 B. ROKα acts downstream of RhoA in inducing neurite retraction and MRCKα acts downstream of Cdc42/Rac1 in promoting neurite outgrowth. Their related catalytic domains allow MRCKα and ROKα to act on similar components of the actomyosin contractile apparatus, whereas their different p21-binding and regulatory domains are probably responsible for specifying their spatial and temporal effects in cells responding to growth factor stimulation. Although the regulatory domains of both kinases include CRD and PH domains, an important difference is the presence of the citron homology region in MRCKα, but absent in ROKα, which appears to be crucially implicated in NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. The citron homology region is also present in a number of signaling molecules in various organisms (Fig.4 A). The role of this region in macromolecular interactions and especially in defining the actions of MRCKα merits further investigation."

Class V myosins are a family of molecular motors thought to interact via their unique C-terminal tails with specific proteins for the targeted transport of organelles. BERP is highly expressed in brain and contains an N-terminal RING finger, followed by a B-box zinc finger, a coiled-coil (RBCC domain), and a unique C-terminal β-propeller domain.

Like myosin Va, BERP is expressed in a punctate pattern in the cytoplasm as well as in the neurites and growth cones of PC12 cells. We also found that the RBCC domain of BERP is involved in protein dimerization. Stable expression of a mutant form of BERP lacking the myosin-binding domain but containing the dimerization domain resulted in defective PC12 cell spreading and prevented neurite outgrowth in response to nerve growth factor.

Opitz G/BBB syndrome, a defect of midline development, is due to mutations in an RBCC gene spanning the pseudoautosomal boundary (6Palmer S. Perry J. Kipling D. Ashworth A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

XNF7 is a maternally expressed cytoplasmic protein that moves to the nucleus during mid-blastula transition, where it may regulate mitosis and dorsal ventral patterning of the embryo (8Reddy B.A. Kloc M. Etkin L. Dev. Biol. 1991; 148: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Chromosomal translocations that result in the fusion of the RBCC domain to other gene products are frequently oncogenic (1Saurin A.J. Borden K.L. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 3Kakizuka A. Miller Jr., W.H. Umesono K. Warrell Jr., R.P. Frankel S.R. Murty V.V. Dmitrovsky E. Evans R.M.

For example, fusion of the PML RBCC domain with retinoic acid receptor-α underlies acute promyelocytic leukemia (3Kakizuka A. Miller Jr., W.H. Umesono K. Warrell Jr., R.P. Frankel S.R. Murty V.V.

Another family of RING finger proteins is directly involved in the regulation of vesicular transport. The yeast RING finger protein Vac1 has been implicated in the regulation of vesicle docking and fusion via interactions with members of the syntaxin and Sec1 family (14Burd C.G. Peterson M. Cowles C.R. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1089-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). EEA1 and Hrs are early endosome-associated RING finger proteins (15Mu F.T. Callaghan J.M.

Neurodap1 has been implicated in protein sorting from the Golgi to the postsynaptic density in neurons (17Nakayama M. Miyake T. Gahara Y. Ohara O. Kitamura T. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rim1 is a neuron-enriched RING finger protein localized to presynaptic active zones and has been implicated in neurotransmitter exocytosis (18Wang Y. Okamoto M. Schmitz F. Hofmann K. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Finally, ARD1 is an RBCC protein that acts as a GTPase similar to the ARF family of proteins involved in the regulation of vesicular trafficking (19Mishima K. Tsuchiya M. Nightingale M.S. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8801-8807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, we report the identification of BERP, a novel member of the RBCC group of RING finger proteins that directly associates with the tail region of myosin V. The unconventional class V myosins are thought to interact via their C-terminal tails with specific proteins for the targeted transport of organelles within cells. BERP contains several protein-protein interaction motifs, making it a suitable adaptor protein for mediating myosin V cargo transport. Both BERP and myosin V are expressed with a punctate pattern in the cytoplasm and neurites of PC12 cells, a pattern characteristic for many organelle-associated proteins. Our results show that PC12 cells expressing a truncated form of BERP (lacking the C-terminal myosin-binding domain) do not respond to nerve growth factor with neurite outgrowth. These observations suggest that BERP may cooperate with myosin V in process outgrowth and the regulation of organelle transport. A BERP cDNA was generated from rat cerebellar mRNA during a search for nucleotide-binding proteins, using the degenerate PCR1forward primer 5′-TTI GCI TG(T/C) TGG (T/C)TI TGG AC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AAI ACC CA(G/A) CA(T/A) A(C/A)I A(G/A)(G/A) AA-3′. The resulting PCR product was subcloned into pCRII (Invitrogen), providing a 32P-labeled probe for screening a rat brain cDNA library. A full-length cDNA was obtained and sequenced. The first ATG codon (position 221) had a Kozak consensus sequence, and a potential poly(A) signal was present in the 3′-noncoding region. For Northern analysis, total RNA was extracted using the single-step method, and a 1200-base pair EcoRI fragment of the 3′-end of the rat BERP cDNA was used to generate 32P-labeled probes by random priming (Life Technologies, Inc.). To identify proteins interacting with BERP, the yeast two-hybrid system was used to screen a rat brain cDNA library subcloned into pGAD10 containing the GAL4 activation domain (CLONTECH MATCHMAKER system). Different regions of BERP were subcloned into pAS2-1 in frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain as baits, and target sequences were subcloned into pACT2 in frame with the GAL4 activation domain (see Table I). Plasmids from positive clones were identified by sequencing.Table IYeast two-hybrid analysis of BERP interactionsBaitTargetRBCC1RBCC2ABPLCBERP2HT2Amyr6pTD1RBCC1 (aaaaa, amino acids. 1–372)His+ and blueHis+ and blueRBCC2 (aa 1–262)His+ and blueHis+ and blueABPL (aa 285–495)CBERP1 (aa 383–744)His+ and blueCBERP2 (aa 459–744)His+ and blueCBERP3 (aa 620–744)His+ and blueTATHis+ and bluepVA3–1His+ and bluepLAM5Yeast two-hybrid analysis was carried out using the β-galactosidase filter lift assay.

Positive clones grew in medium lacking histidine (His+) and displayed a blue staining for thelacZ receptor gene. To insert the FLAG sequence at the N-terminal end of BERP, the BERP cDNA was digested withBstEII/PpuMI, and a forward primer containing the BstEII site followed by a FLAG sequence before the first ATG codon (5′-AACTGGTCACCGCCACCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGATGGCAAAGAGGGAGGAC-3′) and a reverse primer including the PpuMI site (5′-AGCCCAGTCTCAGTGCCT 3′) were used to generate a PCR product, which was subcloned into the BstEII/PpuMI site of the digested BERP cDNA. The BERP cDNA containing the FLAG sequence was then subcloned into XhoI/BamHI sites of pcDNA3. This FLAG-tagged, full-length BERP cDNA was digested with EcoRI and religated to give a construct coding for an Nterminal FLAG followed by the first 485 amino acids of BERP (NBERP). A histidine-tagged myr6 C-terminal region was amplified by PCR using the myr6 cDNA obtained from the yeast two-hybrid screening with the forward primer 5′-ACCATGCATCACCATCACCATCACGACCAAGCCATGCAGGAT-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GAAACAACGCATCCTCA-3′. PC12 cells were cultured on poly-d-lysine-coated plates in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal calf serum and plated at ∼30–50% confluency 1 day prior to transfection with 10–15 μg of DNA using the calcium phosphate method. To develop stable PC12 cell lines, fresh medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added after 3 days for selection. This medium was changed every 3–4 days, and surviving clones were collected and individually plated after 2 weeks in medium containing 200 μg/ml G418. Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG antibodies confirmed the expression of proteins of the predicted size. Cultured cells were fixed for 1 h with 4% paraformaldehyde, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 2% normal goat serum, and then processed for ABC immunoperoxidase staining (ABC Elite, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) using diaminobenzidine with nickel ammonium sulfate. Rabbits were immunized with a peptide corresponding to the last 9 amino acids of BERP conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Anti-BERP antibodies were affinity-purified using the C-terminal BERP peptide linked to activated thiol-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunoprecipitation, brain tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, whereas cell cultures were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 for 20 min at 4 °C with agitation. Lysates were incubated with antibodies for 1–2 h on ice, precipitated with protein A-Sepharose beads, and boiled in 40 μl of SDS sample buffer to extract immunoprecipitated proteins. Western blots were detected with ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A cDNA encoding a novel,brain-expressed RING fingerprotein (BERP) was discovered in a reverse transcription-PCR analysis of rat brain mRNA. The full-length BERP cDNA was then obtained by screening a rat brain cDNA library using this PCR product as a probe (Fig.1 a). Data base BLAST searches showed that this cDNA encoded a novel protein containing three motifs present in the RBCC subgroup of RING finger proteins (2Reddy B.A. Etkin L.D. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 344-345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Fig.1 b indicates the various motifs present in BERP. The N-terminal amino acids 22–62 compose the RING finger, and sequence alignments of various RING fingers show the conserved zinc-binding ligands (Fig. 1 c). Following the RING finger is the B-box, another form of zinc finger (Fig. 1 d), which in turn is followed by a coiled-coil domain (20Lupas A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). After the RBCC motif, BERP contains a domain of ∼130 amino acids (amino acids 290–420) that is 41% identical to a repeated domain present in the actin-binding proteins ABP-120 and ABP-280 (Fig.1 e) (21Gorlin J.B.

Stewart M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 607-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These repeats are thought to mediate protein-protein interactions (21Gorlin J.B. Yamin R. Egan S. Stewart M. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 22Noegel A.A. Rapp S. Lottspeich F. Schleicher M. Stewart M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 607-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The C terminus of BERP is characterized by the presence of six repeats of a novel domain very similar to kelch or WD repeats (Fig. 1 f) (23Bork P. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1277-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 24Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F.

Cell. 1998; 95: 563-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). A secondary structure analysis using prediction-based threading (26Rost B. Schneider R. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) is consistent with this domain forming a circular β-propeller with six blades, similar to that described for other WD and kelch proteins (27Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar,28Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Northern analysis indicated that the BERP transcript is ∼3 kilobases in size and is highly expressed in the brain. Moderate levels of BERP expression were seen in the lung, whereas the liver, kidney, and heart expressed only very low levels of BERP mRNA (Fig.2). In the brain, expression was highest in the cerebellum, although transcripts were detected in all brain regions examined (Fig. 2). The RBCC domain may serve as a protein oligomerization motif (1Saurin A.J. Borden K.L. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). To determine if the BERP RBCC domain is involved in BERP oligomerization, we first employed the yeast two-hybrid system using various BERP constructs subcloned into the pAS2-1 vector, which contains the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, and the pACT2 vector, which contains the GAL4 activation domain, to generate baits and targets, respectively. As shown in TableI, BERP sequences that contain the N-terminal RBCC domain (amino acids 1–372) were able to interact. Deletion of amino acids 263–372 did not abolish this interaction, indicating that the full coiled-coil domain is not necessary and that the first 262 amino acids, which include coils 1 and 2, are sufficient for BERP oligomerization. A biochemical method was used to confirm this interaction. A truncated form of BERP (NBERP, amino acids 1–485) that contains the RBCC domain but lacks the C-terminal β-propeller domain co-immunoprecipitated with full-length BERP from lysates of HEK-293 cells transfected with BERP and NBERP (Fig. 3). Thus, both the yeast two-hybrid analysis and immunoprecipitation experiments showed that BERP constructs containing the RBCC domain can associate together, supporting a role for the RBCC motif in protein homodimerizationin vivo. HT2A is a human RBCC protein that shows significant overall homology to BERP and contains a similar C-terminal β-propeller domain. It was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screening for proteins that interact with the human immunodeficiency virus protein Tat, and the last 120 amino acids of HT2A were sufficient for Tat binding (13Fridell R.A. Harding L.S. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. Virology. 1995; 209: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Because of the high similarity between the C-terminal β-propeller domains of BERP and HT2A (∼30% identity), we examined whether BERP could also interact with the human immunodeficiency virus Tat protein. Several baits that contained BERP C-terminal sequences were used (Table I). The C-terminal region of HT2A was used as a positive control and interacted strongly with Tat, as reported by Fridell et al. (13Fridell R.A. Harding L.S. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. Virology. 1995; 209: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In contrast, none of the BERP baits showed a positive interaction with Tat. This suggests that HT2A-specific sequences that are absent from BERP are involved in the interaction between HT2A and Tat. The cellular proteins that interact with HT2A have not yet been identified. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify proteins that may interact with BERP. From 15 × 106 transformants, 10 positive clones were isolated when a bait that included amino acids 383–744 of BERP was used for screening. Two of these showed specific interaction with the C-terminal domain of BERP (Table I). Sequencing analysis indicated that both positives represented the same C-terminal region (the last 641 amino acids) of a recently identified unconventional class V myosin, myr6 (myosin Vb) (29Zhao L.P. Koslovsky J.S. Reinhard J. Bahler M. Witt A.E. Provance Jr., D.W. Mercer J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10826-10831Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Various BERP C-terminal baits were able to interact with the myosin Vb C-terminal region (Table I). A bait comprising only the last 124 amino acids of BERP was sufficient. The interaction between BERP and myosin Vb was confirmed by immunoprecipitation. Anti-FLAG antibodies could immunoprecipitate FLAG-tagged, full-length BERP together with a His-tagged myosin Vb C-terminal tail domain from lysates of HEK-293 cells cotransfected with these constructs (Fig. 4). Thus, in both yeast and mammalian cells, BERP can directly interact with the tail domain of the mammalian class V myosin myr6. The protein encoded by the dilute locus, myosin Va, is a class V myosin that is highly expressed in the brain (30Mercer J.A. Seperack P.K. Strobel M.C. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nature. 1991; 349: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) and is closely related to myr6 (78% identity) (29Zhao L.P. Koslovsky J.S. Reinhard J. Bahler M. Witt A.E. Provance Jr., D.W. Mercer J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10826-10831Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To determine if BERP could also associate with myosin Va, antibodies against this protein (31Evans L.L. Hammer J. Bridgman P.C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 439-449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used for immunoprecipitation experiments using rat brain extracts (Fig. 5). Affinity-purified anti-BERP antibodies that recognize endogenous BERP from brain extracts were used for detection of immunoprecipitated BERP (Fig.5 A). Endogenous BERP co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous myosin Va from cortex and cerebellar extracts (Fig. 5 B). These results indicate that BERP is an in vivo partner of class V myosin in brain tissue. To examine the distribution of BERP in PC12 cells, we generated stable cells lines expressing BERP with a FLAG epitope tag at its N terminus and then used anti-FLAG antibodies for immunostaining. Expression of the predicted size full-length BERP protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG antibodies (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 6 (A andB), BERP is expressed in the cytoplasm with a punctate pattern similar to that of endogenous myosin Va, a pattern characteristic of organelle-associated proteins. BERP was also expressed in the cytoplasm of other transfected cell lines, including HEK-293 cells, NIH-3T3 cells, and COS-7 cells, indicating that the cytoplasmic localization of BERP is not unique to PC12 cells (data not shown). After NGF treatment, both myosin Va (Fig. 6 C) and full-length BERP (Fig. 6 D) were present in puncta in the cell cytoplasm as well as in the processes and growth cones that had extended from these cells. Myosin Va appears to play a role in neurite extension and growth cone development (32Wang F.S. Wolenski J.S. Cheney R.E. Mooseker M.S. Jay D.G. Science. 1996; 273: 660-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Since BERP interacts with the tail of the class V myosins, we examined the effect of expression of NBERP, a truncated form of BERP that lacks the myosin-binding domain, on the growth and differentiation of PC12 cells. For this purpose, stable cell lines expressing FLAG-tagged NBERP were generated. Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG antibodies confirmed the expression of proteins of the predicted sizes (data not shown). Significantly, cells expressing NBERP were small and rapidly dividing and formed tightly clustered aggregates. This phenotype and staining pattern were observed in 10 independently derived cell lines expressing NBERP. We next examined how the expression of BERP and NBERP affected the differentiation of PC12 cells induced by NGF. The transfected PC12 cell lines were treated with NGF for 7 days and then fixed and immunostained. Neurite outgrowth was monitored either with phase-contrast microscopy (Fig. 7,a–c) or after immunostaining for myosin Va, which stains cell bodies and neurites (Fig. 7, d–f). Cell lines transfected with empty vector (Fig. 7, a and d) or full-length BERP (Fig. 7, b and e) as well as untransfected PC12 cells (data not shown) responded to NGF treatments, ceased dividing, and developed long processes. Surprisingly, none of the cell lines expressing NBERP responded to NGF with differentiation and the production of neurites (Fig. 7, cand f). Instead, these cells continued to proliferate rapidly like the NBERP cell lines that had not received NGF treatment. We have identified a novel RING finger protein (BERP) that interacts directly with class V myosins. BERP binding to the C-terminal tail of the mammalian class V myosin (myr6) was demonstrated in the yeast two-hybrid system and confirmed by immunoprecipitation. BERP was also found to associate with the closely related myosin Va in brain extracts. Expression of a truncated form of BERP lacking this myosin-binding domain resulted in abnormal cell aggregation and defective cell spreading. Furthermore, expression of this truncated form prevented NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. BERP belongs to the RBCC subgroup of RING finger proteins, which contain a second zinc finger known as the B-box followed by a coiled-coil domain (1Saurin A.J. Borden K.L. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 2Reddy B.A. Etkin L.D. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 344-345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The RBCC domain may mediate protein oligomerization, and RBCC proteins are often found in large complexes, perhaps acting as scaffolding elements (33Cao T. Borden K.L. Freemont P.S. Etkin L.D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we have found that the RBCC domain is also necessary for BERP dimerization. Cell transfection and immunoprecipitation demonstrated that full-length BERP associates with a truncated form containing the RBCC domain but lacking C-terminal sequences. These results provide direct evidence for a role for the RBCC domain in protein homo-oligomerization. Because the RBCC structure is highly conserved in a number of proteins, this domain may also allow various members of the RBCC group to physically interact. Immediately after the RBCC motif, BERP contains a domain highly similar to a repeating domain found in the actin-binding proteins ABP-120 and ABP-280 (21Gorlin J.B. Yamin R. Egan S. Stewart M. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 22Noegel A.A. Rapp S. Lottspeich F. Schleicher M. Stewart M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 607-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These repeats each form an immunoglobulin-like fold and mediate protein-protein interactions with the high affinity IgG receptor, β2-integrin, the stress-activated protein kinase activator SEK-1, and the presenilins (34Fucini P. Renner C. Herberhold C. Noegel A.A. Holak T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The high similarity between the repeats present in the ABP proteins and that found in BERP suggests that the BERP ABP-like repeat may allow similar protein interactions. The C terminus of BERP is characterized by the presence of six repeats of a novel domain very similar to kelch or WD repeats (23Bork P. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1277-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 24Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). Secondary structure predictions (26Rost B. Schneider R. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) are consistent with this domain forming a circular β-propeller with six blades (27Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A.

Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). In BERP, the variable N-terminal portions of each repeat, together with the d-strands (Fig. 1 f), would be displayed on the outer surface of each blade and provide sites for protein-protein interactions (27Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar,28Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). This structure is found in a variety of proteins involved in signal transduction, RNA processing, gene regulation, vesicle fusion, and cytoskeletal assembly (24Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). Our work identifies a novel function for the β-propeller domain. We show that the β-propeller domain of BERP directly interacts with the tail region of the molecular motor myosin V. Recently, a β-propeller domain has also been identified in clathrin, a vesicle coat protein regulating vesicle transport that interacts with multiple partners, including the AP1 and AP2 sorting adaptor complexes (25Haar E. Musacchio A. Harrison S.C. Kirchhausen T. Cell. 1998; 95: 563-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Similarly, the various domains found in BERP, including the β-propeller, the RBCC domain, and the ABP-like repeat, may mediate interactions with various proteins, allowing cargo transport via a myosin V-mediated pathway. Data base searches identified sequences very similar to the C-terminal β-propeller of BERP in a recently identified mycobacterial serine-threonine protein kinase, Mbk (35Peirs P. De Wit L. Braibant M. Huygen K. Content J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 604-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and in two other mammalian RBCC proteins, HT2A (13Fridell R.A. Harding L.S. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. Virology. 1995; 209: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and KIAA0517 (36Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Indeed, BERP shows an overall similarity of ∼35% to HT2A and is 65% identical to KIAA0517, a protein identified through random sequencing of large protein-coding sequences from brain (36Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The cellular functions of these proteins are not yet known; however, the Arabidopsisprotein COP1, which acts as a photomorphogenic repressor, also has an N-terminal RING finger, a coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal β-propeller, although it lacks a B-box (37McNellis T.W. Torii K.U. Deng X.W. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1491-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Together, these molecules form a novel family of RING finger-β-propeller proteins. The class V myosins are among the most well characterized of the unconventional myosins, and there is evidence that they participate in organelle trafficking (38Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 633-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Mutations in yeast myosin V (Myo2p) result in vesicle accumulation (39Johnston G.C. Prendergast J.A. Singer R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 539-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In melanocytes, myosin Va associates with melanosomes, allowing their delivery along the dendrites to the keratinocytes (40Wu X. Bowers B. Wei Q. Kocher B. Hammer III, J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 847-859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Myosin V has also been suggested to function as an actin-based organelle motor in neurons. Indeed, myosin Va binds to synaptic vesicles through interactions with synaptobrevin and synaptophysin (41Prekeris R. Terrian D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1589-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that myosin Va is concentrated in a punctate pattern in organelle-rich regions of the growth cone (31Evans L.L. Hammer J. Bridgman P.C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 439-449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data are consistent with an important role for class V myosins in the transport of specific organelles to sites of outgrowth. Indeed, our results show that both BERP and myosin Va are expressed with a punctate pattern in the neurites and growth cones of PC12 cells, a localization characteristic of organelle-associated proteins (15Mu F.T. Callaghan J.M. Steele-Mortimer O. Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Campbell P.L. McCluskey J. Yeo J.-P. Tock E.P.C. Toh B.-H. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 847-859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A role for myosin V in regulating cell spreading and motility has also been suggested (42Cramer L.P. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), and inactivation of myosin Va using the chromophore-associated laser technique resulted in defects in filopodial extension of neuronal growth cones (32Wang F.S. Wolenski J.S. Cheney R.E. Mooseker M.S. Jay D.G. Science. 1996; 273: 660-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The phenotype observed in PC12 cells expressing NBERP indicates a defect in cell spreading that may have resulted from disruption of the interaction between endogenous BERP and myosin V. Furthermore, cells expressing NBERP continued to rapidly proliferate and failed to generate neurites in response to NGF. If BERP interacts directly with myosin V, one would predict that a dominant-negative interference with BERP function would result in a phenotype reflecting a disruption in myosin V function. Indeed, expression of an N-terminal fragment of COP1 containing the RING finger and coiled-coil, but lacking the C-terminal β-propeller, caused a dominant-negative phenotype in transgenic plants (37McNellis T.W. Torii K.U. Deng X.W. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1491-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrated that the BERP RBCC domain mediates protein dimerization and that PC12 cells do express endogenous BERP. Thus, it is likely that NBERP can act in a dominant-negative manner, dimerizing with wild-type BERP and suppressing its function. Together, these data indicate that BERP interactions with class V myosins may be important in organelle transport and neurite outgrowth.

J., and Tappel, A. L. (1969)Biochemistry 8, 2821–2827). Its concentration is raised in diabetic subjects probably as a side effect of increased protein glycation. Collagen has enzyme-catalyzed cross-links formed between its individual molecules that are essential for maintaining the structure and flexibility of the collagen fiber. The cross-link dehydro-hydroxylysinonorleucine reacts irreversibly with 10 mm malondialdehyde at least 3 orders of magnitude faster than glucose reactions with lysine or arginine, such that there is little cross-link left after 1 h at 37 °C. Other cross-links and glycated elements of collagen are also vulnerable. Several possible products of malondialdehyde with collagen cross-links are proposed, and the potential involvement of collagenous histidine in these reactions is discussed. We have also isolatedN δ-(2-pyrimidyl)-l-ornithine from collagenous arginine reacted with malondialdehyde. The yields of this product were considerably higher than those from model reactions, being approximately 2 molecules/collagen molecule after 1 day at 37 °C in 10 mm malondialdehyde. Collagenous lysine-derived malondialdehyde products may have been present but were not protected from protein acid hydrolysis by standard reduction techniques, thus resulting in a multitude of fragmented products.

Delbridge L. Yue D.K. Reeve T.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The two major products are malondialdehyde (MDA)1 and 4-hydroxynonenal (2Esterbauer H. Gebicki J. Pulh H. Jurgens G. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1992; 12: 341-390Crossref Scopus (2150) Google Scholar). MDA is very reactive and reacts with nucleophilic amine groups such as lysine, arginine, and the amino termini of amino acids (3Requena J.R. Fu M.X. Ahmed M.U. Jenkins A.J. Lyons T.J. Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 4Chio K.J. Tappel A.L. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 2821-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 5Slatter D.A. Murray M. Bailey A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It also reacts with any ketones or aldehydes from other sources, for example attached sugars or glycation products. Of particular importance is the bifunctional aldehydic property of MDA, which gives it the potential to cross-link proteins, thereby reducing their functional capacity. It is well established that the aorta stiffens with age, a process accelerated in diabetes, and a contributing factor is the glycation cross-linking of the structural framework of collagen (6Brownlee M. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 836-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 7Sims T.J. Rasmussen L.M. Oxlund H. Bailey A.J. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 946-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The production of MDA from low density lipoprotein (LDL) provides another potential cross-linking agent. Physiologically, LDL insudates the arterial intima, and in developing atheroma, the LDL oxidation products and collagen are in intimate contact. We have therefore suggested that the LDL-derived MDA may be responsible, at least in part, for the stiffening of the vascular system in aging, a process that is accelerated in diabetes mellitus, because of increased glycation of the collagen. The expected MDA cross-link after reduction based on previous reports is the imidopropene structure 1,3-di(N ε-lysino)propane (see Fig. 1), bridging two lysines through the reaction with the aldehyde groups. Significantly, it has not been detected directly by NMR at neutral pH in water, despite extensive chemical research (3Requena J.R. Fu M.X. Ahmed M.U. Jenkins A.J. Lyons T.J. Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 4Chio K.J. Tappel A.L. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 2821-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 5Slatter D.A. Murray M.

The cross-link has always been detected as a borohydride-reduced product (3Requena J.R. Fu M.X. Ahmed M.U. Jenkins A.J. Lyons T.J. Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 4Chio K.J. Tappel A.L.

Cooper C.S. Vietti D.E. Turner G.A. Lipids. 1986; 21: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), or when synthesized in dry, acidic ethanol (9Nair V. Cooper C.S. Vietti D.E. Turner G.A. Lipids. 1986; 21: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, when Summerfield and Tappel (10Summerfield F.W. Tappel A.L. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 111: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 11Summerfield F.W. Tappel A.L. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 143: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) reported the MDA cross-linking of DNA, they were unable to find a similar cross-link despite the use of the borohydride reduction protocol. The structure of these cross-links remains unknown. Interestingly, the pK a of MDA is 4.46, and its presence in the salt form at neutral pH suggests that the differences reported may be due to the different reaction conditions. At neutral pH, we were unable to detect the imidopropene but reported that another molecule, Nlysyl-4-methyl-2,6-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarbaldehyde (NLMDD), may be the MDA-derived protein cross-link (see Fig. 1 and Ref. 5Slatter D.A. Murray M. Bailey A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The cross-link form of NLMDD with added amine-derivatives was detected in electron impact mass spectroscopy at neutral pH. Although this link is likely to be in rapid exchange with the nonlinked form (consistent with NMR data) and thus likely to be a relatively weak cross-link, the NLMDD molecule is stable compared with 1,3-di(N ε-lysino)propane and thus has a permanent rather than transient effect. The major collagens in aorta and atheroma are types I and III fibrous collagens that are cross-linked enzymically to produce a stable fiber possessing a long biological half-life. Although aorta collagen contains a complex of mature and immature cross-links derived from (hydroxy)lysine and (hydroxy)lysine aldehyde, the reactions of MDA with collagen can be simplified by the use of rat tail tendon collagen. The tendon collagen is initially stabilized by oxidative deamination of the telopeptide lysines to lysine aldehyde. Lysyl oxidase (12Siegel R.C. Int. Rev. Connective Tissue Res. 1979; 8: 73-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) catalyzes this by binding to the specific sequence Hyl-Gly-His-Arg- in an adjacent molecule but located opposite the telopeptide because of the quarter-staggered alignment of the molecules in the fiber (13Bailey A.J. Light N.D. Atkins E.D.T. Nature. 1980; 288: 408-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These modifications of the collagen fiber result in the formation of the intramolecular aldol condensation product (AcP) cross-link (see Fig. 1) and the intermolecular cross-link dehydro-hydroxylysinonorleucine (dehydro-HLNL; see Fig. 1 and Ref. 14Bailey A.J. Peach C.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 33: 812-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The latter divalent cross-link is detectable by borohydride reduction but in vivo subsequently matures to a nonreducible stable trivalent cross-link, histidinohydroxylysinonorleucine (14Bailey A.J. Peach C.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 33: 812-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The intermolecular cross-link dehydro-HHMD (Fig.1) is also commonly detected but may be an artifact of the borohydride reduction technique (16Robins S.P. Bailey A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 48: 76-84Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 17Bernstein P.H. Mechanic G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10414-10422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The low turnover of collagen can be further decreased by additional cross-linking between the reactive amino acid side chains and MDA or sugars. This stiffens many tissues (e.g. arteries). With this in mind we have attempted to determine the mechanism of reaction of MDA with collagen under physiological conditions and isolate the collagen-MDA cross-links. Unless otherwise specified, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma (Poole, Dorset, UK), Fisher (Loughborough, Leicestershire, UK), or Aldrich (Gilling, Dorset). [2-14C]1,3-Propanediol (3.7 MBq in 2.5 ml) was obtained in water solvent from American Radiochemicals (Tocris Cookson, Langford, Avon, UK), and [3H]sodium borohydride (3.7 GBq extended to 100 mg) obtained from Nycomed Amersham (Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK). High pressure liquid chromatography grade solvents were all used prefiltered (0.22 μm) and obtained from Rathburn Chemicals (Walkerburn, Peebleshire, Scotland, UK). Type I collagen fibers were obtained from the tail tendons of 3–4-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats following slaughter and stored in physiological saline at −20 °C until required. [2-14C]Malondialdehyde was made from [2-14C]1,3-propanediol using the protocol from Summerfield and Tappel (18Summerfield F.W. Tappel A.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 82: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Nonradioactive MDA was prepared as described previously by recrystallization from controlled acidic hydrolysis of 1,1,3,3-tetra-ethoxypropane (5Slatter D.A. Murray M. Bailey A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The collagen concentration was accurately determined by a hydroxyproline assay using a continuous flow autoanalyzer (ChemLab, Cambridge, UK). 100 mg collagen was reduced with 10 mg of sodium borohydride, washed, reduced again with 10 mg tritiated sodium borohydride, and hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl for 18 h. Analysis of the freeze-dried and redissolved acid hydrolysate on an ion exchange column failed to reveal any radioactive peaks, indicating that collagen cross-links are fully reduced by the initial protocol. Rat tail tendon has a well established profile of reducible enzymic cross-links, identified following tritiated borohydride reduction, which is shown in Fig. 2. To identify MDA products, we reacted MDA with native collagen followed by reduction of collagen-MDA reaction products and existing reducible cross-links with tritiated borohydride. We also followed the reaction of collagen and MDA by the use of synthesized 14C-labeled MDA in an attempt to isolate 14C modified cross-links. Following reduction of the MDA native collagen products with tritiated borohydride, we could not detect the presence of3H-labeled cross-links HLNL or HHMD (Fig. 2), suggesting that they might be involved in the reaction with MDA. It was therefore decided to carry out reaction rate studies with MDA by partially reducing collagen. We could only detect HLNL when the partial reduction was followed by a tritiated reduction; dehydro-HHMD is more rapidly reduced in these mild conditions. Approximately 500 mg (dry weight) of rat tail tendon was reduced by addition of 15 mg of sodium borohydride for 1 h at 20 °C in 50 ml of 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. The borohydride was removed from the collagen fibers by five successive washings with 100 ml of Milli-Q water. 100-mg portions of the collagen were then reacted with 10 ml of 10 mm nonradioactive MDA in phosphate buffer for 1–96 h at 37 °C. After washing off the MDA using Milli-Q water in the same ratio, the resultant glycated collagen was then reduced again using 3 mg of tritiated sodium borohydride to give samples rColM1r*, rColM5r*, rColM24r*, and rColM96r*. The remaining 100 mg were used as a control where no MDA was added to give sample rColM0r* (Scheme 1). MDA-collagen was prepared as follows: (i) 3 ml of 160 μm (0.21 GBq) radioactive [2-14C]MDA was reacted with 100 mg of tendon collagen for 48 h in phosphate buffer at 37 °C and then with a total of 10 ml 10 mm MDA for 24 h by adding 7 ml of 14.2 mm MDA. Excess MDA was removed by washing, and tendons were then reduced with 10 mg of tritiated sodium borohydride to give sample ColM*R*. (ii) 100 mg of tendon was incubated in phosphate buffer alone for 3 days before tritiated borohydride reduction to give a standard collagen cross-link profile ColR*. Native collagen (1 g) was treated with 100 ml of nonradioactive MDA in phosphate buffer and then with 100 mg of nonradioactive sodium borohydride in the same manner as ColM*R* to give sample ColMR. This preparation was spiked with the tritium-labeled ColM*R* during initial separations to allow location of 14C products. Once the separation was adequately characterized by ninhydrin detection and absorbance at 254 nm, the spiking was discontinued. A summary of all the in vitro sample preparations is given in Scheme 1. Separations on sample ColMR, loaded at 50 mg/ml, were performed on a 950 × 25-mm column packed with Bio-gel P2 and equilibrated in 10% acetic acid running at 0.5 ml/min. 5-ml fractions were collected after loading the sample, and reproducibility was checked by UV monitoring at 254 nm. The column was re-equilibrated overnight. A Duolite 225 cation exchange resin (600 × 12 mm) column running in a 60 °C water jacket was used to separate components by charge using a pyridine buffer system as described previously (19Light N.D. Bailey A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 360-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The radioactive peaks were identified for both columns by counting the collected fractions on a LKB Wallac 1219 Rack Beta scintillation counter. To locate the radioactive peaks in relation to the standard collagenous amino acids, 2-μl aliquots from 5.0-ml column fractions were spotted on Whatman No. 1 paper, and amino acid peaks were detected by spraying with ninhydrin (0.25% w/v in acetone). Following separation on the P2 and then the Duolite column, the ColMR sample fractions were freeze-dried and run in 0.5-ml aliquots on an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Superdex HR 10/30 hydrophobic interaction column in 45% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Aliquots of the purified, preparative samples were run on a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Alpha Plus amino acid analyzer using a method for separating collagen and elastin cross-links (20Sims T.J. Bailey A.J. J. Chromatogr. Biomed. App. 1992; 582: 49-55Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 21Sims T.J. Avery N.C. Bailey A.J. Streuli C. Grant M. Methods in Molecular Biology: Extracellular Matrix. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999Google Scholar). An Amersham Pharmacia Biotech UltroPac 4B cation exchange resin (270 × 4 mm) was used with a Dionex AI 450 data collection system. A sample of skin was obtained from a 62-year-old male insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patient (disease duration 55 years). Excess fat was scraped from the skin prior to defatting in chloroform/methanol (2:1) overnight. The sample was then air dried, weighed, and hydrolyzed under reflux at 110 °C for 18 h in the presence of 6 n HCl (10 mg/ml). The acid was removed by rotary evaporation followed by freeze drying. The hydrolysate was reconstituted in Milli Q water, and the hydroxyproline content was measured using an automatic hydroxyproline analyzer (ChemLab). Aliquots of the sample were then fractionated using ion exchange chromatography as described above. Fractions from successive runs were pooled, freeze dried, and characterized by amino acid analysis using the Alpha Plus analyzer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 10 mm MDA was reacted with 15 mm Nα-acetyl-arginine and 9 mm Nα-acetyl-lysine, in 100 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 60 °C for 3 days, following which only a trace of the MDA remained. The mixture, MRL60, was then analyzed by NMR. 10 mm Nα-acetyl-lysine and 20 mm MDA were incubated for 4 days at 60 °C to synthesize an impure mixture containing NLMDD (sample ML60). The mixture was diluted with concentrated HCl to give a 6 n HCl solution, hydrolyzed at 110 °C for 18 h, freeze-dried, taken up in the same volume of water (600 μl), pH adjusted to 7.5, and analyzed by NMR (sample ML60Hy). In subsequent investigations, propylamine was used instead ofNα-acetyl-lysine to simplify NMR spectra interpretation. Consequently, the nitrogen substituent on its equivalent MDA product to NLMDD is a propyl rather than a lysyl group, changing the abbreviation to NPMDD. The pH of an NPMDD solution MP60 (equivalent to ML60) was reduced to 2.3 using HCl and 100 mm glycine/HCl pH 2.3 buffer added. 100 mm sodium cyanoborohydride was then used as reducing agent for 2 days at 37 °C, causing a small increase in pH to 2.55. Most of the glycine buffer and reducing agent were removed by dialysis in 2 liters of water for 48 h (one change) using a 100 molecular weight cut-off Spectraphor membrane to give sample MP60CN. The sample was then acid hydrolyzed and freeze dried for NMR analysis (sample MP60CNHy). Samples generated by the above protocols were made up in 600 μl of 10% D2O (100 mm phosphate, pH 7.5) for1H NMR analysis on a Jeol 500 MHz NMR spectrometer. Typically, 128 scans at 25 °C were taken, using a DANTE (delays alternating with nutation for tailored excitation) pulse for water peak suppression. 40 μm trimethylsilylpropionic acid was added to the sample for calibration so that concentrations could be worked out by comparison. One-dimensional NMR Peaks were grouped into spin systems by running two-dimensional total correlation NMR experiments (22Bax A. Davies D.G. Sarkar S.K. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 63: 230-234Google Scholar) with a mixing time of 60 ms (512 rows, 16 scans) and by integrating the area under the one-dimensional peaks. The same samples used for NMR analysis were then diluted appropriately in water. Electrospray mass spectrometry was done using a Micromass instrument and delayed extraction matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (DE-MALDI-TOF) using a PerSpective Biosystems Voyager instrument. Dehydro-HLNL remaining after a partial sodium borohydride reduction is shown by its presence as radioactive HLNL after a second [3H]borohydride reduction, which shows only trace amounts of other unreduced lysine derivatives. Fig.3 shows the effect of 10 mmmalondialdehyde on this pretreated collagen, as measured by the subsequent labeling with tritiated borohydride at time points from 1 to 96 h. After partial reduction of collagen, the remaining dehydro-HLNL (detected by the tritiated HLNL peak at fractions 51–52, Fig. 3) rapidly declines such that within 1 h in 10 mm MDA at 37 °C, it is no more than 20% of its initial concentration. Within the same time period, a major product peak becomes visible at fractions 53–55. Internal ninhydrin spray controls of the elution volumes of normal collagen amino acids remained constant, confirming the reproducibility of the chromatography. Assuming then, that the half-life of dehydro-HLNL in 10 mm MDA is less than half an hour and that the MDA concentration is much larger and does not significantly change in this short time period, we can calculate a pseudo-second order rate constantk 1 as approximately 40m−1 s−1. This allows a half-life of the (unprotected) cross-link of less than 250 days at the normal steady-state physiological plasma free MDA concentrations of 50 nm (23Yeo H.C. Helboch H.J. Chuyu D.W. Ames B.N. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, there is some confusion over what the plasma concentration really is because of the difficulty in designing a relevant test (24Draper H.H. Squires E.J. Mahmoodi H. Wu J. Agarwal S. Hadley M. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1993; 15: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Estimates rise to 1 μm or more (25Volpi N. Tarugi P. J. Chromatogr.

Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5936) Google Scholar), although most of these are likely to include protein-bound MDA on protocol examination. Free MDA concentrations higher than 50 nm would cause a concurrent decrease in the half-life of the collagen cross-link. Where it is measured, MDA concentration tends to double for diabetic subjects (27Noberasco G. Odetti P. Boeri D. Maiello M. Adezati L. Biomed. Pharmacother. 1991; 45: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 31Esterbauer H. Schar R.J. Zollner H. Free Radical Biol.

Because dehydro-HHMD may also possess a similar imine cross-link, it could be inferred that it also reacts quickly with MDA. By the end of 1 day in a reaction between native collagen and MDA (Fig. 2), it can no longer be detected. If HHMD is indeed an artifact, it could be that the MDA reacts with the aldol condensation product, thus preventing the formation of HHMD during borohydride reduction. Such a reaction would normally be faster than an imine-MDA reaction because of the reactivity of aldehydes and because MDA could react in its predominant salt-form. As time progresses in the experiment, peaks appear at fractions 57–59 and 62–63 within an hour and become larger in 5 h, reaching a maximum in 1 day, by which time peaks at around fractions 70 and 81 have also become evident, along with some small peaks in fractions 15–40 (Fig. 3). Incubation for longer periods of time results in only a minor rearrangement of the peaks from 50–85; for the most part the reaction is complete after 1 day. The number and diversity of these peaks make it unlikely that they are all derived from dehydro-HLNL, suggesting that partially reduced collagen has elements that can react with MDA to form new reducible products. From this experiment, MDA is shown to attack dehydro-HLNL in a manner at least 3 orders of magnitude faster than, for example, the reaction of glucose with amine groups in hemoglobin (33Higgins P.J. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5204-5208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Lowrey C.H. Lyness S.J. Soeldner J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11611-11618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or albumin (35Schleicher E. Weiland O.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 884: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) to form ketoamine adducts (the initial product) in similar conditions. Having established that the MDA reaction with collagen is more or less complete in 1 day, the second stage of the investigation was to find out the fate of the MDA. [2-14C]MDA was used in collagen incubations in preference to [1-14C]MDA because some of the reactivity in the latter compound would be lost as formic acid because of the self-cleavage reaction that MDA undergoes over time. The [2-14C]MDA will either react as MDA or as the still 100% labeled acetaldehyde when the MDA does self-cleave to a small extent. To maximize radioactive incorporation, collagen was initially reacted with the radiolabel at comparatively low MDA concentrations (160 μm) for 2 days (see “Materials and Methods”). The low concentration would also mimic the physiological condition. However, to isolate sufficient material for analysis, the MDA concentration was increased to 10 mm by nonradioactive MDA for a further day before acid hydrolysis. Fig. 4 shows the 14C count traces from an ion exchange separation of sample ColM*R*, with the3H traces shown in Fig. 2 given for comparison. The result is that there are only two peaks in the entire mixture that contain the MDA carbon label, namely peaks at fractions 48 and 49 and at fractions 21 and 22. Both of these appear to be marginally reducible with sodium borohydride as seen from concurrent 3H peaks. The surprising inference is that all the other reducible products in Figs.2 and 4 are formed as a result of MDA reaction with collagen but do not actually contain MDA. These data show that hexosyl-lysine-derived aldimine Schiff base adducts react with MDA. This is shown by the marked drop in their reduction products hexosyl-lysine and hexosylhydroxylysine seen at fraction 38 and fractions 41 and 42 (Fig. 2, c and d) and by the drop of the acid hydrolysis artifact, the anhydro derivative of these reduced products (Fig. 2, peak e). Dehydro-HHMD reacts avidly with MDA, its reduced HHMD peak at fractions 82–84 entirely disappearing in 1 day and the product possibly being the new peak close by at fractions 79–83. Dehydro-HLNL can no longer be detected as a visible peak after the same time period with MDA. Fig.5 shows the 14C trace from three 100-mg (2 ml at 50 mg/ml) P2 Bio-gel runs of sample ColMR spiked with 200 μl of the ColM*R* sample at 10 mg/ml. Most of the amino acids eluted between fractions 60 and 68 as determined by a ninhydrin spray test. The major radioactive carbon peaks were collected and freeze dried (Fig. 5, peak A, fractions 55 and 56; peak B, fractions 57–61; peak C, fractions 75–79). The major fraction A gave an observable color on a ninhydrin spray test, allowing further P2 runs to be made with confidence without the radioactive spiking. The early peak at fractions 37–42 proved to be an unidentified high molecular weight mixture that eluted at the column void volume. The three peaks (Fig. 5,peaks A, B, and C) were then run separately on the Duolite ion exchange column. Fraction A ran to give a single carbon radioactive peak, namely the peak previously observed at fractions 48–49 in Fig. 4 (fraction A48). Fraction B proved to be a mixture of the 48–49 fraction in Fig. 4 and a very small 26 fraction that can just be observed (fraction B26); this could be expected given its overlap with Fraction A in the P2 column. Fraction C eluted to give a single 14C carbon peak at fractions 21 and 22 (fraction C21), synonymous with the other 14C carbon peak previously seen in Fig. 4. Fraction A48, however, was not only identifiable as ninhydrin positive but also gave a single peak in the region of interest on an amino acid analysis run (Fig.6), where many lysine derivatives elute close by but remote from any previously identified compound. Fractions from these ion exchange separations were concentrated, further purified using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech HR10/30 Superdex column, and investigated by1H NMR spectroscopy. Fraction B26 was at too low a concentration for useful analysis by NMR, and no ninhydrin-positive peaks could be observed using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech amino acid analysis system, suggesting that it was an acid breakdown fragment. Fraction C21 gave a ninhydrin-positive peak in the same position as glycine, but there were too few NMR signals for it to be big enough to be a sid"

To investigate this possibility a series of experiments was performed using apical membranes from rat colon which were enriched in colonic H+,K+-ATPase protein. An antibody specific for HKα2 was employed to determine whether HKα2 functions under physiological conditions as a Na+-dependent or Na+-independent K+-ATPase in this same membrane fraction. K+-ATPase activity was measured as [γ-32P]ATP hydrolysis. The Na+-dependent K+-ATPase accounted for approximately 80% of overall K+-ATPase activity and was characterized by insensitivity to Sch-28080 but partial sensitivity to ouabain. The Na+-independent K+-ATPase activity was insensitive to both Sch-28080 and ouabain. Both types of K+-ATPase activity substituted NH4+ for K+ in a similar manner. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that when incubated with native distal colon membranes, the blocking antibody inhibited dramatically Na+-dependent K+-ATPase activity. Therefore, these data demonstrate that HKα2 can function in native distal colon apical membranes as a Na+-dependent K+-ATPase.

It has been demonstrated, using the Xenopus laevis oocyte as an expression system, that HKα2 can internalize Rb+ (K+) in exchange for H+ when coexpressed with any known X+,K+-ATPase β-subunit (3Cougnon M.

Furthermore, HKα2 was insensitive to Sch-28080, a specific inhibitor of the gastric H+,K+-ATPase, but partially sensitive to ouabain (IC50 ∼ 400–600 μm) (3Cougnon M. Planelles G. Crowson M.S.

HKα2 mRNA and protein are expressed in low abundance in the renal medulla (2Crowson M.S. Shull G.E. J. Biol.

Pressley T.A. DuBose Jr., T.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F22-F30PubMed Google Scholar). However, HKα2 mRNA and protein abundance in the kidney are dramatically augmented by chronic dietary K+-depletion (6DuBose Jr., T.D. Codina J. Burges A. Pressley T.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F500-F507PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kraut J.A. Hiura J. Besancon M. Smolka A. Sachs G. Scott D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F744-F750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sangan P.

Physiol. 1998; 275: F433-F440PubMed Google Scholar). This finding indicates that HKα2 may play a major role in renal K+ conservation. Furthermore, the site of this regulatory response to chronic hypokalemia has been shown to be the renal medulla (10Codina J. Delmas-Mata J.T. DuBose Jr., T.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F433-F440PubMed Google Scholar). Based on data obtained using heterologous expression systems it has been predicted that the increase in K+-reabsorption in the collecting tubule during chronic hypokalemia would be insensitive to Sch-28080 in vivo. Nevertheless, several laboratories which have evaluated HCO3− reabsorption during chronic hypokalemia have defined H+,K+-ATPase function by its sensitivity to Sch-28080. For example, Wall et al. (11Wall S.M. Mehta P. DuBose Jr., T.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F543-F549PubMed Google Scholar) and Nakamuraet al. (12Nakamura S. Wang Z. Galla J.H. Soleimani M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F687-F692PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the increase in bicarbonate absorption ( Jt CO2) observed in the medullary collecting duct during chronic hypokalemia is inhibited by Sch-28080 in low concentration (10 μm). Sensitivity to low concentrations of Sch-28080 is characteristic of the gastric H+,K+-ATPase (13Wallmark B. Briving C. Fryklund J. Munson K. Jackson R. Mendlein J. Rabon E. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2077-2084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it has been suggested that in the inner medullary collecting tubule HKα2 may become sensitive to low concentrations of Sch-28080 during chronic hypokalemia (12Nakamura S. Wang Z. Galla J.H. Soleimani M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F687-F692PubMed Google Scholar). Cougnon et al. (14Cougnon M. Bouyer P. Planelles G. Jaisser F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6516-6520Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) demonstrated that HKα2 can also function to secrete Na+ in exchange for K+. These findings were supported by studies from Grishin and Caplan (15Grishin A.V. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27772-27778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which demonstrated that HEK-293 cells co-transfected with human ATP1AL1 (90% similar to HKα2) and the rabbit β-subunit of the gastric H+,K+-ATPase, grow in the presence of ouabain. This observation suggests that in transfected cells, during inhibition of the native Na+ pump by ouabain, ATP1AL1 which is relatively insensitive to ouabain (16Modyanov N.N. Mathews P.M. Grishin A.V.

Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F539-F551PubMed Google Scholar), functions as a Na+ pump. A possible physiological role for the rat HKα2 or the human ATP1AL1, as apical Na+pumps, is difficult to envision. Moreover, that these findings were obtained using heterologous expression systems, raises concern regarding the possibility that a similar function might not exist in native membranes. High levels of expression of HKα2 have been reported in apical membranes from rat distal colon (10Codina J. Delmas-Mata J.T. DuBose Jr., T.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F433-F440PubMed Google Scholar) where the protein has also been identified by immunolocalization (9Sangan P. Rajendran V.M. Mann A.S. Kashgarian M. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C685-C696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taking advantage of this observation, we prepared apical membranes from rat distal colon to determine: (a) if under physiological conditions HKα2 is sensitive to low concentrations of Sch-28080, and (b) if HKα2 function, here defined as K+-ATPase enzymatic activity, is Na+-dependent or Na+- independent. Our results demonstrate that these membranes contain both Na+-dependent and Na+-independent ATPase activities. Using an inhibitory antibody specific for HKα2, we demonstrate that this pump is responsible for Na+-dependent activity. This finding indicates that the colonic H+,K+-ATPase, which has been shown to function as a proton pump, may also function as a sodium pump under certain physiological conditions. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that both Na+-dependent and Na+-independent activities can substitute readily NH4+ for K+. To prepare plasma membranes (18Pohl S.L. Krans H.M. Kozyreff V.

The particulate matter was removed by centrifugation for 2 min at 200 × g. To the supernatant, 1 mMgSO4 was added to a final concentration of 10 mm MgSO4. The sample was placed on ice for 15 min and was shaken intermittently. The aggregated material was removed by centrifugation for 12 min at 2500 × g at 4 °C, and apical membranes from the supernatant were collected by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of buffer B containing 10 mm MgSO4, and homogenized with pestle B of a Dounce homogenizer. After removal of the aggregated material at 3100 × g for 12 min at 4 °C, membranes were collected by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C.

Distal colon was homogenized with a Polytron in 3 volumes of iced 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, as described previously in our laboratory (22Diaz-Diaz F.D. LaBelle E.F. Eaton D.C. DuBose Jr., T.D. Am.

The samples were vortexed, cooled in ice, centrifuged, and the supernatant (450 μl) was used to quantify the 32P released during the incubation. Serum (15 μl) containing the anti-HKα2 antibody was mixed with the immunizing peptide (10 μl) (1.5 mm) to inactivate the antibody (19Codina J. Delmas Mata J.T. DuBose Jr., T.D. J. Biol.

After incubation, distal colon apical membranes (100–200 μg) were added to the mixture and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with occasional vortexing. The membranes were diluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, to a final concentration of 0.5–1.5 μg of protein/μl and 20 μl of the diluted membranes were used in the ATPase assays. H2O (10 μl) was mixed with serum (15 μl) containing the anti-HKα2 antibody. After 1 h incubation at 4 °C, rat distal colon apical membranes (100–200 μg) were added and incubated for 1 additional hour at 4 °C. The membranes were then diluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, to a final concentration of 0.5–1.5 μg of protein/μl. Finally, immunizing peptide (10 μl) was added. A graphic representation of this assay is shown in the top panel of Fig. 5. A volume of 20 μl of diluted membranes was used in the ATPase assays. The characterization of the antibody against HKα2has been described recently by our laboratory (10Codina J. Delmas-Mata J.T. DuBose Jr., T.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F433-F440PubMed Google Scholar, 19Codina J. Delmas Mata J.T. DuBose Jr., T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7894-7899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Immunoblots were performed as reported previously by our laboratory (10Codina J. Delmas-Mata J.T. DuBose Jr., T.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F433-F440PubMed Google Scholar, 19Codina J. Delmas Mata J.T. DuBose Jr., T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7894-7899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Harlan Sprague-Dawley male rats (150–200 g) were used in all experiments. Ouabain was purchased from Sigma. Sch-28080 was a gift from Dr. Kaminski at Schering-Plow Research Institute. The anti-NASE and anti-LEAVE antibodies were characterized previously (23Pressley T.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C743-C751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid alignment between different α-subunits was performed with the “Bestfit” program of the Genetics Computer Group (Madison, WI). As displayed in Fig.1, plasma (method I), apical (method II), and vesicle (method III) membranes (20 μg/each) were applied to a 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with the anti-HKα2 antibody (dilution 1:1000). As expected (10Codina J. Delmas-Mata J.T. DuBose Jr., T.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F433-F440PubMed Google Scholar), of the three methods to prepare membranes the apical membrane method yielded membranes which were most enriched in HKα2 protein. In heterologous expression systems, the activity of rat HKα2 has been reported to be K+-dependent (IC50 < 1 mm), Sch-28080 insensitive, and only partially sensitive to ouabain (IC50 ∼ 400–600 μm) (3Cougnon M. Planelles G. Crowson M.S. Shull G.E. Rossier B.C. Jaisser F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7277-7280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 4Codina J. Kone B.C. Delmas Mata J.T. DuBose Jr., T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29759-29763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To test which of the different K+-ATPases observed in apical membranes of distal colon best fits this pharmacological profile, we measured Na+-dependent and Na+-independent K+-ATPase activity in preparations of rat distal colon apical membranes in the presence of KCl (10 mm). The data displayed in Fig.2 (left panel) demonstrate that the predominant K+-ATPase in distal colon apical membranes was Na+-dependent and was abolished by ouabain (2 mm), but was insensitive to Sch-28080 (100 μm). This same figure also demonstrates that distal colon apical membranes contain a Na+-independent K+-ATPase. The Na+-independent K+-ATPase represents only 20% of the total Na+-dependent K+-ATPase activity (at 10 mm KCl), and is insensitive to both ouabain (2 mm) and Sch-28080 (100 μm). Treatment of the membrane preparations with CHAPS or Triton X-100 did not alter the response to Sch-28080 or ouabain for either Na+-dependent or Na+-independent K+-ATPase fractions. Since Sch-28080 did not inhibit either K+-ATPase activity in apical membranes from distal colon, we tested if the Na+-independent K+-ATPase (“H+,K+-ATPase”) in apical membranes of rat stomach which are enriched in HKα1 is sensitive to Sch-28080. The right panel of Fig. 2 demonstrates that concentrations of Sch-28080 as low as 10 μm inhibit 80–90% of the Na+-independent K+-ATPase activity in the presence of K+ (5 mm). Based on the observation that many transporters of K+, including the α1-Na+,K+-ATPase, can transport either K+ or NH4+ with similar affinity (24Skou J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 42: 6-23Crossref Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 25Dantzig A.H. Minor P.L. Garrigus J.L. Fukuda D.S. Mynderse J.S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 2019-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 26Wall S.M. Koger L.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F660-F670PubMed Google Scholar), we characterized the ion dependence of the K+-ATPases present in our preparation of distal colon apical membranes. In Fig.3 (left panel) apical membranes were incubated in the presence of NaCl (20 mm) and with increasing concentrations of KCl (closed diamonds) or NH4Cl (closed squares). Na+-dependent K+-ATPase activity increased with increasing concentrations of K+ and reached saturation at concentrations near 5 mm. Substitution of K+ by NH4 also induced an increase in Na+-dependent NH4+-ATPase in a concentration-dependent manner. The Vm for K+ and NH4+ are similar. However, the enzyme had a higher affinity for K+(IC50 ∼ 0.2 mm) than for NH4+ (IC50 ∼ 2 mm). The affinity for Na+ was identical (IC50 ∼ 5 mm) whether K+ or NH4+ was used in the ATPase assay (Fig.3, middle panel). Finally we determined if K+can be replaced by NH4+ in the Na+-independent K+-ATPase fraction. The results of a representative experiment are displayed in Fig. 3 (right panel). The Na+-independent K+-ATPase activity displayed a low affinity for K+ (activity was not detectable until [K+] was >2.5 mm, IC50 > 10 mm, and did not reach saturation until 40 mm [K+]). Similar results were obtained when K+ was replaced by NH4+. The activity of Na+-dependent K+-ATPase in apical membranes was inhibited by high concentrations of ouabain (IC50 ∼ 200–300 μm). Replacement of K+ by NH4+ did not alter this inhibitory profile (Fig. 4). Furthermore, Sch-28080 did not inhibit K+-ATPase activity when K+ was replaced by NH4+ (data not shown). The studies shown above (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4) demonstrate that apical membranes, which are enriched in HKα2 protein, display pharmacological properties which are virtually indistinguishable from α1-Na+,K+-ATPase (27Garvin J.L. Burg M.B. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: F785-F788PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kurtz I. Balaban R.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: F497-F502PubMed Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that we were studying α1-Na+,K+-ATPase activity (which are contaminating the membranes preparation) rather than the activity of HKα2, we took advantage of two observations made by our laboratory: (a) our anti-HKα2 antibody can immunoprecipitate the HKα2/β1-Na+,K+-ATPase complex in both the renal medulla and distal colon (19Codina J. Delmas Mata J.T. DuBose Jr., T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7894-7899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and, (b) this same anti-HKα2 antibody does not cross-react or immunoprecipitate α1-Na+-K+-ATPase or any other X+,K+-ATPase characterized thus far (19Codina J. Delmas Mata J.T. DuBose Jr., T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7894-7899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We asked whether the anti-HKα2 antibody could block Na+-dependent K+-ATPase activity. To answer this question, the anti-HKα2 antibody (15 μl) was incubated in the presence (group A) or absence of immunizing peptide (500 μm) (group B) for 1 h at 4 °C (10Codina J. Delmas-Mata J.T. DuBose Jr., T.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F433-F440PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation was followed by addition of membranes (100 μg) to each group. The mixture was then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Membranes were diluted to 0.5 μg/μl in the presence of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In group B the immunizing peptide was added after dilution of the membranes. This approach was taken to correct for possible interference of the peptide with the ATPase assay. A schematic representation of this protocol is displayed in Fig. 5 (top panel). Fig. 5 (middle panel), demonstrates that incubation of apical membranes with the anti-HKα2antibody markedly decreased Na+-dependent K+-ATPase activity (closed bar). A similar experiment was performed by substituting K+ for NH4+ (Fig. 5, lower panel). Similar Na+-dependent K+(NH4+)-ATPase activity was observed in the presence of either K+ or NH4+ (5 mm) under control conditions. Na+-dependent NH4+-ATPase activity was blocked by the anti-HKα2 antibody, exactly as observed in the presence of K+. As a control we repeated the experiment described in Fig. 5, but with plasma membranes isolated from rat renal cortex. These membranes, in contrast to distal colon membranes, are depleted of HKα2 but are enriched in α1-Na+,K+-ATPase. The result of such an experiment is displayed in Fig.6. This finding demonstrates that Na+,K+-ATPase activity in the renal cortex is not inhibited by the anti-HKα2 antibody. Thus, the anti-HKα2 antibody does not cross-react with a membrane fraction enriched in α1-Na+,K+-ATPase. To confirm further that HKα2 functions as a Na+-dependent K+-ATPase in apical membranes of distal colon origin we performed an additional experiment described in Fig. 7. In this study Na+-dependent K+-ATPase activity was measured in plasma membranes from renal cortex as well as apical membranes from distal colon. We reasoned that if the HKα2functions in distal colon as a Na+-dependent K+-ATPase, more α1-subunit from the renal cortex would be required to reach the same level of Na+-dependent K+-ATPase activity present in the distal colon apical membranes. Fig. 7 (left panel) demonstrates that both membrane fractions contain similar specific activities (expressed as nanomole of ATP hydrolyzed/hour) at any given concentration of total protein. However, the absolute level of α1-Na+,K+-ATPase was much greater in renal cortex compared with distal colon (right panel of Fig. 7). This study was performed with two different antibodies, anti-NASE which recognizes only α1-Na+,K+-ATPase and anti-LEAVE which should recognize α1-, α2-, and α3-Na+,K+-ATPase (23Pressley T.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C743-C751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that the immunoblots for both the distal colon and renal cortex membranes using either the anti-NASE and anti-LEAVE antibodies were indistinguishable, demonstrates that neither α2- nor α3-Na+,K+-ATPase accounts for the Na+-independent K+-ATPase activity in distal colon apical membranes. These findings provide additional evidence that the distal colon apical membrane fraction is enriched in HKα2 protein and functions as a Na+-dependent K+-ATPase which is distinct from α1-Na+,K+-ATPase activity. Our studies demonstrate that plasma membranes from distal colon, which are enriched severalfold in HKα2 protein, contain a K+-ATPase activity which is Na+-dependent, Sch 28080-insensitive, and partially ouabain-sensitive. To conclude that this activity represents functionally the α-subunit of the colonic H+,K+-ATPase, is contingent on the specificity of our anti-HKα2 antibody. Previous studies by our laboratory have demonstrated that the antibody used in the present study does not cross-react with any of the known X+,K+-ATPases (10Codina J. Delmas-Mata J.T. DuBose Jr., T.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F433-F440PubMed Google Scholar, 19Codina J. Delmas Mata J.T. DuBose Jr., T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7894-7899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, alternative explanations for this activity which were evaluated in the course of this study include all known members of the X+,K+-ATPase superfamily. The antibody used in these studies was raised against a synthetic peptide designed after the rat colonic H+,K+-ATPase the epitope of which (amino acids 686–698) is not found on any other known rat X+,K+-ATPases. Furthermore, there is no evidence that another H+,K+-ATPase or Na+,K+-ATPase, except HKα2 or α1-Na+,K+-ATPase, exists in distal colon (Fig. 7). Moreover, in this, and in a previous study (10Codina J. Delmas-Mata J.T. DuBose Jr., T.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F433-F440PubMed Google Scholar,19Codina J. Delmas Mata J.T. DuBose Jr., T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7894-7899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated that this antibody does not cross-react or immunoprecipitate other known X+,K+-ATPases, including the α1-Na+,K+-ATPase. In addition, we now demonstrate that our anti-HKα2antibody blocks Na+-dependent K+-ATPase activity (Fig. 5), that Na+,K+-ATPase activity in the renal cortex is not inhibited by the specific blocking antibody (Fig. 6), and finally that neither α2 nor α3-Na+,K+-ATPase could account for the activity in the distal colon apical membrane fraction (Fig. 7). Therefore, we conclude that HKα2 can function in distal colon as a Na+-dependent K+-ATPase. Precedent exists for Na+ secretion by the HKα2. Cougnon et al. (14Cougnon M. Bouyer P. Planelles G. Jaisser F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6516-6520Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) has demonstrated recently that HKα2 can secrete Na+ in exchange for K+ in X. laevis oocytes. In this study it was reported that Na+/K+ exchange, which was sensitive to high concentrations of ouabain, and was totally insensitive to Sch-28080, was dependent on co-expression with a β-subunit. Moreover, Kone and Higham (29Kone B.C. Higham S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2543-2552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) reported recently that a splice variant of HKα2 (HKα2b), which is truncated by the initial 103 amino acids, supported the growth of HEK-293 cells in the presence of low concentrations of ouabain. In addition, Grishin et al. (17Grishin A.V. Bevensee M.O. Modyanov N.N. Rajendran V. Boron W.F. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F539-F551PubMed Google Scholar), expressed the human ATP1AL1 (90% similar to HKα2) in HEK-293 cells, and observed that the ratio of H+-secretion to K+-uptake was approximately 1:10. Based on these observations he postulated that ATP1AL1 did not function solely as a H+/K+exchanger. This group also reported that ATP1AL1 supported the growth of HEK-293 cells in the presence of ouabain (15Grishin A.V. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27772-27778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Since HEK-293 cells transfected with ATP1AL1 or HKα2b grow in the presence of ouabain (15Grishin A.V. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27772-27778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 29Kone B.C. Higham S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2543-2552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), it is logical to speculate that both the rat HKα2 and the human ATP1AL1 may function as Na+ pumps. However, since these results were obtained in heterologous expression systems, questions could be raised regarding the relevance of these results to native colonic apical membranes. It is appreciated generally that Na+,K+-ATPases are localized to basolateral membranes (30Mays R.W. Siemers K.A. Fritz B.A. Lowe A.W. van Meer G. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In the present study, and from previous studies by our laboratory (10Codina J. Delmas-Mata J.T. DuBose Jr., T.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F433-F440PubMed Google Scholar) it has been demonstrated that HKα2 is enriched in apical membrane fractions from distal colon. Sangan et al. (8Kraut J.A. Hiura J. Besancon M. Smolka A. Sachs G. Scott D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F744-F750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have also demonstrated that HKα2 protein localizes to the apical membrane of colonocytes. Moreover, Jaisser et al. (31Jaisser F. Escoubet B. Coutry N. Eugene E. Bonvalet J.P. Farman N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C679-C687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated by in situ hybridization that HKα2 mRNA localizes to surface epithelial cells of rat distal colon. Assigning a physiological role for a Na+-dependent K+-ATPase located in the apical membrane of colonocytes is difficult, however. Del Castillo et al. (32Del Castillo R.J. Rajendran V.M. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: G1005-G1011PubMed Google Scholar) reported that two types of Na+-independent K+-ATPases are present in apical membranes from distal colon: one which is sensitive to ouabain (1 mm), and another which is insensitive to ouabain (1 mm). These K+-ATPases were not present in basolateral membranes. The effect of Sch-28080 (a standard inhibitor of the gastric H+,K+-ATPase) was not tested. Leeet al. (33Lee J. Rajendran V.M. Mann A.S. Kashgarian M. Binder H.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2002-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) reported that in preparations of “apical” membranes from distal colon, both activities (ouabain-insensitive and ouabain-sensitive K+-ATPases) were inhibited by an antibody directed against the amino-terminal of HKα2. Recently, Rajendran et al. (34Rajendran V.M. Singh S.K. Geibel J. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G424-G429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that Na+-independent, K+-dependent pHi recovery by rat colonocytes was ouabain-insensitive (up to 1 mm). Based on this observation, it was concluded that HKα2 functions in colonocytes as a Na+-independent, ouabain-insensitive K+-ATPase. In agreement with these findings, both Na+-dependent and Na+-independent K+-ATPases were detected in the present study, the Na+-dependent fraction, which predominated under the conditions of the assay, was relatively ouabain-sensitive. In contrast, the less abundant Na+-independent fraction was ouabain-insensitive. Based on the present study it is reasonable to conclude that HKα2 may function in native apical membranes not only as a proton pump, but as a Na+ pump. Nevertheless, the physiological conditions which might serve to regulate Na+/K+ as opposed to H+/K+ exchange have not been defined. Therefore, future studies will be needed to define the relative contributions of these pumps in the distal colon as well as factors which regulate their abundance and function in physiologic and pathophysiologic conditions. An additional finding in the present study was that the K+-ATPase activity in distal colon membranes also had high affinity for NH4+ (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). Transport of NH4+ by the colonic H+,K+-ATPase in kidney has been suggested in preliminary studies previously (35Amlal H. Nakamura S. Galla J.H. Soleimani A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 2AGoogle Scholar, 36Cougnon M. Jaisser F. Edelman A. Anagnostopoulos T. Planelles G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 4AGoogle Scholar). Our findings are the first to suggest that substitution of K+ by NH4+ may occur in distal colon apical membranes. Nevertheless, the physiological role of H+/NH4+ exchange by the colonic H+,K+-ATPase in either kidney or distal colon has not yet been defined clearly."

In this report, the promoter of the Giardia ran gene was studied using a luciferase expression plasmid pRANluc+ to monitor transcription efficiency. An AT-rich sequence spanning −51/−20 relative to the translation start site of the rangene was identified and was found to be required for efficient luciferase expression by deletion and mutation mapping of pRANluc+. The −51/−20 sequence was also sufficient for promoter activity as revealed from studies on a 32-base pair synthetic promoter derived from this region. Deletion mapping of the synthetic promoter revealed two minimal promoter elements, −51/−42 and −30/−20, sufficient for 6- and 30-fold luciferase expression above background, respectively. The transcription start sites onluc+ messenger RNA were determined by the position of the synthetic promoter in the luciferase expression plasmids as shown by primer extension experiments. Results from electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed multiple DNA-protein complexes upon binding of nuclear proteins with either DNA strand but not the double-stranded DNA derived from the ran promoter.

The parasite adapts to drastic changes in host and outside environments by differentiating between actively dividing trophozoites and dormant cysts in response to extracellular stimuli (3Gillin F.D.

Giardiasis usually manifests as self-limiting diarrhea; however, it can also lead to malabsorption and even death in children. Trophozoites differentiate into cysts in the lower intestine and are excreted to the environment.G. lamblia exhibits both prokaryotic and eukaryotic features (1Adam R.D. Microbiol.

BioEssays. 1998; 20: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It is very interesting to study how the organism regulates its gene expression efficiently. Although intron sequences have not been reported in Giardia genes to date (5Smith M.W. Aley S.B. Sogin M. Gillin F.D. Evans G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 95: 267-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), a number of genes that code for putative components of the spliceosomal machinery have been found. The short 5′- untranslated sequence (as short as 1 nt) and the absence of 5′-cap structure of bulk Giardia messenger RNA raise the possibility that G. lamblia may exploit distinct mechanisms for translation initiation different from common strategies used by other eukaryotes (1Adam R.D.

DNA transfection studies have shown that a 0.8-kilobase pair DNA sequence flanking 5′ of the glutamate dehydrogenase gene (gdh) in G. lambliais necessary and sufficient for promoter activity (11Yee J.

However, DNA homology searches in this and other Giardia protein-coding genes so far examined have not revealed consensus core promoter elements used in either prokaryotes or higher eukaryotes. Instead, a number of AT-rich sequences close to or spanning the transcription initiation sites were identified by sequence alignments and suggested to be Giardia promoter elements (19Hilario E. Gogarten J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 128: 94-98Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 20Holberton D.V. Marshall J.

These postulations remain to be confirmed experimentally.Our previous efforts in the development of an episomal stable DNA transfection system for G. lamblia utilized the promoter-containing sequence within −590 and +27 of aras-related nuclear protein gene (ran) (13Sun C.H. Chou C.F. Tai J.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 92: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the present study, we further dissected the ran promoter by using DNA transfection systems to monitor transcription efficiency and start-site selection of the reporter genes in vivo. We also used electrophoretic mobility shift assay to identify potential transcription factor(s) in vitro. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first promoter sequence to be demonstrated experimentally in G. lamblia. This information will have comparative value when other promoter sequences are identified and will also provide a framework for future studies regarding the transcription regulation of G. lamblia.DISCUSSIONIn this report, luciferase activity in transfected G. lamblia trophozoites was used to monitor transcription efficiency of modified ran promoter contexts. The levels ofluc+ transcripts from transient transfections were below the detection limit of the primer extension method (data not shown); however, the levels of luciferase expression correlated well with the degrees of mutations or deletions within the 32-bp AT-richran promoter sequence (Figs. 3 and 5). The luciferase activities in stable expressing cell lines also correlated well with the results of primer extension experiments (Fig. 6), demonstrating that alteration in luciferase activity indeed reflects the transcription efficiency of various ran promoter contexts.A typical eukaryotic promoter site that is composed of one or more core promoter element(s) proximal to the transcription start site and additional DNA regulatory elements in the distal region usually spans a few hundred bp (25Wasylyk B. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 23: 77-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 26White R.J. Jackson S.P. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 284-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A typical promoter site in Escherichia coli that is composed of two core promoter elements and adjacent upstream activator binding sites usually spans ∼70 bp (25Wasylyk B. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 23: 77-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Estrem S.T. Gaal T. Ross W. Gourse R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9761-9766Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). By contrast, the ran promoter in G. lambliaapparently comprises a single AT-rich domain spanning the −51/−20 sequence of the ran gene as supported by several lines of evidence. First, progressive deletions from −590 down to −51 of theran gene neither enhanced nor suppressed luciferase expression (Fig. 2), implying the absence of any promoter element other than −51/−20 in the 5′- untranslated region of the rangene. Second, luciferase expression was eliminated after the entire −51/−20 sequence was deleted (Fig. 2) or mutated (Fig. 3). Smaller mutations or deletions within the −51/−20 sequence only led to reduced gene expression. The downstream sequence −19/−1, which was needed for optimal luciferase expression, was insufficient to confer significant promoter activity. Third, a 32-bp synthetic promoter spanning the −51/−20 region was necessary and sufficient to direct the expression of a downstream reporter gene (Fig. 4). The presence of an intragenic core promoter element in the ran promoter is unlikely, since the protein coding sequence of the ran gene is not required for luciferase expression in the synthetic promoter system (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). It is also important to note that the 32-bp AT-rich sequence also conferred weaker promoter activity when positioned in reverse orientation (Fig. 4). Preliminary data reveal that the ran promoter has the potential to regulate transcription of an upstream gene positioned in reverse orientation relative to the ran gene. 2C.-H. Sun and J.-H. Tai, unpublished observations. These observations indicate that the ran promoter in G. lamblia exhibits an unusual simple organization distinct from other common eukaryotic and prokaryotic promoters. Determination of whether such a promoter organization is common in G. lambliaawaits identification of more promoters in this organism.The sequence of the ran promoter is extremely AT-rich (29 out of 32 bp) and contains five short A-tracts (3–4 A residues in a run) intervened by one or two T residues and a short T tract (three T residues in a run) flanked by two A residues at the 3′-end. Results from scanning mutagenesis and deletion mapping studies show that the multiplicity of the A-tract sequence in a modified ranpromoter correlates with transcription efficiency (Figs. 3 and 5). Also, mutations of the T-tract sequence in pRANluc+ resulted in a 4-fold reduction in luciferase expression (Fig. 3). AT-rich sequences containing two A-tracts (such as −51/−41; TAAAA TAAAT) or an A-tract plus a T-tract (such as −30/−20; TAAAA CTTTAA) constitute a minimal promoter in G. lamblia (Fig. 5). These observations suggest that the A-tract and T-tract sequences are two important elements of the ran promoter. Although the exact sequence requirements for these elements have not been determined by point mutations, it is interesting to note the presence of A-tract- or T-tract-like sequences spanning the transcription start sites of many genes in G. lamblia (Fig. 8). In conjunction with a T-tract sequence-specific ssDNA-binding protein discussed below, these observations suggest that the AT-rich sequence spanning the transcription start sites described above is most likely one of the core promoter elements in G. lamblia.The interactions among core promoter elements and associated transcription factors are primary determinants of start site selection in transcription initiation (28Verrijzer C.P. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 338-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 29Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In G. lamblia, we found that transcription start sites selected were also determined by the 32-bp AT-rich sequence (Fig. 6 B). Although some of these sites deviated from authentic ran messenger RNA start sites, they varied within a rather small range (Fig. 6 C). Multiple start sites were consistently observed from primer extensions performed on ran messenger RNA. By contrast, only the distal start site was detected on neo messenger RNA (Fig. 6 B,lanes 1 and 2). Interestingly, the consensus site resides within the AT-rich sequence of theran promoter. This discrepancy may reflect differences in chromosomal (ran) and episomal (neo) environments in regulating gene expression or may be due to the involvement of certain DNA sequences downstream of the transcription start site (30Ince T.A. Scotto K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30249-30252Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In the present study, the distal start site was still present on various luc+ messenger RNAs but with a much reduced intensity. Instead, a new preferable start site at 8 nt downstream of the distal start site appeared regardless of the positions of the synthetic promoter. These observations suggests that the AT-rich sequence is the primary determinant for start site selection. It is important to note that the two consensus start sites described above are all located within the 3′-minimal promoter element. As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, the minimal promoter element can be separated from its 5′-sequence in the ran promoter without seriously hampering the transcription efficiency or start site selection. This sequence may be a functional analogue of eukaryotic initiators (29Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).A key regulatory event in eukaryotic transcription initiation is the recognition of distinct dsDNA promoter sites by specific multimeric protein complexes (28Verrijzer C.P. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 338-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 29Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In DNA-protein binding assays, we detected DNA-protein complexes on each of the DNA strands but not on the dsDNA fragment derived from the ran promoter (Fig. 7). Binding of a putative transcription factor to the dsDNA may have been unstable under our tested conditions, or such a factor was unstable in our nuclear extract preparations. Due to the lack of known dsDNA-binding protein in G. lamblia, we could not include a positive control in our experiments. In another pathogenic protozoan,Trypanosoma brucei, ssDNA-binding protein interacting with single-stranded promoter elements rather than double-stranded promoter elements was also observed (31Brown S.D. Van der Ploeg L.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 109-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 32Vanhamme L. Pays A. Tebabi P. Alexandre S. Pays E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5598-5606Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The interactions of DNA-binding proteins to single-stranded promoter elements that influence transcription efficiency have been observed in other eukaryotic promoters (33Bemark M. Olsson H. Heinegard D. Leanderson T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18881-18890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 34Tomonaga T. Levens D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3527-3533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Whether ssDNA-binding protein(s) identified here also plays a role in regulating transcription initiation in G. lamblia is not clear from current studies. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that a consensus T-tract sequence was present in all ssDNAs that exhibited protein-binding property (Table I), indicating that the T tract sequence may participate in protein binding on single-stranded ran promoter elements. Our results from DNA-protein competition assays also show that residual DNA-protein complexes were still present on long ssDNA fragments (−51/−20 or −20/−51) even with a 200–1,000-fold molar excess of the short DNA fragments or T8 (Fig. 7, B and C; also data not shown), indicating that the long DNA fragments exhibit higher affinities for binding nuclear proteins than short DNA fragments or that the long fragments may provide extra protein-binding sites for additional nuclear factors. These characteristics may be responsible for enhanced transcription efficiency beyond that which can be achieved by minimal promoters. Since transcription efficiency of pm(−25/−20), which lacks the putative protein binding site on the non-template strand DNA (Fig. 3), was only reduced by 4-fold, it is tempting to speculate that binding of the putative transcription factor to the template strand DNA may be related to the recruitment of a putative transcription complex to the site of transcription initiation, and an additional protein binding site on the non-template strand DNA may stabilize this complex. These possibilities remain to be investigated in the future.In summary, our studies on the ran promoter provide a model system for future investigation on the transcription machinery inG. lamblia, one of the earliest diverging eukaryotic single cells. As a very common intestinal parasite of humans and one of the earliest diverging eukaryotic cells, Giardia lamblia is an important pathogen for biological studies (1Adam R.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 706-732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Upcroft J. Upcroft P. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The parasite adapts to drastic changes in host and outside environments by differentiating between actively dividing trophozoites and dormant cysts in response to extracellular stimuli (3Gillin F.D. Reiner D.S. McCaffery J.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 679-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 4Lujan H.D. Mowatt M.R. Nash T.E. Microb. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 294-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Trophozoites emerge from cysts in the upper intestine and proliferate to cause gastrointestinal disease. Giardiasis usually manifests as self-limiting diarrhea; however, it can also lead to malabsorption and even death in children. Trophozoites differentiate into cysts in the lower intestine and are excreted to the environment. G. lamblia exhibits both prokaryotic and eukaryotic features (1Adam R.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 706-732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Upcroft J. Upcroft P. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Its genome is small and compact (genome size of ∼1.2×107 bp)1(1Adam R.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 706-732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Upcroft J. Upcroft P. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It is very interesting to study how the organism regulates its gene expression efficiently. Although intron sequences have not been reported in Giardia genes to date (5Smith M.W. Aley S.B. Sogin M. Gillin F.D. Evans G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 95: 267-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), a number of genes that code for putative components of the spliceosomal machinery have been found. The short 5′- untranslated sequence (as short as 1 nt) and the absence of 5′-cap structure of bulk Giardia messenger RNA raise the possibility that G. lamblia may exploit distinct mechanisms for translation initiation different from common strategies used by other eukaryotes (1Adam R.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 706-732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Yu D.C. Wang A.L. Botka C.W. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem.

Recent developments using gene transfer technologies and on-going genome sequencing projects involving this organism will provide us additional opportunities to study the molecular and cellular mechanisms operating in this protozoan parasite (9Yu D.C.

Studies on gene expression during encystation and excystation of G. lamblia in vitro have shown that trophozoites, as well as cysts, produce new transcripts in response to extracellular stimuli (14Lujan H.D.

These characteristics may be responsible for enhanced transcription efficiency beyond that which can be achieved by minimal promoters. Since transcription efficiency of pm(−25/−20), which lacks the putative protein binding site on the non-template strand DNA (Fig. 3), was only reduced by 4-fold, it is tempting to speculate that binding of the putative transcription factor to the template strand DNA may be related to the recruitment of a putative transcription complex to the site of transcription initiation, and an additional protein binding site on the non-template strand DNA may stabilize this complex. These possibilities remain to be investigated in the future.In summary, our studies on the ran promoter provide a model system for future investigation on the transcription machinery inG. lamblia, one of the earliest diverging eukaryotic single cells. In this report, luciferase activity in transfected G. lamblia trophozoites was used to monitor transcription efficiency of modified ran promoter contexts. The levels ofluc+ transcripts from transient transfections were below the detection limit of the primer extension method (data not shown); however, the levels of luciferase expression correlated well with the degrees of mutations or deletions within the 32-bp AT-richran promoter sequence (Figs. 3 and 5). The luciferase activities in stable expressing cell lines also correlated well with the results of primer extension experiments (Fig. 6), demonstrating that alteration in luciferase activity indeed reflects the transcription efficiency of various ran promoter contexts. A typical eukaryotic promoter site that is composed of one or more core promoter element(s) proximal to the transcription start site and additional DNA regulatory elements in the distal region usually spans a few hundred bp (25Wasylyk B. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 23: 77-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 26White R.J. Jackson S.P. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 284-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A typical promoter site in Escherichia coli that is composed of two core promoter elements and adjacent upstream activator binding sites usually spans ∼70 bp (25Wasylyk B. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 23: 77-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Estrem S.T. Gaal T. Ross W. Gourse R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9761-9766Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). By contrast, the ran promoter in G. lambliaapparently comprises a single AT-rich domain spanning the −51/−20 sequence of the ran gene as supported by several lines of evidence. First, progressive deletions from −590 down to −51 of theran gene neither enhanced nor suppressed luciferase expression (Fig. 2), implying the absence of any promoter element other than −51/−20 in the 5′- untranslated region of the rangene. Second, luciferase expression was eliminated after the entire −51/−20 sequence was deleted (Fig. 2) or mutated (Fig. 3). Smaller mutations or deletions within the −51/−20 sequence only led to reduced gene expression. The downstream sequence −19/−1, which was needed for optimal luciferase expression, was insufficient to confer significant promoter activity. Third, a 32-bp synthetic promoter spanning the −51/−20 region was necessary and sufficient to direct the expression of a downstream reporter gene (Fig. 4). The presence of an intragenic core promoter element in the ran promoter is unlikely, since the protein coding sequence of the ran gene is not required for luciferase expression in the synthetic promoter system (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). It is also important to note that the 32-bp AT-rich sequence also conferred weaker promoter activity when positioned in reverse orientation (Fig. 4). Preliminary data reveal that the ran promoter has the potential to regulate transcription of an upstream gene positioned in reverse orientation relative to the ran gene. 2C.-H. Sun and J.-H. Tai, unpublished observations. These observations indicate that the ran promoter in G. lamblia exhibits an unusual simple organization distinct from other common eukaryotic and prokaryotic promoters. Determination of whether such a promoter organization is common in G. lambliaawaits identification of more promoters in this organism. The sequence of the ran promoter is extremely AT-rich (29 out of 32 bp) and contains five short A-tracts (3–4 A residues in a run) intervened by one or two T residues and a short T tract (three T residues in a run) flanked by two A residues at the 3′-end. Results from scanning mutagenesis and deletion mapping studies show that the multiplicity of the A-tract sequence in a modified ranpromoter correlates with transcription efficiency (Figs. 3 and 5). Also, mutations of the T-tract sequence in pRANluc+ resulted in a 4-fold reduction in luciferase expression (Fig. 3). AT-rich sequences containing two A-tracts (such as −51/−41; TAAAA TAAAT) or an A-tract plus a T-tract (such as −30/−20; TAAAA CTTTAA) constitute a minimal promoter in G. lamblia (Fig. 5). These observations suggest that the A-tract and T-tract sequences are two important elements of the ran promoter. Although the exact sequence requirements for these elements have not been determined by point mutations, it is interesting to note the presence of A-tract- or T-tract-like sequences spanning the transcription start sites of many genes in G. lamblia (Fig. 8). In conjunction with a T-tract sequence-specific ssDNA-binding protein discussed below, these observations suggest that the AT-rich sequence spanning the transcription start sites described above is most likely one of the core promoter elements in G. lamblia. The interactions among core promoter elements and associated transcription factors are primary determinants of start site selection in transcription initiation (28Verrijzer C.P. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 338-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 29Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In G. lamblia, we found that transcription start sites selected were also determined by the 32-bp AT-rich sequence (Fig. 6 B). Although some of these sites deviated from authentic ran messenger RNA start sites, they varied within a rather small range (Fig. 6 C). Multiple start sites were consistently observed from primer extensions performed on ran messenger RNA. By contrast, only the distal start site was detected on neo messenger RNA (Fig. 6 B,lanes 1 and 2). Interestingly, the consensus site resides within the AT-rich sequence of theran promoter. This discrepancy may reflect differences in chromosomal (ran) and episomal (neo) environments in regulating gene expression or may be due to the involvement of certain DNA sequences downstream of the transcription start site (30Ince T.A. Scotto K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30249-30252Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In the present study, the distal start site was still present on various luc+ messenger RNAs but with a much reduced intensity. Instead, a new preferable start site at 8 nt downstream of the distal start site appeared regardless of the positions of the synthetic promoter. These observations suggests that the AT-rich sequence is the primary determinant for start site selection. It is important to note that the two consensus start sites described above are all located within the 3′-minimal promoter element. As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, the minimal promoter element can be separated from its 5′-sequence in the ran promoter without seriously hampering the transcription efficiency or start site selection. This sequence may be a functional analogue of eukaryotic initiators (29Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A key regulatory event in eukaryotic transcription initiation is the recognition of distinct dsDNA promoter sites by specific multimeric protein complexes (28Verrijzer C.P. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 338-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 29Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In DNA-protein binding assays, we detected DNA-protein complexes on each of the DNA strands but not on the dsDNA fragment derived from the ran promoter (Fig. 7). Binding of a putative transcription factor to the dsDNA may have been unstable under our tested conditions, or such a factor was unstable in our nuclear extract preparations. Due to the lack of known dsDNA-binding protein in G. lamblia, we could not include a positive control in our experiments. In another pathogenic protozoan,Trypanosoma brucei, ssDNA-binding protein interacting with single-stranded promoter elements rather than double-stranded promoter elements was also observed (31Brown S.D. Van der Ploeg L.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 109-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 32Vanhamme L. Pays A. Tebabi P. Alexandre S. Pays E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5598-5606Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The interactions of DNA-binding proteins to single-stranded promoter elements that influence transcription efficiency have been observed in other eukaryotic promoters (33Bemark M. Olsson H. Heinegard D. Leanderson T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18881-18890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 34Tomonaga T. Levens D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Whether ssDNA-binding protein(s) identified here also plays a role in regulating transcription initiation in G. lamblia is not clear from current studies. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that a consensus T-tract sequence was present in all ssDNAs that exhibited protein-binding property (Table I), indicating that the T tract sequence may participate in protein binding on single-stranded ran promoter elements. Our results from DNA-protein competition assays also show that residual DNA-protein complexes were still present on long ssDNA fragments (−51/−20 or −20/−51) even with a 200–1,000-fold molar excess of the short DNA fragments or T8 (Fig. 7, B and C; also data not shown), indicating that the long DNA fragments exhibit higher affinities for binding nuclear proteins than short DNA fragments or that the long fragments may provide extra protein-binding sites for additional nuclear factors.

These possibilities remain to be investigated in the future.

We show that Fer forms trimers in vivoand that disruption of either the first or second coiled-coil domain abolishes oligomerization, suggesting a cooperative interaction between these two domains. Although Fps/Fes also forms homotypic oligomers, probably via homologous coiled-coil domains, no heterotypic interactions were observed between Fer and Fps/Fes. Incorporation of catalytically inactive Fer peptides into the oligomeric complex caused only mild reduction of wild type Fer kinase activity, suggesting that kinase-inactive Fer would not behave as a potent dominant negative. Although oligomerization of Fer can potentiate autophosphorylation intrans at three major phosphorylation sites, these residues can likely also be phosphorylated in cis. In contrast, the testis-specific FerT isomer does not oligomerize and is able to autophosphorylate in cis at two of the same three residues autophosphorylated in Fer.

Schalken J.A. Verbeek J.S. Van den Ouweland A.M.W. Onnekink C. Bloemers H.P.J. Van de Ven W.J.M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2897-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Indeed, Fer was first observed as one of two PTKs detected in myeloid cell lines using antibodies raised against viral Fps/Fes peptides. Peptide mapping analysis revealed these to be distinct, yet closely related PTKs (2Feldman R.A. Tam J.P. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1065-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 3MacDonald I. Levy J. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2543-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Human and rat cDNAs encoding Fer were subsequently cloned, and a comparison with the genes encoding cellular and viral Fps/Fes proteins confirmed the close structural similarity between p92 Fps/Fes (hereafter referred to as Fps) and p94 Fer (4Letwin K. Yee S.-P. Pawson T. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 621-627PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hao Q.-L. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1587-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 6Pawson T.

Although dozens of novel tyrosine kinases have been identified in recent years, Fps and Fer remain the only two known members of a distinct subclass within the nonreceptor PTK family. They each consist of a C-terminal tyrosine kinase domain, a central Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, and an N-terminal region, which contains three predicted coiled-coil (CC) motifs (7Kim L. Wong T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 8Read R.D. Lionberger J.M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18498-18503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Unlike members of the Src family, Fps and Fer do not possess N-terminal myristoylation sites, SH3 domains, or C-terminal negative regulatory tyrosine phosphorylation sites. It has been suggested that interactions between the SH2 and catalytic domains of Fps might serve a regulatory role (9Hjermstad S.J. Briggs S.D. Smithgall T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10519-10525Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 10Koch C.A. Moran M. Sadowski I. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4131-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar); however, a clearer understanding of this awaits detailed structural determination. By analogy with the receptor PTKs, activation of nonreceptor kinases may also be stimulated by oligomerization followed by autophosphorylation in trans. It has recently been suggested that homotypic CC interactions may mediate oligomerization of both Fer (7Kim L. Wong T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and Fps (8Read R.D. Lionberger J.M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18498-18503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The conserved putative CCs in these kinases could also mediate heterotypic interactions between Fer and Fps. This raises the possibility of functional or regulatory interactions between these two kinases. Alternatively, the CC domains could mediate interactions of these kinases with other CC domain-containing proteins. In this regard, the N-terminal domain of Fer has been shown to mediate association with the catenin family member, p120CAS (7Kim L. Wong T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In addition to the central armadillo repeats, p120CAS also contains a predicted N-terminal CC domain (11Reynolds A.B. Daniel J. McCrea P.D. Wheelock M.J. Wu J. Zhang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8333-8342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sirotkin H. O'Donnell H. DasGupta R. Halford S. St. Jore B. Puech A. Parimoo S. Morrow B. Skoultchi A. Weissman S.M. Scambler P. Kucherlapati R. Genomics. 1997; 41: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar); however, it is not known which domain confers interaction with Fer and whether this interaction is direct (13Kim L. Wong T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23542-23548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Fer has also been detected in association with the activated EGF and PDGF receptors in fibroblasts (7Kim L. Wong T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), as well as the FcεRI receptor in mast cells (14Penhallow R.C. Class K. Sonoda H. Bolen J.B. Rowley R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23362-23365Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In each of these cases, ligand stimulation of the receptor resulted in elevated Fer kinase activity. Associations of Fps with a number of cytokine receptors have also been described, including those for interleukin-3 (15Hanazono Y. Chiba S. Sasaki K. Mano H. Miyajima A. Arai K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1641-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (15Hanazono Y. Chiba S. Sasaki K. Mano H. Miyajima A. Arai K. Yazaki Y.

Due to the close similarity between Fps and Fer, many of the antisera currently in use are unable to distinguish between these two PTKs. This raises the possibility that the PTKs seen in association with some of these cytokine receptors may have been Fer rather than Fps. Alternatively, both kinases could be involved, just as different members of the Jak kinase family may be involved in signaling from some cytokine receptors (19Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). The expression patterns of Fps and Fer are quite distinct. Fps is more restricted, with relatively high levels seen in a limited subset of cell types including myeloid, vascular endothelial, and some epithelial and neuronal cells (20Haigh J. McVeigh J. Greer P. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 931-944PubMed Google Scholar, 21Care A. Mattia G. Montesoro E. Parolini I. Russo G. Colombo M.P. Peschle C. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 739-747PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, Fer is widely expressed (4Letwin K. Yee S.-P. Pawson T. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 621-627PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hao Q.-L. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1587-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and levels comparable with that of Fps in myeloid cells are observed in most tissues. A further distinctive characteristic offer is the expression of a testis-specific isoform, FerT, which likely arises from an internal tissue-specific promoter and alternative splicing (22Fischman K. Edman J.C. Shakleford G.M. Turner J.A. Rutter W.J. Nir U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 146-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Murine FerT lacks most of the N-terminal domain of p94 Fer and contains a unique 43-amino acid N terminus, followed by the common SH2 and kinase domains. ferT mRNA accumulates transiently in primary spermatocytes during the pachytene stage of meiotic prophase (23Keshet E. Itin A. Fischman K. Nir U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5021-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In Drosophila melanogaster, cDNAs encoding both the larger DFer and the shorter DFerT isoforms have been isolated (24Paulson R. Jackson J. Immergluck K. Bishop J.M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 641-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In Caenorhabditis elegans, a putative ferT homolog was identified on chromosome III (25Wilson R. Ainscough R. Anderson K. Baynes C. Berks M. Bonfield J. Burton J. Connell M. Copsey T. Cooper J. Coulson A. Craxton M. Dear S. Du Z. Durbin R. Favello A. Fraser A. Fulton L. Gardner A. Green P. Hawkins T. Hillier L. Jier M.

Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). However, there do not appear to be additional upstream coding sequences that would produce a larger Fer gene product, suggesting that sequences encoding the N-terminal domain of Fer had not yet evolved in C. elegans. There is currently little information regarding the molecular function of Fer, although a role in signaling downstream of activated platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and FcεRI receptors has been proposed (7Kim L. Wong T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 14Penhallow R.C. Class K. Sonoda H. Bolen J.B. Rowley R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23362-23365Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest roles for Fer in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton via interaction with cortactin (13Kim L. Wong T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23542-23548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and control of cell adhesion (26Rosato R. Velmaat J.M. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5762-5770Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). While fps was originally identified as a retroviral oncogene (27Huang C.C. Hammond C. Bishop J.M. J. Virol. 1984; 50: 125-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hampe A. Laprevotte I. Galibert F. Fedele L.A. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1982; 30: 775-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), the involvement of fer in malignancy or other diseases is not yet established. However, the human ferlocus maps to chromosome 5q21, in a region which is frequently deleted or rearranged in myeloid leukemia (29Lowenthal R.M. Marsden K.A. Int. J. Hematol. 1997; 65: 319-338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and recently the in vitro transforming potential of Fer was demonstrated (24Paulson R. Jackson J. Immergluck K. Bishop J.M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 641-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These observations suggest a role for Fer in cell signaling and growth control and a potential involvement in myeloid leukemia or other diseases. Here we examine the role of oligomerization in Fer kinase activation. We show that disruption of either the first or second CC domain completely abolishes oligomerization, and chemical cross-linking indicates that Fer forms trimers. Although both Fer and Fps exist as oligomers in vivo and they share conserved CC motifs, no heterotypic association between Fer and Fps was observed. Furthermore, we show that autophosphorylation of Fer probably involves bothcis and trans phosphorylation mechanisms. Tryptic phosphopeptide mapping revealed differences in autophosphorylation sites between Fer and FerT that may reflect differences in signal transduction between these isoforms. Fer proteins were produced in COS-1 cells using the vector pXN1, which is a modified version of pECE (30Ellis L. Clauser E. Morgan D.O. Ederly M. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cell. 1986; 45: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) in which the XbaI cloning site was converted to aNotI site by digestion with XbaI, and ligation with an annealed NotI adapter oligonucleotide (XNot, 5′-CTAGGCGGCCGC-3′). The 2.7-kilobase pair murine fercDNA from the pF2c.8 plasmid was excised with ApaI andDraI, blunted with Klenow, and subcloned into theSmaI site of pECE. The resulting pECEmFer plasmid was kindly provided by K. Letwin and T. Pawson. The construction of wild type and FerD743R expression constructs was as described previously (31Cole L.A. Zirngibl R. Craig A.W.B. Jia Z. Greer P. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids encoding Myc epitope-tagged wild type and FerK592R are as described previously (31Cole L.A. Zirngibl R. Craig A.W.B. Jia Z. Greer P. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Mutations within the CC domains were generated using the unique site elimination method (32Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) as recommended by the manufacturer (U.S.E. mutagenesis kit; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The selection primer (5′-AGATCTAAGCTTCTCGAGCACAGTGTGGAGG-3′) destroys a unique 5′SalI site in pESNmFerMyc and confers a XhoI restriction site. Both CC1- and CC2-mutagenic primers insert a proline codon and a StuI restriction site (KL134RP, 5′-GAATTGGAGAGGCCTAAATCCAGCTATCG-3′; ML322RP, 5′-CAGACCCAGCAGAGGCCTTTACACAAGGAGGC-3′). The Fer-N expression construct (encoding the N-terminal 462 amino acids of Fer) was generated by digestion of pECE-Fer with KpnI, followed by ligation of the released 1.5-kilobase fragment into the KpnI site of pECE (30Ellis L. Clauser E. Morgan D.O. Ederly M. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cell. 1986; 45: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Thus, the translation termination codon arises from vector sequences. The N-terminal deletion mutant Myc-FerΔN was constructed as follows. Polymerase chain reaction was carried out with a forward primer that conferred a BglII site and a Kozak consensus translation initiation site at methionine 412 (5′-GAAGATCTACCATGGAAAGAAAGGAGAGG-3′) and a reverse primer (5′-CTTGCAGCTTTTAATGGCAACAGG-3′). Both the resulting polymerase chain reaction product and the plasmid pESNmFerMyc were digested withBglII and KpnI (the latter digestion released a 1.5-kilobase fragment encoding the N-terminal CC domain of Fer), and following gel purification were ligated together. The resulting plasmid allows for initiation of translation at methionine 412 and the production of an N-terminally truncated Fer protein (Myc-FerΔN) that resembles the testis-specific FerT. Fps protein was expressed in COS-1 cells using the expression plasmid pEF4, which was generated by the insertion of an EcoRI fragment encoding the human fps cDNA from pLF5.13 (33Alcalay M. Antolini F. Van de Ven W.J. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 267-275PubMed Google Scholar) into the EcoRI site of pECE (30Ellis L. Clauser E. Morgan D.O. Ederly M. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cell. 1986; 45: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). The expression plasmid for Myc-Fps was constructed by replacing the green fluorescence protein-encoding portion of Fps-green fluorescence protein (20Haigh J. McVeigh J. Greer P. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 931-944PubMed Google Scholar) with six copies of the epitope recognized by the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 1-9E10, as described above for Fer. COS-1 cells were seeded onto 60-mm tissue culture dishes (Falcon) at approximately 25% confluence for transfections the following day. DNA-calcium phosphate precipitates were prepared in 4-ml polystyrene tubes by mixing plasmid DNA (see figure legends for amounts) in 600 μl of 0.25 mCaCl2 with 600 μl of 2× BBS solution (50 mm N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, 280 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.06). DNA precipitates were allowed to form for 60 min at room temperature and then resuspended and added dropwise to cells cultured in 4 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After overnight incubation, the medium was replaced, and cells were cultured an additional 24 h before harvesting. Cells were washed with ice-cold TBS-V (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl, 100 μm vanadate) and harvested by scraping into KLB (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholic acid, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. A fraction of the soluble cell lysates (∼15 μg) was retained for direct loading, while the remainder (∼300 μg) was added to 25 μl of 50% (v/v) GammaBind-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which had been preincubated with 200 μl of 1-9E10 anti-Myc hybridoma culture supernatant (34Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar). After mixing on a nutator platform for 2 h at 4 °C, immune complexes were collected by brief centrifugation, and washed five times with KLB followed by one wash with KRB (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MnCl2, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate). Kinase reactions were performed by resuspending the washed immune complex with 30 μl of KRB supplemented with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubating for 20 min at 30 °C. For kinase assays in which enolase was added, enolase was first denatured as follows. For 10 samples, 50 μg of enolase was diluted to 25 μl in 25 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm MnCl2, 50% glycerol and mixed with 25 μl of 50 mm acetic acid. Following incubation at 30 °C for 15 min, denatured enolase was diluted with 25 μl of water and 25 μl of 50 mm acetic acid. Immune complexes were resuspended in 20 μl of KRB-E (100 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 20 mm MnCl2) containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 μl of denatured enolase. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 30 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer and heating at 100 °C for 5 min. Proteins were then resolved on SDS-PAGE gels and either transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp.) using a semidry apparatus (Bio-Rad) or incubated in 1 m KOH at 50 °C for 2 h and then stained with Coomassie Blue and dried on a gel dryer (Bio-Rad). Kinase activity was determined on both the dried gel and membrane by autoradiography. Quantification was performed on an Instant Imager (Packard). Fer proteins were detected by incubation at room temperature for 1–2 h with 1:500 dilutions of rabbit polyclonal anti-FerLA antiserum (raised against a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein containing murine Fer amino acids Leu97 to Ala382 (20Haigh J. McVeigh J. Greer P. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 931-944PubMed Google Scholar)). To detect both Fer and Fps, a 1:500 dilution of anti-Fps/Fer antiserum was used (anti-Fps/Fer, also known as anti-FpsQE was raised against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing murine Fps amino acids Gln381 to Glu563 and is cross-reactive to both Fps and Fer (20Haigh J. McVeigh J. Greer P. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 931-944PubMed Google Scholar)). Myc-tagged Fer proteins were detected with 1:20 dilutions of 1-9E10 hybridoma culture supernatants. Anti-phosphotyrosine blotting was carried out with 1:1000 dilutions of monoclonal antibody PY99 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). After washing with TBS-T (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Tween-20), membranes were incubated with a 1:10,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (for anti-Fer or anti-Fps/Fer) or goat anti-mouse IgG (for 1-9E10 and PY99) secondary antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with TBS-T, immune complexes were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (NEN Life Science Products). Before reprobing of membranes with other antibodies, they were stripped by incubation in 0.2 n NaOH for 5 min followed by washing in TBS-T. Transfected COS-1 cells were harvested in X-linking buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) and clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Extracts were incubated on ice in the absence or presence of 1 mm ethylene glycol-bis(succinic acidN-hydroxysuccinimide ester) (EGS) for 15 min (EGS from Sigma was prepared as a 100 mm stock solution in Me2SO). The reactions were terminated by the addition of 1 μl of 50× TE (500 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 50 mmEDTA) and 50 μl of SDS-loading buffer. Samples were heated at 100 °C for 4 min, followed by SDS-PAGE, and prepared for Western blotting as described above. COS-1 cells were transfected and harvested, and immune complex kinase assays performed as described above. The sources of native Fer and FerT, were mouse liver and testis, respectively, which were homogenized in KLB. Fer was immunoprecipitated with anti-Fer polyclonal antiserum (5 μl), while FerT was immunoprecipitated with anti-Fps/Fer polyclonal antiserum (5 μl), and Myc epitope-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody 1-9E10. Following the kinase reactions, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and autoradiography was performed. Portions of the membrane containing the radiolabeled proteins were excised, placed in separate 1.5-ml tubes containing 1 ml of 0.5% polyvinyl pyrolidone-360 (in 100 mm acetic acid), and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Following aspiration, the membranes were washed five times with 1 ml of water and once with 50 mm NH4HCO3. Ten micrograms of diphenylcarbamyl chloride-treated trypsin (Sigma) in 200 μl of buffer (50 mm NH4HCO3(pH 8.3)) was added to each sample and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Following vortexing, reactions were supplemented with 1 μg of trypsin for 1 h at 37 °C; this step was then repeated. Water was added (300 μl), and samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min and then lyophilized. Oxidation was performed as follows. Pellets were dissolved in 100 μl of formic acid, and then 25 μl of methanol and 40 μl of performic acid (made fresh by combining 0.9 ml of formic acid with 0.1 ml of 30% H2O2 for 1 h at room temperature) were added; samples were incubated at 0 °C for 2 h. Each sample was divided into two 1.5-ml tubes, and 1.4 ml of water was added prior to lyophilization. Pellets were resuspended in 10 μl of pH 1.9 buffer (50 ml of formic acid (88%, w/v), 156 ml of glacial acetic acid, 1794 ml of water) and spotted on 20 × 20-cm cellulose TLC plates (Selecto Scientific) by the repeated addition of 0.5 μl. TLC plates were electrophoresed using a Hunter Thin Layer Electrophoresis System (C.B.S. Scientific Co.) in pH 1.9 buffer for 25 min at 1000 V. Following evaporation of the buffer, plates were rotated 90° and subjected to chromatography in phosphochromatography buffer (150 ml of n-butanol, 100 ml of pyridine, 30 ml of glacial acetic acid, 120 ml of water). Phosphopeptides were visualized by autoradiography. Fer is a 94-kDa protein that contains three predicted N-terminal CC motifs (CC1, CC2, and CC3), an SH2 domain, and a C-terminal protein-tyrosine kinase domain (Ref. 6Pawson T. Letwin K. Lee T. Hao Q.-L. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5722-5725Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar; shown schematically in Fig.1). In order to explore the role of the SH2 and N-terminal domains in Fer kinase regulation, we generated a series of expression constructs including two separate missense mutations within either catalytic subdomain II (K592R) or subdomain IX (D743R); mutations at either of these highly conserved residues completely abolished Fer kinase activity (31Cole L.A. Zirngibl R. Craig A.W.B. Jia Z. Greer P. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Also, wild-type and mutant Fer proteins were expressed with a C-terminal Myc epitope fusion (Myc-Fer), which encodes six copies of the epitope recognized by the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 1-9E10 (34Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar). To assess the role of the N terminus of Fer in oligomerization, two missense mutations were engineered that position a proline residue within either CC1 (KL134RP) or CC2 (ML322RP). The MultiCoil program (35Wolf E. Kim P.S. Berger B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) predicts mostly trimeric interactions for CC1 and CC2 but no multicoil interactions for CC3; the two mutations described above are predicted to abolish formation of multiple CC interactions. Two truncated proteins were also expressed including a C-terminal deletion of the SH2 and kinase domains that retains the CC domains (Fer-N) and an N-terminal deletion that encodes a Myc epitope-tagged protein containing only the SH2 and kinase domains of Fer (Myc-FerΔN). This truncated protein resembles the FerT protein found in testis that arises from usage of an internal testis-specific promoter located in fer (22Fischman K. Edman J.C. Shakleford G.M. Turner J.A. Rutter W.J. Nir U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 146-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Fps is a 92-kDa protein that is closely related to Fer and possesses a similar domain structure (1Roebroek A.J.M. Schalken J.A. Verbeek J.S. Van den Ouweland A.M.W. Onnekink C. Bloemers H.P.J. Van de Ven W.J.M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2897-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 8Read R.D. Lionberger J.M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18498-18503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The N-terminal CC domain of human Fps exhibits 37 and 35% identity to human and mouse Fer, respectively, while the SH2 and kinase domains of Fps and Fer display 67 and 68% sequence identity, respectively (6Pawson T. Letwin K. Lee T. Hao Q.-L. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5722-5725Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Fps was expressed both as an untagged protein and with a C-terminal Myc epitope fusion (Myc-Fps). Since both Fps and Fer possess N-terminal CC domains that are implicated in oligomerization in vitro (7Kim L. Wong T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 8Read R.D. Lionberger J.M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18498-18503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we wished to determine whether Fps and Fer form homotypic or heterotypic oligomers in vivo. COS-1 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing Fer, Fps, Myc-Fer, and Myc-Fps. At 48 h post-transfection, soluble cell lysates were collected; a fraction of each lysate was retained for Western blotting, while immunoprecipitations with anti-Myc were performed on the remainder of the lysates. Western blotting with antiserum that recognizes both Fps and Fer (anti-Fps/Fer), and in vitro kinase assays allowed for detection of Fps and Fer in the immunoprecipitates (Fig.2). Western blotting of soluble cell lysates from mock transfected COS-1 cells identified the endogenous simian Fer protein (top panel, lan"

Eukaryotic NDP kinases are hexamers composed of identical subunits (≈17 kDa). A distinctive property of human NDPK-B encoded by the genenm23-H 2 is its ability to stimulate the gene transcription. This property is independent of its catalytic activity and is possibly related to the role of this protein in cellular events including differentiation and tumor metastasis. In this paper, we report the first characterization of human NDPK-B·DNA complex formation using a filter-binding assay and fluorescence spectroscopy. We analyzed the binding of several oligonucleotides mimicking the promoter region of the c-myc oncogene including variants in sequence, structure, and length of both strands. We show that NDPK-B binds to single-stranded oligonucleotides in a nonsequence specific manner, but that it exhibits a poor binding activity to double-stranded oligonucleotides. This indicates that the specificity of recognition to DNA is a function of the structural conformation of DNA rather than of its specific sequence. Moreover, competition experiments performed with all nucleotides provide evidence for the contribution of the six active sites in the DNA·protein complex formation. We propose a mechanism through which human NDPK-B could stimulate transcription of c-myc or possibly other genes involved in cellular differentiation.

They catalyze the transfer of a phosphate from a nucleoside triphosphate to a nucleoside diphosphate via the formation of an enzymatic intermediate phosphorylated on a catalytic histidine residue (1Agarwal R.P.

They all share a common subunit fold, built around a βαββαβ motif, also present in the “palm domain” of DNA polymerases (5Morera S. Lacombe M.-L. Xu Y. LeBras G. Janin J. Structure. 1995; 3: 1307-131453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Although the prokaryotic enzyme from Myxococcus xanthus is a tetramer (6Williams R.L. Oren D.A.

Biol. 1993; 234: 1230-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), all eukaryotic enzymes known to date are hexamers composed of identical subunits each containing an active site. The hexameric state is essential for enzymatic activity, and binding of ADP or ATP contribute to the hexamer stability (7Mesnildrey S. Agou F. Karlsson A. Bonne D.D. Veron M. J. Biol.

Capeau J. Lacombe M. Hum. Genet. 1997; 99: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) have been identified so far. A fifth isoform, nm23-H 5 was isolated very recently but it does not exhibit NDP kinase activity when overexpressed in bacteria (12Munier A. Feral C. Milon L. Phung-Ba Pinon V. Gyapay G. Capeau J. Guellaen G. Lacombe M.L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Nm23-H1 and Nm23-H2 share the highest homology (88%) and can form heterohexamers (13Gilles A.M. Presecan E. Vonica A. Lascu I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8784-8789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nm23-H2/NDPK-B is present both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus (14Kraeft S.

Lacombe, personal communication. indicate that Nm23-H4 is a mitochondrial form of NDP kinase. Altered levels of expression of nm23-H 1,nm23-H 2 and DR-nm23 are associated with a variety of cellular processes including differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and suppression of tumor metastasis (17De La Rosa A. Williams R.L. Steeg P.S. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Using the serial analysis of gene expression method (18Velculescu V.E. Zhang L. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1995; 270: 484-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (3613) Google Scholar), it was shown thatnm23-H 2 was up-regulated in gastrointestinal tumors (19Zhang L. Zhou W. Velculescu V. Kern S. Hruban R. Hamilton S. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K. Science. 1997; 276: 1268-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the catalytic activity does not explain the role ofnm23 in these cellular processes (17De La Rosa A. Williams R.L. Steeg P.S. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 20Xu J. Liu L.Z. Deng X.F. Timmons L. Hersperger E. Steeg P. Veron M. Shearn A. Dev.

Cancer. 1992; 50: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A role for the nm23-H 2 gene product in cell regulation independent from its NDPK activity was first suggested by the observation that this protein binds to nucleic acids. Indeed NDPK-B was identified as a transcription factor based on its ability to stimulate the transcription in vitro of the c-mycgene (22Postel E.H. Berberich S.J. Flint S.J. Ferrone C.A. Science. 1993; 261: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). This stimulatory activity is independent from the enzymatic activity, because it was retained in a catalytically inactive mutant (23Postel E.H. Ferrone C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8627-8630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, transient transfections of a plasmid bearing the −160/−101 upstream nuclease hypersensitive element of the c-myc promoter (also termed PuF site or CT element), have shown that NDPK-B increases the expression of a reporter gene by 3–5-fold (24Berberich S.J. Postel E.H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2343-2347PubMed Google Scholar, 25Ji L. Arcinas M. Boxer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13392-13398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutations in the PuF site affect the transcriptional efficiency of NDPK-B (25Ji L. Arcinas M. Boxer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13392-13398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However Michelotti et al. (26Michelotti E.F. Sanford S. Freije J.M.P. MacDonald N.J. Steeg P.S. Levens D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22526-22530Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) using a one-hybrid system, showed that NDPK-B is not a conventional transcription factor. The nuclease hypersensitive element contains a sequence homopurine/homopyrimidine-rich, which is prone to form non-B duplex DNA-like intermolecular triplexes (27Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1095-1098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Mirkin S.M. Lyamichev V.I. Drushlyak K.N. Dobrynin V.N. Filippov S.A.

Biol. 1996; 16: 2656-2659Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), presumably resulting from the appearance of secondary structure. Using a mobility shift assay, we reported previously a qualitative analysis of the DNA-binding properties of NDPK-B (32Hildebrandt M. Lacombe M.-L. Mesnildrey S. Veron M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3858-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), indicating a preference for single strand binding. In this study, we report the first quantitative analysis of human NDPK-B·DNA complex formation using several biochemical methods. We show that NDPK-B binds to single-stranded oligonucleotides in a nonsequence specific manner, but that it exhibits strong specificity for single-stranded DNA. Moreover, competition experiments performed with NDPs show that the affinity for DNA is significantly higher than for nucleosides di- and triphosphates, and provide evidence that the six active sites of the hexamer form a binding template for the interaction with oligonucleotides. We propose a mechanism through which human NDPK-B could stimulate transcription of c-myc and possibly of other genes involved in cellular differentiation. The oligonucleotides were purchased from Genset or Pasteur Institute. All NDPs and GTP were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from New England Biolabs. All oligonucleotides were gel-purified following protocols derived from Sambrook et al. (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The elution buffer was 0.3m sodium acetate, pH 7, and 1 mm EDTA. The short oligonucleotides (10 polymers) were precipitated out of the solution in dry ice using an ethanol/isopropanol (4:1 v/v) mixture, which improved the recovery of precipitation. The pellet was washed twice with 95% ethanol and resuspended in water. Concentrations of single strand and double strand oligonucleotides were measured by absorbance at 260 nm according to the nearest neighbor approximations of Puglisi and Tinoco (34Puglisi J.D. Tinoco Jr., I. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 304-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) for single strand and using an extinction coefficient of 1.68 × 104m base pair−1 × cm−1 for double strand. The expression vector pJC20 containing the complete coding sequence of the nm23-H 2 cDNA was a gift from Dr. M. Konrad (Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Göttingen). Expression of human NDPK-B was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h when the culture (5 liters) reached a cell density ofA 600 nm ≈ 0.5. After harvesting by centrifugation, the cells were washed twice and resuspended in extraction buffer (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm magnesium chloride, and 1 mm DTE) containing protease inhibitors. Cells were broken in a French press at 1,500 p.s.i. The lysate was diluted 2.5-fold with extraction buffer and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 20 min. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Following precipitation of nucleic acids by addition of Polymin P (BASF) at 0.15% (v/v) and centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 15 min, the clear supernatant (162 ml) was applied to a POROS HQ column (PerSeptive Biosystems, 2.6 × 12 cm), equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5% glycerol and 1 mm DTE. The recombinant NDPK-B was recovered in the flow-through fraction and was separated from the endogenous NDP kinase from E. coli, which binds to the matrix. Fractions containing NDP kinase activity were pooled (174 ml) and applied to a POROS HS (1.6 × 16 cm) equilibrated in 25 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm DTE, and eluted with a 650-ml linear gradient of potassium phosphate (25–400 mm). Protein-containing fractions according to the optical density profile at 280 nm were pooled (45 ml), applied on a ceramic hydroxyapatite column (American International Chemical, 1.6 × 10 cm), equilibrated in 25 mm potassium phosphate, 5% glycerol, and 1 mmDTE and eluted with a 520-ml linear gradient of potassium phosphate (25–400 mm). Fractions containing NDPK-B were concentrated, and the excess salt removed by ultrafiltration (Amicon). The protein sample was then dialyzed against 25 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 2 mm DTE, and 50% glycerol, and stored at −20 °C. The protein at this stage was >99% pure, appearing as single band after Coomassie or silver staining of a polyacrylamide gel under denaturating conditions. Protein concentration was determined either by the method of Bradford or by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1.238 for a 1 mg/ml solution. NDP kinase activity was assayed by a coupled assay using 0.2 mmdTDP as the phosphate acceptor in the presence of 1 mm ATP as described (35Karlsson A. Mesnildrey S. Xu Y. Morera S. Janin J. Veron M.

The specific activity of pure NDPK-B was 1,400 units/mg (1 unit corresponds to the amount of dTDP (micromoles) transformed/min at 25 °C).

All oligonucleotides used in filter-binding experiments (see Table I) were radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. Radiolabeled oligonucleotides were separated from free [γ-32P]ATP on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Labeled oligonucleotides were incubated with NDPK-B in a 30-μl total volume of binding buffer at pH 5.5 (FS buffer, 20 mm Tris/acetic acid/MES, 20% glycerol, 5 mm magnesium chloride, and 1 mm DTE) or at a different pH for 30 min at 4 °C. Reaction mixtures were passed through a nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 μm pore size, Millipore HA filters) under reduced pressure in a cold room. Before sample application, the filter was pretreated with 0.5 ml of the FS buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. After application of the samples, the filters were washed twice with 0.5 ml of FS buffer containing, 20, 50, 100, or 200 mm potassium chloride. The filters were then dried and counted by liquid scintillation. The filter efficiency (E) was determined from Equation 1, E=CS−CBCT−CBEquation 1 where C S represents the counts retained on the filter when the oligonucleotides are saturated with NDPK-B (NDPK-B → ∞), C B represents the background counts obtained when the oligonucleotide is filtered without NDPK-B andC T is the total input counts. The salt dependence of the binding of NDPK-B to the oligonucleotide was determined by conducting titration experiments in FS buffer and washing buffer at pH 5.5 with different potassium chloride concentrations. The effect of the salt concentration on complex formation has been described by the relation (36Record Jr., M.T. Lohman M.L. De Haseth P. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 107: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar), −∂lnKD∂ln[K+]=−m′·ψEquation 2 where m′ is the number of ion pairs formed and Ψ is the fraction of counterion bound per phosphate group, which is assumed to be 0.71 (36Record Jr., M.T. Lohman M.L. De Haseth P. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 107: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Assuming that m′ is equivalent toN, the number of ion pairs, the non-electrostatic contributions to the free energy of binding (ΔG 0ne) has been estimated according to Equation 3, ΔGne0=ΔGobs0(1MK+)−NΔGLys0Equation 3 where ΔG 0obs is the standard free energy at [K+] = 1 m, ΔG 0Lys is the standard free energy of formation of a single lysine-phosphate ionic interaction and corresponds to ≈0.18 kcal·mol−1 at [K+] = 1 m (36Record Jr., M.T. Lohman M.L. De Haseth P. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 107: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 37Lohman T.M. deHaseth P.L. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3522-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To measure the effect of NDP on NDPK-B/oligonucleotide binding, competition experiments were performed. The oligonucleotide c-myc/ssPu-30 (70 nm), radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP was incubated at 4 °C with NDPK-B (120 nm) in FS buffer. Variable amounts of NDP (10 nm → 5 μm) were then added (final volume; 30 μl). After binding was complete (30 min), the samples were filtered and washed with 2 × 500 μl washing buffer (FS) containing 20 mm potassium chloride. Using mass balance and equilibrium binding equations, the equilibrium mixture of γ-32P-oligonucleotide (DNA) and competitor NDP (I) binding to NDPK-B (P) can be described by Equation 4, [DNA·P][DNA]T=KD(1+([I]/KI))+[DNA]T+[P]T− KD(1+([I]/KI))+[DNA]T+[P]T−4·[DNA]T·[P]T/2·[DNA]TEquation 4 where [DNA]T, [P]T are the total concentration of the radiolabeled oligonucleotide and NDPK-B, respectively, and I is the free concentration of inhibitor NDP, which in our conditions is very close to the total concentration.K D is the dissociation constant for the DNA-NDPK-B interaction and K I is the inhibition constant for the NDP-NDPK-B interaction. All fluorescence measurements were performed on a PTI spectrofluorometer Quantamaster™ at 20 °C, in a buffer 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 75 mm potassium chloride, 5% glycerol, 5 mmmagnesium chloride, and 1 mm DTE. The excitation wavelength was 304 nm to minimize the contribution of tyrosyl residues to the total fluorescence and the inner filter due to light absorption by the oligonucleotide. Protein fluorescence was measured at 340 nm and the excitation and emission bandwidths were both set to 2.5 nm. The oligonucleotide titrations were carried out with NDPK-B monomeric concentrations of 0.5–2 μm (1 ml) by adding varying amounts of DNA to a constant concentration of NDPK-B. In all titration experiments, the progressive dilution during the course of titration never exceeded 5%. Following the addition of the saturating oligonucleotide concentration, the equilibrium state was checked by recording the protein fluorescence during 5 min. In the fluorescence titrations each reading was collected for 60 s after a 1-min period of equilibration. The extent of photobleaching was determined by performing experiments without adding the oligonucleotide. The decrease in fluorescence due to photobleaching is less than 0.6% in a 15-point titration. Bimolecular binding data were fitted to the Langmuir binding equation. The independent variable in these experiments was either total oligonucleotide or total NDPK-B concentrations. The equation was then converted to a function of total NDPK-B and total oligonucleotide for fluorescence experiments (Eq. 5); [DNA·P]=KD+[DNA]T+n[P]T−KD+[DNA]T+n[P]T−4[DNA]Tn[P]T=AEquation 5 where K D represents the dissociation constant, [P]T is the total NDPK-B concentration,n is the number of equivalent binding sites, and [DNA]T is the total oligonucleotide concentration (a similar scheme can be worked out for titration of DNA by NDPK-B using the filter-binding assay; [DNA]T is substituted forn[DNA]T and n[P]T for [P]T). For fluorescence experiments, because the quenching was directly proportional to binding, the theoretical quenching was F obs = (F 0− F max)·A′ +F 0 (Eq. 5′) where F 0 is the initial fluorescence intensity before addition of the oligonucleotide, F max is the fluorescence after saturation with the oligonucleotide, and A′ is the molar fraction of protein site occupied. In the filter-binding assay, the fraction of oligonucleotide retained on a filter, R, was calculated as follows: (C −C B)/(C T − C B) where C is the counts retained on the filter,C B is the counts obtained in the absence of NDPK-B, and C T is the total input counts. Experimental data were fitted according to the symmetric equation derived from Equation5, including the filter efficiency, E, as follows:R = E·A“ where A” is the molar fraction of oligonucleotide bound. All experimental data were fitted by nonlinear regression analysis using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm in the commercially available graphics software package KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading PA). For fluorescence experiments, because it is hazardous to fit the experimental data with two parameters estimated (n and K D), we determined graphically the stoichiometry n using a NDPK-B concentration (2 μm) higher than theK D expected, such that the abscissa of the intersection between the initial tangent and the asymptote is practically equal to n·[NDPK-B]T. Then, theK D was calculated by fitting the equation (Eq. 5′) using a NDPK-B concentration of 0.5 μm. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed at 9,000, 12,000, 16,000, and 18,000 rpm at 15 or 10 °C in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge, using an An-60 Ti rotor and a double-sector cell of 12-mm path-length. Enzyme samples (400 μl) were dialyzed exhaustively against three changes of buffer (500 ml each) described in Table III. Equilibrium was verified from the superimposition of duplicate scans recorded at 3 h intervals. The experimental data were first fitted to a model for a single homogeneous species following Equation 6 (38Laue T.M. Bhaivari D.S. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C.

The partial specific volume was calculated from the amino acid composition of the protein, and the density of the buffers was determined from published tables (38Laue T.M. Bhaivari D.S. Ridgeway T.M.

After collecting data at sedimentation equilibrium, samples were centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 12 h to sediment the protein, and radial scans were again collected to obtain a base-line correction for each cell. In all cases, because inclusion of a second virial coefficient gave no improvement of the fit, nonideality in the system was not detected.Table IIISedimentation equilibrium analysis of human NDPK-BBufferTemperatureInitial protein concentrationSpeedMolecular mass observedMolecular species°Cmg/mlrpmDa%50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 89,00097,000 ± 8,000100 α65 mmMgCl21 mmEDTA150.212,000105,000 ± 3,000aThe sedimentation profile of human NDPK-B is shown in Fig. 1.100 α6100 mm KCl1 mmDTE18,000100,000 ± 4,000100 α610 mm MES, pH 6.05 mmMgCl2100.216,000106,000 ± 6,000100 α61 mm DTEExperimental conditions were similar to those used by (39Schaertl S.

https://openalex.org/W2171753511,"Amphiphysin I and II are nerve terminal-enriched proteins containing SH3 domains that interact with dynamin and synaptojanin. The amphiphysins may function in synaptic vesicle endocytosis by targeting synaptojanin and dynamin to emerging endocytic buds through SH3 domain-independent interactions with clathrin and AP2. We have recently identified and cloned several amphiphysin II splice variants that differentially incorporate clathrin-binding domains. To determine whether these domains function in membrane targeting, we used immunofluorescence to examine the potential localization of amphiphysin II variants to clathrin-coated pits on plasma membranes purified from transfected COS-7 cells. Full-length amphiphysin II targets to the plasma membrane where it partially co-localizes with clathrin. However, splice variants and deletion constructs lacking clathrin-binding domains still target to the plasma membrane, and removal of clathrin from the membrane does not affect amphiphysin II distribution. Surprisingly, plasma membrane targeting was dependent on the presence of a 31-amino acid alternatively spliced sequence at the N terminus of amphiphysin II, a result confirmed using subcellular fractionation. In binding assays, the 31-amino acid sequence was also found to facilitate amphiphysin dimerization mediated through the N terminus. Taken together, these data support a role for the N terminus of amphiphysin II in membrane targeting during endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1970918529,"The host response to infection is associated with multiple alterations in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. We have shown recently that endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) and cytokines enhance hepatic sphingolipid synthesis, increase the activity and mRNA levels of serine palmitoyltransferase, the first committed step in sphingolipid synthesis, and increase the content of sphingomyelin, ceramide, and glucosylceramide (GlcCer) in circulating lipoproteins in Syrian hamsters. Since the LPS-induced increase in GlcCer content of lipoproteins was far greater than that of ceramide or sphingomyelin, we have now examined the effect of LPS and cytokines on glycosphingolipid metabolism. LPS markedly increased the mRNA level of hepatic GlcCer synthase, the enzyme that catalyzes the first glycosylation step of glycosphingolipid synthesis. The LPS-induced increase in GlcCer synthase mRNA levels was seen within 2 h, sustained for 8 h, and declined to base line by 24 h. LPS-induced increase in GlcCer synthase mRNA was partly accounted for by an increase in its transcription rate. LPS produced a 3–4-fold increase in hepatic GlcCer synthase activity and significantly increased the content of GlcCer (the immediate product of GlcCer synthase reaction) as well as ceramide trihexoside and ganglioside GM3 (products distal to the GlcCer synthase step) in the liver. Moreover, both tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β, cytokines that mediate many of the metabolic effects of LPS, increased hepatic GlcCer synthase mRNA levels in vivo as well as in HepG2 cellsin vitro, suggesting that these cytokines can directly stimulate glycosphingolipid metabolism. These results indicate that LPS and cytokines up-regulate glycosphingolipid metabolism in vivo and in vitro.

GSLs are present in the plasma membrane of all eukaryotic cells and are involved in a variety of important biological processes, including cell recognition, proliferation and differentiation, regulation of cell growth, signal transduction, interaction with bacterial toxins, and modulation of immune responses (reviewed in Refs. 2Hakomori S.I.

The acute phase response represents an early and highly complex reaction of the host to infection, inflammation, or trauma and is accompanied by changes in hepatic synthesis of several acute phase proteins such as increases in C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A (5Kushner I. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 389: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). The acute phase response is also accompanied by several changes in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism that include stimulation of fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis and a marked increase in serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels (6Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1992; 200: 224-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These metabolic alterations can be induced by endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) treatment, which mimics Gram-negative infections (7Hardardottir I. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The effects of LPS are in turn mediated by cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and it has been shown that many of the metabolic effects of infection, inflammation, and trauma can be induced by these cytokines (reviewed in Ref. 7Hardardottir I.

LPS induced a 75% and 2.5-fold increase in hepatic sphingomyelin and ceramide synthesis, respectively, as well as a 2-fold increase in the activity of hepatic serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), the first and rate-limiting enzyme in sphingolipid synthesis (10Memon R.A.

LPS also increased SPT mRNA levels, suggesting that the increase in SPT activity was due to an increase in its mRNA. Finally, lipoproteins isolated from Syrian hamsters treated with LPS contained significantly higher levels of ceramide, sphingomyelin, and glucosylceramide (GlcCer) (10Memon R.A. Holleran W.M. Moser A.H. Seki T. Uchida Y. Fuller J. Shigenaga J.K. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). It is of note that the increases in GlcCer levels (19-fold in VLDL and 7.3-fold in LDL) were greater than the increases in ceramide (3.7- and 2.2-fold in VLDL and LDL, respectively) and sphingomyelin (no change in VLDL and 84% increase in LDL), suggesting that GlcCer synthesis may be regulated at a step distal to SPT. GlcCer is the precursor of all neutral GSLs as well as the sialic acid-containing acidic GSLs or gangliosides (11Paul P. Kamisaka Y. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2287-2293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and is synthesized by the enzyme GlcCer synthase (UDP-glucose:N-acylsphingosined-glucosyltransferase or GLcT-1; EC 2.4.1.80) that catalyzes the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to ceramide (11Paul P. Kamisaka Y. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2287-2293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The cDNA for human GlcCer synthase was recently cloned and was shown to be expressed ubiquitously (12Ichikawa S. Sakiyama H. Suzuki G. Kazuya I.P. Hidari J. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4638-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). As the first enzyme in the GSL synthetic pathway, it is likely that the regulation of GlcCer synthase will play an important role in determining the rate of formation of GSLs. The metabolism of GlcCer and the regulation of GlcCer synthase has been extensively studied in mammalian skin (13Holleran W.M. Takagi Y. Menon G.K. Legler G. Feingold K.R. Elias P.M. J. Clin.

However, very little is known about the factors that regulate GlcCer synthase activity and expression in tissues other than the epidermis despite its ubiquitous expression (19Shukla A. Shukla G.S. Radin W.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F24-F29PubMed Google Scholar, 20Deshmukh G.D. Radin N.S. Gattone V.H. Shayman J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1611-1618PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the striking increase in GlcCer content of circulating lipoproteins following LPS treatment (10Memon R.A. Holleran W.M. Moser A.H. Seki T. Uchida Y. Fuller J. Shigenaga J.K. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), we postulated that LPS and cytokines might increase GlcCer synthase in the liver. The present study was designed to determine whether LPS and cytokines regulate GlcCer synthase mRNA and activity both in the liver of intact animals and in HepG2 cells (a human hepatoma cell line) in vitro. We have also examined the effect of LPS on the content of several GSLs in the liver. [14C]UDP-glucose (263 mCi/mmol) and [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Multiprime DNA labeling system was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Amersham, United Kingdom); minispin G-50 columns were from Worthington; oligo(dT)-cellulose type 77F was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Upsala, Sweden); and Nytran membranes were from Schleicher & Schuell. Kodak XAR5 film was used for autoradiography. High performance TLC plates (silica gel 60) were obtained from Merck. Chromatography standards, including ceramide, sphingomyelin, and GlcCer, were purchased from Sigma. Ceramide trihexoside and gangliosides were obtained from Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA). LPS (Escherichia coli 55:B5) was purchased from Difco and was freshly diluted to desired concentrations in pyrogen-free 0.9% saline (Kendall McGraw Laboratories, Inc.). Human TNF-α with a specific activity of 5 × 107 units/mg was provided by Genentech, Inc. Recombinant human IL-1β with a specific activity of 1 × 109 units/mg was provided by Immunex. Human IL-6 was provided by Walters Fiers (University of Ghent, Ghent, Belgium). The cytokines were freshly diluted to desired concentrations in pyrogen-free 0.9% saline containing 0.1% human serum albumin. Male Syrian hamsters (140–160 g) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). The animals were maintained in a reverse-light-cycle room (3 a.m. to 3 p.m. dark, 3 p.m. to 3 a.m. light) and were provided with rodent chow and water ad libitum. Anesthesia was induced with halothane, and the animals were injected intraperitoneally with LPS, TNF-α, or IL-1β at the indicated doses in 0.5 ml of 0.9% saline or with saline alone. Food was subsequently withdrawn from both control and treated animals, because LPS and cytokines induce anorexia (21Grunfeld C. Zhao C. Fuller J. Moser A.H. Friedman J. Feingold K.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2152-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Animals were studied 2–24 h after LPS administration or 8 h after cytokine administration as indicated in the text. The doses of LPS used (0.1 to 100 μg/100 g body weight (BW)) have significant effects on triglyceride, cholesterol, and sphingolipid metabolism in Syrian hamsters (10Memon R.A. Holleran W.M. Moser A.H. Seki T. Uchida Y. Fuller J. Shigenaga J.K. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 22Feingold K.R.

Similarly, the doses of TNF-α and IL-1β (17 and 1 μg/100 g BW, respectively) were chosen, because previous studies have demonstrated that these doses have marked effects on serum lipid and lipoprotein levels, reproducing many of the effects of LPS on lipid metabolism in Syrian hamster (10Memon R.A.

The synthesis of GlcCer from exogenous ceramide was assayed as described (15Chujor C.S.N. Feingold K.R. Elias P.M. Holleran W.M. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 277-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hanley K. Jiang Y. Holleran W.M. Elias P.M. Williams M.L. Feingold K.R. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 576-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the total assay volume of 110 μl contained 50 μmUDP-[U-14C]glucose (70 mCi/mmol), 50 mm MOPS (pH 6.5), 5 mm MnCl2, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm NADPH, 5 mmdimercaptopropanol, and 1% w/v CHAPS. The solid substrate was prepared by adsorbing 20 μg of ceramide (Type IV; Sigma) onto 1 mg of silica gel, and the reaction was initiated with the addition of 0.1–0.2 mg of microsomal protein. The incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of ice-cold PBS. Pellets were washed four times by resuspension in PBS (4 °C) and centrifugation. The final pellets were resuspended in PBS, and the radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Total RNA was isolated by a variation of the guanidinium thiocyanate method (25Chomezynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63082) Google Scholar) as described earlier (22Feingold K.R. Hardardottir I. Memon R.A. Krul E.J. Moser A.H. Taylor J.M. Grunfeld C. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 2147-2158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using oligo(dT)-cellolose and was quantified by measuring absorption at 260 nm. Gel electrophoresis, transfer, and Northern blotting were performed as described previously (22Feingold K.R. Hardardottir I. Memon R.A. Krul E.J. Moser A.H. Taylor J.M. Grunfeld C. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 2147-2158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The uniformity of sample applications was checked by UV visualization of the acridine orange-stained gels before transfer to Nytran membranes. The cDNA probe hybridization was performed as described earlier (22Feingold K.R. Hardardottir I. Memon R.A. Krul E.J. Moser A.H. Taylor J.M. Grunfeld C. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 2147-2158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The blots were exposed to x-ray films for various time periods to ensure that measurements were done on the linear portion of the curve, and the bands were quantified by densitometry. We and other (22Feingold K.R. Hardardottir I. Memon R.A. Krul E.J. Moser A.H. Taylor J.M. Grunfeld C. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 2147-2158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Morrow J.F.

A. 1981; 78: 4718-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) have found that LPS increases actin mRNA levels in liver by 2–5-fold in rodents. TNF-α and IL-1β produce a 2-fold increase in actin mRNA levels. LPS also produced a 2.6-fold increase in cyclophilin mRNA in liver (27Memon R.A. Feingold K.R. Moser A.H. Fuller J. Grunfeld C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 37: E210-E217Google Scholar). Thus, the mRNA levels of actin, and cyclophilin, which are widely used for normalizing data, cannot be used to study LPS-induced or cytokine-induced regulation of proteins in liver. However, the differing direction of the changes in mRNA levels for specific proteins after LPS or cytokine administration, the magnitude of the alterations, and the relatively small standard error of the mean make it unlikely that the changes observed were due to unequal loading of mRNA. Nuclei were isolated from hamster liver using the homogenization procedure described by Clarkeet al. (28Clarke C.F. Fogelman A.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14363-14367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of transcription in hamster liver nuclei was measured using the nuclear run-on assay as described earlier (23Feingold K.R. Pollack A.S. Moser A.H. Shigenaga J.K. Grunfeld C. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1474-1482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactive RNA bound to nylon filters was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Whole livers were cut into small pieces, homogenized with chloroform/methanol (2:1) using a Polytron tissue homogenizer, and incubated at 40 °C for 20 min. Total lipids were then extracted consecutively with chloroform/methanol (1:2, 2:1, 1:2, and 1:1; v/v). The resultant combined total lipids were then fractionated into neutral and acidic lipids using DEAE-Sephadex A-25 (acetate form, Sigma) column as described earlier (29Holleran W.M. DeGregorio M.W. Ganapathi R. Wilber J.R. Macher B.A. Can. Chemother. Pharmacol. 1986; 17: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Desalting of acidic lipid fraction was achieved by column chromatography (Sep-Pak C18, Waters, Milford, MA). Approximately 0.5–1.5 mg of lipid from each sample was applied to high performance TLC plates, along with individual standards including ceramide, GlcCer, and sphingomyelin, ceramide trihexoside (globotriosyl ceramide or Gb3), and gangliosides GM3, GM1, and GD1a. Ceramide and GlcCer were separated by development in chloroform/methanol/water (40:10:1, v/v) to 2 cm and then to 5 cm, followed by chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (94:1:4, v/v) to the top of the plate. Other neutral GSLs were separated by chloroform/methanol/0.2% CaCl2 (65:23:3, v/v). Acidic GSLs were developed in chloroform/methanol/0.02% CaCl2(55:40:10, v/v), while sphingomyelin was separated using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid water (50:30:8:4, v/v). The plates were then sprayed with either charring solution (cupric acetate reagent for ceramide and sphingomyelin), orcinol reagent (for neutral GSLs) or resorcinol reagent (for acidic GSLs), and heated. Individual lipids were quantified by scanning densitometry as described previously (30Holleran W.M. Feingold K.R. Man M.Q. Gao W.N. Lee J.M. Elias P.M. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1151-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HepG2 cells (a human hepatoma cell line) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassa, VA) and maintained in minimum essential medium (Mediatech, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum under standard culture conditions (5% CO2, 37 °C). Cells were seeded into 100-mm culture dishes and allowed to grow to 80% confluence. Immediately before the experiment, cells were washed with calcium- and magnesium-free PBS, and the experimental medium (Dulbecco's minimum essential medium plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin) containing TNF-α, IL-1β, or IL-6 at the indicated concentrations was added. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. RNA purification and Northern blotting were performed according to previously described methods (22Feingold K.R. Hardardottir I. Memon R.A. Krul E.J. Moser A.H. Taylor J.M. Grunfeld C. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 2147-2158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance between two groups was determined by using the Student's t test. Comparison among several groups was performed by analysis of variance, and significance was calculated by using Bonferroni's post hoc test. We first examined the effect of LPS treatment (100 μg/100 g BW) on GlcCer synthase mRNA levels in the liver of Syrian hamsters. As shown in Fig. 1 A, hepatic GlcCer synthase mRNA levels increased nearly 20-fold within 2 h following LPS administration. The LPS-induced increase in GlcCer synthase mRNA levels is sustained for 8 h, returning to base line by 24 h. The dose-response curve for LPS effect on GlcCer synthase mRNA levels was performed at 8 h after administration. The data presented demonstrate that the LPS-induced increase in hepatic GlcCer synthase mRNA levels is a very sensitive response, with the half-maximal increase seen with ∼0.3 μg/100 g BW LPS and a maximal response at 1 μg/100 g BW (Fig. 1 B). Thus, very low doses of LPS stimulate a rapid and marked increase in GlcCer synthase mRNA levels in liver. In order to examine the mechanism for the induction of GlcCer synthase mRNA, we next measured the rate of transcription in liver nuclei obtained from control and LPS-treated (100 μg/100 g BW, 4-h treatment) hamsters. The data presented in Fig.2 demonstrate that the rate of GlcCer synthase transcription was 2.4-fold higher in liver nuclei from LPS-treated hamsters, suggesting that an increased rate of transcription partly accounts for the increase in GlcCer synthase mRNA levels after LPS treatment. We then determined if the increase in GlcCer synthase mRNA levels results in a change in hepatic GlcCer synthase activity. LPS treatment produced a 3.3- and 4.2-fold increase in GlcCer synthase activity in the liver after 8 and 16 h of treatment, respectively (Fig.3). To determine whether the increase in hepatic GlcCer synthase activity is reflected in changes in hepatic GSLs, we next measured their content in the liver after LPS treatment. The major GSLs detected in Syrian hamster liver were GlcCer, ceramide trihexoside, and ganglioside GM3. The data presented in Fig.4 A demonstrate that the content of ceramide (the immediate precursor of GlcCer) is decreased, whereas the content of GlcCer (the immediate product of GlcCer synthase reaction) is significantly increased in the livers of LPS-treated animals. Moreover, the levels of ceramide trihexoside (Fig. 4 A) and ganglioside GM3 (Fig.4 B), both distal products of GlcCer synthase, are also increased in the liver. Finally, the content of sphingomyelin, the most abundant sphingolipid in the liver, was not altered by LPS treatment (control, 25.6 ± 2.33 versus LPS 26.3 ± 1.6 μg/mg neutral lipid, p = not significant). Thus, the LPS-induced increase in GlcCer synthase activity regulates the levels of specific precursors and downstream glycosphingolipid metabolites in the liver.Figure 4Effect of LPS on ceramide (Cer), GlcCer ( GlcCer ), ceramide trihexoside (CTH) (A) and ganglioside GM3 ( GM3 ) (B) content in the liver. Syrian hamsters were injected with saline or LPS (100 μg/100 g BW), and the animals were killed after 8 h. Individual sphingolipids and GSLs were isolated by high performance TLC and quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are mean ± S.E.; n = 5 for all groups.

Feingold K.R. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1992; 200: 224-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 7Hardardottir I. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), we next examined the effect of TNF-α and IL-1β on hepatic GlcCer synthase mRNA levels in vivo. IL-1β produced a 9-fold increase in GlcCer synthase mRNA levels, while TNF-α induced a 2-fold increase (Fig.5). To determine whether cytokines, that mediate the acute phase response, could directly regulate hepatic GlcCer synthase, we determined the effect of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in HepG2 cells, a human hepatoma cell line. Both TNF-α and IL-1β increased GlcCer synthase mRNA in HepG2 cells, whereas IL-6 had no effect (Fig. 6). Because IL-1β was most effective in inducing GlcCer synthase mRNA in HepG2 cells as well as in the livers of intact animals, we performed additional studies on the effect of IL-1β in HepG2 cells. The data presented in Fig. 7 A show that IL-1β induced a rapid increase in GlcCer synthase mRNA levels, with the earliest increase observed after 2 h and a maximal effect at 8 h. This effect was sustained for at least 24 h (Fig.7 A). Furthermore, the dose-response studies showed that the maximal increase in GlcCer synthase mRNA levels was observed at 1 ng/ml IL-1β, and the half-maximal response occurred at ∼0.03 ng/ml (Fig. 7 B), suggesting that the increase in GlcCer synthase mRNA levels in HepG2 cells is a very sensitive response to IL-1β. Thus, similar to the in vivo results presented above, very low doses of IL-1β rapidly increase GlcCer synthase mRNA levels in HepG2 cells in vitro.Figure 6Effect of cytokines on GlcCer synthase mRNA in HepG2 cells. TNF, IL-1, or IL-6 were added to HepG2 cells at a concentration of 100 ng/ml.

In Syrian hamsters, LPS administration results in a 12–20-fold increase in GlcCer synthase mRNA levels in the liver. This stimulation occurs rapidly (within 2 h), and is a very sensitive response to LPS (half-maximal response at 0.3 μg/100 g BW compared with a LD50 of approximately 5 mg/100 g BW). Moreover, this increase in GlcCer synthase mRNA levels is accompanied by a 3–4-fold increase in hepatic GlcCer synthase activity. Preliminary studies from our laboratory also indicate that LPS acutely produces a marked increase in GlcCer synthase mRNA levels and a modest increase in GlcCer synthase activity in spleen and kidney, 2R. A. Memon, C. Grunfeld, and K. R. Feingold, unpublished observation. but has no effect on brain or small intestine GlcCer synthase mRNA, suggesting that the effects of LPS on GSL metabolism are tissue-specific. The modest increase in LPS-induced GlcCer synthase transcription as compared with a profound increase in mRNA levels suggests that increased transcription only partly accounts for the increase in mRNA levels, and there could be additional regulation at the post-transcriptional level. Whether GlcCer synthase mRNA degradation is altered during the acute phase response is unknown and is very difficult to evaluate in an in vivo animal model. The marked difference in the magnitude of increase in mRNA level versus enzyme activity also indicates additional regulatory mechanisms. It is also possible that GlcCer synthase protein may have a long half-life and therefore an acute increase in mRNA may not reflect a comparable increase in protein mass or activity. The half-life of GlcCer synthase protein in vivo is not known. Additional studies are required to address these issues. LPS administration also produced significant increases in the content of several GSLs in the liver. Specifically, the levels of GlcCer, ceramide trihexoside, and ganglioside GM3 were increased by 1.8-, 2.1-, and 3.3-fold, respectively. In contrast, ceramide, the substrate of GlcCer synthase, decreased in the liver following LPS treatment. This LPS-induced decrease in ceramide content in the liver is likely due to the depletion of the ceramide pool secondary to enhanced synthesis of GlcCer and more distal GSLs during the acute phase response. A likely consequence of this increase in GlcCer synthesis in the liver is the increase in lipoprotein GlcCer content that we have reported previously (10Memon R.A. Holleran W.M. Moser A.H. Seki T. Uchida Y. Fuller J. Shigenaga J.K. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The effects of LPS are mediated by its ability to stimulate a variety of immune cells that increase the synthesis and secretion of a multitude of cytokines, peptides, and lipid mediators of inflammation (31Bone R.C. Ann. Intern. Med. 1991; 115: 457-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). The interaction of immune cells with LPS is facilitated by a specific LPS-binding protein (32Su G.L. Freeswick P.D. Geller D.A. Wang Q. Shapiro R.A. Wan Y.H. Billiar T.R. Tweardy D.J. Simmons R.L. Wang S.C. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 743-752PubMed Google Scholar). LPS-binding protein binds with a high affinity to the to the lipid portion of LPS and then interacts with the monocyte differentiation antigen CD14 to up-regulate the synthesis of several cytokines including TNF-α and IL-1β (33Su G.L. Simmons R.L. Wang S.C. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 15: 201-214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The stimulation of acute phase protein synthesis and the changes in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism during infection and inflammation are not direct actions of LPS on the liver; rather the hepatic effects are now known to be mediated by cytokines (34Koj A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1317: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that TNF-α and IL-1β increase serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels, stimulate hepatic lipogenesis, and enhance VLDL production (35Feingold K.R. Soued M. Serio M.K. Moser A.H. Dinarello C.A. Grunfeld C. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar,36Feingold K.R. Soued M. Adi S. Staprans I. Neese R. Shigenaga J. Doerrler W. Moser A.H. Dinarello C.A. Grunfeld C. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 495-500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, both TNF-α and IL-1β decrease fatty acid oxidation and ketone body production in the liver (37Memon R.A. Feingold K.R. Moser A.H. Doerrler W. Adi A. Dinarello C.A. Grunfeld C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E301-E309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have also shown that anti-TNF antibodies or IL-1 receptor antagonist block the effects of LPS on triglyceride and cholesterol metabolism (38Memon R.A. Grunfeld C. Moser A.H. Feingold K.R. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2246-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), indicating that these cytokines mediate the metabolic effects of LPS. In the present study, we demonstrate that like LPS, both TNF-α and IL-1β increase GlcCer synthase mRNA levels in vivo. Moreover, both TNF-α and IL-1β increased GlcCer synthase mRNA levels in HepG2 cells, suggesting that cytokines mediators of acute phase response can directly affect hepatocyte GlcCer synthase. It is believed that changes in the production of specific proteins during the acute phase play an important homeostatic role in the host response to infection, inflammation, and trauma (39Kushner I.

For example, increases in both C-reactive protein and complement 3 during the acute phase response may help in the opsonization of bacteria, immune complexes, and foreign particles (39Kushner I. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1991; 2: 75-80PubMed Google Scholar, 40Richards C. Gauldie J. Baumann H. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1991; 2: 89-98PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, an increase in serum amyloid A during the acute phase response has been shown to redirect the metabolism of HDL from hepatocytes toward macrophages at the site of inflammation (41Kisilevsky R. Subrahamanyan L. Lab. Invest. 1992; 66: 778-785PubMed Google Scholar). We have postulated that the changes in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism that occur during the host response to infection and inflammation may also be beneficial (7Hardardottir I. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 42Hardardottir I. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For example, elevations in serum lipoprotein levels may enhance neutralization of LPS, lipoteichoic acid (a component of the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria which is analogous to LPS), and viruses (7Hardardottir I.

Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 245-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, alterations in lipid metabolism in the liver and other tissues may allow for the redistribution of nutrients to support the increased energy needs of cells that are involved in host defense and tissue repair such as macrophages and lymphocytes (7Hardardottir I. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 42Hardardottir I. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The precise role that the increases in intrahepatic or lipoprotein GSLs (Ref. 10Memon R.A. Holleran W.M. Moser A.H. Seki T. Uchida Y. Fuller J. Shigenaga J.K. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholarand the present study) might have during the acute phase response is not clear at this time. However, GSLs have been implicated in the growth of lymphocytes and other cells. For example, Platt et al. (44Platt F.M. Reinkensmeier G. Dwek R.A. Butters T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19365-19372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), using an inhibitor of GlcCer synthase, reduced GSL levels in mice by 50–70% in liver and lymphoid tissue. The GSL-depleted mice grew more slowly, but otherwise did not appear grossly abnormal. Examination of lymphoid tissue, spleen, and thymus revealed that these organs were reduced in size by 50% due to a decrease in cell numbers (44Platt F.M. Reinkensmeier G. Dwek R.A. Butters T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19365-19372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). More recent studies have shown that natural killer T lymphocytes express a T cell antigen receptor that recognizes GSLs as the ligand and GSLs stimulate the proliferation of natural killer T cells (45Kawano T. Cui J. Koezuka Y. Toura I. Kaneko Y. Motoki K. Ueno H. Nakagawa R. Sato H. Kondo E. Koseki H. Taniguchi M. Science. 1997; 278: 1626-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (2149) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the increase in GlcCer synthase activity and the production of GSLs during the acute phase response plays a role in the immune response. In addition to stimulating proliferation of T lymphocytes (45Kawano T. Cui J. Koezuka Y. Toura I. Kaneko Y. Motoki K. Ueno H. Nakagawa R. Sato H. Kondo E. Koseki H. Taniguchi M. Science. 1997; 278: 1626-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (2149) Google Scholar), GlcCer also stimulate the proliferation of other cell types and tissues (46Shayman J.A. Deshmukh G.D. Mahdiyoun S.

J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2903-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Conversely, a mutant B16 melanoma cell line (GM-95) that lacks GlcCer synthase activity has a slower growth rate and altered cell morphology as compared with the parental cells (50Ichikawa S. Nakajo N. Sakiyama H. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2703-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), suggesting that GlcCer may be required for normal cell growth. Inhibition of GlcCer synthase activity also has been shown to decrease the renal hypertrophy that occurs in diabetic animals (51Zador I.Z. Deshmukh G.D. Kunkel R. Johnson K. Radin N.S. Shayman R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and to decrease renal cell proliferation in vitro (52El-Khatib M. Radin N.S. Shayman J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F476-F484PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, inhibition of GlcCer synthase activity decreases keratinocyte proliferation (53Takami Y. Abe A. Matsuda T. Shayman J.A. Radin N.S. Walter R.J. J. Dermatol. 1998; 25: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, the increase in tissue GSLs during the acute phase response reported here may play a role in regulating cellular proliferation. Finally, the increase in hepatic GlcCer synthase activity and enhanced synthesis of GSLs in liver could result in the secretion of lipoproteins that are enriched in GSLs. We have shown recently that the content of GlcCer is increased in circulating lipoproteins during the acute phase response (10Memon R.A. Holleran W.M. Moser A.H. Seki T. Uchida Y. Fuller J. Shigenaga J.K. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The effect of increased glycosphingolipid content on lipoprotein function is not known. Since cell membrane GSLs are exploited as receptors by a number of microorganisms, including bacteria and viruses (54Karlsson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 309-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), it is possible that lipoproteins enriched in GSLs might play a protective role by either binding to microorganisms or by interfering with their binding to the cells. In summary, the present study demonstrates that hepatic GlcCer synthase activity and mRNA levels are acutely increased during LPS and cytokine-induced acute phase response. Coupled with our previously described increase in the hepatic SPT activity and mRNA levels, these changes would allow for the increased hepatic synthesis of GSLs and higher glycosphingolipid content in lipoproteins during the acute phase response."

We have investigated the role that human immunodeficiency virus-1 RT residues in the αH and αI helices in the thumb subdomain play in specific RNase H cleavage at the 3′-end of the PPT; an in vitro assay modeling the primer removal step was used. Analysis of alanine-scanning mutants revealed that a subgroup exhibits an unusual phenotype in which the PPT is cleaved up to seven bases from its 3′-end. Further analysis of αH mutants (G262A, K263A, N265A, and W266A) with changes in residues in or near a structural motif known as the minor groove binding track showed that the RNase H activity of these mutants is more dramatically affected with PPT substrates than with non-PPT substrates. Vertical scan mutants at position 266 were all defective in specific RNase H cleavage, consistent with conservation of tryptophan at this position among lentiviral RTs. Our results indicate that residues in the thumb subdomain and the minor groove binding track in particular, are crucial for unique interactions between RT and the PPT required for correct positioning and precise RNase H cleavage.

Why the PPT sequence is selected from all of the other available primers has been the subject of much speculation.One possibility is that the PPT sequence is intrinsically resistant to RNase H degradation and therefore survives as the sole RNA primer available for plus-strand initiation.

The MuLV PPT can also be internally cleaved by the isolated RNase H domain from MuLV RT; furthermore, the specificity of cleavage at the 3′-end of the PPT is lost when the polymerase domain is removed (18Schultz S.J.

Virol. 1996; 70: 5288-5296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Fedoroff O.Y. Ge Y. Reid B.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and the shape and width of the major groove, which is wider than that of other RNA-DNA hybrids (20Fedoroff O.Y. Ge Y. Reid B.R. J.

These structural factors could cause binding of RT to the PPT sequence to differ from the way RT binds to other primer-templates (P/T), thereby precluding cleavage within the PPT. Binding of RT to short RNA primers annealed to longer DNA templates has been suggested to occur through interaction of the polymerase active site with the 5′-end of the RNA (Fig. 1, IA; Ref. 22DeStefano J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3901-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar; for a review, see Ref. 23Hughes S.H. Hostomsky Z. Le Grice S.F.J. Lentz K. Arnold E. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2679-2683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this binding configuration, RNase H cleavage can occur; however, polymerization cannot. Interaction with the polymerase domain will direct RNase H cleavage to a site 14–18 nucleotides (nt) from the bound 5′-end, (14–18 nt being the distance between the polymerase and RNase H active sites (17Guo J.

These conclusions also imply that RT interacts with the PPT in a highly specific manner and that the polymerase domain is mainly responsible for this specificity.In HIV-1 RT, two regions within the p66 subunit contribute substantially to the binding and positioning of the P/T (28Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The first region, known as the “primer grip,” comprises residues in the β12-β13 hairpin in the palm subdomain (Fig.2; Ref. 28Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C.

As we demonstrated earlier, primer grip mutations have a profound effect on the ability of RT to extend the PPT and minus-strand RNA primers but little or no effect on the extension of DNA versions of the same primers (37Ghosh M.

The polymerase active site carboxylates (Asp110, Asp185, and Asp186) are illustrated in a ball-and-stick representation and denote the 3′ primer terminus. Primer grip residues are located in the loop between β-strands 12 and 13. The core residues of the αH helix (Gly262, Lys263, Asn265, and Trp266) are indicated.

This motif, termed the minor groove binding track (MGBT), interacts in the minor groove over a distance from the second to sixth base pair from the 3′ terminus of the primer (43Bebenek K. Beard W.A.

More recently, analysis of the x-ray crystal structure of a covalently trapped catalytic complex showed that site-specific cysteine mutations introduced into α-helix H residues Gln258, Gly262, and Trp266 could form specific cross-links with a single tethered thiol group placed in the minor groove of the bound double-stranded DNA substrate (44Huang H.

In contrast, a number of αH mutants, and especially G262A and W266A in the MGBT, exhibited lower binding affinity, processivity, and frameshift fidelity (43Bebenek K. Beard W.A. Darden T.A. Li L.

A detailed investigation of mutants with substitutions other than alanine for Trp266 indicated that there is a strong correlation between buried apolar side-chain surface area and quantitative changes in P/T binding; it was suggested that both hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding contribute to the stability of the RT-DNA complex (48Beard W.A.

Other studies have shown that mutations in the thumb subdomain can have a dramatic effect on the polymerase, RNase H, and minus-strand DNA transfer activities of HIV-1 RT (15Gao H.-Q. Boyer P.L. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 559-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). RNase H assays with HIV-1 PPT-containing substrates consisting of a short DNA primer annealed to a longer RNA template revealed that the cleavage activities of wild-type (WT) RT and two αH mutants, W266T and G262A, differ, indicating that mutations in the thumb subdomain can affect the efficiency and specificity of RNase H cleavage (15Gao H.-Q. Boyer P.L. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 559-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).In the present study, we have continued our analysis of alanine-scanning mutations in α-helices H and I but have changed the focus of our investigation from polymerase activity to RNase H cleavage. Our goal was to determine the effect that these mutations might have on positioning of the RNase H domain for correct removal of the PPT primer from nascent plus-strand DNA. We find that individual alanine substitutions at multiple positions in the αH and αI helices, as well as the alternate substitutions at position 266, result in a loss of cleavage specificity with PPT-containing substrates. Further, the effects appear to be specific for PPT cleavage rather than more general RNase H-catalyzed cleavage.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have investigated the role that residues in the αH and αI helices in the HIV-1 RT thumb subdomain play in positioning the bound P/T for correct removal of the PPT. Precise recognition and cleavage of the PPT is a crucial event in retrovirus replication and ultimately defines one end of proviral DNA (for reviews, see Refs. 6Champoux J.J. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P.

An in vitro assay was used that makes it possible to look specifically at PPT primer removal without regard to the polymerase activity of each enzyme (Fig. 3; Ref. 38Powell M.D. Ghosh M. Jacques P.S.

The results of this study are not directly comparable with ours, since the substrates used were quite different; in their case, a 20-nt DNA primer, consisting of sequences including or near the PPT, was annealed to an 81-nt RNA template. In this configuration, RNase H cleavage is dictated by the 3′ terminus of the DNA primer (13Wöhrl B.M. Moelling K.

By contrast, the PPT-containing substrates employed here were all short RNA primers annealed to a longer DNA template and were similar to intermediates expected to form during the course of reverse transcription. Thus, the types of cleavage patterns generated in the two studies are qualitatively different. Nevertheless, despite these differences, the overall conclusion of both studies is the same, namely that mutations in αH affect the specificity of RNase H cleavage. Interestingly, based on assays with RTs having the W266T mutation in either the p66 or p51 subunit, Gao et al. (15Gao H.-Q. Boyer P.L. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 559-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) also concluded that the thumb subdomains in both subunits play an important role in the selectivity, specificity, and efficiency of RNase H cleavage.The mutant RTs analyzed here were extensively characterized in related work that focused on efforts to understand how the αH and αI residues contribute to DNA polymerase activity (45Beard W.A.

Functional studies performed in conjunction with molecular dynamics modeling led to identification of the highly conserved MGBT structural motif, which contains three residues in αH, including Gly262 and Trp266, and is important for P/T binding, processive DNA synthesis, and frameshift fidelity (43Bebenek K.

These results imply that αH residues play a role in positioning the P/T prior to incorporation of an incoming dNTP. Since the polymerase domain is also important for proper cleavage of PPT-containing substrates (15Gao H.-Q. Boyer P.L. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J. Mol.

These enzymes cleave the PPT substrate at multiple positions within the PPT to produce products from 21 to 27 nt in length (Fig. 4, Table I). For this to occur, the 5′ terminus of the PPT must somehow “slip” from its normal binding position (Fig."

Ca2+-free GCAPs are responsible for activation of photoreceptor guanylyl cyclase during light adaptation. In this study, we characterized GCAP1 mutants in which three endogenous nonessential Trp residues were replaced by Phe residues, eliminating intrinsic fluorescence. Subsequently, hydrophobic amino acids adjacent to each of the three functional Ca2+-binding loops were replaced by reporter Trp residues. Using fluorescence spectroscopy and biochemical assays, we found that binding of Ca2+ to GCAP1 causes a major conformational change especially in the region around the EF3-hand motif. This transition of GCAP1 from an activator to an inhibitor of GC requires an activation energyE a = 9.3 kcal/mol. When Tyr99adjacent to the EF3-hand motif was replaced by Cys, a mutation linked to autosomal dominant cone dystrophy in humans, Cys99 is unable to stabilize the inactive GCAP1-Ca2+ complex. Stopped-flow kinetic measurements indicated that GCAP1 rapidly loses its bound Ca2+ (k −1 = 72 s−1 at 37 °C) and was estimated to associate with Ca2+ at a rate (k 1 > 2 × 108m−1 s−1) close to the diffusion limit.

EF-hand motifs, reliably predictable based on primary sequence and present in one to eight copies in some polypeptides, have been identified in over 500 Ca2+-binding proteins. Neuronal Ca2+-binding proteins (NCBPs)1 are a subset of the EF-hand-containing proteins that are found predominantly in neurons. The function of most of these proteins is largely unknown. The topography of NCBPs is based on four EF-hand motifs, some of which may be functional and some nonfunctional in Ca2+ coordination (2Polans A. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Trends. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 547-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The sequence similarity among members of the NCBP family varies from ∼25% between calmodulin (CaM) and visinin to ∼60% between GCAP1 and GCAP3 (3Haeseleer F. Sokal I. Li N. Pettenati M. Rao P.N.

NCBPs are acidic and similar in length, with CaM and CaM-like proteins being the shortest (149–150 amino acids;M r 16,837), and other members of this family being ∼200 amino acids in length (M r∼23,000) (2Polans A.

Recently, we have identified a fourth photoreceptor Ca2+-binding protein closely related to GCAPs (8Li N. Fariss R.N. Zhang K. Otto-Bruc A. Haeseleer F. Bronson J.D. Qin N. Yamazaki A. Subbaraya I.

This novel protein does not stimulate GC at nanomolar [Ca2+], but inhibits GC at micromolar [Ca2+], and is therefore termed guanylyl cyclase inhibitory protein. A defect in exon 3 of the GCAP1 gene leading to a Y99C missense mutation has recently been linked to autosomal dominant cone dystrophy (9Payne A.M. Downes S.M. Bessant D.A. Taylor R. Holder G.E.

Multiple EF-hand motifs may allow the Ca2+-binding protein to respond cooperatively to changes in [Ca2+]. The three-dimensional structures of NCBPs are known for both Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound CaM and recoverin (13Flaherty K.M. Zozulya S. Stryer L. McKay D.B.

Kumar V.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). GCAP2, recoverin, and neurocalcin are compact proteins (radius of gyration 16–18 Å) made of two domains separated by a variable linker and are different from a dumbbell arrangement found in CaM and troponin C (reviewed in Ref. 17Crivici A. Ikura M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). The N- and C-terminal domains of NCBPs contain a pair of EF-hands each composed of 29 amino acids. Whereas structural studies give precise answers on conformational changes upon Ca2+ chelation, much less is known about the dynamics of individual EF-hand motifs during this transition. Ca2+(occasionally also Mg2+) is coordinated via oxygen atoms typically located on a consecutive sequence of 12 amino acids of the loop within helix-loop-helix structure (18Kretsinger R.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1976; 45: 239-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Importantly, the −1 positions of the EF-hand loops are most frequently occupied by a large hydrophobic amino acid (Ile, Leu, Val, Trp, Tyr, and Phe) (19Falke J.J. Drake S.K. Hazard A.L. Peersen O.B. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1994; 27: 219-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). This unique position close to the EF-hand loop allows substitution by Trp without major disruption of conformation. Trp fluorescence techniques can then be used to monitor contributions of individual loops to conformational changes that occur during Ca2+coordination. In this study we used Trp-GCAP1 mutants to identify conformational changes in GCAP1 from the Ca2+-bound to the Ca2+-free form. We asked what role do the endogenous Trp residues play in the function of GCAP1, particularly in its conformational changes coupled to Ca2+ binding and switching from activator to inhibitor of GC? Can functional protein variants be produced that provide spectroscopic signals specifically coupled to individual Ca2+-binding sites? If so, what are the contributions of each of these binding sites to the functionally important conformational changes? What are the kinetics of Ca2+ binding and release and associated conformational and functional switching? We found that Ca2+ binding at the EF3-hand motif evokes the largest conformational change, compared with other EF-hand motifs. Thus, EF3-hand region may act as a molecular [Ca2+] switch between activating or inhibiting GC conformations. These findings provide mechanistic insights on how the mutation GCAP1(Y99C) is linked to autosomal dominant cone dystrophy. The three mutants, GCAP1(W21F), GCAP1(W51F), and GCAP1(W94F) were generated by inserting mutant cassettes into wild-type pVL941bGCAP1 expressing GCAP1 in insect cells. For GCAP1(W21F), sense primer T1 (5′-AGC AGC ACC GAG TGC CAC CAG TTC TAC AAG) carrying a DraIII site (underlined) and the TGG to TTC mutation and antisense primer W233A (5′-CCA GTG AAA CAG CAG GCA CCA CCG TAC ACA C) were used to amplify the mutant GCAP1 product with pVL941bGCAP1 as template (2 ng/50 μl PCR mixture, 100 ng of each primer). Standard concentrations of MgCl2 and dNTP and regular Taq polymerase (Promega) were used. PCR conditions were 94 °C for 1 min, 69 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min, cycled 35 times. The product of 638 bp was purified (Qiagen) and digested withDraIII at 37 °C for 1 h and then SfiI was added and restriction continued for an additional hour at 50 °C. For ligation, pVL941bGCAP1 was digested with DraIII andSfiI. For generation of GCAP1(W51F), sense primer T2 (5′-CTC CCG CAG GCC TGA GCG ATG) and antisense primer T2 (5′-GCT CCA CGT ACT GGC TGG CGA ACG GGC TCA) were used to amplify a 188-bp PCR product. For ligation, pVL941bGCAP1 was digested withPrmI/StuI for 4 h at 37 °C. For generation of GCAP1(W94F), the intrinsic AlwNI site in pVL941 had to be deleted first. Briefly, pVL941 was linearized by digestion with AlwNI, blunt-ended, and re-ligated. Then bGCAP1 in pBluescript-SK was digested withEcoRI/XhoI and the fragment introduced into pVL941(AlwNI−) and digested with the same enzymes. A 418-bp PCR product was amplified with sense primer T3 (5′-TGG AAC AGA AGC TGC GTT TCT ACT TCA-3′) (carrying the mutation) and antisense primer W233A. The PCR product and vector pVL941bGCAP1(AlwNI−) were cut withAlwNI at 37 °C and then SfiI at 50 °C. To isolate the mutant constructs, mutant PCR cassettes were ligated (T4 ligase at 16 °C for 12 h) to the corresponding vectors from which the nonmutant product had been removed by gel electrophoresis. The ligation mixture was transformed in XL1-Blue competent cells. Clones and DNA samples were isolated by standard procedures, and inserts were completely sequenced. DNA vectors containing the correct mutation in GCAP1 were purified using CsCl centrifugation, verified by sequencing, and transfected into HighFive insect cells (PharMingen). To obtain this construct, first, a double mutant GCAP1(W21F,W51F) fragment was generated. T1 sense and W233A antisense primers were used to generate a mutant fragment by PCR on pVL941bGCAP1(W51F) as template (see description for W21F). The resulting 650-bp PCR product carrying W21F and W51F mutations was ligated into a vector carrying the W94F mutation. The vector pVL941bGCAP1(W94F) was treated with AlwNI andDraIII, and a 335-bp piece was excised and replaced by the (W21F,W51F) fragment. Ligations, transformations, sequencing, and transfections were performed as described above."

This different behavior has been proposed to depend on specific conformational features at the region that connects the globular domain of the pro-segment to the enzyme and at the contacting surfaces on both moieties. A cDNA coding for porcine procarboxypeptidase B was cloned, sequenced, and expressed at high yield (250 mg/liter) in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. To test the previous hypothesis, different mutants of the pro-segment at the putative tryptic targets in its connecting region and at some of the residues contacting the active enzyme were obtained. Moreover, the complete connecting region was replaced by the homologous sequence in procarboxypeptidase A1. The detailed study of the tryptic processing of the mutants shows that limited proteolysis of procarboxypeptidase B is a very specific process, as Arg-95 is the only residue accessible to tryptic attack in the proenzyme. A fast destabilization of the connecting region after the first tryptic cut allows subsequent proteolytic processing and the expression of carboxypeptidase B activity. Although all pancreatic procarboxypeptidases have a preformed active site, only the A forms show intrinsic activity. Mutational substitution of Asp-41 in the globular activation domain, located at the interface with the enzyme moiety, as well as removal of the adjacent 310 helix allow the appearance of residual activity in the mutated procarboxypeptidase B, indicating that the interaction of both structural elements with the enzyme moiety prevents the binding of substrates and promotes enzyme inhibition. In addition, the poor heterologous expression of such mutants indicates that the mutated region is important for the folding of the whole proenzyme.

Two general types of carboxypeptidases can be distinguished: carboxypeptidase A with a preference for apolar C-terminal residues and carboxypeptidase B (CPB),1 which displays a preference for C-terminal Lys or Arg residues. Isomorphism has also been found in human and rat tissues within the A forms, yielding CPA1 (assignable to the traditional A form) and CPA2, which is more specific for aromatic residues (4Gardell S.J.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 7-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Carboxypeptidases are secreted from pancreatic acinar cells as zymogens that are activated by trypsin in the small intestine. In porcine pancreatic secretions, the two major forms of pro-CPs, pro-CPB and pro-CPA1, are found in the monomeric state, making this system suitable for comparison studies on their activation processes. The length of the N-terminal pro-segments is 94/96 residues in pro-CPA1/pro-CPA2, spanning over 1/4 of the proenzyme. This characteristic differentiates pro-CPs from the rest of digestive zymogens (e.g. trypsinogens or proelastases) with shorter activation pro-regions (8Khan A.R. James M.N. Protein Sci. 1998; 4: 815-836Crossref Scopus (378) Google Scholar) and suggests that the conformational elements in their pro-segments pack in an independent globular folding unit that determines the inhibition and activation processes of these zymogens (3Avilés F.X.

Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 149-155Google Scholar). The detailed three-dimensional structures of monomeric pro-CPB (porcine), pro-CPA1 (porcine), and pro-CPA2 (human) have been deduced from crystallographic studies (10Coll M. Guasch A. Avilés F.X.

Billeter M. Wider G. Avilés F.X. Wüthrich K. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These studies show that conformational similarities between the 94/95 activation segments of the A1 and B forms are high despite the fact that their sequence identities reach only 32% (14Burgos F.J. Salvà M. Villegas V. Soriano F. Méndez E. Avilés F.X. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4092-4099Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, important local differences in the secondary structures of the individual pro-segments are found that may account for their different inhibitory capacity and behavior upon activation. The activation processes of porcine pancreatic pro-CPA1 and pro-CPB natural forms have been studied in detail (14Burgos F.J. Salvà M. Villegas V. Soriano F. Méndez E. Avilés F.X.

Both proenzymes are activated by the proteolytic cleavage of trypsin, which initially gives rise to the scissioned pro-segment and enzyme moieties. However, the generation of activity is much faster in pro-CPB than in pro-CPA1. On the other hand, intact pro-CPB is absolutely devoid of enzymatic activity, whereas pro-CPA1 is able to catalyze the hydrolysis of small synthetic peptides (17Lacko A.G. Neurath H. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 4680-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 18Reeck G.R. Neurath H. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3947-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), a fact that indicates a different degree of coverage of the active center in both forms. In this work, the cDNA coding for porcine pro-CPB has been cloned and overexpressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris, yielding large quantities of fully activable wild-type proenzyme. We describe the construction and production of site-directed mutants of porcine pro-CPB in which different residues or complete regions of the pro-segment were changed. The detailed study of the mutants allowed us to evaluate the relevance of the putative tryptic targets and to interpret the role of a number of contacts between the pro-segment and the enzyme in the maintenance of the inhibited state. From this work, the structural/functional relationships in the activation/inhibition mechanisms of pancreatic procarboxypeptidases B may be defined in detail. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase,Taq polymerase, deoxyribonucleotide stocks, and synthetic oligonucleotides were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Vent DNA polymerase was purchased from New England Biolabs. Salts and mediums for Escherichia coli and P. pastoris were purchased from Difco. The P. pastoris strains and vectors were obtained from Phillips Petroleum and Invitrogen. Trypsin (treated with tosyl-l-phenyl chloromethyl ketone) was from Worthington.N α -p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone and benzoylglycyl-l-arginine (BGA) were from Sigma. Total RNA was isolated from the pancreas of young pigs by a modified acid phenol-guanidinium thiocyanate-chloroform method (19Puissant C. Houdebine L.M. Biotechniques. 1990; 8: 148-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mRNA was isolated with the mRNA isolation kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The cDNAs for CPB and pro-CPB were synthesized from porcine pancreatic mRNA using the Uni-Zap library kit from Stratagene. The N-terminal amino acid and C-terminal amino acid sequences were determined from purified porcine pro-CPB and CPB in the LRL Protein Technology Laboratory. The cDNA was PCR-amplified using degenerate primers designed from the C-terminal amino acid sequence of CPB and the N-terminal amino acid sequences of pro-CPB, respectively. Cloning the PCR-amplified cDNAs into the vector pCR1000 (from Invitrogen) provided DNA fragments containing 975 bp for CPB and 1260 bp for pro-CPB. The 5′ end of the cDNA was cloned using 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) (20Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 85: 8998-9002Crossref Scopus (4329) Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequences were determined in the LRL Biotechnology Core Laboratory. Consensus nucleotide sequences were identified by comparing the sequences of multiple independent clones to eliminate sequence errors that may have been introduced during PCR. Unique restriction sites, which introduced silent base pair substitutions, were strategically placed in the consensus sequence by PCR mutagenesis near the 5′ end of the sequence, the 3′ end of the sequence, and flanking the junction between the sequence coding for the propeptide and the mature enzyme by overlap extension mutagenesis (21Ho N.S. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6812) Google Scholar) to facilitate site-directed mutagenesis. Mutated DNA sequences were always confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. The plasmid, pHDM208, contained the modified cDNA sequence. The pre-pro α-mating factor (α-MF) was excised from vector pPIC9 byBamHI/XhoI restriction, and the pro-CPB gene in the pHDM208 vector was obtained after SfuI/BamHI restriction. The two pieces were ligated by using aXhoI/SfuI 30-bp synthetic linker that completes the 3′ end of pre-pro α-MF and the 5′ end of pro-CPB. The resulting 1540-bp pre-pro α-MF-pro-CPB fragment was cloned into theBamHI site of pBluescript SK to give the pBlue-pro-CPB vector, used for mutagenesis, and into the BamHI site of pPIC3.5 to obtain pPIC-pro-CPB, used for expression of the wild-type pro-CPB. The different junctions were confirmed by sequencing on an automated DNA sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Using pBlue-pro-CPB as a template, site-specific mutations were introduced by a two-step PCR mutagenesis procedure using 5′-GGA GCA TTT CGA AGG GAA AAG GTG TTC CGT GTC as sense external primer (a silent Asp-700 site elimination serves for recombinant screening) and 5′-TC TCT CAC AAA CCA CTG GCA AAA TGC ATG CAT GGG AAA T as antisense external primer. Internal primers were designed to contain the single or double mutations that follow: R93Q, R95Q, R93Q/R95Q, Q89E, R83Q, D41N, and D41A. The internal primers for the Val-43–Ile-46 deletion were: sense, 5′-CCA GAT TCT AAA CCT CAC AGT ACA GTT GAC TTC; antisense, 5′-TTA ACT GAA GAC CTT TGG TCT AAG TTT GGA GTG. The different resulting DNA fragments containing the pre-pro α-MF plus the mutated pro-CPB were cloned into the BamHI site of pPIC3.5 to obtain pPIC-M1 to M8. All the constructs were confirmed by sequencing on an automated DNA sequencer. To substitute the Gln-89–Val-94 region of porcine pro-CPB for the corresponding one in porcine pro-CPA1, a 73-bp XhoI/PvuI fragment was excised from pBlue-pro-CPB and replaced by a synthetic linker obtained after the annealing of the following 85-bp oligonucleotide 5′-TC GAG GCTGAG CAG GAG CAG ATG TTT GCC AGCCAG GGC CGT ACA ACT GGA CAC AGT TAT GAG AAG TAC AAC AAC TGG GAA ACG AT and the complementary strand designed to recover the restriction sites in both ends. The mutated pro-CPB was cloned into the pPIC3.5 as above to obtain pPIC-M9. The junctions were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. The pPIC-pro-CPB and the different expression vectors containing the mutated pro-CPB cDNAs (pPIC-M1 to M9) were linearized bySacI digestion and transformed into P. pastorisKM71 (arg4, his4, aox1::ARG4) strain either by electroporation or by the spheroplast method. Histidine-independent transformants were selected and tested for production of pro-CPB. Colonies were grown in a buffered liquid medium BMGY and BMMY (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 90 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base, 4 × 10−5 % biotin, and either 1% glycerol or 0.5% methanol) using 10-ml test cultures at 30 °C for 5 days. The production of the clones was followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gels. Western blots were performed using 1:2000 anti-porcine pancreatic procarboxypeptidase B antibodies. The functionality of the expressed protein was analyzed with the BGA synthetic substrate after activation of the proenzyme with trypsin (at a 1:1 ratio by weight). pPIC-M8 and pPIC-M9 were also transformed into P. pastoris GS115 (HIS 4), and the clones that integrated by homologous recombination with theaox1 sequence were selected. The production of pro-CPB was tested as described above but using MM (90 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base, 4 × 10−5 % biotin, and 0.5% methanol) as induction medium. One-liter shake-flask cultures were grown for 3 days in buffered glycerol medium BMGY (15–20 OD units at 600 nm). Cells were collected by centrifugation at 1500 g and gently resuspended in 200 ml of a methanol-containing medium, BMMY, cultured for another 2 days to induce the production of pro-CPB. The supernatant was loaded onto a hydrophobic interaction butyl column and eluted with a decreasing gradient of ammonium sulfate. The zymogen-containing fractions were selected for their activity against BGA after tryptic activation and re-purified by fast protein liquid chromatography on an anion exchange column (TSK-DEAE) as reported previously (16Villegas V. Vendrell J. Avilés F.X. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1792-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The correct processing of the different recombinant proteins was confirmed by both automated Edman degradation analysis of its N-terminal sequence and mass spectrometry. The mutants for Val-43–Ile-46 deletion and Gln-89–Val-94 pro-CPB/pro-CPA1 substitution were induced in 200 ml of methanol minimum medium. The culture medium was dialyzed against the activation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 μmZnCl2, pH 7.5) and concentrated to 0.2 ml by ultrafiltration (Amicon). The recombinant proenzymes at 1 mg/ml in activation buffer were treated with trypsin at a 4/1 or 400/1 ratio (w/w) at 0 or 25 °C. At given times after trypsin addition, aliquots were removed for activity measurements for electrophoretic, reversed-phase HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis and for the quantitation of the released amino acids. For activity measurements, 10 μl of the activation mixture were mixed with 190 μl of aprotinin at 0.1 mg/ml in 20 mmTris, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.5, and 10 μl of this new mixture were used to carry out spectrophotometric activity measurements with BGA at 254 nm. For electrophoretic analysis 20 μl of the activation mixture were mixed with 2 μl ofN α -p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone at 22 mm in water to reach a final trypsin inhibitor concentration of 2 mm. Each sample was immediately mixed with electrophoretic loading buffer (containing 1% SDS and 3% β-mercaptoethanol), heated at 90 °C for 1 min, and stored at −20 °C until analyzed. Electrophoresis was carried out in polyacrylamide Tricine gels (22Schägger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10460) Google Scholar). For HPLC and mass spectrometry analyses, 90-μl samples were removed from the activation mixture, adjusted to 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid to inhibit proteolysis, and immediately chromatographed or kept at −20 °C for subsequent analysis. For the quantitation of the amino acids released into the activation mixture, 90-μl samples were taken (2 nmols of initial pro-CPB) and mixed with trifluoroacetic acid to give a final concentration of 0.5%. Then 1.5 nmols of norleucine were added as quantitative reference before the addition of 3 volumes of ethanol to precipitate proteins and large peptides. The supernatant was lyophilized and analyzed for amino acid composition. The mutants for the Val-43–Ile-46 deletion and the Gln-89–Val-94 pro-CPB/pro-CPA1 substitution, together with the wild-type zymogen as a control, were taken to 50 ng/ml in activation buffer, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and treated with trypsin at a 400/1 ratio (w/w) at 0 °C. At given times after trypsin addition, aliquots were removed for electrophoresis as described above, analyzed by Western blotting, and developed with 1:2000 anti-porcine pancreatic procarboxypeptidase B antibodies. Samples removed from the activation mixtures were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC on Vydac C4 supports. A 214TP54 column, 250 × 4.6 mm, 5-μm particle size, 0.3-μm pore was used, and chromatographies were performed in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid with a linear elution gradient between water (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B), according to the following steps: 10% B from 0 to 10 min and 52% B at 130 min. The activation mixture and HPLC-purified fragments were analyzed by mass spectrometry using a MALDI-TOF spectrometer (Biflex with reflectron, from Bruker) using 50% synapinic acid as a matrix for pro-CPB, CPB, and long activation fragments and 50% α-cyano 4-cinnamic acid for short fragments. Amino acid analyses were carried out by the dabsyl-derivatization method (23Vendrell J. Avilés F.X. J. Chromatogr. 1986; 358: 401-413Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar) using protocols and materials from Beckman. A reversed phase HPLC NovaPak C18 column was used to separate the amino acids produced during the tryptic activation. Proenzymes and derived proteolytic fragments were analyzed for N-terminal sequences on a Beckman LF3000 protein sequencer using an automated Edman degradation approach after purification by fast protein liquid chromatography or RP-HPLC. Large fragments, such as the mature enzyme, were sometimes sequenced after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The consensus cDNA sequence of pro-CPB was cloned into pHDM147 to generate a plasmid designated pHDM208. Fig. 1 contains the consensus coding sequence for pre-pro-CPB and the amino acid sequence inferred by translating the coding sequence. The first 15 amino acids suggest a hydrophobic signal peptide, although the sequence lacks the characteristic positively charged amino acid near the N terminus of a signal peptide. The amino acid sequence of the pro-peptide agrees with the published pro-peptide amino acid sequence (14Burgos F.J. Salvà M. Villegas V. Soriano F. Méndez E. Avilés F.X. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4092-4099Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The inferred sequence was further tested by comparing to properties of natural CPB and pro-CPB. The proteins purified from the natural source were analyzed in the LRL Protein Technology Core Laboratory by cyanogen bromide fragmentation, and determination of molecular weights was by mass spectrometry of the intact proteins and the cyanogen bromide fragments. Predictions from the inferred sequence agreed with the results obtained with the natural proteins and supported the accuracy of the cDNA sequence. 2Raymond Kaiser, personal communication. Comparison of the porcine amino acid sequence with the amino acid sequence of human pro-CPB shows 83.5% identity and 89% similarity between the two proteins. A DNA encoding the yeast-specific secretion signal of Saccharomyces cerevisiae α-MF pre-pro-signal sequence was attached in-frame to the 1260-bp DNA encoding porcine pro-CPB and incorporated into the BamHI site of pPIC3.5P. pastoris vector to generate pPIC3.5-pro-CPB. The recombinant plasmid was linearized by SacI digestion and used to transform the KM71 (arg4, his4, aox1::ARG4) P. pastoris strain by electroporation. Transformed cells were screened for pro-CPB secretion, and the selected clones were used for large scale productions of pro-CPB. The cells were first grown in the presence of glycerol and then switched to methanol (1%) as the carbon source to induce expression of pro-CPB. The secreted proenzyme (250 mg/liter) represents more than 90% of the protein in the culture medium, as shown by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It should be mentioned here that previous expression assays of pro-CPB and mature CPB in E. coli rendered only insoluble and inactive enzyme. Starting from 150 ml of culture medium, the two-step chromatographic method used to purify recombinant pancreatic pro-CPB normally yielded 30 mg of purified pro-CPB. The protein was shown to be correctly processed upon secretion by N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. The apparent mass for the recombinant protein as analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was 45,817 Da (expected size for porcine pancreatic pro-CPB: 45,836 Da), confirming the integrity and the identity of the expressed product. As expected, recombinant wild-type pro-CPB (wt-pro-CPB) was absolutely devoid of intrinsic activity (see further in text), being the enzyme region completely inhibited by its pro-segment. The recombinant pro-CPB was fully activated when incubated at 0 °C and at 400/1 pro-CPB/trypsin (w/w) ratio. The maturation course for recombinant pro-CPB is identical to that previously reported for the natural form isolated from porcine pancreas (16Villegas V. Vendrell J. Avilés F.X. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1792-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A scheme of the proteolytic maturation process is presented in Fig. 2to serve as a reference for discussion of the results that follow. A two-turn α-helix followed by a nonstructured flexible loop connects the globular domain of the pro-segment to the enzyme in pro-CPB (10Coll M. Guasch A. Avilés F.X. Huber R. EMBO J. 1991; 9: 1-9Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This connecting region contains three Arg at positions 83, 93, and 95 (see Fig. 3). Although all of them appear to be solvent-exposed, the first tryptic cleavage of the proteolytic processing of pro-CPB occurs only at Arg-95. This initial cut is followed by the trimming of the pro-segment C-terminal residue by the generated CPB. A second tryptic cleavage occurs at the Arg-83–Ser- 84 bond in the N-terminal region of the α-helix occurs (see Fig. 3). Previous studies have shown that Arg-93 may also act as a primary tryptic target when carboxypeptidase inhibitors are added to the activation mixture (16Villegas V. Vendrell J. Avilés F.X. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1792-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To individualize the effect of the different tryptic targets, different mutants were produced in which the Arg involved in the scissile bond was substituted by Gln: R83Q, R93Q, R95Q, and the double mutant R93Q/R95Q. All of these mutants were expressed at the same level and purified in the same manner that the wt-pro-CPB. No generation of CPB activity was observed when the action of trypsin on the double mutant R93Q/R95Q was tested at 0 °C and at 400/1 pro-CPB/trypsin ratio (standard conditions) nor when the ratio of activating trypsin was increased by 100-fold and the temperature raised to 25 °C. No conversion of pro-CPB into active enzyme was detected by electrophoretic analysis of the incubation mixtures in SDS-Tricine gels, even at long times after trypsin addition (see Fig.4 B). The activability of the single mutant R95Q was assayed to know whether Arg-93 can act as the initial target for proteolytic processing. No carboxypeptidase activity was detectable after trypsin addition in normal conditions, and no pro-CPB into CPB transformation was observed by electrophoresis. The appearance of peptide fragments at low concentration was detected only when the proteolysis was analyzed by RP-HPLC, indicating a slight processing of pro-CPB (less than 0.5% of the initial pro-enzyme). Under stronger proteolytic conditions, i.e. 25 °C and 4/1 pro-CPB/trypsin ratio, Arg-93 can act as a primary tryptic target promoting the appearance of a carboxypeptidase moiety with two additional amino acids (Val-94–Gln-95) at the N terminus, as shown by automated N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the CPB electrophoretic band and by mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) analysis. The 93-residue activation fragment released under those conditions possesses a C-terminal Arg, which is supposed to be quickly removed by the generated CPB. However, when the process was analyzed by RP-HPLC and mass spectrometry, no traces of the 1–92 fragment (F1δ) were detected, even at the shorter activation times used; instead, the products of tryptic action on Arg-83 were present (result not shown). The activation course was monotonic and correlated well with the appearance of mature CPB observed by electrophoretic analysis. Although the generation of CPB activity was very slow when compared with wt-pro-CPB (see Fig. 5 A), it was similar to the rate that was observed for porcine pro-CPA1 (15Vendrell J. Cuchillo C.M. Avilés F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6949-6953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the previous mutant, the substitution of Arg-93 in the single mutant R93Q did not induce differences in the rate of appearance of either carboxypeptidase activity or the CPB molecular species (as evaluated by electrophoresis) when analyzed under standard conditions (not shown). Tryptic treatment of the R83Q single mutant produced a fast and complete CPB activity generation as a result of the cleavage of the bond Arg-95–Thr-1, without being affected by the loss of a secondary tryptic target (see Fig. 5 B). However, at short times after trypsin addition, the time activation course of this mutant was slightly biphasic, as checked in different trials. This behavior is reminiscent of the clearly biphasic activation course of pro-CPA1 (15Vendrell J. Cuchillo C.M. Avilés F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6949-6953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and also correlates with the higher levels of the primary activation segment (1α, 1–95) in the activation mixture (Fig.6). The conversion rate of the pro-CPB mutant into CPB is identical to that of the wt-pro-CPB as analyzed by electrophoresis, but as a consequence of the absence of Arg-83, only long activation fragments were produced (Fig. 4 C). The kinetics of generation and transformation of these fragments was followed by RP-HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis and revealed a progressive C-terminal trimming of the primary activation segment (1–95) that stops at Ser-92 (see Fig. 6). An important contribution to the connecting region/active enzyme interaction forces in pro-CPA1 activation segment is attributed to a strong salt bridge between Glu-89 and Arg-124 of CPA1 (3Avilés F.X. Vendrell J. Guasch A. Coll M. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Both residues are conserved in pro-CPA1 of all the studied species. The equivalent residues in porcine pro-CPB are Gln-89 and Arg-124, which interact through a hydrogen bond. Both residues"

The hydrophilic segments of these membrane proteins, which undergo export, display a characteristic charge profile where intermembrane space-localized segments bear a net negative charge, whereas those remaining in the matrix have a net positive one. Using a model protein, preSu9(1–112)-dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), which undergoes Oxa1p-mediated N-tail export, we demonstrate here that the net charge of N- and C-flanking regions of the transmembrane domain play a critical role in determining the orientation of the insertion process.

Many nuclear-encoded proteins become directly sorted to the inner membrane during the process of import into the mitochondria. A number of inner membrane proteins, however, achieve their correct orientation in the membrane via an insertion step from the matrix side of the membrane. This process involves the export to the intermembrane space of hydrophilic N- or C-terminal tails and often of hydrophilic loop structures between neighboring transmembrane domains. We have focused previously in some depth on the process of export of N-terminal tails of nuclear and mitochondrial-encoded proteins from the matrix into the intermembrane space. This export pathway facilitates the insertion of membrane proteins encoded by the mitochondrial genome as well as a subset of nuclear-encoded proteins. The nuclear-encoded proteins sorted by this export pathway are initially targeted to the mitochondria by N-terminal presequences. These proteins are imported across the inner membrane and into the mitochondrial matrix in a membrane potential (Δψ)- and mt-Hsp70/ATP-dependent fashion. Following maturation by the mitochondrial-processing peptidase (MPP),1 insertion into the inner membrane leading to export of hydrophilic domains to the intermembrane space occurs. Export from the matrix requires a membrane potential (1Herrmann J.M. Koll H. Cook R.A. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol.

Our observations on protein export in mitochondria were reminiscent of previous findings on N-terminal tail export in prokaryotic systems. There, it had been noted that the periplasmic N-tails of bacterial membrane proteins synthesized without leader sequences are exported in a sec-independent manner. These exported domains characteristically do not bear a net positive charge, but rather have a net negative one or are overall uncharged. This was found to be in agreement with the positive-inside rule of prokaryotic membrane protein topology, where positively charged amino acids tend to be more prevalent in the cytoplasmic than periplasmic regions flanking the transmembrane domains (7von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8von Heijne G. Nature. 1989; 341: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 9Boyd D. Beckwith J.

Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 380-383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, introduction of positively charged amino acid residues into the N-tails of these bacterial proteins led to an inhibition of their export from the cytoplasm (12Cao G. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4662-4669Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar,13Whitley P. Zander T. Ehrmann M. Haardt M. Bremer E. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It was previously noted that some proteins of the mitochondrial inner membrane display a charge distribution profile compatible with the “positive-inside rule”; their matrix-exposed segments contain with high frequency positively charged residues, whereas segments exposed to the intermembrane space bear a net negative or neutral charge (14Gavel Y. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 268: 41-46Google Scholar). Indeed, all mitochondrial inner membrane proteins known to be sorted by the Oxa1p export pathway display this characteristic charge distribution profile. Does this charge profile determine the orientation of these proteins in the inner membrane? Does the sorting mechanism of these mitochondrial proteins therefore adhere to the positive-inside rule described for prokaryotes? To study the importance of the charge distribution in the process of mitochondrial N-terminal tail export, we analyzed the sorting of a fusion protein, preSu9(1–112)-DHFR (2Rojo E.E. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3445-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 15Ungermann C. Neupert W. Cyr D.M. Science. 1994; 266: 1250-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). This protein consists of the N-terminal region of subunit 9 from the F1FO-ATPase (Su9) of Neurospora crassa encompassing the presequence and the first half of the mature part of the protein containing a single transmembrane segment. As previously shown, preSu9(1–112)-DHFR is initially imported into the mitochondrial matrix, where it is processed by MPP. The N-tail becomes exported across the inner membrane in a membrane potential and Oxa1p-dependent fashion to give rise to an Nout-Cin topology (2Rojo E.E. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3445-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 6Hell K. Herrmann J.M. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2250-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The exported N-terminal tail of mSu9(1–112)-DHFR bears a net negative charge. We demonstrate here that the nature of the charges flanking the transmembrane segment play a crucial role in determining the orientation the protein attains in the inner membrane. From our data, we conclude that mitochondrial protein export mediated by the Oxa1p machinery adheres to the positive-inside rule described for prokaryotic, sec-independent, protein export. The recombinant DNA techniques applied were essentially as described previously (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The precursor of the nuclear-encodedN. crassa subunit 9 was used in this study. preSu9(1–112)-DHFR (2Rojo E.E. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3445-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 15Ungermann C. Neupert W. Cyr D.M. Science. 1994; 266: 1250-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) mutant derivatives were obtained using a polymerase chain reaction site-directed mutagenesis procedure with one single mutated primer and two wild-type external primers, as described previously (17Perrin S. Gilliland G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7433-7438Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Multiple point mutants were obtained by repeated rounds of mutagenesis. Final polymerase chain reaction products were subcloned in front of DHFR as EcoRI/SacI fragments in pGEM4 vectors and transcribed in vitro with SP6 RNA polymerase. Standard procedures for cell growth (Saccharomyces cerevisiae wild-type, D273-10B) and mitochondrial isolation were used (18Herrmann J.M. Fölsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 1. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 538-544Google Scholar). preSu9(1–112)-DHFR and its mutant derivatives were synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine, as described previously (19Pelham H.R.B. Jackson R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 67: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar). Import was performed as described previously (2Rojo E.E. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3445-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 20Stuart R.A. Gruhler A. van der Klei I. Guiard B. Koll H. Neupert W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Import in the presence EDTA and o-phenanthroline and their subsequent chase by the addition of Mg2+/Mn2+ was performed as described previously (2Rojo E.E. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3445-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Following import, samples were treated when indicated with trypsin (40 μg/ml) for 15 min on ice. This reaction was stopped by the addition of (0.2 mg/ml) soybean trypsin inhibitor. Hypotonic swelling of mitochondria was performed to determine the extent of export of the N-terminal tail of mSu9(1–112)-DHFR (2Rojo E.E. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3445-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Mitoplasts/mitochondria were re-isolated and then lysed directly in SDS-sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting to nitrocellulose. The efficiency of swelling (>95%) was assessed following immunodecoration of the blot with antisera against endogenous cytochrome c peroxidase (soluble intermembrane space protein) and Mge1p (matrix-located protein) (not shown). Mitochondria were converted to mitoplasts by hypotonic swelling and were sonicated in the presence of salt (300 mm KCl) (Branson Sonifier 250, microtip, step 1–2, 80% duty, 10 × 10-s pulse) on ice. Samples were divided; one-half was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated directly (total), and the other half was centrifuged for 30 min at 226,000 × g at 2 °C (TL-45, Beckman TL-100). Both pellet and supernatant fractions were also trichloroacetic acid-precipitated. After import and trypsin treatment, mitochondria were lysed in 500 μl of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl. One-half of the sample was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated (total), and the other half was centrifuged for 30 min at 226,000 × g at 2 °C (TL-45, Beckman TL-100). The resulting pellet and supernatant fractions were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated. The following procedures were performed according to published methods: protein concentration determination (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar), SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207523) Google Scholar), and Western blotting (23Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44938) Google Scholar). The detection of endogenous proteins after blotting onto nitrocellulose was performed using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The N-terminal tail of mSu9(1–112)-DHFR bears a net negative charge (−1), as it contains two glutamic acid residues (Glu-70 and Glu-77) and one lysine residue (Lys-80). To address the importance of the net negative charge in the N-tail, we chose initially to replace Lys-80 with an uncharged residue, asparagine. By doing so, the net negative charge of the MPP-processed N-tail was altered from −1 to −2 (Fig. 1 A). The resulting fusion protein, preSu9(1–112)K80N-DHFR, and wild-type preSu9(1–112)-DHFR were synthesized in reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine. The radiolabeled preproteins were imported into isolated mitochondria, where they became processed to their respective mature forms by MPP (Fig. 1 B). Attainment of the correct topology, an Nout-Cinorientation, was assessed by the accessibility of the N-tail to added protease under hypotonic swelling conditions. Proteolytic degradation of the intermembrane space-exposed N-tail resulted in the generation of a slightly smaller protease-resistant fragment (f). Imported preSu9(1–112)K80N-DHFR was more efficiently sorted to its Nout-Cin orientation than its wild-type counterpart, as indicated by the generation of more of the ffragment following protease treatment of mitoplasts. Export of these proteins is dependent on the preceding step of import into mitochondria. It was therefore important to demonstrate that the more efficient export of mSu9(1–112)K80N-DHFR was not because of an indirect effect on the import reaction. To analyze the kinetics specifically of the export reaction, both preSu9(1–112)-DHFR and preSu9(1–112)K80N-DHFR were imported into the matrix of mitochondria, which had been pretreated with metal chelators EDTA and o-phenanthroline (EDTA/o-phe) (Fig.1 C). Under these conditions, the unprocessed precursors accumulate in the matrix, as export of the N-tail is inhibited because of the presence of the cleavable presequence at the N terminus (2Rojo E.E. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3445-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). After reactivation of the MPP activity by the addition of Mg2+/Mn2+, the matrix-accumulated species were chased for increasing time points. The N-tail of the MPP-processed mSu9(1–112)K80N-DHFR was more rapidly exported to the intermembrane space than that of the wild-type protein (Fig.1 C). Does the export of mSu9(1–112)K80N-DHFR require an energized inner membrane? Imported preSu9(1–112)K80N-DHFR was accumulated in the mitochondrial matrix in the presence of EDTA/o-phe and chased by the addition of divalent cations either in the presence of a low or high membrane potential or under conditions where inhibitors of the membrane potential were present (Fig. 1 D). In the presence of a low, basal membrane potential, some export of the mSu9(1–112)K80N-DHFR occurred. Like in the case of the wild-type counterpart, however, export of this mutant protein was clearly stimulated when the membrane potential was raised by the addition of substrate NADH. On the other hand, export of both proteins were inhibited upon the dissipation of the membrane potential by the addition of the uncoupler CCCP and to a lesser extent by the addition of valinomycin. Taken together these results show that Lys-80 is not required for the sorting of the N terminus of Su9 to the intermembrane space. On the contrary, when this positive charge is missing, the N terminus is more rapidly and more efficiently sorted. These results emphasize the importance of the negative charges in the sorting of the N-terminal domain to the intermembrane space. Furthermore, despite the additional negative charges, export of the N-tail of mSu9(1–112)K80N-DHFR responded in a similar manner to the membrane potential as its wild-type counterpart, requiring a high membrane potential for efficient export. To address the role of the negatively charged amino acids in the sorting of the N-terminal tail, the glutamic acids at either position 70 or 77 were exchanged individually for a lysine (E70K or E77K, respectively, Fig. 2 A). After import of the resulting fusion proteins into isolated mitochondria, both proteins, preSu9(1–112)E70K-DHFR and preSu9(1–112)E77K-DHFR, accumulated as MPP-processed species in the matrix. They failed to undergo N-terminal tail export in contrast to the wild-type protein (Fig. 2 B). mSu9(1–112)E70K-DHFR and mSu9(1–112)E77K-DHFR were membrane-associated, as they were recovered exclusively in the pellet fraction after sonication of the mitochondria and centrifugation (Fig. 2 C). These proteins were not aggregated in the matrix because wild-type and mutant variants were recovered in the supernatant after lysis of the mitochondria with detergent (Fig.2 D). In Escherichia coli, the membrane potential has been postulated to oppose the translocation of positive charges across the plasma membrane (24Andersson H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2267-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In certain instances, the dissipation of the membrane potential before insertion made possible the translocation of a positively charged N-tail engineered by in vitromutagenesis (24Andersson H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2267-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Does a similar situation occur in mitochondria? To address this question, preSu9(1–112)E70K-DHFR and preSu9(1–112)E77K-DHFR were imported in the presence of EDTA/o-phe, where they accumulated as precursors in the matrix (Fig. 2 E). Following the restoration of MPP activity by the addition of divalent cations, the proteins were chased either in the presence (plus NADH) or absence of a membrane potential (plus CCCP). The export of both mSu9(1–112)E70K-DHFR and mSu9(1–112)E77K-DHFR remained inhibited even in the absence of the proposed barrier of a membrane potential. The effectiveness of the CCCP treatment was indicated by the efficient inhibition of the export of mSu9(1–112)K80N-DHFR (data not shown). Taken together, export of an N-terminal tail to the intermembrane space is inhibited when it bears a net positive charge; rather, these mutated species remain in the matrix, in association with the inner side of the inner membrane. Is a net negative charge required for export of the N-tail? To address this question the charge of the N-terminal tail was altered to zero. To this end, the glutamic acid residue at position 77 was mutated to an asparagine (E77N) (Fig. 3 A). preSu9(1–112)E77N-DHFR was imported into isolated mitochondria, and export to an Nout-Cinorientation across the inner membrane was assessed by protease treatment of mitoplasts following import. In contrast to the corresponding wild-type protein, preSu9(1–112)E77N-DHFR did not become correctly sorted but remained protease-inaccessible in the matrix. In conclusion, a negatively charged N-terminal tail is essential for export from the matrix. The C-terminal region of the transmembrane domain of preSu9(1–112)-DHFR is flanked by amino acid residues with a net charge of +1. To determine the importance of this C-terminal-charged region, an arginine residue (Arg-111) was initially replaced with an aspartic acid residue, resulting in preSu9(1–112)R111D-DHFR (Fig.4 A). Radiolabeled preSu9(1–112)R111D-DHFR was imported into isolated mitochondria where it became sorted in a similar manner as its wild-type counterpart (Fig. 4 B). Thus the exchange of the single positively charged residue for a negative one C-terminal to the transmembrane segment did not influence the import and the sorting of the N terminus of Su9. The introduction of a second aspartic acid residue at position 112 (preSu9(1–112)R111D,N112D-DHFR, Fig. 4 A) though, did inhibit export, as the resulting imported species remained in the matrix following import (Fig.4 B). Residue 8 of the DHFR protein is an arginine and taking this into account, the net charge of the C-terminal region of the transmembrane domain from the wild-type protein is thus +2. Thus the C-terminal-flanking regions of preSu9(1–112)R111D-DHFR and preSu9(1–112)R111D,N112D-DHFR bear a net charge of 0 and −1, respectively. These observations suggest that the nature of the flanking charges at the C terminus of the hydrophobic domain of preSu9(1–112)-DHFR influence the ability of the N terminus to be sorted to the intermembrane space. Does reversal of charges flanking the transmembrane domain result in the attainment of a reverse orientation of the protein in the membrane? The mutant preSu9(1–112)E70K,E77K,R111D,N112D-DHFR was employed (Fig.5, left panel). As the reversal of the topology would result in the N-terminal domain being localized in the matrix (Nin-Cout), we performed import under conditions where MPP processing was inhibited by the addition of the chelators EDTA/o-phe. By doing so, an N-terminal fragment located in the matrix would be large enough to be identified easily by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (because of the presence of the uncleaved presequence) (12 kDa, f12). Radiolabeled preSu9(1–112)E70K,E77K,R111D,N112D-DHFR was imported into isolated mitochondria in the presence of EDTA/o-phe for various times, after which the localization of imported species was ascertained by hypotonic swelling in the presence of added proteinase K (Fig. 5, left panel). Imported preSu9(1–112)E70K,E77K,R111D,N112D-DHFR accumulated across the inner membrane with an Nin-Cout orientation, as indicated by the generation of the f12 fragment protease protected in the matrix, whereas the bulk of the protein was accessible to protease in mitoplasts. This topology was maintained throughout the entire import period, as the f12 fragment accumulated in a stable manner (Fig. 5, left panel). Complete import into the matrix of this protein was not observed. A similar fragment was also observed during import of preSu9(1–112)-DHFR, however, only at the early times of import (Fig. 5, right panel). Thus, the wild-type derivative appears to pause during translocation across the inner membrane but proceeds to complete import into the matrix at later time points. We conclude that reversal of the charges flanking the transmembrane segment of preSu9(1–112)-DHFR results in a reverse topology across the mitochondrial inner membrane. The kinetic analysis of import suggests, though, that the reversed topology is achieved by translocation arrest during import rather than by export of the C-terminal domain from the matrix into the intermembrane space. Export of N-terminal tails of proteins from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space is a process that is accompanied by the insertion of a hydrophobic segment of amino acids (usually a transmembrane domain) into the inner membrane. What determines the translocation of the N-terminal, rather than the C-terminal, flanking region? Our results show that the charged amino acid residues flanking both sides of the hydrophobic domain play a critical role in the directionality of the insertion process. The N-terminal tail of our model protein, preSu9(1–112)-DHFR, bears a net negative charge, whereas the region C-terminal to the hydrophobic stretch is positively charged. Increasing the net negative charge of the N-terminal tail resulted in a more efficient and rapid export from the matrix. Altering the charge to a net positive one or neutralizing it resulted in export inhibition and retention in the matrix. Thus the sorting of N-terminal tails in mitochondria apparently adheres to a principle similar to that of N-tail export in prokaryotes, where the positive-inside rule has been defined to describe the underlying mechanism (7von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8von Heijne G. Nature. 1989; 341: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). What role do the negative charges in the N-terminal tail play? Export of N-tails across the inner mitochondrial membrane and the bacterial periplasmic membrane, both, require a membrane potential (1Herrmann J.M. Koll H. Cook R.A. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol.

An energized mitochondrial inner membrane (or bacterial plasma membrane) is polarized, whereby the intermembrane space side (the periplasmic side in prokaryotes) is more positively charged with respect to the matrix side (the bacterial cytosolic side). Thus an electrophoresis-like mechanism for the translocation of N-tails in prokaryotes was proposed whereby the export of negatively charged N-terminal tails would be selectively stimulated (24Andersson H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2267-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 25Cao G. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 866-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 26Kiefer D. Hu X. Dalbey R. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Introduction of positive charges into the N-tail led to an inhibition of export, thus provoking the suggestion that the membrane potential opposes the translocation of positively charged residues (7von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Dalbey R.E. Kuhn A. von Heijne G.

Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Consistent with this conclusion, the disruption of the membrane potential in bacteria allowed in some instances a partial translocation of positively charged N-tails to the periplasm (24Andersson H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2267-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 25Cao G. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 866-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In mitochondria, the export of N-terminal tails displays a more stringent requirement for net charge and ΔμH+. First, increasing the net negative charge of the N-tail did not diminish its dependence on the ΔμH+ for export. Second, export of neutral and positively charged tails was not observed, even in the absence of the proposed barrier of the energized membrane. Thus the electrophoretic effect of the membrane potential is unlikely to be the only explanation for the importance of the negative charges for N-tail export in mitochondria. The export of N-tails in mitochondria has recently been shown to be mediated by the Oxa1p machinery (4He S. Fox T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1449-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 5Hell K. Herrmann J.M. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A.

A. 1998; 95: 2250-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We would propose that the negative charge of the N-tail may be important to promote an interaction with Oxa1p itself or other components of the Oxa1p complex. Protein-protein interactions based on interaction of charged domains in this manner may form the basis for the specificity and directionality of the export event in mitochondria. The same may hold true for prokaryotes, where the bacterial Oxa1p homolog, the IM60 protein, has also been described (27Saaf A. Monne M. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30415-30418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). What is the role of the charges flanking the C-terminal side of the transmembrane segment? Export inhibition of the N-tail was observed when the charge of the C-terminal region was altered from net positive to a net negative one. Thus, when both N- and C-terminal-flanking sequences bear a net negative charge, topological frustration occurs, as the protein remains in the matrix. Hence, the C-terminal positive charges may also be involved in binding to matrix-exposed elements of the export apparatus. These results differ from those observed with the coat protein of Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage Pf3 in E. coli, where it was shown that, when both termini carried a negative net charge, the Pf3 protein was able to insert either the N or the C terminus into membranes, leading to a 50%/50% mixed topology (26Kiefer D. Hu X. Dalbey R. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, in this study, both N- and C termini of the Pf3 protein were short. In the case of Su9(1–112)-DHFR, both the length (262 residues) and the folded state of DHFR may prevent a possible C-terminal export, as an Nin-Cout topology was not obtained. The reversal of the net charge between the N and C termini resulted in the imported protein adopting a reversed Nin-Cout orientation in the membrane. Attainment of this topology, however, did not appear to involve transit of the preprotein completely through the matrix and subsequent C-terminal export. Both the wild-type and reversed charge mutant protein probably pause during import over the inner membrane. During pausing, the TIM17–23 complex may scan incoming sorting signals to discriminate between those that should be arrested permanently in the membrane from those that stop transiently and then resume complete import into the matrix before export. Reversal of the charges flanking the transmembrane domain apparently resulted in an increased pausing of the mutant protein in the inner membrane, which was coupled with a premature and stable partitioning of the protein into the membrane. In summary, the charge distribution flanking a hydrophobic sorting signal plays a crucial role in the attainment of the correct topology in the membrane. The charge distribution influences sorting both at the level of the inner membrane translocase during import as well as at the Oxa1p export machinery. The positive-inside rule described for thesec-independent sorting of inner membrane proteins is conserved throughout evolution and holds true for those mitochondrial proteins that undergo export from the matrix."

Neuron. 1995; 15: 1231-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). By initiating global conformational changes throughout the pentamer, ACh opens the channel following brief occupancy and desensitizes following prolonged occupancy. Most mechanistic descriptions of AChR function are founded in the seminal work by Katz and Thesleff (3Katz B. Thesleff S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1957; 138: 63-80Crossref Scopus (954) Google Scholar) more than 40 years ago. They proposed that the AChR spontaneously switches between a low agonist affinity activatible state and a high agonist affinity desensitized state. Furthermore, they proposed that these states are linked in a cyclic rather than a sequential reaction mechanism. To accommodate the stoichiometry of two binding sites per AChR and positive cooperativity in agonist binding, current mechanistic descriptions incorporate some form of the allosteric model of Monod, Wyman, and Changeux (MWC model; Ref. 5Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6147) Google Scholar). The MWC model accounts for cooperative agonist binding by requiring concerted switching of the two binding sites between low and high affinity states. In addition to accounting for cooperative binding, the MWC model accounts for channel opening or desensitization in the absence of agonist and for nonidentical agonist binding and state functions (5Monod J.

AChRs from fetal muscle have the subunit composition α2βγδ, whereas those from the adult have the composition α2βεδ. The agonist binding domains are formed at subunit interfaces by αδ and either αγ or αε subunit pairs. Agonists and antagonists select between these three types of binding sites with rank order affinities that depend on both the ligand and the subunit subtype or species (4Prince R.J. Sine S.M. Barrantes F.J. The Nicotinic Receptor: Current Views and Future Trends. Landes Bioscience/Springer Verlag, GeorgeTown, TX1998: 31-59Google Scholar). The original form of the MWC model postulated identical affinities of the binding sites in a given functional state. However, in the case of the AChR, single channel kinetic analysis showed that in the resting state, the sites can be either indistinguishable or as different as 100-fold in their affinities for agonist, depending on receptor species and subtype (10Sine S.M. Claudio T. Sigworth F.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 96: 395-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 11Wang H-L. Auerbach A. Bren N. Ohno K. Engel A.G. Sine S.M. J. Gen.

Nevertheless, nonidentical binding sites are readily incorporated into the MWC model and still allow positive cooperativity in agonist binding. We recently showed that the novel agonist epibatidine binds to fetal and adult muscle AChRs with unique site- and state-selectivity (13Prince R.J. Sine S.M. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1817-1827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar,14Prince R.J. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7843-7849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For receptors in the resting state, epibatidine binds with opposite site-selectivity compared with ACh, showing the rank order of affinity, αγ > αε > αδ. For receptors in the desensitized state, epibatidine selects strongly between the sites, again with the rank order αγ > αε > αδ, unlike ACh, which shows little or no selectivity for this state. Finally, binding measurements at equilibrium reveal Hill coefficients of 0.7–0.8 for epibatidine but values of 1.3–1.4 for ACh. Here we take advantage of the very different site- and state-selectivities of epibatidine and ACh to quantitatively examine three different models describing receptor activation and desensitization. We fit predictions of each model simultaneously to measurements of ACh and epibatidine binding at equilibrium. Previously measured parameters for the epibatidine- and ACh-dependent steps are taken as constants, whereas the agonist-independent steps are free parameters and assumed to be the same for both agonists. Whereas all three models fit the midpoints of the binding profiles, the MWC model predicts far too steep a dependence on agonist concentration. Accurate fits and consistency with known parameters of receptor function are obtained with an Uncoupled model, which allows the binding sites to switch between functional states independently of each other. 125I-α-bungarotoxin was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Epibatidine and proadifen were purchased from Research Biochemicals Inc. The 293 human embryonic kidney cell line (293 HEK) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Mouse AChR subunit cDNAs were provided by Drs. Norman Davidson, Paul Gardner, and John Merlie. Receptors were transiently expressed in 293 HEK cells as described (15Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Two or three days after transfection, the growth medium was removed and the cells were rinsed with phosphate buffered saline and incubated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 μmdiisopropylphosphofluoridate for 15 min.

Agonist occupancy was determined by competition against the initial rate of 125I-labeled α-bungarotoxin binding as described (16Prince R.J. Sine S.M. J. Biol.

In brief, cells expressing AChRs were equilibrated with agonist for 40 min prior to the addition of 5 nm125I-α-bungarotoxin. The cells were then incubated for a further 20–40 min to allow occupancy of at most 50% of the binding sites by 125I-α-bungarotoxin. The total number of sites was determined by incubating with 25 nm125I-α-bungarotoxin for 20–40 min. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 mm carbamylcholine. The cells were harvested using a Brandel Cell Harvester and counted in a γ-counter. Equations in TableI were fitted to the data using MLAB (Civilized Software Inc), and the results were plotted using Prism (GraphPad Software). Note that for simplicity, Schemes Scheme 1, Scheme 2, Scheme 3 show sequential binding of agonist but that the equations used in curve fitting describe random binding to the two agonist binding sites.Table IParameters and equations for agonist binding schemesParameterFetalAdultValueReferenceValueReferenceμmAChK 1211217011Wang H-L.

Epibatidine and ACh bind to mouse AChRs with similar apparent dissociation constants under equilibrium conditions (Fig. 1).

The D state is assumed to correspond to the high affinity state induced by exposure to local anesthetics such as proadifen (8Sine S.M. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8106-8114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sine S.M. Claudio T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13679-13689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although in its original form, the MWC model accounts for positive cooperativity in agonist binding, apparent negative cooperativity can arise if the two sites differ in their affinities for agonist and M 0 approaches limiting small or large values. Except for the allosteric constantM 0, all parameters in Scheme 1 have been determined by single channel kinetic analysis or by measurements of agonist binding to desensitized receptors (Table I). BecauseM 0 governs the equilibrium between unliganded states, it can be regarded as an intrinsic property of the receptor and should be agonist-independent. We therefore fit Scheme 1 to measurements of epibatidine and ACh binding simultaneously, allowing only M 0 to vary (TableII). The MWC model fits the midpoints of the binding curves but predicts Hill coefficients significantly steeper than observed experimentally (Fig. 1 A; TableIII). Separate fitting of the MWC model to either the epibatidine or ACh data produced similar results, suggesting that the divergence between theory and experiment is not an artifact of simultaneous fitting. The MWC model predicts positive cooperativity in agonist binding because sites on the same receptor are constrained to be in the same functional state. To better describe the binding profiles for ACh and epibatidine, we relaxed the constraint of functional symmetry to achieve greater heterogeneity of the binding species. The following Uncoupled model (Scheme 2) allows independent switching of the two binding sites from one state to the other, and variable coupling between the sites (18Sine S.M. Claudio T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19369-19377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the MWC model, the Uncoupled model allows binding sites of an individual receptor to switch between functional states independently of each other, leading to hybrid RD and DRspecies. State transitions are not agonist-induced, like the MWC model, accounting for spontaneous switching between functional states in the absence of agonist. The allosteric constant M 1describes the equilibrium between R and D states for the binding site that first enters the desensitized state, whereasM 2 describes the equilibrium for the second site. Receptors with one site in the D state are assumed to be desensitized, so that either of the binding sites can initiate desensitization. The remaining agonist-dependent parameters are the same as described for Scheme 1. Simultaneous fits of the Uncoupled model to measurements of ACh and epibatidine binding accurately describe the binding profiles for both fetal and adult receptors (Fig. 1 B). In particular the degree of cooperativity for both agonists is fully accounted for (TableIII). The fitted value of M 1 is roughly 10-fold smaller than M 2, allowing just enough site heterogeneity to broaden the binding profiles for both agonists yet still accounting for positive cooperativity in ACh binding (Table II). Separate fitting to the epibatidine data yieldedM 1 and M 2 values that accurately described the data for ACh, whereas separate fitting to the ACh data yielded M 1 andM 2 values that failed to describe the epibatidine data (not shown). Simultaneous fitting therefore provides meaningful results for both ACh and epibatidine binding. Thus the Uncoupled model, together with known parameters for agonist binding and channel gating, accounts for all aspects of equilibrium binding for ACh and epibatidine. Since the work of Katz and Thesleff (3Katz B. Thesleff S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1957; 138: 63-80Crossref Scopus (954) Google Scholar), considerable evidence has accumulated to show that desensitization is in fact a heterogeneous phenomenon. Time constants for desensitization have been reported on time scales ranging from milliseconds to minutes, leading to the consensus that there are at least two predominant desensitized states; one has fast onset and fast recovery, whereas the other has slow onset and slow recovery (19Scuka M. Mozrzymas J.W. Prog. Neurobiol. 1992; 38: 19-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 20Dilger J.P. Liu Y. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1992; 420: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 21Franke C. Parnas H. Hovav G. Dudel J. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 339-356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We therefore tested a model that incorporates two distinct desensitized states. One of the desensitized states (D) is assumed to correspond to desensitization with slow onset and slow recovery and is the high affinity state induced by prolonged exposure to agonist or by local anesthetics (8,17). The allosteric constantM 0 describes the equilibrium betweenR and D states and is analogous to that in the MWC model. The second desensitized state (I) corresponds to desensitization with rapid onset and rapid recovery, binds agonist with dissociation constants K d1′ andK d2′, and equilibrates with the Rstate according to the allosteric constantM 0′. Simultaneous fitting of Scheme 3 to binding data for epibatidine and ACh requires six free parameters: M 0,M 0′, K d1′ andK d2′ for epibatidine, andK d1′ and K d2′ for ACh. The remaining parameters are known and were constrained to the values used in fitting the MWC and Uncoupled models (Table I). We found that simultaneous fits of Scheme 3 described the data approximately as well as the Uncoupled model (not shown) but yielded estimates of the six free parameters that were highly interdependent (dependence values close to 1 for all parameters), suggesting that a unique solution cannot be found. Further evaluation of Scheme 3 requires knowing one or more of the six free parameters or constraining them in a reasonable way. We have no direct information on K d1′ andK d2′ for either agonist for fetal or adult AChRs. However, for ACh binding to the adult mouse AChR, we know thatK 1 and K 2 for theR state are indistinguishable, as areK d1 and K d2 for theD state (Table I). Thus it seems reasonable to assume thatK d1′ and K d2′ for theI state are identical and to assign a single valueK d′. Furthermore, we can constrain the fraction of receptors desensitized in the absence of agonist to a conservative value of 5%, or M 0+ M 0′ = 0.05. Thus, we fit Scheme 3 to the ACh data by assigningK d′ to various values, varyingM 0 and M 0′, but constraining M 0+ M0′ = 0.05. The fit accurately described ACh binding to the adult AChR, with aK d′ of 0.32 μm,M 0 = 0.0 and M 0′ = 0.05. However, the value of M 0 was vanishingly small, predicting little or no receptor in the D state and that theI state predominates over the D state under all conditions. Both of these predictions conflict with the observation that the D state predominates over the I state in single channel recordings (28,29). Thus the two desensitized state model, although able to describe our data, fails to account for known aspects of AChR function. We sought to further distinguish the MWC and Uncoupled models by preventing access of agonist to one of the two binding sites. We reasoned that if one site could be selectively occupied by an antagonist, or effectively removed from the R toD equilibrium, both models simplify to the following one-site scheme. In Scheme 4, XCR andXCD represent receptors in the resting and desensitized states, respectively, which have one site occupied by the selective antagonist. K and K d are dissociation constants for agonist binding to the resting and desensitized states, respectively, but correspond to the remaining site accessible to agonist. MC is the allosteric constant governing the equilibrium between R andD states and is analogous to the allosteric constants in the MWC and Uncoupled models. To selectively occupy one of the two binding sites, we used α-conotoxin MI (CTx), a peptide toxin from predatory marine snails that binds to the αδ binding site with nanomolar affinity, to the αε site with micromolar affinity, and to the αγ site with tens of micromolar affinity (Ref. 22Sine S.M. Kreienkamp H.-J. Bren N. Maeda R. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar; TableIV). Recent studies showed that CTx dissociates very slowly from the αδ site, based on the stability of αδ-CTx complexes during sucrose gradient sedimentation (23Sugiyama N. Marchot P. Kawanishi C. Osaka H. Molles B. Sine S. Taylor P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Following incubation and removal of CTx, measurements of125I-α-bungarotoxin binding show that 50% of either fetal or adult AChR binding sites are occupied by CTx, a percentage that remains constant more than 6 h following removal of the free CTx (Fig. 2). Thus, CTx selectively and irreversibly occupies the αδ site.Table IVBinding of conotoxin MI to AChRs under equilibrium and desensitizing conditionsK 1K 2FnmFetal1.6 ± 0.226000 ± 62000.42 ± 0.02Fetal + proadifen3.9 ± 0.7147000 ± 300000.48 ± 0.08Adult0.93 ± 0.1250 ± 600.51 ± 0.01Adult + proadifen0.97 ± 0.15350 ± 14.50.59 ± 0.06Parameters are derived from fits of a two binding site model to data from three to four experiments and are expressed ± S.E.

At various time intervals thereafter, the total number of free binding sites was determined by incubation of an aliquot of cells with 25 nm125I-labeled α-bungarotoxin for 30 min.

Receptors were desensitized using 200 μm (fetal AChR) or 60 μm proadifen (adult AChR). K 1 andK 2 are dissociation constants for CTx MI binding to the two binding sites; F is the fraction of sites with high affinity. Following selective occupancy by CTx, receptors were equilibrated with specified concentrations of either ACh or epibatidine, and fractional occupancy was measured. For ACh, apparent affinity decreases nearly 10-fold compared with the unprotected fetal or adult receptor controls, and the binding profiles broaden to approach Hill coefficients of one, as expected for binding to a single site and low affinity of free αε (adult AChR) or αγ (fetal AChR) sites (Fig.3; TableV). Analogously, for epibatidine, apparent affinity increases and the binding profiles sharpen to approach Hill coefficients of one, as expected for binding to a single site, and high affinity of free αε or αγ sites. Thus, following selective occupancy by CTx, the ACh and epibatidine binding profiles shift in opposite directions, as expected from their opposite site-selectivity. To estimate the allosteric constant MC, we fit Scheme 4 simultaneously to the ACh and epibatidine data. We constrained the dissociation constants for binding to resting and desensitized states to known values, and varied MC. For ACh binding to αγ and αε sites in the resting state, we assignedK to the low affinity values of 675 and 170 μm, respectively (Table I). Conversely, for epibatidine binding to αγ and αε sites in the resting state, we assignedK to the high affinity values of 2 μm and 11.8 μm, respectively. Similarly, for ACh binding to αγ and αε sites in the desensitized state, we assignedK d to the values of 17 and 40 nm, respectively (Table I).

https://openalex.org/W2055057989,"In bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells, angiotensin II and extracellular K+ stimulate aldosterone secretion in a calcium-dependent manner. In these cells, physiological concentrations of extracellular potassium activate both T-type (low threshold) and L-type (high threshold) voltage-operated calcium channels. Paradoxically, the cytosolic calcium response to 9 mm K+ is inhibited by angiotensin II. Because K+-induced calcium changes observed in the cytosol are almost exclusively due to L-type channel activity, we therefore studied the mechanisms of L-type channel regulation by angiotensin II. Using the patch-clamp method in its perforated patch configuration, we observed a marked inhibition (by 63%) of L-type barium currents in response to angiotensin II. This effect of the hormone was completely prevented by losartan, a specific antagonist of the AT1receptor subtype. Moreover, this inhibition was strongly reduced when the cells were previously treated for 1 night with pertussis toxin. An effect of pertussis toxin was also observed on the modulation by angiotensin II of the K+ (9 mm)-induced cytosolic calcium response in fura-2-loaded cells, as well as on the angiotensin II-induced aldosterone secretion, at both low (3 mm) and high (9 mm) K+concentrations. Finally, the expression of both Go and Gi proteins in bovine glomerulosa cells was detected by immunoblotting. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that in bovine glomerulosa cells, a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein is involved in the inhibition of L-type channel activity induced by angiotensin II.

Both stimuli are able to maintain a sustained influx of Ca2+ into these cells. AngII induces a biphasic response of the cytosolic free Ca2+concentration ([Ca2+]c): an initial transient rise due to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced release of Ca2+ from the intracellular stores is followed by a sustained plateau phase, resulting from the activation of the capacitative influx triggered by the depletion of intracellular Ca2+ pools (1Burnay M.M. Python C.P. Vallotton M.B. Capponi A.M. Rossier M.F. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 2Capponi A.M. Python C.P. Rossier M.F. Endocrine. 1994; 2: 579-586Google Scholar). Angiotensin II also activates voltage-operated Ca2+ channels of both T- and L-types by inducing cell depolarization through inhibition of K+channels. Ca2+ influx through these channels also contributes to the sustained Ca2+ entry triggered by AngII (1Burnay M.M. Python C.P. Vallotton M.B. Capponi A.M. Rossier M.F. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Extracellular K+, by depolarizing the cells, directly activates the voltage-operated Ca2+ channels, leading to a sustained Ca2+ entry into the cell (3Barrett P.Q. Isales C.M. Bollag W.B. McCarthy R.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: F706-F719PubMed Google Scholar, 4Capponi A.M. Rossier M.F. Curr. Opin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 1996; 3: 248-257Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, Ca2+ entry elicited by K+ is markedly inhibited upon addition of AngII (5Capponi A.M. Lew P.D. Vallotton M.B. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 6Balla T. Hollo Z. Varnai P. Spät A. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Although this phenomenon was observed some years ago both in rat and bovine glomerulosa cells, the mechanism of this AngII effect on cytosolic Ca2+ homeostasis has never been elucidated. In bovine glomerulosa cells, the presence of both high threshold, long lasting (L-type) and low threshold, transient (T-type) voltage-operated Ca2+ channels has been demonstrated (7Matsunaga H. Yamashita N. Maruyama Y. Kojima I. Kurokawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 1049-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because of their low threshold of activation, T-type channels have been first thought to be the major mediators of the Ca2+ response to physiological increases of extracellular K+ (3Barrett P.Q. Isales C.M. Bollag W.B. McCarthy R.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: F706-F719PubMed Google Scholar, 8Cohen C.J. McCarthy R.T. Barrett P.Q. Rasmussen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2412-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Various laboratories have subsequently investigated the modulation of T-type channels by AngII, but contradictory results have been published. Luet al. (9Lu H.-K. Fern R.J. Luthin D. Linden J. Liu L.-P. Cohen C.J. Barrett P.Q. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1340-C1349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have observed an increase of T channel activity induced by AngII and mediated by a Gi protein. In fact, they have shown that AngII shifts the activation curve of T channels to more negative voltage values, increasing the size of the permissive window of voltage of the channel and therefore allowing more Ca2+ to enter the cell in a steady state manner. In contrast, in our laboratory, we found that AngII shifts the activation curve of T channels to more positive voltages, thus reducing the steady-state current through these channels (10Rossier M.F. Aptel H.B.C. Python C.P. Burnay M.M. Vallotton M.B. Capponi A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15137-15142Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this study, Rossier et al.(10Rossier M.F. Aptel H.B.C. Python C.P. Burnay M.M. Vallotton M.B. Capponi A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15137-15142Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) demonstrated that AngII exerts a negative modulation on T channels and that this modulation is mediated by protein kinase C (PKC). In summary, both positive and negative effects of AngII on T channel activity have been observed in electrophysiological experiments performed under similar conditions, but no correlation with [Ca2+]c has been ever obtained. Recently, a clear dissociation between L- and T-type channel functions has been established. Indeed, Ca2+ entering through each channel appears to have distinct functions and destinations (11Rossier M.F. Burnay M.M. Brandenburger Y. Cherradi N. Vallotton M.B. Capponi A.M. Endocr. Res. 1996; 22: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Selective inhibition of L-type channels does not markedly affect steroidogenesis, as demonstrated by Barrett et al. (12Barrett P.Q. Ertel E.A. Smith M.M. Nee J.J. Cohen C.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C985-C992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the spider toxin ω-agatoxin-IIIA, as well as in our own laboratory, using low concentrations of dihydropyridines (13Rossier M.F. Burnay M.M. Vallotton M.B. Capponi A.M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4817-4826Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In contrast, in these and other studies, T-type channel activity has been shown to be more closely related to aldosterone production. For example, T channel inhibition with the divalent ion nickel or the relatively specific alkaloid tetrandrine strongly reduced aldosterone production (14Rossier M.F. Python C.P. Capponi A.M. Schlegel W. Kwan C.Y. Vallotton M.B. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1035-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Moreover, L-type channels appear to be the major mediators of the large [Ca2+]c variations observed with fluorescent probes in response to extracellular K+, whereas at low, physiological concentrations of the agonist, the cytosolic Ca2+ signal resulting from T channel activation is barely detectable (15Rossier M.F. Burnay M.M. Capponi A.M. Clozel J.-P. Nargeot J. Tsien R.W. Low Voltage-activated T-type Calcium Channels. Adis International, Chester, United Kingdom1998: 176-185Google Scholar). In order to understand the mechanism of the inhibition by AngII of the K+-induced cytosolic Ca2+ response, we therefore have investigated the modulation of the activity of L-type channels by the hormone, using both patch-clamp and microfluorometry methods. Percoll was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Amphotericin B, nifedipine, nicardipine, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Triton X-100, aprotinin, leupeptin, 2-mercaptoethanol, pertussis toxin, and tetrodotoxin were purchased from Sigma; fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR); Tween-20 was from Merck (Geneva, Switzerland); glycerol and bromphenol blue were from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland); and Cell-Tak was from BioReba (Basel, Switzerland). Losartan (DuP753) was a generous gift from Dr. R. D. Smith, DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Co. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies selectively raised against rat Gi and Goproteins were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Bovine adrenal glands were obtained from a local slaughterhouse, and adrenal glomerulosa cells were prepared by enzymatic dispersion, purified on a Percoll density gradient, and, for the patch-clamp and microfluorometry experiments, maintained in culture for 2–4 days on Cell-Tak-coated glass coverslips, as described previously in detail (14Rossier M.F. Python C.P. Capponi A.M. Schlegel W. Kwan C.Y. Vallotton M.B. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1035-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Otherwise, cells were used freshly prepared, after two washes in Krebs-Ringer buffer (137 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.25 mmMgSO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 5.5 mmd-glucose, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) for [Ca2+]c measurements in cell populations. The activity of voltage-operated Ca2+ channels in single bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells was recorded under voltage-clamp in the perforated patch configuration of the patch-clamp method, as described previously (13Rossier M.F. Burnay M.M. Vallotton M.B. Capponi A.M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4817-4826Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 16Horn R. Marty A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 145-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar). The bath solution contained 117 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 20 mm BaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmd-glucose, 32 mm sucrose, and 200 nm tetrodotoxin and was buffered to pH 7.5 with 10 mm Hepes (CsOH). The patch-pipette (3–6 megohm; Clark 150T, Reading, United Kingdom) contained 130 mm CsCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmCaCl2, and the pH was adjusted to 7.2 with 20 mm Hepes (CsOH). The pipette solution also contained 0.24 mg/ml amphotericin B, but the tip of the pipette was filled with ionophore-free solution to allow the formation of the seal. The access resistance was reduced within approximately 10 min after seal formation. The reference electrode was placed in a KCl solution linked to the bath with an Agar bridge, reducing the liquid junction potential to negligible values. The cell was voltage-clamped (Axopatch 1D, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) at holding potential of −90 mV and depolarized as indicated. The currents were filtered at 1–2 kHz and sampled at 5 kHz using a TL-1-125 interface (Axon Instruments). The leak was subtracted automatically by a P/4 protocol (pclamp6, Axon Instruments). Cytosolic [Ca2+] was determined in freshly isolated bovine glomerulosa cell populations loaded with the fluorescent probe fura-2. After isolation, cells were preincubated at 37 °C for approximately 1 h in Krebs-Ringer buffer. Cells were then washed, resuspended at 107 cells/ml, and incubated in the dark in the same buffer for 45 min in the presence of 2 μm fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester. Dye excess was then washed away and the cells were kept in the dark at room temperature. Samples of 2 × 106 cells were sedimented just before use and resuspended in 2 ml of Krebs-Ringer buffer in a cuvette placed in a thermostatted room at 37 °C. Fura-2 fluorescence was recorded with a Jasco CAF-110 fluorescence spectrometer (Hachioji City, Japan), and [Ca2+]cwas determined as described by Grynkiewicz et al. (17Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cytosolic [Ca2+] was also determined in single cultured cells, plated on glass coverslips coated with Cell-Tak. Cells were incubated in a Krebs-Ringer buffer for 45 min at room temperature in the presence of 1 μm fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester. Loaded cells were then washed with the Krebs-Ringer buffer. Fura-2 fluorescence was monitored on an inverted Zeiss Axiovert S100TV microscope coupled to a PTI D104 photometer. The light source came from a Xenon XBO 75-W lamp. The fluorescent signal (excitation 340/380 nm, emission 510 nm) was recorded using the Felix 1.1 software on an AST 386/100 MHz computer. Measurement of aldosterone production from cultured glomerulosa cells was performed as described elsewhere (1Burnay M.M. Python C.P. Vallotton M.B. Capponi A.M. Rossier M.F. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Glomerulosa cells, after 2 days in culture, were incubated overnight in the presence or absence of pertussis toxin (500 ng/ml). The next day, the medium was removed, and cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in multiwell plates containing a modified Krebs-Ringer medium and various concentrations of AngII. At the end of the incubation period, the aldosterone content of the medium was determined by direct radioimmunoassay, using a commercially available kit (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Webster, TX). Bovine glomerulosa cells in primary culture, as well as cultured GH4 cells, were homogenized in lysis buffer (containing 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) at 4 °C. Extracted proteins were quantified using a protein microassay (Bio-Rad). SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). Extracts of total cellular protein (16 μg/lane) were solubilized in sample buffer (60 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.01% (v/v) bromphenol blue) and loaded onto a SDS/polyacrylamide (10%) gel (MiniProtean II system, Bio-Rad). Electrophoresis was performed at 130 V for 1 h. SDS-PAGE-resolved proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Macherey-Nagel, Düen, Germany). The membrane was then incubated in blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.4% Tween-20 and 5% nonfat dried milk) overnight at 4 °C and then incubated for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.4% Tween-20 with rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the α subunits of the Go and Gi proteins. The membrane was washed with the same buffer and then incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (CovalAb, Oullins, France). The membrane was then washed three times for 10 min with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.4% Tween-20, and the antigen-antibody complex was revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence using a Western blot detection kit and Hyper-ECL film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). As previously observed in bovine glomerulosa cells (5Capponi A.M. Lew P.D. Vallotton M.B. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and confirmed by others in rat cells (6Balla T. Hollo Z. Varnai P. Spät A. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), 10 nmAngII markedly reduced the sustained elevation of [Ca2+]c elicited upon addition of 9 mm extracellular K+ (Fig.1 A). Because challenge with AngII is normally accompanied by Ca2+ release from inositol ,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ pools and by development of a capacitative Ca2+ influx, thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the microsomal Ca2+/Mg2+-ATPases, was added at the beginning of the experiment in order to empty Ca2+ stores and to allow an accurate determination of the inhibition of the Ca2+ signal by the hormone. The amount of this inhibition was estimated to be 63 ± 15% from 12 independent experiments. The addition of 2 μm nifedipine, a dihydropyridine antagonist, at the end of the experiment achieved to reduce [Ca2+]c down to the level corresponding to 100% inhibition of the voltage-operated Ca2+ channels. Two mechanisms could be responsible for the decrease of [Ca2+]c induced by AngII: 1) an inhibition of the calcium influx through voltage-operated calcium channels, or 2) an activation of the pumping of calcium out of the cytosol through plasma membrane Ca2+/Mg2+-ATPases. In order to discriminate between these possibilities, we completely blocked the Ca2+ channels opened by K+ with 2 μm nifedipine, before the addition of AngII (Fig.1 B). As expected, an almost complete inhibition of the sustained [Ca2+]c response to K+ was observed upon addition of nifedipine, and AngII exerted only a very small effect on the residual [Ca2+]c level thereafter, thus excluding a strong activation of the Ca2+pumps by the hormone and therefore privileging an action of AngII on the dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels. Single bovine glomerulosa cells were voltage-clamped in the permeabilized patch configuration of the patch clamp technique and both T- and L-type Ca2+ channels were activated upon a step depolarization from −90 to 0 mV. In order to discriminate between T and L currents, we maintained the depolarized state at 0 mV for 600 ms (Fig.2, inset). L current was measured after 500 ms, when most T channels are inactivated, as expected according to their fast inactivation characteristics (time constant, τ = 20 ms at 0 mV) and when T current amplitude is therefore negligible. A time-course study of L-type current amplitude (Fig. 2) confirmed its relative stability in the perforated patch configuration. Addition of 100 nm AngII induced a marked inhibition of the current in less than 1 min. Addition of a dihydropyridine antagonist, such as nifedipine or nicardipine, at the end of the experiment blocked the residual current and pharmacologically confirmed the identity of this current. The mean inhibition induced by AngII has been estimated to be 63 ± 11% (n = 14) of the maximal current, a value closely related to the inhibition of the [Ca2+]c signal. In contrast, the transient current observed during the first 50 ms depolarization and reflecting T channel activity remained unaffected by AngII or nifedipine treatment at 0 mV. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the action of AngII on L current was only rarely observed in the whole cell configuration and that the cells needed to be maintained metabolically intact (in the perforated patch configuration) for AngII to exert its inhibition on L channels. Washing out the hormone (Fig. 3) allowed recovery of 30 ± 3% of L channel activity (n = 3), whereas addition of losartan (10 μm), a specific AT1 receptor antagonist, a few minutes after the hormone reversed only 19 ± 5% of the AngII effect (n = 4). This lack of complete reversibility could be attributed to AngII receptor sequestration or endocytosis, as previously suggested by Ambroz and Catt (19Ambroz C. Catt K.J. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 B also shows the current-voltage relationship of the L-type current before (▪) and after (▴) the addition of 100 nm AngII, as well as after the wash-out of the hormone (●). The inhibition of the current exerted by the hormone was observed at any voltage, and AngII did not change the shape of the current-voltage curve; threshold, peak, and reversal potentials of the Ba2+ current were not affected by AngII (n= 6). We have previously shown that the presence of losartan (DuP753), prevents the action of AngII on the [Ca2+]c signal induced by extracellular K+ (10Rossier M.F. Aptel H.B.C. Python C.P. Burnay M.M. Vallotton M.B. Capponi A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15137-15142Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Similarly, losartan prevented AngII action on L-type channels. Indeed, as illustrated in Fig.4, losartan (10 μm) had no effect by itself on the amplitude of L-type currents elicited by a depolarization to 0 mV but completely prevented the AngII-induced inhibition of this current (n = 4). The current remained sensitive to dihydropyridines and was almost completely abolished upon addition of 2 μm nicardipine. To further characterize the molecular mechanism through which AngII exerts its inhibition on L currents, we tested whether protein kinase C (PKC), which is coupled to the AT1 receptor through the formation of diacylglycerol, is involved in the modulation of L-type channels. We have previously shown that in glomerulosa cells, T-type channels are negatively regulated by PKC and that aldosterone production is concomitantly reduced (10Rossier M.F. Aptel H.B.C. Python C.P. Burnay M.M. Vallotton M.B. Capponi A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15137-15142Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 20Aptel H.B.C. Johnson E.I.M. Vallotton M.B. Rossier M.F. Capponi A.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 119: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar); however, we have also demonstrated that activation of PKC with the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate is unable to mimic AngII action on the [Ca2+]c signal induced by K+(13Rossier M.F. Burnay M.M. Vallotton M.B. Capponi A.M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4817-4826Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In agreement with the latter observation, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate had no effect on L-type currents and did not prevent the inhibition induced by AngII in 4 individually tested cells (data not shown). In numerous cells, it has been shown that L-type calcium channels can be modulated by pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins, such as Gi or Go (21Hescheler J. Schulz G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1993; 3: 360-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We therefore treated bovine glomerulosa cells overnight with 500 ng/ml pertussis toxin (Ptx) before recording L-type currents. Under these conditions, we observed a marked reduction of the inhibition of L-type Ca2+ channels in response to AngII. Fig.5 shows a cell in which AngII effect on L-type current was completely abolished by Ptx treatment, although the sensitivity to dihydropyridines remained unchanged. On average, the inhibition of the current elicited by AngII, which amounted to 63% in control cells, was reduced to only 21 ± 17% after treatment with Ptx (n = 16). The effect of Ptx was statistically significant according to an unpaired Student's t test with a p value < 0.0001. In order to determine whether the effect of Ptx on the AngII-induced inhibition observed on Ba2+ currents is also exerted on [Ca2+]c homeostasis, we performed Ca2+ microfluorometry experiments in single fura-2-loaded glomerulosa cells. Fig. 6 compares the [Ca2+]c fluctuations obtained in a control cell (A) and in a cell treated overnight with Ptx (500 ng/ml) (B). Cells were successively exposed to thapsigargin, K+, and AngII, as described in Fig. 1 A. After establishment of an elevated plateau of [Ca2+]cat approximately 400 nm with K+, the addition of AngII led to a dramatic reduction of the [Ca2+]c signal in the control cell (Fig.6 A), but had a much less pronounced effect in the Ptx-treated cell (Fig. 6 B). The responses obtained in control individual cells (n = 3) were similar to those obtained in control cell populations (Fig. 1 A); AngII-induced inhibition of the [Ca2+]c signal amounted on average to 60 ± 5%. In contrast, in the Ptx-treated single cells, the inhibition of the K+-induced [Ca2+]c elevation by AngII was reduced to only 19 ± 8% in the five tested cells. In a separate series of experiments, we have assessed the effect of Ptx treatment on the [Ca2+]c response to AngII at a low concentration of K+ (3 mm). Under these conditions, the [Ca2+]c rise induced by AngII, measured during the plateau phase 3 min after hormone addition, was slightly more pronounced in Ptx-treated cells (93 ± 16 nm, n = 10) as compared with control cells (69 ± 11 nm, n = 12, data not shown), probably reflecting a lack of L channel inhibition in Ptx-treated cells. Because treatment with Ptx maintains [Ca2+]c at markedly higher levels upon stimulation with AngII, we have investigated the effect of Ptx on the steroidogenic response. As illustrated in Fig. 7, pretreatment with the toxin reduced by approximately 20% the aldosterone secretion evoked by AngII, without significantly changing the EC50value for the hormone. Similar results were obtained when aldosterone was stimulated with increasing concentrations of AngII in the presence of 9 mm instead of 3 mm K+ (not shown). Because both Go and Giproteins are known to be sensitive to Ptx, we have investigated which isoform is expressed in bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells. The presence of Go and Gi in cellular extracts was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with specific antibodies raised against the α subunit of each isoform. Results were compared with those obtained with the GH4C1 rat pituitary cell line, in which the expression of these isoforms has been well characterized (22Yajima Y. Akita Y. Katada T. Saito T. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 92: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). As expected, both Go and Gi isoforms were detected in GH4C1 cells as strong bands at approximately 40 kDa (Fig. 8). Bands of similar intensity were also observed in proteins extracts of bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells, strongly suggesting that both Giand Go proteins are constitutively expressed in these cells. The aim of the present study was to characterize the molecular mechanism by which AngII exerts its inhibitory action on the cytosolic Ca2+ response to K+ (Fig. 1 A), a phenomenon already observed several years ago in adrenal glomerulosa cells (5Capponi A.M. Lew P.D. Vallotton M.B. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because this effect disappeared after voltage-operated calcium channel inhibition with dihydropyridines (Fig. 1 B), it is deduced that the reduction of [Ca2+]cevoked by AngII reflects the hormonal modulation of these channels rather than an activation of Ca2+ extrusion from the cytosol. In previous work (10Rossier M.F. Aptel H.B.C. Python C.P. Burnay M.M. Vallotton M.B. Capponi A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15137-15142Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we have studied the modulation by AngII of the low threshold T-type calcium channels, which appeared, at this time, to be the main effectors of Ca2+ entry under very small depolarizations resulting from physiological K+increases. More recently, we have focused our attention on the high threshold L-type channels for two reasons: 1) the inhibition of the steady-state current flowing through T-type channels with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate is not accompanied by a reduction of the [Ca2+]c levels; and 2) the [Ca2+]c response to low concentrations of extracellular K+ is mainly due to L-type channels, the contribution of T channels to the signal being negligible (13Rossier M.F. Burnay M.M. Vallotton M.B. Capponi A.M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4817-4826Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The main finding of the present work is that AngII clearly modulates negatively L channels in bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells, to the same extent as it reduces [Ca2+]c. This inhibition does not result from a shift of the sensitivity of the channel to voltage and is observed at any membrane potential; however, further investigation will be required, particularly at the single channel level, in order to determine whether total current inhibition is due to a decrease of channel open probability, to a change of channel conductance or to a modulation of channel insertion within the plasma membrane. In any case, these results strongly suggest that the inhibition of L-type channels by AngII is responsible for the decreased [Ca2+]c. The AT1 receptor subtype has been shown to be the major AngII receptor expressed in adrenal glomerulosa cells and to mediate most of the hormone actions in these cells (23Balla T. Baukal A.J. Eng S. Catt K.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 401-406PubMed Google Scholar). The AngII-induced inhibition of L-type Ca2+ channels appears to be also mediated by the AT1 receptor. Indeed, the presence of the AT1-selective antagonist losartan completely abolished AngII action (Fig. 4). This result is in agreement with the previous observation that losartan also prevents the action of AngII on the sustained [Ca2+]c response to K+(10Rossier M.F. Aptel H.B.C. Python C.P. Burnay M.M. Vallotton M.B. Capponi A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15137-15142Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Various cellular mechanisms of L-type Ca2+ channel modulation have been extensively investigated (21Hescheler J. Schulz G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1993; 3: 360-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). From these studies, two major pathways have been highlighted: these involve either GTP binding proteins or channel phosphorylation by specific kinases. Whereas a role for PKC or tyrosine kinases, enzymes known to be linked to AT1 receptor activation, could be recently excluded (24Maturana A.D. Burnay M.M. Capponi A.M. Vallotton M.B. Rossier M.F. J. Recept. Signal Transduction Res. 1999; 19: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), we show here (Fig. 5) that the modulation of the L-type current by AngII is much reduced after pertussis toxin treatment. This finding strongly suggests that the transduction of the AngII signal from the AT1 receptor to the L-type channels involves a Ptx-sensitive G protein of the Gi/Gofamily. A modulation of L channels by AngII through G proteins has been previously observed in other cell types, but with contrasting results. For example, Hescheler et al. (25Hescheler J. Rosenthal W. Hinsch K.-D. Wulfern M. Trautwein W. Schulz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that AngII, through a Gi protein, stimulates L-type current in the murine adrenocortical cell line Y1. More recently, an inhibition by AngII of L-type currents has been reported in rabbit sinoatrial node cells (26Habuchi Y. Lu L.L. Morikawa J. Yoshimura M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H1053-H1060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in guinea pig cardiomyocytes (27Ai T. Horie M. Obayashi K. Sasayama S. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 436: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and these negative modulations have been proposed to be mediated by Gi through an inhibition of the cAMP-dependent pathway. Moreover, in each of these studies, pretreatment of the cells with Ptx abolished AngII action on L currents. It is, however, noteworthy that in contrast to what we observed in glomerulosa cells, in the above studies, AngII affected L currents only after they had been enhanced by β-adrenergic stimulation, the hormone being inefficient on basal currents. As expected, in bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells, Ptx treatment also markedly reduced the AngII-induced inhibition of the sustained [Ca2+]c response to K+ (Fig. 6) and slightly increased the [Ca2+]c response to AngII itself (not shown). This sensitivity of the [Ca2+]c signal to Ptx confirms the previously described close relationship existing between [Ca2+]c and L-type channel activity (13Rossier M.F. Burnay M.M. Vallotton M.B. Capponi A.M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4817-4826Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and strongly reinforces the hypothesis that L channels are principally responsible for the variations of [Ca2+]cobserved upon stimulation of glomerulosa cells with physiological concentrations of extracellular K+. Surprisingly, despite the fact that Ptx treatment maintained higher levels of [Ca2+]c upon stimulation with AngII, aldosterone production was significantly reduced (Fig. 7). This result suggests that either the negative feedback exerted by AngII on the [Ca2+]c signal induced by K+, or another factor controlled by a Ptx-sensitive G protein, is required for an optimal steroidogenic response. Relevant to this point is the suggestion by Barrett et al. (12Barrett P.Q. Ertel E.A. Smith M.M. Nee J.J. Cohen C.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C985-C992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that Ca2+influx through L-type channels could exert a negative action on the steroidogenic function of bovine glomerulosa cells. Nevertheless, because pertussis toxin also negatively affects aldosterone production at relatively low [Ca2+]c(expected to occur at basal extracellular K+ and concentrations of AngII as low as 0.1 nm; see Fig. 7), a bell-shaped dependence of steroidogenesis upon calcium is probably not the only explanation, and some still undetermined steroidogenic factor, controlled by a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein, could also be involved in this phenomenon. In rat glomerulosa cells, it has been shown that Ptx treatment helps AngII to maintain an optimal aldosterone secretion at supramaximal concentrations of the hormone but has no effect at lower AngII concentrations (28Hausdorff W.P. Sekura R.D. Aguilera G. Catt K.J. Endocrinology. 1987; 120: 1668-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This specific effect of Ptx in rat cells is presumably due to prevention of adenylyl cyclase inhibition by AngII through a Gi protein, although contradictory results in this species have been published by others (29Woodcock E.A. McLeod J.K. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 1697-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 30Gallo-Payet N. Chouinard L. Balestre M.-N. Guillon G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 81: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In bovine glomerulosa cells, Barrett and Isales (31Barrett P.Q. Isales C.M. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 799-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) have previously observed a 20% inhibition of the steroidogenic response to 10 nmAngII after treatment with Ptx, a result that is in complete agreement with our own observation (Fig. 7). Both Gi and Go proteins appear to be expressed in bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells (Fig. 8), but pertussis toxin does not allow to discriminate between the respective functions of each of these proteins. Nevertheless, in other cell types, Goproteins have been generally shown to negatively modulate L-type channels, whereas in contrast, Gi protein activation is often associated with a direct (cAMP-independent) increase of the activity of these channels (21Hescheler J. Schulz G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1993; 3: 360-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 25Hescheler J. Rosenthal W. Hinsch K.-D. Wulfern M. Trautwein W. Schulz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 32Degtiar V.E. Harhammer R. Nurnberg B. J. Physiol. 1997; 502: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we and others have recently shown that in bovine glomerulosa cells, AngII does not inhibit but rather potentiates cAMP production (33Baukal A.J. Hunyady L. Catt K.J. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24546-24549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Burnay M.M. Vallotton M.B. Capponi A.M. Rossier M.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), suggesting a poor coupling between the AT1 receptor and some Gi protein in these cells. These two facts would therefore indirectly favor the involvement of a Go protein in the negative modulation of L-type channels by AngII in bovine glomerulosa cells. In conclusion, the negative modulation of [Ca2+]chomeostasis exerted by AngII in bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells reflects the inhibition of L-type Ca2+ channels by this hormone. Moreover, the inhibition of these channels involves a Ptx-sensitive G protein, presumably of the Go family, linked to the AT1 receptor subtype (Fig.9). It therefore appears that the same hormone, through the same receptor, is able to inhibit different types of Ca2+ channels in the cell through distinct mechanisms: T channel activity is negatively modulated through PKC activation, whereas L channels are partially closed via a Ptx-sensitive G protein. This differential control by AngII of Ca2+ entry occurring through various channels should probably represent an advantage for the cell in view of the growing evidence that different types of Ca2+ channels exert distinct functions in glomerulosa cells. We are particularly grateful to G. Dorenter and W. Dimeck for excellent technical assistance."

Apart from serving as the physiological electron donor to dinitrogenase, NifH is involved in iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMo-co) biosynthesis and in maturation of the FeMo-co-deficient form of apodinitrogenase to a FeMo-co-activable form (apodinitrogenase maturation).

J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9339-9342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), dinitrogenase (MoFe protein or NifKD) and dinitrogenase reductase (Fe protein or NifH). Dinitrogenase is an α2β2 tetramer encoded by thenifD and nifK genes, respectively (2Roberts G.P. MacNeil T. MacNeil D. Brill W.J. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 136: 267-279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and is associated with two types of metal clusters, the P-clusters and the iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMo-co1; Refs. 3Madden M.S.

NifH is a homodimer with a single 4Fe-4S cluster ligated to the dimer via Cys97 and Cys132 from each subunit (7Hausinger R.P. Howard J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13486-13492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NifH has at least three distinct roles in the nitrogenase enzyme system (8Allen R.M. Chatterjee R. Madden M. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. Crit. Rev. Biotechnol. 1994; 14: 225-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). First, it serves as the obligate physiological electron donor to dinitrogenase during nitrogenase turnover (9Ljones T. Burris R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 275: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The role of NifH in nitrogenase turnover has been well documented. The sequence of events leading to the transfer of electrons from NifH to dinitrogenase is known as the “Fe protein cycle” (10Thorneley R.N.F. Ashby G.A.K.F. Lowe D.J. ACS Symp. Ser. 1993; 535: 290-302Crossref Google Scholar). NifH itself is reduced by either flavodoxin or ferredoxin in vivo or by dithionitein vitro. The reduced NifH binds two molecules of MgATP and undergoes a conformational change (11Zumft W.G. Mortenson L.E. Palmer G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 46: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) that affects several properties of NifH, including the reduction of midpoint potential of the 4Fe-4S cluster as well as its ability to interact with dinitrogenase (12Seefeldt L.C. Morgan T.V. Dean D.R. Mortenson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6680-6688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MgATP hydrolysis is then coupled to a one-electron transfer from NifH to dinitrogenase. The complex dissociates, and the molecules of MgADP bound to NifH are now exchanged for MgATP. This cycle continues until a sufficient number of electrons accumulate on dinitrogenase for the reduction of N2. The features of NifH required for this function include the ability of NifH (i) to interact with low potential electron donors, (ii) to bind MgATP, (iii) to undergo the nucleotide-induced conformational change, (iv) to bind dinitrogenase, (v) to transfer electrons to dinitrogenase, and (vi) to hydrolyze MgATP. Altered forms of NifH that are unable to perform one or more of the above functions are completely nonfunctional in substrate reduction. Second, NifH is required for the biosynthesis of FeMo-co (13Shah V.K. Hoover T.R. Imperial J. Paustian T.D. Roberts G.P. Ludden P.W. Bothe H. de Bruijn F.J. Newton W.E.

Dean D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5963-5966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, NifX has been demonstrated to be required forin vitro FeMo-co synthesis, although its exact role is not known.2 The nifN and nifE gene products together form a tetrameric protein that shows a high sequence similarity to the nifK and nifD gene products (20Dean D.R. Brigle K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5720-5723Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, NifNE has been postulated to form a scaffold upon which FeMo-co is synthesized (21Paustian T.D. Shah V.K. Roberts G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

NifH is also required for FeMo-co biosynthesis, but the exact role(s) it plays during cofactor biosynthesis is not clear. Third, NifH is involved in the maturation of apodinitrogenase (25Allen R.M. Homer M.J. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23670-23674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The subunit composition of apodinitrogenase in an A. vinelandiimutant carrying a deletion of nifH is tetrameric (α2β2) and is not FeMo-co-activable (25Allen R.M. Homer M.J. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W.

Chem. 1989; 264: 10088-10095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that the association of another protein, referred to as γ, with α2β2 apodinitrogenase is required for its in vitro activation by FeMo-co (25Allen R.M. Homer M.J. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23670-23674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). γ has been shown to function as a chaperone-insertase during the biosynthesis of dinitrogenase (27Homer M.J. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24745-24752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The processing of α2β2 apodinitrogenase to a FeMo-co-activable, α2β2γ2species is termed apodinitrogenase maturation. One role of NifH in apodinitrogenase maturation is that it mediates the association of γ2 with α2β2 apodinitrogenase in the presence of MgATP. Interestingly, His-tagged versions of α2β2 apodinitrogenase do not seem to require γ for activation by purified FeMo-co (28Christiansen J. Goodwin P.J. Lanzilotta W.N. Seefeldt L.C. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12611-12623Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The roles of NifH in FeMo-co biosynthesis and in apodinitrogenase maturation are not well understood, and the features of NifH required for its function in the above processes are not known. Certain A. vinelandii mutants contain altered forms of NifH that are impaired not only in catalysis but also in FeMo-co synthesis and in apodinitrogenase maturation. For example, A. vinelandiistrain UW97 (25Allen R.M. Homer M.J. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23670-23674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Pulakat L. Hausman B.S. Lei S. Gavini N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1884-1889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) produces an altered form of NifH (S44F) that is nonfunctional in all three processes. However, several A. vinelandii mutants containing altered forms of NifH impaired in substrate reduction have been shown to perform both FeMo-co synthesis and apodinitrogenase maturation. The A157S, M156C, R101H, and D125E forms of NifH have been shown to be inactive or substantially impaired in substrate reduction but active in FeMo-co synthesis and apodinitrogenase maturation in vivo as indicated by the presence of active dinitrogenase in these mutant strains (30Gavini N.

The A157S NifH has been shown to bind MgATP but is unable to undergo the nucleotide-induced conformational change or to transfer electrons to dinitrogenase and hydrolyze MgATP; yet it is able to synthesize catalytically active dinitrogenase (30Gavini N. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21179-21186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, D125E NifH is impaired in MgATP hydrolysis but is fully functional in the biosynthesis and insertion of FeMo-co into apodinitrogenase (34Wolle D. Dean D.R. Howard J.B. Science. 1992; 258: 992-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The ability of these forms of NifH, impaired in catalysis and with altered MgATP reactivities, to function in FeMo-co synthesis and apodinitrogenase maturation strongly suggests a role(s) for NifH independent of its role in substrate reduction. We have reported previously that the presence of a redox-active 4Fe-4S cluster in NifH is not required for its function in FeMo-co synthesis and in apodinitrogenase maturation (35Rangaraj P. Shah V.K. Ludden P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11250-11255Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This is further evidence in support of distinct roles for NifH in nitrogenase turnover, FeMo-co biosynthesis, and apodinitrogenase maturation. In an attempt to identify the features of NifH required for its function in FeMo-co synthesis and apodinitrogenase maturation, altered forms of the enzyme generated by site-directed mutagenesis were tested for their ability to function in in vitro FeMo-co synthesis and apodinitrogenase maturation reactions. Here, we report that the ability of NifH to perform MgATP hydrolysis (required in electron transfer) is not required for its function in FeMo-co biosynthesis and apodinitrogenase maturation. The features of NifH required for its function in apodinitrogenase maturation seem to be distinct from those required for its function in FeMo-co synthesis. This observation supports the hypothesis that NifH contains distinct domains that enable it to perform each of the above mentioned processes independently. Therefore, a mutation in a region that renders NifH inactive for one function may not affect its ability to function in the other processes.

All of the altered forms of NifH were purified to homogeneity as judged by analysis on SDS gels stained with Coomassie Blue. FeMo-co synthesis reactions were carried out as described by Shah et al. (45Shah V.K. Imperial J. Ugalde R.A. Ludden P.W. Brill W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1636-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To 9-ml serum vials, flushed with purified argon and rinsed with anaerobic Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer, were added the following: 100 μl of anaerobic Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 nmol of sodium molybdate, 100 nmol of homocitrate, 200 μl of an ATP-regenerating mixture (containing 3.6 mm ATP, 6.3 mm MgCl2, 51 mm creatine phosphate, 20 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 6.3 mm sodium dithionite), 200 μl of extract (2 mg of protein) of strain UW97 (as a source of NifNE, NifB cofactor, γ, and α2β2 apodinitrogenase), and purified wild-type or site-specifically altered NifH (50 μg of protein). It should be noted that the A. vinelandii strain UW97 contains an altered form of NifH (S44F) that is incapable of either FeMo-co synthesis or apodinitrogenase maturation (25Allen R.M. Homer M.J.

However, the presence of this altered form of NifH does not interfere with either FeMo-co synthesis or apodinitrogenase maturation reactions carried out by either the wild type or other altered NifHs. After the FeMo-co synthesis/insertion phase of 35 min, 10 nmol of (NH4)2MoS4 were added to each of the assays to prevent further FeMo-co insertion into apodinitrogenase, since MoS42− has been shown to bind apodinitrogenase irreversibly (46Shah V.K. Ugalde R.A. Imperial J. Brill W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3891-3894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Acetylene reduction was initiated by the addition of excess MgATP, purified wild-type NifH (0.1 mg of protein), and acetylene. Nitrogenase activity was then quantitated by acetylene reduction as described elsewhere (46Shah V.K. Ugalde R.A. Imperial J. Brill W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3891-3894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NifH-dependent binding of γ to the α2β2 form of apodinitrogenase was monitored by anti-γ immunoblots. The appearance of anti-γ cross-reactive material in the position of α2β2γ2 apodinitrogenase was taken as evidence of association of free γ2 with α2β2 apodinitrogenase. Nine-ml serum vials were evacuated and flushed repeatedly with purified argon and rinsed with anaerobic Tris-HCl. The following were then added to appropriate vials: 100 μl of anaerobic Tris-HCl or 100 μl of an ATP-regenerating mixture (as described above); 200 μl (2 mg of protein) of extract of strain UW97 (as a source of α2β2 apodinitrogenase and γ2), and wild-type or site-specifically altered NifH (45 μg of protein) in a total volume of 500 μl. The mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, after which they were placed on ice. Aliquots (20 μl) of the reaction mixtures were subjected to anoxic native gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting using anti-γ antibody, as described below. FeMo-co synthesis assays were carried out as described above, except that 200 μl of desalted extract (∼2.5 mg of protein) of strain CA11.1 (ΔnifHDKΔvnfDGK::spc) was used as a source of the components required for FeMo-co synthesis. The vials were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, after which they were placed on ice. Aliquots (20 μl) of the reaction mixtures were subjected to anoxic native gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting using anti-γ antibody. Proteins were separated on anaerobic native gels with a 7–14% acrylamide and 0–20% sucrose gradient as described previously (25Allen R.M. Homer M.J. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. Shah V.K.

Besides serving as the physiological electron donor to dinitrogenase during catalysis, NifH is involved in the biosynthesis of FeMo-co (13Shah V.K. Hoover T.R. Imperial J. Paustian T.D. Roberts G.P.

In an attempt to identify the features of NifH required for its function in FeMo-co synthesis and in apodinitrogenase maturation, altered forms of the enzyme generated by site-directed mutagenesis were used in place of the wild-type enzyme in the in vitroFeMo-co synthesis assays and apodinitrogenase maturation reactions. Six altered forms of NifH were used in this study: K15R, D39N, D43N, L127Δ, D129E, and F135Y. Table I lists the properties of these altered forms of the enzyme, and Fig.1 shows the positions of Lys15, Asp39, Asp43, Asp129, Leu127, and Phe135 in the NifH structure (49Georgiadis M.M. Komiya H.

All of the above mentioned altered forms of NifH accumulate in the “native” form as judged by the presence of a normal 4Fe-4S cluster (40Ryle M.J. Lanzilotta W.N. Mortenson L.E. Watt G.D.

The Switch I and II regions play important roles in the communication between the nucleotide binding site of NifH and the 4Fe-4S cluster (42Ryle M. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4766-4775Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 50Renner K.A. Howard J.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5353-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab It has been shown in previous work that Lys15 is a part of the amino acid sequence, termed the “Walker A motif” or the “P-loop,” that is known to function in nucleotide binding (12Seefeldt L.C. Morgan T.V. Dean D.R. Mortenson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6680-6688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lys15 has been shown to play a major role in both NifH interaction with the γ-phosphate of MgATP and in the MgATP-induced conformational change. K15R NifH showed no detectable binding to MgATP and an extremely low affinity for MgADP (40Ryle M.J. Lanzilotta W.N. Mortenson L.E. Watt G.D. Seefeldt L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13112-13117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This altered form of NifH was also found to be inactive in electron transfer to dinitrogenase, in MgATP hydrolysis, and in substrate reduction (Table I, first line) (40Ryle M.J. Lanzilotta W.N. Mortenson L.E. Watt G.D. Seefeldt L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13112-13117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In order to determine if K15R NifH could function in FeMo-co biosynthesis, it was used in place of wild-type NifH in in vitro FeMo-co synthesis assays. Assays using K15R NifH for FeMo-co synthesis showed minimal (background) acetylene reduction activity when compared with the wild-type NifH (data not shown). The in vitro FeMo-co synthesis reaction monitors the activity of the newly formed dinitrogenase and thus is a measure of both the amount of FeMo-co synthesized and the amount of FeMo-co inserted into apodinitrogenase. Therefore, these assays monitor the ability of the altered forms of NifH to function in both FeMo-co synthesis and in apodinitrogenase maturation. There exists the possibility that these altered enzymes are impaired in their ability to carry out apodinitrogenase maturation yet are perfectly capable of carrying out FeMo-co synthesis and consequently do not show detectable activity by the in vitro FeMo-co synthesis assay. To address this possibility, the γ gel shift assay was used to monitor the ability of the altered forms of NifH to function in FeMo-co synthesis. In the absence of FeMo-co,"

For this purpose, a precursor peptide was used (SP+7), corresponding to the signal sequence of PhoE with the first seven amino acids of the mature part that can be processed by purified leader peptidase. Translocation was studied in pure lipid vesicles containing leader peptidase, with its active site inside the vesicles. In the presence of a positive inside Δψ, the amount of processing of SP+7 was significantly higher than without a Δψ, indicating that the translocation of the cleavage region is stimulated by Δψ. Replacement of the helix-breaking glycine residue at position −10 in the signal sequence for a leucine abolished the effect of Δψ on the translocation of the cleavage region. It is concluded that Δψ directly acts on the wild type signal sequence by stimulating the translocation of its C terminus.

During or shortly after translocation, leader peptidase (Lep)1 removes the signal sequence from the precursor protein. The catalytic site of Lep is located in a large periplasmic domain (the P2 loop) that can penetrate between lipids with a specificity for phosphatidylethanolamine (6van Klompenburg W. Paetzel M. de Jong J.M. Dalbey R.E. Demel R.A. von Heijne G. de Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The energy for translocation is derived from ATP hydrolysis by SecA and the protonmotive force (pmf), that is composed of an electrical component, Δψ, and a proton gradient, ΔpH (positive and acidic in the periplasm). The pmf plays a role in both early and late steps of translocation (7Schiebel E. Driessen A.J. Hartl F.U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 8Nouwen N. de Kruijff B. Tommassen J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1205-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Signal sequences are involved in various stages of the secretion pathway. They are necessary to target the precursor protein into the secretion machinery, and they retard folding of the nascent polypeptide, thereby increasing the time for the preprotein to stay in a translocation competent conformation (9Park S. Liu G. Topping T.B. Cover W.H. Randall L.L. Science. 1988; 239: 1033-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In early steps of translocation, the signal sequence is shown to interact with SecA (10Akita M. Sasaki S. Matsuyama S. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8164-8169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), SecE, and SecY (11Hartl F.U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The signal sequence was also shown to interact with Ffh protein, a component of the bacterial analogue of the signal recognition particle (12Luirink J. High S. Wood H. Giner A. Tollervey D. Dobberstein B. Nature. 1992; 359: 741-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Furthermore, signal sequences can interact with the phospholipids of the inner membrane, both in Sec-dependent (13Phoenix D.A. Kusters R. Hikita C. Mizushima S. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17069-17073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Sec-independent translocation, as was observed for M13 procoat protein (14Watts C. Silver P. Wickner W. Cell. 1981; 25: 347-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 15Kusters R. Breukink E. Gallusser A. Kuhn A. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1560-1563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From circular dichroism (CD) studies with different synthetic signal peptides, it was derived that upon interaction with anionic lipids the signal peptide undergoes a conformational change and adopts an α-helical structure that may be essential for its functionality (16Emr S.D. Silhavy T.J. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4599-4603Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 17Briggs M.S. Gierasch L.M. Zlotnick A. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F.

NMR studies of the signal peptides of OmpA (20Rizo J. Blanco F.J. Kobe B. Bruch M.D. Gierasch L.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4881-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), LamB (21Wang Z. Jones J.D. Rizo J. Gierasch L.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13991-13999Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and PhoE (22Chupin V. Killian J.A. Breg J. de Jongh H. Boelens R. Kaptein R. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11617-11624Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) showed that the α-helix conformation is disrupted toward the C-terminal end of the hydrophobic core near a helix breaking residue. Such residues are frequently found in signal sequences, like for example glycine at position −10 (Gly−10) in the signal sequence of the outer membrane protein PhoE.Translocation of PhoE was found to be largely stimulated by the pmf (8Nouwen N. de Kruijff B. Tommassen J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1205-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Remarkably, a single mutation of the Gly−10 for an α-helix promoting residue such as leucine abolished the pmf dependence for translocation. In this study, we investigate the possibility that the pmf can directly act on a signal sequence. For this purpose, we use the signal peptide of PhoE with the first part of the mature protein as a precursor peptide in a simplified reconstitution system with purified Lep, active only inside the vesicles. We demonstrate that the translocation of the cleavage region of the signal sequence across the bilayer is largely stimulated in the presence of Δψ. This stimulating effect was not observed with an analogous precursor peptide in which the Gly−10 was replaced by a Leu residue. This demonstrates that Δψ can directly and specifically act on the signal sequence and suggests that Δψ affects the stretching of the signal sequence into a transmembrane conformation and thereby facilitates initiation of translocation.DISCUSSIONTranslocation of proteins across the inner membrane of E. coli depends on the pmf. Previous studies have shown that mutations in the signal sequence (8Nouwen N. de Kruijff B. Tommassen J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1205-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and directly after the cleavage site (37Lu H.M. Yamada H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9977-9982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Geller B. Zhu H.Y. Cheng S. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9442-9447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) affect the pmf dependence of translocation, suggesting an involvement of the pmf early in translocation. However, whether the pmf directly acts on the signal sequence remained unclear, because effects via components of the secretion machinery could not be excluded. This study provides the first evidence that the electrical component of the pmf (Δψ) can directly act on the signal sequence and stimulates the translocation of the cleavage region, in a way that is strikingly dependent on the presence of the helix-breaking residue in the hydrophobic region. The precursor peptide, analogous to the signal sequence of PhoE with the first seven amino acids of the mature part, was found to be processed in the lumen of the Lep-containing reconstitution vesicles, demonstrating the translocation of the cleavage region across the lipid bilayer. This was largely stimulated by the presence of a positive inside Δψ (corresponding to the situation in E. coli). A reversed Δψ inhibited the translocation. These results cannot be ascribed to an effect of Δψ on Lep, because it was shown that the replacement of the helix disrupting Gly at position −10 by a Leu abolished the effect of Δψ on translocation. Upon translocation, the positively charged N terminus stays most likely anchored to the side of the membrane were it was added, as a result of electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged lipids (13Phoenix D.A. Kusters R. Hikita C. Mizushima S. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17069-17073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and because it is energetically highly unfavorable to move it across the lipid bilayer, especially against the direction of the positive inside Δψ (39Flewelling R.F. Hubbell W.L. Biophys. J. 1986; 49: 541-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar).Many studies have shown a stimulating effect of the membrane potential on translocation of parts of a protein. In E. coli, M13 procoat protein needs the pmf for translocation of the periplasmic region (40Date T. Goodman J.M. Wickner W.T. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4669-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 41Kuhn A. Rohrer J. Gallusser A. J. Struct. Biol. 1990; 104: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and translocation of N-terminal domains requires the pmf when the hydrophobicity of the first transmembrane domain is low (42Delgado-Partin V.M. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9927-9934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In mitochondria, Δψ is required for the translocation of mitochondrial presequences (43Roise D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 608-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Also in other biological processes, translocation of parts of proteins occurs under influence of a membrane potential, such as in the gating of pore-forming colicins and in the working mechanism of some toxins (44Merrill A.R. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8529-8534Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 45Slatin S.L. Qiu X.Q. Jakes K.S. Finkelstein A. Nature. 1994; 371: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 46Hudson T.H. Scharff J. Kimak M.A. Neville Jr., D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4773-4781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In all situations the effect of the membrane potential could be explained by electrophoretic forces on charged residues in the translocated domains. We propose a similar mechanism to explain our data: Δψ can act on the C-terminal part of the precursor peptide, which contains an excess of negative charges. In agreement with such a mechanism an acidic residue is often found at position +2 of the mature sequence in bacterial precursor proteins (47von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). An additional possibility could be that Δψ acts on the helix dipole moment, which is negative on the C-terminal part of the α-helix of the signal sequence.Before presenting a molecular model for the observed effects, it is important to recall what is known about the conformational behavior of the PhoE signal sequence and its relation to the pmf dependence of translocation. Translocation of prePhoE is highly dependent on the pmf. Strikingly, the pmf dependence is relieved by a single mutation in the signal sequence replacing Gly−10 for different helix stabilizing residues (8Nouwen N. de Kruijff B. Tommassen J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1205-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This strongly suggests that the pmf dependence in translocation of precursor proteins is related to the conformational behavior of the signal sequence. Our study provides two important results in favor of such explanation. First, introduction of a helix-promoting Leu in the signal sequence abolished the effect of Δψ on translocation across the lipid bilayer of the C terminus of the precursor peptide, which is in accordance with the observed pmf independence of translocation of the corresponding prePhoE mutant across the inner membrane (8Nouwen N. de Kruijff B. Tommassen J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1205-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Second, the monolayer results demonstrate that the mode of insertion into a hydrophobic environment is largely affected by the Gly to Leu substitution. Wild type SP+7 displayed a two-phase kinetics of monolayer insertion, as previously observed for the wild type signal peptide. This has been explained as the initial insertion in a looped conformation, which changes to an extended α-helix (32Batenburg A.M. Demel R.A. Verkleij A.J. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5678-5685Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, SP+7 G(−10)L is inserted into the monolayer in one step. The lack of the second phase suggests that it penetrates into the lipids directly in a stable α-helical conformation. In a previous study, two-dimensional NMR analysis of the wild type PhoE signal sequence in SDS micelles showed a clear destabilization of the helix around Gly−10 (22Chupin V. Killian J.A. Breg J. de Jongh H. Boelens R. Kaptein R. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11617-11624Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). CD measurements of both precursor peptides in the same system (not shown), performed as described in (22Chupin V. Killian J.A. Breg J. de Jongh H. Boelens R. Kaptein R. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11617-11624Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), with a 1:100 peptide:detergent molar ratio, showed a 10% higher α-helical content for SP+7 G(−10)L than for wild type SP+7 (67 and 57%, respectively) as determined according to the method of Greenfield and Fasman (48Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3302) Google Scholar). This supports our proposal that SP+7 G(−10)L most likely contains a more stable, extended α-helix in a membrane environment. A speculative model to explain these observations is presented in Fig.7. It proposes that the wild type signal sequence initially adopts a destabilized helix that can partially insert into the membrane, which converts into a transmembrane helical conformation, which process is highly facilitated by the transmembrane potential. When a helix-promoting residue is present at the position of Gly−10, the extended transmembrane orientation is achieved rapidly, even without a transmembrane potential.Studies in the analogous eukaryotic secretion system have provided strong evidence that the signal sequence early in translocation is functional in a transmembrane orientation (49Plath K. Mothes W. Wilkinson B.M. Stirling C.J. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1998; 94: 795-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The model poses an intriguing question; why did nature bother to use a helix-breaking residue in the signal sequence if only a transmembrane state is essential? Because the signal sequence interacts with many proteins of the translocation machinery, including SecA, the SecYEG complex, the lipids, and Lep, it might be essential that the signal sequence needs a certain conformational flexibility to be able to undergo all these distinct interactions. The presence of the Gly residue might be a good compromise for efficient functioning in all stages of the process. It should be realized that the pmf also acts on the translocase and possibly sets it in a more relaxed conformation (50Nouwen N. de Kruijff B. Tommassen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5953-5957Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It is therefore an attractive possibility that the pmf acts in concert on the signal sequence and the translocase.In conclusion, we propose that Δψ in the prokaryotic secretion pathway acts on the signal sequence by stretching it into a transmembrane conformation and thereby initiating the translocation of the mature part of a precursor protein across the membrane. Proteins destined for export out of the cell are synthesized as precursor proteins with an N-terminal extension, the signal sequence. Signal sequences are composed of a positively charged N-terminal region, followed by a hydrophobic core region of 7–13 residues and a more polar C terminus containing the signal peptidase cleavage site (1von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, the signal sequence is necessary and in most cases sufficient for translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane. Most periplasmic and outer membrane proteins in E. coli are translocated through the general secretion machinery (for a recent review, see Ref. 2Driessen A.J.M. Fekkes P. van der Wolk J.P.W. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The central part of this translocase comprises the peripheral membrane subunit SecA and the integral membrane protein complex SecYEG. Besides proteinaceous components, negatively charged lipids (3de Vrije T. de Swart R. Dowhan W. Tommassen J. de Kruijff B. Nature. 1988; 334: 173-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 4Kusters R. Dowhan W. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8659-8662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and nonbilayer lipids (5Rietveld A.G. Koorengevel M.C. de Kruijff B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5506-5513Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) are essential for efficient translocation. During or shortly after translocation, leader peptidase (Lep)1 removes the signal sequence from the precursor protein. The catalytic site of Lep is located in a large periplasmic domain (the P2 loop) that can penetrate between lipids with a specificity for phosphatidylethanolamine (6van Klompenburg W. Paetzel M. de Jong J.M. Dalbey R.E. Demel R.A. von Heijne G. de Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The energy for translocation is derived from ATP hydrolysis by SecA and the protonmotive force (pmf), that is composed of an electrical component, Δψ, and a proton gradient, ΔpH (positive and acidic in the periplasm). The pmf plays a role in both early and late steps of translocation (7Schiebel E. Driessen A.J. Hartl F.U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 8Nouwen N. de Kruijff B. Tommassen J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1205-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Signal sequences are involved in various stages of the secretion pathway. They are necessary to target the precursor protein into the secretion machinery, and they retard folding of the nascent polypeptide, thereby increasing the time for the preprotein to stay in a translocation competent conformation (9Park S. Liu G. Topping T.B. Cover W.H. Randall L.L. Science. 1988; 239: 1033-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In early steps of translocation, the signal sequence is shown to interact with SecA (10Akita M. Sasaki S. Matsuyama S. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8164-8169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), SecE, and SecY (11Hartl F.U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The signal sequence was also shown to interact with Ffh protein, a component of the bacterial analogue of the signal recognition particle (12Luirink J. High S. Wood H. Giner A. Tollervey D. Dobberstein B. Nature. 1992; 359: 741-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Furthermore, signal sequences can interact with the phospholipids of the inner membrane, both in Sec-dependent (13Phoenix D.A. Kusters R. Hikita C. Mizushima S. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17069-17073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Sec-independent translocation, as was observed for M13 procoat protein (14Watts C. Silver P. Wickner W.

From circular dichroism (CD) studies with different synthetic signal peptides, it was derived that upon interaction with anionic lipids the signal peptide undergoes a conformational change and adopts an α-helical structure that may be essential for its functionality (16Emr S.D.

Kaptein R. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11617-11624Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) showed that the α-helix conformation is disrupted toward the C-terminal end of the hydrophobic core near a helix breaking residue. Such residues are frequently found in signal sequences, like for example glycine at position −10 (Gly−10) in the signal sequence of the outer membrane protein PhoE. Translocation of PhoE was found to be largely stimulated by the pmf (8Nouwen N. de Kruijff B. Tommassen J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1205-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Remarkably, a single mutation of the Gly−10 for an α-helix promoting residue such as leucine abolished the pmf dependence for translocation. In this study, we investigate the possibility that the pmf can directly act on a signal sequence. For this purpose, we use the signal peptide of PhoE with the first part of the mature protein as a precursor peptide in a simplified reconstitution system with purified Lep, active only inside the vesicles. We demonstrate that the translocation of the cleavage region of the signal sequence across the bilayer is largely stimulated in the presence of Δψ. This stimulating effect was not observed with an analogous precursor peptide in which the Gly−10 was replaced by a Leu residue. This demonstrates that Δψ can directly and specifically act on the signal sequence and suggests that Δψ affects the stretching of the signal sequence into a transmembrane conformation and thereby facilitates initiation of translocation. DISCUSSIONTranslocation of proteins across the inner membrane of E. coli depends on the pmf. Previous studies have shown that mutations in the signal sequence (8Nouwen N. de Kruijff B. Tommassen J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1205-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and directly after the cleavage site (37Lu H.M. Yamada H. Mizushima S. J. Biol.

However, whether the pmf directly acts on the signal sequence remained unclear, because effects via components of the secretion machinery could not be excluded. This study provides the first evidence that the electrical component of the pmf (Δψ) can directly act on the signal sequence and stimulates the translocation of the cleavage region, in a way that is strikingly dependent on the presence of the helix-breaking residue in the hydrophobic region. The precursor peptide, analogous to the signal sequence of PhoE with the first seven amino acids of the mature part, was found to be processed in the lumen of the Lep-containing reconstitution vesicles, demonstrating the translocation of the cleavage region across the lipid bilayer. This was largely stimulated by the presence of a positive inside Δψ (corresponding to the situation in E. coli). A reversed Δψ inhibited the translocation. These results cannot be ascribed to an effect of Δψ on Lep, because it was shown that the replacement of the helix disrupting Gly at position −10 by a Leu abolished the effect of Δψ on translocation. Upon translocation, the positively charged N terminus stays most likely anchored to the side of the membrane were it was added, as a result of electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged lipids (13Phoenix D.A. Kusters R. Hikita C. Mizushima S. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17069-17073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and because it is energetically highly unfavorable to move it across the lipid bilayer, especially against the direction of the positive inside Δψ (39Flewelling R.F. Hubbell W.L. Biophys. J. 1986; 49: 541-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar).Many studies have shown a stimulating effect of the membrane potential on translocation of parts of a protein. In E. coli, M13 procoat protein needs the pmf for translocation of the periplasmic region (40Date T. Goodman J.M. Wickner W.T. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4669-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 41Kuhn A. Rohrer J. Gallusser A. J. Struct. Biol. 1990; 104: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and translocation of N-terminal domains requires the pmf when the hydrophobicity of the first transmembrane domain is low (42Delgado-Partin V.M. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9927-9934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In mitochondria, Δψ is required for the translocation of mitochondrial presequences (43Roise D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 608-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Also in other biological processes, translocation of parts of proteins occurs under influence of a membrane potential, such as in the gating of pore-forming colicins and in the working mechanism of some toxins (44Merrill A.R. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8529-8534Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 45Slatin S.L. Qiu X.Q. Jakes K.S. Finkelstein A.

Chem. 1988; 263: 4773-4781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In all situations the effect of the membrane potential could be explained by electrophoretic forces on charged residues in the translocated domains. We propose a similar mechanism to explain our data: Δψ can act on the C-terminal part of the precursor peptide, which contains an excess of negative charges. In agreement with such a mechanism an acidic residue is often found at position +2 of the mature sequence in bacterial precursor proteins (47von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). An additional possibility could be that Δψ acts on the helix dipole moment, which is negative on the C-terminal part of the α-helix of the signal sequence.Before presenting a molecular model for the observed effects, it is important to recall what is known about the conformational behavior of the PhoE signal sequence and its relation to the pmf dependence of translocation. Translocation of prePhoE is highly dependent on the pmf. Strikingly, the pmf dependence is relieved by a single mutation in the signal sequence replacing Gly−10 for different helix stabilizing residues (8Nouwen N. de Kruijff B. Tommassen J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1205-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This strongly suggests that the pmf dependence in translocation of precursor proteins is related to the conformational behavior of the signal sequence. Our study provides two important results in favor of such explanation. First, introduction of a helix-promoting Leu in the signal sequence abolished the effect of Δψ on translocation across the lipid bilayer of the C terminus of the precursor peptide, which is in accordance with the observed pmf independence of translocation of the corresponding prePhoE mutant across the inner membrane (8Nouwen N. de Kruijff B. Tommassen J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1205-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Second, the monolayer results demonstrate that the mode of insertion into a hydrophobic environment is largely affected by the Gly to Leu substitution. Wild type SP+7 displayed a two-phase kinetics of monolayer insertion, as previously observed for the wild type signal peptide. This has been explained as the initial insertion in a looped conformation, which changes to an extended α-helix (32Batenburg A.M. Demel R.A. Verkleij A.J. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5678-5685Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, SP+7 G(−10)L is inserted into the monolayer in one step. The lack of the second phase suggests that it penetrates into the lipids directly in a stable α-helical conformation. In a previous study, two-dimensional NMR analysis of the wild type PhoE signal sequence in SDS micelles showed a clear destabilization of the helix around Gly−10 (22Chupin V. Killian J.A. Breg J. de Jongh H. Boelens R. Kaptein R. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11617-11624Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). CD measurements of both precursor peptides in the same system (not shown), performed as described in (22Chupin V. Killian J.A. Breg J. de Jongh H. Boelens R. Kaptein R. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11617-11624Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), with a 1:100 peptide:detergent molar ratio, showed a 10% higher α-helical content for SP+7 G(−10)L than for wild type SP+7 (67 and 57%, respectively) as determined according to the method of Greenfield and Fasman (48Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3302) Google Scholar). This supports our proposal that SP+7 G(−10)L most likely contains a more stable, extended α-helix in a membrane environment. A speculative model to explain these observations is presented in Fig.7. It proposes that the wild type signal sequence initially adopts a destabilized helix that can partially insert into the membrane, which converts into a transmembrane helical conformation, which process is highly facilitated by the transmembrane potential. When a helix-promoting residue is present at the position of Gly−10, the extended transmembrane orientation is achieved rapidly, even without a transmembrane potential.Studies in the analogous eukaryotic secretion system have provided strong evidence that the signal sequence early in translocation is functional in a transmembrane orientation (49Plath K. Mothes W. Wilkinson B.M. Stirling C.J. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1998; 94: 795-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The model poses an intriguing question; why did nature bother to use a helix-breaking residue in the signal sequence if only a transmembrane state is essential? Because the signal sequence interacts with many proteins of the translocation machinery, including SecA, the SecYEG complex, the lipids, and Lep, it might be essential that the signal sequence needs a certain conformational flexibility to be able to undergo all these distinct interactions. The presence of the Gly residue might be a good compromise for efficient functioning in all stages of the process. It should be realized that the pmf also acts on the translocase and possibly sets it in a more relaxed conformation (50Nouwen N. de Kruijff B. Tommassen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5953-5957Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It is therefore an attractive possibility that the pmf acts in concert on the signal sequence and the translocase.In conclusion, we propose that Δψ in the prokaryotic secretion pathway acts on the signal sequence by stretching it into a transmembrane conformation and thereby initiating the translocation of the mature part of a precursor protein across the membrane. Translocation of proteins across the inner membrane of E. coli depends on the pmf. Previous studies have shown that mutations in the signal sequence (8Nouwen N. de Kruijff B. Tommassen J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1205-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and directly after the cleavage site (37Lu H.M. Yamada H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9977-9982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Geller B. Zhu H.Y. Cheng S. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9442-9447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) affect the pmf dependence of translocation, suggesting an involvement of the pmf early in translocation. However, whether the pmf directly acts on the signal sequence remained unclear, because effects via components of the secretion machinery could not be excluded. This study provides the first evidence that the electrical component of the pmf (Δψ) can directly act on the signal sequence and stimulates the translocation of the cleavage region, in a way that is strikingly dependent on the presence of the helix-breaking residue in the hydrophobic region. The precursor peptide, analogous to the signal sequence of PhoE with the first seven amino acids of the mature part, was found to be processed in the lumen of the Lep-containing reconstitution vesicles, demonstrating the translocation of the cleavage region across the lipid bilayer. This was largely stimulated by the presence of a positive inside Δψ (corresponding to the situation in E. coli). A reversed Δψ inhibited the translocation. These results cannot be ascribed to an effect of Δψ on Lep, because it was shown that the replacement of the helix disrupting Gly at position −10 by a Leu abolished the effect of Δψ on translocation. Upon translocation, the positively charged N terminus stays most likely anchored to the side of the membrane were it was added, as a result of electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged lipids (13Phoenix D.A. Kusters R. Hikita C. Mizushima S. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17069-17073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and because it is energetically highly unfavorable to move it across the lipid bilayer, especially against the direction of the positive inside Δψ (39Flewelling R.F. Hubbell W.L. Biophys. J. 1986; 49: 541-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Many studies have shown a stimulating effect of the membrane potential on translocation of parts of a protein. In E. coli, M13 procoat protein needs the pmf for translocation of the periplasmic region (40Date T. Goodman J.M. Wickner W.T. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4669-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 41Kuhn A. Rohrer J. Gallusser A. J. Struct. Biol. 1990; 104: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and translocation of N-terminal domains requires the pmf when the hydrophobicity of the first transmembrane domain is low (42Delgado-Partin V.M. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9927-9934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In mitochondria, Δψ is required for the translocation of mitochondrial presequences (43Roise D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 608-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Also in other biological processes, translocation of parts of proteins occurs under influence of a membrane potential, such as in the gating of pore-forming colicins and in the working mechanism of some toxins (44Merrill A.R. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8529-8534Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 45Slatin S.L. Qiu X.Q. Jakes K.S. Finkelstein A. Nature. 1994; 371: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 46Hudson T.H. Scharff J. Kimak M.A. Neville Jr., D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4773-4781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In all situations the effect of the membrane potential could be explained by electrophoretic forces on charged residues in the translocated domains. We propose a similar mechanism to explain our data: Δψ can act on the C-terminal part of the precursor peptide, which contains an excess of negative charges. In agreement with such a mechanism an acidic residue is often found at position +2 of the mature sequence in bacterial precursor proteins (47von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). An additional possibility could be that Δψ acts on the helix dipole moment, which is negative on the C-terminal part of the α-helix of the signal sequence. Before presenting a molecular model for the observed effects, it is important to recall what is known about the conformational behavior of the PhoE signal sequence and its relation to the pmf dependence of translocation. Translocation of prePhoE is highly dependent on the pmf. Strikingly, the pmf dependence is relieved by a single mutation in the signal sequence replacing Gly−10 for different helix stabilizing residues (8Nouwen N. de Kruijff B. Tommassen J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1205-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This strongly suggests that the pmf dependence in translocation of precursor proteins is related to the conformational behavior of the signal sequence. Our study provides two important results in favor of such explanation. First, introduction of a helix-promoting Leu in the signal sequence abolished the effect of Δψ on translocation across the lipid bilayer of the C terminus of the precursor peptide, which is in accordance with the observed pmf independence of translocation of the corresponding prePhoE mutant across the inner membrane (8Nouwen N. de Kruijff B. Tommassen J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1205-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Second, the monolayer results demonstrate that the mode of insertion into a hydrophobic environment is largely affected by the Gly to Leu substitution. Wild type SP+7 displayed a two-phase kinetics of monolayer insertion, as previously observed for the wild type signal peptide. This has been explained as the initial insertion in a looped conformation, which changes to an extended α-helix (32Batenburg A.M. Demel R.A. Verkleij A.J. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5678-5685Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, SP+7 G(−10)L is inserted into the monolayer in one step.

CD measurements of both precursor peptides in the same system (not shown), performed as described in (22Chupin V. Killian J.A. Breg J. de Jongh H. Boelens R. Kaptein R. de Kruijff B.

In conclusion, we propose that Δψ in the prokaryotic secretion pathway acts on the signal sequence by stretching it into a transmembrane conformation and thereby initiating the translocation of the mature part of a precursor protein across the membrane.

We have shown that pol δ incorporates nucleotides close to a template biotin-streptavidin complex located 5′ (downstream) to the replicating complex in the presence or absence of PCNA. PCNA-dependent synthesis catalyzed by pol δ was nearly totally (95%) inhibited by a biotin·streptavidin complex located at the 3′-end of a template with a 15-mer primer (upstream of the replicating complex), but was only partially inhibited with a 19-mer primer. With either primer, PCNA-independent synthesis was not affected by the biotin·streptavidin complex. Quantification of results with primers of varying length suggested that pol δ interacts with between 8 and 10 nucleotides of duplex DNA immediately proximal to the 3′-OH primer terminus. Using UV photocross-linking, we determined that the 125-kDa subunit of pol δ, but not the 50-kDa subunit, interacted with a photosensitive residue of a substrate oligonucleotide. Interaction apparently takes place through the C terminus of p125. Based on these results, we conclude that PCNA is located “behind” pol δ in the polymerization complex during DNA synthesis and that only the large subunit of pol δ (two-subunit form) interacts directly with DNA.

Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a multifunctional protein, acts as an auxiliary factor of pol δ and dramatically increases the processivity of pol δ-catalyzed DNA synthesis (2Tan C.K.

The 29-kDa mammalian PCNA monomer forms a homotrimer (three monomers) of ring-like shape (homotrimeric toroid) that loads onto linear DNA without additional cofactors or that can be loaded onto closed circular or otherwise topologically constrained DNA by an another essential replication protein, replication factor C (RF-C) (4Krishna T.S.

However, the relative positions of proteins in the replication complex, their interactions with DNA, and their interactions with each other are just beginning to be determined. Despite much interest, the position of PCNA relative to pol δ during DNA synthesis is still unknown.

A functional analog of PCNA in the phage T4 replication holoenzyme complex, gp45, also forms a homotrimeric toroid and acts as a sliding clamp for gp43 DNA polymerase. Recent experiments showed that gp43 DNA polymerase binds to the side of the gp45 ring containing the C termini of gp45 monomers (13Latham G.J. Bacheller D.J. Pietroni P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol.

Cross-linking experiments with the holoenzyme of DNA polymerase III from Escherichia coli showed that another functional and structural analog of PCNA, the β-subunit, binds “behind” the polymerase catalytic subunit (α) in the initiation complex of the polymerase with an RNA-primed DNA template (14Reems J.A. Wood S. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5606-5613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this work, we describe a novel dynamic mapping method that was used to elucidate the relative positions of PCNA and pol δ during DNA synthesis. Here we show that PCNA is located behind pol δ when polymerization occurs. We think it likely that this methodology can also be used to study the relative positions of other proteins of the replication machinery. Results of photocross-linking experiments suggest that only the large subunit of pol δ (p125) interacts closely with DNA. The C-terminal domain of p125 is apparently responsible. We propose a detailed model of the pol δ·PCNA·DNA complex present during the polymerization reaction. A photosensitive analog of dTTP, 5-(N-(p-azidobenzoyl)-3-aminoallyl)-dUTP (AB-dUTP), was synthesized as described (15Bartholomew B. Durkovich D. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell.

Acrylamide and methylenebisacrylamide were from Eastman Organic Chemicals and were further purified by adsorption of impurities to activated charcoal. All other materials were of reagent grade and were used without further purification. A 50-mer template with bio-7-dAMP at position 11 (CTCTCGCGTC (bio-7-dA)CGGCTCGTC TCGTCTGCTC TCGGCTTGCT CGCTTGTGGC) was synthesized by extending the 10-mer CTCTCGCGTC with Pfu DNA polymerase using a complementary 50-mer as a template. The reaction mixture (50 μl) contained the standard Stratagene Pfu reaction buffer, 600 pmol of 10-mer, 20 pmol of 50-mer, 20 nmol of dCTP, 20 nmol of dGTP, 20 nmol of dTTP, 2 nmol of bio-7-dATP, and 2.5 units ofPfu DNA polymerase. 25 synthesis cycles were performed. Each cycle was as follows: 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 25 °C, and 1.5 min at 75 °C. The full-length 50-mer product was purified by PAGE in the presence of 7 m urea and was localized on the gel by the shadow cast during illumination with UV light. A 51-mer with bio-7-dAMP at position 51 was synthesized as follows. The 50-mer CTCTCGCGTC ACGGCTCGTC TCGTCTGCTC TCGGCTTGCT CGCTTGTGGC (without bio-7-dAMP) was extended by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase to a 51-mer with bio-7-dATP as a substrate.

Incubation was for 1 h at 37 °C. The desired product was purified by PAGE in the presence of 7m urea. Before UV treatment, all operations with photoreactive materials were performed in a room illuminated only by a 10-watt incandescent lamp. The 18-mer ATCCAACCTCG CGTCGTA (primer) was annealed to the 55-mer TTGACGACCC GATCTGATCC GATTCGATAC GACGCGAGGT TGGATGGGGG GGGGG. The 55-mer contains 10 dGMP residues at the 3′-end. They were added for better separation of the 45-mer final product and the 55-mer template during PAGE purification. The 18-mer primer was extended up to a 20-mer with AB-dUTP and [α-32P]dCTP. The reaction mixture (30 μl) contained 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 150 pmol each of 18-mer and 55-mer (3′-OH ends), 1 pmol of AB-dUMP, 1 pmol of [α-32P]dCTP (10 μCi), and 10 units of exo− Klenow fragment. The sample was incubated for 1 h at 16 °C; then 10 nmol each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP were added to the reaction, and the sample was incubated for another 4 h at 16 °C. The resulting 45-mer product (ATCCAACCTC GCGTCGTA(AB-dU)[32P]C GAATCGGATC AGATCGGGTC GTCAA) was purified by PAGE in the presence of 7m urea. The same procedure as described above was performed, but a mixture of eight primers of different length (8-mer, 13-mer, 18-mer, 23-mer, 28-mer, 33-mer, 38-mer, and 41-mer) complementary to the 55-mer template was used for synthesis of the 45-mer oligonucleotides. As a result, each 45-mer contained only one AB-dUMP residue and an adjacent (3′) [32P]dCMP. pol δ assays were performed essentially as described previously (17Ng L. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. Fisher P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11699-11704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primers were 5′-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Afterward, labeled primer was annealed to an unlabeled template. The standard reaction mixture for pol δ contained 40 mm BisTris (pH 6.7), 6 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Additional details are provided in the figure legends. Incubations were terminated by addition of standard stop solution, and aliquots were subjected to 12% PAGE in the presence of 7 m urea and 15% formamide. After electrophoresis, gels were subjected to autoradiography and/or Molecular Dynamics 445 SI PhosphorImager analyses. Reaction mixtures (9 μl) contained 0.5 pmol of photoreactive oligonucleotide (3′-OH ends; a 45-mer with AB-dUMP at position 11 and [α-32P]dCMP at position 12) or a mixture of eight photoreactive 45-mer templates each with an annealed 21-mer primer, 100 ng of pol δ in 40 mm BisTris (pH 6.7), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. After incubation for 2 min at 37 °C under reduced light, the tube with the sample was opened and subjected to 1 min of UV irradiation (∼254 nm) at 0 °C with the UV lamp (UVGL-58) placed 5 cm from the surface of the sample. Then CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and 7 units of micrococcal nuclease were added. The reaction volume was 12 μl. The sample was incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. Afterward, products were subjected to SDS-PAGE (19Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) followed by silver staining or immunoblotting and PhosphorImager analysis. Based on x-ray crystallographic analysis (4Krishna T.S. Kong X.P. Gary S. Burgers P.M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1994; 79: 1233-1243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar), it was suggested that PCNA functions as a trimer to encircle DNA and slide along it. Other studies indicate that pol δ binds to the C-terminal side of PCNA (9Fukuda K. Morioka H. Imajou S. Ikeda S. Ohtsuka E. Tsurimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22527-22534Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 11Jonsson Z.O. Hindges R. Hübscher U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2412-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). A priori, one could envision two possible arrangements for pol δ and PCNA on the DNA template-primer. In the first model (Fig.1 A), PCNA is situated behind pol δ. This is similar to the way in which the β-subunit ofE. coli pol III is believed to function (14Reems J.A. Wood S. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5606-5613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and is supported by some experimental data reported to date (20Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1950-1960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1961-1968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the central “hole” formed by the PCNA trimer is of sufficient caliber to accommodate a DNA duplex as would be required by this model. In the second model (Fig. 1 B), PCNA is situated “ahead” of pol δ. A 20-mer primer was annealed to a 50-mer template that had a biotinylated base at position 11 (Fig.2 A). pol δ alone can elongate the primer up to 39 nucleotides and stops 1 base before the biotin residue (Fig. 2 B, lane 1). If streptavidin is added before incubation, pol δ can extend the primer only up to 37 nucleotides, presumably due to steric interference by the bulky biotin·streptavidin complex (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). As expected (22Mozzherin D.J. Shibutani S. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. Fisher P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6126-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), addition of PCNA allowed pol δ to bypass the biotinylated base in the absence of streptavidin and to elongate the primer to the end of the template (50 nucleotides) (Fig.2 B, lane 2). Nevertheless, there was an apparent slowing of elongation at a length of 39 nucleotides. PCNA-dependent bypass by pol δ was previously reported for other template lesions (22Mozzherin D.J. Shibutani S. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. Fisher P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6126-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 23O'Day C.L. Burgers P.M. Taylor J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5403-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 24Ensch-Simon I. Burgers P.M. Taylor J.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8218-8226Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). If PCNA is located ahead of pol δ in the complex (see Fig.1 B), it should block primer elongation close to the biotin·streptavidin complex. Based on the crystallographically determined size of PCNA, we can estimate that pol δ should stop synthesis at or near the spot marked by the arrow to the left of Fig. 2 B. But with streptavidin present, pol δ·PCNA can extend the primer even further than pol δ alone (Fig.2 B, compare lanes 4 and 3). These data are therefore consistent with the notion that PCNA is located behind pol δ during DNA synthesis. To demonstrate the relative positions of pol δ and PCNA in another way, we placed the biotin-modified nucleotide on the 3′-end of the template. We then annealed either a 15-mer primer or a 19-mer primer as shown (Fig.3, A and B). Without streptavidin, either pol δ alone or pol δ·PCNA can extend both primers efficiently. The dramatic effect of PCNA is demonstrated by the increased processivity and elongation of primers to the full length of the template provided (Fig. 3 C, comparelanes 3 and 2 for the 15-mer primer andlanes 8 and 7 for the 19-mer primer). When streptavidin was added, PCNA-dependent synthesis was almost totally inhibited on the 15-mer (Fig. 3, C, comparelanes 5 and 3; and D), but synthesis by pol δ alone was unaffected (Fig. 3 C, comparelanes 4 and 2). When streptavidin was present, PCNA-dependent synthesis on the 19-mer primer was only ∼50% inhibited (Fig. 3, C, compare lanes 10and 8; and D). Synthesis by pol δ alone was unaffected (Fig. 3 C, compare lanes 9 and7). These results are consistent with only the model in which PCNA is behind, as shown (Fig. 3, A and B). Similarly consistent, the activity of pol δ alone was not inhibited by streptavidin in a reaction mixture containing 10-mer or 13-mer primers annealed to the biotinylated template (data not shown). In contrast to results with larger primers (Fig. 3 C, comparelanes 2, 7, 11,13, 15, and 17 with lanes 3, 8, 12, 14,16, and 18, respectively), elongation of the 10-mer or 13-mer by pol δ was also not affected by PCNA addition (data not shown). Addition of streptavidin to a control mixture with the non-biotinylated template did not affect the activity of pol δ either in the presence or absence of PCNA (Fig. 3 C, lanes 11–18). When a 17-mer was used in this assay, PCNA-dependent synthesis was inhibited 72% in the presence of streptavidin (Fig. 3 D). A 21-mer and 23-mer both gave results close to those obtained with the 19-mer, 52% and 51%, respectively, versus 47% inhibition (Fig. 3 D). Experiments performed with longer primers (and templates) gave complex results (data not shown) that could not be interpreted in the current context. As noted above, pol δ alone was active with short primers (10-mer and 13-mer). Moreover, comparison with longer primers (e.g. a 15-mer) suggested that it was fully active (data not shown). When primers were annealed to a biotinylated template, addition of streptavidin had no effect on pol δ-catalyzed DNA synthesis (data not shown). This suggests that in interacting with primer, pol δ contacts closely <10 base pairs of duplex DNA. To elucidate how the pol δ subunits are located relative to DNA, we analyzed the photocross-linking of pol δ to a single-stranded 45-mer oligonucleotide containing a photoreactive analog of dTTP (AB-dUMP) at position 19 and [32P]dCMP at position 20 (Fig. 4 A). We showed previously that pol δ binds single-stranded DNA, but not duplex DNA, presumably through the active site of the polymerase (17Ng L. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. Fisher P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11699-11704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pol δ was incubated with the 45-mer for 2 min at 37 °C, followed by UV illumination of the sample on ice for 1 min. The DNA was then digested by micrococcal nuclease, and the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining and PhosphorImager analysis (Fig.4 B). The silver-stained gel (Fig. 4 B, lane 1) shows a polypeptide of ∼21 kDa, corresponding to micrococcal nuclease. All larger polypeptides were derived from the pol δ preparation (data not shown). Comparison of silver stain patterns with PhosphorImager analysis revealed that the major radioactive band corresponded to the 125-kDa subunit of pol δ (p125) and that no32P labeling of the small subunit of pol δ (p50) could be detected. Photocross-linking experiments were repeated with a mixture of primed templates as shown (Fig. 5 A). Each of the templates had a single photoreactive analog (AB-dUMP) incorporated in one of eight possible positions followed by [32P]dCMP; a 21-mer primer was annealed also as shown (Fig. 5 A). After standard photocross-linking and micrococcal nuclease treatment, the sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by PhosphorImager analysis and immunoblot assay with antibodies against p125 and p50 (Fig. 5 B). Again, 32P labeling of the 125-kDa subunit of pol δ, but not p50, was detected. We noted that three bands immediately below p125 were not labeled in our original photocross-linking analysis with the single-stranded 45-mer (Fig. 4 B). To elucidate the nature of p125 degradation that abrogates DNA binding, we analyzed a preparation of pol δ that, based on protein staining, exhibited significant degradation of p125 (data not shown). We performed an experiment with antibodies against either the N or C terminus of p125 in conjunction with standard photocross-linking and micrococcal nuclease digestion (Fig. 5 C). Cross-linking of the template to a degraded large subunit with a preserved C terminus was clearly visible. Cross-linking to a degraded large subunit with a preserved N terminus was undetectable (Fig. 5 C). Based both on our results and those of others, a model may be proposed for the actively polymerizing pol δ·PCNA·DNA complex (Fig. 6). As evidenced by de novo DNA synthesis, we suggest that, by itself, the two-subunit form of pol δ can bind the DNA template-primer (see, for example, Ref. 17Ng L. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. Fisher P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11699-11704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although composed of a 125-kDa polypeptide (p125, the “catalytic” subunit) and a 50-kDa polypeptide (p50), photocross-linking results (Figs. 4 and 5) suggest that only the catalytic subunit (p125) interacts directly with DNA; p50 does not. Consistent with this, the work of others suggests that only p125 is necessary for primer-dependent, template-directed DNA synthesis; however, p50 is required for pol δ-catalyzed incorporation to be stimulated by PCNA (25Goulian M. Herrmann S.M. Sackett J.W. Grimm S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16402-16411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Chiang C.S. Mitsis P.G. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29740-29745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). There is also evidence to suggest that p125 interacts significantly with PCNA (28Brown W.C. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21706-21710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Zhang S.-J. Zeng X.-R. Zhang P. Toomey N.L. Chuang R.-Y. Chang L.-S. Lee M.Y.W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7988-7992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Our results do not in any way preclude such an interaction. When PCNA is included in incubations, it encircles the duplex DNA behind pol δ and, by simultaneously binding pol δ, enhances template-primer binding by pol δ (decreasesk off) by nearly 2000-fold (16McConnell M. Miller H. Mozzherin D.J. Quamina A. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. Fisher P.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8268-8274Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Moreover, since PCNA functions as a trimer, each binding site is present in triplicate. Thus, it can interact with other molecules (e.g. RF-C, DNA ligase I, and FEN-1) at the same time as pol δ. The model of the pol δ·PCNA complex is consistent with the structure of PCNA derived from x-ray crystallography (4Krishna T.S. Kong X.P. Gary S. Burgers P.M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1994; 79: 1233-1243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 30Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar) and with the sliding clamp model for DNA synthesis proposed by others (6Kuriyan J. O'Donnell M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This model proposes a general mechanism of DNA polymerase processivity factor action. The suggestion that, during synthesis, PCNA is situated behind, not in “front” of, pol δ is based on our current observation that PCNA-dependent DNA synthesis by pol δ proceeds to a point immediately adjacent to a streptavidin-bound biotinylated template nucleotide (Fig. 2). If PCNA was situated in front of pol δ, we reasoned that since PCNA is thought to encircle the DNA, steric hindrance from the streptavidin would render PCNA-dependent DNA synthesis by pol δ impossible in its immediate vicinity. In other words, PCNA itself would get in the way. In empirical terms, the crystal-derived size of PCNA (4Krishna T.S. Kong X.P. Gary S. Burgers P.M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1994; 79: 1233-1243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 30Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar) suggests that if PCNA were located in front of pol δ, synthesis would stop at or near nucleotide 30. Instead, it continues to nucleotide 39; the streptavidin-bound biotinylated template residue would be opposite nucleotide 40. That such hindrance does indeed occur is evidenced by the near-total inhibition of PCNA-dependent synthesis catalyzed by pol δ on a 15-mer primer (Fig. 3; also see below). We considered the alternative possibility that a complex of pol δ and PCNA was responsible for extension of the primer up to about nucleotide 30 and that pol δ alone was responsible for synthesis up to nucleotide 39. For at least two reasons, we think this a very unlikely explanation for the results shown (Fig. 2). First, our interpretation of the results shown (Fig. 2), which include DNA synthesis largely or entirely by a pol δ·PCNA complex, is fully consistent with and thus corroborated by the effect of streptavidin placement behind the primer terminus (Fig. 3; also see below). Second, in comparinglanes 3 and 4 in Fig. 2 B, we noted that synthesis by pol δ alone (lane 3, without PCNA) resulted in a distribution of synthesis products that was very different from that seen when PCNA was added (lane 4, with PCNA). This observation suggests that synthesis near the template streptavidin in the presence of PCNA is not by pol δ alone, but rather by a complex, the presence of which was dependent on PCNA addition. We presume this to be the pol δ·PCNA complex. The placement of PCNA behind pol δ in the catalytically active pol δ·PCNA·DNA complex was further supported by results demonstrating that streptavidin-mediated inhibition of PCNA-dependent, pol δ-catalyzed DNA synthesis was inversely related to the size of the oligonucleotide used to prime incorporation (Fig. 3). By using a modification of a method described previously (31Gopalakrishnan V. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21123-21126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we found that with a 15-mer primer, streptavidin-mediated inhibition of PCNA-dependent DNA synthesis was almost complete (Fig.3 C, compare lanes 5 and 3); in contrast, we saw no streptavidin-mediated inhibition of PCNA-independent synthesis (Fig. 3 C, comparelanes 4 and 2). Use of a 19-mer primer on the same template resulted in much less streptavidin-mediated inhibition of PCNA-dependent DNA synthesis (Fig.3 C, compare lanes 10 and 8). Again, no inhibition of PCNA-independent DNA synthesis was observed (Fig.3 C, compare lanes 9 and7). Upon examination of the results in Fig. 3 D, we noted that even at apparently optimal primer length, maximal synthesis in the presence of streptavidin was only ∼50% of that seen in its absence. This was clearly not a direct effect of streptavidin since streptavidin did not in any way inhibit pol δ-catalyzed DNA synthesis on a control (non-biotinylated) template (Fig. 3 C, lanes 11–18). Rather, we think that this inhibition provides specific insight into the mechanism by which PCNA stimulates pol δ in the absence of RF-C and ATP. In the absence of streptavidin, PCNA can load and/or unload passively onto the synthetic oligonucleotide template-primer from either end. In the presence of streptavidin, loading and/or unloading is blocked from the primer end and can only occur from the template end. Moreover, loading of PCNA must occur randomly, such that it can assume either of two orientations on the DNA. PCNA has polarity. In one orientation, the C-terminal (pol δ-interacting) side would be pointed away from the 3′-OH primer terminus, and loading would hence be nonproductive. For PCNA to stimulate pol δ, unloading and reloading in the opposite orientation would have to occur. Since RF-C is always present in vivo, this inhibition is likely of no biological significance. However, from a mechanistic perspective, our results suggest that PCNA can be loaded onto DNA from either the template (single-stranded) or primer (double-stranded) side of the 3′-OH terminus. This conclusion may have biological implications. Because the length of the DNA double helix is known precisely, it may be used, in conjunction with quantitative analysis of data such as those shown (Fig. 3 D), as a molecular “ruler” to estimate the size of the pol δ·PCNA complex as it interacts with the DNA. With a 15-mer primer and streptavidin present, PCNA-dependent synthesis was negligible. With a 19-mer primer, PCNA-dependent synthesis was maximal (evidenced by the observation that synthesis did not increase when a 21-mer primer was used). A 17-mer primer gave an intermediate amount of PCNA-dependent DNA synthesis, thereby indicating a significant increase between a 17-mer and a 19-mer. Together, these data suggest that the pol δ·PCNA complex occupies a region of the duplex behind the primer terminus of between 58 and 65 Å. Since results of x-ray crystallographic analysis indicate that PCNA is ∼30 Å thick, this would suggest that pol δ occupies between 28 and 35 Å or between 8 and 10 nucleotides of the primer duplex immediately distal to (behind) the 3′-OH terminus. This last conclusion is also consistent with results of streptavidin inhibition of pol δ-alone activity with short primers (10-mer and 13-mer). Previously, we concluded, based on results of steady-state analyses, that pol α, another essential eukaryotic DNA polymerase, interacted with eight primer nucleotides, four of which had to be base-paired, during enzymatic DNA synthesis (Ref. 32Fisher P.A. Korn D. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4570-4578Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar; see also Ref. 33Fisher P.A. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 47: 371-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Our present conclusions for pol δ, derived from entirely different approaches, are remarkably similar. Photocross-linking to p125 occurs independently of whether single-stranded or template-primer DNA is used. Only the template-primer is a substrate for pol δ-catalyzed DNA synthesis. However, single-stranded DNA competes with the template-primer for binding to pol δ (17Ng L. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. Fisher P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11699-11704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the interaction of pol δ with single-stranded DNA occurs through the active site of the enzyme. Current photocross-linking results are consistent with this notion. Analyses of p125 sequence demonstrated the presence of zinc finger DNA-binding motifs located near the C terminus of the pol δ catalytic subunit (34Yang C.L. Chang L.S. Zhang P. Hao H. Zhu L. Toomey N.L. Lee M.Y.W.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Similarly, deletion mutagenesis revealed that the C terminus of pol δ p125 is essential for DNA polymerase activity (35Wu S.-M. Zhang P. Zeng X.R. Zhang S.-J. Mo J. Li B.Q. Lee M.Y.W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9561-9569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Our current photocross-linking results, performed in conjunction with immunoblot analyses (Fig. 5), demonstrate that DNA binding, as measured in our assay, is mediated largely or exclusively by this region of p125."

First, TraY binds at PY, the major transfer (tra) operon promoter (3Nelson W.C. Morton B.S. Lahue E.E. Matson S.W. J.

Through an undefined mechanism, TraY and integration host factor enhance the nucleolytic activity of TraI as it cleaves one DNA strand in preparation for transfer of the cut strand to the recipient bacterium (6Nelson W.C.

This family includes three proteins of known three-dimensional structure: Arc (9Raumann B.E. Rould M.A. Pabo C.O. Sauer R.T. Nature. 1994; 367: 754-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and Mnt (10Burgering M.J. Boelens R. Gilbert D.E. Breg J.N. Knight K.L. Sauer R.T. Kaptein R.

Nature. 1992; 359: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The family name derives from a structural motif that includes a β-strand followed by two α-helices (reviewed in Refs. 12Raumann B.E. Brown B.M. Sauer R.T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 36-43Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholarand 13Phillips S.E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 89-98Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Two ribbon-helix-helix folds form a single protein domain, with the β-strands combining in a two-strand antiparallel β-sheet. In Arc, Mnt, and Met repressors, this domain is formed by pairing of monomers, each of which contains a single ribbon-helix-helix motif. TraY is a monomeric protein (3Nelson W.C. Morton B.S. Lahue E.E. Matson S.W. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2221-2228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Schildbach J.F. Robinson C.R. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1329-1333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), but appears to contain a pair of tandem, nonidentical ribbon-helix-helix motifs. The three-dimensional structure of TraY has not yet been determined, and TraY shares no more than 20% sequence identity with any ribbon-helix-helix protein. However, like these proteins, TraY is composed of mixed α-helix and β-sheet secondary structure (14Schildbach J.F. Robinson C.R. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1329-1333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Ribbon-helix-helix proteins form base-specific DNA contacts through residues of their β-sheets (12Raumann B.E. Brown B.M. Sauer R.T. Curr. Opin. Struct.

If TraY is a member of this family, amino acid substitutions within the TraY β-sheet should alter DNA recognition. We therefore engineered a series of TraY mutants with Ala substitutions within the TraY β-sheet region, and characterized the DNA recognition and protein stability of these mutants.DISCUSSIONIf TraY is a member of the ribbon-helix-helix family, the protein should contact DNA through residues of its β-sheet. To test whether the amino acids of the TraY β-sheet are involved in DNA recognition, we engineered a series of TraY mutants having single Ala substitutions within this region. Based on results from mutagenesis studies of Arc repressor, another member of the ribbon-helix-helix family of transcription factors, these TraY mutants should exhibit substantially reduced affinities for the TraY DNA-binding site while retaining near wild-type protein stability (19Brown B.M. Milla M.E. Smith T.L. Sauer R.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 20Milla M.E. Brown B.M. Sauer R.T. Nat. Struct.

In ribbon-helix-helix proteins, the side chains of these β-sheet DNA contact residues are largely solvent exposed and do not contribute significantly to the stability of the protein.Our results are consistent with inclusion of TraY in the ribbon-helix-helix family of transcription factors. As was seen with Arc repressor (19Brown B.M. Milla M.E. Smith T.L. Sauer R.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 20Milla M.E. Brown B.M. Sauer R.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 518-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), most of the Ala substitutions have little effect on protein stability (Table I), while their effects on sequence-specific DNA recognition are often considerable (Tables II andIII). There is no apparent correlation between protein stability and DNA affinity. For example, mutants K15A and T71A exhibit similar significant reductions in affinity (Tables II and III), yet the former has wild-type stability while the latter has a reduced stability (ΔΔ GuH O2 = −0.8 kcal/mol; Table I). The reduced affinities for DNA are therefore not attributable to protein destabilization by the mutations that render the protein nonfunctional.These results suggest that TraY utilizes β-sheet residues for specific DNA recognition. While TraY and all TraY mutants have similar affinities for nonspecific DNA, most mutants exhibited significantly reduced affinities for the specific oriT TraY binding site. We also examined the binding of TraY and some of the mutants to a second specific TraY binding site at the PY promoter (results not shown). The proteins examined demonstrated similar affinities, relative to wild type, for both DNA binding sites. TraY, therefore, binds the two sites in a similar fashion.These experiments do not reveal the precise roles of each of these β-sheet residues in DNA recognition, and further experimentation is underway to better define their contributions. Given the effects of the mutations on specific but not nonspecific DNA binding, it is likely that some β-sheet residues participate in base-specific contacts. Most of the Ala substitutions, however, were for positively charged Lys or Arg residues. These residues are capable of forming energetically favorable, but nonspecific, electrostatic interactions with the phosphate moieties of the DNA backbone. If, however, these amino acid side chains contribute to binding in a nonspecific fashion (for example, with the DNA backbone), the results suggest that they contribute preferentially within the context of sequence-specific recognition. Contribution of presumably nonspecific backbone contacts to DNA binding specificity has been observed previously (21Nelson H.C. Sauer R.T. Cell. 1985; 42: 549-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 22Nelson H.C. Sauer R.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 23Schildbach J.F. Karzai A.W. Raumann B.E. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).Some β-sheet amino acid side chains may also contribute to specific DNA recognition indirectly, in addition to forming direct contacts with DNA. An extensive hydrogen bond network involving the side chains of DNA-contact residues is apparent in the crystal structure of the Arc repressor tetramer-operator complex (9Raumann B.E. Rould M.A. Pabo C.O. Sauer R.T. Nature. 1994; 367: 754-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 19Brown B.M. Milla M.E. Smith T.L. Sauer R.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These hydrogen bonds presumably orient the side chains for optimal DNA contact, and thereby contribute to DNA recognition. If an analogous series of interactions occurs between TraY contact residues, substitution of one of the involved amino acids could have a substantial effect on specific DNA recognition, even if that side chain makes only minor energetic contributions to DNA binding through side chain-DNA contacts. Loss of cooperative interactions between contact residues could explain why three different Ala substitutions reduce affinity for theoriT sequence to within 4-fold of the affinity for a nonspecific sequence (Table III). Bacterial conjugation is the process by which a conjugative plasmid directs transfer of a copy of itself from donor to recipient bacterium (for review, see Ref. 1Frost L.S. Ippen-Ihler K. Skurray R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 162-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The TraY protein ofEscherichia coli K12 Sex Factor F (F Factor or F plasmid) is required for efficient F Factor conjugal transfer (2Carter J.R. Porter R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1027-1034Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TraY, a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, plays two distinct roles in F Factor conjugation. First, TraY binds at PY, the major transfer (tra) operon promoter (3Nelson W.C. Morton B.S. Lahue E.E. Matson S.W. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2221-2228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), up-regulating transcription of the tra operon (4Silverman P.M. Sholl A. J.

Microbiol. 1996; 22: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Second, TraY participates in the “relaxosome,” a complex of three proteins that assembles at the F plasmid origin of transfer (oriT). In addition to TraY, the relaxosome includes F-Factor-encoded TraI, and the host-genome-encoded integration host factor. Through an undefined mechanism, TraY and integration host factor enhance the nucleolytic activity of TraI as it cleaves one DNA strand in preparation for transfer of the cut strand to the recipient bacterium (6Nelson W.C.

Sauer R.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 5-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) assigned TraY to the ribbon-helix-helix family of transcription factors. This family includes three proteins of known three-dimensional structure: Arc (9Raumann B.E. Rould M.A. Pabo C.O. Sauer R.T. Nature. 1994; 367: 754-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and Mnt (10Burgering M.J. Boelens R. Gilbert D.E. Breg J.N. Knight K.L. Sauer R.T. Kaptein R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15036-15045Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) repressors of phage P22, and the Met repressor of E. coli (11Somers W.S. Phillips S.E. Nature. 1992; 359: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The family name derives from a structural motif that includes a β-strand followed by two α-helices (reviewed in Refs. 12Raumann B.E. Brown B.M. Sauer R.T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 36-43Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholarand 13Phillips S.E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 89-98Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Two ribbon-helix-helix folds form a single protein domain, with the β-strands combining in a two-strand antiparallel β-sheet. In Arc, Mnt, and Met repressors, this domain is formed by pairing of monomers, each of which contains a single ribbon-helix-helix motif. TraY is a monomeric protein (3Nelson W.C. Morton B.S. Lahue E.E. Matson S.W. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2221-2228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Schildbach J.F. Robinson C.R. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1329-1333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), but appears to contain a pair of tandem, nonidentical ribbon-helix-helix motifs. The three-dimensional structure of TraY has not yet been determined, and TraY shares no more than 20% sequence identity with any ribbon-helix-helix protein. However, like these proteins, TraY is composed of mixed α-helix and β-sheet secondary structure (14Schildbach J.F. Robinson C.R. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1329-1333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Ribbon-helix-helix proteins form base-specific DNA contacts through residues of their β-sheets (12Raumann B.E. Brown B.M. Sauer R.T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 36-43Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar,13Phillips S.E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 89-98Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). If TraY is a member of this family, amino acid substitutions within the TraY β-sheet should alter DNA recognition. We therefore engineered a series of TraY mutants with Ala substitutions within the TraY β-sheet region, and characterized the DNA recognition and protein stability of these mutants. DISCUSSIONIf TraY is a member of the ribbon-helix-helix family, the protein should contact DNA through residues of its β-sheet. To test whether the amino acids of the TraY β-sheet are involved in DNA recognition, we engineered a series of TraY mutants having single Ala substitutions within this region. Based on results from mutagenesis studies of Arc repressor, another member of the ribbon-helix-helix family of transcription factors, these TraY mutants should exhibit substantially reduced affinities for the TraY DNA-binding site while retaining near wild-type protein stability (19Brown B.M. Milla M.E. Smith T.L. Sauer R.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 20Milla M.E. Brown B.M. Sauer R.T. Nat. Struct.

There are PapB homologous proteins encoded by many fimbrial gene systems that are involved in the regulation of fimbriae-adhesin production, and previous studies suggested that PapB binds DNA through minor groove contact. Both deletion and alanine-scanning mutagenesis were used to identify functionally important regions of the PapB protein. Mutations altering Arg61 or Cys65caused deficiency in DNA binding, indicating that these residues are critical for PapB binding to DNA. Alanine substitutions at positions 35–36, 53–56, and 74–76 resulted in mutants that were impaired in oligomerization. All these amino acid residues are conserved among the PapB homologous proteins, suggesting their importance in the whole family of regulatory proteins. The transcriptional efficiency of all the mutants was clearly reduced as compared with that of wild-type PapB. Taken together, we have localized regions in the PapB protein that are involved in DNA binding and oligomerization, and our results show that both functions are required for its activity as a transcriptional regulator.

Göransson M. Uhlin B.E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1271-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). There are several PapB homologous proteins that are involved in the regulation of the production of different fimbrial adhesins. SfaB is a positive regulator for the production of S fimbriae (2Morschhäuser J. Uhlin B.E. Hacker J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 238: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The products of thefanA and fanB genes both show resemblance to PapB and are suggested to act as transcriptional antiterminators involved in the control of K99 fimbriae production (3Roosendaal B. Damoiseaux J. Jordi W. de Graaf F.K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 215: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Biosynthesis of theEscherichia coli CS31A surface antigen is negatively controlled by the PapB homolog, ClpB, together with LRP (4Martin C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In thepef operon, located on the 90-kilobase virulence plasmid inSalmonella typhimurium, the gene pefB is postulated to encode a PapB-like protein (5Friedrich M.J. Kinsey N.E. Vila J. Kadner R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 543-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Among all of these PapB-like proteins, little is known about their mode of action or the actual molecular mechanism by which fimbrial expression is affected. The PapB protein is composed of 104 amino acids (aa),1 and its molecular size according to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis is approximately 11 kDa (6Båga M. Göransson M. Normark S. Uhlin B.E. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3887-3893Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The aa sequence of the PapB protein does not contain any obvious recognition motifs that are common in other DNA binding proteins. It was recently shown that the PapB protein recognizes a DNA structure, which includes T/A triplets in terms of 9-base pair repeats, and the evidence suggests that it binds to DNA through minor groove contact in an oligomeric fashion (7Xia Y. Forsman K. Jass J. Uhlin B.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This novel DNA-binding mode could be important for PapB homologous proteins to function as transcriptional regulators of different fimbrial operons. In the present study, both truncated derivatives and variants altered by alanine-scanning mutagenesis were used to identify residues important for DNA binding and oligomerization of PapB protein. The efficiency of such mutants in transcriptional activation of thepap operon was also tested. E. colistrains used in this study were JM109 (8Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J.

Similarly, primers b8 and b10 (5′-GCCCGATATCTTATTACCCCAGTGTTGTACTGAA-3′) were used to obtain truncated papB gene (1–80 aa) and to produce pYN65; primers b8 and b11 (5′-GCCCGATATCTTATTACATCTGGTATTTCTCGCA-3′) were used to obtain truncated papB gene (1–70 aa) and to produce pYN66; primers b8 and b12 (5′-GCCCGATATCTTATTAGGAGTGCCCACCTACCAG-3′) were used to obtain truncated papB gene (1–60 aa) and to produce pYN67. pYN69 is a derivative of pYN51 where the cI repressor gene was partially deleted by removal of the DNA region between theNsiI and HindIII sites. The correct frame was restored using two synthetic oligonucleotides (5′-AGCTTGGCTTGGATCCTGTTGGTGATGCA-3′ and 5′-TCACCAACAGGATCCAAGCCA-3′) to produce a shortened cI, missing 96 aa residues (Leu57–Ala152) fused to wt papBgene.Table IPlasmids used in this studyPlasmidsRelevant characteristicsReferencespHMG1pap (I+, B+) A:lacZ, Cbr19Göransson M.

Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Restriction endonuclease digestions and DNA ligation reactions were performed under conditions recommended by the manufacturers (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, New England Biolabs Inc.). The plasmids containing wt and mutant papB genes (based on pQE30) were introduced into JM109, and protein expression was induced by addition of IPTG (final concentration 1 mm) at the logarithmic phase. The His-tagged wt and mutant PapB proteins were purified as described previously (7Xia Y. Forsman K. Jass J. Uhlin B.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antisera with antibodies recognizing PapB were produced by immunization of rabbits with purified PapB protein. The PapB antibody was purified as described by Taraseviciene et al. (16Taraseviciene L. Naureckiene S. Uhlin B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12167-12172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For detection of PapB by immunoblotting, we used a procedure essentially as described before (17Dagberg B. Uhlin B.E. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7606-7612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ECL Western blot was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Gel mobility shift assays to detect protein-DNA interaction were performed as described previously (1Forsman K. Göransson M. Uhlin B.E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1271-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 18Göransson M. Forsman P. Nilsson P. Uhlin B.E. Mol.

Microbiol. 1998; 30: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) were obtained by end-labeling purified PCR products with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Oligonucleotides 740 (5′-CCCAAGCTTAATCCGTTACCGCCAGCGCCT-3′) and 1140 (5′-CCCAAGCTTTAAACGATCTTTTAACCCACAAAAC-3′) were used as the two primers, while plasmid pHMG1 (19Göransson M. Uhlin B.E. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2885-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) was used as the template in the PCR amplification. The purified wt or mutant PapB proteins with 6×His tag were mixed with 32P-end-labeled DNA fragments (5000–10,000 cpm) in the presence of 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 50 mmKCl in buffer B (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1 mmEDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) in a final volume of 10 μl. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 25 °C for 15 min and then immediately loaded onto 8% polyacrylamide-bisacrylamide (37.5:1) for electrophoresis. To measure the β-galactosidase specific activity, we used the method described by Miller (20Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). All data represent the average values obtained from at least three separate experiments. Cm sensitivity was tested by plating dilutions from a fresh overnight culture on LB plates containing Cm at 0, 10, 25, 50, 100, 150, and 200 μg/ml (21Zeng X. Hu J.C. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 185: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Sensitivity was expressed as the Cm concentration at which the plating efficiency of the cells fell below 50%. E. coli 71-18lacIq cells (8Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11465) Google Scholar), transformed with the constructs described in Table I (those cloned into pBF21), were grown at 37 °C to an A 620 nm of 0.6 in LB medium containing Cb. The chimeric proteins, consisting of the N-terminal (DNA binding) domain of λ cI repressor fused to a desired protein, were induced by addition of 250 μl of 100 mm IPTG to 0.4-ml portions of the culture. Following this induction, the cells were infected by addition of 3 μl of phage λ 146 (5 × 1010plaque-forming units/ml) (22Bailone A. Devoret R. Virology. 1978; 84: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) diluted 1/10,000 just before infection in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, buffer containing 10 mmMgSO4. After a 5-min incubation at 20 °C, 5 ml of LB containing Cb (100 μg/ml) and 10 mm MgSO4were added to the infected cultures, which were then transferred to a 37 °C shaker bath. At the indicated times, 0.4-ml aliquots were removed, centrifuged for 5 min to pellet the cells, and 150 μl of supernatant were mixed with 30 μl of chloroform. The number of phages in each supernatant was determined by the quantitative titer method (23Silhavy T.J. Berman M.L. Enquist L.W. Experiments with Gene Fusion. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1984Google Scholar) using E. coli 71-18 lacIq as recipient strain. In vitro cross-linking was carried out as described by Ueguchi et al. (24Ueguchi C. Seto C. Suzuki T. Mizuno T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Strains carrying plasmids expressing His-tagged wt or mutant PapB were grown at 37 °C to the mid-logarithmic phase in LB in the presence of 1 mm IPTG. Cells were harvested from 5 ml of the culture, washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. After freeze-thawing in the same buffer, cells were collected and resuspended in 500 μl of a cross-linking buffer (1 m triethanolamine-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.25m NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol). Cell extracts were then prepared by sonication, followed by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 30 min). These samples were incubated at room temperature in 200 μl of the cross-linking buffer with or without dimethyl suberimidate (1 mg/ml). From the reaction mixtures, proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein bands were detected by immunoblotting with purified polyclonal anti-PapB antiserum. Plasmids expressing wt or mutant PapB were introduced into strain MC1029 together with plasmid pHMG15 pap (I + , B1) A: lacZ. All these strains were grown at 37 °C to the mid-logarithmic phase in LB with or without IPTG induction (final concentration 1 mm). To test how efficient PapB protein derivatives could activate transcription, we monitored the expression of β-galactosidase from pHMG15, and the expression level obtained with wt-PapB in absence of IPTG was set to 1.0. The amino acid sequence of the PapB protein does not contain any obvious recognition motifs that are common in other DNA-binding proteins. The computer prediction of the secondary structure of PapB suggested a hydrophilic region (aa 61–70) (Fig. 1 A), which, in a comparison with PapB-like proteins from other fimbrial gene systems (Fig. 2), seemed to contain several conserved residues and could be important for DNA binding. To test this prediction, different PCR fragments containing wt and truncatedpapB gene(s) were cloned into the QIAexpress vector PQE 30 (Table I). The wt and truncated PapB proteins with a 6×His affinity tag attached to the N-terminal were purified through a Ni-NTA column (Fig.3 A), and were analyzed for specific binding to site 1 in the J96 pap-pili regulatory region (1Forsman K. Göransson M. Uhlin B.E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1271-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, addition of 6.4 μm (80 ng/μl) of the wt His-PapB could bind and shift all the labeled DNA fragments (indicated by “++” in Fig.1 B). The gel mobility shift assay showed that the truncated His-PapB (1–80 aa) could bind DNA in a similar way, although a bit weaker (indicated by “+”) (Figs. 1 B and 4 A). In the case of some of the other truncated mutants: His-PapB (1–70 aa), His-PapB (1–66 aa), and His-PapB (31–104 aa), the labeled DNA fragments were slightly shifted from the position of protein-free DNA, but no distinct shifted band was observed (indicated by “(+)” in Fig. 1 B). The DNA binding ability of the truncated PapB mutant composed of only the N-terminal 60 aa was almost completely abolished (indicated by “−” in Fig. 1 B). Taken together, the results suggest that the conserved hydrophilic region containing amino acids 61–70 could be important for DNA binding (Figs.1 B and 4 A).Figure 2Protein sequence alignments of PapB homologous proteins.

In order to further identify the critical residues, alanine-scanning mutagenesis was applied to these regions. Alanine was chosen as the replacement residue, since it is tolerated in both hydrophobic and hydrophilic environments. Importantly, this change should function to remove a small region of charge or a large side chain without affecting its potential for being correctly folded and assembled (25Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar, 26Gibbs C.S. Zoller M.J. Methods (Orlando). 1991; 3: 165-173Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The alanine codons utilized in the mutagenesis were GCA and GCT. The PCR fragments containing different mutant papB genes were cloned into pQE30 (Table I). The His-tagged mutant PapB proteins were purified through a Ni-NTA column (Fig. 3 B) and analyzed for DNA binding. The in vitro binding studies indicated that most of the mutants could still bind to DNA. In several cases the DNA binding was clearly weaker, but in some cases DNA binding occurred to the same extent as with wt-PapB. Examples of the binding patterns in gel mobility shift assays are shown in Fig. 4 for selected mutants with different DNA binding affinities. These results are summarized below (Fig. 7) for all the mutants tested. The two mutants harboring alanine substitutions at positions 61 or 65 clearly showed a defective DNA binding (Fig. 4 B). To test if the -SH group of Cys65 contributed to the DNA binding, the PapB protein was modified by incubation together with iodoacetamide, which could block the -SH group of Cys65. The modified PapB completely lost the DNA binding ability (data not shown), suggesting the importance of the sulfhydryl-group of Cys65 in DNA binding. Taken together, we propose that Arg61 and Cys65 are most essential for PapB binding to DNA. The wt-PapB protein has a tendency to form large, insoluble aggregates, and previous studies have indicated that PapB could act as an oligomer and could protect regions as long as 30–70 nucleotides (7Xia Y. Forsman K. Jass J. Uhlin B.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, both the even numbers of 9-base pair repeats in the PapB binding site(s) and the results of binding saturation experiments suggested that PapB might act as a dimer or a tetramer in vivo (7Xia Y. Forsman K. Jass J. Uhlin B.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To investigate the active form of PapB as a transcriptional regulator, a test to determine the actual capability of the PapB molecules to oligomerize in vivo was devised. Based on plasmid pBF21, which carries the bacteriophage λ cI repressor gene under the control of a tandemly repeated lacUV5 promoter, and pBF22 in which the DNA encoding the oligomerization domain of the repressor (C-terminal domain) was deleted (14Spurio R. Falconi M. Brandi A. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1795-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), we constructed plasmid pYN51 encoding the chimeric protein consisting of the N-terminal DNA binding domain of the λ cI repressor and the wt-PapB molecule (TableI). The test relies on the capability of an oligomerization-proficient protein domain to functionally replace the natural C-terminal domain of phage λ cI repressor conferring biological activity to the N-terminal DNA binding domain of the same repressor (21Zeng X. Hu J.C. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 185: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) (Fig.5 A). The oligomerization proficiency of a protein can be quantified by determining the number of lytic plaques formed following infection (with phage λ) of E. coli cells harboring the pBF expression ve"
https://openalex.org/W2035718056,"The carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) functions at multiple stages of transcription and is involved in the coupling of transcription to pre-mRNA processing. We have used site-specific protein-DNA photocross-linking to determine the position of the CTD along promoter DNA in the transcriptional pre-initiation complex. Comparison of the promoter contacts made by RNAP II with or without the CTD indicate that the CTD approaches promoter DNA downstream of the transcriptional initiation site between positions +16 and +26. Incubation of pre-assembled initiation complexes with antibodies to the CTD prior to UV irradiation led to specific photocross-linking of the IgG heavy chain to nucleotide +17, indicating that the CTD is accessible for protein-protein interactions in a complex containing RNAP II and the general initiation factors. In conjunction with previously published observations, our structural data are fully compatible with the notion that DNA wrapping around RNAP II places the CTD and the RNA exit channel into juxtaposition and provide a rationale for contacts between the SRB-mediator complex and core RNAP II observed in the RNAP II holoenzyme.

The SRBs have been found in association with large multisubunit complexes, called RNAP II holoenzymes, containing core RNAP II, a number of general initiation factors and additional polypeptides (20Kim Y.-J.

Roles for the CTD in transcriptional elongation and in transactivation by the HIV-1 tat protein have also been documented (23Shilatifard A. Conaway J.W. Conaway C.R. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Biol. 1998; 8: 447-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Recent evidence from a number of laboratories indicates that the CTD is also involved in pre-mRNA processing (reviewed in Refs. 6Steinmetz E.J.

Splicing is inhibited both in vivo and in vitroby polypeptides containing CTD repeats and by antibodies directed against the CTD (26Yuryev A. Patturajan M. Litingtung Y. Joshi R.V. Gentile C.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4649-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The CTD has also been implicated in both the 5′-end capping and the 3′-end formation of mRNA (reviewed in Refs. 6Steinmetz E.J.

Sci. 1993; 18: 117-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The 5′-end capping enzymes and the 3′-end cleavage and polyadenylation factors have been shown to associate with the CTD (31Cho E.J. Takagi T. Moore C.R. Buratowski S.

A. 1997; 94: 12898-12903Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). These results support a model in which the hyperphosphorylated, negatively charged CTD of RNAP IIO facilitates interactions with positively charged domains of mRNA processing factors, providing an interface for the recruitment of the enzymes required for pre-mRNA maturation.NMR and circular dichroism studies have suggested that the CTD has an extended conformation in solution (35Cagas P.M. Corden J.L. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 21: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Kornberg and co-workers (36Meredith G.D. Chang W.-H. Li Y. Bushnell D.A. Darst S.A. Kornberg R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) have used electron crystallography of two-dimensional microcrystalline arrays formed on mica sheets and stained with heavy metals to determine the three-dimensional structure of RNAP II. Difference maps between the wild-type enzyme and that lacking the CTD have resulted in its localization. The CTD appears as a mobile region, and its site of attachment to Rpb1 is opposite the 25-Å channel containing the catalytic center of the enzyme. These findings led to the prediction that the CTD is located near the region where TBP and TFIIB bind to the TATA box in the pre-initiation complex (37Kornberg R.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 325-326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).The structure of the CTD in a pre-initiation complex containing the general initiation factors and RNAP II remains elusive. Here, we report on the use of site-specific protein-DNA photocross-linking to localize the CTD along promoter DNA within the RNAP II pre-initiation complex. Our results provide a structural basis for the roles of the CTD in both transcription and pre-mRNA processing.DISCUSSIONWe have mapped the position of the CTD of the largest RNAP II subunit downstream of the transcriptional initiation site between nucleotides +16 and +26. This conclusion is supported by three distinct observations. First, comparison of the photocross-linking of RNAP II with and without the CTD revealed that subunit IIa (e.g. Rpb1 with the CTD) makes additional promoter contacts in the +16/+26 region but not in other regions of promoter DNA. In addition, the specific cross-linking of Rpb1 to position +17 is increased with RNAP IIA. Second, treatment of affinity-labeled Rpb1 using conditions that specifically degrade the CTD indicates that the photolabel is attached directly to the CTD when the photolabeling is performed using photoprobe +17, whereas it is attached to a amino-terminal part of Rpb1 when we used photoprobe +1. Third, treatment of a pre-assembled initiation complex with an anti-CTD antibody led to the photocross-linking of the IgG heavy chain to photoprobe +17, but not to other photoprobes, indicating that the CTD recruits the antibody to this specific promoter region. Importantly, the incubation of RNAP IIA with the anti-CTD antibody prior to initiation complex assembly reduced the cross-linking of Rpb1 to position +17 (data not shown), further indicating that at least part of the CTD must be accessible for its cross-linking to the +16/+26 region.Using electron crystallography, Kornberg and co-workers determined the structure of free RNAP II both with and without the CTD (36Meredith G.D. Chang W.-H. Li Y. Bushnell D.A. Darst S.A. Kornberg R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Their results indicate that the attachment point of the CTD to the body of the enzyme is opposite to the 25-Å channel that contains the catalytic center (see Fig. 3 A for a schematic representation), thereby placing the CTD in close proximity to the site of TFIIB binding to RNAP II (36Meredith G.D. Chang W.-H. Li Y. Bushnell D.A. Darst S.A. Kornberg R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This would imply that the CTD is close to the position where TBP binds to the TATA box in the initiation complex (37Kornberg R.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 325-326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In support of this prediction, direct binding of the CTD to TBP has been reported (10Usheva A. Maldonado E. Goldring A. Lu H. Houbavi C. Reinberg D. Aloni Y. Cell. 1992; 69: 871-881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We have recently provided compelling evidence indicating that promoter DNA is wrapped around RNAP II in the pre-initiation complex (40Robert F. Douziech M. Forget D. Egly J.-M. Greenblatt J. Burton Z.F. Coulombe B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 341-351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). DNA wrapping around RNA polymerase may be a fundamental mechanism that facilitates initiation, elongation, and activation of transcription (43Coulombe B. Burton Z.F. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 457-478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA wrapping places the portion of the promoter region centered at −40 into juxtaposition with that centered at +20. This implies that the 5′-border of the space occupied by TBP/TFIIB, which is approximately at position −40, is also juxtaposed to the region where the CTD has been found to cross-link in the +16/+26 region (see Fig. 3 B). Promoter contacts by RAP74 and TFIIE34 have also been reported in the +16/+26 region (40Robert F. Douziech M. Forget D. Egly J.-M. Greenblatt J. Burton Z.F. Coulombe B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 341-351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), fully supporting the notion that TBP, RAP74, and TFIIE34 can all interact with the hypophosphorylated CTD (10Usheva A. Maldonado E. Goldring A. Lu H. Houbavi C. Reinberg D. Aloni Y. Cell. 1992; 69: 871-881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 11Kang M.E. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23390-23397Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our results indicate that DNA wrapping around RNAP II allows direct promoter contacts by the CTD downstream of the initiation site.Incubation of an anti-CTD antibody with pre-assembled initiation complexes resulted in the cross-linking of the IgG heavy chain to the promoter region contacted by the CTD (see Fig. 2 B). This result further supports the conclusion that the CTD is located in the +16/+26 region and indicates that it is accessible for binding to additional factors in the context of a pre-initiation complex assembled with purified general initiation factors and core RNAP II. In the RNAP II holoenzyme, the CTD is expected to form protein-protein interactions with the SRB-mediator complex (21Greenblatt J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although our data do not address putative CTD-promoter contacts in the context of the holoenzyme, they nevertheless allow us to speculate that the mediator, or at least part of it, may co-localize with the CTD in the pre-initiation complex. Recently, Asturias et al. (44Asturias F.J. Jiang Y.W. Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Kornberg R.D. Science. 1999; 283: 985-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) used electron microscopy to analyze the structure of particles containing both the SRB-mediator complex and core RNAP II. Their results indicate that the SRB-mediator complex makes apparent contacts with RNAP II near the point of attachment of the CTD, and also at a number of sites between this point and the 25-Å channel on one face of the enzyme. Fig. 3 Dshows a schematic representation of the structure of the mediator-RNAP II complex described by Kornberg and co-workers on which we have positioned the CTD according to the results described here. This composite model provides a structural basis for the interactions between core RNAP II and the SRB-mediator complex through direct contacts with the CTD. The model also indicates that the tail of the SRB-mediator complex is located near upstream promoter sequences where it could be a direct target for protein-protein interactions with DNA-bound transcriptional activators. Recently, Woychik and co-workers demonstrated that the Rpb5 subunit of yeast RNAP II has a role very similar to that of the Rpb1-CTD in transcriptional activation (45Miyao T. Woychik N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15281-15286Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The cross-linking data indicate that the CTD (this paper) and Rpb5 (46Kim T.K. Lagrange T. Wang Y.H. Griffith J.D. Reinberg D. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12268-12273Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) 2M. Douziech, D. Forget, J. Greenblatt, and B. Coulombe, unpublished data. occupy adjacent spaces between +13 and +16/+26. We propose that Rpb5 either interacts physically with the SRB-mediator complex or regulates the interaction of the CTD with this complex.The exact time at which the CTD is phosphorylated during the passage from initiation to elongation remains elusive. Inclusion of both TFIIH and ATP, but not other nucleotides, in our experiments, which resulted in the association of TFIIH with the promoter and open complex formation as judged by striking modifications in enzyme-promoter interactions immediately upstream of the transcriptional initiation site, did not cause the conversion of subunit IIa to IIo (data not shown). This finding suggests that extensive phosphorylation of the CTD occurs only after the formation of the first phosphodiester bond.Recently, a number of laboratories have provided evidence that the CTD of RNAP II is involved in the coupling of mRNA processing to transcription, probably by promoting the recruitment of processing factors to nascent RNA attached to elongating polymerase. If this notion is correct, the conformation of RNAP II on the DNA of an elongation complex must allow the juxtaposition of the CTD and the RNA exit channel at the surface of the enzyme. Recently, Goldfarb and co-workers (47Nudler E. Gusarov I. Avetissova E. Kozlov M. Goldfarb A. Science. 1998; 281: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) have determined the spatial organization of the transcriptional elongation complex in E. coli. These authors concluded that the RNA exit channel co-localizes with the point where DNA enters the complex. This striking observation indicates that the nascent transcript exits the elongation complex in a direction oriented toward the downstream end of the DNA relative to the catalytic center (a tentative model is presented in Fig. 3 C). Our observation that the CTD makes promoter contacts in the +16/+26 region indicates that there is a close juxtaposition of the CTD and the RNA exit channel in the initiation complex. This conclusion fully supports a role for the CTD in the recruitment of mRNA processing factors to the vicinity of the nascent transcript during transcription. The accessibility of the CTD to IgG observed in our experiments is also consistent with this conclusion. The CTD must be accessible not only to the SRB-mediator complex during assembly of the pre-initiation complex and to pre-mRNA processing factors during elongation but also to kinases and phosphatases that have been shown to modulate its phosphorylation during the transcription cycle. Our results are fully compatible with this idea.Whether or not the phosphorylation of the CTD induces a conformational change that repositions the CTD of elongating RNAP II relative to the DNA cannot be resolved by our experiments. Because the juxtaposition of the CTD with the RNA exit channel is likely to be required for mRNA processing, we speculate that the promoter contact by the CTD approximately 20 base pairs downstream of the catalytic center would be maintained during elongation. Laybourn and Dahmus (48Laybourn P.J. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6693-6698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that elongating RNAP II is more sensitive to proteolytic cleavage of its CTD than is the free enzyme. We speculate that interaction of the CTD with general initiation factors or DNA near position +17 may increase the exposure to protease of the site where the CTD attaches to the body of the enzyme (see Fig. 3 B), consequently facilitating proteolytic cleavage. The CTD1 of Rpb1, the largest subunit of RNAP II, contains a seven-amino acid motif tandemly repeated 52 times in humans and 26–27 times in yeast (reviewed in Ref.1Young R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 689-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). This repeated heptapeptide has the consensus sequence Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser and is highly conserved among eukaryotic organisms. The CTD is essential for cell viability (2Nonet M. Sweetser D.

https://openalex.org/W2070529426,"In the hydrolytic reaction catalyzed by an endoglucanase from a Bacillus strain (endoglucanase K), 2 of 12 Trp residues, Trp174 and Trp243, are responsible for binding of the substrate and/or for the catalysis (Kawaminami, S., Ozaki, K., Sumitomo, N., Hayashi, Y., Ito, S., Shimada, I., and Arata, Y. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 28752–28756). Here we report results of a stable isotope-aided NMR analysis of the active site of endoglucanase K, using Trp174 and Trp243 as structural probes. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments performed for the NH protons of main and side chains of Trp residues revealed that Trp174and Trp243 are located in the hydrophilic and hydrophobic microenvironments in the active site, respectively. We also carried out pH titration experiments for indole C2 proton resonances of Trp residues and measured the pH dependence of specific activities for wild-type endoglucanase K and its mutants in which Glu or Asp residues are replaced with their respective amide forms. On the basis of the results obtained from the present study, we conclude that (a) Glu130 and Asp191, which are in spatial proximity to Trp174 and Trp243 in the active site, play a crucial role in the enzymatic activity; (b) Glu130 and Asp191 interact with each other in the active site, leading to an increase in the pK a values to 5.5 for both amino acid residues; and (c) the pK a values of Glu130 and Asp191 would lead to an unusually narrow pH-activity profile of the endoglucanase K. In the hydrolytic reaction catalyzed by an endoglucanase from a Bacillus strain (endoglucanase K), 2 of 12 Trp residues, Trp174 and Trp243, are responsible for binding of the substrate and/or for the catalysis (Kawaminami, S., Ozaki, K., Sumitomo, N., Hayashi, Y., Ito, S., Shimada, I., and Arata, Y.

The structural data have also suggested that Trp residues are involved in the binding of substrates and are often found near catalytic residues such as Asp and Glu residues in the active site. Endoglucanase K (EGK,1molecular mass = 46 kDa) is isolated from Bacillus sp. KSM-330 (4Ozaki K. Ito S. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which belongs to family 8 in glycosyl hydrolases (family D) and hydrolyzes a 1,4-β-glycosidic bond. The gene encoding EGK has been cloned and sequenced (17Ozaki K. Sumitomo N. Ito S. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 2299-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and the results of site-directed mutagenesis suggested that 1 Glu and 3 Asp residues, i.e.Glu130, Asp191, Asp193, and Asp300, are responsible for the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme (18Ozaki K. Sumitomo N. Hayashi Y. Kawai S. Ito S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1207: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The pH range of the maximum activity for EGK is unusually narrow as compared with those of O-(carboxymethyl)cellulases produced by other bacterial strains (4Ozaki K. Ito S. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). NMR studies have shown that EGK hydrolyzes the glycosidic bond with inversion of the anomeric configuration (19Kawaminami S. Ozaki K. Ito S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has also been demonstrated that 2 of the 12 Trp residues, Trp174 and Trp243, play an important role in binding of the substrate and/or in the catalytic activity (20Kawaminami S. Ozaki K. Sumitomo N. Hayashi Y. Ito S. Shimada I. Arata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28752-28756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that Trp174 and Trp243 are involved in the active site of EGK. This observation suggests that Trp174 and Trp243 could be used as structural probes for a better understanding of the enzymatic mechanism of EGK. In the present study, in order to gain a deeper insight into the active site of EGK, we prepared mutant enzymes, in which the putative catalytic residues Glu130, Asp191, Asp193, and Asp300 are individually modified to their respective amide form and measured the specific activities of the mutants. By using the mutants and wild-type EGK in a stable isotope-aided NMR analysis, we followed the hydrogen-deuterium exchange of the amide and indole NH protons of the Trp residues and investigated the pH dependence of the indole C2 proton chemical shifts. The enzymatic mechanism of EGK is discussed on the basis of the NMR data obtained. All l-Trp labeled with isotopes (13C or 15N) used in this study were purchased from ICON Service Inc. (Summit, NJ). The isotope enrichment was above 95% for all labeled l-Trp. D2O (99.9% pure) was purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Other amino acids and chemicals were of reagent grade and were used without further purification. A fragment of DNA encoding EGK was subcloned into the expression vector pHSP64. The resultant recombinant plasmid, pHSP-KC331, was then introduced intoBacillus subtilis ISW1214 by the protoplast transformation procedure as reported previously (20Kawaminami S. Ozaki K. Sumitomo N. Hayashi Y. Ito S. Shimada I. Arata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28752-28756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). B. subtilis ISW1214 harboring pHSP-KC331 was propagated at 30 °C for 1 day in an amino acid medium supplemented with 15 mg/ml tetracycline. l-Trp in the medium was replaced with 50 mg/mll-[15N2]Trp. The recombinant cells produced [15N2-Trp]EGK extracellularly at a level corresponding to 0.1 g/liter. The [15N2-Trp]EGK was purified to homogeneity from the spent culture medium, as described previously (20Kawaminami S. Ozaki K. Sumitomo N. Hayashi Y. Ito S. Shimada I. Arata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28752-28756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [Trp]EGK, [α-15N-Trp]EGK and [15N-Trp]EGK, which were labeled withl-[indole-2-13C]Trp,l-[α-15N]Trp, andl-[indole- 15N]Trp, respectively, were also prepared and purified in a similar way. Oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis was performed by the method of Kunkel et al.(21Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). Mutant genes obtained were cloned into B. subtilisISW1214 using pHSP64 (22Sumitomo N. Ozaki K. Hitomi J. Kawaminami S. Kobayashi T. Kawai S. Ito S. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1995; 59: 2172-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The mutant enzymes, with replacement of Glu130 by Gln (E130Q), Asp191 by Asn (D191N), Asp193 by Asn (D193N), and Asp300 by Asn (D300N), were produced and purified as described elsewhere (18Ozaki K. Sumitomo N. Hayashi Y. Kawai S. Ito S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1207: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Activities of EGK and its mutants were measured by the dinitrosalycilic acid method as described previously (4Ozaki K. Ito S. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 20Kawaminami S. Ozaki K. Sumitomo N. Hayashi Y. Ito S. Shimada I. Arata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28752-28756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of enzymatic activity was defined as the amount of protein that liberated 1 μmol of reducing sugar as glucose/min under the standard conditions. Protein was quantified by the procedure of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar) with bovine plasma albumin as the standard and a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). pH dependence of the enzymatic activity was measured by running the standard assay at 40 °C, using citric acid-sodium citrate buffer (100 mm), sodium phosphate buffer (100 mm), and Tris/HCl buffer (100 mm) for pH ranges 4.2–5.8, 6.2–6.5, and 7.1–8.2, respectively. For NMR measurements, 0.5–1 mm solutions of enzymes in 10 mm phosphate buffer prepared with D2O for 1H-13C shift correlation spectra or 10% D2O for1H-15N shift correlation spectra, pH 5.2, containing 150 mm NaCl and 3 mm NaN3, were used. All two-dimensional heteronuclear single-quantum coherence spectra (HSQC) (24Boudenhausen G. Ruben D.J. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1980; 69: 185-189Crossref Scopus (2435) Google Scholar, 25Norwood T.J. Boyd J. Cambell I.D. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 369-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) were recorded in the phase-sensitive mode, which combined with a water-flip back pulse sequence (26Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1015) Google Scholar), on a JNM α 500 spectrometer (JEOL). Spectral widths were 7400 Hz for1H and 1519 Hz for 15N in1H-15N HSQC measurements and 6000 Hz for1H and 2514 Hz for 13C in1H-13C HSQC measurements. In all measurements except for hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments, the probe temperature was set to 30 °C. To obtain spectra of the hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments, the probe temperature was set to 20 °C. The total measuring time was 10–20 h. Processing of data were done using the same conditions as previously reported (20Kawaminami S. Ozaki K. Sumitomo N. Hayashi Y. Ito S. Shimada I. Arata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28752-28756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chemical shifts are given in parts/million relative to calibrated resonance of an internal dioxane (for 13C chemical shift) or formamide (for 15N chemical shift) in buffer solution. [15N2-Trp]EGK solution used for hydrogen-deuterium exchange was prepared at 4 °C in deuterated 10 mm phosphate buffer, pD 5.2, containing 150 mm NaCl and 3 mm NaN3. Subsequently, the sample was incubated for 10 h at 20 °C. Preparations of enzymes for pH titration used were wild-type EGK and four mutant EGKs, E130Q, D191N, D193N, and D300N, which were each labeled withl-[indole-2-13C]Trp (designated [Trp]EGK, [Trp]E130Q, [Trp]D191N, [Trp]D193N, and [Trp]D300N, respectively). Assignments of resonances of these spectra were described previously (20Kawaminami S. Ozaki K. Sumitomo N. Hayashi Y. Ito S. Shimada I. Arata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28752-28756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pD values given were direct pH meter readings at 25 °C and were adjusted with dilute DCl or NaOD solution. All cross-peaks originating from the N-H groups of main and side chains of Trp residues of [15N2-Trp]EGK (a through x), except for partially overlapped cross-peaks d, e, p, and q, were separately observed in a 1H-15N HSQC spectrum (Fig. 1), as expected from the amino acid sequence of EGK (17Ozaki K. Sumitomo N. Ito S. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 2299-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Different types of stable isotope labeled Trps, i.e. l-[α-15N]Trp andl-[indole-15N]Trp, were used to classify the cross peaks into those of the main and side chains of Trp residues. Moreover, in order to assign the classified cross-peaks to Trp174 and Trp243 in the1H-15N HSQC spectrum, we prepared mutant enzymes, in which each of the Trp residues at positions 174 and 243 was replaced by Tyr residue using site-directed mutagenesis. Hereafter, the mutant EGKs labeled with eitherl-[α-15N]Trp orl-[indole-15N]Trp are designated as [α-15N-Trp]W174Y, [α-15N-Trp]W243Y, [15N-Trp]W174Y, and [15N-Trp]W243Y. Fig.2, a and b, show1H-15N HSQC spectra observed for [α-15N-Trp]W174Y and [15N-Trp]W174Y, respectively. By comparison of the 1H-15N HSQC spectra among wild-type EGK and the mutants, it was indicated that the cross-peaks, a through l, in Fig. 1 are due to the main chains of Trp residues, and that the peaks, m through x, are due to the side chains. It was also indicated that no cross peaks corresponding to peaks l and s were observed in Fig. 2, a and b, respectively. Since the chemical shifts of the other 11 cross-peaks for the labeled mutant EGKs are very similar to those for [15N2-Trp]EGK, the cross-peak l and s were assigned to the main and side chains of Trp174, respectively. In a similar manner, the assignments for the main and side chains of Trp243 were established, and the results are summarized in Table I.Table IAssignment of the cross-peaks of Trp174 and Trp243 in the 1H–15N HSQC spectrum of [15N2-Trp]EGKCross-peakShiftTrpa(s) and (m) indicate the side and main chains, respectively.1H15Nppmc7.18117.80Trp243(m)l9.31119.86Trp174(m)s10.18130.99Trp174(s)u10.32132.31Trp243(s)Errors in the chemical shifts of 1H and 15N dimensions are ±0.01 and ±0.06 ppm, respectively.a (s) and (m) indicate the side and main chains, respectively.

Fig. 3shows a 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of [15N2-Trp]EGK observed at 20 °C in an deuterated 10 mm phosphate buffer. The cross-peaks for the side and main chains of Trp174 could not be observed due to the rapid hydrogen-deuterium exchange process, whereas those of Trp243 were able to be measured even in the D2O solution. After 20 h of the hydrogen-deuterium exchange reaction, the cross-peak of the side chain of Trp243 disappeared from the spectrum, but no change in the intensity of the main chain cross-peak of Trp243 was observed (data not shown). Fig. 4 shows specific activities of wild-type and mutant EGKs measured over the pH range of 4.2 to 8.2. While the pH dependence of the specific activity for wild-type EGK indicated the narrow spectrum with the maximum activity of pH 5.2 (Fig. 4 a), the introduction of the mutation for E130Q and D191N led to almost a complete loss of activity, and the residual activities had broad pH-activity profiles (Fig. 4,b and c). In contrast, for D193N and D300N (Fig.4, d and e), the specific activities were maintained as 2.2 and 5.3% of that for wild-type EGK, respectively, and the pH profiles of both the mutants were quite similar to that of the wild-type EGK. To examine interactions between the two Trp residues (Trp174 and Trp243) and the putative catalytic residues (18Ozaki K. Sumitomo N. Hayashi Y. Kawai S. Ito S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1207: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the pH dependence of indole ring proton resonances at the C2 position of Trp residues were examined for wild-type EGK ([Trp]EGK) and mutant EGKs such as [Trp]E130Q, [Trp]D191N, [Trp]D193N, and [Trp]D300N. It was not possible to follow the pH dependence below pH 4.0 and above pH 8.0 due to the instability of the wild-type and mutant EGKs. Fig. 5 a shows the pH dependence of the chemical shifts of the indole C2 proton resonances of Trp174 and Trp243 in [Trp]EGK. The C2 proton resonances for both Trp residues showed a significant pH dependence. The pH titration curves of Trp174 and Trp243observed for [Trp]E130Q (Fig. 5 b) and [Trp]D191N (Fig.5 c) were almost flat in the measured pH range. As shown in Fig. 5, d and e, the pH dependence observed for [Trp]D193N and [Trp]D300N were very similar to those in [Trp]EGK. In the previous paper (20Kawaminami S. Ozaki K. Sumitomo N. Hayashi Y. Ito S. Shimada I. Arata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28752-28756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have demonstrated that 2 Trp residues at positions 174 and 243 of EGK play an important role in the substrate binding and/or the catalytic activity. The conclusion is based upon (a) Trp174 and Trp243 interact with cellotriose, an inhibitor of EGK; (b) the two Trp residues are oxidized byN-bromosuccinimide in a stepwise way, i.e.Trp174 was oxidized first with a retention of 56% of the original activity, followed by the oxidation of Trp243 with complete loss of activity; (c) substitution of Trp174 and Trp243 with Tyr residues results in a decrease in the specific activity to 49 and 8%, respectively; (d) K m values of the two mutant enzymes (W174Y, W243Y) increase five and eight times that of the wild-type enzyme, respectively; and (e) thek cat values of both mutant enzymes become one-fifth of that of the wild-type enzyme. In order to investigate microenvironments of these Trp residues, hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments were carried out in the present study. The results obtained indicated that the hydrogen-deuterium exchange rates of the amide and indole protons of Trp174are faster than those of Trp243. Therefore, we suggest that the main and side chains of Trp174 are exposed to solvent and those of Trp243 are located in a hydrophobic microenvironment and are buried in the active site. It might be expected that the mutation at position 243 could cause a significant conformational change of the active site to reduce the enzymatic activity. Therefore, we conclude that the difference in the microenvironment between Trp174 and Trp243 is responsible for the difference in the specific activities observed between W174Y and W243Y. This can also explain the reason why Trp174 is more susceptible to oxidation byN-bromosuccinimide than Trp243 (20Kawaminami S. Ozaki K. Sumitomo N. Hayashi Y. Ito S. Shimada I. Arata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28752-28756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our previous study, the conserved carboxylate residues in all the endo-β-glucanases in family 8, Glu130, Asp191, Asp193, and Asp300 in EGK, are responsible for the catalytic reaction (18Ozaki K. Sumitomo N. Hayashi Y. Kawai S. Ito S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1207: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the role of these carboxylate residues in the enzymatic mechanism of EGK, we carried out measurements of pH dependence of the specific activities and pH titration experiments by using the wild-type and mutant enzymes, E130Q, D191N, D193N, and D300N. On the basis of the results from the pH dependence of the specific activities, it is clearly indicated that Glu130 and Asp191 play a crucial role in the enzymatic activity of EGK. The specific activities for E130Q and D191N are enormously reduced over the range of pH 4.2 to 8.0, no longer indicating any obvious pH dependence. In contrast, the pH-activity profiles for D193N and D300N are little affected, compared with that of wild-type EGK, although the specific activities for the mutants are reduced. Therefore, it is suggested that the mutations introduced at positions 193 and 300 cause less of a drastic change in the active site as those as positions 130 and 191. As shown in Fig. 5, the chemical shifts of the indole C2 protons of Trp174 and Trp243 of wild-type EGK are dependent upon the pH of the solvent. The results indicate that both the pK a values determined by the chemical shifts of the two Trp residues are approximately 5.5. This result strongly suggests that in the active site one or more acidic amino acid residues exist in close spatial proximity to Trp174 and Trp243. The mutation introduced at Glu130 or Asp191 of EGK induced drastic changes in the pH dependence of the chemical shifts of the indole C2 protons of both Trp174 and Trp243, indicating that Glu130 and Asp191 are located in the neighborhood of Trp174 and Trp243 in the active site. For [Trp]E130Q and [Trp]D191N (Fig. 5, b and c), no significant transition is observed for [Trp]EGK in the low pH range (Fig. 5 a), although it is expected that a transition due to pK a of Asp191 and Glu130 would be observed in the pH profile for [Trp]E130Q and [Trp]D191N, respectively. It is most likely that the pK a values of Asp191 in [Trp]E130Q and Glu130 in [Trp]D191N are below 4.0. On the basis of the results from the pH titration experiment, it is suggested that Glu130 and Asp191 are in close spatial proximity to Trp174 and Trp243 and that Glu130 and Asp191 interact with each other in the active site of EGK. This would increase the pK avalues of both Glu130 and Asp191 to 5.5, considering that the pK a values of 5.5 are only observed in the wild-type EGK not in either E130Q or D191N. It is observed that the chemical shifts for Trp174 and Trp243 of the wild-type EGK are significantly affected by the ionic strength of the sample solution. By lowering the concentration of NaCl from 150 mm to 0 mm, the entire pH profile of the chemical shifts for Trp174 and Trp243 of wild-type EGK shifted toward the high pH region, indicating that electrostatic interaction exists between Glu130 and Asp191 (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 5, d and e, the pH dependence of Trp174 and Trp243 for [Trp]D193N and [Trp]D300N indicate the pK a values are almost same as that for the wild-type enzyme. Therefore, we conclude that the replacements at Asp193 or Asp300 cause no effect on the pK a of Glu130 and Asp191 in the mutants. However, it is also indicated that the chemical shifts of Trp243 in both the mutants are slightly different from those for wild-type enzyme and are shifted to an upper field over the pH range 4.0 to 7.0, indicating that the mutations at Asp193 or Asp300 result in small structural changes in the active-site, which lead to some loss of enzymatic activity. This result is also in a complete agreement with the finding from the pH dependence of the specific activities for D193N and D300N that the pH-activity profiles for the mutants are quite similar to that of wild-type EGK, although the specific activities of the mutants are reduced. Recently, the three-dimensional structure of CelA fromClostridium thermocellum, which is the same family as EGK, has been determined (9Alzari P.M. Souchon H. Dominguez R. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Comparison of the amino acid sequences of CelA (27Béguin P. Cornet P. Aubert J.-P. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 102-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and EGK (17Ozaki K. Sumitomo N. Ito S. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 2299-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) is shown in Fig. 6. Although there is relatively a low amino acid sequence identity (27.7% within 397 amino acid residues) between EGK and CelA, the residues that are responsible for the enzymatic activity, including Trp174 and Trp243 in EGK, are conserved at the corresponding positions in CelA. It has been demonstrated that Trp132, Trp205, Glu95, Asp152, Asp154, and Asp259 in CelA correspond to Trp174, Trp243, Glu130, Asp191, Asp193, and Asp300 in EGK, respectively. Trp132 and Trp205 in CelA are located on the surface of the active site cleft (Fig.7). The indole NH proton of Trp132 in CelA is oriented to the outer direction, while that of Trp205 is directed toward the inside of the active site. Furthermore, both Glu95 and Asp152(Glu130 and Asp191 in EGK) are in close spatial proximity to Trp132 and Trp205(Trp174 and Trp243 in EGK) and Asp154 and Asp259 are far away from the active site. These observations are consistent with the results obtained in the present NMR study. We have indicated that the pH activity curve of EGK shows a very narrow pH range and the optimum pH value is 5.2 in the previous study (4Ozaki K. Ito S. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). No enzyme that possesses such the narrow pH-activity profile for O-(carboxymethyl)cellulase activity is known, except for endo- and exoglucanases from Trichoderma harzianum (28Sidhu M.S. Kalra M.K. Sandhu D.K. Folia Microbiol. 1986; 31: 293-302Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, the pH dependence of the activity of the fungal enzymes is due to the instability of the enzymes at both low and high pH. A pair of carboxylates has required in the inversion mechanism of glycosyl hydrolases, one carboxylate residue acts as a general acid and the other as a general base (29Henrissat B. Davies G. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 853-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar). The pK a values of the catalytic residues are the decisive factor of the pH-activity profile of the glycosyl hydrolase. Along with the fact that E130Q and D191N indicate no remarkable pH dependence of specific activity over the pH range 4.2 to 8.0, we conclude that Glu130 and Asp191, which are the catalytic residues in EGK, possess the same pK a value of 5.5, which explains the unusually narrow pH-activity profile of the EGK. As described in the introduction, Trp residues are found in the binding site in a number of glycosyl hydrolases. Therefore, the use of Trp residues as structural probes in stable isotope-aided NMR analysis can be a general method for the investigation of the enzymatic mechanism of glycosyl hydrolases."
