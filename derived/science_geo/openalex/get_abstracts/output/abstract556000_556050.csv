https://openalex.org/W2195134359,"Elements heavier than zinc are synthesized through the (r)apid and (s)low neutron-capture processes. The main site of production of the r-process elements (such as europium) has been debated for nearly 60 years. Initial studies of chemical abundance trends in old Milky Way halo stars suggested continual r-process production, in sites like core-collapse supernovae. But evidence from the local Universe favors r-process production mainly during rare events, such as neutron star mergers. The appearance of a europium abundance plateau in some dwarf spheroidal galaxies has been suggested as evidence for rare r-process enrichment in the early Universe, but only under the assumption of no gas accretion into the dwarf galaxies. Cosmologically motivated gas accretion favors continual r-process enrichment in these systems. Furthermore, the universal r-process pattern has not been cleanly identified in dwarf spheroidals. The smaller, chemically simpler, and more ancient ultra-faint dwarf galaxies assembled shortly after the first stars formed, and are ideal systems with which to study nucleosynthesis events such as the r-process. Reticulum II is one such galaxy. The abundances of non-neutron-capture elements in this galaxy (and others like it) are similar to those of other old stars. Here, we report that seven of nine stars in Reticulum II observed with high-resolution spectroscopy show strong enhancements in heavy neutron-capture elements, with abundances that follow the universal r-process pattern above barium. The enhancement in this ""r-process galaxy"" is 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than that detected in any other ultra-faint dwarf galaxy. This implies that a single rare event produced the r-process material in Reticulum II. The r-process yield and event rate are incompatible with ordinary core-collapse supernovae, but consistent with other possible sites, such as neutron star mergers."

https://openalex.org/W2304421282,"Instinctive reactions to danger are critical to the perpetuation of species and are observed throughout the animal kingdom. The scent of predators induces an instinctive fear response in mice that includes behavioural changes, as well as a surge in blood stress hormones that mobilizes multiple body systems to escape impending danger. How the olfactory system routes predator signals detected in the nose to achieve these effects is unknown. Here we identify a specific area of the olfactory cortex in mice that induces stress hormone responses to volatile predator odours. Using monosynaptic and polysynaptic viral tracers, we found that multiple olfactory cortical areas transmit signals to hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons, which control stress hormone levels. However, only one minor cortical area, the amygdalo-piriform transition area (AmPir), contained neurons upstream of CRH neurons that were activated by volatile predator odours. Chemogenetic stimulation of AmPir activated CRH neurons and induced an increase in blood stress hormones, mimicking an instinctive fear response. Moreover, chemogenetic silencing of AmPir markedly reduced the stress hormone response to predator odours without affecting a fear behaviour. These findings suggest that AmPir, a small area comprising <5% of the olfactory cortex, plays a key part in the hormonal component of the instinctive fear response to volatile predator scents."
https://openalex.org/W2302911970,"The development of metabolic tracers reveals that malic enzyme is the main contributor of NADPH production in differentiating adipocytes. During hypoxic conditions, the source of NADPH shifts to the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. The critical cellular hydride donor NADPH is produced through various means, including the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (oxPPP), folate metabolism and malic enzyme. In growing cells, it is efficient to produce NADPH via the oxPPP and folate metabolism, which also make nucleotide precursors. In nonproliferating adipocytes, a metabolic cycle involving malic enzyme holds the potential to make both NADPH and two-carbon units for fat synthesis. Recently developed deuterium (2H) tracer methods have enabled direct measurement of NADPH production by the oxPPP and folate metabolism. Here we enable tracking of NADPH production by malic enzyme with [2,2,3,3-2H]dimethyl-succinate and [4-2H]glucose. Using these tracers, we show that most NADPH in differentiating 3T3-L1 mouse adipocytes is made by malic enzyme. The associated metabolic cycle is disrupted by hypoxia, which switches the main adipocyte NADPH source to the oxPPP. Thus, 2H-labeled tracers enable dissection of NADPH production routes across cell types and environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2324298026,"Parthenolide (PTL), a major active sesquiterpene lactone from the herbal plant Tanacetum parthenium, has been applied in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries. Although PTL demonstrates potent anticancer efficacy in numerous types of malignant cells, the cellular targets of PTL have not been well defined. We reported here that PTL interacts with both cytosolic thioredoxin reductase (TrxR1) and mitochondrial thioredoxin reductase (TrxR2), two ubiquitous selenocysteine-containing antioxidant enzymes, to elicit reactive oxygen species-mediated apoptosis in HeLa cells. PTL selectively targets the selenocysteine residue in TrxR1 to inhibit the enzyme function, and further shifts the enzyme to an NADPH oxidase to generate superoxide anions, leading to reactive oxygen species accumulation and oxidized thioredoxin. Under the conditions of inhibition of TrxRs in cells, PTL does not cause significant alteration of cellular thiol homeostasis, supporting selective target of TrxRs by PTL. Importantly, overexpression of functional TrxR1 or Trx1 confers protection, whereas knockdown of the enzymes sensitizes cells to PTL treatment. Targeting TrxRs by PTL thus discloses an unprecedented mechanism underlying the biological activity of PTL, and provides deep insights to understand the action of PTL in treatment of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2308708607,"Plant structural diversity is usually considered as beneficial for ecosystem functioning. For instance, numerous studies have reported positive species diversity-productivity relationships in plant communities. However, other aspects of structural diversity such as individual size inequality have been far less investigated. In forests, tree size inequality impacts directly tree growth and asymmetric competition, but consequences on forest productivity are still indeterminate. In addition, the effect of tree size inequality on productivity is likely to vary with species shade-tolerance, a key ecological characteristic controlling asymmetric competition and light resource acquisition. Using plot data from the French National Geographic Agency, we studied the response of stand productivity to size inequality for ten forest species differing in shade tolerance. We fitted a basal area stand production model that included abiotic factors, stand density, stand development stage and a tree size inequality index. Then, using a forest dynamics model we explored whether mechanisms of light interception and light use efficiency could explain the tree size inequality effect observed for three of the ten species studied. Size inequality negatively affected basal area increment for seven out of the ten species investigated. However, this effect was not related to the shade tolerance of these species. According to the model simulations, the negative tree size inequality effect could result both from reduced total stand light interception and reduced light use efficiency. Our results demonstrate that negative relationships between size inequality and productivity may be the rule in tree populations. The lack of effect of shade tolerance indicates compensatory mechanisms between effect on light availability and response to light availability. Such a pattern deserves further investigations for mixed forests where complementarity effects between species are involved. When studying the effect of structural diversity on ecosystem productivity, tree size inequality is a major facet that should be taken into account."

Although the redox reactions are critical for efficient mitochondrial metabolism, they are not accompanied by any net consumption of the nucleotide. On the contrary, NAD+-dependent signaling processes lead to its degradation. Three distinct families of enzymes consume NAD+ as substrate: poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases, ADP-ribosyl cyclases (CD38 and CD157), and sirtuins (SIRT1–7). Because all of the above enzymes generate nicotinamide as a byproduct, mammalian cells have evolved an NAD+ salvage pathway capable of resynthesizing NAD+ from nicotinamide. Overexpression of the rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, increases total and mitochondrial NAD+ levels in astrocytes. Moreover, targeting nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase to the mitochondria also enhances NAD+ salvage pathway in astrocytes. Supplementation with the NAD+ precursors nicotinamide mononucleotide and nicotinamide riboside also increases NAD+ levels in astrocytes. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is caused by the progressive degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord, brain stem, and motor cortex. Superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) mutations account for up to 20% of familial ALS and 1–2% of apparently sporadic ALS cases. Primary astrocytes isolated from mutant human superoxide dismutase 1-overexpressing mice as well as human post-mortem ALS spinal cord-derived astrocytes induce motor neuron death in co-culture. Increasing total and mitochondrial NAD+ content in ALS astrocytes increases oxidative stress resistance and reverts their toxicity toward co-cultured motor neurons. Taken together, our results suggest that enhancing the NAD+ salvage pathway in astrocytes could be a potential therapeutic target to prevent astrocyte-mediated motor neuron death in ALS.

https://openalex.org/W2302771385,"Human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is a solid tumor malignancy associated with major morbidity and mortality. In this study, we determined that human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma-derived HSC-3 cells contain a subpopulation of cancer stem cells (CSCs) characterized by a high level of CD44v3 and aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 (ALDH1) expression. Importantly, matrix hyaluronan (HA) induces the up-regulation of stem cell markers that display the hallmark CSC properties. Histone methyltransferase, DOT1L, is also up-regulated by HA in CSCs (isolated from HSC-3 cells). Further analyses indicate that the stimulation of microRNA-10b (miR-10b) expression is DOT1L-specific and HA/CD44-dependent in CSCs. This process subsequently results in the overexpression of RhoGTPases and survival proteins leading to tumor cell invasion and cisplatin resistance. Treatment of CSCs with DOT1L-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) effectively blocks HA/CD44-mediated expression of DOT1L, miR-10b production, and RhoGTPase/survival protein up-regulation as well as reduces tumor cell invasion and enhances chemosensitivity. CSCs were also transfected with a specific anti-miR-10b inhibitor to silence miR-10b expression and block its target functions. Our results demonstrate that the anti-miR-10 inhibitor not only decreases RhoGTPase/survival protein expression and tumor cell invasion, but also increases chemosensitivity in HA-treated CSCs. Taken together, these findings strongly support the contention that histone methyltransferase, DOT1L-associated epigenetic changes induced by HA play pivotal roles in miR-10 production leading to up-regulation of RhoGTPase and survival proteins. All of these events are critically important for the acquisition of cancer stem cell properties, including self-renewal, tumor cell invasion, and chemotherapy resistance in HA/CD44-activated head and neck cancer.

A number of studies have identified specific molecules expressed in HNSCC that correlate with tumor behavior. Among such molecules are matrix hyaluronan (HA) (2.Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.

Hyaluronan and tumor growth.Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 745-747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). CD44 is a multifunctional transmembrane glycoprotein expressed in HNSCC cells and carcinoma tissues (6.Wang S.J. Wong G. de Heer A.M. Xia W. Bourguignon L.Y.

It is commonly expressed as various isoforms generated by alternative mRNA splicing of variant exons inserted into an extracellular membrane-proximal site (8.Screaton G.R. Bell M.V. Jackson D.G.

Most importantly, expression of certain CD44 variant (CD44v) isoforms (especially, CD44v3) is known to be associated with HNSCC progression (6.Wang S.J. Wong G. de Heer A.M. Xia W. Bourguignon L.Y.

In fact, CD44v3 is thought to be one of the important cell surface markers for CSCs (10.Bourguignon L.Y. Wong G. Earle C. Chen L.

These isolated CSCs are capable of generating phenotypically distinct cells resulting in heterogeneous tumors in immunodeficient mice. These findings clearly indicate that these CSCs display the hallmark stem cell properties of self-renewal and the ability to generate heterogeneous cell populations. In addition, these CSCs display chemoresistance and thereby can cause recurrence of the cancers (10.Bourguignon L.Y. Wong G. Earle C. Chen L.

However, information regarding CSC-mediated chemotherapy resistance and subsequent HNSCC development is very limited. MicroRNAs ((miRNAs), small RNA molecules with ∼20–25 nucleotides) are closely associated with the pathogenesis of HNSCC (11.Chang S.S. Jiang W.W. Smith I. Poeta L.M. Begum S. Glazer C. Shan S.

In particular, certain miRNAs appear to play a critical role in various CSC functions and tumor progression (9.Bourguignon L.Y. Earle C. Wong G. Spevak C.C. Krueger K. Stem cell marker (Nanog) and Stat-3 signaling promotes MicroRNA-21 expression and chemoresistance in hyaluronan/CD44-activated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells.Oncogene. 2012; 31: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 10.Bourguignon L.Y.

However, very little is known concerning the regulation of these miRNAs and their function in head and neck cancer. In previous studies, miRNA-10b was found to be overexpressed in malignant glioma in addition to the overexpression of RhoC and urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor, which are contributors to glioma invasion and migration (13.Bourguignon L.Y. Xia W. Wong G. Hyaluronan-mediated CD44 interaction with p300 and SIRT1 regulates β-catenin signaling and NFκB-specific transcription activity leading to MDR1 and Bcl-xL gene expression and chemoresistance in breast tumor cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 2657-2671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Moreover, cell invasion and metastasis were both shown to be initiated by miRNA-10b in breast cancer (14.Ma L. Teruya-Feldstein J. Weinberg R.A. Tumour invasion and metastasis initiated by microRNA-10b in breast cancer.Nature. 2007; 449: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar). Silencing of miR-10b with antagomirs (an anti-miR-10 inhibitor) both in vitro and in vivo significantly decreases oncogenesis (15.Bourguignon L.Y. Wong G. Earle C. Krueger K. Spevak C. Hyaluronan-CD44 interaction promotes c-Src-mediated twist signaling, microRNA-10b expression, and RhoA/RhoC up-regulation, leading to Rho-kinase-associated cytoskeleton activation and breast tumor cell invasion.J.

Thus, the miR-10b inhibitor appears to be a promising candidate for the development of new anti-cancer agents. Epigenetic changes such as histone methylation have emerged as one of the important regulatory processes in the alteration of chromatin structure and the reprogramming of gene expression during cancer progression (16.Shilatifard A. Chromatin modifications by methylation and ubiquitination: Implications in the regulation of gene expression.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 243-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Methylation of histone H3 at lysine 79 (H3K79) is highly conserved among most eukaryotic species. In budding yeast, nearly 90% of histone H3 displays either monomethylation (H3K79me1), dimethylation (H3K79me2), or trimethylation (H3K79me3) at lysine 79, all catalyzed exclusively by the histone methyltransferase, DOT1 (17.Ng H.H. Feng Q. Wang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Struhl K.

DOT1 was initially identified as a disruptor of telomeric silencing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and its orthologs are evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals (17.Ng H.H. Feng Q. Wang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Struhl K.

Both DOT1 and the mammalian DOT1L (DOT1-like protein) function as H3K79 methyltransferases in the regulation of histone H3K79 methylation and transcriptional activation (19.Feng Q. Wang H. Ng H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Struhl K. Zhang Y. Methylation of H3-lysine 79 is mediated by a new family of HMTases without a SET domain.Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1052-1058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). In particular, DOT1/DOT1L-mediated H3K79 methylation is known to be involved in the control of transcriptional activity required for cell cycle, meiotic checkpoint, and the DNA damage checkpoint (20.San-Segundo P.A. Roeder G.S. Role for the silencing protein Dot1 in meiotic checkpoint control.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3601-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that aberrant H3K79 methylation by DOT1L occurs in mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) (21.Bernt K.M. Zhu N. Sinha A.U. Vempati S. Faber J. Krivtsov A.V. Feng Z. Punt N. Daigle A. Bullinger L. Pollock R.M. Richon V.M. Kung A.L. Armstrong S.A. MLL-rearranged leukemia is dependent on aberrant H3K79 methylation by DOT1L.Cancer Cell. 2011; 20: 66-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Furthermore, down-regulation of DOT1L results in the inhibition of lung cancer cell proliferation (22.Kim W. Kim R. Park G. Park J.W. Kim J.E. Deficiency of H3K79 histone methyltransferase Dot1-like protein (DOT1L) inhibits cell proliferation.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 5588-5599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These findings all suggest that DOT1L plays an important role in cancer development. An earlier study also indicated that mammalian DOT1L participates in proliferation and differentiation in embryonic stem (ES) cells (23.Janzen C.J. Hake S.B. Lowell J.E. Cross G.A.

The question of whether DOT1L-associated H3K79 methylation is involved in HA-mediated CSC signaling and functions in head and neck cancer has not been previously addressed and therefore is the focus of this investigation. In this study, we report that there is epigenetic regulation induced by DOT1L-mediated H3K79 methylation in HA-activated HNSCC cancer stem cells. Specifically, our results indicate that HA promotes DOT1L-regulated H3K79 methylation leading to miR-10 production, tumor cell invasion, survival, and cisplatin chemoresistance in the CSCs from HNSCC. Tumor-derived HSC-3 cell line (isolated from human squamous carcinoma cells of the mouth) was grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Monoclonal rat anti-CD44 antibody (clone, 020; isotype, IgG2b; obtained from CMB-TECH, Inc., San Francisco) recognizes a determinant of the HA-binding region common to CD44 and its principal variant isoforms such as CD44v3. This rat anti-CD44 was routinely used for HA-related blocking experiments and immunoprecipitation. Other immunoreagents such as rabbit anti-RhoC antibody, rabbit anti-Oct4 antibody, rabbit anti-Nanog antibody, rabbit anti-Sox2 antibody, and goat anti-actin antibody were obtained from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Mouse anti-cIAP-2 antibody and mouse anti-XIAP antibody were purchased from BD Biosciences. Rabbit anti-monomethyl-H3K79 antibody and mouse anti-DOT1L antibody were from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Rabbit anti-CD44v3 antibody was obtained from EMD Chemicals (Gibbstown, NJ). Cisplatin was obtained from Sigma. The preparation of HA (∼500,000–700,000-dalton polymers) used in these experiments was described previously (9.Bourguignon L.Y. Earle C. Wong G. Spevak C.C. Krueger K.

The identification of aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 (ALDH1) activity from tumor-derived HSC-3 cells was conducted using the ALDEFLUOR kit (StemCell Technologies, Durham, NC). Specifically, tumor cells were suspended in ALDEFLUOR assay buffer containing ALDH1 substrate (BAAA, 1 mol/liter per 1 × 106 cells) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. As a negative control, HSC-3 cells were treated with a specific ALDH1 inhibitor, 50 mmol/liter diethylaminobenzaldehyde (50 mmol/liter). Next, for labeling the cell surface marker, tumor-derived HSC-3 cells were suspended in 100 μl of ALDEFLUOR buffer followed by incubating with 20 μl of allophycocyanin (APC)-labeled anti-CD44v3 antibody (recognizing the v3-specifc domain of CD44) or APC-labeled normal mouse IgG (as a control) (BD Biosciences) for 15 min at 4 °C. For FACS sorting, tumor cells were suspended in PBS buffer followed by FACS (BD FACSAria IIu) sorting using dual wavelength analysis (10.Bourguignon L.Y. Wong G. Earle C. Chen L.

Routinely, we obtained 5.0 × 106 of CD44v3highALDH1high cells from 2.5 to 3.0 × 107 tumor-derived HSC-3 cells. Subsequently, CD44v3highALDH1high tumor cell population was collected and used for various experiments described in this study. Approximately 5 × 105 cells were used during each silencing experiment described in the text. Non-obese, diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) immunocompromised mice (5-week-old female mice) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. (Wilmington, MA), and maintained in micro-isolator cages. Specifically, these NOD/SCID mice were injected subcutaneously and/or submucosally in the floor of the mouth with sorted CD44v3highALDH1high cells or unsorted HSC-3 cells (suspended in 0.1 ml of Matrigel Basement Membrane Matrix) ranging from 50, 500, to 5,000 cells as described previously (10.Bourguignon L.Y.

These mice were then monitored twice weekly for palpable tumor formation and euthanized 4 or 8 weeks after transplantation to assess tumor formation. Tumors were measured using a Vernier caliper, weighed, and photographed. A portion of the subcutaneous tumors and/or submucosa tumors was collected. Some tumors were cut into small fragments with sterile scissors and minced with a sterile scalpel, rinsed with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 2% heat-inactivated calf serum (Invitrogen), and centrifuged for 5 min at 1,000 rpm. The resulting tissue specimen was placed in a solution of DMEM/F-12 containing 300 units/ml collagenase and 100 units/ml hyaluronidase (StemCell Technologies, Durham, NC). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C to dissociate cells. The digestion was arrested with the addition of FBS, and the cells were filtered through a 40-μm nylon sieve. The cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution plus 2% heat-inactivated calf serum for FACS as described above. First, CD44v3highALDH1high cells (untransfected cells with normal IgG (10 μg/ml) or anti-CD44 antibody (10 μg/ml) treatment or transfected cells with DOT1L siRNA or siRNA with scrambled sequences; or anti-miR-10b inhibitor or miRNA-negative control treatment followed by HA (50 μg/ml) or no HA addition for 24 h) were solubilized in a lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and various protease inhibitors followed by immunoblotting with various immunoreagents such as anti-Oct4 antibody (2 μg/ml) or anti-Sox2 antibody (2 μg/ml) or anti-Nanog antibody (2 μg/ml) or anti-DOT1L (2 μg/ml) or anti-monomethyl-H3K79 (2 μg/ml) or anti-RhoC (2 μg/ml) or anti-cIAP-2 (2 μg/ml) and anti-XIAP (2 μg/ml) or anti-actin (2 μg/ml) (as a loading control), respectively. To examine whether H3K79 methylation directly interacts with the E-box region of miR-10b promoter, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays was performed in CD44v3highALDH1high cells (untransfected cells with normal IgG (10 μg/ml) or anti-CD44 antibody (10 μg/ml) treatment or transfected with DOT1L siRNA or siRNA with scrambled sequences, followed by 1 h of HA (50 μg/ml) or no HA addition) using a kit (EZ ChIP) from Millipore Corp. according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA fragments were then extracted with a PCR purification kit and analyzed by PCR or quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) using primer pairs 5′-ACCTGGCTTGGTCGGGCAGT-3′ and 5′-CGCAGCCACCCGCACTTTCT-3′. These primers gave a single strong band when tested on input DNA on an agarose gel. Total RNA was isolated from CD44v3highALDH1high cells (untransfected cells with rat anti-CD44 (10 μg/ml) or normal rat IgG (10 μg/ml) or transfected with DOT1LsiRNA (30 nm) or siRNA with scrambled sequences (30 nm); or anti-miR-10b inhibitor (30 nm) or miRNA-negative control (30 nm) followed by HA (50 μg/ml) or no HA addition for 24 h) using Tripure Isolation Reagent kits (Roche Applied Science). First-stranded cDNAs were synthesized from RNA using Superscript first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). Gene expression was quantified using probe-based SYBR Green PCR master mix kits, ABI PRISM 7900HT sequence detection system, and SDS software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). A cycle threshold (minimal PCR cycles required for generating a fluorescent signal exceeding a preset threshold) was determined for each gene of interest and normalized to a cycle threshold for a housekeeping gene (36B4) determined in parallel. The 36B4 is a human acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein PO whose expression was not changed in tumor cells. The Q-PCR primers used for detecting miR-10b expression was as follows: specifically, two miR-10b-specific primers (the sense primer 5′-GGATACCCTGTAGAACCGAA and the antisense primer 5′-CAGTGCGTGTCGTGGAGT) were used. Finally, for detecting 36B4 gene expression, two 36B4-specific primers (the sense primer 5′-GCGACCTGGAAGTCCAACTAC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-ATCTGCTGCATCTGCTTGG-3′) were used. miR-10b inhibitor, miRNA-negative control, various siRNAs targeting DOT1L, RhoC, cIAP-2, XIAP, and scrambled sequenced siRNAs (negative control siRNAs) were purchased from Ambion (Foster City, CA). CD44v3highALDH1high cells were then transfected with various reagents (described above) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) for 24 h. The final concentrations of anti-miR-10b inhibitor, miRNA-negative control, various siRNAs, and silencer negative control siRNAs used in various experiments were 30 nm. Cells were then treated with HA or without HA in various experiments as described below. IRB approval was obtained from our institution's Committee on Human Research. The clinical tissue specimens were portions of primary tumors of patients undergoing surgical treatment of HNSCC from multiple primary sites of the upper aerodigestive tract at the University of California at San Francisco-affiliated Veterans Affairs Medical Center from September 1, 2001, to June 30, 2006. The presence of ≥80% cancer cells in the procured samples was confirmed by a clinical pathologist. Human HNSCC patient tissue specimens were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer for 24 h at 4 °C and embedded in paraffin. Immunohistochemical stains using rabbit anti-CD44v3 antibody or rabbit anti-DOT1L antibody were performed using the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. To analyze growth properties, these sphere-derived CD44v3highALDH1high cells (untransfected cells with rat anti-CD44 (10 μg/ml) or normal rat IgG (10 μg/ml), or transfected with DOT1LsiRNA or RhoCsiRNA or cIAP-2siRNA or XIPAsiRNA, or scrambled sequenced siRNA, or pretreated with anti-miR-10b inhibitor or miRNA-negative control) were also incubated with various concentrations of cisplatin (4 × 10−9 to 1.75 × 10−5 m) in the presence or absence of HA (50 μg/ml). After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, growth assays were analyzed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Specifically, 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was identified as a concentration of drug required to achieve a 50% growth inhibition relative to untreated controls as described previously (10.Bourguignon L.Y.

Twenty four transwell units were used for monitoring in vitro tumor cell invasion using CD44v3highALDH1high (untransfected cells with rat anti-CD44 (10 μg/ml) or normal rat IgG (10 μg/ml) or transfected with DOT1LsiRNA or RhoCsiRNA or cIAP-2siRNA or XIPAsiRNA or siRNA with scrambled sequences; or anti-miR-10b inhibitor or miRNA-negative control) followed by HA (50 μg/ml) treatment for 24 h as described previously (15.Bourguignon L.Y.

Using this approach, VPyr-Cyc/VMito was only 6% in overnight fasted rats. In contrast, when propionate was infused simultaneously at doses previously used as a tracer, it increased VPyr-Cyc/VMito by 20–30-fold, increased hepatic TCA metabolite concentrations 2–3-fold, and increased endogenous glucose production rates by 20–100%. The physiologic stimuli, glucagon and epinephrine, both increased hepatic glucose production, but only glucagon suppressed VPyr-Cyc/VMito. These data show that under fasting conditions, when hepatic gluconeogenesis is stimulated, pyruvate recycling is relatively low in liver compared with VMito flux and that liver metabolism, in particular pyruvate cycling, is sensitive to propionate making it an unsuitable tracer to assess hepatic glycolytic, gluconeogenic, and mitochondrial metabolism in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2314478096,"The ability of inkjet-based 3D printing (3DP) to fabricate biocompatible ceramics has made it one of the most favorable techniques to generate bone tissue engineering (BTE) scaffolds. Calcium sulfates exhibit various beneficial characteristics, and they can be used as a promising biomaterial in BTE. However, low mechanical performance caused by the brittle character of ceramic materials is the main weakness of 3DP calcium sulfate scaffolds. Moreover, the presence of certain organic matters in the starting powder and binder solution causes products to have high toxicity levels. A post-processing treatment is usually employed to improve the physical, chemical, and biological behaviors of the printed scaffolds. In this study, the effects of heat treatment on the structural, mechanical, and physical characteristics of 3DP calcium sulfate prototypes were investigated. Different microscopy and spectroscopy methods were employed to characterize the printed prototypes. The in vitro cytotoxicity of the specimens was also evaluated before and after heat treatment. Results showed that the as-printed scaffolds and specimens heat treated at 300°C exhibited severe toxicity in vitro but had almost adequate strength. By contrast, the specimens heat treated in the 500°C–1000°C temperature range, although non-toxic, had insufficient mechanical strength, which was mainly attributed to the exit of the organic binder before 500°C and the absence of sufficient densification below 1000°C. The sintering process was accelerated at temperatures higher than 1000°C, resulting in higher compressive strength and less cytotoxicity. An anhydrous form of calcium sulfate was the only crystalline phase existing in the samples heated at 500°C–1150°C. The formation of calcium oxide caused by partial decomposition of calcium sulfate was observed in the specimens heat treated at temperatures higher than 1200°C. Although considerable improvements in cell viability of heat-treated scaffolds were observed in this study, the mechanical properties were not significantly improved, requiring further investigations. However, the findings of this study give a better insight into the complex nature of the problem in the fabrication of synthetic bone grafts and scaffolds via post-fabrication treatment of 3DP calcium sulfate prototypes."
https://openalex.org/W2305957822,"Persuasion is at the core of norm creation, emergence of collective action, and solutions to 'tragedy of the commons' problems. In this paper, we show that the directionality of friendship ties affect the extent to which individuals can influence the behavior of each other. Moreover, we find that people are typically poor at perceiving the directionality of their friendship ties and that this can significantly limit their ability to engage in cooperative arrangements. This could lead to failures in establishing compatible norms, acting together, finding compromise solutions, and persuading others to act. We then suggest strategies to overcome this limitation by using two topological characteristics of the perceived friendship network. The findings of this paper have significant consequences for designing interventions that seek to harness social influence for collective action."
https://openalex.org/W2311550304,"In sub‒Saharan Africa, non‒typhoidal Salmonellae (NTS) cause invasive disease particularly in children and HIV infected adults, but the disease epidemiology is poorly understood. Between 2012 and 2013, we investigated NTS sources and transmission in Kampala. We detected Salmonella in 60% of the influent and 60% of the effluent samples from a wastewater treatment plant and 53.3% of the influent and 10% of the effluent samples from waste stabilization ponds that serve the human population; 40.9% of flush‒water samples from ruminant slaughterhouses, 6.6% of the poultry fecal samples from live bird markets and 4% of the fecal samples from swine at slaughter; and in 54.2% of the water samples from a channel that drains storm-water and effluents from the city. We obtained 775 Salmonella isolates, identified 32 serovars, and determined resistance to 15 antimicrobials. We genotyped common serovars using multiple‒locus variable number tandem repeats analysis or pulsed‒field gel electrophoresis. In addition, we analyzed 49 archived NTS isolates from asymptomatic livestock and human clinical cases. Salmonella from ruminant and swine sources were mostly pan‒susceptible (95%) while poultry isolates were generally more resistant. Salmonella Kentucky isolated from poultry exhibited extensive drug resistance characterized by resistance to 10 antimicrobials. Interestingly, similar genotypes of S. Kentucky but with less antimicrobial resistance (AMR) were found in poultry, human and environmental sources. The observed AMR patterns could be attributed to host or management factors associated with production. Alternatively, S. Kentucky may be prone to acquiring AMR. The factors driving AMR remain poorly understood and should be elucidated. Overall, shared genotypes and AMR phenotypes were found in NTS from human, livestock and environmental sources, suggesting zoonotic and environmental transmissions most likely occur. Information from this study could be used to control NTS transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2305096587,"Background The optimal therapy for infections caused by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (S. maltophilia) has not yet been established. The objective of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT), minocycline, tigecycline, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, ticarcillin-clavulanate, polymyxin E, chloramphenicol, and ceftazidime against clinical isolated S. maltophilia strains by susceptibility testing and carried out time-kill experiments in potential antimicrobials. Methods The agar dilution method was used to test susceptibility of nine candidate antimicrobials, and time-killing experiments were carried out to evaluate the efficacy of SXT, minocycline, tigecycline, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, and ceftazidime both alone and in combinations at clinically relevant antimicrobial concentrations. Results The susceptibility to SXT, minocycline, tigecycline, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, ticarcillin-clavulanate, chloramphenicol, polymyxin E, and ceftazidime were 93.8%, 95.0%, 83.8%, 80.0%, 76.3%, 76.3%, 37.5%, 22.5%, and 20.0% against 80 clinical consecutively isolated strains, respectively. Minocycline and tigecycline showed consistent active against 22 SXT-resistant strains. However, resistance rates were high in the remaining antimicrobial agents against SXT-resistant strains. In time-kill experiments, there were no synergisms in most drug combinations in time-kill experiments. SXT plus moxifloxacin displayed synergism when strains with low moxifloxacin MICs. Moxifloxacin plus Minocycline and moxifloxacin plus tigecycline displayed synergism in few strains. No antagonisms were found in these combinations. Overall, compared with single drug, the drug combinations demonstrated lower bacterial concentrations. Some combinations showed bactericidal activity. Conclusions In S. maltophilia infections, susceptibility testing suggests that minocycline and SXT may be considered first-line therapeutic choices while tigecycline, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, and ticarcillin-clavulanate may serve as second-line choices. Ceftazidime, colistin, and chloramphenicol show poor active against S. maltophilia. However, monotherapy is inadequate in infection management, especially in case of immunocompromised patients. Combination therapy, especially SXT plus moxifloxacin, may benefit than monotherapy in inhibiting or killing S. maltophilia."

Scabin shares nearly 40% sequence identity with the Pierisin family of mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase toxins. Scabin was purified to homogeneity as a 22-kDa single-domain enzyme and was shown to possess high NAD+-glycohydrolase (Km(NAD) = 68 ± 3 μm; kcat = 94 ± 2 min−1) activity with an RSQXE motif; it was also shown to target deoxyguanosine and showed sigmoidal enzyme kinetics (K0.5(deoxyguanosine) = 302 ± 12 μm; kcat = 14 min−1). Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that Scabin labels the exocyclic amino group on guanine bases in either single-stranded or double-stranded DNA. Several small molecule inhibitors were identified, and the most potent compounds were found to inhibit the enzyme activity with Ki values ranging from 3 to 24 μm.

Scabin was cloned, purified, and shown to possess both GH and ADP-ribosyltransferase activities. Five compounds were identified as good lead inhibitors against Scabin GH activity. The crystal structure of the apoenzyme has been resolved to 1.4 Å, and we have determined the structure of Scabin with two small molecule inhibitors bound to the active site. It also has sequence similarity to the Pierisin subgroup of mART toxins, as shown by multiple-sequence alignment (4Watanabe M. Kono T. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Kanazawa T. Nishisaka N. Kishimoto T.

Using this information, we identified the Scabin transferase substrate as DNA and other small nucleotides possessing guanine (7Takamura-Enya T. Watanabe M. Totsuka Y. Kanazawa T. Matsushima-Hibiya Y.

U.S.A. 2001; 98: 12414-12419Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We have characterized the Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters of Scabin for both β-NAD+ and deoxyguanosine substrates. Also, a catalytically less active variant of Scabin has been characterized. To our knowledge, this study presents the first reported inhibitors as well as the first crystal structure for a DNA-targeting enzyme within the mART toxin family. Unless otherwise noted, chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The Scabin gene with a 29-residue N-terminal truncation (signal peptide removed) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21, λDE3 cells and purified from the soluble fraction of the cell lysate. In brief, Scabin or a Q158A/E160A variant was cloned into a pET-TEV vector with an N-terminal His6 tag and tobacco etch virus protease cut site. Chemically competent E. coli BL21, λDE3 cells were transformed with plasmid and grown at 37 °C with shaking in 6 liters of 2× YT medium to an OD of 0.9 in the presence of kanamycin. Cells were subsequently induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 16 h at 16 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 12 min. Pelleted cells were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 200 mm NaCl, 50 μg/ml CHAPS, 120 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μg/ml DNase. Cell lysis was performed using an Emulsiflex-C3 high pressure homogenizer (Avestin Inc., Ottawa, Canada). Lysate was subsequently centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 50 min. Supernatant was collected and incubated with 20 mm MgCl2 at 4 °C with stirring for 30 min. Scabin and Q158A/E160A were purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography by passing the supernatant over a HiTrap chelating Sepharose fast-flow column (GE Healthcare, Mississauga, Canada) charged with Ni2+ and equilibrated with Buffer A containing 50 mm TAPS, pH 8.5, 500 mm NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole. The column containing bound protein was subjected to a wash step with Buffer A containing 25 mm imidazole, and subsequently the column was developed with a linear gradient of imidazole from 25 mm to a final concentration of 250 mm. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and those found to contain the protein of interest were pooled and dialyzed overnight into 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, and 50 mm NaCl. Further purification was performed using a HiTrap Q-Sepharose HP column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with dialysis buffer. The sample was passed over the column and washed with a linear NaCl gradient (50–500 mm) of dialysis buffer. Fractions containing pure protein were pooled and concentrated initially in a bed of PEG 20,000 at 4 °C until a volume of 5 ml was reached. The sample was then concentrated using Millipore 0.5-ml 10-kDa spin columns at 4250 rpm for 10-min intervals. The molecular weight of the recombinant Δ29 Scabin protein (herein called Scabin) was determined using an Agilent UHD 6530 Q-TOF mass spectrometer at the Mass Spectrometry Facility of the Advanced Analysis Centre, University of Guelph. The instrument was configured with the standard electrospray ionization source and operated in positive ion mode. Data analysis was performed using MassHunter Qualitative Analysis version B.06.00 (Agilent) software. Deconvolution of the m/z spectrum was achieved using the maximum entropy algorithm within the BioConfirm software (Agilent). CD spectra were acquired for both Scabin and the Q158A/E160A variant using a JASCO J-815 CD spectropolarimeter (250–190-nm scan, average of nine spectra). The protein was at 0.16 mg/ml in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, and 50 mm NaF in a 1-mm path length quartz CD cuvette. Differential scanning fluorimetry was performed on Scabin and the Q158A/E160A variant using an Applied Biosystems OneStepPlus Real-Time PCR light cycler. Samples were run in triplicate containing 14 μm protein in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, and 200 mm NaCl with the addition of 1× SYPRO® Orange stain. For Scabin, samples were incubated with and without 500 μm inhibitor for 30 min before the addition of 1× SYPRO Orange stain. Samples were subjected to a temperature gradient from 4 to 80 °C (scan rate 1.2 °C/min), and SYPRO fluorescence was monitored using the SYBR Green protocol in the StepOnePlusTM software. Crystal conditions for Scabin were screened using the PEG II suite (Qiagen) in 96-well screening trays using 1.5 mg/ml Scabin. Crystal hits were observed after 24 h in a condition containing 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5, and 15% PEG 400. The crystal condition was scaled up using 18-mm hanging drop trays with 200 μl of well solution. One microliter of 1.5 mg/ml Scabin was mixed with 1 μl of well solution on a glass coverslide to form the crystal drop. Inhibitors were co-crystallized by preincubating Scabin with a 500 μm concentration of either PJ34 or P6-E for 30 min. After incubation at room temperature for 24–48 h, large single crystals appeared. Crystals were then routinely washed with mother liquor containing 30% PEG 400 to act as a cryoprotectant and subsequently were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. In the case of co-crystals containing inhibitor, cryoprotectant also contained 500 μm inhibitor. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Canadian Light Source in the Canadian Macromolecular Crystallography Facility (beamline 08ID-1). A total of 266 frames of diffraction images were collected with a 0.75° oscillation range. Images were processed and scaled with XDS in the C2 space group (11Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11225) Google Scholar). The Scabin-apo structure was solved using molecular replacement in MOLREP (12Vagin A. Teplyakov A. MOLREP: an automated program for molecular replacement.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4148) Google Scholar). For MOLREP, the template was obtained by generating a model of Scabin-apo from a homologous Bacillus sphaericus mosquitocidal toxin structure (Protein Data Bank code 2CB4) (13Reinert D.J. Carpusca I. Aktories K. Schulz G.E. Structure of the mosquitocidal toxin from Bacillus sphaericus.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 1226-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) using MODELLER (14Sali A. Blundell T.L. Comparative protein modelling by satisfaction of spatial restraints.J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10512) Google Scholar). The model was further optimized by truncating loops. The molecular replacement solution was subjected to iterative model building and refinement using COOT (15Emsley P. Cowtan K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23224) Google Scholar) and Refmac5 in the CCP4 Suite (16Winn M.D. Ballard C.C. Cowtan K.D. Dodson E.J. Emsley P. Evans P.R. Keegan R.M.

Overview of the CCP4 suite and current developments.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2011; 67: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (9205) Google Scholar). The final model was refined to a resolution of 1.4 Å with Rwork/Rfree (%) = 16.3/19.7. The data collected were processed in XDS (11Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11225) Google Scholar). Molecular replacement on the crystal data set was conducted using Phenix (17Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B.

The Scabin-apo, Scabin PJ34, and Scabin P6-E structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank database, with codes 5DAZ, 5EWK, and 5EWY, respectively.

Open table in a new tab The binding constant, Kd, for β-NAD+ and inhibitors was determined by measuring the quenching of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian Instruments, Mississauga, Canada). An excitation wavelength of 295 nm, emission wavelength of 340 nm, and band passes of 5 nm were used. In quartz UV cuvettes (0.5 × 0.5 cm), 1.25 μm Scabin in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, and 200 mm NaCl was titrated with β-NAD+ (0–1000 μm) or inhibitor (0–1000 μm), and fluorescence intensity was monitored at 340 nm. Assays were performed in triplicate, and data were corrected to account for the increase in volume upon the addition of β-NAD+ or inhibitor. A blank titration with N-acetyl tryptophanamide was performed to correct for inner filter effects. Data were analyzed using OriginPro version 8 software (OriginLab, Northampton, MA) to determine the binding constants. Glycohydrolase assays were performed on a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer using an excitation wavelength of 305 nm, emission wavelength of 405 nm, and band passes of 5 nm. Various concentrations of ϵ-NAD+ (0–450 μm) and 490 nm Scabin were added to NAD+ GH buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, and 50 mm NaCl. Triplicate reactions were monitored for 10-min intervals, and the initial slope of each reaction was recorded. An ϵ-AMP standard curve was derived to convert fluorescent units/min to [etheno-ADP-ribose] formed/min. A Michaelis-Menten curve was derived by fitting the data to the hyperbolic model in OriginPro version 8 software. ADP-ribosyltransferase assays with deoxyguanosine (dG) were performed as described under “GH Activity” with a few changes. ϵ-NAD+ was held at a concentration of 250 μm and was mixed with 10 nm Scabin in GH buffer containing 1% dimethyl sulfoxide and various concentrations of dG (0–1250 μm). The data were fit to the sigmoidal dose response model in OriginPro version 8. Activity toward other small nucleotides was also tested using the method described above, with the exception of holding the small nucleotide substrate at a constant concentration of 1 mm. Substrates tested include GDP, cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), and deoxyinosine (dI). Scabin activity toward genomic DNA was also tested using the method described above. The genomic DNA was extracted from various samples, as described previously (18Healey A. Furtado A. Cooper T. Henry R.J. Protocol: a simple method for extracting next-generation sequencing quality genomic DNA from recalcitrant plant species.Plant Methods. 2014; 10: 21Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and was partially fragmented with 1 unit of DNase I/μg of DNA (375 ng/μl, final concentration) in Tris-EDTA buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2 for 10 min at room temperature. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses were performed in the Mass Spectrometry Facility within the Advanced Analysis Centre at the University of Guelph. Reactions containing 1 mm nucleotide (GDP or cGMP) or 100 μm DNA (single-stranded pentamer of dG or double-stranded DNA with forward sequence 5′-ATTAAGTATT-3′ and reverse sequence 5′-TAATTCATAA-3′), 250 μm NAD+, and 50 nm Scabin in GH buffer were run overnight at room temperature with gentle shaking. Samples were diluted 1:100 in water before injection into a Dionex UHPLC UltiMate 3000 liquid chromatograph interfaced to an amaZon SL ion trap mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA). A Luna C18 column (5-μm particle size, 150 × 2 mm; Phenomenex) was used for chromatographic separation. The initial mobile phase conditions were 100% water (0.1% formic acid) isocratic for 5 min followed by a gradient to 60% acetonitrile (0.1% formic acid) in 20 min and then a single-step gradient to 100% acetonitrile in 10 min. The flow rate was maintained at 0.4 ml/min. The mass spectrometer electrospray capillary voltage was maintained at 4.5 kV, and the drying gas temperature was 280 °C with a flow rate of 10 liters/min. Nebulizer pressure was 40 p.s.i. Nitrogen was used as both nebulizing and drying gas, and helium was used as collision gas at 60 p.s.i. The mass spectrometer was set on enhanced resolution positive ion auto-MS/MS mode and scanned across 50–1500 m/z. The smart parameter setting was used to automatically optimize the trap drive level for selected precursor ions. The instrument was externally calibrated with the ESI TuneMix (Agilent). Testing of potential inhibitors against Scabin GH activity was performed using compounds designed to act competitively with β-NAD+. P6 series inhibitors were obtained from Sinova Inc. (Bethesda, MD). Initial testing was performed on a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer using the same settings as described under “GH Activity.” Initial testing was performed in a reaction vessel containing 50 nm Scabin, 250 μm ϵ-NAD+, 100 μm inhibitor, and GH buffer. Because some of the inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO, a control (2% DMSO) was performed to take into account the effect of DMSO on enzyme activity. Triplicate reactions were monitored for 10-min intervals, and the initial slope of each reaction was normalized to take into account the effect of DMSO. Inhibition assays were used to determine the IC50 values for selected inhibitors, and the experiments were performed on a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 305 nm, emission wavelength of 405 nm, and band passes of 5 nm. Scabin (50 nm) was mixed with 250 μm ϵ-NAD+, various concentrations of inhibitors, and GH buffer. Triplicate reactions were monitored for 10-min intervals, and the initial slope of each reaction was normalized to a 2% DMSO control. An etheno-AMP standard curve was used to convert fluorescence units/min to [ϵ-ADP-ribose] formed/min. The data were fit using the dose-response function in OriginPro version 8 to determine the corresponding IC50 value. Experimental IC50 values were used to calculate Ki values using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (19Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Relationship between the inhibition constant (K1) and the concentration of inhibitor which causes 50 per cent inhibition (I50) of an enzymatic reaction.Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12265) Google Scholar), Ki = IC50/(1 + [S]/Km), where [S] is the concentration of ϵ-NAD+ and Km is for the β-NAD+ substrate. The Ki was determined experimentally for PJ34 from a Lineweaver-Burk plot of the inhibition data. This was developed by incubating 50 nm Scabin in GH buffer and varying the concentration of ϵ-NAD+ (12.5, 25, 50, and 100 μm) but holding the concentration of PJ34 at either 0, 6, 12, or 24 μm. Data were collected on a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer as described above. Protein preparation, molecular mechanics calculations, and protein rendering were performed using the computational suite MOE (Molecular Operative Environment) release 2014.08 (Chemical Computing Group Inc., Montreal, Canada). The force field employed was Amber12:EHT, with the AMBER12 parameter set (ff12) for protein and parameters calculated from the extended Huckel theory for P6E, PJ34, NAD+, and dsDNA molecules. The MOE Protonate3D module was used to assign the ionization states and tautomers of protein side chains at T = 300 K, pH 7.4, and 0.1 m ionic strength, along with the GB-VI solvation model and MMFF94 partial charges. The molecular surfaces are solvent-excluded surfaces obtained by rolling a probe sphere of 1.4-Å diameter (water radius) and colored by several schemes. The van der Waals interaction surfaces correspond to zero-potential contours of the van der Waals potential, Evdw = 0, between the considered set of atoms and a water oxygen atom as mobile probe, using a standard 12-6 Lennard-Jones definition. The Scabin·PJ34 complex (Protein Data Bank code 5EWK) was stripped from crystallographic waters, co-solvents, and ions, and the nicotinamide moiety of NAD+ was superposed to the fused amide of the PJ34 ring system. Then the PJ34 molecule was deleted, and the remaining Scabin·NAD+ structure was energy-minimized by fixing the coordinates of the nicotinamide moiety and Scabin atoms while allowing relaxation of the remaining NAD+ molecule into the binding cavity. This was followed by relaxing the side chains of the pocket residues with fixed NAD+ coordinates. This complex was named Scabinm·NAD+. To model the ternary Scabin·NAD+-DNA complex, a 10-mer dsDNA oligomer with the 5′-CAGTGCAGTG-3′ sequence in the B-helix conformation was constructed with a guanine base at the 5th position in both DNA strands. This dsDNA10 molecule was manually positioned around the Scabinm·NAD+ complex by a rigid body translation/rotation in order to locate the 5G bases near the bound NAD+ while avoiding direct clashes between their van der Waals surfaces. A distance-constrained energy term was set with limits of 10–12 Å between both reaction centers (the NAD+ C1′ atom of N-ribose and the exo-cyclic nitrogen atom of one of the 5-position guanines), and then a rigid-body optimization was conducted (root mean square gradient ≤0.01 kcal/mol/Å2). Next, a LowModeMD conformational search was performed (20Labute P. LowModeMD: implicit low-mode velocity filtering applied to conformational search of macrocycles and protein loops.J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2010; 50: 792-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) to optimize active site loop residues that contact the NAD+ and dsDNA molecules; this involved two steps: (i) 1000 iterations with fixed NAD+ and then (ii) 10,000 iterations with only the nicotinamide moiety fixed. In both cases, the coordinates of dsDNA and non-loop residues were constrained and set to inert protein atoms"
https://openalex.org/W2305043588,"Membrane proteins are assembled through balanced interactions among proteins, lipids and water. Studying their folding while maintaining the native lipid environment is necessary but challenging. Here we present methods for analyzing key elements of membrane protein folding including thermodynamic stability, compactness of the unfolded state and folding cooperativity under native conditions. The methods are based on steric trapping, which couples the unfolding of a doubly biotinylated protein to the binding of monovalent streptavidin (mSA). We further advanced this technology for general application by developing versatile biotin probes possessing spectroscopic reporters that are sensitized by mSA binding or protein unfolding. By applying these methods to the Escherichia coli intramembrane protease GlpG, we elucidated a widely unraveled unfolded state, subglobal unfolding of the region encompassing the active site, and a network of cooperative and localized interactions to maintain stability. These findings provide crucial insights into the folding energy landscape of membrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2307895039,"Objective This study investigated post-traumatic stress symptoms in relation to the population affected by the Fukushima Nuclear Disaster, one year after the disaster. Additionally, we investigated social factors, such as forced displacement, which we hypothesize contributed to the high prevalence of post-traumatic stress. Finally, we report of written narratives that were collected from the impacted population. Design and Settings Using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), questionnaires were sent to 2,011 households of those displaced from Fukushima prefecture living temporarily in Saitama prefecture. Of the 490 replies; 350 met the criteria for inclusion in the study. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to examine several characteristics and variables of social factors as predictors of probable post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD. Results The mean score of IES-R was 36.15±21.55, with 59.4% having scores of 30 or higher, thus indicating a probable PTSD. No significant differences in percentages of high-risk subjects were found among sex, age, evacuation area, housing damages, tsunami affected, family split-up, and acquaintance support. By the result of multiple logistic regression analysis, the significant predictors of probable PTSD were chronic physical diseases (OR = 1.97), chronic mental diseases (OR = 6.25), worries about livelihood (OR = 2.27), lost jobs (OR = 1.71), lost social ties (OR = 2.27), and concerns about compensation (OR = 3.74). Conclusion Although there are limitations in assuming a diagnosis of PTSD based on self-report IES-R, our findings indicate that there was a high-risk of PTSD strongly related to the nuclear disaster and its consequent evacuation and displacement. Therefore, recovery efforts must focus not only on medical and psychological treatment alone, but also on social and economic issues related to the displacement, as well."

Two phylogenetically distinct EF-P modification pathways have been described and are encoded in the majority of Gram-negative bacteria, but neither is present in Gram-positive bacteria. Prior work suggested that the EF-P-encoding gene (efp) primarily supports Bacillus subtilis swarming differentiation, whereas EF-P in Gram-negative bacteria has a more global housekeeping role, prompting our investigation to determine whether EF-P is modified and how it impacts gene expression in motile cells. We identified a 5-aminopentanol moiety attached to Lys32 of B. subtilis EF-P that is required for swarming motility. A fluorescent in vivo B. subtilis reporter system identified peptide motifs whose efficient synthesis was most dependent on 5-aminopentanol EF-P. Examination of the B. subtilis genome sequence showed that these EF-P-dependent peptide motifs were represented in flagellar genes.

https://openalex.org/W2334436911,"Glioblastomas are the most common primary brain tumors, highly vascularized, infiltrating, and resistant to current therapies. This cancer leads to a fatal outcome in less than 18 months. The aggressive behavior of glioblastomas, including resistance to current treatments and tumor recurrence, has been attributed to glioma stemlike/progenitor cells. The transcription factor EGR1 (early growth response 1), a member of a zinc finger transcription factor family, has been described as tumor suppressor in gliomas when ectopically overexpressed. Although EGR1 expression in human glioblastomas has been associated with patient survival, its precise location in tumor territories as well as its contribution to glioblastoma progression remain elusive. In the present study, we show that EGR1-expressing cells are more frequent in high grade gliomas where the nuclear expression of EGR1 is restricted to proliferating/progenitor cells. We show in primary cultures of glioma stemlike cells that EGR1 contributes to stemness marker expression and proliferation by orchestrating a PDGFA-dependent growth-stimulatory loop. In addition, we demonstrate that EGR1 acts as a positive regulator of several important genes, including SHH, GLI1, GLI2, and PDGFA, previously linked to the maintenance and proliferation of glioma stemlike cells.

In the present study, we show that EGR1-expressing cells are more frequent in high grade gliomas where the nuclear expression of EGR1 is restricted to proliferating/progenitor cells. We show in primary cultures of glioma stemlike cells that EGR1 contributes to stemness marker expression and proliferation by orchestrating a PDGFA-dependent growth-stimulatory loop. In addition, we demonstrate that EGR1 acts as a positive regulator of several important genes, including SHH, GLI1, GLI2, and PDGFA, previously linked to the maintenance and proliferation of glioma stemlike cells."
https://openalex.org/W2316166187,"The first exon of the Huntingtin protein (Httex1) is one of the most actively studied Htt fragments because its overexpression in R6/2 transgenic mice has been shown to recapitulate several key features of Huntington disease. However, the majority of biophysical studies of Httex1 are based on assessing the structure and aggregation of fusion constructs where Httex1 is fused to large proteins, such as glutathione S-transferase, maltose-binding protein, or thioredoxin, or released in solution upon in situ cleavage of these proteins. Herein, we report an intein-based strategy that allows, for the first time, the rapid and efficient production of native tag-free Httex1 with polyQ repeats ranging from 7Q to 49Q. Aggregation studies on these proteins enabled us to identify interesting polyQ-length-dependent effects on Httex1 oligomer and fibril formation that were previously not observed using Httex1 fusion proteins or Httex1 proteins produced by in situ cleavage of fusion proteins. Our studies revealed the inability of Httex1–7Q/15Q to undergo amyloid fibril formation and an inverse correlation between fibril length and polyQ repeat length, suggesting possible polyQ length-dependent differences in the structural properties of the Httex1 aggregates. Altogether, our findings underscore the importance of working with tag-free Httex1 proteins and indicate that model systems based on non-native Httex1 sequences may not accurately reproduce the effect of polyQ repeat length and solution conditions on Httex1 aggregation kinetics and structural properties.

The CAG repeat length ranges between 6 and 35 in healthy subjects, whereas patients with HD exhibit lengths of 36 or greater resulting in the synthesis of a mutant Huntingtin protein (Htt) with an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) domain (2Rubinsztein D.C.

Subsequent studies demonstrated that aberrant splicing in HttQ150 knock-in mice gave rise to a short mRNA, which translates into the Huntingtin Exon 1 protein (Httex1), thus linking the genetic cause of HD to the generation of a highly toxic N-terminal Htt fragment (15Sathasivam K.

Together, these findings highlight the importance of this region in HD pathogenesis and underscore the critical importance of investigating the structure, aggregation, and functional properties of Httex1 and its role in health and disease. The amino acid sequence of Httex1 is dominated by the polyQ tract that is flanked by the N-terminal domain consisting of the first 17 amino acids (Nt17 domain) and the proline-rich domain (16Tartari M. Gissi C. Lo Sardo V. Zuccato C. Picardi E. Pesole G. Cattaneo E. Phylogenetic comparison of huntingtin homologues reveals the appearance of a primitive polyQ in sea urchin.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2008; 25: 330-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). With the exception of the Nt17 domain, the remainder of the protein is rich in glutamine and proline residues. The homotypic and uncharged nature of Httex1 renders the protein unstable and prone to aggregation, especially when containing an expanded polyQ domain of >36Q. These properties present significant challenges for producing Httex1 by standard recombinant bacterial and mammalian expression systems. Consequently, the majority of in vitro studies investigating the structure and aggregation properties of Httex1 have been conducted using synthetic polyQ or Httex1-like peptides containing additional solubilizing amino acids such as lysine residues (17Chen S.

Typically, the fusion protein is cleaved in situ by the addition of a protease to release and initiate the aggregation of Httex1. Enzyme-mediated cleavage of Httex1 fusion proteins often results in the incorporation of additional amino acids at the N or C terminus of the protein. This could alter the biophysical and biochemical properties of Httex1 because of the important role of the Nt17 domain and proline-rich domain in regulating the conformational and aggregation properties of the protein (18Bhattacharyya A.

The net effect of incomplete and/or unspecific enzymatic cleavage of Httex1 fusion proteins is the generation of heterogeneous protein mixtures that precludes accurate interpretation and comparison of aggregation and structural data across different laboratories. Therefore, the use of fusion constructs as precursors for the generation of Httex1 requires enzymes that are highly specific and efficient to ensure complete cleavage and to minimize changes to the protein sequence due to the nature of the enzyme used, engineered cleavage site, or the presence of undesired cleavage products.TABLE 1A list of the most common Httex1 fusion constructs and proteases used for in vitro aggregation studiesa Trypsin cleavage sites were reported by Scherzinger et al.

However, both approaches demand special technical expertise and equipment that are not commonly accessible in many research groups. Herein, we present the first recombinant approach that allows the efficient production and purification of authentic tag-free Httex1 in milligram quantities from Escherichia coli. This intein-based strategy eliminates the need for proteolytic enzymes and has been successfully used to produce Httex1 proteins with polyQ repeats ranging from 7Q to at least 49Q. Biophysical characterization of these proteins revealed that they exhibit the expected aggregation properties of tag-free Httex1 proteins produced by chemical or semisynthetic strategies (50Ansaloni A.

The use of tag-free Httex1 proteins enabled us to decipher subtle effects of concentration and polyQ-repeat length on Httex1 oligomerization and fibril formation, which were not observed previously using Httex1 fusion constructs or Httex1-based peptide model systems containing non-native sequences. This includes an inverse correlation between polyQ repeat length and fibril length. Finally, unlike previous reports using polyQ peptides, we did not observe amyloid fibril formation by Httex1 proteins with polyQ repeats of 7 or 15Q, even at high protein concentrations. These findings underscore the importance of using tag-free native Httex1 proteins to investigate the sequence and molecular determinants of Httex1 aggregation and to elucidate the structural basis of Httex1 toxicity. pTWIN1 vector (N6951S) and ER2566 E. coli (E6901S) competent cells were purchased from New England BioLabs.

Recently, we demonstrated that regulation of the Gtl2-Dio3 noncoding RNA locus is dependent on the MEF2 transcription factor in cardiac muscle, and that two of its encoded miRNAs, miR-410 and miR-495, induce robust cardiomyocyte proliferation. Given the possibility of manipulating the expression of these miRNAs to repair the damaged heart by stimulating cardiomyocyte proliferation, it is important to determine whether the Gtl2-Dio3 noncoding RNAs are regulated in cardiac disease and whether they function downstream of pathological cardiac stress signaling. Therefore, we examined expression of the above miRNAs processed from the Gtl2-Dio3 locus in various cardiomyopathies. These noncoding RNAs were upregulated in all cardiac disease models examined including myocardial infarction (MI) and chronic angiotensin II (Ang II) stimulation, and in the cardiomyopathies associated with muscular dystrophies. Consistent with these observations, we show that the Gtl2-Dio3 proximal promoter is activated by stress stimuli in cardiomyocytes and requires MEF2 for its induction. Furthermore, inhibiting miR-410 or miR-495 in stressed cardiomyocytes attenuated the hypertrophic response. Thus, the Gtl2-Dio3 noncoding RNA locus is a novel marker of cardiac disease and modulating the activity of its encoded miRNAs may mitigate pathological cardiac remodeling in these diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2311024054,"Lactobacillus reuteri is a symbiont that inhabits the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of mammals, and several strains are used as probiotics. After introduction of probiotic strains in a complex ecosystem like the GI tract, keeping track of them is a challenge. The main objectives of this study were to introduce reporter proteins that would enable in vivo and in vitro detection of L. reuteri and increase knowledge about its interactions with the host. We describe for the first time cloning of codon-optimized reporter genes encoding click beetle red luciferase (CBRluc) and red fluorescent protein mCherry in L. reuteri strains ATCC PTA 6475 and R2LC. The plasmid persistence of mCherry-expressing lactobacilli was evaluated by both flow cytometry (FCM) and conventional plate count (PC), and the plasmid loss rates measured by FCM were lower overall than those determined by PC. Neutralization of pH and longer induction duration significantly improved the mCherry signal. The persistency, dose-dependent signal intensity and localization of the recombinant bacteria in the GI tract of mice were studied with an in vivo imaging system (IVIS), which allowed us to detect fluorescence from 6475-CBRluc-mCherry given at a dose of 1×1010 CFU and luminescence signals at doses ranging from 1×105 to 1×1010 CFU. Both 6475-CBRluc-mCherry and R2LC-CBRluc were localized in the colon 1 and 2 h after ingestion, but the majority of the latter were still found in the stomach, possibly reflecting niche specificity for R2LC. Finally, an in vitro experiment showed that mCherry-producing R2LC adhered efficiently to the intra cellular junctions of cultured IPEC-J2 cells. In conclusion, the two reporter genes CBRluc and mCherry were shown to be suitable markers for biophotonic imaging (BPI) of L. reuteri and may provide useful tools for future studies of in vivo and in vitro interactions between the bacteria and the host."

We hypothesize that α2M*/CS-GRP78-evoked key signaling events are required for transcriptional activation of c-MYC target genes. Activation of CS-GRP78 by α2M* requires ligation of the GRP78 primary amino acid sequence (Leu98–Leu115). After stimulation with α2M*, CS-GRP78 signaling activates 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) to induce phosphorylation of PLK1, which in turn induces c-MYC transcription. We demonstrate that PLK1 binds directly to c-MYC and promotes its transcriptional activity by phosphorylating Ser62. Moreover, activated c-MYC is recruited to the E-boxes of target genes FOSL1 and ID2 by phosphorylating histone H3 at Ser10. In addition, targeting the carboxyl-terminal domain of CS-GRP78 with a mAb suppresses transcriptional activation of c-MYC target genes and impairs cell proliferation.

https://openalex.org/W2305032038,"Metformin is the most commonly prescribed oral anti-diabetic agent worldwide. Surprisingly, about 35% of diabetic patients either lack or have a delayed response to metformin treatment, and many patients become less responsive to metformin over time. It remains unknown how metformin resistance or insensitivity occurs. Recently, we found that therapeutic metformin concentrations suppressed glucose production in primary hepatocytes through AMPK; activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway negatively regulates AMPK activity by phosphorylating AMPKα subunit at Ser-485, which in turn reduces AMPK activity. In this study, we find that metformin failed to suppress glucose production in primary hepatocytes with constitutively activated PKA and did not improve hyperglycemia in mice with hyperglucagonemia. Expression of the AMPKα1(S485A) mutant, which is unable to be phosphorylated by PKA, increased both AMPKα activation and the suppression of glucose production in primary hepatocytes treated with metformin. Intriguingly, salicylate/aspirin prevents the phosphorylation of AMPKα at Ser-485, blocks cAMP-PKA negative regulation of AMPK, and improves metformin resistance.

Diabetes is the fastest-growing chronic disease worldwide, and type 2 diabetes (T2D) 2The abbreviations used are: T2Dtype 2 diabetesAMPKAMP-activated kinasePKAprotein kinase ABt-cAMPdibutyryl-cAMP. accounts for more than 90% of diabetes cases. Metformin has been used to treat T2D since the 1950s and works primarily by controlling fasting hyperglycemia (1.Witters L.A. The blooming of the French lilac.J. Clin.

Now, over 150 million people worldwide take this medication; guidelines for the treatment of T2D published by the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes in 2012 jointly recommended metformin as the initial drug for T2D treatment (2.Inzucchi S.E.

Several genes have been reported to be associated with glycemic control by metformin. In particular, variants of the organic cation transporter and the metformin transporter, have been linked to a reduction in metformin action (7.Shu Y. Sheardown S.A. Brown C. Owen R.P. Zhang S.

Because of the high occurrence of metformin resistance in diabetic patients, genetic variants in known genes alone cannot explain this phenomenon; therefore, nongenetic factors may also contribute to the response to metformin. Recently, we found that treatment with metformin prior to the addition of cAMP led to greater suppression of glucose production and AMPK activation when compared with simultaneous treatment with metformin and cAMP (10.Cao J.

In both diabetic animal models and human subjects, serum glucagon levels and the ratios of glucagon to insulin are often elevated (11.Burcelin R. Katz E.B. Charron M.J.

Role of liver in pathophysiology of NIDDM.Diabetes Care. 1992; 15: 430-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Elevated glucagon levels in type 2 diabetic patients are variable, with a ∼5-fold difference in serum glucagon levels among patients with T2D (16.Unger R.H. Aguilar-Parada E. Müller W.A. Eisentraut A.M. Studies of pancreatic alpha cell function in normal and diabetic subjects.J. Clin. Invest. 1970; 49: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Low metformin concentrations, typically found in the portal vein after a therapeutic dosage, suppress glucose production in primary hepatocytes through AMPK (10.Cao J. Meng S. Chang E.

Therefore, the hyperglucagonemia of diabetes can antagonize metformin efficacy by activating the cAMP-PKA pathway and cause metformin resistance. We and other investigators have found that the cAMP-PKA pathway negatively regulates AMPK activity through phosphorylation of the AMPKα subunit at Ser-485, which in turn reduces net phosphorylation at Thr-172 (10.Cao J.

It is conceivable that the blockade of AMPKα phosphorylation at Ser-485 will augment AMPK activity and metformin efficacy. One potential drug that might improve metformin's effect is salicylate, which is known to activate AMPK by binding to the AMPKβ subunit (20.Hawley S.A. Fullerton M.D. Ross F.A. Schertzer J.D.

In the current study, we tested whether hyperglucagonemia of diabetes mellitus causes metformin resistance and whether blocking the phosphorylation of AMPKα at Ser-485 by salicylate can alleviate metformin resistance in a diabetic animal models with constitutively activated PKA and with hyperglucagonemia. To generate adenoviral expression vectors, mouse α1, β1, and γ1 genes were cloned into a pENTR2B vector (Invitrogen). AMPKα1S485A was created using site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene).

In assays with 3 h salicylate pretreatment, salicylate was added to FBS-free DMEM during serum starvation and to the glucose production medium. After 3∼4 h incubation with glucose production medium, both medium and cells were collected. The medium was used to determine glucose concentrations with the EnzyChrom Glucose Assay Kit (21.He L.

Briefly, immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged AMPKα1 proteins were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min in the presence of [32P]ATP (1 μCi), AMP (200 μm), and either with or without SAMS peptide (200 μm). Aliquots of the reaction mixture were spotted on Whatman p81 phosphocellulose filter papers, which were dropped immediately in 1% phosphoric acid for 20 min with rotation. This wash was repeated twice, followed by a 5-min wash in acetone. Filters were air-dried, and radioactivity was counted in 3 ml of liquid scintillation fluid. The counts without the SAMS peptide were used as the background. All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Johns Hopkins University. C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the Jackson laboratory.

On the second day after the implantation, mice with glucagon infusion were divided into 4 groups and treated with vehicle, metformin (50 mg/kg/day), salicylate (28.6 mg/kg/day), or metformin plus salicylate through drinking water. After 3 weeks of drug treatment, mice were subjected to a 4 h fast before performance of a pyruvate tolerance test (2 g/kg) to assess glucose production. Immunoblots were conducted as previously described (26.Wondisford A.R. Xiong L. Chang E. Meng S. Meyers D.J. Li M. Cole P.A. He L. Control of Foxo1 gene expression by co-activator P300.J. Biol.

Cellular lysates were passed 15 times through a syringe needle or were sonicated for 15 s three times sequentially. The lysates were immunoblotted to examine the target proteins with antibodies against AMPKα1, pAMPKα (Thr-172, Ser-485), CREB, pCREB (Ser-133), ACC, pACC (Ser-79) (Cell Signaling), Pck1, and AMPKα1, β1, γ1 (abcam) at the concentrations recommended by the manufacturers; secondary antibodies were used at concentrations around 1:5000. Statistical significance was calculated with a Student's t test and ANOVA test. Significance was accepted at the level of p < 0.05. Previously, we found that pretreatment of primary hepatocytes with metformin led to greater suppression of glucose production (10.Cao J. Meng S. Chang E. Beckwith-Fickas K. Xiong L. Cole R.N.

As shown in Fig. 1a, pretreatment of primary hepatocytes with metformin 3 h before the addition of the cAMP analog dibutyryl-cAMP (Bt-cAMP) (Pre-T) led to greater AMPK phosphorylation at Thr-172 and greater inhibition of Pck1 protein levels than simultaneous treatment with metformin and Bt-cAMP (Same-T). Since phosphorylation of AMPKα subunit at Ser-485 by PKA reduces both AMPK phosphorylation at Thr-172 and AMPK activity (10.Cao J. Meng S. Chang E. Beckwith-Fickas K. Xiong L. Cole R.N. Radovick S.

To test further that the cAMP-PKA pathway exerts a negative effect on AMPK activation, we used the PKA inhibitor-H89 to block the cAMP-PKA pathway in Hepa1–6 cells, a mouse hepatocyte cell line. Treatment with H89 decreased CREB phosphorylation at Ser-133, indicating blockade of the cAMP-PKA pathway; and we found that H89 reduced AMPKα subunit phosphorylation at Ser-485 and increased AMPKα subunit phosphorylation at Thr-172, which occurred in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1b). We previously observed that Bt-cAMP treatment reduced metformin-mediated AMPKα subunit phosphorylation at Thr-172 (10.Cao J. Meng S. Chang E. Beckwith-Fickas K. Xiong L. Cole R.N. Radovick S. Wondisford F.E. He L. Low concentrations of metformin suppress glucose production in hepatocytes through AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 20435-20446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether the PKA inhibitor-H89 could reverse the negative effect of Bt-cAMP on Thr-172 phosphorylation of AMPKα subunit. Treatment with H89 prior to the addition of Bt-cAMP indeed eliminated the negative effect of Bt-cAMP on metformin-mediated AMPKα subunit phosphorylation at Thr-172 in Hepa1–6 cells (Fig. 1c). To prove further that the cAMP-PKA pathway negatively regulates AMPK activation, we treated Hepa1–6 cells with a PKA competitive inhibitor Rp-cAMP. We found that administration of Rp-cAMP 1 h before the addition of 0.2 mm Bt-cAMP increased AMPKα subunit phosphorylation at Thr-172 (Fig. 1d). The above data demonstrate that the cAMP-PKA pathway negatively regulates activation of AMPK. Given that low metformin concentrations typically found in the portal vein suppress hepatic glucose production through the activation of AMPK (10.Cao J. Meng S. Chang E. Beckwith-Fickas K. Xiong L. Cole R.N. Radovick S. Wondisford F.E. He L. Low concentrations of metformin suppress glucose production in hepatocytes through AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 20435-20446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and that the cAMP-PKA pathway negatively modulates AMPK activity (Fig. 1), we tested whether activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway would decrease metformin efficacy in the suppression of hepatic glucose production. As the loss of PKA regulatory subunit 1a (PKAR1a) leads to the constitutive activation of PKA (24.Kirschner L.S. Kusewitt D.F. Matyakhina L. Towns 2nd, W.H. Carney J.A. Westphal H. Stratakis C.A. A mouse model for the Carney complex tumor syndrome develops neoplasia in cyclic AMP-responsive tissues.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4506-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), we employed Ad-CMV-Cre to floxed PKAR1a mice through jugular vein injection and generated liver-specific PKAR1a knock-out mice (Fig. 2a, bottom panel), and then tested metformin efficacy in vivo. In agreement with a previous report (29.Song W.J. Seshadri M. Ashraf U. Mdluli T. Mondal P. Keil M. Azevedo M. Kirschner L.S. Stratakis C.A. Hussain M.A. Snapin mediates incretin action and augments glucose-dependent insulin secretion.Cell Metab. 2011; 13: 308-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), PKAR1a knock-out led to a significant elevation in fasting blood glucose levels (Fig. 2a). Next, we conducted a metformin tolerance test on floxed PKAR1a mice and PKAR1a knock-out mice. In these experiments, metformin significantly decreased blood glucose levels in floxed PKAR1a mice (Fig. 2b); however, metformin administration did not significantly affect blood glucose levels in the PKAR1a knock-out mice (Fig. 2c). These data clearly demonstrate that activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway antagonizes metformin efficacy. We further assessed the effect of PKA activation on metformin's suppression of glucose production in primary hepatocytes. In primary hepatocytes isolated from floxed PKAR1a mice, Ad-CMV-Cre adenovirus-mediated depletion of PKAR1a (Fig. 2d, bottom panel) resulted in a significant increase in glucose production without Bt-cAMP stimulation (Fig. 2d, upper panel). Metformin significantly suppressed glucose production in the basal and after Bt-cAMP treatment in primary hepatocytes transduced with control Ad-CMV-GFP adenovirus (Fig. 2d). In contrast, metformin's effect on the suppression of glucose production was abolished in primary hepatocytes with the loss of PKAR1a and was associated with elevated phosphorylation of AMPKα at Ser-485 (Fig. 2d). Since inhibitor H89 or Rp-cAMP increased AMPKα subunit phosphorylation at Thr-172 along with a reduction in AMPKα subunit phosphorylation at Ser-485 (Fig. 1, b–d), and PKA-mediated phosphorylation of AMPKα at Ser-485 negatively affects AMPK activity (10.Cao J.

As shown in Fig. 2e (bottom panel), PKAR1a protein was completely depleted, and AMPKα1 subunit phosphorylation at Thr-172 was only observed in primary hepatocytes with AMPKα1S485A overexpression, not in primary hepatocytes with AMPKα1WT overexpression. These results suggest that PKA-mediated phosphorylation of AMPKα at Ser-485 reduces phosphorylation of AMPKα at Thr-172.

To identify the underlying mechanism of translation control, we employed biochemical approaches to determine the regulatory features by which upstream ORFs (uORFs) direct downstream translation control and expression of the EPRS coding region.

When exposed to aphid-induced A. thaliana volatiles, the mortality of aphids pre-treated with a conidial suspension of L. lecanii, the conidial germination and the appressorial formation were significantly increased compared with the control. The decan-3-ol and 4-methylpentyl isothiocyanate that were detected in the headspace seemed to have positive and negative affection, respectively. Moreover, HIPVs generated from groups of eight aphids per plant promoted significantly increased conidial germination and appressorial formation compared with HIPVs from groups of one, two and four aphids per plant.

Our understanding of cellulose deconstruction is largely limited to the study of microbes in isolation, but in nature, this process is driven by microbes within complex communities. In Neotropical forests, microbes in leaf-cutter ant refuse dumps are important for carbon turnover. These dumps consist of decaying plant material and a diverse bacterial community, as shown here by electron microscopy. To study the portion of the community capable of cellulose degradation, we performed enrichments on cellulose using material from five Atta colombica refuse dumps. The ability of enriched communities to degrade cellulose varied significantly across refuse dumps. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of enriched samples identified that the community structure correlated with refuse dump and with degradation ability. Overall, samples were dominated by Bacteroidetes, Gammaproteobacteria, and Betaproteobacteria. Half of abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) across samples were classified within genera containing known cellulose degraders, including Acidovorax, the most abundant OTU detected across samples, which was positively correlated with cellulolytic ability. A representative Acidovorax strain was isolated, but did not grow on cellulose alone. Phenotypic and compositional analyses of enrichment cultures, such as those presented here, help link community composition with cellulolytic ability and provide insight into the complexity of community-based cellulose degradation."

Disruption of endothelial barrier function by bacterial endotoxins, cytokines or growth factors results in inflammation and vascular damage leading to vascular diseases. We have identified 5-methoxytryptophan (5-MTP) as an anti-inflammatory factor by metabolomic analysis of conditioned medium of human fibroblasts. Here we postulated that endothelial cells release 5-MTP to protect the barrier function. Conditioned medium of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) prevented endothelial hyperpermeability and VE-cadherin downregulation induced by VEGF, LPS and cytokines. We analyzed the metabolomic profile of HUVEC conditioned medium and detected 5-MTP but not melatonin, serotonin or their catabolites, which was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Addition of synthetic pure 5-MTP preserved VE-cadherin and maintained barrier function despite challenge with pro-inflammatory mediators. Tryptophan hydroxylase-1, an enzyme required for 5-MTP biosynthesis, was downregulated in HUVECs by pro-inflammatory mediators and it was accompanied by reduction of 5-MTP. 5-MTP protected VE-cadherin and prevented endothelial hyperpermeability by blocking p38 MAPK activation. A chemical inhibitor of p38 MAPK, SB202190, exhibited a similar protective effect as 5-MTP. To determine whether 5-MTP prevents vascular hyperpermeability in vivo, we evaluated the effect of 5-MTP administration on LPS-induced murine microvascular permeability with Evans blue. 5-MTP significantly prevented Evans blue dye leakage. Our findings indicate that 5-MTP is a new class of endothelium-derived molecules which protects endothelial barrier function by blocking p38 MAPK."
https://openalex.org/W2303601473,"Historically, Guatemalans have suffered high rates of poverty and malnutrition while nearly ten percent of their population resides abroad. Many Guatemalan parents use economic migration, mainly international migration to the United States, as a means to improve the human capital prospects of their children. However, as this investigation shows, the timing of migration events in relation to left-behind children’s ages has important, often negative and likely permanent, repercussions on the physical development of their children. To illustrate these dynamics, this investigation uses an instrumental variables framework to disentangle the countervailing effects of Guatemalan fathers’ absences due to migration from concomitant remittances on left-behind children’s growth outcomes. Based on national-level data collected in 2000, the investigation reveals that the international migration of a father in the previous year is correlated with a 22.1% lower length/height-for-age z-score for the average left-behind child aged ≤ 3. In contrast, the receipt of remittance income has no influence on the physical stature of a child, which may indicate that migrant fathers with young children are not able to achieve economic success soon enough during their ventures abroad to fully ameliorate the harmful effects caused by their absences."

Under conditions of extreme oxygen depletion (hypoxia), human cells repress eIF4E and switch to an alternative cap-dependent translation mediated by a homolog of eIF4E, eIF4E2. This homolog forms a complex with the oxygen-regulated hypoxia-inducible factor 2α and can escape translation repression. This complex mediates cap-dependent translation under cell culture conditions of 1% oxygen (to mimic tumor microenvironments), whereas eIF4E mediates cap-dependent translation at 21% oxygen (ambient air). However, emerging evidence suggests that culturing cells in ambient air, or “normoxia,” is far from physiological or “normal.” In fact, oxygen in human tissues ranges from 1–11% or “physioxia.” Here we show that two distinct modes of cap-dependent translation initiation are active during physioxia and act on separate pools of mRNAs.

https://openalex.org/W2304212006,"The WalKR two-component system, controlling cell wall metabolism, is highly conserved among Bacilli and essential for cell viability. In Staphylococcus aureus, walR and walK are followed by three genes of unknown function: walH, walI and walJ. Sequence analysis and transcript mapping revealed a unique genetic structure for this locus in S. aureus: the last gene of the locus, walJ, is transcribed independently, whereas transcription of the tetra-cistronic walRKHI operon occurred from two independent promoters located upstream from walR. Protein topology analysis and protein-protein interactions in E. coli as well as subcellular localization in S. aureus allowed us to show that WalH and WalI are membrane-bound proteins, which associate with WalK to form a complex at the cell division septum. While these interactions suggest that WalH and WalI play a role in activity of the WalKR regulatory pathway, deletion of walH and/or walI did not have a major effect on genes whose expression is strongly dependent on WalKR or on associated phenotypes. No effect of WalH or WalI was seen on tightly controlled WalKR regulon genes such as sle1 or saouhsc_00773, which encodes a CHAP-domain amidase. Of the genes encoding the two major S. aureus autolysins, AtlA and Sle1, only transcription of atlA was increased in the ΔwalH or ΔwalI mutants. Likewise, bacterial autolysis was not increased in the absence of WalH and/or WalI and biofilm formation was lowered rather than increased. Our results suggest that contrary to their major role as WalK inhibitors in B. subtilis, the WalH and WalI proteins have evolved a different function in S. aureus, where they are more accessory. A phylogenomic analysis shows a striking conservation of the 5 gene wal cluster along the evolutionary history of Bacilli, supporting the key importance of this signal transduction system, and indicating that the walH and walI genes were lost in the ancestor of Streptococcaceae, leading to their atypical 3 wal gene cluster, walRKJ."

Methods We prospectively enrolled 214 patients clinically diagnosed with IC, 125 non-IC patients who underwent video urodynamic studies and PST, and another 144 non-IC patients who underwent cystoscopic hydrodistention before transurethral surgery. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated for the PST and glomerulations after cystoscopic hydrodistention. Results After cystoscopic hydrodistention, glomerulations developed in 211/214 (98.6%) IC patients and 61/144 (42.4%) of the non-IC patients including patients with stones (45/67, 67%), hematuria (2/5, 40%), and stress urinary incontinence (SUI) (6/17, 35%). When positive glomerulation was defined as grade 2 or more, the sensitivity was 61.7%. The PST was positive in 183/214 (85.5%) IC patients and 7/17 (41%) with hypersensitive bladder, 7/32 (22%) with detrusor overactivity, 5/27 (18%) with SUI, 2/21 (10%) with lower urinary tract symptoms, and 2/25 (8%) with bladder outlet obstruction. The PST had a sensitivity of 85.5% and a specificity of 81.6% for diagnosis of IC. IC patients with a positive PST had a significantly smaller urgency sensation capacity, smaller voided volume, and greater bladder pain score. Conclusions Both the PST and glomerulations after hydrodistention are sensitive indicators of IC, but the specificity of glomerulations in the diagnosis of IC is lower than that of the PST. A positive PST is associated with a more hypersensitive bladder and bladder pain, but not the grade of glomerulations in IC patients. Neither test provided 100% diagnostic accuracy for IC, we might select patients into different subgroups based on different PST and hydrodistention results, not for making a diagnosis of IC but for guidance of different treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2309674670,"Background Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) caused by liver lipid dysregulation is linked to obesity. Somatostatin (SST) and its analogs have been used to treat pediatric hypothalamic obesity. However, the application of such drugs for the treatment of NAFLD has not been evaluated. Objective This study aimed to investigate the expression levels of important regulators of hepatic lipid metabolism and the possible effect of the SST analog octreotide on these regulators. Methods SD rats were assigned to a control group and a high-fat diet group. Obese rats from the high-fat diet group were further divided into the obese and octreotide-treated groups. The body weight, plasma SST, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), insulin, triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and free fatty acid (FFA) levels were measured. Hepatic steatosis was evaluated based on the liver TG content, HE staining and oil red O staining. The SREBP-1c, ACC1, FAS, MTP, apoB and ADRP expression levels in the liver were also determined by RT-PCR, qRT-PCR, western blot or ELISA. Results The obese rats induced by high-fat diet expressed more SREBP-1c, FAS and ADRP but less MTP protein in the liver than those of control rats, whereas octreotide intervention reversed these changes and increased the level of apoB protein. Compared to the control group, obese rats showed increased liver ACC1, SREBP-1c and apoB mRNA levels, whereas octreotide-treated rats showed decreased mRNA levels of apoB and SREBP-1c. This was accompanied by increased body weight, liver TG contents, FPG, TG, TC, LDL-C, FFA, insulin and derived homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) values. Octreotide intervention significantly decreased these parameters. Compared to the control group, the obese group showed a decreasing trend on plasma SST levels, which were significantly increased by the octreotide intervention. Conclusion Octreotide can ameliorate hepatic steatosis in obese rats, possibly by decreasing hepatic lipogenesis and increasing TG export from hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2311599414,"Neurobeachin (NBEA) is an autism spectrum disorders (ASD) candidate gene. NBEA deficiency affects regulated secretion, receptor trafficking, synaptic architecture and protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation. NBEA is a large multidomain scaffolding protein. From N- to C-terminus, NBEA has a concanavalin A-like lectin domain flanked by armadillo repeats (ACA), an A-kinase anchoring protein domain that can bind to PKA, a domain of unknown function (DUF1088) and a BEACH domain, preceded by a pleckstrin homology-like domain and followed by WD40 repeats (PBW). Although most of these domains mediate protein-protein interactions, no interaction screen has yet been performed.Yeast two-hybrid screens with the ACA and PBW domain modules of NBEA gave a list of interaction partners, which were analyzed for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment. Neuro-2a cells were used for confocal microscopy and nuclear extraction analysis. NOTCH-mediated transcription was studied with luciferase reporter assays and qRT-PCR, combined with NBEA knockdown or overexpression.Both domain modules showed a GO enrichment for the nucleus. PBW almost exclusively interacted with transcription regulators, while ACA interacted with a number of PKA substrates. NBEA was partially localized in the nucleus of Neuro-2a cells, albeit much less than in the cytoplasm. A nuclear localization signal was found in the DUF1088 domain, which was shown to contribute to the nuclear localization of an EGFP-DPBW fusion protein. Yeast two-hybrid identified the Notch1 intracellular domain as a physical interactor of the PBW domain and a role for NBEA as a negative regulator in Notch-mediated transcription was demonstrated.Defining novel interaction partners of conserved NBEA domain modules identified a role for NBEA as transcriptional regulator in the nucleus. The physical interaction of NBEA with NOTCH1 is most relevant for ASD pathogenesis because NOTCH signaling is essential for neural development."
https://openalex.org/W2309690802,"Mobile technology is increasingly used to measure visual acuity. Standards for chart-based acuity tests specify photometric requirements for luminance, optotype contrast and luminance uniformity. Manufacturers provide some photometric data but little is known about tablet performance for visual acuity testing. This study photometrically characterised seven tablet computers (iPad, Apple inc.) and three ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) visual acuity charts with room lights on and off, and compared findings with visual acuity measurement standards. Tablet screen luminance and contrast were measured using nine points across a black and white checkerboard test screen at five arbitrary brightness levels. ETDRS optotypes and adjacent white background luminance and contrast were measured. All seven tablets (room lights off) exceeded the most stringent requirement for mean luminance (≥ 120 cd/m2) providing the nominal brightness setting was above 50%. All exceeded contrast requirement (Weber ≥ 90%) regardless of brightness setting, and five were marginally below the required luminance uniformity threshold (Lmin/Lmax ≥ 80%). Re-assessing three tablets with room lights on made little difference to mean luminance or contrast, and improved luminance uniformity to exceed the threshold. The three EDTRS charts (room lights off) had adequate mean luminance (≥ 120 cd/m2) and Weber contrast (≥ 90%), but all three charts failed to meet the luminance uniformity standard (Lmin/Lmax ≥ 80%). Two charts were operating beyond manufacturer’s recommended lamp replacement schedule. With room lights on, chart mean luminance and Weber contrast increased, but two charts still had inadequate luminance uniformity. Tablet computers showed less inter-device variability, higher contrast, and better luminance uniformity than charts in both lights-on and lights-off environments, providing brightness setting was >50%. Overall, iPad tablets matched or marginally out-performed ETDRS charts in terms of photometric compliance with high contrast acuity standards."
https://openalex.org/W2320050264,"Large cats feeding habits have been studied through two main methods: scat analysis and the carcasses of prey killed by monitored animals. From November 2001 to April 2004, we studied jaguar predation patterns using GPS telemetry location clusters on a cattle ranch in southern Pantanal. During this period, we recorded 431 carcasses of animals preyed upon by monitored jaguars. Concurrently, we collected 125 jaguar scats opportunistically. We compared the frequencies of prey found through each method. We also compared the prey communities using Bray-Curtis similarity coefficient. These comparisons allowed us to evaluate the use of scat analysis as a means to describe jaguar feeding habits. Both approaches identified prey communities with high similarity (Bray-Curtis coefficient > 70). According to either method, jaguars consume three main prey: cattle (Bos taurus), caiman (Caiman yacare) and peccaries (Tayassu pecari and Pecari tajacu). The two methods did not differ in the frequency of the three main prey over dry and wet seasons or years sampled. Our results show that scat analysis is effective and capable of describing jaguar feeding habits."
https://openalex.org/W2317656918,"Although most proteins fold by populating intermediates, the transient nature of such states makes it difficult to characterize their structures. In this work we identified and characterized the structure of an intermediate of the X domain of phosphoprotein (P) of measles virus. We obtained this result by a combination of equilibrium and kinetic measurements and NMR chemical shifts used as structural restraints in replica-averaged metadynamics simulations. The structure of the intermediate was then validated by rationally designing four mutational variants predicted to affect the stability of this state. These results provide a detailed view of an intermediate state and illustrate the opportunities offered by a synergistic use of experimental and computational methods to describe non-native states at atomic resolution."

This study examined the influence of exogenous ApoA-II on lipid uptake and cell growth in pancreatic cancer (PC) both in vitro and in vivo.Cryo transmission electron microscopy (TEM) examined ApoA-II's influence on morphology of SMOFLipid emulsion. The influence of ApoA-II on proliferation of cancer cell lines was determined by incubating them with lipid+/-ApoA-II and anti-SR-B1 antibody. Lipid was labeled with the fluorophore, DiD, to trace lipid uptake by cancer cells in vitro by confocal microscopy and in vivo in PDAC patient derived xenograft tumours (PDXT) by fluorescence imaging. Scavenger receptor class B type-1(SR-B1) expression in PDAC cell lines and in PDAC PDXT was measured by western blotting and immunohistochemistry, respectively.ApoA-II spontaneously converted lipid emulsion into very small unilamellar rHDL like vesicles (rHDL/A-II) and enhanced lipid uptake in PANC-1, CFPAC-1 and primary tumour cells as shown by confocal microscopy. SR-B1 expression was 13.2, 10.6, 3.1 and 2.3 fold higher in PANC-1, MIAPaCa-2, CFPAC-1 and BxPC3 cell lines than the normal pancreatic cell line (HPDE6) and 3.7 fold greater in PDAC tissue than in normal pancreas. ApoA-II plus lipid significantly increased the uptake of labeled lipid and promoted cell growth in PANC-1, MIAPaCa-2, CFPAC-1 and BxPC3 cells which was inhibited by anti SR-B1 antibody. Further, ApoA-II increased the uptake of lipid in xenografts by 3.4 fold.Our data suggest that ApoA-II enhance targeting potential of lipid in pancreatic cancer which may have imaging and drug delivery potentialities."
https://openalex.org/W2310539022,"Previous studies comparing phase sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR) to double inversion recovery (DIR) have demonstrated that use of PSIR improves cross-sectional in vivo detection of cortical lesions (CL) in multiple sclerosis. We studied the utility of PSIR in detection/characterization of accrual of CL over time in a 1-year longitudinal study in primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) compared to DIR. PSIR and DIR images were acquired with 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 25 patients with PPMS and 19 healthy controls at baseline, and after 1 year in 20 patients with PPMS. CL were classified as intracortical, leucocortical or juxtacortical. Lesion counts and volumes were calculated for both time points from both sequences and compared. Correlations with measures of physical and cognitive disability were determined as well as new CL counts and volumes. Compared to DIR, PSIR led to detection of a higher number of CL involving a larger proportion of patients with PPMS both cross-sectionally (p = 0.006, 88%) and longitudinally (p = 0.007, 95%), and led to the reclassification of a third of CL seen on DIR at each time point. Interestingly, PSIR was more sensitive to new CL accumulation over time compared to DIR. PSIR is a promising technique to monitor cortical damage and disease progression in patients with PPMS over a short-term follow-up."

https://openalex.org/W2299163516,"Background Several studies have shown associations between blood lipid levels and the risk of atrial fibrillation (AF). To test the potential effect of blood lipids with AF risk, we assessed whether previously developed lipid gene scores, used as instrumental variables, are associated with the incidence of AF in 7 large cohorts. Methods We analyzed 64,901 individuals of European ancestry without previous AF at baseline and with lipid gene scores. Lipid-specific gene scores, based on loci significantly associated with lipid levels, were calculated. Additionally, non-pleiotropic gene scores for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) were calculated using SNPs that were only associated with the specific lipid fraction. Cox models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of AF per 1-standard deviation (SD) increase of each lipid gene score. Results During a mean follow-up of 12.0 years, 5434 (8.4%) incident AF cases were identified. After meta-analysis, the HDLc, LDLc, total cholesterol, and triglyceride gene scores were not associated with incidence of AF. Multivariable-adjusted HR (95% CI) were 1.01 (0.98–1.03); 0.98 (0.96–1.01); 0.98 (0.95–1.02); 0.99 (0.97–1.02), respectively. Similarly, non-pleiotropic HDLc and LDLc gene scores showed no association with incident AF: HR (95% CI) = 1.00 (0.97–1.03); 1.01 (0.99–1.04). Conclusions In this large cohort study of individuals of European ancestry, gene scores for lipid fractions were not associated with incident AF."

https://openalex.org/W2309698340,"Infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) is an important, systemic viral disease of farmed Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L. Endothelial cells are the main target cells for highly virulent HPR-deleted ISA virus (ISAV) types. Here we examine the pathogenesis of non-virulent ISAV HPR0 infections, presenting evidence of an epithelial tropism for this virus type, including actual infection and replication in the epithelial cells. Whereas all HPR0 RT-qPCR positive gills prepared for cryosection tested positive by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescent labelling, only 21% of HPR0 RT-qPCR positive formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded gills were IHC positive, suggesting different methodological sensitivities. Only specific epithelial cell staining was observed and no staining was observed in endothelial cells of positive gills. Furthermore, using an ISAV segment 7 RT-PCR assay, we demonstrated splicing of HPR0, suggesting initial activation of the replication machinery in the epithelial gill cells. Immunological responses were investigated by the expression of interferon-related genes (e.g. Mx and γIP) and by ELISA for presence of anti-ISAV antibodies on samples taken sequentially over several months during an episode of transient HPR0 infection. All fish revealed a variable, but increased expression of the immunological markers in comparison to normal healthy fish. Taken together, we conclude that HPR0 causes a localized epithelial infection of Atlantic salmon."

Mothers already receiving cART before pregnancy were ineligible. In both groups, events of PTB (<37 weeks) and LBW (<2,500g) were analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression; with p<0.05 considered statistically significant.Of the 760 infants, 481 were born from cART-exposed mothers against 279 from maternal-ZDV. Median maternal CD4 count was 378 [interquartile range (IQR): 253-535] cells/mm3. Median duration of ART at onset of delivery was 13 [IQR: 10-17] weeks. In the cART-group, 64.9% (312/481) of mothers were exposed to Zidovudine/Lamuvidine/Nevirapine and only 2% (9/481) were on protease inhibitor-based regimens. Events of PTB were not significantly higher in the cART-group compared to the ZDV-group (10.2% vs. 6.4% respectively, p = 0.08), while onsets of LBW were significantly found in the cART-group compared to ZDV-group (11.6% vs. 7.2% respectively, p = 0.05). Other factors (parity, maternal age at delivery or CD4 cell count) were not associated with PTB.cART, initiated during pregnancy, would be an independent factor of LBW. In the era of option B+ (lifelong ART to all HIV-pregnant women), further studies would guide towards measures limiting onsets of LBW."
https://openalex.org/W2318181715,"Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) promotes hepatic insulin clearance. Consistently, mice with null mutation of Ceacam1 (Cc1(-/-)) exhibit impaired insulin clearance with increased lipid production in liver and redistribution to white adipose tissue, leading to visceral obesity at 2 months of age. When the mutation is propagated on the C57/BL6J genetic background, total fat mass rises significantly with age, and glucose intolerance and systemic insulin resistance develop at 6 months of age. This study was carried out to determine the mechanisms underlying the marked increase in total fat mass in 6-month-old mutants. Indirect calorimetry analysis showed that Cc1(-/-) mice develop hyperphagia and a significant reduction in physical activity, in particular in the early hours of the dark cycle, during which energy expenditure is only slightly lower than in wild-type mice. They also exhibit increased triglyceride accumulation in skeletal muscle, due in part to incomplete fatty acid β-oxidation. Mechanistically, hypothalamic leptin signaling is reduced, as demonstrated by blunted STAT3 phosphorylation in coronal sections in response to an intracerebral ventricular injection of leptin. Hypothalamic fatty-acid synthase activity is also elevated in the mutants. Together, the data show that the increase in total fat mass in Cc1(-/-) mice is mainly attributed to hyperphagia and reduced spontaneous physical activity. Although the contribution of the loss of CEACAM1 from anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin neurons in the arcuate nucleus is unclear, leptin resistance and elevated hypothalamic fatty-acid synthase activity could underlie altered energy balance in these mice."
https://openalex.org/W2311557010,A majority of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is caused by contraction of macrosatellite repeats called D4Z4 that are located in the subtelomeric region of human chromosome 4q35. Sequencing the FSHD locus has been technically challenging due to its long size and nearly identical nature of repeat elements. Here we report sequencing and partial assembly of a BAC clone carrying an entire FSHD locus by a single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing technology which could produce long reads up to about 18 kb containing D4Z4 repeats. De novo assembly by Hierarchical Genome Assembly Process 1 (HGAP.1) yielded a contig of 41 kb containing all but a part of the most distal D4Z4 element. The validity of the sequence model was confirmed by an independent approach employing anchored multiple sequence alignment by Kalign using reads containing unique flanking sequences. Our data will provide a basis for further optimization of sequencing and assembly conditions of D4Z4.

Methods This prospective study was conducted to assess average concordance rates between (1) a medication list obtained with a one-page structured medication history algorithm developed for the obstetrical setting and (2) the medication list reported in medical records and obtained by open-ended questions based on standard procedures. Both lists were converted into concordance rate using a best possible medication history approach as the reference (information obtained by patients, prescribers and community pharmacists’ interviews). Results The algorithm-based method obtained a higher average concordance rate than the standard method, with respectively 90.2% [CI95% 85.8–94.3] versus 24.6% [CI95%15.3–34.4] concordance rates (p<0.01). Conclusion Our algorithm-based method strongly enhanced the accuracy of the medication history in our obstetric population, without using substantial resources. Its implementation is an effective first step to the medication reconciliation process, which has been recognized as a very important component of patients’ drug safety."
