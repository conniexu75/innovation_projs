https://openalex.org/W1491471718,"The interaction of macrophages with red blood cells (RBC) displaying phosphatidylserine (PS) in their surface membranes was investigated after the transfer of an exogenously supplied fluorescent lipid analog to the RBC. Nonfluorescent (quenched) lipid vesicles were formed by ultrasonication from 1-acyl-2-[(N-4-nitro-benzo-2-oxa-1,3 diazole)aminocaproyl]phosphatidyl-serine (NBD-PS) or 1-acyl-2[(N-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3 diazole)aminocaproyl]phosphatidylcholine (NBD-PC). The interaction of these vesicles with RBC was monitored as a function of vesicle concentration by assessment of the degree to which cell-associated lipid fluorescence was dequenched after vesicle treatment. When vesicle concentrations of less than 100 ng/ml were used, lipid fluorescence was largely dequenched, indicating that lipid transfer was the predominant mechanism of both NBD-PS and NBD-PC uptake; however, when vesicle concentrations were increased to greater than 100 ng/ml, a concentration-dependent increase in the fraction of quenched cell-associated lipid was observed, indicating that another mechanism, possibly vesicle-cell adhesion, also occurred. Using NBD-PS at concentrations at which dilution of all the phospholipid analog in the recipient cell membrane could be unequivocally confirmed, we observed that the uptake of NBD-PS-treated RBC by macrophages was increased 5-fold over that of controls, whereas the uptake of RBC containing an equivalent amount of exogenously supplied NBD-PC was unaltered. Furthermore, preincubation of macrophage monolayers with vesicles containing PS resulted in a approximately 60% inhibition in the uptake of NBD-PS-treated RBC, whereas no inhibition in the uptake of control, opsonized, or NBD-PC-treated RBC was observed. These findings suggest that PS in the outer leaflet of RBC might serve as a signal for triggering their recognition by macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W1502642972,"Secretion of platelet granule constituents is closely associated with the phosphorylation of a cytosol polypeptide of Mr = 47,000 that we have called P47 (Haslam, R. J., Lynham, J. A., and Fox, J. E. B. (1979) Biochem. J. 178, 397-406). This polypeptide is a substrate of Ca2+-activated phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (Kawahara, Y., Takai, Y., Minakuchi, R., Sano, K., and Nishizuka, Y. (1980) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 97, 309-317). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of protein from human platelets that had been preincubated with 32Pi demonstrated the presence under control conditions of 2-3 major forms of P47 that contained very little 32P (pI values, 6.6-6.8) and, after induction of secretion with thrombin, their replacement by 7-9 highly labeled phosphorylated forms of P47 (pI values, 6.1-6.5). Native phosphorylated P47 was purified from thrombin-stimulated 32P-labeled platelets by ammonium sulfate fractionation and column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, phenyl-Sepharose, and hydroxylapatite. The final 32P-labeled product was obtained in a yield of 20-25% and was purified about 400-fold relative to platelet lysate. This material was homogeneous on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis but, like the starting material, contained 7-9 separable phosphorylated components with different pI values. Purified phosphorylated P47 had a sedimentation coefficient (s20,w) of 3.57 S and a Stokes radius of 3.33 nm from which an Mr = 49,000 and a frictional ratio (f/f0) of 1.4 were calculated. These findings and failure to detect multimers after treatment of the protein with dimethyl suberimidate indicate that P47 normally exists as a monomer. The 32P-labeled phosphate present in purified P47 had the chemical stability of serine or threonine phosphoesters and analysis indicated the presence of 83% phosphoserine and 17% phosphothreonine. Limited proteolysis of purified 32P-labeled P47 by Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease generated a major unlabeled fragment (Mr = 23,500) and up to six labeled fragments (Mr = 24,700-14,800), the relative amounts of the latter depending on the extent of proteolysis. The same labeled fragments were obtained after proteolysis of each of the major phosphorylated components of P47, suggesting that these represent different phosphorylation states of variants of the same protein and that most or all of the phosphorylation sites are on a single 14,800-Da segment of the protein. The availability of pure native phosphorylated P47 should facilitate investigation of the physiological role of this protein in platelets."
https://openalex.org/W1520146978,"Flagellar motors of some alkalophilic Bacillus strains have been suggested to be powered by the electrochemical potential gradient of Na+, namely the (formula: see text) (Hirota, N., Kitada, M., and Imae, Y. (1981) FEBS Lett. 132, 278-280). In the present study, we quantitatively measured the (formula: see text) and motility of one of the strains, YN-1. Swimming speed of YN-1 cells increased linearly with a logarithmic increase of Na+ concentration in the medium up to 100 mM. The intracellular Na+ concentration and the membrane potential of the cell were about 30 mM and -170 mV, respectively, and stayed constant irrespective of Na+ concentration in the medium. Thus, the swimming speed changed as a function of the chemical potential difference of Na+ across the cell membrane. When the membrane potential of YN-1 cells was decreased by a combination of valinomycin and various concentrations of K+ in the medium, the swimming speed of the cells decreased linearly and reached zero at around -90 mV. Under the condition, the intracellular Na+ concentration stayed constant. Thus, the membrane potential was also a determinant of the swimming speed. Furthermore, the chemical potential of Na+ and the membrane potential were found to be equivalent as the energy source for motility. Therefore, it is concluded that the (formula: see text) is the energy source for the flagellar motors of YN-1 cells. Threshold value of the (formula: see text) for motility was about -100 mV."

https://openalex.org/W1597088668,"The capacity of the liver microsomal mixed function oxidase system to metabolize a great variety of exogenous as well as endogenous compounds is thought to reflect the participation of multiple forms of the terminal oxidase, cytochrome P-450, which have different broad, but overlapping, substrate specificities. Several of these isozymes accumulate in the liver after exposure of animals to specific inducing agents. In order to approach the questions of the genetic basis for the existence of multiple cytochrome P-450 isozymes and the molecular mechanisms of the induction process, we have used a cloned cDNA for a major phenobarbital-induced form of cytochrome P-450 to identify and characterize thirteen distinct rat genomic clones containing segments of six different genes. Only three clones, representing overlapping segments of a single gene, hybridized to the cloned cDNA or to phenobarbital-induced mRNA under conditions of high stringency. In vitro transcription studies with isolated rat liver nuclei indicated that only this gene, but not the genes represented by the other genomic clones, appears to be markedly activated by phenobarbital treatment of rats. Although there are a small number of differences, DNA sequence analysis of the eight exons of the gene present in these genomic clones indicates that they encode residues 58 to 491 (the COOH terminus) of cytochrome P-450e, a major phenobarbital-induced isozyme. It appears that the other cloned genes may contain only a small region of very strong homology to the cytochrome P-450e gene, a region which includes the exon encoding a tridecapeptide which is also present in two dissimilar forms of rabbit liver cytochrome P-450, one constitutive and one induced by phenobarbital. Southern blotting analysis of rat liver DNA indicates that the rat genome may contain two additional genes which are very closely related to the cytochrome P-450e gene but which we have not yet isolated from the genomic library. One of these genes is likely to encode cytochrome P-450b, the major phenobarbital induced form of cytochrome P-450 whose mRNA is greater than 95% homologous to that encoding cytochrome P-450e."
https://openalex.org/W1601281597,"A detailed investigation concerned with localizing hexokinase in the Novikoff ascites tumor is presented. At least 50% of the total hexokinase activity was shown by differential and density gradient centrifugation techniques to be associated with tumor mitochondria. None of this activity was latent. Fractionation of isolated tumor mitochondria with digitonin revealed an outer membrane location for this enzyme. Treatment of tumor mitochondria with glucose 6-phosphate released about 80 to 85% of the hexokinase activity without disrupting the intermembrane compartment. This suggests that at least this proportion of the activity is bound to the outer surface of the outer membrane. Successive treatments did not remove the remaining hexokinase activity. At 30 degrees C, an incubation time of about 10 min with glucose 6-phosphate was required to achieve maximal release. No solubilization occurred at 0-4 degrees C. The isozymes derived from Novikoff mitochondria were identified by anion exchange chromatography as types I and III. Glucokinase activity was not detectable. Evidence is also presented which indicates that the hexokinase obtained from Novikoff mitochondria binds to the outer membrane of rat liver mitochondria. In contrast, the low endogenous hexokinase activity present in isolated liver mitochondria was found not to fractionate with outer membrane markers, but rather with contaminating microsomal membrane markers. Results described here provide the first direct evidence for the submitochondrial location of hexokinase in a tumor. They reveal an outer membrane location and an involvement of two hexokinase isozymes. Because these findings are characteristic of the hepatoma and not observed in control liver preparations, it is suggested that they may be very relevant to the general property of rapidly growing tumors to catabolize large amounts of glucose."
https://openalex.org/W1539741116,"This paper describes the construction of a DNA molecule containing a topologically stable structure that simulates a replication fork. This preformed DNA molecule is a circular duplex of 7.2 X 10(3) base pairs (M13mp6 DNA) from which arises, at a unique BamHI recognition site, a noncomplementary 5'-phosphoryl-terminated single strand of 237 nucleotides (SV40 DNA). This structure has two experimental attributes. 1) Templates for both leading and lagging strand synthesis exist as stable structures prior to any DNA synthesis. 2) DNA synthesis creates a cleavage site for the restriction endonuclease BamHI. Form I of T7 DNA polymerase, alone, catalyzes limited DNA synthesis at the preformed replication fork whereas Form II, alone, polymerizes less than 5 nucleotides. However, when T7 gene 4 protein is present, Form II of T7 DNA polymerase catalyzes rapid and extensive synthesis via a rolling circle mode. Kinetic analysis of this synthesis reveals that the fork moves at a rate of 300 bases/s at 30 degrees C. We conclude that the T7 gene 4 protein requires a single-stranded DNA binding site from which point it translocates to the replication fork where it functions as a helicase. The phage T4 DNA polymerase catalyzes DNA synthesis at this preformed replication fork in the presence of gene 4 protein, but the amount of DNA synthesized is less that 3% of the amount synthesized by the combination of Form II of T7 DNA polymerase and gene 4 protein. We conclude that T7 DNA polymerase and T7 gene 4 protein interact specifically during DNA synthesis at a replication fork."

https://openalex.org/W1574319129,"A new protocol for the purification of phytochrome from etiolated Avena sativa L. seedlings in 15-25% yield is described. This preparation exhibits molecular properties dissimilar to those previously reported from oats. Phytochrome prepared by this method contains a dominant species having a Mr = 124,000 (70% of total) on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, in addition to a chromoprotein species with Mr = 118,000 (30%). A blocked NH2 terminus is indicated by amino acid sequencing of the purified chromoprotein preparation. By ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, this preparation displays a 730-nm absorption maximum for Pfr, an enhanced APfr730/APfr668 ratio under saturating red light illumination, and a reduced amount of dark reversion. Circular dichroism reveals a new absorption band for Pfr in the blue spectral region. These spectral properties and electrophoretic behavior are consistent with available information on phytochrome in vivo or in rapidly prepared extracts from oat seedlings. Thus, the molecular properties described here may more accurately reflect those of phytochrome in vivo in etiolated A. sativa shoots than those of phytochrome species isolated by previous methodologies."
https://openalex.org/W1523399000,"Recent articles have confused the steady state concentration of radioactivity in N-methylphosphatidylethanolamine (PME) and N,N-dimethylphosphatidylethanolamine (PDE) with the amount of these products formed during the conversion of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to phosphatidylcholine (PC). This paper clarifies this problem and reports the apparent Km values for AdoMet and pH optima for the conversion of PE to PME, PDE, and PC by rat liver microsomes. We purified AdoMet and [methyl-3H]AdoMet and measured the transfer of tritium to PME, PDE, and PC as a function of time. There was an initial lag in the formation of [3H]PC followed by linear incorporation of isotope. In contrast, labeled PME and PDE reached and maintained steady state levels within 1 to 2 min. Hence, calculations of the rate of formation of PME, PDE, and PC must take into account the subsequent conversion of PME and PDE to PC. The PE N-methyltransferase was assayed at pH 6.6, 9.2, and 10.25 and the apparent Km for AdoMet for the three methylation reactions was calculated. The formation of PME was best estimated by the dpm in PME + 1/2 dpm in PDE + 1/3 dpm in PC. The synthesis of PDE from PME was estimated from 1/2 dpm in PDE and 1/3 dpm in PC, and the formation of PC from PDE estimated by 1/3 dpm in PC. The apparent Km for AdoMet at pH 10.25 for the conversion of PE to PME was 58 microM, PME to PDE was 65 microM, and PDE to PC was 96 microM. The pH optimum for each of these methylation reactions was 10.25. This high value was not due to alkaline degradation of AdoMet or denaturation of the enzyme. The apparent Km for AdoMet was also estimated for the conversion of exogenous PME to PDE (50 microM) and exogenous PDE to PC (45 microM). Since recent studies on the methylation of PE have not taken into account the conversion of newly formed PME and PDE to PC, the results and conclusions about apparent Km values for AdoMet, pH optima, and the number of enzymes involved must be re-evaluated."
https://openalex.org/W1593063454,"The intracellular content and turnover of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) were measured in cultured human lymphoid cells. AdoMet levels were found to be 59 nmol/ml cell volume in exponentially growing WI-L2 lymphoblasts, 3.3-8.1 nmol/ml cell volume in unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and 25-33 nmol/ml cell volume 24-48 h after the latter were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin. Increases in the AdoMet content of stimulated cells occurred within 2 h after addition of lectin. First order, pool turnover rates were of the same order of magnitude (0.029-0.091/min) for all three types of cultured cells, but owing to the differences in AdoMet content, absolute utilization rates differed markedly and were 4.5, 0.12-0.40, and 1.41-1.57 nmol/min/ml cell volume in WI-L2, unstimulated peripheral mononuclear cells, and lectin-stimulated peripheral mononuclear cells, respectively. Measurements of homocysteine accumulation in growth medium and of transsulfuration to cysteine indicate that a minimum of 82% of the AdoMet synthesized by WI-L2 is used for transmethylation. Remethylation of homocysteine by these cells could not be detected. AdoMet synthesis accounts for 20-23% of methionine utilization by WI-L2. Judging from the accumulation of homocysteine in the medium of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral mononuclear cells, a minimum of 38% of AdoMet synthesized must be used for transmethylation. Even though AdoMet utilization by unstimulated peripheral mononuclear cells is relatively small compared to that of stimulated cells and WI-L2, our data indicate that AdoMet turnover in such resting cells is three to five times that estimated for nonhepatic tissues. These findings may be relevant to the hypothesis that lymphoid cells are unusually sensitive to inhibition of transmethylation reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1587342184,"Addition of several arginine-specific serine proteases to culture medium conditioned by fibroblasts results in the proteases being taken into sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable complexes with a secreted factor termed protease nexin (PN) (Baker, J. B., Low, D. A., Simmer, R. L., and Cunningham, D. D. (1980) Cell 21, 37-45). PN not only inhibits these degradative enzymes but also mediates their binding, internalization, and degradation by the cells (Low, D. A., Baker, J. B., Koonce, W. C., and Cunningham, D. D. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 78, 2340-2344). Here we describe a simple procedure for purifying milligram quantities of PN from serum-free medium conditioned by human foreskin cells. Accumulation of PN in the medium is increased by using high density microcarrier cultures supplemented with epidermal growth factor and bovine serum albumin. Application of ultrafiltration-concentrated medium to a heparin-Sepharose column followed by extensive washing of the column with buffer containing 0.2 M NaCl and elution with buffer containing 1.0 M NaCl results in the recovery of 60-90% of the input PN in a form that is 90-97% pure. This preparation can be further purified by hydrophobic chromatography on octyl-agarose. Purified PN has a molecular mass of approximately 51 kilodaltons. On nonequilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis it migrates as five bands with isoelectric points between 7.5 and 7.8. Purified PN exhibits all the properties attributed to PN in culture medium. These include: 1) formation of sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable complexes with thrombin, urokinase, and plasmin; 2) inhibition of protease activity; 3) heparin-enhanced inhibition of thrombin; and 4) cellular binding of protease-PN complexes in a heparin-sensitive reaction. When thrombin-PN complexes are dissociated with 1 M hydroxylamine a smaller form of PN (approximately 46 kilodaltons) is detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, indicating that the complexed PN is proteolytically modified."

https://openalex.org/W1588371601,"Fibrin monomer Sepharose was used to investigate the interactions of thrombin with fibrin. Thrombin binding was found to be reversible and saturable and to depend on the thrombin: fibrin ratio. Scatchard analysis indicated a single class of binding sites with K alpha = 4.9 X 10(5) M-1. Ca2+ ions caused rapid desorption and elution of thrombin from fibrin monomer, and the Ca2+ concentration needed for maximal desorption depended on the fibrin:thrombin ratio. Mg2+, Mn2+, and Sr2+ also released thrombin from fibrin monomer but not as efficiently as Ca2+. These results indicate that divalent metal ions induce a physical change in fibrin monomer which results in desorption of thrombin. Thrombin binding to fibrin in a gel was compared to binding to fibrin monomer. These studies showed that as fibrin monomers polymerize to form the gel network, thrombin is released. Under static conditions the released thrombin remains associated with the gel because diffusion is limited by the gel. However, the thrombin can be readily removed when buffer is allowed to flow through the gel. These results lead to the possibility that thrombin binding to fibrin monomer and its subsequent release, either by Ca2+ or by polymerization, may have important consequences for regulating the effective thrombin concentration in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1615908364,"Catalase promotes the H2O2-dependent oxidation of phenylhydrazine to benzene but simultaneously is subject to a pseudo-first order inactivation process. Each inactivation event is subtended by catalytic turnover of three molecules of phenylhydrazine and 52 molecules of H2O2. The dimethyl ester of N-phenylprotoporphyrin IX is extracted with acidic methanol from the inactivated enzyme, but the prosthetic heme with a phenyl sigma-bonded to the iron atom is obtained by gentle extraction with 2-butanone. The absolute chirality of N-ethylprotoporphyrin IX isolated from catalase inactivated with ethylhydrazine confirms that the prosthetic heme has the same chiral orientation in the active site as it does in hemoglobin. The known inactivation of methemoglobin by phenylhydrazine is shown to depend on H2O2 but not oxygen. The results demonstrate that the H2O2-dependent oxidation of phenylhydrazine by catalase and other hemoproteins results in sigma-coordination of a phenyl residue to the prosthetic heme iron. This process may play a role not only in phenylhydrazine-mediated erythrocyte lysis but also in the activation of guanylate cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1566418245,"Time-resolved Raman studies have shown that communication between the heme oxygen binding sites and the surrounding globin occurs through the iron-proximal histidine linkage. By comparing the frequency of the Fe-His stretching mode in equilibrium deoxy- and photoinduced transient deoxyhemoglobins, we have found that ligand binding induces protein structural changes that strengthen the Fe-His linkage. The extent of this increase is observed to depend upon the quaternary state. This dependence is reflected in the restricted set of values observed in transient and equilibrium studies for the frequency of the Fe-His stretching mode in both R and T state deoxyhemoglobins. For T state hemoglobins the frequency increases from 215 cm-1 to approximately 222 cm-1 in going from the stable to the nanosecond transient deoxy species. The corresponding change for R state human hemoglobins is from approximately 222 cm-1 to approximately 230 cm-1. Studies on transients derived from Fe-Co hybrid hemoglobins reveal no subunit heterogeneity associated with the R state transient (230 cm-1) at high pH. We also observe that perturbations of the protein known to destabilize the structure of ligand-bound R state hemoglobins are associated with a decrease in the frequency of the iron-proximal histidine stretching mode in the corresponding transient species. Such effects can originate from changes in either quaternary state or solution conditions as well as species-specific variations in protein structure. These results indicate that modulation of the Fe-His linkage could be a general mechanism for regulating ligand binding properties in hemoglobin. A direct connection between ligand binding and the Fe-His bond is suggested from our finding that the structural parameter(s) regulating the barrier height for germinate recombination is likely to be the same as the one(s) modulating the frequency of the Fe-His stretching mode in the transient deoxy species. Based on the recent conclusion that the variation in the tilt of histidine with respect to the heme plane is primarily responsible for the spectrum of frequencies observed for the Fe-His stretching mode we have examined a model in which protein regulation of binding occurs via a protein-induced change in the histidine tilt."
https://openalex.org/W1577851981,"Native glutathione S-transferases are composed of subunits with apparent molecular weights of 25,000, 23,500, or 22,000 which form either homo- or heterodimers. Glutathione S-transferases A, C, and X which contain two subunits with molecular weights of 23,500 yielded similar but nonidentical proteolytic fragmentation patterns. Fragments unique to the subunits of the homodimers A and X were present in decreased intensities in the patterns of form C. Two-dimensional electrophoresis under denaturing conditions showed single nonoverlapping spots for transferases A and X, while form C yielded two spots corresponding in position to those obtained from forms A and X. Renaturation of dissociated glutathione S-transferase C yielded enzymatically active transferases A, C, and X. These results indicate that form C is a heterodimer composed of one subunit from the homodimeric transferases A and X. This was substantiated by NH2-terminal sequence analysis showing extensive NH2-terminal homology amongst all three forms. However, in the positions where forms A and X yielded different residues, both amino acids were detected in the sequence of form C, indicating that the two subunits of Mr = 23,500 are the products of two different genes. NH2-terminal sequence analysis of the heterodimeric glutathione S-transferase B which is composed of subunits with molecular weights of 22,000 and 25,000 revealed a single unique sequence which bore no resemblance to the sequences of either forms A or X. Despite the identical NH2-terminal sequences, proteolytic fragmentation of the separated subunits showed markedly different fragmentation patterns. This indicates that two different mRNAs code for these two subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1569080553,"A phosphorus-containing metabolite that accounts for up to 80% of the total phosphate in perchloric acid extracts of Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum ATCC 29183 was purified by chromatography on an anion exchange column. The proton-decoupled 31P NMR spectrum of the sodium salt in D2O exhibits an AB quartet with lines at -9.48, -9.78, -10.78, and -11.08 ppm upfield from 85% phosphoric acid. The phosphorus-phosphorus coupling constant is 18.5 Hz, a value characteristic of a pyrophosphate linkage. The structure of this compound has been tentatively established as cyclic-2,3-diphosphoglycerate (Kanodia, S., and Roberts, M. F. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., in press). Although rapidly degraded in neutral cell extracts, the diphosphodiester was stable for hours in cells whose metabolism had been arrested by depletion of H2 from the medium. If the cells were transferred to phosphate-free medium in the presence of H2 and CO2, the diester disappeared in about one cell generation. These findings point to a possible role as a phosphate storage compound, but the real function(s) of this unusual diphosphodiester must await a complete analysis of its structure and further metabolic studies."
https://openalex.org/W1519843533,"Evidence is presented that Candida tropicalis grown on oleic acid as sole carbon and energy source possesses the ability to degrade saturated as well as unsaturated fatty acids. Inducible activities of the four enzymes required for beta-oxidation of saturated fatty acids are demonstrated in this organism. Furthermore, it is shown that 2,3-enoyl-CoA isomerase and 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase are induced simultaneously with the other beta-oxidation enzymes. A partial purification of 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase is described. This reductase has a specific requirement for NADPH, is unable to utilize NADH, and catalyzes the conversion of 2-trans, 4-cis-decadienoyl-CoA to 3-trans-decenoyl-CoA. It also reduces 2-trans, 4-trans-dienoyl-CoA esters. In vitro studies with extracts from oleate-grown cells of C. tropicalis containing the beta-oxidation enzymes showed that 4-cis-decenoyl-CoA, a metabolite of linoleic acid, was only degraded when the 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase step was not blocked by lack of NADPH. Based on the properties of the partially purified 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase and the results of the in vitro degradation studies, we conclude that in C. tropicalis the reductase together with the 2,3-dienoyl-CoA isomerase is necessary to link the degradation of unsaturated fatty acids to the beta-oxidation cycle. The implication of this conclusion for degradation of unsaturated fatty acids in general is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1597152486,"The viscoelastic properties of purified rabbit skeletal muscle actin filaments (F-actin) were measured at physiologic ionic strength and pH over a range of concentrations and filament lengths. Although F-actin demonstrated transitory elastic behavior, viscous flow was observed at longer times consistent with a high degree of filament overlap. The compliance was independent of stress over a 4-fold range, implying that the measurement did not disrupt any interfilament bonds. The dynamic storage modulus increased monotonically with frequency over the range measured, whereas the dynamic loss modulus had a relative minimum and was always less than the dynamic storage modulus. These observations are typical of topologically constrained behavior. The absolute value of the complex dynamic viscosity of F-actin, varied as the -0.8 power of the frequency and at a frequency of 0.1 radians/s was proportional to the product of the weight average filament length raised to the 0.7 power and the concentration. The experimental data agreed well with the predictions of a theory of the rheologic behavior of stiff rods in semidilute solutions. We conclude that the mechanical behavior of pure F-action solutions can be explained on the basis of the mutual topologic constraints to diffusion of long stiff rods which do not otherwise interact."
https://openalex.org/W1601078451,"UDP-glucose 4-epimerase and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 4-epimerase have been co-purified about 9,000-fold from porcine submaxillary glands by affinity chromatography on UDP-hexanolamine-agarose. The homogeneous epimerase has apparent Mr = 88,000 and contains two subunit species with apparent Mr = 37,000 and 35,000, respectively. The two subunits, however, are indistinguishable as judged by peptide mapping. The purified enzyme catalyzes equally well the reversible reactions UDP-glucose in equilibrium UDP-galactose and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine in equilibrium UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine. At saturating substrate concentrations, the ratio of the rate of the former reaction to that of the latter is 1.13 in the forward direction and 0.44 in the backward direction. Both reactions have the same Keq = 0.38 and the same dependence on pH. Moreover, both activities are lost at about the same rate by heat denaturation of the epimerase or reaction with N-ethylmaleimide. Kinetic analysis reveals that the reactants for one reaction are competitive inhibitors of the other reaction, with the Ki values of the inhibitors essentially identical with their Km values as substrates. Taken together, these studies suggest that UDP-glucose 4-epimerase and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 4-epimerase activities reside in a single enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1568798175,"The effects of surface potential and transmembrane potential on the binding and fluorescence of 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate (ANS) in suspensions of rat liver mitochondria was investigated. The binding of ANS is characterized by two classes of binding site: a high affinity (Kd = 10-50 microM), low capacity (n = 3-8 nmol/mg of protein) class in which bound ANS fluoresces strongly, and a low affinity (greater than 500 microM), high capacity (greater than 50 nmol/mg of protein) class with little fluorescence. The dissociation constant, Kd, of the high affinity site strongly depends on the surface potential of the external surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Hence, the binding and fluorescence of ANS can be used to estimate the surface potential. The dependence of ANS binding on the medium salt concentration is compatible with the Gouy-Chapman theory and allows accurate determination of surface potential and surface charge. The generation of transmembrane potential, either by oxidizable substrates, ATP, or potassium gradient leads to a decrease in the fluorescence. This decrease is the result of reduced ANS binding. However, the external surface potential as estimated from the charge screening effect of salt solutions is unchanged in energized membranes. The extent of decreased fluorescence correlates reasonably well with the magnitude of the transmembrane potential. The potential-induced quenching depends on pre-equilibration of ANS with the mitochondria, suggesting that the response is due to extrusion of ANS from the mitochondrial matrix. These findings do not support the suggestion that ANS quenching in energized mitochondria is due to an increase in the negative surface charge of the cytosolic surface of the inner membrane. The results are compatible with the suggestion that the response to energization is largely due to the formation of delta psi. However, because of the complex nature of the ANS response, it is concluded that neither the magnitude of surface potential nor the magnitude of membrane potential can be determined from the ANS response in energized mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1677812731,"The Ca2+-dependent regulation of the adenylate cyclase activity associated with microsomes isolated from bovine aortic smooth muscle has been studied. Calmodulin content of microsomal membranes employed in these studies was 80 +/- 14 ng/mg as determined by specific radioimmunoassay. In the absence of exogenous calmodulin, Ca2+ concentrations greater than 0.8 microM inhibited adenylate cyclase activity with one-half-maximal inhibition occurring at 2.5 microM Ca2+. In the presence of 5 or 9 microM bovine testis calmodulin, Ca2+ stimulated smooth muscle adenylate cyclase activity with one-half-maximal stimulation occurring at 0.2 microM for both 5 and 9 microM calmodulin. Calmodulin stimulation was observed between 0.1 and 0.8 microM Ca2+. Despite the presence of calmodulin, Ca2+ concentrations greater than 0.8 microM were inhibitory to smooth muscle adenylate cyclase activity. However, calmodulin reduced the sensitivity of the enzyme to inhibition by Ca2+. Trifluoperazine (100 microM) reversed both the calmodulin-dependent stimulation of cyclase activity and the calmodulin-induced decrease in sensitivity to the inhibitory actions of Ca2+. Trifluoperazine alone shifted the curve describing Ca2+ inhibition of cyclase activity to the left. The value of Ca2+ for one-half-maximal inhibition decreased from 2.9 to 1.2 microM. The trifluoperazine-induced shift was reversed by exogenous calmodulin. These data suggest: 1) Ca2+, at physiological concentrations, can stimulate as well as inhibit smooth muscle adenylate cyclase activity; 2) the stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity is mediated by calmodulin; 3) the Ca2+-calmodulin complex reduces the sensitivity of smooth muscle adenylate cyclase to the inhibitory actions of Ca2+; and 4) the level of calmodulin associated with smooth muscle adenylate cyclase may modulate the response (both stimulatory and inhibitory) of the enzyme to Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1568702455,"Indirect immunoprecipitations of labeled glycoproteins from the adenovirus-transformed rat cell line A2T2C4 and from adenovirus-infected HeLa cells revealed that the class I major histocompatibility antigens co-precipitated with the viral E19 protein. The degree of co-precipitation was highly dependent on the antiserum used. The identity of the co-precipitated components was verified by peptide mapping and radiochemical amino acid sequencing. Cell-free translation of mRNA for the E19 protein and the class I antigen heavy chains demonstrated that the E19 protein-class I antigen interaction is an inherent property of the participating components. In intact cells the virus protein and the transplantation antigens form large complexes, held together by weak, noncovalent interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1492092309,"Certain amino acids and other compounds are metabolized via: Propionyl-CoA carboxylase in equilibrium D-methylmalonyl-CoA racemase in equilibrium L-methylmalonyl-CoA (adenosylcobalamin) mutase in equilibrium succinyl-CoA in equilibrium tricarboxylic acid cycle. In cobalamin deficiency and in genetic disorders involving adenosylcobalamin or the mutase, large amounts of methylmalonic acid are excreted in the urine. Its origin is unknown, however, since nonesterified methylmalonic acid is not present in the above or other known pathways. To investigate the origin of methylmalonic acid, we fractionated rat liver by gel filtration and found a single peak (Mr = 35,000) of activity for the hydrolysis of DL-methylmalonyl-CoA to methylmalonic acid and CoA. The enzyme has been purified 3,100-fold with a yield of 2.1% from 1.6 kg of rat liver using a purification scheme consisting of ammonium sulfate fractionation, ion exchange chromatography on CM (carboxymethyl)-cellulose and DEAE-cellulose, affinity chromatography on CoA-agarose, and gel filtration on Sephadex G-100. The final preparation gave a single band on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of the purified enzyme is 35,000 based on gel filtration, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis in the presence and absence of 1% 2-mercaptoethanol. The enzyme was shown to be active on the D-isomer, but not on the L-isomer, of methylmalonyl-CoA by CD spectropolarimetry. The Km for D-methylmalonyl-CoA is 0.7 mM and the molar activity is 1,400 molecules of substrate/min/molecule of enzyme. At substrate concentrations of 0.5 mM, the relative rate of hydrolysis of CoA esters was as follows: D-methylmalonyl-CoA (100%), malonyl-CoA (16%), propionyl-CoA (3%), acetyl-CoA (1%), succinyl-CoA (less than 1%), and palmitoyl-CoA (less than 1%). This enzyme appears to account for the markedly increased amounts of methylmalonic acid that are excreted in the urine in cobalamin deficiency and in genetic disorders involving adenosylcobalamin or L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase."

https://openalex.org/W1599690136,"Replication of the lagging strand of bacteriophage T7 DNA occurs in a discontinuous fashion that requires RNA-primed DNA synthesis, the removal of the RNA primers, the replacement of the ribonucleotides with deoxyribonucleotides, and the covalent joining of adjacent DNA fragments. We have examined each of these steps as well as the whole process through the use of model substrates and partial reactions using purified proteins. Tetraribonucleotides (pppACCC or pppACCA), synthesized by the T7 gene 4 protein on single-stranded DNA, are used as primers by T7 DNA polymerase to yield RNA-terminated DNA fragments. The removal of the RNA primers is catalyzed by the 5' to 3' hydrolytic activities of either Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I or the T7 gene 6 exonuclease. The products of hydrolysis are pppApC, ATP, and nucleoside 5'-monophosphates or ATP and nucleoside 5'-monophosphates, respectively. The requirement for DNA synthesis to fill the gap between adjacent DNA fragments can be fulfilled by Form II of T7 DNA polymerase but not by Form I. DNA synthesis catalyzed by Form II of T7 DNA polymerase eliminates gaps to create a substrate for DNA ligase whereas strand displacement synthesis catalyzed by Form I creates an aberrant structure that cannot be joined. Either the host or phage DNA ligase can effect the final covalent joining. All steps in the replication of a lagging strand have been coupled in a model system that catalyzes the formation of covalently closed, circular, double-stranded DNA molecules using single-stranded viral DNA as template. A combination of four bacteriophage proteins, gene 4 protein, Form II of T7 DNA polymerase, gene 6 exonuclease, and DNA ligase, can accomplish this overall reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1584297168,"Proteoglycans were extracted from pigeon aortas with 4.0 M guanidine hydrochloride containing protease inhibitors to characterize the proteoglycan (PG) types, to examine and define their association with hyaluronic acid, and to compare pigeon aortic PG with human aortic PG isolated and characterized under similar conditions. Following chromatography of guanidine hydrochloride extracts on Sepharose CL-4B under dissociative conditions, two populations of PG were isolated. PG I, eluting at the column void volume, contained predominantly (83.2%) chondroitin sulfate whereas PG II, eluting at a Kav of 0.40, contained predominantly dermatan sulfate (54.7%). Following centrifugation, 76 and 63% of PG I and PG II, respectively, were located in the bottom two-fifths (p greater than 1.43 g/ml) of a CsCl gradient. Only PG I, predominantly chondroitin sulfate, was effective in associating with hyaluronic acid to form high molecular weight aggregates. The specific association was illustrated by removing endogenous arterial hyaluronic acid remaining in the preparation and demonstrating increasing formation of aggregate with increasing addition of human umbilical cord high molecular weight hyaluronic acid. The results of the study illustrate that artery PG of the pigeon are similar in distribution to those described for the human aorta and contain at least three types of PG, a chondroitin sulfate PG, a dermatan sulfate PG, and a polydisperse heparan sulfate PG. The chondroitin sulfate PG but not the dermatan sulfate PG are capable of forming high molecular weight aggregates with hyaluronic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1604253744,"The denaturation of human antithrombin III in urea and guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) was investigated by intrinsic fluorescence, circular dichroism, and absorption difference spectroscopy. Results suggest the existence of two structural domains as evidenced by the occurrence of two structural transitions, one at 0.7 M GdmCl and the other at 2.3 M GdmCl. This multistate unfolding transition has been confirmed under various protein concentrations and incubation times using different antithrombin III preparations, including a preparation that had been heated at 60 degrees C in the presence of 0.5 M citrate. The persistence of the multistate transition under these conditions rules out the possibilities that it could be due to the presence of different antithrombin populations in a mixture or the presence of a prosthetic group in the molecule. The first unfolding domain (0.7 M GdmCl) is stabilized by heparin and citrate. These protections suggest that the first unfolding domain of low stability may have functional relevance and important implications with respect to antithrombin III-heparin and antithrombin III-protease interaction."

A value of 49% for the cross-linking index was found for normal cells, while for those grown in the presence of low levels of penicillin G (0.1 micrograms/ml), the cross-linking index was reduced to 35%."
https://openalex.org/W1548251237,"A factor that binds Met-tRNAiMet in a ternary complex (eucaryotic initiation factor (eIF2) ) and an auxiliary component that strongly stimulates the activity of the binding factor (CoeIF2) have been purified from extracts of wheat germ. The molecular weights of the two factors, as determined by glycerol gradient centrifugation and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, are 88,000 and 20,000, respectively. Incubation of wheat germ eIF2 with gamma-[32P]ATP and alpha-subunit kinase results in the phosphorylation of a Mr = 40,500 subunit, while no specific phosphorylations are found when the eIF2 is incubated with the beta-kinase. These data are interpreted to suggest that CoeIF2 is a monomer of Mr = 20,000 while eIF2 may be a dimer, containing subunits of Mr = 40,000 and 50,000. Both eIF2 and CoeIF2 are strongly required for in vitro amino acid polymerization, providing the first direct demonstration of the function of CoeIF2 in protein synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1500450784,"The ratio of free ATP to free ADP in the mitochondrial matrix [( ATPf]/[ADPf]) has been measured in suspensions of isolated mitochondria under conditions of active phosphorylation of extramitochondrial ADP. These measurements utilized phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase which is present in the matrix of mitochondria from the livers of guinea pigs, chickens, and pigeons. Mitochondria isolated from these sources also contain nucleoside diphosphate kinase, malate dehydrogenase, and glutamate dehydrogenase or 3-OH-butyrate dehydrogenase. Together these enzymes catalyze the synthesis of phosphoenolpyruvate and CO2 from oxaloacetate with oxidative phosphorylation as an energy source. These reactions have been shown to be fully reversible in suspensions of mitochondria isolated from the above sources. With oxidative phosphorylation as the source of ATP, phosphoenolpyruvate was synthesized from malate and conversely addition of phosphoenolpyruvate, ADP, and CO2 led to synthesis of malate and ATP. The forward and reverse reactions were allowed to continue until the rate of change of metabolite concentrations was minimal and then the latter were measured. The intramitochondrial [Mg-ATPf]/[MgADPf] was calculated from the equilibrium constants for the reactions and the measured steady state concentrations of the metabolites in both the intra- and extramitochondrial spaces. The value of the intramitochondrial [MgATPf]/[MgADPf] was found to exceed the extramitochondrial value (adjusted to the same free Mg2+ concentration) by a factor (+/- S.E.) of 0.83 +/- 0.22 (n = 17) for the forward reaction and 1.81 +/- 0.54 (n = 11) for the reverse reaction. It is concluded that the adenine nucleotide translocase catalyzes electroneutral exchange of ATP for ADP and that this reaction does not contribute significantly to the energetics of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation."

The purification procedure included chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and concanavalin A-Sepharose, gel filtration on Sephadex G-200, and high performance liquid chromatography. The purified enzyme had a final specific activity of 1,200,000 units/mg of protein, a pH optimum of 6.1, a pI of 5.7, a Vmax of 1,240,000 units/mg, and a Km of 1.25 mM toward a natural substrate, aspartylglucosamine. The purified enzyme was remarkably thermostable, retaining 90% of initial activity after 1 h at 60 degrees C. The molecular weight of the native enzyme was estimated to be 80,000 by gel filtration and 84,000 by analytical polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Under denaturing conditions, the molecular weight was 76,000, indicating that the native enzyme was a monomer. Amino acid composition revealed only 2 methionine residues/enzyme molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1487748341,The nucleotide sequences of the NH2-terminal regions of the mglB (galactose-binding protein) and the araF (arabinose-binding protein) genes have been determined. A containing 23 amino acid residues immediately precedes the known sequence of the processed galactose-binding protein. The primary sequence of the signal peptide of the arabinose-binding protein has been redefined according to the established nucleotide sequence. The nucleotide sequences for the two signal peptides are preceded by apparent ribosome-binding sequences.
https://openalex.org/W1494416595,"We examined the hypothesis that initiation of eukaryotic protein synthesis involves ATP-dependent melting of 5‘-cap-proximal secondary structure in mRNA by eukaryotic initiation factors 4A and 4B. In reticulocyte lysate depleted of ribonucleoside triphosphates by pretreatment with hexokinase/glucose, initiation complex formation by native reovirus mRNA showed a strict requirement for ATP. The corresponding mRNA synthesized with ITP in place of GTP to minimize secondary structure also required ATP for binding to 40 S ribosomal subunits in complexes characteristic of initiation. In a partial reaction without ribosomes, purified eukaryotic initiation factors 4A and 4B bound and cross-linked to the capped 5‘-end of oxidized mRNA. This interaction was ATP-dependent with inosine-substituted or bromouridine-containing reovirus RNAs as observed previously with native mRNA. The results indicate that if initiation involves ATP-dependent denaturation of mRNA, the effect must occur after initiation factor-mediated attachment of mRNA to the 40 S ribosomal subunit."

https://openalex.org/W1674563136,"Rat serum phosphorylcholine-binding protein (PCBP) has been shown to inhibit the Ca2+-modulated heparin-lipoprotein precipitation reaction. This effect of PCBP on the reaction is prevented by phosphorylcholine (P-choline). A stoichiometric relationship between the serum very low density lipoproteins and PCBP was also evident in the heparin-very low density lipoprotein precipitation reaction (Nagpurkar, A., and Mookerjea, S. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 7440-7448). A study on the binding of PCBP to artificial liposomes was initiated to understand the mechanism of interaction between PCBP and phospholipids in soluble lipoproteins. Radioiodinated PCBP was incubated with multilamellar liposomes prepared with egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) and lysophosphatidylcholine, and it was found that the binding of PCBP to multilamellar liposomes was Ca2+-dependent and required the incorporation of about 25% lysophosphatidylcholine into the liposomes. Furthermore, the binding could be inhibited by addition of P-choline. The optimum concentrations of Ca2+ and liposomes as well as time and temperature required for binding were established. Analysis of Scatchard binding data yielded an association constant K alpha of 1.8 X 10(6) M-1 and a total binding capacity of 0.96 nmol/mumol of phospholipid. Substitution of P-choline head groups by phosphorylethanolamine and phosphorylserine on the PC of liposomes reduced the binding considerably, whereas the substitution of fatty acyl moieties on the PC of liposomes was without any effect. Bovine serum albumin was required in the assay to prevent artifactual binding of 125I-PCBP to the assay tubes. The results suggest that the P-choline groups on the surface of liposomes play an important role in the binding to PCBP and this may provide a possible explanation of the effect of PCBP on the Ca2+-dependent heparin-lipoprotein precipitation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1510624344,"The synthesis of cartilage link proteins was studied in organ cultures of sterna from normal and nanomelic chick embryos. Nanomelic chondrocytes synthesize cartilage-specific proteoglycans at 1 to 2% of normal levels, and therefore, nanomelic cartilage contains very little proteoglycan aggregate. The defect in proteoglycan synthesis results from a reduced availability of proteoglycan core protein. Link protein synthesis was monitored by the incorporation of [35S]cysteine into protein. Radiolabeled proteins were extracted from cartilage in 4 M guanidine hydrochloride and separated from proteoglycan monomer by centrifugation in dissociative cesium chloride density equilibrium gradients. The top one-sixth (D6) fraction of these gradients contained link protein and was used to extract one unlabeled normal sternum. These extracts were dialyzed to conditions permitting the formation of proteoglycan aggregates and chromatographed on controlled pore glass (CPG 2500). Proteoglycan aggregates chromatograph in the void volume (V0) of these columns. Radioactivity eluting in the CPG 2500 (V0 from normal and nanomelic D6 fractions was identified as link protein by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate and subsequent fluorography. Link proteins were also extracted from unlabeled cartilages and identified by the Western blotting technique using link-specific antiserum. Immunoprecipitation of [35S]cysteine-labeled link protein from normal and nanomelic D6 fractions indicated that nanomelic chondrocytes synthesize link protein at normal levels."

Dissociation of the dimer with p-chloromercuribenzoate and its reconstitution with exogenous NAD or one of its analogues and 2-mercaptoethanol provides an indirect method of study of the site. Depending on the reconstitution properties, the analogues can be classified in the following groups: (i) analogues that have no affinity for the site; (ii) analogues that have affinity but are not incorporated into the apoenzyme; (iii) analogues that produce catalytically inactive holoenzymes; and (iv) analogues that produce catalytically active holoenzymes. Minimum structural requirements that lead to affinity for the coenzyme site and to binding to the apoenzyme can also be discerned from these studies. Reconstitution with etheno-NAD, a fluorescent analogue of NAD, indicates the presence of a hydrophobic pocket for the adenosine subsite."
https://openalex.org/W1586228908,"Histidase is expressed in only two tissues of the rat, liver and epidermis. Hepatic histidase synthesis and catalytic activity undergo complex sex-specific developmental courses. To determine whether changes in functional histidase mRNA levels underlie this developmental pattern, total cellular RNA was translated in a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free lysate system. Adult liver total cellular RNA directed the synthesis of three translational products immunoreactive with anti-native histidase: a polypeptide of Mr = 75,000 (75K), which corresponds to the in vivo synthesized histidase subunit, and two higher molecular weight proteins, a major and a minor peptide of Mr = 150,000 (150K) and 140,000 (140K), respectively. These latter peptides do not seem to be aggregates or dimers of the 75K polypeptide or precursors which are post-translationally hydrolyzed to Mr = 75,000; their origin and function remain to be clarified. In contrast to in vitro translation of hepatic total cellular RNA, Western blot analysis of liver cytosol confirms the presence of only the 75K histidase subunit, with no evidence of anti-histidase immunoreactive peptides of Mr = 140,000-150,000 synthesized in vivo. Quantitation of the radioactivity in the immunocomplexed 75K histidase subunit, translated using total RNA from livers of fetuses, 19-day-old males, 35-day-old males, adult males and females, and adult kidney and brain (0, 0.007, 0.010, 0.016, 0.031, 0, and 0%, respectively, of total released proteins) indicates that, in general, levels of functional histidase subunit mRNA reflected histidase catalytic activity (0, 0.20, 0.50, 1.01, 3.00, 0 and 0 units/g of tissue) during tissue differentiation and sex specific development. The above data indicate that initial expression and subsequent increases in synthesis and activity of histidase during hepatic differentiation, postnatal development, and sex hormone regulation are due to pretranslationally controlled augmentation in the levels of functional mRNA which specifies the histidase subunit. In tissues which do not express histidase no functional histidase mRNA is evident. The levels of the RNA which translate the combined 140-150K histidase-like polypeptides (0, 0.007, 0.014, 0.035, 0.034, 0, and 0% of released proteins) also paralleled the increase in enzymatic activity during tissue differentiation and development; however, no difference between males and females was evident. The significance of these observations awaits elucidation of the nature of these RNA(s)."
