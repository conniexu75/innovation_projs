https://openalex.org/W2111804569,"Laccase is a polyphenol oxidase, which belongs to the family of blue multicopper oxidases. These enzymes catalyze the one-electron oxidation of four reducing-substrate molecules concomitant with the four-electron reduction of molecular oxygen to water. Laccases oxidize a broad range of substrates, preferably phenolic compounds. In the presence of mediators, fungal laccases exhibit an enlarged substrate range and are then able to oxidize compounds with a redox potential exceeding their own. Until now, only one crystal structure of a laccase in an inactive, type-2 copper-depleted form has been reported. We present here the first crystal structure of an active laccase containing a full complement of coppers, the complete polypeptide chain together with seven carbohydrate moieties. Despite the presence of all coppers in the new structure, the folds of the two laccases are quite similar. The coordination of the type-3 coppers, however, is distinctly different. The geometry of the trinuclear copper cluster in the Trametes versicolor laccase is similar to that found in the ascorbate oxidase and that of mammalian ceruloplasmin structures, suggesting a common reaction mechanism for the copper oxidation and the O2 reduction. In contrast to most blue copper proteins, the type-1 copper in the T. versicolorlaccase has no axial ligand and is only 3-fold coordinated. Previously, a modest elevation of the redox potential was attributed to the lack of an axial ligand. Based on the present structural data and sequence comparisons, a mechanism is presented to explain how laccases could tune their redox potential by as much as 200 mV.

The most prominent representatives of this family comprise laccase, ascorbate oxidase (AO), and mammalian plasma ceruloplasmin, which have been the subject of intensive investigations for many decades. The reduction of molecular oxygen is accompanied by a one-electron oxidation of reducing substrates. Blue copper oxidases contain at least one type-1 (T1) copper, which is presumably the primary oxidation site. Blue multicopper oxidases typically employ at least three additional coppers: one type-2 (T2) and two type-3 (T3) coppers arranged in a trinuclear cluster, the latter being the site at which the reduction of molecular oxygen takes place. The three different copper types can be differentiated from their spectroscopic behavior. The T1 copper has a strong absorption around 600 nm, which gives rise to the typical blue color of the copper oxidases. The T2, or “normal,” copper exhibits only weak absorption in the visible region but is EPR-active, whereas the two coppers of the T3 site are characterized by an absorption band at about 330 nm. They are, however, EPR-silent due to an antiferromagnetic coupling mediated by a bridging ligand.Laccase (benzenediol oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.10.3.2), a phenol oxidase with a molecular mass of about 70 kDa, catalyzes the oxidation of a broad range of substrates such as polyphenols, methoxy-substituted phenols, diamines, and some inorganic compounds (2Xu F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7608-7614Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 3Xu F. Shin W. Brown S.H. Wahleithner J.A. Sundaram U.M. Solomon E.I. Biochim. Biophys.

Since their discovery more than one century ago in the Japanese tree Rhus venicifera (5Yoshida H. J. Chem. Soc. (Tokyo). 1883; 43: 472-486Crossref Google Scholar), laccases have been found to be widely distributed among plants, where they are involved in the wounding response and the synthesis of lignin. Lignin, which provides the structural component of the plant cell wall, is a heterogeneous and complex biopolymer that consists of phenyl propanoid units linked by various non-hydrolyzable C–C– and C–O– bonds (6Gellerstedt G. Northy R.A. Wood Sci. Technol. 1989; 23: 75-83Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For many years, it was thought that only the ligninolytic system of some white-rot fungi capable of degrading this recalcitrant polymer to a major extent involved lignin peroxidase and manganese peroxidase (7Evans C.S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1985; 27: 339-343Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Although the latter can only oxidize the phenolic components of lignin, lignin peroxidase, which has a high redox potential, is also capable of cleaving the non-phenolic aromatic bonds. Since laccase alone is incapable of cleaving the non-phenolic bonds of lignin, it was not considered a significant component of the ligninolytic system, despite the secretion of large quantities of laccase by these fungi under ligninolytic conditions. However, Bourbonnais and Paice (8Bourbonnais R. Paice M.G. FEBS Lett. 1990; 267: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar) reported that laccases can catalyze the oxidation of non-phenolic benzylalcohols in the presence of a mediator, such as 2,2′-azino-bis-[3-ethylthiazoline-6-sulfonate]. This finding led to the discovery that laccase-mediator systems effectively degrade residual lignin in unbleached pulp (9Call, H. P. (December 22, 1994) World Patent Application WO 94/29510.Google Scholar). Furthermore, laccases produced by some wood-rotting fungi from the genus Basidiomyete do in fact play a major role in the biodegradation of lignin (10Coll P.M. Fernandez-Abalos J.M. Villanueva J.R. Santamaria R. Perez P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 2607-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and have the capability to oxidize recalcitrant aromatic compounds with redox potentials exceeding their own (2Xu F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7608-7614Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). This ability has been exploited in various industrial processes such as pulp delignification (11Sealey J. Ragauskas A.J. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1998; 23: 422-426Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and bioremediation of soils and water (12Li K., Xu, F. Eriksson K.-H.L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 2654-2660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this area of research is the subject of intense biotechnological activity.A question that is yet to be answered is to ascertain how these different bmCuOs modulate their redox potentials (E0) (13Fee J.A. Malmström B.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 153: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) at the structural level, despite having very similar (14Hough M.A. Hall J.F. Kanbi L.D.

Investigations into this issue are especially relevant in the case of the laccases (15Xu F. Berka R.M. Wahleithner J.A. Nelson B.A. Shuster J.R. Brown S.H. Palmer A.E. Solomon E.I. Biochem.

This has led to their classification as low (500 mV versus normal hydrogen electrode) and high (700–800 mV) E0 laccases (15Xu F. Berka R.M. Wahleithner J.A. Nelson B.A. Shuster J.R. Brown S.H.

Ladenstein R. Huber R. Bolognesi M. Avigliano L. Petruzzelli R. Rossi A. Finazzi-Agro A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 179-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) and mammalian plasma ceruloplasmin (19Zaitseva I. Zaitsev V. Card G. Moshkov K. Bax B. Ralph A. Lindley P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 15-23Crossref Scopus (352) Google Scholar) were determined some years ago, but despite being an enzyme that referred to many questions regarding the catalytic mechanism in bmCuOs and despite being the smallest representative of the bmCuO family, no structure of an active laccase is presently available. Ducroset al. (20Ducros V. Brzozowski A.M. Wilson K.S. Brown S.H. Østergaard P. Schneider P. Yaver D.S. Pedersen A.H. Davies G.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 310-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) reported the crystal structure of a laccase from the fungus Coprinus cinereus. This was found to be a copper type-2-depleted form in which the putative T2 copper is completely absent and therefore is in a catalytically incompetent state. The difficulties in successfully crystallizing the active form of laccase have been unanimously attributed to the occurrence of extensive micro-heterogeneity, presumably caused by variable glycosylation of the enzyme. Unfortunately, deglycosylation to obtain high quality diffracting crystals of the C. cinereus laccase (CcL) resulted in the loss of copper.Recently, we reported the purification of laccase isozymes from the fungi Trametes versicolor and Pycnoporus cinnabarinus to apparent isoelectric homogeneity without deglycosylation (21Antorini M. Herpoël-Gimbert I Choinowski T. Asther M. Sigoillot J.C. Winterhalter K.H. Piontek K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1594: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These protein samples were fully active, and crystals obtained diffracted to high resolution (21Antorini M. Herpoël-Gimbert I Choinowski T. Asther M. Sigoillot J.C. Winterhalter K.H. Piontek K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1594: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We now report the crystal structure of a T. versicolor laccase (TvL) in its oxidized, copper-complete state. This structure gives the first insight into the coordination of all the four copper centers in the fully active enzyme. Our structural data suggest a mechanism, which we support with comparative sequence data, by which laccases could tune their redox potential.DISCUSSIONThe first crystal structure of an active laccase containing a full complement of coppers has been determined to high resolution. We solely attribute the success of obtaining good diffracting crystals to the preparation of an isozyme sample to apparent isoelectrophoretic homogeneity. This structure allows a detailed insight into the geometry of the four copper sites in the intact enzyme in this, the smallest of the family of blue multicopper oxidases.A comparison of the trinuclear cluster and its environment in TvL with that of other known structures of this enzyme family shows that it is structurally highly conserved. This is true for the copper geometry, for the two channels, which provide access for molecular oxygen to and release of water from the T2/T3 cluster, as well as for the conserved His-Cys-His tripeptide, implicated in the electron transfer pathway between the T1 copper and the trinuclear cluster. This structural conservation reflects a common reaction mechanism for the copper oxidation and the O2 reduction in these enzymes. Interestingly, reoxidation of the coppers occurs at exactly the same rate of 5 × 106m−1sec−1 in both laccase and AO (36Andreasson L.-E. Bränden R. Reinhammar B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 438: 370-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 37Nakamura T. Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1968; 64: 267Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).Different is the situation concerning the specificity for and reactivity toward reducing substrates in the blue multicopper oxidases. Substrate specificity is usually defined by the geometry and chemical nature of the substrate binding pocket. Such a pocket or crevice provides a suitable environment for the binding of the substrate(s) and their emerging intermediates. In a follow-up report, based on the crystal structure of a substrate complex of TvL, this issue will be discussed in detail. Concerning the reactivity of TvL, in comparison with other laccases and bmCuOs, the discussion will now continue on the T1 copper ligation and its possible effect on the redox potential. The reactivity of laccases has been correlated by some authors with their redox potential (3Xu F. Shin W. Brown S.H. Wahleithner J.A. Sundaram U.M. Solomon E.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1292: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) and is thought to play a major role in the overall performance of an enzyme.Contrary to other blue copper oxidases, the coordination of the T1 copper in TvL and CcL is trigonal coplanar. The typical coordination of type-1 coppers in bmCuOs and in the small copper enzymes consists of two histidines, one cysteine, and one axial methionine and is therefore 4-fold. Axial coordination has been considered to be one factor affecting the redox potential of copper enzymes (38Machonkin T.E. Quintanar L. Palmer A.E. Hassett R. Severance S. Kosman D.J. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 5507-5517Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 39Malmström B.G. Reinhammar B. Vanngard T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 205: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Mutational studies on azurin showed that the substitution of methionine by a leucine resulted in an increase of the E0 by about 0.1 V (40Farver O. Skov L.K. Pascher T. Karlsson B.G. Nordling M. Lundberg L.G. Vanngard T. Pecht I. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7317-7322Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In CcL, which has a redox potential of 550 mV, the axial position is occupied by a leucine, whereas in TvL, with a redox potential of 800 mV, there is a phenylalanine in the corresponding position. Thus, it has been speculated that a phenylalanine in the axial position is responsible for the very high E0 of TvL. However,Neurospora crassa laccase with a leucine in the axial position also has a high E0 of 780 mV. Furthermore, by mutagenesis studies, it was demonstrated that a Leu-Phe mutation of this axial residue had virtually no influence on the redox potential (15Xu F. Berka R.M. Wahleithner J.A. Nelson B.A. Shuster J.R. Brown S.H. Palmer A.E. Solomon E.I. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). All these data suggest that other factors are more important.With the structure determination of TvL, structural information is now available of a high E0 laccase, which can be compared with the structure of the low E0 enzyme from C. cinereus, to explain the structural origin of the difference in redox potential. We noticed that the Cu1-Nδ2 (His-458) distance in TvL is 0.17 Å longer than in CcL, which is the most noticeable difference at the T1 copper site (Table IV). An elongated Cu–N bond could have an effect on the redox potential since the contribution of the free electron pair from the nitrogen to the copper would be decreased, rendering the copper more electron deficient. This would give rise to a destabilization of the higher oxidation states. In other words, the copper redox potential should increase. Consequently, we searched for structural components, which could cause the longer Cu–N bond and which could also be found in other high E0laccases. Superposition of the two structures revealed that a small α-helix (residues 455–461), which carries the copper T1 ligating His-458 in TvL, is displaced away from the copper, as compared with its corresponding position in CcL (Fig. 7). A hydrogen bond between Glu-460 and Ser-113, the latter being situated in the opposite domain 1 (Fig. 8), seems to be responsible for this. Interestingly, this particular serine is one of the three residues in the generously allowed region of the Ramachandran plot. It is presumably forced by the hydrogen bond into an unfavorable main chain conformation. As a consequence of the attractive H-bond interaction, the whole helix, which contains His-458, is pulled toward domain 1, thus increasing the Cu–N distance (Fig. 8). In CcL, the position of the Glu-460 is taken by a methionine that cannot form such a hydrogen bond. Moreover, the position corresponding to Ser-113 is a glycine in CcL. It might be argued that the difference in the Cu–N bond lengths is statistically not meaningful since an estimate of the coordinate error calculated with the method described by Luzatti (41Luzatti P.V. Acta Crystallogr. 1952; 5: 802-810Crossref Google Scholar) gives a value of 0.16 Å. As pointed out by Baker (42Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 1071-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), this estimate indicates a maximum coordinate error. The copper atoms and their neighboring protein residues are among the best defined atoms in the whole crystal structure with low temperature factors. It is therefore most probable that their coordinate errors are lower than the value given above. Even if one assumes a significantly lower coordinate error for the coppers and their ligands in TvL, the coordinate error of the CcL crystal structure has to be taken into account. Although this value has not been reported, based on the R-factor and the resolution, an error of about 0.15–0.20 Å would be realistic. Therefore, based on statistical grounds, a definitive statement on the reliability of the different Cu–N bond lengths (for the copper type-1) cannot be given. However, the mechanism suggested above and its possible effect on the redox potential is supported by the structural evidence (the presence of the Ser-Glu hydrogen bond) and in particular by a comparison of the available sequences and their correlation with known redox potentials of laccases. These sequence data reveal that a glutamic acid in the position corresponding to Glu-460 and a serine corresponding to Ser-113 in TvL is a highly conserved feature among high E0 enzymes, as well as in some laccases of ligninolytic fungi with unknown E0. We would assume that the latter most likely are also high E0 enzymes.Figure 8Schematic drawing illustrating the movement of a helical segment in TvL. Upon formation of a hydrogen bond between Glu-460 and Ser-113, a movement of the helical segment carrying His-458 could result, which would subsequently cause an elongation of the Cu1-N (His-458) bond at the T1 site. In low E0laccases, such a hydrogen bond is not possible, due to the lack of an appropriate hydrogen bond donor and acceptor. The bond lengths are given in Angstroms.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Previously, a Leu-Glu-Ala tripeptide, immediately following the copper ligating His-458, has been assumed to be characteristic for the high E0 laccases (15Xu F. Berka R.M. Wahleithner J.A. Nelson B.A. Shuster J.R. Brown S.H. Palmer A.E. Solomon E.I. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The glutamate in this peptide corresponds to the aforementioned Glu-460 in TvL. Moreover, TvL has such a Leu-Glu-Ala sequence, typical for the high E0 laccases, whereas CcL has Leu-Met-Asn in the equivalent position. In an attempt to tune the redox potential of recombinant laccases, the high E0 sequence was inserted into low E0 enzymes and vice versa (15Xu F. Berka R.M. Wahleithner J.A. Nelson B.A. Shuster J.R. Brown S.H. Palmer A.E. Solomon E.I. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Although marginal changes in the phenol-oxidase activity were observed, which could be explained by the fact that this peptide is part of the substrate binding pocket, the redox potential was not affected. The lack of an appropriate counterpart in these studies, being equivalent to Ser-113, could explain why these studies were unsuccessful in increasing the redox potential of the low E0 form.It has been demonstrated previously that an axial methionine ligand at the T1 copper is responsible for a change in the redox potential of about 100 mV. Additional structural determinants, which could be utilized by blue copper oxidases to tune the potential over a larger range, have been lacking so far. Based on our structural data, we suggest a new mechanism by which laccases and possibly also other redox metallo-enzymes, can increase their redox potential by more than 200 mV. Such a mechanism assumes a lessening of electron density contribution at the metal cation through a stretching of the bond between the metal and the ligating amino acid. This movement could be caused by an appropriate hydrogen bond that results in the displacement of the polypeptide segment, which carries the coordinating amino acid. Our laboratory is currently involved in site-directed mutagenesis studies to test this proposition and to provide possibly a definitive answer to this intriguing question. Among the few enzymes that are able to catalyze the four-electron reduction of molecular oxygen to water are the members of the blue multicopper oxidase (bmCuO)1family (for a review, see Ref. 1). The most prominent representatives of this family comprise laccase, ascorbate oxidase (AO), and mammalian plasma ceruloplasmin, which have been the subject of intensive investigations for many decades.

Little is known about the molecular mechanism of this inhibition except the requirement for a specific G protein and the involvement of an unidentified diffusible second messenger. We demonstrate here that intracellular ATP is required for recovery of KCNQ2/KCNQ3 current from muscarinic suppression, with an EC(50) of approximately 0.5 mM. Substitution of nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs for ATP slowed or prevented recovery. ADPbetaS but not ADP also prevented the recovery. Receptor-mediated inhibition was irreversible when recycling of agonist-sensitive pools of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)) was blocked by lipid kinase inhibitors. Lipid phosphorylation by PI 4-kinase is required for recovery from muscarinic modulation of M current."
https://openalex.org/W2143418370,"The presence of polyribosomes in dendritic spines suggests a potential involvement of local protein synthesis in the modification of synapses. Dendritic spine and synapse ultrastructure were compared after low-frequency control or tetanic stimulation in hippocampal slices from postnatal day (P)15 rats. The percentage of spines containing polyribosomes increased from 12% ± 4% after control stimulation to 39% ± 4% after tetanic stimulation, with a commensurate loss of polyribosomes from dendritic shafts at 2 hr posttetanus. Postsynaptic densities on spines containing polyribosomes were larger after tetanic stimulation. Local protein synthesis might therefore serve to stabilize stimulation-induced growth of the postsynaptic density. Furthermore, coincident polyribosomes and synapse enlargement might indicate spines that are expressing long-term potentiation induced by tetanic stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2042902655,"We report that EphB receptors direct unique axonal behaviors required for mapping the dorsal-ventral (D-V) retinal axis along the lateral-medial (L-M) axis of the superior colliculus (SC). EphBs are expressed in a D-V gradient, ephrin-B1 in a L-M gradient in SC, and ephrin-B3 at its midline. EphBs and ephrin-Bs are expressed in countergradients in retina and SC. Developmental analyses reveal that retinal axons lack D-V ordering along the L-M axis, but directionally extend branches along it to establish ordered arbors. Directed branch extension is disrupted in EphB2; EphB3-deficient mice resulting in lateral ectopic arbors. Mice with kinase-inactive EphB2 have similar D-V mapping defects indicating that forward signaling dominates over reverse signaling. Our data suggest that branches of EphB expressing axons are attracted medially by ephrin-B1, and provide molecular mechanisms for D-V mapping in visual centers."
https://openalex.org/W2079688281,"The androgen receptor (AR) can be activated in the absence of androgens by interleukin-6 (IL-6) in human prostate cancer cells. The events involved in ligand-independent activation of the AR are unknown, but have been suggested to involve phosphorylation of the AR itself or a receptor-associated protein. Steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) has been shown to interact with the human AR and to modulate ligand-dependent AR transactivation and is regulated by phosphorylation by MAPK. To date, no one has examined the role of SRC-1 in ligand-independent activation of the AR by IL-6 or other signaling pathways known to activate the full-length receptor. This study addressed this and has revealed the following. 1) SRC-1 similarly enhanced ligand-independent activation of the AR by IL-6 to the same magnitude as that obtained via ligand-dependent activation. 2) Androgen and IL-6 stimulated the MAPK pathway. 3) MAPK was required for both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent activation of the AR. 4) Phosphorylation of SRC-1 by MAPK was required for optimal ligand-independent activation of the AR by IL-6. 5) Protein-protein interaction between endogenous AR and SRC-1 was dependent upon treatment of LNCaP cells with IL-6 or R1881. 6) Protein-protein interaction between the AR N-terminal domain and SRC-1 was independent of MAPK. 7) Ligand-independent activation of the AR did not occur by a mechanism of overexpression of either solely wild-type SRC-1 or mutant SRC-1 that mimics its phosphorylated form.

Wright A.P. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 389-400PubMed Google Scholar). These receptors have similar protein structures that are composed of an N-terminal domain (NTD) that contains AF-1 (activation function-1), a DNA-binding domain (DBD), a hinge region, and a ligand-binding domain that contains AF-2. After the ligand binds to the AR, the heat-shock proteins are dissociated from the AR, and the ligand-receptor complex translocates into the nucleus, binds specific androgen response elements (AREs) on the chromosome, interacts with coactivators, and modulates the expression of androgen-regulated genes (2Kuil C.W. Berrevoets C.A. Mulder E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27569-27576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In the absence of androgen, the AR can be activated by growth factors and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and elevation of intracellular cyclic AMP (3Culig Z. Hobisch A. Cronauer M.V. Radmayr C. Trapman J.

One possible mechanism underlying ligand-independent activation of the AR by these alternative pathways may involve phosphorylation of either the AR itself or receptor-associated proteins such as coactivators (7Sadar M.D. J.

Coactivators are proteins that generally do not bind DNA, but are recruited to the promoter through protein-protein interactions with transcription factors such as the AR usually in a ligand-dependent manner. Interactions between the receptor and coactivator enhance receptor-dependent transcription. The first identified member of the coactivator family that regulates steroid receptor action was steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) (9Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of SRC-1 by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is required for optimal progesterone receptor-dependent transcription and for functional cooperation with cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein (10Rowan B.G. Garrison N. Weigel N.L. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8720-8730Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). SRC-1 interacts with both AF-1 and AF-2 of the AR and enhances ligand-dependent transactivation to increase transcription of androgen-regulated genes (11Bevan C.L. Hoare S. Claessens F. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8383-8392Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 12Ma H. Hong H. Huang S.-H. Irvine R.A. Webb P. Kushner P.J. Coetzee G.A. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6164-6173Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is an androgen-regulated gene that is routinely used by oncologists and urologists to monitor treatment responses, prognosis, and progression in patients with prostate cancer (13Catalona W.J. Smith D.S. Ratliff T.L. Basler J.W. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1993; 270: 948-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Patients with advanced prostate cancer treated with hormone ablation therapy inevitably succumb to their disease as the tumor progresses to an androgen-independent condition, an early sign of which is a rising titer of serum PSA. There is mounting evidence that ligand-independent activation of the AR may play a role in hormone-refractory disease. This is because the AR is expressed in hormone-refractory prostate cancer (14Hobisch A. Culig Z. Radmayr C. Bartsch G. Klocker H. Hittmair A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3068-3072PubMed Google Scholar), and many of the same genes that are increased by androgens in androgen-dependent prostate cancer xenografts become elevated in androgen-independent prostate cancer xenografts in castrated hosts (15Gregory C.W. Hamil K.G. Kim D. Hall S.H. Pretlow T.G. Mohler J.L. French F.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5718-5724PubMed Google Scholar). PSA gene expression can be induced in prostate cancer cells by IL-6 via ligand-independent activation of the AR (8Ueda T. Bruchovsky N. Sadar M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7076-7085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Currently, the underlying molecular mechanism of ligand-independent activation of the AR is not known. A possible mechanism may include increased expression of coactivators of the AR such as SRC-1, which has been reported to be increased in a large number of recurrent prostate cancer tissue (16Gregory C.W., He, B.

Urology. 2001; 58: 289-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). IL-6 has gained considerable clinical interest for a number of reasons, including the following. 1) Prostate cancer predominately metastasizes to bones that express IL-6 (4Hobisch A. Eder I.E. Putz T. Horninger W. Bartsch G. Klocker H. Culig Z. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4640-4645PubMed Google Scholar, 18Haq M. Goltzman D. Tremblay G. Brodt P. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4613-4619PubMed Google Scholar). 2) Epithelial cells from normal, hyperplasia, and carcinoma prostate tissue also secrete IL-6 in culture media (19Twillie D.A.

Urology. 1995; 45: 542-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). 3) The IL-6 receptor is expressed in normal prostate, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and cancer (20Siegsmund M.J.

In this study, the mechanism of ligand-independent activation of the AR by IL-6 in prostate cancer cells was further investigated. Although much has been reported about the mechanism of ligand-dependent activation of steroid hormone receptors and their interaction with SRC-1, nothing has been reported about the mechanism of ligand-independent activation of the AR and the role of SRC-1. Here we report for the first time that SRC-1 enhances ligand-independent activation of the AR NTD by IL-6 via a pathway that is dependent upon MAPK in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells. LNCaP human prostate cancer cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma, unless stated otherwise. Bovine serum albumin and protease inhibitors (CompleteTM) were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. IL-6 was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The MEK inhibitor U0126 was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). The human AR cDNA was a gift from Dr. A. O. Brinkmann (Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands). ARR3-tk-luciferase (where ARR is the androgen response region and tk is thymidine kinase) (31Snoek R. Rennie P.S. Kasper S. Matusik R.J.

Hsieh (University of Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). The expression vectors for SRC-1 were supplied by Drs. Bert W. O'Malley and Nancy L. Weigel (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) (10Rowan B.G. Garrison N. Weigel N.L. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8720-8730Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). LNCaP cells (3 × 105/well) were seeded in six-well plates and incubated with RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum for 24 h. Transfection was performed using Lipofectin® reagent (5 μl/well; Invitrogen) according to previous published methods (7Sadar M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7777-7783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The total amount of plasmid DNA was normalized to 3 μg/well by the addition of a control plasmid that encoded the luciferase gene, but lacked the promoter insert. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin with R1881 or IL-6. Cells were collected after a 24- or 48-h incubation using the lysis buffer provided with the Promega luciferase kit. Luciferase activities were measured using the Promega dual-luciferase assay system with the aid of a multiplate luminometer (EG&G Berthold). Luciferase activities were normalized by the protein concentration of the samples (8Ueda T. Bruchovsky N. Sadar M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7076-7085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 10Rowan B.G. Garrison N. Weigel N.L. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell.

Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The results presented as -fold induction give the relative luciferase activity of the treated cells divided by that of the control cells. All transfection experiments were carried out in triplicate wells and repeated three to seven times using at least two sets of plasmids that were prepared separately. LNCaP cells (2 × 106/dish) were plated in dishes (10-cm diameter) in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Twenty-four hours later, the medium was removed and replaced with RPMI 1640 medium (i.e. serum-free medium) for 24 h prior to the addition of IL-6, R1881, or inhibitors. After incubation with these compounds, whole cell lysates were prepared as described previously (33Sadar M.D. Ash R. Sundqvist J. Olsson P.-E. Andersson T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17635-17643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein (40 μg) from each sample were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel (7 or 12%), followed by transfer to an Immobilon membrane (Millipore Corp.) for Western blot analysis. Immunoblots were blocked for 1 h in 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20). Blots were incubated with anti-phospho-p44/p42 MAPK Thr202/Tyr204antibody (1:500; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA), anti-SRC-1 antibody (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-AR antibody (2 μg/ml; AR441, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and anti-β-actin antibody (1:5000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK); washed three times with TBST; and incubated for 1 h with the secondary antibody (1:2000). The protein bands were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. orAmersham Biosciences). Endogenous AR was immunoprecipitated from 5 × 106 LNCaP cells that were plated in T-175cm flasks. The cells were incubated in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium for 24 h before treating with vehicle, R1881 (10 nm), or IL-6 (50 ng/ml) for 6 h. Cells were harvested; nuclear lysates were prepared and precleared with anti-mouse IgG and protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); antibody AR441 (4 μg/ml) was added; and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in sample buffer. The immunocomplexes were separated by SDS-PAGE (7%). Western blot analysis was carried out with anti-SRC-1 antibody. AR NTD-Gal4 DBD fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated from LNCaP cells (2 × 106/dish) that were plated in dishes (10-cm diameter) in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum for 24 h. Cells transfected with expression vectors encoding SRC-1 (1 μg/dish) and AR-(1–233)-Gal4 DBD, AR-(1–558)-Gal4 DBD, or the Gal4 DBD (10 μg/dish) with 60 μl of Lipofectin® reagent for 24 h were treated with IL-6 (50 ng/ml) or vehicle for 6 h. Cells were harvested, and whole cell and nuclear lysates were prepared as described previously (33Sadar M.D. Ash R. Sundqvist J. Olsson P.-E. Andersson T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17635-17643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). After the supernatants of the cells were precleared by the addition of 0.25 μg of rabbit IgG and 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose, anti-Gal4 DBD antibody (2 μg; RK5C1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with ice-cold lysis buffer and resuspended in sample buffer. Immunocomplexes were separated by SDS-PAGE (7%). Western blot analyses were carried out with anti-SRC-1 antibody (1:200; 20-h incubation). The role of SRC-1 as a coactivator of the unliganded AR that has been activated by alternative pathways (ligand-independent activation) has not been described. Therefore, we sought to determine whether SRC-1 plays a role in ligand-independent activation of the AR by IL-6. To do this, LNCaP human prostate cancer cells expressing endogenous AR were transiently cotransfected with ARE-driven reporter plasmids and the expression vector for SRC-1 prior to treatment with synthetic androgen (R1881) or IL-6. The first ARE-driven reporter used was the PSA (6.1 kb)-luciferase reporter gene construct. This luciferase construct contains both the enhancer and promoter regions of the clinically relevant PSA gene and is induced by androgens (8Ueda T. Bruchovsky N. Sadar M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7076-7085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 34Cleutjens K.B.J.M. van der Korput H.A.G.M. van Eekelen C.C. van Rooij H.C. Faber P.W. Trapman J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 148-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, R1881 (10 nm) induced the PSA (6.1 kb)-luciferase reporter construct by ∼70-fold. Transfection of the SRC-1 expression plasmid (0.2 μg) increased this activity to ∼140-fold, or by 2-fold over that without SRC-1 (compare the second and sixth bars). IL-6 (50 ng/ml) induced the PSA (6.1 kb)-luciferase construct by ∼17-fold in the absence of androgen (Fig. 1 B). Cotransfection of the SRC-1 expression plasmid (0.2 μg) increased this activity to ∼38-fold, or again by ∼2-fold over that without SRC-1 (compare thesecond and sixth bars). Basal activity was not altered by enhanced levels of SRC-1 (first,third, and fifth bars). The second ARE-driven reporter used was ARR3-tk-luciferase, which is an artificial reporter construct that contains three tandem repeats of the rat probasin ARE1 and ARE2 regions upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter (31Snoek R. Rennie P.S. Kasper S. Matusik R.J. Bruchovsky N. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 59: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Similar to previous reports (8Ueda T. Bruchovsky N. Sadar M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7076-7085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), this promoter was highly inducible by R1881 and, in the absence of ectopic SRC-1, was induced by ∼3000-fold (Fig. 1 C, second bar). In the presence of ectopic SRC-1 (0.2 μg), R1881 induced this reporter by ∼8000-fold (sixth bar). Consistent with previous reports, IL-6 induction of this reporter was poor in comparison with that achieved with R1881, and only a 6-fold induction was achieved in the absence of ectopic SRC-1 (Fig. 1 D,second bar), whereas an ∼11-fold induction was measured in the presence of ectopic SRC-1 (0.2 μg) (sixth bar). Thus, ectopic SRC-1 enhances both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent induction of ARE-driven reporters to a similar extent (2-fold), and these effects are not specific to one particular ARE-driven reporter gene construct. MAPK has been suggested to play an important role in androgen-independent prostate cancer (35Abreu-Martin M.T. Chari A. Palladino A.A. Craft N.A. Sawyers C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5143-5154Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 36Gioeli D. Mandell J.W. Petroni G.R. Frierson Jr., H.F. Weber M.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 279-284PubMed Google Scholar). MAPK also directly phosphorylates SRC-1 at Thr1179 and Ser1185(10Rowan B.G. Garrison N. Weigel N.L. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8720-8730Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). To provide insight into the role of MAPK in the enhanced induction of ARE-driven reporters by overexpression of SRC-1, we examined the PSA (6.1 kb)-luciferase reporter construct in LNCaP cells exposed to an inhibitor of MAPK (U0126). Inhibition of MAPK reduced the induction of PSA-luciferase by R1881 both in the presence and absence of ectopic SRC-1 (Fig. 2 A). Similarly, inhibition of MAPK reduced the induction of PSA-luciferase by IL-6 both in the presence and absence of ectopic SRC-1 (Fig.2 B). Inhibition of MAPK decreased both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent induction of PSA-luciferase activity in both the presence and absence of ectopic SRC-1. AR protein levels were not altered by treatment of cells with either IL-6 or U0126 (Fig. 2 C). AR protein levels were slightly increased in cells treated with R1881, which is consistent with previous reports that ligand stabilizes the AR protein (37Wilson E.M. French F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5620-5629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of LNCaP cells with dihydrotestosterone leads to a rapid and reversible activation of MAPK (38Peterziel H. Mink S. Schonert A. Becker M. Klocker H. Cato A.C.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6322-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). To test whether the MAPK pathway was being activated in our system with IL-6 and R1881, we performed Western blot analyses using antibodies that detect the phosphorylated MAPK isoforms p44 and p42. Western blot analyses showed that phosphorylation of isoforms p44 and p42 was maximum after 15 min of exposure of LNCaP cells to R1881 and IL-6 (Fig. 3,lanes 3 and 5). U0126 completely blocked the phosphorylation of MAPK in cells exposed to R1881 and IL-6 (comparelanes 3 and 4 and lanes 5 and6). Thus, phosphorylation of MAPK was increased in LNCaP cells treated with R1881 or IL-6. Recently, it was shown that MAPK phosphorylates SRC-1 at Thr1179 and Ser1185, which is required for optimal stimulation of both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent activation of the ectopic progesterone receptor in COS cells cotransfected with the GRE2-E1bCAT reporter construct (10Rowan B.G. Garrison N. Weigel N.L. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8720-8730Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). To date, this has not been explored with the AR in the context of ligand-dependent or ligand-independent activation. Therefore, to determine whether phosphorylation of SRC-1 by MAPK is required for androgen-independent induction of PSA by IL-6 via ligand-independent activation of the AR, mutant SRC-1 was compared with wild-type SRC-1 in LNCaP cells. The results presented in Fig.4 show that mutation of Thr1179 and Ser1185 of SRC-1 to alanines (T1179A/S1185A) reduced IL-6 induction of PSA-luciferase activity to a level comparable to that achieved in the absence of ectopic expression of wild-type SRC-1 (compare bars 4 and2). Mutation of Thr1179 and Ser1185of SRC-1 to glutamic acids (T1179E/S1185E) restored SRC-1-enhanced induction of PSA-luciferase activity by IL-6 to a level comparable to that achieved with wild-type SRC-1 (compare bars 5 and3). Alanine mutations mimic a loss of phosphorylation, whereas glutamic acid mutations maintain a negative charge to mimic phosphorylation (10Rowan B.G. Garrison N. Weigel N.L. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8720-8730Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Thus, optimal ligand-independent activation of the AR and induction of PSA-luciferase activity by IL-6 require phosphorylation of SRC-1 at Thr1179 and Ser1185. IL-6 activates the AR NTD (8Ueda T. Bruchovsky N. Sadar M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7076-7085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), and SRC-1 interacts directly with the AR NTD in a ligand-independent manner (11Bevan C.L. Hoare S. Claessens F. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8383-8392Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 12Ma H. Hong H. Huang S.-H. Irvine R.A. Webb P. Kushner P.J. Coetzee G.A. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6164-6173Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to determine whether SRC-1a would enhance activation of the AR NTD by IL-6. To do this, the yeast Gal4 system was employed using a chimeric construct of the AR NTD (amino acids 1–558) fused to the Gal4 DBD (AR-(1–558)-Gal4 DBD) (7Sadar M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7777-7783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 8Ueda T. Bruchovsky N. Sadar M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7076-7085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). LNCaP cells were cotransfected with the expression vector encoding the Gal4 DBD, AR-(1–558)-Gal4 DBD, SRC-1, and a reporter gene containing the Gal4-binding site (p5×Gal4UAS-TATA-luciferase). As shown in Fig.5 A, IL-6 had a slight effect on the activation of Gal4-luciferase activity in cells expressing only the Gal4 DBD (bars 1–6) with or without ectopic SRC-1. IL-6 induction of the Gal4 reporter activity in cells expressing the AR-(1–558)-Gal4 DBD protein was greatly enhanced by increased expression of SRC-1 (compare bars 8 and 12). These results show that SRC-1 is required for optimal activation of the AR NTD by IL-6. To test the effects of MAPK on the activation of the AR NTD by IL-6 in the presence of ectopic SRC-1, the MEK inhibitor U0126 was employed (Fig. 5 B). U0126 had negligible effects upon basal transactivation of AR-(1–558)-Gal4 DBD (compare bars 9 and10). In the presence of IL-6, U0126 reduced the Gal4 reporter activity both in the presence (compare bars 15 and16) and absence (compare bars 13 and14) of cotransfected SRC-1. The levels of AR-(1–558)-Gal4 DBD fusion protein were consistent in cells treated with R1881, IL-6, and U0126 (Fig. 5 C). These results suggest that activation of the AR NTD by IL-6 in the absence and presence of ectopic SRC-1 is dependent upon the MAPK pathway. To determine the role of MAPK phosphorylation of SRC-1 in ligand-independent transactivation of the AR NTD by IL-6, we compared wild-type SRC-1 with the mutant forms (T1179A/S1185A and T1179E/S1185E) using the Gal4 system. The results presented in Fig.6 show that when Thr1179 and Ser1185 of SRC-1 were mutated to alanines (T1179A/S1185A), SRC-1 failed to increase activation of the AR NTD by IL-6 to the level obtained with ectopic wild-type SRC-1 (compare bars 7 and6). These mutations in SRC-1 reduced activation of the AR NTD to levels obtained without ectopic expression of wild-type SRC-1 in the presence of IL-6 (compare bars 7 and 5). The T1179E/S1185E mutation restored the synergistic activity of the AR NTD in the presence of IL-6 to a level comparable to that obtained using wild-type SRC-1 (compare bars 8 and 6). Thus, optimal ligand-independent activation of the AR NTD by IL-6 requires phosphorylation of SRC-1 at Thr1179 and Ser1185. Note that in the absence of IL-6, mutation of Thr1179 and Ser1185 to glutamic acids had no effect on the AR NTD (bar 4), nor did wild-type SRC-1 have any effect without IL-6 (bar 2). This suggests that activation of the AR NTD requires more than solely phosphorylation or enhanced levels of SRC-1. To date, all studies examining SRC-1 interaction with the AR have failed to examine the endogenous proteins in whole cells. Thus, interaction between SRC-1 and AR was investigated using endog"
https://openalex.org/W2043241957,"Recordings of event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related magnetic fields (ERMFs) were combined with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study visual cortical activity in humans during spatial attention. While subjects attended selectively to stimulus arrays in one visual field, fMRI revealed stimulus-related activations in the contralateral primary visual cortex and in multiple extrastriate areas. ERP and ERMF recordings showed that attention did not affect the initial evoked response at 60–90 ms poststimulus that was localized to primary cortex, but a similarly localized late response at 140–250 ms was enhanced to attended stimuli. These findings provide evidence that the primary visual cortex participates in the selective processing of attended stimuli by means of delayed feedback from higher visual-cortical areas."
https://openalex.org/W2046952556,"An important aspect of synapse development is the clustering of neurotransmitter receptors in the postsynaptic membrane. Although MuSK is required for acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We report here that in muscle cells, MuSK interacts with Dishevelled (Dvl), a signaling molecule important for planar cell polarity. Disruption of the MuSK-Dvl interaction inhibits Agrin- and neuron-induced AChR clustering. Expression of dominant-negative Dvl1 in postsynaptic muscle cells reduces the amplitude of spontaneous synaptic currents at the NMJ. Moreover, Dvl1 interacts with downstream kinase PAK1. Agrin activates PAK, and this activation requires Dvl. Inhibition of PAK1 activity attenuates AChR clustering. These results demonstrate important roles of Dvl and PAK in Agrin/MuSK-induced AChR clustering and reveal a novel function of Dvl in synapse development."
https://openalex.org/W2062234159,"Diffusion of glutamate from the synaptic cleft can activate high-affinity receptors, but is not thought to contribute to fast AMPA receptor-mediated transmission. Here, we show that single AMPA receptor EPSCs at the cerebellar mossy fiber-granule cell connection are mediated by both direct release of glutamate and rapid diffusion of glutamate from neighboring synapses. Immunogold localization revealed that AMPA receptors are located exclusively in postsynaptic densities, indicating that spillover of glutamate occurs between synaptic contacts. Spillover currents contributed half the synaptic charge and exhibited little trial-to-trial variability. We propose that spillover of glutamate improves transmission efficacy by both increasing the amplitude and duration of the EPSP and reducing fluctuations arising from the probabilistic nature of transmitter release."

The increase in heart weight is largely attributed to the enlargement of myocytes, and there is almost a 3-fold increase in cardiac myocyte diameter in humans during development from infants to adults (2Rakusan K. Zak R. Growth of the Heart in Health and Disease. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1984: 131-164Google Scholar). This process of physiological hypertrophy is proposed to be similar to the heart growth observed in athletes who participate in endurance training (3Shephard R.J. Shephard R.J. Miller H.S. Exercise and the Heart in Health and Disease. 2nd Ed. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 223-237Google Scholar) and distinct from the pathological forms of hypertrophy that occur in patients with hypertension or valvular heart disease (4Hudlicka O. Brown M.D. J. Vasc. Res. 1996; 33: 266-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Heart size is also highly responsive to the nutritional state. Heart weight and myocyte fiber size is reduced in starved subjects (5Keys A. Brozek J. Henschel A. Mickelsen O. Taylor H.L. The Biology of Human Starvation. University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, MN1950Crossref Google Scholar) and in individuals on severe weight loss diets (6Isner J.M. Sours H.E. Paris A.L. Ferrans V.J. Roberts W.C. Circulation. 1979; 60: 1401-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Heart size is markedly reduced in patients with anorexia nervosa (7de Simone G. Scalfi L. Galderisi M. Celentano A., Di Biase G. Tammaro P. Garofalo M. Mureddu G.F. de Divitiis O. Contaldo F. Br. Heart J. 1994; 71: 287-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and modest weight reduction in normotensive obese subjects is associated with reduced heart size in the absence of changes in blood pressure or other hemodynamic parameters (8Himeno E. Nishino K. Nakashima Y. Kuroiwa A. Ikeda M. Am. Heart J. 1996; 131: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Conversely, heart size is increased in obese subjects without hypertension or other cardiovascular and/or metabolic abnormalities (9Crisostomo L.L. Araujo L.M. Camara E. Carvalho C. Silva F.A. Vieira M. Rabelo Jr., A. Am. J. Cardiol. 1999; 84: 1127-1129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that mechanisms exist that couple heart size to nutrient-dependent changes in body size (10McMahon T. Science. 1973; 179: 1201-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). However, compared with our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms that contribute to pathological hypertrophy (11MacLellan W.R. Schneider M.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar,12Molkentin J. Dorn I.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), little is known about the mechanisms that control normal cardiac myocyte growth or how these processes are coordinated with overall changes in the nutritional status of the organism. One of the potential mediators of intrinsic responses to the nutritional state is insulin. Insulin exerts a wide variety of biological actions including regulation of glucose metabolism and protein synthesis (13Kahn C.R. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1066-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 14Proud C.G. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). After activation by insulin, the insulin receptor (IR)1 phosphorylates a number of cellular substrates, leading to the activation of multiple downstream signaling pathways (15White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Virkamaki A. Ueki K. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Most notable is the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, which mediates a wide variety of biological actions of insulin (17Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Akt is one of the major downstream effectors of PI3K and has been implicated in the regulation of protein synthesis at least in part through the indirect regulatory phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1) and ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) (18Downward J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar, 19Shah O.J. Anthony J.C. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E715-E729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and insulin was previously shown to stimulate global protein synthesis in the heart (20Sugden P.H. Fuller S.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 21-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Although these findings suggest that insulin positively regulates cardiac muscle growth through the PI3K-Akt pathway, the physiological role of insulin signaling in regulating postnatal heart growth has not been elucidated. The role of Akt signaling in the control of organ and cell size has been gaining considerable attention. Akt has been shown to be an important mediator of growth in Drosophila (21Verdu J. Buratovich M.A. Wilder E.L. Birnbaum M.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and mice (22Chen W.S., Xu, P.Z. Gottlob K. Chen M.L. Sokol K. Shiyanova T.

Recently, it has also been reported that heart size is increased in transgenic mice that express constitutively active forms of Akt from a cardiac-specific promoter (29Shioi T. McMullen J.R. Kang P.M. Douglas P.S. Obata T. Franke T.F. Cantley L.C. Izumo S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2799-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 30Matsui T., Li, L., Wu, J.C. Cook S.A. Nagoshi T.

However, overexpression of a kinase-deficient form of Akt did not reduce heart size (29Shioi T. McMullen J.R. Kang P.M. Douglas P.S. Obata T. Franke T.F. Cantley L.C. Izumo S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2799-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Therefore, although it is clear that overexpression of Akt can promote heart growth, the role of this signaling step in normal postnatal growth in response to insulin or nutritional status is not clear. In the present study, we examined the physiological role of Akt signaling during nutrient-dependent postnatal cardiac growth. Akt signaling in the heart was up-regulated during early postnatal developmental stage when the heart was rapidly growing and down-regulated by short term fasting, suggesting a role of Akt in regulating postnatal heart growth in response to nutritional status. Consistent with this notion, cardiac-specific IR knockout (CIRKO) mice, which have a small heart phenotype (31Belke D.D. Betuing S. Tuttle M.J. Graveleau C. Young M.E. Pham M. Zhang D. Cooksey R.C. McClain D.A. Litwin S.E. Taegtmeyer H. Severson D. Kahn C.R. Abel E.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), exhibited reductions in Akt, S6K1, and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in the heart, and caloric restriction had little effects on cardiac Akt activity in CIRKO mice. Expression of Akt1 induced cell hypertrophy and phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 in cultured cardiac myocytes, and expression of dominant-negative Akt1 inhibited insulin-induced phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Furthermore, ectopic expression of Akt1 in the hearts of CIRKO mice restored the phosphorylation of Akt, S6K1, and 4E-BP1 to the normal levels and rescued the small heart phenotype. These results collectively indicate that insulin-dependent postnatal heart growth is mediated by Akt signaling. This mechanism of regulatory control may account for how heart size is coordinated with overall body size during postnatal development and as the nutritional status of the organism is varied. For overnight fast, 6-week-old mice were deprived of food overnight. For insulin stimulation, 12-week-old wild type mice were starved overnight, and 1 mg/kg of body weight of insulin was injected from inferior vena cava. Hearts were harvested 5 min after insulin injection. CIRKO mice were generated and genotyped as described (31Belke D.D. Betuing S. Tuttle M.J. Graveleau C. Young M.E. Pham M. Zhang D. Cooksey R.C.

Myocytes were further cultured in serum-free media for 48 h and infected with adenovirus vectors at the indicated multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) for 2 h.

Polymerized actin fibers were visualized by TRITC-labeled phalloidin (Sigma). For cell surface area measurement, microscope images were analyzed with NIH Image analysis software. Ad-myrAkt1-infected cells were assessed 48 h after infection. Ad-Akt1AAA-infected cells were treated with vehicle or insulin 24 h after infection and assessed for cell surface area 48 h after insulin treatment. Ad-β-gal-infected cells were used as control. For analysis of protein synthesis, myocytes were cultured in 24-well plates, and [3H]leucine incorporation was measured. For Ad-myrAkt1-infected cells, [3H]leucine (1μCi/ml) was added 44 h after infection and incubated for an additional 4 h.

Adenovirus vectors were injected into the ventricles of newborn mice as described previously (36Christensen G. Minamisawa S. Gruber P.J. Wang Y. Chien K.R. Circulation. 2000; 101: 178-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) with 1 × 108 plaque-forming units of Ad-β-gal or Ad-myrAkt1 for each mouse. Animals were sacrificed at the age of 6 weeks old. Heart sections were prepared as described (34Fujio Y. Nguyen T. Wencker D. Kitsis R.N. Walsh K. Circulation. 2000; 101: 660-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar) and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Transverse diameter of myofibers was measured as previously described (37Kojima M. Shiojima I. Yamazaki T. Komuro I. Zou Z. Wang Y. Mizuno T. Ueki K. Tobe K. Kadowaki T. Nagai R. Yasaki Y. Circulation. 1994; 89: 2204-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Data are shown as the means ± S.E. of mean. All data were evaluated with a two-tailed, unpaired Student's t test or compared by one-way analysis of variance. To examine the regulation of Akt signaling during postnatal cardiac growth, Akt phosphorylation status was examined in hearts of mice harvested at 6 weeks of age, when animals are in a rapid growth phase, and at 12 weeks of age, when the heart grows more slowly and nears a plateau as it approaches its full adult size. The level of Akt phosphorylation was markedly higher in the hearts of 6-week-old mice than in the 12-week-old mice (Fig.1 A), indicating that Akt signaling is up-regulated in the postnatal heart under conditions of rapid growth. To gain insight about the upstream activator of Akt signaling, the effects of fasting on cardiac Akt activation was assessed in 6-week-old mice. Animals were deprived of food overnight, and Akt phosphorylation levels in the heart were compared with those of randomly fed mice of the same age. An overnight fast dramatically reduced the phosphorylation of Akt without changing total Akt expression level (Fig. 1 B). Fasting also reduced the phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 (Fig. 1 B), as shown by the increase in mobility on SDS-PAGE gel, consistent with diminished Akt signaling in the heart under these conditions. Because an overnight fast leads to the reduction of serum insulin concentration to the basal level (38Michael M.D. Kulkarni R.N. Postic C. Previs S.F. Shulman G.I. Magnuson M.A. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 87-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar), we speculated that insulin might be an upstream activator of cardiac Akt signaling. Supporting this notion, acute stimulation of mice with insulin resulted in a robust Akt phosphorylation in the heart (Fig. 1 C). These data indicate that cardiac Akt activity is regulated by the developmental stage and suggest that insulin may be one of the positive regulators of cardiac Akt signaling. Based on the preceding results, we attempted to examine Akt signaling in the heart of CIRKO mice, in which insulin receptor gene is disrupted specifically in cardiac muscle cells (31Belke D.D. Betuing S. Tuttle M.J. Graveleau C. Young M.E. Pham M. Zhang D. Cooksey R.C. McClain D.A. Litwin S.E. Taegtmeyer H. Severson D. Kahn C.R. Abel E.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Consistent with the previous report (31Belke D.D. Betuing S. Tuttle M.J. Graveleau C. Young M.E. Pham M. Zhang D. Cooksey R.C. McClain D.A. Litwin S.E. Taegtmeyer H. Severson D. Kahn C.R. Abel E.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), CIRKO mice displayed a small heart phenotype with heart weight/body weight ratio ∼20% smaller than those of wild type littermates at 6 weeks of age (Fig.2 A). Western blot analysis indicated a decrease in Akt signaling in the hearts of CIRKO mice. Akt phosphorylation was reduced in the hearts of 6-week-old CIRKO when compared with age-matched controls despite similar levels of total Akt protein (Fig. 2 B). Consistent with a decrease in Akt signaling, the phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 were also reduced. We also performed short term fasting experiments on CIRKO mice at 6 weeks old. In contrast to the dramatic down-regulation of cardiac Akt activity in wild type animals, overnight fasting had little effect on cardiac Akt phosphorylation in CIRKO animals (Fig. 2 C). Quantitative analysis of Akt phosphorylation levels indicated that the relative reduction of Akt phosphorylation by IR deletion and short term fasting were almost identical (Fig. 2 D), suggesting that decreased insulin signaling plays a major role in the reduction of cardiac Akt activity induced by short term fasting. Taken together, these results suggest the possibility that insulin-dependent cardiac growth is mediated by Akt signaling in the heart. The role of Akt signaling in insulin-dependent heart growth was investigated in cultured cardiac myocytes in vitro. Myocytes were infected with control virus (Ad-β-gal) or adenovirus expressing a dominant-negative mutant of Akt1 (Ad-Akt1AAA) and stimulated with insulin 24 h after infection. The insulin-induced increase in cell surface area and [3H]leucine incorporation were reduced by the expression of dominant-negative Akt1 (Fig. 3,A and B), and these effects on cell size and protein synthesis were not observed when Akt1AA (in which Thr-308 and Ser-473 are converted to alanine) was used as a dominant-negative Akt mutant (data not shown). Insulin-induced phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 as well as S6K1 kinase activity were also partly reduced by Akt1AAA (Fig. 3 C). Inhibition of endogenous Akt by Akt1AAA was indicated by the attenuation of insulin-induced glycogen synthase kinase-3β phosphorylation. Because Akt is phosphorylated by phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) at Thr-308, it is possible that overexpression of Akt1AAA competitively interferes the regulatory phosphorylation of other PDK1 targets. However, insulin-induced phosphorylation of protein kinase Cδ, a direct substrate of PDK1 (39Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar), was not attenuated by Akt1AAA, suggesting that the effects of dominant-negative Akt1 overexpression is not because of nonspecific interference of PDK1. These results suggest that insulin promotes cardiomyocyte growth through Akt-dependent signaling, although Akt-independent regulation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation is indicated because the inhibition by dominant-negative Akt is partial. Because ablation of insulin receptor in the heart also disrupts insulin-dependent signaling other than PI3K-Akt pathway, it is possible that the lack of insulin-dependent but Akt-independent signaling pathways is the primary cause of small heart phenotype and down-regulation of Akt-dependent pathways is a para-phenomenon. To test whether the small heart phenotype of CIRKO mice is due to down-regulation of the IR-PI3K-Akt pathway, we examined whether this phenotype could be rescued by overexpressing Akt. Initially, we characterized the activities of an adenovirus vector expressing a constitutively active form of Akt1 (Ad-myrAkt1) in cultured cardiac myocytes. Overexpression of Akt1 induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy as evidenced by the increase in cell surface area (Fig.4, A and B) and [3H]leucine incorporation (Fig. 4 C) by 48 h post-transduction, consistent with a previous report (24Morisco C. Zebrowski D. Condorelli G. Tsichlis P. Vatner S.F. Sadoshima J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14466-14475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis revealed that the increased expression and phosphorylation of Akt is associated with an increase in phosphorylation levels of S6K1 and 4E-BP1, as shown by the decrease in mobility during SDS-PAGE, from as early as 4 h after transduction, when the activation status of Akt is still modest (Fig. 4 D). It has been reported that expression of constitutively active Akt1 transactivates the promoter of ANP gene in transient transfection assay (24Morisco C. Zebrowski D. Condorelli G. Tsichlis P. Vatner S.F. Sadoshima J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14466-14475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, induction of the endogenous ANP gene and the organization of sarcomere, which are generally associated with hypertrophic agonist-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (40Schaub M.C. Hefti M.A. Harder B.A. Eppenberger H.M. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 901-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), were not observed despite marked overexpression of Akt1 (Fig. 4, Eand F). Next, Ad-myrAkt1 was injected into the ventricles of 1-day-old CIRKO mice. This method enables efficient and long term transgene expression from adenoviral vectors in the heart (36Christensen G. Minamisawa S. Gruber P.J. Wang Y. Chien K.R. Circulation. 2000; 101: 178-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Indeed, the hemagglutinin-tagged myrAkt1 could be detected by Western blot analysis of Akt immunoprecipitates prepared from Ad-myrAkt1-injected CIRKO hearts at 6 weeks of age (Fig.5 A). Although this level of transgene expression did not appreciably increase total Akt levels, activation of this signaling step was clearly indicated by an increase in the level of phosphorylated Akt, boosting it to the level detected in wild type mice. Injection of Ad-myrAkt1 in the heart of CIRKO mice also reversed the down-regulation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, indicative of enhanced Akt signaling. The restoration of Akt activity in the hearts of Ad-myrAkt1-injected CIRKO mice significantly increased heart weight/body weight ratio when compared with Ad-β-gal-injected CIRKO mice and was comparable with that of wild type mice (Fig.5 B). Histological analysis of the heart indicated that the transverse diameter of myofibers is increased in Akt1-injected hearts to comparable levels with those of wild type animals (Fig. 5,C and D), suggesting that the increase in heart weight/body weight ratio induced by Akt1 overexpression is due to the hypertrophy of myocytes. Liver weights were also measured because it has previously been shown that transgene expression by this method is observed in this organ. Although there seems to be a slight increase in liver weight/body weight ratio in Akt-injected CIRKO mice compared with β-gal-injected CIRKO mice (liver weight (mg)/body weight (g) = 45.8 ± 2.3 (CIRKO) versus 48.6 ± 1.7 (CIRKO + Akt)), it was not statistically significant. Also, there was no difference in body weight between these two groups (body weight (g) = 19.5 ± 0.43 (CIRKO) versus 19.9 ± 0.22 (CIRKO + Akt)). Thus, the effects of adenovirus dissemination on other organs appear to be minimal, suggesting that the contribution of peripheral effects on heart size in Akt1-injected CIRKO mice is very small, if any. Altogether, these results support the hypothesis that the small heart phenotype of CIRKO mice is mediated by down-regulation of the IR-PI3K-Akt pathway in the heart. Body size and organ growth is tightly coupled in multicellular organisms. Studies in Drosophila have implicated members of the insulin signaling pathway, such as the IR, insulin receptor substrate, PI3K, Akt, and S6K, in the regulation of organ growth and body size (21Verdu J. Buratovich M.A. Wilder E.L. Birnbaum M.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 41Weinkove D. Leevers S.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The role of this pathway in vertebrate growth control is indicated by the growth retardation observed after targeted disruption of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, IGF-II, type1 IGF receptor, insulin receptor substrate-1, Akt1, or S6K1 in mice (22Chen W.S., Xu, P.Z.

In vitro stripe assays show that dorsal retinal axons prefer to grow on EphB receptor stripes supporting an attractive guidance mechanism. In vivo disruption of EphB/ephrin-B function by application of exogenous EphB or expression of dominant-negative ephrin-B ligand in dorsal retinal axons causes these axons to shift dorsally in the tectum, while misexpression of wild-type ephrin-B in ventral axons causes them to shift ventrally. These dorsoventral targeting errors are consistent with the hypothesis that an attractive mechanism that requires ephrin-B cytoplasmic domain is critical for retinotectal mapping in this axis."

We have studied cellular uptake of macromolecular polyanions,i.e. DNA and glycosaminoglycans, and a polybasic HIV-Tat derived peptide (GRKKRRQRRRPPQC) using fluorescence assisted cell sorting and confocal fluorescence microscopy. The transactivator of HIV transcription (Tat) peptide stimulated cellular uptake of both DNA and heparan sulfate in a time-, concentration-, and temperature-dependent manner. Peptide-polyanion complexes accumulated in large, acidic, cytoplasmic vesicles formed de novo. This was followed by transfer of polyanion into the nuclear compartment and subsequent disappearance of the endolysosomal vesicles. In the absence of polyanion the Tat peptide displayed rapid accumulation in the nuclear compartment. However, in the presence of polyanion the peptide was almost exclusively retained in cytoplasmic vesicles. Cell-surface proteoglycans played a pivotal role in the uptake of complexes exhibiting a relatively high peptide to polyanion ratio, corresponding to a net positive charge of the complexes. Uptake of polyanions per se or complexes with a relatively low peptide to polyanion ratio was favored by proteoglycan deficiency in the recipient cells, indicating the existence of distinct transport mechanisms. Moreover, expression of full-length HIV-Tat as well as exogenous addition of HIV-Tat peptide resulted in cellular accumulation of endogenous proteoglycans.

Advances in the molecular biology field have resulted in the development of novel therapeutic strategies, e.g. gene therapy and cellular protein delivery, which must rely on the entry of large, polyvalent molecules into the intracellular compartment. Although internalization of DNA has been demonstrated in various cell lines and tissues, it is a relatively inefficient and potentially cytotoxic process (1Wolff J.A. Malone R.W. Williams P. Chong W.

Investig. 1996; 97: 2911-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Thus, substantial efforts should be focused on mechanistic studies of macromolecular membrane passage, which then form a basis for the construction of novel DNA and protein delivery vehicles. Recently, two major classes of membrane-penetrating proteins have been identified, i.e. arginine/lysine-rich peptides and peptides containing the hydrophobic core region (h region) of signal peptides (see Refs. 3Derossi D. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 84-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 4Hawiger J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar for review). Viral proteins, e.g. VP22 and Tat (transactivator of HIV transcription) from herpes simplex and HIV,1 respectively, contain protein transduction domains (PTD) that have been utilized for cellular delivery of fusion proteins or chemically cross-linked cargoes,e.g. the PTD of HIV-Tat displayed on the surface of λ particles facilitated transfer of phage-encapsulated marker genes into mammalian cells (5Eguchi A. Akuta T. Okuyama H. Senda T. Yokoi H. Inokuchi H. Fujita S. Hayakawa T. Takeda K. Hasegawa M. Nakanishi M. J. Biol.

Notably, virtually all cell types display efficient uptake of PTD fusion proteins, suggesting a ubiquitous transport pathway (7Schwarze S.R., Ho, A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (2198) Google Scholar). In AIDS pathology, HIV-infected cells can secrete Tat, which then enters surrounding cells and activates HIV-1 gene expression through a specific interaction with the viral TAR RNA target sequence. In this way Tat can stimulate a very high level of viral gene expression and replication (8Green M. Loewenstein P.M.

More recently a role for cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) in cellular uptake of a recombinant GST-Tat-GFP fusion protein was shown by the same group (14Tyagi M. Rusnati M. Presta M. Giacca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3254-3261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). PG encompasses a heterogeneous group of proteins substituted with long linear polysulfated, and thereby highly negatively charged, polymers named glycosaminoglycans (GAG) (see Refs. 15Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 16Bernfield M. Götte M. Park P.-W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev.

The GAG chains, e.g. chondroitin sulfate (CS), dermatan sulfate (DS), and HS, consist of a common linkage region, GlcA-Gal-Gal-Xyl, where a glycosidic linkage is formed between the xylose residue of the GAG chain and a serine from the core protein. The linkage region is then extended with repeating disaccharides consisting of either GlcA-β-GalNAc or GlcA-α-GlcNAc. The final PG is formed after complex modifications including sulfation reactions, which render the molecule anionic in its character. Because of their size and polyanionic character, GAG chains may serve as attachment sites for a vast number of polybasic compounds. Cell-surface PG are selective regulators of ligand-receptor encounters (see Ref. 18Park P.W. Reizes O. Bernfield M. J. Biol.

Moreover, we and others have presented data indicating a role for PG in cationic lipid-mediated gene delivery (26Mislick K.A. Baldeschwieler J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The present study investigates nuclear targeting of polyanionic macromolecules by an HIV-Tat derived peptide in mammalian cells and the potential role for cell-surface PG in these processes. The HIV-Tat derived peptide (HTDP) (amino acid 48–60 plus a C-terminal cysteinamide, GRKKRRQRRRPPQC-amide) and Texas red-labeled HTDP were from Innovagen AB, Lund, Sweden. Peptide sequences were confirmed by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. pcDNA3HIV-Tat-GFP plasmid was generously provided by Dr. Berkhout, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

LipofectAMINE reagent was from Invitrogen. Rhodamine (Molecular Probes) green- and red-labeled HS and DS were prepared as described (30Cheng F. Petersson P. Arroyo-Yanguas Y. Westergren-Thorsson G.

LysoTracker red DND-99 was from Molecular Probes, and Rhodamine red-labeled DNA plasmid was from Gene Therapy Systems Inc., United States. Na235SO4 (1310 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Chondroitin ABC lyase (chondroitinase ABC, EC 4.2.2.4) and heparitinase (alias heparinase III) were from Seikagaku Inc., Japan. PD-10, Superose 6 HR 10/30 and MonoQ HR 5/5 columns were all obtained from Amersham Biosciences, Sweden. Paraformaldehyde, bovine serum albumin, human placenta DNA, and all fine chemicals were from Sigma. CHO-K1, pgsA-745 (XT-def), pgsB-618, and human embryonic lung fibroblast (HFL-1) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. CHO cells were routinely cultured in F12K nutrient mixture supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (growth medium) in a humidified 5% CO2, 37 °C incubator. HFL-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with the same supplements as above. Fluorophore-labeled DNA plasmid, HS, or DS was pre-incubated with HTDP at different concentrations in F12K for 30 min at room temperature. The mixture was then added to extensively rinsed subconfluent cell layers in 24-well plates, and the incubation was allowed to proceed for various periods of time at 37 °C, or in some cases 4 °C. After removal of incubation medium cells were treated with trypsin followed by extensive washing with ice-cold PBS 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin to remove unspecific extracellular fluorophore. The cells were finally suspended in 0.5 ml PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin and analyzed for fluorescence in a FACS-Calibur (BD Biosciences) instrument integrated with PC-compatible Cell-Quest software. Cells were seeded at low density in 4-well chamber slides and allowed to adhere over night. After extensive rinsing with PBS, cells were incubated with polyanions and/or HTDP for time periods and at concentrations as indicated in the respective figure legends. Cells were then separated from unspecific extracellular fluorophore by either of the following methods: 1) trypsin treatment, followed by consecutive rinsing in PBS 1% bovine serum albumin, and re-seeding on chamber slides in growth medium for 4–6 h; or 2) brief rinsing with 2 × 1 ml 2 m NaCl in PBS followed by rinsing with 3 × 1 ml PBS. In both cases cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. After fixation slides were washed with 2 × 1 ml PBS and 2 × 1 ml distilled water, and then air dried. LysoTracker red DND-99, which is able to enter the intracellular compartment and emits light in a pH-dependent manner, was present during the last 2 h of incubation. Cells were visualized using a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope and a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal laser scanning microscopy system. Collected data was analyzed using PC-compatible Laser-Sharp software. Cells were plated in 24-well plates at 1 × 105 cells per well in 0.5 ml growth medium 24 h before transfection. To prepare HTDP-DNA complexes, pGL3-luciferase plasmid DNA (10 μg/ml) and the desired amount of HTDP (5–80 μg/ml) were mixed by inversion and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The DNA-peptide mixture was then added to cells that had been rinsed twice with F12K. At the end of the 14-h incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the medium was aspirated and replaced with 0.5 ml of growth medium. After an additional period of incubation for 36 h, cells were washed twice with PBS and treated with 150 μl of cell lysis reagent containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 2 mm CDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100 (Promega, Sweden) for 10 min at 4 °C followed by scraping. Luciferase expression was quantified in 25 μl of the cell lysate supernatant using a luciferase assay kit. Light emission was measured by integration over 15 s at 25 °C using BMG Fluostar Optima equipment. CHO-K1 cells were treated with chlorate, chondroitin ABC, and heparitinase, essentially as described previously (24Belting M. Persson S. Fransson L.-Å. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell layers were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 0.5 ml of the digestion buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5% bovine serum albumin) containing 0.6 milli-units of heparitinase or 25 milli-units of chondroitin ABC lyase. Another aliquot of heparitinase or ABC lyase was then added to bring the concentration to 4.8 milli-units/ml and 200 milli-units/ml, respectively, and the incubation was allowed to proceed for another 2 h. Following the removal of cell-associated GAG, cells were rinsed extensively with 0.5 ml of the digestion buffer, and Tat peptide-polyanion internalization was determined by FACS according to the usual protocol. For chlorate treatment, cells were incubated for 24 h with NaCl-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 supplemented with 25 mmNaClO3 and appropriate amounts of NaCl to obtain physiological ionic strength. After extensive washing, Tat peptide-polyanion uptake was determined by FACS. Subconfluent cells were labeled with Na235SO4 (100 μCi/ml) in 8 ml of fresh F12K medium for 24 h. The medium was then aspirated, and cell layers were washed extensively with PBS to remove free isotope. This was followed by another incubation period of 48 h in 10 ml of fresh F12K. Conditioned medium (CM) was aspirated and subjected to centrifugation at 300 × g to remove cell debris. CM was pre-incubated for 30 min at room temperature with or without 100 μg/ml HTDP and then added to fresh cells for a period of 4 h, at 37 °C. Cell medium was re-isolated, centrifuged to remove cell debris, and supplemented with 1 mm di-isopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). After extensive rinsing in PBS, cell layers were extracted with 2.5 ml of 2% Triton X-100 (v/v) in PBS containing 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm NEM, and 1 mm DFP for 15 min at 4 °C. [35S]sulfate-labeled material was analyzed by gel chromatography on Superose 6 and Mono-Q as described (28Belting M. Petersson P. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Alternatively, confluent cell cultures were labeled with [35S]sulfate (100 μCi/ml), either with or without 100 μg/ml HTDP for 24 h, at 37 °C. Polyanion material was isolated by ion-exchange chromatography, desalted on PD-10, and then further processed as described above. Transfections with Lipofectamine were performed according to the instructions by the manufacturer. Cells were then incubated for another 40 h, followed by radio labeling with 100 μCi/ml [35S]sulfate for 24 h at 37 °C and then further analyzed as described above. [35S]sulfate-labeled material was subject to enzymatic cleavage by chondroitin ABC lyase overnight at 37 °C in 0.1 m Tris-HOAc, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.3, or by chemical depolymerization of HS with nitrous acid, pH 1.5, for 10 min followed by neutralization with 2 mNa2CO3 as described (31Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3943-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Samples were then subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 20–30% gradient gel as described (23Belting M. Havsmark B. Jönsson M. Persson S. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The gel was visualized using a Fuji imaging system. Each data point in the dose activity and time course experiments is the mean ± S.D. (n= 4–6) from two separate experiments. In some cases the error bars were smaller than the drawn symbols. Confocal fluorescence microscopy and FACS figures are representative of five or more separate experiments. To investigate macromolecular membrane transport in cultured cells, we used fluorophore-tagged GAG (HS-Rhodamine green), DNA (DNA plasmid-Rhodamine red), and HTDP with the following structure: GRKKRRQRRRPPQC-Texas red. The peptide, which contains 6 arginine and 2 lysine residues, corresponds to the PTD of HIV-Tat. Initial experiments investigated if HTDP could mediate cellular entry of DNA plasmid (approximately 5 kb) and HS (approximately 15 kDa). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were incubated with polyanion with or without HTDP and analyzed by FACS. Addition of HTDP resulted in a 32- to 43-fold increase in macromolecular polyanion uptake (cf. Fig. 1, A and B). Reciprocal inhibition of HTDP-mediated uptake of HS and DNA was demonstrated, indicating a common uptake mechanism of HTDP/DNA and HTDP/HS complexes (Fig. 1, C and D). We next employed confocal fluorescence microscopy to study intracellular routing of peptide-polyanion complexes. At both time points (2 and 24 h), uptake of free HS was below the detection limit (cf. Fig. 2,A and F). HTDP displayed nuclear accumulation already at an early time point (Fig. 2 B) and was still present at 24 h (Fig. 2 G). In the presence of HTDP, HS chains initially accumulated in vesicular, cytoplasm-located compartments (Fig. 2 C) and were then further transported to the nucleus (Fig. 2 H). Employing a luciferase reporter gene assay it was demonstrated that HTDP caused a dose-dependent and dramatic increase in luciferase activity (up to 3000-fold) as compared with DNA plasmid alone, suggesting that HTDP delivers intact DNA plasmid to the nuclear compartment of recipient cells (results not shown). The polyanion-containing vesicles were dense and displayed considerable size heterogeneity upon inspection of refracted light images, both in CHO cells and human lung fibroblasts (results not shown). Interestingly, in the presence of HS HTDP was redistributed from the nucleus to cytoplasmic vesicles, both at an early (cf. Fig. 2, B and D) and late (cf. Fig. 2, G and I) time point. This was confirmed by merged confocal images, clearly demonstrating co-localization of HTDP and HS in vesicular structures (yellow in Fig. 2, E and J) and at a later time point a predominating signal from HS in the nucleus (green in Fig. 2 J). From these results we conclude that exogenously added HTDP and HS or DNA are co-transferred to cytoplasmic vesicles formed de novo, that HTDP targets HS and DNA to the nucleus, and that macromolecular polyanions do not preclude cellular uptake of the HIV-Tat transduction domain, but rather abrogate nuclear localization of the peptide. To further characterize the nature of cytoplasmic vesicles formedde novo upon exposure to HTDP-polyanion complexes, a pH-sensitive probe was employed, i.e. a fluorophore that emits light only at acidic conditions. In our hands acidic compartments were diffusely distributed with a faint pH-probe signal in untreated cells (Fig. 3, A andD). However, upon addition of HTDP-HS complexes large vesicular structures with a strong signal from the pH-probe appeared already at 2 h, indicating rapid acidification of these compartments (Fig. 3 B). Localization of polyelectrolyte complexes to these acidic compartments, which conceivably correspond to late endosomes/lysosomes, was demonstrated by the merged confocal images (Fig. 3 C). After 24 h of incubation, localization of polyelectrolyte complexes to acidic vesicles was still evident, and release of HS into the nucleus had begun (greenin Fig. 3 F). The formation of lysosomal vesicles was a reversible phenomenon, as indicated by the disappearance of Lysotracker staining upon exit of the polyelectrolyte complexes (results not shown). There seems to be no consensus as to whether HIV-Tat and its PTD enter cells via endocytosis or by alternative pathways, as both temperature-dependent (32Mann D.A. Frankel A.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1733-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 33Liu Y. Jones M. Hingtgen C.M., Bu, G. Laribee N. Tanzi R.E. Moir R.D. Nath A. He J.J. Nat.

Employing quantitative FACS methodology, it was revealed that internalization of HTDP-polyanion complexes is a concentration- and time-dependent event (Fig. 4,A and B, filled symbols) and that uptake was insignificant at 4 °C (data not shown). Altogether our results indicate that HTDP mediates DNA and HS uptake into endolysosomal vesicles via a saturable and temperature-dependent pathway, consistent with endocytosis. Similar results were obtained with human fibroblasts, COS cells, and a bladder carcinoma cell line (data not shown). Based on previous observations, indicating a role for cell-surface PG in cellular transport of polybasic compounds, e.g.polyamines (24Belting M. Persson S. Fransson L.-Å. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 25Belting M. Borsig L. Fuster M.M. Brown J.R. Persson L. Fransson L.-Å. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 3254-3261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar), an involvement of PG in HTDP-polyanion complex uptake may be hypothesized. To study the possible role for cell-surface PG in HTDP-mediated macromolecular internalization, the following experiments were performed with wild-type and mutant CHO cells deficient in xylosyl transferase (XT-def). XT catalyzes the first step in PG assembly, i.e.the linkage of xylose to specific serine residues in the core protein. XT-def cells express ∼5% PG as compared with wild-type cells (35Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3197-31201Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 A (inset), uptake of complexes with a relatively low peptide to polyanion ratio (approx. 1:2 w/w) was favored by PG-deficiency in the recipient cells. Upon increased HTDP to polyanion ratios (approx. 2:1 w/w), complex uptake was reduced to baseline levels in XT-def cells, whereas uptake was dramatically enhanced in wild-type cells (Fig. 4 A). The inability of PG-deficient cells to internalize HTDP-polyanion complexes under these conditions was independent of mutant genotype as another strain, pgsB-618, that expresses approximately 10% PG as compared with wild-type cells (35Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3197-31201Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), also exhibited insignificant complex uptake (Table I). Furthermore, pretreatment of wild-type cells with chlorate, which inhibits GAG sulfation, resulted in dramatically decreased complex uptake (Table I). Previous studies have described specific binding of full-length HIV-Tat to HS and very limited binding to galactosaminoglycans (11Rusnati M. Coltrini D. Oreste P. Zoppetti G. Albini A.

Interestingly, pretreatment of wild-type cells with either chondroitin ABC lyase to eliminate CS/DSPG or heparitinase to cleave HS chains significantly reduced complex uptake, indicating that HSPG as well as CS/DSPG participate in HTDP-mediated polyanion uptake in CHO cells (Table I). Altogether, the results presented in Fig. 4 and Table I show that the alteration in complex internalization was caused by a reduction of PG rather than any secondary mutations that may have occurred in the mutants.Table IHTPD-polyanion uptake is dependent on CS/DS- and HSPGUptake% of control ± S.D., n = 6Control100PgsB-6181-aStatistically different from Control, P < 0.05.1.0 ± 0.6Ch'ase ABC1-aStatistically different from Control, P < 0.05.63 ± 39Hep'ase1-aStatistically different from Control, P < 0.05.59 ± 8.6Chlorate1-aStatistically different from Control, P < 0.05.2.4 ± 0.9Uptake of Rhodamine green-labeled HS (20 μg/ml) in the presence of HTDP (40 μg/ml) for 4 h was determined in either untreated wild-type cells (Control), untreated PG-deficient mutant cells (pgsB-618), or wild-type cells pre-treated with chondroitin ABC lyase (Ch'ase ABC), or heparitinase (Hep'ase), or 25 mmchlorate (Chlorate), as described under Experimental Procedures.1-a Statistically different from Control, P < 0.05.

To identify its receptor, a genome-wide scan for G-protein-coupled receptors was performed in silico and candidate receptors identified by similarity to known tachykinin receptors. The deduced peptides were expressed, with a transgene for the calcium reporter aequorin, in S2 cells and only one gene (CG10626) encoded a protein that responded to Drosokinin. The properties of the heterologously expressed receptor (action through intracellular calcium with an EC50of 4 × 10−11m and at 12 <1 s) match closely those reported for the action of Drosokinin on Malpighian (renal) tubules. Antibodies raised against the receptor identified known sites of leucokinin action: stellate cells of the Malpighian tubule, two triplets of cells in thepars intercerebralis of the adult central nervous system, and additional cells in larval central nervous system. Western blots and reverse transcription-PCR confirmed these locations, but also identified expression in male and female gonads.

We have used this approach to identify a neuropeptide receptor implicated in renal function via a systematic scan of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)1 superfamily. The production of primary urine in the Malpighian tubules of insects is driven by the action of diuretic factors. The ability of these hormones and their receptors to regulate fluid and ion secretion make them attractive targets for novel insect control approaches. The insect myokinins, known as leucokinins, are one such group of neuropeptides. They were first isolated from the cockroach Leucophaea maderae as a family of small peptides that stimulated hindgut motility (2Holman G.M. Cook B.J. Wagner R.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol.

In Drosophila it has been shown that leucokinins act to stimulate fluid secretion by raising the chloride shunt conductance (16O'Donnell M.J. Rheault M.R. Davies S.A. Rosay P. Harvey B.J. Maddrell S.H. Kaiser K. Dow J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: R1039-R1049PubMed Google Scholar), not via cyclic nucleotide signaling but via an increase in intracellular calcium levels (7Terhzaz S.

Pollock V.P. Kean L. Davies S.A. Veenstra J.A. Dow J.A. J. Exp. Biol. 1999; 202: 3667-3676PubMed Google Scholar). No leucokinin receptors have been identified in insects, although a receptor for a distantly related peptide, that shares a FxSWxamide motif with Drosokinin, has been cloned from the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis, and was found to be a member of the GPCR superfamily (15Cox K.J. Tensen C.P. Van der Schors R.C., Li, K.W. van Heerikhuizen H. Vreugdenhil E. Geraerts W.P. Burke J.F. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1197-1205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A further leucokinin-like receptor has been cloned in the cattle tick Boophilus microplus, and this also displays the seven-transmembrane domain structure characteristic of GPCRs (18Holmes S.P. He H. Chen A.C. lvie G.W. Pietrantonio P.V. Insect Mol. Biol. 2000; 9: 457-465Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although a Drosophila gene has been identified as being similar to the lymnokinin receptor in silico (18Holmes S.P. He H. Chen A.C. lvie G.W. Pietrantonio P.V. Insect Mol.

Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1126-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), no functional evidence for its identification as a leucokinin receptor is available nor is the similarity between Drosophila andLymnaea leucokinins compelling (Table I). Accordingly, in this paper, we used a genome-wide scan to identify the clade of GPCRs that were most similar to receptors for tachykinins, including the lymnokinin receptor, and to assay them all systematically for activity. From this group a single gene, CG10626, was shown to encode a functional leucokinin receptor, with functional properties consistent with those observed in intact renal tubules and expression patterns that map closely to those predicted for such a receptor. This is the first functionally characterized example of an insect leucokinin receptor gene. Oregon R (wild-type) flies were reared in vials or bottles on standard Drosophila cornmeal yeast agar medium at 23 °C in a 12 h light:12 h dark cycle. Flies transgenic for the aequorin transgene, under control of the UAS promoter (UAS-aeq) enhancer trap line that directs GAL4 expression to secondary stellate cells (c710) and a heat-shock/GAL4 construct (hsGAL4), were those described previously (7Terhzaz S.

The Berkley Drosophila Genome Project data base (www.fruitfly.org) was searched with representative GPCR protein sequences and putative Drosophila GPCRs translated to protein sequences and used to verify the automated translations provided by the genome project, where available. Dendrograms were created in Clustal X (22Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J.

A further 200 μl of buffer was added, then incubated at 65 °C for 30 min. 800 μl of 1.4 m Kac, 4.3 m LiCl was added and incubated on ice for 10 min, followed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm. 1 ml of supernatant was transferred to a clean tube avoiding debris, and 600 μl of isopropyl alcohol added. This was mixed and spun for 15 min at 13,000 rpm. Supernatant was aspirated off and washed with 70% ethanol, spun again for 5 min, and the DNA pellet dried. The pellet was resuspended in 150 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), and 1 μl was used as template in PCR reactions. Tissue-specific poly(A)+ RNA was extracted (Dynal mRNA DIRECT kit) and reverse-transcribed with Superscript Plus (Invitrogen) as described previously (30Dow J.A. Maddrell S.H. Davies S.A. Skaer N.J. Kaiser K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: R1716-R1719PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of developmental stages, 5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA was reverse-transcribed directly with Superscript Plus using an oligo(dT) primer. 1 μl of the reverse transcription reaction was used as template for each PCR reaction; intron-spanning gene-specific primers were used for the amplification of cDNA or genomic DNA template. Forward primers (CATCGTCTGGTTTTGCTGCG) and backward primers (CCATTGACATTGTTGTTCTGCCC) were expected to generate a product of 360 bp with cDNA templates and 1 693 bp with genomic DNA template. Primers were used at 2.5 μm in a final volume of 25 μl, using the following cycle conditions: 94 °C for 3 min, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 15 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 5 min. Primers were designed for each candidate receptor to allow amplification from the start to the stop codons of each ORF. Forward primers were designed to include a 5′ Kozak translational initiation sequence (G/ANNATG G; Ref.44Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3598) Google Scholar). Amplification was carried out with EXPAND High Fidelity Polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to manufacturer's instructions. For amplification of theCG10626 ORF, forward (GACATGGACTTAATCGAGCAGGAG) and reverse (TTAAAGTGGTTGCCACAAGGAC) primers were used to generate a fragment of 1626 bp. Oregon R cDNA was used as template. For amplification of apo-aequorin ORF, forward (GCAAACATGACAAGCAAACAATAC) and reverse (TTAGGGGACAGCTCCACCGTAGAG) primers were used to generate a fragment of 597 bp. Genomic DNA from aequorin expressing flies (31Rosay P. Colas J.F. Maroteaux L. Mech. Dev. 1995; 51: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was used as template. PCR products were purified by gel extraction and directly cloned into the pMT-V5/His TOPO TA-inducible expression vector (Invitrogen). Constructs were verified by restriction enzyme digestion and automated sequencing. S2 cells were maintained in DES medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Cells were grown in suspension at 23 °C at an initial density of 2–4 × 106 cells/ml. S2 cells were transiently transfected at a density of 1 × 106cells/ml using a calcium phosphate transfection kit (Invitrogen); procedures were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were co-transfected with 10 μg of pMT-aeq (an expression vector containing an inducible apo-aequorin gene) and 10 μg of the relevant receptor expression construct. Cells were used 24 h post-induction. Aequorin is widely used as a transgenic reporter for calcium (32Knight M.R. Campbell A.K. Smith S.M. Trewavas A.J.

Transiently transfected S2 cells were harvested and incubated with 2.5 μm coelenterazine (Molecular Probes) in the dark at room temperature for 1 h. 25,000 cells were used per sample tube in DES medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The neuropeptides Drosokinin (NSVVLGKKQRFHSWGamide) (7Terhzaz S. O'Connell F.C. Pollock V.P. Kean L. Davies S.A. Veenstra J.A. Dow J.A. J. Exp.

Peptide was injected into each sample and the responses measured over a period of 4 min. At the end of each experiment the total luminescence of each sample was assessed by injecting 100 mm Ca2+, 1% Triton X-100 to permeabilize cells and so to discharge the remaining aequorin. Measurements were carried out with a Berthold-Wallac luminometer. Calcium concentrations were calculated as described previously (20Rosay P. Davies S.A., Yu, Y. Sozen A. Kaiser K. Dow J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1683-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by reverse integration with a program written in Perl and data analyzed using Excel (Microsoft) and Cricket Graph.

Tissues were dissected from adult (3–10 days old) flies or, in the case of larval central nervous system, from 3rd instar larvae. Tubules were dissected from c710 UAS-aeq flies. For other tissues, specific GAL4 driver lines were not available, and so aequorin was ubiquitously expressed under heat-shock control. Hindgut and larval central nervous system were dissected from hsGAL4 UAS-aeq flies/larvae that had been previously heat-shocked twice at 36 °C for 30 min at 24-h intervals. Either 80 tubules, 20 hindguts, or 10 larval central nervous systems were used per sample and incubated in Schneider's medium (Invitrogen) containing 2.5 μm co-elenterazine for 3 h. Drosokinin was diluted in Schneider's medium such that the final applied concentration was 10−7m. At the end of the experiment the total luminescence of each sample was assessed by injecting 100 mm Ca2+, 1% Triton X-100. Measurements were carried out with a Berthold-Wallac luminometer and calcium concentrations calculated as above. The putative CG10626 amino acid sequence was scanned for highly antigenic regions and a 14-amino acid segment identified (GIYNGSSGQNNNVN) contained within the C terminus of the protein sequence. This showed no significant similarity to any otherDrosophila sequences in the genome. An anti-peptide antibody was generated in rabbit by Genosphere Biotechnologies (Paris, France). Whole tubules were fixed, permeabilized, and stained as described previously (36MacPherson M.R. Pollock V.P. Broderick K.E. Kean L. O'Connell F.C. Dow J.A. Davies S.A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C394-C407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-CG10626 peptide antibody (see above) was used diluted 1:1000. Secondary antibody used was donkey fluorescein-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Diagnostics Scotland), used at 1:250 dilution. Coverslips were coated with poly-l-lysine solution (100 μg/ml) for 30 min, washed with water, and allowed to dry. S2 cells were added at a density of 6 × 106 cells/ml and left for 15 min to allow cells to settle and adhere. Excess solution was removed and the coverslips washed twice in PBS. Cells were fixed by the addition of methanol (−20 °C) and incubated for 4 min at −20 °C. Cells were washed three times in PBS and blocked in PBS/0.2% (w/v) BSA for 5 min. Cells were incubated for 25 min with rabbit polyclonal anti-CG10626 peptide antibody diluted 1:1000 in PBS/BSA. They were then washed three times in PBS/BSA and incubated for 25 min with donkey fluorescein-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibody diluted 1:400 in PBS/BSA. This was followed by three PBS/BSA washes and three final 5-min washes in PBS alone. Coverslips were then mounted on slides using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector) and a coverslip sealed on with glycerol-gelatin (Sigma). Slides were viewed by epifluorescence, using a fluorescein filter set. Adult or larval central nervous system was dissected and fixed in 8% paraformaldehyde for 20 min (adult) or 2 h (larval) at room temperature. They were washed six times in washing buffer (0.15m sodium phosphate, 0.1% w/v sodium azide, 0.5% v/v Triton X-100, pH 7.4), followed by blocking in blocking buffer (washing buffer, 10% v/v goat serum) for 2 h. Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit polyclonal anti-CG10626 peptide antibody diluted 1:1000 in blocking solution, washed for 2 h in washing buffer, and blocked again for 4 h. Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with either donkey fluorescein-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Diagnostics Scotland) or goat Texas Red-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Abcam), diluted 1:250 in blocking buffer. Samples were washed at room temperature for 1 h in washing buffer, followed by incubation for 15 min each in 20, 40, 60, and 80% glycerol in 0.04 msodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.4. Finally, tissues were mounted on a slide with Vectashield (Vector) and a coverslip sealed on with glycerol-gelatin (Sigma). Slides were viewed by epifluorescence, using fluorescein or rhodamine filter sets as appropriate. Protein samples were prepared from whole tissue by homogenization in Tris lysis buffer (70 mm Tris, 2% (w/v) SDS) with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma, P-8340). Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C to remove debris. Supernatant was removed to a clean tube. S2 cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 2 min, washed in PBS, pelleted again, and resuspended in cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Igepal CA-630 (Sigma)) with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma, P-8340). Cell lysates were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, vortexed, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min to remove cell debris. Supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Samples were run on SDS-PAGE and blotted according to standard methods. The filter was blocked for 3 h in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 and 10% nonfat dry milk and washed in PBS/Tween 20 once for 15 min then three times for 5 min. The filter was incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody diluted 1:1 000 in PBS/Tween 20/milk, then washed in PBS/Tween 20 once for 15 min and three times for 5 min, then incubated for 2 h with secondary antibody (1:2500 horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Amersham Biosciences)) diluted in PBS/Tween 20/milk. Final wash was in PBS for 3 h; protein bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL,Amersham Biosciences). 20 μg of either transfected S2 cell or tubule protein extract was denatured in 1 × denaturing buffer (0.5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol) at 100 °C for 10 min. 0.10 volume of 0.5m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5 at 25 °C, 10% Nonidet P-40, and 2500 units of peptide:N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs), an enzyme that removes N-glycosylation, were added and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. 15 μg of each sample was then analyzed by Western blotting. The LKR ORF was cloned into the pCR T7/NT TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen). The ORF was amplified using the same primers as for S2 cell expression. The construct was transformed into competent E. coli BL21/pLys cells. Single colonies were grown overnight in 5 ml of L broth, 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin, 34 μg ml−1 chloramphenicol at 37 °C. 5 ml of culture medium were seeded with 250 μl of overnight culture and grown to OD600 0.5–0.8 at 37 °C. The culture was then induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and grown at room temperature for 4 h. 1 ml of cells was pelleted (13,000 rpm, 1 min) and resuspended in 150 μl of lysis buffer (50 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 400 mm NaCl, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm imidazole). Cells were lysed by three cycles of freeze-thawing (freeze in liquid N2, thaw at 42 °C) and whole cell lysate analyzed on a SDS-PAGE gel. All GPCRs were identified in the D. melanogaster genome sequence by BLAST similarity searches with known GPCRs; putative translations were deduced and assembled into a dendrogram by sequence alignment (Clustal X (22Thompson J.D.

In Drosophila, Roundabout reaches high levels on axons once they have crossed the midline, and this prohibits recrossing. Roundabout protein levels are regulated by Commissureless. We show that Commissureless binds to and is regulated by the ubiquitin ligase DNedd4. We further show that the ability of Commissureless to regulate Roundabout protein levels requires an intact DNedd4 binding site and ubiquitin acceptor sites within the Commissureless protein. The ability of Commissureless to regulate Robo in the embryo also requires a Commissureless/DNedd4 interaction. Our results show that changes in axonal sensitivity to external cues during pathfinding across the midline makes use of ubiquitin-dependent mechanisms to regulate transmembrane protein levels."

NmtR binds to the operator-promoter of a gene encoding a P1 type ATPase (NmtA), repressing transcription in vivo except in medium supplemented with nickel or, to some extent, cobalt. In a cyanobacterial host, Synechococcus PCC 7942 strain R2-PIM8(smt), NmtR-mediated repression is alleviated by cobalt but not nickel or zinc addition, while the related sensor SmtB responds exclusively to zinc. Quantification of the number of atoms of nickel per cell shows that NmtR nickel sensitivity correlates with cytosolic nickel contents. Differential metal discrimination in a common cytosol by SmtB (zinc) and NmtR (cobalt) is not simply explained by affinities at equilibrium; although NmtR does bind nickel substantially more tightly than SmtB, it has a higher affinity for zinc than for cobalt and binds cobalt more weakly than SmtB. SmtB is known to bind and sense zinc at interhelical four-coordinate, tetrahedral sites across the C-terminal α5 helices, while absorption spectroscopy of Co(II)- and Ni(II)-substituted NmtR reveals five- and six-coordinate metal complexes. Site-directed mutagenesis identifies six potential cobalt/nickel ligands that are obligatory for inducer recognition but not repression by NmtR, four of which (Asp91, His93, His104, His107) align with α5 ligands of SmtB with two additional His provided by a carboxyl-terminal “extension” (designated α5C). Gel retardation assays reveal that zinc does not allosterically regulate NmtR-DNA binding at concentrations where lower affinity cobalt does. These data suggest that two additional ligands form hexacoordinate metal complexes and are crucial for driving allosteric regulation of DNA binding by NmtR, thereby allowing NmtR to preferentially sense metals that favor higher coordination numbers relative to SmtB.

Clearly these sensors discriminate between different metals in vivo, but the factors dictating which inorganic elements elicit responses remain to be defined.There is rich literature describing metal coordination by numerous small molecules in vitro and established theories cataloguing the factors likely to influence metal selectivity in vivo (11Fraústo da Silva J.J.R. Williams R.J.P. The Biological Chemistry of the Elements: The Inorganic Chemistry of Life. 2nd Ed. Clarenden Press, Oxford, UK2001Google Scholar).

The binding sites of enzymes are not only influenced by metal selectivity but also by catalytic constraints, different secondary and tertiary structures, and evolutionary histories. Metalloregulatory proteins have some advantages for exploring metal selectivity in vivo. First, selectivity will have been a dominant factor in the evolution from a common ancestor of structurally similar sensors that detect different metals. Second, by associating their target promoters with reporter genes it is possible to monitor metal occupancy in vivo. In some, if not all, cells there is an absence of free copper (13Rae T.D.

Thus, factors that influence the probability of sensors encountering different labile metal ions are likely to influence metal specificity. For example, metallochaperones assist in the delivery of metals, including nickel (15Hausinger R.P. J. Biol. Inorg.

In a two-hybrid assay, a copper metallochaperone from Synechocystis PCC 6803 was shown to interact with copper transporting P1-type ATPases but not with structurally related zinc or cobalt transporters (17Tottey S.

One, or both, of a pair of His residues (105/106) was/were required for metal recognition but not repression (18Turner J.S. Glands P.D. Samson A.C.R. Robinson N.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3714-3721Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Difference electron density maps obtained after soaking apo-SmtB crystals with mercuric acetate suggested two symmetry-related pairs of metal binding sites per dimer (19Cook W.J. Kar S.R. Taylor K.B. Hall L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 337-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A pair of metal sites was located close to the α3 helix within the DNA-binding helix-turn-helix motif and a second pair was formed by four ligands, two from each monomer, bridging antiparallel carboxyl-terminal α5 helices. Fractional occupancies were low (<2%), and it was subsequently established that SmtB binds only one zinc per monomer with affinity K Zn in excess of 1011m−1 at equilibrium (20VanZile M.L. Cosper N.J. Scott R.A. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11818-11829Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Substitution of cobalt into the zinc sites of SmtB gave spectral features diagnostic of tetrahedral coordination environments with one or two Cys ligands (20VanZile M.L. Cosper N.J. Scott R.A.

However, Cys variant proteins, deficient in α3N, retain inducer responsiveness in vivo (18Turner J.S. Glands P.D. Samson A.C.R. Robinson N.J.

Occupancy of α5 sites (which include His106, Fig. 1 A) regulates DNA binding by SmtB even though α3N sites are occupied in dissociated SmtB (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, trigonal thiolate sites adjacent to a predicted helix-turn-helix region are required for inducer recognition by ArsR (23Shi W. Dong J. Scott R.A. Ksenzenko M.Y. Rosen B.P. J. Biol.

Different allosteric sites (α3N or α5) with distinct ligand sets and geometries correlate with, and presumably contribute toward, the biological metal specificities of individual ArsR-SmtB family members. Analogous observations have been made for Escherichia coli Fur homologues, Fur and Zur (25Outten C.E. Tobin D.A. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10417-10423Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).To identify ArsR-SmtB sensors with new specificities, sequence databases were searched for smtB-related genes adjacent to genes predicted to contribute to homeoestasis of other metals. Ten genes were identified in the fully sequenced genome ofMycobacterium tuberculosis (26Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry 3rd, C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. et al.Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6450) Google Scholar), and Rv3744 was selected due to its proximity to a divergently transcribed gene (Fig. 1 C) encoding a deduced protein with similarity to CoaT (27Rutherford J.C. Cavet J.S. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25827-25832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Genes encoding identical proteins are present in Mycobacterium bovis(www.sanger.ac.uk) strain BCG (28Gordon S.V. Brosch R. Billault A. Garnier T. Eiglmeier K. Cole S.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 643-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). An initial aim of this research was to establish whether the product of Rv3744 binds the adjacent operator-promoter to repress transcription, except in the presence of an excess of some metal. Our data support this, and the genes are designated nmtR and nmtA (Fig.1 C).In this paper we show that NmtR represses expression from thenmt operator-promoter in vivo with repression specifically alleviated by elevated nickel or cobalt, the former being the more potent. Comparative analyses of NmtR and the related zinc sensor SmtB, in vitro and in vivo, lead to some surprising findings. While SmtB detects different metals relative to NmtR in the same cell, revealing intrinsic differences in these sensors, the host cytosol can also influence biological metal selectivity of these metal sensors. We also show that metal sensor selectivity does not simply correlate with metal affinity at equilibrium, but is instead consistent with a model in which distinct coordination geometries of inducing metal complexes of NmtRversus SmtB drive distinct allosteric pathways to effect regulation of DNA binding in each case.DISCUSSIONSeveral lines of evidence demonstrate that NmtR is a nickel/cobalt-responsive DNA-binding repressor of transcription from the divergent nmtA operator-promoter. (i) Purified NmtR forms specific complexes with the nmtA operator promoterin vitro (Fig. 2 A); (ii) equivalent complexes are detected using crude lysates of R2-PIM8(smt) containingnmtR but not cells containing an internal stop codon innmtR (Fig. 3 A); (iii) expression of β-galactosidase activity from the nmtA operator-promoter is elevated in mycobacterial (Fig. 7) and cyanobacterial (Fig. 3) cells devoid of functional nmtR compared with cells containing NmtR; (iv) expression of β-galactosidase activity via thenmtA operator-promoter is elevated in both bacterial cell types in response to elevated cobalt (Figs. 2 and 3), and nickel is the most potent inducer at viable concentrations in the mycobacterium (Fig.2). Factors that contribute to metal selectivity in the context of a cell have been identified, i.e. which metals are detected by NmtR or SmtB.The most potent allosteric effector of NmtR (nickel) in mycobacteria (Fig. 2 C) is totally ineffective when nmtR is introduced into a cyanobacterium (Fig. 4). Clearly NmtR is produced and accumulated in the cyanobacterium (Fig. 3 A), is functional as a repressor (Fig. 3 B), and is competent to detect metal (cobalt) but unable to acquire and detect nickel even at concentrations inhibitory to cell growth (Fig. 4). These observations demonstrate that different cytosolic metal pools can determine the metals that metallo-sensory proteins detect in different cells. By analogy, cadmium and copper are the most potent inducers of dMTF-1 inDrosophila, but in transfected mammalian cells dMTF-1 responds to zinc, similar to its mammalian counterpart (40Zhang B. Egli D. Georiev O. Schaffner W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4505-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In theory, related sensors from different bacteria responding to alternative metals in vivo could have identical metal-binding sites, identical allosteric responses to metals in vitro, but “restricted access” to different available metal pools in vivo.Loss of nickel induction in R2-PIM8(smt) could indicate that a nickel metallochaperone for NmtR is absent in the cyanobacterium, suggesting a technical basis for selective screens for metallochaperones. However, cell nickel quotas (Table I) establish that more effective exclusion of nickel from the cyanobacterial, compared with mycobacterial, cytosol can account for the cellular differences observed here. Strikingly, SmtB does not respond to cobalt in the cyanobacterium even though it is intrinsically capable of allosterically responding to cobalt in vitro (22VanZile M.L. Chen X. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9776-9786Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and cobalt is available for detection in the cell at least by NmtR (Fig.4); furthermore, SmtB binds Co(II) with a far greater affinity than does NmtR (Fig. 8). Although the nature of the available cobalt pool is unknown (association with proteins of cobalamin biosynthesis seems likely), these data imply that NmtR acquires cobalt from this pool far more effectively than does SmtB.Crucially, SmtB and NmtR detect different metals (zinc and cobalt) when analyzed in the same cell type (Fig. 4) establishing that intrinsic features of these two proteins discriminate in favor of different metals. Most importantly this is not solely based on absolute binding preferences, since SmtB and NmtR both have higher affinities for zinc than for cobalt or nickel (Fig. 6), and two contributory factors have been identified. (i) SmtB outcompetes NmtR for zinc (Fig. 5) and could therefore more readily acquire zinc from other ligands in the cytosol. (ii) Zinc mediates allosteric regulation of DNA binding ineffectively (Fig. 6).Why is cobalt (and nickel) more effective than zinc at promoting DNA dissociation by NmtR? NmtR absorption spectra are indicative of distorted octahedral Ni(II) coordination and five- or six-coordinate Co(II) liganding (Fig. 8). In contrast, SmtB is characterized by four-coordinate, tetrahedral complexes of both Co(II) and Zn(II) (20VanZile M.L. Cosper N.J. Scott R.A. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11818-11829Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar,21VanZile M.L. Chen X. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9765-9775Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although the coordination geometry of Zn(II)-NmtR is not yet known, at least one explanation is that the difference in the allosteric regulation of DNA binding by NmtR versus SmtB requires metal coordination bonds to six protein-derived ligands, rather than four. This is consistent with the identification of six potential ligands by site-directed mutagenesis, each obligatory for inducer recognition in vivo. Ni(II) and Co(II) show a greater propensity to form octahedral coordination complexes relative to Zn(II) (11Fraústo da Silva J.J.R. Williams R.J.P. The Biological Chemistry of the Elements: The Inorganic Chemistry of Life. 2nd Ed. Clarenden Press, Oxford, UK2001Google Scholar), and this is the most common geometry for Ni(II) and Co(II) catalogued in protein structural databases (12Rulı́sek L. Vondrásek J. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1998; 71: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar); in contrast, tetrahedral coordination geometry predominates for Zn(II) (12Rulı́sek L. Vondrásek J. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1998; 71: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Consistent with these trends, Zn(II) complexes of E. coliglyoxalase are five-coordinate and catalytically inactive, whereas the Ni(II) and Co(II) complexes recruit an additional water molecule into the first coordination sphere creating a nearly perfect octahedral complex, which exhibits high catalytic activity (41He M.M. Clugston S.L. Honek J.F. Matthews B.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8719-8727Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that two additional ligands provided by the COOH-terminal extension of the α5 helices in NmtR (Fig. 7) adapt negative regulation of operator/promoter binding previously observed for SmtB (22VanZile M.L. Chen X. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9776-9786Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) to require hexadentate metal ligation environments. Metal detection within a cell might therefore be achieved in the absence of strict discrimination at the level of protein-metal binding. It remains unknown why the higher affinity zinc does not associate with NmtRin vivo in such a way that detection of nickel and cobalt is inhibited. This work highlights the need to identify the chemical form(s) of the labile pool(s) of metals accessible by each metal sensor and indeed other metalloproteins. Cells contain regulatory proteins to detect and respond to deficiency or excess of essential metals to maintain sufficient atoms to satisfy the requirements of metalloproteins while avoiding toxicity (1O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1993; 261: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). The ArsR-SmtB family of transcriptional repressors associate with the promoters of genes encoding proteins involved in the efflux and/or sequestration of excess metal (2Robinson N.J. Whitehall S.K. Cavet J.S. Adv. Microbial Physiol. 2001; 44: 183-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). De-repression occurs when the repressors bind metal effectors coincident with the number of atoms exceeding an optimal cell quota. SmtB-mediated repression is alleviated by Zn(II) (3Huckle J.W.

Microbiol. 1999; 32: 643-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). An initial aim of this research was to establish whether the product of Rv3744 binds the adjacent operator-promoter to repress transcription, except in the presence of an excess of some metal. Our data support this, and the genes are designated nmtR and nmtA (Fig.1 C). In this paper we show that NmtR represses expression from thenmt operator-promoter in vivo with repression specifically alleviated by elevated nickel or cobalt, the former being the more potent. Comparative analyses of NmtR and the related zinc sensor SmtB, in vitro and in vivo, lead to some surprising findings. While SmtB detects different metals relative to NmtR in the same cell, revealing intrinsic differences in these sensors, the host cytosol can also influence biological metal selectivity of these metal sensors. We also show that metal sensor selectivity does not simply correlate with metal affinity at equilibrium, but is instead consistent with a model in which distinct coordination geometries of inducing metal complexes of NmtRversus SmtB drive distinct allosteric pathways to effect regulation of DNA binding in each case. DISCUSSIONSeveral lines of evidence demonstrate that NmtR is a nickel/cobalt-responsive DNA-binding repressor of transcription from the divergent nmtA operator-promoter. (i) Purified NmtR forms specific complexes with the nmtA operator promoterin vitro (Fig. 2 A); (ii) equivalent complexes are detected using crude lysates of R2-PIM8(smt) containingnmtR but not cells containing an internal stop codon innmtR (Fig. 3 A); (iii) expression of β-galactosidase activity from the nmtA operator-promoter is elevated in mycobacterial (Fig. 7) and cyanobacterial (Fig. 3) cells devoid of functional nmtR compared with cells containing NmtR; (iv) expression of β-galactosidase activity via thenmtA operator-promoter is elevated in both bacterial cell types in response to elevated cobalt (Figs. 2 and 3), and nickel is the most potent inducer at viable concentrations in the mycobacterium (Fig.2). Factors that contribute to metal selectivity in the context of a cell have been identified, i.e. which metals are detected by NmtR or SmtB.The most potent allosteric effector of NmtR (nickel) in mycobacteria (Fig. 2 C) is totally ineffective when nmtR is introduced into a cyanobacterium (Fig. 4). Clearly NmtR is produced and accumulated in the cyanobacterium (Fig. 3 A), is functional as a repressor (Fig. 3 B), and is competent to detect metal (cobalt) but unable to acquire and detect nickel even at concentrations inhibitory to cell growth (Fig. 4). These observations demonstrate that different cytosolic metal pools can determine the metals that metallo-sensory proteins detect in different cells. By analogy, cadmium and copper are the most potent inducers of dMTF-1 inDrosophila, but in transfected mammalian cells dMTF-1 responds to zinc, similar to its mammalian counterpart (40Zhang B. Egli D. Georiev O. Schaffner W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4505-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In theory, related sensors from different bacteria responding to alternative metals in vivo could have identical metal-binding sites, identical allosteric responses to metals in vitro, but “restricted access” to different available metal pools in vivo.Loss of nickel induction in R2-PIM8(smt) could indicate that a nickel metallochaperone for NmtR is absent in the cyanobacterium, suggesting a technical basis for selective screens for metallochaperones. However, cell nickel quotas (Table I) establish that more effective exclusion of nickel from the cyanobacterial, compared with mycobacterial, cytosol can account for the cellular differences observed here. Strikingly, SmtB does not respond to cobalt in the cyanobacterium even though it is intrinsically capable of allosterically responding to cobalt in vitro (22VanZile M.L. Chen X. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9776-9786Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and cobalt is available for detection in the cell at least by NmtR (Fig.4); furthermore, SmtB binds Co(II) with a far greater affinity than does NmtR (Fig. 8). Although the nature of the available cobalt pool is unknown (association with proteins of cobalamin biosynthesis seems likely), these data imply that NmtR acquires cobalt from this pool far more effectively than does SmtB.Crucially, SmtB and NmtR detect different metals (zinc and cobalt) when analyzed in the same cell type (Fig. 4) establishing that intrinsic features of these two proteins discriminate in favor of different metals. Most importantly this is not solely based on absolute binding preferences, since SmtB and NmtR both have higher affinities for zinc than for cobalt or nickel (Fig. 6), and two contributory factors have been identified. (i) SmtB outcompetes NmtR for zinc (Fig. 5) and could therefore more readily acquire zinc from other ligands in the cytosol. (ii) Zinc mediates allosteric regulation of DNA binding ineffectively (Fig. 6).Why is cobalt (and nickel) more effective than zinc at promoting DNA dissociation by NmtR? NmtR absorption spectra are indicative of distorted octahedral Ni(II) coordination and five- or six-coordinate Co(II) liganding (Fig. 8). In contrast, SmtB is characterized by four-coordinate, tetrahedral complexes of both Co(II) and Zn(II) (20VanZile M.L. Cosper N.J. Scott R.A. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11818-11829Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar,21VanZile M.L. Chen X. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9765-9775Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although the coordination geometry of Zn(II)-NmtR is not yet known, at least one explanation is that the difference in the allosteric regulation of DNA binding by NmtR versus SmtB requires metal coordination bonds to six protein-derived ligands, rather than four. This is consistent with the identification of six potential ligands by site-directed mutagenesis, each obligatory for inducer recognition in vivo. Ni(II) and Co(II) show a greater propensity to form octahedral coordination complexes relative to Zn(II) (11Fraústo da Silva J.J.R. Williams R.J.P. The Biological Chemistry of the Elements: The Inorganic Chemistry of Life. 2nd Ed. Clarenden Press, Oxford, UK2001Google Scholar), and this is the most common geometry for Ni(II) and Co(II) catalogued in protein structural databases (12Rulı́sek L. Vondrásek J. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1998; 71: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar); in contrast, tetrahedral coordination geometry predominates for Zn(II) (12Rulı́sek L. Vondrásek J. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1998; 71: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Consistent with these trends, Zn(II) complexes of E. coliglyoxalase are five-coordinate and catalytically inactive, whereas the Ni(II) and Co(II) complexes recruit an additional water molecule into the first coordination sphere creating a nearly perfect octahedral complex, which exhibits high catalytic activity (41He M.M. Clugston S.L. Honek J.F. Matthews B.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8719-8727Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that two additional ligands provided by the COOH-terminal extension of the α5 helices in NmtR (Fig. 7) adapt negative regulation of operator/promoter binding previously observed for SmtB (22VanZile M.L. Chen X. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9776-9786Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) to require hexadentate metal ligation environments. Metal detection within a cell might therefore be achieved in the absence of strict discrimination at the level of protein-metal binding. It remains unknown why the higher affinity zinc does not associate with NmtRin vivo in such a way that detection of nickel and cobalt is inhibited. This work highlights the need to identify the chemical form(s) of the labile pool(s) of metals accessible by each metal sensor and indeed other metalloproteins. Several lines of evidence demonstrate that NmtR is a nickel/cobalt-responsive DNA-binding repressor of transcription from the divergent nmtA operator-promoter.

https://openalex.org/W2069466136,"Frontotemporal dementias (FTDs), including corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), are neurodegenerative tauopathies characterized by widespread CNS neuronal and glial tau pathologies, but there are no tau transgenic (Tg) mice that model neurodegeneration with glia tau lesions. Thus, we generated Tg mice overexpressing human tau in neurons and glia. No neuronal tau aggregates were detected, but old mice developed Thioflavin S- and Gallyas-positive glial tau pathology resembling CBD astrocytic plaques. Tau-immunoreactive and Gallyas-positive oligodendroglial coiled bodies (similar to CBD and PSP), glial degeneration, and motor deficits were associated with age-dependent accumulations of insoluble hyperphosphorylated human tau and tau immunopositive filaments in degenerating glial cells. Thus, tau-positive glial lesions similar to human FTDs occur in these Tg mice, and these pathologies are linked to glial and axonal degeneration."

This is an assemblage of 24 identical or very similar subunits that are folded in a four-helix bundle and form a spherical shell characterized by 432 symmetry. The protein is tailored to carry out efficiently the different steps leading to iron storage. Thus, the negatively charged channels along the 3-fold symmetry axes allow entry of Fe(II), the ferroxidase sites located within the four-helix bundle of the so-called H-type subunits catalyze iron oxidation by molecular oxygen, and the negatively charged internal cavity favors deposition of an oxyhydroxide core containing up to 4500 iron atoms (4Clegg G.A.

A notable feature of the apoferritin moiety is its capacity to direct iron deposition toward formation of a microcrystalline structure whose characteristics have been elucidated by Mössbauer spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction studies on horse spleen and human ferritin. Basically, the microcrystalline core contains oxygen atoms packed 3 Å apart (7Massover W.H. Cowley J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 36: 3847-3851Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and iron atoms placed in spaces between oxygen layers so that they can be coordinated either octahedrically or tetrahedrically (8Harrison P.M. Lilley T.H. Loehr T. Iron Carriers and Iron Proteins. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1989: 123-238Google Scholar). In L. innocua ferritin, iron oxidation and incorporation are associated to a protein that bears a high structural similarity to the Dps proteins (DNA-binding proteins fromstarved cells), a family of stress-induced polypeptides that bind DNA without apparent sequence specificity and prevent its cleavage by oxidative damage (3Bozzi M. Mignogna G. Stefanini S. Barra D. Longhi C. Valenti P. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3259-3265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The subunits of L. innocuaferritin as those of the Dps proteins do not contain the canonical ferroxidase site residues; they fold into a four-helix bundle, but assemble into a dodecameric structure with 23 symmetry (9Ilari A. Stefanini S. Chiancone E. Tsernoglou D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 10Grant R.A. Filman D.J. Finkel S.E. Kolter R. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). It follows that the structural elements associated with the iron oxidation-uptake process have distinct features relative to classical ferritins. The most remarkable difference concerns the ferroxidase site, which is placed at the interface between 2-fold symmetry-related subunits such that both subunits furnish the iron-coordinating ligands. On the other hand, access of Fe(II) to the ferroxidase site and deposition of Fe(III) take place similarly to classical ferritins, since both the channels along the 3-fold symmetry axes and the surface of the internal cavity are lined with negatively charged amino acid residues. In the Dps proteins, most of the residues that coordinate the metal in the Listeria ferroxidase site are conserved and are part of the so-called “DNA-binding signature.” Therefore, it was suggested that all the members of the Dps family are endowed with iron uptake properties (9Ilari A. Stefanini S. Chiancone E. Tsernoglou D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Indeed, Escherichia coli Dps, the family prototype, and the Helicobacter pylorineutrophil-activating protein were shown to incorporate iron (11Zhao G. Ceci P. Ilari A. Giangiacomo L. Laue T.M. Chiancone E. Chasteen N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27689-27696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 12Tonello F. Dundon W.G. Satin B. Molinari M. Tognon G. Grandi G. Del Giudice G. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Moreover, the study of E. coli Dps disclosed an unforeseen ability to use hydrogen peroxide rather than oxygen in iron oxidation and suggested a slow clearance of Fe(III) from the ferroxidase sites. It is not known whether the ferritin-like properties of E. coli Dps extend to the formation of a microcrystalline core. This point is addressed in the present work. Iron-loaded E. coliDps crystals have been studied by polarized single crystal absorption microspectrophotometry (Ref. 13Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1996; 25: 343-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar and references therein). This technique is particularly apt to assess the nature of the iron core, since Fe(III) in the high spin 3d5 configuration gives rise to different absorption bands in the visible region depending on whether it is coordinated tetrahedrally or octahedrally. In the case of a microcrystalline core, the different projections of the transition moments of the various chromophores on the crystal axes would lead to polarized absorption spectra distinct from the solution (isotropic) spectrum. A second point that has been addressed concerns more specifically the ferroxidase site. Crystals of iron-loaded Dps have been used to establish whether iron remains bound to the site after oxidation has taken place. This aspect is relevant not only in connection with the slow clearance of Fe(III) reported by Zhao et al. (11Zhao G. Ceci P. Ilari A. Giangiacomo L. Laue T.M. Chiancone E. Chasteen N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27689-27696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), but also in more general terms, since direct observations of iron bound to the ferritin ferroxidase sites have been made only on Listeria ferritin and E. coliferritin FTNa (9Ilari A. Stefanini S. Chiancone E. Tsernoglou D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The present results show that E. coli Dps directs iron deposition toward formation of a microcrystalline iron core, where iron is coordinated tetrahedrically, and furnish additional evidence for the ferritin-like function of this protein. In iron-loaded Dps crystals, two water molecules replace the metal ions at the ferroxidase site, indicating that iron, once oxidized, leaves the site, a typical property of mammalian ferritins. The protein was purified from the E. coli Dps expression strain ZK1100, kindly provided by Dr. S. E. Finkel, as described in Ref. 14Almiron M. Link A.J. Furlong D. Kolter R.

Therefore, it was incubated in the presence of air with ferrous sulfate in an amount corresponding to 400 iron atoms/dodecamer. The iron oxidation/incorporation process was followed spectrophotometrically at 310 nm (15Stefanini S. Cavallo S. Montagnini B. Chiancone E. Biochem. J. 1999; 349: 783-786Google Scholar). The amount of iron incorporated in the protein shell was found to correspond to 255 ± 42 iron atoms/dodecamer as shown by analytical ultracentrifugation (11Zhao G. Ceci P. Ilari A. Giangiacomo L.

Mallet B. Biochem. J. 1955; 59: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Dps containing 255 ± 42 iron atoms/dodecamer was crystallized by the hanging drop vapor-diffusion technique as described by Grantet al. (10Grant R.A. Filman D.J. Finkel S.E. Kolter R. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The protein solution (2 μl) was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution containing 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH = 7.8, 1.4–1.7 m sodium formiate, and 9–12% PEG1 8000, as the crystal-stabilizing agent. The crystals thus obtained will be referred to as iron-loaded. Different data sets were collected using 0.5 oscillation frames on the x-ray beamline at the ELETTRA synchrotron in Basovizza (Trieste) and at the Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron (DESY) in Hamburg. The data were collected at 100 K using 20% glycerol as cryoprotectant. Intensities were integrated with DENZO and scaled and merged with SCALEPACK (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38609) Google Scholar). The data scaling indicates that the iron-loaded Dps crystals are orthorhombic P21212 with unit cell dimensions of a = 134.41, b = 139.65, c = 118.11, as the crystals of native Dps. The structure of the iron-containing protein was refined using REFMAC (18Murshudov G.N. Lebedev A. Vagin A.A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

When desired, the mother liquor was replaced by a medium of similar composition, containing a specific reagent. Spectra were collected using a Zeiss MPM800 microspectrophotometer. Absorption of the incident plane polarized light was recorded between 700 and 300 nm with a beam directed normal to a crystal face and the electric vector oriented in two perpendicular directions P1 and P2, each one representing an extinction direction of the crystal (20Rivetti C. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Henry E.R. Eaton W.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2888-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Because of the irregular shape of the Dps crystals, it was not possible to identify the observed face nor the particular crystal axis along which spectra were collected. In the case of orthorhombic crystals, the a,b, and c axes coincide with the principal optical directions, along which absorption of polarized light obeys the Lambert and Beer law. Sodium dithionite was used as reducing agent. Stock solutions of sodium dithionite (0.1 m) were prepared in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH = 7.8, 200 mm NaCl, under purified nitrogen gas. In the solution experiments, aliquots of 0.1 m sodium dithionite were added to 1 μm Dps containing 4 mm α-α′-bipyridyl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH = 7.8, by means of a gas tight syringe. The time course of reaction was monitored using a Hewlett-Packard Diode Array Spectrophotometer, equipped with a thermostatted cell maintained at 25 °C, and specifically followed at 520 nm, the wavelength corresponding to the absorption maximum of the Fe(II)-bipyridyl complex. The kinetics of iron release within crystals was followed by monitoring the absorption decrease in the 450–300 nm region. The iron-loaded Dps crystals were stabilized by a solution of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH = 7.8, 1.4–1.7 m sodium formiate, and 9–12% PEG 8000 and placed in a flow cell. Iron release was induced by replacing the initial medium with a similar one containing 3 or 10 mmsodium dithionite. The data were fitted using the program MATLAB (The Math Works Inc., Natick, MA). The crystals of iron-loaded E. coli Dps are orthorhombic, similarly to the crystals of the native protein and its isomorphous derivative with Pb, studied by Grant et al. (10Grant R.A. Filman D.J. Finkel S.E. Kolter R. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). At the interface of 2-fold symmetry related subunits, in the position corresponding to the ferroxidase center in Listeria ferritin, the 2F o − F c andF o − F c maps show two distinct electron density peaks with an intensity higher than 3 ς (Fig.1). The peaks can be assigned to water molecules forming strong hydrogen bonds with His51and His63 from one subunit and Glu82from the symmetry-related one. In the Dps crystals studied by Grantet al. (10Grant R.A. Filman D.J. Finkel S.E. Kolter R. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), these amino acids provide the Pb ligands together with Lys48 and Asp67 from one subunit and Asp78 from the other. Lys48 forms a salt bridge with Asp78 (Nz-OD1 = 2.87 Å), which is in the position occupied by Asp58, one of the iron ligands, inListeria ferritin. It may be recalled that, in the crystal structure of Listeria ferritin, the ferroxidase center contains one iron ion and a water molecule, which is thought to replace the second iron ion, since a bimetallic intermediate is formed during the ferroxidation reaction (21Yang X. Chiancone E. Stefanini S. Ilari A. Chasteen N.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The solution spectra of iron-loaded Dps are characterized by an increasing absorption in the range between 400 and 300 nm due to the iron hydroxide stored within the protein cavity (Fig. 2). This feature is common to all ferritins (22Treffry A. Harrison P.M. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1984; 21: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The polarized absorption spectra collected along P1 and P2 differ in shape and intensity (Fig. 3 A). In the P2 direction the absorption spectrum is more intense but nearly featureless, whereas in the P1 direction it exhibits a weak absorption band in the 370 nm region, clearly observed in the difference spectrum (Fig. 3 C). Based on the absorption spectrum of [FeO4] in iron-doped orthoclase feldspar, which displays a band with a maximum at 377 nm assigned to the d-d spin forbidden transition 6A1→4A1,4E (23Webb J. Gray H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 351: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), this band may be assigned to Fe(III) tetracoordinated to oxygen atoms. Treatment of the crystal with sodium dithionite causes a decrease of the crystal absorbance in both the P1 and P2 directions of about 45% (Fig. 3, B and C). Thus, dithionite causes iron reduction/release as in classical ferritins. It is noteworthy that, despite the large excess of dithionite, the absorption spectrum is not abolished. At the end of the experiment the crystal was washed with a solution of mother liquor without dithionite. There was no recovery of the signal, an indication of iron release in the medium. To monitor the time course of iron reduction/release in Dps crystals, polarized absorption spectra along P1 were measured every 2 min after addition of dithionite in large excess. Spectral changes along this principal optical direction measure time-dependent changes in the concentration of the absorbing species. Fig. 4 shows that the decrease of the crystal absorbance at 372 nm as a function of time can be fitted to a mono-exponential curve and that the corresponding rate constant is 6.7 × 10−4 s−1. This low rate is not limited by diffusion of dithionite through the crystal channels. The time course of iron reduction/release by dithionite from soluble iron-loaded Dps at the same pH of 7.8 is shown in Fig.5 A. In these experiments iron release was followed at 520 nm, where formation of the complex between Fe(II) and α-α′-bipyridyl is monitored. The time course is biphasic with kinetic constants of 4.7 × 10−2s−1 and 1.2 × 10−3 s−1when dithionite is 5 mm. Fig. 5 A shows that the fast phase accounts for 70% of the total absorbance change. A 2-fold variation of the bipyridyl concentration does not change the observed rates, indicating that formation of the Fe(II)-bipyridyl complex is rapid compared with the iron reduction/release process. Fig.6 shows that the two kinetic constants depend similarly on dithionite concentration and that the dependence is not linear. It should be mentioned that parallel experiments in which iron reduction was assessed by following the decrease in absorbance at 380 nm yield the same results (data not shown).Figure 6Plot of the rate constants for iron reduction/release from iron-loaded soluble Dps determined in Fig. 5 versus dithionite concentration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The dependence of the reaction on pH was also studied. A decrease of pH to 6.5 results in the increase in the rate of both kinetic phases (Fig.5 B). The rate constants correspond to 14.2 × 10−2 s−1 and 4.6 × 10−3s−1, respectively, at the dithionite concentration (5 mm) used for the experiment reported in panel A. The present experiments contribute to define the ferritin-like properties of E. coli Dps, the prototype of the family.E. coli Dps is shown to behave like canonical ferritins in that it forms inside the protein cavity a microcrystalline oxyhydroxide core, which can be mobilized upon reduction. In addition, the affinity of the ferroxidase site for Fe(III) is shown to differ in Dps relative to Listeria ferritin where the redox center has the same unusual intersubunit location and most of the iron ligands in common. All the investigations on the iron oxidation/incorporation properties of Dps proteins stem from the recognition that these proteins contain the L. innocua ferritin ferroxidase site as part of the so-called DNA-binding signature, the family characteristic (24Halligan B.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5520-5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). InE. coli Dps, the iron oxidation and hydrolysis reactions lead to incorporation inside the protein shell of about 400 iron ions with an overall mechanism that resembles closely that ofListeria ferritin (21Yang X. Chiancone E. Stefanini S. Ilari A. Chasteen N.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, there is a distinctive difference between the two proteins related to the clearance from the original binding site of the two metal ions that participate in the redox reaction. In fact, Fig. 1 shows that in iron-loaded Dps crystals the ferroxidase center is occupied by two water molecules and not by the metal, in contrast with L. innocua crystals where one iron ion remains bound tightly to the site even after treatment with sodium dithionite (9Ilari A. Stefanini S. Chiancone E. Tsernoglou D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In turn, the absence of bound Fe(III) at the ferroxidase site of E. coli Dps crystals is in accordance with the observation that, in soluble Dps, the absorbance maximum at 297 nm attributed to this species decreases after a few hours to about 70%, due to movement of iron to the internal cavity (11Zhao G. Ceci P. Ilari A. Giangiacomo L. Laue T.M. Chiancone E. Chasteen N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27689-27696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The relatively low affinity for Fe(III) inE. coli Dps may be ascribed to the presence of a salt bridge between Lys48 (His28 in Listeriaferritin) and Asp78 (Nz-OD1 = 2.87 Å), which is one of the metal ligands in the isomorphous derivative with Pb (10Grant R.A. Filman D.J. Finkel S.E. Kolter R. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) and corresponds to one of the iron ligands in Listeria ferritin (Asp58). This salt bridge limits the flexibility of the amino acid side chain and thereby decreases its coordination capacity. Therefore in Dps, despite the striking similarity withListeria ferritin ferroxidase centers, both iron ions leave the bimetallic ferroxidase site to reach the internal cavity. Two characteristic features of the ferritin oxyhydroxide iron core are its microcrystalline structure and its reductive mobilization. To establish whether the iron incorporated inside the Dps cavity shares these features, experiments have been performed both in solution and on single crystals. The polarized absorption spectra of crystals provide information on: (i) the presence of absorbing species and their degree of order and (ii) the fine structure of such species. In the case of the iron core here described, one can establish the coordination symmetry of the metal in the core, since Fe(III) coordinated tetrahedrally with oxygen has a typical absorption band at around 380 nm, whereas Fe(III) coordinated octahedrally with oxygen has absorption bands in the near infrared region and in the visible region at 550 nm and 407 nm, all ascribable to d-d transitions (23Webb J. Gray H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 351: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The results reported in Fig. 3 demonstrate unambiguously that the E. coli Dps iron core is ordered and that the metal is tetrahedrally coordinated with oxygen, given the presence of a distinct band at about 372 nm and the absence of bands at higher wavelengths. It may be envisaged that Fe(III) and oxygen atoms form a crystal with tetrahedral symmetry where the tetrahedron center is occupied by iron ions and the vertices by oxygen. The result is of interest in light of the fact that the available literature data, obtained with other spectroscopic techniques, do not yield clear-cut answers with respect to the iron coordination geometry in ferritins. Thus, Mössbauer spectra measured on horse spleen ferritin and model compounds are indicative of a octahedral coordination (8Harrison P.M. Lilley T.H. Loehr T. Iron Carriers and Iron Proteins. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1989: 123-238Google Scholar). In contrast, x-ray scattering data on model compounds (25Towe K., M. Bradley W., F. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1967; 24: 384-390Crossref Scopus (337) Google Scholar) indicate that iron coordination is tetrahedral. The iron reduction/release reaction measured on Dps crystals and in solution shows that the microcrystalline iron core is readily mobilizable after reduction as is the case for all known ferritins. The choice of dithionite as a reducing agent has been dictated by two considerations: it can diffuse easily through the crystal liquid channels, and it has been used for a number of ferritins (26Stefanini S. Chiancone E. Vecchini P. Antonini E. Crichton R.R. Proteins of Iron Storage and Transport in Biochemistry and Medicine. North Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam1975: 295-302Google Scholar, 27Funk F. Lenders J.P. Crichton R.R. Schneider W. Eur. J.

Lin Q.M. Kong B. Zeng R.Y. Qiao Y.H. Chen H. Zhang F.Z. Xu L.S. J. Protein Chem. 1999; 18: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The reduction/release process, despite its complexity as it involves several steps including diffusion of dithionite inside the protein, electron transfer from dithionite to Fe(III), and protonation of hydroxide ions, appears to be a biphasic process when measured in solution with the fast phase taking place in a few seconds at neutral pH and millimolar dithionite concentrations (Fig. 5). It is not surprising therefore that this phase cannot be followed on single crystals where only one slow process is observed (Fig. 4). The slow reaction has comparable rates in crystalline and soluble Dps and, in the latter case, both in the absence and in the presence of the Fe(II) chelator α-α′-bipyridyl. It follows that both dithionite diffusion through the crystal liquid channels and binding of Fe(II) to the chelating agent are not rate-limiting. Upon decrease of pH from 7.8 to 6.5 the rate of iron reduction in solution increases about 2-fold as shown in Fig. 5 and reported for all known ferritins (26Stefanini S. Chiancone E. Vecchini P. Antonini E. Crichton R.R. Proteins of Iron Storage and Transport in Biochemistry and Medicine. North Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam1975: 295-302Google Scholar, 27Funk F. Lenders J.P.

Protein Chem. 1999; 18: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It is of interest to compare the present findings on Dps with the literature data involving classical ferritins and dithionite (TableI). Two kinetic phases have been observed in pig spleen ferritin, a fast, first order reaction for iron release from the surface of the core and a slower zero order reaction involving iron inside the core (29Huang Q. Lin Q.M. Kong B. Zeng R.Y. Qiao Y.H. Chen H. Zhang F.Z. Xu L.S. J. Protein Chem. 1999; 18: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In Azotobacter vinelandii heme-containing ferritin a similar biphasic reduction process takes place, albeit with different characteristics, since both phases depend on dithionite concentration in a complex manner. They have been ascribed to reduction of two different populations of iron atoms, those in the core and those attached to the interior of the shell or associated to the heme groups (28Richards T.D. Pitts K.R. Watt G.D. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1996; 61: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Similarly, the two phases observed in the kinetics of iron release from soluble Dps may be taken to reflect the presence of two distinct iron populations.Table IRate constants for iron reduction/release by dithionite from E. coli Dps and ferritinsk 1(s −1)k 2Taken fromSoluble Dps at pH 6.5 (fromA 520 nm)14.2 × 10−24.6 × 10−3Present workSoluble Dps at pH 7.8FromA 520 nm4.7 × 10−212.0 × 10−4Present workFromA 380 nm6.8 × 10−27.8 × 10−4Present workDps crystals at pH 7.86.7 × 10−4Present workHorse spleen ferritin at pH 8.03.3 × 10−4Ref. 26Stefanini S.

Open table in a new tab The rate constants refer to a dithionite concentration around 5 mm. In conclusion, the capacity of E. coli Dps to direct iron deposition toward formation of a microcrystalline iron core and the behavior of the core itself attendant reduction furnish additional evidence for the ferritin-like function of this class of proteins. It remains to be established how these properties act in cooperation, on the one hand, with iron uptake to achieve iron homeostasis and, on the other hand, with physical association to DNA to protect it effectively against oxidative damage.

Moreover, the left DPFC showed more prominent activation under the short-term memory task for sentences than that for word lists, which cannot be explained by general cognitive factors such as task difficulty and verbal short-term memory.

These disorders exemplify a novel mechanism of biological information transfer characterized by the generation of an abnormally folded isoform of the cellular prion protein (PrPC), denoted PrPSc, which represents the major component of infectious prion particles (1Prusiner S.B. Scott M.R. Dearmond S.J. Cohen F.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 337-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). PrPC is a neuronal membrane glycoprotein whose function has not been fully characterized. PrPC is rich in α-helical regions but can be converted into PrPSc, a protease-resistant isoform rich in β-sheet content that accumulates in the brain of infected organisms (2Cohen F.E. Pan K.M. Huang Z. Baldwin M. Fletterick R.J. Prusiner S.B. Science. 1994; 264: 530-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that PrPSc may physically interact with PrPC, acting as a nucleus or template for the formation of new PrPScmolecules. During biogenesis, PrPC transits through the secretory pathway and is modified both by glycosylation and addition of a C-terminal GPI anchor. It is delivered to the cell surface clustered in detergent insoluble domains, as has been observed for other GPI-anchored proteins and signaling molecules (3Gorodinsky A. Harris D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 4Naslavsky N. Stein R. Yanai A. Friedlander G. Taraboulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6324-6331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The PrP protein is then rapidly endocytosed and recycled back to the cell surface. During this process, PrPC is cleaved, probably in an acidic cellular compartment. In cellular models, the conversion of PrPC into PrPSc is thought to occur after PrPC has reached the plasma membrane and has been re-internalized for degradation (5Caughey B. Raymond G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18217-18223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Caughey B. Raymond G.J. Ernst D. Race R.E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6597-6603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying the conversion reaction are enigmatic, and the precise intracellular compartment where it occurs remains unknown. Cells maintain several dynamic properties to internalize and secrete proteins in different ways. The traffic of membranes between organelles occurs through vesicular or tubular intermediates that selectively convey proteins and lipids from one compartment to another under the control of specific proteins. In this context, small GTPases of the Rab family are believed to play a role of insuring accurate targeting or docking of transport vesicles with their acceptor membranes (7Martinez O. Goud B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 8Chavrier P. Goud B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 9Gonzalez Jr., L. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1999; 96: 755-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). They operate as molecular switches by interacting with different sets of proteins in the inactive GDP or active GTP-bound states (see review in Ref. 10Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2710) Google Scholar). Individual members of the Rab family are uniquely localized in specific membrane compartments and control the direction and/or specificity of particular steps in intracellular protein trafficking (Fig. 1). The roles of specific Rab proteins have been partially defined by studies involving overexpression of mutant Rab proteins with defective guanine nucleotide-binding properties. The exact subcellular sites of the processing events involved in the genesis of PrPSc remain to be determined. It is likely that many, if not all, of the steps in the intracellular trafficking of PrP are mediated by distinct members of the Rab family. Consequently, functional perturbation of Rab proteins known to be localized in specific subcellular compartments may help to define the routes by which PrPC is converted into PrPSc. As a first step in testing this approach, we have examined the effects of dominant-negative or constitutively active mutations of Rab4 and Rab6a proteins on the formation of PrPSc in a prion-infected neuroblastoma cell line. Rab4 protein has been implicated in the regulation of membrane recycling from early endosomes to the recycling compartment or directly to the plasma membrane (11McCaffrey M.W. Bielli A. Cantalupo G.

S. A. 1996; 93: 9559-9564Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and may be involved in the plasma membrane recycling of PrPC. Rab6a stimulates retrograde transport at the level of the Golgi and induces a progressive, microtubule-dependent redistribution of Golgi resident proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 (13Martinez O. Schmidt A. Salamero J. Hoflack B. Roa M. Goud B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1575-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 14Martinez O. Antony C. Pehau-Arnaudet G. Berger E.G. Salamero J.

When the dominant-negative Rab4-GDP or the constitutively activated Rab6a-GTP mutants were overexpressed in prion-infected N2a cells, we detected a marked increase in the conversion of PrPC to the pathogenic form PrPSc. This effect was observed both with endogenous PrPC and with an exogenous 3F4-tagged MoPrP (15Kascsak R.J. Rubinstein R. Merz P.A. Tonna-DeMasi M. Fersko R. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence and cell fractionation studies demonstrated an accumulation of PrP in the endoplasmic reticulum in Rab6a-GTP expressing cells. Our data suggest that retrotransport of PrPC toward the ER increases the production of PrPSc, suggesting that this organelle plays an important role in PrPSc formation.

Rab4wt, Rab4S22N, and Rab4Q67L cDNAs were a kind gift from Dr. Mary McCaffrey. Rab4 and Rab6awt, Rab6aT27N, and Rab6aQ72L cDNAs were subcloned in the eukaryotic vector pRK5myc downstream and in-frame with the Myc epitope MEQKLISEEDL and sequenced-verified. N2aMoPrP-22L cells were transfected using FuGene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Four days after transfection, cells were washed in PBS and lysed for 20 min at 4 °C in Triton/DOC lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and protease inhibitors). After 3 min of centrifugation at 6,000 rpm, the supernatant was collected and assayed for total protein content with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Protein concentration was adjusted with lysis buffer. For detection of PrPSc, equivalent volumes of samples were digested with 16 μg of proteinase K per mg of protein at 37 °C for 30 min, and the digestion was stopped by incubation with Pefablock (1 mm) for 5 min on ice. The samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in 25 μl of SDS loading buffer and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in 12% acrylamide gels and transferred onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) in Towbin buffer containing 10% ethanol. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TTBS (0.1% Tween 20, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8) for 1 h at room temperature. After an overnight incubation at 4 °C with primary antibodies (anti-PrP SAF mix or SAF32 diluted 1/300 in 5% milk in TTBS, anti-PDI or anti-GS28 diluted 1/500 in TTBS) the membrane was washed four times in TTBS and incubated for 1 h with an anti-mouse horseradish peroxydase conjugate (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1/5000 in 5% milk in TTBS. The membrane was washed four times with TTBS and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence. Gel bands were quantified using Sigma Scan Image software. To separate and enrich Golgi and ER membranes, N2aMoPrP-22L cells were homogenized by using a stainless steel ball-bearing homogenizer (HGM Precision Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) in 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm magnesium acetate, and a protease inhibitor mixture in a final concentration of 1 volume of cell pellet per 5 volumes of homogenizing medium. Sucrose gradients were performed as described in Ref. 17Greenfield J.P. Tsai J. Gouras G.K. Hai B. Thinakaran G. Checler F. Sisodia S.S. Greengard P. Xu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 742-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar. 1-ml fractions were collected from the top of each gradient, assayed for protein content, and methanol-precipitated. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min, the pellets were resuspended in SDS loading buffer. PrP was assayed by running fractions on 12% SDS-PAGE, transferring the proteins onto Immobilon membranes, and performing Western blot analysis with SAF32 antibodies. N2aMoPrP-22L cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, washed three times with PBS, and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X100 PBS for 3 min. Permeabilized cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 0.2% bovine serum albumin in PBS (PBS-BSA) and for 1 h at 37 °C with primary antibodies diluted in PBS-BSA: anti-PrP 45–66 polyclonal antibodies (1/300), anti-PDI (1/500), or anti-Myc 9E10 mAb (1/200). After three washes in PBS-BSA, cells were further incubated with fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (dilution 1/50) and Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies (dilution 1/50) for 1 h at 37 °C. DNA was stained with Hoeschst 33286. Cells were washed and mounted in FluorSave reagent (Calbiochem). Images were collected and processed on a Zeiss Axiophot. In order to interfere with PrP intracellular trafficking and processing, prion-infected neuroblastoma N2a cells overexpressing mouse PrP (N2aMoPrP-Ch and N2aMoPrP-22L) were transfected with expression vectors encoding Myc-Rab4WT, Myc-Rab6aWT, the dominant-negative mutants Myc-Rab4S22N and Myc-Rab6aT27N, and the GTPase-deficient mutants Myc-Rab4Q67L and Myc-Rab6aQ72L. Expression levels of the Myc-Rab4 and Myc-Rab6a wild-type and mutant proteins ranged from 3- to 5-fold over the endogenous Rab proteins (data not shown). Four days after transfection, cells were lysed, and equal amounts of proteins were digested with proteinase K. The relative amounts of PrPScdetected by immunoblot analysis were measured in the different samples. Rab protein expression did not have any major effect on PrPC production (data not shown), but for accurate data analysis the values were normalized to the total intracellular PrP in each sample. Compared with cultures that were transfected with the expression vector alone, cells overexpressing Rab4S22N and Rab6aQ72L showed a dramatic increase in PrPScproduction (Fig. 2, A andB). No significant effect was observed in cells expressing Rab4Q67L or Rab6aT27N. Similar results were obtained with cells infected by the two different prion strains (Chandler and 22L). These observations provide the first indication that overexpression of mutant Rab proteins might affect PrP intracellular trafficking and therefore the conversion of PrPC into PrPSc. To validate these results, we determined whether expression of mutant Rab proteins could interfere with the pathogenic conversion of ade novo synthesized PrP protein. N2aMoPrP-Ch cells infected by the Chandler prion strain were co-transfected with Myc-Rab4S22N, Myc-Rab6aWT, or Myc-Rab6aQ72L expression vectors and a 3F4-tagged MoPrP plasmid. Four days after transfection, total cellular lysates were subjected to proteinase K digestion, and exogenous newly converted PrPSc was revealed by immunoblot with monoclonal antibodies directed against the 3F4 epitope (Pri308). Expression levels of 3F4-MoPrP were similar in each condition (not shown). Data presented in Fig. 2, C and D, demonstrated an increased accumulation of exogenous 3F4-PrPSc in cells expressing Myc-Rab4S22N, Myc-Rab6aWT, and Myc-Rab6aQ72L. Combined with the data observed with endogenous PrP, these results strongly suggest that impairing the plasma membrane recycling of PrP (by overexpressing Rab4S22N) and stimulating the retrograde transport of proteins toward the ER (by expressing Rab6awtand Rab6aQ72L) increased the formation of the PrPSc conformation. These results are in agreement with previous findings showing that PrPSc conversion occurs within intracellular compartments and suggest that PrPSc formation may involve a retrograde transport of PrP molecules into the ER. Before proceeding with further analysis of PrPSc formation in cells expressing mutant Rab proteins, an immunofluorescence study was conducted to determine the subcellular localization of PrP in the presence of Rab proteins. Because the expression of Rab6aQ72L had the most dramatic effect on PrPC conversion into PrPSc, we decided to focus our study on the role of this Rab6a mutant protein on PrP trafficking. N2aMoPrP-22L cells, which had been transfected with Myc-Rab6aQ72L, were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence. The overall transfection efficiency for the Myc-Rab6aQ72L vector was estimated to be ∼90%. As shown in Fig. 3, A–F, PrP is excluded from the cell surface in Myc-Rab6aQ72L-expressing cells and accumulates in an intracellular compartment partially co-localized with Rab6a in the Golgi apparatus. We used PDI (protein disulfide isomerase) as an ER marker in double labeling immunofluorescence experiments. PDI, a protein resident in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, is distributed in a reticular pattern throughout the cytoplasm. We found that intracellular PrP showed a widespread cytoplasmic staining pattern that co-localized with PDI, producing a yellow color throughout the cytoplasm in a merge image (Fig. 3, G–I). These results demonstrate that expression of the Rab6a GTP-bound form in N2a cells induces an altered distribution of PrP toward intracellular compartments and that intracellular PrP outside the Golgi co-localizes with an ER marker. These results were independent of the N2a cell line, because similar results were observed with Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing MoPrP (data not shown). Interestingly, we can also detect the presence of PrP in the nuclei of the cells, presumably in the nucleoli, as already described (18Pfeifer K. Bachmann M. Schroder H.C. Forrest J. Muller W.E. Cell Biochem. Funct. 1993; 11: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 19Rybner C. Finel-Szermanski S. Felin M. Sahraoui T. Rousseau C. Fournier J.G. Seve A.P. Botti J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 84: 408-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The intracellular localization of PrP in Rab6aQ72L-expressing cells was also determined by subcellular fractionation on sucrose density gradients. GS28 and PDI were used as markers for Golgi and ER fractions, respectively. Mock-transfected or overexpressing Myc-Rab6aQ72LN2aMoPrP-22L cells were fractionated on an equilibrium sucrose gradient, and the distribution of total PrP was determined by immunoblotting the subcellular fractions with anti-PrP antibodies. Fig.4 shows that PrP was most abundant in the ER-enriched fractions in Rab6aQ72L-transfected cells. Our results demonstrate that stimulation of retrograde transport by Rab6aQ72L in N2a cells induced an intracellular redistribution of the prion protein within the ER compartment, showing for the first time that PrP proteins can be subject to an ER retrograde transport. Furthermore, we have determined that accumulation of PrP molecules in the ER is accompanied by an increase of PrPScformation. Recent studies have shown that wild-type PrPC molecules were degraded through the ER-associated degradation (ERAD)-proteasome pathway (20Yedidia Y. Horonchik L. Tzaban S. Yanai A. Taraboulos A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5383-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 21Ma J. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14955-14960Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The ERAD-proteasome pathway is involved in the degradation of incorrectly folded proteins that failed to pass the ER ‘quality control’. Cells treated with proteasome inhibitors accumulate partially protease-resistant insoluble PrP molecules. The PK-resistant PrP molecules detected in the presence of Rab6aQ72L in infected N2aMoPrP-22L cells could therefore correspond to an accumulation in the ER of PrPC molecules that failed to be degraded by the ERAD pathway. To address this question, non-infected N2aMoPrP cells were transfected with Myc-Rab6aQ72L or incubated for 12 h with 150 μm of the proteasome inhibitor ALLN (N-acetyl-leucinal-leucinal-norleucinal). Lysates were subjected to partial proteolysis (5, 10, or 16 μg proteinase K/mg proteins, 30 min at 37 °C) before Western blotting with SAF Mix antibodies (Fig. 5 A). In mock or Rab6aQ72L-transfected cells, PrPC was completely digested with 10 or 16 μg proteinase K/mg proteins suggesting that abnormally folded PrP proteins are efficiently degraded by the proteasome system. When the ERAD-proteasome pathway is inhibited, partially protease-resistant PrP species can be detected (ALLN-treated cells). Equal amounts of PrPC were detected in the different samples before PK digestion (Fig. 5 B). Fig.5 C shows the expression of Myc-Rab6aQ72L in the transfected cells. We conclude that the expression of Rab6aQ72L in prion-infected N2aMoPrP cells induced accumulation of PrPSc and not PK-resistant PrP molecules that failed to pass the ERAD proteasome system. A major conformational change is thought to be a key event in the conversion of PrPC into the abnormal PrPScisoform. To understand the molecular events involved in the pathogenesis of prion diseases, it is important to know which subcellular compartments are implicated in the conversion mechanisms. PrPC is synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and transits through the Golgi apparatus on its way to the cell surface. During its biosynthesis, PrPC is subject to several post-translational modifications: N-glycosylation at two sites, formation of a disulfide bond, and attachment of a GPI anchor. PrPC is addressed to the cell surface, where it is attached by its GPI anchor. PrPC does not remain on the cell surface but constitutively cycles between the plasma membrane and an endocytic compartment, from which most of the PrPC is recycled back to the cell surface. This endocytic recycling pathway is of interest because it may be the route along which conversion of PrPCto PrPSc takes place. It has been hypothesized that detergent-resistant microdomains of the plasma membrane (“rafts”) may be involved in formation of PrPSc (3Gorodinsky A. Harris D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 4Naslavsky N. Stein R. Yanai A. Friedlander G. Taraboulos A. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). However, kinetic studies of mutant PrP molecules synthesized in Chinese hamster ovary cells suggest that individual steps in the formation of PrPSc may take place in at least two different cellular locations (24Daude N. Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11604-11612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In fact, mutant proteins are already abnormal following synthesis in the ER, whereas detergent insolubility and protease resistance properties are acquired after arrival of the proteins at the cell surface. Because the transport routes that determine PrPC endocytosis and PrPSc conversion remain elusive, we studied the effect of Rab mutant proteins on PrPSc formation. Rab proteins are distributed in distinct intracellular compartments and regulate specific tethering/docking of incoming vesicles to the correct target organelle (10Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2710) Google Scholar). As a first approach, we used Rab4, Rab6, and Rab9 wild-type and mutant proteins to interfere with PrP intracellular trafficking in prion-infected N2a cells. Rab4 proteins are localized in early and recycling endosomes and are implicated in early endosome protein sorting and recycling to the cell surface. We have found that expression of the GDP-bound Rab4S22N mutant in prion-infected N2a cells impairs plasma membrane recycling and results in an accumulation of PrPSc. These results suggest that PrPSc formation does not require cell surface recycling and occurs within an intracellular compartment, in agreement with several publications (25McKinley M.P. Taraboulos A. Kenaga L. Serban D. Stieber A. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Gonatas N. Lab. Invest. 1991; 65: 622-630PubMed Google Scholar, 26Taraboulos A. Raeber A.J. Borchelt D.R. Serban D. Prusiner S.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) demonstrating that an endocytic pathway was involved in the generation of PrPScin scrapie-infected N2a cells. In order to interfere with downstream steps of PrP trafficking, we studied the effect of wild-type or mutant Rab6a proteins on PrP conversion. Extensive studies have documented the localization of Rab6a in the trans-Golgi cisternea and trans-Golgi network in mammalian cells. Highly overexpressed active forms of Rab6a (Q72L mutant or wild-type) stimulate retrograde transport from post-Golgi vesicles back to the trans-Golgi network, progressively relocating Golgi residents to the ER (13Martinez O. Schmidt A. Salamero J. Hoflack B. Roa M. Goud B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1575-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 14Martinez O. Antony C. Pehau-Arnaudet G. Berger E.G. Salamero J. Goud B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1828-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we found that overexpression of a wild-type or a constitutively active form of the Rab6a protein in prion-infected N2a cells resulted in a marked enhancement of PrPSc production. Using immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation techniques, we demonstrated that overexpression of Rab6a-GTP alters the subcellular localization of PrP, shifting the protein from the cell surface to intracellular compartments including the ER. Previous investigations on intracellular trafficking of mammalian PrPC in living cells have shown that the protein, once internalized, is targeted to membranous structures close to the nucleus (27Lee K.S. Magalhaes A.C. Zanata S.M. Brentani R.R. Martins V.R. Prado M.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and reminiscent of the Golgi apparatus (28Negro A. Ballarin C. Bertoli A. Massimino M.L. Sorgato M.C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 521-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Based on the model of Rab6a function in intra-Golgi trafficking, we propose that Rab6a-GTP stimulates retrograde transport of PrP molecules within the trans-Golgi compartment toward the ER. A possible physiological retrotransport of PrPC into the ER has already been suggested. Thus, post-Golgi PrP species are mislocated into the cytosol in cells following treatment with proteasome inhibitors (20Yedidia Y. Horonchik L. Tzaban S. Yanai A. Taraboulos A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5383-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Likewise, the truncated protein PrPQ160Stop is prevented from leaving the Golgi apparatus and is transported instead to the cytosol and nucleus (29Lorenz H. Windl O. Kretzschmar H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8508-8516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This retrotransport process is believed to occur only in the ER, suggesting that PrPC, like other proteins (30Nehls S. Snapp E.L. Cole N.B. Zaal K.J. Kenworthy A.K. Roberts T.H. Ellenberg J. Presley J.F. Siggia E. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), can recycle into the ER presumably by a Rab6a-controlled pathway. It will be important to understand the intracellular retrograde pathway of PrPC during endocytosis. Expression of Rab9-GDP- and GTP-bound mutant proteins did not influence PrPScformation, 2F. Beranger, unpublished observations. arguing against a transport of PrPC from the late endosomes to the Golgi apparatus (31Lombardi D. Soldati T. Riederer M.A. Goda Y. Zerial M. Pfeffer S.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 32Barbero P. Bittova L. Pfeffer S.R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether PrPC is transported to the Golgi directly from the early endosomes, the plasma membrane, or from a lysosome downstream in the endocytic pathway. It is interesting to speculate that PrP may be transported from the cell surface to the endoplasmic reticulum through a Rab6a-regulated transport pathway. Our data are consistent with this possibility but do not directly demonstrate it. This pathway has been previously postulated (33Kopito R.R. Cell. 1997; 88: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) to be used for degradation of transmembrane proteins that have been targeted for proteasome-mediated degradation in the cytosol. Most proteins are subject to a stringent surveillance mechanism that causes retention of misfolded forms in the ER. Proteins retained in the ER are then eliminated by reverse translocation into the cytoplasm, followed by proteasome degradation. Recent data demonstrate that several misfolded mutants of PrPC are partially retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (34Ivanova L. Barmada S. Kummer T. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42409-42421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and, as well as wild-type PrPC, are degraded through the ERAD-proteasome pathway (20Yedidia Y. Horonchik L. Tzaban S. Yanai A. Taraboulos A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5383-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 21Ma J. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14955-14960Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Another hypothesis of Rab6a-induced PrPSc formation concerns the accumulation of misfolded PrPC proteins in the ER because of Rab6a-GTP expression. In non-infected N2a cells, proteasome inhibitors induce the appearance of detergent-insoluble and proteinase K-resistant PrPC. Such a PrPC form could not be detected in non-infected N2a cells overexpressing Rab6a-GTP, eliminating this possibility. Therefore, the increase of detected PrPSc in prion-infected cells expressing Rab6a wild-type or GTP-bound proteins reflects a real PrPSc conversion and not an accumulation of misfolded PrPC. The increase of PrPSc production described after stimulation of Rab6a-controled retrograde transport suggests either that a certain proportion of PrPSc remains in the ER and can induce a conformational change of retrotransported PrPCor that Rab6a-GTP stimulates PrPSc retrograde transport toward the ER, where it can seed the conversion of nascent PrPC molecules. The initial conformational change leading to PrPSc formation would then occur just after synthesis, as already suggested following the observation that mutated PrP molecules become abnormal in the ER after their synthesis (24Daude N. Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11604-11612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Gilch et al.(35) have shown recently that intracellular rerouting of prion protein prevents propagation of PrPSc. In this study, the compound Suramin completely prevented the plasma membrane localization of PrP, which was rerouted directly to acidic compartments. In the light of these data and our results, it seems that plasma membrane localization of the prion protein, followed by endocytosis and retrograde transport toward the ER, is necessary to induce conversion. If any of these pathways is blocked, either with Suramin (35Gilch S. Winklhofer K.F. Groschup M.H. Nunziante M. Lucassen R. Spielhaupter C. Muranyi W. Riesner D. Tatzelt J. Schatzl H.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3957-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), Brefeldin A (26Taraboulos A. Raeber A.J. Borchelt D.R. Serban D. Prusiner S.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), or a dominant-negative mutant of dynamin abolishing endocytosis, 3F. Beranger, unpublished observations. PrPSc formation is diminished. In several studies determining the subcellular localization of mutant PrP molecules, ER retention seems to be a common feature in experimental familial prion diseases (28Negro A. Ballarin C. Bertoli A. Massimino M.L. Sorgato M.C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 521-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 36Singh N. Zanusso G. Chen S.G. Fujioka H. Richardson S. Gambetti P.

Chem. 2000; 275: 38699-38704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Whether ER-located PrP molecules are involved in cellular neurodegeneration remains to be established. Retention of abnormal proteins in the ER is known to trigger stress response pathways (39Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar) and could explain the pathogenic effects of mutant PrPs. Furthermore, a newly describedCtmPrP, a transmembrane form of PrP that is thought to be involved in prion-induced neurodegeneration, is completely retained in the ER (40Stewart R.S. Drisaldi B. Harris D.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Multiple lines of evidence demonstrate that many pathogenic mutations interfere with normal PrP trafficking and that an abnormal retention of PrP protein in the ER may contribute to prion-induced neurodegeneration. Our results shed some light on the PrPSc conversion mechanism by showing that PrP molecules can be subjected to retrograde transport toward the ER and that stimulation of this translocation leads to an accumulation of PrPSc, demonstrating for the first time that the endoplasmic reticulum may play a role in PrPScformation.

Res. 1999; 19: 75-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), which triggers the activation of members of the JAK1 family of protein-tyrosine kinases that constitutively associate with the cytokine receptor. Subsequently, JAKs can phosphorylate tyrosine residues present in the cytoplasmic regions of the receptors. These phosphorylated tyrosines then act as docking sites for signaling molecules, such as members of the STAT family of transcription factors (6Imada K. Leonard W.J. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The intensity and duration of cytokine signaling seems to be regulated by several mechanisms. It is now known that at least three different classes of negative regulators contribute to cytokine inhibition: (i) the SH2-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatases 1 and 2 (7Tamir I. Dal Porto J.M. Cambier J.C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 8Feng G.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), (ii) the protein inhibitors of activated STATs, and (iii) the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS protein) (9Yasukawa H.

Experimental data suggest that (i) SOCS genes are induced by cytokines; (ii) SOCS molecules can inhibit cytokine signaling by binding to downstream signaling molecules such as JAK kinases (14Chen X.P.

Mice lacking SOCS-1 die shortly after birth from hepatic necrosis (18Naka T. Matsumoto T. Narazaki M. Fujimoto M. Morita Y. Ohsawa Y. Saito H. Nagasawa T. Uchiyama Y. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Data suggest that this lethality is due, at least in part, to hypersensitivity to IFN-γ signaling. SOCS-2-deficient mice seem healthy after birth but develop a much larger body than control littermates, suggesting an important role for SOCS-2 in regulating growth hormone signaling (21Metcalf D. Greenhalgh C.J. Viney E. Willson T.A. Starr R. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Alexander W.S. Nature. 2000; 405: 1069-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). SOCS-3 knock-out mice, on the other hand, die as embryos at 12–16 days and demonstrate massive erythrocytosis in the fetal liver (22Marine J.C. McKay C. Wang D. Topham D.J. Parganas E. Nakajima H.

Thus, different SOCS proteins seem to regulate, by auto-feedback inhibition, signal transduction of various cytokines in vivo. The levels of SOCS seem to be tightly regulated at the transcriptional level as well as at the posttranscriptional level (23Saito H. Morita Y. Fujimoto M. Narazaki M. Naka T. Kishimoto T. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5833-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 24Morita Y. Naka T. Kawazoe Y. Fujimoto M. Narazaki M. Nakagawa R. Fukuyama H. Nagata S. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Commun. 2000; 268: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). SOCS proteins are extremely labile, and proteasome inhibitors decrease their degradation (27Zhang J.G. Farley A. Nicholson S.E. Willson T.A. Zugaro L.M. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. Cary D. Richardson R. Hausmann G. Kile B.J. Kent S.B. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Baca M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2071-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Experiments also suggest that a domain conserved among SOCS family members, termed the SOCS box, may regulate the degradation process. This domain can interact with the Elongin B-Elongin C complex, which may regulate targeting of the SOCS proteins to the proteasome (27Zhang J.G. Farley A. Nicholson S.E. Willson T.A. Zugaro L.M. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. Cary D. Richardson R. Hausmann G. Kile B.J. Kent S.B. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Baca M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3872-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). However, studies designed to examine the importance of the SOCS box in regulating SOCS protein stability have yielded conflicting results. Therefore, the mechanism by which SOCS protein stability is regulated remains unclear. To identify proteins that regulate SOCS-1 stability, we used the yeast two-hybrid screen to identify and clone SOCS-1 interacting proteins. One of these proteins, termed TRIM8/GERP, is a RING finger protein. TRIM8/GERP is a newly described member of the so-called tripartite motif family (also known as the RBCC subclass of the RING family containing proteins) (29Reymond A. Meroni G. Fantozzi A. Merla G. Cairo S. Luzi L. Riganelli D. Zanaria E. Messali S. Cainarca S. Guffanti A. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Ballabio A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2140-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar, 30Vincent S.R. Kwasnicka D.A. Fretier P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The RBCC proteins, which include members implicated in a variety of processes, such as development and cell-growth regulation, possess two zinc-binding domains between an amino-terminal RING finger and a coiled-coil region that is immediately amino-terminal to a variable carboxyl-terminal region. We report here that TRIM8/GERP interacts with SOCS-1 and that this interaction requires the SH2 domain and the SOCS box of SOCS-1. Interestingly, coexpression of TRIM8/GERP with SOCS-1 decreases the stability and thus the levels of SOCS-1. In addition the reduced expression of SOCS-1 correlates with decreased inhibition of IFN-γ-induced JAK-STAT activation. Together, these results suggest that TRIM8/GERP may be a regulator of IFN-γ signaling. Full-length murineSOCS-1 was subcloned into the pAS2 vector (BD Clontech), and transformed into the yeast strain Y190. A murine macrophage cDNA library made in the pGADNOT vector was a gift from Steve Goff (Columbia University). Yeast transformation was carried out using the EZ yeast transformation kit from Zymo Research (Orange, CA), and yeast two-hybrid screen was conducted essentially as described by Durfee et al. (31Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). Screening of a murine pre-B full-length cDNA library was performed according to standard procedures. Briefly, 106 recombinant phages were plated using competent host and grown overnight at 37 °C. Plaques were transferred onto nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher and Schüll), fixed by UV cross-linking, and hybridized to 50% formamide, 5× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m sodium chloride, 0.015 msodium citrate), 0.02 m sodium phosphate, and 10% dextran sulfate at 42 °C for 16 h with a 32P-labeled cDNA fragment, p612, corresponding to 612 bp of the 5′ coding portion of TRIM8/GERP. Filters were subsequently washed and exposed at −80 °C for 2 days using an intensifying screen. Autoradiograms were obtained and used for phage isolation and further purification. To generate anti-TRIM8/GERP polyclonal antibodies, a recombinant expression vector containing a portion of the TRIM8/GERP cDNA was constructed as follows. First a 343-bp PstI-PstI segment from plasmid pGAD-Not50 (containing the NH2 portion of TRIM8/GERP) was cut and inserted into the PstI site of the pBlueScriptSK. Subsequently, the TRIM8/GERP portion was cut from pBS as a EcoRI-SmaI fragment and cloned in-frame into the pGST-5X isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside-inducible expression vector for generating the chimeric GST-TRIM8/GERP fusion protein. Large scale growth of competent bacteria was achieved after transformation of bacteria with the recombinant pGST-TRIM8/GERP vector, and expression of recombinant GST-TRIM8/GERP protein was induced by incubating bacteria with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside for 4 h at 37 °C. GST-TRIM8/GERP polypeptides were further purified using the glutathione Sepharose procedure, and recombinant product was separated on a protein gel for analysis and quantitation. Approximately 1 mg of GST-TRIM8/GERP proteins was used for immunization of rabbits. Plasmid p612 was obtained by inserting aBamHI-BglII 612-bp fragment from the original pGAD-NOT containing the RING domain of TRIM8/GERP into theBamHI site of the pcDNA3.1 (HisC)-Xpress-tagged vector (Invitrogen). The RING-TRIM8/GERP construct was obtained by amplifying a 240-bp segment from the TRIM8/GERP full-length cDNA template using PCR and primers, TRIM8/GERP-Bam.consF1 and R3, derived at the beginning and at +225 from the translation initiation site, respectively. Subsequently, amplified products were inserted into the pCR2.1 PCR vector (Invitrogen) and checked for proper insertion by gel analysis. Bona fide clones were cut withBamRI and inserted into the BamRI site of pcDNA3.1-HisC-Bam-RI vector linked in-frame with the Xpress epitope. RING-TRIM8/GERP was made by cutting an expressed sequence tag clone (SalI-NotI 1.3-kb cDNA) withSalI-XhoI giving a fragment of 420 bp and inserting it into the pBSSK+. Then, an EcoRI-XhoI from pBS was cut and inserted in-frame into pcDNA3.1-Xpress-tagged for functional expression. For constructs TRIM8/GERP-R5, TRIM8/GERP-R6, and TRIM8/GERP-R7, a PCR-based strategy was used employing upstream primer TRIM8/GERP-Bam-F1 and downstream primers R5, R6, and R7 located at +762, +1000, and +1292 from ATG, respectively. For mSOCS-1 constructs, an HA-tagged vector was used, except full-length and the ΔSH2-SOCS-1, which contained both HA and Xpress epitopes. ΔN-SOCS-1 (deleting residues 1–79), ΔSH2-SOCS-1 (deleting residues 80–166), and ΔC-SOCS-1 (deleting residues 167–212) were generated by PCR. Northern blot was performed as described previously (32Pelle R. Murphy N.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 21: 2783-2784Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of total RNA was fractionated in a formaldehyde-denaturing agarose gel and transferred onto Hybond nylon filters (Duralon; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Hybridization was in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 0.02 m sodium phosphate, and 10% dextran sulfate at 42 °C for 16 h with a32P-labeled probe. Briefly, human embryonic kidney 293T cells were plated at ∼10–15% confluence 1 day before transfection and cultured with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. On day 2, an appropriate amount of plasmids, with the gene of interest and 1 μg of Xpress-LacZ vector as internal control, was transfected into the cells using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. DNA was mixed into 2 mCaCl2, added to 2× Hepes-buffered saline (280 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmNa2HPO4, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.05), and let stand for 30′ at room temperature. Media were removed from the cells and the DNA precipitates were added to the cells and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Then, the precipitation mixture was diluted by adding 3.5 ml of prewarmed 10% fetal calf serum Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for the cells incubated overnight. Cells were then washed three times with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and supplemented with fresh medium for an additional 8 h before cell harvesting. For functional studies, transfections were performed in the human HeLa cell line, using the manufacturer's LipofectAMINE-plus procedure (Invitrogen). For Western blotting, cells were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed using 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.6, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1% glycerol). Protein extracts were quantified using the Bio-Rad microassay, and 40 μg of total protein was run on a denaturing protein gel and electrotransferred onto membrane. Filters were blocked with 5× bovine lacto transfer optimizer (2% nonfat dry milk, 1× Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20) and immunoblotted with 1:1000 diluted primary antibody. For immunoprecipitation experiments, 293T cells were transfected as described above. For immunoprecipitation of endogenous SOCS-1rTRIM8/GERP complexes, the murine L929 fibroblasts were used (24Morita Y. Naka T. Kawazoe Y. Fujimoto M. Narazaki M. Nakagawa R. Fukuyama H. Nagata S. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5405-5410Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Cells were washed three times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, spun down, and resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1% glycerol). Samples were left in ice for 20 min and spun down at 15,000 rpm for 15 [min]. Supernatants were recovered and precleared using 5 μl of normal serum plus 100 μl of 50% protein-G Sepharose for at least 1 h. Then, after spinning, protein concentration was evaluated with the use of a Bio-Rad kit, and 1 mg of total extracts was incubated with 5 μl of specific antibody and rocked at 4 °C for 3 h. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, resuspended with sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and loaded into SDS-PAGE. Luciferase assays were performed as described previously (33Chen X.P. Losman J.A. Cowan S. Donahue E. Fay S. Vuong B.Q. Nawijn M.C. Capece D. Cohan V.L. Rothman P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2175-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Twenty-four hours after transfection, HeLa cells were separated into two plates. One plate was cultured with human IFN-γ, and the other plate served as untreated control. Cells were harvested 18 h after treatment, and luciferase activity was measured. To identify proteins that could interact with SOCS-1, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using full-length SOCS-1 cDNA as bait. One of the clones identified contained a 612-bp cDNA insert encoding a RING finger protein. Rescreening in yeast confirmed that this interaction was specific for SOCS-1 (data not shown). To clone the full-length cDNA of the gene, this initial fragment was used to screen a murine pre-B lymphoid cDNA library. Hybridizing recombinant phages were further purified and isolated. Several recombinants were obtained that contained the 5′ end of the gene, which included 821 bp of the untranslated region and a potential ATG translation initiation site flanked by a consensus Kozak sequence. Subsequently, several murine and human expressed sequence tags, which contain sequences more 3′, were identified. No expressed sequence tags were identified that extend beyond a NotI site in the 3′ end of the gene. Therefore, we performed a 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends strategy using specific primers located 3′ at the end of the consensus and an engineered downstream primer designed to anneal to poly(dT) tails associated to an adapted oligonucleotide sequence. After PCR, we obtained several clones encompassing the NotI site and extending more 3′. The cloning and further sequencing of the products from rapid amplification of cDNA ends completed the cDNA sequence of the entire gene, which included a 700-bp 3′-untranslated region with two putative noncanonical (AGAAA) polyadenylation sites. Sequencing of the genomic locus further confirmed the sequence and structure of the gene (data not shown). The sequence of this gene turned out to be identical to that of the TRIM8/GERP gene, independently identified by two groups using a functional genomic approach, based on systematic data gathered from screening the dbEST data base, with oligonucleotides derived from conserved RING domain sequences (29Reymond A. Meroni G. Fantozzi A. Merla G. Cairo S. Luzi L. Riganelli D. Zanaria E. Messali S. Cainarca S. Guffanti A. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Ballabio A.

Commun. 2000; 279: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The TRIM8/GERP gene encoded a 551-amino acid protein (Fig. 1). Comparison of murine, rat, and human sequences (obtained by scanning the NCBI data base) revealed a 90% identity at the protein level. The carboxyl end of the protein contained a consensus nuclear localization motif (30Vincent S.R. Kwasnicka D.A. Fretier P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), whereas the amino terminus of the predicted polypeptide sequence contained a canonical RING motif. The TRIM8/GERP RING domain spanned 41 amino acids with canonical consensus residues, along with cysteine/histidine contrapositions similar to other C2H2 category RING fingers (29Reymond A. Meroni G. Fantozzi A. Merla G. Cairo S. Luzi L. Riganelli D. Zanaria E. Messali S. Cainarca S. Guffanti A. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Ballabio A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2140-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar, 30Vincent S.R. Kwasnicka D.A. Fretier P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). C2H2 RING finger proteins have been implicated in a wide range of biological processes, including the regulation of protein stability (for review, see Ref. 34Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar). Northern blotting demonstrated that TRIM8/GERP was expressed in many murine tissues including heart, brain, lung, liver, muscle, thymus, and spleen (Fig. 2). Highest expression was noted in heart, liver, and thymus. To determine whether the expression of TRIM8/GERP was regulated, different cell lines were stimulated with IFN-γ, and expression of TRIM8/GERP was examined by Northern blotting. TRIM8/GERP mRNA could be induced by IFN-γ in murine B lymphoid M12 cells, murine fibroblasts, and HeLa cells (Fig. 2 and data not shown). These data demonstrate that TRIM8/GERP was expressed in many tissues and its expression could be further induced by IFN-γ. To further define the interaction between SOCS-1 and TRIM8/GERP, the ability of recombinant TRIM8/GERP and SOCS proteins to interact in mammalian cells was analyzed. An expression vector containing the cDNA encoding the amino-terminal 204 amino acids of TRIM8/GERP, along with the Xpress epitope, was overexpressed in 293T cells along with vectors expressing different SOCS proteins (tagged with HA epitope). The interaction of these proteins was then analyzed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. When SOCS-1 (HA) was immunoprecipitated, TRIM8/GERP coimmunoprecipitated with it (Fig.3 A, lane 5). Note that SOCS-1 is tagged with Xpress and HA and is seen as the slower migrating band above TRIM8/GERP in lane 5. In contrast, TRIM8/GERP did not coimmunoprecipitate with either SOCS-2 or SOCS-3 (lanes 6 and 7). The specific interaction between TRIM8/GERP and SOCS-1 was confirmed when the reciprocal experiment was performed (data not shown). These data demonstrate that SOCS-1 and TRIM8/GERP specifically interacted when coexpressed in mammalian cells. To detect endogenous TRIM8/GERP protein in the cells, the murine L929 fibroblast cells were treated for 30 min with 800 units/ml IFN-γ (Fig. 3 B, lane 2). LLnL, a specific proteasome inhibitor, was also added alone (Fig. 3 B, lane 3), immediately before (Fig. 3 B, lane 5) or after (Fig. 3 B, lane 4) IFN-γ treatment. The cells were then lysed and subject to immunoprecipitation using an anti-SOCS-1 antibody (33Chen X.P. Losman J.A. Cowan S. Donahue E. Fay S. Vuong B.Q. Nawijn M.C. Capece D. Cohan V.L. Rothman P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2175-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Although SOCS-1 was present constitutively in L929 cells, the association between SOCS-1 and TRIM8/GERP was evident only upon IFN-γ treatment (Fig. 3 B, lane 2) and was further enhanced when LLnL was added after a 30-min treatment with IFN-γ. These data demonstrate the interaction between endogenous SOCS-1 and TRIM8/GERP proteins. To further define the region of TRIM8/GERP required for the association with SOCS-1, SOCS-1 was coexpressed with various mutants of TRIM8/GERP: the amino-terminal 204 amino acids alone (TRIM8/GERP(204AA)), the amino-terminal 204 amino acids without the RING motif (TRIM8/GERP-ΔRING), or the RING motif alone (TRIM8/GERP-RING) (Fig. 3 C). SOCS-1 was immunoprecipitated with HA, and coimmunoprecipitation of TRIM8/GERP was determined by Western blotting (Xpress) (Fig. 3 D). Both the TRIM8/GERP(204AA) (lane 4) and the TRIM8/GERP-ΔRING (lane 6) interacted with SOCS-1, whereas the RING motif alone did not (lane 5). These data indicate that the RING motif is not essential for the interaction of TRIM8/GERP with SOCS-1, and that the region immediately carboxyl-terminal to the RING motif is sufficient to mediate this interaction. SOCS-1 contains several structural motifs important for its function. The SH2 domain was required for SOCS-1 interaction with the JAK kinases. The SOCS box motif has been shown to interact with the Elongin B/C complex , which may regulate stability of SOCS-1 protein. To determine the domains of SOCS-1 required for the interaction with TRIM8/GERP, TRIM8/GERP (Xpress-tagged) was coexpressed with different deletion mutants of SOCS-1 (HA). The different SOCS-1 proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA and coimmunoprecipitation of TRIM8/GERP was examined (Fig. 3 E). TRIM8/GERP was coimmunoprecipitated with the SOCS-1 lacking the amino terminus (lane 7). In contrast, SOCS-1 lacking the SOCS box or the SH2 domain did not coimmunoprecipitate with TRIM8/GERP (lanes 5 and 6). Note that ΔSΗ2-SOCS-1 was both HA- and Xpress-tagged and is detected in lane 5. These data suggest that both the SOCS box and the SH2 domain are required for the interaction between SOCS-1 and TRIM8/GERP. Full-length TRIM8/GERP protein expression was barely detectable by Western blotting (Fig. 4, lane 6). Deletion mutants of TRIM8/GERP, however, could be efficiently expressed in 293T cells (Fig. 4). Transfection of recombinants bearing longer portions of the TRIM8/GERP gene resulted in a gradual decrease of expression levels (Fig. 4). These data suggest that the carboxyl region of TRIM8/GERP contains motifs that alter its expression. To determine the half-life of TRIM8/GERP protein, cells transfected with the short form of TRIM8/GERP, TRIM8/GERP(204AA), were grown in the absence or presence of cycloheximide. The levels of TRIM8/GERP over time were examined by Western blotting (Fig.5). TRIM8/GERP was extremely unstable and was rapidly eliminated from the cells (Fig. 5, lanes 9–12). These data indicate that TRIM8/GERP is an extremely labile protein.Figure 5TRIM8/GERP(204AA)accelerates the degradation of SOCS-1. 293T cells were transfected with SOCS-1 and TRIM8/GERP(204AA) either alone or together. LacZ was included as an internal control. Cells were treated with cycloheximide as described previously (33Chen X.P. Losman J.A. Cowan S. Donahue E. Fay S. Vuong B.Q. Nawijn M.C. Capece D. Cohan V.L. Rothman P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2175-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Lysates of cells harvested at different time points after cycloheximide treatment was subject to Western blotting with anti-Xpress antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) RING finger proteins such as Cbl are thought to function as ubiquitin ligases, which regulate protein stability. The presence of a RING motif in TRIM8/GERP and its inherent instability raise the possibility that TRIM8/GERP may function to regulate the stability of other proteins. To examine this possibility, TRIM8/GERP and SOCS-1 were cotransfected into 293T cells. The cells were then cultured in the absence or presence of cycloheximide to inhibit new protein synthesis and the stability of SOCS-1 examined by Western blotting. When TRIM8/GERP was expressed with SOCS-1, the levels of SOCS-1 were decreased (Fig. 5). In addition, the stability of SOCS-1 was decreased when it was coexpressed with TRIM8/GERP (Fig. 5). This was also evident by transfecting increasing amount of TRIM8/GERP(204AA) along with SOCS-1 in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). These data suggest that TRIM8/GERP can regulate SOCS-1 protein levels. Expression of TRIM8/GERP is induced by IFN-γ. Furthermore, SOCS-1 has been shown to be an inhibitor of IFN-γ signaling. These data raise the question of whether TRIM8/GERP can affect the function of SOCS-1. To address this question, we examined the ability of TRIM8/GERP to alter the IFN-γ-mediated induction of transcription from the IFN-γ-responsive GAS element. This element is found in the promoter of many IFN-γ-inducible genes and binds homodimers of Stat1 (35Williams B.R.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). SOCS-1 has been shown to inhibit transcription driven by this element through inhibition of JAK-STAT activation. HeLa cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter construct driven by upstream GAS elements. When cells were stimulated with IFN-γ, luciferase activity was induced by more than 500-fold (Fig. 6). As previously reported, when an expression vector containing SOCS-1 was cotransfected, the induction of luciferase activity was greatly inhibited. Interestingly, when increasing amounts of an expression vector containing TRIM8/GERP was transfected along with SOCS-1 and the GAS reporter, the inhibition of luciferase activity by SOCS-1 could be reversed in a dose-dependent manner. These data suggest that TRIM8/GERP can inhibit SOCS-1 function. In this report, we present evidence that TRIM8/GERP, previously identified as a new member of the RING finger B-box coiled-coil subclass of the RING family, is capable of specifically binding SOCS-1. SOCS proteins work as cytoplasmic inhibitors of signaling triggered by cytokine/receptor interactions. One of the predominant features of SOCS-1 has been the stringent regulation of SOCS-1 expression at multiple levels: (i) SOCS-1 mRNA is present at low levels in resting cells, and stimulation of cells by a variety of signals, including cytokines and cross-linking of antigen receptors, induces transcription of SOCS-1 mRNA; (ii) SOCS-1 mRNA stability is also regulated; (iii) initiation of translation is another mechanism by which the protein levels of SOCS-1 are regulated. We and others have demonstrated that SOCS-1 protein seems to be constitutively degraded by the proteasomes. Prior work has suggested that degradation of SOCS-1 can be regulated by binding (via the SOCS box domain) to Elongin B and C (28Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3872-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Here we have identified another protein involved in the regulation of SOCS-1 stability, TRIM8/GERP. We demonstrated that the TRIM8/GERP protein could bind to SOCS-1 in coimmunoprecipitation assays and that TRIM8/GERP could modulate SOCS-1-mediated suppression of cytokine signaling. As shown by coimmunoprecipitation in Fig. 3, exogenously expressed TRIM8/GERP specifically bound SOCS-1 but not other members of the SOCS family (i.e. SOCS-2 and SOCS-3). In addition, the RING portion of TRIM8/GERP was not required for binding SOCS-1, suggesting that the interaction domain resides along the B box coiled-coil region of the protein. By contrast, the interaction between SOCS-1 and TRIM8/GERP seemed to require both the SOCS box and the SH2 domain. It has previously been shown that SOCS-1 binds JAK kinases in an SH2-dependent manner. The mechanism by which SOCS-1 inhibited JAK-STAT signaling is unclear. SOCS-1 may have simply bound JAK kinases and prevented access of interacting proteins and/or ATP to the catalytic pocket. Alternatively, SOCS-1 might target activated JAK kinases to protein degradation, similar to what has been shown for TEL-JAK (36Kamzono S. Hanada T. Yasukawa H. Minoguchi S. Kato R. Minoguchi M. Hattori K. Hatakeyama S. Yada M. Morita S. Kitamura T. Kato H. Nakayama K. Yoshimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12530-12538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). It is possible that the binding of TRIM8/GERP to the SH2 domain of SOCS-1 altered the ability of SOCS-1 to interact with JAK kinases. In addition, binding of TRIM8/GERP to the SOCS box might alter the interaction between SOCS-1 and other components of the degradation machinery, which might result in altered function and/or protein stability of SOCS-1. We showed that coexpression of TRIM8/GERP and SOCS-1 in 293T cells increased the turnover of both proteins, suggesting that stability may be affected by their interaction. It is interesting that the conserved B-box coiled-coil domain of TRIM8/GERP was sufficient for efficient interaction with SOCS-1, suggesting that the RING domain may bind to other proteins. Recent reports have identified a subclass of RING finger proteins containing the RING CH2CH signature motif, which may be part of a ubiquitin-ligase (37Tyers M. Willems A.R. Science. 1999; 284: 601-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 38Borden K.L.B. Freemont P.S. Curr. Opin. Struct.

A. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). In our study, several lines of evidence suggest that TRIM8/GERP might play such a role. First, the carboxyl-terminal portion of TRIM8/GERP had C domains that principally affect its protein stability. Second, the NH2 portion of TRIM8/GERP had features that resemble other ubiquitin-ligase components. Finally, coexpression of TRIM8/GERP and SOCS-1 drastically decreased the stability of SOCS-1 in vitro. Definition of TRIM8/GERP as a new member of the RBCC subclass of RING protein also suggests a putative role in cellular transformation and differentiation. Several RBCC members, including PML (40Kakizuka A. Miller Jr., B.H. Umesono K. Warrell Jr., R.P. Frankel S.R. Murty V.V. Dmitrovsky E. Evans R.M.

The humanTRIM8/GERP gene is ubiquitously expressed in adult tissues and in a variety of tumors, including anaplastic oligodendroglioma and maps at chromosome 10q24.3 within a region mostly involved in deletions and rearrangements in human glioblastoma, raising the possibility that the gene may be involved in the pathogenesis of such a tumor. Another point relevant for the function of TRIM8/GERP/SOCS-1 interaction was the capacity of TRIM8/GERP to modulate the inhibitory function of SOCS-1 in an IFN-γ biological response. As shown in HeLa cells transfected with a GAS-Luc reporter vector (Fig. 6), the exogenous coexpression of SOCS-1 and a RBCC-TRIM8/GERP mutant partially restored the IFN-γ-mediated induction of luciferase, which was inhibited by the deregulated expression of SOCS-1. Such data stress a putative role for TRIM8/GERP in inhibiting SOCS-1 function in vivo by binding and targeting it to proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, several studies have already indicated that most RING proteins function as ubiquitin-ligases involved in the protein degradation machinery. However, more detailed analysis of SOCS-1/TRIM8/GERP interactions will be necessary to determine whether both proteins act as a single functional entity or may involve additional proteins.

In this study, we examined the role of ERK-1 in the regulation of MMP-9 production and the invasive behavior of the human glioblastoma cell line SNB19, in which ERK1 is constitutively activated. SNB19 cells were stably transfected with mt-ERK, a vector encoding ERK-1 cDNA in which the conserved lysine at codon 71 was changed to arginine, thus impairing the catalytic efficiency of this enzyme. Gelatin zymography showed reduced levels of MMP-9 in the mt-ERK-transfected cell lines relative to those in vector-transfected and parental control cells. Reductions in MMP-9 protein mRNA levels were also detected in the mt-ERK-transfected cells by Western and Northern blotting. The mt-ERK-transfected cells were much less invasive than parental or vector control cells in a Matrigel invasion assay and in a spheroid coculture assay. Thus an ERK-dependent signaling pathway seems to regulate MMP-9 mediated glioma invasion in SNB19 cells; interfering with this pathway could be developed into a therapeutic approach, which aims at a reduction of cancer cell invasion."

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 81-85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Active PFL, a homodimer (2 × 759 residues), is generated from the non-radical form by the removal of the pro-S Cα hydrogen of Gly-734, which is catalyzed by PFL-activase (12Frey M. Rothe M. Wagner A.F.V. Knappe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12432-12437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PFL catalyzes the reversible conversion of pyruvate and CoA into acetyl-CoA and formate, which has a central role in anaerobic glucose fermentation by Escherichia coli and other bacteria. The reaction divides into two half-reactions involving an acetyl-enzyme intermediate (E + pyruvate = acetyl-E + formate; acetyl-E + CoA = E + acetyl-CoA). The main participants in the reaction include Gly-734 for radical storage and a site carrying the acetyl intermediate consisting of two adjacent cysteinyl residues, Cys-418 and Cys-419. The glycyl radical is thought to generate a thiyl radical at Cys-418/419 needed for homolytic substrate cleavage. The recently reported (10Becker A. Fritz-Wolf K. Kabsch W. Knappe J. Schultz S. Wagner A.F.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 969-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) structure of PFL (non-radical form) in complex with oxamate, an isosteric and chemically inert analog of pyruvate, shows the close spatial proximity of the catalytic triad Gly-734, Cys-419, Cys-418 that could accommodate direct radical transfers from Gly-734 to Cys-418 via Cys-419. Oxamate fits into a compact pocket where its carboxamide C is juxtaposed with Cys-418 Sγ (3.3 Å). Based on the structure and biochemical information, along with theoretical data (13Himo F. Eriksson L.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 11449-11455Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar), a mechanism was proposed (10Becker A. Fritz-Wolf K. Kabsch W. Knappe J. Schultz S. Wagner A.F.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 969-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) that involves the following steps (Fig. 1 a). First half-reaction: pyruvate binding triggers generation of the Cys-418 thiyl radical by hydrogen transfer from Cys-418 S–H via Cys-419 to the glycyl radical; thiyl addition to the carbonyl C of pyruvate produces the tetrahedral oxyradical intermediate, which collapses into the acetyl thioester of Cys-418 and the formyl radical; the formyl radical is quenched to formate by the SH of Cys-419, thus producing the 419 thiyl. Second half-reaction: 419 thiyl generates the thiyl radical of CoA; the radical is replaced with the 418-linked acetyl resulting in acetyl-CoA.Figure 1Mechanism and structure of PFL.a, stages 1–7 of the proposed (10Becker A.

Elbert S. Frey M. Wagner A.F.V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 731-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) assumed the formation of a thiohemiketal between pyruvate and one of the active site cysteines. This possibility could not be ruled out by the available structure (10Becker A. Fritz-Wolf K. Kabsch W. Knappe J. Schultz S. Wagner A.F.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 969-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), as it contained the inert oxamate, which is principally unable to form a thiohemiketal-like compound. Moreover, the reported structures did not provide information on the binding site of the cosubstrate CoA/acetyl-CoA, since PFL shows no relationship to known folds of CoA binding proteins (15Engel C. Wierenga R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We describe here the crystal structures of the non-radical form of PFL from E. coli in complex with pyruvate, with pyruvate and CoA, and for comparison, with oxamate and CoA. The new data support our view of the catalytic cycle (Fig.1 a) and show the binding site of the cosubstrate CoA for the first time. PFL was isolated from overproducingE. coli cells using strain 234M1 transformed with the expression vector p153E1 as described (16Knappe J. Wagner A.F.V.

By comparison with PFL+pyr+CoA, refined at 1.53 Å, a minor error in the starting model was discovered and corrected by a peptide flip of residue Gly-433 (distance (Gly-433, Cys-418 Sγ) = 11 Å). Since the monoclinic structures are highly isomorphic, the structure of PFL+oxa+CoA could be obtained from PFL+pyr+CoA by the F o(1)− F o(2) difference Fourier technique. The same technique was applied to solve PFL+pyr by comparison with the re-refined structure PFL+oxa.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55767) Google Scholar). The alignment shows 155 strictly conserved residues. Structure factor amplitudes and model coordinates for PFL+pyr+CoA, PFL+oxa+CoA, and PFL+pyr have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession codes 1h16, 1h17, and1h18, respectively). We have determined by x-ray crystallography the structure of PFL in complex with both of its substrates CoA and pyruvate at 1.53-Å resolution (R free = 16.3%; coordinate error = 0.13 Å). In addition, we have solved the structure of PFL in complex with pyruvate at 2.3 Å resolution and of PFL with CoA and oxamate at 1.75 Å resolution. All atoms of the structures, except for the four N-terminal residues and very few side chains, were clearly defined by the electron densities. No significant differences in the protein atomic coordinates between these new and the previously reported (10Becker A. Fritz-Wolf K. Kabsch W. Knappe J. Schultz S. Wagner A.F.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 969-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) structures of PFL were detected. Crystallographic data and refinement statistics are compiled in Table I. The structure of PFL+pyr+CoA is depicted in Fig.1 b. Unique positions for the pyruvate atoms were obtained from the 2F o − F celectron density map of PFL+pyr+CoA computed without the pyruvate atoms. Pyruvate binds exclusively in the active site of each protomer (Fig. 2 a) with temperature factors of the same magnitude as those of the surrounding protein atoms. Details of the binding mode of pyruvate are summarized in Fig.2 c. The carbonyl C of pyruvate lies 2.6 Å from Cys-418 Sγ, which is less than the van der Waals distance and indicates the formation of a weak bond. However, no significant deviations from planarity at the carbonyl C could be detected. Apparently, pyruvate does not form a thiohemiketal with PFL in the crystal structure. Analysis of the PFL+oxa+CoA data set (Table I) revealed that oxamate binds in the active site of PFL in a mode similar to that of pyruvate (Fig. 2, b and c). Oxamate is an isosteric and chemically inert analog of pyruvate (NH2 replaces the CH3 of pyruvate) and was used in a previous study (10Becker A. Fritz-Wolf K. Kabsch W. Knappe J. Schultz S. Wagner A.F.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 969-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) to mimic the pyruvate substrate. Not unexpectedly, we found in our new highly isomorphic structures, PFL+pyr+CoA and PFL+oxa+CoA, that the differences between equivalent pyruvate and oxamate atomic coordinates are small and amount to a root mean square of 0.46 Å. Allowing for a rigid body rotation and translation (26Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1978; 34: 827-828Crossref Scopus (917) Google Scholar), oxamate and pyruvate could be superimposed with a root mean square of 0.11 Å. Oxamate is slightly rotated (6°) with respect to pyruvate and translated by 0.4 Å away from Cys-418 so that its carboxamide C atom is found at a distance of 3.0 Å from Cys-418 Sγ. The small differences in the binding distances for pyruvate and oxamate are statistically significant and not artifacts caused by stereochemical restraints of the refinement procedure. This was confirmed by theF o(1) −F o(2) difference Fourier technique using the refined PFL+pyr+CoA structure without pyruvate for phase calculation. The same small differences between the pyruvate and oxamate binding modes were found by comparison of the PFL+pyr (Table I) with the re-refined PFL+oxa structures. Moreover these structures, when compared with their corresponding CoA-containing ones, displayed no significant differences. This excludes the possibility that the binding of CoA caused the observed differences between pyruvate and oxamate interactions with atoms in the active site. A unique location for each CoA atom was obtained from the 2F o − F cdensity map of the PFL+pyr+CoA structure computed without the CoA atoms (Fig. 3 a). One CoA molecule binds to the surface of each protomer near the subunit-subunit interface of the PFL dimer (Figs. 1 b and 3, a andb). The adenine moiety is located at a distance of 15 Å from the active site with the adenine plane normal pointing toward the protein center. CoA assumes a syn glycosidic torsion angle with the pantetheine chain extending away from the active site toward the opposing monomer where the thiol of CoA is found at a distance of ≈30 Å from both active sites. The synconformation of CoA seen in our structure is rather unusual and has been observed only in the structure of the acyl-CoA-responsive transcription factor FadR (27van Aalte D.M.F. DiRusso C.C. Knudsen J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2041-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank entry 1h9g). The binding site for the adenine of CoA comprises Phe-149, Asn-145, and Gln-146 of a short α-helix (Fig. 3, a and b). Phe-149 and Asn-145 are strictly conserved. Remarkably, one side of the phenyl ring of Phe-149 is entirely exposed to solvent in all CoA-free structures. Upon CoA binding, the phenyl ring makes stacking interactions with the imidazole ring of adenine, while Asn-145 and Gln-146 fix the adenine amino group by hydrogen bonds. The interactions of adenine with this site contribute significantly to the binding of CoA. This view is supported by our finding that the adenine base of 5′-deoxyadenosine binds in exactly the same mode to this site, while the ribose remains flexible (structural data not shown). The ribose of CoA adopts the 2′-endo conformation. It is fixed by salt bridges between the 3′- and 5′-phosphates with Lys-161 and a weak hydrogen bond of the ring oxygen with the strictly conserved Arg-160. The pantetheine hydroxyl and the two amide nitrogens form hydrogen bonds to a strongly bound water molecule and the main chain carbonyl oxygens of Phe-149 and Asp-150. The thiol group is located in a predominantly hydrophobic pocket formed by the side chains of residues Phe-200, His-227, Leu-197, and Ala-224 of the opposing monomer. Analysis of the PFL+oxa+CoA data set by theF o(1) −F o(2) difference Fourier technique revealed that CoA binds in exactly the same way, since no significant difference density near the CoA binding site was found. Replacing pyruvate with oxamate in the active site has no influence on CoA binding. An earlier proposal for the first half-reaction of the PFL mechanism (14Knappe J. Elbert S. Frey M. Wagner A.F.V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 731-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 16Knappe J. Wagner A.F.V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 258: 343-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) assumed the initial formation of a thiohemiketal between pyruvate and the active site Cys-419. The reaction was thought to proceed by attack of the Cys-418 thiyl radical on the carboxylate C resulting in pyruvate cleavage. The formation of a thiohemiketal was inferred from gel filtration experiments at 4 °C which showed a [14C]pyruvate adduct to the non-radical form of PFL (14Knappe J. Elbert S. Frey M. Wagner A.F.V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 731-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Recent structural work on PFL in complex with oxamate (10Becker A. Fritz-Wolf K. Kabsch W. Knappe J. Schultz S. Wagner A.F.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 969-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) has led to a new view of the PFL mechanism (Fig. 1 a) that precludes thiohemiketal formation and assigns roles to the active site cysteines that differ from the earlier proposal. The new view was based on the assumption that pyruvate would display the same binding mode as the substrate analog oxamate. However, in contrast to pyruvate, oxamate is principally unable to form a thiohemiketal-like compound and for this reason the structural data were insufficient to rule out alternatives to the new view that might involve the formation of a thiohemiketal. The PFL+pyr and PFL+pyr+CoA structures described here are consistent with the new mechanistic proposal. The binding mode of pyruvate is very similar to that of oxamate. Moreover, pyruvate does not form a thiohemiketal, since the molecule does not display any significant deviations from planarity of its carbonyl group despite the close proximity of the carbonyl C to Cys-418 Sγ (Fig. 2 a). Apparently, pyruvate is tightly bound in the active site forming a kinetically stable complex with PFL, which could well explain the outcome of the gel filtration experiments (14Knappe J. Elbert S. Frey M. Wagner A.F.V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 731-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The PFL+pyr and PFL+pyr+CoA structures indicate a weak bond between the C2 of pyruvate and the Sγ of Cys-418 thiol (bond length 2.6 Å), reminiscent of a launched nucleophilic attack on C2. In the radical form of PFL this attack would proceed upon hydrogen abstraction from Cys-418 thiol by Cys-419 thiyl. In the non-radical form the attack cannot proceed. The crystal structures are suggestive of a snapshot of a point on the reaction coordinate when the radical has moved from its storage location at Gly-734 to Cys-419, leaving Gly-734 Cα as a sp3 carbon (Fig. 1 a, boxed state). At this point the only difference between the radical and non-radical forms of PFL is the absence of a single hydrogen atom at Cys-419 Sγ in the enzyme. Thus, the PFL+pyr and PFL+pyr+CoA crystal structures provide excellent approximations to the corresponding radical enzyme-substrate complexes at the moment prior to generation of the Cys-418 thiyl. The observed structure of the active site, which is identical in the PFL+pyr and PFL+pyr+CoA crystals, is consistent with the radical mechanism of the first half reaction: 1) pyruvate is bound in the active site displaying its planar C2 (sp2) at sub-van der Waals distance to the Sγ of Cys-418 (Fig. 2). The active site is designed to fix pyruvate in a position that prevents the formation of a thiohemiketal (implying a tetrahedral sp3configuration at C2), which would render hydrogen abstraction from Cys-418 thiol impossible (2Knappe J. Neugebauer F.A. Blaschkowski H.P. Gänzler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1332-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The thiol of CoA in the PFL+pyr+CoA structure is located outside of the active site. Thus, besides the catalytic residues, there is no radical quenching group present in the active site that could interfere with pyruvate cleavage or lead to a loss of the radical. Consistent with biochemical data, our structures show that the presence of CoA is not required for pyruvate cleavage. If CoA is present during the first half-reaction, it binds in a waiting mode. Upon completion of the first half-reaction PFL must undergo some structural change that allows the thiol of CoA to reach the active site to pick up the acetyl from Cys-418. This requires a new binding mode for the ribose-pantetheine moiety of CoA that differs from that observed in the PFL+pyr+CoA structure. An approximate model for the new CoA binding mode could be obtained if one rotates the ribose-pantetheine moiety around theN-glycosidic bond. This could be visualized as a “fishing model” in which the angler (adenine) stands on a platform (Phe-149 and Asp-150) and moves the fishing rod (ribose-pantetheine moiety rotating from the syn to the anti conformation) through the air (solvent) into the water (protein) so that the hook (CoA thiol) catches the fish (acetyl at Cys-418). Indeed, as shown by model calculations, the ribose-pantetheine moiety can freely rotate through the solvent around the N-glycosidic bond from the unusual syn to the anti conformation so that the thiol reaches the active site (Figs. 1 c and 3 c). Since 5′-O-phosphorylated adenine nucleotides like CoA prefer the anti conformation in solution, thesyn/anti transition is favored by a gain in free energy. Presumably, the strictly conserved Arg-160 supports this transition by forming a new salt bridge with the pyrophosphate of CoA in the anti conformation. Moreover, the modeled new binding mode for CoA involves predominantly conserved residues and requires only moderate conformational changes of PFL that do not disrupt secondary structure. We expect that the new CoA binding site formed upon completion of the first half-reaction also allows for binding of a free CoA molecule (anti conformation) that approaches from solution, by-passing the waiting position seen in the crystal structure. The fixed binding site for the adenine of CoA throughout the reaction cycle proposed here is consistent with biochemical findings (28Becker, A., Towards the Three-dimensional Structure of Pyruvate Formate-Lyase. Crystallization of the Protein and Search for Heavy Atom Derivatives-Photoaffinity Labeling Using S-ethyl-(8-azido)CoA.Ph.D. thesis, 1995, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.Google Scholar) thatS-ethyl-(8-azido)-CoA and S-ethyl-(8-amino)-CoA, which prefer the syn conformation due to their bulky substituents at the C8 position, are competitive inhibitors (K I values 0.035 and 0.2 mm, respectively) of acetyl-CoA (K m = 0.05 mm (29Knappe J. Blaschkowski H.P. Gröbner P. Schmitt T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 50: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar)). This means that the CoA binding site in the radical form of PFL overlaps with that of the inhibitors. Taken together our structural data strongly support the proposed radical mechanism (Fig. 1 a) for the first half-cycle, provide clear evidence for the adenine binding site of CoA, and suggest how the thiol of CoA could reach the active site, formally replacing formate. It remains undecided by our data whether the presence of the acetyl at Cys-418, the release of formate, or the Cα configuration of Gly-734 (sp2) triggers formation of the new binding mode for the ribose-pantetheine moiety required for the second half-reaction. Our finding that CoA may adopt a waiting position ready to get involved after pyruvate cleavage is consistent with the indirect group transfer of PFL (ping-pong) mechanism. This could contribute to optimizing the enzyme for the synthesis of acetyl-CoA, a key compound in numerous biochemical pathways.

Hrycyna C.A. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 361-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar). In animals, Pgp plays an important role in excretion of and protection from environmental toxins; when expressed in the plasma membrane of cancer cells, it can lead to failure of chemotherapy by preventing the hydrophobic chemotherapeutic drugs from reaching their targets inside cells (4Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3551) Google Scholar). Pgp is a member of the superfamily of ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins (1Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3349) Google Scholar, 5Holland I.B. Blight M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 381-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). ABC transporters typically consist of four domains, two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) located in the cytoplasm and two transmembrane domains (TMDs) responsible for binding and transport of transport substrates and/or drugs. Pgp contains in the order of 1280 amino acid residues, and the arrangement of the domains in the primary sequence is: TMD1-NBD1-TMD2-NBD2. The N- and C-terminal halves of Pgp show strong sequence homology to each other and in bacterial ABC transporters, the functional domains are often composed of pairs of identical separate polypeptides. There is firm evidence that the two nucleotide binding sites function in a strongly cooperative mechanism to bind and hydrolyze ATP in an alternating mode, effectively coupling drug transport to the collapse of the transition state in one of the NBDs (6Senior A.E., Al- Shawi M.K.

However, no atomic resolution structural information is available for Pgp. Three-dimensional models of Pgp obtained from electron microscopic images of detergent-solubilized single enzyme molecules (16Rosenberg M.F. Callaghan R. Ford R.C. Higgins C.F. J. Biol.

Such a structure would support the “vacuum cleaner” mechanistic model of Pgp, which predicts that drugs to be exported are initially bound from the interior leaflet of the lipid bilayer rather than from the aqueous cytosol (18Higgins C.F. Gottesman M.M. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 18-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Refined structural pictures for two full-length ABC transporters from Escherichia coli have recently been reported for the lipid A flippase, MsbA, (19Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) and for the vitamin B12 importer, BtuCD (20Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). MsbA shares more than 30% of its primary sequence with Pgp, and the similarity is spread over both the transmembrane and nucleotide binding domains. The 4.5-Å x-ray structure of MsbA shows the identical halves of the protein arranged in a V-shaped structure, with the periplasmic ends of the TMDs interacting and the cytoplasmic nucleotide binding domains as far as 50 Å apart. The x-ray model of MsbA shows that its TMDs contain six bilayer-spanning α-helices, and this membrane topology is also predicted for Pgp. The arrangement of the functional domains is quite different in the 3.2-Å resolution model of BtuCD that shows the two nucleotide binding subunits (BtuD) in close contact with each other, giving the protein a much more compact appearance. However, BtuCD cannot be considered a close homolog to Pgp. The very limited sequence similarity between the two proteins is concentrated around the functional regions in the NBDs with no significant similarity in the membrane domains. Indeed, the TMDs of this transporter (BtuC) contain a total of 10 membrane-bound α-helices. None of these crystallographic studies, however, shows the protein in its native environment, the lipid bilayer. Here we report the projection structure of mouse Pgp at 22 Å resolution, obtained from electron microscopic analysis of two-dimensional crystals of the protein reconstituted in a lipid bilayer by the lipid monolayer technique. The structure of Pgp shows two closely interacting domains that can be interpreted as the N- and C-terminal halves of the transporter. Comparison of the projection structure of Pgp with the x-ray structures of MsbA and BtuCD indicates that in lipid-bound Pgp the nucleotide binding domains are in close contact. The implications of this structure of Pgp with respect to its proposed mechanism are discussed. Pgp (mouse MDR3) containing a C-terminal His6 tag and three mutations (Asn to Gln) at potential glycosylation positions 83, 87, and 90 was expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified to homogeneity as described (21Lerner-Marmarosh N.

All lipids including DOGS-NiNTA were from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.n-Dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DM) was from Anatrace Inc. Amphipol A8–75 was synthesized as described (23Tribet C. Audebert R. Popot J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1996; 93: 15047-15050Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Pgp was bound to Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) and washed on the column with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.02% amphipol A8–75 to exchange DM with amphipol. Pgp was then eluted in the same buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. For native gels, 1% agarose in 10 mm Tris, 100 mm glycine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, adjusted to pH 7, with acetic acid was used. The verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity of Pgp in the presence of a 2-fold excess (w/w) ofE. coli lipids and 8 mm dithiothreitol was tested for each preparation before crystallization and was ∼4–5 units/mg when measured in an ATP regenerating assay (24Urbatsch I.L.

For two-dimensional crystallization, a Teflon block was used as described in Levy et al. (25Levy D. Mosser G. Lambert O. Moeck G.S. Bald D. Rigaud J.-L. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 127: 44-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A variety of crystallization conditions were tested with the following giving the most consistent results. 0.5 μl of a 0.1 mg/ml lipid solution in hexane containing NiNTA-DOGS/EggPC in a ratio of 1:4 was spread on 60 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8, and allowed to incubate for 12 h at 4 °C. Pgp, which had been incubated for 12 h at 4 °C at a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml in the same buffer in the presence of 0.2% DM, with or without additional lipid (EggPC), was injected into the lipid monolayer covered drop via the side channel to give a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml protein and 0.02% DM. The mixture was allowed to incubate at room temperature for 1 h while being stirred with small pieces of nickel wire on a magnetic stirrer. The Teflon block was then transferred to 37 °C, and about 10 BioBeads SM2 (Bio-Rad) were added through the side channel. Incubation was continued for another 24 h at 37 °C (with a second addition of BioBeads after 6 h). Crystals were transferred to carbon-coated copper grids by touching the surface of the drops and negatively stained with 0.5–1% uranyl acetate. Analysis of the protein in the crystallization solution by SDS-PAGE revealed that no significant degradation of the protein takes place during the time periods of the incubation (not shown). Grids were examined in a Philips CM300 transmission electron microscope operating at 100 kV. Electron micrographs were recorded in low dose mode with a 1024 × 1024 pixel charge-coupled device (CCD, Gatan Inc.) or on Kodak SO163 film that was developed in full-strength Kodak D19 developer at room temperature for 12 min. Images were recorded at an electron optical magnification of ×35,000 or 47,000 with defocus settings of −384 and −576 nm, placing the first zero of the contrast transfer function between 1/18 and 1/23 Å−1. Electron micrographs (×35,000) were digitized on an Optronics ColorGetter Plus at a sampling rate of 18.75 μm corresponding to 5.3 Å on the specimen scale. The pixel size was calibrated using two-dimensional crystals of bacteriorhodopsin embedded in 1% glucose as external standard (a = b = 62Å). Images were analyzed with the IMAGIC 5 software package (26van Heel M. Harauz G. Orlova E.V Schmidt R. Schatz M. J. Struct.

Crystalline patches that showed a power spectrum consistent with a single crystalline layer or two clearly distinct layers were excised as square images and band pass-filtered to remove low (<0.01 Å−1) and high (>0.1 Å−1) spatial frequencies. Contrast transfer function correction was then performed by inverting the phases between the first and second zero as implemented in IMAGIC 5. In case of single crystalline layers, correlation averaging was started with, for instance, a 128 × 128 pixel image excised from the large patch that served as a first reference image. In case of two layers, Fourier filtering (within Electron Micrograph, Gatan, Inc.) was performed first to separate the two layers, and references were excised from the filtered images (28Kessel M. Radermacher M. Frank J. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 139: 63-75Google Scholar). In both cases, correlation averaging was iterated until no further improvement was obtained. At this point, the motif was centered and the image size was reduced to a total area of about 16 and later 9 unit cells (smaller references down to 6 unit cells lead to similar results). To estimate the signal content in the data sets of extracted unit cells, the S- (28Kessel M. Radermacher M. Frank J. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 139: 63-75Google Scholar) and I-image (29Sherman M.B. Toshinori S. Chiu W. van Heel M. Ultramicroscopy. 1998; 74: 179-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) method was used as implemented in IMAGIC 5. Prior to performing these procedures, the extracted images were treated with a circular mask (radius 0.7) with a soft Gaussian fall-off of 5 pixels to avoid high frequency correlation from the edges of the images. For our crystallization studies, we used mouse MDR3 Pgp expressed in the yeastP. pastoris as described earlier (21Lerner-Marmarosh N. Gimi K. Urbatsch I.L Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34711-34718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 22Urbatsch I.L. Wilke-Mounts S. Gimi K. Senior A.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 388: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The protein contained mutations Asn to Gln introduced at potential glycosylation positions 83, 87, and 90 and a C-terminal His6 tag. Briefly, Pgp was solubilized from microsomes in the presence of dodecyl maltoside (0.6% w/v) and purified to homogeneity by Ni-chelating gel chromatography and subsequent ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose in the presence of 0.1% (w/v) dodecyl maltoside. Previous SDS-gel electrophoresis has shown that the resultant preparation is highly purified (22Urbatsch I.L. Wilke-Mounts S. Gimi K. Senior A.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 388: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Pgp prepared in this way is soluble in aqueous buffer and highly monodisperse. Fig.1 shows native gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy of Pgp. As can be seen from Fig. 1 A, Pgp migrates as a single sharp band in the gel, indicating the homogeneous nature of the preparation with respect to its oligomeric state. Fig.1 B shows a sample of Pgp negatively stained with uranyl acetate. Again, the preparation appears highly homogenous with an average size of the particles of about 80–100 Å, consistent with a monomeric form of Pgp. For two-dimensional crystallization of Pgp, we used the lipid monolayer technique modified for the crystallization of membrane proteins (25Levy D. Mosser G. Lambert O. Moeck G.S. Bald D. Rigaud J.-L. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 127: 44-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 30Lebeau L. Lach F. Venien-Bryan C. Renault A. Dietrich J. Jahn T. Palmgren M.G. Kühlbrandt W. Mioskowski C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, detergent-solubilized Pgp containing a His6 tag at the C terminus is covered with a monolayer consisting of a mix of Egg-PC and NiNTA- derivatized lipid (DOGS-NiNTA). After sufficient time to allow the protein to bind to the monolayer (1 h at room temperature), the Teflon block was transferred to 37 °C, and detergent was removed by polystyrene beads over a time period of 24 h. During the detergent removal, Pgp was reconstituted into a lipid bilayer, which formed underneath the lipid monolayer. The advantage of this methodversus the conventional reconstitution method is that the protein exhibits a uniform orientation in the lipid bilayer, thus facilitating the subsequent structure analysis. Two-dimensional crystals of Pgp were observed under a variety of conditions; the condition giving the most reproducible results is described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 2shows a collection of images of two-dimensional crystals of Pgp generated this way. Crystals that formed directly on the solvent-exposed side of the lipid monolayer as a single layer (these were more often observed at lower temperatures) were generally limited in size and often distorted due to breakage of the monolayer during the transfer to the EM grid. Fig. 2, A and B shows two examples of crystalline arrays formed this way. Panel Ashows a small area of lipid monolayer covered by an array of Pgp molecules. The crystalline area is overlapping a hole in the “holey” carbon film used to pick up the monolayer. Panel B shows a slightly larger patch supported by continuous carbon film. Better quality crystals were observed in vesicles or tubes formed from the lipids contained in the monolayer and/or the lipids added together with the protein after incubation at 37 °C. Fig. 2 C shows a small vesicle containing densely packed Pgp molecules. At the edge of the vesicle, little globular protrusions, ∼50 Å wide and 50 Å high, can be seen (see inset, Fig. 2 C). The size of these protrusions is consistent with the expected size of the two cytoplasmic nucleotide binding domains of Pgp, which would suggest an inside out orientation of the protein. More commonly, two-dimensional crystals were observed in tubular vesicles 1–2 μm in diameter and up to 20 μm in length. Both single- and double-layered two-dimensional crystals were observed. Fig. 2 D shows a crystalline patch from a larger vesicle (see inset) with its computed power spectrum shown in Fig. 2 F. The power spectrum indicates that this area of the vesicle contains a single crystalline layer. Fig.2 E shows the power spectrum of the lower box in the inset in Fig. 2 D. The power spectrum shows two overlapping patterns that are rotated by ∼45° with respect to each other, indicating the presence of two crystalline layers. The weak 3,3 reflection close to the first zero of the contrast transfer function in the power spectrum calculated from the image shown in Fig. 2 D (Fig.2 F, circle) occurs at a spatial frequency of 1/24 Å−1, indicating that the crystals contain information to a resolution of at least 24 Å. The clearly visible 3,2 reflection occurs at 1/27 Å−1. The exact mechanism by which the vesicular two-dimensional crystals of Pgp are formed is not fully understood. Lipid tubes and vesicles shaped similar to the ones containing the Pgp two-dimensional crystals were also observed in the absence of added Pgp, detergent and/or lipid, indicating that they are formed from the lipids contained in the monolayer. However, such lipid structures formed in the absence of protein did not show any crystalline arrays. Formation of two-dimensional crystals was observed with or without addition of extra lipid (EggPC) to the crystallization drop. With no extra lipid added, the lipid required to reconstitute the monolayer-bound Pgp upon detergent removal probably comes from some lipid solubilized from the monolayer by the detergent (the amount of lipid added to cover the crystallization drop is about 1.5 times the amount needed to cover the surface of the drop with a single layer) and from residual lipid contained in the Pgp preparations. What seems crucial in the formation of the Pgp two-dimensional crystals is the initial oriented binding of the protein to the lipid head groups of the intact monolayer. No crystals could be obtained when spreading the monolayer lipids on the drop, which already contained Pgp and detergent, in agreement with the original report (25Levy D. Mosser G. Lambert O. Moeck G.S. Bald D. Rigaud J.-L. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 127: 44-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) describing the lipid monolayer technique for membrane proteins. Especially for 37 °C incubations, we always observed some evaporation of the buffer during crystallization, resulting in a slight decrease of the surface area of the crystallization drop. This reduction in surface area might then lead to some folding of the monolayer, with or without Pgp bound, which in turn might lead to the formation of the observed bilayer structures. Consistent with this idea is that the observed tubes and vesicles seem always attached to the residual monolayer on the surface of the drops and that we have not observed any vesicular structures by electron microscopy of the remaining crystallization solution after transfer of the monolayer to the EM grid. Another possibility is that the vesicular structures are formed during transfer of the monolayer to the EM grid. However, formation of closed lipid structures such as shown in Fig. 2,C and D is a slow process, which would suggest that this is a less likely explanation. To further analyze the two-dimensional crystals, we used correlation averaging as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Correlation averaging is the method of choice for small to medium-sized two-dimensional crystals with limited long range order. Fig3 A shows the result of correlation averaging with a 256 × 256 pixel image excised from a 1024 × 1024 crystalline patch as a starting reference. In the first round, the 64 highest peaks in the cross-correlation function were used to extract 64 images from the crystalline patch that were averaged and used as new reference image for the next round. No further improvement was observed after four iterations of the procedure, at which time the 256 highest peaks were used to extract the images. In the final average, the arrangement of the Pgp molecules was clearly visible and can be described by two interdigitated primitive square lattices formed by Pgp molecules rotated by 90° from one to the other lattice (consequently the “missing” 0,k and h,0 reflections, see Fig. 2 F). The computed power spectrum of the average is shown in Fig. 3 B. Weak reflections with 0,k and h,0 are now visible with the 4,0 reflection, indicating a resolution of ∼26 Å. The low intensity higher order reflections visible in the power spectrum (up to the sixth order) probably do not contribute much to the signal content in the average, but they indicate the high degree of order in the crystalline lattice of Pgp. To get a statistically more significant picture of the unit cell, correlation averaging was performed starting with a 128 × 128 pixel image that was later reduced to 60 × 60 pixels, corresponding to an area of 9 unit cells. Smaller areas (down to 6 unit cells) were tried but did not result in better averages (data not shown). Fig. 3 C shows the final average, which was calculated from 1000 images excised from a 1024 × 1024-μm crystalline patch (0.53 × 0.53 μm2). All crystalline patches analyzed that showed diffraction to the second order lead to very similar images with minor variances in the projection caused by differential stain distribution and/or small tilts (not shown). The unit cell contains two Pgp monomers and has dimensions a = b = 104 ± 2 Å and γ = 90 ± 4°. The size of the projection of the individual Pgp molecules is ∼68 × 45 Å when using positive contours to define the boundary of the molecule (one molecule is surrounded by the dashed line in Fig. 3 C). The two-domain structure of Pgp is now clearly visible, with both domains related by a pseudo 2-fold symmetry axis through the middle of the molecule where there is less density. The two domains visible in the projection can be readily interpreted as the N- and C-terminal halves of the Pgp molecule, which display 38% sequence identity (31Gros P. Buschman E. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 137C: 169-197PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that they posses a very similar tertiary fold. Both orientations of the molecules show the same weak handedness, again indicating the uniform inside out orientation of the protein induced by the initial binding to the lipid monolayer. The resolution in the final average was estimated by calculating the S- and I-images as implemented in IMAGIC 5 (Fig. 3 D). Both algorithms indicate that the final average contains information to a resolution of 22 Å. Structural features of Chinese hamster Pgp from electron microscopy of single molecules and two-dimensional crystals of delipidated protein grown at the air-liquid interface were previously reported (16Rosenberg M.F. Callaghan R. Ford R.C. Higgins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10685-10694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 17Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Martin C.

Although the top view projection obtained from stained detergent-solubilized single Pgp molecules is similar in overall shape (with a longer and shorter dimension), its size is somewhat larger (100 Å in the long dimension; Ref. 16Rosenberg M.F. Callaghan R. Ford R.C. Higgins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10685-10694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) than the mouse Pgp projection reported here. The size of the monomers in the two-dimensional crystals of hamster Pgp (60–70 Å; Ref. 17Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. Schmidlin A. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5615-5625Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) is more consistent with the long dimension of lipid-bound mouse Pgp reported in this study. However, the shape of the hamster protein in the two-dimensional crystals is more ring-like with a central pore (17Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. Schmidlin A. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5615-5625Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The larger size of the hamster Pgp single molecule projection is probably caused by a layer of stain-excluding detergent and/or a more open conformation of the NBDs (see below). The different appearance of the projections of hamster Pgp in the two-dimensional crystals could be due to the fact that these crystals were grown in the absence of lipid, which might result in different staining compared with lipid-bound Pgp. The influence of the method of specimen embedding on the appearance of the projection maps is also evident from the images obtained from unstained two-dimensional crystals of hamster Pgp, which look somewhat different compared with the images of the same crystals in negative stain (17Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. Schmidlin A. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5615-5625Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The differences in the projections of nucleotide-free hamster (17Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. Schmidlin A. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5615-5625Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and mouse Pgp (this study) might also be caused by a slightly different orientation of the protein molecules in the two-dimensional crystals. For elongated molecules such as Pgp, even slight variations in the viewing direction can lead to significant differences in the appearance of the projections. Recently, the first detailed structures of intact ABC transporters, the E. coli lipid A flippase, MsbA, and the vitamin B12 importer, BtuCD, were reported from x-ray crystallographic data at 4.5 and 3.2 Å resolution, respectively (19Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 20Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Both proteins show some sequence homology to Pgp within the nucleotide binding domains, but in the case of the transmembrane domains, only MsbA is similar. It is therefore likely that the structure of Pgp will be more similar to the structure of MsbA. The functional MsbA molecule consists of two identical subunits, each containing a transmembrane and a nucleotide binding domain, whereas BtuCD contains four subunits, comprising two identical NBDs (BtuD) and TMDs (BtuC). The backbone representations of the two x-ray structures is shown in Fig. 4, A andG (side view) and B and H (top view). It is salient that the two nucleotide domains are well separated in the MsbA structure (left panel), whereas they are in close contact in BtuCD (right panel). To be able to compare the x-ray models with our projection structure of Pgp, the Protein Data Bank coordinate files for MsbA (1JSQ) and BtuCD (1L7V) were imported into IMAGIC 5, low pass filtered to a resolution of 16 Å, and projected along a direction perpendicular to the lipid bilayer. The resulting projections are shown in Fig. 4, C andI. Fig. 4 J shows the projection of Pgp outlined by the dashed oval in Fig. 3 C, displayed at the same scale as the x-ray structure projections. As can be seen, the dimensions of the projection of MsbA are roughly 115 × 45 Å. The dimensions of the Pgp projection (Fig. 4 J) are ∼68 × 45Å (see above) and therefore not compatible with the dimensions of the MsbA projection (Fig. 4 C). There is strong evidence from Pgp mechanism studies that the nucleotide binding domains interact cooperatively in at least one step in the catalytic cycle (see references in the Introduction). There is also structural evidence for potential close proximity of the nucleotide binding domains. For example, conserved cysteine residues in the Walker A sequence of human Pgp are able to form a disulfide bond connecting both NBDs (32Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19435-19438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 33Urbatsch I.L. Gimi K. Wilke-Mounts S. Lerner-Marmarosh N. Rousseau M-E. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26980-26987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the ABC transporter analog, Rad50, shows clear evidence of contact of the NBDs (12Hopfner K-P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 789-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar), and the ArsA ATP-driven arsenic exporter from E. coli evinces both functional and structural interaction of its two NBDs (34Zhou T. Radaev S. Rosen B.P. Gatti D.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4838-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We therefore modified the MsbA coordinate file to bring the nucleotide binding domains into contact (Fig. 4, D and E). This involved a 30o rotation of the MsbA subunits around an axis parallel to the lipid bilayer leaving enough space for residues 344–418, which were not resolved in the MsbA structure (19Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Residues 344–418 occur within the MsbA NBDs and include the Walker A consensus sequence. Thus the projected structures in Fig. 4, C andF are also missing densities corresponding to these regions. As can be seen from Fig. 4 F, the resulting projection structure is now much more similar to the projection structure of Pgp shown in Fig. 4J, including the weak handedness. The similarity in the dimensions of the projections of Pgp and the manually closed MsbA suggests that Pgp crystallized in the lipid bilayer in a “closed” conformation (as compared with the open MsbA structure) even in the absence of nucleotides. This is not unreasonable, because the intra-NBD disulfide cross-link in the human Pgp can occur in the absence of added nucleotides (33Urbatsch I.L. Gimi K. Wilke-Mounts S. Lerner-Marmarosh N. Rousseau M-E. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26980-26987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). At this level of resolution, the projection structure of Pgp is also very similar to the projection of the BtuCD transporter (Fig. 4, G–I) despite the lack of sequence similarity between the two proteins in the membrane domain (which, of course, does not exclude the possibility that they posses a similar transmembrane architecture). As mentioned above, naturally occurring cysteines in the P-loops of the human Pgp have been shown to cross-link via a disulfide bond. It is possible that the closed conformation seen here in mouse Pgp is stabilized by a similar disulfide bond because the cysteines responsible for the cross-link in human Pgp are conserved in the mouse protein. In BtuCD, the equivalent positions in the P-loops are alanines, and in the x-ray model, these alanines are more than 30 Å apart. The relatively small area of buried surface between the two NBDs as seen in the BtuCD structure (20Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar) also suggests that the NBDs did not form a very tight interface. However, it can be anticipated that during the catalytic cycle large conformational changes are taking place that might transform Pgp from the open conformation as seen in the MsbA structure via a closed conformation as seen in BtuCD to a closed conformation in which the P-loops come as close as 4–6 Å to enable the disulfide cross-link observed in the mammalian Pgp. Major substrate-dependent structural changes have been seen in delipidated hamster Pgp crystallized at the air/liquid interface (17Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. Schmidlin A. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5615-5625Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), but the projections obtained in that study were hard to interpret in terms of the two-domain structure of Pgp, possibly because of a different viewing angle (see above). In summary, we present a projection structure of Pgp, which although at a modest 22-Å resolution, is the first detailed structural information for Pgp obtained with the protein embedded in its native environment, the lipid bilayer. The molecule appears in a closed conformation with the nucleotide binding domains in contact in contrast to the open conformation of the protein as seen in the x-ray structure of MsbA. Previous mutagenesis studies have indicated the occurrence of both open and closed conformations of Pgp in the catalytic cycle (35Urbatsch I.L. Gimi K. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25031-25038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Speculatively, these may correlate with the conformations of MsbA and Pgp discussed here. We thank Alfred Ahrin for excellent technical assistance."

They consist of the GAGs and their core proteins, to which CS is bound covalently. The CS proteoglycans distribute in various tissues, especially brain, tendon, skin, muscle, endothelial and epithelial cells, and contribute to the physical strength of tissues, cell adhesion, signal transduction, and so on (11Iozzo R.V.

The glycosyltransferases, such as glucuronyltransferase-I (GlcAT-I), β1,3-galactosyltransferase-VI (β3Gal-T6), β4Gal-T7, and xylosyltransferase, for the linkage have been identified (5Okajima T.

Chem. 2001; 276: 38721-38726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This enzyme shows activities of β1,3-glucuronyltransferase (β3GlcA-T) and β1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (β4GalNAc-T), although its chondroitin polymerization activity has not been detectedin vitro. We recently cloned and identified CSGlcA-T, which acts as β3GlcA-T in the elongation of CS (19Gotoh M. Yada T. Sato T. Akashima T. Iwasaki H. Mochizuki H. Inaba N. Togayachi A. Kudo T. Watanabe H. Kimata K. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38179-38188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Both CSS and CSGlcA-T have β3GlcA-T activities, however, their acceptor specificities differ. CSGlcA-T prefers shorter acceptors than CSS; therefore, we propose that CSGlcA-T and CSS function at different stage in the synthesis of CS, i.e. the former at an early stage and the latter at a late stage. CS consists of many kinds of sulfated glucuronic acid (GlcA) andN-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) (20Sugahara K. Yamada S. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 2000; 12: 321-349Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The C2 and C3 positions of GlcA and the C4 and C6 positions of GalNAc are the sites possibly sulfated by the respective sulfotransferases. There are reports that the sulfation is related to the elongation and termination of the CS chain. Using bovine serum, UDP-GalNAc and various kinds of sulfated (GlcAβ1–3GalNAcβ1–4)n, 6-O- or 4-O-sulfated GalNAc in the acceptor stimulates the GalNAc-T activity, whereas terminal 3-O-sulfated GlcA or penultimate 4,6-O-disulfated GalNAc inhibits the activity (21Kitagawa H.

Biochem. J. 1985; 226: 705-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) demonstrated acceptor substrate specificity to GlcA-T and GalNAc-T in a microsomal preparation from chick embryo chondrocytes using even- and odd-numbered oligosaccharides prepared from chondroitin, CS-A, CS-C, and hyaluronan. They showed that oligosaccharides prepared from CS-C and chondroitin were active as acceptors for both enzymes, whereas oligosaccharides from CS-A and hyaluronan were mostly inactive. In the case of CSGlcA-T, the sulfated oligosaccharides prepared from CS-C made better substrates than non-sulfated oligosaccharides (19Gotoh M. Yada T. Sato T. Akashima T. Iwasaki H. Mochizuki H.

The progress made with the human genome project and other databases, such as expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and full-length complementary DNAs (cDNAs), has enabled us to search for novel genes that are homologous to known genes. We searched these databases utilizing the amino acid sequences of the β4Gal-T family while paying particular attention to the existence of a trans-membrane domain and conserved motif regions, DXD and GWGGED, as query sequences. In this study, we focused on a novel gene, which possesses the GWGGED motif and has elongation and initiation activities in the synthesis of CS, although its cloning and a brief characterization were reported while we were preparing this report (23Uyama T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8841-8846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Finally, we show that the synthesis of chondroitin pentasaccharide is possible using the three reported enzymes and this novel enzyme in vitro. We performed a BLAST search of the EST databases using amino acid sequences of the cloned human β1,4-galactosyltransferases (β4Gal-T) as queries and found a novel EST (GenBankTM accession number AK055154) that possesses the GWGGED motif for β4Gal-T. To obtain the open reading frame sequence, we performed the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE) technique with a Marathon-Ready cDNA amplification kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The 5′ sequence was extended by two-step 5′-RACE. Two reverse primers, 5′-ACCTATATTGATGAAGTCTGACCGA-3′ for the first PCR and 5′-GTCTGACCGATACTGACACGTCAT-3′ for the nested PCR, were employed for the first-step extension. The second-step 5′-RACE was carried out with the reverse primers 5′-TCCTGCAGCTCCTCCTTGAGCT-3′ and 5′-ATCTGCCGCTTCAGGCTGCTCA-3′. The putative catalytic domain of the enzyme (amino acids 37–532) was expressed as a secreted protein fused with a FLAG peptide in insect cells according to the instruction manual of GATEWAY Cloning Technology (Invitrogen, Groningen, Netherlands). A DNA fragment of ∼1.6 kb was amplified by PCR using the Marathon-Ready cDNA derived from human bone marrow (Clontech), as a template, and two primers, 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCAAAGGTGACGAGGAGCAGCTGGCAC-3′ and 5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCTCATGTTTTTTTGCTACTTGTCTTCTGT-3′. The amplified fragment was inserted into pFBIF to construct pFBIF-CSGalNAc-T as described previously (24Iwai T. Inaba N. Naundorf A. Zhang Y. Gotoh M. Iwasaki H. Kudo T. Togayachi A. Ishizuka Y. Nakanishi H. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12802-12809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The CSGalNAc-T catalytic domain was expressed in Sf21 insect cells. A 50-ml volume of culture medium was mixed with anti-FLAG M1 antibody resin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The protein-resin mixture was washed twice with 50 mm TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl) containing 1 mm CaCl2 and suspended in 100 μl of each of the assay buffers described below. The putative catalytic domain of β4Gal-T7, β3Gal-T6, or GlcAT-I was expressed as secreted protein fused with FLAG peptide in insect cells or COS-1 cells. For β4Gal-T7, 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTGGGCAGTCAGGGGACAAG-3′ and 5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCACTGTCCATCCAGCTCA-3′ were used as PCR primers. To amplify the GlcAT-I gene, two primers, 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCCTACGGCAGAAGGATCTGAGGATT-3′ and 5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCTCACACCTCAATTGCTGGGTCTGA-3′ were utilized. These glycosyltransferases were expressed using the GATEWAY system as described above. For β3Gal-T6, a PCR fragment with 5′-CGGGATCCGAGCCCGGGGACCCCAGGGCGATG-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGAGCGCCGCCGGGTGAAGCAGGTGTC-3′ was introduced into theBamHI and XbaI sites of pFLAG-CMV-1 (Sigma) and expressed in COS-1 cells. To determine the enzymic activity, UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal) and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine (UDP-GalNAc) (Sigma) were utilized as donor substrates. UDP-[3H]GalNAc (7.0 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Science (Boston, MA). For acceptor substrates, Gal-α-para-nitrophenyl (pNp), Gal-β-pNp, GalNAc-α-benzyl, GlcNAc-α-pNp, GlcNAc-β-pNp, glucose-α-pNp, glucose-β-pNp, GlcA-β-pNp, fucose-α-pNp, mannose-α-pNp, xylose (Xyl)-α-pNp, and Xyl-β-pNp were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA) and Sigma. Chondroitin and chondroitin sulfate (CS)-A, -B, -C, and -D were purchased from Seikagaku Corporation (Tokyo, Japan). Chondroitin hexasaccharide and linkage tetrasaccharide-methoxyphenyl were kindly provided by Seikagaku Corporation. Oligosaccharides of CS and chondroitin were prepared as previously described (22Gundlach M.W. Conrad H.E. Biochem. J. 1985; 226: 705-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A Xyl-peptide (VLPQEEEGS(-Xyl)GGGQLVT) was obtained from the Peptide Institute Inc. (Osaka, Japan). For the reaction of Gal-T assay, a 14 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) containing 250 μm UDP-Gal, 12.5 mmMnCl2, and 500 μm of each acceptor substrate was used. For the GalNAc-T assay, a 50 mm MES buffer (pH 6.5) containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm UDP-GalNAc, 10 mm MnCl2, and 500 μm of each acceptor substrate was used. A 10-μl volume of enzyme solution for 20 μl of each reaction mixture was added, and the solution was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h for Gal-T and 16 h for GalNAc-T. After the incubation, the mixture was filtrated with an Ultrafree-MC column (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and a 10-μl aliquot was subjected to reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on an ODS-80Ts QA column (4.6 × 250 mm, Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan). 0.1% TFA/H2O was used as a running solution, and the products were eluted with a 0–15% (for GlcA-β-pNp) or 7–10% (for linkage tetrasaccharide-methoxyphenyl) acetonitrile gradient at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at 50 °C. For glycosylated peptides, H2O containing 0.1% TFA and 21% acetonitrile was utilized as the running solution. An ultraviolet spectrophotometer (absorbance at 210 nm), SPD-10AVP (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) was used for detection of the peaks. For the analysis of glycosylated peptide, labeling was carried out with Cy5 (Amersham Biosciences), and fluorescence was detected with a fluorescence detector, RF-10AXL (Shimadzu). For the analysis of elongation activity, a CSGalNAc-T reaction mixture containing 100 μg of chondroitin or CS and 40,000–55,500 dpm of UDP-[14C]GalNAc was used. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the reaction mixture was filtrated and fractionated with a G2500PW column (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) or a Superdex 30-pg column (Amersham Biosciences). The radioactivity of each fraction was monitored by liquid scintillation spectrophotometry. An additional peak obtained by reversed-phase chromatography was isolated and analyzed by electrospray ionization (ESI) or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS (ESI-MS, esquire3000plus, and MALDI-TOF-MS, Reflex IV, Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA). The product (25 pmol) was dissolved in 5 μl of H2O, and 45 μl of 0.1% formic acid and 50 μl of methanol were added. The product solution was infused at a rate of 3 μl/min with a capillary voltage of 3 kV. The hypothetical product peaks obtained by ESI-MS were analyzed by ESI tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). These analyses were done in both positive-ion and negative-ion modes. For MALDI-TOF MS, 10 pmol of product was dried, dissolved in 1 μl of H2O, and applied. The 3′-untranslated region (695 bp) was used as a probe for Northern blot analysis. The probe was amplified by PCR with 5′-ATGCCATATCCAAGGACATGCCAA-3′ and 5′-AACAATGAGCTTACTGTGAGCAAAC-3′ as primers. Human Multiple Tissue Northern Blot III was purchased from Clontech. For the labeling and detection of probe, an AlkPhos Direct Labeling and Detection System with CDP-Star and Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences) were utilized. For quantification ofCSGalNAc-T transcripts, we employed the real-time PCR method, as described in detail previously (24Iwai T. Inaba N. Naundorf A. Zhang Y. Gotoh M. Iwasaki H. Kudo T. Togayachi A.

Marathon Ready cDNAs derived from various human tissues and cell lines (HL-60 and G361) were purchased from Clontech. cDNAs derived from other cell lines were prepared with the SuperScript First-strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) as described in our previous study (27Togayachi A. Akashima T. Ookubo R. Kudo T. Nishihara S. Iwasaki H. Natsume A. Mio H. Inokuchi J. Irimura T. Sasaki K. Narimatsu H. J. Biol.

Standard curves for the endogenous control, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNAs, were generated by serial dilution of a pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) DNA containing the GAPDH gene. The primer set and the probe for CSGalNAc-T were as follows: forward primer, 5′-GACTTCATCAATATAGGTGGGTTTGAT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GTCCGTACCACTATGAGGTTGCT-3′; and probe, 5′-ACCTTTATCGCAAGTATCT-3′ with the minor groove binder (28Kutyavin I.V.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). PCR products were continuously measured with an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The relative amount of CSGalNAc-T transcript was normalized to the amount of GAPDH transcript in the same cDNA. While we were preparing this report, a paper on the cloning and characterization of CSGalNAc-T was published (23Uyama T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8841-8846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The nucleotide and putative amino acid sequences of the clone we obtained were the same as those of Uyama et al.'s cDNA clone (GenBankTM accession numbers AB081516 andAB071403). This enzyme maintained local homology with β4Gal-T1 in the putative catalytic domain as shown in Fig.1, however, no remarkable homology with β4GalNAc-T was found (data not shown) (29Nagata Y. Yamashiro S. Yodoi J. Lloyd K.O. Shiku H. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12082-12089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A DXD motif, which is conserved in many glycosyltransferases and functions as a key sequence for divalent cation binding, existed in the putative catalytic domain. Another motif, GWGGED, which is highly conserved among the β4Gal-T family except β4Gal-T7 (GWGRED), was also found. We determined the substrate specificity of the soluble enzyme expressed in insect cells. Contrary to expectations, it did not exhibit any galactosyltransferase activity (data not shown). As shown in Fig.2, we observed an additional positive peak, at 55.4 min, of the reaction product when UDP-GalNAc and GlcA-pNp were used as a donor substrate and an acceptor substrate, respectively (Fig. 2 B). To confirm that the peak is the real reaction product, ESI-MS was employed. In the positive-ion mode, a peak of 519.05 m/z was the same molecular weight as GalNAc-GlcA-pNp (Fig. 2 C). When this peak was subjected to further analysis by ESI-MS/MS, new peaks appeared at 203.91 and 298.97 m/z (Fig. 2 D). The former peak had exactly the same molecular weight as GalNAc, and the latter fitted that of GlcA-pNp missing a water molecule. ESI-MS in the negative-ion mode revealed that the product could be GalNAc-GlcA-pNp (517.19 m/z), and it produced GlcA-pNp without a water molecule (296.00m/z) (data not shown). These results demonstrated that the enzyme has GalNAc-T activity and transfers GalNAc to GlcA. To date, the linkage combining GalNAc and GlcA has been identified only in CS. At this point, we considered the enzyme to be involved in the synthesis of CS and named it chondroitin sulfateN-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, CSGalNAc-T. Two kinds of GalNAc-GlcA linkages are known in CS, one in its polymer structure (3GalNAcβ1–4GlcAβ1-)n and the other between the polymer CS and a linkage tetrasaccharide (GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl). To identify whether it has elongation activity, chondroitin and CS were utilized as acceptor substrates. When chondroitin was used for the acceptor, an additional peak was detected by reversed-phase chromatography, although an extremely low peak appeared using CS-C as the acceptor (indicated by an arrow in Fig.3). The fractions of this peak were collected and identified by treatment with chondroitinase ACII (data not shown). The initiation activity of CSGalNAc-T was determined with a linkage tetrasaccharide (GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-methoxyphenyl) that was chemically synthesized. As shown in Fig.4, a peak (P) appeared at 28.9 min (Fig. 4 B) in addition to the acceptor substrate peak (S) at 29.7 min (Fig. 4, A and B). The peaks S and P were isolated by reversed-phase chromatography and identified with MALDI-TOF MS. The peak Sgave a molecular mass of 779.20 m/z, the same as that of the linkage tetrasaccharide (Fig. 4 C). The peakP gave two peaks of 982.23 and 1004.21m/z as shown in Fig. 4 D. The peaks of 982.23 and 1004.21 m/z were the same molecular weight as GalNAc-linkage tetrasaccharide-O-methoxyphenyl and GalNAc-linkage tetrasaccharide-O-methoxyphenyl with Na+, respectively. Moreover, the peak P was identified to have GalNAc on its non-reducing terminus with chondroitinase ACII treatment (data not shown). These results demonstrated that CSGalNAc-T acts to initiate chondroitin sulfate synthesis by transferring GalNAc to GlcA at the non-reducing terminus of the linkage tetrasaccharide. The CSGalNAc-T activity toward various kinds of acceptors is summarized in Table I. CSGalNAc-T preferred the best linkage tetrasaccharide of all substrates examined. Regarding elongation activity, chondroitin was the preferred acceptor substrate, whereas the sulfated CS polysaccharides were an unsuitable substrate for CSGalNAc-T. The activity levels for the longer oligosaccharide prepared from chondroitin and CS were higher than those for the shorter ones, although they were rather low.Table ICSGlcA-T activity toward various acceptor substratesAcceptor substrateActivitypmol/ml medium/hChondroitinPolysaccharide15.9OligosaccharideCH140.6CH120.5CH100.3CH80.2CH60.1Chondroitin sulfatePolysaccharideCS-A0.5CS-B0.8CS-C1.3CS-D0.8OligosaccharideCS141.8CS121.5CS101.9CS81.6CS61.1Linkage tetrasaccharide22.5 Open table in a new tab To determine the size of the CSGalNAc-T transcripts, Northern blot analysis was performed. As shown in Fig.5 A, the transcript was ∼4 kb in length. We did not observe any other bands except the 4-kb band. Its expression was found in all tissues examined, however, the levels differed among tissues. The expression levels of CSGalNAc-T in various tissues and cell lines, as determined by quantitative real-time PCR, were shown as the relative amount versusglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) transcripts (Fig. 5,B and C). The transcripts were highly expressed in thyroid and placenta, although they were ubiquitously expressed in other tissues. However, their expression levels were extremely low in almost all cell lines examined. We performed an in vitro enzymatic synthesis of a chondroitin pentasaccharide, a foundation structure of CS, by employing four glycosyltransferases and synthetic Xyl-peptide (VLPQEEEGS(Xyl)GGGQLVT; N-terminal sequence of bikunin) (Fig. 6). As shown in Fig. 6 B, when three known glycosyltransferases, β4Gal-T7, β3Gal-T6, and GlcAT-I, the specificities of which for the GAG synthesis were already reported, were utilized in the enzyme reaction, three additional peaks were detected by reversed-phase chromatography. Before this experiment, we had confirmed that each peak, P1, P2, and P3, is a sequential product of β4Gal-T7, β3Gal-T6, and GlcAT-I, respectively (data not shown). Each peak was identified to be Gal-Xyl-peptide (P1), Gal-Gal-Xyl-peptide (P2), or GlcA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-peptide (P3) by the position of control oligosaccharide-peptides, which were prepared by a sequential enzyme reaction using each of the three enzymes as illustrated in Fig. 6 D. When CSGalNAc-T was added to the reaction mixture in addition to the three enzymes, a novel peak (P4) appeared (Fig. 6 C) at 35.0 min. Chondroitinase ACII treatment of P4 resulted in the apparent digestion of P4, indicating that it has a GalNAcβ1–4GlcA linkage in its structure (data not shown). These results demonstrated that the chondroitin pentasaccharide with the peptide can be synthesized in vitro, using three known specific enzymes and one novel glycosyltransferase, CSGalNAc-T. We found that a novel enzyme, CSGalNAc-T, exhibited GalNAc-T activity toward GlcA. From its acceptor specificity, it was suggested that CSGalNAc-T is involved in both the elongation and initiation of CS synthesis. While we were preparing this report, a paper describing the cloning and characterization of the same enzyme, CSGalNAc-T, was published (23Uyama T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8841-8846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, the activity toward the linkage tetrasaccharide was not described by these authors. Here, we demonstrate an apparent initiation and elongation activity, in addition, we examined in greater detail the substrate specificity toward various acceptors. We also demonstrate the following points, which Uyama et al. did not detect or examine: 1) CSGalNAc-T showed apparent initiation activity toward the linkage tetrasaccharide. 2) Regarding the elongation activity, CSGalNAc-T preferred chondroitin to CS. No species of CS, CS-A, -B, -C, or -D, was a suitable acceptor for CSGalNAc-T. 3) The activity was dependent on the length of oligosaccharide chain as an acceptor. 4) Finally, we could construct a chondroitin pentasaccharide on the peptide using the four enzymes, including CSGalNAc-T, by synthesis in vitro. Because CSGalNAc-T contained the β4Gal-T motif (GWGGED) in its putative catalytic domain, we considered at first that it would exert β4Gal-T activity. Unexpectedly, it transferred GalNAc, not Gal, to GlcA-pNp. This enzyme is the first example demonstrating that the GWGGED motif is shared not only by β4Gal-T but also by β4GalNAc-T. Based on the crystallized structure of bovine β4Gal-T1, it is proposed that the Trp residue at position 314 is necessary to lock with a donor substrate, UDP-Gal, with its strict specificity. The Gly-313 residue is proposed to be also important for the rotation of Trp314 to maintain Gal-T activity (9Ramakrishnan B. Qasba P.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, many members of the UDP-GalNAc:polypeptideN-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (pp-GalNAc-T) family, for which a donor substrate is UDP-GalNAc, possess the WGGE sequence in their catalytic domains, but not the GWGGED sequence (30Bennett E.P.

Thus, we speculate that the first Gly and Trp residues in the GWGGED motif do not determine the specificity for a donor substrate. The product of CSGalNAc-T was GalNAc-GlcA, which has been identified only in CS. It was predicted that CSGalNAc-T is the enzyme involved in the synthesis of CS. Chondroitin has the structure of disaccharide units in the polymerized chain, (3GalNAc β1–4GlcAβ1-)n, and the linkage tetrasaccharide (GlcAβ1–3GalNAc β1–4GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser). In the present study, we defined the ability of CSGalNAc-T to make both linkages as elongation and initiation activity. CSS was reported to have elongation activity but did not exhibit initiation activity (18Kitagawa H. Uyama T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38721-38726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Regarding the elongation activity of CSS, it could efficiently transfer GalNAc to chondroitin polysaccharide but not to CS polysaccharide. This is similar to the CSGalNAc-T activity. Sulfation affects enzyme activity for chondroitin chain elongation and termination. CSGalNAc-T partially purified from bovine serum was examined for its activity toward various sulfated chondroitins (21Kitagawa H. Tsutsumi K. Ujikawa M. Goto F. Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Ogawa T. Sugahara K. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It showed higher levels of activity when 6-O- or 4-O-sulfated GalNAc in the acceptor was utilized, whereas terminal 3-O-sulfated GlcA or penultimate 4,6-O-disulfated GalNAc inhibits the activity. The CS-A or -C polysaccharide used in this study contains a large amount of 4-O- or 6-O-sulfated GalNAc, respectively, and CS-D mainly contains 2-O-sulfated GlcA and 6-O-sulfated GalNAc residues. CS-B contains a large amount of dermatan sulfate with 4-O-sulfated GalNAc. However, these acceptors obtained from natural materials are mixtures of sulfated GalNAc and GlcA residues and may contain unexpected sulfated sugars that inhibit the elongation activity of CSGalNAc-T. Another possibility is that a different CSGalNAc-T functions in sulfated chondroitin elongation. In fact, we have found another candidate in a data base, temporarily named CSGalNAc-T2, which has a highly homologous sequence to CSGalNAc-T. CSGalNAc-T preferred longer chondroitins than shorter ones (Table I). However, there is a possibility that polymer chondroitin without any sulfation is not abundant in natural substances. If this is true, the physiological function of CSGalNAc-T may be the initiation of CS synthesis. In such a case, some other CSGalNAc-Ts, such as CSS and an unknown CSGalNAc-T, may function in the elongation of CS. Another glycosaminoglycan, heparan sulfate (HS)/heparin has a similar structure, GlcAβ1–4GlcNAcα1–4 disaccharide units on the same linkage tetrasaccharide. Five glycosyltransferases, i.e.EXT1, EXT2, EXTL1, EXTL2, and EXTL3, have been cloned and identified to participate in the synthesis of heparan in addition to the four enzymes for the synthesis of linkage tetrasaccharide (5Okajima T.

EXT1 and EXT2 are the heparan synthases that have both α1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (α4Gn-T) and β1,4-glucuronyltransferase (β4GlcA-T) activities and elongate the heparan units for polymerization (35Lind T.

Lindahl U. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4834-4838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Three enzymes, EXTL1, EXTL2, and EXTL3, have only α4Gn-T activity and do not have β4GlcA-T activity. EXTL2 and EXTL3 can initiate the synthesis of heparan (38Kitagawa H. Shimakawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13933-13937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) by addition of GlcNAc with an α1,4-linkage to the linkage tetrasaccharide. EXTL1 and EXTL3 can transfer a GlcNAc residue to heparan polymers (39Kim B.T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Saito T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7176-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that CSGalNAc-T plays a similar role in the synthesis of CS as EXTL3 in the synthesis of HS. In the case of chondroitin synthesis, only CSS, CSGlcA-T, and CSGalNAc-T have been reported. If the mechanism of CS synthesis is similar to that of HS synthesis, unknown members, which are each a counterpart to the respective enzyme involved in HS synthesis, may exist to be cloned. CS is ubiquitously synthesized in many tissues and cells, and CSGalNAc-T transcripts were also expressed in all tissues examined, as were the two other genes potentially involved in CS biosynthesis,CSS and CSGlcA-T (18Kitagawa H. Uyama T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38721-38726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 19Gotoh M. Yada T. Sato T. Akashima T. Iwasaki H. Mochizuki H. Inaba N.

The expression of CSGalNAc-T was found to be particularly high in thyroid and placenta in accord with Uyama's report (23Uyama T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8841-8846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Placenta contains significant dermatan sulfate and CS (40Wasserman L. Shlesinger H. Abramovici A. Goldman J.A. Allalouf D. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1980; 138: 763-768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), but the reason for a high level of CSGalNAc-T in thyroid is less easy to understand. CSS and CSGlcA-T transcripts were not elevated in thyroid (19Gotoh M. Yada T. Sato T. Akashima T. Iwasaki H. Mochizuki H. Inaba N. Togayachi A. Kudo T. Watanabe H. Kimata K. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38179-38188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and if the major role of CSGalNAc-T is the initiation of CS, then chains might be initiated on proteoglycans in thyroid but not extended due to a lack of CSS and CSGlcA-T. Further work is required to resolve this. In contrast to the results in tissues, the expression levels of CSGalNAc-T was extremely low in all cell lines examined. This was particularly noticeable for cancer tissues and cultured tumor cells. In cancer tissues the CS content of the extracellular matrix has been shown to be elevated compared with normal tissues (41Sampaio L.O. Dietrich C.P. Filho O.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 498: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 42Jeronimo S.M. Sales A.O. Fernandes M.Z. Melo F.P. Sampaio L.O. Dietrich C.P. Nader H.B. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 1994; 27: 2253-2258PubMed Google Scholar). However, it remains to be determined how the rates of CS synthesis differ among cancer cells in tissues, cells in normal tissue, and in cultured tumor cell lines, and if the expression of CSGalNAc-T is directly correlated with these rates of CS synthesis. Finally, we performed an enzymatic synthesis of a foundation pentasaccharide of CS on a peptide, using a set of recombinant glycosyltransferases. All recombinant enzymes prepared in a soluble form were active in synthesizing the pentasaccharide on the peptide, the sequence of which is the N terminus of bikunin, a Kunitz-type proteinase inhibitor. It is known that CS is synthesized on a serine residue in this region (43Brinkmann T. Weilke C. Kleesiek K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11171-11175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The peptide-sugar chain synthesized enzymatically in vitro would be a very useful tool to investigate which amino acid residues are recognized by each enzyme for CS and HS synthesis and which amino acid residues or sulfations determine the classification of CS and HS. It is also a valuable acceptor substrate to synthesize a complex structure of CS using additional glycosyltransferases and sulfotransferases. This is the first time a chondroitin pentasaccharide has been constructed using recombinant glycosyltransferases in vitro. We thank Seikagaku Corporation for providing acceptor substrates of the linkage tetrasaccharide, GlcA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-O-methoxyphenyl. We also thank Dr. Nobuhito Goda for useful discussion."

Cornell Vet. 1957; 47: 3-41PubMed Google Scholar) are major economic concerns for the swine- and horse-breeding industries worldwide. Both viruses are widespread in the population, can establish persistent infections, and are easily transmitted via both respiratory and venereal routes. PRRSV is currently considered to be a major swine pathogen, causing reproductive failure and severe pneumonia in neonates. Horses infected with EAV are often asymptomatic, but persistently infected stallions (“shedding stallions”) can infect mares through semen, regularly leading to spontaneous abortion of the fetus (3Timoney P.J. Lekeux P. Equine Respiratory Diseases. International Veterinary Information Service, Ithaca, NY2002Google Scholar). Apart from vaccinations that are costly and (given the use of live attenuated vaccines) not without risk (4Botner A. Strandbygaard B. Sorensen K.J. Have P. Madsen K.G. Madsen E.S. Alexandersen S. Vet. Rec. 1997; 141: 497-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), there are currently no effective methods to combat arteriviral diseases. The family Arteriviridae (order Nidovirales) comprises enveloped, mammalian RNA viruses with a 12–16-kilobase positive stranded genome (5Snijder E.J. Meulenberg J.J.M. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. 4th Ed. Fields Virology. 1. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2001: 1205-1220Google Scholar, 6Snijder E.J. Meulenberg J.J. J. Gen.

In addition to the prototype EAV and PRRSV, the family includes the lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus of mice and simian hemorrhagic fever virus. Nidovirus genomes are polycistronic, containing a large 5′-terminal replicase gene, which is expressed from the viral genome RNA, and a downstream set of (largely) structural protein genes. The latter are expressed via the transcription of a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs from the 3′-terminal region of the genome (8Pasternak A.O. van den Born E. Spaan W.J. Snijder E.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7220-7228Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The replicase gene is translated into two multidomain precursor proteins, which are cleaved into mature nonstructural proteins by multiple viral proteinases, a key regulatory mechanism in the nidovirus life cycle (7Ziebuhr J. Snijder E.J. Gorbalenya A.E. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 853-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). In the arterivirus prototype EAV, the replicase gene is translated into open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) and ORF1ab polyproteins of 1,727 and 3,175 amino acids, respectively; the latter product resulting from a ribosomal frameshift that can occur just prior to termination of ORF1a translation. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the EAV ORF1a and ORF1ab proteins are cleaved by three different ORF1a-encoded proteinases, papain-like cysteine proteinases located in nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) and nsp2, and the chymotrypsin-like serine proteinase nsp4 (9den Boon J.A. Snijder E.J. Chirnside E.D. de Vries A.A. Horzinek M.C. Spaan W.J. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2910-2920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following the rapid autocatalytic release of nsp1 and nsp2, the remainder of the polyproteins (nsp3-8 and nsp3-12) is processed by nsp4, the main viral proteinase (10Snijder E.J. Wassenaar A.L. Spaan W.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5755-5764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Probably, internal hydrophobic domains target these proteins to intracellular membranes, which are modified to accommodate viral RNA synthesis (11Pedersen K.W. van der Meer Y. Roos N. Snijder E.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2016-2026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nsp4 main proteinase processes the remaining eight cleavage sites, five in the ORF1a protein (12Snijder E.J. Wassenaar A.L. van Dinten L.C. Spaan W.J. Gorbalenya A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4864-4871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 13Wassenaar A.L. Spaan W.J.M. Gorbalenya A.E. Snijder E.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9313-9322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and three in ORF1b-encoded part of the ORF1ab protein (14van Dinten L.C. Rensen S. Gorbalenya A.E. Snijder E.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2027-2037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which encodes (among other functions) the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and helicase (9den Boon J.A. Snijder E.J. Chirnside E.D. de Vries A.A. Horzinek M.C. Spaan W.J. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2910-2920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternative processing pathways are used during cleavage of the nsp3-8 intermediate (13Wassenaar A.L. Spaan W.J.M. Gorbalenya A.E. Snijder E.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9313-9322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the major pathway, nsp2 associates with nsp3-8 as a cofactor and triggers nsp4 to autocatalytically cleave its C terminus to yield the nsp3-4 and nsp5-8 intermediates. The relatively slow processing of the nsp3↓4 and nsp7↓8 sites ensues (10Snijder E.J. Wassenaar A.L. Spaan W.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5755-5764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the nsp5↓6 and nsp6↓7 bonds are not cleaved, and cleaved nsp6 and nsp7 are not produced. In the minor pathway, nsp2 does not associate with nsp3-8, and the nsp4↓5 junction is not cleaved (13Wassenaar A.L. Spaan W.J.M. Gorbalenya A.E. Snijder E.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9313-9322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, nsp4 does cleave the nsp3↓4, nsp5↓6, nsp6↓7, and nsp7↓8 sites of the nsp3-8 intermediate, indicating that the nsp4 proteinase is fully functional. To provide a structural framework for understanding the complexities of proteolysis in arteriviruses, we have determined the crystallographic structure of EAV nsp4 at 2.0 Å resolution. The structure reveals the smallest chymotrypsin-like fold known as well as a novel C-terminal α/β extension domain. This first structure of an arteriviral proteinase opens new avenues for understanding replicase maturation and establishes a basis for rationally developing antiviral agents. Nsp4 (nt 3417–4025 of the EAV genome; GenBankTM accession numberX53459) was cloned into pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs, Inc.) and expressed as an MBP-nsp4 fusion in Escherichia coliBL21(DE3) (Promega). Expression was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C, and cells were lysed using a French press. MBP-nsp4 was purified by amylose-affinity chromatography and cleaved with 1 unit of thrombin/mg of protein in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.1 and 150 mm NaCl. Following cleavage, nsp4 contained additional residues at its N and C terminus, Ser-Met and Leu-Ala-Ser, respectively. Further purification was achieved using Sepharose G-75 and Mono Q columns (Amersham Biosciences). MBP and uncleaved fusion protein were removed using amylose resin. The integrity of nsp4 was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Crystals were grown at room temperature by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method by mixing 2 μl of protein (25 mg/ml) and 2 μl of 23% (w/v) polyethylene glycol MME 2000, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 10% (w/v) ethylene glycol, and 0.2m ammonium acetate. Crystals grew within 1–2 weeks and had typical dimensions of 0.5 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm. The crystals belonged to space group P1 with cell dimensions a = 56.6, b = 60.7, c = 62.8 Å, α = 74.0°, β = 63.2°, and γ = 66.2°. All data were collected on flash-frozen crystals at 100 K by transferring crystals from the mother liquor or heavy atom soaking solutions into a nitrogen gas stream. Data from the crystal soaked in mersalyl were measured at beamline BM-14-C (BioCARS-CAT, Advanced Photon Source) using an ADSC Quantum-4 detector. All other data were measured using CuKα radiation (Rigaku RU-300 generator, Osmic optics) and a R-AXIS IV++ image plate detector. Data were processed using the HKL suite (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Experimental phases were calculated using SOLVE (16Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). RESOLVE (17Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1755-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) was used for density modification, improving the figure of merit from 0.57 to 0.69, and to generate a partial main-chain trace. The experimental electron density map was further improved by ARP/wARP (18Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar). From this modified electron density map, a nearly complete trace of a single copy in the asymmetric unit was constructed using XFIT (19McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). A model for the complete asymmetric unit was generated by transposing the coordinates of the first copy onto partial models of the other copies and making manual adjustments. Refinement against experimental phase information was performed using CNS (20Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). The model was further refined against the Native 1 data set using REFMAC version 5.0.36 (21Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar) with individual TLS parameters refined separately for the N-terminal barrel, C-terminal barrel, and the C-terminal domain. The Native 1 data set was used for refinement instead of the higher resolution mersalyl data set because of systematic measurement errors in the latter. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were not used at any point during refinement because of significant differences in conformation between different copies. Residues 1–6 are missing from all copies. In addition, the following residues are missing: 204 in copy A, 199–204 in copy B, 198–204 in copy C, and 8 and 204 in copy D. 88.6% of residues lie in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot and 10.7% lie in the additional allowed regions (regions defined by PROCHECK) (22Morris A.L. MacArthur M.W. Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Proteins. 1992; 12: 345-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar). Additional checks on geometry were performed using WHATCHECK (23Hooft R.W.

Open table in a new tab The structure of EAV nsp4 was determined using the multiple isomorphous replacement technique (Fig.2 A; refer to TableI for crystallographic parameters). There are four copies of nsp4 (designated A, B, C, and D) in the triclinic unit cell, each containing two β-barrels as well as a unique C-terminal domain. The N-terminal barrel consists of six β-strands (A1 to F1), while the C-terminal barrel is composed of seven (A2 to G2) (Fig. 2 B). The G2 β-strand is also found in Sindbis virus core protein (SCP) (27Tong L. Wengler G. Rossmann M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 228-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and Semliki forest virus core protein (SFCP) (28Choi H.K., Lu, G. Lee S. Wengler G. Rossmann M.G. Proteins. 1997; 27: 345-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) but is not present in most other chymotrypsin-like proteinases (CLPs). The core of both β-barrels is comprised of conserved hydrophobic residues (Fig. 2 B). In addition, Trp-114 is a conserved, fully solvent exposed hydrophobic residue that lies in a groove lined with other conserved residues near the substrate-binding pockets. This groove and Trp-114 may mediate protein-protein interactions. The most striking feature of the nsp4 structure is the presence of an additional C-terminal domain not found in most other CLPs. This third domain comprises residues 156–204 and consists of two short pairs of β-strands and two α-helices. The C-terminal domain interacts with the C-terminal barrel through an interface (buried surface area of 1638 Å2) consisting of conserved hydrophobic residues: Leu-105 and Leu-112 from the C-terminal β-barrel and Val-158, Leu-163, Phe-167, Ile-182, Leu-196, and Ile-197 from the C-terminal domain. There is also an exposed patch of conserved solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues (Fig. 2 C) that may form part of the interface with nsp5 in the nsp4-5 intermediate. This hydrophobic patch may also mediate interactions with nsp2, which associates with nsp3-8 to induce cleavage of the nsp4↓5 site by nsp4 (13Wassenaar A.L. Spaan W.J.M. Gorbalenya A.E. Snijder E.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9313-9322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The overall conformation of the two β-barrels in all four copies of nsp4 is highly conserved, except for the loops between C1 and D1 and E2 and F2, both of which are flexible and have higher temperature factors (Fig. 2 D). The largest variation in conformation is seen in the position of the C-terminal domain relative to the β-barrels. The root mean square deviations when superimposing the entire molecule range from 0.40 to 0.77 Å and are 11–91% higher than when superimposing only the β-barrels. DYNDOM (29Hayward S. Berendsen H.J. Proteins. 1998; 30: 144-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar) reveals a rotation (residue 157 or 161 as the hinge) of the C-terminal domain relative to the proteinase domain of 11° when comparing copies A and C or C and D. The C-terminal domain can clearly adopt different orientations relative to the two β-barrels, which may facilitate substrate binding or autoproteolysis as discussed below. Despite having little sequence identity to other CLPs, nsp4 was proposed to have a CLP fold (7Ziebuhr J. Snijder E.J. Gorbalenya A.E. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 853-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 12Snijder E.J. Wassenaar A.L. van Dinten L.C. Spaan W.J. Gorbalenya A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4864-4871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The crystal structure confirms the existence of a CLP fold, which at 149 residues is the smallest serine proteinase domain known. Human rhinovirus 2 (HRV-2) 3C is a viral CLP (30Matthews D.A. Dragovich P.S. Webber S.E. Fuhrman S.A. Patick A.K. Zalman L.S. Hendrickson T.F. Love R.A. Prins T.J. Marakovits J.T. Zhou R. Tikhe J. Ford C.E. Meador J.W. Ferre R.A. Brown E.L. Binford S.L. Brothers M.A. DeLisle D.M. Worland S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11000-11007Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) with a similar P1 specificity of substrates to nsp4. A least squares superposition with nsp4 gives an r.m.s.d. of 0.96 Å (40 Cα pairs, cut-off of 1.5 Å) (Fig.3 A). Apart from the additional C-terminal domain in nsp4, a major difference between the two structures is the length of the loop separating strands B2 and C2. In HRV-2 3C and in most other CLPs, this β-hairpin is 10–20 residues longer. The shorter β-hairpin found in nsp4 provides enough space for the seventh β-strand of the C-terminal barrel, G2. A short β-hairpin connecting B2 and C2 is also present in SCP and SFCP, both of which also have G2. The presence of this shorter β-hairpin in SCP may facilitate cis cleavage to produce the viral capsid protein (27Tong L. Wengler G. Rossmann M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 228-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The structures of nsp4 and SCP align well, despite remote sequence similarity, with an r.m.s.d. of 0.95 Å (39 Cαpairs, cut-off of 1.5 Å) (Fig. 3 B). The overall shape of nsp4 is much like SCP as it is more compact than most other CLPs and results from shorter β-hairpins. Another example of a CLP with a specificity for glutamic acid in the P1 position is Streptomyces griseus proteinase E (SGPE) (31Nienaber V.L. Breddam K. Birktoft J.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11469-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 C). Nsp4 and SGPE align well with an r.m.s.d. of 0.86 Å (56 Cα pairs, cut-off of 1.5 Å). The S1 specificity pocket in nsp4, SGPE, and picornaviral 3C proteinases show remarkable structural similarities. A recently reported structure of a coronavirus chymotrypsin-like cysteine main proteinase from the transmissible gastroenteritis virus in pigs reveals the only other structure of a CLP with an additional C-terminal domain (32Anand K. Palm G.J. Mesters J.R. Siddell S.G. Ziebuhr J. Hilgenfeld R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3213-3224Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Coronaviruses comprise the distantly related second family in the order Nidovirales (7Ziebuhr J. Snijder E.J. Gorbalenya A.E. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 853-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Unlike nsp4, the structure of the C-terminal domain in the coronavirus proteinase is nearly twice as large at 110 residues and is comprised of only α-helices. In addition, the linker between the C-terminal domain and the C-terminal β-barrel differs markedly from that found in nsp4. Despite the lack of sequence and structural similarity, the C-terminal domains in both arteriviruses and coronaviruses may share a common functionality in facilitating substrate recognition (32Anand K. Palm G.J. Mesters J.R. Siddell S.G. Ziebuhr J. Hilgenfeld R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3213-3224Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of nsp4 reveals that His-39, Asp-65, and Ser-120 form a catalytic triad similar to that of other CLPs (Fig. 2 A), confirming the predictions from sequence analysis (9den Boon J.A. Snijder E.J. Chirnside E.D. de Vries A.A. Horzinek M.C. Spaan W.J. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2910-2920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and site-directed mutagenesis (12Snijder E.J. Wassenaar A.L. van Dinten L.C. Spaan W.J. Gorbalenya A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4864-4871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The active sites in all four copies of nsp4 adopt a very similar conformation (Fig. 4 A), except for the peptide bond between residues 117 and 118. The distances between Ser-120 Oγ and His-39 Nε2 range from 2.8 to 3.5 Å, and the distances between His-39 Nδ1 and the two carboxylate oxygen atoms of Asp-65 range from 2.8 to 3.0 Å. These distances are similar to values seen in other CLPs. The rotamer adopted by Ser-120 is the same as in other CLPs (χ1 ∼ −80°). In CLPs, the oxyanion hole (in nsp4, main chain amides between residues 118 and 120) stabilizes the negative charge on the P1 carbonyl oxygen atom in the tetrahedral intermediate. Remarkably, in three of the four copies, the amide nitrogen of Gly-118 points away from Ser-120, causing the collapse of the oxyanion hole (Fig. 4, A andB). In contrast, the oxyanion hole is properly formed in copy B (Fig. 4 C), where the only major difference between the other copies is the conformation of the peptide bond between residues 117 and 118. This represents an interconversion of a type I (copies A, C, and D) to a type II (copy B) β-turn. The psi angle of Ser-117 in copy B is 136°, and for copies A, C, and D it ranges between −41 and −51°. The phi angle of Gly-118 in copy B is 116° whereas that for copies A, C, and D ranges between −59 and −64°. This is a common type of peptide flip observed in pairs of homologous protein structures, especially with a glycine residue in the i + 1 position of the flipped peptide bond (33Hayward S. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2219-2227Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Molecular orbital calculations indicate an energy barrier of ∼3 kcal/mol for this flip (34Gunasekaran K. Gomathi L. Ramakrishnan C. Chandrasekhar J. Balaram P. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1505-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Nsp4 is the first example of a wild-type serine proteinase in which alternate conformations of the oxyanion hole are observed. Previously, a collapsed oxyanion hole was observed in an active site cysteine to alanine mutant of HAV 3C proteinase (35Allaire M. Chernaia M.M. Malcolm B.A. James M.N. Nature. 1994; 369: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The collapsed oxyanion hole in nsp4 may be part of a novel mechanism regulating proteolytic activity. An important structural feature stabilizing the collapsed conformation of the oxyanion hole is a water molecule that forms hydrogen bonds with Ser-120 Oγ and His-39 Nε2 (Fig.4 B). A second water molecule hydrogen bonds with His-134 Nε2 and the main-chain carbonyl oxygen atom of Thr-116. These hydrogen bonds can only form if the oxyanion hole adopts a collapsed conformation, and hence these water molecules are absent from copy B. Previous studies have shown that nsp4 has a specificity for Glu (and in one case Gln) at the P1 position (7Ziebuhr J. Snijder E.J. Gorbalenya A.E. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 853-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 12Snijder E.J. Wassenaar A.L. van Dinten L.C. Spaan W.J. Gorbalenya A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4864-4871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar,14van Dinten L.C. Rensen S. Gorbalenya A.E. Snijder E.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2027-2037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As in the picornaviral 3C proteinases and SGPE, which have specificity for either Gln or Glu in the P1 position, nsp4 also has a conserved histidine residue (His-134 in nsp4, His-161 inHRV-2 3C, His-213 in SGPE) at the base of the S1 specificity pocket, and a conserved Ser/Thr residue lining one “wall” of the S1 pocket (Thr-115 in nsp4, Thr-142 in HRV-2 3C, Ser-192 in SGPE) (Fig.5 A). The histidine in the S1 pocket hydrogen bonds to the P1 side-chain carbonyl oxygen atom of an inhibitor bound to HRV-2 3C (30Matthews D.A. Dragovich P.S. Webber S.E. Fuhrman S.A. Patick A.K. Zalman L.S. Hendrickson T.F. Love R.A. Prins T.J. Marakovits J.T. Zhou R. Tikhe J. Ford C.E. Meador J.W. Ferre R.A. Brown E.L. Binford S.L. Brothers M.A. DeLisle D.M. Worland S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11000-11007Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and to one of the glutamate carboxylate oxygens of the P1 side chain of a peptide bound to SGPE (31Nienaber V.L. Breddam K. Birktoft J.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11469-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thr-142 in HRV-2 3C and Ser-192 in SGPE also hydrogen bond to the carbonyl or carboxylate oxygen atoms of the P1 side chain. Because the structures of the active site and S1 pocket are conserved, His-134 and Thr-115 in nsp4 could also donate hydrogen bonds to the carboxylate oxygen atom of the P1 side chain in substrates. Site-directed mutagenesis studies confirm that His-134 is essential for the efficient processing of the EAV polyprotein cleavage sites (12Snijder E.J. Wassenaar A.L. van Dinten L.C. Spaan W.J. Gorbalenya A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4864-4871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thr-115 can be replaced by serine, glycine, and asparagine with variable effects on cleavage specificity and efficiency (12Snijder E.J. Wassenaar A.L. van Dinten L.C. Spaan W.J. Gorbalenya A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4864-4871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Both nsp4 and SGPE prefer glutamic acid over glutamine in the P1 position of substrates. In SGPE, Ser-216 hydrogen bonds with the carboxylate oxygen atom (not interacting with His-213 or Ser-192) of the P1 side chain. Ser-216 cannot hydrogen bond with the amide nitrogen of a P1 glutamine side chain, because the lone pair already accepts a hydrogen bond from the main-chain amide of Gly-219; this proposal is supported by site-directed mutagenesis studies (36Stennicke H.R. Birktoft J.J. Breddam K. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2266-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In nsp4, Ser-137 occupies the same position as Ser-216 in SGPE and should also recognize a negatively charged P1 residue (Fig. 5 B). In picornaviral 3C proteinases, which prefer glutamine at the P1 position, a glycine is found in lieu of serine. Nsp4 is known to cleave its N and C termini in the nsp3-8 intermediate (7Ziebuhr J. Snijder E.J. Gorbalenya A.E. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 853-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 12Snijder E.J. Wassenaar A.L. van Dinten L.C. Spaan W.J. Gorbalenya A.E. J. Biol.

Although nsp4 can cleave several sites in trans (14van Dinten L.C. Rensen S. Gorbalenya A.E. Snijder E.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2027-2037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), self-processing may also be a cis event. To act as both an enzyme and a substrate in cis reactions and to act as an enzyme in trans reactions, nsp4 must adopt alternate conformations. The N or C termini must be either in or away from the substrate-binding pocket for cis and transcleavages, respectively. In the nsp4 crystal structure, the chain termini are remarkably close together and do not lie in the substrate-binding pocket. The positions adopted by the chain termini likely differ from that adopted during cis cleavage to prevent self-inhibition of proteolytic activity, as in picornaviral proteinases (35Allaire M. Chernaia M.M. Malcolm B.A. James M.N. Nature. 1994; 369: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 37Petersen J.F. Cherney M.M. Liebig H.D. Skern T. Kuechler E. James M.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5463-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Each terminus can be brought into the appropriate position for cis cleavage by a conformational rearrangement of the ten N-terminal residues or part of the C-terminal domain. In support of this possibility, the N-terminal six residues are disordered and residues 198–203 have higher than average temperature factors (in copies A and D) or are completely disordered (in copies B and C). One of the few hydrogen-bonding interactions fixing the position of the C terminus is the Asp-119:Arg-203 ion pair. Although Asp-119 is conserved in arteriviral proteinases, Arg-203 is not. Interestingly, Arg-4, which is disordered in all four copies of nsp4, is conserved among arteriviral proteinases. Even though the N-terminal six residues are disordered, the position adopted by Lys-7 indicates that Arg-4 may be able to interact with Asp-119 in an alternate conformation. When the C terminus adopts the conformation required for ciscleavage, the Asp-119:Arg-203 ion pair must be broken, thereby allowing Arg-4 to interact with Asp-119. Our crystallographic analysis of EAV nsp4 elucidates the structural basis of proteolytic processing in arteriviruses. Nsp4 adopts alternate conformations of the oxyanion hole, which may be a novel means of regulating proteolytic activity. The structure reveals how the C-terminal extension interacts with the chymotrypsin-like domains and suggests how it may mediate the formation of multiprotein complexes to control proteolytic processing pathways critical to the viral life cycle. Understanding the structural details of proteolytic processing in arteriviruses and other nidoviruses will allow for the design of novel antiviral agents."

Although it is generally believed that V-ATPases transport protons by a rotary catalytic mechanism analogous to that used by F1F0-ATPases, the structure and subunit composition of the central or peripheral stalk of the multisubunit complex are not well understood. We searched for proteins that bind to the E subunit of V-ATPase using the yeast two-hybrid assay and identified the H subunit as an interacting partner. Physical association between the E and H subunits of V-ATPase was confirmedin vitro by precipitation assays. Deletion mapping analysis revealed that a 78-amino acid fragment at the amino terminus of the E subunit was sufficient for binding to the H subunit. Expression of the amino-terminal fragments of the E subunits from human and yeast as dominant-negative mutants resulted in dramatic decreases in bafilomycin A1-sensitive ATP hydrolysis and proton transport activities of V-ATPase. Our data demonstrate the physiological significance of the interaction between the E and H subunits of V-ATPase and extend previous studies on the arrangement of subunits on the peripheral stalk of V-ATPase.

They are essential for the normal function of secretory vesicles, the trans-Golgi network, endosomes, lysosomes, the yeast vacuole, and other intracellular membrane compartments (1Stevens T.H.

In some specialized cells such as the intercalated cells of the kidney and the osteoclasts, V-ATPases reside at high levels on the plasma membrane, where they are responsible for transepithelial or cellular proton transport required for normal acid-base homeostasis and bone remodeling (2Gluck S.L.

Despite their wide range of physiological functions, V-ATPases share a highly conserved structure and common enzymatic properties that couple hydrolysis of cytosolic ATP to proton transport out of the cytosol (3Nelson N.

They contain two macrodomains or sectors: V1, a catalytic domain composed of peripheral membrane proteins, and V0, a transmembrane domain composed of intrinsic membrane proteins that transmits protons through the lipid bilayer (4Kane P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The V1 domain attaches to the V0domain at the cytoplasmic face of the membrane. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the V1 domain is composed of eight distinct polypeptide chains, and the V0 domain contains five (4Kane P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). V-ATPases are evolutionarily related and structurally similar to F1F0-ATPases (F-ATPases) of bacteria, chloroplasts, and mitochondria (3Nelson N. Biochim. Biophys.

F-ATPases also have two sectors: F1, a peripherally attached complex composed of a catalytic head and a stalk, and F0, composed of intrinsic membrane subunits and a stator arm. F-ATPases have a rotary catalytic mechanism (5Nakamoto R.L. Ketchum C.J. Al-Shawi M.K. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 205-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 6Cherapanov D.A. Mulkidjian A.Y. Junge W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 7Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The proton electrochemical gradient across the membrane drives translocation of protons through a pathway composed of the a and c subunits in the F0 sector, thought to drive rotation of a “wheel” of c subunits and consequently rotation of the attached F1 stalk. Rotation of the F1 stalk produces conformational changes in the catalytic head of F1, driving ATP synthesis. A stator arm, composed of long cytosolic extensions of the F0 b subunit attached to the F1 δ subunit, holds the α3β3 catalytic head of F1 in place against the rotation of the central stalk. Although the structure of V-ATPase remains less well defined, it is generally believed that the mechanical coupling of the V1and V0 complexes occurs by a mechanism analogous to that of F-ATPase. Electron microscopy analysis confirms the presence of a central shaft and a peripheral stalk in bacterial and bovine V-ATPases (8Boekema E.J. Ubbink-Kok T. Lolkema J.S. Brisson A. Konings W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14291-14293Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 9Wilkens S. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31804-31810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The A and B subunits of V-ATPase are arrayed as a hexagon around a central stalk. The A subunit shares homology with the β subunit of F-ATPase and is the site of ATP hydrolysis. The B subunit, a homolog of the F1F0 α subunit, may have a regulatory role in ATP hydrolysis. There are two isoforms of the B subunit that are encoded by different genes and have unique amino- and carboxyl-terminal sequences. The proteolipid subunits of V-ATPase are also homologous to the corresponding subunits of F-ATPase that form the proton pore. Other subunits of V-ATPase have limited or no amino acid sequence similarity to any subunits of F-ATPase. Although they are believed to function structurally in connecting the V1 and V0 domains either on the central or peripheral stalk, the subunit composition, structure, and subunit interactions of the V1 stalk and the putative stator arm of V-ATPases are not well understood. Recent studies have begun to reveal some of the subunit interactions of the V-ATPase stalk. Using yeast two-hybrid assay and co-immunoprecipitation, Landolt-Marticorena et al. (10Landolt-Marticorena C. Williams K.M. Correa J. Chen W. Manolson M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15449-15457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) showed that the a subunit of V-ATPase interacts with the H and A subunits. Arata et al. (11Arata Y. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3357-3363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) showed that the B and E subunits of V-ATPase are in close proximity to each other by introducing unique cysteine residues into a cysteine-less form of the B subunit of V-ATPase and cross-linking purified vacuolar membranes. Their findings suggest that the E subunit forms part of the peripheral stalk of V-ATPase. In this study, we report the site of interaction and physiological significance of the interaction between the V-ATPase E and H subunits. A 78-amino acid (aa) domain from the amino terminus of the E subunit of V-ATPase is required for binding to the H subunit and for maintaining proper V-ATPase function. Detection of the interaction between the E and H subunits of V-ATPase suggests that both subunits form part of the peripheral stalk of V-ATPase that anchors on V1 via binding to the B subunit and on V0 via binding to the a subunit. The high-fidelity Expand Long enzyme system was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Restriction endonucleases and T4 DNA ligase were obtained from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). The yeast expression vectors YC2/CT and YES3/CT were from Invitrogen. Monoclonal antibody against the B subunit of V-ATPase (13D11) was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Monoclonal antibody against the His tag was from QIAGEN Inc. (Valencia, CA). Zymolyase 100T was purchased from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Bafilomycin A1, 3-aminotriazole, and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside were from Sigma. [35S]Methionine was obtained from AmershamBiosciences. The 1.2-kbNcoI-SmaI cDNA fragment containing the entire coding region of the human E subunit of V-ATPase was isolated from a Bluescript SK recombinant plasmid and cloned in-frame into the multiple cloning site on the yeast expression vector pAS2-1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). PJ69 yeast cells harboring three reporter genes (12James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were prepared by treatment with lithium acetate (LiAc). 0.1 μg of DNA was added to 100 μl of competent cells, followed by addition of 600 μl of sterile polyethylene glycol/LiAc solution (0.1 m LiAc, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), and 1 mm EDTA). The transformation mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with shaking, treated with 10% Me2SO, heat-shocked at 42 °C for 15 min, and spread onto 100-mm plates of minimal synthetic medium lacking tryptophan. Colonies of yeast cells were allowed to grow for 4 days and harvested for subsequent transformation with a human kidney cDNA expression library in the vector pACT2 (Clontech). After selection for growth on Ade−/Leu−/Trp− triple-dropout plates, positive clones were streaked on His−/Leu−/Trp− dropout plates in the presence of 1 mm 3-aminotriazole and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. Processing of the positive clones was performed as described (13Lu M. Holliday L.S. Zhang L. Dunn W.A. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30407-30413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The selected two-hybrid colonies were grown overnight in yeast/peptone/dextrose medium to stationary phase in polypropylene tubes. 1 ml of the overnight culture was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged for 30 s at room temperature. The supernatants were removed, and the cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of breaking buffer (2% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 8), and 1 mm EDTA). 0.3 g of glass beads and 200 μl of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) were added to the resuspended cells. The samples were vortexed for 2 min and centrifuged for 5 min at room temperature. The aqueous upper phase was carefully collected, treated with 10 units of RNase A for 10 min at 37 °C, and applied to a QIAGEN mini-preparation spin column. After centrifugation for 1 min, the columns were washed twice with 70% ethanol, and DNA was eluted from the columns with 10 mm Tris (pH 8) and 1 mm EDTA. Recombinant plasmids were recovered either by electroporation in DH5α bacteria (Invitrogen) or by high-fidelity PCR amplification (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using primers 5′-CTATTCGATGATGAAGATACCCCACCAAACCCAAAAAAAGAG-3′ and 5′-GTGAACTTGCGGGGTTTTTCAGTATCTACGAT-3′ flanking the cloning site on the yeast expression vector and the Expand Long enzyme system, which generates mutations at a rate of only one nucleotide in every 10 kb of DNA. DNA sequencing was carried out by incubation with BigDye terminators and read by an automatic DNA sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The derived DNA sequences were analyzed by searching the GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank for homology to known DNA and peptide sequences. The entire coding region of the human V-ATPase E subunit cDNA was amplified by high-fidelity PCR as described above using the forward primer 5′-AATTGGATCCATGGCTCTCAGCGATGCTGACGTGC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GAGAGAATTCGTCCAAAAACTTCCTGTTGGCATTTGC-3′. The PCR-amplified product was purified with a QIAEX II kit (QIAGEN Inc.), digested with the restriction enzymes BamHI andEcoRI (Invitrogen) using the manufacturer's buffer solution, purified again with the QIAEX II kit, and cloned in-frame into the GST expression vector pGEX-2TK (Amersham Biosciences). Clones containing the fusion construct were identified by DNA mini-preparation and restriction enzyme digestion and verified by DNA sequencing as described (14Holliday L.S., Lu, M. Lee B.S.

Bacterial colonies were inoculated in LB medium containing ampicillin and grown for 15 h at 37 °C in a shaking incubator. The cultures were diluted 1:10 and grown for 4 h; isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm; and incubation was continued for 1 h. Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 2 min and resuspended in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cell lysis was carried out by sonication (Sonic Dismembrater, Fisher) for 2 × 30 s. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1% to minimize aggregation of the fusion protein with bacterial proteins. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 5 min, and the supernatants were collected, mixed with a 50% slurry of glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The beads were collected by centrifugation, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and stored at 4 °C in the presence of bovine serum albumin and protease inhibitors. The H subunit of V-ATPase from a human kidney cDNA expression library was amplified by high-fidelity PCR using the forward primer 5′-GCATGAATTCATGACCAAAATGGATATCCG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-ACACAAGCTTCAGGCTTAGCTTCGGGCG-3′. After restriction enzyme digestion with EcoRI and HindIII, the cDNA fragment was cloned in-frame into the bacterial expression vector pET33b (Novagen, Madison, WI). Recombinant DNA clones were identified by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. Purified plasmid DNA was used to produce a 35S-labeled H subunit by in vitrotranslation using T7 RNA polymerase, [35S]methionine, and the TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). The35S-labeled H subunit was incubated with 2 μg of GST-E subunit fusion protein bound to 30 μl of glutathione beads (Sigma) in Nonidet P-40 buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 50 mm Tris (pH 8)) at 4 °C for 3 h with shaking. The beads were recovered by centrifugation, washed five times with Nonidet P-40 buffer, resuspended in Laemmli sample loading buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 60 mmTris (pH 6.8), and 0.001% bromphenol blue), and boiled for 3 min. After centrifugation, the supernatants were collected and applied to SDS-polyacrylamide gels for autoradiography analysis. Deletion mutants of the E and H subunits of V-ATPase were made by PCR using the high-fidelity Long Expand enzyme system and oligonucleotide primers as follows: wild-type Ea, 5′-AATTCCATGGTGGCTCTCAGCGATGCTGAC-3′; wild-type Eb, 5′-ATATGGATCCGTCCAAAAACTTCCTGTTGGC-3′; E-Na, 5′-AATTCCATGGTGGCTCTCAGCGATGCTGAC-3′; E-Nb, 5′-ATATGGATCCTGCAGCCTTTACCAGAG-3′; E-Ca, 5′-AATTCCATGGGAATGATTGTTCGTTGCAGG-3′; E-Cb, 5′-ATATGGATCCGTCCAAAAACTTCCTGTTGGC-3′; E-N1a, 5′-AATTCCATGGTGGCTCTCAGCGATGCTGAC-3′; E-N1b, 5′-ATATGGATCCGATTCATCAAATTGGACATCTG-3′; E-N2a, 5′-AATTCCATGGAGCAGCAGAAGAAAATTCAG-3′; E-N2b, 5′-ATATGGATCCTGCAGCCTTTACCAGAG-3′; E-N11a, 5′-AATTCCATGGTGGCTCTCAGCGATGCTGAC-3′; E-N11b, 5′-ATATGGATCCTTTAGTCTTTGGGTTTGCAC-3′; E-N12a, 5′-AATTCCATGGTGCTTGTGCAAACCCAAAGAC-3′; E-N12b, 5′-ATATGGATCCGATTCATCAAATTGGACATCTG-3′; H-Na, 5′-AATTCCATGGTGGATATCCGAGGTGCTG-3′; H-Nb, 5′-ACACGAATTCGAGGACTGAATGCCAGGAG-3′; H-Ca, 5′-AATTCCATGGACAAGTGTGGCTTTCAGCTC-3′; H-Cb, 5′-ACACGAATTCAGGCTTAGCTTCGGGCG-3′. Amplified cDNA fragments were digested with restriction enzymes; purified; and cloned into the pAS2-1 and pGEX-2TK expression vectors, respectively. The sequences of all mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Yeast two-hybrid assay and GST precipitation assay were carried out as described above. Yeast cells were grown in supplemented minimal medium lacking methionine, harvested by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min, resuspended in pretreatment buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) and 10 mmdithiothreitol), and incubated for 5 min. Spheroplasts were generated by treatment with zymolyase 100T for 20 min in buffer containing 1% glucose, 1 m sorbitol, 50 mmK2HPO4, and 16 mm citric acid (pH 5.8); labeled with 35[S]methionine for 60 min; lysed in solubilization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% C12E9) for 15 min; and incubated with anti-B subunit antibody 13D11 for 60 min. After another 60-min incubation with protein A-agarose beads, the immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed three times and incubated for 5 min at 70 °C in 50 μl of cracking buffer (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.0), 8 m urea, 5% SDS, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol) for SDS-PAGE and autoradiography analysis. Quantitation of the V0 and V1 subunits was performed using a densitometer. Vacuolar membrane vesicles were prepared from mid-log phase yeast cells for examination of ATPase activity and proton transport. Cells were treated with zymolyase (15Uchida E. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1090-1095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the spheroplasts were resuspended in Buffer A (12% Ficoll 400, 0.1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mmMes/Tris (pH 6.9)); homogenized in a loosely fitting Dounce homogenizer with 15–20 strokes; and centrifuged in a swinging bucket rotor at 4500 × g for 10 min to remove unlysed cells, mitochondria, and nuclei. The supernatants were transferred to clean centrifuge tubes, and Buffer A were layered on top. The tubes were centrifuged at 52,000 × g. The white layer on top of the tubes containing the vacuoles was collected and resuspended in Buffer A with a homogenizer. Buffer B (8% Ficoll 400, 0.1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Mes/Tris (pH 6.9)) was layered on top. After recentrifugation under the same conditions, vacuoles free from contaminating lipid granules and other membranous organelles were recovered from the top of the tubes. Purified vacuolar membrane vesicles were prepared for experimental studies by dilution in Buffer C (25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Mes/Tris (pH 6.9)). Bafilomycin A1-sensitive ATP hydrolysis of vacuolar membranes was assayed by measuring the production of inorganic phosphate using a modified Ames assay as described by Taussky and Shorr (16Taussky H.H. Shorr E. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 202: 675-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, vacuolar membrane vesicles in ATPase buffer (150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm vanadate, and 1 mm azide (pH 6.75)) were preincubated for 15 min at room temperature in the presence and absence of bafilomycin A1. The reaction was initiated by addition of ATP at a final concentration of 3 mm and stopped by addition of trichloroacetic acid. The samples were extracted with chloroform to remove lipid and detergent. After centrifugation, the upper aqueous phase was transferred to clean test tubes and incubated with buffers containing ascorbic acid and ammonium molybdate. The concentration of inorganic phosphate was measured by a spectrophotometer at 700 nm and converted to rate of ATP hydrolysis. Proton transport activity was measured by ATP-dependent quenching of acridine orange using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences fluorescence spectrometer with excitation at 493 nm and emission at 545 nm (17Gluck S. Cannon C. Al-Awqati Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4327-4331Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Purified vacuolar membrane vesicles were resuspended in 25 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 25 mm KCl, 5 mmacridine orange, and 5 mm MgCl2 in the presence and absence of bafilomycin A1. ATP was added at a final concentration of 5 mm to initiate transport. We previously cloned the gene coding for the E subunit of V-ATPase (18Hirsch S. Strauss A. Masood K. Lee S. Sukhatme V. Gluck S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3004-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and made monoclonal antibodies against its protein product (19Hemken P. Guo X.L. Wang Z.Q. Zhang K. Gluck S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9948-9957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To search for protein binding partners of the E subunit, we performed yeast two-hybrid assays using the E subunit as the bait, selecting from a human kidney cDNA expression library. One of the first cDNA clones identified as interacting with the E subunit was the H subunit of V-ATPase (13Lu M. Holliday L.S. Zhang L. Dunn W.A. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30407-30413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This finding is consistent with a previous report indicating that the E subunit could be cross-linked to the H subunit of V-ATPase from bovine clathrin-coated vesicles (20Xu T. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28909-28915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In a yeast two-hybrid assay, true positive colonies express selectable reporter genes only when the bait fusion protein interacts with the target fusion protein. False-positive colonies carry plasmids that do not encode hybrid proteins interacting directly with the bait protein and express reporter genes by other mechanisms (21Bartel P. Chien C.T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 920-924PubMed Google Scholar). The use of three different reporter genes (ADE, HIS3, andlacZ) under the control of different promoters eliminates many false-positive colonies, particularly from proteins that do not bind to the bait fusion protein, but instead interact directly with promoter sequences flanking the Gal4-binding site or with proteins bound to the flanking sequences (12James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, putative true positive clones should be independently tested for binding to the bait protein. To confirm the interaction between the E and H subunits of V-ATPase, we performed precipitation assays with GST-E subunit fusion proteins. The coding sequence for the E subunit was ligated in-frame to the coding sequence for GST in a bacterial expression vector as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The resulting GST-E subunit fusion protein was purified from bacteria with glutathione-agarose beads and incubated with the H subunit protein labeled in vitro with [35S]methionine. After extensive washing, the glutathione beads were boiled in sample buffer, and the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Binding of the labeled H subunit to the GST-E subunit fusion protein was evident in the precipitation assay (Fig. 1, first lane). In contrast, no binding to GST was detected (Fig. 1, second lane). To identify domains in the E and H subunits required for the interaction, we carried out deletion mapping analysis. Two overlapping cDNA subfragments were amplified by high-fidelity PCR from the coding region of the E subunit, designated E-N (aa 1–148) and E-C (aa 132–226) (Fig. 2 A), and fused in-frame with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in the two-hybrid vector pAS2-1. The resulting fusion plasmids were cotransformed into PJ69 cells with the pACT2 vector containing the H subunit and selected for cell growth on dropout plates. Colonies were observed from cells harboring E-N, indicating that the interaction domain in the E subunit required for interaction with the H subunit resides in the amino terminus of the E subunit from aa 1 to 148. In contrast, no growth of yeast cells was detected on dropout plates when transformed with E-C. Subsequent deletion mapping analysis of the amino terminus of the E subunit revealed a region of 78 aa (aa 1–78), E-N1, as the binding domain required for interaction with the H subunit (Fig.2 A). As indicated by β-galactosidase activity, the interaction between E-N1 and the H subunit generated target gene activation at a level similar to that observed with the full-length E and H subunits. Additional deletions in the 78-aa region, E-N11 and E-N12, failed to bind to the H subunit (Fig. 2 A). Two overlapping deletion mutants covering the entire coding region of the H subunit were also prepared. Neither H subunit fragment showed interaction with the E subunit, suggesting that the entire H subunit might be required to fold to a particular configuration for interaction with the E subunit. We used GST precipitation assays to examine the H subunit-binding domain at the amino terminus of the E subunit in greater detail. A construct was prepared expressing a chimeric protein consisting of the 78-aa fragment at the amino terminus of the E subunit in tandem with the GST protein. The fusion protein was purified using glutathione beads and incubated with the H subunit protein labeled with [35S]methionine. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the H subunit bound directly to the fusion protein containing the 78-aa amino-terminal fragment of the E subunit. To investigate the significance of the interaction between the V-ATPase E and H subunits, we examined the physiological effects of expression of the amino-terminal domain of the E subunit in yeast. The 78-aa fragment at the amino terminus of the human E subunit and the corresponding fragment of the yeast E subunit were separately cloned into the yeast expression vector YC2/CT and used to transform PJ69 cells. Sequence comparison analysis revealed a high degree of homology in this region of the E subunit between human and yeast (Fig.3). Yeast vacuoles were isolated from the transformed cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Bafilomycin A1-sensitive ATPase and proton transport activities were measured on prepared vacuolar membrane vesicles. As shown in Fig. 4, a marked decrease in both ATPase activity and proton translocation was observed in cells expressing the human or yeast E subunit amino-terminal fragment. As expected, expression of the wild-type yeast E subunit (Vma4) using the same vector resulted in no noticeable changes in ATPase activity and proton transport. The reduction in ATPase activity correlated well with decreases in proton transport (Fig. 4), suggesting no disruption of coupling between the V1 and V0domains.Figure 4Bafilomycin A1-sensitive ATP hydrolysis and proton transport of V-ATPase. A, vacuolar membrane vesicles were isolated from yeast cells harboring the empty vector (Wild-type), the full-length human E subunit (Wild-type HE), the 78-aa amino-terminal domain of the human E subunit (HE78), the full-length yeast E subunit (Wild-type YE), and the corresponding 83-aa domain of the yeast E subunit (YE83). After preincubation in the presence and absence of bafilomycin A1, ATP was added as substrate to start the reaction. Hydrolytic activity was assayed for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of trichloroacetic acid. The samples were extracted with chloroform to remove lipid and detergent. After centrifugation, the upper aqueous phase was transferred to clean test tubes and incubated with buffers containing ascorbic acid and ammonium molybdate. The concentration of inorganic phosphate was measured by a spectrophotometer at 700 nm and converted to rate of ATP hydrolysis.B, proton-pumping activity was measured by tracking the ATP-dependent quenching of acridine orange using a fluorescence spectrometer with excitation at 493 nm and emission at 545 nm (17Gluck S. Cannon C. Al-Awqati Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4327-4331Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Purified vacuolar membrane vesicles were resuspended in 25 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 25 mm KCl, 5 mmacridine orange, and 5 mm MgCl2 in the presence and absence of bafilomycin A1. ATP was added at a final concentration of 5 mm to initiate transport. Proton transport rate was determined as the slope of the quench that gave a linear response during the first 10 s immediately after addition of ATP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although expression of the amino-terminal domain of the E subunit resulted in dramatic decreases in ATP hydrolysis and proton-pumping activities, significant levels of residual V-ATPase activities remained in yeast cells harboring the dominant-negative mutants (Fig. 4). The residual V-ATPase activities could be due to insufficient levels of expression of the dominant-negative mutants. Alternatively, disruption of the interaction between the E and H subunits of V-ATPase might lead to only partial ablation of V-ATPase function, and other protein-protein interactions might contribute to the residual V-ATPase activities.

The precise actions of Hsp47 remain unclear, however. To evaluate the effects of Hsp47 on collagen production we infected human vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) with a retrovirus containing Hsp47 cDNA. SMCs overexpressing Hsp47 secreted type I procollagen faster than SMCs transduced with empty vector, yielding a greater accumulation of proα1(I) collagen in the extracellular milieu. Interestingly, the amount of intracellular proα1(I) collagen was also increased. This was associated with an unexpected increase in the rate of proα1(I) collagen chain synthesis and 2.5-fold increase in proα1(I) collagen mRNA expression, without a change in fibronectin expression. This amplification of procollagen expression, synthesis, and secretion by Hsp47 imparted SMCs with an enhanced capacity to elaborate a fibrillar collagen network. The effects of Hsp47 were qualitatively distinct from, and independent of, those of ascorbate and the combination of both factors yielded an even more intricate fibril network. Given thein vitro impact of altered Hsp47 expression on procollagen production, we sought evidence for interindividual variability in Hsp47 expression and identified a common, single nucleotide polymorphism in the Hsp47 gene promoter among African Americans that significantly reduced promoter activity. Together, these findings indicate a novel means by which type I collagen production is regulated by the endoplasmic reticulum constituent, Hsp47, and suggest a potential basis for inherent differences in collagen production within the population.

Within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),1 two proα1(I) collagen chains and one proα2(I) collagen chain first associate at their globular carboxyl termini (1Engel J. Prockop D.J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 137-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). This interaction is facilitated by protein-disulfide isomerase and stabilized by interchain disulfide bonds (2Doege K.J.

The exact mechanism by which Hsp47 contributes to the production of procollagen is unclear, however.

Although there is experimental support for each of these potential roles, a cohesive model has yet to emerge and not all of the data are consistent. For example, it remains unclear whether the interaction between Hsp47 and procollagen slows or accelerates procollagen transport. The former might be expected if Hsp47 serves to maintain the folded conformation during stress, whereas the latter would be more likely if Hsp47 plays a direct role in winding of the nascent proα collagen chains (24Dafforn T.R. Della M. Miller A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49310-49319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Evidence for both speeding (27Tomita M. Yoshizato K. Nagata K.

(Tokyo). 1998; 124: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) of procollagen secretion by Hsp47 has been reported.To examine the effects of Hsp47 on type I collagen production, we have introduced the human Hsp47 gene into a collagen-producing human cell. For this, we have used human vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), which are critical to the elaboration of collagen in the vessel wall (29Rocnik E.F. Chan B.M.C. Pickering J.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1889-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 30Davies M.J. Thomas A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1984; 310: 1137-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). This allowed us to evaluate the response to elevated levels of Hsp47 in the context of a fully functional pathway for procollagen biosynthesis. The results indicate that Hsp47 has the capacity to drive collagen production by a mechanism that involves up-regulation of proα1(I) collagen gene expression and stimulation of procollagen chain synthesis, in concert with enhanced procollagen secretion. We also provide evidence for interindividual genomic variants associated with Hsp47, which, together with the identified effects on procollagen production, implicate Hsp47 as a determinant of collagen elaboration in the population.DISCUSSIONHsp47 has a number of attributes that distinguish it from other ER-resident chaperones. These include its specificity for procollagens as well as an atypical binding profile whereby it interacts with both folded and unfolded conformations of its target protein (11Ferreira L.R. Norris K. Smith T. Hebert C. Sauk J.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 56: 518-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 13Satoh M. Hirayoshi K. Yokota S.-I. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 14Nakai A. Satoh M. Hirayoshi K. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar,16Tasab M. Batten M.R. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2204-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The results of the current study indicate that Hsp47 can act as a primary stimulator of type I collagen production. Selectively increasing the amount of Hsp47 within SMCs reconfigured the collagen production phenotype such that both intracellular and extracellular steady-state levels of type I procollagen were increased. This profile was associated with up-regulated proα1(I)collagen gene expression, an increased rate of type I procollagen chain synthesis, and faster procollagen secretion. The net effect was the elaboration of an extensive network of type I collagen fibrils. These findings point to a novel pathway for controlling type I collagen production and suggest a linkage between an ER-resident protein and the machinery for procollagen expression.The pool of intracellular procollagen that formed in SMCs within 1 h of adding labeled methionine was substantially increased in Hsp47-overexpressing SMCs compared with control SMCs. Expansion of this particular pool of procollagen could be due either to an increase in the procollagen chain synthesis rate or a decrease in intracellular degradation of nascent procollagen chains. The contribution of the latter pathway is likely small, given that significant co-translational degradation of proα collagen chains has not been identified, and the proportion of the entire intracellular procollagen pool that is degraded within the cell is reported to be only 10- 20% (43Rennard S.I. Stier L.E. Crystal R.G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1982; 79: 77s-82sAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 44Bienkowski R.S. Coll. Relat. Res. 1984; 4: 399-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 45Berg R.A. Schwartz M.L. Crystal R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4746-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Furthermore, addition of lysosomal and proteosome inhibitors had little effect on the procollagen transport kinetics in SMCs. In addition, the 2.6-fold increase in the pool of newly produced procollagen was associated with a 2.5-fold increase in proα1(I) collagen transcript abundance. Taken together therefore, the expanded pool of newly synthesized procollagen in Hsp47-overexpressing SMCs reflected an increase in the expression and production rate of procollagen chains.Increased Hsp47 also influenced the kinetics of procollagen secretion, with an increased intracellular clearance rate and an increased rate of secretion out of the cell. Because these changes were in the context of increased procollagen synthesis, it is difficult to determine if they were a direct result of the procollagen-Hsp47 interaction in the ER or a more integrated response of several ER proteins ensuring that procollagen was efficiently transported out of the cell, in the face of increased procollagen synthesis. Importantly however, the effect of augmented expression of Hsp47 on transport kinetics did not depend on ascorbate concentration. Under conditions of ascorbate depletion and supplementation, procollagen secretion increased by a similar extent, and the enhanced secretion induced by ascorbate was additive to that induced by Hsp47 alone. In addition, unlike ascorbate, Hsp47 overexpression did not abrogate the production of procollagen forms that are presumably imperfectly structured, suggested by the banding pattern on Western blot analysis. Similarly, the morphology of the assembled collagen fibrils in cultures of Hsp47-overexpressing cells suggested that the collagen structure was not optimized, in contrast to that in ascorbate-supplemented cultures. Although Hsp47 has been found to bind poorly hydroxylated procollagen (13Satoh M. Hirayoshi K. Yokota S.-I. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 46Koide T. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34523-34526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the current observations suggest that Hsp47 does not have a corrective role in the context of suboptimal procollagen hydroxylation.Because SMCs overexpressing Hsp47 elaborated a greater extracellular network of type I collagen fibrils, it is possible that the enhanced procollagen expression and synthesis was a secondary consequence of the modified external milieu. However, extracellular collagen fibrils have been well established to down-regulate, not increase, expression of proα1(I) collagen (47Rocnik E. Saward L. Pickering J.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 48Koyama H. Raines E.W. Bornfeldt K.E. Roberts J.M. Ross R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 30022-30029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and this, therefore, is an unlikely explanation. There is, however, precedent for linking events within the ER to activation of genome. The unfolded protein response, for example, entails the stimulated expression of ER-resident proteins consequent to the release of the chaperone BiP from its ER receptor. This is followed by receptor clustering and autophosphorylation and activation of JNKs (50Urano F. Wang X. Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Chung P. Harding H.P. Ron D. Science. 2000; 287: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar). Recently, overexpression of calreticulin in myoblasts was associated with up-regulation of protein phosphatase 2A, further highlighting the potential for ER events to be transduced outside that compartment (51Kageyama K. Ihara Y. Goto S. Urata Y. Toda G. Yano K. Kondo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19255-19264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).The augmentation of collagen production by increased Hsp47 levels has interesting implications. It is well established that an absence or reduction of Hsp47 leads to reduced collagen production (12Sauk J.J. Smith T. Norris K. Ferreira L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3941-3946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Nagai N. Hosokawa M. Itohara S. Adachi E. Matsushita T. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1499-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Taken together with the current findings therefore, any perturbation that selectively alters the amount of Hsp47 in the ER seems to reset the amount of collagen that is produced. It is noteworthy therefore that within the human population there are common nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter region of the CBP2 gene encoding Hsp47. TheCBP2 [−656]C>T SNP is a mutation that was private to African Americans and resulted in a substantial reduction inCBP2 promoter activity. The functional consequences of depressed CBP2 promoter function in this population warrant further study, but the finding suggests a genomic basis for interindividual differences in collagen production within the population and may, in part, underlie individual susceptibility to conditions characterized by aberrant healing. Phenotypes to be studied for possible association with their functional differences in theCBP2 promoter would include cutaneous wound healing, keloid formation, and vascular phenotypes.The current findings may also have therapeutic implications. There may be circumstances in which augmented or accelerated production of collagen would be beneficial. An important example of this is the production of a structurally sound fibrous cap of on the surface of atherosclerotic plaques. Caps with insufficient fibrillar collagen are prone to rupture which can lead to thrombus formation and heart attacks (30Davies M.J. Thomas A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1984; 310: 1137-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, few defined stimuli are known to drive collagen synthesis, and these are typically multifunctional proteins, such as TGF-β, which influence multiple cell types diversely. The increase in collagen production by Hsp47 observed in these studies thus raises a potential strategy for accelerating collagen production by vascular cells, possibly in a specific manner. The production of type I procollagen is a multistep process that requires the participation of several enzymes and chaperones to ensure the faithful secretion of this trimeric protein. Within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),1 two proα1(I) collagen chains and one proα2(I) collagen chain first associate at their globular carboxyl termini (1Engel J. Prockop D.J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 137-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). This interaction is facilitated by protein-disulfide isomerase and stabilized by interchain disulfide bonds (2Doege K.J. Fessler J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8924-8935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Wilson R. Lees J.F. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9637-9643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Winding of the long triple helical domain then proceeds in the carboxyl to amino direction. The fidelity of this helix-folding reaction is dependent on hydroxylation of proline residues by prolyl-4-hydroxlase (4Kivirikko K.I. Myllyla R. Pihlajaniemi T. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 1609-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). If the activity of prolyl-4-hydroxlase is impaired, as in ascorbate deficiency, the improperly folded procollagen chains are retained within the ER and secreted at a slower rate or targeted for degradation (5Berg R.A.

For this, we have used human vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), which are critical to the elaboration of collagen in the vessel wall (29Rocnik E.F. Chan B.M.C. Pickering J.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1889-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 30Davies M.J. Thomas A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1984; 310: 1137-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). This allowed us to evaluate the response to elevated levels of Hsp47 in the context of a fully functional pathway for procollagen biosynthesis. The results indicate that Hsp47 has the capacity to drive collagen production by a mechanism that involves up-regulation of proα1(I) collagen gene expression and stimulation of procollagen chain synthesis, in concert with enhanced procollagen secretion. We also provide evidence for interindividual genomic variants associated with Hsp47, which, together with the identified effects on procollagen production, implicate Hsp47 as a determinant of collagen elaboration in the population. DISCUSSIONHsp47 has a number of attributes that distinguish it from other ER-resident chaperones. These include its specificity for procollagens as well as an atypical binding profile whereby it interacts with both folded and unfolded conformations of its target protein (11Ferreira L.R. Norris K. Smith T. Hebert C. Sauk J.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 56: 518-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 13Satoh M. Hirayoshi K. Yokota S.-I. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. J.

The results of the current study indicate that Hsp47 can act as a primary stimulator of type I collagen production. Selectively increasing the amount of Hsp47 within SMCs reconfigured the collagen production phenotype such that both intracellular and extracellular steady-state levels of type I procollagen were increased. This profile was associated with up-regulated proα1(I)collagen gene expression, an increased rate of type I procollagen chain synthesis, and faster procollagen secretion. The net effect was the elaboration of an extensive network of type I collagen fibrils. These findings point to a novel pathway for controlling type I collagen production and suggest a linkage between an ER-resident protein and the machinery for procollagen expression.The pool of intracellular procollagen that formed in SMCs within 1 h of adding labeled methionine was substantially increased in Hsp47-overexpressing SMCs compared with control SMCs. Expansion of this particular pool of procollagen could be due either to an increase in the procollagen chain synthesis rate or a decrease in intracellular degradation of nascent procollagen chains. The contribution of the latter pathway is likely small, given that significant co-translational degradation of proα collagen chains has not been identified, and the proportion of the entire intracellular procollagen pool that is degraded within the cell is reported to be only 10- 20% (43Rennard S.I. Stier L.E. Crystal R.G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1982; 79: 77s-82sAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 44Bienkowski R.S. Coll. Relat. Res. 1984; 4: 399-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 45Berg R.A. Schwartz M.L. Crystal R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4746-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Furthermore, addition of lysosomal and proteosome inhibitors had little effect on the procollagen transport kinetics in SMCs. In addition, the 2.6-fold increase in the pool of newly produced procollagen was associated with a 2.5-fold increase in proα1(I) collagen transcript abundance. Taken together therefore, the expanded pool of newly synthesized procollagen in Hsp47-overexpressing SMCs reflected an increase in the expression and production rate of procollagen chains.Increased Hsp47 also influenced the kinetics of procollagen secretion, with an increased intracellular clearance rate and an increased rate of secretion out of the cell. Because these changes were in the context of increased procollagen synthesis, it is difficult to determine if they were a direct result of the procollagen-Hsp47 interaction in the ER or a more integrated response of several ER proteins ensuring that procollagen was efficiently transported out of the cell, in the face of increased procollagen synthesis. Importantly however, the effect of augmented expression of Hsp47 on transport kinetics did not depend on ascorbate concentration. Under conditions of ascorbate depletion and supplementation, procollagen secretion increased by a similar extent, and the enhanced secretion induced by ascorbate was additive to that induced by Hsp47 alone. In addition, unlike ascorbate, Hsp47 overexpression did not abrogate the production of procollagen forms that are presumably imperfectly structured, suggested by the banding pattern on Western blot analysis. Similarly, the morphology of the assembled collagen fibrils in cultures of Hsp47-overexpressing cells suggested that the collagen structure was not optimized, in contrast to that in ascorbate-supplemented cultures. Although Hsp47 has been found to bind poorly hydroxylated procollagen (13Satoh M. Hirayoshi K. Yokota S.-I. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 46Koide T. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34523-34526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the current observations suggest that Hsp47 does not have a corrective role in the context of suboptimal procollagen hydroxylation.Because SMCs overexpressing Hsp47 elaborated a greater extracellular network of type I collagen fibrils, it is possible that the enhanced procollagen expression and synthesis was a secondary consequence of the modified external milieu. However, extracellular collagen fibrils have been well established to down-regulate, not increase, expression of proα1(I) collagen (47Rocnik E. Saward L. Pickering J.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 48Koyama H. Raines E.W. Bornfeldt K.E. Roberts J.M. Ross R.

There is, however, precedent for linking events within the ER to activation of genome. The unfolded protein response, for example, entails the stimulated expression of ER-resident proteins consequent to the release of the chaperone BiP from its ER receptor. This is followed by receptor clustering and autophosphorylation and activation of JNKs (50Urano F. Wang X. Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Chung P. Harding H.P. Ron D. Science. 2000; 287: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar). Recently, overexpression of calreticulin in myoblasts was associated with up-regulation of protein phosphatase 2A, further highlighting the potential for ER events to be transduced outside that compartment (51Kageyama K. Ihara Y. Goto S. Urata Y. Toda G. Yano K. Kondo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19255-19264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).The augmentation of collagen production by increased Hsp47 levels has interesting implications. It is well established that an absence or reduction of Hsp47 leads to reduced collagen production (12Sauk J.J. Smith T. Norris K. Ferreira L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3941-3946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Nagai N. Hosokawa M. Itohara S. Adachi E. Matsushita T. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1499-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Taken together with the current findings therefore, any perturbation that selectively alters the amount of Hsp47 in the ER seems to reset the amount of collagen that is produced. It is noteworthy therefore that within the human population there are common nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter region of the CBP2 gene encoding Hsp47. TheCBP2 [−656]C>T SNP is a mutation that was private to African Americans and resulted in a substantial reduction inCBP2 promoter activity. The functional consequences of depressed CBP2 promoter function in this population warrant further study, but the finding suggests a genomic basis for interindividual differences in collagen production within the population and may, in part, underlie individual susceptibility to conditions characterized by aberrant healing. Phenotypes to be studied for possible association with their functional differences in theCBP2 promoter would include cutaneous wound healing, keloid formation, and vascular phenotypes.The current findings may also have therapeutic implications. There may be circumstances in which augmented or accelerated production of collagen would be beneficial. An important example of this is the production of a structurally sound fibrous cap of on the surface of atherosclerotic plaques. Caps with insufficient fibrillar collagen are prone to rupture which can lead to thrombus formation and heart attacks (30Davies M.J. Thomas A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1984; 310: 1137-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, few defined stimuli are known to drive collagen synthesis, and these are typically multifunctional proteins, such as TGF-β, which influence multiple cell types diversely. The increase in collagen production by Hsp47 observed in these studies thus raises a potential strategy for accelerating collagen production by vascular cells, possibly in a specific manner. Hsp47 has a number of attributes that distinguish it from other ER-resident chaperones. These include its specificity for procollagens as well as an atypical binding profile whereby it interacts with both folded and unfolded conformations of its target protein (11Ferreira L.R. Norris K.

Previous studies suggested that intact cholesterol rafts are required for integrin adhesiveness in different leukocytes. We found the α4 integrins VLA-4 and α4β7 as well as the LFA-1 integrin to be excluded from rafts of human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Disruption of cholesterol rafts with the chelator methyl-β-cyclodextrin did not affect the ability of these lymphocyte integrins to generate high avidity to their respective endothelial ligands and to promote lymphocyte rolling and arrest on inflamed endothelium under shear flow. In contrast, cholesterol extraction abrogated rapid chemokine triggering of α4-integrin-dependent peripheral blood lymphocytes adhesion, a process tightly regulated by Gi-protein activation of G protein-coupled chemokine receptors (GPCR). Strikingly, stimulation of LFA-1 avidity to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) by the same chemokines, although Gi-dependent, was insensitive to raft disruption. Our results suggest that α4 but not LFA-1 integrin avidity stimulation by chemokines involves rapid chemokine-induced GPCR rearrangement that takes place at cholesterol raft platforms upstream to Gi signaling. Our results provide the first evidence that a particular chemokine/GPCR pair can activate different integrins on the same cell using distinct Gi protein-associated machineries segregated within defined membrane compartments.

Lymphocyte arrest on vascular endothelia is nearly exclusively mediated by the integrins VLA-41(α4β1), its related integrin, α4β7, and by LFA-1, counter-receptors for endothelial VCAM-1, MAdCAM-1, and ICAM-1, respectively. As these integrins occur in largely inactive states on circulating leukocytes, their in situ activation must take place within fractions of seconds at endothelial contact zones (3Campbell J.J.

Apically expressed endothelial chemokines confer these integrins with high avidity and shear-resistant adhesion more efficiently than their soluble counterparts (4Grabovsky V. Feigelson S. Chen C. Bleijs R. Peled A. Cinamon G. Baleux F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Lapidot T. van Kooyk Y. Lobb R. Alon R. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 5Peled A.

This suggests that chemokine-occupied GPCRs may transmit local signals to neighboring integrins at the lymphocyte plasma membrane. Segregation of the GPCR machinery, its proximal effectors, and their target integrins within preformed supramolecular structures may facilitate chemokine triggering of integrin avidity under shear flow (6Cinamon G. Grabovsky V. Winter E. Franitza S. Feigelson S. Shamri R. Dwir O. Alon R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 860-866PubMed Google Scholar). Candidate membrane microdomains for such segregation of GPCR complexes are lipid rafts, cholesterol- and glycosphingolipid-enriched lipid microdomains, which serve as key signaling platforms in many cell types (7Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). Because lymphocyte rafts contain several key potential modulators of integrin adhesion stimulation by chemokines, including GPCR subsets and their associated G-proteins (8Manes S. Mira E.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3957-3965PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that avidity stimulation of integrins by GPCRs should take place within or proximal to raft microdomains. Recently, thymocyte LFA-1 has also been shown to partition to rafts and undergo avidity modulation upon raft ligation (14Krauss K. Altevogt P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36921-36927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Lymphocyte rafts have been also implicated in β1 integrin adhesion modulation by the T-cell receptor machinery (15Woods M.L. Kivens W.J. Adelsman M.A. Qiu Y. August A. Shimizu Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1232-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and by other agonists, as measured in prolonged static contacts (16Leitinger B. Hogg N. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 963-972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, very little is known about the involvement of rafts in rapid stimulation of leukocyte integrin avidity by chemokines at endothelial contacts. We report here that although spontaneous integrin-mediated adhesion of resting PBL to inflamed endothelium under shear flow does not require raft integrity, chemokine triggering of VLA-4 or α4β7 avidity to their respective endothelial ligands requires the integrity of cholesterol rafts. Interestingly, chemokine-triggered avidity of LFA-1 to endothelial ICAM-1 is insensitive to raft disruption by cholesterol depletion. Our results suggest that triggering of α4 integrin avidity by major GPCRs on resting T cells occurs through a cholesterol-dependent mechanism, not utilized by the LFA-1 integrin.

The human T lymphoblastoide Jurkat E6-1 and the human promonocytic U937 cell line, gifts of Dr. Y. Shimizu (Minnesota University, Minneapolis, MN) and Dr. S. Levy (Stanford University, Stanford, CA), respectively, were maintained in RPMI 1640, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics. Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with full-length human VCAM-1, a gift of Dr. R. Lobb (Biogen), were maintained in α-minimal essential medium, supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, 4 mml-glutamine, and 200 nm methotrexate (Sigma). Primary cultures of human umbilical cord endothelial cells (HUVEC) were established as previously described (4Grabovsky V. Feigelson S. Chen C. Bleijs R. Peled A. Cinamon G. Baleux F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Lapidot T. van Kooyk Y. Lobb R. Alon R. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and passages 3–4 were taken for adhesion experiments. HUVEC were stimulated for 24 h with TNF-α (2 ng/ml, 200 units/ml, R&D Systems). Human PBL were washed in PBS and attached to poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides at room temperature. Surface rafts were patched by incubating PBL with anti-CD59 mAb (MEM-43, Serotec Ltd., Oxford, United Kingdom) for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by washing and 20 min incubation at 37 °C with Alexa Fluor-546-conjugated anti-mouse Ab (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Cells were washed and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS (30 min, room temperature). Control cells were fixed immediately after attachment to poly-l-lysine and then incubated with the various Abs. Fluorescence microscopy was performed with a confocal microscope (Nicon eclipse TE300 with the Laser Scanning System 2000-BIO-RAD) with ×100 objective lens, using laser excitation at 488 and 543 nm. Cells were washed once with PBS, resuspended in FACS-wash buffer (PBS and 10% bovine serum), and incubated with primary antibody (10 μg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C. The samples were then washed and incubated with secondary antibody for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed and analyzed immediately on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Erembodegem, Belgium). Detergent-insoluble glycosphinogolipid fractions were derived as described (11Xavier R. Brennan T., Li, Q. McCormack C. Seed B. Immunity. 1998; 8: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. In brief, 1 × 109 T cells were washed and lysed for 10 min in 1 ml of cold 25 mm MES buffer, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5, containing 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with a protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture. Lipid fractions were separated by sucrose density gradient (30 to 5%), formed by 18 h centrifugation (250,000 × g using a Beckman SW41 Ti rotor) at 4 °C. Twelve 0.8-ml fractions were recovered and stored at −70 °C until analysis. LFA-1 and α4 integrins in lipid fractions were probed by Western blotting with polyclonal goat Ab directed against the αL or α4 integrin subunits (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), respectively, and developed with peroxidase-conjugated IgG (Jackson, West Grove, PA). Lck was probed with monoclonal anti-Lck Ab (Santa Cruz). CXCR4 was probed with rabbit polyclonal anti-CXCR4 Ab (Proscience Inc., Poway, CA). Densitometric scanning analysis was performed using NIH Image 1.62 software. GPCR- mediated chemokine activation of ERK1/2 in intact or MβCD-treated PBL was quantified as previously described (20Feigelson S.W. Grabovsky V. Winter E. Chen L.L. Pepinsky R.B. Yednock T.

The preparation of all chemokine-containing adhesive substrates and of the cells analyzed in the laminar flow adhesion assays were performed as previously described (4Grabovsky V. Feigelson S. Chen C. Bleijs R. Peled A. Cinamon G. Baleux F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Lapidot T. van Kooyk Y. Lobb R. Alon R. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 5Peled A.

ICAM-1-Ig or MAdCAM-1-Ig-coated substrates were prepared by precoating substrates with 1 μg/ml protein A in coating medium (21Sigal A. Bleijs D.A. Grabovsky V. van Vliet S.J. Dwir O. Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. Alon R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 442-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), followed by co-immobilization of either inactivated or intact chemokines at 2 μg/ml in the presence of 2 μg/ml carrier human serum albumin. The protein A/chemokine substrates were overlaid overnight at 4 °C with the indicated concentration of the ICAM-1-Ig or MAdCAM-1-Ig (in PBS supplemented with 20 mg/ml albumin). Cell monolayers and adhesion ligand/chemokine-coated substrates were assembled on the lower wall of the flow chamber (260-μm gap) and extensively washed with binding medium (Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and Ca2+ and Mg2+ at 1 mmeach). Chemokine pretreatment was performed by incubating cells for 5 min in binding medium at room temperature in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml soluble chemokine followed by cell perfusion into the chamber. Disruption of lymphocyte rafts was performed by pretreating cells (10 min at room temperature) in cell binding medium with 15 mmMβCD followed by washing and immediate introduction into the flow chamber. MβCD did not affect lymphocyte viability within a 30-min period after completion of cholesterol extraction. This treatment was found to deplete 60–65% of the entire cholesterol content in cultured lymphocyte lines (Jurkat and the Pre B line, 300.19 data not shown). Cell treatment with 30 mm MβCD did not further deplete cellular cholesterol, suggesting that the majority of surface extractable cholesterol was depleted by 15 mm MβCD. Mild disruption of the actin cytoskeleton was induced by pretreating cells for 1 min at room temperature with 20 μm Cyto D followed by immediate introduction into the flow chamber with binding medium containing 2 μm Cyto D. For blocking Giprotein α-subunit signaling, PBL were cultured for 15 h at 37 °C in culture medium in the presence of 100 ng/ml pertusis toxin. All flow experiments were conducted at 37 °C. The entire period of cell perfusion was recorded on a videotape with a long integration LIS-700 CCD video camera (Applitech, Holon, Israel) and a time lapse SVHS- Video recorder (AG-6730, Panasonic, Osaka, Japan). All cellular interactions with the adhesive substrates were determined by manually tracking the motions of individual cells along 0.9-mm paths for 1 min within different fields of view (each one 0.17 mm2 of area). Three categories of cell tethers under flow were determined: tethers were defined as transient if cells attached briefly (<2 s) to the substrate; as rolling, if cells established rolling for at least 3 s; and as arrests if immediately arrested on the substrate as previously described (4Grabovsky V. Feigelson S. Chen C. Bleijs R. Peled A. Cinamon G. Baleux F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Lapidot T. van Kooyk Y. Lobb R. Alon R. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Frequencies of adhesive categories within differently pretreated cells were determined as a percentage of cells flowing immediately over the substrates, as previously described (4Grabovsky V. Feigelson S. Chen C. Bleijs R. Peled A. Cinamon G. Baleux F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Lapidot T. van Kooyk Y. Lobb R. Alon R. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). To assess rapid development of integrin avidity to ligand at stationary contacts, cells were perfused into the flow chamber and allowed to settle onto the substrate for 1 min. Flow was then initiated at 0.5 dyn/cm2 (unless mentioned otherwise) and increased stepwise every 5 s by a programmed set of rates generated by a syringe pump (4Grabovsky V. Feigelson S. Chen C. Bleijs R. Peled A. Cinamon G. Baleux F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Lapidot T. van Kooyk Y. Lobb R. Alon R. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). At the indicated shear stresses, the number of cells that remained bound was expressed relative to the number of cells originally settled on the substrate. To assess rapid rearrangement of lymphocyte-surface GPCRs at subsecond contacts, PBL were perfused over surface-bound anti-GPCR mAb (12G5) coated with inactivated or active chemokine, as previously described (4Grabovsky V. Feigelson S. Chen C. Bleijs R. Peled A. Cinamon G. Baleux F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Lapidot T. van Kooyk Y. Lobb R. Alon R. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 22Grabovsky V. Dwir O. Alon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20640-20650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Frequency and type of PBL tethers (transient or immediate arrests) served as a measure of spontaneous or chemokine-triggered GPCR avidity developed by the PBL interacting with the mAb-coated adhesive contacts under shear flow. To test the involvement of cholesterol rafts in the regulation of selectin- and integrin-mediated adhesion of PBL to inflamed endothelium, freshly isolated PBL were perfused under physiological shear flow over a monolayer of TNF-α-activated HUVECs, a well established inflamed endothelial model. PBL establish persistent rolling on the endothelial cell monolayer, which is mediated primarily by E-selectin and VCAM-1 induced on these endothelial cells (4Grabovsky V. Feigelson S. Chen C. Bleijs R. Peled A. Cinamon G. Baleux F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Lapidot T. van Kooyk Y. Lobb R. Alon R. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Interestingly, brief T cell pretreatment with 15 mm MβCD, which depleted the entire extractable cholesterol from the surface of cultured lymphocyte lines (see “Experimental Procedures”), but retained lymphocyte viability and shape (data not shown), had no effect on PBL capture and rolling on either activated HUVEC or on isolated E-selectin (Fig. 1, A andB). Furthermore, MβCD treatment also did not impair the spontaneous ability of VLA-4 to support capture, rolling, or immediate arrest on VCAM-1-bearing cell surfaces (Fig. 1 C) or on purified VCAM-1 coated at different densities (Fig. 1 D). Similar to VLA-4, α4β7 integrin-mediated tethering and rolling of PBL on MAdCAM-1 were also resistant to MβCD (Fig. 1 E). Consistent with these results, α4integrin expression was not affected by MβCD treatment (Fig.1 F). Thus, intact rafts are not required for the inherent ability of α4 integrins on resting T cells to interact with their respective ligands under shear flow and to spontaneously develop medium or high avidity to these ligands at rapid adhesive contacts. Immobilized chemokines bind lymphocyte GPCRs and trigger robust VLA-4 integrin-mediated adhesion to VCAM-1 at static contacts through activation of pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi-protein machinery (4Grabovsky V. Feigelson S. Chen C. Bleijs R. Peled A. Cinamon G. Baleux F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Lapidot T. van Kooyk Y. Lobb R. Alon R. J. Exp.

Immunity. 2000; 13: 759-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). We next asked how chemokine-stimulated adhesion of VLA-4 is affected by disruption of cholesterol rafts on PBL. The prototypic PBL chemokines, SDF-1α (CXCL12) and secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine (CCL21), co-immobilized with VCAM-1, trigger robust VLA-4-dependent adhesion of PBL at 1-min long static contacts (Fig.2 A). VLA-4-dependent adhesion triggered by both chemokines as well as by Mig (CXCL9) was entirely abrogated by MβCD pretreatment of PBL (Fig. 2 A and data not shown), as well as by pertussis toxin pretreatment of lymphocytes (Ref. 4Grabovsky V. Feigelson S. Chen C. Bleijs R. Peled A. Cinamon G. Baleux F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Lapidot T. van Kooyk Y. Lobb R. Alon R. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, and data not shown). The inhibitory effect of MβCD on chemokine-stimulated VLA-4 avidity was reversed in the presence of exogenous cholesterol (Fig. 2 A), consistent with cholesterol depletion accounting for the inhibitory effect of MβCD. Similarly, MβCD pretreatment of murine B lymphocytes abrogated their ability to develop high avidity VLA-4-mediated adhesion to VCAM-1 in response to the B cell chemokine B cell attracting chemokine-1 (CXCL13, data not shown). Thus, although intact rafts are not required for spontaneous VLA-4 and α4β7 adhesiveness developed at rapid adhesive contacts, they are necessary for chemokine-stimulated VLA-4 adhesiveness. These results could suggest that GPCR signaling triggered by SDF-1α and secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine is severely impaired by MβCD treatment. Strikingly, however, both chemokines could normally trigger robust LFA-1-dependent PBL adhesion to purified ICAM-1, and such adhesion was insensitive to cholesterol extraction, yet sensitive to PTX pretreatment of lymphocytes (Fig.2 B, and data not shown). In support of these results, both the expression level and intrinsic signaling activity of the SDF-1α GPCR (CXCR4) to ERK was fully retained in MβCD-treated PBL (Fig. 2, C and D). Spontaneous LFA-1-mediated PBL adhesiveness to ICAM-1 was also fully retained upon raft disruption (data not shown). Thus, Gi protein-mediated enhancement of LFA-1-dependent adhesion by major chemokines is fully retained upon raft disruption in PBL, although Gistimulation of VLA-4 adhesiveness by identical chemokines in the same cells is totally abrogated. Chemokines also trigger VLA-4 avidity at subsecond contacts promoting lymphocyte capture to VCAM-1 under continuous shear flow (4Grabovsky V. Feigelson S. Chen C. Bleijs R. Peled A. Cinamon G. Baleux F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Lapidot T. van Kooyk Y. Lobb R. Alon R. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The involvement of rafts in these earliest signaling events of chemokines to target integrins on the lymphocyte surface was next investigated. In agreement with its suppressive effect on chemokine-stimulated VLA-4 adhesion at static adhesive contacts (Fig. 2 A), cholesterol extraction from PBL impaired rapid SDF-1α stimulation of VLA-4 avidity to VCAM-1 at subsecond contacts and abrogated chemokine-triggered capture and immediate lymphocyte arrest on VCAM-1-bearing surfaces (cell-free or on the surface of a cell monolayer; Fig. 3, A andB, respectively). Cholesterol extraction also abrogated SDF-1α-stimulated Gi-dependent (PTX-sensitive) transient tethers mediated by VLA-4 on low density VCAM-1 confirming that rafts are obligatory to chemokine-enhanced avidity regardless of the level of avidity stimulated or duration of the adhesive contact (Fig. 3 C). Similar to VLA-4, rapid chemokine-triggered α4β7 avidity to MAdCAM-1 was also abrogated in MβCD-treated lymphocytes (Fig.3 D), although spontaneous lymphocyte capture and rolling on MAdCAM-1 were insensitive to cholesterol extraction (Fig.1 E). However, subsecond chemokine stimulation of LFA-1 avidity to isolated ICAM-1, required to trigger capture and immediate arrest of lymphocytes on ICAM-1 at low shear flow (Fig. 3 E), was entirely insensitive to identical cholesterol extraction and raft disruption. Furthermore, robust SDF-1α-triggered integrin-dependent arrest of PBL captured on TNF-α−activated HUVEC was also insensitive to MβCD-mediated cholesterol depletion (Fig. 3 F), in agreement with the major role of LFA-1 in rapid adhesion strengthening developed by lymphocytes on these HUVEC cells (24Cinamon G. Shinder V. Alon R. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Intact cholesterol-enriched rafts appear therefore obligatory for the ability of chemokine GPCRs to trigger rapid avidity of distinct α4 integrins but not of LFA-1 integrin at subsecond endothelial contacts under shear flow. This vastly different cholesterol dependence of α4 integrin avidity modulation could reflect preferential partition of these integrins together with their stimulatory GPCRs within cholesterol-containing raft domains. Strikingly, however, both α4 integrins and LFA-1 were largely excluded from detergent-resistant low density lipid fractions recovered by sucrose gradient highly enriched with the raft marker p56Lck (Fig.4 A). Thus, raft partitioning of α4 integrin did not determine the cholesterol dependence of their GPCR-mediated avidity stimulation. Nevertheless, α4 integrins and LFA-1 appeared to be compartmentalized in distinct membranal domains of PBL as evident by their inability to co-localize (Fig. 4 B). This dichotomy in MβCD sensitivity of chemokine-stimulated α4 integrin and LFA-1 avidity was not restricted to PBL. U937 monocytes and Jurkat T lymphoblastoids express endogenous CXCR4 (4Grabovsky V. Feigelson S. Chen C. Bleijs R. Peled A. Cinamon G. Baleux F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Lapidot T. van Kooyk Y. Lobb R. Alon R. J. Exp.

Similar to PBL, SDF-1α-triggered VLA-4 avidity to VCAM-1 in both types of leukocytes was highly sensitive to cholesterol extraction (data not shown). SDF-1α-triggered LFA-1 avidity in the same cells was, however, insensitive to raft disruption (Fig.5 A, and data not shown). Notably, a major fraction of LFA-1 in Jurkat cells (40%) was found to partition within Lck-enriched low-density lipid fractions (Fig.5 B). This further suggests that raft enrichment of LFA-1 does not render its chemokine/GPCR-mediated avidity stimulation more susceptible to raft disruption. Thus, the MβCD sensitivity of chemokine-stimulated α4 integrins, which is not shared by LFA-1, was not the result of a preferential partition of α4 integrins within rafts and did not occur even in cases where LFA-1 was present in rafts.Figure 5Partitioning of LFA-1 into rafts does not render its avidity stimulation by chemokine susceptible to cholesterol extraction. A, Jurkat cells were pretreated with MβCD as in previous experiments.

Loss-of-function mutations in RET result in gut aganglionosis while gain of function mutations result in cancer syndromes. From studies on transgenic mice, RET9 is important for early development of the kidney and the enteric nervous system. Little is known about the function of RET isoforms in later life. Here we report the expression of RET isoforms and its signalling complex, GDNF and GFRalpha1, in foetal and adult human kidneys. We found their expression in both the developing and the adult renal collecting system. We further show that only RET51 but not RET9 could promote the survival and tubulogenesis of mIMCD3 (mouse inner medullary collecting duct) cells in collagen gel. Our results agree with the hypothesis that RET51 signalling is related to differentiation events in later kidney organogenesis. In addition, it may also have a function in the adult kidney. We further extend our study by showing increased RET and GDNF expression in collecting duct cysts of polycystic kidney patients. This suggests that GDNF/RET signalling may contribute to proliferation of the collecting duct epithelium in an autocrine/paracrine manner."

Here we show that ubiquitin fusion degradation also targets proteins for proteasomal degradation when Ub is present in the middle of fusion proteins (X-Ub-Y), in a process that entails polyubiquitylation of Ub Lys48. By contrast, fusion proteins bearing COOH-terminal Ub (X-Ub) are metabolically stable. Such fusion proteins, either newly biosynthesized or generated by Ub hydrolases, are reversibly conjugated to heterogeneous target proteins in a manner similar to wild-type Ub. Most importantly, the NH2-terminal fusion partner (X) can maintain its structure and function in the formed X-Ub conjugates as inferred from the fluorescence of green fluorescent protein-Ub conjugates and the incorporation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Gag-Ub into viral particles. These findings strongly suggest that 26S proteasomes exhibit spatial discrimination of Ub-conjugated proteins, sparing domains extended from the NH2 terminus of Ub from unfolding and degradation.

Ubiquitylation is a posttranslational modification in which Ub chains or single Ub moieties are attached to target proteins, creating poly- or monoubiquitylated proteins, respectively (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar, 2Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). Typically, Ub is linked to substrates through an isopeptide bond between its COOH-terminal Gly76 and an ε-amino group of a Lys residue on the target protein. Ub can also be attached to free NH2termini via a standard peptide bond (3Breitschopf K. Bengal E. Ziv T. Admon A. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5964-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Polyubiquitin (polyUb) chains are created by adding Ubs to a single Ub attached to a target protein. PolyUb chains consisting of Lys48-Gly76-linked subunits are the principal signal for proteasome-mediated proteolysis (4Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev.

Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). Chains of four or more Ubs bind to the 19S regulatory subunits of 26S proteasomes with sufficient avidity to enable the 19S subunit to unfold the attached substrate and thread it into the interior of 20S proteasomes, where the substrate is cleaved into oligopeptides (6Pickart C.M.

During this process, polyUb chains are removed from the substrate and depolymerized, and Ub subunits rejoin the free Ub pool. The idealized ubiquitylation signal is bipartite, consisting of a recognition element and a Ub attachment site (8Bachmair A. Varshavsky A.

This degradation pathway, called Ub fusion degradation, entails ubiquitylation of Lys48 of fused NH2-terminal Ub (10Johnson E.S., Ma, P.C. Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. J. Biol.

Can Ub function as a cis-acting degradation signal when located anywhere in a protein? PolyUb chain addition sites are predominantly located near the NH2 terminus of substrates (3Breitschopf K.

Fusion proteins with Ub located at the COOH terminus (X-Ub) have been used to demonstrate proteasome-independent roles for monoubiquitin in membrane protein trafficking and viral budding (18Terrell J.

However, in most studies utilizing fusion proteins with COOH-terminal Ub, Lys48 of Ub is altered to Arg to prevent both ubiquitylation and degradation of the target protein (18Terrell J. Shih S.

Because recombinant Ub proteins that have NH2-terminal epitope extensions, such as His6-Ub, myc-Ub, and glutathioneS-transferase-Ub, can substitute for wild-type Ub in a variety of Ub conjugation reactions (24Hicke L.

Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1939) Google Scholar), there is a largely untested assumption that wild-type Ub situated at the COOH terminus will trigger the ubiquitin fusion degradation pathway, resulting in degradation of X-Ub fusions by proteasome. This issue is complicated by the conjugation of the X-Ub to target proteins via Ub Gly76, which is available for isopeptide bond formation (22Roth A.F. Davis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8143-8153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the present study, we further define the ubiquitin fusion degradation pathway by examining the fate of fusion proteins containing internally and COOH-terminally situated Ub. Our findings have important implications for the recognition of substrates by the ubiquitylation machinery and proteasomes and have a number of potential and realized practical applications. HeLa-Kb cells were established by transfection of Kb cDNA into HeLa cells, and stable cell clones were isolated after selection with G418. The expression of Kb molecules on the cell surface was determined by flow cytometry. Proteasome inhibitor cbz-Leu-Leu-leucinal (zLLL) was purchased from Sigma, Ub aldehyde was purchased from Affiniti (Mamhead, UK), polyclonal antibody against GFP was purchased from Clontech, and anti-polyUb mouse monoclonal antibody FK2 was purchased from Nippon Bio-Test Laboratories. Antibodies to a synthetic peptide corresponding to influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) 428–441 (anti-NP428–441) and 488–498 (anti-NPC-term) were produced in rabbits and affinity-purified against the peptide coupled to Sepharose. The 25-D1.16 antibody was coupled to Cy5 (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding NP fusion proteins have been described previously (30Townsend A. Bastin J. Gould K. Brownlee G. Andrew M. Coupar B. Boyle D. Chan S. Smith G. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 1211-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). GFPS was produced using PCR by incorporating a sequence encoding LEQLESIINFEKLTEWTS corresponding to chicken ovalbumin residues 252–269 preceding the stop codon of GFP. Ub-GFP was first constructed by inserting Ub lacking a stop codon into ApaI and BamHI sites of pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). Uncleavable fusion protein UbV76-GFP was then created by altering Gly76 of Ub to Val with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The construct was changed to UbV76-GFPS by replacing GFP fragment with GFPS. Both GFPS and UbV76-GFPS were cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). To introduce an in-frame Ub fusion into the COOH terminus of GFPS, PCR-amplified Ub or G76V mutant was ligated into pcDNA/GFPS digested with ApaI andNotI, generating GFPS-Ub or GFPS-UbV76 (Fig. 1 A). In the case of NP-Ub-GFPS, a NP cDNA without stop codon was first amplified and cloned into pcDNA3, and then Ub-GFPSfragment was directionally ligated to the 3′ end of NP (Fig.7 A). To introduce the K48R mutation into Ub, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange kit. HIV-1 Gag-Ub and Gag-UbA76 were made by fusion of either wild-type Ub or UbA76 into HIV-1NL4-3 at the COOH terminus of p6 region of Pr55. All mutations and in-frame ligation junctions were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing.Figure 7Dual functionality of Gag-Ub fusion proteins.

B, 293T cells were transfected with HIV-1NL4-3 proviral DNA encoding either wild-type Gag or Gag-Ub fusion proteins, as indicated. A preparation of a sheared salmon sperm DNA (sssDNA) transfection is included as a negative control. Released virions were isolated by centrifugation and analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies specific for HIV-1 Gag (anti-CA and anti-p6) or using antibody specific for heterologous EIAV Gag (p9) as negative control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) HeLa-Kb cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A high efficiency of expression (60–80% of the cells) was usually achieved 24 h after transfection. For proteasome inhibitor treatment, cells were cultured for 12 h with 20 μmzLLL or Me2SO as a control. For analysis of Kb-Ova257–264 complex expressed on cell surface, transfected HeLa-Kb cells were incubated with Cy5-conjugated 25-D1.16 antibody on ice for 30 min. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were analyzed using a FACScaliber (BD Biosciences). Transfected HeLa-Kb cells were lysed on ice in TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) containing 1% Triton X-100 and 2 units/ml DNase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After incubation on ice for 30 min, the lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatant and pellet fractions were heated for 10 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol). Proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked overnight in TBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin, followed by incubation with polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies, immunoblots were developed with the use of enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). To detect GFPS-Ub-conjugated NP molecules, cells were extracted with TBS containing 1% SDS. After a 30-min incubation on ice, 10 volumes of TBS containing 1% Triton X-100 were added to neutralize SDS. GFP antibody-reactive materials were immunoprecipitated and separated on SDS-PAGE and then blotted using anti-NP428–441 antibodies. Transfected cells were grown overnight on number 1 glass coverslips. To visualize immunofluorescence of Triton X-100-insoluble materials, cells were treated with 1% Triton X-100 in TBS for 2 min before a 20-min fixation with 3% paraformaldehyde or vice versa. After quenching of formaldehyde with 20 mmglycine/TBS, cells were blocked with 5% normal donkey serum in TBS for 45 min and incubated overnight at 4 °C with FK2 antibody diluted in blocking buffer. After washing, cells were incubated with Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL), and images were collected with a Bio-Rad MRC1024 laser scanning confocal Zeiss Axioplan microscope, using a ×63 planapochromat oil immersion objective. Digital images were recorded and assembled using Adobe Photoshop software. In vitrotranslation was performed in a coupled transcription and translation reaction (2 h at 30 °C) using rabbit reticulocyte lysates TnT kit (Promega, Madison, WI). The reaction was programmed by addition of purified plasmid DNA and [35S]Met. 200 nm Ub aldehyde was included in the reaction to stabilize the polyUb chain. Translation samples were mixed with gel loading buffer and separated on SDS-PAGE. A fluorogram was made from the dried gel. For studying released virus particles, the supernatants from transfected 293T cells were centrifuged (16,000 g × 2 min) and filtered through a 0.45 μm Spin-X filter tube (Costar, Cambridge, MA). Cell-free virus particles were pelleted in a refrigerated Eppendorf Microfuge (4 °C, 16,000 ×g, 100 min). The pelleted virions were lysed in a buffer containing 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris·Cl (pH 7.4), and 0.1% Triton X-100 by shaking at room temperature for 20 min. Immunoblot analysis was carried out as described previously (31Ott D.E. Coren L.V. Chertova E.N. Gagliardi T.D. Schubert U. Virology. 2000; 278: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To investigate the properties of fusion proteins bearing Ub at different positions, we designed a series of plasmids encoding an antigenic peptide-tagged GFP fusion protein (GFPS) fused with wild-type or modified Ub at the NH2 or COOH termini or Ub fusions sandwiched between NP and GFPS (Fig. 1 A). The Ub located at the NH2 terminus or in the middle position was rendered insensitive to Ub hydrolases by mutating Gly76 to Val. To gain a measure of proteasome-mediated protein degradation in mammalian cells, we tagged GFP with a peptide (SIINFEKL) that forms a complex with a mouse class I molecule (Kb). The Kb-SIINFEKL complex can be quantitated on the cell surface using Cy5-conjugated 25-D1.16 monoclonal antibody (32Porgador A. Yewdell J.W. Deng Y. Bennink J.R. Germain R.N. Immunity. 1997; 6: 715-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). HeLa cells expressing Kb molecules (HeLa-Kb) were transiently transfected for 36 h with the various plasmids, and the amounts of GFP and Kb-SIINFEKL complexes were determined by flow cytometry. We validated the system by examining the behavior of the UbV76-GFPS fusion protein. As expected, cells expressing this protein exhibited weak GFP fluorescence and high Kb-Ova257–264 complex expression (Fig. 1 B), effects that were reversed by treating cells for the last 12 h after transfection with the proteasome inhibitor zLLL or by mutating Lys48 to Arg. These observations were consistent with Western blots of the corresponding whole cell lysates using anti-GFP polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 2 A, lanes 4and 5). Little UbV76-GFPS was detected in the absence of proteasome inhibitors, which rescued a species of the expected molecular weight as well as two minor species. The more abundant species co-migrates with GFPSand is probably formed by Ub hydrolases incompletely inhibited by Gly76 to Val substitution. The less abundant species is detected in all Western blots from proteasome inhibitor-treated cells that express GFP in all contexts, ruling out downstream initiation. Rather it almost certainly represents a proteasome-degraded proteolytic fragment produced by a zLLL-resistant protease. We did not detect obvious polyUb species of UbV76-GFPS after proteasome inhibition. We cannot distinguish whether this is due to the rapid deubiquitylation by deubiquitylation enzymes or to the poor reactivity of the antibodies with ubiquitylated species of UbV76-GFPS. To determine whether UbV76-GFPS is ubiquitylated, we turned to in vitro translation, using rabbit reticulocyte lysate with [35S]Met to identify translation products. Radiolabeled translation products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography. As shown in Fig.2 B, noncleavable, NH2-terminal Ub efficiently initiates polyUb chain formation in UbV76-GFPS, resulting in a clear M r 8,000 ladder of higher molecular weight species pathognomonic of ubiquitylation (lane 5) that is not seen when GFPS is translated (lane 4). Substituting Arg for Lys48blocked ubiquitylation, demonstrating that the Lys48 of NH2-terminal Ub is the site of ubiquitylation (Fig.2 B, lane 6). The NP-UbV76-GFPS Ub sandwich chimera is also degraded by proteasomes (Fig. 2 A, lanes 8 and9), resulting in low GFP fluorescence and high generation of Kb-SIINFEKL complexes (Fig. 1 B) that are blocked by zLLL. Targeting of the protein for degradation requires polyUb chain formation initiated from Lys48 of Ub because Lys48→Arg substitution inhibits degradation in cells (Fig. 2 A, lanes 10 and 11) and polyubiquitylation after cell free translation (Fig. 2 B,lanes 11 and 12). This demonstrates that the ubiquitin fusion degradation pathway is not limited to proteins expressing NH2-terminal Ub but encompasses proteins with internally situated Ub, even when located 498 residues from the NH2 terminus. Furthermore, it shows that the presence of substantial protein in the form of NP at the NH2 terminus does not prevent ubiquitylation of Ub Lys48. What is the effect of placing Ub at the COOH terminus of GFP? Wild-type Ub had only a minor destabilizing effect on GFPS as measured by Kb-Ova257–264complex expression or zLLL-induced enhanced fluorescence (Fig.1 B). Modification of Ub residues Gly76 or Lys48 had only minor effects on the fluorescence of the fusion protein or the generation of Kb-SIINFEKL complexes. Consistent with these findings, zLLL exerted similar minor effects on fusion proteins with wild-type versus mutated Ub. These results demonstrate that COOH-terminal Ub does not act as a degradation signal when fused to GFPS. It is interesting that altering Lys48 did not affect the stability of GFPS-Ub. One explanation is inefficient polyUb chain formation initiated at the Lys48 of the COOH-terminal Ub. In vitro translation revealed that this was the case (Fig. 2 B, lane 7) because we failed to detect ladder formation. Although we do detect a species of lower mobility, we believe that this represents di-ubiquitylation occurring in GFPS because (i) it is not affected by modification of Lys48 or Gly76 (Fig. 2 B, lanes 8–10), and (ii) a band with a similar mobility shift appears after translation of GFPS (Fig. 2 B, lane 4). As expected, in vitro translation of His6- or HA epitope-tagged Ub resulted in labeling of the protein itself and a heterogeneous smear that represents addition of the labeled Ub to proteins in the rabbit reticulate lysate mixture (Fig. 2 B,lanes 2 and 3). Inspection of the topof lane 7 of Fig. 2 B also reveals the presence of high molecular weight material. This is not affected by substituting Arg for Lys48 (lane 8) but is blocked by substituting Val for Gly76 (lanes 9 and10). The latter finding indicates that this material represents the posttranslational addition of GFPS-Ub to heterogeneous proteins in the rabbit reticulate lysate mixture. Therefore, this X-Ub fusion protein maintains its conjugation capability if the Gly76 residue is available at the COOH terminus. We have found that most Ub conjugates generated by cells are Triton X-100 (TX-100)-insoluble after incubation of cells with proteasome inhibitors. 2S.-B. Qian, J. R. Bennink, and J. W. Yewdell, manuscript in preparation. We used this observation to examine GFPS-Ub conjugate formation in HeLa-Kb cells using GFP-specific polyclonal antibodies in Western blots of TX-100 fractions (Fig.3 A). In cells expressing GFPS-Ub, we detected a species migrating with the molecular weight expected for the fusion protein (designated Ub fusion). We also detected antibody-reactive species migrating with a much higher molecular weight that represents GFPS-Ub-conjugated substrates. A number of findings indicate that GFPS-Ub is conjugated to proteins in a dynamic manner similar to wild-type Ub. First, the amount of high molecular weight material increases when cells are incubated with zLLL, and, concomitantly, the level of unconjugated GFPS-Ub decreases. This is exactly as reported for free Ub after exposure of cells to proteasome inhibitors (33Schubert U. Ott D.E. Chertova E.N. Welker R. Tessmer U. Princiotta M.F. Bennink J.R. Krausslich H.G. Yewdell J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13057-13062Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Second, the high molecular weight forms of GFPS-Ub were exclusively recovered from TX-100-insoluble fractions; although most free GFPS-Ub fusion proteins remain TX-100-soluble. Third, substituting Val for Gly76 results in the loss of the high molecular weight material (Fig. 3 B), whereas substituting of Lys48 with Arg does not significantly affect recovery of high molecular weight material. This indicates that GFPS-Ub is added to proteins via Gly76. It further suggests, in conjunction with the cell free translation data, that Lys48 in GFPS-Ub may not efficiently promote chain elongation, implying that GFPS-Ub addition may frequently cause chain termination. We next determined the intracellular distribution of GFPS-Ub conjugates by laser scanning confocal microscopy in cells incubated with or without zLLL (Fig.4). GFP (depicted in green) was detected by direct fluorescence, and Ub conjugates (depicted inred) were detected by indirect immunofluorescence staining using the FK2 monoclonal antibody, which binds ubiquitylated proteins but not free Ub (34Fujimuro M. Sawada H. Yokosawa H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). We determined the solubility of Ub conjugates in TX-100 by treating cells with TX-100 before fixation with paraformaldehyde. In cells with normal proteasome function (i.e. not treated with zLLL), FK2 staining was predominantly nuclear, with weaker cytoplasmic staining. The localization of GFPS-Ub was similar, although the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio was increased. Treating cells with zLLL redistributed both FK2 staining and GFPS-Ub to cytoplasmic structures ringing the nucleus. Notably, the localization and intensity of FK2 staining and GFPS-Ub were not greatly affected by TX-100 extraction before fixation. The behavior of GFPS-Ub was not affected by substitution of Lys48 with Arg but was greatly altered by substitution of Gly76 with Val. GFPS-UbV76 did not relocalize to the cytoplasm upon zLLL treatment but remained largely in the nucleus. Under these conditions, FK2 staining was dissociated from GFPS-Ub, demonstrating that the co-incident staining of FK2 with GFPS-Ub Gly76 is not based on binding of the monoclonal antibody to the fusion protein itself. Notably, substituting Gly76 with Val resulted in the loss of >90% of green fluorescence when cells were treated with TX-100 before fixation. These findings confirm the Western blot results, demonstrating that GFPS-Ub conjugates selectively resist TX-100 extraction, in a manner similar to wild-type Ub conjugates, and that this requires that Ub support conjugation via its COOH terminus but not via Lys48. Importantly, this establishes that GFPS-Ub provides a bona fide means for visualizing Ub conjugates in living cells. We next sought to demonstrate the conjugation of GFPS-Ub to a specific proteasome substrate, in this case, Ub genetically fused to NP with Arg replacing NP Met1, a well-defined “N-end rule” substrate. We infected HeLa-Kb cells expressing GFPS-Ub fusion proteins with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing Ub-(Arg)NP (30Townsend A. Bastin J. Gould K. Brownlee G. Andrew M. Coupar B. Boyle D. Chan S. Smith G. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 1211-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Cells treated with or without proteasome inhibitors were extracted with SDS to solubilize Ub conjugates. TX-100 was then added to the extracts to reduce the effective SDS concentration, enabling the collection of proteins reactive with anti-GFP antibodies. After Western blotting with NP-specific antibodies, we could detect high molecular weight species (Fig.5). Based on the following observations, we believe that these represent GFPS-Ub-NP conjugates. First, detection required the addition of proteasome inhibitors (compare lanes 3 and 4). Second, alteration of Gly76 to Val in GFPS-Ub prevented their formation. Third, these species were not detected in cells infected with a control recombinant vaccinia virus that does not express Ub-Arg-NP (data not shown). Note that the high molecular weight smears representing NP-Ub conjugates are better resolved than the equivalent GFPS-Ub conjugates (Fig. 3 A). This reflects the lower percentage of acrylamide used in separating gel in Fig. 5 (10%) as compared with that in Fig. 3 (14%). GFPS-Ub conjugates demonstrate a similar mobility in 10% gels (data not shown). Ellison et al. have shown that myc-Ub conjugation inhibited substrate proteolysis to some extent in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (25Ellison M.J. Hochstrasser M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21150-21157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We did not detect a significant difference for the half-life of (Arg)NP in HeLa-Kb cells expressing either GFPS-Ub or GFPS (data not shown). However, we cannot distinguish whether GFPS-Ub supports (Arg)NP degradation, or whether remodeling of Ub by deubiquitylation enzymes occurs with sufficient rapidity to mask the potential inhibitory effects of GFPS-Ub. If X-Ub fusion proteins are generally functionalin vivo, this could affect the Ub protein reference technique in which internally situated Ubs are used as a means of generating co-translationally cleaved fragments of fusion proteins.

The interaction between FVa and FXa on the surface of phospholipid was investigated with a direct binding assay as well as in a functional prothrombin activation assay. FV mutated at all cleavage sites functioned poorly as FXa cofactor in prothrombin activation, the apparentK d for FXa being ∼10 nm. Fully activated wild type FVa, yielded an apparent K d of around 0.2 nm. The Arg709 and Arg1018 cleavages occurred at low thrombin concentrations and decreased the K d for FXa binding 5- and 3-fold, respectively. The Arg1545 cleavage, being less sensitive to thrombin, decreased the K d for FXa binding ∼20-fold. The K m for prothrombin was the same for all FV variants, demonstrating B-domain dissociation to result in exposure of binding site for FXa but not for prothrombin.

This reaction occurs on the surface of negatively charged phospholipid membranes upon which FXa and FVa form a bimolecular complex, commonly referred to as the prothrombinase complex (1Kane W.H.

Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Prothrombin also has affinity for the phospholipid surface, and the molecular interactions are reduced to two dimensions, which thereby greatly decreases the K m for FXa-mediated activation of prothrombin. Both FVa and FXa have phospholipid-binding sites as well as binding sites for each other, and as a consequence, the FXa-FVa complex is bound with high affinity to the membrane surface. The multiple protein-protein and protein-phospholipid interactions facilitate the assembly of the prothrombinase complex (2Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction between FXa and FVa on the phospholipid surface is associated with increased catalytic efficiency of FXa toward prothrombin by several orders of magnitude (4Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B.

FVa is a heterodimer of the 105-kDa heavy chain (A1-A2) and the 71/74-kDa light chain (A3-C1-C2), the two chains being noncovalently associated (8Esmon C.T. J. Biol.

A theoretical model of the A-domains of FVa has been created (12Villoutreix B.O. Dahlback B. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1317-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The model proposes the A-domains to be in close contact with each other and oriented in a triangular fashion. This arrangement is believed to remain essentially unchanged after activation and B-domain release (12Villoutreix B.O. Dahlback B.

Cleavages at both Arg709 and Arg1018 release a 71-kDa peptide fragment of the B-domain. The remaining part of the B-domain (150 kDa) is released upon cleavage at Arg1545 (9Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J.

Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), whereas the cleavage at Arg1545has been shown to be most important for generation of fully activated FVa (11Keller F.G. Ortel T.L. Quinn-Allen M.A. Kane W.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4118-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 13Thorelli E. Kaufman R.J. Dahlback B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although thrombin is the most important activator of FV, the three cleavages discussed can also be performed by FXa (13Thorelli E. Kaufman R.J. Dahlback B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar,14Monkovic D.D. Tracy P.B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1118-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 16Foster W.B. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13970-13977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, an FXa-sensitive site has been identified at Arg1765 (13Thorelli E. Kaufman R.J. Dahlback B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Recombinant FV variants having the three cleavage sites eliminated separately or in combination by mutagenesis to Gln or Ile have recently been described (13Thorelli E. Kaufman R.J. Dahlback B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 15Thorelli E. Kaufman R.J. Dahlback B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We have now used these FV variants to elucidate how each of the cleavages affects the ability of FV to interact with FXa using both a kinetic approach and a direct binding assay for the phospholipid-bound interaction between FXa and FV/FVa. The results provide insights into the FV and FXa interaction and shed light on the molecular events that are associated with the activation process (i.e. the release of the B-domain and exposure of binding sites for FXa).DISCUSSIONInvestigations of the FV-FXa interaction are of particular importance as the activation of prothrombin plays a central role in blood coagulation. The binding of FXa to Va is crucial for the formation of a fully active prothrombinase complex, and the interaction is the target of careful control, which is a prerequisite for health. Thus, the formation of the prothrombinase complex depends on the activation of FV by thrombin or FXa, whereas down-regulation of the biological activity of the complex is the result of proteolytic modification of FVa exerted by the protein C system (3Rosing J. Tans G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 31Dahlback B. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1999; 133: 415-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although the formation of the prothrombinase complex is crucial in the coagulation, little is known about the structure-function relationships of the complex. More is known about the homologous tenase complex, which, due to the fact that structural pathology of the tenase complex causes hemophilia A, has been the subject of intense investigations (32Mertens K. Celie P.H. Kolkman J.A. Lenting P.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).Using recombinant FV having one or more of the thrombin cleavage sites eliminated by mutagenesis, we have now been able to investigate the importance of each cleavage site for the creation of the FXa-binding site and for the expression of prothrombinase activity. In comparison, FXa bound to the fully activated FVa molecule with an apparentK d of 0.2 nm and to intact FV with an apparent K d of 10 nm. The results demonstrated the importance of all three cleavages (i.e. at Arg709, Arg1018, and Arg1545) in FV for expression of the FXa cofactor activity in the activation of prothrombin. The Arg1545 cleavage had the largest impact on the FVa-FXa interaction and in itself yielded a 20-fold increased affinity of the interaction. This is in agreement with a recent report on cathepsin G and elastase proteolysis of FV, which indicated cleavage at Arg1545 to facilitate FXa binding (27Camire R.M. Kalafatis M. Tracy P.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11896-11906Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) The Arg709 cleavage contributed less to the affinity of the interaction than that at Arg1545. Thus, a 5-fold increased affinity of the FXa binding was observed when the FV variant that could only be cleaved at Arg709 (RIQ) was compared with those that contained no cleavage site (i.e. QIQ and QIQQQ). It was noteworthy that the Arg1018 cleavage in itself resulted in a 3-fold increase in affinity of the FVa-FXa interaction, implying that the Arg1018 cleavage is important in the activation process. The cleavage at Arg1018 has previously been shown to facilitate the Arg1545 cleavage (33Marquette K.A. Pittman D.D. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1995; 86: 3026-3034Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Single chain FV interacts poorly with FXa and therefore has little or no procoagulant activity (Fig.7 A). FV activation intermediates may play important roles as cofactors to FXa during the early phase of the coagulation process (Fig. 7 B). The Arg709 and the Arg1018 cleavages are kinetically favored over the Arg1545 cleavage and require very low thrombin concentrations (10Suzuki K. Dahlback B. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6556-6564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Keller F.G. Ortel T.L. Quinn-Allen M.A. Kane W.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4118-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 13Thorelli E. Kaufman R.J. Dahlback B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14Monkovic D.D. Tracy P.B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1118-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 15Thorelli E. Kaufman R.J. Dahlback B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This suggests that these cleavages occur early in coagulation and that they may be important for the FV-FXa interaction before the clot is formed, when the thrombin concentration is still low (34Kalafatis M. Xue J. Lawler C.M. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6538-6545Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 35Kumar R. Beguin S. Hemker H.C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 72: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The Arg1545 cleavage presumably occurs late in the clotting process after sufficient thrombin has been generated to cleave this site. In addition, the Arg1545 cleavage generates the most potent FVa, giving the thrombin generation an additional boost late in the clotting process (Fig. 7 C). This may be important for the activation of FXIII and subsequent cross-linking of the fibrin network. In addition, it may be involved in increasing the concentration of thrombin within the clot.Figure 7Schematic models demonstrating that the gradual release of the B-domain leads to exposure of the FXa binding site. A, intact FV circulates as procofactor with poor procoagulant properties. The FV QIQ variant, being resistant to thrombin cleavage, appeared to have an apparent K dfor FXa in the 10 nm range when assembled in the prothrombinase complex. B, the cleavages at 709 and 1018 occur at very low thrombin concentrations and result in removal of the N-terminal part of the B-domain. The FV variant RRQ, representing a molecule that can only be cleaved at 709 and 1018, appeared to have an apparent K d of 1.2 nm for FXa, which is 8-fold lower than the apparent K d for QIQ.C, the cleavage at 1545 requires high thrombin concentrations, indicating that it occurs later in the coagulation process when sufficient thrombin has been generated. The cleavage at 1545 releases the B-domain, and fully activated FVa is formed. The interaction of fully activated FVa with FXa had an apparentK d of ∼0.2 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FXa has been reported to cleave FV at all three thrombin cleavage sites (i.e. at Arg709, Arg1018, and Arg1545). The physiological importance of the FXa-mediated activation of FV is not known. An additional FXa cleavage site is present at Arg1765 (13Thorelli E. Kaufman R.J. Dahlback B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have observed that FXa cleaves at yet another position in the A3-domain, at Arg1761. 2M. Steen and B. Dahlbäck, unpublished data. However, the cleavages at Arg1761 and Arg1765do not contribute to the FVa-FXa interaction, because the FV variants QIQ and QIQQQ demonstrate identical affinities for FXa in both the prothrombinase assay and in the direct binding assay.The location of the FXa binding site in FVa has not been characterized in detail. Residues 493–506 (36Heeb M.J. Kojima Y. Hackeng T.M. Griffin J.H. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1883-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and 311–325 (37Kojima Y. Heeb M.J. Gale A.J. Hackeng T.M. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14900-14905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) in the A2-domain of FVa have based on peptide binding studies been suggested to be important for FXa binding. Furthermore, the C-terminal region of the heavy chain of FVa, comprising residues 684–709, has been suggested to be involved in FXa binding (28Bakker H.M. Tans G. Thomassen M.C. Yukelson L.Y. Ebberink R. Hemker H.C. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20662-20667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This region is probably more exposed after the cleavage at Arg709, a conclusion that is in agreement with our present results. The major increase in FXa binding affinity observed after the Arg1545 cleavage is compatible with the involvement of the light chain of FVa in the binding of FXa and the exposure of the binding site after release of the B-domain. The involvement of the light chain in the interaction with FXa has previously been suggested based on an inhibitory effect on the FXa interaction of a monoclonal antibody directed against the A3-domain (34Kalafatis M. Xue J. Lawler C.M. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6538-6545Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In FVIII, which is homologous to FV, a FIXa-binding site has been located to residues 1811–1818 in the A3-domain. The homologous region in FV comprising residues 1677–1683 could potentially be part of the binding site for FXa, a site that in intact FV may be covered by the C-terminal region of the B-domain.Our data show that the release of the B-domain is not associated with improved interaction with prothrombin, suggesting that the B-domain does not conceal any binding site for prothrombin. The knowledge about the structure-function relationships of the interaction between prothrombin and FV/FVa is scarce. In prothrombin, the first kringle domain has been suggested to carry a site important for the interaction with FVa (38Deguchi H. Takeya H. Gabazza E.C. Nishioka J. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), whereas the second kringle domain has been shown to interact with both FVa and FXa during the assembly of the prothrombinase complex (39Esmon C.T. Jackson C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7791-7797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Church W.R. Ouellette L.A. Messier T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8384-8391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In FVa, the C-terminal part of the heavy chain has been suggested to be important for the interaction with prothrombin (28Bakker H.M. Tans G. Thomassen M.C. Yukelson L.Y. Ebberink R. Hemker H.C. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20662-20667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, although this region should be more accessible after cleavage of FV at Arg709, there is no difference in K m for prothrombin activation before or after cleavage at Arg709. The K dvalues obtained from the functional studies, which included prothrombin, were in most cases lower than those obtained in the direct binding experiments. Whether this was due to specific stimulation of the interaction between FXa and FVa by the presence of prothrombin, as has been reported earlier (41Billy D. Willems G.M. Hemker H.C. Lindhout T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26883-26889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), or just due to experimental differences is not known.Little is known about the three-dimensional structure and the function of the B-domain of FV. The A- and C-domains of FV and FVIII share important sequence identities (∼30 and 40%, respectively), but there is no sequence similarity between the two B-domains. The A-domains of the light and heavy chains of FV have been suggested to form a globular structure from which the B-domain projects as an extended rod having extensive contacts with the solvent (42Fowler W.E. Fay P.J. Arvan D.S. Marder V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7648-7652Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The B-domain carries 25 potential glycosylation sites, the many negative charges of which may inhibit the interaction between FV and FXa. It has been shown that removal of the negative charges of sialic acid residues on the oligosaccharides by treatment with neuraminidase results in enhanced FVa activity (43Bruin T. Sturk A. ten Cate J.W. Cath M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 170: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), which could be the result of improved FXa binding to FV. Hence, the function of the B-domain could be to both sterically and electrostatically inhibit binding of FXa to the intact FV molecule. This function of the B-domain would then be crucial in prohibiting premature coagulation.In conclusion, we have shown the binding site for FXa on FV to be exposed as a result of FV activation and B-domain release, whereas the interaction with prothrombin was unaffected by the activation process. Intact FV was demonstrated to weakly interact with FXa, and the conversion to fully active FVa was associated with a 50-fold increased affinity of FXa for FVa. All three activation cleavages of FV (i.e. at Arg709, Arg1018, and Arg1545) were found to increase the affinity of FV for FXa. The Arg709 and Arg1018 cleavages, which occur at very low thrombin concentrations, are presumably important during in the initial phase of coagulation. The Arg1545 cleavage, which is less sensitive to thrombin, has the greatest impact on the FXa affinity and seems to be important at a later stage in the coagulation. The inhibitory effect of the B-domain on the FV-FXa interaction could be exerted by both steric and electrostatic means and may be important to prevent the association of FXa with intact FV, thus avoiding premature thrombin generation. Activated factor V (FVa)1 serves as a cofactor to the serine protease factor Xa (FXa) in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. This reaction occurs on the surface of negatively charged phospholipid membranes upon which FXa and FVa form a bimolecular complex, commonly referred to as the prothrombinase complex (1Kane W.H. Davie E.W. Blood. 1988; 71: 539-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Rosing J. Tans G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Prothrombin also has affinity for the phospholipid surface, and the molecular interactions are reduced to two dimensions, which thereby greatly decreases the K m for FXa-mediated activation of prothrombin. Both FVa and FXa have phospholipid-binding sites as well as binding sites for each other, and as a consequence, the FXa-FVa complex is bound with high affinity to the membrane surface. The multiple protein-protein and protein-phospholipid interactions facilitate the assembly of the prothrombinase complex (2Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction between FXa and FVa on the phospholipid surface is associated with increased catalytic efficiency of FXa toward prothrombin by several orders of magnitude (4Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Rosing J. Tans G. Govers-Riemslag J.W. Zwaal R.F. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 274-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This results in amplification of the coagulation pathway at sites of vascular injury. FV circulates in plasma as a 330-kDa single-chain glycoprotein, which expresses little or no procoagulant activity before activation. Its linear domain structure of A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2 is homologous to that of factor VIII (FVIII) (Fig. 1) (1Kane W.H. Davie E.W. Blood. 1988; 71: 539-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Jenny R.J.

Functional analyses with intact cells and proteoliposomes demonstrated that CaiT is able to catalyze the exchange of l-carnitine for γ-butyrobetaine, the excreted end product of l-carnitine conversion in E. coli, and related betaines. Electrochemical ion gradients did not significantly stimulate l-carnitine uptake. Analysis ofl-carnitine counterflow yielded an apparent externalK m of 105 μm and a turnover number of 5.5 s−1. Contrary to related proteins, CaiT activity was not modulated by osmotic stress. l-Carnitine binding to CaiT increased the protein fluorescence and caused a red shift in the emission maximum, an observation explained by ligand-induced conformational alterations. The fluorescence effect was specific for betaine structures, for which the distance between trimethylammonium and carboxyl groups proved to be crucial for affinity. Taken together, the results suggest that CaiT functions as an exchanger (antiporter) for l-carnitine and γ-butyrobetaine according to the substrate/product antiport principle. l-Carnitine is essential for β-oxidation of fatty acids in mitochondria. Bacterial metabolic pathways are used for the production of this medically important compound.

Physiol. Rev. 1983; 63: 1420-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar, 2Rebouche C.J. Seim H. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 39-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Bacteria use l-carnitine in different ways (3Kleber H.-P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 147: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, Escherichia coli and other enterobacteria accumulate the betaine as a compatible solute under osmotic stress (4Jung H. Jung K. Kleber H.-P. J. Basic Microbiol. 1990; 30: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,5Sleator R.D. Hill C. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 49-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, these bacteria take up l-carnitine under anaerobic growth conditions if no other electron acceptors or glucose is present and convert it into γ-butyrobetaine (4-trimethylaminobutyrate), the excreted end product of the pathway (6Seim H. Ezold R. Kleber H.-P. Strack E. Z. Allg. Mikrobiol. 1980; 20: 591-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Crotonobetaine (4-trimethylaminocrotonate) is formed as an intermediate and probably serves as an electron acceptor under these growth conditions (7Seim H. Löster H. Kleber H.-P. Acta Biol. Med. Ger. 1982; 41: 1009-1018PubMed Google Scholar, 8Jung K. Jung H. Kleber H.-P. J. Basic Microbiol. 1987; 27: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (cf. also Fig. 8). This pathway is particularly interesting, as it can be reverted and used for the enantioselective production of l-carnitine (9Jung H. Jung K. Kleber H.-P. Adv. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol. 1993; 50: 21-44PubMed Google Scholar,10Obon J.M. Maiquez J.R. Canovas M. Kleber H.-P. Iborra J.L. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 51: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As a prerequisite of biotransformation, substrate and product must be transported across the cell membrane. To date, only very little is known about the mechanism underlyingl-carnitine uptake and γ-butyrobetaine excretion. Early studies using a wild-type E. coli strain (O44K74) showed that the cells possess an active, carrier-mediated uptake system specific for l-carnitine (11Jung H. Jung K. Kleber H.-P. J. Basic Microbiol. 1990; 30: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Transport was not assigned to a specific gene product. Therefore, we focus here on the elucidation of the transport mechanism forl-carnitine and related betaines in E. coli. The E. coli genes responsible for carnitine conversion have been cloned and sequenced (12Eichler K. Bourgis F. Buchet A. Kleber H.-P. Mandrand-Berthelot M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 775-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 13Eichler K. Buchet A. Bourgis F. Kleber H.-P. Mandrand-Berthelot M.A. J.

Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2970-2975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The genes are organized in two divergent operons, one of which is the caiTABCDE operon. The products of the caiB and caiA genes, carnitine dehydratase and crotonobetaine reductase, have been characterized in previous studies (15Elssner T. Hennig L. Frauendorf H. Haferburg D. Kleber H.-P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10761-10769Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 16Jung H. Jung K. Kleber H.-P. Biochim. Biophys.

Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1994; 65: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the product of thecaiT gene was proposed to function as a transporter based on sequence comparison and hydropathy profile analysis (13Eichler K. Buchet A. Bourgis F. Kleber H.-P. Mandrand-Berthelot M.A. J. Basic Microbiol. 1995; 35: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). ThecaiT gene encodes a highly hydrophobic protein of 504 amino acids, which probably form 12 membrane-spanning domains (Fig.1). CaiT displays similarity to the glycine betaine uptake system OpuD from Bacillus subtilis, the choline transporter BetT from E. coli, BetP fromCorynebacterium glutamicum, and a BetT-like protein fromHaemophilus influenza (19Peter H. Burkovski A. Krämer R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5229-5234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kappes R.M. Kempf B. Bremer E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5071-5079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They form a small family of transporters, the betaine/carnitine/choline transporter (BCCT)1 family (Transport Protein Database TC 2.A.15). 2Available at tcdb.ucsd.edu/tcdb/tcfamilybrowse.php?tcname=2.A.15. 2Available at tcdb.ucsd.edu/tcdb/tcfamilybrowse.php?tcname=2.A.15. Proteins of this family share the common functional feature of transporting molecules with a quaternary ammonium group (R-N+(CH3)3). Some of these transporters have been shown to utilize electrochemical ion gradients (H+, Na+) for substrate accumulation. In addition, some members of the family are osmotically regulated and share hydrophilic extensions at the N and/or C termini (19Peter H. Burkovski A. Krämer R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5229-5234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kappes R.M. Kempf B. Bremer E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5071-5079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Peter H. Burkovski A. Krämer R. J.

For this purpose, CaiT was purified and reconstituted into proteoliposomes. Functional analyses with intact cells and proteoliposomes demonstrated that CaiT is able to catalyze the exchange of l-carnitine for γ-butyrobetaine and related betaines, whereas electrochemical ion gradients do not significantly stimulate l-carnitine uptake. Analysis of CaiT fluorescence revealed ligand-induced conformational alterations. The fluorescence approach was used to obtain information on the substrate specificity of the transporter. l-[methyl-14C]Carnitine (53 μCi/μmol) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Mouse anti-FLAG antibody M2 was from Integra Biosciences (Fernwald, Germany). Bio-Beads SM-2 were obtained from Bio-Rad (Munich, Germany). Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin was from QIAGEN GmbH (Hilden, Germany). E. coli phospholipid extract was from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). E. coli JM109 (endA1 recA1 gyrA96 thi hsdR17 supE44 λ − relA1 Δ(lac-proAB)/F′ traD36 proAB + lacI q lacZΔM15) (24Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11410) Google Scholar) served as carrier for the plasmids described. E. coliWG389 (F− trp lacZ − rpsL thi Δ(putPA)101 Δ(proP mel)212 zjd351::Tn10 Δ(proU)600 Δ(brnQ phoA proC) (25Culham D.E. Lasby B. Marangoni A.G. Milner J.L. Steer B.A. van Nues R.W. Wood J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) was employed for transport measurements. E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS (F− ompT hasdS B(rB−mB−) gal dcm (DE3) pLysS (camR)) (Novagen) was used for overexpression of the caiT gene from the T7 promoter in plasmid pTcaiT. Plasmid pT7-5 (26Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar) was used for cloning and expression of the caiT gene. ThecaiT gene was amplified from a preparation of genomic DNA from E. coli by PCR with Taq DNA polymerase. PCR primers were designed to introduce BamHI andHindIII restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the gene, respectively. The new sites uniquely flank a 1.5-kb DNA fragment containing the caiT gene with its ATG start and TAA stop codons. The PCR product was partially digested with BamHI and HindIII, and the isolated 1.5-kb DNA fragment was ligated into plasmid pT7-5 digested with the same two restriction enzymes, yielding plasmid pTcaiT. The integrity of the cloned sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. To facilitate attachment of a nucleotide sequence encoding the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) and a His6 tag (ASSHHHHHH), aPstI restriction site was introduced before the stop codon at the 3′-end of caiT. The resulting plasmid, pTcaiT(PstI), was digested with XmaI and PstI, and a 1.8-kb DNA fragment containing the caiT gene was isolated. In parallel, a PstI site was inserted between the 3′-end of theputP gene and the FLAG-His6 tag in plasmid pTputPFH (27Jung H. Tebbe S. Schmid R. Jung K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11083-11088Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). After digestion with XmaI andPstI, a 2.6-kb DNA fragment comprising the nucleotide sequence of plasmid pT7-5 and the FLAG-His6 tag was isolated and ligated with the 1.8-kb fragment from plasmid pTcaiT(PstI), yielding plasmid pTcaiTFH. E. coli WG389 cells harboring plasmid pTcaiT (or its derivatives) were grown aerobically in LB medium (28Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 102Google Scholar) containing 200 mml-proline and 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C, and expression was initiated by addition of 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside in the middle of the exponential growth phase. After further growth for 2 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and immediately used for transport assays. E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells containing the corresponding plasmids were grown as described for strain WG389, except that the LB medium contained 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. In the middle of the exponential growth phase, gene expression was induced by addition of 0.3 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and incubation was continued for 3 h. Cells were harvested and washed as described above. Cells were frozen and kept at −80 °C until used. The amount of CaiT in E. coli WG389 and BL21(DE3) pLysS membranes was estimated by immunoblotting with mouse anti-FLAG IgG raised against the FLAG epitope at the carboxyl terminus of the protein, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG as described (29Quick M. Tebbe S. Jung H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Inverted membrane vesicles ofE. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS containing CaiTFH (CaiT with the FLAG epitope and a His6 tag attached to the C terminus) were prepared by passage of the cell suspension through a Sorvall RF1 Ribi refrigerated cell fractionator, followed by low speed centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove unbroken cells. Membranes were collected by centrifugation at 230,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C, washed with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and 2 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, resuspended in the same buffer, and stored at −80 °C. For solubilization of CaiTFH, inverted membrane vesicles were diluted into 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) to yield a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml. The membrane suspension was supplemented with 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 10% glycerol. Dodecyl β-d-maltoside was added stepwise to yield a final concentration of 1.5% (w/v) while stirring on ice. After additional stirring for 30 min, the sample was centrifuged at 230,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was supplemented with 10 mm imidazole and 300 mmNaCl and incubated with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (1 ml of resin/45 mg of membrane protein) for 45 min with gentle shaking at 4 °C. The resin had been pre-equilibrated with 25 bed volumes of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 300 mmNaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 2 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.04% (w/v) dodecyl β-d-maltoside (buffer A). The protein-resin complex was then packed into a column, and unbound protein was removed by washing with buffer A until the absorbance at 280 nm returned to the base line. Subsequently, the resin was washed with 20 bed volumes of buffer A containing 30 mm imidazole to remove loosely bound protein. CaiTFH was eluted from the column with 200 mm imidazole in buffer A. Purified CaiTFH was reconstituted into preformed liposomes that were prepared from acetone/ether-washed E. coli phospholipids as described (27Jung H. Tebbe S. Schmid R. Jung K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11083-11088Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Prior to reconstitution, the liposomes were destabilized by addition of 0.12% (w/v) Triton X-100. Destabilized liposomes were mixed with purified protein at ratios of 100:1 (for transport measurements) or 20:1 (w/w) (for fluorescence measurements) and incubated at room temperature under gentle agitation for 10 min. Detergent was removed by adding Bio-Beads SM-2 pretreated as described (30Holloway P.W. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 53: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) at wet weight bead/detergent ratios of 5:1 and 10:1 (w/w) for Triton X-100 and dodecyl β-d-maltoside, respectively. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, fresh Bio-Beads were added, and incubation was continued for an additional hour. After the third addition of Bio-Beads, incubation was continued overnight at 4 °C. Bio-Beads were removed by filtration on glass silk, and the turbid proteoliposome suspension was dialyzed two times against 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and 2 mmβ-mercaptoethanol at 4 °C. Proteoliposomes were concentrated by centrifugation at 300,000 × g for 45 min and stored in liquid N2. Freshly grownE. coli WG389 cells transformed with either pTcaiT or pT7-5 were resuspended in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 5 mm MgCl2 (resuspension buffer), thereby adjusting the total protein concentration to 0.35 mg/ml.l-[methyl-14C]Carnitine uptake was measured at substrate concentrations from 2 to 50 μm at 25 °C. For analysis of the Na+ dependence of transport, 50 mm NaCl was added immediately prior to addition ofl-[methyl-14C]carnitine. The medium osmolality was raised by addition of 0.4 m NaCl or 0.6 m sucrose where indicated. For exchange experiments, cells were concentrated in resuspension buffer (7 mg of total cell protein/ml) and equilibrated with the corresponding trimethylammonium compound (10 mm) at 4 °C overnight. The resulting cell suspension was diluted 200-fold into resuspension buffer containingl-[methyl-14C]carnitine (53 Ci/mol) at a concentration of 4.7 μm. In the case of counterflow experiments (cells preloaded with 10 mml-carnitine), this yielded a final externall-carnitine concentration of 54.7 μm. Incubation was carried out at 25 °C, and transport was terminated at different time points by addition of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) and 100 mm LiCl (stop buffer) and rapid filtration as described (29Quick M. Tebbe S. Jung H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes containing CaiTFH (1–2 mg of protein/ml) were subjected to three cycles of freeze/thaw-sonication prior to transport measurements as described (31Viitanen P. Newman M.J. Foster D.L. Wilson T.H. Kaback H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 125: 429-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).l-[methyl-14C]Carnitine uptake was measured with proteoliposomes in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 5 mm MgSO4 (buffer B). Ion-dependent transport was started by 200-fold dilution of aliquots of the proteoliposome suspension (2 μl) into buffer containing 100 mm Tris/Mes (pH 6.0), 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm MgSO4, and 0.2 μmvalinomycin (creation of ΔμH+) or 100 mm Tris/Mes (pH 7.5), 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm MgSO4, 0.2 μm valinomycin, and 50 mm NaCl (creation of ΔμNa+). The buffers containedl-[methyl-14C]carnitine at concentrations varying between 2 and 50 μm. For exchange experiments, the proteoliposome suspension was 10-fold diluted; the desired trimethylammonium compound was added to a final concentration of 10 mm; and the suspension was frozen in liquid nitrogen. After thawing, the samples were extruded through a 400-nm filter to obtain unilamellar proteoliposomes of homogeneous size (32Mayer L.D. Hope M.J. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). The proteoliposomes were concentrated by centrifugation and adjusted to a protein concentration of 1–2 mg/ml. Aliquots (2 μl) of the proteoliposome suspension were diluted into 400 μl of buffer B.l-[methyl-14C]Carnitine (53 Ci/mol) was added at a concentration of 4.7 μm. In thel-carnitine counterflow experiments (preloading with 10 mml-carnitine), this yielded a final externall-carnitine concentration of 54.7 μm. To analyze the effect of N-ethylmaleimide on transport, the proteoliposomes (in buffer without β-mercaptoethanol) were preincubated with the sulfhydryl reagent (2 mm final concentration) at 25 °C for 10 min, and the reaction was stopped by addition of 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Transport assays were carried out at 25 °C (if not indicated otherwise) and terminated at a given time by quenching of the reaction with 2.5 ml ice-cold stop buffer and immediate filtration using Millipore GSTF 02500 filters (0.2-μm pore size). All measurements were performed a minimum of three times. Fluorescence was measured using an SLM-AMINCO 4800 spectrofluorometer at 25 °C. The excitation wavelength was set to 290 nm, and emission was recorded between 310 and 370 nm with slit widths of 4 nm. Measurements were carried out on samples containing 80 μg of reconstituted CaiTFH/ml of buffer B. The lipid/protein ratio of the proteoliposomes was 20:1. The diameter of the proteoliposomes was adjusted to 100 nm by extrusion through a corresponding filter. For measurements with solubilized CaiTFH, 80 μg of protein/ml of buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mmMgSO4, and 0.04% dodecyl β-d-maltoside) were used. Ligands were added at the indicated concentrations, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min at 25 °C prior to measurement. All fluorescence data were corrected for a buffer blank and for dilution effects. The fluorescence intensity measured at 338 nm was used to calculate the apparent affinity constant K 0.5, reflecting the ligand concentration causing a half-maximum change in CaiTFH fluorescence. For this purpose, the data were fitted with the analysis program SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific) using Equation 1, ΔF/F=(ΔF/Fmax)·[L]/(K0.5+[L])Equation 1 where ΔF is the fluorescence variation intensity observed upon addition of ligands, F is the initial fluorescence intensity measured without ligand, ΔF/F max corresponds to the maximum fluorescence change induced by ligand, and [L] is the ligand concentration. All measurements were performed a minimum of three times. Silver staining was performed after protein separation by SDS-PAGE (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) using 10% acrylamide gels (34Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3722) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequencing was carried out as described (35Schmid R. Bernhardt J. Antelmann H. Volker A. Mach H. Volker U. Hecker M. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Protein determination was performed by a modified version (36Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7067) Google Scholar) of the method of Lowry et al. (51Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except for proteoliposome preparations, for which the method of Schaffner and Weissmann (37Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar) was used. The caiT gene ofE. coli was cloned into plasmid pT7-5 as described under “Experimental Procedures,” yielding plasmid pTcaiT. To facilitate immunological detection and purification of the gene product, a nucleotide sequence encoding the FLAG epitope and a His6tag was attached to the 3′-end of caiT, resulting in plasmid pTcaiTFH. Plasmid DNA was transformed into E. coli WG389. This strain lacks the Na+/proline transporter PutP as well as the transport systems ProP and ProU, which catalyze the uptake of proline and betaines in response to osmotic stress. All trials to delete the caiT gene from the genome of E. coliWG389 did not produce viable cells. Transformed cells were grown under aerobic conditions, which prevent expression of the caiTgene from the genome (8Jung K. Jung H. Kleber H.-P. J. Basic Microbiol. 1987; 27: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 38Buchet A. Nasser W. Eichler K. Mandrand-Berthelot M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 562-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Plasmid-derived caiT was expressed via the lac promoter, and Western blot analyses with monoclonal antibodies directed against the FLAG epitope or the His6 tag demonstrated the CaiT location in the membrane fraction of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced cells (data not shown). To investigate CaiT function, uptake ofl-[methyl-14C]carnitine into intact cells of E. coli WG398 transformed with either plasmid pTcaiT or pT7-5 was analyzed by a rapid filtration assay. Cells containing plasmid pT7-5 without caiT showed no or only little uptake ofl-[methyl-14C]carnitine depending on the l-carnitine concentration used (∼0.3 nmol/min/mg of protein at 10 μml-[methyl-14C]carnitine). Expression of plasmid-encoded CaiT did not stimulate this uptake process independent on the presence or absence of an electrochemical H+ or Na+ gradient (data not shown). However, CaiT increasedl-[methyl-14C]carnitine transport into cells preloaded with unlabeled l-carnitine, an activity not observed with cells lacking CaiT (Fig.2). Thisl-carnitine/l-carnitine exchange (counterflow) was inhibited by reaction of CaiT with the sulfhydryl reagentN-ethylmaleimide (∼80% inhibition of the initial rate), whereas the ionophore carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone did not affect counterflow. Besides preloading with l-carnitine, also preloading with γ-butyrobetaine stimulated uptake of externall-[methyl-14C]carnitine into cells containing CaiT (Fig. 2). In contrast, CaiT-containing cells preloaded with glycine betaine, choline, proline, ordl-γ-amino-β-hydroxybutyrate did not accumulatel-[methyl-14C]carnitine (data not shown). Finally, cells transformed with plasmid pTcaiTFH showed the same counterflow activity as cells expressing caiT from plasmid pTcaiT, indicating that the attachment of the FLAG epitope and a His6 tag to the C terminus does not significantly influence CaiT function (data not shown). To test whether CaiT is solely responsible for the observed transport activity, the corresponding gene was overexpressed via the T7 promoter of plasmid pTcaiTFH using strain BL21(DE3) pLysS. In initial studies, different detergents (lauryldimethylamine oxide, Triton X-100, octyl β-d-glucoside, decyl β-d-maltoside, and dodecyl β-d-maltoside; 1.5% (w/v) final detergent concentration) were tested for the ability to solubilize CaiTFH from the membrane fraction of this strain. The most efficient solubilization of CaiTFH (>80% of the transporter was solubilized as judged from Western blot analysis) and the lowest tendency for aggregate formation were achieved with dodecyl β-d-maltoside. Therefore, the latter detergent was used throughout the whole solubilization/purification procedure. Subsequent to solubilization, CaiTFH was purified by Ni2+chelate affinity chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” SDS-PAGE analysis of the resulting peak fractions revealed a broad band with an apparent molecular mass of ∼40 kDa (Fig. 3 A). The protein of this band reacted with monoclonal antibodies directed against the His6 tag or the FLAG epitope (Fig. 3 B). A relatively broad band was also observed for other transport proteins (e.g. LacY) (31Viitanen P. Newman M.J. Foster D.L. Wilson T.H. Kaback H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 125: 429-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and could reflect different stages of protein unfolding in SDS. N-terminal sequencing indicated a single protein species in the band with an amino acid sequence (MKNEKRKTGIEP) that was 100% identical to the sequence deduced from thecaiT gene. The lower than predicted (56.6 kDa) apparent molecular mass of the protein was explained by the highly hydrophobic nature of CaiTFH. A minor band appearing at ∼80 kDa corresponded to the CaiTFH dimer. As judged from silver-stained SDS gels, the obtained protein (monomer plus dimer) was a minimum of 95% pure (Fig. 3). Overall, starting from 90 mg of membrane protein, ∼4 mg of purified CaiTFH were obtained. For reconstitution, CaiTFH was incubated with preformed, detergent-destabilized liposomes made of E. coliphospholipids, followed by stepwise addition of Bio-Beads SM-2 to remove detergent. Using a lipid/protein ratio of 100:1 (w/w), ∼60% of solubilized CaiTFH was reconstituted into proteoliposomes (as judged from protein determinations). The function of isolated and reconstituted CaiTFH was probed by measuringl-[methyl-14C]carnitine uptake into proteoliposomes. A membrane potential (ΔΨ, interior negative) and desired ion gradients were imposed across the proteoliposome membrane by creating an outwardly directed K+ diffusion gradient in the presence of valinomycin and changing the ionic composition and/or pH of the dilution buffer. However, inwardly directed electrochemical H+ and Na+ gradients did not cause significant accumulation ofl-[methyl-14C]carnitine in proteoliposomes (data not shown). In contrast, uptake ofl-[methyl-14C]carnitine was observed upon preloading the proteoliposomes with unlabeledl-carnitine (l-carnitine counterflow) (Fig.4). Labeling of CaiTFH with the sulfhydryl reagent N-ethylmaleimide inhibited this transport process as observed for intact cells. In addition, proteoliposomes preloaded with d-carnitine, crotonobetaine, or γ-butyrobetaine were able to accumulate externall-[methyl-14C]carnitine, with initial rates similar to those observed with proteoliposomes preloaded with l-carnitine. Glycine betaine, choline, and proline inside the proteoliposomes did not have a significant stimulatory effect on transport (Fig."

Abnormalities in alveolar macrophage morphology and emphysema were also apparent before 1 month of age and increased with age (6Wert S.E. Yoshida M. LeVine A.M. Ikegami M. Jones T. Ross G.R.

Increased oxidant production, activation of NFκB, and enhanced metalloproteinase expression by alveolar macrophages were observed, perhaps contributing to the alveolar remodeling seen inSP-D −/− mice (6Wert S.E. Yoshida M. LeVine A.M. Ikegami M. Jones T. Ross G.R. Fisher J.H. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition to abnormalities in lung structure and phospholipid metabolism,SP-D −/− mice were highly susceptible to pulmonary infections by respiratory synctial and influenza A viruses.SP-D −/− mice failed to clear either virus effectively and developed exaggerated inflammatory responses following infection (8LeVine A.M. Whitsett J.A. Hartshorn K.L. Crouch E.C. Korfhagen T.R. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5868-5873Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Since SP-D-dependent abnormalities in lipid metabolism were established immediately following birth and continued postnatally, it has been unclear whether SP-D is required during lung morphogenesis or whether there is an ongoing requirement for SP-D for regulation of pulmonary surfactant metabolism in the adult lung. To further clarify the role of SP-D in pulmonary homeostasis, recombinant SP-D was conditionally expressed in respiratory epithelial cells under control of the Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP) promoter in SP-D −/− gene targeted mice in vivo. Abnormalities in surfactant lipid homeostasis and monocytic infiltrates were reversed by expression of SP-D in adultSP-D −/− mice. Reversal of complementation in adult SP-D −/− mice caused emphysema and alveolar infiltrates but did not perturb phospholipid homeostasis. Mice used in the experimental procedures were handled in accordance with approved protocols through the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. All mice had been maintained in containment facilities. At the time of study, all mice appeared healthy and without evidence of infection. Sentinel mice in the colony were serologically negative for common murine pathogens. The 1.3-kb cDNA encoding recombinant rat SP-D (rSP-D), a generous gift from Dr. E. C. Crouch, Washington University, was inserted into theNotI site of (tetO)7-CMVplasmid (9Tichelaar J.W., Lu, W. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11858-11864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Restriction enzyme digestion and 5′ end sequencing confirmed the orientation of the insert. The transgene was microinjected into fertilized FVB/N oocytes by the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Transgenic Core facility. Founders were identified by two sets of transgene-specific PCR using upstream primer 5′-ATA GGA CCC CAA GGC AAA CCAG-3′ and downstream primer 5′-TGT TCT GTCT-TGT ACC TCT AGG-3′ in rSP-D and upstream primer 5′-CAC CGG GAC CGA TCC AGC-3′ in cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter and downstream primer 5′-CAC CCC CCA GAA TAG AAT GAC AC-3′ in bovine growth hormone polymerase A.

Triple transgenic mice were treated with doxycycline containing food pellets (25 mg/g; Harlan Tekland, Madison, WI) to induce the expression of rSP-D protein (Fig.1). Several (tetO)7-rSP-D transgenic mouse lines were generated. Founder line 10 expressed rSP-D at levels similar to those in wild type mice after treatment with doxycycline and was therefore utilized for this study. Mice were weighed, anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital, and exsanguinated by severing the distal aorta. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed five times with 1 ml of normal saline, and the collected volume was measured (10Korfhagen T.R. Bruno M.D. Ross G.F. Huelsman K.M. Ikegami M. Jobe A.H. Wert S.E. Stripp B.R. Morris R.E. Glasser S.W. Bachurski C.J. Iwamoto H.S. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9594-9599Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (25 μl) from each mouse was dried and reconstituted in 15 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) containing β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were resolved on 10–20% SDS-Tris-glycine-polyacrylamide gels (NOVEX, San Diego, CA) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were blocked with 5% nonfat milk and incubated overnight at room temperature with rabbit anti-mouse SP-D antiserum diluted 1:5,000 in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween. Blots were washed with Tris-buffered saline/Tween and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Calbiochem). After washing, blots were developed with a chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Generally, at least two to four mice from each genotype were analyzed, and representative results are shown. The rabbit anti-SP-D antibody was generated against purified mouse SP-D and affinity absorbed against lung homogenates from SP-D −/− mice (11Hull W. Stahlman M. Gray M.P. Wert S.E. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 161: A42Google Scholar). BALF was performed as described above, and after lavage, lung tissue was homogenized in saline. SatPC in BALF and lung homogenates was measured in mice (8–10 weeks old) from each genotype (12Mason R.J. Nellenbogen J. Clements J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1976; 17: 281-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Differences between genotypes and treatments were evaluated by analysis of variance Fisher analysis. Differences of p < 0.05 were considered significant. Mouse lungs (12 weeks old) were fixed at 25 cm of water pressure with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and processed into paraffin blocks. Five-μm sections from each lobe were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Immunostaining of transgenic rSP-D was performed in lung tissue using an avidin-biotin-peroxidase technique (Vectastain Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Immunostaining was completely blocked by co-incubation with purified mouse SP-D. SP-D mRNA and protein were undetectable inSP-D −/− mice or in triple transgenic (CCSP-rtTA, (tetO)7-rSP-D,SP-D −/−) mice in the absence of doxycycline (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). Administration of doxycycline to adult mice for 2 weeks resulted in production of physiologic levels of the rat SP-D in lungs of triple transgenic mice (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 5 and6). Thus, in triple transgenic (CCSP-rtTA, (tetO)7-rSP-D,SP-D −/−) mice, the only detectable SP-D was derived from the rat SP-D transgene. When maintained on doxycycline from birth, airspace size, alveolar macrophage morphology, and pulmonary SatPC pool sizes were not different from controlSP-D +/+ mice (Figs.3 and Fig. 4 B). In contrast, in the absence of doxycycline, pulmonary abnormalities characteristic ofSP-D −/− mice were readily apparent in the triple transgenic mice (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 A). In the absence of doxycycline, the severity of emphysema, macrophage abnormalities, and lipid accumulations was not distinguishable from that inSP-D −/− mice. Thus, continuous expression of rSP-D from birth completely corrected abnormalities in lung morphology and surfactant phospholipid metabolism inSP-D −/− mice.Figure 3Expression of rSP-D corrects surfactant phospholipid homeostasis in SP-D −/− lung.

Increased SatPC, foamy macrophage infiltrates, and emphysema characteristic of SP-D deficiency were observed. Pulmonary phospholipid content was decreased within 3 days and normalized 7–14 days after treatment with doxycycline (Fig. 5). Again, rSP-D was undetectable in the absence of doxycycline and was rapidly induced, reaching physiologic levels 3 days after administration of doxycycline (Fig. 2 B). Abnormalities in alveolar macrophage morphology were also readily reversed by restoration of SP-D in the adult mice (Fig. 6 C). To further assess the reversibility of airspace remodeling, triple transgenic mice that were maintained without doxycycline until 2 months of age were treated with doxycycline for 1–3 months. Although alveolar macrophage infiltrates and increased phospholipid pool sizes were corrected, airspace abnormalities persisted, demonstrating that emphysema was not reversed by replacement of SP-D in the adultSP-D −/− mice (Fig. 6, C andD).Figure 6Correction of macrophage and neutrophil infiltration but not emphysema by SP-D.

SP-D content in BALF decreased rapidly, being undetectable 3 days after removal from doxycycline as assessed by Western blot analysis (Fig.2 B). As assessed by immunohistochemistry, the intensity and extent of SP-D staining decreased rapidly, although residual SP-D staining was detected in rare subsets of cells 2 weeks after removal from doxycycline (Fig. 4 G). In the presence of doxycycline, SP-D staining was detected in alveolar type II cells in the alveolar parenchyma and in subsets of Clara cells lining the conducting airways (Fig. 4 F). Foamy alveolar macrophages, typical of SP-D deficiency, were observed within 2 weeks after removal from doxycycline (Fig. 4 C). Four weeks after removal from doxycycline, extensive infiltration by enlarged alveolar macrophages and airspace abnormalities consistent with emphysema were observed throughout the lungs (Fig. 4 D). Surprisingly, after removal from doxycycline for up to 4 weeks, SatPC remained at levels typical of wild type mice (Fig. 5). In the present study, rat recombinant SP-D was expressed at physiological levels. Conditional expression of recombinant rat SP-D completely corrected pulmonary abnormalities inSP-D −/− mice when expressed from birth. In adult SP-D −/− mice, extinction of the transgene expression resulted in a rapid decrease in alveolar SP-D, consistent with the known clearance rate of SP-D (14Ikegami M. Whitsett J.A. Jobe A.H. Ross G.F. Fisher J. Korfhagen T. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L468-L476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the pharmacodynamics of doxycycline on which reversal of transgene expression was dependent (15Perl A-K.T. Tichelaar J.W. Whitsett J.A. Transgenic Res. 2002; 11: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In complemented adultSP-D −/− mice treated with doxycycline from birth, removal from doxycycline resulted in decreased tissue SP-D, reappearance of abnormal alveolar macrophage infiltrates, and airspace remodeling that were detected within 7–14 days. In contrast, SatPC was not reversed by loss of SP-D in adult mice. Thus, SP-D-dependent lung remodeling was neither dependent on lipid accumulation nor on processes that affect lung morphogenesis. Although surfactant pool size and alveolar macrophage abnormalities inSP-D −/− mice were readily reversed by restoration of SP-D, emphysema persisted, demonstrating that irreversible changes in lung parenchyma had occurred in the absence of SP-D. Lack of SP-D results in rapid onset of alveolar macrophage activation and initiation of tissue remodeling in adult animals. Thus, SP-D is required for maintenance of pulmonary homeostasis in the mature and developing mouse lung. The finding that replacement of SP-D corrected phospholipid and alveolar macrophage abnormalities but did not correct emphysema is of considerable clinical interest. Emphysema can be caused by both developmental and inflammatory processes, leading to the loss of lung parenchyma reflected by airspace enlargement. D. Massaro and G. D. Massaro (16Massaro D. Massaro G.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: L345-L358Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) recently summarized findings in rodent models wherein emphysema was partially reversible. In the present study, replacement of SP-D for 1–3 months did not correct established emphysema in theSP-D −/− mice. Such findings are consistent with clinical observations demonstrating that various forms of pulmonary hypoplasia and emphysema do not resolve. Therefore, despite the rapid correction of lipid surfactant and macrophage abnormalities by expression of SP-D, emphysema persisted. This conditional system will be of use in identifying agents that may enhance alveolarization. It has been unclear whether alveolar macrophage infiltration and emphysema in SP-D −/− mice are secondary to lipid accumulation or are mediated by distinct pathological mechanisms. In the present study, macrophage infiltrates and remodeling were observed after removal of the corrected mice from doxycycline. In sharp contrast, lung SatPC remained at normal wild type levels after prolonged removal from doxycycline and absence of SP-D. Thus, these experiments dissociate abnormalities in surfactant homeostasis from the airway remodeling. A similar dissociation of these two processes was observed in studies in which the SP-D mutant protein (Rr-SP-Dser-15/ser-20) caused a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on SP-D function, producing airspace but not lipid abnormalities in SP-D +/+ mice (17Zhang L. Ikegami M. Crouch E.C. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19214-19219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Likewise, expression of a chimeric protein consisting of the neck and carbohydrate recognition domain of conglutinin linked to the SP-D amino-terminal and collagenous domain corrected surfactant phospholipid homeostasis but did not improve emphysema or macrophage activation in the SP-D −/− mice (18Zhang L. Hartshorn K.L. Crouch E.C. Ikegami M. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22453-22459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Taken together, both structural and temporal requirements for the correction of pulmonary surfactant abnormalities are distinct from those mediating alveolar macrophage activation and tissue remodeling, suggesting that these two processes are mediated by distinct mechanisms in vivo. Furthermore, the finding that surfactant SatPC remained normalized in adult mice despite a prolonged absence of SP-D suggests that SP-D plays a critical role in establishing SatPC concentrations during postnatal development. Since lung SatPC pools are markedly higher in neonatal mice than in adults (6Wert S.E. Yoshida M. LeVine A.M. Ikegami M. Jones T. Ross G.R. Fisher J.H. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5972-5977Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 14Ikegami M. Whitsett J.A. Jobe A.H. Ross G.F. Fisher J. Korfhagen T. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L468-L476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), SP-D appears to be required for the establishment of the low SatPC pool size characteristic of mature mice. Once normal SatPC concentrations were established in the complemented SP-D −/− mice, loss of SP-D in adulthood did not cause the abnormal accumulation of surfactant lipid. Therefore, SP-D is not required for maintenance of steady state SatPC pools in adult mice. The sites and level of expression of rSP-D in the present studies were virtually identical to those of the endogenous mouse and human SP-D protein (3Madsen J. Kliem A. Tornoe I. Skjodt K. Koch C. Holmskov U. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5866-5870Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 19Wong C.J. Akiyama J. Allen L. Hawgood S. Pediatr. Res. 1996; 39: 930-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the transgene being expressed in type II epithelial cells and bronchiolar epithelial cells in the lung. As demonstrated previously by Fisher et al. (20Fisher J.H. Sheftelyevich V., Ho, Y-S. Fligiel S. McCormack F.X. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Ikegami M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L365-L373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), rat recombinant SP-D fully corrected pulmonary abnormalities in theSP-D −/− mice and did not cause observable pulmonary abnormalities in wild type mice. Thus, the effects of SP-D deficiency on lung physiology are not related to the effects of SP-D in other organs but are dependent on local pulmonary requirements for SP-D. In the present study, the rat CCSP promoter was utilized to express the transgene. Although CCSP is normally expressed only in conducting airways in the mouse, this rat CCSPpromoter element expresses transgenes in both bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells, sites consistent with the known expression pattern of SP-D in the mouse (21Stripp B.R. Sawaya P.L. Luse D.S. Wikenheiser K.A. Wert S.E. Huffman J.A. Lattier D.L. Singh G. Katyal S.L. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14703-14712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sites and extent of expression of SP-D observed in the present study are also consistent with previous studies with the CCSP-rtTA mice from this laboratory (15Perl A-K.T. Tichelaar J.W. Whitsett J.A. Transgenic Res. 2002; 11: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The lack of detectable expression in the absence of doxycycline has made theCCSP-rtTA activator line highly useful for conditional expression of genes in vivo (9Tichelaar J.W., Lu, W. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11858-11864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 15Perl A-K.T. Tichelaar J.W. Whitsett J.A. Transgenic Res. 2002; 11: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The time course of SP-D expression following administration or removal from doxycycline is consistent with previous studies in which luciferase activity was used to monitor of gene expression in SP-C-rtTA andCCSP-rtTA transgenic mice. Gene expression was induced within 6–12 h following addition of doxycycline to drinking water or food, and activity was generally decreased within 12–24 h after removal of doxycycline (15Perl A-K.T. Tichelaar J.W. Whitsett J.A. Transgenic Res. 2002; 11: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Thus, the rapid loss of SP-D protein from BALF following removal of doxycycline is consistent with the known pharmacodynamics of doxycycline, the stability of rtTA, and the half-life of SP-D protein in the lung, the latter being approximately 8 h in the mouse (14Ikegami M. Whitsett J.A. Jobe A.H. Ross G.F. Fisher J. Korfhagen T. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L468-L476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The distinct temporal differences for reversibility of macrophage abnormalities, as compared with surfactant phospholipid concentrations, suggest that these aspects of pulmonary homeostasis are influenced by distinct pathways."

We performed a detailed kinetic study of the editing reaction; the data from this study are consistent with a reaction scheme in which formation of an ADAR2·RNA ternary complex is required for efficient RNA editing and in which formation of this complex is rate determining.

We performed a detailed kinetic study of the editing reaction; the data from this study are consistent with a reaction scheme in which formation of an ADAR2·RNA ternary complex is required for efficient RNA editing and in which formation of this complex is rate determining. These observations suggest that RNA adenosine deaminases function as homodimers on their RNA substrates and may partially explain regulation of RNA editing in these systems. adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA dimethyl suberimidate hydrochloride dithiothreitol adenosine deaminase that acts on tRNA Eukaryotic precursor-mRNAs (pre-mRNAs) are subject to a variety of post-transcriptional modifications that regulate gene expression. These modifications, collectively referred to as RNA processing reactions, include 5′- and 3′-end formation, RNA splicing, polyadenylation, and the recently characterized phenomenon of RNA editing (reviewed in Refs. 1Bass B.

RNA editing involves changes in the information content of the primary transcript by the specific insertion, deletion, or chemical modification of nucleotides. This latter class of editing reactions includes the hydrolytic deamination of adenosine (A) to inosine (I) within the context of double-stranded RNA. Deamination events of this type have been demonstrated in both viral and cellular transcripts. For example, the life-cycle of the Hepatitis δ virus is regulated by an editing event in the anti-genome in which a UAG stop codon is converted to a UIG tryptophan codon (4Polson A.G. Bass B.L.

Tissue-specific editing of the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor results in a 10–15-fold reduction in response to serotonin agonists and thus may be involved in the regulation of cellular response to neurotransmitters (5Burns C.M.

Transcripts for subunits of the neural-specific AMPA class of glutamate-gated (GluR) ion channels undergo A to I modification at two positions, the Q/R and R/G (see Fig. 1 A) editing sites, which affect the properties of the resulting channels (7Sommer B.

The disposition of the edited nucleotide during the editing event is unclear; in the native Q/R substrate the target adenosine is contained within a perfect duplex, which is not the case with the R/G substrate (see Fig. 1 A).

ADAR1 exhibited low deaminase activity with a number of specific substrates, including the Q/R site of the GluR-B pre-mRNA, but has been shown to efficiently edit the R/G site of GluR-B as well as the anti-genome of Hepatitis δ virus (4Polson A.G.

Screening of a rat hippocampal cDNA library with probes complementary to the deaminase domain of ADAR1 resulted in the cloning of ADAR2 deaminase (26Melcher T. Maas S. Herb A. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Higuchi M. Nature. 1996; 379: 460-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). ADAR2a, the shorter of two human isoforms, is an ∼80-kDa protein containing two N-terminal double-stranded RNA binding domains as well as a C-terminal deaminase domain (27Gerber A. O'Connell M.A. Keller W. RNA. 1997; 3: 453-463PubMed Google Scholar).ADAR2 has been shown to efficiently edit both the Q/R and R/G sites of the GluR-B transcript, and in contrast to ADAR1 it does not exhibit activity at a position within intron 11 of GluR-B (see Fig.1 A) (23Hurst S.R Hough R.F. Aruscavage P.J. Bass B.L. RNA. 1995; 1: 1051-1060PubMed Google Scholar, 26Melcher T. Maas S. Herb A. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Higuchi M. Nature. 1996; 379: 460-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). These facts, together with the biochemical purification of ADAR2 along with the Q/R deaminase activity (28Yang J.H. Sklar P. Axel R. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4354-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) strongly support the identification of ADAR2 as the cellular factor responsible for editing of the GluR-B transcript. The mechanism of action of ADAR2 on its RNA substrates is unclear. Little is known about the mechanism of RNA binding or substrate activation for the deamination event. To study the molecular basis for RNA recognition and adenosine deamination by members of the ADAR family, we have undertaken a series of studies involving hADAR2a using the R/G site of the human GluR-B pre-mRNA as a model system. We have characterized this minimal system using kinetic, gel shift, and cross-linking analyses. Interestingly, we have found that a ternary complex involving the association of two ADAR2 monomers with the RNA substrate is responsible for editing activity. Furthermore, the monomers can be cross-linked to one another in an RNA-dependent fashion, suggesting intimate association on the substrate. An analysis of RNA binding and R/G site editing using two deletion mutants indicates that association of ADAR2 with the editing site in a 1:1 complex is insufficient to yield efficient A to I editing. These results combined with previous observations suggest that editing of pre-mRNAs by members of the ADAR class of enzymes is contingent on homo- or hetero-dimerization on the RNA substrate and that this requirement is central to the regulation of editing by these enzymes.DISCUSSIONWe have carried out a detailed kinetic study of RNA editing by a member of the ADAR enzyme class using an RNA that closely resembles the R/G editing site in the GluR-B pre-mRNA. Substrate inhibition of editing, as determined by measurement of initial rates, is consistent with a kinetic model (Scheme A) in which the formation of a ternary enzyme-substrate complex (ESE) is required for efficient editing. As substrate concentration increases, free enzyme is sequestered in the ES complex and is unavailable to form the active ESE complex. Under this scheme, E+S⇌KSES→Ek1ESE→fastEPE SCHEMEA V0=k1[E]2[S]TKS+[E]Equation 5 the linear dependence of initial rate on enzyme concentration suggests that ES rapidly reaches equilibrium and that formation of the ESE complex is rate-limiting. When the concentration of enzyme is much higher than substrate, the initial rate (Vo) is given by Equation 5; the linear dependence of initial rate on total enzyme concentration is clear under conditions where [E] is much greater than Ks. Finally, we found a strong correlation between our kinetic analysis and Scheme A; we calculated the rate constant (k1) for formation of ESE under conditions of excess substrate or excess enzyme and obtained very similar values of 0.20 ± 0.04 pm−1s−1 and 0.21 ± 0.01 pm−1s−1, respectively.It is possible that the association of a second ADAR2 protein with the RNA is independent of the first binding event and that the second event represents binding of the target adenosine to the enzyme active site with no participation of the other monomer. Several pieces of evidence argue against these suggestions. First, chemical and enzymatic footprinting of both ADAR2 complexes have shown that the first binding event corresponds to protection of the editing site with an extended footprint observed at higher protein concentrations (31Ohman M. Kallman A.M. Bass B.L. RNA. 2000; 6: 687-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Second, we deleted distal regions of the R/G substrate, preserving the sequence proximal to the editing site, and observed a dramatic reduction in editing efficiency. Thus, initial binding of ADAR2 corresponds to protein-RNA association in the vicinity of the editing site, but the editing reaction itself requires association of a second ADAR2 monomer with the RNA substrate. It is unclear whether the chemistry of deamination is associated with the active site of the first or second monomer.Gel filtration and glycerol gradient sedimentation experiments performed with another member of the ADAR family of enzymes, ADAR1, indicated that ADAR1 exists as a monomer in solution (32Kim U. Garner T.L. Sanford T. Spiecher D. Murray J.M. Nishakura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13480-13489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hough and Bass (33Hough R.F. Bass B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9933-9939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that partially purifiedXenopus ADAR1 formed complexes of ∼215 kDa (consistent with dimer formation) but behaved as monomers when fully purified. The presence of RNA in the partially purified protein preparation would explain these results. Cross-linking experiments with the bifunctional reagent DMS show that there is an intimate association between ADAR2 monomers on the R/G RNA and also that this association is RNA-dependent (Fig. 4).Comparison of the ADAR class of enzymes with related enzymes suggests that dimerization may be conserved as a functional requirement. Relatively little is known regarding the catalysis of A to I deamination within the context of double-stranded RNA, but it has been assumed that the chemical mechanism is related to that of the adenosine and cytidine nucleotide deaminases (34Carter C.W. Biochemie. 1995; 77: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In both classes of enzymes an active site zinc, coordinated by cysteine or histidine residues, serves to activate water for attack on the purine or pyrimidine base. Sequence comparisons show relatively little homology between the ADAR family active sites and those of other deaminases with the exception of the presence, identity, and relative arrangement of the putative zinc coordinating signature residues; mutagenesis of these residues in ADAR1 supports their roles in catalysis. Interestingly, the identity and arrangement of the signature residues in the ADAR family is more reminiscent of the cytidine deaminases than of the adenosine deaminases. In the cytidine deaminases, zinc is coordinated by His, Cys, and Cys whereas coordination in the adenosine deaminases involves three Cys residues. Additionally, both the cytidine deaminases and ADAR enzymes contain the His-Ala-Glu triad; the acid residue likely acts as a proton donor and acceptor during the course of catalysis. The adenosine deaminases function as monomers, but many cytidine deaminases including Escherichia coli cytidine deaminase (35Betts L. Xiang S. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Carter Jr., C.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 635-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), the T4 bacteriophage cytidine deaminase (36Maley G.F. Duceman B.W. Wang A.M. Martinez J. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 47-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the apoB mRNA editing deaminase (37Lau P.P. Zhu H.J. Baldini A. Charnsangavej C. Chan L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8522-8526Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) function as dimeric or polymeric species. The x-ray structure of the E. coli cytidine deaminase dimer shows that the active site is partially formed by contributions from each monomer (35Betts L. Xiang S. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Carter Jr., C.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 635-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar).Recently, a class of tRNA-specific adenosine deaminases has been characterized by Gerber and Keller (38Gerber A.P. Keller W. Science. 1999; 286: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 39Gerber A.P. Keller W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; : 376-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Members of the ADAT (adenosine deaminases that act on tRNA) enzyme family share sequence homology in editing domains with both the cytidine deaminases and members of the ADAR family; it has been suggested that ADAT enzymes evolved into the ADAR class by the acquisition of double-stranded RNA binding domains. The fact that tad2p (ADAT2) and tad3p (ADAT3) form heterodimers supports the observation that ADAR2 functions as a dimeric species.The enzymatic activity of the RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR has been shown to depend on dimer formation, although the mechanism of dimerization is the subject of controversy (40Wu S. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1291-1296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The sequence of PKR includes two N-terminal double-stranded RNA binding domains and a C-terminal catalytic domain and is thus reminiscent of the domain structure of ADAR2. Future experiments with ADAR2 will involve the localization of the dimerization interface within the protein sequence.Dimerization of ADAR2 on RNA may influence the editing activity of the enzyme in several ways. For example, the binding of a second ADAR2 monomer on its substrate may effect a conformational change in one or both monomers that is required for editing. Results from tryptophan quenching experiments are consistent with ADAR2 undergoing a conformational change upon the binding of RNA (41Yi-Brunozzi H.Y. Stephens O.M. Beal P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37827-37833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An additional piece of evidence supporting the need for a conformational change in ADAR2 before editing is the observation that a potent inhibitor of adenosine deaminase, coformycin (K d ∼10−15m), does not inhibit the activity of members of the ADAR family (15Kim U. Wang Y. Sanford T. Zeng Y. Nishikura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11457-11461Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Recently, Nishikura and coworkers (42Chen C.X. Cho D.S. Wang Q. Lai F. Carter K.C. Nishikura K. RNA. 2000; 6: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the mixing of ADAR3 with either ADAR1 or ADAR2 attenuated the editing activity of the latter two enzymes, whereas mixing ADAR1 and ADAR2 lowered the site selectivity of the A to I editing activity; in light of the data reported here, we interpret these observations to indicate that members of the ADAR family can form hetero- as well as homodimers on RNA substrates. The requirement of ADAR dimerization for editing as well as the modulation of activity by heterodimer formation are no doubt intimately involved in the regulation of the activity of these enzymes, including the site-specificity of editing. Eukaryotic precursor-mRNAs (pre-mRNAs) are subject to a variety of post-transcriptional modifications that regulate gene expression. These modifications, collectively referred to as RNA processing reactions, include 5′- and 3′-end formation, RNA splicing, polyadenylation, and the recently characterized phenomenon of RNA editing (reviewed in Refs. 1Bass B.

ADAR2 has been shown to efficiently edit both the Q/R and R/G sites of the GluR-B transcript, and in contrast to ADAR1 it does not exhibit activity at a position within intron 11 of GluR-B (see Fig.1 A) (23Hurst S.R Hough R.F. Aruscavage P.J. Bass B.L. RNA. 1995; 1: 1051-1060PubMed Google Scholar, 26Melcher T. Maas S. Herb A. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Higuchi M. Nature. 1996; 379: 460-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). These facts, together with the biochemical purification of ADAR2 along with the Q/R deaminase activity (28Yang J.H. Sklar P. Axel R. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4354-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) strongly support the identification of ADAR2 as the cellular factor responsible for editing of the GluR-B transcript. The mechanism of action of ADAR2 on its RNA substrates is unclear. Little is known about the mechanism of RNA binding or substrate activation for the deamination event. To study the molecular basis for RNA recognition and adenosine deamination by members of the ADAR family, we have undertaken a series of studies involving hADAR2a using the R/G site of the human GluR-B pre-mRNA as a model system. We have characterized this minimal system using kinetic, gel shift, and cross-linking analyses. Interestingly, we have found that a ternary complex involving the association of two ADAR2 monomers with the RNA substrate is responsible for editing activity. Furthermore, the monomers can be cross-linked to one another in an RNA-dependent fashion, suggesting intimate association on the substrate. An analysis of RNA binding and R/G site editing using two deletion mutants indicates that association of ADAR2 with the editing site in a 1:1 complex is insufficient to yield efficient A to I editing. These results combined with previous observations suggest that editing of pre-mRNAs by members of the ADAR class of enzymes is contingent on homo- or hetero-dimerization on the RNA substrate and that this requirement is central to the regulation of editing by these enzymes. DISCUSSIONWe have carried out a detailed kinetic study of RNA editing by a member of the ADAR enzyme class using an RNA that closely resembles the R/G editing site in the GluR-B pre-mRNA. Substrate inhibition of editing, as determined by measurement of initial rates, is consistent with a kinetic model (Scheme A) in which the formation of a ternary enzyme-substrate complex (ESE) is required for efficient editing. As substrate concentration increases, free enzyme is sequestered in the ES complex and is unavailable to form the active ESE complex. Under this scheme, E+S⇌KSES→Ek1ESE→fastEPE SCHEMEA V0=k1[E]2[S]TKS+[E]Equation 5 the linear dependence of initial rate on enzyme concentration suggests that ES rapidly reaches equilibrium and that formation of the ESE complex is rate-limiting. When the concentration of enzyme is much higher than substrate, the initial rate (Vo) is given by Equation 5; the linear dependence of initial rate on total enzyme concentration is clear under conditions where [E] is much greater than Ks. Finally, we found a strong correlation between our kinetic analysis and Scheme A; we calculated the rate constant (k1) for formation of ESE under conditions of excess substrate or excess enzyme and obtained very similar values of 0.20 ± 0.04 pm−1s−1 and 0.21 ± 0.01 pm−1s−1, respectively.It is possible that the association of a second ADAR2 protein with the RNA is independent of the first binding event and that the second event represents binding of the target adenosine to the enzyme active site with no participation of the other monomer. Several pieces of evidence argue against these suggestions. First, chemical and enzymatic footprinting of both ADAR2 complexes have shown that the first binding event corresponds to protection of the editing site with an extended footprint observed at higher protein concentrations (31Ohman M. Kallman A.M. Bass B.L. RNA. 2000; 6: 687-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Second, we deleted distal regions of the R/G substrate, preserving the sequence proximal to the editing site, and observed a dramatic reduction in editing efficiency. Thus, initial binding of ADAR2 corresponds to protein-RNA association in the vicinity of the editing site, but the editing reaction itself requires association of a second ADAR2 monomer with the RNA substrate. It is unclear whether the chemistry of deamination is associated with the active site of the first or second monomer.Gel filtration and glycerol gradient sedimentation experiments performed with another member of the ADAR family of enzymes, ADAR1, indicated that ADAR1 exists as a monomer in solution (32Kim U. Garner T.L. Sanford T. Spiecher D. Murray J.M. Nishakura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13480-13489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hough and Bass (33Hough R.F. Bass B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9933-9939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that partially purifiedXenopus ADAR1 formed complexes of ∼215 kDa (consistent with dimer formation) but behaved as monomers when fully purified. The presence of RNA in the partially purified protein preparation would explain these results. Cross-linking experiments with the bifunctional reagent DMS show that there is an intimate association between ADAR2 monomers on the R/G RNA and also that this association is RNA-dependent (Fig. 4).Comparison of the ADAR class of enzymes with related enzymes suggests that dimerization may be conserved as a functional requirement. Relatively little is known regarding the catalysis of A to I deamination within the context of double-stranded RNA, but it has been assumed that the chemical mechanism is related to that of the adenosine and cytidine nucleotide deaminases (34Carter C.W. Biochemie. 1995; 77: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In both classes of enzymes an active site zinc, coordinated by cysteine or histidine residues, serves to activate water for attack on the purine or pyrimidine base. Sequence comparisons show relatively little homology between the ADAR family active sites and those of other deaminases with the exception of the presence, identity, and relative arrangement of the putative zinc coordinating signature residues; mutagenesis of these residues in ADAR1 supports their roles in catalysis. Interestingly, the identity and arrangement of the signature residues in the ADAR family is more reminiscent of the cytidine deaminases than of the adenosine deaminases. In the cytidine deaminases, zinc is coordinated by His, Cys, and Cys whereas coordination in the adenosine deaminases involves three Cys residues. Additionally, both the cytidine deaminases and ADAR enzymes contain the His-Ala-Glu triad; the acid residue likely acts as a proton donor and acceptor during the course of catalysis. The adenosine deaminases function as monomers, but many cytidine deaminases including Escherichia coli cytidine deaminase (35Betts L. Xiang S. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Carter Jr., C.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 635-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), the T4 bacteriophage cytidine deaminase (36Maley G.F. Duceman B.W. Wang A.M. Martinez J. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 47-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the apoB mRNA editing deaminase (37Lau P.P. Zhu H.J. Baldini A. Charnsangavej C. Chan L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8522-8526Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) function as dimeric or polymeric species. The x-ray structure of the E. coli cytidine deaminase dimer shows that the active site is partially formed by contributions from each monomer (35Betts L. Xiang S. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Carter Jr., C.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 635-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar).Recently, a class of tRNA-specific adenosine deaminases has been characterized by Gerber and Keller (38Gerber A.P. Keller W. Science. 1999; 286: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 39Gerber A.P. Keller W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; : 376-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Members of the ADAT (adenosine deaminases that act on tRNA) enzyme family share sequence homology in editing domains with both the cytidine deaminases and members of the ADAR family; it has been suggested that ADAT enzymes evolved into the ADAR class by the acquisition of double-stranded RNA binding domains. The fact that tad2p (ADAT2) and tad3p (ADAT3) form heterodimers supports the observation that ADAR2 functions as a dimeric species.The enzymatic activity of the RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR has been shown to depend on dimer formation, although the mechanism of dimerization is the subject of controversy (40Wu S. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1291-1296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The sequence of PKR includes two N-terminal double-stranded RNA binding domains and a C-terminal catalytic domain and is thus reminiscent of the domain structure of ADAR2. Future experiments with ADAR2 will involve the localization of the dimerization interface within the protein sequence.Dimerization of ADAR2 on RNA may influence the editing activity of the enzyme in several ways. For example, the binding of a second ADAR2 monomer on its substrate may effect a conformational change in one or both monomers that is required for editing. Results from tryptophan quenching experiments are consistent with ADAR2 undergoing a conformational change upon the binding of RNA (41Yi-Brunozzi H.Y. Stephens O.M. Beal P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37827-37833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An additional piece of evidence supporting the need for a conformational change in ADAR2 before editing is the observation that a potent inhibitor of adenosine deaminase, coformycin (K d ∼10−15m), does not inhibit the activity of members of the ADAR family (15Kim U. Wang Y. Sanford T. Zeng Y. Nishikura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11457-11461Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Recently, Nishikura and coworkers (42Chen C.X. Cho D.S. Wang Q. Lai F. Carter K.C. Nishikura K. RNA. 2000; 6: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the mixing of ADAR3 with either ADAR1 or ADAR2 attenuated the editing activity of the latter two enzymes, whereas mixing ADAR1 and ADAR2 lowered the site selectivity of the A to I editing activity; in light of the data reported here, we interpret these observations to indicate that members of the ADAR family can form hetero- as well as homodimers on RNA substrates. The requirement of ADAR dimerization for editing as well as the modulation of activity by heterodimer formation are no doubt intimately involved in the regulation of the activity of these enzymes, including the site-specificity of editing. We have carried out a detailed kinetic study of RNA editing by a member of the ADAR enzyme class using an RNA that closely resembles the R/G editing site in the GluR-B pre-mRNA.

Following internalization of the complex, iron is released in the acidic endosomes and the TfR·Tf complex recycles back to the cell surface where apotransferrin is released at neutral pH. The TfR is composed of two homologous peptide chains of 760 amino acids linked by two disulfide bonds (Cys-89 and Cys-98) close to the transmembrane domain. Each polypeptide is divided into a large C-terminal extracellular domain of 672 amino acids, a transmembrane domain of 21 amino acids, and an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of 67 amino acids. The extracellular domain that binds Tf is kept by a juxtamembrane stalk at 2.9 nm from the plasma membrane (1Fuchs H. Lucken U. Tauber R. Engel A. Geßner R. Structure. 1998; 6: 1235-1243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Within the stalk Thr-104 is O-glycosylated (2Hayes G.R. Enns C.A. Lucas J.J.

Although the appearance of the soluble form of the transferrin receptor (sTfR) in human serum has been known for quite a long time (4Kohgo Y. Nishisato T. Kondo H. Tsushima N. Niitsu Y. Urushizaki I.

Sasaki K. Urushizaki I. Jpn. J. Med. 1988; 27: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The sTfR level remains unchanged in anemia arising from chronic disease, so that it is a reliable marker to distinguish iron deficiency anemia from the anemia of chronic inflammation and liver disease (11Ferguson B.J. Skikne B.S. Simpson K.M. Baynes R.D. Cook J.D. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1992; 119: 385-390PubMed Google Scholar). It was shown that a human red blood cell fraction does not have an own TfR-specific proteolytic activity, whereas a white blood cell fraction does have (12Ahn J. Johnstone R.M. Blood. 1993; 81: 2442-2451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The latter was also observed in human primary granulocytes, activated mononuclear blood cells, HL-60 cells, and K562 cells (13Johnstone R.M.

A mixture of protease inhibitors consisting of leupeptin, pepstatin, EDTA, and PMSF was used to block the release of a TfR fragment from HL-60 membranes (15Chitambar C.R. Zivkovic Z. Blood. 1989; 74: 602-608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage of purified TfR by HL-60 plasma membrane fractions could be inhibited by the serine protease inhibitors PMSF and diisopropyl fluorophosphate at concentrations of 1 mm but not with inhibitors of other classes of proteases. Furthermore, four matrix metalloproteinases (MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, and MMP9) did not cleave TfR (17Baynes R.D. Shih Y.J. Hudson B.G. Cook J.D. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1993; 204: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Using sheep exosome-bound TfR as substrate for a protease present on human granulocytes, release of a TfR fragment was inhibited by 1 mm PMSF (13Johnstone R.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 333-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, the actual cleavage site was not determined. The N terminus of sTfR isolated from human serum starts with Leu-101 revealing a cleavage site C-terminal of Arg-100 in the stalk region 11 amino acids distal to the plasma membrane (18Shih Y.J.

Recently we have identified alternative cleavage sites at Val-108 and Lys-95 within the TfR stalk, which are processed by neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G, respectively (19Kaup M. Dassler K. Reineke U. Weise C. Tauber R. Fuchs H. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1011-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A further cleavage site at Gly-91 was reported for two N-terminal truncated TfRs lacking either the entire cytoplasmic domain or the proximal 31 amino acids of the transmembrane domain. Pulse-chase analysis revealed that this cleavage occurs during the biosynthetic pathway (20Rutledge E.A. Gaston I. Root B.J. McGraw T.E. Enns C.A. J. Biol.

In contrast, the wild-type TfR that was cleaved at Arg-100, when transfected in Chinese hamster ovary cells, was shown to be processed during cycling through an endosomal compartment, although cleavage was not dependent on acidification of the endosomes (21Rutledge E.A. Green F.A. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31864-31868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Elimination of the O-linked carbohydrate at Thr-104 may enhance the susceptibility of TfR to cleavage (22Rutledge E.A. Root B.J. Lucas J.J. Enns C.A. Blood. 1994; 83: 580-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, purified sTfR from human serum was sensitive to O-glycanase and could bind to jacalin lectin, indicating that the sTfR contains anO-linked oligosaccharide (3Do S.I. Cummings R.D. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This suggests that the glycan at Thr-104 does not modulate the shedding process of TfR in vivo. Several members of the metalloprotease family known as ADAM (foradisintegrin andmetalloprotease), including tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-convertingenzyme (TACE or ADAM-17), ADAM-9, ADAM-10 (KUZ), and ADAM-19, play an important role in ectodomain shedding (reviewed in Ref. 23Schlöndorff J. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3603-3617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ADAM proteins fall within the metzincin superfamily that is characterized by an extended zinc binding consensus sequence (HEXXHXXGXXH) and a common tight Met-containing turn and includes thematrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Besides these structural similarities, the proteolytic activities of most MMPs and several ADAMs could be inhibited by hydroxamate-based inhibitors and four endogenous tissueinhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). However, the TIMP inhibitor profile of ADAMs is different from that of MMPs (25Amour A. Slocombe P.M. Webster A. Butler M. Knight C.G. Smith B.J. Stephens P.E. Shelley C. Hutton M. Knäuper V.

March C.J. Black R.A. Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar)). Like TACE, ADAM-10 releases TNFα (31Lunn C.A. Fan X. Dalie B. Miller K. Zavodny P.J. Narula S.K. Lundell D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 333-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), participates in the nonamyloidogenic pathway of APP processing to its soluble form (32Lammich S. Kojro E. Postina R. Gilbert S. Pfeiffer R. Jasionowski M. Haass C. Fahrenholz F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1997; 90: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). ADAM-9 is responsible for the shedding of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like growth factor (34Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Ohno S. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7260-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) and ADAM-19 for the release of neuregulin-β1, a member of the EGF family (35Shirakabe K. Wakatsuki S. Kurisaki T. Fujisawa-Sehara A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9352-9358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Besides the ADAMs, other types of proteases are involved in shedding processes. Thus, the matrix metalloproteinase stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) releases active heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (36Suzuki M. Raab G. Moses M.A. Fernandez C.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31730-31737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and matrilysin (MMP-7) generates active soluble Fas ligand (37Powell W.C. Fingleton B. Wilson C.L. Boothby M. Matrisian L.M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1441-1447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) and is required for TNFα release from macrophages (38Haro H. Crawford H.C. Fingleton B. Shinomiya K. Spengler D.M. Matrisian L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In addition, the membrane type 4 matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-17) and the serine protease proteinase-3 may participate in TNFα processing (39English W.R. Puente X.S. Freije J.M. Knauper V. Amour A. Merryweather A. Lopez-Otin C. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14046-14055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 40Robache-Gallea S. Morand V. Bruneau J.M. Schoot B.

All these data show that one type of protein can be processed by different proteases or, vice versa, one protease can process several different proteins. Recently the idea emerged that regulating steps may determine which protease processes the target protein. In general it can be differentiated into (i) regulated shedding mediated by activating protein kinase C (PKC) by phorbol esters like phorbol 12-N-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and (ii) constitutive shedding, which is present at a basal level. The stimulation of PKC by treating cells with PMA leads to a reduction of cell surface expression of L-selectin and p75 TNF receptor only from wild-type cells but not TACE inactive cells (30Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W. Nelson N. Kozlosky C.J. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Cerretti D.P. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Black R.A. Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). The PMA-induced shedding of interleukin-6 receptor is also strongly reduced in TACE-deficient fibroblasts, whereas a basal release could still be detected (41Althoff K. Reddy P. Voltz N. Rose-John S. Mullberg J. Eur J Biochem. 2000; 267: 2624-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In addition disruption of the TACE gene also abolishes regulated α-cleavage of APP in cultured cells, whereas the basal secretion of soluble APP is unaffected in cells derived from TACE knockout mice (42Buxbaum J.D. Liu K.N. Luo Y. Slack J.L. Stocking K.L. Peschon J.J. Johnson R.S. Castner B.J. Cerretti D.P. Black R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27765-27767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Thus, TACE appears to play a central role in regulating shedding processes in most cases, although it was reported that constitutive α-secretase cleavage could also be increased in cells transfected with TACE (43Slack B.E., Ma, L.K. Seah C.C. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In contrast to TACE, ADAM-10 is reported to be involved in the constitutive shedding of APP (32Lammich S. Kojro E. Postina R. Gilbert S. Pfeiffer R. Jasionowski M. Haass C. Fahrenholz F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3922-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar, 44Lopez-Perez E. Zhang Y. Frank S.J. Creemers J. Seidah N. Checler F. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1532-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of ADAM-10 enhanced PKC-stimulated α-secretase cleavage (32Lammich S. Kojro E. Postina R. Gilbert S. Pfeiffer R. Jasionowski M. Haass C. Fahrenholz F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3922-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). In the present study we developed a cell-free assay to detect the release of sTfR from membrane-bound TfR. Membranes of the shedding active cell line HL-60 were isolated, and following incubation at 37 °C a TfR fragment of ∼80 kDa could be purified that lacked the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domain. N-terminal sequencing of the fragment revealed that the TfR is cleaved C-terminal of Arg-100; thus, this fragment is identical to the major sTfR found in human serum. We could show that the TfR-shedding protease is an integral membrane metalloprotease that can be inhibited by specific metalloprotease inhibitors. In addition to inhibiting release of sTfR from HL-60 membrane preparations, the inhibitors also effectively diminish constitutive TfR shedding from HL-60 cells. Mouse mAb OKT9 directed against the extracellular domain of TfR was prepared from a hybridoma cell line as previously described (45Fuchs H. Geßner R. Tauber R. Ghosh R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6196-6207Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and mouse mAb H68.4 directed against the intracellular domain of TfR was purchased from Zymed Laboratories (San Francisco, CA). Polyclonal rabbit antibody pAB063 was generated by immunization with purified human placental TfR (in cooperation with R. Geßner, Charité, Berlin, Germany). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were obtained from Dako A/S (Glostrup, Denmark). MMP inhibitor 1, MMP inhibitor 2, TAPI-2, and recombinant human TIMP-3 were purchased from Calbiochem(Schwalbach, Germany). Furin convertase inhibitor (FCI; decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone), human TIMP-1 (isolated from stimulated neutrophils), and human TIMP-2 (isolated from rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts) were obtained from Alexis Biochemicals (Grünberg, Germany). PefablocSC andn-octylglucoside were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany), and octylpolyoxyethylene (8-POE) was from Bachem Biochemica GmbH (Heidelberg, Germany). Other inhibitors and reagents were purchased from Sigma. Pervanadate was generated immediately before use by mixing equivalent volumes of 2m sodium vanadate (Sigma) and 1 m hydrogen peroxide (Sigma) to obtain 0.5 m pervanadate. Sodium vanadate was used in excess to completely eliminate hydrogen peroxide, because remaining hydrogen peroxide in the pervanadate solution turned out to be toxic to the leukocytic cells. HL-60, Jurkat, and U937 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum in the presence of 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1× Glutamax. The cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. The cell culture (3500 ml) was centrifuged (210 ×g, 4 °C, 15 min), and the supernatant was passed through a ferri-transferrin-Sepharose affinity column and eluted under nondenaturing conditions with 2 m KCl, 1% 8-POE in PBS (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm phosphate, pH 7.5), as described recently (46Fuchs H. Tauber R. Geßner R. BioTechniques. 2001; 31: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). TfR was detected by Western blotting using OKT9 mAb directed against the C-terminal extracellular domain of the TfR. sTfR-containing fractions were dialyzed against 1 mmphosphate, pH 7.4, 15 mm NaCl and concentrated ∼10 times by lyophilization. For amino acid sequencing, proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride sequencing membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) with blotting buffer A (50 mm boric acid/NaOH, pH 9.0, 10% (v/v) methanol) for 1 h at a constant voltage of 50 V according to the method of Xu and Shively (47Xu Q.Y. Shively J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The band of interest was cut out and sequenced by Edman degradation either commercially (Peptide Specialty Laboratories GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) or by using an Applied Biosystems type 473A automated protein sequencer. A 300-ml cell suspension of actively growing HL-60 cells (∼1 × 106 cells/ml) was centrifuged at 130 × g for 15 min and washed once with 30 ml of Dulbecco's PBS (Invitrogen GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany). All following steps were carried out at 4 °C. The pelleted cells were resuspended in 10 ml of Dulbecco's PBS, homogenized by douncing 15 times in a Dounce homogenizer, and differentially centrifuged at 500 × g for 15 min, followed by 2600 ×g for 15 min and finally at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The membrane pellet was washed once in 5 ml of PBS and again centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The microsomal membrane pellet was resuspended in PBS to a final concentration of 6 mg/ml protein. In order to detect membrane-associated TfR cleaving activity, 50 μl of HL-60 membrane fraction was incubated for 18 h at 4 °C or 37 °C. The samples were applied to a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under either reducing or nonreducing conditions, and TfR fragments were detected by immunostaining with OKT9 or H68.4 as described below. HL-60 membrane fractions were incubated in aliquots of 50 μl for 18 h at 4 °C as negative control or 37 °C in the absence or presence of reagents. The samples were centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatants analyzed by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions, and sTfR detected by immunostaining with OKT9 as described below. For quantitation of the chemiluminescence signals, membranes were scanned with a FujiFilm LAS-1000 system and analyzed with the Image Gauge version 3.2 software. pH-dependent release was determined by resuspending the HL-60 membranes in 50 mm BisTris buffer, 150 mmNaCl (pH 6.0–7.5) or 50 mm Tris buffer, 150 mmNaCl (pH 8.0–9.5). Samples were prepared according to Laemmli (48Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207123) Google Scholar) by boiling for 5 min in sample buffer containing 2% SDS with or without 2% 2-mercaptoethanol and separated by electrophoresis. For immunostaining, electrotransfer of proteins to a nitrocellulose membrane, pore size 0.2 μm (Sartorius AG, Göttingen, Germany), was performed with blotting buffer B (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 10% (v/v) ethanol). After blotting the membrane was blocked with Dulbecco's PBS containing 5% dry skim milk. TfR was detected either with OKT9 (6 μg/ml) or H68.4 (0.5 μg/ml) in Dulbecco's PBS containing 0.2% Brij 58 (PBSB) and 1% dry skim milk and a subsequent incubation with peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse antibody (60 μg/ml). Each antibody incubation step was followed by intensive washes with PBSB. Secondary antibody detection was carried out by the enhanced chemiluminescence system from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). Using a 96-well microplate, each well was coated with 100 μl of anti-TfR mAb OKT9 (2 μg/ml in Dulbecco's PBS) for 90 min and subsequently blocked with 175 μl of 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. All incubation steps were carried out under gentle agitation at room temperature. Cell culture supernatant was centrifuged (20,800 × g, 4 °C, 20 min) to remove cellular debris and 100-μl aliquots pipetted in triplicate and incubated for 2.5 h. The plate was washed with PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBST) and bound TfR detected with 100 μl of anti-TfR polyclonal antibody pAB063 (1:2000 in PBST) and 100 μl of peroxidase-labeled swine anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000 in PBST). The purification of placental TfR, which served as internal standards for the quantitation of sTfR, and colorimetric reaction were performed as previously described (46Fuchs H. Tauber R. Geßner R. BioTechniques. 2001; 31: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined in duplicate in microplates using the BCA protein assay (no. 23225, Pierce) and the appropriate microscale protocol of the manufacturer. Because the promyelocytic cell line HL-60 release relatively high amounts of sTfR (19Kaup M. Dassler K. Reineke U. Weise C. Tauber R. Fuchs H. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1011-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we chose this cell line for further investigations. First we isolated sTfR from the culture cell medium by ferri-transferrin-Sepharose affinity chromatography and analyzed the site of cleavage by N-terminal sequencing. The N terminus of the sequenced sTfR was constituted by LAG(T)ES, revealing the physiological cleavage site at Arg-100 as described by Shih et al. (18Shih Y.J. Baynes R.D. Hudson B.G. Flowers C.H. Skikne B.S. Cook J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19077-19081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because Thr-104 is reported to be modified byO-glycosylation (2Hayes G.R. Enns C.A. Lucas J.J. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 3Do S.I. Cummings R.D. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), only a weak signal was detected for this amino acid. HL-60 cells were washed once in PBS and subsequently lysed in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100. The lysate was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and TfR detected by Western blotting using OKT9 mAb directed against the extracellular domain or H68.4 mAb directed against the intracellular domain of the TfR (Fig. 1 A). To determine the TfR shedding activity in membranes of HL-60 cells, membrane preparations were incubated at 4 or 37 °C for 18 h and separated by 12% SDS-PAGE under either nonreducing or reducing conditions. TfR was detected by Western blotting using OKT9 or H68.4 (Fig. 1 B). Altogether six TfR fragments were detected and identified by size and immunological characteristics as follows: ∼190-kDa dimer of TfR (TfR·TfR), ∼110-kDa dimer of TfR lacking one extracellular domain (TfR·mfTfR), ∼90-kDa monomeric TfR (TfR), ∼80-kDa soluble monomeric TfR (sTfR), ∼25-kDa dimer of TfR lacking both extracellular domains (mfTfR·mfTfR), and ∼13-kDa monomeric membrane fragment (mfTfR). The TfR fragments are schematically presented in Fig. 1 E. The sTfR was not detected by H68.4, indicating that it is N-terminally truncated, whereas the fragments that only consist of small membrane fragments were not detectable by OKT9, revealing that they are C-terminally truncated. The ratios of the detected fragments varied from preparation to preparation. Nevertheless, in most of the blots derived from nonreducing SDS-PAGE, the amount of TfR dimer exceeded the amounts of monomeric TfR and TfR·mfTfR. Furthermore, in all cases the levels of fragments containing full-length TfR (TfR·TfR, TfR·mfTfR, and TfR) decreased after incubation at 37 °C, whereas the levels of cleaved fragments (sTfR, mfTfR·mfTfR, and mfTfR) increased. Several wash steps of the membrane with detergent-free buffer did not reduce the sTfR releasing activity, indicating that the TfR-shedding protease is tightly bound to the membrane. Just below the sTfR we detected a faint band that coappears in some cases with the sTfR, but in much lower concentrations (see also Figs. 1 D, 2 A, 5 B, and6 D). It remains unclear under which conditions this alternative sTfR is generated, but in general it appears in a linear relationship to the major sTfR. The molecular weight of the alternative sTfR corresponds to the molecular weight of the product of a TfR-cleaving protease recently identified in our lab as neutrophil elastase (19Kaup M. Dassler K. Reineke U. Weise C. Tauber R. Fuchs H. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1011-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Figure 2sTfR release assay. Generation of sTfR (a typical result is shown in Fig. 1 C) upon incubation at 37 °C was quantified by chemiluminescence imaging on a FujiFilm LAS-1000 system. Data represent mean values for at least two independent experiments with S.E. A, rate of sTfR release at 37 °C over a 24-h period. A representative result is shown (left inset).

Overexpression of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in p53 transgenic mice results in renal malformation, suggesting that altered expression of certain p53 target gene(s) involved in renal development may be responsible. This study shows that the taurine transporter gene (TauT) is a transcriptional target of p53. Expression of TauT was decreased after activation of p53 by doxorubicin, a DNA-damaging drug, in 293 and NRK-52E renal cells.TauT promoter activity was decreased 5–10-fold by cotransfection of a full-length TauT promoter-reporter construct with p53, which was reversed by cotransfection with a mutant p53 (p53-281). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using nuclear extracts from p53-expressing (10)1val cells showed a putative p53-binding site in the TauT promoter region, which bound to the p53 in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Mutation of this p53 consensus sequence abolished binding of p53. These results demonstrate that TauT may represent a downstream target gene of p53 that could link the roles of p53 in renal development and apoptosis.

Eckhaus M. Paglino J.J. Owens J. Varmus H.E. Genes Dev. 1996; 110: 836-850Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that altered expression of certain p53 target gene(s) involved in renal development may be responsible for p53-induced progressive renal failure in p53 transgenic mice. Interestingly, the progressive renal failure found in p53 transgenic mice is similar to observations made regarding the offspring of taurine-deficient cats, which showed ongoing kidney damage in addition to abnormal renal and retinal development (2Imaki H. Moretz R.C. Wisniewski H.M. Sturman J.A. Dev. Neurosci. 1986; 8: 160-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 10Godley L.A. Eckhaus M. Paglino J.J. Owens J. Varmus H.E. Genes Dev. 1996; 110: 836-850Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar), suggesting that the taurine transporter gene may be an important target of p53. Recently, Heller-Stilb et al. (11Heller-Stilb B. Van Roeyen C. Rascher K. Hatrwig H. Huth A. Seeliger M.W. Warskulat U. Häussinger D. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 231-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) created ataut−/− mouse model in which knockout of TauTresulted in severe and progressive retinal degeneration, a small brain, and shrunken kidneys. These findings suggest that the TauTgene is required for normal kidney development in mice. A recent study shows that the Fas (CD95) cell surface receptor is up-regulated by DNA-damaging agents that seem to be p53-dependent (12Sheard M.A. Vojtesek B. Janakova L. Kovarik J. Zaloudik J. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 73: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Stimulation of Fas receptor with Fas antibody leads to release of cellular taurine, which coincides with cell shrinkage and precedes DNA fragmentation. However, Fas receptor-mediated apoptosis is blunted by increases in extracellular osmolarity (13Lang F. Madlung J. Uhlemann A.C. Risler T. Gulbins E. Pfleug. Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 436: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), suggesting that taurine uptake mediated by the taurine transporter plays a role in the cell volume regulatory mechanism during apoptotic cell death. This hypothesis is strongly supported by observations in taut−/− mice, in which the progressive retinal degeneration was found to be caused by apoptosis (11Heller-Stilb B. Van Roeyen C. Rascher K. Hatrwig H. Huth A. Seeliger M.W. Warskulat U. Häussinger D. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 231-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Therefore, regulation of TauT by p53 may also be important in Fas-mediated apoptosis. The promoter region ofTauT was identified in previous studies (14Han X. Budreau A.M. Chesney R.W. Huxtable R. Taurine 4. 483. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York2000: 535-544Google Scholar), and a p53-binding consensus site was found in the TauT promoter sequence, located at −663 to −695. In this study, ∼1.1 kb of theTauT promoter region DNA was used as the template for PCR (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AR151716) and the PCR fragment was cloned into the promoterless luciferase vector pGL3-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI) to generate the plasmid p963 for use in transfections and luciferase assays. The conditions used are 30 cycles of 1 min of denaturation at 94 °C, 1 min of annealing at 58 °C, and 1 min of elongation at 72 °C. The sense primer (5′-GGGGTACCTTACTGAAGGTCACACAGC-3′) designed for PCR contained a unique site for KpnI, and the antisense primer (5′-AAGATCTTGGCACGGGAGTTCA-3′) contained a unique site forBglII. PCR products were digested with KpnI andBglII and re-ligated into KpnI andBglII sites of pGL3-Basic to generate plasmids containing segments of the TauT promoter sequence extending from the +48 nucleotide corresponding to the transcriptional start site. The constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The p53-binding site deletion (del pGL-563) and p53 mutation (mt pGL-963) constructs were generated from the p963 plasmid by using sense primers 5′-GGGGTACCGAGTTGGGGAGGGA-3′, and 5′-GGGGTACCAGATGAGGAAACCCCCACACAGAAGGTCTGGGGCTTGCCTGATGTCA-3′, respectively. The antisense primer used for these constructs was the same as described above. Human embryonic kidney (293), normal rat kidney (NRK-52E), pig kidney (LLC-PK1), and murine fibroblast 10(1) and 10(1)val (expressing a ts p53) cells were cultured according to American Type Culture Collection guidelines. Briefly, cells were grown as confluent monolayers in 10-cm diameter tissue culture plates in media specific for each cell line with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Cells were plated 18 h before transfection and fed with fresh medium 4 h before transfection. Taurine transport studies were performed on confluent monolayers 3 days after seeding cells. Briefly, cells were washed with Earle's balanced salt solution at 37 °C. Uptake was initiated by the addition of uptake buffer (2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 96 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.6) to which 50 μm unlabeled taurine and 0.5 μCi/ml [14C]taurine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were added. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, uptake was terminated by the removal of uptake buffer followed by three rapid washes with cold Earle's balanced salt solution. Cells were solubilized in 1% SDS in 0.2 n NaOH and radioactivity was counted in a liquid scintillation analyzer (2000-CA; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). NRK-52E cells were stably transfected with a temperature-sensitive mutant p53 allele (ts p53 val 135), which expresses a mutant p53 product at 37 °C in transfected cells, but wild-type p53 conformation when the cells are cultured at 32 °C. NRK-52E cells were transfected with nsvcl/neo val 135 (a DNA construct containing the neo and ts p53 genes) and CMV neo Bam plasmid DNA (vector control) using a LipofectAMINE transfection kit (Invitrogen). Geneticin (G418; 1 mg/ml, BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was used for colony selection. G418-resistant colonies (NRK-52E/ts p53) were screened by Western blot analysis for p53 expression. To test the role of wild-type p53 in TauT expression, p53-positive NRK-52E cells were used in our study. Plasmid DNA was introduced into cultured mammalian cells using cationic liposomes (LipofectAMINE). Transfection was carried out for 16–18 h, and then cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in fresh medium for 24–48 h before harvesting. pGL-control, which contains a luciferase gene driven by the SV40 early region promoter/enhancer, and empty pGL-Basic vectors were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. To standardize the transfection efficiency, 0.1 μg of pRL-CMV vector (pRL Renilla reniformis luciferase control reporter vector; Promega) was cotransfected in all experiments. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and lysed in 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). A luciferase assay was performed using a dual luciferase assay kit (Promega), and activity was measured with an Optocomp 1 luminometer (MGM Instruments, Inc., Hamden, CT). Promoter activity (mean ± S.D. of four samples in relative light units) of each construct is represented by relative light output normalized to pRL-CMV control. Graphs represent typical results of four separate experiments. The concentration of protein in the cell extracts was determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) (15Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217507) Google Scholar). Thirty μg of total RNA were separated in an agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane by overnight capillary blotting in 10× SSC (sodium chloride/sodium citrate buffer). The Northern blot was hybridized overnight at 42 °C with a 32P-labeled riboprobe of the taurine transporter cDNA. The blot was washed successively in standard decreasing concentrations of SSC/0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min each and exposed to Kodak film with one intensifying screen at −80 °C for 24 h. Cells were lysed in 50 μl of mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture for use with mammalian cell and tissue extracts (Sigma). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 2 min, and the supernatants were transferred to clean tubes. Equal amounts of protein (50 μg) were separated by electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) using a semidry electrophoretic transfer system (Bio-Rad). Membranes were incubated in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris base/sodium chloride buffer with 0.2% Tween 20 at 4 °C overnight. The membranes were incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature at the following dilutions: p53 Fl-393 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) 1:2000, and 1:5000 of an affinity-purified antibody against the C-terminal peptide sequence of the taurine transporter (16Han X. Budreau A.M. Chesney R.W. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 1874-1879PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were washed with Tris base/sodium chloride buffer with 0.2% Tween 20 and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (Sigma). TauT or p53 protein was detected using a chemiluminescent detection kit (Pierce). Double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the putative p53-binding site in theTauT promoter region were end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase using [γ-32P]ATP. Nuclear extracts were isolated by high salt extraction of nuclei (17Oz E. Erbas D. Gelir E. Aricioglu A. Gen. Pharmacol. 1999; 33: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The binding reactions were performed by using a gel shift assay system following the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Briefly, the labeled oligonucleotides and nuclear extracts were incubated in gel shift binding buffer (20% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)) on ice for 30 min, and then the DNA-protein complexes were run on 10% nondenaturing acrylamide Tris borate/EDTA gels (Bio-Rad) in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA buffer at 190 V for 45 min. The gel was dried at 70 °C for 30 min and exposed to Kodak film (Eastman Kodak) with an intensifying screen for 1 h at −80 °C. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Luciferase assays are expressed in units of relative light output. The data represent the mean ± S.E. of three or four experiments. Statistical comparisons were made using one-way analysis of variance and Student's t test to determine significant differences in the means. Our initial experiments examined whether doxorubicin, a DNA-damaging drug, would induce endogenous p53 expression in 293 and NRK-52E renal cells. A p53-negative cell line, murine fibroblast (10)1, was used as control. Expression of p53 was induced in both 293 and NRK-52E cells after treatment with doxorubicin (500 ng/ml) for 48 h, compared with untreated cells. As expected, p53 was not detected in (10)1 cells before or after doxorubicin treatment (Fig.1 A). In the renal cells, the increase in the level of p53 was accompanied by a decrease in TauT expression at both the level of mRNA and protein (Fig. 1, B and C). Doxorubicin had no effect onTauT expression in the p53-negative (10)1 cells. To examine the effect of endogenous p53 production on taurine transporter function, the three cell lines above were cultured in the presence of doxorubicin (500 ng/ml) for 48 h and then taurine uptake was measured. As expected, doxorubicin significantly decreased taurine uptake in 293 and NRK-52E renal cells (70% of control) but had no effect in p53-negative (10)1 cells (Fig. 1 D). These results show that overexpression of endogenous p53 decreases expression of TauT in both 293 and NRK-52E cells, which in turn results in the decrease of taurine uptake by the cells. To extend this study, a temperature-sensitive p53 DNA (p53 val 135) was stably transfected into NRK-52E cells. At 37 °C, the p53 protein in these cells exists in a mutant conformation, and a temperature shift to 32 °C induces a wild-type conformation. Expression ofTauT was studied by changing the incubation temperature of the cells. Switching the temperature from 37 to 32 °C for 24 h did not affect expression of TauT in NRK-52E/neo cells (data not shown). NRK-52E/tsp53 cells expressed a high level of p53, which was not affected by temperature switching (Fig.2 A). However, expression of TauT was decreased in NRK-52E/ts p53 cells cultured at 32 °C, whereas the level of the housekeeping gene β-actin remained unchanged (Fig. 2, B and C). The reduction of TauT expression led to a decrease in taurine uptake by wild-type p53-expressing NRK-52E cells (Fig.2 D). The p53-induced down-regulation of TauT was also found to be time-dependent (Fig.3).Figure 3Time course of TauTexpression negatively regulated by wild-type p53. NRK-52E/ts p53 cells were cultured at 32 °C, and then cells were prepared for Northern blot (A), Western blot (B), or taurine uptake (C) analysis at the time points indicated. β-Actin was used as an internal control for loading. The relative levels of intensity of each blot were quantified using a Bio-Rad GS 700 densitometer and expressed as means ± S.E. of three independent experiments. Data were normalized to the β-actin densitometric value. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01versus control (0 h).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether down-regulation of the TauT gene by p53 occurs at the transcriptional level, the reporter construct pGL-963, containing a putative p53-binding site from −663 to −695 (Fig.4 A), was transiently transfected into 293, NRK-52E, and (10)1 cells. Regulation ofTauT promoter function by p53 was examined in cells treated with either doxorubicin or cotransfection of p53. As shown in Fig.4 B, doxorubicin decreased TauT promoter activity in both 293 and NRK-52E cells but had no effect in the (10)1 cells. Consistent with these results, transient cotransfection of p53 also significantly repressed TauT promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4 C). Repression ofTauT promoter function by p53 was confirmed by using NRK-52E cells expressing ts p53. In this study, we demonstrated that the transiently transfected luciferase reporter gene driven by theTauT promoter was markedly down-regulated by wild-type p53 induction (Fig. 4 D). Cotransfection of mutant p53 (p53-281) had no effect on TauT promoter activity (Fig.4 E). However, cotransfection of mutant p53 blocked the effect of wild-type p53 on TauT promoter function, demonstrating the dominant-negative effect of mutant p53. Previous studies have shown that expression ofTauT in renal cells is adaptively regulated by the availability of taurine (1Chesney R.W. Gusowski N. Dabbagh S. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 2213-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To determine whether this renal adaptive regulation of TauT is altered by p53, the reporter construct pGL-963, containing the cis-element for adaptive regulation (4Han X. Budreau A.M. Chesney R.W. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 483: 97-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was transiently transfected into LLC-PK1 cells cultured in medium containing 0, 50, or 500 μm taurine for 48 h with or without doxorubicin. As shown in Fig.5 A, TauT promoter activity was adaptively regulated by the external concentration of taurine (i.e. TauT promoter activity was up- or down-regulated when cells were cultured in medium containing 0 or 500 μm taurine) compared with control (50 μmtaurine). Activation of p53 by doxorubicin repressed TauTpromoter activity but had no effect on adaptive regulation ofTauT promoter function. To confirm these results, the function of the taurine transporter was measured in cells cultured in medium containing 0, 50, or 500 μm taurine for 48 h with or without doxorubicin. As shown in Fig. 5 B, taurine uptake by the cells was adaptively regulated by medium taurine concentration. Treatment with doxorubicin reduced uptake of taurine by LLC-PK1 cells but did not alter the taurine concentration-mediated adaptive regulation of TauT expression. To determine whether the putative p53-binding site is necessary for repression of TauT promoter activity, we created two constructs that contained either a deletion or a mutation of the p53-binding site (Fig.6 A). The negative effect of p53 on TauT promoter activity was abolished in both constructs (Fig. 6 B), suggesting that the DNA sequence of the TauT promoter sequence from −663 to −695 is essential for p53-induced down-regulation of TauT expression in renal cells. To define whether p53 binds to this putative p53-binding site in the TauT promoter, we carried out electrophoretic mobility shift assays using a synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to this site (Fig. 7 A). As shown in Fig. 7 B, nuclear extracts from p53-positive (10)1val cells, which produce wild-type p53, yielded a band (lane 3) that could be competed out by excess unlabeled probe (lanes 4 and5). p53-negative (10)1 cells did not yield a band (lane 2). A nonspecific oligonucleotide (lane 6) and a mutated oligonucleotide (lane 7; the p53-binding core sequence CTTG was mutated to TTTT) were found to be unable to compete for the p53 binding to this putative site. Furthermore, mutation of the core sequence results in the loss of p53 binding to this site (lane 8). A polyclonal antibody to p53 (FL-393, 1 μg) resulted in a minor supershifted band (lane 9). However, a significant supershift was observed when a higher dose of antibody (Ab-7, 2 μg) was applied to the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 7 C), suggesting that p53 specifically binds to the putative p53-binding site in the TauT promoter region.Figure 7Electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the putative p53-binding site sequence of the TauTpromoter.

Ballard-Croft C. Azuma J. Takahashi K. Kakhniashvili D.G. Jenkins T.E. Amino Acids. 1998; 15: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Competitive inhibition of taurine transport by β-alanine decreases intracellular taurine content and impairs cell volume regulation, which can lead to abnormal cell size and shape (19Sturman J.A. French J.H. Wisniewski H.M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1985; 179: 43-52Google Scholar). Therefore, factors that affect the taurine transporter gene at either the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level may cause taurine deficiency in certain types of cells. In cats, in utero taurine deficiency results in gait disturbance and abnormal development of the cerebellum, spine, retina, and kidney (19Sturman J.A. French J.H. Wisniewski H.M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1985; 179: 43-52Google Scholar). Of particular interest is that the taurine-deficient cat model displays renal defects that include simplification of the tubular epithelium and renal scarring. Nearly identical renal histopathologic findings are present in the kidneys of the p53 overexpression mouse (10Godley L.A. Eckhaus M. Paglino J.J. Owens J. Varmus H.E. Genes Dev. 1996; 110: 836-850Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Heller-Stilb et al. (11Heller-Stilb B. Van Roeyen C. Rascher K. Hatrwig H. Huth A. Seeliger M.W. Warskulat U. Häussinger D. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 231-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) have generated a line of taurine transporter knockout (taut−/−) mice expressing a truncated transporter protein in the kidney, in which the renal level of taurine is about 20% of normal control (taut+/+ mice). This truncated transporter seems to be partially functioning, because renal cells do not synthesize taurine and the relatively large amount of taurine found in the kidney must be transferred from the liver and/or diet by active uptake. In contrast, the taurine content of heart and skeletal muscle of taut−/− mice was reduced to 1–2% of thetaut+/+ mice. Mutation of TauT results in retinal degeneration and diminished renal size, suggesting that TauT per se plays an important role in normal retinal and renal development. These observations led us to investigate whetherTauT is a target of the p53 tumor suppressor gene and whether altered expression of TauT is a possible mechanism by which overexpression of p53 induces kidney malformation. We have identified TauT as a gene related to renal development that is negatively regulated by p53 in renal cells. Unlike other p53 target genes, such as survivin, cdc2,cdc25c, or p21waf1, TauTis not a cell cycle-regulated gene (20Hoffman W.H. Biade S. Zilfou J.T. Chen J. Murphy M. J. Biol.

Expression ofTauT has been detected in a variety of tissues, and it is particularly abundant in kidney cells and proliferating lymphocytes. In the kidney, which controls the total body pool of taurine, expression of TauT is adaptively regulated by the availability of dietary taurine. We have shown that the cis-element for TauTadaptive regulation is located immediately downstream of a consensus p53-binding site in the TauT promoter region (14Han X. Budreau A.M. Chesney R.W. Huxtable R. Taurine 4. 483. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York2000: 535-544Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that activation of p53 by doxorubicin repressedTauT expression but did not impair renal adaptive regulation of the TauT gene. The importance of this renal adaptive regulation of TauT expression is unknown, but it could be important in the development of the embryo, because the TauTmutant female mice mentioned above showed a marked fetal wastage (11Heller-Stilb B.

FASEB J. 2002; 16: 231-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), as did the taurine-deficient cat model (2Imaki H. Moretz R.C. Wisniewski H.M. Sturman J.A. Dev. Neurosci. 1986; 8: 160-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that p53 binds to the TauT promoter at a consensus p53-binding site, raising the possibility that p53 represses TauT by interfering with Sp1-mediated transactivation. We have found that the Sp1 transcription factor is essential for the basal promoter function of TauT by showing that deletion of Sp1 sites located in the TauT basal promoter region abolishes the TauT promoter-driven reporter gene expression (4Han X. Budreau A.M. Chesney R.W. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 483: 97-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bargonetti et al. (24Bargonetti J. Chicas A. White D. Prives C. Cell. Mol. Biol. (Noisy-Le-Grand). 1997; 43: 935-949PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that p53 binds to a region of SV40 that contains GC-box DNA-binding sites for the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor Sp1. They further demonstrated that p53 repressed human immunodeficiency virus-long terminal repeat transcription by influencing Sp1 binding to the Sp1 sites located in the human immunodeficiency virus-long terminal repeat promoter region, which resulted in a change in the DNA binding capacity of Sp1. It has been shown that Sp1 and p53 form a heterocomplex that can recognize either p53- or Sp1-binding sites, and the p53-Sp1 complex functions as a repressor for many genes (24Bargonetti J. Chicas A. White D. Prives C. Cell. Mol. Biol. (Noisy-Le-Grand). 1997; 43: 935-949PubMed Google Scholar, 25Yamabe Y. Shimamoto A. Goto M. Yokota J. Suguwara M. Furuichi Y. Mol. Cell.

The p53-binding consensus site located at −663 to −695 in theTauT promoter region contains two p53-binding half-sites separated by 13 base pairs (Fig. 7 A). Three mismatches were found in one of the half-sites. El-Deiry et al. (26El-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar) defined the consensus p53-binding site as two copies of the sequence 5′-RRR-C(A/T)(T/A)G-YYY-3′ (where R is purine with substitutions of A or G, and Y is pyrimidine with substitutions of T or C), separated by 0–13 base pairs. Functional p53-binding sites can contain up to four mismatches in this consensus, but the C and G residues are invariant. In this study, we showed that p53 repressed TauTtranscription by binding directly to the DNA sequence between −663 and −695 of the TauT promoter. Mutation of this consensus site abolished the p53 binding to the TauT promoter and abrogated the effect of p53 on TauT promoter function. Elevated levels of p53 have been found in the kidneys of animal models of acute renal failure induced by cisplatin administration (27Saad S.Y. Al-Rikabi A.C. Chemotherapy. 2002; 48: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Negative regulation of the TauT gene expression by p53 may play a role in the action of cytotoxic drugs, such as cisplatin-induced renal failure. Cisplatin accumulates in cells from all nephron segments but is preferentially taken up by the highly susceptible proximal tubule cells within the S3 segment, the site for renal adaptive regulation of TauT, which bear the brunt of the damage (28Leibbrandt M.E.I.

Kidney Int. 1997; 52: 748-754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A recent study showed that taurine was able to attenuate cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and protect renal tubular cells from tubular atrophy and apoptosis (30Smith K.E. Borden L.A. Wang C.D. Hartig P.R. Branchek T.A. Weinshank R.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 563-569PubMed Google Scholar). One of the prominent features ofTauT mutant mice is the severe and progressive retinal degeneration caused by programmed cell death (apoptosis) (11Heller-Stilb B. Van Roeyen C. Rascher K. Hatrwig H. Huth A. Seeliger M.W. Warskulat U. Häussinger D. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 231-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Cell shrinkage is a major characteristic of apoptosis. The cell surface receptor Fas (CD95), a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, is a known regulator of apoptosis in certain types of cells (14Han X. Budreau A.M. Chesney R.W. Huxtable R. Taurine 4. 483. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York2000: 535-544Google Scholar). Stimulation of Fas receptor with Fas antibody leads to release of cellular taurine, which coincides with cell shrinkage and precedes DNA fragmentation. However, Fas receptor-mediated apoptosis is blunted by increases in extracellular osmolarity, suggesting that taurine uptake mediated by the taurine transporter plays a role in the cell volume regulatory mechanism during apoptosis. Taken together, these results suggest that TauT plays an important role in the development and maintenance of retinal and renal function and morphology by protecting the cells from stress-induced apoptosis. Whether TauT functions as an anti-apoptotic gene involved directly in the pathway of Fas- and/or p53-induced apoptosis remains the subject of future study."

Each of the AKAP family members utilizes unique targeting domains specific for a particular subcellular compartment. AKAP350 is a multiply spliced AKAP family member localized to the centrosome and the Golgi apparatus. Three splicing events in the carboxyl terminus of AKAP350 generate the AKAP350A, AKAP350B, and AKAP350C proteins. A monoclonal antibody recognizing all three splice variants as well as a polyclonal antibody specific for AKAP350A demonstrated both centrosomal and Golgi apparatus staining in paraformaldehyde-fixed HCA-7 cells. Golgi apparatus-associated AKAP350A staining was dispersed following brefeldin A treatment. Using GFP chimeric constructs of the carboxyl-terminal regions of AKAP350A, a Golgi apparatus targeting domain was identified between amino acids 3259 and 3307 of AKAP350A. This domain was functionally distinguishable from the recently described centrosomal targeting domain (PACT domain, amino acids 3308–3324) located adjacent to the Golgi targeting domain.

Scaffolding proteins are defined by their ability to target proteins to specific subcellular compartments in order to localize the effects of these proteins for specialized cellular functions. One family of scaffolding proteins, AKAPs, 1The abbreviations used are: AKAP, protein kinase A-anchoring protein; PACT, pericentrin-AKAP450 centrosomal targeting; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 1The abbreviations used are: AKAP, protein kinase A-anchoring protein; PACT, pericentrin-AKAP450 centrosomal targeting; GFP, green fluorescent protein. is defined by its ability to bind to the regulatory dimer of protein kinase A. Furthermore, AKAPs are capable of scaffolding other signaling proteins to specific subcellular compartments (1Edwards A.S. Scott J.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 217-221Google Scholar, 2Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Cell. 1996; 85: 9-12Google Scholar, 3Colledge M. Scott J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 216-221Google Scholar, 4Feliciello A. Gottesman M.E. Avvedimento E.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 99-114Google Scholar). The ability of AKAPs to target these complexes resides in unique targeting domains specific for different subcellular compartments. Interestingly, AKAPs are also capable of containing more than one targeting domain and therefore are able to differentially localize signaling proteins. D-AKAP1 contains dual targeting domains that are utilized based upon an amino-terminal splice that selects for the expression of either mitochondrial or endoplasmic reticulum targeting domains (5Huang L.J. Wang L., Ma, Y. Durick K. Perkins G. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Taylor S.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 951-959Google Scholar). Therefore, AKAPs are capable of utilizing one or more targeting domains to localize scaffolded proteins to specific subcellular compartments. Keryer et al. (6Keryer G. Luo Z. Cavadore J.C. Erlichman J. Bornens M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5418-5422Google Scholar) originally reported an RIIbinding protein of 350 kDa localized exclusively at the centrosome in lymphoblasts. We and others have subsequently obtained cDNA sequences coding for 400–450-kDa splice variants of this centrosomal AKAP (7Schmidt P.H. Dransfield D.T. Claudio J.O. Hawley R.G. Trotter K.W.

A monoclonal antibody developed against AKAP350 recognized a 350–450-kDa band, but with consideration to the original report we have used the name AKAP350 (7Schmidt P.H. Dransfield D.T. Claudio J.O. Hawley R.G. Trotter K.W. Milgram S.L. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3055-3066Google Scholar). This antibody also confirmed the centrosomal localization of AKAP350 (7Schmidt P.H. Dransfield D.T. Claudio J.O. Hawley R.G. Trotter K.W. Milgram S.L. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3055-3066Google Scholar). Subsequent reports also identified AKAP350 as a centrosomal protein (8Witczak O. Skalhegg B.S. Keryer G. Bornens M. Tasken K. Jahnsen T. Orstavik S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1858-1868Google Scholar, 9Takahashi M. Shibata H. Shimakawa M. Miyamoto M. Mukai H. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17267-17274Google Scholar). Gillingham and Munro (10Gillingham A.K. Munro S. EMBO J. 2000; 11: 524-529Google Scholar) reported that AKAP350 contains a pericentrin homology region in its carboxyl terminus. This AKAP350 domain is able to target specifically to the centrosome in COS cells. This pericentrin-AKAP450 centrosomal targeting (PACT) domain demonstrated homology with a region of pericentrin that was also able to target to the centrosome (10Gillingham A.K. Munro S. EMBO J. 2000; 11: 524-529Google Scholar). No Golgi apparatus expression was observed by these investigators, leading to the supposition that Golgi apparatus staining may be the result of artifactual cross-reactive immunostaining. Nevertheless, an anti-AKAP350 monoclonal antibody (7Schmidt P.H. Dransfield D.T. Claudio J.O. Hawley R.G. Trotter K.W. Milgram S.L. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3055-3066Google Scholar), and two anti-AKAP350 polyclonal antibodies (9Takahashi M. Shibata H. Shimakawa M. Miyamoto M. Mukai H. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17267-17274Google Scholar) demonstrated noncentrosomal staining in several cell lines and tissues (7Schmidt P.H. Dransfield D.T. Claudio J.O. Hawley R.G. Trotter K.W. Milgram S.L. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3055-3066Google Scholar). Two anti-AKAP350 polyclonal antibodies utilized by Takahashi et al. (9Takahashi M. Shibata H. Shimakawa M. Miyamoto M. Mukai H. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17267-17274Google Scholar) demonstrated Golgi apparatus staining and led to their designation of this protein as CG-NAP (centrosome and Golgi-localized PKN-associated protein) (9Takahashi M. Shibata H. Shimakawa M. Miyamoto M. Mukai H. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17267-17274Google Scholar). Previous studies have reported that AKAP350 can bind to protein kinase N (PKN), proteins phosphatase 2a (PP2a), protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), phosphodiesterase 4D3 (PDE4D3), and protein kinase C epsilon (PKCε) (6Keryer G. Luo Z. Cavadore J.C. Erlichman J. Bornens M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5418-5422Google Scholar, 9Takahashi M. Shibata H. Shimakawa M. Miyamoto M. Mukai H. Ono Y. J. Biol.

AKAP350 could therefore scaffold these proteins to the Golgi apparatus or the centrosome to perform specific functions. The centrosomal targeting domain, PACT, is found in two carboxyl-terminal splice variants of AKAP350 that we have now designated AKAP350A and AKAP350B (7Schmidt P.H. Dransfield D.T. Claudio J.O. Hawley R.G. Trotter K.W. Milgram S.L. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3055-3066Google Scholar). This domain is not found in the novel AKAP350 carboxyl-terminal splice variant, AKAP350C. We now provide definitive demonstration of AKAP350 association with the Golgi apparatus. Antibodies specific for one splice variant, AKAP350A, prominently stain the Golgi apparatus in HCA-7 human colonic adenocarcinoma cells. The localization of AKAP350A to the Golgi apparatus is dependent upon a distinct carboxyl-terminal Golgi apparatus targeting domain located adjacent to the PACT domain. These results suggest that the differential subcellular targeting of AKAP350 is determined by the presence of a centrosomal PACT domain and a distinct Golgi apparatus targeting domain. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Medical College of Georgia Molecular Biology Core Facility. Cy3- or Cy5-conjugated species-specific secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Prolong Antifade and Alexa 488- or 564-conjugated species-specific secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). The 14G2 monoclonal anti-AKAP350 antibody was developed as described previously (7Schmidt P.H. Dransfield D.T. Claudio J.O. Hawley R.G. Trotter K.W. Milgram S.L. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3055-3066Google Scholar). For production of AKAP350A-specific antibodies, a peptide corresponding to the unique region in the carboxyl terminus of the human gastric AKAP350A splice variant was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin using an Imject Immunogen EDC Kit (Pierce). The AKAP350A peptide (GSTTQFHAGMRR) was synthesized in the Medical College of Georgia Molecular Biology Core Facility. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were developed in the Antibody Facility at the University of Georgia. The antibody was affinity-purified using the Amino-Link system (Pierce) with the AKAP350A peptide. 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, was used to elute the AKAP350A antibody from the Amino-Link column. Immunostaining in Western blots of HCA-7 cell lysates showed one band at an estimated 350–450 kDa, which was blocked upon preincubation with 10 μm AKAP350A peptide (data not shown). Immunocytochemical staining with the AKAP350A polyclonal antibody was also blocked by preincubation with 10 μm peptide. HCA-7 cells were grown to confluence on glass coverslips. The cells were then incubated in the absence or presence of 10 μg/ml brefeldin A for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were blocked with 17% donkey serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with 14G2 (mouse anti-AKAP350) (1:85) for 2 h at room temperature. Separate slides were incubated simultaneously with mouse anti-p58 (1:100) or mouse anti-γ-tubulin (1:100), and rabbit anti-AKAP350A (1:300) for 2 h at room temperature. The cells were then simultaneously incubated with Alexa-488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for 60 min. Coverslips were inverted and mounted with Prolong antifade (Molecular Probes). Cells were examined for triple labeling by confocal microscopy (AmershamBiosciences) with maximum intensity projections of 0.3-μm optical sections in the apical region of the cell or epifluorescence microscopy utilizing an Axiophot digital imaging system (Zeiss). Targeting construct sequences were amplified utilizing primers specific for the development of the GFP-chimera fusion proteins: GFP-AKAP350A (amino acids 3259–3524), GFP-L100 (amino acids 3424–3524), GFP-C (amino acids 3308–3424), and GFP-GB (amino acids 3259–3307). EcoRI and SalI sites were utilized to clone into pEGFP-C2 (Clontech). These constructs were transfected with Effectene (Qiagen) into HCA-7 cells, which were then grown overnight on glass coverslips. Cells were fixed and stained as described above. AKAP350 was originally identified as a centrosomal AKAP that was multiply spliced at the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 3) (7Schmidt P.H. Dransfield D.T. Claudio J.O. Hawley R.G. Trotter K.W. Milgram S.L. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3055-3066Google Scholar). Although our original immunocytochemical studies were performed with methanol fixation (7Schmidt P.H. Dransfield D.T. Claudio J.O. Hawley R.G. Trotter K.W. Milgram S.L. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3055-3066Google Scholar), utilization of 4% paraformaldehyde fixation revealed additional staining in HCA-7 cells reminiscent of the Golgi apparatus with the monoclonal anti-AKAP350 antibody, 14G2 (Fig.1). Treatment with brefeldin A disrupted the noncentrosomal staining pattern but had no effect on the 14G2 staining of the centrosome (Fig. 1). The Golgi apparatus localization with the 14G2 antibody was also observed in several other cell lines including HCT116, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, rabbit gastric fibroblasts, and rabbit gastric parietal cells (data not shown). These data established the dual staining of AKAP350 at the Golgi apparatus and the centrosome with the 14G2 antibody, confirming the dual localization of AKAP350 as observed by Takahashi et al.(9Takahashi M. Shibata H. Shimakawa M. Miyamoto M. Mukai H. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17267-17274Google Scholar).Figure 1The noncentrosomal staining of AKAP350 is the Golgi apparatus. HCA-7 cells incubated either in the absence (−BFA) or presence (+BFA) of brefeldin A were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with the anti-AKAP350 antibody (14G2). Arrowheads indicate the Golgi apparatus staining. Note that the centrosomal AKAP350 staining is unaffected by brefeldin A (points of staining).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate further the distribution of AKAP350 in HCA-7 cells, we performed immunocytochemistry with an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody specific for the carboxyl-terminal end of the human gastric clone of AKAP350, AKAP350A (unique sequence displayed in Fig. 3). The AKAP350A carboxyl-terminal sequence is also contained in the sequences of CG-NAP and AKAP450. Dual immunocytochemistry staining with the Golgi apparatus marker p58 and anti-AKAP350A showed colocalization of these antibodies at the Golgi apparatus in paraformaldehyde-fixed HCA-7 cells (Fig. 2 A). The anti-AKAP350A staining also colocalized with Golgi apparatus markers giantin and γ-adaptin (AP-1) (data not shown). AKAP350A antibodies also stained the centrosomes of HCA-7 during interphase and mitosis (Fig. 2). To confirm localization with the Golgi apparatus, we treated HCA-7 cells with brefeldin A and stained with the anti-AKAP350A and anti-p58. The staining of both p58 and AKAP350A were dispersed following brefeldin A treatment (Fig. 2 A). Interestingly, there was a loss of colocalization of anti-AKAP350A with the Golgi apparatus marker (Fig.2 A). The p58 and AKAP350A staining were also dispersed by either nocodazole treatment or in dividing cells (data not shown). These results suggest that the noncentrosomal staining of AKAP350A/AKAP450/CG-NAP in HCA-7 cells reflects targeting of AKAP350A to the Golgi apparatus (7Schmidt P.H. Dransfield D.T. Claudio J.O. Hawley R.G. Trotter K.W. Milgram S.L. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3055-3066Google Scholar). AKAP350A staining of the centrosomes with anti-AKAP350A antibodies was considerably weaker than staining observed with the 14G2 anti-AKAP350 monoclonal antibody. To confirm the localization AKAP350A at the centrosome, HCA-7 cells were dual stained with anti-AKAP350A and the centrosomal marker, γ-tubulin. Fig.2 B demonstrates that anti-AKAP350A stained structures associated with the centrosome. As we have previously noted for 14G2 staining of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (7Schmidt P.H. Dransfield D.T. Claudio J.O. Hawley R.G. Trotter K.W. Milgram S.L. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3055-3066Google Scholar), AKAP350A stained discrete extensions from one centriole. Previous studies have characterized a carboxyl-terminal region responsible for the centrosomal targeting of AKAP350 (10Gillingham A.K. Munro S. EMBO J. 2000; 11: 524-529Google Scholar). This region, designated the PACT domain, is shared by two AKAP350 carboxyl-terminal splice variants, AKAP350A and AKAP350B (Fig. 3). AKAP350C (GenBankTM accession number AF247727), a novel carboxyl-terminal splice variant found by 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) analysis of human lung cDNA, codes for a large carboxyl-terminal truncation of the AKAP350 protein. This splice variant does not contain the centrosomal targeting region (PACT domain) (Fig. 3) (14Steadman B. Schmidt P.H. Shanks R.A. Lapierre L.A. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30165-30176Google Scholar). Because the immunocytochemical studies with anti-AKAP350A demonstrated that AKAP350A is present on the Golgi apparatus in HCA-7 cells, we utilized deletion constructs of the regions surrounding the known centrosomal targeting sequence (PACT domain) in AKAP350A to determine whether the carboxyl terminus of AKAP350 also contained a Golgi apparatus targeting region (Fig.4). We developed a GFP chimeric fusion protein, which coded for the carboxyl terminus of AKAP350A just distal to the last leucine zipper region (GFP-AKAP350A) (Fig. 4). HCA-7 cells were transiently transfected with GFP-AKAP350A, fixed with paraformaldehyde, and separately costained with the anti-AKAP350A antibody and either 14G2 or the Golgi apparatus marker antibody, anti-p58 (Fig. 5). GFP-AKAP350A colocalized with both 14G2 and anti-p58 staining. Therefore, GFP-AKAP350A was capable of targeting to both the Golgi apparatus and the centrosome (Fig. 5). The localization of the GFP-AKAP350A at the Golgi apparatus in HCA-7 cells led us to conclude that the carboxyl-terminal region of AKAP350A contained both Golgi apparatus and centrosome localization domains.Figure 5Localization of GFP-AKAP350A in HCA-7 cells.

We confirmed in HCA-7 cells the observation of Gillingham and Munro (10Gillingham A.K. Munro S. EMBO J. 2000; 11: 524-529Google Scholar) that the last 100 amino acids of AKAP350A (GFP-L100) did not specifically target to either centrosomes or Golgi (Fig. 4, data not shown). Therefore, we expressed GFP-AKAP350-(3259–3307) (GFP-GB) representing the sequence of AKAP350A found between the last leucine zipper region and the centrosomal targeting region (PACT domain) (Fig. 4). HCA-7 cells transiently transfected with GFP-GB were fixed with paraformaldehyde and subsequently costained with either the monoclonal anti-AKAP350 antibody, 14G2, or the Golgi apparatus marker, anti-p58 (Fig.4). GFP-GB colocalized with both the AKAP350 and p58 staining on the Golgi apparatus, but this GFP-chimera did not colocalize with the anti-AKAP350 (14G2) centrosomal staining (Fig.6). The cells transiently transfected with GFP-GB did display nuclear staining, but this staining was similar to that seen in transfections with GFP alone (data not shown). As a comparison, we transiently transfected HCA-7 cells with the centrosomal targeting region (PACT domain) (GFP-C) (Fig. 4). In COS-7 cells, Gillingham and Munro (10Gillingham A.K. Munro S. EMBO J. 2000; 11: 524-529Google Scholar) demonstrated that a construct containing the PACT domain (designated ΔN/ΔC construct in their study, corresponding to amino acids 3321–3402 in AKAP350A) targeted to the centrosome. Similarly, GFP-C (amino acids 3308–3424), also targeted exclusively to the centrosome in HCA-7 cells (Fig.7). Transfected cells also displayed nuclear staining similar to cells transiently transfected with the GFP-GB or GFP alone, but no targeting to the Golgi apparatus was observed (Fig. 7).Figure 7Localization of GFP-C in HCA-7 cells.

Luo Z. Cavadore J.C. Erlichman J. Bornens M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5418-5422Google Scholar) originally defined AKAP350 as a 350-kDa centrosomal, RII-binding protein in KE-37 lymphoblast cells. Following the cloning of this protein, Western blot analysis utilizing an anti-AKAP350 monoclonal antibody, 14G2, recognized a group of 350–450-kDa immunoreactive bands. Immunocytochemistry performed with the 14G2 antibody revealed that AKAP350 was localized to the centrosome (7Schmidt P.H. Dransfield D.T. Claudio J.O. Hawley R.G. Trotter K.W. Milgram S.L. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3055-3066Google Scholar). However, the 14G2 antibody also displayed a noncentrosomal staining pattern, especially in epithelial cell types. Using paraformaldehyde fixation, we have now demonstrated that the noncentrosomal staining with the 14G2 antibody represents staining of the Golgi apparatus. Furthermore, antibodies specific for the AKAP350A splice variant also showed both Golgi and centrosomal staining in HCA-7 cells. These observations confirm the localization at the Golgi apparatus of CG-NAP, which is identical to AKAP350A except for an alternate 5′ start site coding for the entirety of the Yotiao protein in the amino terminus (9Takahashi M. Shibata H. Shimakawa M. Miyamoto M. Mukai H. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17267-17274Google Scholar). Indeed, two polyclonal antibodies developed against Yotiao, which recognize a 350–450-kDa immunoreactive band on Western blots of HCA-7 cells, also demonstrate Golgi apparatus staining in several polarized epithelial cell lines (data not shown). Therefore, antibodies directed toward several different epitopes in AKAP350 demonstrate Golgi apparatus staining. These results all support the association of AKAP350 with the Golgi apparatus. Carboxyl-terminal splicing events in the AKAP350 gene lead to at least four different sequences: AKAP350A, AKAP350B, AKAP350C, and Yotiao. Yotiao, the smallest AKAP350 splice variant, is localized to the post-synaptic densities of neurons and is not observed at the Golgi apparatus in neurons (15Lin J.W. Wyszynski M. Madhavan R. Sealock R. Kim J.U. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2017-2027Google Scholar). Therefore, carboxyl-terminal splicing events could provide a means of differential localization of AKAP350 in the cell. We developed an antibody specific for a unique region of the AKAP350A carboxyl-terminal splice variant. This report suggests that the anti-AKAP350 Golgi apparatus staining observed by Takahashi et al. (9Takahashi M. Shibata H. Shimakawa M. Miyamoto M. Mukai H. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17267-17274Google Scholar) and Schmidt et al. (7Schmidt P.H. Dransfield D.T. Claudio J.O. Hawley R.G. Trotter K.W. Milgram S.L. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3055-3066Google Scholar) may reflect the distribution for AKAP350A. This result contrasts with the reports in KE-37 lymphoblasts (6Keryer G. Luo Z. Cavadore J.C. Erlichman J. Bornens M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5418-5422Google Scholar) and COS cells (10Gillingham A.K. Munro S. EMBO J. 2000; 11: 524-529Google Scholar) that suggest exclusive localization of AKAP350 to the centrosomes. Indeed, we have performed immunocytochemistry with the monoclonal anti-AKAP350 antibody and the polyclonal anti-AKAP350A antibody in Jurkat cells, a T-lymphoblast line. Interestingly, both antibodies demonstrated exclusive staining of the centrosome in Jurkat cells (data not shown). Therefore, AKAP350A is distributed differentially in individual cell types to the centrosome and/or the Golgi apparatus. Thus, the lymphoblast cell line or COS-7 cells used in some investigations may have introduced a bias toward exclusive centrosomal localization. Furthermore, because 14G2 does stain centrosomes in HCA-7 cells more prominently than the AKAP350A antibodies, other AKAP350 splice variants such as AKAP350B are likely to be localized to this organelle. Localization of AKAP350 to both Golgi apparatus and centrosomal compartments suggested that AKAP350 contained more than one targeting domain. Gillingham and Munro (10Gillingham A.K. Munro S. EMBO J. 2000; 11: 524-529Google Scholar) recently described a centrosomal targeting region (the PACT domain, designated as the ΔN/ΔC construct). We utilized a GFP construct (GFP-C) with amino acid sequence similar to the ΔN/ΔC construct and confirmed its ability to target to the centrosome in HCA-7 cells (Fig. 7). Because we had localized AKAP350A to the Golgi apparatus, the carboxyl-terminal end of AKAP350A was utilized to construct a GFP chimeric protein to determine whether there was also a Golgi apparatus targeting sequence. In this report, we have found that GFP-AKAP350A, similar to the GFP-ΔN-3643 construct utilized by Gillingham and Munro (10Gillingham A.K. Munro S. EMBO J. 2000; 11: 524-529Google Scholar) (corresponding to amino acids 3321–3524 in the AKAP350A sequence), demonstrated not only centrosomal but also Golgi apparatus targeting in HCA-7 cells (Fig. 5). Deletion constructs of the GFP-AKAP350A construct determined that a 48-amino acid region adjacent to the recently defined centrosomal targeting region (PACT domain) was sufficient for Golgi apparatus targeting. The Golgi apparatus targeting domain, GFP-GB, localized to the Golgi apparatus and not to the centrosome. Taken together, these data indicate that AKAP350A localizes to the centrosome and the Golgi apparatus via two distinct targeting domains located in its carboxyl terminus. The data presented here contradict the findings of Gillingham and Munro (10Gillingham A.K. Munro S. EMBO J. 2000; 11: 524-529Google Scholar), who reported an exclusive targeting of the AKAP450 sequence to the centrosome. Golgi apparatus localization of GFP-ΔN-3643 (corresponding to GFP-AKAP350A in our report) in COS-7 cells was not observed with the techniques utilized by Gillingham and Munro (10Gillingham A.K. Munro S. EMBO J. 2000; 11: 524-529Google Scholar). Two possible explanations exist for this discrepancy. First, in comparison with HCA-7 cells, COS7 cells maintain a more diffuse organization of the Golgi apparatus. Therefore, Golgi apparatus targeting of a GFP construct could prove more difficult to identify. Second, and more likely, different cell types may display differential targeting of AKAP350A. Four constructs produced by Gillingham and Munro included all but six amino acids on the amino-terminal side of GFP-GB, but no Golgi apparatus localization was observed (10Gillingham A.K. Munro S. EMBO J. 2000; 11: 524-529Google Scholar). When we transfected the GFP-AKAP350A construct into Jurkat cells, only centrosomal targeting was identified (data not shown). We also did not observe GFP-GB localization with the Golgi apparatus in Jurkat cells (data not shown). These results correlate with our localization of AKAP350A immunostaining exclusively to the centrosome in Jurkat cells. Thus, these data suggest that the localization of AKAP350 is cell type-specific. AKAPs are known to bind to and scaffold proteins, facilitating the formation of large macromolecular complexes (16Dodge K. Scott J.D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 58-61Google Scholar). The unique targeting domains found in AKAP350A may direct the assembly of such complexes. For example, the structural integrity of the Golgi apparatus is dependent upon a family of proteins designated golgins (17Barr F.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 381-384Google Scholar, 18Puthenveedu M.A. Linstedt A.D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 227-237Google Scholar). Although AKAP350A is localized to the Golgi apparatus, brefeldin A treatment displaced AKAP350A from Golgi apparatus remnants (Fig. 2). Therefore, the Golgi apparatus targeting is contingent upon a structural component that is lost when the Golgi apparatus is disrupted. AKAP350A could interact with a structural component of the Golgi apparatus via its Golgi apparatus targeting domain. It seems likely that the Golgi apparatus targeting and centrosomal targeting regions interact with specific binding partners on their respective organelles. This report provides discrete mechanisms for the targeting of AKAP350 scaffolded signaling complexes within the cell. Previous studies have reported that AKAP350 can bind to protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase N (PKN), proteins phosphatase 2a (PP2a), protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), phosphodiesterase 4D3 (PDE4D3), and protein kinase C epsilon (PKCε) (6Keryer G. Luo Z. Cavadore J.C. Erlichman J. Bornens M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5418-5422Google Scholar, 9Takahashi M. Shibata H. Shimakawa M. Miyamoto M. Mukai H. Ono Y. J. Biol.

Therefore, these independently utilized targeting domains could provide the cell with the means to control signaling events at both the centrosome and the Golgi apparatus. In an accompanying paper (19Shanks R.A. Larocca M.C. Berryman M. Edwards J.C. Urushidani T. Navarre J. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40973-40980Google Scholar), we have demonstrated the interaction of AKAP350 with a novel CLIC family member, CLIC5B at the Golgi apparatus. Still, this interaction occurs at a site distant from the Golgi apparatus targeting domain of AKAP350. Further targeting motifs likely exist because AKAP350C and Yotiao lack both the PACT domain and the Golgi apparatus targeting region. Targeting of these splice variants could be accomplished via dimerization domains capable of interacting with other AKAP350 splice variants or through distinct targeting domains coded for by the unique carboxyl-terminal sequences of AKAP350C and Yotiao. In summary, we have demonstrated definitively that AKAP350A is associated with the Golgi apparatus in HCA-7 cells. In addition, we have identified a targeting sequence in AKAP350 sufficient for association with the Golgi apparatus in HCA-7 cells. The existence of a distinct Golgi apparatus and centrosomal targeting sequences suggests that the intracellular localization of AKAP350 is regulated by the interaction of these domains with organelle-specific targets. We thank Dr. Lynne A. Lapierre for assistance with the yeast two-hybrid work and for her intellectual input into this manuscript. We also thank Dr. John Scott for providing the anti-Yotiao antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2029732158,"Here we report the discovery of a unique fucosyltransferase (FT) in Caenorhabditis elegans. In studying the activities of FTs in extracts of adult C. elegans, we detected activity toward the unusual disaccharide acceptors Galβ1–4Xyl-R and Galβ1–6GlcNAc-R to generate products with the general structure Fucα1–2Galβ1-R. We identified a gene encoding a unique α1,2FT (designated CE2FT-1), which contains an open reading frame encoding a predicted protein of 355 amino acids with the type 2 topology and domain structure typical of other glycosyltransferases. The predicted cDNA for CE2FT-1 has very low identity (5–10%) at the amino acid level to α1,2FT sequences in humans, rabbits, and mice. Recombinant CE2FT-1 expressed in human 293T cells has high α1,2FT activity toward the simple acceptor Galβ-O-phenyl acceptor to generate Fucα1–2Galβ-R, which in this respect resembles mammalian α1,2FTs. However, CE2FT-1 is otherwise completely different from known α1,2FTs in its acceptor specificity, since it is unable to fucosylate either Galβ1–4Glcβ-R or free lactose and prefers the unusual acceptors Galβ1–4Xylβ-R and Galβ1–6GlcNAc-R. Promoter analysis of the CE2FT-1gene using green fluorescent protein reporter constructs demonstrates that CE2FT-1 is expressed in single cells of early stage embryos and exclusively in the 20 intestinal cells of L1–L4 and adult worms. These and other results suggest that multiple fucosyltransferase genes in C. elegans may encode enzymes with unique activities, expression, and developmental roles.

Mammals possess a number of fucose-containing structures, including those with Fucα1–3GlcNAcβ-R, Fucα1–6GlcNAcβ-R, and Fucα1–2Galβ-R (1Field M.C. Wainwright L.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 2Brockhausen I. Schachter H. Gabius H.J. Gabius S. Glycosciences: Status and Perspective. Chapman and Hall, Weinheim, Germany1997: 79-113Google Scholar). These linkages are generated by a variety of α-fucosyltransferases (FTs)1 derived from a surprisingly high number of genes. Humans have at least six different α1,3FT genes (III, IV, V, VI, VII, and IX), two α1,2FT genes (FUT1 (H) and FUT2 (Se) and an α1,2FT pseudogene (SECI)), and at least one α1,6FT gene (3Oriol R. Mollicone R. Cailleau A. Balanzino L. Breton C. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 4Lowe J.B.

The functions of all of these genes and their cognate fucose-containing glycans are not well understood, but the expression of many of these genes is developmentally regulated and is altered during embryonic development, differentiation, and tumorigenesis. Although genetic approaches in mice have revealed many important insights into the functions of many different genes, particularly in regard to the α1,3FTs and their role in generating cell adhesion ligands (5Lowe J.B. Cell. 2001; 104: 809-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 6McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 97-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), genetic approaches to study glycoconjugate roles in development have been frustrated by the complexity of the large multigene families for most of the glycosyltransferases and consequent enzyme redundancy. This situation has led to the consideration of model systems that may accelerate our understanding of the overall biological functions of fucose-containing glycoconjugates.Caenorhabditis elegans is a highly attractive model system in which to study the potential developmental roles of glycoconjugates, since the worm shares many fundamental biological and biochemical pathways with higher organisms. The potential of using C. elegans to investigate the roles of glycoconjugates in development requires the identification and characterization of specific glycosyltransferases and their cognate structures, which may be important in developmental processes. During the past few years, many different enzymes involved in glycoconjugate biosynthesis have been identified by homology in C. elegans (1Field M.C. Wainwright L.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In our previous studies, we identified an α1,3FT and an α1,2FT activity in C. elegans extracts (7DeBose-Boyd R.A. Nyame A.K. Cummings R.D. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 905-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, further analysis of the acceptor specificity demonstrates that C. elegans has a novel α-1,2FT activity toward the unusual acceptors Galβ1–4Xylβ-R and Galβ1–6GlcNAc-R to synthesize the Fucα1–2Galβ1-R products; such acceptor specificity would be unique among known α1,2FTs. However, recent studies on the O-glycans of C. elegansglycoproteins document the occurrence of such Fucα1–2Galβ1-R linkages (8Guerardel Y. Balanzino L. Maes E. Leroy Y. Coddeville B. Oriol R. Strecker G. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 167-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Searches of the C. elegans genome revealed that dozens of putative fucosyltransferase genes are present (3Oriol R. Mollicone R. Cailleau A. Balanzino L. Breton C. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and the C. elegans genome contains at least 22 different genes encoding putative α1,2FTs with some identity to mammalian α1,2FTs.In this paper, we report our identification of the C. elegans gene (termed CE2FT-1) encoding the α1,2FT (CE2FT-1) capable of fucosylating the disaccharide acceptors Galβ1–4Xylβ-R and Galβ1–6GlcNAc-R but unable to fucosylate lactose. Preliminary studies on other members of this putative α1,2FT family in C. elegans suggest that they differ from CE2FT-1 in acceptor specificity. The expression pattern of CE2FT-1is also unusual and is limited strictly to the 20 intestinal cells in the adult worm. These unexpected findings suggest that each of the FTs in C. elegans may have a unique enzyme activity and role in development.DISCUSSIONGlycoconjugates with the sequence Fucα1–2Gal-R, as in the ABO(H) blood group antigens, are expressed in a wide variety of tissues and commonly occur in the digestive mucosae of a large number of species ranging from amphibians to mammals (1Field M.C. Wainwright L.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 28Apoil P.A. Roubinet F. Despiau S. Mollicone R. Oriol R. Blancher A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2000; 17: 337-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The synthesis of the α1,2-fucosylated structures in humans is catalyzed by two α1,2FTs, encoded by FUT1 and FUT2 (also known as the Se gene), which differ slightly in acceptor specificity (29Le Pendu J.

In addition, humans possess another allele termedSEC1, which is a pseudogene (33Kelly R.J. Rouquier S. Giorgi D. Lennon G.G. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4640-4649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The orthologues for the human FUT1, FUT2, and SEC1 genes have been described in rodents and termed FTA, FTB, and FTC, respectively (34Bureau V. Marionneau S. Cailleau-Thomas A., Le Moullac-Vaidye B. Liehr T. Le Pendu J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1006-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Little is known about the functions of the α1,2-fucosyltransferases and their cognate structure Fucα1–2Gal-R in animals.In all species so far examined, FUT2 (Se) is expressed in the intestine. The ileal epithelium of adult mice in normal growth cages is characterized by expression of glycoconjugates with the sequence Fucα1–2Gal-R; however, the intestines of germ-free mice are deficient in such fucose-containing structures (35Bry L. Falk P.G. Midtvedt T. Gordon J.I. Science. 1996; 273: 1380-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Inoculation of the germ-free mice with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron significantly stimulated expression of Fucα1–2Gal-R structures and transcripts encoding an α1,2FT (35Bry L. Falk P.G. Midtvedt T. Gordon J.I. Science. 1996; 273: 1380-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), which could be derived from either SEC1 or FUT2(36Domino S.E. Zhang L. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23748-23756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It was recently shown in germ-free mice that administration of intestinal microbes stimulated expression of MFUT-II, the ortholog of human FUCT2 (Se) and rat FTB (37Lin B. Hayashi Y. Saito M. Sakakibara Y. Yanagisawa M. Iwamori M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1487: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 38Lin B. Saito M. Sakakibara Y. Hayashi Y. Yanagisawa M. Iwamori M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 388: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The bacteria-dependent commensal stimulation of host fucosylation is a complex phenomenon involved in generating metabolic fucose to sustain bacterial flora (39Hooper L.V. Wong M.H. Thelin A. Hansson L. Falk P.G. Gordon J.I. Science. 2001; 291: 881-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar). We do not yet know whether expression of CE2FT-1 in the intestinal cells of C. elegansis induced by bacterial factors, but since the worms are constitutively grown using E. coli as a nutrient source, there may be a role for bacterial products in regulating gene expression.Other functions of Fucα1–2Gal-R have also been proposed. H-type 1 oligosaccharides with the structure Fucα1–2Galβ1–3GlcNAc-R are differentially expressed during mouse embryogenesis and have been proposed to be involved in early implantation events (40Lindenberg S. Kimber S.J. Kallin E. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1990; 89: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 41Yamagata T. Yamazaki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 1004-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The α1,2FT activity varies during the estrous cycle and is elevated ∼5-fold during estrous (42White S. Kimber S.J. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 50: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, implantation appears to be normal in mice genetically deficient in both murine homologs ofFUT1 and FUT2 (43Domino S.E. Zhang L. Gillespie P.J. Saunders T.L. Lowe J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8336-8345Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).Several other genes are known to be specifically expressed in the intestinal cells of C. elegans, such as theN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I gene Gly14 (24Chen S. Zhou S. Sarkar M. Spence A.M. Schachter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 288-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and the genes encoding cathepsin L (44Hashmi S. Britton C. Liu J. Guiliano D.B. Oksov Y. Lustigman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3477-3486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and cysteine protease (45Ray C. McKerrow J.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 51: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). There is some information about the regulatory factors driving gut-specific expression of the cysteine protease gene cpr-1. The cpr-1 gene has two upstream GATA-like motifs at −51 (GATAA) and −147 (GATAA) to the transcriptional start site (46Britton C. McKerrow J.H. Johnstone I.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 47Britton C. Redmond D.L. Knox D.P. McKerrow J.H. Barry J.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 103: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The results showed that the both elements are required for protein expression (46Britton C. McKerrow J.H. Johnstone I.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Similarly, it was reported that the gut-specific expression of the Hemonchus contortus geneAC-2 in C. elegans is dependent on a reverse GATA element (TTATC) at position −48 to the translation start site (47Britton C. Redmond D.L. Knox D.P. McKerrow J.H. Barry J.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 103: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We have inspected the upstream 5′ sequence ofCE2FT-1 for the presence of these GATA-like motifs. There are two such GATA-like motifs at −112 (GATAA) and at −125 (GATAA) 5′ upstream to the translational start site for CE2FT-1. Whether one or both of these elements is important for expression of theCE2FT-1 gene is not known at present.We also inspected the 5′-untranslated sequences of some other C. elegans glycosyltransferase genes for the presence of GATA-like elements that might contribute to intestinal expression. The gene encoding CEFT-1, an α1,3FT that synthesizes Fucα1–3GlcNAc-R linkages (7DeBose-Boyd R.A. Nyame A.K. Cummings R.D. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 905-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), lacks GATA elements within −500 of the translation initiation site. Our recent expression studies on CEFT-1 expression show that it is not expressed in intestinal cells of adult C. elegans but is expressed in specific neural cells. 2K. Nguyen, I. van Die, G. Molder, R. Barstead, and R. D. Cummings, manuscript in preparation. However, an open reading frame within cosmid EGAP9.3, which is in the same locus as CE2FT-1, also encodes a putative α1,2FT and contains one GATA-like element at −85 upstream of the translation initiation site, suggesting that it may also be specifically expressed in intestinal cells. Interestingly, the Gly14 gene encoding anN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (24Chen S. Zhou S. Sarkar M. Spence A.M. Schachter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 288-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was shown to be expressed specifically in intestinal cells. Our inspection of the 5′-untranslated region of the Gly14 gene reveals that it contains two GATA-like motifs within −300 of the translation initiation site. These comparative results suggest that the GATA-like elements in the 5′-untranslated sequences of some glycosyltransferase genes, such as CE2FT-1, might be important in regulating their intestine-specific expression.The amino acid sequence of CE2FT-1 displays a very low identity (5–10%) to the sequences of previously described vertebrate α1,2FTs. Previous studies have identified three motifs in the C-terminal regions of the vertebrate α1,2FT gene family termed I, II, and III (3Oriol R. Mollicone R. Cailleau A. Balanzino L. Breton C. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and in prokaryotic (Helicobacter pylori) α1,2FT (48Wang G. Boulton P.G. Chan N.W. Palcic M.M. Taylor D.E. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3245-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), as indicated in Fig. 3. Motifs I and III are conserved in CE2FT-1; however, motif II is not well conserved. The C-terminal or luminal domain of the protein is predicted to be Golgi-resident and constitute the catalytic domain based on analogy to mammalian α1,2FTs (49Larsen R.D. Ernst L.K. Nair R.P. Lowe J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6674-6678Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The roles of these α1,2FT motifs are not known, but their presence in the catalytic domain suggests that they may be involved in interactions with either acceptor glycans or GDP-Fuc. Although purely speculative, the weak conservation of motif II in CE2FT-1 might be associated with its inability to transfer to lactose and other simple Galβ1–4Glc(NAc)-R acceptors as do the mammalian α1,2FTs.Little is currently known about the roles of glycoconjugates inC. elegans development. Two of the eight sqvgenes regulating vulval epithelial invagination have homologies to glycosyltransferase genes, including sqv-3, homologous to members of the β1,4-galactosyltransferase gene family, which may be involved in elongation of the glycosaminoglycan core linkage to Xyl-Ser, and sqv-8, homologous to two vertebrate β1,3-glucuronyltransferases (25Herman T.

All of these genes have been shown to be functionally involved in glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis in vivo (54Bulik D.A. Wei G. Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Waldrip W.R. Esko J.D. Robbins P.W. Selleck S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For example, a cytosolic α1,2FT named Skp1 was recently identified inDictyostelium (56van der Wel H. Morris H.R. Panico M. Paxton T. North S.J. Dell A. Thomson J.M. West C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33952-33963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), which lacks significant homology to any previously identified fucosyltransferases. Skp1 is also significantly different enzymatically and structurally from CE2FT-1 and other known mammalian α1,2FT, in that Skp1 requires divalent cations and reducing conditions for activity, is cytosolic rather than compartmentalized, lacks a membrane anchor domain, and lacks several sequence motifs that are highly conserved in prokaryotic, microbial, and mammalian α1,2FTs (3Oriol R. Mollicone R. Cailleau A. Balanzino L. Breton C. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar).The CE2FT-1 we have identified may be partly responsible for synthesizing the unusual Fucα1–2Galβ1–6Gal-R linkages recently reported in complex-type O-glycans in adult C. elegans glycoproteins (8Guerardel Y. Balanzino L. Maes E. Leroy Y. Coddeville B. Oriol R. Strecker G. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 167-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The α1,2-linked fucose occurred in complex structures, such as Fucα1–2(Galβ1–6)Galβ1–6(Galβ1–3)(Fucα1–2)Galβ1–3(Glcβ1–6)GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAcβ1-Ser/Thr, in which the Fuc residue was 2-O-methylated. CE2FT-1 acts particularly well on β1–6-branched Gal residues, as in Galβ1–6GlcNAc (Table I), but not Galβ1–4GlcNAc residues (TableI). Interestingly, no Galβ1–4GlcNAc residues were observed inO-glycans from C. elegans (8Guerardel Y. Balanzino L. Maes E. Leroy Y. Coddeville B. Oriol R. Strecker G. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 167-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In addition, it is possible that the predicted glycan Galβ1–4Xylβ1-Ser generated by enzyme β1,4-galactosyltransferase encoded by the sqv3 gene (54Bulik D.A. Wei G. Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Waldrip W.R. Esko J.D. Robbins P.W. Selleck S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10838-10843Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) could be an endogenous acceptor for CE2FT-1, since we found that CE2FT-1 shows the highest acceptor activity toward Galβ1–4Xylβ-O-benzyl. However, in one study, no α1,2-fucosylated glycosaminoglycan core structures were found in studies on complex-type O-glycans of C. elegans(8Guerardel Y. Balanzino L. Maes E. Leroy Y. Coddeville B. Oriol R. Strecker G. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 167-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), but it is possible that such modifications may be restricted to core structures in only the 20 gut cells of the organism. Further studies will be required to define the exact role of CE2FT-1 and each of the other members of this large family of α1,2FTs in specific glycoconjugate synthesis and worm development. Fucose-containing glycans are important in a number of biological processes, including their roles as a component of the ligands in mediating leukocyte adhesion to selectins. Mammals possess a number of fucose-containing structures, including those with Fucα1–3GlcNAcβ-R, Fucα1–6GlcNAcβ-R, and Fucα1–2Galβ-R (1Field M.C. Wainwright L.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 2Brockhausen I. Schachter H. Gabius H.J. Gabius S. Glycosciences: Status and Perspective. Chapman and Hall, Weinheim, Germany1997: 79-113Google Scholar). These linkages are generated by a variety of α-fucosyltransferases (FTs)1 derived from a surprisingly high number of genes. Humans have at least six different α1,3FT genes (III, IV, V, VI, VII, and IX), two α1,2FT genes (FUT1 (H) and FUT2 (Se) and an α1,2FT pseudogene (SECI)), and at least one α1,6FT gene (3Oriol R. Mollicone R. Cailleau A. Balanzino L. Breton C. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 4Lowe J.B. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1418-1426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 5Lowe J.B. Cell. 2001; 104: 809-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The functions of all of these genes and their cognate fucose-containing glycans are not well understood, but the expression of many of these genes is developmentally regulated and is altered during embryonic development, differentiation, and tumorigenesis. Although genetic approaches in mice have revealed many important insights into the functions of many different genes, particularly in regard to the α1,3FTs and their role in generating cell adhesion ligands (5Lowe J.B. Cell. 2001; 104: 809-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 6McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 97-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), genetic approaches to study glycoconjugate roles in development have been frustrated by the complexity of the large multigene families for most of the glycosyltransferases and consequent enzyme redundancy. This situation has led to the consideration of model systems that may accelerate our understanding of the overall biological functions of fucose-containing glycoconjugates. Caenorhabditis elegans is a highly attractive model system in which to study the potential developmental roles of glycoconjugates, since the worm shares many fundamental biological and biochemical pathways with higher organisms. The potential of using C. elegans to investigate the roles of glycoconjugates in development requires the identification and characterization of specific glycosyltransferases and their cognate structures, which may be important in developmental processes. During the past few years, many different enzymes involved in glycoconjugate biosynthesis have been identified by homology in C. elegans (1Field M.C. Wainwright L.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In our previous studies, we identified an α1,3FT and an α1,2FT activity in C. elegans extracts (7DeBose-Boyd R.A. Nyame A.K. Cummings R.D. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 905-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, further analysis of the acceptor specificity demonstrates that C. elegans has a novel α-1,2FT activity toward the unusual acceptors Galβ1–4Xylβ-R and Galβ1–6GlcNAc-R to synthesize the Fucα1–2Galβ1-R products; such acceptor specificity would be unique among known α1,2FTs. However, recent studies on the O-glycans of C. elegansglycoproteins document the occurrence of such Fucα1–2Galβ1-R linkages (8Guerardel Y. Balanzino L. Maes E. Leroy Y. Coddeville B. Oriol R. Strecker G. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 167-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Searches of the C. elegans genome revealed that dozens of putative fucosyltransferase genes are present (3Oriol R. Mollicone R. Cailleau A. Balanzino L. Breton C. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and the C. elegans genome contains at least 22 different genes encoding putative α1,2FTs with some identity to mammalian α1,2FTs. In this paper, we report our identification of the C. elegans gene (termed CE2FT-1) encoding the α1,2FT (CE2FT-1) capable of fucosylating the disaccharide acceptors Galβ1–4Xylβ-R and Galβ1–6GlcNAc-R but unable to fucosylate lactose. Preliminary studies on other members of this putative α1,2FT family in C. elegans suggest that they differ from CE2FT-1 in acceptor specificity. The expression pattern of CE2FT-1is also unusual and is limited strictly to the 20 intestinal cells in the adult worm. These unexpected findings suggest that each of the FTs in C. elegans may have a unique enzyme activity and role in development. DISCUSSIONGlycoconjugates with the sequence Fucα1–2Gal-R, as in the ABO(H) blood group antigens, are expressed in a wide variety of tissues and commonly occur in the digestive mucosae of a large number of species ranging from amphibians to mammals (1Field M.C. Wainwright L.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 28Apoil P.A. Roubinet F. Despiau S. Mollicone R. Oriol R. Blancher A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2000; 17: 337-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The synthesis of the α1,2-fucosylated structures in humans is catalyzed by two α1,2FTs, encoded by FUT1 and FUT2 (also known as the Se gene), which differ slightly in acceptor specificity (29Le Pendu J.

https://openalex.org/W2088166403,"The tumour suppressor p53 has been shown to regulate RNA polymerase (pol) III transcription both in vitro and in vivo. We have characterized the regions of p53 that contribute to this effect. Repression of pol III transcription in vivo does not require residues 13-19 near the N-terminus of p53 that are highly conserved through evolution. However, amino acids 22 and 23 in the adjacent transactivation domain do contribute to the inhibition of pol III activity. Deletions within the central DNA-binding core domain (residues 102-292) of p53 can entirely abolish the repression function in these assays, despite the fact that pol III templates contain no recognized p53 binding site. Deletion or substitution within the C-terminal domain of p53 can also compromise its ability to repress pol III activity in vitro and in transfected cells. These observations reveal that repression of pol III transcription is a complex function involving multiple regions of p53 extending throughout much of the protein."

The intracellular proteins that mediate 1,25(OH)2D3-induced growth inhibition are poorly defined, although it is speculated that p21 and p27 are involved. We tested the requirement of p21 and p27 by treating primary wild-type, p21−/−, and p27−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with 100 nm1,25(OH)2D3. In response to treatment, the wild-type and p21−/− MEFs exhibited 54 and 60% growth inhibition (p < 0.05), respectively, whereas the growth of p27−/− MEFs was unaffected. Western analyses indicated that p27 expression is induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment in wild-type and p21−/− MEFs. p21 expression is also induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment in wild-type and p27−/− MEFs, although the effect is less robust than for p27. Next, we spontaneously immortalized each MEF strain, which resulted in a gain of responsiveness to 1,25(OH)2D3 by the p27−/− MEFs, as exhibited by 87% growth inhibition (p < 0.05). Both wild-type and p21−/− MEFs retained responsiveness (43 and 72% growth inhibition (p < 0.05), respectively). These data from primary and immortalized MEFs demonstrate that there are both p27-dependent and -independent pathways that mediate the antiproliferative action of 1,25(OH)2D3. 1α,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3(1,25(OH)2D3) inhibits the growth of numerous cancer cell types.

Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 719-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent in vitro investigations have identified other vitamin D receptor-dependent actions at target tissues, including inhibition of proliferation through induction of G1 arrest (2Zhuang S.H. Burnstein K.L. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1197-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), cellular differentiation (3Liu M. Lee M.H. Cohen M. Bommakanti M. Freedman L.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 142-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar), and apoptosis (4Fife R.S. Sledge Jr., G.W. Proctor C. Cancer Lett. 1997; 120: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Despite much work focused on elucidating these 1,25(OH)2D3-induced effects, the cellular mechanisms that mediate these actions remain elusive. The observation that 1,25(OH)2D3 arrests cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle has guided investigations to the proteins that are active during this phase, such as cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and their substrates and inhibitors (5Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2925) Google Scholar, 6Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 7Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3205) Google Scholar). CDKs phosphorylate a number of proteins, leading to the progression through the cell cycle. The tumor suppressor protein pRb is a well defined target of G1 CDK activity. pRb controls gene expression mediated by the E2F family of transcription factors by binding and sequestering E2F (8Chellappan S.P. Hiebert S. Mudryj M. Horowitz J.M. Nevins J.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar). Once phosphorylated, pRb releases the E2F transcription factor, enabling E2F to transactivate the expression of various genes involved in cell cycle progression, such as cyclins E and A (9Geng Y. Eaton E.N. Picon M. Roberts J.M. Lundberg A.S. Gifford A. Sardet C. Weinberg R.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1173-1180PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous studies have shown that 1,25(OH)2D3treatment results in decreased phosphorylation of Rb protein (10Hershberger P.A. Modzelewski R.A. Shurin Z.R. Rueger R.M. Trump D.L. Johnson C.S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2644-2649PubMed Google Scholar), decreased cyclin E and A protein expression (11Wang Q.M. Jones J.B. Studzinski G.P. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 264-267PubMed Google Scholar), decreased CDK 2, 4, and 6 activities (2Zhuang S.H. Burnstein K.L. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1197-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 12Wang Q.M. Luo X. Studzinski G.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2851-2855PubMed Google Scholar), and increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27 (11Wang Q.M. Jones J.B. Studzinski G.P.

Cancer. 1997; 76: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Because p21 and p27 inhibit CDK activity, which leads to less phosphorylation of pRb, many have hypothesized that p21 and p27 are the principle mediators of 1,25(OH)2D3 action (3Liu M. Lee M.H. Cohen M. Bommakanti M. Freedman L.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 142-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar,13Kawa S. Nikado T. Aoki Y. Zhai Y. Kumagi T. Furihata K. Fujii S. Klyosawa K. Br. J.

Endocrinol. 1997; 19: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These studies have all been performed in established cancer cell lines, and no evidence is available concerning the effect of treatment on the cell cycle proteins in primary cells. The observations of increased p21 and p27 mRNA and protein expression after 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment are based on correlative Northern or Western data. There are no genetic data to support a requirement for either protein. In addition, data indicating that 1,25(OH)2D3 induces alterations in p21 and p27 expression are inconsistent among various reports; some researchers demonstrate increases in both CDK inhibitors (2Zhuang S.H. Burnstein K.L. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1197-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 13Kawa S. Nikado T. Aoki Y. Zhai Y. Kumagi T. Furihata K. Fujii S. Klyosawa K. Br. J.

Different groups working with the same cell type have reported these contradictions, weakening the possibility that cell-type specificity is responsible for these differences (12Wang Q.M. Luo X. Studzinski G.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2851-2855PubMed Google Scholar, 15Jiang H. Lin J., Su, Z.Z. Collart F.R. Huberman E. Fisher P.B. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3397-3406PubMed Google Scholar). Presently, no definitive data exist that support the idea that 1,25(OH)2D3-induced growth inhibition is caused by p21 and/or p27 increase. Here, we tested the hypotheses that p21 and p27 are essential mediators of the action of 1,25(OH)2D3. To test these hypotheses, we used mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from wild-type mice or from mice with targeted disruption of either p21 or p27. Our results show that p27, not p21, is essential for the antiproliferative action of 1,25(OH)2D3 in primary, but not immortalized, MEFs. These results indicate that there are p27-dependent and -independent mechanisms involved in the action of 1,25(OH)2D3. MEFs from inbred 129/sv wild-type and p27 knock-out mice (16Fero A.L. Rivkin M. Tasch M. Porter P. Carow C.E. Firpo E. Polyak K. Tsai L.-H. Broudy V. Perlmutter R.M. Kaushansky K. Roberts J.M.

Leder P. Cell. 1995; 82: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1938) Google Scholar), were generous gifts of Dr. James Roberts (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center). We spontaneously immortalized these MEFs following the NIH 3T3 protocol (18Wadhwa R. Kaul S.C. Sugimoto Y. Mitsui Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were split every 3 days and plated at 3 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish. Early passage MEFs were defined as passage 8 or below. Late passage MEFs were defined as passage 20 or greater. Cells (1 × 104) were placed in 35-mm dishes with experimental media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (both from Invitrogen) and supplemented with either 0.1% ethanol (vehicle control) or 100 nm1,25(OH)2D3 (BIOMOL Research Laboratories Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA)) (n = 4). Treatment media were changed every 2 days. When cells on control plates reached ∼80–90% confluence (7–8 days), plates were washed twice with Hepes-buffered saline, and cells were trypsinized and collected by centrifugation at 3600 × g for 4 min. Pellets were resuspended in trypan blue dye, and cells were counted on a hemocytometer. Live and dead cell numbers were recorded. Total cell number was calculated based on volume in tubes. Cells (1 × 10−4) were plated onto twenty 35-mm dishes containing treatment media (four each for 0.1% ethanol, and 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 nm 1,25(OH)2D3). Media were changed every 2 days. When cells on control plates reached 80–90% confluence, cells were harvested and counted as described under “Single-point Growth Assays.” Cells were plated at 1 × 104cells per dish onto 60 35-mm dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/5% fetal bovine serum. The first day after plating, media, washes, and cells from four dishes were collected and counted as described. Twenty-eight dishes were treated with 0.1% ethanol, and 28 dishes with 100 nm 1,25(OH)2D3. Each day thereafter, four dishes of vehicle control and four dishes of 1,25(OH)2D3-treated cells were collected and counted. In some cases in which the cells did not grow as well, the experiment was extended beyond 8 days. Cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells per 10-cm dish. Once cells reached ∼50% confluence, medium containing 0.1% ethanol or 100 nm1,25(OH)2D3 was added. At the specified time point, plates were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, then cells were scraped in 1 ml of scraping buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, and 150 mm sodium chloride with a protease inhibitor mixture (final concentrations: chymostatin, 2 μg/ml; leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml; soybean trypsin inhibitor I, 50 μg/ml; pepstatin, 1.4 μg/ml; benzamidine, 333 μg/ml)). Cells were collected by centrifugation at 3600 ×g for 4 min at 4 °C, and pellets were then snap-frozen on dry ice and stored at −80 °C until all time points were harvested. Once time-point harvest was complete, cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (scraping buffer with 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture) and kept on ice for 15 min with occasional vortexing. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,300 × g at 4 °C and then stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was determined by DC protein assay (Bio-Rad), and 40 μg of protein from each of the samples was resolved on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel. Resolved proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK). The membrane was incubated with blocking buffer (5% dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20) for 2 h at room temperature, then incubated with either mouse anti-p21 (Pharmingen) (1:1000) or mouse anti-p27 (BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) (1:3000) antibodies in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Lysates were also analyzed for β-actin expression with mouse anti-β-actin (Sigma) (1:25,000) for 1 h at room temperature. After primary antibody incubation, membranes were washed with wash buffer (1% dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20). They were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) (1:2000) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After washing in wash buffer, the horseradish peroxidase signal was detected using the ECL Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were exposed to Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Films were scanned with a UMAX Astra 2400 X scanner, transmissive setting at 150 dpi. Band densities were analyzed using NIH Image analysis software version 1.62. Time point expression of p21 or p27 relative to actin expression from wild-type and p27−/− MEFs was calculated. The values were then standardized to the control expression of the indicated protein for each time point. Comparisons between groups in single-point growth assays were performed by Student's t test, andp ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Dose response and growth curve results were analyzed by analysis of variance with post-hoc analysis by Scheffé's F-test, and p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. To determine the responsiveness of early passage wild-type MEFs to the active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D3, we treated Swiss wild-type MEFs with vehicle or 100 nm 1,25(OH)2D3. We observed that these MEFs were 70% growth-inhibited, as shown in Fig. 1 A (4.0 + 1.35 × 104 cells for 0.1% ethanol and 1.19 + 0.19 × 104 cells for 1,25(OH)2D3). We next performed Western analysis to examine the effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment on the expression of the CDK inhibitors p21 and p27 in the early passage wild-type MEFs. This analysis showed that p27 protein expression is rapidly and transiently induced after 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment, with a greater than 3-fold induction at 1 h (see Fig. 1, B andC). The expression of p21 is also transiently induced after treatment, although this induction is modest, with only a 25% increase (see Fig. 1 D). These results are consistent with results from three repeated experiments. Because both p21 and p27 were induced after treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3, we tested the response of MEFs derived from p21−/− or p27−/− mice. After confirming the knock-out status of these MEFs by Western analysis (data not shown), we plated and treated early passage Swiss p21−/− and 129/sv wild-type and p27−/− MEFs with vehicle or 100 nm 1,25(OH)2D3. Fig. 2 A demonstrates that 1,25(OH)2D3-treated early passage p21−/− MEFs were 70% growth-inhibited (8.06 + 0.5 × 104 cells for 0.1% ethanol, 2.39 + 0.11 × 104 cells for 100 nm1,25(OH)2D3). Fig. 2 A also demonstrates that both wild-type MEF strains (Swiss and 129/sv) are growth-inhibited by 1,25(OH)2D3. In contrast, there was no difference in growth of vehicle versus1,25(OH)2D3-treated early passage p27−/− MEFs (6.93 + 0.38 × 104 cells and 6.47 + 0.38 × 104 cells, respectively). These data are representative of six growth assays. Fig. 2 Bdemonstrates that the effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on growth inhibition of wild-type (Swiss) and p21−/− MEFs are dose-dependent, with significant growth inhibition detectable at 10 and 1 nm1,25(OH)2D3, respectively. Time-course experiments demonstrate that growth rates of control and 1,25(OH)2D3-treated early passage wild-type (Swiss) and p21−/− MEFs become significant at days 6 and 4, respectively (data not shown). At later time points, live cell number in control groups increases rapidly, whereas that of 1,25(OH)2D3-treated groups increases but at a much slower rate. Although significant growth occurred during the duration of the experiment, the growth rates of controlversus 1,25(OH)2D3-treated p27−/− MEFs were not different at any time point measured (data not shown). In all of the above trypan blue assays, the number of dead cells was consistently between 5 and 10% of the number of live cells for both control and 1,25(OH)2D3-treated cells for all MEF types (data not shown). Also, all MEFs expressed nuclear vitamin D receptors as was shown by immunofluorescence (data not shown). We performed Western analysis of p27 expression in the growth-inhibited p21−/− MEFs. Like the wild-type (Swiss) MEFs, we observed a rapid and transient increase in p27 expression in 1,25(OH)2D3-treated p21−/− MEFs. There was a 2-fold induction at 2 h of treatment (data not shown). Upon investigation of p21 expression in the non-growth-inhibited p27−/− MEFs, we observed a 2-fold induction at 10 h of treatment as shown in Fig. 3. With the intention of expanding our supply of MEFs for future experiments, we spontaneously immortalized these Swiss wild-type, p21−/−, and p27−/− MEFs using the NIH 3T3 protocol. Knock-out status of late passage MEFs was confirmed by Western analysis (data not shown). Upon analysis of the immortalized MEF response to 100 nm 1,25(OH)2D3, we observed that wild-type and p21−/− MEFs retained their responsiveness to 1,25(OH)2D3 as shown by 43 and 72% growth inhibitions, respectively (see Fig.4 A). Surprisingly, immortalized p27−/− MEFs gained responsiveness to 1,25(OH)2D3, as shown by an 87% growth inhibition. Dose-response assays demonstrate that growth inhibition of late passage wild-type MEFs was significant at 10 nm 1,25(OH)2D3, whereas the growth inhibition of late passage p21−/− and p27−/− MEFs was significant at 1 and 100 nm, respectively (see Fig. 4 B). Time course assays show that differential growth between control and treated curves is apparent in all three cell lines at day 4 (see Fig. 4 C). Video time-lapse microscopy analysis of 1,25(OH)2D3-treated late passage p27−/− MEFs showed no indication of apoptosis (data not shown). We then performed Western analysis of p21 expression in control and treated samples of late passage, spontaneously immortalized p27−/− MEFs (see Fig. 5,A and B). We observed that there was a 1.5–2-fold increase in p21 expression after treatment. This induction was observed for at least 12 h of treatment. Although the inhibitory effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment on cell growth have been widely published, the mechanisms that mediate those effects remain elusive. Using mouse knock-out models, we definitively showed here that p27 was one essential mediator of 1,25(OH)2D3growth-inhibitory action. Data from single-point and dose-response growth assays definitively demonstrated that p27 expression was essential for the antiproliferative action of 1,25(OH)2D3 in early passage MEFs. Loss of p21 expression did not affect the ability of early passage MEFs to be growth-inhibited by 1,25(OH)2D3. Wild-type (Swiss), p21−/−, and p27−/− early passage MEFs were also treated with increasing doses of the soy isoflavone genistein, another known antiproliferative agent (19Mitchell J.H. Duthie S.J. Collins A.R. Nutr. Cancer. 2000; 38: 223-228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that all cell types responded to genistein in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). These data strengthen the argument that the p27−/− MEFs were unable to respond to 1,25(OH)2D3-induced growth inhibition because they lacked p27 not because of some intrinsic inability to respond to antiproliferative agents. Western analysis data showed rapid and transient induction of p27 expression in wild-type (Swiss) and p21−/− MEFs. The greatest induction of p27 occurred at 1 h in the wild-type and 2 h in the p21−/− MEFs, suggesting that a rapid event led to an increase in the intracellular level of p27. Given the short time period, it is unlikely that this increase was due solely to an increase in transcription and/or translation of p27. We presume that other events, such as decreased degradation of p27 or nongenomic vitamin D-dependent effects, were responsible for the increase in p27 protein expression. These nongenomic effects have been reported to include rapid transport of calcium through membrane channels and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and protein kinase C (20Beno D.W. Brady L.M. Bissonnette M. Davis B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3642-3647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These rapid actions may be mediated by a membrane-bound vitamin D receptor that differs from the nuclear vitamin D receptor. These actions may be involved in cross-talk with other signaling pathways that affect cellular proliferation and differentiation (21Berry D. Antochi R. Bhatia M. Meckling-Gill K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16090-16096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Based on these Western and growth assay data, we predict that the antiproliferative action of 1,25(OH)2D3 might be mediated by the early increase in p27 expression. Because the differential growth of treated and untreated cells did not become apparent until days 3–5 of treatment in wild-type and p21−/− MEFs, it is likely that induction of p27 might be one of the initial steps of mechanistic action stimulated by treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3. The proteins and steps involved after p27 induction remain to be defined in the MEF model. We speculate that increased availability of p27 leads to increased inhibition of CDK2 activity, which would lead to decreased phosphorylation of proteins such as pRb. These events would culminate in decreased cell proliferation. We also demonstrated a modest, transient increase in p21 expression in growth-inhibited wild-type MEFs as well as an increase in the non-growth-inhibited p27−/− MEFs. The increase in p21 expression in p27−/− MEFs whose growth was not affected by 1,25(OH)2D3 demonstrated that correlative data may not always distinguish between cause and effect. Our approach highlights the value of using genetic models, as opposed to correlative data, to determine the essential roles of potential mediators of 1,25(OH)2D3 action. Growth assays using the late passage (spontaneously immortalized) MEFs demonstrated that neither p27 nor p21 alone was essential for the antiproliferative action of 1,25(OH)2D3 in these MEFs. The gain of responsiveness of the spontaneously immortalized p27−/− MEFs demonstrated that there were also p27-independent mechanisms that mediated the antiproliferative action of 1,25(OH)2D3. Over the course of immortalization, other undetermined mechanisms emerged that had the ability to mediate 1,25(OH)2D3 action. In light of the induction of p21 expression in these p27−/− MEFs, it is possible that a p21- dependent mechanism for 1,25(OH)2D3-induced growth inhibition emerged in these cells to compensate for the loss of p27. This phenomenon of compensation has been observed in other models. In serum-starved p21/p27 double knock-out MEFs, p130, a pRb-related protein, is able to compensate for the loss of these proteins to elicit the antiproliferative response (22Coats S. Whyte P. Fero M.L. Lacy S. Chung G. Randel E. Firpo E. Roberts J.M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 163-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Further investigation is necessary to determine the cause of this gain-of-responsiveness to 1,25(OH)2D3 in the late passage p27−/− MEFs. The disparity between the resulting effects on the growth of early and late passage p27−/− MEFs raises concerns about key issues in the area of cancer therapeutic research. Foremost is that most research is performed in established cell lines. Based on the data presented here, it is possible that the response of primary cells is different from that of established cell lines from the same tissue type. Second, the observation that both primary and immortalized MEFs respond to 1,25(OH)2D3 suggests that vitamin D growth inhibition can be mediated via multiple, perhaps redundant, mechanisms in untransformed and transformed tissues. This conclusion further supports the use of noncalcemic vitamin D analogues as drugs for both the prevention and the treatment of various cancers. In conclusion, we showed definitively that p27 was essential for the antiproliferative action of 1,25(OH)2D3 in early passage MEFs. We also showed that both p27 and p21 were transiently induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment. Spontaneous immortalization of these MEFs resulted in a gain of responsiveness of p27−/− MEFs to 1,25(OH)2D3. These data demonstrate the existence of both p27-dependent and -independent mechanisms, which may include the induction of p27 protein, that mediate the antiproliferative action of 1,25(OH)2D3 in early passage and spontaneously immortalized MEFs."

It has been reported that epidermal growth factor (EGF) induces cPLA2 activation or cPLA2 expression and subsequent AA release. It was of interest to study the effect of EGF on p11 production and on AA release in human epithelial cells (HeLa). EGF (20 ng/ml) treatment of HeLa cells increased the cellular p11 protein and the steady-state levels of p11 mRNA in a time- and dose-dependent manner but did not affect cPLA2 protein expression over a 4–48-h incubation time. Transient transfection experiments of a reporter gene construct containing 1498 bp of the 5′-flanking region of p11 promoter demonstrated that EGF induced p11 gene expression at the transcriptional level. EGF caused a rapid phosphorylation of p44/42 and p38 kinases with a maximum level at 10 min. AG 1478 (EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor), PD 98059 (ERK1/2 inhibitor), and SB 203580 (p38 inhibitor) significantly inhibited EGF-induced p11 expression. EGF-induced AA release was significantly suppressed by AG 1478, PD 98059, SB 203580, and methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphate (a specific cPLA2 inhibitor). Methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphate (50 μm) also significantly inhibited EGF-induced p11 expression, demonstrating that the activation of cPLA2 may have a role in the EGF-induced p11 expression. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that EGF induced increased p11 binding to cPLA2 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. EGF treatment for 30 min increased A23187-induced AA release, whereas EGF treatment for 24 h inhibited A23187-induced AA release. These results suggest that EGF treatment increased p11 bound to cPLA2 may lead to the late suppression of AA release induced by EGF. p11, a member of the S-100 family of proteins, is the cellular ligand of annexin II and also interacts with the C-terminal region of cytosolic phospholipase A2(cPLA2), inhibiting cPLA2 activity and arachidonic acid (AA) release.

AIIt regulates exocytosis and endocytosis by reorganization of F-actin. It also serves as a receptor to interact with tissue plasminogen activator, plasminogen, and procathepsin B (6Kang H.M.

These data suggest that p11, acting as a regulatory protein, modulates the activity of the annexin II subunit and stimulates protease activity by AIIt. p11 also interacts with the C terminus of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and inhibits its activity, resulting in reduced arachidonic acid (AA) release (10Wu T.

Recombinant human EGF was purchased from R&D (Minneapolis, MN). AG 1478, A23187, PD 98059, SB 203580, and methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphate (MAFP) were obtained from Calbiochem. The mouse anti-human annexin II light chain (anti-p11) monoclonal antibody and anti-EGF receptor antibody were from Transduction Laboratories. The sheep anti-human-cPLA2 antibody was from Binding Site (Birmingham, UK). The rabbit anti-p38, anti-p44/42, anti-phosphoserine-cPLA2 (Ser-505), anti-pp38, and anti-pp44/42 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-phosphoserine antibody was from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit IgG were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory, Inc. (West Grove, PA). [3H]AA (1 mCi/ml) and the ECL Western blotting detection system were from Amersham Biosciences. BCA reagents were from Pierce. HeLa cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in 175-cm2 tissue culture flasks or six-well plates. Cells were seeded in six-well plates in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum until 60% confluence and then incubated in the presence or absence of [3H]AA (1 μCi/ml) for 16 h. The labeled cells were washed three times with DMEM without serum. The cells were incubated in 2 ml of DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum containing EGF at a final concentration for the following experiment. All experiments were performed when cells were 80–90% confluent. For the time course experiments, after replacing culture medium at the same time, the cells were treated with or without 20 ng/ml EGF at 4, 12, 24, or 48 h prior to harvest at the 48-h time point. For the dose-response experiments, cells were treated with or without 0.2, 2, or 20 ng/ml EGF and harvested at 12 h. All inhibitors were preincubated for 2 h before treatment with or without EGF. Inhibitors were maintained for the incubation period. The [3H]AA-labeled HeLa cells were stimulated with EGF for 30 min or 24 h, washed, and placed in 2 ml of medium in the presence or absence of A23187 (10−6m) for 30 min. The3H-labeled HeLa cells were preincubated with MAFP (50 μm) (cPLA2 inhibitor), tyrphostin AG 1478 (10 μm) (EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor), PD 98059 (25 μm) (ERK inhibitor), or SB 203580 (10 μm) (p38 pathway inhibitor) for 2 h, and the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing EGF for 30 min. The supernatants were collected, centrifuged at 750 × gfor 10 min, and counted in a scintillation counter (Beckman, Fullerton, CA) for quantification of AA release. HeLa cells grown in six-well plates were treated with or without EGF for the indicated time and dose. Cells were washed three times with cold PBS and lysed in 100 μl of homogenization buffer: 50 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 100 μmleupeptin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm soybean trypsin inhibitor, 15 mm aprotinin, and 0.25% Triton X-100. Cells were then sonicated three times for 15 s and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Total protein was measured using the BCA method. Ten micrograms of crude cell lysate protein were separated on 16% Tris-glycine gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) for p11 and 8% Tris-glycine gels for cPLA2 using Tris-glycine SDS running buffer. The separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Novex), which was then blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk with 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h. p11 or cPLA2protein expression was detected by immunoblotting with a 1:2000 dilution of mouse-anti-human annexin II light chain monoclonal antibody (anti-p11 antibody) or sheep anti-human cPLA2 and a 1:5000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-sheep IgG as the second antibody. The blot was developed using the ECL Western blotting detection system and exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. MR radiographic film. HeLa cells grown in T-175 cm2 flasks were treated with and without EGF (0.2, 2, and 20 ng/ml) for 4–48 h. The cells were washed three times with cold PBS and then collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 1000 × g at 4 °C. Total cellular RNA was extracted using the RNAqueous kit from Ambion (Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was quantified using 260-nm optical density. To construct the probe for p11 mRNA, a 319-bp product of p11 cDNA was amplified by PCR using the following sets of sense and antisense primers: 5′ primer, 5′-ACCACACCAAAATGCCATCT-3′ (corresponding to bases 61–80 of the human p11 cDNA sequence; GenBankTM accession number M81457); 3′ primer, 5′-CTGCTCATTTCTGCCTACTT-3′ (corresponding to bases 361–379 of the p11 cDNA sequence). The product was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Orientation of the insert was determined by DNA sequencing. The p11 cRNA probe and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Ambion, Austin, TX) were radiolabeled using anin vitro transcription kit (Ambion) with SP6 polymerase with [α-32P]UTP (800 μCi (29.6 TBq)/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A p11 sense riboprobe was radiolabeled using in vitro transcription with T7 polymerase. An RPA assay kit (RPAII; Ambion) was used to quantitate target mRNA. Ten micrograms of total RNA (for GAPDH) or 50 μg (for p11) were mixed with 10,000 cpm (for GAPDH) or 20,000 cpm (for p11) of α-32P-labeled riboprobe. The mixture was hybridized at 45 °C overnight and digested by the addition of a 1:100 dilution of RNase A/T1 at 37 °C for 60 min. Digestion was terminated by the addition of the RNase inactivation and precipitation mixture. The protected fragments were separated on 6% polyacrylamide 8 m urea gels (Novex) and visualized by autoradiography. HeLa cells were maintained at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in DMEM with 10% FBS. The day before transfection, 5 × 105 cells were seeded into six-well plates. 1.8 μg of p11 promoter constructs were co-transfected with 0.1 μg of the pCMV/β-galactosidase construct (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) into serum-free cells using 6 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) in each well. After 5 h of transfection, cells were incubated in fresh DMEM medium with 10% FBS for 36 h. The transfected cells were stimulated with EGF (20 ng/ml) for the indicated times and lysed. pCAT and β-galactosidase activity was measured with pCAT and β-galactosidase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The pCAT activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity to represent relative p11 promoter activity. HeLa cells cultured in six-well plates were treated with or without EGF for 5 min, 10 min, 30 min, 1 h, or 2 h. The cells were washed three times with cold PBS, and the medium was aspirated completely. 100 μl of 1× protein loading buffer was added into each well and immediately scraped and collected into microcentrifuge tubes. After sonication for 20 s, the samples were boiled for 10 min and cooled on ice. 20 μl of each sample was separated on a 4–20% Tris-glycine gel, electrophoretically transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and blocked with 5% nonfat milk. The blots were then probed with a 1:2000 dilution of anti-p44/42, anti-p38 or phosphospecific anti-p44/42, anti-p38, or anti-phosphoserine-cPLA2 antibody for 2 h. After three washes, the blots were probed with a 1:2000 dilution of second antibody and developed by using the ECL Western blotting detection system. HeLa cells grown in 175-cm2 tissue culture flasks were washed three times with cold PBS and lysed in 0.5 ml of homogenization buffer as described above. 500 μg of crude cell lysate was added to 200 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (150 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) containing 10 μl of sheep anti-human cPLA2 antibody and incubated at 4 °C on a rotor at medium speed for 4 h. Thirty microliters of protein G-agarose (Pierce) beads were then added to each sample, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h, followed by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 2000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were aspirated, and the pellet was washed four times with immunoprecipitation buffer. The pellet was then suspended in 20 μl of protein loading buffer and boiled for 10 min before electrophoresis on 16% Tris-glycine gels for p11 and 8% Tris-glycine gels for cPLA2. The separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane blocked with 5% nonfat milk and then probed with a 1:2000 dilution of anti-p11 antibody or 1:500 dilution of anti-phosphoserine antibody for 2 h. After three washings, the blots were incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of second antibody and developed by using the ECL Western blotting detection system. iRNAs were prepared by IDT (Coralville, IA) and targeted the coding region 4–24, relative to the start codon of the cPLA2 gene. Single-stranded RNAs were annealed by incubating a 20 μm concentration of each strand in annealing buffer (100 mm potassium acetate, 30 mm HEPES buffer at pH 7.4, 2 mm magnesium acetate) for 2 min at 90 °C. The iRNA sequences used in this study are 5′-GUAAGGAUCUAUAAAUGATT-3′ and 5′-UCAUUUAUAGAUCCUUACTT-3′. HeLa cells were grown as described above and were transfected with 10 nm iRNA duplexes using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). Four hours after transfection, media were changed, and cells were incubated with or without [3H]AA in DMEM with 10% of FBS for 12 h, and an AA release assay was performed as described above. Unlabeled cells were incubated with EGF (20 ng/ml) or with media. After 12 h of incubation with or without EGF, cPLA2 and p11 proteins were detected using immunoblotting as described above. An AmershamBiosciences 301 computing densitometer was used to digitize images. The optical density of bands was analyzed with background subtraction using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). The dose-related effects were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance, and comparisons were performed using two-tailed unpaired Student's t tests. Values ofp < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The effect of EGF on p11 expression was studied. HeLa cells were treated with or without EGF, and cellular p11 protein levels were assessed by Western blot analysis. Fig.1, A and B, demonstrates that p11 is constitutively expressed in untreated HeLa cells. EGF (20 ng/ml) increased p11 protein expression over a 4–24-h period, with a maximum effect observed at 12 h. However, over the incubation period, EGF had no effect on cPLA2 protein expression. Treatment of cells with 0.2, 2, or 20 ng/ml EGF for 12 h resulted in a dose-dependent increase in p11 protein levels (Fig. 1, C and D). To determine whether the observed increase in p11 protein levels correlates with p11 mRNA expression, HeLa cells were incubated with or without EGF (20 ng/ml) for 4–48 h or EGF (0.2, 2, or 20 ng/ml) for 12 h. Total RNA was isolated, and the steady-state p11 mRNA expression was studied by an RPA. The specificity of the p11 antisense riboprobe is presented in Fig.2 A. The antisense riboprobe produced a protected band at ∼300 bases. A sense riboprobe produces no protected band. Cellular RNA incubated with a GAPDH riboprobe is presented in the right panel of Fig.2 A. As shown in Fig. 2, B and C, EGF treatment stimulated an increase in p11 steady-state mRNA levels over 4–12 h, compared with the untreated control cells. Cells treated with 0.2, 2, or 20 ng/ml EGF for 12 h demonstrated a dose-related increase in the steady state p11 mRNA levels in HeLa cells as shown in Fig. 2, D and E. GAPDH mRNA levels are presented as an internal control for equivalent RNA loading and normalization of p11 mRNA expression. To further investigate whether the observed increase in steady-state p11 mRNA levels reflects an EGF-induced increase in p11 gene transcription, a reporter gene construct containing the 1498-bp sequence of the 5′-flanking region of the p11 promoter in the pCAT vector was transfected into HeLa cells. The results are shown in Fig. 3. EGF (20 ng/ml) treatment of HeLa cells induced increased p11 gene transcriptional expression over 2–8 h. β-Galactosidase activity was used to correct for transfection efficiency. Thus, EGF induces p11 expression, at least in part, at the transcriptional level. EGF exerts its effect by binding and activating a specific 170-kDa tyrosine kinase receptor and triggers a subsequent MAP kinase signal transduction cascade. As shown in Fig. 4 A, EGF stimulated the phosphorylation of p44/42 in a time-dependent manner with a maximum activation at 5 and 10 min. To examine whether EGF also stimulated p38 phosphorylation, the same cell lysate was used to immunoblot with phosphospecific anti-pp38 antibody. EGF-induced p38 phosphorylation was also transient, starting at 5 min and with a maximum at 10 min (Fig. 4 B). To examine whether EGF-induced p11 expression is mediated via the activation of EGF receptor and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, the effect of tyrphostin AG 1478, an EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, on EGF-induced p11 expression was studied. As shown in Fig. 5, Aand B, AG 1478 significantly inhibited EGF-induced p11 expression, whereas AG 1478 alone did not affect p11 expression. These data demonstrated that EGF-induced p11 expression is mediated via the activation of the EGF receptor. To further explore whether EGF-activated MAP kinase affects p11 expression, the ERK inhibitor, PD 98059, and p38 inhibitor, SB 203580, were used to study the effect of EGF on p11 expression. After pretreatment with PD 98059 or SB 203580 for 2 h, HeLa cells were incubated with EGF for 12 h. As shown in Fig. 5, C–F, PD 98059 and SB 203580 significantly inhibited EGF-induced p11 expression. Cells treated with inhibitors alone exhibited no effect. These data suggest that both the ERK pathway and the p38 pathway are involved in the induction of p11 by EGF. Phosphorylation of cPLA2 was studied by Western blot and immunoprecipitation. HeLa cells were treated with EGF (20 ng/ml) for 5 min, 10 min, 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h, and the crude cell lysates were immunoblotted with phosphoserine-specific anti-cPLA2 (Ser-505). As shown in Fig.6 A, EGF induced cPLA2 phosphorylation over a 2-h incubation period. These results were further confirmed by immunoprecipitation, using anti-cPLA2 antibody to immunoprecipitate cPLA2, and then immunoblotting with anti-phosphoserine antibody. The results are shown in Fig. 6 B. EGF induced maximum cPLA2phosphorylation at 10–30 min. To determine whether EGF-induced phosphorylation of cPLA2 is mediated via activation of one or both of the above mentioned MAP kinase pathways, cells were preincubated with PD 98059 (25 μm) or SB 203580 (10 μm) for 2 h followed by treatment with EGF (20 ng/ml). Fig. 6, C and D, demonstrates that EGF treatment induces cPLA2 phosphorylation and that pretreatment with PD 98059 partially inhibits that phosphorylation. Similarly, Fig. 6, E and F, demonstrate that pretreatment with the p38 pathway inhibitor, SB 203580, also partially inhibits EGF-induced phosphorylation of cPLA2, suggesting that EGF may signal through both pathways to induce phosphorylation of cPLA2. EGF initiates intracellular signaling by binding to the EGF receptor. To explore whether HeLa cells express the EGF receptor and whether EGF stimulation altered the amount of EGF receptor, HeLa cells were treated with or without EGF (20 ng/ml) for 12 h. Total cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-EGF receptor antibody. As shown in Fig. 7 A, HeLa cells express the EGF receptor, and EGF treatment did not affect EGF receptor expression. To demonstrate that EGF-induced AA release is mediated through EGF receptor activation, the effect of tyrphostin AG 1478 on AA release was studied. The results in Fig. 7 B show that AG 1478 (10 μm) significantly inhibited EGF-induced AA release and did not affect basal release of AA. To confirm that EGF-induced MAP kinase activity directly mediated AA release, PD 98059, a p44/42 kinase inhibitor, and SB 203580, an inhibitor of the p38 pathway, were used to study EGF-stimulated AA release. As shown in Fig.7 C, PD 98059 inhibited EGF-induced AA release, whereas PD 98059 alone did not affect unstimulated AA release. In addition, pretreatment with SB 203580 partially inhibited EGF-induced AA release, suggesting activation of the p38 pathway as well (Fig. 7 D). Pretreatment with both inhibitors blocked EGF-induced AA release (Fig.7 E). Thus, these data demonstrate that EGF mediated the activation of the EGF receptor and MAP kinases, resulting in the cellular release of AA. EGF stimulated the rapid phosphorylation of cPLA2 and subsequent AA release. To confirm that EGF-induced AA release in HeLa cells is mediated by cPLA2, the effect of MAFP, a cPLA2 inhibitor, on AA release was studied. As shown in Fig. 8, EGF-induced AA release was significantly inhibited by MAFP (50 μm). These data suggest that EGF-induced AA release is mediated by cPLA2. EGF activates cPLA2 and induces AA release. Therefore, it was interest to investigate the effect of activation of cPLA2on EGF-induced p11 production. The effect of MAFP on EGF-induced p11 protein expression was studied. The HeLa cells were preincubated with MAFP (50 μm) for 2 h and stimulated with EGF (20 ng/ml) for 12 h. The total cell lysates were then analyzed by Western blot. The data are shown in Fig.9. MAFP pretreatment inhibited EGF-induced p11 expression, whereas MAFP alone had little effect on p11 expression. These data demonstrated that the activation of cPLA2 may mediate the induction of p11 expression by EGF. Anti-cPLA2 iRNAs were utilized in order to further assess the role of cPLA2 in EGF-induced arachidonic acid release and in p11 production. Cells treated with iRNAs exhibited reduced EGF-induced arachidonate release compared with control cells treated with LipofectAMINE alone (Fig.10 A). Western blot of cell lysates from cells treated with iRNAs also demonstrated a reduction in cellular cPLA2 protein (Fig. 10 B). Finally, treatment of cells with iRNAs resulted in a diminished p11 production in response to EGF compared with cells treated with the transfection reagent alone (Fig. 10 C). To study the effect of EGF-induced p11 expression on cPLA2, immunoprecipitation complex from HeLa cells was studied. As shown in Fig. 11, A and B, treatment with 20 ng/ml EGF for 4–24 h induced an increase in p11 co-immunoprecipitated with cPLA2 in a time-dependent manner with a maximum effect at 12–24 h. There also was a dose-dependent effect of EGF treatment on co-immunoprecipitated p11-cPLA2 (Fig. 11, C andD). These results demonstrate that EGF treatment results not only in an increase of cellular p11 expression but also in an increase of p11 bound to cPLA2. To study whether increased binding between p11 and cPLA2 could affect AA release, [3H]AA-labeled HeLa cells were treated with or without EGF (20 ng/ml) for 30 min or 24 h. After EGF treatment, medium was changed, cells were treated with or without A23187 for 30 min, and medium was harvested for scintillation counting. The results shown in Fig.12, A and B, indicate that EGF treatment for 30 min increased both basal andA23187-induced AA release. Interestingly, EGF treatment for 24 h diminished A23187-induced AA release. These data suggest that the inhibitory effect of EGF on AA release at 24 h may be due to EGF-induced p11 expression, which may inhibit cPLA2activity and reduce AA release. p11, or calpatin light chain, is a unique member of the S-100 family of calcium-binding proteins. Although it shares sequence homology with the S100 family, it does not have the ability to bind Ca2+ due to amino acid deletions and substitutions in the two EF-hand motifs. p11 is present in a variety of cells separately or as a heterotetramer with annexin II (AIIt). The expression of p11 and annexin II is not always coordinated, and the ratio of p11 to annexin II varies with different cell types. Munz et al. (31Munz B. Gerke V. Gillitzer R. Werner S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 307-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) reported that wound-derived growth factors (transforming growth factor-β1, EGF, and keratinocyte growth factor) differentially regulate p11 and annexin II expression in cultured keratinocytes during skin injury and modify the ratio between p11 and annexin II. Annexin II tetramer also can act as a surface protein receptor for plasminogen and t-PA. Studies in cPLA2-deficient mice demonstrate that cPLA2 plays an essential role in eicosanoid production and allergic response (19Uozumi N. Kume K. Nagase T. Nakatani N. Ishii S. Tashiro F. Komagata Y. Maki K. Ikuta K. Ouchi Y. Miyazaki J. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 390: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). It was important to investigate the negative regulation of cPLA2 in physiological conditions. Annexin I, or lipocortin I, has been reported to suppress cPLA2activity not only in vitro but also in cultured cells. Thus, annexin I may function as an endogenous negative regulator of cPLA2. p11 interacts with and inhibits cPLA2activity and subsequent AA release in vitro and in vivo (10Wu T. Angus C.W. Yao X.L. Logun C. Shelhamer J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17145-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore, p11 may also function as a negative regulator of cPLA2. p11 has been reported to be regulated in different cell types. Nerve growth factor increases p11 mRNA expression in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells (32Masiakowski P. Shooter E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1277-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Retinoic acid reduces p11 protein levels by a post-translational mechanism in BEAS-2B cells (33Gladwin M.T. Yao X.L. Cowan M. Huang X.L. Schneider R. Grant L.R. Logun C. Shelhamer J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1103-L1109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transforming growth factor-α or the combination of transforming growth factor-α and interleukin-1β induces an increase in p11 protein expression in rat gastric epithelial cells (14Akiba S. Hatazawa R. Ono K. Kitatani K. Hayama M. Sato T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21854-21862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Nitric oxide induces p11 expression through a cGMP-dependent pathway in epithelial cells (34Pawliczak R. Cowan M.J. Huang X. Nanavaty U.B. Alsaaty S. Logun C. Shelhamer J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44613-44621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that EGF induces p11 production in a time- and dose-dependent manner in human epithelial cells (HeLa cells). The effect was correlated with increased steady-state levels of p11 mRNA in response to EGF in a time- and dose-related manner. This effect of EGF on p11 expression was regulated at least in part at the transcriptional level. EGF has been reported to induce cPLA2 expression at the transcriptional level (28Maxwell A.P. Goldberg H.J. Tay A.H., Li, Z.G. Arbus G.S. Skorecki K.L. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 763-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 29Chepenik K.P. Diaz A. Jimenez S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21786-21792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in our experiments, over an incubation up to 48 h, EGF did not appear to affect cPLA2 expression, indicating that EGF induced cPLA2 expression may be cell type-dependent. The binding of EGF to the EGF receptor on the cell surface triggers receptor trans-autophosphorylation and subsequent activation of the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Several experiments were done to explore the signal pathway involved in the induction of EGF-induced p11 production. First, we observed that EGF induces rapid p44/42 and p38 phosphorylation starting at 5 min and with a maximum activation at 10 min. Second, the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, AG 1478, significantly inhibited EGF-induced p11 expression, indicating the involvement of the activation of EGF receptor. Third, PD 98059 and SB 203580 inhibited EGF- induced p11 production, demonstrating that both MAP kinase ERK and p38 participated in this event. Thus, the addition of EGF activates the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase and subsequent MAP kinase ERK and p38 pathway, resulting in the induction of p11. Previous work has shown that EGF stimulates AA release through the phosphorylation of cPLA2. In our studies, we observed similar results with two sets of experiments. First both Western blot and immunoprecipitation experiments showed that EGF treatment resulted in phosphorylation of cPLA2, starting at 5 min and with a maximum activation at 10–30 min. Second, cells pretreated with MAFP significantly inhibited EGF-induced AA release, suggesting that the activation of cPLA2 is responsible for EGF-induced AA release. In addition, AG 1478, PD 98059, and SB 203580 significantly inhibited EGF-induced AA release, indicating that the activation of cPLA2 by EGF is through the activation of EGF receptor and subsequent MAP kinase pathways. To further study whether these events of the activation of cPLA2 and AA release could influence p11 production, we showed that MAFP pretreatment significantly suppressed EGF-induced p11 expression. These data suggest that the activation of cPLA2 may play a role in the induction of p11 by EGF. We postulate that EGF induced p11 expression through the activation of EGF receptor, MAP kinase, and cPLA2. Whether EGF-induced AA or AA metabolites contribute to the p11 expression by EGF requires further study. To better understand the temporal influence of EGF-induced p11 expression on cPLA2 activity and the cellular AA release, we demonstrated that EGF increased p11 co-immunoprecipitated with cPLA2 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Further, the treatment of HeLa cells with EGF for 30 min increased A23187-induced AA release, whereas treatment with EGF for 24 h significantly diminishedA23187-induced AA release. This observation led us to postulate that an inhibitory effect of EGF on A23187-induced AA release at 24 h might be due to an EGF-induced increase in p11, which binds to and inhibits cPLA2 activity and subsequent AA release. Recently, it has been reported that RGM1 cells treated with transforming growth factor-α resulted in an inhibitory effect ofA23187-induced AA release at 3–24 h, which correlated with increased p11 binding to cPLA2 (13Akiba S. Hatazawa R. Ono K. Hayama M. Matsui H. Sato T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 1004-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 14Akiba S. Hatazawa R. Ono K. Kitatani K. Hayama M. Sato T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21854-21862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our results were similar to those reported by Akiba et al. (13Akiba S. Hatazawa R. Ono K. Hayama M. Matsui H. Sato T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 1004-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 14Akiba S. Hatazawa R. Ono K. Kitatani K. Hayama M. Sato T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21854-21862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have demonstrated that EGF induces p11 production through EGF activation of the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase and activation of p44/42, p38, and cPLA2."

https://openalex.org/W2320760697,"LINE-1 are endogenous mobile genetic elements that have dispersed and accumulated in the genomes of eukaryotes via germline transposition, with up to 100 000 copies in mammalian genomes. LINE-1 elements transpose by reverse transcription of their own transcript. Transposition requires synthesis of a full-length, sense-strand transcripts and proteins encoded by open reading frame (ORF) 1 and ORF2. Although severely repressed in most normal tissues, LINE-1 occasionally leads to disease by insertional mutagenesis. In the present study, Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses revealed a template-strand transcription of LINE-1 ORF2 (encoding reverse transcriptase, RT) in lymphoid organs and the liver from MRL-+/+ and Fas-deficient MRL/lpr strains and their normal ancestors. While these sense transcripts are restricted to the nucleus in hepatocytes, they are also found in the cytoplasm in splenocytes. In contrast to transcription, ORF2 translation was detected only in MRL strains, as shown by the cytoplasmic labelling of splenic cells obtained with a monoclonal antibody recognizing the LINE-1 RT. This antibody coprecipitated two proteins of 45 and 12 kDa from MRL/lpr lymphoid organ lysates that were removed by pretreatment with anti-β2-microglobulin antiserum, suggesting a structural association between a LINE-1 product and a major histocompatibility complex class I or class I-like molecule."

It belongs to the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) superfamily, which oxidizes a wide variety of aldehydes into nonactivated or SCoA-activated acidic compounds (1Lindahl R. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 27: 283-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 2Vasiliou V. Pappa A. Petersen D.R. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2000; 129: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 3Vasiliou V.

These enzymes play parts at several levels of cellular metabolism including anabolic and catabolic pathways, detoxification processes, and embryogenesis development. Their numerous functions probably explain why most ALDHs show a wide substrate specificity, except for the CoA-dependent ALDH. In mammals, ALDH class 1 shows preference for retinal but it can also oxidize aromatic and “long-chain” aldehydes with dissimilar catalytic efficiencies, whereas ALDHs that belong to class 2 are more specific for acetaldehyde and short-chain aldehydes (4Klyosov A.A.

Therefore, characterizing the molecular and structural factors involved in substrate specificity is important for a better understanding of the efficiency of the catalytic event and of the evolution of the active sites of ALDHs.Unlike most ALDHs, GAPN is an ALDH for which the physiological substrate is known. The fact that GAPN shows high catalytic efficiency toward d-G3P implies prerequisites with respect to the chemical mechanism. Previous enzymatic and structural studies of GAPN from Streptococcus mutans have shown that NADP binding induces a local conformational rearrangement. As a consequence, the thiol of Cys-302 becomes accessible, its pK appshifts from 8.5 to 6.2, and it is now well positioned to subsequently form a competent thiohemiacetal intermediate. On the other hand, the side chains of Glu-268 and Arg-459 also rotate and then do not interact with each other anymore. The side chain of Arg-459 is now orientated toward the substrate binding site. Glu-268 now has a pK app that shifts from probably 5.7 in the apo structure to 7.6 in the holo form and has its side chain well positioned for subsequently activating the water molecule involved in hydrolysis of the thioacyl intermediate. During this rearrangement, the distance between Glu-268 and Cys-302 passes from 7.6 to 3.6 Å. Concomitantly, the oxyanion hole, composed of at least the amide side chain of Asn-169 and the NH main chain of Cys-302, is formed. Its role is to stabilize the tetrahedral transition states formed during acylation and deacylation steps. This local conformational change has been shown to be strongly favored by binding of d-G3P to the binary complex GAPN·NADP (14Marchal S. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12950-15958Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 15Cobessi D. Tête-Favier F. Marchal S. Branlant G. Aubry A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 16Marchal S. Rahuel-Clermont S. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3327-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Whereas the rate-limiting step of GAPN is deacylation, that of human liver mitochondrial ALDH has been shown to depend on the chemical structure of the aldehyde substrate (17Ni L. Sheikh S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18823-188236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the nature of the substrate can modulate the formation of a competent ternary complex.This justifies the determination of the structural factors that are implied in the catalytic efficiency of GAPNs. Several crystal structures of GAPN from S. mutans have been described so far (15Cobessi D. Tête-Favier F. Marchal S. Branlant G. Aubry A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 18Cobessi D. Tête-Favier F. Marchal S. Azza S. Branlant G. Aubry A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The apo1 structure shows a sulfate anion, called SO4a, which probably corresponds to the C-3 phosphate of G3P. Arg-124 and Arg-301, which are located in an α-helix and within a loop, respectively, interact with SO4a via their guanidinium groups. Arg-459, which is located within a loop, also interacts with SO4a but via its NH main chain. The apo2 structure shows a second sulfate anion, called SO4b, which probably mimics the tetrahedral transition states involved in acylation and deacylation. Guanidinium groups of Arg-301 and Arg-459 interact with SO4b. SO4b is also in interaction with the Asn-169 amide group, the Cys-302 and Thr-303 main chain NH, and the Thr-303 hydroxyl group, which in turn also interacts with SO4a. Inspection of the structure of the ternary complex C302S-NADP-G3P supports the potential roles of Arg-124, Arg-301, Arg-459, and Thr-303 in d-G3P oxidation process but also of the hydroxyl of Tyr-170, which forms a hydrogen bond with the oxygen that bridges the carbon chain to the phosphate in d-G3P. On the basis of sequence comparison of GAPNs to those of other ALDHs (Fig.1) only Arg-124, Arg-301, Arg-459, and Tyr-170 seem to be specific to GAPNs. Here, Arg-124 and Arg-301 were substituted by leucine, and Arg-459 and Tyr-170 were changed into isoleucine and phenylalanine, respectively. The catalytic properties of these GAPN mutants were determined. Altogether, the results suggest that Tyr-170 has no significant role, Arg-124 participates only ind-G3P binding via interaction with C-3 phosphate, and both Arg-301 and Arg-459 are not only involved in d-G3P binding but also participate in positioning efficiently the substrate with respect to Cys-302 within the ternary complex GAPN·NADP·d-G3P.DISCUSSIONGAPN belongs to the ALDH family. It is one of the ALDHs whose properties have been the most studied at both the structural and enzymatic levels. The fact that all of these studies were carried out with the physiological substrate d-G3P is also a guarantee of the generality of the interpretations of the results. Taking into account all of the enzymatic and structural data available so far, a scenario of the catalytic mechanism of GAPN from S. mutanscan be described as presented in the Introduction. As shown, the binding of NADP to apo-GAPN induces a local conformational change of the active site with at least a reorientation of side chains of Cys-302, Glu-268, and Arg-459. The rate of the conformational change upon cofactor binding has a maximal k obs value of 4.7 × 10−4 s−1 at acidic pH, which is not compatible with the k ac andk cat values (14Marchal S. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12950-15958Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The fact that addingd-G3P increases the rate of the reorganization by a factor of at least 105-fold (14Marchal S. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12950-15958Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) 6S. Marchal and G. Branlant, unpublished results. indicates thatd-G3P binding to the binary complex GAPN·NADP strongly favors the active site reorganization. Therefore, characterizing the structural factors involved in d-G3P binding could help to a better understanding of the catalysis and of the evolution of the substrate binding sites of ALDHs. As presented in the Introduction, four residues seem to be conserved in the GAPN family (i.e.Arg-124, Tyr-170, Arg-301, and Arg-459) and could be involved in the recognition of d-G3P and/or in catalysis.Substituting Arg-124 with leucine does not change the nature of 1) the rate-limiting step, which remains deacylation, and 2) the rate-determining step in acylation, which remains hydride transfer. Moreover, no significant effect is observed on acylation and deacylation rates. Therefore, these results exclude a role of the guanidinium group of Arg-124 in stabilizing the transition states associated with hydride transfer and involved in hydrolysis. Only an increase in K m is observed in both acylation and deacylation steps but with a more pronounced effect in the latter step. Therefore, the only role of Arg-124 is to stabilize the binding of G3P via an interaction between the guanidinium group and the phosphate at C-3. This is in accord with the structure of 1) the ternary complex C302S·NADP·d-G3P in which the guanidinium group of Arg-124 interacts with one of the oxygens of the phosphate and 2) the apo2 form in which the guanidinium group interacts with one of the oxygens of the anion SO4a that is postulated to mimic the phosphate of d-G3P. The fact that the pK app of Cys-302 within the acylation complex remains similar to that observed in wild type indicates no role of Arg-124 in activating Cys-302. Again, this is in accord with the x-ray structure of apo2 GAPN, which shows a distance between both residues higher than 12 Å.The situation is different for the Y170F mutant GAPN protein. No major effect is observed in the K m values ford-G3P and in the rates of both acylation and deacylation steps. Therefore, although the hydroxyl group of Tyr-170 within the ternary complex C302S·NADP·d-G3P has been shown to be at a hydrogen bonding distance of the oxygen that connects the C-3 carbon to the phosphate in d-G3P, the interaction seems not to be essential for d-G3P binding. The fact that, in some archeal GAPNs, Tyr-170 is replaced by a phenylalanine supports the present results (Fig. 1).The behavior of the R459I mutant GAPN protein is very different. With this, the acylation process becomes rate-limiting with a limiting step prior to hydride transfer. The efficiency of the acylation step is strongly decreased by at least a factor of 105, which includes both a K m and ak ac contributions. From different approaches,i.e. using kinetic probes like 2PDS and the Ab333 or tracing the pH rate profile of acylation and of Ab333 appearance, it has been possible to determine the pK app of Cys-302. Whatever the approaches, a pK app of 6.6–6.7 is found within either the holo form or the ternary complex. Therefore, the guanidinium group of Arg-459, which is situated 5.7 Å from Cys-302 in the apo2 structure appears to participate directly or indirectly in lowering the pK app of Cys-302 by 0.5 pH units. However, the 0.5-unit increase in pK app could not explain the drastic decrease in k ac. In fact, as shown by using 2PDS probe, Cys-302 is at least 2 × 103-fold less reactive within the R459I holo form than within the holo wild type. Thus, Cys-302 has little accessibility in the R459I holo form. Therefore, it is probable that the location of the side chain of Cys-302 is not optimal and then necessitates a local reorganization for forming a competent ternary complex with d-G3P that could be rate-limiting. Several data favor this assumption. First, the Ab333 is not observed in holo wild type. This supports a relative positioning of Cys-302 and of the nicotinamide ring of NADP in R459I mutant different from that of wild type. Second, pH dependence of Ab333 of R459I mutant depends on Cys-302 pK app but not on Glu-268 pK app. This is an indication of a relative positioning of Cys-302 and Glu-268 in the R459I holo form different from that observed in competent holo wild type in which the distance between the side chains of Cys-302 and Glu-268 is around 3.6 Å. As seen from the inspection of the apo2 structure of GAPN, Arg-459 main chain NH interacts with the SO4a, which is representative of the phosphate of d-G3P, whereas guanidinium side chain interacts with SO4b, which probably mimics the sp3 transition states. Arg-459 interacts also with Gln-455, which is a residue conserved in almost all GAPNs. Therefore, substituting Arg-459 by isoleucine can also modify the conformation of the loop on which Arg-459 is located. Together, this is in accord with the data of the present study, which shows that substituting Arg-459 by isoleucine has not only a destabilizing K m effect for d-G3P but also a strong kinetic effect, which reflects a Michaelis ternary complex that seems to be inefficient for forming the thiohemiacetal intermediate ternary complex.The role of Arg-301 is more difficult to comprehend in detail due the very low catalytic efficiency of R301L mutant GAPN protein. As with the R459I mutant, the rate-limiting step is associated with acylation, more precisely prior to hydride transfer, and a high K mvalue for d-G3P and a low k ac value are observed. Taking into account the apo2 structure of GAPN, which shows an interaction of Arg-301 guanidinium side chain with both the SO4a and SO4b, it is probable that substituting Arg-301 by leucine should destabilize d-G3P binding but at the same time perturb the relative positioning of d-G3P and of Cys-302 within the ternary complex. Consequently, this would prevent an efficient attack of the thiolate group toward the aldehydic group.GAPN from S. mutans reduces efficiently d andl isomers of G3P (16Marchal S. Rahuel-Clermont S. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3327-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, Arg-301 and Arg-459 are probably not involved in G3P stereospecificity. This suggests that both arginines do not interact selectively with the C-2 moiety ofd-G3P. This is also supported by the observation that both residues are conserved in GAPNs from plants which are described to reduce only d isomer (22Gomez Casati D.F. Sesma J.I. Iglesias A.A. Plant Sci. 2000; 154: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, as supported by the present study, one major role of Arg-301 and Arg-459 would be to position efficiently the d-G3P with respect to Cys-302 within the Michaelis ternary complex. This would favor the formation of the thiohemiacetal intermediate and consequently the efficiency of the hydride transfer. During this part of the catalytic event, the geometry at the C-1 carbon changes from sp2 to sp3 and reveals the role of Asn-169. Now, the negative charge of the oxygen of the thiohemiacetal intermediate is stabilized by the oxyanion site, which is composed at least of the amide side chain of Asn-169. This is in accord with previous studies, which showed that mutating Asn-169 results in a drastic decrease of the hydride transfer rate but has no effect on K m value for d-G3P (15Cobessi D. Tête-Favier F. Marchal S. Branlant G. Aubry A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Nonphosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPN)1 catalyzes the irreversible oxidation of d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (d-G3P) into 3-phosphoglycerate in the presence of NADP via a two-step chemical mechanism. It belongs to the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) superfamily, which oxidizes a wide variety of aldehydes into nonactivated or SCoA-activated acidic compounds (1Lindahl R. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 27: 283-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 2Vasiliou V. Pappa A. Petersen D.R. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2000; 129: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 3Vasiliou V.

Therefore, characterizing the molecular and structural factors involved in substrate specificity is important for a better understanding of the efficiency of the catalytic event and of the evolution of the active sites of ALDHs. Unlike most ALDHs, GAPN is an ALDH for which the physiological substrate is known. The fact that GAPN shows high catalytic efficiency toward d-G3P implies prerequisites with respect to the chemical mechanism. Previous enzymatic and structural studies of GAPN from Streptococcus mutans have shown that NADP binding induces a local conformational rearrangement. As a consequence, the thiol of Cys-302 becomes accessible, its pK appshifts from 8.5 to 6.2, and it is now well positioned to subsequently form a competent thiohemiacetal intermediate. On the other hand, the side chains of Glu-268 and Arg-459 also rotate and then do not interact with each other anymore. The side chain of Arg-459 is now orientated toward the substrate binding site. Glu-268 now has a pK app that shifts from probably 5.7 in the apo structure to 7.6 in the holo form and has its side chain well positioned for subsequently activating the water molecule involved in hydrolysis of the thioacyl intermediate. During this rearrangement, the distance between Glu-268 and Cys-302 passes from 7.6 to 3.6 Å. Concomitantly, the oxyanion hole, composed of at least the amide side chain of Asn-169 and the NH main chain of Cys-302, is formed. Its role is to stabilize the tetrahedral transition states formed during acylation and deacylation steps. This local conformational change has been shown to be strongly favored by binding of d-G3P to the binary complex GAPN·NADP (14Marchal S. Branlant G.

Whereas the rate-limiting step of GAPN is deacylation, that of human liver mitochondrial ALDH has been shown to depend on the chemical structure of the aldehyde substrate (17Ni L. Sheikh S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18823-188236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the nature of the substrate can modulate the formation of a competent ternary complex. This justifies the determination of the structural factors that are implied in the catalytic efficiency of GAPNs. Several crystal structures of GAPN from S. mutans have been described so far (15Cobessi D. Tête-Favier F. Marchal S. Branlant G. Aubry A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 18Cobessi D. Tête-Favier F. Marchal S. Azza S. Branlant G. Aubry A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The apo1 structure shows a sulfate anion, called SO4a, which probably corresponds to the C-3 phosphate of G3P. Arg-124 and Arg-301, which are located in an α-helix and within a loop, respectively, interact with SO4a via their guanidinium groups. Arg-459, which is located within a loop, also interacts with SO4a but via its NH main chain. The apo2 structure shows a second sulfate anion, called SO4b, which probably mimics the tetrahedral transition states involved in acylation and deacylation. Guanidinium groups of Arg-301 and Arg-459 interact with SO4b. SO4b is also in interaction with the Asn-169 amide group, the Cys-302 and Thr-303 main chain NH, and the Thr-303 hydroxyl group, which in turn also interacts with SO4a. Inspection of the structure of the ternary complex C302S-NADP-G3P supports the potential roles of Arg-124, Arg-301, Arg-459, and Thr-303 in d-G3P oxidation process but also of the hydroxyl of Tyr-170, which forms a hydrogen bond with the oxygen that bridges the carbon chain to the phosphate in d-G3P. On the basis of sequence comparison of GAPNs to those of other ALDHs (Fig.1) only Arg-124, Arg-301, Arg-459, and Tyr-170 seem to be specific to GAPNs. Here, Arg-124 and Arg-301 were substituted by leucine, and Arg-459 and Tyr-170 were changed into isoleucine and phenylalanine, respectively. The catalytic properties of these GAPN mutants were determined. Altogether, the results suggest that Tyr-170 has no significant role, Arg-124 participates only ind-G3P binding via interaction with C-3 phosphate, and both Arg-301 and Arg-459 are not only involved in d-G3P binding but also participate in positioning efficiently the substrate with respect to Cys-302 within the ternary complex GAPN·NADP·d-G3P. DISCUSSIONGAPN belongs to the ALDH family. It is one of the ALDHs whose properties have been the most studied at both the structural and enzymatic levels. The fact that all of these studies were carried out with the physiological substrate d-G3P is also a guarantee of the generality of the interpretations of the results. Taking into account all of the enzymatic and structural data available so far, a scenario of the catalytic mechanism of GAPN from S. mutanscan be described as presented in the Introduction. As shown, the binding of NADP to apo-GAPN induces a local conformational change of the active site with at least a reorientation of side chains of Cys-302, Glu-268, and Arg-459. The rate of the conformational change upon cofactor binding has a maximal k obs value of 4.7 × 10−4 s−1 at acidic pH, which is not compatible with the k ac andk cat values (14Marchal S. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12950-15958Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The fact that addingd-G3P increases the rate of the reorganization by a factor of at least 105-fold (14Marchal S. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12950-15958Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) 6S. Marchal and G. Branlant, unpublished results. indicates thatd-G3P binding to the binary complex GAPN·NADP strongly favors the active site reorganization. Therefore, characterizing the structural factors involved in d-G3P binding could help to a better understanding of the catalysis and of the evolution of the substrate binding sites of ALDHs. As presented in the Introduction, four residues seem to be conserved in the GAPN family (i.e.Arg-124, Tyr-170, Arg-301, and Arg-459) and could be involved in the recognition of d-G3P and/or in catalysis.Substituting Arg-124 with leucine does not change the nature of 1) the rate-limiting step, which remains deacylation, and 2) the rate-determining step in acylation, which remains hydride transfer. Moreover, no significant effect is observed on acylation and deacylation rates. Therefore, these results exclude a role of the guanidinium group of Arg-124 in stabilizing the transition states associated with hydride transfer and involved in hydrolysis. Only an increase in K m is observed in both acylation and deacylation steps but with a more pronounced effect in the latter step. Therefore, the only role of Arg-124 is to stabilize the binding of G3P via an interaction between the guanidinium group and the phosphate at C-3. This is in accord with the structure of 1) the ternary complex C302S·NADP·d-G3P in which the guanidinium group of Arg-124 interacts with one of the oxygens of the phosphate and 2) the apo2 form in which the guanidinium group interacts with one of the oxygens of the anion SO4a that is postulated to mimic the phosphate of d-G3P. The fact that the pK app of Cys-302 within the acylation complex remains similar to that observed in wild type indicates no role of Arg-124 in activating Cys-302. Again, this is in accord with the x-ray structure of apo2 GAPN, which shows a distance between both residues higher than 12 Å.The situation is different for the Y170F mutant GAPN protein. No major effect is observed in the K m values ford-G3P and in the rates of both acylation and deacylation steps. Therefore, although the hydroxyl group of Tyr-170 within the ternary complex C302S·NADP·d-G3P has been shown to be at a hydrogen bonding distance of the oxygen that connects the C-3 carbon to the phosphate in d-G3P, the interaction seems not to be essential for d-G3P binding. The fact that, in some archeal GAPNs, Tyr-170 is replaced by a phenylalanine supports the present results (Fig. 1).The behavior of the R459I mutant GAPN protein is very different. With this, the acylation process becomes rate-limiting with a limiting step prior to hydride transfer. The efficiency of the acylation step is strongly decreased by at least a factor of 105, which includes both a K m and ak ac contributions. From different approaches,i.e. using kinetic probes like 2PDS and the Ab333 or tracing the pH rate profile of acylation and of Ab333 appearance, it has been possible to determine the pK app of Cys-302. Whatever the approaches, a pK app of 6.6–6.7 is found within either the holo form or the ternary complex. Therefore, the guanidinium group of Arg-459, which is situated 5.7 Å from Cys-302 in the apo2 structure appears to participate directly or indirectly in lowering the pK app of Cys-302 by 0.5 pH units. However, the 0.5-unit increase in pK app could not explain the drastic decrease in k ac. In fact, as shown by using 2PDS probe, Cys-302 is at least 2 × 103-fold less reactive within the R459I holo form than within the holo wild type. Thus, Cys-302 has little accessibility in the R459I holo form. Therefore, it is probable that the location of the side chain of Cys-302 is not optimal and then necessitates a local reorganization for forming a competent ternary complex with d-G3P that could be rate-limiting. Several data favor this assumption. First, the Ab333 is not observed in holo wild type. This supports a relative positioning of Cys-302 and of the nicotinamide ring of NADP in R459I mutant different from that of wild type. Second, pH dependence of Ab333 of R459I mutant depends on Cys-302 pK app but not on Glu-268 pK app. This is an indication of a relative positioning of Cys-302 and Glu-268 in the R459I holo form different from that observed in competent holo wild type in which the distance between the side chains of Cys-302 and Glu-268 is around 3.6 Å. As seen from the inspection of the apo2 structure of GAPN, Arg-459 main chain NH interacts with the SO4a, which is representative of the phosphate of d-G3P, whereas guanidinium side chain interacts with SO4b, which probably mimics the sp3 transition states. Arg-459 interacts also with Gln-455, which is a residue conserved in almost all GAPNs. Therefore, substituting Arg-459 by isoleucine can also modify the conformation of the loop on which Arg-459 is located. Together, this is in accord with the data of the present study, which shows that substituting Arg-459 by isoleucine has not only a destabilizing K m effect for d-G3P but also a strong kinetic effect, which reflects a Michaelis ternary complex that seems to be inefficient for forming the thiohemiacetal intermediate ternary complex.The role of Arg-301 is more difficult to comprehend in detail due the very low catalytic efficiency of R301L mutant GAPN protein. As with the R459I mutant, the rate-limiting step is associated with acylation, more precisely prior to hydride transfer, and a high K mvalue for d-G3P and a low k ac value are observed. Taking into account the apo2 structure of GAPN, which shows an interaction of Arg-301 guanidinium side chain with both the SO4a and SO4b, it is probable that substituting Arg-301 by leucine should destabilize d-G3P binding but at the same time perturb the relative positioning of d-G3P and of Cys-302 within the ternary complex. Consequently, this would prevent an efficient attack of the thiolate group toward the aldehydic group.GAPN from S. mutans reduces efficiently d andl isomers of G3P (16Marchal S. Rahuel-Clermont S. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3327-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, Arg-301 and Arg-459 are probably not involved in G3P stereospecificity. This suggests that both arginines do not interact selectively with the C-2 moiety ofd-G3P. This is also supported by the observation that both residues are conserved in GAPNs from plants which are described to reduce only d isomer (22Gomez Casati D.F. Sesma J.I. Iglesias A.A. Plant Sci. 2000; 154: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, as supported by the present study, one major role of Arg-301 and Arg-459 would be to position efficiently the d-G3P with respect to Cys-302 within the Michaelis ternary complex. This would favor the formation of the thiohemiacetal intermediate and consequently the efficiency of the hydride transfer. During this part of the catalytic event, the geometry at the C-1 carbon changes from sp2 to sp3 and reveals the role of Asn-169. Now, the negative charge of the oxygen of the thiohemiacetal intermediate is stabilized by the oxyanion site, which is composed at least of the amide side chain of Asn-169. This is in accord with previous studies, which showed that mutating Asn-169 results in a drastic decrease of the hydride transfer rate but has no effect on K m value for d-G3P (15Cobessi D. Tête-Favier F. Marchal S. Branlant G. Aubry A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). GAPN belongs to the ALDH family.

Only an increase in K m is observed in both acylation and deacylation steps but with a more pronounced effect in the latter step. Therefore, the only role of Arg-124 is to stabilize the binding of G3P via an interaction between the guanidinium group and the phosphate at C-3. This is in accord with the structure of 1) the ternary complex C302S·NADP·d-G3P in which the guanidinium group of Arg-124 interacts with one of the oxygens of the phosphate and 2) the apo2 form in which the guanidinium group interacts with one of the oxygens of the anion SO4a that is postulated to mimic the phosphate of d-G3P.

No major effect is observed in the K m values ford-G3P and in the rates of both acylation and deacylation steps. Therefore, although the hydroxyl group of Tyr-170 within the ternary complex C302S·NADP·d-G3P has been shown to be at a hydrogen bonding distance of the oxygen that connects the C-3 carbon to the phosphate in d-G3P, the interaction seems not to be essential for d-G3P binding.

Therefore, it is probable that the location of the side chain of Cys-302 is not optimal and then necessitates a local reorganization for forming a competent ternary complex with d-G3P that could be rate-limiting. Several data favor this assumption. First, the Ab333 is not observed in holo wild type. This supports a relative positioning of Cys-302 and of the nicotinamide ring of NADP in R459I mutant different from that of wild type. Second, pH dependence of Ab333 of R459I mutant depends on Cys-302 pK app but not on Glu-268 pK app. This is an indication of a relative positioning of Cys-302 and Glu-268 in the R459I holo form different from that observed in competent holo wild type in which the distance between the side chains of Cys-302 and Glu-268 is around 3.6 Å. As seen from the inspection of the apo2 structure of GAPN, Arg-459 main chain NH interacts with the SO4a, which is representative of the phosphate of d-G3P, whereas guanidinium side chain interacts with SO4b, which probably mimics the sp3 transition states. Arg-459 interacts also with Gln-455, which is a residue conserved in almost all GAPNs. Therefore, substituting Arg-459 by isoleucine can also modify the conformation of the loop on which Arg-459 is located. Together, this is in accord with the data of the present study, which shows that substituting Arg-459 by isoleucine has not only a destabilizing K m effect for d-G3P but also a strong kinetic effect, which reflects a Michaelis ternary complex that seems to be inefficient for forming the thiohemiacetal intermediate ternary complex. The role of Arg-301 is more difficult to comprehend in detail due the very low catalytic efficiency of R301L mutant GAPN protein. As with the R459I mutant, the rate-limiting step is associated with acylation, more precisely prior to hydride transfer, and a high K mvalue for d-G3P and a low k ac value are observed. Taking into account the apo2 structure of GAPN, which shows an interaction of Arg-301 guanidinium side chain with both the SO4a and SO4b, it is probable that substituting Arg-301 by leucine should destabilize d-G3P binding but at the same time perturb the relative positioning of d-G3P and of Cys-302 within the ternary complex. Consequently, this would prevent an efficient attack of the thiolate group toward the aldehydic group. GAPN from S. mutans reduces efficiently d andl isomers of G3P (16Marchal S. Rahuel-Clermont S.
