https://openalex.org/W2064325362,"Observations of intermolecular excimers in several pi-conjugated polymers and exciplexes of these polymers with tris(p-tolyl) amine are reported. It is shown that the luminescence of conjugated polymer thin films originates from excimer emission and that the generally low quantum yield is the result of self-quenching. Thus, in sufficiently dilute solution, the ""single-chain"" emission has a quantum yield of unity. Exciplex luminescence and exciplex-mediated charge photogeneration have much higher quantum yields than the excimer-mediated photophysical processes. These results provide a basis for understanding and controlling the photophysics of conjugated polymers in terms of supramolecular structure and morphology."
https://openalex.org/W1992987784,A multiple page fully digital holographic data storage system is demonstrated. This system is used to store and retrieve digital image and compressed video data with a photorefractive crystal. Architecture issues related to spatio-rotational multiplexing and novel error-correcting encoding techniques used to achieve low bit-error rates are discussed.
https://openalex.org/W1964044437,Oleanane has been reported in Upper Cretaceous and Tertiary source rocks and their related oils and has been suggested as a marker for flowering plants. Correspondence of oleanane concentrations relative to the ubiquitous microbial marker 17alpha-hopane with angiosperm diversification (Neocomian to Miocene) suggests that oleanane concentrations in migrated petroleum can be used to identify the maximum age of unknown or unavailable source rock. Rare occurrences of pre-Cretaceous oleanane suggest either that a separate lineage leads to the angiosperms well before the Early Cretaceous or that other plant groups have the rarely expressed ability to synthesize oleanane precursors.
https://openalex.org/W2073173414,"A rational method for constructing highly oriented films of purple membrane (PM) has been established by using two kinds of bispecific antibodies with different antigen-binding sites, one binding to a specific side of bacteriorhodopsin and the other to a phospholipid hapten. A hapten monolayer deposited on a metal electrode was treated with a bispecific antibody solution and incubated with a PM suspension to produce a highly oriented PM film, as confirmed by electron microscopy in which an immunogold labeling technique was used. This antibody-mediated PM monolayer was then used in the construction of a light-sensing photoelectric device. A comparison of the two incorporated PM monolayers showed that highly efficient photocurrents were produced by the PM monolayer whose unidirectionally oriented cytoplasmic surface faces the electrode."

https://openalex.org/W2017385173,"The time history of energy release during earthquakes illuminates the process of failure, which remains enigmatic for events deeper than about 100 kilometers. Stacks of teleseismic records from regional arrays for 122 intermediate (depths of 100 to 350 kilometers) and deep (depths of 350 to 700 kilometers) earthquakes show that the temporal pattern of short-period seismic radiation has a systematic variation with depth. On average, for intermediate depth events more radiation is released toward the beginning of the rupture than near the end, whereas for deep events radiation is released symmetrically over the duration of the event, with an abrupt beginning and end of rupture. These findings suggest a variation in the style of rupture related to decreasing fault heterogeneity with depth."
https://openalex.org/W2089217777,"Two electrons in two weakly coupled orbitals give rise to two states (diradical) with electrons residing in separate orbitals and two states (zwitterionic) with both electrons paired in one orbital or the other. This two-electron, two-orbital state manifold has eluded experimental confirmation because the zwitterionic states have been difficult to locate. Two-photon excitation of fluorescence from Mo2CI4(PMe3)4 (D2d) has been measured with linearly and circularly polarized light. From the polarization ratio and the energy of the observed transition, the 21A1 (δ*δ*) excited state has been located and characterized. In conjunction with the one-photon allowed 1B2 (δδ*) excited state, the zwitterionic state manifold for the quadruply bonded metal-metal class of compounds is thus established."

Single values cannot characterize host-parasitoid interactions, and maximum values are unlikely to be typical over longer times or in different areas (4). 4) Contrary to the prediction made by Hawkins et al., successful biological control can result from the use of agents that are characterized by low rates of parasitization in their native habitat (5). Natural enemies that are rare in their native habitat may have superior potential as control agents when released in exotic habitats (6). 5) Hawkins et al. attribute seven cases of high parasitization (above 60%) in unsuccessful biological control projects to climatic mist,natch between parasitoids and hosts. We question how such high rates of parasitization could be achieved if clima tic factors reduce parasitoid reproduction, survivorship, or host synchrony ... (1, p. 1431). Variation in the susceptibility of insects to predators, parasitoids, and disease is important. Mechanisms for encapsulating parasitoids, hiding from predators, and resisting disease influence the impacts of natural enemies in native and exotic habitats, but measuring refuge size from the observed maximum parasitization of successful biological control programs does not yield new understanding or predictability to the practice of biological control. 1.
