https://openalex.org/W2011174702,We have induced and controlled normal aggregation of Dictyostelium discoideum amoebas by electrophoretic release of pulses of cyclic adenosine monophosphate from a microelectrode. This has yielded information about the sequence of development of aggregation competences during interphase. We believe that modifications of the technique will have wide application in investigations of other developing systems.
https://openalex.org/W2004114808,"At orbit insertion on 14 November 1971 the Martian surface was largely obscured by a dust haze with an extinction optical depth that ranged from near unity in the south polar region to probably greater than 2 over most of the planet. The only features clearly visible were the south polar cap, one dark, spot in Nix Olympica, and three dark spots in the Tharsis region. During the third week the atmosphere began to clear and surface visibility improved, but contrasts remained a fraction of their normal value. Each of the dark spots that apparently protrude through most of the dust-filled atmosphere has a crater or crater complex in its center. The craters are rimless and have featureless floors that, in the crater complexes, are at different levels. The largest crater within the southernmost spot is approximately 100 kilometers wide. The craters apparently were formed by subsidence and resemble terrestrial calderas. The south polar cap has a regular margin, suggesting very flat topography. Two craters outside the cap have frost on their floors; an apparent crater rim within the cap is frost free, indicating preferential loss of frost from elevated ground. If this is so then the curvilinear streaks, which were frost covered in 1969 and are now clear of frost, may be low-relief ridges. Closeup pictures of Phobos and Deimos show that Phobos is about 25 ± 5 by 21 ± 1 kilometers and Deimos is about 13.5 ± 2 by 12.0 ± 0.5 kilometers. Both have irregular shapes and are highly cratered, with some craters showing raised rims. The satellites are dark objects with geometric albedos of 0.05."
https://openalex.org/W1977783833,"The Mariner 9 infrared spectroscopy experiment has provided good-quality spectra of many areas of Mars, predominantly in the southern hemisphere. Large portions of the thermal emission spectra are significantly affected by dust with a silicon oxide content approximately corresponding to that of an intermediate igneous rock, thus implying that Mars has undergone substantial geochemical differentiation. Derived temperature profiles indicate a warm daytime upper atmosphere with a strong warming over the south polar cap. Atmospheric water vapor is clearly observed over the south polar area and less strongly over other regions."
https://openalex.org/W2056989947,The principle of freezing-out has been adapted for the quantitative concentration of small or large volumes of dilute solutions. Mechanical stirring is an essential part of the process. The method should prove of greatest value where volatile or heat-labile substances are to be concentrated and is applicable to solutions in certain organic solvents as well as to aqueous solutions.
https://openalex.org/W1993598362,"The ultraviolet airglow spectrum of Mars has been measured from an orbiting spacecraft during a 30-day period in November-December 1971. The emission rates of the carbon monoxide Cameron and fourth positive bands, the atomic oxygen 1304-angstrom line and the atomic hydrogen 1216-angstrom line have been measured as a function of altitude. Significant variations in the scale height of the CO Cameron band airglow have been observed during a period of variable solar activity; however, the atomic oxygen and hydrogen airglow lines are present during all the observations. Measurements of the reflectance of the lower atmosphere of Mars show the spectral characteristics of particle scattering and a magnitude that is about 50 percent of that measured during the Mariner 6 and 7 experiments in 1969. The variation of reflectance across the planet may be represented by a model in which the dominant scatterer is dust that absorbs in the ultraviolet and has an optical depth greater than 1. The atmosphere above the polar region is clearer than over the rest of the planet."
https://openalex.org/W2074221873,Cave-adapted arthropods have evolved in lava tubes in Hawaii. This is the first report of cavernicoles from the Hawaiian islands. The specialization of the cavernicolous insects and the recent origin of the lava tubes suggest that subterranean connections between lava tubes regularly occur and provide dispersal routes. The discovery that lava tubes were colonized by representatives of the adaptively radiating native fauna offers significant potential for evolutionary studies.
https://openalex.org/W2085285980,"Analysis of the Mariner 9 radio-tracking data shows that the Martian gravity field is rougher than that of Earth or the moon, and that the accepted direction of Mars's rotation axis is in error by about 0.5 degrees . The new value for the pole direction for the epoch 1971.9, referred to the mean equatorial system of 1950.0, is right ascension alpha= 317.3 degrees +/- 0.3 degrees , declination delta = 52.6 degrees +/- 0.2 degrees . The values found for the coefficients of the low-order harmonics of Mars's gravity field are as follows: J(2)=(1.96+/-0.01)x10(-3), referred to an equatorial radius of 3394 kilometers; C(22) = -(5 +/- 1) x 10(-5); and S(22) = (3 +/- 1) x 10(-5). The value for J(2) is in excellent agreement with the result from, Wilkins' analysis of the observations of Phobos. The other two coefficients imply a value of (2.5 +/- 0.5) x 10(-4) for the fractional difference in the principal equatorial moments of inertia; the axis of the minimum moment passes near 105 degrees W."
https://openalex.org/W2084821818,"A preliminary analysis of 15 radio occultation measurements taken on the day side of Mars between 40°S and 33°S has revealed that the temperature in the lower 15 to 20 kilometers of the atmosphere of Mars is essentially isothermal and warmer than expected. This result, which is also confirmed by the increased altitude of the ionization peak of the ionosphere, can possibly be caused by the absorption of solar radiation by fine particles of dust suspended in the lower atmosphere. The measurements also revealed elevation differences of 13 kilometers and a range of surface pressures between 2.9 and 8.3 millibars. The floor of the classical bright area of Hellas was found to be about 6 kilometers below its western rim and 4 kilometers below the mean radius of Mars at that latitude. The region between Mare Sirenum and Solis Lacus was found to be relatively high, lying 5 to 8 kilometers above the mean radius. The maximum electron density in the ionosphere (about 1.5 × 10 5 electrons per cubic centimeter), which was found to be remarkably constant, was somewhat lower than that observed in 1969 but higher than that observed in 1965."
https://openalex.org/W2029936339,"The superoxide anion, generated electrolytically at a platinum electrode in buffered aqueous solution, was detected by its ability to cause the oxidation of epinephrine to adrenochrome. The rate of electrolytic oxidation of epinephrine varied with the applied potential in a manner reminiscent of an oxygen reduction half wave. This oxidation of epinephrine was dependent upon the presence of oxygen and was completely inhibitable by superoxide dismutase. It may be concluded that superoxide radicals, generated at the electrode, diffuse into the solution to an extent which allows reaction with small molecules such as epinephrine or with enzymes such as superoxide dismutase."
https://openalex.org/W1981940459,"Two samples of ocean water from the Pacific, one collected at the surface near the coast outside San Diego Bay in the summer of 1956 and the other taken at a depth of 3500 m from longitude 124 d 41.0' W, latitude 33 d 54.5' N on March 25, 1957, were analyzed for total thorium alpha activity. The method of analysis is described, and the results are tabulated. Some information concerning the approximate isotopic composition of the thorium which was isolated from the surface water sample was obtained by observing the change in its alpha activity with time. The observed activities and the calculated values are given and are in good agreement. (J.S.R.)"
https://openalex.org/W1993646110,"The current crisis in American archeology has been brought about by a combination of the greatly increased rate of destruction of unique, irreplaceable archeological information and material, and the lack of adequate funding for salvage of what is being destroyed. Since World War II, land alteration has increased almost geometrically. Land leveling, urban development, inexperienced or ignorant diggers, commercial dealers in Indian relics—these and many other agents of destruction are obliterating traces of the past. Anything that disturbs the ground where people once lived destroys forever whatever information is left about them and their way of life. Interpretations of man's cultural development through time, of his ability to cope with and use the environment wisely, and of a long, fascinating, and irreplaceable heritage are only possible if the evidence left in the ground is undisturbed and is properly recorded when it is excavated. The problem of the destruction of archeological sites and information is a complex one, with no single solution. A combination of increased support for archeological research through increased funding, and development of a knowledgeable, interested public will go a long way toward assuring this country that a significant portion of the past will be available for the benefit of future generations. If solutions are not sought and found now, it will be too late—we will have committed ourselves, irretrievably and irreversibly, to the future, without benefit or knowledge of the mistakes and the lessons of the past."

https://openalex.org/W2041878769,"The illegal antiquities market is financing the destruction of the remains of pre-Columbian civilization. In the United States, this process has often been aided by museums, collectors, and scholars who have unwittingly collaborated. Recently, initiatives toward reform have been taken by UNESCO, professional organizations, and two academic institutions. Further organized action is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W1998379401,The fluid flowing by the Nitella internode or squid giant axon loaded with radioactive cations was fractionated during the action potential. In this manner it was possible to ascertain the time course of efflux of these cation tracers during activity.
https://openalex.org/W2024405146,The brightness temperatures at 10 and 20 micrometers measured by the Mariner 9 infrared radiometer differ substantially from those predicted by the radiometer results of Mariners 6 and 7. The results indicate a significant latitude-dependent contribution of the atmospheric dust to the observed thermal emission.
https://openalex.org/W2031480322,"On the basis of data provided by the IR interferometer spectrometer on the Mariner 9 spacecraft, it is suggested that the composition of the Martian dust corresponds approximately to that of rocks of intermediate silicon dioxide content. The large dynamical pole flattening obtained from satellite observations has been confirmed by the Mariner 9 data."

https://openalex.org/W1999861829,"Carbon dioxide absorption on Mars was observed by Earth-based spectroscopy at 10,500 angstroms. Its abundance was equivalent to a partial pressure of 2.0 millibars instead of the normal 5.5 millibars. The dust layer was therefore opaque to a height of about 11 kilometers. On 10 December, a pressure of 5.8 millibars was found."
https://openalex.org/W1975469187,"Photoelectric spectra have been obtained for a number of early-type stars in the 1100- to 2000-angstrom region with the Mariner 9 ultraviolet spectrometer. The resonance lines of H I, Si IV, and C IV are easily identified, as are features due to C II, C III, Si III, Fe II, N IV. The absolute energy distribution derived from the data lie about 20 percent below those of OAO-2 in the 1200- to 2000-angstrom region."

https://openalex.org/W1974544439,Blue-stained balsam fir wood [Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.] consistently yielded cultures of a nonsporulating fungus which were found to be the same as those obtained from ascospores of Amphisphaeria thujina (Peck) Sacc. collected from dead branches of this host. This blue stain appears to be identical with a previously reported but hitherto unidentified stain of conifers. The association of Amphisphaeria with stain in living trees does not appear to have been recognized before.
