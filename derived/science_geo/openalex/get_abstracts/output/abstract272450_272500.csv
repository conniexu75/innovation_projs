https://openalex.org/W1990066428,"Colonies of the common planktonic green alga, Sphaerocystis schroeteri, are only partially disrupted and assimilated by Daphnia magna a natural predator. The Daphnia break up the outer protective gelatinous sheath that surrounds Sphaerocystis colonies, but most of the algal cells emerge from Daphnia guts intact and in viable condition. During gut passage, these viable cells take up nutrients, such as phosphorus, both from algal remains and from Daphnia metabolites. This nutrient supply stimulates algal carbon fixation and cell division. Enhanced algal growth, observed after gut passage, can compensate for the minor losses to the population caused by grazing. Nutrients regenerated by grazers may produce the summer bloom of gelatinous green algae during the seasonal succession of lake phytoplankton."

https://openalex.org/W2010763858,Male ring doves exhibit less courtship and more aggressive behavior toward females that have recently associated with other males than to females that have been isolated. The difference in response may be related to the differing probability of cuckoldry.
https://openalex.org/W1996020967,"By use of a new, highly selective detection technique for N-nitroso compounds, which is sensitive to picogram quantities and which is based on the catalytic cleavage of the N-NO bond and the subsequent detection of the nitrosyl radical, dimethylnitrosamine has been found in concentrations of 0.02 to 0.96 part per billion in three out of five air samples from Baltimore, Maryland, and 0.014 to 0.051 part per billion in five out of six air samples from Belle, West Virginia. The sensitivity of the analytical procedures used was 1 part in 10(12). The presence of dimethylnitrosamine has been confirmed by using the new detector in conjunction with both a gas-liquid chromatograph and a high-performance liquid chromatograph. In addition, between one and three as yet unidentified N-nitroso compounds were detected in both cities. N-Nitroso compounds were not found in air samples from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Wilmington, Delaware; and Waltham, Massachusetts."
https://openalex.org/W2002812109,"Ultrastructural observations of the phloem of coconut palms affected by ""hartrot"" disease in Suriname have revealed the presence of the plant-infecting flagellate Phytomonas in mature sieve tubes. The occurrence of these flagellates during the earliest symptoms of the disease and the correlated increase and spread of the flagellates in the phloem as the disease progresses suggest that the organisms may be pathogenic to the palms."
https://openalex.org/W2027000932,"Pervasive alteration is a common feature of metamict minerals. Previous studies of metamict niobium-tantalum-titanium oxides and electron microprobe analyses of altered areas in metamict yttrialite document the leaching of uranium, thorium, and rare earth elements. These data suggest that glasses may not provide a stable medium for radioactive waste disposal."

https://openalex.org/W3209802665,"Populations of planktonic foraminiferal species and phenotypes, distinguished on the basis of color and coiling direction, reach maximum average test sizes in their regions of optimum development. Therefore, tropical species are largest in tropical waters, while polar species are largest in polar waters. Species living in subtropical and subpolar waters decrease in test size with both increasing and decreasing temperature."

The mass loading of aerosol material is several milligrams per square meter. At the South Pole the mean particle radius is 0.04 micrometer; at Hawaii in March 1975 there was a thin volcanic layer with a mean particle radius of 0.1 micrometer. The aerosols cause heating of the earth-atmosphere system at the poles and cooling at low latitudes."

https://openalex.org/W2063938238,"Several investigators have shown recently that if the changes in the internal energy of a gas take place so slowly that they cannot follow the adiabatic changes which result when a sound wave passes through the gas, sound dispersion and anomalous absorption of observable magnitudes occur. Experimentally, it is found that the absorption in the air, for example, not only depends upon temperature and humidity in a characteristic manner, unsuspected by classical theory, but at frequencies above 1000 cycles is so great as to require consideration in such technical problems as architectural acoustics and sound signaling. The findings are in good agreement with the new theory. The presence of small impurities (less than one percent) in gases may change the speed of sound at certain frequencies as much as several percent: and the absorption coefficient as much as several hundred percent. Absorption measurements for frequencies between 1000 and 40,000 cycles in O2 containing small impurities of H2, He, H2O, H2S, N..."
