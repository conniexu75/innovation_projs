As casein in milk, or as the yellow yolk of many vertebrate and invertebrate eggs, phosphoprotein occurs in substantial quantities. In the frog egg, for example, the yolk platelets occupy almost half the volume of the cell. According to McClendon (5), the yolk of the frog egg consists of phosphoprotein bound to lipide; thus the platelets are a ready source of protein, lipide, and phosphorus. And yet, in spite of the obvious importance of phosphoprotein, little information is available about the manner of its utilization by the developing embryo. It has been assumed that ordinary proteolytic enzymes degrade the protein, and that ordinary phosphomonoesterases split the phosphate from phosphopeptone or from phosphoserine. 

In the course of an investigation of the distribution of enzymes in the frog egg, a new enzyme (or enzymes) was discovered which is apparently capable of splitting inorganic phosphate from the intact protein molecule. It is the purpose of this paper to present the experiments which led to this conclusion."

Several workers (24) have encountered difficulties with this method and have suggested improvements. The improved methods, although largely eliminating the troublesome “drifts” among values calculated at progressively higher assay levels, the variations in the standard curve, high blank values, and unsatisfactory recoveries still require an incubation of from 40 to 72 hours and titration of the acid produced. The yeast method described in the present communication possesses advantages of rapidity and convenience as compared to the bacterial method. Assays may be obtained in as short a time as 12 hours and the extent of yeast growth is conveniently determined with a photoelectric calorimeter. Furthermore, this method offers an opportunity for checking assay results with a different type of microorganism and may be useful in the differential determination of certain compounds related to nicotinic acid. The general techniques are essentially those described by Atkin et al. (5) and used for the determination of pyridoxine (6) and pantothenic acid (7)."
