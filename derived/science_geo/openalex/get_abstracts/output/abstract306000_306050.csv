https://openalex.org/W2001299769,"Discovery of shock-metamorphosed material establishes the impact origin of Lonar Crater. Coarse breccia with shatter coning and microbreccia with moderately shocked fragments containing maskelynite were found in drill holes through the crater floor. Trenches on the rim yield strongly shocked fragments in which plagioclase has melted and vesiculated, and bombs and spherules of homogeneous rock melt. As the only known terrestrial impact crater in basalt, Lonar Crater provides unique opportunities for comparison with lunar craters. In particular, microbreccias and glass spherules from Lonar Crater have close analogs among the Apollo specimens."

Contrary to previous suggestions that were consistent with the notions of a critical period for attachment formation and irreversibility of filial bonds, the monkeys formed strong and specific attachments to their canine surrogates."
https://openalex.org/W2046848334,Specimens of the small bivalved animal Fordilla troyensis Barrande from New York State show that this fossil is the oldest known pelecypod mollusk and not a conchostracan arthropod. This finding extends the range of the class Pelecypoda backward in time from the Early Ordovician (about 495 million years ago) to the Early Cambrian (about 540 to 570 million years ago). The morphology of Fordilla troyensis suggests that it lived infaunally and that it was ancestral to the pelecypod subclasses Heteroconchia and Isofilibranchia.
https://openalex.org/W1997809039,Variations of more than 1 percent are observed in the carbon-13 to carbon-12 ratio of extracts of leaves of the succulent Kalanchoe blossfeldiana when the photoperiod is changed from long to short days. This indicates that the mechanism of carbon fixation switches from the Calvin (C3) pathway to the Hatch-Slack (C4) pathway of primary enzymic operation. The variations observed in the isotope compositions are tentatively explained by a model.

https://openalex.org/W2013478424,"Several Apollo 16 breccias, including one containing goethite, are strikingly enriched in volatile elements such as bromine, cadmium, germanium, antimony, thallium, and zinc. Similar but smaller enrichments are found in all highland soils. It appears that volcanic processes took place in the lunar highlands, involving the release of volatiles including water. The lunar thallium/uranium ratio is 2 x 10-(4) of the cosmic ratio, which suggests that the moon's original water content could not have exceeded the equivalent of a layer 22 meters deep. The cataclastic anorthosites at the Apollo 16 site may represent deep ejecta from the Nectaris basin."

https://openalex.org/W4231500631,"A new science television series now broadcast over the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) will be of special interest to members of AAAS. The series, called NOVA, is produced by WGBH-TV, Boston, for PBS. The series has been created and produced with the advice and cooperation of AAAS, especially its Committee on the Public Understanding of Science and the Office of Communications Programs, as a major new effort at expanding the public's understanding of science and scientific processes. The series is financed by grants from the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the National Science Foundation, and Polaroid. A list of program descriptions in the current series with network air dates follows. Consult your local listings for local times."
