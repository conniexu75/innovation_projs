https://openalex.org/W3131504710,"The spread of Covid-19 has resulted in worldwide health concerns. Social media is increasingly used to share news and opinions about it. A realistic assessment of the situation is necessary to utilize resources optimally and appropriately. In this research, we perform Covid-19 tweets sentiment analysis using a supervised machine learning approach. Identification of Covid-19 sentiments from tweets would allow informed decisions for better handling the current pandemic situation. The used dataset is extracted from Twitter using IDs as provided by the IEEE data port. Tweets are extracted by an in-house built crawler that uses the Tweepy library. The dataset is cleaned using the preprocessing techniques and sentiments are extracted using the TextBlob library. The contribution of this work is the performance evaluation of various machine learning classifiers using our proposed feature set. This set is formed by concatenating the bag-of-words and the term frequency-inverse document frequency. Tweets are classified as positive, neutral, or negative. Performance of classifiers is evaluated on the accuracy, precision, recall, and F 1 score. For completeness, further investigation is made on the dataset using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture of the deep learning model. The results show that Extra Trees Classifiers outperform all other models by achieving a 0.93 accuracy score using our proposed concatenated features set. The LSTM achieves low accuracy as compared to machine learning classifiers. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed feature set, the results are compared with the Vader sentiment analysis technique based on the GloVe feature extraction approach."
https://openalex.org/W3129538072,"Neuropil is a fundamental form of tissue organization within the brain1, in which densely packed neurons synaptically interconnect into precise circuit architecture2,3. However, the structural and developmental principles that govern this nanoscale precision remain largely unknown4,5. Here we use an iterative data coarse-graining algorithm termed ‘diffusion condensation’6 to identify nested circuit structures within the Caenorhabditis elegans neuropil, which is known as the nerve ring. We show that the nerve ring neuropil is largely organized into four strata that are composed of related behavioural circuits. The stratified architecture of the neuropil is a geometrical representation of the functional segregation of sensory information and motor outputs, with specific sensory organs and muscle quadrants mapping onto particular neuropil strata. We identify groups of neurons with unique morphologies that integrate information across strata and that create neural structures that cage the strata within the nerve ring. We use high resolution light-sheet microscopy7,8 coupled with lineage-tracing and cell-tracking algorithms9,10 to resolve the developmental sequence and reveal principles of cell position, migration and outgrowth that guide stratified neuropil organization. Our results uncover conserved structural design principles that underlie the architecture and function of the nerve ring neuropil, and reveal a temporal progression of outgrowth—based on pioneer neurons—that guides the hierarchical development of the layered neuropil. Our findings provide a systematic blueprint for using structural and developmental approaches to understand neuropil organization within the brain. The C. elegans neuropil is shown to be organized into four strata composed of related behavioural circuits, and its design principles are linked to the developmental processes that underpin its assembly."
https://openalex.org/W3130181605,"There are gaps in our understanding of how non-specialists, such as lay health workers, can achieve core competencies to deliver psychosocial interventions in low- and middle-income countries.We conducted a 12-month mixed-methods study alongside the Rehabilitation Intervention for people with Schizophrenia in Ethiopia (RISE) pilot study. We rated a total of 30 role-plays and 55 clinical encounters of ten community-based rehabilitation (CBR) lay workers using an Ethiopian adaptation of the ENhancing Assessment of Common Therapeutic factors (ENACT) structured observational rating scale. To explore factors influencing competence, six focus group discussions and four in-depth interviews were conducted with 11 CBR workers and two supervisors at three time-points. We conducted a thematic analysis and triangulated the qualitative and quantitative data.There were improvements in CBR worker competence throughout the training and 12-month pilot study. Therapeutic alliance competencies (e.g., empathy) saw the earliest improvements. Competencies in personal factors (e.g., substance use) and external factors (e.g., assessing social networks) were initially rated lower, but scores improved during the pilot. Problem-solving and giving advice competencies saw the least improvements overall. Multimodal training, including role-plays, field work and group discussions, contributed to early development of competence. Initial stigma towards CBR participants was reduced through contact. Over time CBR workers occupied dual roles of expert and close friend for the people with schizophrenia in the programme. Competence was sustained through peer supervision, which also supported wellbeing. More intensive specialist supervision was needed.It is possible to equip lay health workers with the core competencies to deliver a psychosocial intervention for people with schizophrenia in a low-income setting. A prolonged period of work experience is needed to develop advanced skills such as problem-solving. A structured intervention with clear protocols, combined with peer supervision to support wellbeing, is recommended for good quality intervention delivery. Repeated ENACT assessments can feasibly and successfully be used to identify areas needing improvement and to guide on-going training and supervision."
https://openalex.org/W3132798798,"Breast cancer is a malignancy arising in the mammary epithelial tissues. Recent studies have indicated the abundance of microRNAs (miRNAs) in extracellular vesicles (EVs), and their interactions have been illustrated to exert crucial roles in the cell-to-cell communication. The present study focused on investigating whether EV-delivered miR-370-3p affects breast cancer. Initially, the miR-370-3p expression pattern was examined in the cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), normal fibroblasts (NFs), and cancerous cells-derived EVs. The relation of miR-370-3p to CYLD was assessed using luciferase activity assay. Afterwards, based on ectopic expression and depletion experiments in the MCF-7 breast cancer cells, we evaluated stemness, migration, invasion, and sphere formation ability, and EMT, accompanied with measurement on the expression patterns of pro-inflammatory factors and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling-related genes. Finally, tumorigenesis and proliferation were analyzed in vivo using a nude mouse xenograft model. The in vitro experiments revealed that breast cancer cell-derived EVs promoted NF activation, while activated fibroblasts contributed to enhanced stemness, migration, invasion, as well as EMT of cancerous cells. In addition, EVs could transfer miR-370-3p from breast cancer cells to NFs, and EV-encapsulated miR-370-3p was also found to facilitate fibroblast activation. Mechanistically, EV-encapsulated miR-370-3p downregulated the expression of CYLD through binding to its 3′UTR and activated the NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby promoting the cellular functions in vitro and in vivo in breast cancer. Taken together, EVs secreted by breast cancer cells could carry miR-370-3p to aggravate breast cancer through downregulating CYLD expression and activating the NF-κB signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3130055004,"q-Rung orthopair fuzzy set (qROFS) and m-polar fuzzy set (mPFS) are rudimentary concepts in the computational intelligence, which have diverse applications in fuzzy modeling and decision making under uncertainty. The aim of this paper is to introduce the hybrid concept of q-rung orthopair m-polar fuzzy set (qROmPFS) as a hybrid model of q-rung orthopair fuzzy set and m-polar fuzzy set. A qROmPFS has the ability to deal with real life situations when decision experts are interested to deal with multi-polarity as well as membership and non-membership grades to the alternatives in an extended domain with q-ROF environment. Certain operations on qROmPFSs and several new notions like support, core, height, concentration, dilation, α -cut and ( α , β )-cut of qROmPFS are defined. Additionally, grey relational analysis (GRA) and choice value method (CVM) are presented under qROmPFSs for multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) in robotic agri-farming. The proposed methods are suitable to find out an appropriate mode of farming among several kinds of agri-farming. The applications of proposed MCDM approaches are illustrated by respective numerical examples. To justify the feasibility, superiority and reliability of proposed techniques, the comparison analysis of the final ranking in the robotic agri-farming computed by the proposed techniques with some existing MCDM methods is also given."
https://openalex.org/W3131085383,"Metal-based high-touch surfaces used for indoor applications such as doorknobs, light switches, handles and desks need to remain their antimicrobial properties even when tarnished or degraded. A novel laboratory methodology of relevance for indoor atmospheric conditions and fingerprint contact has therefore been elaborated for combined studies of both tarnishing/corrosion and antimicrobial properties of such high-touch surfaces. Cu metal was used as a benchmark material. The protocol includes pre-tarnishing/corrosion of the high touch surface for different time periods in a climatic chamber at repeated dry/wet conditions and artificial sweat deposition followed by the introduction of bacteria onto the surfaces via artificial sweat droplets. This methodology provides a more realistic and reproducible approach compared with other reported procedures to determine the antimicrobial efficiency of high-touch surfaces. It provides further a possibility to link the antimicrobial characteristics to physical and chemical properties such as surface composition, chemical reactivity, tarnishing/corrosion, surface roughness and surface wettability. The results elucidate that bacteria interactions as well as differences in extent of tarnishing can alter the physical properties (e.g. surface wettability, surface roughness) as well as the extent of metal release. The results clearly elucidate the importance to consider changes in chemical and physical properties of indoor hygiene surfaces when assessing their antimicrobial properties."
https://openalex.org/W3132005273,"Plant phenotyping is a central task in crop science and plant breeding. It involves measuring plant traits to describe the anatomy and physiology of plants and is used for deriving traits and evaluating plant performance. Traditional methods for phenotyping are often time-consuming operations involving substantial manual labor. The availability of 3D sensor data of plants obtained from laser scanners or modern depth cameras offers the potential to automate several of these phenotyping tasks. This automation can scale up the phenotyping measurements and evaluations that have to be performed to a larger number of plant samples and at a finer spatial and temporal resolution. In this paper, we investigate the problem of registering 3D point clouds of the plants over time and space. This means that we determine correspondences between point clouds of plants taken at different points in time and register them using a new, non-rigid registration approach. This approach has the potential to form the backbone for phenotyping applications aimed at tracking the traits of plants over time. The registration task involves finding data associations between measurements taken at different times while the plants grow and change their appearance, allowing 3D models taken at different points in time to be compared with each other. Registering plants over time is challenging due to its anisotropic growth, changing topology, and non-rigid motion in between the time of the measurements. Thus, we propose a novel approach that first extracts a compact representation of the plant in the form of a skeleton that encodes both topology and semantic information, and then use this skeletal structure to determine correspondences over time and drive the registration process. Through this approach, we can tackle the data association problem for the time-series point cloud data of plants effectively. We tested our approach on different datasets acquired over time and successfully registered the 3D plant point clouds recorded with a laser scanner. We demonstrate that our method allows for developing systems for automated temporal plant-trait analysis by tracking plant traits at an organ level."
https://openalex.org/W3130385510,"Alginates gel rapidly under ambient conditions and have widely documented potential to form protective matrices for sensitive bioactive cargo. Most commonly, alginate gelation occurs via calcium mediated electrostatic crosslinks between the linear polyuronic acid polymers. A recent breakthrough to form crosslinked alginate microcapsules (CLAMs) by in situ gelation during spray drying (“CLAMs process”) has demonstrated applications in protection and controlled delivery of bioactives in food, cosmetics, and agriculture. The extent of crosslinking of alginates in CLAMs impacts the effectiveness of its barrier properties. For example, higher crosslinking extents can improve oxidative stability and limit diffusion of the encapsulated cargo. Crosslinking in CLAMs can be controlled by varying the calcium to alginate ratio; however, the choice of alginates used in the process also influences the ultimate extent of crosslinking. To understand how to select alginates to target crosslinking in CLAMs, we examined the roles of alginate molecular properties. A surprise finding was the formation of alginic acid gelling in the CLAMs that is a consequence of simultaneous and rapid pH reduction and moisture removal that occurs during spray drying. Thus, spray dried CLAMs gelation is due to calcium crosslinking and alginic acid formation, and unlike external gelation methods, is insensitive to the molecular composition of the alginates. The ‘extent of gelation’ of spray dried CLAMs is influenced by the molecular weights of the alginates at saturating calcium concentrations. Alginate viscosity correlates with molecular weight; thus, viscosity is a convenient criterion for selecting commercial alginates to target gelation extent in CLAMs."
https://openalex.org/W3130215238,"Achieving biologically interpretable neural-biomarkers and features from neuroimaging datasets is a challenging task in an MRI-based dyslexia study. This challenge becomes more pronounced when the needed MRI datasets are collected from multiple heterogeneous sources with inconsistent scanner settings. This study presents a method of improving the biological interpretation of dyslexia’s neural-biomarkers from MRI datasets sourced from publicly available open databases. The proposed system utilized a modified histogram normalization (MHN) method to improve dyslexia neural-biomarker interpretations by mapping the pixels’ intensities of low-quality input neuroimages to range between the low-intensity region of interest ( ROI low ) and high-intensity region of interest ( ROI high ) of the high-quality image. This was achieved after initial image smoothing using the Gaussian filter method with an isotropic kernel of size 4mm. The performance of the proposed smoothing and normalization methods was evaluated based on three image post-processing experiments: ROI segmentation, gray matter (GM) tissues volume estimations, and deep learning (DL) classifications using Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT12) and pre-trained models in a MATLAB working environment. The three experiments were preceded by some pre-processing tasks such as image resizing, labelling, patching, and non-rigid registration. Our results showed that the best smoothing was achieved at a scale value, σ = 1.25 with a 0.9% increment in the peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Results from the three image post-processing experiments confirmed the efficacy of the proposed methods. Evidence emanating from our analysis showed that using the proposed MHN and Gaussian smoothing methods can improve comparability of image features and neural-biomarkers of dyslexia with a statistically significantly high disc similarity coefficient (DSC) index, low mean square error (MSE), and improved tissue volume estimations. After 10 repeated 10-fold cross-validation, the highest accuracy achieved by DL models is 94.7% at a 95% confidence interval (CI) level. Finally, our finding confirmed that the proposed MHN method significantly outperformed the normalization method of the state-of-the-art histogram matching."
https://openalex.org/W3133442143,"Background To suppress the COVID-19 outbreak, the Norwegian government closed all schools on March 13, 2020. The kindergartens reopened on April 20, and the schools on April 27 and May 11 of 2020. The effect of these measures is largely unknown since the role of children in the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is still unclear. There are only a few studies of school closures as a separate intervention to other social distancing measures, and little research exists on the effect of school opening during a pandemic. Objective This study aimed to model the effect of opening kindergartens and the schools in Norway in terms of a change in the reproduction number ( R ). A secondary objective was to assess if we can use the estimated R after school openings to infer the rates of transmission between children in schools. Methods We used an individual-based model (IBM) to assess the reopening of kindergartens and schools in two Norwegian cities, Oslo, the Norwegian capital, with a population of approximately 680 000, and Tromsø, which is the largest city in Northern Norway, with a population of approximately 75 000. The model uses demographic information and detailed data about the schools in both cities. We carried out an ensemble study to obtain robust results in spite of the considerable uncertainty that remains about the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Results We found that reopening of Norwegian kindergartens and schools are associated with a change in R of 0.10 (95%CI 0.04–0.16) and 0.14 (95%CI 0.01–0.25) in the two cities under investigation if the in-school transmission rates for the SARS-CoV-2 virus are equal to what has previously been estimated for influenza pandemics. Conclusion We found only a limited effect of reopening schools on the reproduction number, and we expect the same to hold true in other countries where nonpharmaceutical interventions have suppressed the pandemic. Consequently, current R -estimates are insufficiently accurate for determining the transmission rates in schools. For countries that have closed schools, planned interventions, such as the opening of selected schools, can be useful to infer general knowledge about children-to-children transmission of SARS-CoV-2."
https://openalex.org/W3129797192,"The objective of this study is to verify the feasibility of using biochar made from crop straw as a bitumen additive to improve some properties of bitumen. The differences between crop straw biochar prepared in a laboratory and commercial charcoal were investigated through scanning electron microscopy and laser particle size analyses. Furthermore, biochar-modified asphalt was prepared using the high-speed shear method, and the penetration, softening point, ductility at 15°C, and apparent viscosity of the asphalt binder with 6% biochar were measured at 120, 135, 150, 160, and 175°C. It was found that both the crop straw biochar and the commercial charcoal consist mainly of C, O, Si, and K, but the C content of crop straw biochar is slightly higher than that of commercial charcoal. The particle size of biochar is smaller than that of commercial charcoal, while the specific surface area is larger. It was determined that the addition of crop straw biochar significantly improved the high-temperature performance of asphalt, and that biochar and commercial charcoal have a similar influence on the high temperature performance of asphalt."
https://openalex.org/W3132345162,"Objectives The European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer found that prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening reduced prostate cancer mortality, however the costs and harms from screening may outweigh any mortality reduction. Compared with screening using the PSA test alone, using the Stockholm3 Model (S3M) as a reflex test for PSA ≥ 1 ng/mL has the same sensitivity for Gleason score ≥ 7 cancers while the relative positive fractions for Gleason score 6 cancers and no cancer were 0.83 and 0.56, respectively. The cost-effectiveness of the S3M test has not previously been assessed. Methods We undertook a cost-effectiveness analysis from a lifetime societal perspective. Using a microsimulation model, we simulated for: (i) no prostate cancer screening; (ii) screening using the PSA test; and (iii) screening using the S3M test as a reflex test for PSA values ≥ 1, 1.5 and 2 ng/mL. Screening strategies included quadrennial re-testing for ages 55–69 years performed by a general practitioner. Discounted costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Results Comparing S3M with a reflex threshold of 2 ng/mL with screening using the PSA test, S3M had increased effectiveness, reduced lifetime biopsies by 30%, and increased societal costs by 0.4%. Relative to the PSA test, the S3M reflex thresholds of 1, 1.5 and 2 ng/mL had ICERs of 170,000, 60,000 and 6,000 EUR/QALY, respectively. The S3M test was more cost-effective at higher biopsy costs. Conclusions Prostate cancer screening using the S3M test for men with an initial PSA ≥ 2.0 ng/mL was cost-effective compared with screening using the PSA test alone."
https://openalex.org/W3129428404,"African swine fever (ASF) is an acute, hemorrhagic, and highly contagious disease caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV). The mortality rate of acute infection up to 100% have posed an unprecedented challenge of the swine industry. Currently no commercial antiviral drug is available for the control and treatment of ASFV. The structural resolution of ASFV virions reveals the details of ASFV morphogenesis, providing a new perspective for the research and promotion of the development of ASFV vaccines. Although the architecture of ASFV have been solved via cryo-EM, the structural details of four of the five viral layers remain unclear (except the outer capsid). In this study, we resolved the crystal structure of the ASFV core shell protein p15. The secondary structural elements of a protomer include four α-helix structures and six antiparallel β-strands. Further analysis revealed that ASFV p15 forms disulfide-linked trimers between the Cys9 from one protomer and Cys30 from other protomer. Additionally, the nucleic acid-binding property was characterized by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Two critical amino acid Lys10 and Lys39 have been identified which is essential to the nucleic acid-binding affinity of ASFV p15. Together, these findings may provide new insight into antiviral drug development."
https://openalex.org/W3129892326,"Mechanisms controlling CO 2 and CH 4 production in wetlands are central to understanding carbon cycling and greenhouse gas exchange. However, the volatility of these respiration products complicates quantifying their rates of production in the field. Attempts to circumvent the challenges through closed system incubations, from which gases cannot escape, have been used to investigate bulk in situ geochemistry. Efforts towards mapping mechanistic linkages between geochemistry and microbiology have raised concern regarding sampling and incubation-induced perturbations. Microorganisms are impacted by oxygen exposure, increased temperatures and accumulation of metabolic products during handling, storage, and incubation. We probed the extent of these perturbations, and their influence on incubation results, using high-resolution geochemical and microbial gene-based community profiling of anaerobically incubated material from three wetland habitats across a permafrost peatland. We compared the original field samples to the material anaerobically incubated over 50 days. Bulk geochemistry and phylum-level microbiota in incubations largely reflected field observations, but divergence between field and incubations occurred in both geochemistry and lineage-level microbial composition when examined at closer resolution. Despite the changes in representative lineages over time, inferred metabolic function with regards to carbon cycling largely reproduced field results suggesting functional consistency. Habitat differences among the source materials remained the largest driver of variation in geochemical and microbial differences among the samples in both incubations and field results. While incubations may have limited usefulness for identifying specific mechanisms, they remain a viable tool for probing bulk-scale questions related to anaerobic C cycling, including CO 2 and CH 4 dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W3131884649,"During the Natufian period, more than 12,000 years ago, Eynan (Ain Mallaha) was an important human settlement in the Hula Valley, Israel. This study concentrates on the anuran and squamate assemblage from the ultimate stage of the Natufian period at the site, the Final Natufian. Over five thousand bones assigned to at least sixteen taxa were studied from a sampled segment of the excavated open-air site. Relative species abundance, spatial distribution, taphonomic observations and ecological considerations all pointed to the conclusion that the inhabitants of Eynan intensively exploited three large “colubrine” snakes species: the Large Whip Snake ( Dolichophis jugularis ), the Eastern Montpellier Snake ( Malpolon insignitus ) and an Eastern Four-lined Ratsnake ( Elaphe cf. sauromates ). These snakes were the most desired and were intensively gathered, while other snakes and lizards could have been opportunistically collected when encountered. We raise questions about whether the large “colubrines” exploitation should be interpreted as additional evidence of increasing diet breadth. We suggest challenging this line of reasoning and offer possible alternative motives."
https://openalex.org/W3131947898,"Introduction The prevalence of oral hygiene behaviors (OHB) is very low among school children in Ethiopia. However, the determinants of student’s readiness/intention to perform those behaviors have been remained unstudied. Objective This study aimed to identify the determinants of oral hygiene behavioral intention (OHBI) among preparatory school students based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Methods and materials An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 393 students. A 98-item self-administered questionnaire was used to evaluate oral hygiene knowledge (OHK), oral hygiene behavior (OHB), and OHBI based on TPB variables [attitude (ATT), subjective norms (SN) and perceived behavioral control (PBC)]. Descriptive statistics and structural equation modeling analysis (SEM) were employed to confirm relationships and associations among study variables. A p-value of less than 0.05 and a 95% confidence interval were used to declare statistical significance. Results A total of 393 students were participated with a response rate of 97.5%. The mean age of the participants (54% females) was 18 (± 1.3) with an age range of 16 to 24. The TPB model was well fitted to the data and explained 66% of the variance in intention. ATT (β = 0.38; 95% CI, (0.21, 0.64)), SN (β = 0.33; 95% CI, (0.05, 0.83)) and PBC (β = 0.29; 95% CI, (0.13, 0.64)) were significant predictors of OHBI, where ATT was the strongest predictor of OHBI. Conclusion The TPB model explained a large variance in the intention of students to improve their OHB. All TPB variables were significantly and positively linked to stronger intent, as the theory suggests. Furthermore, these results suggest that the model could provide a framework for oral hygiene promotion interventions in the study area. Indeed, these interventions should focus on changing the attitudes of students towards OHB, creation of positive social pressure, and enabling students to control over OHB barriers."
https://openalex.org/W3132003948,"Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a neurodegenerative disease resulting from a severe decrease of frataxin (FXN). Most patients carry a GAA repeat expansion in both alleles of the FXN gene, whereas a small fraction of them are compound heterozygous for the expansion and a point mutation in the other allele. FXN is involved in the mitochondrial biogenesis of the FeS-clusters. Distinctive feature of FRDA patient cells is an impaired cellular respiration, likely due to a deficit of key redox cofactors working as electrons shuttles through the respiratory chain. However, a definite relationship between FXN levels, FeS-clusters assembly dysregulation and bioenergetics failure has not been established. In this work, we performed a comparative analysis of the mitochondrial phenotype of cell lines from FRDA patients, either homozygous for the expansion or compound heterozygotes for the G130V mutation. We found that, in healthy cells, FXN and two key proteins of the FeS-cluster assembly machinery are enriched in mitochondrial cristae, the dynamic subcompartment housing the respiratory chain. On the contrary, FXN widely redistributes to the matrix in FRDA cells with defects in respiratory supercomplexes assembly and altered respiratory function. We propose that this could be relevant for the early mitochondrial defects afflicting FRDA cells and that perturbation of mitochondrial morphodynamics could in turn be critical in terms of disease mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3132391547,"Background Appropriate infant and young child feeding practices are the basis for child nutrition. In China, WeChat is gradually changing the channels through which people receive information. The paper aims to explore the feasibility of using WeChat to improve infant and young child feeding in rural China. Methods A mixed-methods study was carried out in Huzhu County, Qinghai province, China. We conducted two cross-sectional surveys with children aged 6–23 months and their caregivers in 2012 (N = 1804) and 2018 (N = 754), respectively. Quantitative data were collected on feeding knowledge and practices, caregiver’s use of smartphones and WeChat. Qualitative data were from 33 semi-structured interviews with pregnant women and mothers. In addition, we developed a WeChat feeding health education platform and asked women about their experiences with using it. Results In both cross-sectional surveys, less than 10% of caregivers knew that breastfeeding can be continued up to two years, less than 50% knew the accurate duration of exclusive breastfeeding, and only around 20% knew meat can be given to children from the age of 6–8 months. Similarly, the feeding practices were suboptimal and most key infant feeding practices did not change over the years. Only around 30% of caregivers ever received feeding information during pregnancy or after delivery in both surveys. Around 50% of caregivers received information from their relatives and friends, followed by 30% from health facilities and communities. More than 80% of mothers were currently using both a smartphone and the WeChat app, and 75.4% of them were willing to receive feeding information from WeChat official accounts. The WeChat feeding health education platform developed by our study team was generally well accepted by women. Conclusions There was an absence of accurate information sources on infant feeding and child nutrition. WeChat could be a potential way to deliver infant feeding recommendations to pregnant women and mothers in rural China.

https://openalex.org/W3132428776,"As a new alternative to antibody-drug conjugates, we generated “ligand-targeting” peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs), which utilize receptor-mediated endocytosis for targeted intracellular drug delivery. The PDC makes a complex with an extracellular ligand and then binds to the receptor on the cell surface to stimulate intracellular uptake via the endocytic pathway. A helix-loop-helix (HLH) peptide was designed as the drug carrier and randomized to give a conformationally constrained peptide library. The phage-displayed library was screened against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to yield the binding peptide M49, which exhibited strong binding affinity ( K D = 0.87 nM). The confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed that peptide M49 formed a ternary complex with VEGF and its receptor, which was then internalized into human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) via VEGF receptor-mediated endocytosis. The backbone-cyclized peptide M49K was conjugated with a drug, monomethyl auristatin E, to afford a PDC, which inhibited VEGF-induced HUVEC proliferation. HLH peptides and their PDCs have great potential as a new modality for targeted molecular therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3132778994,"During formation of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling proteins, cooperative activities of the Hedgehog INTein (Hint) fold and Sterol Recognition Region (SRR) couple autoproteolysis to cholesterol ligation. The cholesteroylated Hh morphogens play essential roles in embryogenesis, tissue regeneration, and tumorigenesis. Despite the centrality of cholesterol in Hh function, the full structure of the Hint-SRR (“Hog”) domain that attaches cholesterol to the last residue of the active Hh morphogen remains enigmatic. In this work, we combine molecular dynamics simulations, photoaffinity crosslinking, and mutagenesis assays to model cholesterolysis intermediates in the human Sonic Hedgehog (hSHH) protein. Our results provide evidence for a hydrophobic Hint-SRR interface that forms a dynamic, non-covalent cholesterol-Hog complex. Using these models, we suggest a unified mechanism by which Hh proteins can recruit, sequester, and orient cholesterol, and offer a molecular basis for the effects of disease-causing hSHH mutations."

Here, a total of 23 NCED genes (designated as GhNCED1 to GhNCED23 ) were identified in cotton. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the identified NCED proteins from cotton and Arabidopsis could be classified into 4 subgroups. Conserved motif analysis revealed that the gene structure and motif distribution of proteins within each subgroup were highly conserved. qRT-PCR and ABA content analyses indicated that NCED genes exhibited stage-specific expression patterns at tissue development stages. GhNCED5 , GhNCED6 and GhNCED13 expression was similar to the change in ABA content, suggesting that this gene family plays a role in ABA synthesis. These results provide a better understanding of the potential functions of GhNCED genes."
https://openalex.org/W3130002788,"Since their discovery as pluripotent cytokines extractable from bone matrix, it has been speculated how bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) become released and activated from the extracellular matrix (ECM). In contrast to TGF-βs, most investigated BMPs are secreted as bioactive prodomain (PD)-growth factor (GF) complexes (CPLXs). Recently, we demonstrated that PD-dependent targeting of BMP-7 CPLXs to the extracellular fibrillin microfibril (FMF) components fibrillin-1 and -2 represents a BMP sequestration mechanism by rendering the GF latent. Understanding how BMPs become activated from ECM scaffolds such as FMF is crucial to elucidate pathomechanisms characterized by aberrant BMP activation and ECM destruction. Here, we describe a new MMP-dependent BMP-7 activation mechanism from ECM-targeted pools via specific PD degradation. Using Edman sequencing and mutagenesis, we identified a new and conserved MMP-13 cleavage site within the BMP-7 PD. A degradation screen with different BMP family PDs and representative MMP family members suggested utilization of the identified site in a general MMP-driven BMP activation mechanism. Furthermore, sandwich ELISA and solid phase cleavage studies in combination with bioactivity assays, single particle TEM, and in silico molecular docking experiments provided evidence that PD cleavage by MMP-13 leads to BMP-7 CPLX disintegration and bioactive GF release."

The first study presented the translation and validation of the Talent Development Environment Questionnaire (TDEQ) into French using a recommended methodology for translating and culturally adapting questionnaires. Two hundred and three Swiss athletes (M = 16.99 years old) responded to the 25 items of the TDEQ-5. One item was excluded due to low factor loadings, and the descriptive statistics showed that the re-specified TDEQ-5 instrument had acceptable global model fit according to the thresholds in the literature (χ2 (df = 17) = 484.62, p&lt;0.001, CFI = 0.91, TLI = 0.90, RMSEA = 0.07, SRMR = 0.06). This adaptation is thus valid for assessing the effectiveness of talent development processes. For the second study, a holistic design was used to examine the perceptions of a set of players embedded in a top-level Swiss soccer academy (i.e., 64 elite soccer players from 14 to 18 years old) by using the TDEQ-5. The results showed some relative strengths (i.e., F1-Long-Term Focus for the M15 and M16 age-groups) and weaknesses (i.e., F2-Alignment of Expectations for the M17 and M18 age -groups and F3-Communication for M17). They also highlighted that the talent pathways of these Swiss soccer players could not be summarized by a single type of transition toward a professional team. Rather, there were context-specific requirements, such as the critical period between the M15-M16 and M17-M18 age-groups, suggesting that when the players first entered their TDE they experienced a set of affordances to develop and flourish, which thereafter were perceived as less rich and/or abundant. These results offer a starting point for optimizing talent pathways."
https://openalex.org/W3130510921,"Background Oral health is a less-recognized correlate of overall and mental wellbeing. This study aimed to assess the relationship between suicidal behavior (ideation and attempt) and oral health practices and status, and to determine the effect of sex on these associations among Nigerian adolescents. Methods Household survey data were collected from 10 to 19-year-old adolescents in southwestern Nigeria. Dependent variables were daily tooth brushing, daily consumption of refined carbohydrates between meals, and oral hygiene status (measured by plaque index). The independent variable was lifetime suicidal ideation/attempt, dichotomized into ‘yes’ and ‘never’. ‘Daily tooth brushing’ and ‘daily consumption of refined carbohydrates between meals’ were included in two separate logistic regression models, and ‘oral hygiene status’ was included in a linear regression model. The models were adjusted for sex, age, and socioeconomic status. The linear regression model was also adjusted for frequency of daily tooth-brushing and of consumption of refined carbohydrates between meals. Interactions between sex and suicidal ideation/suicide attempt in association with dependent variables were assessed. Significance was set at 5%. Results We recruited 1,472 participants with mean age (standard deviation) of 14.6 (2.6) years. The mean plaque index was 0.84 (0.56), and 66 (4.5%) adolescents reported ever having suicidal ideation/attempt. Suicidal ideation/attempt was associated with significantly lower likelihood of tooth brushing (OR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.26, 0.91), higher likelihood of consuming refined carbohydrates between meals (OR = 2.30, 95% CI: 1.29, 4.10), and having poor oral hygiene (B = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.32). Among males, suicidal ideation/attempt was associated with less likelihood of eating refined carbohydrates between meals (OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.35, 2.61). Conversely, it was associated with a significantly higher likelihood of this outcome (OR = 4.85, 95% CI: 2.23, 10.55) among females. Conclusion The study findings suggest that poor tooth brushing habits and poor oral hygiene are indicators for risk of suicidal behavior for adolescents in Nigeria, while high sugar consumption may be an additional risk factor for adolescent females. These findings support the role of dental practitioners as members of healthcare teams responsible for screening, identifying and referring patients at risk for suicidal ideation/attempt."
https://openalex.org/W3130988016,"Scientific collections such as the U.S. National Museum (USNM) are critical to filling knowledge gaps in molecular systematics studies. The global taxonomic impediment has resulted in a reduction of expert taxonomists generating new collections of rare or understudied taxa and these large historic collections may be the only reliable source of material for some taxa. Integrated systematics studies using both morphological examinations and DNA sequencing are often required for resolving many taxonomic issues but as DNA methods often require partial or complete destruction of a sample, there are many factors to consider before implementing destructive sampling of specimens within scientific collections. We present a methodology for the use of archive specimens that includes two crucial phases: 1) thoroughly documenting specimens destined for destructive sampling—a process called electronic vouchering, and 2) the pipeline used for whole genome sequencing of archived specimens, from extraction of genomic DNA to assembly of putative genomes with basic annotation. The process is presented for eleven specimens from two different insect subfamilies of medical importance to humans: Anophelinae (Diptera: Culicidae)—mosquitoes and Triatominae (Hemiptera: Reduviidae)—kissing bugs. Assembly of whole mitochondrial genome sequences of all 11 specimens along with the results of an ortholog search and BLAST against the NCBI nucleotide database are also presented."
https://openalex.org/W3131063694,"Background Schistosoma constitutes a major public health problem and developmental challenges in the majority of developing and subtropical regions. The World Health Organization has set guidelines for the control and elimination of schistosomiasis. Ethiopia is providing school-based Mass Drug Administration (MDA) at the study areas of the Abbey and Didessa Valleys of western Ethiopian since 2015. Moreover, mass treatment was already done in the same villages 30 years ago. However, the current Schistosoma mansoni infection status among humans and snails in the study areas is not known. Hence, the present study aims to determine the current status. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in the three communities; Chessega, Agallu Metti and Shimala in Schistosoma mansoni endemic areas of the Abbey and Didessa valleys in Western Ethiopia. Using the list of households obtained from the Kebele administration, a systematic sampling technique was used to select households in each village. Results Even though the area is under the Ethiopian national Mass Drug Administration campaign, the present study reports prevalence above 50%. Although the majority of the infections were moderate, we found that 13% had heavy infection, above 400 eggs per gram of stool, which is at the same level as before the treatment campaign 30 years ago. The infection was significantly higher among those below 12 years of age, among non-attending school-age children and daily laborers. Conclusion Schistosoma mansoni infection is still a public health problem in the study areas, despite control efforts already 30 years ago and present mass treatment in the last years. We suggest making the mass treatment campaign just early after the rainy season, when the snails are washed away. This should be supplemented with provisions of clean water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and reduction of water contact and possible snail control efforts’ to prevent reinfection."
https://openalex.org/W3132006141,"Falling in Parkinsonian syndromes (PS) is associated with postural instability and consists a common cause of disability among PS patients. Current posturographic practices record the body’s center-of-pressure displacement (statokinesigram) while the patient stands on a force platform. Statokinesigrams, after appropriate processing, can offer numerous posturographic features. This fact, although beneficial, challenges the efforts for valid statistics via standard univariate approaches. In this work, 123 PS patients were classified into fallers (PS F ) or non-faller (PS NF ) based on the clinical assessment, and underwent simple Romberg Test (eyes open/eyes closed). We developed a non-parametric multivariate two-sample test (ts-AUC) based on machine learning, in order to examine statokinesigrams’ differences between PS F and PS NF . We analyzed posturographic features using both multiple testing with p -value adjustment and ts-AUC. While ts-AUC showed significant difference between groups ( p -value = 0.01), multiple testing did not agree with this result (eyes open). PS F showed significantly increased antero-posterior movements as well as increased posturographic area compared to PS NF . Our study highlights the superiority of ts-AUC compared to standard statistical tools in distinguishing PS F and PS NF in multidimensional space. Machine learning-based statistical tests can be seen as a natural extension of classical statistics and should be considered, especially when dealing with multifactorial assessments."
https://openalex.org/W3132344302,"Understanding the functionality of proteins has emerged as a critical problem in recent years due to significant roles of these macro-molecules in biological mechanisms. However, in-laboratory techniques for protein function prediction are not as efficient as methods developed and processed for protein sequencing. While more than 70 million protein sequences are available today, only the functionality of around one percent of them are known. These facts have encouraged researchers to develop computational methods to infer protein functionalities from their sequences. Gene Ontology is the most well-known database for protein functions which has a hierarchical structure, where deeper terms are more determinative and specific. However, the lack of experimentally approved annotations for these specific terms limits the performance of computational methods applied on them. In this work, we propose a method to improve protein function prediction using their sequences by deeply extracting relationships between Gene Ontology terms. To this end, we construct a conditional generative adversarial network which helps to effectively discover and incorporate term correlations in the annotation process. In addition to the baseline algorithms, we compare our method with two recently proposed deep techniques that attempt to utilize Gene Ontology term correlations. Our results confirm the superiority of the proposed method compared to the previous works. Moreover, we demonstrate how our model can effectively help to assign more specific terms to sequences."
https://openalex.org/W3132352080,"Cats are ubiquitous companion animals that have been keenly associated with humans for thousands of years and only recently have been intentionally bred for aesthetically appealing coat looks and body forms. The intense selection on single gene phenotypes and the various breeding histories of cat breeds have left different marks on the genomes. Using a previously published 63K Feline SNP array dataset of twenty-six cat breeds, this study utilized a genetic differentiation-based method ( di ) to empirically identify candidate regions under selection. Defined as three or more overlapping (500Kb) windows of high levels of population differentiation, we identified a total of 205 candidate regions under selection across cat breeds with an average of 6 candidate regions per breed and an average size of 1.5 Mb per candidate region. Using the combined size of candidate regions of each breed, we conservatively estimate that a minimum of ~ 0.1–0.7% of the autosomal genome is potentially under selection in cats. As positive controls and tests of our methodology, we explored the candidate regions of known breed-defining genes (e.g., FGF5 for longhaired breeds) and we were able to detect the genes within candidate regions, each in its corresponding breed. For breed specific exploration of candidate regions under selection, eleven representative candidate regions were found to encompass potential candidate genes for several phenotypes such as brachycephaly of Persian ( DLX6 , DLX5 , DLX2 ), curled ears of American Curl ( MCRIP2 , PBX1) , and body-form of Siamese and Oriental ( ADGRD1 ), which encourages further molecular investigations. The current assessment of the candidate regions under selection is empiric and detailed analyses are needed to rigorously disentangle effects of demography and population structure from artificial selection."

https://openalex.org/W3129876628,"The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the risk factors for short-term postoperative complications in the 8 weeks after unilateral tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO) for cranial cruciate ligament rupture in small dogs weighing less than 15 kg. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for 90 dogs weighing &lt;15 kg that underwent medial parapatellar arthrotomy with inspection of the meniscus and TPLO performed by the same surgeon between January 2012 and December 2017. The overall complication rate was 4.44% (4/90 dogs). There were four cases of partial incisional dehiscence, none of which required surgical revision. Complications were significantly more likely in dogs that had undergone placement of a 2.4-mm TPLO plate. Overall, the complication rate was less than that in previous studies of dogs weighing &gt; 15kg. In this study, patients in which 2.4-mm TPLO plates were used were more likely to develop postoperative complications. Dogs weighing &lt;15 kg that underwent TPLO had good short-term outcomes with minimal complications. In our study, the overall complication rate after TPLO in dogs weighing &lt;15 kg is less than that historically reported in heavier dogs. Our data suggests that TPLO is a safe treatment option in small dogs with cranial cruciate ligament rupture."
https://openalex.org/W3130661625,"Male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) comprise a common syndrome of aging that negatively impacts quality of life. The etiology of LUTS is multifactorial, involving benign prostatic hyperplasia, smooth muscle and neurologic dysfunction, inflammation, sexually transmitted infections, fibrosis, and potentially dysbiosis, but this aspect remains poorly explored. We investigated whether the presence of infectious agents in urine might be associated with LUTS by combining next-generation DNA sequencing for virus discovery, microbiome analysis for characterization of bacterial communities, and mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. In urine from 29 LUTS cases and 9 controls from Wisconsin, we found a statistically significant association between a diagnosis of LUTS and the presence of JC virus (JCV), a common neurotropic human polyomavirus ( Polyomaviridae , Betapolyomavirus ) linked to severe neurologic disease in rare cases. This association (based on metagenomics) was not borne out when specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was applied to this set of samples, likely due to the greater sensitivity of PCR. Interestingly, urine metabolomics analysis identified dysregulation of metabolites associated with key LUTS processes. Microbiome analysis found no evidence of microbial community dysbiosis in LUTS cases, but JCV-positive samples contained more Anaerococcus species, which are involved in polymicrobial infections of the urinary tract. Neither age nor body mass index were significantly associated with the presence of urinary JCV—in the initial group or in an additional, regionally distinct group. These data provide preliminary support the hypothesis that viruses such as JCV may play a role in the development or progression of LUTS, together with other infectious agents and host metabolic responses."
https://openalex.org/W3130705124,"Glaucoma is a chronic neurodegenerative disease of the optic nerve and a leading cause of irreversible blindness, worldwide. While the experimental research using animal models provides growing information about cellular and molecular processes, parallel analysis of the clinical presentation of glaucoma accelerates the translational progress towards improved understanding, treatment, and clinical testing of glaucoma. Optic nerve axon injury triggers early alterations of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) synapses with function deficits prior to manifest RGC loss in animal models of glaucoma. For testing the clinical relevance of experimental observations, this study analyzed the functional correlation of localized alterations in the inner plexiform layer (IPL), where RGCs establish synaptic connections with retinal bipolar and amacrine cells. Participants of the study included a retrospective cohort of 36 eyes with glaucoma and a control group of 18 non-glaucomatous subjects followed for two-years. The IPL was analyzed on consecutively collected macular SD-OCT scans, and functional correlations with corresponding 10-2 visual field scores were tested using generalized estimating equations (GEE) models. The GEE-estimated rate of decrease in IPL thickness (R = 0.36, P<0.001) and IPL density (R = 0.36, P<0.001), as opposed to unchanged or increased IPL thickness or density, was significantly associated with visual field worsening at corresponding analysis locations. Based on multivariate logistic regression analysis, this association was independent from the patients' age, the baseline visual field scores, or the baseline thickness or alterations of retinal nerve fiber or RGC layers (P>0.05). These findings support early localized IPL alterations in correlation with progressing visual field defects in glaucomatous eyes. Considering the experimental data, glaucoma-related increase in IPL thickness/density might reflect dendritic remodeling, mitochondrial redistribution, and glial responses for synapse maintenance, but decreased IPL thickness/density might correspond to dendrite atrophy. The bridging of experimental data with clinical findings encourages further research along the translational path."
https://openalex.org/W3131326420,"This paper makes several contributions to the literature regarding the measurement of food insecurity and implications for estimating factors that affect this outcome. First, we show that receipt of benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) has a systematic effect on responses to questions in the 12-month food security module (FSM). We find that the probability of affirming more severe food hardships items, and the probability of being classified as having very low food security (VLFS), is higher just before and just after households receive their benefits. This leads to an under-estimate of VLFS by 3.2 percentage points for the SNAP sample (about 17 percent of prevalence). We also provide informative bounds on the relationship between SNAP and VLFS and show that the treatment effect of SNAP on VLFS is also likely underestimated."
https://openalex.org/W3129555722,"The hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is defined by the presence of pulmonary gas exchange abnormalities due to intrapulmonary vascular dilatations in patients with chronic liver disease. Changes in DNA methylation reflect the genomic variation. Since liver transplant (LT) reverts HPS we hypothesized that it may be associated with specific liver epigenetic changes. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of the liver epigenome in patients with HPS. We extracted DNA from paraffin embedded liver tissue samples from 10 patients with HPS and 10 age-, sex- and MELD (Model for End-stage Liver Disease)-matched controls. DNA methylation was determined using the 850K array (Illumina). Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify modules related to defining physiologic characteristics of HPS. Only 12 out of the 20 liver biopsies (7 HPS and 5 controls) had sufficient quality to be analyzed. None of the 802,688 DNA probes analyzed in the case control comparison achieved a significant False Discovery Rate (FDR). WGCNA identified 5 co-methylated gene-modules associated to HPS markers, mainly related to nervous and neuroendocrine system, apoptotic processes, gut bacterial translocation, angiogenesis and vascular remodeling ontologies. To conclude, HPS is associated with nervous/neuroendocrine system and vascular remodeling related liver epigenetic changes."
https://openalex.org/W3130073029,"Analysis with integrated assessment models (IAMs) and multisector dynamics models (MSDs) of global and national challenges and opportunities, including pursuit of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), requires projections of economic growth. In turn, the pursuit of multiple interacting goals affects economic productivity and growth, generating complex feedback loops among actions and objectives. Yet, most analysis uses either exogenous projections of productivity and growth or specifications endogenously enriched with a very small set of drivers. Extending endogenous treatment of productivity to represent two-way interactions with a significant set of goal-related variables can considerably enhance analysis. Among such variables incorporated in this project are aspects of human development (e.g., education, health, poverty reduction), socio-political change (e.g., governance capacity and quality), and infrastructure (e.g. water and sanitation and modern energy access), all in conditional interaction with underlying technological advance and economic convergence among countries. Using extensive datasets across countries and time, this project broadly endogenizes total factor productivity (TFP) within a large-scale, multi-issue IAM, the International Futures (IFs) model system. We demonstrate the utility of the resultant open system via comparison of new TFP projections with those produced for Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) scenarios, via integrated analysis of economic growth potential, and via multi-scenario analysis of progress toward the SDGs. We find that the integrated system can reproduce existing SSP projections, help anticipate differential economic progress across countries, and facilitate extended, integrated analysis of trade-offs and synergies in pursuit of the SDGs."
https://openalex.org/W3130860874,"Porphyrins are used for cancer diagnostic and therapeutic applications, but the mechanism of how porphyrins accumulate in cancer cells remains elusive. Knowledge of how porphyrins enter cancer cells can aid the development of more accurate cancer diagnostics and therapeutics. To gain insight into porphyrin uptake mechanisms in cancer cells, we developed a flow cytometry assay to quantify cellular uptake of meso-tetra (4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (TCPP), a porphyrin that is currently being developed for cancer diagnostics. We found that TCPP enters cancer cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The LDL receptor, previously implicated in the cellular uptake of other porphyrins, only contributes modestly to uptake. We report that TCPP instead binds strongly ( K D = 42 nM ) to CD320, the cellular receptor for cobalamin/transcobalamin II (Cbl/TCN2). Additionally, TCPP competes with Cbl/TCN2 for CD320 binding, suggesting that CD320 is a novel receptor for TCPP. Knockdown of CD320 inhibits TCPP uptake by up to 40% in multiple cancer cell lines, including lung, breast, and prostate cell lines, which supports our hypothesis that CD320 both binds to and transports TCPP into cancer cells. Our findings provide some novel insights into why porphyrins concentrate in cancer cells. Additionally, our study describes a novel function for the CD320 receptor which has been reported to transport only Cbl/TCN2 complexes."

https://openalex.org/W3171669806,"Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) has been widely applied in uncovering disease mechanisms and screening potential biomarkers. Internal reference gene selection determines the accuracy and reproducibility of data analyses. The aim of this study was to identify the optimal reference genes for the relative quantitative analysis of RT-qPCR in fourteen NF1 related cell lines, including non-tumor, benign and malignant Schwann cell lines. The expression characteristics of eleven candidate reference genes (RPS18, ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, PPIA, HPRT1, TBP, UBC, RPLP0, TFRC and RPL32) were screened and analyzed by four software programs: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and RefFinder. Results showed that GAPDH, the most frequently used internal reference gene, was significantly unstable between various cell lines. The combinational use of two reference genes (PPIA and TBP) was optimal in malignant Schwann cell lines and the use of single reference genes (PPIA or PRLP0) alone or in combination was optimal in benign Schwann cell lines. These recommended internal reference gene selections may improve the accuracy and reproducibility of RT-qPCR in gene expression analyses of NF1 related tumors."
https://openalex.org/W3131412265,"Objective To evaluate the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and macular thicknesses and identify systemic risk factors for thinning of these layers in patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS). Methodology A cross-sectional observational study was performed on patients diagnosed with MetS and compared to normal controls. All patients underwent ophthalmic and anthropometric examination, serological and biochemical blood investigations; and ocular imaging using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Patients with ocular pathology were excluded. Unpaired t-test was used to compare mean thickness between the two groups. One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was used to compare mean thickness between different tertiles of MetS parameters, and a generalized estimating equation was used to correct for inter-eye correlation and to assess association between mean thickness and covariates. Results Two hundred and forty-eight eyes from 124 participants (1:1 ratio of MetS patients to controls) were included. Age ranged between 30 to 50 years old, and mean age was 40 ± 6.6 years. RNFL thickness was lower globally (93.6 ± 9.9 μm vs 99.0 ± 9.3, p&lt;0.001) and in the inferior (124.5 ± 17.5 μm vs 131.0 ± 16.4 μm, p = 0.002), superior (117.2 ± 16.0 μm vs 126.3 ± 14.4 μm, p&lt;0.001) and temporal (65.5 ± 10.2 μm vs 69.5 ± 9.8, p = 0.002) sectors in MetS patients compared to controls. Only the central (237.0 ± 14.0 μm vs 243.6 ± 18.0 μm, p = 0.002) and inferior parafoveal (307.8 ± 20.9 vs 314.6 ± 14.6, p = 0.004) area of the macula was significantly thinner. The inferior RNFL sector had the most difference (mean difference = 9.1 μm). The Generalized Estimating Equation found that, after adjusting for age, diastolic blood pressure, BMI, HDL and obesity; the number of MetS components and elevated triglyceride levels were independent risk factors for reduced thickness in global RNFL (β = -4.4, 95% CI = -7.29 to -1.5, p = 0.003) and inferior parafovea (β = -6.85, 95% CI = -11.58 to -2.13, p = 0.004) thickness respectively. Conclusion RNFL thinning was seen more than macula thinning in MetS patients, suggesting RNFL susceptibility to neurodegeneration than the macula. A higher number of metabolic components and elevated triglyceride levels were independent risk factors for retinal thinning in this group of patients."
https://openalex.org/W3133366307,"Algorithms play an increasingly ubiquitous and vitally important role in modern society. However, recent findings suggest substantial individual variability in the degree to which people make use of such algorithmic systems, with some users preferring the advice of algorithms whereas others selectively avoid algorithmic systems. The mechanisms that give rise to these individual differences are currently poorly understood. Previous studies have suggested two possible effects that may underlie this variability: users may differ in their predictions of the efficacy of algorithmic systems, and/or in the relative thresholds they hold to place trust in these systems. Based on a novel judgment task with a large number of within-subject repetitions, here we report evidence that both mechanisms exert an effect on experimental participant’s degree of algorithm adherence, but, importantly, that these two mechanisms are independent from each-other. Furthermore, participants are more likely to place their trust in an algorithmically managed fund if their first exposure to the task was with an algorithmic manager. These findings open the door for future research into the mechanisms driving individual differences in algorithm adherence, and allow for novel interventions to increase adherence to algorithms."

LARS score is a patient-reported questionnaire to assess bowel dysfunction after the LAR operation. This study performed to validate the Persian (Farsi) translation of the LARS score and to investigate the psychometric properties of the score. The impact of LARS on the Quality of Life (QoL) of patients was also assessed. Materials and methods The LARS score was translated into Persian. Participants with a history of rectal cancer and low anterior resection were asked to complete the LARS score questionnaire. They were also asked a single question evaluating the impact of bowel function on QoL. Discriminative validity, convergent validity, sensitivity, and specificity of the questionnaire were calculated. A group of patients completed the score twice to assess the reliability of the questionnaire. Results From 358 patients with rectal cancer, 101 participants completed the Persian questionnaire. Answers of a high fraction of participants showed a moderate/perfect fit between their LARS score and their QoL. The Persian score demonstrated good convergent validity. It was able to differentiate between participants in terms of gender and T staging of the primary tumor. The score had high reliability. Conclusion The Persian translation of the LARS score has excellent psychometric properties compared to previous translations in other languages. Therefore, it is a valid and reliable questionnaire to assess LARS."

These extracts were subjected to successive liquid-liquid partitioning to afford bioactive CH 2 Cl 2 fractions. UHPLC-TOF-HRMS/MS and molecular networking were used to obtain an overview of the phytochemical composition of these active fractions. Aiming to isolate the active compounds, both CH 2 Cl 2 fractions were subjected to fractionation using medium pressure chromatography combined with semi-preparative HPLC-UV. Using this approach, twelve compounds ( 1 – 12 ) were isolated and identified by NMR and HRMS analysis. Several isolated compounds displayed activity against the amastigote forms of T . cruzi , especially ethyl protocatechuate ( 7 ) with EC 50 value of 18.1 μM, similar to positive control benznidazole (18.7 μM). Considering the potential of compound 7 , protocatechuic acid and its respective methyl ( 7a ), n -propyl ( 7b ), n -butyl ( 7c ), n -pentyl ( 7d ), and n -hexyl ( 7e ) esters were tested. Regarding antitrypanosomal activity, protocatechuic acid and compound 7a were inactive, while 7b-7e exhibited EC 50 values from 20.4 to 11.7 μM, without cytotoxicity to mammalian cells. These results suggest that lipophilicity and molecular complexity play an important role in the activity while efficiency analysis indicates that the natural compound 7 is a promising prototype for further modifications to obtain compounds effective against the intracellular forms of T . cruzi ."
https://openalex.org/W3133081802,"In Spanish causative constructions with dejar ‘let’ and hacer ‘make’ the subject of the embedded infinitive verb can appear in the accusative or the dative case. This case alternation has been accounted for by resorting to the notion of direct vs. indirect causation. Under this account, the accusative clitic with a transitive verb denotes direct causation while the dative clitic with an intransitive verb expresses indirect causation. The problem with this account is that we lack an independent definition of (in)direct causation in this context and so this approach suffers from circularity: the case of the clitic is used to determine causation type and causation type implies use of one or the other grammatical case. Therefore, a more objective way to account for clitic case alternation is needed. In this paper, I offer one possible solution in this direction by investigating clitic case alternation against Hopper and Thompson’s Transitivity parameters and a small number of other linguistic variables. The novelty of this approach is that I operationalise Transitivity as a weighted continuous measure (which I call the Transitivity Index) and use it to predict the case of the clitic. The results indicate that the transitivity of the infinitive verb, the animacy of the object and the agentivity of the subject are strong predictors of clitic case. Moreover, the Transitivity Index clearly shows that higher levels of Transitivity are associated with the dative clitic contrary to other contexts in which accusative is said to be more transitive. The findings in this paper allow us to arrive at a finer-grained characterization of the contexts in which each clitic case is more likely to occur and provide further evidence of the pervasiveness of Transitivity in natural language."

Participants aged 40 to 69 years were categorized into five statin groups (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, pitavastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin). The primary composite outcome was defined as recurrence of CCVD or all causes of death. Cox proportional hazard regression models were adopted after stepwise adjustments for confounders to investigate the difference in efficacy among the different statins. Of the 755 final participants, 48 patients experienced primary composite outcomes. After adjustments, the hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for primary composite outcomes of atorvastatin, pitavastatin, and rosuvastatin groups were 0.956 (0.456–2.005), 1.347 (0.354–5.116), and 0.943 (0.317–2.803), respectively, when compared with the simvastatin group. There were no significant differences between the statins in efficacy for preventing recurrence of CCVD events and/or death in CCVD patients."
https://openalex.org/W3132271103,"Children were often near the center of public debates about legal marriage recognition for same-sex couples. Obergefell v . Hodges (2015), the case that resulted in legal same-sex marriage recognition, stressed the importance of these children as one of many factors compelling the opinion. Estimates indicated same-sex couples were raising 200,000 children in the United States. Children raised by same-sex couples may be politically socialized in distinct ways compared to children of different-sex couples because lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals tend to hold distinct and progressive political viewpoints on a wide variety of issues. What are the political attitudes of people with same-sex parents? In this exploratory study, we analyze a large, representative survey of first-year college students across the United States; we find few differences between people with same-sex and different-sex parents, and some of those differences may be attributable to households and respondent characteristics. When on the rare occasion a difference exists, we find that people with same-sex female parents are more progressive, but people with same-sex male parents are more conservative. Gender differences also emerged, with some distinctive patterns between males with same-sex parents and females with same-sex parents."
https://openalex.org/W3132279497,"The paper assessed access to WASH service in the Jariban district of Somalia. One hundred and sixty-seven households were sampled to administer a questionnaire. Central tendency and logistical regression were used to analyse the data in SPSS 26. The findings show that access to safe drinking water sources is 57.5%. Of the 42.5% of respondents who did not access safe drinking water source, only 10.8% confirmed that they treat drinking water at the point of use. The main reason for household water treatment was the positive mindset (.272) of the household head towards water treatment. The majority (80.2%) of the respondents access approximately 13 litres per person per day. Woman-headed households were more likely to treat water before drinking than male-headed households. Only 26.9% of the respondents accessed basic sanitation. Of the respondents, 55.7% did not share latrines, while 44.3% share resulting in open defecation. WASH access in the study area remains low, resulting in health-related risks, including diarrhoeal disease. The limitation is that the paper only focused on access to WASH facilities in fragile contexts. A cross-sectional analysis of biological, physical and chemical properties of water at the source and point of use is recommended for further research."
https://openalex.org/W3133199527,"Background/Objective High tibial osteotomy (HTO) is a common treatment for medial knee arthrosis. However, a high rate of complications associated with a plate and a significant loss of correction have been reported. Therefore, an internal support block (ISB) is designed to enhance the initial stability of the fixation device that is important for successful bone healing and maintenance of the correction angle of the osteotomy site. The purpose of this study was performed to examine if an internal support block combined with a plate reduces the stress on the plate and screw area. Methods Finite element models were reconstructed following three different implant combinations. Two loading conditions were applied to simulate standing and initial sit-to-stand postures. Data analysis was conducted to evaluate the axial displacement of the posteromedial tibial plateau, which represents the loss of the posteromedial tibial plateau in clinical observation. Moreover, the stresses on the bone plate and locking screws were evaluated. Results Compared to the TomoFix plate, the ISB reduced the axial displacement by 73% and 76% in standing and initial sit-to-stand loading conditions, respectively. The plate with an ISB reduced stress by 90% on the bone plate and by 73% on the locking screw during standing compared to the standalone TomoFix plate. During the initial sit-to-stand loading condition, the ISB reduced the stress by 93% and 77% on the bone plate and the locking screw, respectively. Conclusion The addition of the PEEK block showed a benefit for structural stability in the osteotomy site. However, further clinical trials are necessary to evaluate the clinical benefit of reduced implant stress and the internal support block on the healing of the medial bone tissue."
https://openalex.org/W3130701887,"Athletes undergoing energy restriction for weight/fat reduction sometimes apply ‘diet breaks’ involving increased energy intake, but there is little empirical evidence of effects on outcomes. Twenty-six resistance-trained athletes (11/26 or 42% female) who had completed 12 weeks of intermittent energy restriction participated in this study. Participants had a mean (SD) age of 29.3 (6.4) years, a weight of 72.7 (15.9) kg, and a body fat percentage of 21.3 (7.5) %. During the 1-week diet break, energy intake was increased (by means of increased carbohydrate intake) to predicted weight maintenance requirements. While the 1-week diet break had no significant effect on fat mass, it led to small but significant increases in mean body weight (0.6 kg, P &lt;0.001), fat-free mass (0.7 kg, P &lt;0.001) and in resting energy expenditure, from a mean (and 95% confidence interval) of 7000 (6420 to 7580) kJ/day to 7200 (6620 to 7780) kJ/day ( P = 0.026). Overall, muscle endurance in the legs (but not arms) improved after the diet break, including significant increases in the work completed by the quadriceps and hamstrings in a maximum-effort 25-repetition set, with values increasing from 2530 (2170 to 2890) J to 2660 (2310 to 3010) J ( P = 0.018) and from 1280 (1130 to 1430) J to 1380 (1220 to 1540) J ( P = 0.018) following the diet break, respectively. However, muscle strength did not change. Participants reported significantly lower sensations of hunger ( P = 0.017), prospective consumption ( P = 0.020) and irritability ( P = 0.041) after the diet break, and significantly higher sensations of fullness ( P = 0.002), satisfaction ( P = 0.002), and alertness ( P = 0.003). In summary, a 1-week diet break improved muscle endurance in the legs and increased mental alertness, and reduced appetite and irritability. With this considered, it may be wise for athletes to coordinate diet breaks with training sessions that require muscle endurance of the legs and/or mental focus, as well as in the latter parts of a weight loss phase when increases in appetite might threaten dietary adherence.

https://openalex.org/W3133001797,"We performed whole-genome multi-locus sequence typing for 2554 genes in a large and heterogenous panel of 180 Listeria monocytogenes strains having diverse geographical and temporal origins. The subtyping data was used for characterizing genetic variation and evaluating patterns of linkage disequilibrium in the pan-genome of L . monocytogenes . Our analysis revealed the presence of strong linkage disequilibrium in L . monocytogenes , with ~99% of genes showing significant non-random associations with a large majority of other genes in the genome. Twenty-seven loci having lower levels of association with other genes were considered to be potential “hot spots” for horizontal gene transfer (i.e., recombination via conjugation, transduction, and/or transformation). The patterns of linkage disequilibrium in L . monocytogenes suggest limited exchange of foreign genetic material in the genome and can be used as a tool for identifying new recombinant strains. This can help understand processes contributing to the diversification and evolution of this pathogenic bacteria, thereby facilitating development of effective control measures."
