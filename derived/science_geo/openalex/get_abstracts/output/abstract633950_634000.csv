https://openalex.org/W2948003108,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) manifests as alterations in complex human behaviors including social communication and stereotypies. In addition to genetic risks, the gut microbiome differs between typically developing (TD) and ASD individuals, though it remains unclear whether the microbiome contributes to symptoms. We transplanted gut microbiota from human donors with ASD or TD controls into germ-free mice and reveal that colonization with ASD microbiota is sufficient to induce hallmark autistic behaviors. The brains of mice colonized with ASD microbiota display alternative splicing of ASD-relevant genes. Microbiome and metabolome profiles of mice harboring human microbiota predict that specific bacterial taxa and their metabolites modulate ASD behaviors. Indeed, treatment of an ASD mouse model with candidate microbial metabolites improves behavioral abnormalities and modulates neuronal excitability in the brain. We propose that the gut microbiota regulates behaviors in mice via production of neuroactive metabolites, suggesting that gut-brain connections contribute to the pathophysiology of ASD."
https://openalex.org/W2947105529,"Mammals rely on a network of circadian clocks to control daily systemic metabolism and physiology. The central pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is considered hierarchically dominant over peripheral clocks, whose degree of independence, or tissue-level autonomy, has never been ascertained in vivo. Using arrhythmic Bmal1-null mice, we generated animals with reconstituted circadian expression of BMAL1 exclusively in the liver (Liver-RE). High-throughput transcriptomics and metabolomics show that the liver has independent circadian functions specific for metabolic processes such as the NAD+ salvage pathway and glycogen turnover. However, although BMAL1 occupies chromatin at most genomic targets in Liver-RE mice, circadian expression is restricted to ∼10% of normally rhythmic transcripts. Finally, rhythmic clock gene expression is lost in Liver-RE mice under constant darkness. Hence, full circadian function in the liver depends on signals emanating from other clocks, and light contributes to tissue-autonomous clock function."
https://openalex.org/W2947535015,"Ectopic lipid deposition and altered mitochondrial dynamics contribute to the development of obesity and insulin resistance. However, the mechanistic link between these processes remained unclear. Here we demonstrate that the C16:0 sphingolipid synthesizing ceramide synthases, CerS5 and CerS6, affect distinct sphingolipid pools and that abrogation of CerS6 but not of CerS5 protects from obesity and insulin resistance. We identify proteins that specifically interact with C16:0 sphingolipids derived from CerS5 or CerS6. Here, only CerS6-derived C16:0 sphingolipids bind the mitochondrial fission factor (Mff). CerS6 and Mff deficiency protect from fatty acid-induced mitochondrial fragmentation in vitro, and the two proteins genetically interact in vivo in obesity-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and development of insulin resistance. Our experiments reveal an unprecedented specificity of sphingolipid signaling depending on specific synthesizing enzymes, provide a mechanistic link between hepatic lipid deposition and mitochondrial fragmentation in obesity, and define the CerS6-derived sphingolipid/Mff interaction as a therapeutic target for metabolic diseases."

These structures elucidate the modes of action of different Cav ligands and establish a framework for structure-guided drug discovery. The widely distributed voltage-gated Ca2+ (Cav) channels participate in a broad range of physiological processes, such as contraction, secretion, and cell death (Catterall, 2011Catterall W.A. Voltage-gated calcium channels.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2011; 3: a003947Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar, Clapham, 2007Clapham D.E. Calcium signaling.Cell. 2007; 131: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2932) Google Scholar). In mammals, 10 subtypes of Cav channels were classified to three subfamilies: Cav1 (Cav1.1–Cav1.4), Cav2 (Cav2.1–Cav2.3), and Cav3 (Cav3.1–Cav3.3) (Ertel et al., 2000Ertel E.A. Campbell K.P. Harpold M.M. Hofmann F. Mori Y. Perez-Reyes E. Schwartz A. Snutch T.P. Tanabe T.

Fox A.P. Tsien R.W. Three types of neuronal calcium channel with different calcium agonist sensitivity.Nature. 1985; 316: 440-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar). The Cav1 channels, also known as the L-type Cav or DHPRs for dihydropyridine receptors, exist as hetero-multimeric complexes containing the pore-forming α1 core subunit and auxiliary subunits α2δ, β, and γ. The α1 subunit of Cav channels consists of ∼2,000 residues that fold to four homologous repeats I–IV. Each repeat, conforming to the canonical voltage-gated ion channel (VGIC) fold, comprises six transmembrane segments, S1–S6, which constitute two functional entities. The S1–S4 segments in each repeat form the peripheral voltage sensing domain (VSD); S5 and S6, together with the intervening segments, including the selectivity filters (SF) and the supporting helices P1 and P2, from the four repeats, enclose the central ion-conducting pore domain (Catterall, 2011Catterall W.A.

Three types of neuronal calcium channel with different calcium agonist sensitivity.Nature. 1985; 316: 440-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar). Consistent with their physiological importance, aberrant regulation or malfunction of Cav channels is associated with a variety of neurological, cardiovascular, muscular, and psychiatric disorders, such as cardiac arrhythmias, migraine, seizures, hypokalemic periodic paralysis, autism spectrum disorder, and Parkinson’s disease (Catterall, 2011Catterall W.A.

The Physiology, Pathology, and Pharmacology of Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels and Their Future Therapeutic Potential.Pharmacol. Rev. 2015; 67: 821-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Therefore, Cav channels represent important drug targets. Three major classes of L-type Ca2+ channels antagonists, dihydropyridines (DHP), benzothiazepines (BTZ), and phenylalkylamines (PAA), have been in clinical use for decades (Dolphin, 2006Dolphin A.C. A short history of voltage-gated calcium channels.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 147: S56-S62Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, Hockerman et al., 1997bHockerman G.H. Peterson B.Z. Johnson B.D.

Targeting voltage-gated calcium channels in neurological and psychiatric diseases.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2016; 15: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Among these, the DHP compounds have been widely used for the treatment of hypertension, angina pectoris, Raynaud’s phenomenon, and premature labor in the past half-century (Figure S1A) (Dolphin, 2006Dolphin A.C. A short history of voltage-gated calcium channels.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 147: S56-S62Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, Kiowski et al., 1990Kiowski W. Erne P. Bühler F.R.

As the respective prototype of BTZ and PAA drugs, diltiazem and verapamil both show vasodilating effect and have been used for the treatment of angina pectoris, hypertension, certain cardiac arrhythmias, and supraventricular tachycardia (Hockerman et al., 1997bHockerman G.H.

While diltiazem and verapamil are pore blockers, DHP antagonists function through allosteric effects (Hockerman et al., 1997bHockerman G.H. Peterson B.Z. Johnson B.D. Catterall W.A. Molecular determinants of drug binding and action on L-type calcium channels.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 361-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even more intriguing, some compounds that are structurally similar to DHP antagonists exhibit agonistic effects on L-type Cav channels (Figure S1). Of particular note, DHP compounds exhibit stereo-selective activities (Goldmann and Stoltefuss, 1991Goldmann S. Stoltefuss J. 1,4-Dihydropyridines - Effects of Chirality and Conformation on the Calcium-Antagonist and Calcium Agonist Activities.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1991; 30: 1559-1578Crossref Scopus (509) Google Scholar). For instance, the stereoisomer of the potent agonist, (S)-(−)-Bay K 8644, exhibits an antagonistic effect on Cav channels (Franckowiak et al., 1985Franckowiak G. Bechem M. Schramm M. Thomas G. The optical isomers of the 1,4-dihydropyridine BAY K 8644 show opposite effects on Ca channels.Eur. J.

Novel dihydropyridines with positive inotropic action through activation of Ca2+ channels.Nature. 1983; 303: 535-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar) (Figures S1A and S1B). For simplicity, we will use Bay K 8644 to refer to the agonist when stereo-selectivity is not discussed. Photolabeling, chimeric screening, and mutagenesis analyses provided important clues to the binding and mode of action of DHP ligands (Gurney et al., 1985Gurney A.M. Nerbonne J.M. Lester H.A.

The antagonists favor the inactivated state, whereas the agonists lead to prolonged opening of the L-type Cav channels (Affolter and Coronado, 1985Affolter H. Coronado R.

Crystal structures were determined for an engineered bacterial homolog, CavAb, in complex with several DHP antagonists and verapamil (Tang et al., 2016Tang L. Gamal El-Din T.M. Swanson T.M. Pryde D.C. Scheuer T. Zheng N. Catterall W.A. Structural basis for inhibition of a voltage-gated Ca2+ channel by Ca2+ antagonist drugs.Nature. 2016; 537: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, the DHP binding site on CavAb barely overlapped with the one derived from functional characterizations (Table S1). Considering the remote distance between the homotetrameric CavAb and the single-chain eukaryotic Cav channels, structures of L-type Cav channels bound to representative ligands are necessary to unveil the molecular basis for the distinct modes of action of the DHP antagonists and agonists. An atomic structural model of the rabbit Cav1.1 complex, containing all of the subunits, was obtained using single particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) (Wu et al., 2015Wu J. Yan Z. Li Z. Yan C. Lu S. Dong M. Yan N. Structure of the voltage-gated calcium channel Cav1.1 complex.Science. 2015; 350: aad2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, Wu et al., 2016Wu J. Yan Z. Li Z. Qian X.

Owing to the technical difficulties in producing recombinant Cav proteins for structural analysis, the rabbit Cav1.1 (rCav1.1) remains to be the only eukaryotic Cav channel whose structure is available. Most of the previously characterized residues that are involved in binding to these compounds are conserved in rCav1.1 (Table S1). We, therefore, sought to determine the structures of rCav1.1 in complex with prototypical antagonists and agonists. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of rCav1.1 bound to DHP antagonist, nifedipine, and agonist, Bay K 8644, at overall resolutions of 2.9 Å and 2.8 Å, respectively, and in complex with two representative BTZ and PAA drugs, diltiazem and verapamil, at 3.0 Å and 2.7 Å, respectively. The rCav1.1 complex was purified following the same protocol as previously reported (Wu et al., 2015Wu J. Yan Z. Li Z. Yan C. Lu S. Dong M. Yan N. Structure of the voltage-gated calcium channel Cav1.1 complex.Science. 2015; 350: aad2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The peak fractions, from last-step size-exclusion chromatography purification, were pooled and incubated with the indicated compounds for 20 min before being concentrated for cryo-sample preparation. The cryo-grids were made following standard protocol and images were collected on a Titan Krios electron microscope operating at 300 kV and equipped with a K2 summit direct detector, a Gif Quantum energy filter, and spherical aberration image corrector. EM maps of the four rCav1.1 complexes were obtained at abovementioned resolutions. For simplicity, we will refer to the four structures as rCav1.1-N/B/D/V (N for nifedipine, B for Bay K 8644, D for diltiazem, and V for verapamil). After applying a mask to the central region during postprocessing, the resolutions for the ligand-bound pore domain of rCav1.1-N/B/D/V reached 2.8 Å, 2.7 Å, 2.9 Å, and 2.6 Å, respectively (Figures 1, S2, and S3; Table S2).Figure S2Cryo-EM Analysis of Rabbit Cav1.1 in Complex with Ligands, Related to Figure 1 and Table S2Show full caption(A) Representative micrograph of the Cav1.1 complex in the presence of nifedipine (rCav1.1-N).

Details can be found in the “Image processing” session in STAR Methods. The overall structures of rCav1.1-N/B/D are nearly identical. The structures of the α1 subunit of rCav1.1-B/D can be superimposed to that of rCav1.1-N with root-mean-square deviation of 0.416 Å over 1,033 Cα atoms and 0.471 Å over 1,156 Cα atoms, respectively. In these three structures, the intracellular gate is closed and all four VSDs exhibit depolarized conformations, characteristic of an inactivated state. Although the procedure for protein generation and cryo-sample preparation was identical to our previous structural study of ligand-free rCav1.1 (Wu et al., 2016Wu J. Yan Z. Li Z. Qian X. Lu S. Dong M. Zhou Q. Yan N.

For simplicity, we will refer to the conformation of the ligand-free structure at 3.6 Å (PDB: 5GJV) as class I and that of rCav1.1-N/B/D as class II. The structure of rCav1.1-V exhibits further conformational shifts (class III) that will be illustrated later. eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJiZDlkNTkzYzIzNGFlOWVjNzU2NGZmYmIzYjU2NzNmZCIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4MjA4NDAzfQ.dZimZThWi9wWPFC3SV1L5VEzFw49tN3n0ElWseFZRPkvY5AnOFSWz3deKAuRKCYYWPf7vK8F3djhBUOUG-l20n70I3PVe5QBXdii5F2YET6b9VMNDpCu_TtYWDERdNjKiIcyZ17y3I0gD70UHZh5ig7IGiyO_ypfanh96Mv6SUCUlQwHIE8HtmOGt46I0ZBBQKtWrfG1wwNyOgRR93vWrmwWBc_C3ryO_fxEpB9Fal24SQvhNlV6pkUAbHRfJjJNBIYB6SVt2jgsSroIS91oOczgJhubSKGkIJtAo1Fj4XNqb4RyVRJ58XEUDhvxRYZEYJjak9uzBOwaYg5q-FuFOA Download .mp4 (17.8 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S1.

The S6 segments in repeats I-III of rCav1.1-N/B/D all contain a π-helical turn at a conserved Phe residue (Phe 323/656/1054), resulting in rotation of the ensuing fragments in these S6 segments from that in class I (Figures S4A–S4C). In addition, S6I, which is kinked at the locus adjacent to the intracellular gate in class I, straightens up in rCav1.1-N/B/D (Figure S4D). Accompanying these structural rearrangements, the fenestrations on the interfaces between repeats I and IV and between II and III are closed in rCav1.1-N/B/D (Video S2). eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJmMjJhNjdlYjk5ZTIwYWU2ZTc0MzZmNmQxMzc5NWIzYiIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4MjA4NDAzfQ.hxBOcGqygCMHew_2f-XCe9dIWhqwEES2PphdCndtAlz0qzDujYVDZZ8DaDa6KgRZhr9m2hXxo1uoZ7TzJv8odrURFGquOHOdzLVJiTRHSdlCR531OrM50khkxTT1byysnU4V_8EnOLd544FQBVQwbHEPKqihO8pe2PxyE9jtrygMBhg_gtbt2tbn2MUgpytMvwDLUhcf47L77SbZBwc9L7-PzY-awdLLSS6xv2xkVbMi1p29SFqC5BFcEH-mm-jy6UXc1RXncsaPW-feNT9G1gTtatWtE4b9uBnbYEFgK3t0TMdLpmb4Q9gfPPeSnQo6iUZHcqsl1Vv7xsA5ZXYfqQ Download .mp4 (15.11 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S2.

Binding of nifedipine appears to bring S5III and S6IV closer to each other, compared to the class I conformation (Figure S4C). Unlike most DHP compounds that have chirality, nifedipine is a symmetric molecule with the pyridine and phenyl rings approximately perpendicular to each other (Figure 2A). Nevertheless, the coordination of nifedipine by Cav1.1 is asymmetric with a binary, amphiphilic mode. On one side of the phenyl ring, several well-characterized polar residues on S5III and P1III form hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) with the N1 amine and the C3-ester. The rest of nifedipine is embedded in a hydrophobic environment constituted by residues mainly on P1III, S6III, and S6IV (Figure 2B, inset). The N1 amine of DHP compounds was shown to be essential because modification of this site would lead to loss of activity (Goldmann and Stoltefuss, 1991Goldmann S.

Here, we describe a previously unknown lymphocyte that is a dual expresser (DE) of TCR and BCR and key lineage markers of both B and T cells. In type 1 diabetes (T1D), DEs are predominated by one clonotype that encodes a potent CD4 T cell autoantigen in its antigen binding site. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that this peptide has an optimal binding register for diabetogenic HLA-DQ8. In concordance, a synthetic version of the peptide forms stable DQ8 complexes and potently stimulates autoreactive CD4 T cells from T1D patients, but not healthy controls. Moreover, mAbs bearing this clonotype are autoreactive against CD4 T cells and inhibit insulin tetramer binding to CD4 T cells. Thus, compartmentalization of adaptive immune cells into T and B cells is not absolute, and violators of this paradigm are likely key drivers of autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2952278313,"The scaling of organelles with cell size is thought to be exclusive to eukaryotes. Here, we demonstrate that similar scaling relationships hold for the bacterial nucleoid. Despite the absence of a nuclear membrane, nucleoid size strongly correlates with cell size, independent of changes in DNA amount and across various nutrient conditions. This correlation is observed in diverse bacteria, revealing a near-constant ratio between nucleoid and cell size for a given species. As in eukaryotes, the nucleocytoplasmic ratio in bacteria varies greatly among species. This spectrum of nucleocytoplasmic ratios is independent of genome size, and instead it appears linked to the average population cell size. Bacteria with different nucleocytoplasmic ratios have a cytoplasm with different biophysical properties, impacting ribosome mobility and localization. Together, our findings identify new organizational principles and biophysical features of bacterial cells, implicating the nucleocytoplasmic ratio and cell size as determinants of the intracellular organization of translation."

We examined input- and cell-type-specific changes in thalamo- and intracortical pathways during learning using an automated, home-cage sensory association training (SAT) paradigm coupling multi-whisker stimulation to a water reward. We found that the posterior medial nucleus (POm) but not the ventral posterior medial (VPM) nucleus of the thalamus drives increased cortical activity after 24 h of SAT, when behavioral evidence of learning first emerges. Synaptic strengthening within the POm thalamocortical pathway was first observed at thalamic inputs to L5 and was not generated by sensory stimulation alone. Synaptic changes in L2 were delayed relative to L5, requiring 48 h of SAT to drive synaptic plasticity at thalamic and intracortical inputs onto L2 Pyr neurons. These data identify the POm thalamocortical circuit as a site of rapid synaptic plasticity during learning and suggest a temporal sequence to learning-evoked synaptic changes in the sensory cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2947514197,"The invasion of the Western Hemisphere native fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda; J. E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) into the Eastern Hemisphere has been notable for the rapidity and geographical breadth of new detections. In the year following the first discovery in western sub-Saharan Africa in 2016, infestations have been documented in most sub-Saharan maize growing regions and has now expanded beyond Africa with populations recently reported in India. These observations could indicate a remarkable capacity for rapid establishment and long-distance dissemination. However, while fall armyworm does exhibit extended migration in North America where it annually traverses thousands of kilometers, this behavior is known to be dependent on highly favorable wind patterns and so can’t be assumed to occur in all locations. An alternative possibility is that the species has long been present in Africa, and perhaps the rest of the hemisphere, but was undetected until the enhanced monitoring that resulted after its initial discovery. Determining whether the fall armyworm in the Eastern Hemisphere is newly arrived or long pre-existing is important for assessing the risks of significant economic impacts, as the former indicates a change in pest composition while the latter does not. This study examined this issue by comparing collections from two geographically distant locations, South Africa and India. Sequence comparisons were used to quantify differences between the South Africa and India collections, assess the likelihood of their sharing a common source population, and their possible relationship with previously characterized fall armyworm from other regions of Africa. The results indicate genetic homogeneity between the South African and Indian fall armyworm populations tested and substantial similarities between these and collections from eastern Africa. The implications of these findings on fall armyworm population behavior and composition are discussed."

Although informal providers are involved with substantial segments of primary healthcare, their level of knowledge, attitudes, and practices is not well documented in the literature.This quantitative study systematically examines the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of informal and formal providers with respect to antibiotic use.We surveyed a convenience sample of 384 participants (96 allopathic doctors, 96 nurses, 96 informal providers, and 96 pharmacy shopkeepers) over a period of 8 weeks from December to February using a validated questionnaire developed in Italy. Our team created an equivalent, composite KAP score for each respondent in the survey, which was subsequently compared between providers. We then performed a multivariate logistic regression analysis to estimate the odds of having a low composite score (<80) based on occupation by comparing allopathic doctors (referent category) with all other study participants. The model was adjusted for age (included as a continuous variable) and gender.Doctors scored highest in questions assessing knowledge (77.3%) and attitudes (87.3%), but performed poorly in practices (67.6%). Many doctors knew that antibiotics were not indicated for viral infections, but over 87% (n = 82) reported prescribing them in this situation. Nurses, pharmacy shopkeepers, and informal providers were more likely to perform poorly on the survey compared to allopathic doctors (OR: 10.4, 95% CI 5.4, 20.0, p<0.01). 30.8% (n = 118) of all providers relied on pharmaceutical company representatives as a major source of information about antibiotics.Our findings indicate poor knowledge and awareness of antibiotic use and functions among informal health providers, and dissonance between knowledge and practices among allopathic doctors. The nexus between allopathic doctors, pharmaceutical company representatives, and informal health providers present promising avenues for future research and intervention."

A critical step in collagen fibril formation is the proteolytic removal of N- and C-terminal propeptides from procollagens by metalloproteinases of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) and BMP1 (bone morphogenetic protein 1)/Tolloid-like families, respectively.

We noted that the LOX sequence between the BMP1- and ADAMTS-processing sites contains several conserved tyrosine residues, of which some are post-translationally modified by tyrosine O-sulfation and contribute to binding to collagen.

This ECM not only provides structural support for resident cells but also influences various cellular processes, including proliferation, adhesion, migration, and differentiation, as well as plays key roles in homeostasis and the regeneration of tissues and organs (1Engel J. Chiquet M. Mecham R.P. The Extracellular Matrix: an Overview. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg2011: 1-39Google Scholar). Although the composition of the ECM can vary markedly, collagens are the main component conforming the structural matrix core and are fundamental to providing the connective tissues with their biomechanical properties. In vertebrates, 28 types of collagens have been described (I–XXVIII), which are classified into several families, including the fibrillar collagen family (I–III, V, XI, XXIV, and XXVII) and basement membrane-forming collagen IV (2Kadler K.E. Baldock C. Bella J. Boot-Handford R.P. Collagens at a glance.J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120 (17550969): 1955-195810.1242/jcs.03453Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Fibrillar collagens form homotrimeric (three identical α-chains) or heterotrimeric (two or three distinct polypeptide chains) molecules. Each α-chain consists of a major uninterrupted triple helical or collagenous domain (characterized by a repetition of Gly-Xaa-Yaa triplets, where Xaa and Yaa are commonly proline and hydroxyproline, respectively) flanked by N- and C-terminal noncollagenous domains, the N- and C-propeptides (3Canty E.G. Kadler K.E. Procollagen trafficking, processing and fibrillogenesis.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118 (15788652): 1341-135310.1242/jcs.01731Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Once synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum, these collagen chains are brought together in a process governed by the C-propeptides and folded to form the procollagen molecule. Upon transit through the Golgi network and extracellular secretion, the N- and C-propeptides are cleaved off, respectively, by the procollagen N-proteinases belonging to the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family (ADAMTS2, -3, and -14) and by C-proteinases, which are BMP1 (bone morphogenetic protein 1)/Tolloid-like enzymes. These proteolytic events yield triple helical collagen molecules that retain only a short portion of the propeptides, the telopeptides, and are able to assemble into fibrils, the most recognizable signature of collagen-based extracellular structures (3Canty E.G.

The mechanical strength of the extracellular collagenous matrix is highly dependent on the formation of covalent cross-links within fibrils, a process initiated by the enzymatic action of lysyl oxidase (LOX) (4Eyre D.R.

LOX catalyzes the oxidative deamination of lysine and hydroxylysine residues within the telopeptide domains, yielding the corresponding aldehydes, which eventually condense with other oxidized groups or intact lysines to form a variety of inter- and intrachain cross-linkages. Five different LOX enzymes have been identified in mammals (LOX and LOX-like 1–4), with the canonical LOX being the isoform most clearly associated with the remodeling and stability of the collagen matrix, described to play important roles in fibrosis, tumor microenvironment, and tissue repair (5Grau-Bové X. Ruiz-Trillo I. Rodriguez-Pascual F. Origin and evolution of lysyl oxidases.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5 (26024311): 1056810.1038/srep10568Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 6Rodriguez-Pascual F.

Proteolysis is crucial in the process of collagen synthesis and assembly. Not only are proteolytic events responsible for the removal of the propeptides, but also one of involved proteases, namely BMP1, cleaves the LOX precursor to generate the propeptide, for which biological activities have been also reported, and the fully active LOX (7Trackman P.C.

The molecular mechanisms leading to this behavior, which may arise not only by alternative proteolytic processing but also because of post-translational modifications (PTM), have not been established, and its study might indeed shed fresh light on the biological function of LOX. In this context, we recently identified, using a large-scale and nonbiased approach, that LOX is a potential substrate of ADAMTS14, although a complete characterization of this potential proteolysis remains to be investigated, as well as its relevance in the regulation of LOX (15Bekhouche M. Leduc C. Dupont L. Janssen L. Delolme F. Vadon-Le Goff S. Smargiasso N. Baiwir D. Mazzucchelli G. Zanella-Cleon I. Dubail J. De Pauw E. Nusgens B. Hulmes D.J. Moali C. Colige A.

Here, we describe that LOX is proteolytically processed by ADAMTS2 and -14, but not ADAMTS3, between residues Asp-218 and Tyr-219, at a site located 50 amino acids downstream of the well-characterized BMP1 cleavage site. Protein segment flanked by both processing sites contains a number of conserved tyrosine residues that can be potentially modified by tyrosine O-sulfation, which we confirmed by different methodological approaches, including proteomic characterization. Although we have shown that the LOX precursor and the forms processed by BMP1 or ADAMTS2/14 proteases displayed similar enzymatic activity on a soluble substrate, they substantially differed in their capacity to bind collagen, with the sulfotyrosine residues playing an important role in the interaction. Taken together, these results point to a mechanism for the regulation of the binding and the activity of LOX on collagen, resulting from the differential cleavage by BMP1 and ADAMTS2/14 of a tyrosine sulfate domain. By using a polyclonal antibody that specifically recognizes the C-terminal end of LOX protein, we have analyzed the electrophoretic pattern of LOX secreted from human lung fibroblasts and bovine endothelial cells incubated for 4 days in the presence or absence of the cytokine transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), a well-known activator of LOX expression (16Boak A.M. Roy R. Berk J. Taylor L. Polgar P. Goldstein R.H. Kagan H.M. Regulation of lysyl oxidase expression in lung fibroblasts by transforming growth factor-β1 and prostaglandin E2.Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 11 (7946403): 751-75510.1165/ajrcmb.11.6.7946403Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, the supernatant of fibroblasts or endothelial cells showed multiple immunoreactive bands ranging from 25 to 30 kDa, whose levels strongly increased upon incubation with TGF-β1. To analyze how this pattern arises, we have generated a human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cell clone stably expressing a human LOX construct under tetracycline-dependent control. Fig. 1B shows the LOX immunoreactivity associated with cells (cell extract) or secreted into the extracellular medium (supernatant) in basal conditions or upon stimulation with doxycycline, a tetracycline analog. Although only a very faint band of about 50 kDa, corresponding to the intracellular precursor, was observed in the extracts from stimulated cells, significantly higher levels were secreted to the extracellular medium, including the precursor and multiple bands at 25–30 kDa. In contrast to fibroblast and endothelial cultures, where precursor bands were not detected under our experimental conditions, HEK293 cell clone displayed a limited capacity to process LOX as indicated by the accumulation of the unprocessed form, a circumstance providing the possibility to use this cell line to analyze the molecular events associated to the generation of mature forms. We have previously identified LOX as a potential substrate of ADAMTS14 in the secretome of human fibroblasts (15Bekhouche M. Leduc C. Dupont L. Janssen L. Delolme F. Vadon-Le Goff S. Smargiasso N. Baiwir D. Mazzucchelli G. Zanella-Cleon I. Dubail J. De Pauw E. Nusgens B. Hulmes D.J. Moali C. Colige A. Determination of the substrate repertoire of ADAMTS2, 3, and 14 significantly broadens their functions and identifies extracellular matrix organization and TGF-β signaling as primary targets.FASEB J. 2016; 30 (26740262): 1741-175610.1096/fj.15-279869Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Here, we used two methodological approaches to characterize the ability of the procollagen N-proteinases, ADAMTS2, -3, and -14, to cleave LOX. Having generated HEK293 cell clones stably expressing the human forms of these ADAMTS proteases only in the presence of doxycycline (Fig. S1), we co-cultured them with HEK293 cells able to conditionally secrete LOX. After 48 h of co-culture with or without doxycycline, the LOX pattern was evaluated by immunoblotting (Fig. 2, A and B). Expression of ADAMTS2 and ADAMTS14 resulted in a relative enrichment of mature forms of LOX around 25 kDa, at the expense of bands at 30 kDa, strongly suggesting a proteolytic processing. Such cleavage was not observed for ADAMTS3. It has to be mentioned that HEK293 cells display significant endogenous BMP1, which explains the conversion of precursor LOX into forms migrating around 30 kDa. We have also established an in vitro assay for the analysis of LOX cleavage by incubation of concentrated supernatants from LOX-overexpressing clone and purified preparations of ADAMTS2 and ADAMTS14, and we compared their effects with that of concentrated supernatants from HEK293 cells overexpressing BMP1 (Fig. S1 and Fig. 2, C and D). Similar to data obtained in co-cultures, incubation with ADAMTS2 and ADAMTS14 resulted in a time-dependent reduction of the abundance of the 50-kDa LOX precursor and a concomitant accumulation of the mature form at 25 kDa. In contrast, incubation with BMP1 led to an enrichment of the processed forms around 30 kDa, clearly indicating that ADAMTS enzymes process LOX in a different location, presumably downstream from the established BMP1 site. This aspect was further confirmed by complete proteolysis by BMP1 and addition of ADAMTS14 on top of the BMP1-processed form (Fig. 2E). We then applied a proteomic approach to determine at which site LOX is cleaved by ADAMTS2/14. For that purpose, LOX supernatants exposed to ADAMTS2 were filtered through a 50-kDa-cutoff centrifugal filter to enrich the samples in LOX mature forms (Fig. S2). Flow-throughs were trypsin-digested, and peptides were analyzed by MS (Fig. 3). Several LOX peptides were identified that resulted from trypsin digestion at both their N- and C-terminal ends, except one hemitryptic (a peptide cleaved by trypsin in one end and another protease in the other end), i.e. cleaved by trypsin at the C terminus but not at the N terminus, presumably obtained by ADAMTS2-dependent action. In fact, careful inspection of this potential processing site within the LOX sequence revealed its location 50 residues downstream of the well-established BMP1 site, an observation that fully matches with the molecular weight of the ADAMTS2/14-processed form as observed by immunoblotting. Analysis of LOX protein sequence shows that both BMP1 (MVG/DDP) and ADAMTS (VAD/PYY) sites are well-conserved among several organisms (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the Asp/Pro scissile bond cleaved by ADAMTS2 and -14 is also conserved in LOX forms evolutionarily close to the canonical LOX, such as lysyl oxidase-like (LOXL) isoform 1 or the zebrafish LOXL5 (a sort of hybrid LOX/LOXL1 uniquely present in this teleost fish). By contrast, the more evolutionarily distant LOXL2, LOXL3, and LOXL4 isoforms display no homology in the corresponding position, despite the overall conservation observed in the downstream catalytic domain (5Grau-Bové X. Ruiz-Trillo I. Rodriguez-Pascual F. Origin and evolution of lysyl oxidases.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5 (26024311): 1056810.1038/srep10568Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This observation predicts that LOXL1 and LOXL5 proteins might be also substrates of ADAMTS proteases.Figure 4Multiple sequence alignments of ADAMTS cleavage site and flanking sequences. A, sequence alignment of LOX orthologs from the indicated species showing high homology at the ADAMTS and BMP1 cleavage sites and also in between. B, sequence alignment of ADAMTS cleavage site and downstream sequences from LOX orthologs and paralogs from the indicated species. Of note is the high degree of homology observed between the cleavage site characterized in human LOX and corresponding sequences of human LOXL1 and the zebrafish LOX, LOXL1, and LOXL5 isoforms. On the contrary, no significant homology was found among LOXL2, LOXL3, and LOXL4 paralogs, despite the conservation observed in the downstream histidine-rich catalytic core.

Ehx G. Chantry M. Monseur C. Leduc C. Janssen L. Cataldo D. Thiry M. Jerome C. Thomassin J.M. Nusgens B. Dubail J. Baron F. Colige A. Spontaneous atopic dermatitis due to immune dysregulation in mice lacking Adamts2 and 14.Matrix Biol. 2018; 70 (29649548): 140-15710.1016/j.matbio.2018.04.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These fibroblasts were left untreated or were incubated with TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml during 48 h). Conditioned media were then analyzed by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 5, for WT fibroblasts incubated with TGF-β1, the vast majority of the LOX signal was detected around 25 kDa, which corresponds to the ADAMTS2/14 processed forms. By contrast, upon induction with TGF-β1, fibroblasts from the double knockout showed a diminishing of the 25-kDa product with respect to WT, without significantly affecting the BMP1 product at 30 kDa, which demonstrates the participation of ADAMTS2/14 in the maturation of LOX. Examination of the LOX immunoreactive bands throughout this study showed that they are actually formed by multiple molecular species differing slightly in their electrophoretic mobility, a behavior typically arising from extensive PTM. We have investigated this possibility by two-dimensional (2D) electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 6, precursor and mature forms of LOX are visualized as several spots. Interestingly, LOX precursor at 50 kDa, with a theoretical isoelectric point (pI) of 7.99, gave rise to a train of spots at a much more acidic pI, an observation indicating the presence of PTM added extra negative charges (Fig. 6A). Upon cleavage with the BMP1 enzyme, the most acidic part of this series of spots is kept, whereas the digestion with ADAMTS2 collapsed these species into a single spot at a more basic pI (Fig. 6, B and C). These observations are compatible with the findings that the presence of the PTM caused the acidic shift within the protein region flanked by BMP1 and ADAMTS sites. This region, depicted in Fig. 7A, represents a unique tract within LOX sequence as it contains 12 tyrosines in a 50-amino acid–long segment, most of them well-conserved among different LOX orthologs (see Fig. 4). Tyrosine O-sulfation is one of the PTMs known to add extra negative charges and has been increasingly recognized as an important regulator of protein–protein interactions in the extracellular space (18Kehoe J.W. Bertozzi C.R. Tyrosine sulfation: a modulator of extracellular protein–protein interactions.Chem.

In fact, tyrosine sulfation of LOX in this particular location has been previously suggested but, to our knowledge, not thoroughly investigated (20Atsawasuwan P. Mochida Y. Katafuchi M. Tokutomi K. Mocanu V. Parker C.E. Yamauchi M. A novel proteolytic processing of prolysyl oxidase.Connect. Tissue Res. 2011; 52 (21591931): 479-48610.3109/03008207.2011.564337Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Analysis of LOX sequence using Sulfinator, a software used to predict tyrosine sulfation sites, revealed candidate tyrosines for this modification in a cluster within this region (Fig. 7A) (21Monigatti F. Gasteiger E. Bairoch A. Jung E. The sulfinator: predicting tyrosine sulfation sites in protein sequences.Bioinformatics. 2002; 18 (12050077): 769-77010.1093/bioinformatics/18.5.769Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). As a first approach to investigate whether these tyrosine residues become sulfated, we have altered the LOX sequence by changing tyrosines into phenylalanines, which blocked sulfation, and analyzed the mutant protein by immunoblotting under control conditions and after processing with BMP1 and ADAMTS enzymes. As shown in Fig. 7B (left), the precursor of this LOX mutant in the tyrosine cluster showed a slightly increased electrophoretic mobility compared with the WT precursor, an effect much more evident in the forms processed by BMP1. In contrast, the products resulting from ADAMTS2 cleavage migrated similarly for both WT and mutant proteins. Altogether, these observations suggest that these tyrosine residues are the target of a particular chemical modification, and its mutation abolishes this effect. This interpretation is further supported by 2D electrophoresis showing that LOX spots corresponding to the precursor band and the BMP1-processed form were shifted to the right in the mutant, whereas both WT and mutant forms accumulated into the same spot after proteolysis with ADAMTS2 (Fig. S3). Evidence for a sulfotyrosine modification was additionally obtained by using an antibody recognizing this particular PTM. As shown in Fig. 7B (right), this antibody positively stained the form processed by BMP1 in the WT but not in the mutant protein, leaving unstained the ADAMTS2-processed forms. Because our antibodies are not efficient for immunoprecipitation, we then generated LOX fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP). First, as shown in Fig. 7C, we confirmed that LOX–GFP chimeras behaved essentially as the corresponding forms without the GFP-tag, i.e. both forms are substrates for BMP1 and ADAMTS2 proteases, and tyrosine residues are the subject of a PTM modifying the electrophoretic mobility of precursor and the BMP1-processed forms. Then, these cell clones were metabolically labeled with inorganic [35S]sulfate, and the labeling of LOX proteins was determined after immunoprecipitation by electrophoresis and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 7D (left), sulfated polypeptides corresponding to BMP1-processed forms were identified for the WT LOX–GFP, whereas no labeling of the ADAMTS2-cleaved product was observed. Despite the proven ability of the anti-GFP beads to pull down the LOX proteolytic fragments in the LOX–GFP mutant protein (Fig. 7D, right), no radioactive-labeled bands were detected for this chimera. Finally, we have also performed a proteomic characterization of immunoprecipitated LOX–GFP bands resulting from proteolysis with BMP1 by parallel-reaction monitoring (PRM). Because of restrictions imposed by sequence, instead of performing a conventional digestion with trypsin, we processed protein bands with AspN, and therefore, we could only analyze the peptide DDNPYYNYY (Figs. S4 and S5). By comparison with synthetic peptides harboring sulfotyrosines at different positions, we were able to unambiguously detect the sulfuryl moiety in the last tyrosine residue of this peptide (Tyr-187), and also in one of the previous doublet, with no distinction of the exact position (Tyr-183 or Tyr-184). Disulfotyrosine peptides were not detected, most likely because negatively charge residues cannot stay in close proximity.Figure 7Identification of tyrosine sulfation in the LOX protein sequence flanked by BMP1 and ADAMTS2 cleavage sites.

Inputs and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-GFP antibody (upper panels) and by autoradiography (lower panels). Note that only slow-migrating bands resulting from the action of BMP1 were shown to incorporate radioactivity, whereas the fragment with higher electrophoretic mobility specifically generated by ADAMTS2 was not. Radioactively labeled bands observed in the supernatant treated with ADAMTS2 likely represent fragments generated as a result of endogenous BMP1 secreted by HEK293 cells. No specific radioactive labeling was detected in the immunoprecipitates from mutant LOX/GFP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Taken together, these results demonstrate that tyrosine residues in the LOX sequence flanked by cleavage sites for BMP1 and ADAMTS2/14 undergo sulfation, a modification that potentially can influence the biological properties of the LOX enzyme. Having demonstrated that LOX is processed by ADAMTS2/14, we investigated the contribution of this cleavage to the enzymatic activity while comparing with the effect of BMP1. LOX enzymatic activity was determined in an in vitro assay using a soluble substrate through detection of peroxide in a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled real-time reaction (22Palamakumbura A.H.

In the frame of a sustainable agriculture the use of bacterial antagonists, biological agents, plant defence response elicitors or resistant host plant genotypes are the most effective approaches. In this work, cold atmospheric pressure plasma (CAP) was applied to sterile distilled water, inducing the production of a hydrogen peroxide, nitrite and nitrate, and a pH reduction. In particular, an atmospheric pressure dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) has been used to produce plasma activated water (PAW), that was firstly assayed in in vitro experiments and then in planta through application at the root apparatus of tomato plants, against Xanthomonas vesicatoria (Xv), the etiological agent of bacterial leaf spot. Moreover, the transcription abundance of five genes related to the plant defense was investigated in response to PAW treatment. PAW did not show direct antimicrobial activity against Xv in in vitro experiments, but it enhanced the tomato plants defenses. It was effective in reducing the disease severity by giving relative protections of ca. 61, 51 and 38% when applied 1 h, 24 h and 6 days before the experimental inoculation, respectively. In addition, the experiments highlighted the pal gene involvement in response to the PAW treatments and against the pathogen; its transcription levels resulted significantly high from 1 to 48 h until their decrease 192 h after PAW application."
https://openalex.org/W2947698731,"Object To compare the clinical and radiological outcomes between patients with long posterior cervical fusion (PCF) in which fusion stopped at C7 versus patients in which fusion crossed the cervicothoracic junction (CTJ). Methods The patients were divided into 2 groups on the basis of the lower-most instrumented vertebra (LIV); C7 group patients (n = 25) and upper thoracic (UT) group (n = 21). We analyzed the visual analogue scale of arm/neck pain, Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score, and neck disability index (NDI). And we also measured the following parameters: (1) pseudomotion of fused segments; (2) C2–C7 sagittal vertical axis; (3) T1 slope; and (4) C2–C7 lordosis. Results Arm and neck pain were similar in both groups pre- and postoperatively. Interestingly, mean postoperative NDI score in the UT group was significant worse when compared with the C7 group (9.7±4.6 vs. 14.2±3.7, p = 0.006). Although UT patients had longer fusion levels, the fusion rates were not significantly different between the C7 and UT groups (96.0% vs. 90.5%; p = 0.577). The radiographic parameters did not show any significant differences between the groups at final follow-up. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that multi-level PCF stopping at C7 does not negatively affect C7-T1 segment failure, fusion rate, neck pain, neurologic outcomes, and global sagittal alignment of the cervical spine. Hence, it is unnecessary to extend the long PCF levels caudally across the healthy CTJ for fear of development of adjacent segmental disease (ASD) at the C7-T1 segment."
https://openalex.org/W2946874599,"Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer, is characterized by the absence of hormone receptors usually targeted by hormone therapies like Tamoxifen. Because therapy success and survival rates for TNBC lag far behind other breast cancer subtypes, there is significant interest in developing novel anti-TNBC agents that can target TNBC specifically, with minimal effects on non-malignant tissue. To this aim, our study describes the anti-TNBC effect of strictinin, an ellagitanin previously isolated from Myrothamnus flabellifolius. Using various in silico and molecular techniques, we characterized the mechanism of action of strictinin in TNBC. Our results suggest strictinin interacts strongly with Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Orphan like 1 (ROR1). ROR1 is an oncofetal receptor highly expressed during development but not in normal adult tissue. It is highly expressed in several human malignancies however, owing to its numerous pro-tumor functions. Via its interaction and inhibition of ROR1, strictinin reduced AKT phosphorylation on ser-473, inhibiting downstream phosphorylation and inhibition of GSK3β. The reduction in AKT phosphorylation also correlated with decreased cell survival and activation of the caspase-mediated intrinsic apoptotic cascade. Strictinin treatment also repressed cell migration and invasion in a beta-catenin independent manner, presumably via the reactivated GSK3ß's repressing effect on microtubule polymerization and focal adhesion turnover. This could be of potential therapeutic interest considering heightened interest in ROR1 and other receptor tyrosine kinases as targets for development of anti-cancer agents. Further studies are needed to validate these findings in other ROR1-expressing malignancies but also in more systemic models of TNBC. Our findings do however underline the potential of strictinin and other ROR1-targeting agents as therapeutic tools to reduce TNBC proliferation, survival and motility."
https://openalex.org/W2947541121,"The Musashi family of mRNA translational regulators controls both physiological and pathological stem cell self-renewal primarily by repressing target mRNAs that promote differentiation. In response to differentiation cues, Musashi can switch from a repressor to an activator of target mRNA translation. However, the molecular events that distinguish Musashi-mediated translational activation from repression are not understood. We have previously reported that Musashi function is required for the maturation of Xenopus oocytes and specifically for translational activation of specific dormant maternal mRNAs. Here, we employed MS to identify cellular factors necessary for Musashi-dependent mRNA translational activation. We report that Musashi1 needs to associate with the embryonic poly(A)-binding protein (ePABP) or the canonical somatic cell poly(A)-binding protein PABPC1 for activation of Musashi target mRNA translation. Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated an increased Musashi1 interaction with ePABP during oocyte maturation. Attenuation of endogenous ePABP activity severely compromised Musashi function, preventing downstream signaling and blocking oocyte maturation. Ectopic expression of either ePABP or PABPC1 restored Musashi-dependent mRNA translational activation and maturation of ePABP-attenuated oocytes. Consistent with these Xenopus findings, PABPC1 remained associated with Musashi under conditions of Musashi target mRNA de-repression and translation during mammalian stem cell differentiation. Because association of Musashi1 with poly(A)-binding proteins has previously been implicated only in repression of Musashi target mRNAs, our findings reveal novel context-dependent roles for the interaction of Musashi with poly(A)-binding protein family members in response to extracellular cues that control cell fate."
https://openalex.org/W2947759582,"The topology of animal transport networks contributes substantially to how fast and to what extent a disease can transmit between animal holdings. Therefore, public authorities in many countries mandate livestock holdings to report all movements of animals. However, the reported data often does not contain information about the exact sequence of transports, making it impossible to assess the effect of truck sharing and truck contamination on disease transmission. The aim of this study was to analyze the topology of the Swiss pig transport network by means of social network analysis and to assess the implications for disease transmission between animal holdings. In particular, we studied how additional information about transport sequences changes the topology of the contact network. The study is based on the official animal movement database in Switzerland and a sample of transport data from one transport company. The results show that the Swiss pig transport network is highly fragmented, which mitigates the risk of a large-scale disease outbreak. By considering the time sequence of transports, we found that even in the worst case, only 0.34% of all farm-pairs were connected within one month. However, both network connectivity and individual connectedness of farms increased if truck sharing and especially truck contamination were considered. Therefore, the extent to which a disease may be transmitted between animal holdings may be underestimated if we only consider data from the official animal movement database. Our results highlight the need for a comprehensive analysis of contacts between farms that includes indirect contacts due to truck sharing and contamination. As the nature of animal transport networks is inherently temporal, we strongly suggest the use of temporal network measures in order to evaluate individual and overall risk of disease transmission through animal transportation."

Thirty-four male soccer players (20 ± 4 years) performed a 20 m sprint test measured by timing gates (TG), and while wearing the PTPS. To evaluate the relevance of additional velocity-based parameters to discriminate between faster and slower athletes, the median-split method was applied to the 20-m times. Practical relevance was estimated using standardized mean differences (d) between the subgroups. Differences between the criterion reference (TG) and PTPS for the 10 and 20 m splits did not vary from zero (dt10: -0.01 ± 0.07 s, P = 0.7, d < -0.1; dt20: -0.01 ± 0.08 s, P = 0.4, d < -0.2). Although subgroups revealed large differences in their sprint times (d = -2.5), the average accelerations between 5 and 20 km/h as well as 20 and 25 km/h showed merely small effects (d < 0.5). Consequently, analyses of velocity curves derived from PTPS may help to clarify the occurrence of performance in outdoor sports. Thus, training consequences can be drawn which contribute to the differentiation and individualization of sprint training."
https://openalex.org/W2946942278,"Objectives Most researchers have examined forms of loneliness as discrete and emotional distress. The approach proposed in this study captures the reality that many persons experience more than one dimension of loneliness—varying degrees coupled with their psychological well-being in a family context. This study explores the latent structure of loneliness during young adulthood and its association with psychological well-being, as well as how these are related to their family characteristics in adolescence. Methods Data are from 2,748 young people, a cohort sample from the Taiwan Youth Project (TYP). Loneliness was assessed by a 6-item de Jong-Gierveld short scale with emotional and social loneliness domains. We describe the clustering between loneliness domains and psychological well-being, namely depressive symptoms, self-esteem, suicidal thoughts, and alcohol use using latent class cluster analysis. In addition to incorporating the Taiwanese family context, multivariate multinomial logistic regression models included data on family cohesion and parental guan (parental control) in adolescence. This might be associated with choices in partnership and childbearing, and influence loneliness in young adulthood. Results Our results demonstrate a three-cluster model of loneliness involving emotional loners, serious emotional loners, and severe emotional/social loners. We also found that a feeling of serious emotional loneliness and severe emotional/social loneliness were significantly associated with psychological well-being, even adjusting for individual characteristics. Among young adults who had a partner, the married adults were significantly less likely to feel serious emotional loneliness than those who were living alone. Furthermore, young adults with stronger family cohesion during early adolescence were less likely to suffer from serious emotional loneliness (Relative risk ratios [RRR] 0.77, 95% CI 0.65–0.91) and severe emotional/social loneliness (RRR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34–0.85) in young adulthood. Discussion This measurement strategy provides a foundation for future research into how experts can address loneliness clusters in order to better understand psychological well-being during young adulthood and family context in adolescence. This is important because our results suggest that the various loneliness domains do not occur independently, but rather are embedded in patterns and are associated with family characteristics."

We also investigated two possible quality improvement targets: furosemide dosing in renal impairment and inclusion of an initial bolus with continuous furosemide infusions. Materials and methods In this descriptive study, we retrospectively studied 46,037 adult ICU admissions from a publicly available database of patients in an urban, academic medical center. Results Diuretics were employed in nearly half (49%, 22,569/46,037) of ICU admissions. Mechanical ventilation, a history of heart failure, and admission to the post-cardiac surgery unit were associated with a higher frequency of diuretic use. Combination use of different diuretic classes was uncommon. Patients with severely impaired kidney function were less likely to receive diuretics. Furosemide was by far the most common diuretic given and the initial intravenous dose was only 20 mg in more than half of ICU admissions. Among patients treated with a continuous infusion, 30% did not receive a bolus on the day of infusion initiation. Conclusions Patterns of diuretic use varied by patient-specific factors and by ICU type. Diuretic dosing strategies may be suboptimal."

As an essential Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), TRIO is necessary for cytoskeletal dynamics during neurite outgrowth, but its participation in the membrane delivery is unclear. Using co-localization studies, live-cell imaging, and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, along with neurite outgrowth assay and various biochemical approaches, we here report that in mouse cerebellar granule neurons, TRIO protein pools at the Golgi and regulates membrane trafficking by controlling the directional maintenance of both RAB8 (member RAS oncogene family 8)– and RAB10-positive membrane vesicles. We found that the spectrin repeats in Golgi-resident TRIO confer RAB8 and RAB10 activation by interacting with and activating the RAB GEF RABIN8. Constitutively active RAB8 or RAB10 could partially restore the neurite outgrowth of TRIO-deficient cerebellar granule neurons, suggesting that TRIO-regulated membrane trafficking has an important functional role in neurite outgrowth. Our results also suggest cross-talk between Rho GEF and Rab GEF in controlling both cytoskeletal dynamics and membrane trafficking during neuronal development. They further highlight how protein pools localized to specific organelles regulate crucial cellular activities and functions. In conclusion, our findings indicate that TRIO regulates membrane trafficking during neurite outgrowth in coordination with its GEF-dependent function in controlling cytoskeletal dynamics via Rho GTPases."

https://openalex.org/W2946914483,"Background Evidence highlights a global shortage of wheelchair service provision education and training that results in inappropriate wheelchair provision with associated health and economic consequences. Two learning methodologies, a hybrid and an in-person course, based on the World Health Organization Wheelchair Service Training Package Basic Level, currently are available to train wheelchair service providers worldwide. The effectiveness of the in-person methodology, used as the standard of practice, has never been tested. Meanwhile, the Hybrid Course, which combines online and in-person training, was developed to reduce training costs and to scale training interventions and has shown potential effectiveness in increasing basic level wheelchair service provision knowledge. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of both learning methodologies based on knowledge and satisfaction among a group of wheelchair service providers in India and Mexico. Methods We conducted a controlled quasi-experimental study to evaluate changes in basic wheelchair knowledge and levels of satisfaction between Hybrid and In-person course learners in India and Mexico. A convenience sampling method guided by local stakeholders’ input was used to recruit participants. Outcomes were assessed using self-administered online surveys, the International Society of Wheelchair Professionals Wheelchair Service Provision Basic Test (primary outcome) completed pre- and post- the learning intervention and an anonymous Satisfaction Survey (secondary outcome) completed post- intervention. Baseline characteristics were compared among groups using hypothesis tests based on their assumptions. The primary analysis was intention-to-treat. To address missing values and lost to follow-up, multiple chained imputations were conducted. The primary outcome was analyzed using linear mixed models. The secondary outcome was analyzed using a two-tailed two independent samples t-test. Results A total of 81 participants, 43 (53.1%) in the In-person group and 38 (46.9%) in the Hybrid group, participated in the study. Mean baseline knowledge scores were below the passing cutoff of the test (53 points) in both groups. Both study groups experienced statistically significant improvements in the primary outcome when comparing pre- and post-test scores (p<0.0001) with total mean scores above the passing cutoff of the test. The in-person group experienced, on average, larger effects on the primary outcome. The difference in mean change from post-test to pre-tests between In-person groups and Hybrid was 3.6 (95% Confidence Interval: 1.7;5.4), Cohen’s d = 0.36, with a small effect size favoring the In-person training. With regards to satisfaction, the difference between the two interventions was 0.23±0.07 in favor of the In-person group (p = 0.0021). Conclusions Both learning methodologies had a statistically significant effect in increasing wheelchair service knowledge with overall high levels of satisfaction. However, the In-person group reported overall larger effects when compared with the Hybrid methodology. This study provided recommendations on how organizations can improve blended learning interventions to enhance participants’ learning experiences and reduce potential barriers and limitations."
https://openalex.org/W2947561325,"To meet the need for Parkinson's disease biomarkers and evidence for amount and distribution of pathological changes, MRI diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been explored in a number of previous studies. However, conflicting results warrant further investigations. As tissue microstructure, particularly of the grey matter, is heterogeneous, a more precise diffusion model may benefit tissue characterization. The purpose of this study was to analyze the diffusion-based imaging technique restriction spectrum imaging (RSI) and DTI, and their ability to detect microstructural changes within brain regions associated with motor function in Parkinson's disease. Diffusion weighted (DW) MR images of a total of 100 individuals, (46 Parkinson's disease patients and 54 healthy controls) were collected using b-values of 0-4000s/mm2. Output diffusion-based maps were estimated based on the RSI-model combining the full set of DW-images (Cellular Index (CI), Neurite Density (ND)) and DTI-model combining b = 0 and b = 1000 s/mm2 (fractional anisotropy (FA), Axial-, Mean- and Radial diffusivity (AD, MD, RD)). All parametric maps were analyzed in a voxel-wise group analysis, with focus on typical brain regions associated with Parkinson's disease pathology. CI, ND and DTI diffusivity metrics (AD, MD, RD) demonstrated the ability to differentiate between groups, with strongest performance within the thalamus, prone to pathology in Parkinson's disease. Our results indicate that RSI may improve the predictive power of diffusion-based MRI, and provide additional information when combined with the standard diffusivity measurements. In the absence of major atrophy, diffusion techniques may reveal microstructural pathology. Our results suggest that protocols for MRI diffusion imaging may be adapted to more sensitive detection of pathology at different sites of the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2946974379,"Since January 1, 2017, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has fully implemented the Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD) final rule aimed at facilitating the judicious use of medically important antimicrobials in food-producing animals. The objective of this study was to identify the common perceptions of Tennessee (TN) cattle producers regarding the VFD. We used a combination of focus groups and survey questionnaires to explore TN cattle producers’ perceptions regarding the VFD. Preliminary findings from seven focus groups of 62 producers were used in the development of the questionnaire sent both online and in-print to rest of cattle producers in TN. The beef focus group participants perceived the VFD: to be a top-down policy; to have led to unregulated access to in-feed antimicrobials; a regulation that has limited the producers’ ability to prevent disease and leading to economic losses; to negatively affect small producers; and to be affected by challenges related to prescription writing and disposal of un-used medicines. The dairy focus group participants perceived the VFD as unnecessary and burdensome, to have affected small producers, and introduced additional costs. Among the survey questionnaire respondents, 35 (15.4%) beef producers and 6 (13.6%) dairy producers respectively were not familiar at all with the VFD. Forty-eight (21.1%) beef producers and 11 (25%) dairy producers were slightly familiar with VFD. Gender was significantly associated (P = 0.02) with the beef producers’ belief in the usefulness of the VFD. Similarly, for dairy producers, herd size was significantly associated (P = 0.002) with their perceptions regarding the usefulness of the VFD. The findings of this study could inform future VFD policy review processes. More awareness regarding the VFD and its benefits is needed among both beef and dairy producers in TN."

However, how the NE and NPC reassemble remains largely unclear. Here, using HeLa, HEK293, and Drosophila cells, along with immunofluorescence microscopy and transmission EM methods, we found that postmitotic annulate lamellae (AL) assembly contributes to NE and NPC assembly. We observed that the AL are parallel membrane-pair stacks and possess regularly spaced AL pore complexes (ALPCs) that are morphologically similar to the NPCs. We found that the AL assemble in the cytoplasm during mitotic exit simultaneously with NE re-formation in daughter cells. Then, the assembled AL either bound the decondensing chromatin to directly transform into the NE or bound and fused with the outer nuclear membrane to join the assembling NE. The AL did not colocalize with sheet and tubular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker proteins on the ER or the lamin B receptor–localized membrane in the cytoplasm, suggesting that postmitotic AL assembly occurs independently of the chromatin and ER. Collectively, our results indicate that postmitotic AL assembly is a common cellular event and an intermediate step in NE and NPC assembly and in NE expansion in higher eukaryotic cells.

More recently, the AL were found to play a role in the increase in NPC numbers in Drosophila syncytial embryos by assembling NPC scaffolds and then fusing them with the interphase NE (29.Hampoelz B.

Hampoelz et al. also found that AL assembled in syncytial embryos and inserted into the NE during interphase at the end of mitosis. Accordingly, the authors developed a topological model in which NE openings were critical for AL uptake. However, this insertion operates only in early embryos before gastrulation (29.Hampoelz B.

In this work, we found that the AL efficiently assembled in the cytoplasm at the end of mitosis in both cultured cells and developing Drosophila somatic cells. We reveal that the AL either directly bound the chromatin to contribute to NE and NPC assembly or fused with the outer nuclear membrane to contribute to NE assembly, NPC number increases, and NE expansion. To deeply investigate the mechanism of NE and NPC assembly, we reexamined nuclear assembly processes by tracing dynamic localizations of the NE protein lamin B receptor (LBR), the ER protein calnexin, and Nup proteins in HeLa cells (Fig. 1, A and B). As expected, the NPCs assembled and inserted into the NE concomitant with NE assembly and ER network reconstruction (Fig. 1, A and B). Surprisingly, we found that a portion of the Nups was assembled into large or small particles in the cytoplasm during mitotic exit (Fig. 1, A and B). We also observed the same results in other cell lines (Figs. S1–S3). These particles decreased in number from the G1 to late phases (Figs. 1C, S1). More interestingly, most of these particles colocalized with neither the LBR- nor calnexin-containing ER except in the NE (Figs. 1, A and B, S1). To investigate the nature of these particles, we expressed GFP-tagged exogenous Nups and coimmunostained endogenous Nups in cells. We observed that both exogenous and endogenous Nups colocalized on the particles in addition to the NE in all dividing cells (Fig. 1, C and D). Furthermore, regardless of whether the cells had high, low, or no exogenous Nup expression, the amount of Nup-containing particles was comparable in both exogenous and nonexogenous Nup-expressing cells (Fig. 1D), suggesting that the particle assembly was not due to exogenous Nup overexpression. Taken together, these results indicate that Nup-containing particles assemble at the end of mitosis in a manner that is relatively independent of the ER. To trace the assembly process and fate of these particles, we generated cell lines stably expressing GFP-tagged Nups and performed time-lapse microscopy. We found that the GFP–Nups incorporated into the NPCs in interphase and dispersed into the cytoplasm in mitosis (Fig. 2A, cell 1 (C1) and cell 2 (C2); Fig. S2; Movies S1 and S2). Interestingly, when these cells divided, the GFP–Nup-containing particles simultaneously assembled near the separated chromatids and gradually assembled into the assembling NE (Fig. 2A). By comparing fluorescence intensity of GFP–Nups in 30 live HeLa cells at the end of mitosis, we calculated the ratio of these cytoplasmic particles to the NE. We found that the ratio was roughly 4.8 to 1 and that more than 40% of these AL joined into the assembling NE within 4 h, whereas most if not all of the rest joined the NE in later phases. We revealed that less than 20% of G2 cells were occasionally with AL, and these AL disassembled into the dispersed Nups in the cytoplasm during mitotic re-entry. Through immunostaining of the Nups and 3D analysis, we observed direct binding of the Nup-containing particles to the chromatin during NE assembly (Fig. 2B; Movie S3). Fast live-cell imaging of GFP–Nup107 also revealed cytoplasmic AL assembly and recruitment to the separating chromatids at anaphase (Fig. 2C; Movie S4). By using transmission EM (TEM), we observed that these particles were actually AL and that these AL could directly bind to the chromatin to transform into the NE (Fig. 2D). By coexpressing Nups with LBR or calnexin, we confirmed that AL assembly was relatively independent of cytoplasmic LBR- and calnexin-containing membranes (Movies S5 and S6). We also colabeled Nup107 with two other ER markers (sheet ER marker Climp63 and tubule ER marker Reep5) and found that Nup107-containing AL did not colocalize well with either the Climp63-containing ER or Reep5-containing ER (Fig. S4, A and B). We expressed mCherry–Sec61–β in GFP–Nup107 stably-expressing HeLa cells prior to performing live-cell imaging, and we observed that the GFP-containing AL did not colocalize with the mCherry–Sec61–β-containing ER (Fig. S4C). Using structural illumination microscopy for super-resolution live-cell imaging, we observed that some of the AL contacted the ER, which was consistent with a previous report (29.Hampoelz B. Mackmull M.-T. Machado P. Ronchi P. Bui K.H. Schieber N. Santarella-Mellwig R. Necakov A. Andrés-Pons A. Philippe J.M. Lecuit T. Schwab Y. Beck M.

Taken together, these results demonstrate that in addition to the ER and previously disassembled NE membrane vesicles, the membrane and ALPCs of the AL are also sources of the NE and NPCs and that AL assembly and ER reconstruction are relatively independent of each other. Because the AL can bind chromatin and participate in NE assembly during mitotic exit, we investigated the fate of the AL. Through time-lapse microscopy, we observed that the AL directly bound and fused into the assembling NE (Fig. 3A; Movie S7). Under TEM, we observed that the AL varied in size from larger structures that contained several piled lamellae to smaller structures that contained only a small piece of lamella (Fig. 3B). We revealed that the smaller AL fused with the ONM through its margin membrane (Fig. 3C). Through series sectioning, we found that the larger AL fused with the NE through the lamella nearest to the NE (Fig. 3D). By correlative light and EM using a stable GFP–Nup107-expressing cell line, we also revealed the fusion sites (Fig. 3, E–H; Movie S8). However, we did not observe any NEs that created holes first and then recruited AL to bind the chromatin, indicating that AL could only join the intact NE after assembly through fusion. Taken together, these results demonstrate that when the assembling NE is sealed, the AL can still join the NE to contribute to rapid NE assembly and expansion and that the AL fuses with the NE through their membranes. Because AL assembly was found to contribute to NE assembly in Drosophila syncytial embryos (29.Hampoelz B. Mackmull M.-T. Machado P. Ronchi P. Bui K.H. Schieber N. Santarella-Mellwig R. Necakov A.

First, we recorded syncytial embryos of Drosophila that persistently expressed GFP–Nup107. Consistent with a previous report (29.Hampoelz B. Mackmull M.-T. Machado P. Ronchi P. Bui K.H. Schieber N. Santarella-Mellwig R. Necakov A. Andrés-Pons A. Philippe J.M. Lecuit T. Schwab Y. Beck M.

We also found that the AL could directly bind chromatin to transform into the NE (Fig. 4A; Movie S9). Next, through recordings of cellular blastoderm embryos after 13 synchronized mitoses, we found that the AL also assembled and contributed to NE assembly and expansion by directly binding the chromatin and fusing with the intact assembling NE at the end of mitosis and G1 phase (Fig. 4B; Movie S10). With great interest, we investigated whether AL assembly also occurred in individuals in the late developmental stage. We dissected third instar larval brains of Drosophila that constitutively expressed GFP–Nup107 and recorded the cell division process of neuroblast cells. As expected, we found that postmitotic AL assembly occurred in individuals at this stage and that the assembled AL contributed to NE assembly and expansion (Fig. 4C; Movie S11). From recordings of Drosophila embryos and larvae that constitutively expressed RFP–Nup107 rather than GFP–Nup107, we obtained the same results as the experiments using GFP-expressing individuals (Fig. 4D; Movie S12). In summary, we conclude that postmitotic AL assembly occurs in all proliferating cells and that the assembled AL then transform into the NE through either direct binding to the chromatin during NE assembly or fusing into the existing assembling NE for expansion. This mechanism is universal for NE reconstitution in all proliferating cells. In this work, we studied the mechanism of NE assembly and expansion in higher eukaryotic cells. We demonstrate that both the NE and AL assemble simultaneously at the end of mitosis and that postmitotic AL assembly contributes to NE assembly and expansion by serving as an intermediate step in NE reconstitution. The AL either directly bind with the chromatin to transform into the NE or fuse with the assembling NE to contribute to NE assembly. The AL are parallel membrane stacks that contain NPC-like ALPCs and are often observed in a variety of cell types in both animals and plants (28.Kessel R.G. Annulate lamellae: a last frontier in cellular organelles.Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 133 (1374369): 43-12010.1016/S0074-7696(08)61858-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 29.Hampoelz B.

This work clearly determined the timing of AL assembly and the AL fate mainly by taking advantage of time-lapse microscopy and hence answered long-lasting questions concerning why fast-proliferating cells assemble AL, the functions of the AL, and how the assembling daughter nuclei rapidly expand their NEs. How cells assemble the AL is another long-persisting question. This work found that AL assembly is relatively independent of cytoplasmic LBR- or calnexin-containing membranes. AL assembly more likely initiates by assembling a small lamellar piece that contains only a few ALPCs using a currently undetermined membrane and some Nups. Under TEM, we did observe small AL with one or two ALPCs in early G1 cells (Fig. 3B). A number of the small lamellar pieces combine to form the larger AL. Both small and large AL can directly bind chromatin to transform into the NE. Clearly, chromatin is not essential for AL assembly. Instead, chromatin decondensation and AL assembly are probably parallel events, and the AL transform into the NE only when they have bound to chromatin, which allows them to transform into the NE on the decondensing chromatin. If the AL cannot efficiently bind chromatin before the NE is sealing up, they can still insert into the NE through fusion. However, at present, we do not know the mechanism underlying membrane fusion of the AL with the NE, although we clearly observed the fusion site of the AL with the outer nuclear membrane. Beck and co-workers (29.Hampoelz B. Mackmull M.-T. Machado P. Ronchi P. Bui K.H. Schieber N. Santarella-Mellwig R. Necakov A. Andrés-Pons A. Philippe J.M. Lecuit T. Schwab Y. Beck M. Pre-assembled nuclear pores insert into the nuclear envelope during early development.Cell. 2016; 166 (27397507): 664-67810.1016/j.cell.2016.06.015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) have proposed a model for insertion of ALPCs into the NE. However, this model is based on connection of the NE with the ER sheet and on the fact that this ER sheet is thought to be the location of ALPC assembly. Here, we find that both small and large AL are assembled relatively independently of the ER sheet. Moreover, we find that AL assembly and fusion with the NE not only occur in early Drosophila embryos before gastrulation but also in cellular embryos and late developing individuals. Therefore, we propose that postmitotic AL assembly is a common mechanism for NE assembly and expansion in all germ, embryonic, and somatic cells. In summary, based on our present data and previous reports, we propose a simple working model to elucidate the mechanism of NE assembly and expansion in proliferating higher eukaryotic cells (Fig. 5). We propose that three membrane sources contribute to NE assembly and expansion. These membranes are the ER, the previously disassembled membrane vesicles, and the membrane of the newly assembled AL, which hosts timely ALPC/NPC assembly beyond the NE. Although the NE and NPCs assemble around the separating chromatids using the existing membrane vesicles or ER components and Nup proteins during mitotic exit, the AL clearly appear to spontaneously assemble in the cytoplasm using the specialized membrane and Nup proteins. Then, the AL either bind the decondensing chromatin directly and laterally fuse with the assembling NE to contribute to NE and NPC assembly or fuse with the outer nuclear membrane to transform into the NE for NE expansion and nuclear growth. Collectively, our findings not only provide insights into the mechanism of NE assembly and expansion as the NPC numbers increase, to which the AL contributes, but also provide a method to study the assembly of the NE and AL and the function of the AL during cell proliferation. Nup35, Nup93, Nup98, and Nup107 were amplified by PCR from the 293-cell cDNA library and cloned into pEGFP-C2 (Clontech, catalog no. 6083-1). The antibodies mAb414 (ab24609, Abcam), polyclonal anti-human Nup107 (A301-787A, Bethyl Laboratories), and rabbit anti-calnexin (sc-11397, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were purchased. The rabbit anti-human LBR antibody was raised against glutathione S-transferase–tagged human LBR amino acids 1–60. All animal experiments were performed in the Laboratory Animal Center of Peking University in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals according to guidelines approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Peking University. Drosophila melanogaster lines stably expressing GFP–Nup107 (Flybase Stock No. 35513) and RFP–Nup107 (Flybase Stock No. 35820) were obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center. These Drosophila lines were maintained at 18 °C in vials and set up for crossing at 25 °C. To establish cell lines stably expressing GFP–Nup, HeLa cells were transfected with GFP–Nups via Lipo2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and selected with 10 μg/ml G418 after transfection for 72 h. Single-cell clones were individually picked and cultured in fresh medium with G418. HeLa and HEK293 cells were grown on glass coverslips in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere and transfected with the appropriate vectors. IFM was carried out as described previously (38.Rasala B.A. Orjalo A.V. Shen Z. Briggs S. Forbes D.J.

https://openalex.org/W2947487960,"Background As survival rates for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) continue to improve, there is growing concern over the chronic health conditions that survivors face. Given that survivors of childhood ALL are at increased risk of cardiovascular complications and obesity, we sought to characterize BMI trends from diagnosis through early survivorship in a multi-ethnic, contemporary cohort of childhood ALL patients and determine if early weight change was predictive of long-term weight status. Methods The study population consisted of ALL patients aged 2–15 years at diagnosis who were treated with chemotherapy alone at Texas Children’s Hospital. Each patient had BMI z-scores collected at diagnosis, 30-days post-diagnosis, and annually for five years. Linear regression models were estimated to evaluate the association between: 1) BMI z-score change in the first 30 days and BMI z-scores at five-years post-diagnosis; and 2) BMI z-score change in the first year post-diagnosis and BMI z-scores at five-years post-diagnosis. Results This retrospective cohort study included longitudinal data from 121 eligible patients. The mean BMI z-scores for the population increased significantly (p-value<0.001) from baseline (mean = 0.25) to 30 days post-diagnosis (mean = 1.17) before plateauing after one year post-diagnosis (mean = 0.99). Baseline BMI z-scores were statistically significant predictors to five year BMI z-scores (p <0.001). Independent of baseline BMI z-score and other clinical factors, the BMI z-score at one year post-diagnosis was significantly associated with BMI z-score at five-years post-diagnosis (β = 0.63, p <0.001), while BMI z-score at 30 days post-diagnosis was not (β = 0.10, p = 0.23). Conclusion Our results suggest that weight gain within the first year after diagnosis is more strongly associated with long-term BMI than early weight gain (within 30 days). If confirmed, this information may help identify a window of time during therapy when ALL patients would benefit most from weight management directed interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2947057749,"Studies have suggested that arginine vasopressin (AVP) and its surrogate marker copeptin increase during exercise, independently of serum sodium and/or osmolality. In extreme cases, this can lead to runners-induced hyponatremia. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) increases during exercise and induces AVP in animal models. We here therefore investigate whether copeptin (a surrogate marker for AVP) increases upon exercise in young and healthy males, and whether this increase is regulated by IL-1.In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial in 17 healthy male volunteers, the effect of the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra on exercise-induced copeptin was compared with placebo.Participants exercised for one hour at 75% of VO2max and were not allowed to drink/eat 6 hours before and during the study. Participants received either 100 mg of anakinra or placebo 1h before exercise. Blood was drawn at certain time intervals.In both groups, copeptin levels were induced by 2.5-fold upon exercise (p<0.001), from 4.5-10.6 pmol/l in the placebo, and 4.3-11.3 pmol/l in the anakinra group, (p = 0.38). One hour after exercise, copeptin levels dropped to 7.7 and 7.9 pmol/l in the placebo and anakinra group, respectively (p = 0.58). The increase of copeptin levels was not explained by sodium concentrations.Exercise induces a continuous rise of plasma copeptin levels in healthy male volunteers independently of sodium levels and fluid intake. This increase is not regulated by the IL-1 pathway."

We measured power output, heart rate, RPE and mental fatigue.Bayes analyses revealed extreme evidence for the 2-back task being more demanding than the 1-back task, both in terms of accuracy (BF10 = 4490) and reaction time (BF = 1316). The data only showed anecdotal evidence for the alternative hypothesis for the power output (BF10 = 1.52), moderate evidence for the null hypothesis for the heart rate (BF10 = 0.172), anecdotal evidence for RPE (BF10 = 0.72) and anecdotal evidence for mental fatigue (BF10 = 0.588).Our data seem to challenge the idea that self-paced exercise is regulated by top-down processing, given that we did not show clear evidence of exercise impairment (at the physical, physiological and subjective levels) in the high cognitive load condition task with respect to the low working memory load condition. The involvement of top-down processing in self-pacing the physical effort, however, cannot be totally discarded. Factors like the duration of the physical and cognitive tasks, the potential influence of dual-tasking, and the participants' level of expertise, should be taken into account in future attempts to investigate the role of top-down processing in self-paced exercise."
https://openalex.org/W2947709615,"Gaucher and Fabry diseases are the most prevalent sphingolipidoses. Chronic inflammation is activated in those disorders, which could play a role in pathogenesis. Significant degrees of amelioration occur in patients upon introduction of specific therapies; however, restoration to complete health status is not always achieved. The idea of an adjunctive therapy that targets inflammation may be a suitable option for patients. PPS is a mixture of semisynthetic sulfated polyanions that have been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects in mucopolysaccharidosis type I and II patients and animal models of type I, IIIA and VI. We hypothesized PPS could be a useful adjunctive therapy to inflammation for Gaucher and Fabry diseases. The objective of this work is to analyze the in vitro effect of PPS on inflammatory cytokines in cellular models of Gaucher and Fabry diseases, and to study its effect in Gaucher disease associated in vitro bone alterations. Cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from Fabry and Gaucher patients were exposed to PPS. The secretion of proinflammatory cytokines was significantly reduced. Peripheral blood cells exposed to PPS from Gaucher patients revealed a reduced tendency to differentiate to osteoclasts. Osteoblasts and osteocytes cell lines were incubated with an inhibitor of glucocerebrosidase, and conditioned media was harvested in order to analyze if those cells secrete factors that induce osteoclastogenesis. Conditioned media from this cell cultures exposed to PPS produced lower numbers of osteoclasts. We could demonstrate PPS is an effective molecule to reduce the production of proinflammatory cytokines in in vitro models of Fabry and Gaucher diseases. Moreover, it was effective at ameliorating bone alterations of in vitro models of Gaucher disease. These results serve as preclinical supportive data to start clinical trials in human patients to analyze the effect of PPS as a potential adjunctive therapy for Fabry and Gaucher diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2947844822,"Background Economic evaluations of advance care planning (ACP) in people with chronic kidney disease are scarce. However, past studies suggest ACP may reduce healthcare costs in other settings. We aimed to examine hospital costs and outcomes of a nurse-led ACP intervention compared with usual care in the last 12 months of life for older people with end-stage kidney disease managed with haemodialysis. Methods We simulated the natural history of decedents on dialysis, using hospital data, and modelled the effect of nurse-led ACP on end-of-life care. Outcomes were assessed in terms of patients’ end-of-life treatment preferences being met or not, and costs included all hospital-based care. Model inputs were obtained from a prospective ACP cohort study among dialysis patients; renal registries and the published literature. Cost-effectiveness of ACP was assessed by calculating an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed in dollars per additional case of end-of-life preferences being met. Robustness of model results was tested through sensitivity analyses. Results The mean cost of ACP was AUD$519 per patient. The mean hospital costs of care in last 12 months of life were $100,579 for those who received ACP versus $87,282 for those who did not. The proportion of patients in the model who received end-of-life care according to their preferences was higher in the ACP group compared with usual care (68% vs. 24%). The incremental cost per additional case of end-of-life preferences being met was $28,421. The greatest influence on the cost-effectiveness of ACP was the probability of dying in hospital following dialysis withdrawal, and costs of acute care. Conclusion Our model suggests nurse-led ACP leads to receipt of patient preferences for end-of-life care, but at an increased cost."
https://openalex.org/W2947749873,"The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between spleen stiffness value, splenic volume and the liver fibrosis stages.This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board of our institute. We enrolled 109 patients that had undergone abdominal MR imaging and histopathological examination. The preoperative MR imaging, MR elastography and laboratory data were reviewed. Liver stiffness and spleen stiffness were determined with MR elastography, and splenic volume was calculated. Liver fibrosis stage was determined using surgical pathology.The correlation coefficient between the liver stiffness and the fibrosis stage was r = 0.72 and r = 0.62 when the passive driver was on right chest wall and the left chest wall, respectively. The correlation coefficient between the spleen stiffness and the fibrosis stage was r = 0.63 and r = 0.18 when the passive driver was on the left chest wall and the right chest wall, respectively. The correlation coefficient between the splenic volume and the fibrosis stage was r = 0.31. The diagnostic performance of spleen stiffness was similar to liver stiffness in prediction of advanced liver fibrosis. The combination of spleen stiffness and liver stiffness provided greater sensitivity in prediction of advanced fibrosis than spleen or liver stiffness alone, but no significant difference was found.According to our study, the spleen stiffness value was useful in staging liver fibrosis. The combination of spleen stiffness and liver stiffness could provide higher diagnostic sensitivity than liver stiffness alone in prediction of advanced fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2979019996,"Sharing of injection drug use paraphernalia is a dyadic process linked to the transmission of HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Despite this, limited research exists identifying specific dyadic interpersonal factors driving injecting partners' engagement in needle/syringe and ancillary injecting equipment sharing among young adults. Using semi-structured in-depth interview data collected between 2014 and 2015 from twenty-seven people who inject drugs (PWID), we applied an inductive approach to identify key injection drug-related interpersonal factors and developed a conceptual model integrating the findings based on interdependence theory. Interactions between injecting partners resulted in varying levels of injecting-related trust, cooperation, intimacy, and power. These factors interacted to collectively influence the type and level of risk perceived and enacted by injecting partners. The relationship between these injecting-related interpersonal factors, on the one hand, and risk perception on the other was dynamic and fluctuated between actions that protect the self (person-centered) and those that protect the partnership (partnership-centered). These findings indicate that the interpersonal context exerts substantial influence that shapes risk perception in all types of injecting partnerships. Partnership-focused prevention strategies should consider the dynamics of trust, cooperation, intimacy, and power, in characterizing dyadic risk perceptions and in understanding risky injecting practices among PWID."
https://openalex.org/W2947302749,"Background Many Western countries face the challenge of providing high-quality care while keeping the healthcare system accessible and affordable. In an attempt to deal with this challenge a new healthcare delivery model called primary care plus (PC+) was introduced in the Netherlands. Within the PC+ model, medical specialists perform consultations in a primary care setting. PC+ aims to support the general practitioners in gatekeeping and prevent unnecessary referrals to hospital care. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a cardiology PC+ intervention on the Triple Aim outcomes, which were operationalized by patient-perceived quality of care, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes, and healthcare costs per patient. Methods This is a quantitative study with a longitudinal observational design. The study population consisted of patients, with non-acute and low-complexity cardiology-related health complaints, who were referred to the PC+ centre (intervention group) or hospital-based outpatient care (control group; care-as-usual). Patient-perceived quality of care and HRQoL (EQ-5D-5L, EQ-VAS and SF-12) were measured through questionnaires at three different time points. Healthcare costs per patient were obtained from administrative healthcare data and patients were followed for nine months. Chi-square tests, independent t-tests and multilevel linear models were used to analyse the data. Results The patient-perceived quality of care was significantly higher within the intervention group for 26 out of 27 items. HRQoL outcomes did significantly increase in both groups (P <0.05) but there was no significant interaction between group and time. At baseline and also at three, six and nine months’ follow-up the healthcare costs per patient were significantly lower for patients in the intervention group (P<0.001). Conclusions While this study showed no improvements on HRQoL outcomes, PC+ seemed to be promising as it results in improved quality of care as experienced by patients and lower healthcare costs per patient."

As current technology allows very deep transcriptome sequencing, we examined skin tumors and precursor lesions for HPV transcription. Method Fresh frozen biopsies from 12 skin specimens (11/12 were positive for HPV DNA) were subjected to total RNA sequencing. The cervical cancer cell line CaSki was included as a positive control for HPV transcription. Results HPV RNA was detected and confirmed in 1/12 skin lesions at a median depth of 66 million reads per sample. One specimen was positive for HPV 110 transcripts mapping to E6, E7, E2/E4 and L2 open reading frames, as well as to a spliced E1^E4 transcript. Conclusion In conclusion, the study revealed that a minority of skin lesions contains HPV transcripts and that HPV DNA detection does not predict HPV transcriptional activity."
https://openalex.org/W2947715893,"The success of the targeting of amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers through immunotherapy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse models has not been translated into the clinics. The use of single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) has been proposed to prevent the potential severe effects of full-length mAbs by precluding crystallizable fraction-mediated microglia activation. The efficacy of scFv-h3D6, a bapineuzumab-derived anti-Aβ scFv, has been extensively proven. In this work, we compared scFv-h3D6-EL, an elongated variant of the scFv-h3D6, with its original version to assess whether its characteristic higher thermodynamic stability improved its pharmacokinetic parameters. Although scFv-h3D6-EL had a longer half-life than its original version, its absorption from the peritoneal cavity into the systemic compartment was lower than that of the original version. Moreover, we attempted to determine the mechanism underlying the protective effect of scFv-h3D6. We found that scFv-h3D6 showed compartmental distribution and more interestingly crossed the blood-brain barrier. In the brain, scFv-h3D6 was engulfed by glial cells or internalized by Aβ peptide-containing neurons in the early phase post-injection, and was colocalized with the Aβ peptide almost exclusively in glial cells in the late phase post-injection. Aβ peptide levels in the brain decreased simultaneously with an increase in scFv-h3D6 levels. This observation in addition to the increased tumor necrosis factor-α levels in the late phase post-injection suggested that the engulfment of Aβ peptide/scFv-h3D6 complex extruded from large neurons by phagocytic cells was the mechanism underlying Aβ peptide withdrawal. The mechanism of action of scFv-h3D6 demonstrates the effectivity of Aβ-immunotherapy and lays the background for other studies focused on the finding of a treatment for AD."

Additionally, although oxytocin has been investigated as a potential treatment for postpartum depression, the interaction between antidepressants and exogenous oxytocin on brain activity is unknown. We explored postpartum depressed women's neural activation in areas identified as important to emotion and reward processing and potentially, antidepressant response: the amygdala, nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area. We conducted a secondary analysis of a functional imaging study of response to sexual, crying infant and smiling infant images in 23 postpartum depressed women with infants under six months (11 women taking antidepressants, 12 unmedicated). Participants were randomized to receive a single dose of oxytocin or placebo nasal spray. There was significantly higher amygdala activation to sexual stimuli than either neutral or infant-related stimuli among women taking antidepressants or receiving oxytocin nasal spray. Among unmedicated women receiving placebo, amygdala activation was similar across stimuli types. There were no significant effects of antidepressants nor oxytocin nasal spray on reward area processing (i.e., in the nucleus accumbens or ventral tegmental area). Among postpartum women who remain depressed, there may be significant interactions between the effects of antidepressant use and exogenous oxytocin on neural activity associated with processing emotional information. Observed effect sizes were moderate to large, strongly suggesting the need for further replication with a larger sample."
https://openalex.org/W2947681828,"Chemical proteasome inhibition has been a valuable animal model of neurodegeneration to uncover roles for the ubiquitin-proteasome system in the central nervous system. However, little is known about the effects of chemical proteasome inhibitors on retinal integrity. Therefore, we characterized the effects of structurally different chemical proteasome inhibitors on the retinal morphology and the mechanisms of their action in the normal adult rat eyes. Intravitreal injection of MG-262 and other proteasome inhibitors led to inner retinal degeneration. MG-262-induced inner retinal degeneration was accompanied by reduced proteasome activity, increased poly-ubiquitinated protein levels, and increased positive immunostaining of ubiquitin, 20S proteasome subunit and GADD153/CHOP in the retina. Its retinal degenerative effect was also associated with reduced retinal neurofilament light chain gene expression, reflecting retinal ganglion cell death. MG-262-induced neurofilament light chain downregulation was largely resistant to pharmacological modulation including endoplasmic reticulum stress, apoptosis or MAP kinase inhibitors. Thus, this study provides further evidence of roles for the ubiquitin-proteasome system in the maintenance of the retinal structural integrity.

We aimed to assess additive prognostic value of Minkowski functionals in analyzing heterogeneity of peritumoral hyperintensity on T2WI in glioblastoma patients.Clinical data (age, sex, extent of surgical resection), O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status and pre-operative T2WI of 113 pathologically confirmed glioblastoma patients (from our institution, n = 61; from the Cancer Imaging Archive, n = 52) were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were randomly grouped into a training set (n = 80) and a test set (n = 33). Peritumoral T2 hyperintensity was manually segmented and Minkowski functionals-a texture analysis method capturing heterogeneity of MR images-were computed as a function of 11 grayscale thresholds. The Cox proportional hazards models were fitted with clinical variables, Minkowski functionals features as well as both combined. The risk prediction performances of the Minkowski functionals and combined models were validated on a separate test dataset. The sex-specific survival difference of the entire cohort was analyzed according to MGMT methylation status via Kaplan-Meier survival curves.Thirty-three Minkowski features (11 area, 11 perimeter and 11 genus) for each patient were acquired giving a total of 3729 features. Cox regression models fitted with clinical data, Minkowski features, and both combined had incremental concordance indices of 0.577 (P = 0.02), 0.706 (P = 0.02) and 0.714 (P = 0.01) respectively. The prediction error rate of the combined model-having clinical and Minkowski features-was lower than that of Minkowski functionals model (0.135 and 0.161, respectively) when validated on a test dataset. No sex-specific survival difference was found according to MGMT methylation status (male, P = 0.2; female, P = 0.22).Minkowski functionals features computed from peritumoral hyperintensity can capture heterogeneity of glioblastoma on T2WI and have additive prognostic value in predicting survival, demonstrating their potential in complementing currently available prognostic parameters."

In this study, we tested the capability of COLOSTRONONI to influence gut microbiota composition using an in vivo evaluation in rats. Furthermore, we analyzed the effect of COLOSTRONONI on the systemic inflammatory responses as well as on the gut permeability of the animals. Altogether, our analyses supported the concept of COLOSTRONONI as a natural food supplement that doesn't affect (neither negatively nor positively) gut microbiota homeostasis in healthy conditions. Moreover, COLOSTRONONI highlighted a lower effect in the expression of genes coding for IL-10, Il-12 and TNF-α response allowing us to hypothesize an immunomodulatory activity of this dietary supplement."

Drug resistance among C. albicans isolates poses a common challenge, and overcoming this resistance represents an unmet need in managing this common pathogen. Here, we investigated CDC8, encoding thymidylate kinase (TMPK), as a potential drug target for the management of C. albicans infections. We found that the region spanning amino acids 106–123, namely the Ca-loop of C. albicans TMPK (CaTMPK), contributes to the hyperactivity of this enzyme compared with the human enzyme (hTMPK) and to the utilization of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP)/deoxy-5-fluorouridine monophosphate (5-FdUMP) as a substrate. Notably, expression of CaTMPK, but not of hTMPK, produced dUTP/5-FdUTP–mediated DNA toxicity in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). CRISPR-mediated deletion of this Ca-loop in C. albicans revealed that the Ca-loop is critical for fungal growth and susceptibility to 5-fluorouridine (5-FUrd). Of note, pathogenic and drug-resistant C. albicans clones were similarly sensitive to 5-FUrd, and we also found that CaTMPK is essential for the growth of C. albicans. In conclusion, these findings not only identified a target site for the development of CaTMPK-selective drugs, but also revealed that 5-FUrd may have potential utility as drug for managing C. albicans infections.

https://openalex.org/W2978822316,"The discovery of 20 unconventional kinetochore proteins in Trypanosoma brucei has opened a new and interesting area of evolutionary research to study a biological process previously thought to be highly conserved in all eukaryotes. In addition, the discovery of novel proteins involved in a critical cellular process provides an opportunity to exploit differences between kinetoplastid and human kinetochore proteins to develop therapeutics for diseases caused by kinetoplastid parasites. Consequently, we identified two of the unconventional kinetochore proteins as key targets (the highly related kinases KKT10 and KKT19). Recombinant T. brucei KKT19 (TbKKT19) protein was produced, a peptide substrate phosphorylated by TbKKT19 identified (KKLRRTLSVA), Michaelis constants for KKLRRTLSVA and ATP were determined (179 μM and 102 μM respectively) and a robust high-throughput compatible biochemical assay developed. This biochemical assay was validated pharmacologically with inhibition by staurosporine and hypothemycin (IC50 values of 288 nM and 65 nM respectively). Surprisingly, a subsequent high-throughput screen of a kinase-relevant compound library (6,624 compounds) yielded few hits (8 hits; final hit rate 0.12%). The low hit rate observed was unusual for a kinase target, particularly when screened against a compound library enriched with kinase hinge binding scaffolds. In an attempt to understand the low hit rate a TbKKT19 homology model, based on human cdc2-like kinase 1 (CLK1), was generated. Analysis of the TbKKT19 sequence and structure revealed no obvious features that could explain the low hit rates. Further work will therefore be necessary to explore this unique kinetochore kinase as well as to assess whether the few hits identified can be developed into tool molecules or new drugs."

Several Ddi2 active-site point mutations exhibited reduced catalytic activity. We kinetically and structurally characterized H137N and T157V mutants of Ddi2. A cyanamide soak of the Ddi2-T157V enzyme revealed cyanamide bound directly to the Zn2+ ion, having displaced the zinc-bound water molecule.

This study investigated SSBE and MNE in 60 females by using a trait-judgment paradigm applying two perspectives (self- and third-person appraisals) and a recall task. Additionally, self-esteem was assessed as an associated factor. SSBE and MNE were found in both kinds of appraisal perspectives. Interestingly, participants saw themselves as even more positive in reflected appraisals. SSBE and self-esteem were associated only in self-appraisals, indicating a larger SSBE on self-appraisals with raising self-esteem. In conclusion, both what females think about themselves and how they assume that others think about them preserve their overall positive self-concept."

Podocytes are highly differentiated epithelial cells that wrap around capillaries of the kidney glomerulus and form a visceral layer of the Bowman capsule. Their tertiary projections or foot processes connect via an intercellular junction called the slit diaphragm. Despite intense research efforts, the exact molecular composition of the slit diaphragm has not been completely elucidated (9Grahammer F. Wigge C. Schell C. Kretz O. Patrakka J. Schneider S. Klose M.

The cytoplasmic tail of human nephrin contains the YRSL sequence, which conforms to a clathrin-dependent consensus endocytic motif of the YXXØ type.

From a population genetics perspective, the Y1139RSL sequence is very important because variation at this motif is rare, if not absent. In reviewing the gnomAD database of ∼122,000 whole exomes (WES) and ∼15,000 whole genomes (WGS) (http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/), 4Please note that the JBC is not responsible for the long-term archiving and maintenance of this site or any other third party hosted site. the c.C3418T change reported as pathogenic above is only present in 0.01% of the population, and variation in the position 1141 amino acid residue is only seen in 0.0008% of the population. Other nonsynonymous changes affecting p.R1140 (p.R1140S and p.R1140H) are rare, affecting ∼0.1% of the population. Synonymous or nonsynonymous variation affecting residue 1139 or 1142 is not observed at all. Data presented herein demonstrate that the Y1139RSL motif functions as a phosphorylation-sensitive signal for clathrin-dependent nephrin endocytosis, essential for the slit diaphragm formation. First, we examined whether human nephrin interacts with clathrin and the plasma membrane–associated endocytic adaptor complex, the assembly polypeptide-2 (AP-2) (17Mousavi S.A. Malerød L. Berg T. Kjeken R. Clathrin-dependent endocytosis.Biochem. J. 2004; 377 (14505490): 1-1610.1042/bj20031000Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Immortalized human podocytes were transfected with the WT human nephrin (Nephrin-WT) plasmid because endogenous nephrin expression was below detection by biochemical assays (Fig. S2). Nephrin-WT co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous clathrin and the μ2 adaptin of AP-2 (Fig. 1A). Next, we examined whether the cell surface abundance of Nephrin-WT is controlled by the large GTPase dynamin-2 that releases cargo containing clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) into the cell interior by membrane fission at the neck of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) (18Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L.

The dominant-negative dynamin-2 mutant DynK44A that blocks scission of CCPs increased the plasma membrane abundance of Nephrin-WT, as shown by the cell surface biotinylation assay (Fig. 1B). These data indicate that nephrin is internalized by a clathrin-dependent mechanism. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that Nephrin-WT interacts with the small GTPases Rab4 and Rab8 (Fig. 1C). Rab4 and Rab8 are involved in recycling of the cargo molecules from early endosomes to plasma membrane, polarized membrane traffic, and interactions with the actin cytoskeleton (20Nishimura N. Sasaki T. Rab family small G proteins in regulation of epithelial apical junctions.Front. Biosci. (Landmark Ed.). 2009; 14 (19273188): 2115-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Together, these data show that in human podocytes, Nephrin-WT is internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis followed by trafficking in specialized, actin-based recycling compartments. Interactions of the μ2 subunit of AP-2 with the YXXØ motif in membrane proteins trigger the formation of CCPs (21Mercer J. Schelhaas M. Helenius A. Virus entry by endocytosis.Annu. Rev.

Biochem. 2003; 72 (12651740): 395-44710.1146/annurev.biochem.72.121801.161800Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar). By contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation inhibits endocytosis and helps retain a protein at the cell surface because phosphorylated tyrosine cannot interact with the μ2 adaptin. To determine whether the Nephrin-Y1139 can function as such a sensor, we mutated it to alanine (Nephrin-Y1139A) or phenylalanine (Nephrin-Y1139F). The Nephrin-Y1139A substitution should disable Y1139RSL as an endocytic motif, whereas the Y1139F substitution should mimic a nonphosphorylated state of the tyrosine residue and facilitate endocytosis. First, tyrosine phosphorylation of the nephrin variants was examined by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 in immunoprecipitation experiments. There have been nine tyrosine residues reported in the nephrin cytoplasmic C-terminal tail (12Welsh G.I. Saleem M.A. Nephrin-signature molecule of the glomerular podocyte?.J. Pathol. 2010; 220 (19950250): 328-33710.1002/path.2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Compared with Nephrin-WT, tyrosine phosphorylation was reduced by the Y1139F or Y1139A substitution, indicating that the Nephrin-Y1139 is phosphorylated and thus may function in the context of the Y1139RSL sequence as a phosphorylation-dependent sensor (Fig. 1, D and E). Next, to examine whether altering the Nephrin-Y1139 phosphorylation affects clathrin-dependent nephrin endocytosis, we followed the abundance of Nephrin-WT, Nephrin-Y1139F, or Nephrin-Y1139A in CCVs isolated by density gradient and differential centrifugation, a procedure validated in our previous publication (24Cihil K.M. Ellinger P. Fellows A. Stolz D.B. Madden D.R. Swiatecka-Urban A. Disabled-2 protein facilitates assembly polypeptide-2-independent recruitment of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator to endocytic vesicles in polarized human airway epithelial cells.J.

Purity of the CCV fraction was confirmed by enrichment of the clathrin-associated μ2 adaptin, exclusion of the coat protein caveolin-1 associated with clathrin-independent endocytosis, and exclusion of the cargo protein podocin associated with lipid-raft membrane domains (Fig. 2, A and B). Nephrin-WT was enriched in the CCV fraction and co-distributed with clathrin and μ2 adaptin (Fig. 2, A and B). Clathrin abundance in the CCVs in podocytes expressing different nephrin variants was similar, indicating comparable isolation efficiency of the CCV fraction (Fig. 2C). The CCV abundance of Nephrin-Y1139F, mimicking the dephosphorylated tyrosine, was increased, compared with Nephrin-WT. The results indicate that the Y1139F substitution enabled the Y1139RSL sequence to facilitate clathrin-dependent nephrin endocytosis (Fig. 2, D and E). Moreover, the CCV abundance of Nephrin-Y1139A, disabling the YXXØ motif, was decreased compared with Nephrin-WT, indicating that the Y1139A substitution inactivated the Y1139RSL sequence as an endocytic motif (Fig. 2, D and E). Because Nephrin-Y1139A was still present in CCVs, the Y1139RSL sequence is likely not the only clathrin-dependent endocytic motif in human nephrin. Nevertheless, these data demonstrate that the Y1139RSL motif mediates clathrin-dependent nephrin endocytosis. We conducted cell surface biotinylation assays to determine effects of the Nephrin-Y1139 mutations on the steady-state plasma membrane abundance of nephrin. Whereas the three nephrin variants were detected at the plasma membrane, Nephrin-Y1139F was less abundant and Nephrin-Y1139A was more abundant, compared with Nephrin-WT (Fig. 3, A and B). Besides the role in clathrin-dependent endocytosis, YXXØ sequence may serve as a plasma membrane–targeting motif during protein biosynthetic processing (25Marks M.S. Woodruff L. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. Protein targeting by tyrosine- and di-leucine-based signals: evidence for distinct saturable components.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135 (8896593): 341-35410.1083/jcb.135.2.341Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). To confirm that the above differences in steady-state cell surface abundance resulted from altered endocytic trafficking, rather than different targeting to the cell surface, we examined effects of the Nephrin-Y1139 mutations on nephrin stability at the plasma membrane. Podocytes were treated with the inhibitor of translation cycloheximide (26Ye S. Cihil K. Stolz D.B. Pilewski J.M. Stanton B.A. Swiatecka-Urban A. c-Cbl facilitates endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human airway epithelial cells.J. Biol.

The plasma membrane half-life of Nephrin-Y1139F (2.9 h) was decreased, and that of Nephrin-Y1139A (7.4 h) was increased, compared with Nephrin-WT (4.5 h) (Fig. 4, A and B). The Nephrin-Y1139 mutagenesis affected specifically the plasma membrane and not the total cellular nephrin stability (Fig. 4, A–C). Our interpretation was that the nonphosphorylated tyrosine mimic, Y1139F reduced the plasma membrane nephrin stability by accelerating nephrin endocytosis. By contrast, the Y1139A substitution disabled the Y1139RSL endocytic motifs and stabilized nephrin at the plasma membrane by inhibiting its endocytosis.Figure 4Cell surface biotinylation experiments demonstrating that the Y1139RSL motif affects nephrin stability at the plasma membrane. Podocytes expressing Nephrin-WT (WT), -Y1139F (Y/F), and -Y1139A (Y/A) were cultured to confluence. Protein disappearance from the PM was monitored over time in the presence of 20 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) at 37 °C to inhibit protein translation. PM proteins were labeled with membrane-impermeable EZ-LinkTM Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin. Ezrin expression in WCL was used as a loading control. The half-life was calculated using a one-way exponential decay model. Shown are immunoblots (WB) (A) and a summary of experiments (B) demonstrating that the plasma membrane half-life of Y/F (2.9 h) was shorter and that of Y/A (7.4 h) was longer, compared with WT (4.5 h).

We performed a scratch assay to examine the role of the Y1139RSL motif in podocyte motility. Podocytes expressing Nephrin-WT demonstrated baseline motility that was partially restricted by Nephrin-Y1139F (Fig. 5). By contrast, Nephrin-Y1139A increased podocyte migration by 2-fold compared with Nephrin-WT. The differences in number of cells in the scratch region did not result from differences in the cell-seeding density or cell division as determined by a comparable expression of nephrin variants or the housekeeping protein ezrin in podocytes expressing the nephrin variants (Fig. 5C). These data demonstrate that increased nephrin endocytosis, mediated by the Y1139RSL motif, stabilizes podocytes, whereas inhibition of nephrin endocytosis induces podocyte migration. These results indicate that active nephrin turnover between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments stabilizes podocytes and that the podocyte migratory responses are activated when nephrin becomes immobilized at the plasma membrane. To test the functional significance of the human Nephrin-Y1139, we knocked down zebrafish nephrin and attempted to rescue with the human (hs)-Nephrin-WT, hs-Nephrin-Y1139F, or hs-Nephrin-Y1139A synthetic mRNA. Others have shown that human nephrin can rescue nephrin loss in zebrafish embryos and modifications to the human nephrin sequence alter the gene's rescuing abilities (32Fukuyo Y. Nakamura T.

Injection of validated nephrin morpholino (dr-Nephrin-MO) resulted in mis-splicing of zebrafish nephrin mRNA (Fig. S3). Embryos depleted of nephrin grown to 4 days postfertilization (dpf) exhibited pericardial and yolk sac edema as well as curvature of the body axis (Fig. 6A). In our rescue experiments, hs-Nephrin transcripts co-injected with dr-Nephrin-MO partially rescued nephrin mRNA expression with similar efficacy (Fig. S3, C and D). As shown by Fukuyo et al. (32Fukuyo Y. Nakamura T. Bubenshchikova E. Powell R. Tsuji T. Janknecht R. Obara T. Nephrin and Podocin functions are highly conserved between the zebrafish pronephros and mammalian metanephros.Mol.

Similarly, co-injection of hs-Nephrin-Y1139F significantly rescued dr-Nephrin-MO–mediated phenotypes. We did not observe rescue in embryos co-injected with Nephrin-Y1139A and dr-Nephrin-MO when compared with embryos injected with the dr-Nephrin-MO alone.Figure 6The human nephrin-Y1139F is sufficient and required for human nephrin function and slit diaphragm formation in zebrafish embryos.

https://openalex.org/W2947405592,"An effective strategy to resolve conservation conflicts on lands outside of nature reserves is to consider the spatial arrangement of agricultural and native vegetation parcels such that the ecological value of the landscape is improved without reducing the amount of land used for agricultural production. Global optimization methods have been used to identify the best spatial arrangement of land parcels for a given project goal, but these methods are not designed to provide pathways to reach the optimum from the initial landscape. Here we describe how local search algorithms can be used to develop land parcel rearrangement pathways to obtain a landscape that sustains greater species richness than the initial landscape without changing the amount of land used for agricultural production. To demonstrate how the local optimization framework can be applied, an ecological setting based on a forest-grassland mosaic ecosystem in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil was constructed. Plant samples collected from this region were used to construct species area curves. Multiple locally optimal solutions that improved the modeled species richness of the landscape almost to globally optimal levels were identified. To support the results, the algorithm was also applied to a 306,250 ha forest-grassland region of Rio Grande do Sul. The case study results suggested that conservation polices solely based on landowners satisfying a legal reserve percentage on their property should be revised to consider landscape-level connectivity. Providing multiple possible solutions for landscape configurations using local optimization methods may improve managerial flexibility for decision-makers, compared to global optimization approaches providing a single solution. Furthermore, the algorithm details the parcel exchange pathways that are required to reach the optimal land state. We conclude that local and global optimization approaches can be used in combination to improve land use decision-making for conservation, in mosaic ecosystems as well as other terrestrial ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2947938264,"Nonautologous bone grafts have limited osteoinductive potential and thus there is substantial interest in reconstituting these graft materials with osteogenic factors such as bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP2). However, one limitation of this approach is that BMP2 is typically weakly bound to the graft, which can lead to side effects associated with BMP2 dissemination. In the current study we added a hydroxyapatite (HA)-binding domain onto BMP2 to increase coupling to the graft surface. A sequence consisting of eight glutamate residues (E8) was inserted into the C-terminus of BMP2, and the recombinant protein (rBMP2-E8) was expressed in E. coli. Compared with rBMP2, rBMP2-E8 displayed markedly enhanced binding to HA disks and was better retained on the disks following exposure to vigorous wash steps. Furthermore, rBMP2-E8 was purified using a heparin column, and evaluated for its capacity to stimulate osteoblastic cell signaling. Treatment of SAOS2 cells with rBMP2-E8 induced SMAD 1/5 activation, confirming that the protein retains activity. Collectively these results suggest that the E8 domain serves as an effective tool for improving rBMP2 coupling to graft materials. The increased retention of rBMP2-E8 on the graft surface is expected to prolong BMP2's osteoinductive activity within the graft site, while simultaneously reducing off-target effects."
