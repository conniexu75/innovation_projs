https://openalex.org/W1980740451,"The regulation of bone remodeling by an adipocyte-derived hormone implies that bone may exert a feedback control of energy homeostasis. To test this hypothesis we looked for genes expressed in osteoblasts, encoding signaling molecules and affecting energy metabolism. We show here that mice lacking the protein tyrosine phosphatase OST-PTP are hypoglycemic and are protected from obesity and glucose intolerance because of an increase in β-cell proliferation, insulin secretion, and insulin sensitivity. In contrast, mice lacking the osteoblast-secreted molecule osteocalcin display decreased β-cell proliferation, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance. Removing one Osteocalcin allele from OST-PTP-deficient mice corrects their metabolic phenotype. Ex vivo, osteocalcin can stimulate CyclinD1 and Insulin expression in β-cells and Adiponectin, an insulin-sensitizing adipokine, in adipocytes; in vivo osteocalcin can improve glucose tolerance. By revealing that the skeleton exerts an endocrine regulation of sugar homeostasis this study expands the biological importance of this organ and our understanding of energy metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2124153237,"The regenerative potential of skeletal muscle declines with age, and this impairment is associated with an increase in tissue fibrosis. We show that muscle stem cells (satellite cells) from aged mice tend to convert from a myogenic to a fibrogenic lineage as they begin to proliferate and that this conversion is mediated by factors in the systemic environment of the old animals. We also show that this lineage conversion is associated with an activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in aged myogenic progenitors and can be suppressed by Wnt inhibitors. Furthermore, components of serum from aged mice that bind to the Frizzled family of proteins, which are Wnt receptors, may account for the elevated Wnt signaling in aged cells. These results indicate that the Wnt signaling pathway may play a critical role in tissue-specific stem cell aging and an increase in tissue fibrosis with age."
https://openalex.org/W2009626516,"Given the widespread importance of amides in biochemical and chemical systems, an efficient synthesis that avoids wasteful use of stoichiometric coupling reagents or corrosive acidic and basic media is highly desirable. We report a reaction in which primary amines are directly acylated by equimolar amounts of alcohols to produce amides and molecular hydrogen (the only products) in high yields and high turnover numbers. This reaction is catalyzed by a ruthenium complex based on a dearomatized PNN-type ligand [where PNN is 2-(di- tert -butylphosphinomethyl)-6-(diethylaminomethyl)pyridine], and no base or acid promoters are required. Use of primary diamines in the reaction leads to bis-amides, whereas with a mixed primary-secondary amine substrate, chemoselective acylation of the primary amine group takes place. The proposed mechanism involves dehydrogenation of hemiaminal intermediates formed by the reaction of an aldehyde intermediate with the amine."
https://openalex.org/W2001750225,"The contribution of stem and progenitor cell dysfunction and depletion in normal aging remains incompletely understood. We explored this concept in the Klotho mouse model of accelerated aging. Analysis of various tissues and organs from young Klotho mice revealed a decrease in stem cell number and an increase in progenitor cell senescence. Because klotho is a secreted protein, we postulated that klotho might interact with other soluble mediators of stem cells. We found that klotho bound to various Wnt family members. In a cell culture model, the Wnt-klotho interaction resulted in the suppression of Wnt biological activity. Tissues and organs from klotho-deficient animals showed evidence of increased Wnt signaling, and ectopic expression of klotho antagonized the activity of endogenous and exogenous Wnt. Both in vitro and in vivo, continuous Wnt exposure triggered accelerated cellular senescence. Thus, klotho appears to be a secreted Wnt antagonist and Wnt proteins have an unexpected role in mammalian aging."
https://openalex.org/W1982140334,"Previous climate model projections of climate change accounted for external forcing from natural and anthropogenic sources but did not attempt to predict internally generated natural variability. We present a new modeling system that predicts both internal variability and externally forced changes and hence forecasts surface temperature with substantially improved skill throughout a decade, both globally and in many regions. Our system predicts that internal variability will partially offset the anthropogenic global warming signal for the next few years. However, climate will continue to warm, with at least half of the years after 2009 predicted to exceed the warmest year currently on record."
https://openalex.org/W2160444874,"TNFalpha has recently emerged as a regulator linking inflammation to cancer pathogenesis, but the detailed cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this link remain to be elucidated. The tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1)/TSC2 tumor suppressor complex serves as a repressor of the mTOR pathway, and disruption of TSC1/TSC2 complex function may contribute to tumorigenesis. Here we show that IKKbeta, a major downstream kinase in the TNFalpha signaling pathway, physically interacts with and phosphorylates TSC1 at Ser487 and Ser511, resulting in suppression of TSC1. The IKKbeta-mediated TSC1 suppression activates the mTOR pathway, enhances angiogenesis, and results in tumor development. We further find that expression of activated IKKbeta is associated with TSC1 Ser511 phosphorylation and VEGF production in multiple tumor types and correlates with poor clinical outcome of breast cancer patients. Our findings identify a pathway that is critical for inflammation-mediated tumor angiogenesis and may provide a target for clinical intervention in human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2025173880,"Black carbon (BC) from biomass and fossil fuel combustion alters chemical and physical properties of the atmosphere and snow albedo, yet little is known about its emission or deposition histories. Measurements of BC, vanillic acid, and non-sea-salt sulfur in ice cores indicate that sources and concentrations of BC in Greenland precipitation varied greatly since 1788 as a result of boreal forest fires and industrial activities. Beginning about 1850, industrial emissions resulted in a sevenfold increase in ice-core BC concentrations, with most change occurring in winter. BC concentrations after about 1951 were lower but increasing. At its maximum from 1906 to 1910, estimated surface climate forcing in early summer from BC in Arctic snow was about 3 watts per square meter, which is eight times the typical preindustrial forcing value."
https://openalex.org/W1969621876,"Studies of the fat-derived hormone leptin have provided key insights into the molecular and neural components of feeding behavior and body weight regulation. An important challenge lies in understanding how the rewarding properties of food interact with, and can override, physiological satiety signals and promote overeating. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure brain responses in two human patients with congenital leptin deficiency who were shown images of food before and after 7 days of leptin replacement therapy. Leptin was found to modulate neural activation in key striatal regions, suggesting that the hormone acts on neural circuits governing food intake to diminish the perception of food reward while enhancing the response to satiety signals generated during food consumption."
https://openalex.org/W2079921190,"Chromosome segregation in mammalian oocytes is driven by a microtubule spindle lacking centrosomes. Here, we analyze centrosome-independent spindle assembly by quantitative high-resolution confocal imaging in live maturing mouse oocytes. We show that spindle assembly proceeds by the self-organization of over 80 microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) that form de novo from a cytoplasmic microtubule network in prophase and that functionally replace centrosomes. Initially distributed throughout the ooplasm, MTOCs congress at the center of the oocyte, where they contribute to a massive, Ran-dependent increase of the number of microtubules after nuclear envelope breakdown and to the individualization of clustered chromosomes. Through progressive MTOC clustering and activation of kinesin-5, the multipolar MTOC aggregate self-organizes into a bipolar intermediate, which then elongates and thereby establishes chromosome biorientation. Finally, a stable barrel-shaped acentrosomal metaphase spindle with oscillating chromosomes and astral-like microtubules forms that surprisingly exhibits key properties of a centrosomal spindle."
https://openalex.org/W2022506021,"The permeability barrier of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) controls the exchange between nucleus and cytoplasm. It suppresses the flux of inert macromolecules > or = 30 kDa but allows rapid passage of even very large cargoes, provided these are bound to appropriate nuclear transport receptors. We show here that a saturated hydrogel formed by a single nucleoporin FG-repeat domain is sufficient to reproduce the permeability properties of NPCs. Importin beta and related nuclear transport receptors entered such hydrogel >1000x faster than a similarly sized inert macromolecule. The FG-hydrogel even reproduced import signal-dependent and importin-mediated cargo influx, allowing importin beta to accelerate the gel entry of a large cognate cargo more than 20,000-fold. Intragel diffusion of the importin beta-cargo complex occurred rapidly enough to traverse an NPC within approximately 12 ms. We extend the ""selective phase model"" to explain these effects."
https://openalex.org/W2001962405,"We have shown that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) down-regulates renin expression. To explore the molecular mechanism, we analyzed the mouse Ren-1c gene promoter by luciferase reporter assays. Deletion analysis revealed two DNA fragments from –2725 to –2647 (distal fragment) and from –117 to +6 (proximal fragment) that are sufficient to mediate the repression. Mutation of the cAMP response element (CRE) in the distal fragment blunted forskolin stimulation as well as 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibition of the transcriptional activity, suggesting the involvement of CRE in 1,25(OH)2D3-induced suppression. EMSA revealed that 1,25(OH)2D3 markedly inhibited nuclear protein binding to the CRE in the promoter. ChIP and GST pull-down assays demonstrated that liganded VDR blocked the binding of CREB to the CRE by directly interacting with CREB with the ligand-binding domain, and the VDR-mediated repression can be rescued by CREB, CBP, or p300 overexpression. These data indicate that 1,25(OH)2D3 suppresses renin gene expression at least in part by blocking the formation of CRE-CREB-CBP complex.

Moffett S.B. Schauf C.L. Human Physiology. Foundation and Frontiers. 2nd Ed. Wm. C. Brown Publishers, Dubuque, IA1993: 420-445Google Scholar). Renin, the first and rate-limiting component of the RAS, is a protease synthesized and secreted predominantly by the juxtaglomerular (JG) cells in the kidney. Renin is encoded by one gene in humans. In mice, some strains have one renin gene (e.g. Ren-1c in C57BL/6 strain), and others contain two renin genes (e.g. Ren-1d and Ren-2 in J129 strain), which probably result from a duplication of the 21 kb Ren-1c-like ancestral gene (2Abel K.J. Gross K.W. Genetics. 1990; 124: 937-947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ren-1 and Ren-2 share 97% amino acid identity (3Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. Hypertension. 1991; 18: 446-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The Ren-1 protein is the major source of circulating renin and thus believed to be the major regulator of the renin-angiotensin cascade. Renin biosynthesis is regulated by a complex network of regulatory proteins (4Pan L. Gross K.W. Hypertension. 2005; 45: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Transgenic studies have demonstrated that the cis-DNA elements required for the tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific expression as well as for response to a variety of physiological stimuli are located within 5 kb of the 5′-flanking region of the murine renin gene (5Jones C.A.

In the 4.1 kb 5′-flanking region of the Ren-1c gene, a proximal minimal promoter (–117 to +6) and a potent 242-bp enhancer (–2866 to –2625) upstream of the transcriptional start site have been shown to be necessary for a high level expression of the renin gene in As4.1 cells (8Petrovic N.

Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is long known to be a major intracellular signal that stimulates renin production in JG cells. It is well established that cAMP signals through cAMP response elements (CRE) located in target gene promoters, which interacts with members of the ATF/CREB/CREM bZIP transcription factor family in homodimeric or heterodimeric forms. Intracellular cAMP is converted from ATP by adenylate cyclase activated by membrane receptors; cAMP binds to the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) to free the catalytic subunit, which enters the nucleus and phosphorylates CREB at serine 133 or CREM at serine 117, resulting in the recruitment of ubiquitous co-activators CBP/p300 to promote gene transcription (18De Cesare D. Fimia G.M. Sassone-Corsi P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 281-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar –20Andrisani O.M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1999; 9: 19-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, a number of CREs have been identified in renin gene promoters that play crucial roles in renin gene transcription. For example, in the human renin gene promoter, a CRE identified at –219 is bound by CREB and is partially responsible for cAMP induction in chorionic cells (21Germain S. Konoshita T. Philippe J. Corvol P. Pinet F. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); another study also shows that renin transcription activation by cAMP is partly mediated by a CREB-dependent mechanism via this CRE in Calu-6 cells (22Ying L. Morris B.J. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2412-2420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the mouse Ren-1d gene promoter, an overlapping cAMP-response element and a negative response element from –619 to –588, known as CNRE, is reported to be bound by LXRα and respond to cAMP stimulation (10Tamura K. Chen Y.E. Horiuchi M. Chen Q. Daviet L. Yang Z. Lopez-Ilasaca M. Mu H. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8513-8518Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the Ren-1c promoter, a CRE at –2688 is bound by CREB/CREM and is essential for the high level of basal renin expression in As4.1 cells (13Pan L. Black T.A. Shi Q. Jones C.A. Petrovic N. Loudon J. Kane C. Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45530-45538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). cAMP has been reported to stimulate renin gene transcription in As4.1 cells (23Klar J. Sandner P. Muller M.W. Kurtz A. Pflugers Arch. 2002; 444: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have demonstrated that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), the hormonal form of vitamin D, is a crucial negative regulator of renin biosynthesis (24Li Y.C. Kong J. Wei M. Chen Z.F. Liu S.Q. Cao L.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). The repressive activity of 1,25(OH)2D3 is mediated by the vitamin D receptor (VDR), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily (25Haussler M.R. Whitfield G.K. Haussler C.A. Hsieh J.-C. Thompson P.D. Selznick S.H. Dominguez C.E. Jurutka P.W. J. Bone Mineral. Res. 1998; 13: 325-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). Mice lacking the VDR or deficient in vitamin D develop hyperreninemia, high blood pressure, cardiac hypertrophy, and other renal abnormalities (24Li Y.C. Kong J. Wei M. Chen Z.F. Liu S.Q. Cao L.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar, 26Kong J. Li Y.C. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp.

Metab. 2005; 288: E125-E132Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Analysis of the Ren-1c gene promoter reveals that 1,25(OH)2D3 negatively regulates renin gene transcription (24Li Y.C. Kong J. Wei M. Chen Z.F. Liu S.Q. Cao L.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar); however, the molecular mechanism underlying this transcriptional repression remains unclear. In the present study we have addressed this important question by molecular approaches. We found that the transrepression of renin gene expression by 1,25(OH)2D3 is mediated by the CRE within the enhancer in the renin gene promoter. Our study identifies the cAMP signaling pathway, a major regulatory pathway involved in renin biosynthesis, as the target of vitamin D in this negative regulation. Plasmid Construction—Construction of the 4.1-kb Ren-1c promoter reporter, pGL4.1k-Luc (see construct A in Fig. 1), has been described previously (24Li Y.C. Kong J. Wei M. Chen Z.F. Liu S.Q. Cao L.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). Deletion constructs of the Ren-1c promoter luciferase reporter were mostly obtained using convenient restriction sites within the DNA sequence of the promoter. Constructs B, C, D, and E were generated by deleting the regions of the Ren-1c 4.1 kb promoter 5′ to the restriction sites at –3205 (SpeI), –2673 (BstE II), –1729 (EcoR I) and –1219 (KpnI), respectively. Construct F was made by deleting the fragment from –1729 (EcoRI) to –392 (StuI) from construct B. Constructs G and H were generated by cloning an 803-bp PCR fragment from –3245 to –2442 or a 480-bp PCR fragment from –2922 to –2442, respectively, into the SacI/BglII sites in pGL-117bp plasmid described previously (24Li Y.C. Kong J. Wei M. Chen Z.F. Liu S.Q. Cao L.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). pSBX was generated by deleting the BstXI (–2682)-BglII fragment from construct H; pSBE was generated by deleting the BstEII (–2673)-BglII fragment from construct H; pBXB was generated by deleting the SacI-BstXI (–2682) fragment from construct H. p4-6, p4-7, p5-6, and p5-7 were derived by cloning into the SacI/BglII sites of pGL-117bp the PCR fragments from –2818 to –2647, –2818 to –2671, –2725 to –2647 or –2725 to –2671, respectively, as illustrated in Fig. 1. pSV40E is the pGL3-Control purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). pSV40E-117 was generated by cloning the fragment from –117 to +6 into the Hind III site of pGL3-Enhancer vector (Promega). p3xCRE-117 was generated by inserting a synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide fragment containing 3 copies of the CRE (5′-TGACATCA-3′) of the Ren-1c promoter into the SacI/BglII sites of pGL-117bp, whereas the CRE reporter plasmid p4xCRE-Luc was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). p4-6mCRE was generated by mutating the CRE sequence (5′-TGACATCA-3′) in p4-6 to 5′-TGt-gATCA-3′, and p4-6mRARE generated by mutating one RARE half-site (5′-TGACCT-3′) to 5′-TttCCT-3′, both using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. pcDNA-hVDR(-AF-2) was constructed by cloning PCR-generated hVDR-(1–413) cDNA fragment into pcDNA3.1. pcDNA-hVDRR274L and pcDNA-hVDRR391C were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using pcDNA-hVDR as the template (QuikChange mutagenesis kit). pVP16-CREB was kindly provided by Dr. Richard Goodman (Oregon Health and Science University). Cell Culture—As4.1, HEK293, and mesangial cells (MC, SV40 MES 13) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). As4.1 cells were JG cells derived from kidney tumors of SV40 T antigen transgenic mice (7Sigmund C.D. Okuyama K. Ingelfinger J. Jones C.A. Mullins J.J. Kane C. Kim U. Wu C.Z. Kenny L. Rustum Y.

As4.1 cells stably transfected with hVDR, namely As4.1-hVDR cells, has been described previously (24Li Y.C. Kong J. Wei M. Chen Z.F. Liu S.Q. Cao L.P. J. Clin.

Kong J. Wei M. Chen Z.F. Liu S.Q. Cao L.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). As4.1 and HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin and streptomycin, and MCs were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and penicillin and streptomycin. No retinoids were present or added in the media. All cells were grown in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Luciferase Reporter Assays—Cells were cultured in 24-well plates to 60–70% confluency and transiently co-transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid and the pRL-TK plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Six hours after transfection, the cells were treated for 24–36 h with 1,25(OH)2D3 (2 × 10–8m), forskolin (1 μm), 8-bromo-cAMP (1 μm), H89 (5 μm) or in combinations as indicated in each specific experiment. In some experiments, the cells were co-transfected with expression plasmid for CREB, CBP, or p300 as indicated. Luciferase activity was determined using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter assay system (Promega) and a Luminometer TD-20/20 (Turner Designs). Each transfection was carried out in triplicate and repeated at least three times. Luciferase activity was normalized to the Renilla luciferase activity. In some experiments, pGL3-Basic was included in cell co-transfection for calculation of fold induction. All transfection experiments were repeated at least twice. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—As4.1-hVDR cells grown in 10-cm dishes were treated with ethanol or 2 × 10–8m 1,25(OH)2D3 for 24 h. Nuclear extracts were obtained by following an established method (28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kinston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.

Briefly, cells were scraped and suspended in ice-cold hypotonic solution (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 10 min on ice and homogenized, and the nuclei were collected by centrifugation. The nuclei were suspended in low salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). KCl concentration was then adjusted to 0.3 m by addition of 4 m KCl, and the nuclear suspension was rocked at 4 °C for 30 min. The nuclear extract was collected by centrifugation at 25,000 × g. For EMSA, double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide probes were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using polynucleotide kinase and purified with spin columns. Probe A is 5′-ATGGTGACCTGGCTGTACTCTGACCTCTG-3′ (Underlined are the RAR and RXR binding sites); Probe B is 5′-AATCCTCCCAATGACATCACTAACCA-3′ (the CRE is underlined). The labeled probe was incubated with nuclear extracts (10 μg) at room temperature for 30 min in the presence of 100 μg/ml polyd(I:C), and the mixture was electrophoresed on a 4% non-denatured polyacrylamide gel (28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kinston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, 1994: 12.0.1-12.11.11Google Scholar). Specificity of protein-DNA interaction was confirmed by competition with excess unlabeled probes. Incubation with anti-CREB-1 or anti-CREM-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was also used to confirm the presence of the corresponding protein in the DNA-protein complex. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film for autoradiography. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—ChIP assays were performed using a commercial kit from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY) with some modifications. Briefly, As4.1-hVDR cells were treated with ethanol or 2 × 10–8m 1,25(OH)2D3. After 24 h, the cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde to cross-link the histones and genomic DNA. The cells were lysed and sonicated to shear the chromatin. The sonicated chromatin was incubated with anti-CREB-1, anti-CREM-1, anti-CBP, or anti-VDR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or with non-immune IgG as controls. After an overnight incubation, the chromatin-antibody complex was precipitated with protein-A-agarose beads and digested with proteinase K to remove the proteins. The DNA isolated from the complex was subject to PCR amplification using primers flanking the CRE site in the Ren-1c gene promoter: 5′-–2786GAACTTGTAGGTCCTGCCCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-–2567CAAACTATAGATCAGGCAGG-3′ (reverse), or primers flanking the VDRE in Cyp24a1 gene promoter reported previously (29Kim S. Yamazaki M. Zella L.A. Shevde N.K. Pike J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6469-6486Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar): 5′-GGTTATCTCCGGGGTGGAGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGTGGCCAATGAGCACGC-3′ (reverse). The PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Northern Blot—Renin mRNA was determined by Northern blot analysis as described previously (24Li Y.C. Kong J. Wei M. Chen Z.F. Liu S.Q. Cao L.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). Briefly, As4.1 cells were treated with different reagents as indicated for 24 h, and total cellular RNAs were extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The RNAs were separated on agarose gel and transferred onto nylon membranes. The membranes were hybridized with 32P-labeled renin cDNA probe. The membranes were then stripped and rehybridized with 36B4 cDNA probe for internal loading control. The mRNA transcripts were detected by autoradiography. GST Pull-down Assays—pGEX-hVDR was constructed by cloning a PCR-generated cDNA sequence encoding the hinge and ligand-binding domain (LBD) of hVDR (amino acids 110–427) into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) as reported previously (30Rachez C. Suldan Z. Ward J. Chang C.P. Burakov D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Freedman L.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1787-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). pGEX-4T-1 and pGEX-hVDR were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 bacteria and GST and GST-LBD-VDR fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the instruction from the manufacturer, and protein purity was determine by SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Blue. For the assay, HEK293 cells were transfected with pCMV-CREB using Lipofectamine 2000. After cultured for 24 h, the transfected cells were lysed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For binding, GST or GST-LBD-VDR beads were mixed with 500 μg of lysates containing a proteinase inhibitor mixture, and the mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 2 h in the absence or presence of 10–7m 1,25(OH)2D3 in the binding buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA pH 8.0, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The beads were precipitated by centrifugation and washed four times with 0.5 ml of binding buffer. The beads were then suspended in Laemmli buffer, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). After being transfered onto an Immobilon-P membrane, CREB was visualized by Western blot assay using anti-CREB antibody. Two DNA Fragments in the Ren-1c Promoter Mediate Renin Transrepression by 1,25(OH)2D3—Our previous studies have shown that 1,25(OH)2D3 suppresses renin gene transcription (24Li Y.C. Kong J. Wei M. Chen Z.F. Liu S.Q. Cao L.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). To further explore the molecular mechanism of this transrepression, we systematically analyzed the 4.1-kb 5′-flanking region of the Ren-1c gene by a sequential deletion strategy. The 4.1-kb Ren-1c promoter contains all cis-elements required for tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific expression of the renin gene, as well as for response to a variety of physiological stimuli (5Jones C.A.

Wei M. Chen Z.F. Liu S.Q. Cao L.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A, construct A). A series of deletion constructs were generated and used to transfect As4.1-hVDR cells for luciferase reporter assays. As shown in Fig. 1A, all constructs that contain the previously identified 242-bp enhancer region between –2866 and –2625 (8Petrovic N. Black T.A. Fabian J.R. Kane C. Jones C.A. Loudon J.A. Abonia J.P. Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22499-22505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) (i.e. constructs A, B, F, G, and H) maintained a high basal activity, and their activity was markedly suppressed by 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment. In contrast, in constructs that lack this enhancer region (i.e. constructs C, D, and E), the basal activity was decreased drastically as expected, and the activity was barely suppressed by 1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 1A). To narrow down the DNA fragments that mediate the vitamin D transrepression, we subjected construct H, the shortest construct in this series of deletion, to further deletion analyses. As shown in Fig. 1B, once again, luciferase constructs (i.e. pBXB and p5-7) lacking the enhancer region had little activity, while the activity of all enhancer-containing constructs was high and suppressed by 1,25(OH)2D3. These studies revealed that two DNA fragments in the Ren-1c promoter, a 78-bp fragment from –2725 to –2647 that contains a CRE at –2688 (designated as distal fragment, see Fig. 4A for the sequence) and a 121-bp fragment from –117 to +6 that is the minimal promoter (designated as proximal fragment), together were sufficient to mediate 1,25(OH)2D3-induced transrepression (see construct p5-6 in Fig. 1B). When the distal fragment was replaced with SV40 enhancer (pSV40E-117) or three copies of the CRE sequence (p3xCRE-117 in Fig. 1C), the basal activity was dramatically reduced as expected; interestingly, however, in contrast to the pSV40E construct that was made of SV40 enhancer and promoter, 1,25(OH)2D3 was able to inhibit the activity of pSV40E-117 and p3xCRE-117 by 19 and 38%, respectively (Fig. 1C). These data suggest that both the minimal promoter and the CRE are crucial for this negative regulation. We mainly focused on the distal fragment in this study. The CRE Is Required for 1,25(OH)2D3-induced Transrepression—Cyclic AMP is long known to be a potent stimulator of renin biosynthesis. The CRE within the distal fragment is known to play a critical role in basal renin expression in As4.1 cells (13Pan L. Black T.A. Shi Q. Jones C.A. Petrovic N. Loudon J. Kane C. Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45530-45538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To test whether vitamin D suppresses renin expression by targeting the CRE, we determined the effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 using the p5-6 reporter construct, which contained the CRE in the distal fragment (Fig. 2A). As expected, 1,25(OH)2D3 markedly inhibited the promoter activity in As4.1-hVDR cells (Fig. 2B). Because As4.1 cells did not respond to forskolin (Fig. 2B) because of the constitutively active PKA pathway as reported previously (13Pan L. Black T.A. Shi Q. Jones C.A. Petrovic N. Loudon J. Kane C. Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45530-45538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), we explored the activity using mesangial cells (MCs) and HEK293 cells. In these cells, the promoter activity was dramatically induced by forskolin, and the induction was markedly attenuated by 1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 2, C and D). One difference between these cell lines was that 1,25(OH)2D3 always inhibited the promoter activity much more in As4.1 cells (by 70–80%) than in MCs or HEK293 cells (by 40–50%). As expected, forskolin induction was blocked by H89, a PKA inhibitor (Fig. 2E). Therefore, the CRE in the distal fragment can be activated by the PKA pathway and suppressed by vitamin D. Similar vitamin D regulation was observed using p4xCRE-Luc reporter, a universal CRE reporter that contains 4 copies of consensus CRE sequence 5′-TGACGTCA-3′ (data not shown). To validate that the CRE is directly involved in the repression of renin gene induced by 1,25(OH)2D3, we mutated the CRE site by site-directed mutagenesis in the p4-6 reporter construct to generate p4-6mCRE (Fig. 2F). We chose p4-6 because of its high basal activity (Fig. 1B), so that the activity of the mutant construct would still be high enough for detection. Indeed, mutation of the CRE site in p4-6 reporter reduced the activity by >80%. Interestingly, the CRE mutation markedly diminished, but did not completely eliminate, the repressive effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 in As4.1 cells. 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibited p4-6 activity by 80% and p4-6mCRE by 30% (Fig. 2G, compare p4-6 and p4-6mCRE), suggesting that both the CRE and the proximal fragment are critical for vitamin D inhibition of renin expression. Because the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway is constitutively active in As4.1 cells (13Pan L. Black T.A. Shi Q. Jones C.A. Petrovic N. Loudon J. Kane C. Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45530-45538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), we used MCs to confirm the data. As expected, forskolin dramatically stimulated the activity of p4-6, and 1,25(OH)2D3 suppressed the basal as well as forskolin-induced p4-6 activity in MCs (Fig. 2H). Most interestingly, when p4-6mCRE was used to transfect MCs, neither forskolin stimulation nor vitamin D inhibition was observed (Fig. 2I), confirming that the CRE is absolutely required to mediate the suppression of renin transcription by 1,25(OH)2D3. Unlike As4.1 cells, mutation of the CRE completely eliminated the vitamin D repression in MCs, sug"

When large amounts of heat are transported through a molecule, a crucial process in molecular electronic devices, energy is carried by discrete molecular vibrational excitations. We studied heat transport through self-assembled monolayers of long-chain hydrocarbon molecules anchored to a gold substrate by ultrafast heating of the gold with a femtosecond laser pulse. When the heat reached the methyl groups at the chain ends, a nonlinear coherent vibrational spectroscopy technique detected the resulting thermally induced disorder. The flow of heat into the chains was limited by the interface conductance. The leading edge of the heat burst traveled ballistically along the chains at a velocity of 1 kilometer per second. The molecular conductance per chain was 50 picowatts per kelvin."

The pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy in this mutant (hR120GCryAB) is poorly understood. Here, we show that transgenic mice overexpressing cardiac-specific hR120GCryAB recapitulate the cardiomyopathy in humans and find that the mice are under reductive stress. The myopathic hearts show an increased recycling of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to reduced glutathione (GSH), which is due to the augmented expression and enzymatic activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), glutathione reductase, and glutathione peroxidase. The intercross of hR120GCryAB cardiomyopathic animals with mice with reduced G6PD levels rescues the progeny from cardiac hypertrophy and protein aggregation. These findings demonstrate that dysregulation of G6PD activity is necessary and sufficient for maladaptive reductive stress and suggest a novel therapeutic target for abrogating R120GCryAB cardiomyopathy and heart failure in humans."

We have shown that most of these sites have diverged across these species, far exceeding the interspecies variation in orthologous genes. A group of Ste12 targets was shown to be bound only in S. mikatae and S. bayanus under pseudohyphal conditions. Many of these genes are targets of Ste12 during mating in S. cerevisiae, indicating that specialization between the two pathways has occurred in this species. Transcription factor binding sites have therefore diverged substantially faster than ortholog content. Thus, gene regulation resulting from transcription factor binding is likely to be a major cause of divergence between related species."
https://openalex.org/W1982053398,"Tricyclic antidepressants exert their pharmacological effect—inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine—by directly blocking neurotransmitter transporters (SERT, NET, and DAT, respectively) in the presynaptic membrane. The drug-binding site and the mechanism of this inhibition are poorly understood. We determined the crystal structure at 2.9 angstroms of the bacterial leucine transporter (LeuT), a homolog of SERT, NET, and DAT, in complex with leucine and the antidepressant desipramine. Desipramine binds at the inner end of the extracellular cavity of the transporter and is held in place by a hairpin loop and by a salt bridge. This binding site is separated from the leucine-binding site by the extracellular gate of the transporter. By directly locking the gate, desipramine prevents conformational changes and blocks substrate transport. Mutagenesis experiments on human SERT and DAT indicate that both the desipramine-binding site and its inhibition mechanism are probably conserved in the human neurotransmitter transporters."

However, the molecular basis of the osteoclast activation in this process has not been fully studied. In order to identify the key mediators for the anabolic effects of PTH, we performed microarray using RNA from the femora of 3-month-old Sprague-Dawley female rats injected daily with hPTH-(1-34) to increase bone formation or vehicle. This was compared with rats receiving hPTH-(1-34) in a catabolic protocol by continuous infusion. PTH-(1-34) regulated numerous genes (∼1,000), but differentially, in both regimes (see accompanying article, Ref. 4Li X. Liu H. Qin L. Tamasi J. Bergenstock M. Shapses S. Feyen J.H.M. Notterman D.A. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33086-33097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Notably, in the anabolic protocol, a number of cytokines and chemokines, RANKL, interleukin-6, CXCL1, and CCL2 (MCP-1), were highly induced. In contrast, none of these were significantly increased, by microarray, in the catabolic protocol. The chemokine, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1, CCL2), was found to be the most highly stimulated gene from 14-day intermittent hPTH-(1-34) or hPTH-(1-31) administration (both cause over 100-fold changes). With continuous infusion of PTH, the MCP-1 mRNA was elevated less than 2-fold, and this difference indicates a potentially important role for MCP-1 in the anabolic effect of PTH. Chemokines are bioactive peptides that regulate leukocyte activation and migration. They are essential mediators of inflammation and are crucial for the control of viral infections.

It is known that expression of MCP-1 is temporally and spatially associated with the recruitment of monocytes in both osseous inflammation and during developmentally regulated bone remodeling in the process of tooth eruption (9Graves D.T. Jiang Y. Valente A.J. Histol. Histopathol. 1999; 14: 1347-1354PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro studies have shown that osteoclasts in both mice and humans may form directly from precursor cell populations of monocytes and macrophages (10Udagawa N. Takahashi N. Akatsu T. Tanaka H.

It is very likely that MCP-1 may play a role in hormone-stimulated bone remodeling through action on osteoclasts. However, the relationship between MCP-1 and PTH, one of the most effective hormones regulating bone remodeling, has never been investigated. Here we propose a model suggesting that PTH-induced osteoblastic expression of MCP-1 is involved in osteoclast recruitment and differentiation at the stage of fusion and multinucleation of osteoclast precursors. This hypothesis provides a rationale for increased osteoclast activity in the anabolic effect of PTH, apart from RANKL stimulation, to initiate greater bone remodeling in a transient time-dependent fashion. Collectively, our data strongly point toward MCP-1 being an important molecule for communication between osteoblasts and osteoclasts in the anabolic effect of PTH. Chemicals—Synthetic PTH-(1-34) (human), PTH-(3-34) (bovine), and PTH-(1-31) (human), were purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA). Inhibitors H-89 and GF109203X were purchased from Calbiochem. Rat PTH-(1-34), 8-bromo-cAMP, PMA, and cycloheximide were obtained from Sigma. Recombinant rat/murine RANKL, M-CSF, MCP-1, and neutralizing anti-MCP-1 antibody were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Penicillin/streptomycin was obtained from Invitrogen. In Vivo Treatment of PTH in Rats—Sprague-Dawley rats (3-month-old female, about 250 g) were purchased from Taconic Farms, Inc. (Germantown, NY). For the anabolic protocol, rats were injected subcutaneously with vehicle (0.9% saline solution) or hPTH-(1-34) (8 μg/100 g) and euthanized using CO2 at the indicated time after injection. For the catabolic protocol, vehicle (0.9% saline solution) or hPTH-(1-34) in a final volume of 200 μl was continuously infused into animals at a nominal pumping rate of 1 μl/h by Alzet osmotic pumps (DURECT Corp.) implanted subcutaneously; continuous infusion of PTH-(1-34) was at 4 μg/100 g/day for the indicated time to 3-month-old female Sprague-Dawley rats (at least four animals per group). The animal protocols were approved by the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The primary spongiosa samples from the distal femur were harvested immediately after sacrifice as described previously (11Onyia J.E. Bidwell J. Herring J. Hulman J. Hock J.M.

Analysis of mRNA Abundance by Real Time RT-PCR—Cells or tissues were harvested at the indicated time points after PTH treatment. As described earlier (12Qin L. Li X. Ko J.K. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3104-3111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), total RNA was isolated using TRI Reagent® (Sigma) followed by purification with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). A TaqMan® reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) was used to reverse-transcribe mRNA into cDNA. Following this, PCR was performed on Opticon (MJ Research) using a SYBR® Green PCR core kit (Applied Biosystems). The primers used for the RT-PCR are summarized in Table 1. For cell culture samples, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as an internal control.

For serum starvation, osteoblastic cells were allowed to grow to 70-80% confluence and then switched to serum-free minimal essential medium for 1 day before the addition of PTH. Rat primary calvarial osteoblastic cells were obtained and cultured as described previously (13Shalhoub V. Gerstenfeld L.C. Collart D. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5318-5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Before PTH treatment, these cells were serum-starved for 1 day. RAW 264.7 cells were plated at 106 cells/cm2 concentration in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 5,000 units/ml). The cells were cultured in 5% CO2 in a humidified environment. Mouse osteoclasts were cultured from bone marrow isolated from femora and tibiae of 4-6-week-old wild-type B6/129 mice. Briefly, bone marrow was flushed from long bones with serum-free α-minimum Eagle's medium, and the marrow clumps were broken down by passing media through a syringe with an 18-gauge needle; after centrifugation, the cell pellets were resuspended in 10% α-minimum Eagle's medium and incubated in tissue culture dishes at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were stimulated with the indicated concentration of cytokines (M-CSF, 30 ng/ml; RANKL, 50 ng/ml) from the time of culture; fresh cytokines were added every other day until day 6 or day 10 (for bone resorption assay only) (14Kitaura H.

MCP-1 ELISA—A rat MCP-1-specific ELISA kit was purchased from BIOSOURCE to measure the protein level of MCP-1 in cell culture media. Assays were performed as recommended by the manufacturer to determine levels of secreted MCP-1 in UMR 106-01 cell culture media that had been concentrated in Amicon Ultra spin columns (Millipore, Billerica, MA) from 4 ml to a 500-μl volume. Values were calculated from standard curves set up for each assay. Supernatants were always run in duplicate, and the variance between the two replicates averaged less than 10%. Chemotaxis Assay—This method was performed as described previously (16Wuyts A. Proost P. Froyen G. Haelens A. Billiau A. Opdenakker G. Van Damme J.

Res. 1999; 14: 362-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, serial dilutions of MCP-1 or conditioned media from UMR 106-01 cell culture media treated with PTH-(1-34) for 2 h were added to the bottom wells of a 96-well chemotaxis chamber (Neuro Probe, Inc.) with osteoclasts or the precursors scraped off from the culture dishes with a rubber-tipped cell scraper (19Collin-Osdoby P. Yu X. Zheng H. Osdoby P. Methods Mol. Med. 2003; 80: 153-166PubMed Google Scholar) and placed on the top of the membrane (8-μm pores). After incubating 6 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator, chambers were disassembled, and the excess cells were mechanically removed from the applied side of the membranes. Membranes were fixed with methanol and processed for TRAP staining followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin. Cells positive for TRAP were identified as osteoclasts. Migration was quantitated by cell counts in six fields (×200 magnification) of each well on the semi-membrane by light microscopy using image analysis software (SPOT Advanced; Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.). The conditioned media were concentrated in Amicon Ultra spin columns (Millipore, Billerica, MA) from 10 ml to a 100-μl volume before inclusion in the chemotaxis assay. Conditioned media prepared in this way generally contained ∼25 ng/ml MCP-1 (in the concentrated media) as determined by ELISA. In experiments to test the specificity of the chemotactic effect of MCP-1, the medium containing the recombinant MCP-1 or concentrated conditioned media was incubated with 2.5 μg/ml of either rabbit IgG or anti-MCP-1 neutralizing antibody (polyclonal) at room temperature for 2 h before being used to study chemotaxis of pre/osteoclast cells as described above. Osteoclastogenesis—A serial dilution of recombinant rat MCP-1 (10-200 ng/ml) with or without RANKL and M-CSF (in primary osteoclast culture only) was added to cell culture media for the indicated time, and osteoclast differentiation was then assessed by measuring the activity of TRAP, a marker enzyme of osteoclasts, using acid phosphatase kit 387-A (Sigma) and by the direct enumeration of TRAP-positive, morphologically distinct, multinucleated osteoclasts (20Igarashi K. Woo J.T. Stern P.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Woo J.T. Kasai S. Stern P.H. Nagai K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 650-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, the specimens were fixed for 30 s and then stained with naphthol AS-BI-phosphate and a tartrate solution for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by counterstaining with a hematoxylin solution. Osteoclasts were determined to be TRAP-positive staining multinuclear (>3 nuclei) cells using light microscopy. The total number of TRAP-positive cells and the number of nuclei per TRAP-positive cell in each well were counted. The morphological features of osteoclasts were also photographed. Bone Resorption Assay—Mice bone marrow cells were plated onto BioCoat™ Osteologic™ disks (BD Biosciences) under the same culture conditions as described above. The disk incorporates an artificial bone analog in the form of sub-micron calcium phosphate films that can be resorbed on transparent quartz substrates. After a 10-day culture, 1 ml of bleach solution (∼6% NaOCl, ∼5.2% NaCl) was added to each well. Five min later, the disks were washed with distilled water to remove adherent cells. The disks were then air dried and examined by light microscopy. Statistics—All data are based on a minimum of three replicate experiments performed independently on different occasions, unless otherwise stated. Data are shown as mean ± S.E. in the figures. Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance and Tukey's test was used for statistical analyses. PTH Regulates MCP-1 mRNA Abundance in Vivo and in Vitro—Recent microarray studies from our laboratory identified MCP-1 as the most highly regulated target gene in an anabolic PTH protocol in rats, which was not significantly stimulated in a catabolic protocol (4Li X. Liu H. Qin L. Tamasi J. Bergenstock M. Shapses S. Feyen J.H.M. Notterman D.A. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33086-33097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We confirmed this result by performing real time RT-PCR using RNA isolated from the metaphyseal region of the femora of rats that had received intermittent injections of PTH. As shown in Fig. 1A, daily injections of hPTH-(1-34) for 1, 3, 7, 10, and 14 days greatly stimulated MCP-1 mRNA expression in this bone tissue in rats 1 h after the injection. This induction occurs very quickly, since there is a 32-fold increase in the mRNA expression of MCP-1 1 h after even one PTH injection. Interestingly, the fold simulation of MCP-1 mRNA level kept increasing with longer PTH treatment resulting in an increase of more than 200-fold with 14 daily intermittent injections of PTH. In the PTH catabolic treatment model where hPTH-(1-34) was continuously infused into rats subcutaneously, the MCP-1 mRNA level was significantly increased in this region of bone at 6 h and 6 and 14 days but was never greater than 2.5-fold of the vehicle controls (Fig. 1B). To confirm that the stimulation of MCP-1 is an osteoblastic response to PTH, we examined the MCP-1 mRNA level after PTH-(1-34) (10-8 m) administration in osteoblastic cells, the UMR 106-01 cell line, and primary osteoblastic cells. The results indicate that PTH treatment stimulates MCP-1 mRNA levels by 20-fold in the UMR cells with the peak level around 90 min after PTH treatment (Fig. 1C). Correspondingly, ELISA showed that secreted MCP-1 protein in UMR cell culture media reached a peak level 2 h after PTH-(1-34) (10-8 m) treatment (Fig. 2). Furthermore, MCP-1 stimulation by PTH is also observed in rat primary calvarial osteoblastic cells (Fig. 1D). These cells mimic the development of osteoblasts in vivo by transitioning sequentially through three stages (proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization) when cultured in vitro. At all developmental stages, MCP-1 levels were stimulated at 1 h and then decreased to basal levels thereafter. The highest stimulation (6.4-fold) by PTH is observed in the differentiation stage, and the lowest (2.7-fold) is seen in the mineralization stage. It is possible that the osteocyte is also able to produce MCP-1, but these cells would make a minor contribution in the region of the femora (primary spongiosa) analyzed. PTH Stimulation of MCP-1 Is Dose-dependent via the PKA Pathway and Is a Primary Response—We observed significant increases in MCP-1 mRNA in UMR cells at low doses of PTH (10-10 m) when we performed a dose-response experiment with PTH-(1-34). Although 10-10 m PTH was sufficient to increase MCP-1 mRNA significantly (p < 0.05), maximal effects were observed with 10-8 m PTH, and half-maximal stimulation was calculated to occur with 5 × 10-9 m PTH (Fig. 3A). PTH signals through both PKA and PKC pathways after binding with its receptor, PTH1R, on the osteoblast membrane (22Civitelli R. Reid I.R. Westbrook S. Avioli L.V. Hruska K.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 225: E660-E667Google Scholar, 23Partridge N.C. Kemp B. Veroni M.C. Martin T.J. Endocrinology. 1981; 108: 220-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To study which pathway PTH uses to regulate MCP-1, we took advantage of different peptide fragments of PTH that activate different pathways as well as inhibitors and activators of these pathways. As shown in Fig. 3C, hPTH-(1-31) (which activates PKA but not PKC) (24Chakravarthy B.R. Durkin J. Rixon R.H. Whitfield J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 1105-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 25Sabatini M. Lesur C. Pacherie M. Pastoureau P. Kucharczyk N. Fauchere J.L. Bonnet J. Bone (Elmsford). 1996; 18: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) retained the ability to stimulate MCP-1 mRNA levels after a 1-h treatment of UMR 106-01 cells (5.7-fold increase compared with 6-fold increase by rPTH-(1-34)). However, bovine PTH-(3-34) (which activates PKC but not PKA) (25Sabatini M. Lesur C. Pacherie M. Pastoureau P. Kucharczyk N. Fauchere J.L. Bonnet J. Bone (Elmsford). 1996; 18: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) failed to regulate the expression of MCP-1. In comparison, 8-bromo-cyclic AMP, a cell-permeable cAMP analog, stimulated the expression of MCP-1 about 5-fold, whereas PMA, an activator of the PKC pathway, had no effect. Consistent with these data, in the presence of the PKA inhibitor H-89, but not in the presence of the PKC inhibitor GF109203X, rPTH-(1-34) lost its ability to induce MCP-1, suggesting that this regulation is PKA-dependent but not PKC-dependent in osteoblastic cells. To determine whether PTH induction of MCP-1 is a primary response, UMR 106-01 cells were treated with rPTH-(1-34) (10-8 m) in the presence or the absence of cycloheximide. Fig. 3B shows that cycloheximide had no effect on the PTH induction of MCP-1, suggesting that this process does not require de novo protein synthesis (i.e. this effect is a primary response). Both MCP-1- and PTH-treated UMR Cell Line Conditioned Media Have Chemotactic Effects on Pre/Osteoclasts—Because the expression of the C-C motif chemokine receptor-2 and -4 (CCR2 and CCR4, the receptors for MCP-1) could not be detected by real time RT-PCR in osteoblastic cells (data not shown), we studied the effect of MCP-1 on osteoclasts and their precursors. First, murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells were used, which can differentiate into osteoclastic cells. RAW cells respond to RANKL stimulation in vitro to generate multinucleated osteoclasts (RAW osteoclasts), a hallmark characteristic of fully differentiated osteoclasts (26Hsu H. Lacey D. Dunstan C.R. Solovyev I. Colombero A. Timms E. Tan H.L. Elliott G. Sarosi I. Wang L. Xia X.Z. Elliott R. Chiu L. Black T. Scully S. Capparelli C. Morony S. Shimamoto G. Bass M.B. Boyle W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3540-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). RAW cells do not require M-CSF as a permissive factor in RANKL-induced formation of osteoclast differentiation and function (19Collin-Osdoby P. Yu X. Zheng H. Osdoby P. Methods Mol. Med. 2003; 80: 153-166PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hsu H. Lacey D. Dunstan C.R. Solovyev I. Colombero A. Timms E. Tan H.L. Elliott G. Sarosi I. Wang L. Xia X.Z. Elliott R. Chiu L. Black T. Scully S.

Res. 2002; 17: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), so the cells are only treated with RANKL to differentiate them into mature osteoclasts. In Fig. 4A, both recombinant MCP-1- and PTH-treated UMR cell conditioned media have strong chemotactic effects on RAW cells without RANKL treatment. From Fig. 4D we can see that the chemotactic effects of MCP-1 are blocked by the presence of a neutralizing antibody. More importantly, the MCP-1 antibody also significantly decreased the chemotactic potency of PTH-treated UMR cell culture media. Furthermore, we extended our study using osteoclast precursor cells isolated from mouse long bones to confirm the chemotactic effect on primary osteoclastic cultures. Recombinant MCP-1- and PTH-treated UMR cell culture media similarly showed strong chemotactic effects on primary osteoclast precursors (Fig. 4B). Taken together, the results indicate that MCP-1 has a strong chemotactic effect on pre-osteoclast cells, and MCP1 is likely a major chemotactic factor in PTH-treated UMR media, which causes pre-osteoclast migration. RAW cells and the pre-osteoclasts from mouse long bone were induced to differentiate by treatment with RANKL for 6 days. The osteoclasts were used in chemotactic assays. As shown in Fig. 4C, MCP-1- and PTH-treated UMR culture media also demonstrated a chemotactic effect on these differentiated multinucleated cells. Overall, the results indicate that MCP-1 has chemotactic effects on both the mature osteoclast and its precursor cells. MCP-1 Enhances RANKL-induced Osteoclastogenesis and Fusion—We found that exogenous MCP-1 positively stimulated osteoclast differentiation. Adding MCP-1 to the standard M-CSF and RANKL regime of primary osteoclast cultures for 6 days (with fresh cytokines fed every other day) significantly increased TRAP mRNA expression dose-dependently (50 and 100% increases with MCP-1 of 50 and 100 ng/ml specifically) (Fig. 5A). The effect of MCP-1 to facilitate pre-osteoclast differentiation was quite remarkable, with significantly increased number of nuclei in the TRAP-positive cells as well as fusion resulting in morphologically larger multinucleated osteoclasts (Fig. 5, B and D) when compared with cultures without addition of MCP-1. MCP-1 Increases Osteoclastic Mineral Dissolution in Vitro—More importantly, by using BD Biocoat osteologic disks with cultured mouse bone macrophages, we found MCP-1 significantly increased the dissolved areas at concentrations of both 50 and 100 ng/ml (Fig. 5, C and E). The mineral dissolution activity was increased by 2- and 3.5-fold with addition of 50 and 100 ng/ml of MCP-1. Parathyroid hormone is now accepted to have anabolic effects when injected intermittently; in fact, it is a highly effective treatment for osteoporosis. When given this way, PTH not only increases bone formation but also promotes bone remodeling (28Neer R.M. Arnaud C.D. Zanchetta J.R. Prince R. Gaich G.A. Reginster J.Y. Hodsman A.B. Eriksen E.F.

Both clinical and animal studies have shown that bisphosphonates, inhibitors of bone resorption, can blunt the anabolic response to PTH, suggesting that active bone resorption enhances the anabolic actions of PTH (1Delmas P.D.

https://openalex.org/W2067411979,"Parathyroid hormone (PTH) stimulates bone formation when injected daily but causes severe bone loss with continuous infusion. The mechanism of its paradoxical effects is still elusive. In this study, we compared changes in the gene expression profile in bone induced by intermittent or continuous treatment with three different PTH peptides, PTH-(1-34), -(1-31), and -(3-34), in Sprague-Dawley female rats. PTH-(1-34) regulated numerous genes (approximately 1,000), but differentially, in both regimes. PTH-(1-31) regulated a similar number of genes in the intermittent regimen but fewer in the continuous regimen, consistent with its less potent catabolic effect. PTH-(3-34) regulated very few genes in both regimes, which suggests the protein kinase C pathway plays a limited role in mediating the dual effects of PTH, whereas the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A pathway appears to predominate. In the intermittent treatment, many genes encoding signaling mediators, transcription factors, cytokines, and proteases/protease inhibitors are regulated rapidly and cyclically with each PTH injection; genes associated with skeletal development show a slowly accruing pattern of expression. With continuous treatment, some genes are regulated from 6 h, and the mRNA levels are sustained with a longer infusion, whereas others show a kinetic decrease and then increase later. Significant up-regulation of genes stimulating osteoclastogenesis in the anabolic regime suggests a provocative and paradoxical theme for the anabolic effect of PTH that a full anabolic response requires a transient up-regulation of genes classically associated with a resorptive response. Ingenuity pathway analysis was performed on the microarray data. A novel signaling network was established that is differentially regulated in the two PTH treatment regimes. Key regulators are suggested to be AREG, CCL2, WNT4, and cAMP-responsive element modulator."
https://openalex.org/W2071293940,"Modern laser technology has revolutionized the sensitivity and precision of spectroscopy by providing coherent light in a spectrum spanning the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet wavelength regimes. However, the generation of shorter-wavelength coherent pulses in the x-ray region has proven much more challenging. The recent emergence of high harmonic generation techniques opens the door to this possibility. Here we review the new science that is enabled by an ability to manipulate and control electrons on attosecond time scales, ranging from new tabletop sources of coherent x-rays to an ability to follow complex electron dynamics in molecules and materials. We also explore the implications of these advances for the future of molecular structural characterization schemes that currently rely so heavily on scattering from incoherent x-ray sources."

However, the mechanism underlying the antioxidant function of Bcl-2 is currently unknown. Recently, Bax and several Bcl-2 homology-3 domain (BH3)-only proteins (Bid, Puma, and Noxa) have been shown to induce a pro-oxidant state at mitochondria (1Kirkland R.A. Windelborn J.A. Kasprzak J.M.

Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 1647-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Given the opposing effects of Bcl-2 and Bax/BH3-only proteins on the redox state of mitochondria, we hypothesized that the antioxidant function of Bcl-2 is antagonized by its interaction with the BH3 domains of pro-apoptotic family members. Here, we show that BH3 mimetics that bind to a hydrophobic surface (the BH3 groove) of Bcl-2 induce GSH-sensitive mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in cerebellar granule neurons. BH3 mimetics displace a discrete mitochondrial GSH pool in neurons and suppress GSH transport into isolated rat brain mitochondria. Moreover, BH3 mimetics and the BH3-only protein, Bim, inhibit a novel interaction between Bcl-2 and GSH in vitro. These results suggest that Bcl-2 regulates an essential pool of mitochondrial GSH and that this regulation may depend upon Bcl-2 directly interacting with GSH via the BH3 groove. We conclude that this novel GSH binding property of Bcl-2 likely plays a central role in its antioxidant function at mitochondria. Bcl-2 protects cells against mitochondrial oxidative stress and subsequent apoptosis. However, the mechanism underlying the antioxidant function of Bcl-2 is currently unknown.

Given the opposing effects of Bcl-2 and Bax/BH3-only proteins on the redox state of mitochondria, we hypothesized that the antioxidant function of Bcl-2 is antagonized by its interaction with the BH3 domains of pro-apoptotic family members. Here, we show that BH3 mimetics that bind to a hydrophobic surface (the BH3 groove) of Bcl-2 induce GSH-sensitive mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in cerebellar granule neurons. BH3 mimetics displace a discrete mitochondrial GSH pool in neurons and suppress GSH transport into isolated rat brain mitochondria. Moreover, BH3 mimetics and the BH3-only protein, Bim, inhibit a novel interaction between Bcl-2 and GSH in vitro. These results suggest that Bcl-2 regulates an essential pool of mitochondrial GSH and that this regulation may depend upon Bcl-2 directly interacting with GSH via the BH3 groove. We conclude that this novel GSH binding property of Bcl-2 likely plays a central role in its antioxidant function at mitochondria. Mitochondrial oxidative stress and dysfunction underlie devastating neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). 2The abbreviations used are:ALSamyotrophic lateral sclerosisagagaroseANTadenine nucleotide translocaseBH3Bcl-2 homology-3 domainBioGEEbiotinylated GSH monoethyl esterCGNcerebellar granule neuronCy3-SACy3-StreptavidinDNP2,4-dinitrophenolDNPHdinitrophenylhydrazineGSHpxglutathione peroxidaseMPTP1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-pyridineDAPI4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromidePBSphosphate-buffered salineBSAbovine serum albumintBHtert-butylhydroperoxide.2The abbreviations used are:ALSamyotrophic lateral sclerosisagagaroseANTadenine nucleotide translocaseBH3Bcl-2 homology-3 domainBioGEEbiotinylated GSH monoethyl esterCGNcerebellar granule neuronCy3-SACy3-StreptavidinDNP2,4-dinitrophenolDNPHdinitrophenylhydrazineGSHpxglutathione peroxidaseMPTP1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-pyridineDAPI4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromidePBSphosphate-buffered salineBSAbovine serum albumintBHtert-butylhydroperoxide. For example, mitochondrial complex I is oxidatively damaged in Parkinson disease, and inhibitors of complex I (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) or rotenone) are used to model Parkinson disease in animals (5Keeney P.M. Xie J. Capaldi R.A. Bennett Jr., J.P. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 5256-5264Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 6Bove J. Prou D. Perier C. Przedborski S. NeuroRx. 2005; 2: 484-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Similarly, mitochondrial dysfunction precedes motor neuron death in the mutant SOD1 mouse model of ALS, and antioxidants targeted to the inner mitochondrial membrane enhance survival in this disease model (7Kong J.

Thus, elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that regulate mitochondrial oxidative stress would enhance the discovery of novel therapeutic agents for neurodegeneration. amyotrophic lateral sclerosis agarose adenine nucleotide translocase Bcl-2 homology-3 domain biotinylated GSH monoethyl ester cerebellar granule neuron Cy3-Streptavidin 2,4-dinitrophenol dinitrophenylhydrazine glutathione peroxidase 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-pyridine 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide phosphate-buffered saline bovine serum albumin tert-butylhydroperoxide. amyotrophic lateral sclerosis agarose adenine nucleotide translocase Bcl-2 homology-3 domain biotinylated GSH monoethyl ester cerebellar granule neuron Cy3-Streptavidin 2,4-dinitrophenol dinitrophenylhydrazine glutathione peroxidase 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-pyridine 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide phosphate-buffered saline bovine serum albumin tert-butylhydroperoxide. Loss-of-function of the pro-survival Bcl-2 protein contributes to mitochondrial oxidative stress in neurodegenerative disease. In addition to its ability to heterodimerize with and inhibit pro-apoptotic family members like Bax and BH3-only proteins (9Petros A.M. Olejniczak E.T. Fesik S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1644: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), Bcl-2 demonstrates at least two other protective functions. First, Bcl-2 regulates Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum by directly interacting with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (10Chen R. Valencia I. Zhong F. McColl K.S. Roderick H.L. Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Conway S.J. Holmes A.B. Mignery G.A. Velez P. Distelhorst C.W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Second, Bcl-2 displays an antioxidant-like action, particularly at the level of the mitochondria (11Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3279) Google Scholar, 12Kane D.J. Sarafian T.A. Anton R. Hahn H. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Ord T. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1993; 262: 1274-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). For instance, overexpression of Bcl-2 increases levels of the critical antioxidant, GSH, and inhibits mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death elicited by GSH-depleting reagents (12Kane D.J. Sarafian T.A. Anton R. Hahn H. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Ord T. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1993; 262: 1274-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar, 13Ellerby L.M. Ellerby H.M. Park S.M.

Conversely, Bcl-2-deficient mice display enhanced sensitivity to mitochondrial oxidative stress, exemplified by their increased susceptibility to MPTP neurotoxicity (15Hochman A. Sternin H. Gorodin S. Korsmeyer S. Ziv I. Melamed E. Offen D. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 741-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 loss-of-function in neurodegeneration is evidenced by marked reductions in Bcl-2 expression in the substantia nigra of MPTP-treated mice and in spinal motor neurons of ALS patients (16Vila M. Jackson-Lewis V. Vukosavic S. Djaldetti R. Liberatore G. Offen D. Korsmeyer S.J. Przedborski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2837-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 17Mu X. He J. Anderson D.W. Trojanowski J.Q. Springer J.E. Ann. Neurol. 1996; 40: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutant SOD1, which is associated with some forms of familial ALS, was recently shown to sequester Bcl-2 in nonfunctional aggregates at mitochondria (18Pasinelli P. Belford M.E. Lennon N. Bacskai B.J. Hyman B.T. Trotti D. Brown Jr., R.H. Neuron. 2004; 43: 19-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In accordance with these findings, overexpression of Bcl-2 is neuroprotective in animal models of Parkinson disease and ALS (19Yang L. Matthews R.T. Schulz J.B. Klockgether T. Liao A.W. Martinou J.C.

Although its antioxidant function was described more than a decade ago, Bcl-2 has no intrinsic antioxidant enzymatic or scavenging activity, and the mechanism by which it suppresses mitochondrial oxidative stress remains elusive. Similarly, little is known about how pro-apoptotic Bax and BH3-only proteins elicit a pro-oxidant state at mitochondria (1Kirkland R.A. Windelborn J.A. Kasprzak J.M. Franklin J.L. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6480-6490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kim J.Y. Ahn H.J. Ryu J.H. Suk K. Park J.H. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 3Ding W.X.

In the present study, we examined a potential role for the pro-apoptotic BH3 domain in neutralizing the antioxidant function of Bcl-2. Materials—HA14-1 (ethyl 2-amino-6-bromo-4-(1-cyano-2-ethoxy-2-oxoethyl)-4H-chromene-3-carboxylate), compound 6 (2,9-dimethoxy-11,12-dihydrodibenzo[c,g] (1, 2)-diazocine 5,6-dioxide), and GSH monoethyl ester were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and MitoSOX dye were obtained from Invitrogen.

COX IV antibody and actin polyclonal antibody were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Cy3- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies for immunocytochemistry were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc. (West Grove, PA). [3H]GSH was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and reagents for enhanced chemiluminescence were from Amersham Biosciences. Human recombinant Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w (C-terminal truncated, His-tagged proteins) were purchased from Oncogene Research Products (San Diego, CA). Recombinant human BimL (C-terminal truncated, His-tagged protein) was obtained from R & D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Cerebellar Granule Neuron (CGN) Culture—CGNs were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rat pups (postnatal day 7) as described previously (21Linseman D.A. Phelps R.A. Bouchard R.J. Le S.S. Laessig T.A. McClure M.L. Heidenreich K.A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9287-9297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CGNs were plated in basal modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 mm KCl, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at a density of 4.0 × 106 cells/well on poly-l-lysine-coated, 35-mm-diameter plastic dishes. Cytosine arabinoside (10 μm) was added to the culture medium at 24 h after plating to inhibit glial growth. The cultures were ∼95-99% pure for CGNs, and the experiments were performed after 6-8 days in culture. MTT Cell Viability Assay—CGNs were incubated with either 15 μm HA14-1 or 50 μm compound 6 (±2 mm GSH monoethyl ester) in serum-free culture medium containing 25 mm depolarizing potassium (25K-ser). After 24 h of incubation, the medium was removed, and CGNs were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and then incubated for 2 h with 500 μg/ml MTT diluted in 25K-ser. The MTT was removed, and 400 μl of Me2SO were added to each well to dissolve the formazan crystals. Each Me2SO sample was then transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged for 2 min at 10,000 rpm. A 100-μl aliquot of each sample was then diluted into 900 μl of deionized H2O, and the absorbance was read at a wavelength of 570 nm (background subtraction = 650 nm). The data were plotted as the percentage of cell viability relative to the control mean absorbance for each independent experiment (n = 4 experiments). Immunocytochemistry—CGNs plated on polyethyleneimine-coated glass coverslips at a density of ∼2.5 × 105 cells/coverslip were treated as described under “Results” for each experiment and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Next, CGNs were blocked and permeabilized for 90 min in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 5% BSA and 0.2% Triton X-100, followed by overnight (∼16 h) incubation at 4 °C with primary antibody diluted in 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2% BSA in PBS. The primary antibody was removed, and the coverslips were washed five times with PBS and then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies and DAPI diluted in 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The secondary antibody solution was removed, and the coverslips were washed five more times with PBS followed by mounting onto glass slides with 0.1% p-phenylenediamine in 75% glycerol in PBS to prevent quenching. The images were captured using an oil immersion objective (63× or 100×) on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope equipped with a Cooke Sensicam CCD camera and Slidebook Image analysis software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc., Denver, CO). Superoxide Measurement—CGNs were treated with 15 μm HA14-1 for 2 h in serum-free 25K medium. The neurons were then washed in PBS and incubated for 30 min with 1 μm MitoSOX dye diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's high glucose, phenol red-free medium (Invitrogen). The images were then captured of live cells using a Cy3 filter and a water immersion objective (63×). Cell Lysate Preparation—Following treatment as described under “Results,” the neurons were washed once with ice-cold PBS before being scraped into 250 μl of cell lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Each sample was then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 3 min, and the supernatant was removed. The protein concentrations were determined using a commercially available protein assay kit (Pierce). Aliquots of each sample (∼80 μg) were diluted in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and electrophoresed through polyacrylamide gels. The resolved proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences) for Western blotting. Western Blotting—Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were first blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 1% BSA and 0.01% sodium azide diluted in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T). The primary antibodies were diluted in the blocking solution, and the membranes were incubated with primary solution for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibody was removed, and the membranes were washed five times (5-min intervals) with PBS-T. Next, membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in PBS-T. The secondary antibody was washed off five times (5-min intervals) with PBS-T, and then immunoreactive proteins were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence. Identification of Carbonylated Proteins—Following a 6-h incubation in either control, 15 μm HA14-1 or 50 μm compound 6 conditions, the lysates were prepared from each sample in 150 μl of cell lysis buffer. A 50-μl aliquot of each lysate was transferred to a new tube to blot for nonmodified protein (i.e. ANT). A 400-μl volume of 10 mm DNPH (dissolved in 2 m HCl) was added to the remaining 100 μl of lysate for a total volume of 500 μl/tube. This solution was then incubated at room temperature for 1 h, with vortexing every 15 min. Next, the protein was precipitated by the addition of 500 μl of trichloroacetic acid (20% in ddH2O) to each sample followed by centrifugation for 3 min at 13,000 rpm. The supernatants were discarded, and the pellet was washed three times in ethanol/ethyl acetate (mixed 1:1 v/v) with 10-min intervals between washes. The final wash was allowed to completely evaporate, and the pellets were resuspended in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 10 min before loading onto a 15% polyacrylamide gel. The membranes were blotted with an antibody against DNP and then stripped and reprobed with an antibody against ANT. Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—CGNs were treated with 15 μm HA14-1 either in the presence or absence of 2 mm GSH for 2 h. Following incubation, CGNs were loaded with 200 nm JC-1 for 30 min at 37 °C, 10% CO2. The neurons were then washed three times with PBS and imaged live with a 63× water immersion objective through a JC-1 dual emission filter set. Visualization of Mitochondrial Structure—The mitochondria were stained with 200 nm Mitotracker green after a 24-h incubation in either control, 2 mm GSH, 15 μm HA14-1, HA14-1 + GSH, 50 μm compound 6, or compound 6 + GSH conditions. The neurons were stained with the Mitotracker dye for 30 min at 37 °C, 10% CO2, and the cells were imaged live with a 63× water objective through a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter. In Vivo Analysis of the Mitochondrial GSH Pool—CGNs were preincubated for 1 h with 250 μm BioGEE at 37 °C, 10% CO2. The cells were then incubated for an additional 2 h under either control or HA14-1 (15 μm) conditions. The neurons were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and blocked/permeabilized for 1 h in 5% BSA and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. The cells were then incubated for 90 min at room temperature with 1 μm Hoechst dye and streptavidin conjugated to Cy3 (1:200) to label the BioGEE. The images were captured with either a 63× or 100× oil immersion objective. The Cy3-streptavidin staining was quantified as either punctate or diffuse for ∼300 cells/condition from each of three independent experiments. Isolation of Mitochondria from Rat Brain—Isolation of rat brain mitochondria was performed as described previously (22Liang L.P. Patel M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 542-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Whole rat brains, excluding the cerebellum (∼0.5 g), were removed from 7-day-old rat pups and transferred to ice-cold isolation buffer containing 0.64 m sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. After separating the hemispheres, the tissue was homogenized in 2 ml of isolation buffer, using a loose pestle (5×) followed by a tight pestle (8×) to obtain a uniform slurry. Next, Percoll (final concentration, 12%) was added, and centrifugation was performed at 16,000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant (2 ml) was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in isolation buffer and gently applied to a 40%/19% (equal v/v) Percoll gradient and centrifuged again at 16,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. The mitochondrial layer was then attained from the approximate interface between the 19 and 40% layers and mixed with isolation buffer (1:4 v/v) in a new tube and then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. Approximately 0.5 ml of supernatant was left in the tube with the mitochondrial pellet, which was then resuspended in 5 ml of isolation buffer containing 5 mg/ml BSA and then centrifuged again at 7,500 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was poured off, and the final mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of isolation buffer/each brain. Percoll gradients were prepared fresh for each new isolation. (Amersham Biosciences). GSH Uptake Assay in Isolated Mitochondria—GSH transport into isolated mitochondria was measured by a modification of a previously published method (23Garcia-Ruiz C. Morales A. Colell A. Rodes J. Yi J.R. Kaplowitz N. Fernandez-Checa J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15946-15949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μl of rat brain mitochondria were added to 230 μl of GSH transport buffer (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 220 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% BSA (fatty acid-free), 5 mm succinate, and 1 mm potassium phosphate) at room temperature. The isolated mitochondria were then preincubated for ∼20 min with either 0.5 μl Me2SO (vehicle) or 20 μm HA14-1. A trace amount (0.5 μCi) of radiolabeled [3H]GSH in buffer containing unlabeled (cold) GSH at varying final concentrations (50 μm, 500 μm, or 5 mm) was then added to the isolated mitochondria, vortexed and incubated for 15 s at room temperature. A 1-ml volume of ice-cold transport buffer was then added to each tube, and the samples were pelleted and washed twice with 0.5 ml ice-cold buffer, and then 100 μl of 1 n NaOH were added to dissolve the final pellets. [3H]GSH uptake into the isolated mitochondria was counted by liquid scintillation. The data were calculated as percentages of [3H]GSH uptake relative to the control condition in the presence of 50 μm cold GSH (i.e. the condition with the greatest [3H]GSH uptake). Cell-free GSH Peroxidase (GSHpx) Assay—GSHpx assay buffer containing purified GSHpx (final concentration, 20 units/ml; isolated from human erythrocytes; Sigma-Aldrich) was preincubated for 20 min at room temperature (25 °C) alone or in the presence of either HA14-1 (20 μm) or an equivalent volume of Me2SO vehicle. After preincubation, tert-butylhydroperoxide (tBH; 300 μm) and NADPH assay reagent (yielding a final concentration of 0.25 mm NADPH, 2.1 mm reduced GSH, and 0.5 unit/ml GSH reductase, GSH peroxidase assay kit; Sigma-Aldrich) were added. The solutions were then incubated at 37 °C for 3-5 min, and the change in absorbance at 340 nm was read using assay buffer alone as a blank. The activity of GSHpx was calculated as the average change in NADPH absorbance per min. The conditions were assayed in triplicate for each of three experiments. GSHpx Assay in CGN Lysates—CGNs were treated for 4 h in control medium in the absence or presence of either HA14-1 (15 μm) or compound 6 (50 μm). After 4 h, the cells were lysed as described above, and the lysates were divided equally into two conditions: (+) or (-) tBH. Cell lysates were diluted in GSHpx assay buffer, and NADPH assay reagent (yielding a final concentration of 0.25 mm NADPH, 2.1 mm reduced GSH and 0.5 unit/ml GSH reductase) was added to all conditions. tBH (300 μm) was then added to the (+) tBH conditions. The lysates were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C, and the change in absorbance at 340 nm was recorded. Activity of GSHpx was calculated as the average change in NADPH absorbance/min within each condition, and the (-) tBH result was subtracted to account for any nonspecific NADPH oxidation. The conditions were performed in duplicate for each of three experiments. In Vitro GSH Binding Assay with Recombinant Bcl-2 Proteins— Fifty ng of His-tagged recombinant Bcl-2 (or Bcl-xL or Bcl-w) were added to 100 μl of cell lysis buffer (see “Cell Lysate Preparation”) that was modified by the deletion of Triton X-100 and the addition of 1 mm dithiothreitol. A 30-μl aliquot of either GSH-ag beads (4% agarose) or 4% agarose beads alone was added to the recombinant Bcl-2 proteins, and the samples were mixed by rotation for 1 h at 4 °C. When indicated, HA14-1 (at the concentrations specified), compound 6 (500 μm), or recombinant BimL (final concentration, 2 μm) were added to the recombinant Bcl-2 and samples were preincubated for 1 h at 4 °C prior to the addition of GSH-ag beads. Each sample was centrifuged for 2 min at 13,400 rpm, and the supernatants were discarded. The pellets were washed with ice-cold PBS, suspended in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and boiled for 10 min. The samples were then resolved on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels and detected with either a Bcl-2 antibody or an antibody to the 6× His epitope tag. Data Analysis—The results shown represent the means ± S.E. for the number (n) of independent experiments performed. Statistical differences were obtained either by one-way analysis of variance followed by a post-hoc Tukey's test or by an unpaired Student's t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. In general, images or immunoblots shown are representative of the results obtained in at least three independent experiments. Inhibition of Bcl-2 Induces Mitochondrial Oxidative Stress and GSH-sensitive Neuronal Apoptosis—We utilized two uniquely structured BH3 mimetics, HA14-1 or compound 6 (Fig. 1A), to inhibit endogenous Bcl-2 activity in primary rat CGNs. These small molecule Bcl-2 inhibitors bind in a hydrophobic surface groove of Bcl-2 (the BH3 groove), thereby mimicking the BH3-dependent interaction of pro-apoptotic family members with Bcl-2 (24Wang J.L. Liu D. Zhang Z.J. Shan S. Han X. Srinivasula S.M. Croce C.M. Alnemri E.S. Huang Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7124-7129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar, 25Enyedy I.J. Ling Y. Nacro K. Tomita Y. Wu X. Cao Y. Guo R. Li B. Zhu X. Huang Y. Long Y.Q. Roller P.P. Yang D. Wang S. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 4313-4324Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Incubation of CGNs with either Bcl-2 inhibitor for 24 h induced cell death, which was effectively blocked by co-incubation with a cell-permeable, monoethyl ester of GSH (Fig. 1B). Consistent with an apoptotic mode of death, HA14-1 induced activation of the executioner caspase 3 (Fig. 1C) and caused disruption of the microtubule network (Fig. 1D), effects that were both prevented by GSH. Thus, inhibition of endogenous Bcl-2 function by BH3 mimetics induces GSH-sensitive apoptosis in CGNs. Next, we examined whether BH3 mimetics caused mitochondrial oxidative stress by analyzing the production of superoxide with the fluorescent dye MitoSOX. MitoSOX localizes to mitochondria and is essentially nonfluorescent in its reduced form, whereas it produces a red fluorescent emission upon its specific oxidation by superoxide. Once oxidized, MitoSOX binds tightly to DNA, further enhancing its fluorescence. In healthy CGNs, minimal MitoSOX fluorescence was detected, consistent with the basal production of superoxide at mitochondria (Fig. 1E, upper right panel). After incubation with HA14-1 for 2 h, MitoSOX fluorescence markedly increased and appeared nuclear, consistent with binding of the oxidized probe to DNA (Fig. 1E, lower right panel). The increase in superoxide production induced by the BH3 mimetic preceded any morphological evidence of neurotoxicity detected under brightfield (Fig. 1E, left panels). As an independent measure of mitochondrial oxidative stress, we examined CGN lysates for oxidized (carbonylated) proteins using a DNPH assay. Previous studies have shown that mitochondrial proteins, such as ANT or aconitase, are particularly sensitive to oxidative damage (26Yan L.J. Sohal R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12896-12901Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Utilizing this technique, we consistently observed DNP derivatization of a 33-kDa protein only in lysates obtained from BH3 mimetic-treated CGNs (Fig. 1F, top blot). Upon stripping and reprobing, ANT was detected at 33 kDa in the control lysate but not in lysates from BH3 mimetic-treated CGNs (Fig. 1F, middle blot). The apparent loss of ANT im"

The structure of Escherichia coli NhaA was recently determined, but its mechanisms of transport and pH regulation remain elusive. We performed molecular dynamics simulations of NhaA that, with existing experimental data, enabled us to propose an atomically detailed model of antiporter function. Three conserved aspartates are key to our proposed mechanism: Asp 164 (D164) is the Na + -binding site, D163 controls the alternating accessibility of this binding site to the cytoplasm or periplasm, and D133 is crucial for pH regulation. Consistent with experimental stoichiometry, two protons are required to transport a single Na + ion: D163 protonates to reveal the Na + -binding site to the periplasm, and subsequent protonation of D164 releases Na + . Additional mutagenesis experiments further validated the model."
https://openalex.org/W2071245324,"Attoscience is the study of physical processes that occur in less than a fraction of a cycle of visible light, in times less than a quadrillionth of a second. The motion of electrons inside atoms and molecules that are undergoing photoionization or chemical change falls within this time scale, as does the plasma motion that causes the reflectivity of metals. The techniques to study motion on this scale are based on careful control of strong-field laser-atom interactions. These techniques and new research opportunities in attosecond spectroscopy are reviewed."
https://openalex.org/W1966440284,"Momentary awareness of a visual scene is very limited; however, this limitation has not been formally characterized. We test the hypothesis that awareness reflects a surprisingly impoverished data structure called a labeled Boolean map, defined as a linkage of just one feature value per dimension (for example, the color is green and the motion is rightward) with a spatial pattern. Features compete with each other, whereas multiple locations form a spatial pattern and thus do not compete. Perception of the colors of two objects was significantly improved by successive compared with simultaneous presentation, whereas perception of their locations was not. Moreover, advance information about which objects are relevant aided perception of colors much more than perception of locations. Both results support the Boolean map hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W1981045115,"The yeast Mec1/Tel1 kinases, ATM/ATR in mammals, coordinate the DNA damage response by phosphorylating proteins involved in DNA repair and checkpoint pathways. Recently, ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, such as the INO80 complex, have also been implicated in DNA damage responses, although regulatory mechanisms that direct their function remain unknown. Here, we show that the Ies4 subunit of the INO80 complex is phosphorylated by the Mec1/Tel1 kinases during exposure to DNA-damaging agents. Mutation of Ies4's phosphorylation sites does not significantly affect DNA repair processes, but does influence DNA damage checkpoint responses. Additionally, ies4 phosphorylation mutants are linked to the function of checkpoint regulators, such as the replication checkpoint factors Tof1 and Rad53. These findings establish a chromatin remodeling complex as a functional component in the Mec1/Tel1 DNA damage signaling pathway that modulates checkpoint responses and suggest that posttranslational modification of chromatin remodeling complexes regulates their involvement in distinct processes."

Production of IP and PP-IP molecules occurs through several classes of evolutionarily conserved inositol phosphate kinases. Here we report the characterization of a human inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) and diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate (PP-IP5 or IP7) kinase with similarity to the yeast enzyme Vip1, a recently identified IP6/IP7 kinase (Mulugu, S., Bai, W., Fridy, P.

Recombinant human VIP1 exhibits in vitro IP6 and IP7 kinase activities and restores IP7 synthesis when expressed in mutant yeast. Expression of human VIP1 in HEK293T cells engineered to produce high levels of IP7 results in dramatic increases in bisdiphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate (PP2-IP4 or IP8).

Stimulation of cells results in the production of IPs through the cleavage of phosphoinositides by phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (1Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F.

Many additional IPs, such as inositol tetrakisphosphate (IP4), inositol pentakisphosphate (IP5), and inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6), are generated through the subsequent action of several classes of evolutionarily conserved inositol phosphate kinases (IPKs) (2Irvine R.F.

Soluble IP molecules also serve as precursors to several species of diphosphoinositol phosphates (PP-IPs), commonly referred to as inositol pyrophosphates. PP-IPs were first reported and characterized in Dictyostelium discoideum and mammalian cells and are distinguished by the presence of one or more pyrophosphate groups on the inositol ring (9Europe-Finner G.N.

An IP6 kinase (IP6K) class of enzymes, Kcs1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and IHPK1, IHPK2, and IHPK3 in mammals, was found to convert IP6 to diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate, also known as PP-IP5 or IP7 (12Saiardi A.

Loss of Kcs1 in budding yeast results in defects in the response to osmotic stress, regulation of telomere length, vacuolar biogenesis, endocytosis, and other cellular processes (13Saiardi A.

PP-IP5 has also been shown in vitro to act as a phosphate donor, capable of phosphorylating proteins directly, in a non-enzymatic process (19Saiardi A. Bhandari R. Resnick A.C. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Science. 2004; 306: 2101-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar); however, evidence that this occurs in cells awaits further study (20York J.D. Hunter T. Science. 2004; 306: 2053-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Recent work has also indicated that IP6K activity participates in the synthesis of bisdiphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate (PP2-IP4 or IP8), a more highly phosphorylated PP-IP species containing two pyrophosphate groups. Studies have demonstrated that PP2-IP4 levels change in response to osmotic and heat stress in both yeast and mammalian cells and may be regulated in part by the MAP kinase pathway (21Luo H.R.

This activity was identified as inositol pyrophosphate synthase IPS1 based on the accumulation of a novel PP-IP5 in yeast mutants lacking both Kcs1/IP6K activity and the diphosphoinositol phosphate phosphatase Ddp1 (kcs1Δddp1Δ) (16York S.J. Armbruster B.N. Greenwell P. Petes T.D. York J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4264-4269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Biochemical purification of the IP6 kinase activity from a kcs1Δddp1Δ double knock-out yeast strain led to the cloning of Vip1 (26Mulugu S. Bai W. Fridy P.C. Bastidas R.J. Otto J.C. Dollins D.E. Haystead T.A. Ribeiro A.A. York J.D. Science. 2007; 316: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Prior to the discovery that Vip1 possessed intrinsic IP6 kinase activity, its Schizosaccharomyces pombe ortholog Asp1 was found to exhibit genetic interactions with actin-related proteins 2/3 (Arp2/3), indicating that it may function as a regulator of actin polymerization and cytoskeletal function (27Feoktistova A. McCollum D. Ohi R. Gould K.L. Genetics. 1999; 152: 895-908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mulugu et al. demonstrated that IP6 kinase activity was required for certain genetic interactions and proper cell morphology (26Mulugu S. Bai W. Fridy P.C. Bastidas R.J. Otto J.C. Dollins D.E. Haystead T.A. Ribeiro A.A. York J.D. Science. 2007; 316: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In addition, through phosphorus NMR analysis of the products of recombinant Vip1 and Kcs1/IP6K, it was shown that distinct PP-IP5 species are produced (26Mulugu S. Bai W. Fridy P.C. Bastidas R.J. Otto J.C. Dollins D.E. Haystead T.A. Ribeiro A.A. York J.D. Science. 2007; 316: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Given the unique activities of Vip1 and Kcs1/IP6K, it was shown that both enzymes also act as PP-IP5 kinases, and together, these enzymes are capable of phosphorylating IP6 to generate PP2-IP4 (26Mulugu S. Bai W. Fridy P.C. Bastidas R.J. Otto J.C. Dollins D.E. Haystead T.A. Ribeiro A.A. York J.D. Science. 2007; 316: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Here we report the identification, cloning, and characterization of two human VIP1-like gene products. Our data indicate that human VIP1 and VIP2 act as both IP6 and PP-IP5 kinases whose products have been implicated in a wide array of signal transduction pathways. Our work represents a significant advance for understanding the increasingly evident signaling roles of inositol pyrophosphates. Construction of Plasmids—The cDNA for human VIP1 (accession number BC057395) and human VIP2 (BC024591) were obtained from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). Constructs were prepared for bacterial expression of full-length human VIP1 (hsVIP1), hsVIP2, and the kinase domains of hsVIP1 between residues 1 and 387 (hsVIP1-KD) and hsVIP2 between residues 1 and 393 (hsVIP2-KD). For hsVIP1, these were constructed by installing SalI sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the coding regions via PCR and subcloning into pGEX-KG, whereas 5′-EcoRI and 3′-XhoI sites were used at the ends of hsVIP2 products. The 5′-sense primer for hsVIP1 and hsVIP1-KD was 5′-CG TCC AGT CGA CTC ATG TGG TCA TTG ACG GCC AGT GAG GGC-3′ (restriction sites are underlined). The 3′-antisense primer for hsVIP1 was 5′-GCT CCA GTC GAC CTA ATT TAT CTC CTC AGG GAC CTC CTG GGC-3′, and the 3′-antisense primer for hsVIP1-KD was 5′-GCT CCA GTC GAC CTA CAT AGT GCC AGA TGT GGT GGG AAC AAT GG-3′. The 5′-sense primer for hsVIP2 and hsVIP2-KD was 5′-C GGA ATT CAA ATG AGT GAA GCC CCC AGA TTC TTC GTT GGA CCA G-3′. The 3′-antisense primer for hsVIP2 was 5′-GGA CGC TCG AGG CTT CTG CTA AGA TTT CAT TTC TTT TTC CCA GTG-3′, and the 3′-antisense primer for hsVIP2-KD was 5′-GGA CGC TCG AGT CAT GTT CGA TCC CCA TGA CGT ATA ACA GC-3′. hsVIP1 yeast constructs were prepared in a similar fashion in the univector plasmid pUNI10 by installing 5′-NdeI and 3′-SalI sites at the ends of hsVIP1 and hsVIP1-KD. These sequences were then cloned into the pRS426-loxP-GFP-myc3-cup1 vector through loxP recombination, as described previously (28Liu Q. Li M.Z. Leibham D. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1300-1309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) fusion constructs were prepared in pCFP through installation of 5′-KpnI and 3′-NotI sites at the ends of hsVIP1 and hsVIP1-KD and 5′-EcoRI and 3′-XhoI sites at the ends of hsVIP2 and hsVIP2-KD. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing at the Duke University DNA Analysis Facility. Mammalian expression constructs for human GαqQL, human IP6K1, and human IPK1 are described elsewhere (29Otto, J. C., Kelly, P., Chiou, S. T., and York, J. D. (2007) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in pressGoogle Scholar). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Human VIP1 and VIP2—Constructs were transformed into BL21 DE3 Star competent Escherichia coli cells (Invitrogen), and protein was expressed by inducing at 18 °C with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 5 h. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 350 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysed by passing twice through a Microfluidics M110L homogenizer at ∼15,000 psi. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatant was applied to a column of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Sigma,) equilibrated in lysis buffer. After washing, protein was eluted in buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 350 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm glutathione. Eluted protein was stored at -80 °C. Assays of VIP1 IP6 and IP7 Kinase Activity—Enzyme assays were typically run in 10-μl reactions containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 6.2), 1 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, and ∼40,000 cpm of [d-2-32P]IP6 or [d-5-32P]P-IP5. For kinetic analyses, IP6 and IP7 concentrations ranged from ∼20 nm to 10 μm. Reactions were generally incubated 20–60 min at 37 °C and stopped by adding 1 μl of 2.5 n HCl and placing on ice. Reactions were spotted onto polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates in 2.5-μl increments, with samples dried in between spotting, and developed in a TLC tank equilibrated with a buffer consisting of 1.09 m KH2PO4, 0.72 m K2HPO4, and 2.13 m HCl. Plates were exposed to a phosphor storage screen, which was read on a 4500 SI Phosphor-Imager (Amersham Biosciences). [32P]IP6 was produced enzymatically in 50-μl reactions, with 1.7 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 6,000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 50 pmol of I(1,3,4,5,6)P5, and 1 μg of the IP5 2-kinase GST-atIPK1. This reaction was run in a buffer of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm KCl, and 3 mm MgCl2 and was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, with the enzyme subsequently heat-inactivated at 95 °C for 10 min (26Mulugu S. Bai W. Fridy P.C. Bastidas R.J. Otto J.C. Dollins D.E. Haystead T.A. Ribeiro A.A. York J.D. Science. 2007; 316: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). [d-5-32P]P-IP5 ([32P]IP7) was also produced enzymatically, in 50-μl reactions with 1.7 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP, 50 pmol of IP6, and 5 μg of GST-IHPK1, with 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and 2 mm MgCl2 by incubation at 37 °C for 2 h. [32P]IP7 product was then purified. Mass amounts of IP7 used in kinetics assays were produced enzymatically in 100-μl reactions with 20 μm IP6, 60,000 cpm of [32P]IP6 (tracer), 1 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 3 μg of GST-IHPK1, and 50 mm HEPES (pH 6.2) by incubation at 37 °C for 2 h. GST-IHPK1 was heat-inactivated at 95 °C. Analysis of products of the reaction indicated that ∼80% of the radiolabeled IP6 tracer was converted to IP7. The IP7 product was used unpurified at indicated concentrations. Yeast Steady-state Inositol Labeling for HPLC Analysis—All yeast strains used were kcs1Δ ddp1Δ vip1Δ mutants in a w303 background. Strains were transformed through a standard protocol with hsVIP1 constructs in a pRS426-myc3-GFP-cup1 vector. For in vivo labeling, yeast were grown in complete synthetic medium lacking appropriate nutrients and containing 100 μm CuSO4 and 20 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol (American Radiolabel Corp., St. Louis, MO). After incubating until saturation, soluble inositols were harvested as described previously (30York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R.

Soluble IPs were separated by HPLC on a Partisphere SAX column (4.6 × 125 mm; Whatman, Clifton, NJ) using the following buffer profile: 10 mm NH4H2PO4 (pH 3.5) for 5 min; a linear gradient of 10 mm NH4H2PO4 to 1.7 m NH4H2PO4 for 65 min; 1.7 m NH4H2PO4 for 40 min. Radiolabeled inositides eluting from the column were quantified using an inline radiation detector. Multitissue Northern Blotting—DNA template corresponding to the first 625 nucleotides of the 3′-untranslated region of human VIP1 mRNA was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-AAG TCC TGG GTG GTC CCT GAA G-3′ and 5′-CCC GGG ATG GCT ATC TGA AAT GTC TGG-3′. A random decamer primed 32P-labeled probe generated from this template was used to analyze a commercial human multitissue Northern blot (Clontech). The blot was hybridized using ExpressHyb solution (Clontech), washed under conditions described by the manufacturer, and exposed to film for 1 week at -70 °C. Mammalian Cell Culture—HEK293T cells were obtained from the Duke University Medical Center Cell Culture Facility and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Transfections were carried out using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Subcellular Localization of Human VIP1—HEK293T cells were transfected with pCFP-hsVIP1 constructs. 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell extracts were prepared by sonication, and soluble and membrane fractions were separated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g. Membrane fractions were resuspended in lysis buffer by Dounce homogenization, and the levels of hsVIP1 in the soluble and membrane fractions were compared by Western blotting using an antibody to CFP (Roche Applied Science). Fluorescence Microscopy and Western Blotting of CFP-tagged Human VIP1 and VIP2—For in vivo fluorescence microscopy, HEK293T cells were plated onto eight chamber slides at a cell density of 100,000 cells/ml and allowed to adhere overnight. The cells were transfected with CFP fusion constructs and incubated for 24 h. Cell imaging was then performed on a Nikon TE2000E inverted fluorescence microscope. Extracts were prepared by directly harvesting transfected cells with SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and CFP-hsVIP1 and CFP-hsVIP2 expression was analyzed by Western blotting extracts using an antibody to CFP. Metabolic Labeling of Mammalian Cells—HEK293T cells were seeded onto 12-well tissue culture plates at 100,000 cells/ml. After incubation overnight, cells were washed one time with inositol free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then labeled for 72 h with 37.5 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol in inositolfree Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected after 48 h of labeling, directly into the labeling medium. Cell extracts destined for direct HPLC analysis were prepared by aspirating the labeling medium, washing the cells with phosphate-buffered saline, and adding 0.4 ml of 0.5 n HCl. HCl was left on the cells for 5 min to extract the soluble inositides and was then removed from the cells and filtered through a 0.45-μm nylon filter to remove cell debris. Samples were prepared for HPLC analysis in the same manner as yeast extracts and run with an identical column and gradient. Evolutionary Conservation of VIP1 Genes—Bioinformatic analysis reported for yeast Vip1 demonstrated that this class of enzyme possesses a dual-domain structure that is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals (26Mulugu S. Bai W. Fridy P.C. Bastidas R.J. Otto J.C. Dollins D.E. Haystead T.A. Ribeiro A.A. York J.D. Science. 2007; 316: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal domain belongs to the RimK/ATP-grasp superfamily and encodes yeast Vip1's IP6 kinase activity (Fig. 1A). A second domain within VIP1-like proteins has similarity to the histidine acid-phosphatase family of enzymes, members of which include phytase proteins capable of hydrolyzing IP6 (32Van Etten R.L. Davidson R. Stevis P.E. MacArthur H. Moore D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2313-2319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Mullaney E.J. Ullah A.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 312: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). According to the conserved domain structure retrieval tool (CDART), there are 69 VIP1-like sequences spanning the entire Eukaryota taxonomy that have the RimK/acid-phosphatase dual-domain structure (as of June, 2007). Notably, there is strong conservation of VIP1's kinase domain among eukaryotic species, suggesting possible conservation of the corresponding inositol pyrophosphate synthase activities (Fig. 1B). A catalytic aspartic acid residue required for these kinase activities has also been identified and is extensively conserved among eukaryotes (Fig. 1, A and B). With respect to the acid-phosphatase domain, there is conservation of key histidine residues within the consensus active site motif; however, a notable mutation is present in all VIP1-like proteins at the aspartate residue adjacent to the second histidine (Fig. 1C). In addition to VIP1's conservation, sequence homology also revealed a closely related gene present in humans and mice, which we have termed VIP2 (Fig. 1, B and D). This gene has a similar dual-domain structure, with 86% sequence identity to mammalian VIP1 in the kinase domain. IP6 and IP7 Kinase Activities of Recombinant Human VIP1 and VIP2—A full-length hsVIP1 complementary DNA (residues 1–1433) was obtained (GenBank™ accession number, AAH57395), subcloned, and expressed in bacteria as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. A construct spanning residues 1–387 encoding hsVIP1's kinase domain (hsVIP1-KD) was also expressed and purified. Recombinant hsVIP1 and hsVIP1-KD fusion proteins were tested for IP6 and IP7 kinase activities using in vitro assays with the appropriate inositol phosphate substrate (Fig. 2A). These studies demonstrated that full-length hsVIP1, as well as the kinase domain alone, exhibit robust dose-dependent IP6 kinase activity capable of producing IP7 (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, both the full-length enzyme and the kinase domain are capable of phosphorylating 5-PP-IP5, an IP7 product of human IHPK1/IP6K, to PP2-IP4 (IP8) (Fig. 2B). Of interest, the human full-length protein exhibited significantly less specific activity than the kinase domain alone (Fig. 2, A and B), a property also shared by recombinant yeast Vip1 (not shown). To examine the relative rates of IP6 and IP7 kinase activities, the kinetic parameters of recombinant hsVIP1 were also determined (Fig. 2, C and D, and Table 1). With the kinase domain, a Km of 122 and 120 nm was found for IP6 and IP7 substrates, respectively. Corresponding Vmax values were 0.42 and 1.04 nmol/min/mg, respectively. Similar Km values were obtained for the full-length enzyme, although the turnover number (kcat) for each substrate was 3–5-fold lower (Table 1). This difference in activity may be a result of less efficient protein folding of the much larger full-length protein in bacteria but could also be associated with a regulatory property of the putative acid phosphatase domain. Although these Km and Vmax values are ∼200-fold lower than those reported for yeast Vip1, the catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) of the enzymes remain within 1 order of magnitude (Table 1) (26Mulugu S. Bai W. Fridy P.C. Bastidas R.J. Otto J.C. Dollins D.E. Haystead T.A. Ribeiro A.A. York J.D.

These enzymes both exhibited robust IP6 and IP7 activities, with catalytic efficiencies for the two substrates 5–30-fold higher than those of hsVIP1. Although VIP2's increased in vitro activity may have physiological relevance, it should be noted that differences in the recombinant proteins' expression and stability in bacteria could account for small differences observed for recombinant proteins. In Vivo IP6 Kinase Activity of hsVIP1 Expressed in Yeast—To determine whether the IP6 and IP7 kinase activities associated with human VIP1 are retained in a cellular environment, hsVIP1's kinase activities were also observed through in vivo studies. Yeast mutants overexpressing hsVIP1 were radiolabeled with tritiated myo-inositol, and extracts were analyzed through HPLC. These studies were done in a kcs1Δ ddp1Δ vip1Δ triple mutant, which lacks IP6 kinase and diphosphoinositol phosphate phosphatase activities but possesses a high intracellular concentration of IP6 (26Mulugu S.

Although no IP7 was observed in this mutant transformed with vector alone (Fig. 3A, top trace), when either full-length or kinase domain hsVIP1 constructs were overexpressed, a significant peak of IP7 was detected (Fig. 3A, middle and lower traces).

Here we demonstrate in the same system that GSH depletion down-regulates TNF-induced NF-κB transactivation via two mechanisms, depending on the extent of the depletion. With moderate GSH depletion (∼50%), the down-regulation is IκB kinase (IKK)-independent and likely acts on NF-κB transcriptional activity because TNF-induced IKK activation, IκBα phosphorylation and degradation, NF-κB nuclear translocation, NF-κB DNA binding in vitro, and NF-κB subunit RelA(p65) recruitment to κB sites of target gene promoters all appear unaltered. On the other hand, with profound GSH depletion (∼80%), the down-regulation also is IKK-dependent, and a timeline is established linking the inhibition of polyubiquitination of receptor-interacting protein 1 in TNF receptor 1 complex to partial blockage of IKK activation, IκBα phosphorylation and degradation, and NF-κB nuclear translocation. Of note, pretreatment with antioxidant trolox protects against the inhibitory effect of profound GSH depletion on IKK activation and NF-κB nuclear translocation but fails to restore expression of NF-κB target genes, revealing both IKK-dependent and -independent inhibition.

Scheurich P. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). The signaling from TNFα to NF-κB activation, mediated mainly through TNFR1, has been most extensively studied (5Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P.

Released NF-κB then enters the nucleus where with further modifications (phosphorylation, acetylation, etc.) it binds to specific promoter sequences termed κB sites and turns on the transcription of target genes (9Hayden M.S.

It is reasonable to speculate that in the context of specific liver injury models or disease conditions, hepatocytes become unable to respond normally to the diverse effects of TNFα and thereby become sensitized to TNF-induced death. GSH, a cysteine containing tripeptide, as the single most abundant antioxidant for detoxifying enzymes and a determinant of the thiol-disulfide state, is crucial to hepatocyte function (19Han D. Hanawa N. Saberi B. Kaplowitz N. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2006; 291: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Previous work in our laboratory demonstrated that GSH depletion by DEM (0.25–0.5 mm) inhibited TNF-induced expression of NF-κB-responsive survival genes and sensitized primary cultured mouse hepatocytes to TNF-induced apoptosis (20Nagai H. Matsumaru K. Feng G. Kaplowitz N. Hepatology. 2002; 36: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 21Matsumaru K. Ji C. Kaplowitz N. Hepatology. 2003; 37: 1425-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The present studies were designed to delineate the inhibitory effect of GSH depletion on signaling events leading to inhibition of TNF-induced NF-κB transactivation. By reporter gene assay we verified that GSH depletion by DEM down-regulates TNF-induced NF-κB activity. By Western blotting and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) we confirmed that GSH depletion by DEM at low concentrations (≤0.2 mm) did not inhibit NF-κB nuclear accumulation and DNA binding activity but did so partially at a higher concentration (0.5 mm). Therefore, we hypothesized that IKK-independent and -dependent mechanisms are involved and set out to prove this by evaluating DEM effect on major signaling events leading to IKK-dependent NF-κB activation and relating them with the timing and degree of GSH depletion. Furthermore, the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was assessed indirectly by evaluating the possible protective effect of antioxidant pretreatment. Finally, nuclear p65 was analyzed for phosphorylation, acetylation, and recruitment to κB sites of NF-κB-target gene promoters as an initial step to define the IKK-independent mechanism. Cell Culture, Treatments, Preparation of Protein Extracts, and Cellular Glutathione Determination—Primary cultured mouse hepatocytes (PMH) were used in all experiments. Hepatocytes were isolated from male C57BL/6 mice 7–9 week of age and plated at 1.2 × 106 cell/60-mm dish as described previously (22Feng G. Kaplowitz N. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2002; 282: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Three hours after plating, hepatocytes were washed and rested in phenol red-free and serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (3-ml/dish) overnight (∼15 h). The incubation and following treatments were carried out in a 37 °C cell culture incubator with 5% CO2. For drug cotreatments, working stock was added to the culture just before TNFα addition except when specified otherwise. After the indicated time periods, cells were washed with ice-cold Dulbecco's PBS followed by further processing. The resulting preparations were stored in aliquots at -80 °C. For whole cell extracts, cells were lysed in APB buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1.3 mm p-nitrophenol phosphate, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) supplemented with 1% Triton-100, 2 mm DTT, and 300 mm NaCl. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (23Alkalay I. Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Jung S. Avraham A. Gerlitz O. Pashut-Lavon I. Ben-Neriah Y. Mol. Cell.

Recombinant mouse TNFα (20 ng/ml; EMD Biosciences) was used in the set of experiments shown in Figs. 1, A and B, 2, and 3, A–C. To study TNFR1-mediated signaling (24Tartaglia L.A. Weber R.F.

For stock solutions, aliquots of DEM (0.5 m in Me2SO; Sigma), trolox (0.5 m in ethanol; EMD Biosciences), buthionine sulfoximine (BSO, 0.1 m in H2O, filtered; Sigma), and actinomycin D (ActD, 0.4 mg/ml in ethanol; Sigma) were stored at -20 °C as recommended by the manufacturer's. To determine the cellular glutathione (GSH + 2GSSG) content, cell extracts were prepared with 5% trichloroacetic acid and subjected to the GSH recycling assay (25Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5547) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Effect of GSH depletion by DEM on TNF-induced NF-κB DNA binding activity or NF-κB nuclear accumulation.

Plasmids pTBP-Luc and c-Fos-Luc were kind gifts from Dr. D. L. Johnson (University of Southern California). Luciferase reporter plasmids were introduced into PMH by transient transfection using Targefect F-1 (Targeting system) as described previously (26Hatano E. Brenner D.A. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2001; 281: 1357-1368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid (pRL-TK; Promega) was included in all transfection experiments as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Six hours post-transfection PMH were treated with TNFα and/or DEM as indicated for 4 h, lysed, and assayed for luciferase activities using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). EMSA—The experiments were performed as described previously (27Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar). NF-κB consensus oligonucleotides (κB; Promega) were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega), purified by 8% PAGE, and used as a probe. Nuclear extracts (2 μg) were incubated with the labeled probe (40,000 cpm/10 fmol) at 30 °C for 20 min in a binding reaction (10 μl) containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 40 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 1 μg poly(dI-dC), and 5 μg of bovine serum albumin. The protein-DNA complexes were fractionated on a native 4% PAGE with recirculation of TAE buffer (6.7 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 3.3.mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA). Labeled Oct-1 oligo (Promega) was used for loading control in parallel experiments. For competition or super shift experiments, nuclear extracts were incubated with unlabeled oligonucleotides (κB or AP-1; Promega) or antibodies as specified at 4 °C for 1 h before the addition of the labeled probe. Antibodies against RelA(p65) (100-4165; Rockland) and p50 (sc114; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used in a supershift assay. Western Blotting (WB)—Whole cell extracts (50 μg) or nuclear extracts (25 μg) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The antibodies used for probing are specific for IκBα, p50, IKKα, and HDAC3 (sc371, sc114, sc7190, and sc17795; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), for RelA(p65) (100–4165; Rockland), for phospho-IκBα (Ser-32/-36), phospho-p65 (Ser-276), phospho-p65 (Ser-468), phospho-p65 (Ser-536), phospho-IKKα/β (Ser-176/180), phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (Thr-180/Tyr-182), phospho-stress-activated protein kinase/JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185), phospho-c-Jun (Ser-63), IKKβ, FLIP, caspase-3, and histone H3 (9246, 3037, 3039, 3033, 2694, 9211, 9251, 9261, 2684, 3210, 9665, and 9715; Cell Signaling Technology). Antibodies specific for β-actin (A5441), manganese superoxide dismutase (06-984), acetyl-p65 (Lys-310, ab19870), and caspase 8 (AF1850) were from Sigma, Upstate, Abcam. and R&D Systems, respectively. The immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence detection systems (Pierce), with West Pico chemiluminescent substrate routinely used, and an enhanced chemiluminescent substrate, West Femto, was added (1:10 dilution in West Pico) to increase the sensitivity of detection for low abundance proteins. The probed membranes were restored after treatment with stripping buffer (Pierce) and reprobed with different antibodies sequentially. For protein semi-quantification, the related WB images were first scanned and then analyzed by ImageQuant software. Preparation of IKK Complex and Kinase Assay—Whole cell extracts (250 μg) were precleared by normal rabbit IgG plus protein A-agarose followed by immunoprecipitation (IP) with IKKα antibody (5 μl, sc7190; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein A-agarose (20 μl). Precipitates of IKK complex were washed three times in APB buffer supplemented with 0.25% Triton X-100, 2 mm DTT, and 150 mm NaCl and once in kinase buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. IKK activities of the precipitates were determined in an in vitro kinase assay (28DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar) in the kinase buffer (20 μl) supplemented with 1 μg of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-IκBα and 0.3 mm ATP. After 30 min incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped and analyzed by WB for the extent of phosphorylation of IκBα with an antibody specific for phospho-IκBα (Ser-32/-36) (#9246; Cell Signaling Technology). To determine whether DEM is a direct inhibitor of IKK activity, DEM (0.5 mm) was added to the washed immunoprecipitates in kinase buffer (10 μl) in the absence of DTT. After 10 min of incubation at 30 °C, the precipitates were diluted with kinase assay (KA) mixture (30 μl), and kinase activities were determined. GST-IκBα was prepared from an Escherichia coli strain (JM109) containing plasmid pGST-IκBα using glutathione-Sepharose 4B. This plasmid encodes an amino-terminal GST tagged IκBα (amino acids 13–54) of mouse origin (GenBank™ accession number C046754). Preparation of TNFR1 Signaling Complex—Experiments were performed as described (11Micheau O. Tschopp J. Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar) with some modification mainly due to the relative large size and small surface area of PMH. In brief, 5 × 106 PMH were left alone or stimulated with FLAG-tagged human TNFα (0.4 μg/ml; Apotech) in the presence or absence of DEM (0.5 mm) for indicated times. In these experiments DEM was added 2 min before TNFα addition to ensure a starting point of 50% GSH depletion in all TNFα/DEM cotreatments. PMH were then washed and lysed in APB buffer (1 ml) supplemented with 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 1 mm DTT. Whole cell extracts (12 mg) were precleared and subjected to IP overnight with monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (2 μg, F3165; Sigma) and protein G-Sepharose (30 μl; GE Healthcare). Precipitates of TNFR1 signaling complex were washed and then boiled in 2× sample buffer (pH 8.0, 30 μl) before processing for WB with antibodies specific for TNFR1 (AF-425-PB; R&D Systems), RIP1 (610459; BD Biosciences), TRADD, or TRAF2 (sc7868 and sc876; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Isolation and Quantitative Analysis of RNA Transcripts— Total RNA was extracted following a previously described protocol (29Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar) from PMH either left untreated or treated with TNFα plus or minus DEM. Two microgram of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using an Omniscript reverse transcription kit (Qiagen) supplemented with 10 μm random primer (Applied Biosystems). The resulting cDNA (equivalent to 6 ng of total RNA) was subjected to quantitative real-time PCR analysis with Taq-Man Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and ABI Prism 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Primer pairs and TaqMan probes (Biosearch Technologies, Inc.) used in quantification of gene expressions are summarized in Table 1 except of the set for IκBα, which was reported previously (30Anest V. Hanson J.L. Cogswell P.C. Steinbrecher K.A. Strahl B.D. Baldwin A.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 659-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Each set of these oligonucleotides was designed to encompass an exon-exon junction so that genomic DNA would not be amplified or detected. We used the standard curve method provided by the system software (SDS2.1) for the relative quantification following the manufacturer's instruction (Applied Biosystems). The standard used in construction of relative standard curves was composed of two cDNA stocks (50% of each) derived from total RNAs of PMH stimulated with TNFα for 30 and 180 min, respectively; as in our preliminary experiments, this mixture showed high level of the transcripts for the genes listed in Table 1. All data were normalized by 18S ribosomal RNA, and the ratios were shown directly to reflect relative abundances of the mRNA examined under different experimental conditions (see Figs. 1D and 9C) or were expressed as percentages of the relevant maximal level induced by TNFα (set as 100, see Figs. 5D and 8B).TABLE 1Sets of primer pairs and TaqMan probe for quantification of transcript levels of NF-κB-responsive genes by quantitative real-time PCR FAM, 6-carboxyfluorescein; BHQ, black hole quencher 1.TranscriptForward (F) and reverse (R) primers and TaqMan probe (T)A20F 5′-GAACCAGAGATTCCATGAAGCAA-3′R 5′-CCTGTGTAGTTCGAGGCATGTC-3′T 5′-FAM-AAGAACGGAAGAACAGCTGAGATCAAGCCA-BHQ-3′cIAP1F 5′-TTGAGCAGCTGTTGTCCACTTC-3′R 5′-GGCCAAAATGCACCACTGT-3′T 5′-FAM-CCCAGGAGAAGAAAATGCTGACCCTACAGA-BHQ-3′iNOSF 5′-CCAGCTCAAGAGCCAGAAAC-3′R 5′-CCATTATCTTTACTCAGTGCCAGAAG-3′T 5′-FAM-TGGAGGAGCCCAAAGCCACGA-BHQ-3′c-FLIPLF 5-TCAAGTATAACTCAAGGCTCCAGAAT-3′R 5′-ACGGATGTGCGGAGGTAAAA-3′T 5′-FAM-TAAAGAGCCAAGATTTGTGGAATACCGTGA-BHQ-3′ Open table in a new tab FIGURE 5Protective effect of antioxidant trolox on GSH depletion-triggered suppression of IKK-NF-κB activation.

TNF treatment was performed in a 37 °C water bath for only 5 and 10 min in the presence or absence of DEM (0.5 mm). IKK-KA was then performed as described in Fig. 4A (top panel) with IKKα in precipitates shown for equal loading. Rel. activity, IKK activities were normalized by corresponding IKKα levels then expressed as percentages relative to the relevant maximal activity induced by TNFα.

D, PMH were treated with or without trolox as described in A before 1 and 4 h of TNFα stimulation in the presence and absence of DEM (0.5 mm), and total RNAs were prepared. The mRNA levels for A20 at 1 h and iNOS at 4 h were determined by quantitative real-time PCR as described in the Fig. 1D legend and expressed as percentages of the maximal level induced by TNFα alone.

Embryoid bodies (EBs) derived from mouse embryonic stem cells deficient in the laminin γ1 chain are incapable of depositing a BM, resulting in failure of primitive ectoderm epithelialization. To elucidate the mechanisms involved in this phenomenon, we compared the gene expression profiles of EBs with or without a BM to identify the genes showing BM-dependent expression. We found that the expressions of marker genes for the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), including the transcription factor Snai2, were up-regulated in LAMC1-/- EBs, whereas restoration of a BM to LAMC1-/- EBs suppressed the up-regulation of these genes. Overexpression of Snai2 induced the EMT in control EBs by molecular and morphological criteria, suggesting that suppression of the EMT regulatory genes is involved in BM-dependent epithelialization of primitive ectoderm. Despite the failure of primitive ectoderm epithelialization in BM-deficient EBs, mesodermal differentiation was not compromised, but rather accelerated. Furthermore, at later stages of control EB differentiation, the BM was disrupted at the gastrulation site where mesodermal markers were strongly expressed only in cells that had lost contact with the BM. Taken together, these results indicate that the BM prevents the EMT and precocious differentiation of primitive ectoderm toward mesoderm in EBs, implying that BMs are important for the control of mammalian gastrulation.

The differentiation and fate of many cell types are controlled by interactions with their surrounding microenvironment, of which extracellular matrix (ECM) 3The abbreviations used are:ECMextracellular matrix4-OHT4-hydroxytamoxifenBMbasement membraneEBembryoid bodyEMTepithelial-mesenchymal transitionESembryonic stemICMinner cell massPBSphosphate-buffered salineSMAsmooth muscle actinRTreverse transcriptionTUNELterminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelingEembryonic day.3The abbreviations used are:ECMextracellular matrix4-OHT4-hydroxytamoxifenBMbasement membraneEBembryoid bodyEMTepithelial-mesenchymal transitionESembryonic stemICMinner cell massPBSphosphate-buffered salineSMAsmooth muscle actinRTreverse transcriptionTUNELterminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelingEembryonic day. is one of the main components (1Bissell M.J. Labarge M.A. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 17-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Basement membranes (BMs) are thin sheets of ECM that directly interact with many cell types, including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, muscle cells, fat cells, and glial cells (2Hay E.D. Hay E.D. Cell Biology of Extracellular Matrix. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1991: 1-6Crossref Google Scholar). Recently, targeted disruptions of BM components have revealed important roles for BMs in cell differentiation and fate determination (3Gustafsson E. Fassler R. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 52-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For example, disruption of the mouse laminin α5 chain, which is normally expressed in many fetal and adult tissues, leads to defects in BM integrity that result in defective morphogenesis of renal glomeruli, hair follicles, and teeth (4Miner J.H. Cunningham J. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1713-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 5Miner J.H. Li C. Dev.

Chem. 2006; 281: 5008-5016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Furthermore, deficiency of both nidogen-1 and nidogen-2 in mice also causes structural abnormalities in BMs, leading to differentiation defects in the lungs with extensive retention of mesenchyme (8Bader B.L. Smyth N. Nedbal S. Miosge N. Baranowsky A. Mokkapati S. Murshed M. Nischt R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6846-6856Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which BMs control morphogenesis and cell fate during development still remain largely unknown. extracellular matrix 4-hydroxytamoxifen basement membrane embryoid body epithelial-mesenchymal transition embryonic stem inner cell mass phosphate-buffered saline smooth muscle actin reverse transcription terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling embryonic day. extracellular matrix 4-hydroxytamoxifen basement membrane embryoid body epithelial-mesenchymal transition embryonic stem inner cell mass phosphate-buffered saline smooth muscle actin reverse transcription terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling embryonic day. During the early stages of mammalian development, embryonic cells must be allocated to one of the three germ layers, i.e. ectoderm, mesoderm, or endoderm. This process begins in the peri-implantation blastocyst when cells at the periphery of the inner cell mass (ICM) differentiate to form an extraembryonic primitive endoderm and deposit a BM that separates them from the remaining cells of the ICM, from which the germ layers are subsequently derived (9Nadijcka M. Hillman N. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1974; 32: 675-695PubMed Google Scholar, 10Smyth N. Vatansever H.S. Murray P. Meyer M. Frie C. Paulsson M. Edgar D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Undifferentiated ICM cells in contact with this BM become polarized and differentiate to form the primitive ectoderm epithelium. Moreover, studies using embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived embryoid bodies (EBs) have provided evidence that any unpolarized cells failing to contact the BM undergo apoptosis, leading to similar cavitation to that seen during proamniotic cavity formation (11Coucouvanis E. Martin G.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 279-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 12Murray P. Edgar D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1215-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 13Li S. Harrison D. Carbonetto S. Fassler R. Smyth N. Edgar D. Yurchenco P.D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The subsequent developmental stage of gastrulation leading to mesoderm and embryonic endoderm formation involves an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), in which cells of the columnar primitive ectoderm epithelium delaminate and migrate into the space between the primitive ectoderm and extraembryonic endoderm (14Viebahn C. Acta Anat. (Basel). 1995; 154: 79-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). During gastrulation, the BM deposited by the primitive endoderm becomes discontinuous, probably permitting the establishment of mesodermal and embryonic endodermal layers that are spatially distinct from the remaining primitive ectoderm (14Viebahn C. Acta Anat. (Basel). 1995; 154: 79-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 15Viebahn C. Mayer B. Miething A. Acta Anat. (Basel). 1995; 154: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar; see also supplemental Fig. S1). Thus, BM formation and integrity are dynamically regulated during germ-layer specification, although little is known about the functional relationships between the dynamic behavior of BMs and the cell differentiation and fate determination during germ-layer specification. To investigate the roles of BMs during early embryonic development, ES cells and mice with a disrupted LAMC1 gene have been established (10Smyth N. Vatansever H.S. Murray P. Meyer M. Frie C. Paulsson M. Edgar D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In the absence of the laminin γ1 subunit encoded by this gene, a functional laminin trimer comprising α, β, and γ chains cannot be assembled, resulting in the absence of BMs during peri-implantation development and in EBs derived from LAMC1-/- ES cells (10Smyth N. Vatansever H.S. Murray P. Meyer M. Frie C. Paulsson M. Edgar D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Mice heterozygous for the mutation show a normal phenotype and are fertile, whereas homozygous mutant embryos die at E5.5, mostly due to disorganization of the parietal yolk sac (10Smyth N. Vatansever H.S. Murray P. Meyer M. Frie C. Paulsson M. Edgar D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Because LAMC1-/- mutant embryos die at E5.5, it has been difficult to analyze the roles of BMs in cell differentiation and fate determination during germ-layer specification in vivo. However, studies on EBs derived from LAMC1-/- ES cells have revealed that differentiation of a columnar primitive ectoderm epithelium and cavitation are dependent on BM formation (12Murray P. Edgar D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1215-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 13Li S. Harrison D. Carbonetto S. Fassler R. Smyth N. Edgar D. Yurchenco P.D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Because the differentiation of a primitive ectoderm is dependent on BM formation, differentiating LAMC1-/- EBs provides a suitable experimental model for analyzing the consequences of the absence of a BM and addressing the mechanisms of BM-dependent cell fate determination during germ-layer specification. In the present study, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of EBs developing with and without a BM and extended the previous observations to later stages of EB development, including the generation of mesodermal cells. Our results show that absence or disruption of the BM during EB differentiation promotes the differentiation of mesodermal cells and that BM disruption is associated with a localized EMT. These observations suggest that cell-BM interactions are responsible for normal regulation of the EMT and therefore play fundamental roles in mammalian gastrulation. ES Cell and EB Cultures—The production and cultivation of R1 mouse LAMC1+/- and LAMC1-/- ES cells (10Smyth N. Vatansever H.S. Murray P. Meyer M. Frie C. Paulsson M. Edgar D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) as well as EB formation by the ES cells (12Murray P. Edgar D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1215-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) were described in detail in the cited reports. Briefly, for EB formation, ES cells were dissociated with 0.25% trypsin/0.5 mm EDTA (Invitrogen) and plated on gelatin-coated dishes for 1-1.5 h to eliminate feeder cells that preferentially attached to the substrate. Floating ES cells were collected, plated at 2 × 105 cells/ml in 0.05% Pluronic (Sigma)-coated 60-mm bacterial Petri dishes without leukemia inhibitory factor and fed with fresh culture medium every 2 days. On day 8 of the culture period, 83.2 ± 7.3% of the LAMC1+/- EBs formed a columnar primitive ectoderm, compared with only 10.7 ± 1.1% of the LAMC1-/- EBs. For BM-rescue experiments, LAMC1-/- EBs were plated in medium containing 35 μg/ml of purified mouse laminin-111 (Sigma). The efficiency of primitive ectoderm formation in BM-rescue experiments was low (only 20-30% of the total EBs), compared with control LAMC1+/- EBs. Because most of the EBs without a cavity failed to organize BMs, we removed EBs without a cavity under a microscope to roughly normalize the efficiencies of primitive ectoderm formation between control and BM-rescued EBs. On day 8 of the culture period, 59.8 ± 10.8% of the BM-rescued LAMC1-/- EBs formed a columnar primitive ectoderm. Antibodies and Immunofluorescence—The antibodies used in this study were: rabbit anti-mouse type IV collagen (LSL, Tokyo, Japan); rat anti-mouse laminin γ1 chain (MAB1914, Chemicon, Temecula, CA); mouse anti-α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) (ASM-1, Progen, Heidelberg, Germany); goat anti-human fibronectin (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA); goat anti-human brachyury (sc-17743, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); rabbit anti-human cleaved caspase-3 (5A1, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA); and mouse anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma). For immunofluorescence staining, EBs were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min, washed in PBS, soaked in 15% sucrose in PBS for 1 h, embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound, and frozen in an aluminum rack floating on liquid nitrogen. Frozen sections (8 μm thick) of the EBs were blocked with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min, and then incubated with a primary antibody diluted in the blocking solution for 1.5 h at room temperature. Next, the sections were washed with PBS and incubated with an appropriate secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) or Alexa Fluor 546 (Molecular Probes) diluted in the blocking solution, together with Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes) to stain the nuclei or rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes) to stain F-actin, for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the sections were washed in PBS, mounted in a fluorescence mounting medium (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), and photographed using an LSM5 PASCAL confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). To quantify the frequency of BM formation, primitive ectoderm formation and apicolateral F-actin accumulation in EB development, we stained more than 33 frozen sections of EBs with an anti-mouse laminin γ1 chain antibody (MAB1914) and rhodamine-phalloidin in each of three separate experiments (>100 EBs in total) and counted the EBs that fulfilled the following criteria: 1) the anti-laminin γ1 chain antibody produced continuous thin sheet-like staining (BM formation); 2) primitive ectoderm cells showed a cuboidal epithelial morphology upon staining with rhodamine-phalloidin (primitive ectoderm formation); and 3) rhodamine-phalloidin staining showed F-actin accumulation at the apicolateral domain in primitive ectoderm cells (apicolateral F-actin accumulation). Representative positive staining patterns for these criteria are shown in Fig. 1 (A-L). Gene Expression Profiling—Total RNA was prepared from triplicate samples of LAMC1+/-, LAMC1-/-, and BM-rescued LAMC1-/- EBs at day 8 using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) combined with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen). Fluorescently labeled cRNAs were synthesized from the total RNAs and hybridized with Mouse Development Oligo Microarrays (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) as previously described (16Hayashi Y. Emoto T. Futaki S. Sekiguchi K. Matrix Biol. 2004; 23: 47-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Cy3-labeled cRNAs from LAMC1-/- EBs were hybridized together with Cy5-labeled cRNAs from LAMC1+/- EBs or Cy5-labeled cRNAs from BM-rescued LAMC1-/- EBs. All these hybridizations were carried out using three independent cRNA samples in triplicate experiments. The hybridized arrays were scanned using a Gene Pix 4000B (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Three unscaled independent raw data sets from the triplicate experiments were loaded onto Genespring 6.0 (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA) and normalized using the per-spot and per-chip intensity-dependent LOWESS method (17Yang Y.H. Dudoit S. Luu P. Lin D.M. Peng V. Ngai J. Speed T.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e15Crossref PubMed Scopus (2829) Google Scholar). The triplicate data sets that passed quality control were averaged, and then filtered using the Genespring Advanced Filtering Tool. Spots that ranked in the top 500 up-regulated or down-regulated genes were identified in LAMC1-/- EBs in comparison with LAMC1+/- EBs based on the -fold change values. The same analysis was performed against BM-rescued LAMC1-/- EBs. The genes ranking in the top 500 up-regulated gene groups in LAMC1-/- EBs in comparison with both LAMC1+/- EBs and BM-rescued LAMC1-/- EBs were identified using a Venn diagram analysis. The same analysis was performed for the down-regulated gene groups. Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted and reverse-transcribed with a SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) using random hexamer primers. The resulting cDNAs were used for PCR with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). PCR amplifications and data collection were performed using an ABI7000 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). All quantifications were normalized by the endogenous expression levels of Gapdh. The relative expression levels from triplicate experiments were averaged and expressed as the mean ± S.D. The sequences of the primers are available on request. Plasmid Construction—To construct Cre recombinase-dependent expression systems for Snai2 and Twist2, we employed the pCAG-CY vector, which contains a CAG expression unit (18Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4584) Google Scholar), a floxed puromycin-ECFP fusion protein cDNA with a stop cassette and a NotI cloning site fused to an IRES-EYFP cDNA. The entire coding regions of Snai2 and Twist2 were amplified by RT-PCR from total RNA extracted from LAMC1-/- EBs cultured for 10 days and subcloned into the NotI site of pCAG-CY. Both these transgenes were subsequently activated with EYFP after excision of the ECFP cassette by Cre recombinase. A FLAG tag sequence was fused in-frame to the 3′-ends of the Snai2 and Twist2 cDNAs. For 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT)-induced translocation of Cre recombinase to nuclei, a cDNA encoding Cre recombinase flanked by a mutated hormone-binding domain of estrogen receptor, designated MerCreMer, was excised from pCAGGS-MerCreMer (a kind gift from Dr. Mitsuhiro Endoh, Research Center for Allergy and Immunology, RIKEN, Japan) using EcoRI and subcloned into the XhoI site of pPyCAGIRESzeocinpA (19Niwa H. Burdon T. Chambers I. Smith A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2048-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar), yielding pPyCAGIRESzeocinpA-MerCreMer. 4-OHT-inducible Expression of Snai2 or Twist2 in ES Cells—The pCAG-CY vectors carrying Snai2 and Twist2 (pCAG-CY-Snai2 and pCAG-CY-Twist2, respectively) were introduced into LAMC1+/- ES cells by electroporation using a Mouse ES Cell Nucleofector Kit (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany). The electroporated ES cells were selected with 4 μg/ml puromycin, and resistant colonies were isolated and analyzed for their expression levels of ECFP under a fluorescence microscope. ES cell clones strongly expressing ECFP were further transfected with pPyCAGIRESzeocinpA-MerCreMer, followed by selection with 40 μg/ml Zeocin. Resistant colonies were isolated and grown in the presence or absence of 0.1 μm 4-OHT (Sigma) for 24 h and stained with an anti-FLAG antibody. ES cell clones expressing FLAG and EYFP in the presence of 4-OHT were selected. Gene Expression Profiling of EBs Derived from LAMC1-/- and LAMC1+/- ES Cells—EBs were produced in suspension cultures of ES cells in Petri dishes without leukemia inhibitory factor. Both LAMC1+/- and LAMC1-/- ES cells aggregated to form spheroids, i.e. EBs, after 1-2 days in suspension culture (Fig. 1, A and A′). At this stage, no BMs were detected in either type of EB (Fig. 1, E and E′). Shortly after the cell aggregation, the outer cells of the EBs differentiated into primitive endoderm cells, as noted by the appearance of epithelial cells at the periphery of the EBs (Fig. 1, B and B′) and expression of type IV collagen (Fig. 1, F and F′). Although LAMC1+/- EBs organized a BM containing laminin and type IV collagen between the inner cells and the peripheral primitive endoderm layer (Fig. 1F), no BM was detected in LAMC1-/- EBs (Fig. 1F′). Consistent with a previous report (12Murray P. Edgar D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1215-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), the inner cells in contact with the BM in LAMC1+/- EBs became polarized and differentiated to form a columnar primitive ectoderm epithelium, while the unpolarized inner cells failing to contact the BM underwent apoptosis, thereby producing a central cavity by days 6-8 (Fig. 1, C, D, G, and H). Concomitant with the primitive ectoderm differentiation and cavitation, F-actin accumulated at the apicolateral domain of the primitive ectoderm cells and was lost from regions of cell-BM contact in LAMC1+/- EBs (Fig. 1, K and L). These changes in the F-actin distribution are indicative of epithelial cell polarization. On the other hand, LAMC1-/- EBs failed to form a columnar primitive ectoderm or central cavity (Fig. 1D′). Furthermore, F-actin did not accumulate at the apicolateral domain, but was rather distributed uniformly around the unpolarized cells in LAMC1-/- EBs (Fig. 1, K′ and L′). To study the mechanisms underlying the BM-dependent primitive ectoderm differentiation, we compared the gene expression profiles of EBs at day 8 by cDNA microarray analysis. Because the differences in their gene expression profiles could partly result from clonal variations between the LAMC1-/- and LAMC1+/- ES cells, rather than the absence of a BM, we rescued the BM formation in LAMC1-/- EBs by supplementing the EB cultures with exogenous laminin-111 and compared the gene expression profile of BM-rescued LAMC1-/- EBs with that of nonrescued LAMC1-/- EBs. As shown previously (12Murray P. Edgar D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1215-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), LAMC1-/- EBs cultured with laminin-111 organized a BM, and produced a columnar primitive ectoderm and central cavity (Fig. 1, M-O). Furthermore, F-actin accumulated at the apicolateral domain of the primitive ectoderm in BM-rescued LAMC1-/- EBs (Fig. 1P), demonstrating that the actin cytoskeleton dynamics in primitive ectoderm formation are dominated by the BM. Thus, comparison of the gene expression profile of LAMC1-/- EBs with those of LAMC1+/- EBs and BM-rescued LAMC1-/- EBs allowed us to focus on the BM-responsive genes and eliminate false-positive genes reflecting clonal variation between LAMC1-/- and LAMC1+/- ES cells. Genes whose expression profiles changed in the absence of a BM were delineated as follows. We selected the top 500 genes that were either up-regulated (group a) or down-regulated (group b) in LAMC1-/- EBs compared with LAMC1+/- EBs (Fig. 1Q). Similarly, we selected the top 500 genes whose expression levels were higher (group c) or lower (group d) in LAMC1-/- EBs than in BM-rescued LAMC1-/- EBs (Fig. 1R). A Venn diagram was used to extract the genes included in groups a and c (Fig. 1S) or groups b and d (Fig. 1T). As a result, 180 genes were identified as being up-regulated in the absence of a BM (supplemental Table S1), while 94 genes were down-regulated in the absence of a BM (supplemental Table S2). Up-regulation of EMT-related Genes in LAMC1-/- EBs—Near the top of the list of genes up-regulated in the absence of a BM, we found a group of genes related to the EMT, including EMT inducers and markers (Table 1). For example, IGF-2 has been reported to induce the EMT in ES cells (20Morali O.G. Delmas V. Moore R. Jeanney C. Thiery J.P. Larue L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4942-4950Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), whereas cell adhesion-related genes, such as Vim (vimentin), Acta2 (α-SMA), and Fn1 (fibronectin), are well known as mesenchymal marker genes induced during the EMT (21Hay E.D. Acta Anat. (Basel). 1995; 154: 8-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). Quantitative RT-PCR analyses confirmed that Igf2 (IGF-2), Tgfb2 (TGFβ-2), Fn1, Vim, and Acta2 were more strongly expressed in LAMC1-/- EBs than in LAMC1+/- EBs at day 8, while the up-regulation of these genes was suppressed when the BM was rescued by exogenously added laminin-111 (Fig. 2, A-E). It should also be noted that up-regulation of these EMT-related genes was not evident at day 4, when a BM was detectable in LAMC1+/- EBs, but became pronounced at day 6 in LAMC1-/- EBs. This delayed up-regulation of the EMT-related genes, relative to the onset of BM deposition by the primitive endoderm, raised the possibility that the up-regulation of EMT-related genes in LAMC1-/- EBs was triggered by the absence of a BM.TABLE 1EMT-related genes up-regulated in the absence of a BMChange (S.D.)aValues are the means ± S.D.s of three independent experiments.LAMC1−/− vs. BM-rescued LAMC1−/−LAMC1−/− vs. LAMC1+/−-foldSignaling molecules Igf2 (insulin-like growth factor 2)2.8 (0.3)3.8 (0.8) Tgfb2 (transforming growth factor, β2)1.7 (0.4)1.3 (0.2) Wnt5a (wingless-related MMTV integration site 5A)1.6 (0.3)1.3 (0.1)Cell adhesion-related Myl4 (myosin, light polypeptide 4, alkali, atrial, embryonic)1.9 (0.4)2.9 (0.5) Fn1 (fibronectin 1)1.8 (0.2)1.5 (0.2) Vim (vimentin)1.8 (0.1)2.3 (0.5) Acta2 (actin, α2, smooth muscle, aorta)1.8 (0.3)2.1 (0.6) Cdh11 (cadherin 11)1.6 (0.1)1.6 (0.1)Transcription factors Ets2 (E26 avian leukemia oncogene 2, 3′ domain)1.7 (0.3)1.5 (0.2) Etv5 (Ets variant gene 5)1.6 (0.4)1.6 (0.3)a Values are the means ± S.D.s of three independent experiments. Open table in a new tab To verify the up-regulation of mesenchymal markers in LAMC1-/- EBs at the protein level, we stained LAMC1+/-, LAMC1-/-, and BM-rescued LAMC1-/- EBs with antibodies against α-SMA and fibronectin. α-SMA was strongly detected in the inner cells, i.e. the prospective primitive ectoderm, of LAMC1-/- EBs (Fig. 2G), but less so in LAMC1+/- and BM-rescued LAMC1-/- EBs (Fig. 2, F and H), clearly reflecting the remarkable changes in its mRNA level detected by quantitative RT-PCR. Fibronectin was also detected in LAMC1-/- EBs, with prominent deposition in the ECM between prospective primitive ectoderm cells (Fig. 2J), whereas the staining for fibronectin was less prominent and restricted to the BM in LAMC1+/- and BM-rescued LAMC1-/- EBs (Figs. 2, I and K). These results are consistent with those obtained in the cDNA microarray and quantitative RT-PCR analyses and indicate that the absence of a BM during EB differentiation induces up-regulation of mesenchymal markers in the prospective primitive ectoderm after the BM formation stage. Up-regulation of Snai2 and Twist2 in LAMC1-/- EBs—The expressions of mesenchymal genes, such as Acta2 and Fn1, during the EMT are known to be regulated by the Snail and Twist families of transcription factors (22Yang J. Mani S.A. Donaher J.L. Ramaswamy S. Itzykson R.A. Come C. Savagner P. Gitelman I. Richardson A. Weinberg R.A.

These transcription factors play central roles in the EMT as master regulators during embryonic development and cancer progression (22Yang J. Mani S.A. Donaher J.L. Ramaswamy S. Itzykson R.A. Come C.

Nieto M.A. Development. 2005; 132: 3151-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). To examine whether the absence of a BM induces these master regulators of the EMT, we investigated the expression levels of Snai1 (Snail1), Snai2 (Snail2/Slug), Snai3 (Snail3), Twist1 and Twist2 in LAMC1+/-, LAMC1-/-, and BM-rescued LAMC1-/- EBs by quantitative RT-PCR. Among the Snail family of transcription factors, the expression of Snai2 was greater in LAMC1-/- EBs than in LAMC1+/- and BM-rescued LAMC1-/- EBs (Fig. 3B). Twist2 was also significantly up-regulated in LAMC1-/- EBs (Fig. 3E). The differences in the expression levels of Snai1, Snai3, and Twist1 between EBs with and without a BM were only marginal (Fig. 3, A, C, and D). Elevated expression of Snai2 in LAMC1-/- EBs was also detected in microarray analyses, scoring 1.42- and 1.12-fold increases compared with BM-rescued LAMC1-/- EBs and LAMC1+/- EBs, respectively. Twist2 was not included in the repertoire of the microarray used. These observations indicate that the absence of a BM activates upstream EMT regulators in ES cells as EB differentiation proceeds. To explore whether the up-regulation of Snai2 or Twist2 was capable of inhibiting the columnar primitive ectoderm formation and inducing the mesenchymal phenotype in LAMC1-/- EBs, we overexpressed Snai2 or Twist2 in LAMC1+/- EBs and examined their effects on EB differentiation.

In this case, chemically cross-linked GPVI also contained FcRγ. In the course of studies on the association of GPIb-IX-V and GPVI (15Arthur J.F. Gardiner E.E. Matzaris M. Taylor S.G.

In this paper, we show that this band represented a ligand-induced disulfide-dependent GPVI homodimer. Mutation of Cys-338 within the GPVI cytoplasmic domain, but not the other available sufhydryl at Cys-274, prevented dimerization, demonstrating an unusual role for the penultimate residue, Cys-338. Together, these results provide unique evidence supporting the presence of constitutive GPVI homodimers on the platelet surface and demonstrate that GPVI agonists can induce transient disulfide-dependent dimerization of GPVI independent of platelet activation.

Avidin-HRP was from Sigma. Reagents—Purified convulxin from the venom of the South American rattlesnake Crotalus durissus terrificus was a kind gift from Dr. Kenneth Clemetson (Berne, Switzerland). The GPVI-specific agonist, CRP, with amino acid sequence GCO(GPO)10GCOG-NH2, where O represents hydroxyproline (Mimotopes, Clayton, Victoria, Australia), was cross-linked using the chemical cross-linker (3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide (Sigma) as described previously (37Morton L.F.

Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture tablets were obtained from Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany). Platelet Aggregation—Human platelets were isolated from venous blood using a 19-gauge winged infusion kit with acid citrate dextrose as the anticoagulant, and washed three times in CGS buffer (37.5 mm trisodium citrate, 5 mm glucose, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.0), as described previously (39Andrews R.K. Munday A.D. Mitchell C.A. Berndt M.C. Blood. 2001; 98: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Platelets were resuspended at 5 × 108 platelets/ml in Tyrode's buffer (0.36 mm NaH2PO4.H2O, 5.5 mm glucose, 138 mm NaCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.49 mm MgCl2. 6H2O, 2.6 mm KCl, pH 7.4). Platelet aggregation was induced by addition of convulxin (0.5 μg/ml, final concentration) with stirring at 900 rpm in a Lumiaggregometer (Chronolog, Havertown, PA) at 37 °C. Assays were terminated by the addition of one-quarter volume 4× nonreducing SDS sample-loading buffer. Analysis of Platelets Treated with GPVI Agonists—To examine the effect of GPVI ligands on platelet GPVI, aliquots (0.1 ml) of washed platelets were mixed with 0.1 ml of Tyrode's buffer containing (final concentration) convulxin (0.01–3 μg/ml), collagen (20 μg/ml), or the calmodulin inhibitor W7 (150 μm) and incubated at room temperature for the indicated times. Some platelet suspensions also contained wortmannin (0.1 μm), piceatannol (30 μg/ml), PP2 (10 μm), or the metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001 (0.1 mm) added 10 min before the addition of agonist. Incubations were halted by adding 10 mm EDTA (final concentration), and platelets were pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 2 min. The supernatant was mixed with one-quarter volume 4× nonreducing SDS sample-loading buffer. Platelet pellets were lysed with 0.25 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EGTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100) plus Complete proteinase inhibitor on ice for 30 min. Lysates were mixed with one-quarter volume 4× nonreducing SDS sample-loading buffer, resolved on SDS-5–20% polyacrylamide gels, and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. Membranes were blocked with 0.01 m Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4 (TS buffer) containing 5% (w/v) skim milk and 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20. GPVI was detected using 1–5 μg/ml anti-GPVI antibodies and HRP-conjugated IgG secondary antibodies and visualized by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Two-dimensional SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Analysis of Biotinylated Platelets—Washed human platelets were either unlabeled or labeled with N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions and were treated with convulxin (0.5 μg/ml) for 3 min at room temperature to induce GPVI dimer formation. Biotinylated platelets were lysed in TS buffer containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 5 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitor mixture, precleared with protein A-Sepharose, and immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-GPVI tail antibody (40Gardiner E.

Samples of convulxin-treated unlabeled or biotinylated platelet lysates and immunoprecipitates were Western blotted with anti-GPVI monoclonal antibody 6B12 as described above. For two-dimensional gel analysis, biotinylated platelet lysate was resolved in the first dimension under nonreducing conditions on SDS-7.5%-polyacrylamide tube gels and in the second dimension under reducing conditions on SDS-7.5%-polyacrylamide slab gels essentially as described previously (41Stomski F.C.

Expression of Wild-type and Mutant GPVI—Rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (CSL, Melbourne, Australia), 0.75% (w/v) NaHCO3, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate, as well as penicillin, streptomycin, and antimycin. RBL cells were stably transfected with wild-type human GPVI cDNA in growth medium containing 1.0 mg/ml G418 as described previously (43Locke D. Liu C. Peng X. Chen H. Kahn M.L. J. Biol.

Oligonucleotides for mutagenesis were as follows: C274S (23-mers) forward primer, GGTCCGGATATCCCTCGGGGCTG, and reverse primer, CAGCCCCGAGGGATATCCGGACC; and C338S (31-mers) forward primer, CACAGCCGCGGGTTATCTTATGATCTAGAG, and reverse primer, CTCTAGATCATGAAGATAACCCGCGGCTG. Cells were sorted for expression of GPVI using a FACSvantage DiVa (BD Biosciences) with anti-GPVI monoclonal antibody 6B12, and cells positive for GPVI isolated. Expression of wild-type and mutant GPVI was monitored by flow cytometry and Western blotting using 6B12. Ligand-induced Dimerization of GPVI on RBL Cells—RBL cells expressing wild-type and mutant GPVI were plated onto 6-well plates 24 h prior to an experiment to achieve >90% confluency. Culture medium was removed and cell monolayers rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer (0.01 m NaH2PO4, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 1 mm Ca2+/Mg2+, and then treated with either PBS alone or PBS containing 0.5 μg/ml convulxin at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in TS buffer containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor mixture, cleared of nuclei and cell debris by centrifugation and analyzed by Western blot as described above. Rapid Ligand-induced Induction of a High Molecular Weight GPVI Complex on Platelets—In resting platelets, GPVI is present as an ∼65-kDa monomer under both reducing and nonreducing conditions (8Gardiner E.E. Arthur J.F. Kahn M.L. Berndt M.C. Andrews R.K. Blood. 2004; 104: 3611-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). However, treatment of platelets with the snake venom protein convulxin induced both platelet aggregation (Fig. 1B) and the appearance of a high molecular weight GPVI complex (GPVIc) at ∼120 kDa under nonreducing conditions, detectable by Western blotting with anti-GPVI antibody 6B12 (Fig. 1A). GPVIc was not detectable under reducing conditions (Fig. 1C), indicating that the complex involved a disulfide bond(s). Levels of GPVIc were detectable in 15 s, peaked at 1–3 min (Fig. 1A), and began to disappear after 3 min. The loss of GPVIc corresponded to maximal platelet aggregation (Fig. 1B) and to the metalloproteinase-dependent cleavage of intact GPVI (8Gardiner E.E. Arthur J.F. Kahn M.L. Berndt M.C. Andrews R.K. Blood. 2004; 104: 3611-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) that occurs more slowly (3–60 min), resulting in the appearance of the ∼55-kDa ectodomain fragment (GPVIf). GPVIc was also present in lysates of platelets treated with collagen (see below) and CRP (data not shown) under nonreducing conditions; however, convulxin is a more potent agonist, presumably related to the extent of ligand-induced cross-linking, and was used for further analysis. The generation of GPVIc after 30 s was proportional to the agonist concentration (Fig. 1D). At maximal levels (1–3 μg/ml convulxin), the amount of GPVIc represented 60–70% of total platelet GPVI. At this time point (30 s), GPVI shedding from the platelet surface is negligible (Fig. 1A), confirming that formation of GPVIc on the platelet surface occurred prior to receptor shedding. To assess whether GPVIc was a homodimer, convulxin-treated biotinylated platelets were analyzed on two-dimensional nonreduced/reduced SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The formation of ligand-induced GPVIc was unaffected by biotinylation, was immunoprecipitated by anti-GPVI tail antibody (Fig. 2A), and produced a single spot on a two-dimensional gel recognizable by both anti-GPVI antibody and by avidin-HRP (Fig. 2B, arrow). Anti-GPVI and avidin-HRP also recognized a spot corresponding to GPVI monomer in both dimensions (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that the GPVIc is a homodimer of GPVI. GPVIc Formation Is Not Blocked by Inhibitors of GPVI Signaling—Results shown in Fig. 1 suggest that the formation of GPVIc occurred rapidly (within 15 s). GPVI signaling that occurs on this time scale (5Polgar J. Clemetson J.M. Kehrel B.E. Wiedemann M. Magnenat E.M. Wells T.N. Clemetson K.J. J. Biol.

When platelets were incubated with inhibitors of the GPVI-related signaling molecules, Src family kinases (PP2; 10 μm), Syk (piceatannol; 30 μg/ml) or phosphoinositide 3-kinase (wortmannin; 0.1 μm), convulxin-induced GPVIc was detected after 30 s (Fig. 3A). Consistent with previous results (8Gardiner E.E. Arthur J.F. Kahn M.L. Berndt M.C. Andrews R.K. Blood. 2004; 104: 3611-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), these inhibitors blocked ligand-induced shedding of the ∼55-kDa GPVI fragment (Fig. 3A) and inhibited proteolysis of GPVIc (cf. Fig. 1A). These results indicate that GPVIc is formed prior to the onset of ligand-induced GPVI signaling and that GPVI signaling is not required for GPVIc formation. In this regard, we only tested inhibitors related to GPVI-dependent signaling but do not rule out the possibility that other pathways associated with GPVI function (46Rabie T. Varga-Szabo D. Bender M. Pozgaj R. Lanza F. Saito T. Watson S.P. Nieswandt B. Blood. 2007; 110: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) might affect disulfide bond formation. The dissociation of calmodulin from its binding site within the GPVI cytoplasmic tail is an early event that occurs upon GPVI ligand binding (47Andrews R.K. Suzuki-Inoue K. Shen Y. Tulasne D. Watson S.P. Berndt M.C. Blood. 2002; 99: 4219-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and calmodulin dissociation induced by treatment of platelets with calmodulin inhibitors such as W7 triggers ligand-independent shedding of GPVI after 2 h (8Gardiner E.E. Arthur J.F. Kahn M.L. Berndt M.C. Andrews R.K. Blood. 2004; 104: 3611-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To assess a possible role for calmodulin in regulating GPVIc, platelets were treated with W7 and lysates analyzed under nonreducing conditions. However, treatment with W7 (150 μm, final concentration) up to 2 h did not induce formation of GPVIc (Fig. 3B), although as observed previously (8Gardiner E.E. Arthur J.F. Kahn M.L. Berndt M.C. Andrews R.K. Blood. 2004; 104: 3611-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), shedding of GPVI occurred after 2 h (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these results indicate that formation of GPVIc occurs within seconds of ligand binding, and is independent of downstream ligand-induced GPVI signaling events or calmodulin association. The possible involvement of membrane raft domains was also assessed; however, the raft-disrupting reagent methyl-β-cyclodextrin (15Arthur J.F. Gardiner E.E. Matzaris M. Taylor S.G. Wijeyewickrema L. Ozaki Y. Kahn M.L. Andrews R.K. Berndt M.C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2005; 93: 716-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) did not affect formation of the high molecular weight GPVI complex (data not shown). GPVIc Is Stable When GPVI Ectodomain Shedding Is Blocked—Similar to inhibitors of GPVI signaling that block ligand-induced metalloproteinase-mediated proteolysis of GPVI and GPVIc, the metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001, previously shown to block ligand-induced shedding of GPVI (8Gardiner E.E. Arthur J.F. Kahn M.L. Berndt M.C. Andrews R.K. Blood. 2004; 104: 3611-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), also protects convulxin-induced GPVIc on platelets (Fig. 4A). Under these conditions, collagen also induces formation of the disulfide-linked form of GPVI (Fig. 4C). This shows that the disulfide-linked form of GPVI is the same as that induced by convulxin and that it is less abundant than the convulxin-induced form. Lysates of convulxin-tre"

Keratan sulfate carbohydrate chains consist of repeating N-acetyllactosamine disaccharides with sulfation on the 6-O positions of N-acetylglucosamine and galactose. Despite its importance for corneal function, the biosynthetic pathway of the carbohydrate chain and particularly the elongation steps are poorly understood. Here we analyzed enzymatic activity of two glycosyltransferases, β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltansferase-7 (β3GnT7) and β1,4-galactosyltransferase-4 (β4GalT4), in the production of keratan sulfate carbohydrate in vitro. These glycosyltransferases produced only short, elongated carbohydrates when they were reacted with substrate in the absence of a carbohydrate sulfotransferase; however, they produced extended GlcNAc-sulfated poly-N-acetyllactosamine structures with more than four repeats of the GlcNAc-sulfated N-acetyllactosamine unit in the presence of corneal N-acetylglucosamine 6-O sulfotransferase (CGn6ST). Moreover, we detected production of highly sulfated keratan sulfate by a two-step reaction in vitro with a mixture of β3GnT7/β4GalT4/CGn6ST followed by keratan sulfate galactose 6-O sulfotransferase treatment. We also observed that production of highly sulfated keratan sulfate in cultured human corneal epithelial cells was dramatically reduced when expression of β3GnT7 or β4GalT4 was suppressed by small interfering RNAs, indicating that these glycosyltransferases are responsible for elongation of the keratan sulfate carbohydrate backbone.

Production of the GAG chain takes place mostly in the Golgi apparatus. Several glycosyltransferases and carbohydrate-modifying enzymes such as sulfotransferases act on GAG elongation and modification. So far almost all of the enzymes involved in GAG production are cloned and analyzed for their enzymatic activities; however, the process of GAG production is still unknown in some GAGs because of the presence of multiple enzymes with redundant activities. Keratan sulfate (KS) PGs are major components of the cornea and also found in cartilage and brain. Because of the high concentration of these molecules in the cornea, their biological function has been extensively studied and found to include maintenance of corneal extracellular matrix structure (1Cornuet P.K.

Production of the KS GAG chain on PGs is processed by glycosyltransferases and sulfotransferases localized in the Golgi apparatus, and matured KS PGs are secreted into the extracellular matrix. Elongation of the carbohydrate backbone of the KS GAG chain is catalyzed by enzymes of two glycosyltransferase families, β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (β3GnT) and β1,4-galactosyltransferase (β4GalT), and sulfation of the chain is catalyzed by two carbohydrate sulfotransferases. Recent studies of carbohydrate sulfotransferases have identified enzymes responsible for sulfation of the corneal KS GAG chain as KS galactose 6-O sulfotransferase (KSG6ST) and corneal N-acetylglucosamine 6-O sulfotransferase (CGn6ST, also known as GlcNAc6ST-5 and GST4β) (15Fukuta M.

Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). KSG6ST also prefers a sulfated carbohydrate as substrate (15Fukuta M. Inazawa J. Torii T. Tsuzuki K. Shimada E. Habuchi O.

Patients with macular corneal dystrophy type I, which is caused by deficiency of functional CGn6ST, have no detectable highly sulfated KS in the cornea (18Akama T.O. Nishida K. Nakayama J.

Observations that macular corneal dystrophy patients with CGn6ST mutations develop corneal opacities (21Klintworth G.K. Front.

Akama T.O. Beecher N. Lewis P. Young R.D. Meek K.M. Kerr B. Hughes C.E. Caterson B. Tanigami A. Nakayama J. Fukada M.N. Tano Y. Nishida K. Quantock A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13333-13338Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) indicate important roles for KS GAG sulfation in the function and maintenance of the cornea. However, unlike KS sulfation, mechanisms underlying KS GAG chain elongation are poorly understood. In humans, β3GnT and β4GalT enzymes are encoded by eight and seven genes, respectively. Among these, β3GnT7 and β4GalT4 are thought to be responsible for elongation of the KS carbohydrate chain because these enzymes have higher activity for sulfated than nonsulfated substrates (22Seko A. Dohmae N. Takio K. Yamashita K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9150-9158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23Seko A. Yamashita K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 556: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); however, direct evidence in support of this hypothesis has not been reported. Here, using soluble forms of recombinant enzymes and glycosidase-assisted column chromatography, we demonstrate that β3GnT7 and β4GalT4 can produce KS GAG carbohydrate in vitro. We also observed that suppressing expression of either β3GnT7 or β4GalT4 reduced highly sulfated KS GAG production in cultured human corneal cells, indicating that these glycosyltransferases are responsible for KS GAG elongation. Construction of Expression Vectors Encoding Soluble Forms of Enzymes—cDNAs encoding the catalytic domains of β4GalT4 and β3GnT7 were PCR-amplified using human placental Marathon-Ready cDNA (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) as template and the following primers: β4GalT4, 5′-ATTGATATCCCTAAAGCAAAGGAGTTCATGGC-3′ and 5′-TAACTCGAGTCATGCACCAAACCAGAAATCCACT-3′; and β3GnT7, 5′-TTTGATATCAGTCTCACCCCTGGTCAGTTTCTGCA-3′ and 5′-TTCCTCGAGAGCAAGTGCCCTGGCCTGTCCTAGTA-3′. Amplified DNAs were digested with EcoRV and XhoI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pcDNA3.1-HSH (24Angata K. Yen T.Y. El-Battari A. Macher B.A. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15369-15377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To construct an expression vector for soluble KSG6ST, we amplified cDNA encoding the catalytic domain of KSG6ST using the primer pair, 5′-ATTGGATCCATGCCCCGGGCTGGCAGAG and 5′-GGTGCTCGAGGTCACGAGAAGGGGCGGAAGTC-3′. The product was digested with BamHI and XhoI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pcDNA3.1-HSH. Construction of expression vectors for intact and soluble CGn6ST was described previously (25Akama T.O. Nakayama J. Nishida K. Hiraoka N. Suzuki M. McAuliffe J. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. Fukuda M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16271-16278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Preparation of Soluble Enzymes—Expression vectors or an empty pcDNA3.1-HSH were transfected individually into Lec20 cells (26Lee J. Sundaram S. Shaper N.L. Raju T.S. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13924-13934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. Pamela Stanley, using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were then cultured for 24 h with α-minimum essential medium (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and the medium was replaced with Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 40 μg/ml of l-proline and cultured cells for 24 h at 37 °C. We then concentrated the culture medium up to 200-fold using a Microcon YM-30 (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and mixed that medium (1:1) with glycerol for storage at -20 °C. Protein production was confirmed by Western analysis using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-T7 tag antibody (Novagen, Madison, WI) and the LumiPhos WB chemiluminescence solution (Pierce). KS Synthesis in Vitro—As a starting substrate, we prepared the monosulfated trisaccharide carbohydrate 35SO3−-6GlcNAcβ1–6Manα1–6Manα-octyl by treatment of the chemically synthesized trisaccharide GlcNAcβ1–6Manα1–6Manα-octyl with soluble CGn6ST enzyme as described (16Akama T.O. Misra A.K. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42505-42513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), except the amount of the trisaccharide (2.5 nmol) and 35S-PAPS (10 μCi; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was changed to maximize labeling efficiency (5–10 × 106 cpm/2.5 nmol of substrate). For enzymatic KS synthesis in vitro, we incubated a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2, 5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm 5′-AMP, 0.25 mm UDP-galactose (Sigma), 0.3 mm UDP-GlcNAc (Sigma), 100 μg/ml protamine chloride, 1 mm PAPS (Sigma), 3 × 106 cpm of the starting substrate, and a mixture of concentrated medium of 0.5 μl of β4GalT4, 5 μl of β3GnT7, and 5 μl of CGn6ST with or without 4 μl of KSG6ST at 37 °C for 16 h. We then stopped the reaction by incubation in boiling water and removed insoluble debris by centrifugation before column chromatography. For additional KSG6ST treatment, the reaction mixture of β3GnT7/β4GalT4/CGn6ST was incubated in boiling water and incubated for 21 h at 37 °C after the addition of KSG6ST and PAPS. Column Chromatography—To determine the size of reaction products, we performed gel filtration chromatography with a column (1.0-cm diameter × 120-cm length) of Bio-Gel P-4 (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 100 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6.8. The reaction mixture samples were applied to the column, and the eluate was collected in 1-ml fractions. The elution pattern of carbohydrate products was monitored by counting 35S radioactivity using a liquid scintillation counter. For further analyses, we pooled radioactive fractions, desalted them by Sephadex G25 gel filtration (Sigma) equilibrated with 7% (v/v) 1-propanol/water medium, and lyophilized the samples again. To identify the degree of sulfation of products, we separated them by anion exchange HPLC using a Whatman Partisil SAX-10 column (4.6-mm diameter × 25-cm length). The column was first equilibrated with 60% acetonitrile/water, and then after loading a sample, the products were eluted under the following conditions: 60% acetonitrile/water for 5 min; a linear gradient from 60% acetonitrile/water to either 45 mm (up to tetrasulfated materials); or 70 mm (up to heptasulfated materials) KH2PO4 containing 60% acetonitrile/water for 75 min. The flow rate was 1 ml/min, 1-ml fractions were collected, and 35S radioactivity was monitored as described. To evaluate sulfation status, we prepared multi-sulfated carbohydrate standards by enzymatic reactions as described previously (16Akama T.O. Misra A.K. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42505-42513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Glycosidase-associated Carbohydrate Structure Determination—To determine nonreducing terminal structure of materials in P-4 gel filtration fractions, the purified materials were treated with glycosidases and analyzed as described above. For β-galactosidase and hexosaminidase A treatments, lyophilized samples were dissolved in water and incubated with either 25 milliunits of Jack bean β-galactosidase (Seikagaku Co., Tokyo, Japan) or 5 milliunits of human placental hexosaminidase A (Sigma) in a 30-μl mixture containing 50 mm sodium citrate buffer pH 3.5, at 37 °C for 5 min (β-galactosidase) or for 16 h (hexosaminidase A). The samples were then boiled for 5 min, and the digests were separated by column chromatography. For keratanase treatment, we incubated purified samples with 75 milliunits of keratanase from Pseudomonas sp. (Seikagaku Co.) in a 20-μl mixture containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 37 °C for an hour, stopped the enzymatic reaction by boiling, and subjected samples to column chromatography. KS Synthesis in Cultured Human Corneal Epithelial Cells—SV40-immortalized human corneal epithelial cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 50/50 mix medium (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 4.2 μg/ml of bovine insulin, 0.8 μg/ml of cholera toxin (Invitrogen), 8.3 μg/ml of mouse epidermal growth factor (Invitrogen) and 33 μg/ml gentamycin (Sigma). To produce sulfated KS, we co-transfected CGn6ST and KSG6ST expression vectors into 1 × 106 cells using Nucleofector electroporator (Amaxa Inc. Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's instruction and cultured cells in the above medium at 37 °C for 48 h. To analyze effects of glycosyltransferase expression on KS production, we co-transfected CGn6ST and KSG6ST expression vectors together with specific glycosyltransferase siRNAs (sequence information is listed in supplemental Table S1), which were obtained from Ambion (Austin, TX). As a negative control, we used a commercially available negative control siRNA (NC#2; Ambion). Western Blot Analysis of Highly Sulfated KS—Transfected cells were washed with cold PBS five times, and lysates were prepared using 120 μl of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, a 1× proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were electroblotted to an Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore). The membranes were treated with blocking buffer (10% nonfat milk in PBS) at room temperature for 1 h and then probed with 5D4 anti-KS antibody (1:4000) (Seikagaku Co.) in blocking buffer for 1 h. The membranes were washed in 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS three times and reacted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:4000) in blocking buffer for 1 h. After washing membranes in 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS three times, signals were detected using the ECL Plus reagent (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). Signal intensity was calculated using NIH Image 1.62 software. Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from transfected cells by RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. After DNase I treatment, we subjected samples to reverse transcription using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR analysis was carried out using Power SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with a specific primer set for each glycosyltransferase gene (see supplemental Table S2). Amplification of DNA products was monitored by the Mx 3000 QPCR system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the following reaction conditions: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. Cyclophilin A mRNA served as the internal control. GlcNAc-sulfated Poly-N-acetyllactosamine Production by β3GnT7, β4GalT4, and CGn6ST in Vitro—To analyze enzymatic activity of β3GnT7 and β4GalT4 for KS carbohydrate synthesis in vitro, we constructed expression vectors encoding soluble glycosyltransferases and the sulfotransferases, KSG6ST and CGn6ST, and transfected Lec20 cells, a cell line derived from Chinese hamster ovary cells, with vectors individually to secrete enzymes into the medium (Fig. 1). Because Lec20 cells do not produce endogenous β4GalT1 (26Lee J. Sundaram S. Shaper N.L. Raju T.S. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13924-13934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), most glycosyltransferase activity in the medium originates from the transfected expression vector (Fig. 1B). Enzymes prepared from the culture medium were mixed in several combinations and incubated with a monosulfated trisaccharide substrate, 35SO3−-6GlcNAcβ1–6Manα1–6Manα-octyl, and carbohydrate donor substrates, UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-Gal, and PAPS. After 16 h of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction products were analyzed by P-4 gel filtration column chromatography (Fig. 2). When the substrate was reacted with a mixture of β3GnT7 and β4GalT4 glycosyltransferases, two major products were detected as molecules larger than the substrate (Fig. 2A), indicating that the two enzymes can add carbohydrate onto the carbohydrate substrate. When we incubated the substrate with a mixture of β3GnT7, β4GalT4, and CGn6ST, we detected several products of much larger size (Fig. 2B) than products from a mixture lacking CGn6ST (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2P-4 gel filtration patterns of enzymatic KS synthesis products in vitro. Radiolabeled monosulfated trisaccharide substrate was treated with a mixture of two enzymes, β3GnT7 and β4GalT4 (A) or a mixture of three enzymes, β3GnT7, β4GalT4, and CGn6ST (B), and analyzed on a P-4 column. Detected fractions were collected separately (fractions I-IV in B), and further analyzed by P-4 column chromatography without glycosidase treatment (closed diamonds), after hexosaminidase A treatment (open circles), after β-galactosidase treatment (closed circles), or after sequential treatments with β-galactosidase followed with hexosaminidase A (closed triangles). Analyzed chromatograms of fractions I, II, III, and IV are shown in C–F, respectively. Arrows at S, I, II, III, IV, and II-1 indicate retention positions of starting substrate, fractions I, II, III, IV, and II-1, respectively. Fractions I–IV and hexosaminidase A-treated fractions (II-1, II-2, III-1, III-2, IV-1, and IV-2) are collected separately and analyzed by SAX-10 HPLC.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify the carbohydrate structure of the products, we collected products separately and analyzed them by glycosidase treatment followed by column chromatography. Fraction I, containing the most abundant product, was slightly larger than the starting substrate by P-4 gel filtration column chromatography, and its size was not altered by hexosaminidase A treatment (Fig. 2C). However, a component of fraction I was converted to a digested fraction with the same retention position as the starting substrate by β-galactosidase treatment (Fig. 2C). This result indicates that the product in fraction I was a tetrasaccharide carbohydrate resulting from addition of one galactose on the nonreducing terminal of the starting trisaccharide substrate by β4GalT4. This tetrasaccharide product was next analyzed by SAX-10 anion exchange chromatography, and the product was found to be a monosulfated carbohydrate (Fig. 3A). From these results, we conclude that the product was monosulfated tetrasaccharide Galβ1-4( 35SO3−-6)GlcNAcβ1–6Manα1-6Manα1-octyl. We next analyzed the carbohydrate structure found in fraction II (Fig. 2B) using the same strategy. A chromatogram of fraction II on a P-4 column showed a broader peak (Fig. 2D), but the pattern was converted to a sharper peak by β-galactosidase treatment (fraction II′ in Fig. 2D). Meanwhile, hexosaminidase A treatment, which hydrolyzes both nonsulfated GlcNAc and 6-O-sulfated GlcNAc located on nonreducing terminal of a carbohydrate substrate (27Kresse H. Fuchs W. Glossl J. Holtfrerich D. Gilberg W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12926-12932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), converted constituents of fraction II into two components (II-1 and II-2 in Fig. 2D). Because the retention positions of fractions II′ and II-1 were very close but not identical and because both peaks overlapped with the original broad peak of fraction II (Fig. 2D), we conclude that fraction II contains a mixture of fractions II′ and II-1 and that the II-1 component is hydrolyzed by β-galactosidase and converted to component II′ (Fig. 2D). We also performed sequential digestion of fraction II components with β-galactosidase followed by hexosaminidase A and found that all products were converted to a single fraction having the same elution position as fraction II-2 and also fraction I (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that the carbohydrate backbone structure of fraction II is a mixture of a pentasaccharide, GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–6Manα1–6Manα1-octyl (fraction II′), and a hexasaccharide, Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–6Manα1–6Manα1-octyl (fraction II-1), and that hexosaminidase A treatment converted the pentasaccharide product (fraction II′) into a tetrasaccharide carbohydrate, Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–6Manα1–6Manα1-octyl (fraction II-2). The sulfation status of components of II, II-1, and II-2 was analyzed by a SAX-10 column (Fig. 3, B–D). Fraction II was separated into two components, monosulfated material and disulfated material (Fig. 3B). Fraction II-1 was also separated into two components, both of which eluted at the same positions as fraction II, but the proportion of mono- to disulfated materials in fraction II-1 was nearly 1:1 (Fig. 3C). Because increased sulfation was apparently due to the presence of CGn6ST, disulfated components found in fractions II and II-1 were sulfated on GlcNAc in the carbohydrate products. Fraction II-2, which was originally a pentasaccharide component in fraction II and was converted to a tetrasaccharide by hexosaminidase A, was identified as a single component of monosulfated carbohydrate (Fig. 3D). However, because hexosaminidase A hydrolyzes the nonreducing terminal GlcNAc both with or without sulfate modification, the degree of sulfation of fraction II-2 does not represent the sulfation status of pentasaccharide components originally found in fraction II. Thus, we estimated the presence of disulfated pentasaccharide components and calculated the amount of mono- and disulfated pentasaccharide components in fraction II (see supplemental Tables S3–S5). From these results, we conclude that fraction II consists of four molecules: mono- and disulfated hexasaccharide, Galβ1–4(±SO3−-6)GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4( 35SO3−-6)GlcNAc-β1–6Manα1–6Manα1-octyl, and mono- and disulfated pentasaccharide, ±SO3−-6GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4( 35SO3−-6) GlcNAcβ1–6Manα1–6Manα1-octyl. Similar to fraction II, components of fractions III and IV were separated into two fractions by he"
https://openalex.org/W1999683023,"This study determined the consequences of dopamine denervation of the striatum on synaptic plasticity and prevention of these changes with gene therapy using an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) expressing glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). C57BL6/J mice were injected with the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine(MPTP); long-term depression (LTD) or potentiation (LTP) were measured in vitro. Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry measured electrically released dopamine from a functionally relevant pool in these same striatal slices. After MPTP, dopamine release and uptake were greatly diminished, and LTP and LTD were blocked in the striatal slices. The loss of plasticity resulted directly from the loss of dopamine since its application rescued synaptic plasticity. Striatal GDNF expression via AAV, before MPTP, significantly protected against the loss of dopamine and prevented the blockade of corticostriatal LTP. These data demonstrate that dopamine plays a role in supporting several forms of striatal plasticity and that GDNF expression via AAV prevents the loss of dopamine and striatal plasticity caused by MPTP. We propose that impairment of striatal plasticity after dopamine denervation plays a role in the symptomology of Parkinson's disease and that AAV expression of neurotrophic factors represents a tenable approach to protecting against or slowing these neurobiological deficits."
https://openalex.org/W2073050582,"The sequence of the catalytic intermediates in the reaction of cytochrome bd terminal oxidases from Escherichia coli and Azotobacter vinelandii with oxygen was monitored in real time by absorption spectroscopy and electrometry. The initial binding of O2 to the fully reduced enzyme is followed by the fast (5 μs) conversion of the oxy complex to a novel, previously unresolved intermediate. In this transition, low spin heme b558 remains reduced while high spin heme b595 is oxidized with formation of a new heme d-oxygen species with an absorption maximum at 635 nm. Reduction of O2 by two electrons is sufficient to produce (hydro)peroxide bound to ferric heme d. In this case, the O-O bond is left intact and the newly detected intermediate must be a peroxy complex of heme d (Fe 3+d-O-O-(H)) corresponding to compound 0 in peroxidases. The alternative scenario where the O-O bond is broken as in the PM intermediate of heme-copper oxidases and compound I of peroxidases is not very likely, because it would require oxidation of a nearby amino acid residue or the porphyrin ring that is energetically unfavorable in the presence of the reduced heme b558 in the proximity of the catalytic center. The formation of the peroxy intermediate is not coupled to membrane potential generation, indicating that hemes d and b595 are located at the same depth of the membrane dielectric. The lifetime of the new intermediate is 47 μs; it decays into oxoferryl species due to oxidation of low spin heme b558 that is linked to significant charge translocation across the membrane.

A transient formation of an intermediate equivalent to compound 0 has been proposed but never documented in heme-copper oxidases. Cytochromes bd comprise a peculiar class of terminal oxidases performing a number of vitally important functions in bacteria (Ref. 24Borisov V.B. Forte E. Sarti P. Brunori M. Konstantinov A.A. Giuffre A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 355: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar and references therein). Like heme-copper oxidases, cytochrome bd conserves energy in the form of electrochemical proton gradient (Δμ +H) across the membrane accumulated in the reaction of the reduction of molecular oxygen to water (25Poole R.K.

Cytochrome bd, however, is not a proton pump (30Puustinen A. Finel M. Haltia T. Gennis R.B. Wikstrom M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3936-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), and the formation of Δμ +H occurs only due to the vectorial chemistry where the protons from quinol oxidation are released into the positive (periplasmic) side of the membrane whereas protons required for water formation are taken up from the negative (cytoplasmic) side. Cytochrome bd uses ubiquinol or menaquinol, but never cytochrome c, as a natural respiratory substrate. Cytochrome bd contains three hemes (b558, b595, and d) but no copper (27Junemann S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1321: 107-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The low spin heme b558 seems to be directly involved in quinol oxidation, whereas the high spin hemes b595 and d likely form a di-heme catalytic site for binding and activation of O2, reducing it further to H2O (31Hill J.J.

In this work, we studied the reaction of the R cytochromes bd from Escherichia coli and Azotobacter vinelandii with oxygen, using the flow-flash method by means of spectroscopic and electrometric techniques that allow the recording of absorption spectra and membrane potential development with 1-μs time resolution. We were able to detect a transient formation of a spectrally discernible intermediate between A and F. Carbon monoxide, oxygen, nitrogen, and argon gases were from AGA; plant l-lecithin was from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Other basic chemicals and biochemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich, Merck, Anatrace, Fluka, and Serva. E. coli cells were obtained from GO105/pTK1 strain according to Ref. 46Kaysser T.M. Ghaim J.B. Georgiou C. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13491-13501Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, and cytochrome bd oxidase was isolated from cell membranes as described (37Belevich I.

Concentration of the enzymes from E. coli and A. vinelandii was determined from the dithionite-reduced minus as isolated difference absorption spectra using Δϵ628–607 of 10.8 mm-1 cm-1 (33Borisov V. Arutyunyan A.M. Osborne J.P. Gennis R.B. Konstantinov A.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 740-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and Δϵ628–605 of 9.5 mm-1 cm-1 (49Belevich I. Borisov V.B. Bloch D.A. Konstantinov A.A. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2007; (in press)Google Scholar), respectively. Time-resolved Spectrophotometric Measurements—Time-resolved spectrophotometric measurements were performed using a home-built CCD-based instrument. The setup allows acquiring absorption change surfaces with a time resolution of 1 μs between the spectra. Details of the methodology can be found in Ref. 50Belevich I. Bloch D.A. Belevich N.

To obtain the CO complex of the R enzyme, the as-isolated enzyme was (i) deoxygenated by argon equilibration, (ii) reduced under anaerobic conditions with 2.5 mm sodium ascorbate and 5 μm N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-1,4-phenylenediamine, and (iii) equilibrated with 1% CO. The R-CO enzyme was transferred to the stopped flow module in a gas-tight Hamilton syringe preflushed with argon and then mixed with oxygen. CO photolysis was initiated by a laser flash (Brilliant B; Quantel, Les Ulis, France; frequency-doubled YAG, 532 nm; pulse energy, 120 mJ). Time-resolved Measurement of Electric Potential Generation—Reconstitution of cytochrome bd into liposomes, the anaerobic sample preparation, and time-resolved electrometric measurements were made as reported (Refs. 37Belevich I. Borisov V.B. Zhang J. Yang K. Konstantinov A.A. Gennis R.B. Verkhovsky M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3657-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 39Jasaitis A. Borisov V.B. Belevich N.P. Morgan J.E. Konstantinov A.A. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13800-13809Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar and references therein). Software for Experiments and Data Analysis—Instrumental software for experimental setups was written by Dr. N. Belevich (Helsinki, Finland). MATLAB (The Mathworks, South Natick, MA) was used for data analysis and presentation. Four Sequential Steps of the Catalytic Cycle—The flow-flash method is a powerful tool for the study of terminal oxidases (51Gibson Q. Greenwood C. Biochem. J. 1963; 86: 541-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). We used this approach to examine the reaction of cytochrome bd oxidases from E. coli and A. vinelandii in the R state with oxygen on the microsecond time scale at +21 °C. To resolve the transient formation and decay of the reaction intermediates, we recorded the optical changes with a time resolution of 1 spectrum/μs. The spectra on Fig. 1A show the development of the optical changes during the first 100 μs of the reaction with the E. coli enzyme. The changes at 560, 595, and in the range of 630–680 nm indicate that all of the three hemes, b558, b595, and d, are involved in this reaction. Fig. 1B shows a time course of the absorbance changes at 654–635 nm. The kinetic behavior at the selected pair of wavelengths clearly shows all sequential phases, because each next phase has an opposite direction of the signal development. The initial unresolved decrease of absorbance reflects the photolysis of CO from the reduced enzyme (R-CO → R transition) and is followed by the three more transitions that can be well resolved. Global analysis of the surface of the spectra reveals that these transitions can be fitted as three sequential steps with time constants of 1.4, 4.5, and 47 μs (Fig. 1B, main panel) and the corresponding kinetic difference spectra can be obtained (Fig. 1C). The spectrum of the 1.4-μs phase has a trough at 630 nm and a peak at 654 nm (Fig. 1C, dotted line), which is typical of O2 binding to ferrous heme d (52Belevich I. Borisov V.B. Konstantinov A.A. Verkhovsky M.I. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4567-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, the 1.4-μs phase can be clearly assigned to the formation of the A intermediate (R → A transition). It has to be noted that the rate of the A formation (τ = 1.4 μs at [O2] = 365 μm) linearly depends on the concentration of O2 (data not shown; see also Refs. 38Hill B.C. Hill J.J. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15110-15115Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 49Belevich I. Borisov V.B. Bloch D.A. Konstantinov A.A. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2007; (in press)Google Scholar). The spectrum of the 4.5-μs phase shown in Fig. 1C (solid line) has a minimum at 654 nm (decay of the A intermediate) and a maximum at 635 nm that reflects the formation of an intermediate that has not been resolved in earlier studies (38Hill B.C. Hill J.J. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15110-15115Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 39Jasaitis A. Borisov V.B. Belevich N.P. Morgan J.E. Konstantinov A.A. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13800-13809Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We denote this new reaction intermediate as P and the 4.5-μs phase as the A → P transition. The rate of the P formation does not depend on the concentration of O2. The spectrum of the 47-μs phase (Fig. 1C, dashed line) has troughs at 561 nm (due to the oxidation of heme b558) and at 640 nm (decay of the P intermediate) and a peak at 680 nm. The 680-nm peak is diagnostic of the heme d oxoferryl species (F) (45Kahlow M.A. Zuberi T.M. Gennis R.B. Loehr T.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11485-11489Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar); thus, the 47-μs phase corresponds to the P → F transition. As shown in the inset of Fig. 1B, the oxygen-induced absorption changes of the A. vinelandii cytochrome bd are very similar to those of the E. coli enzyme. With the A. vinelandii enzyme, the apparent time constants for the R → A, A → P, and P → F transitions are 1.6, 9.7, and 20.4 μs, respectively. Because cytochrome bd carries the three redox groups, it is three electron-reduced in the R state. The reaction of the three electron-reduced enzyme with oxygen stalls at the F state, as expected (38Hill B.C. Hill J.J. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15110-15115Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 39Jasaitis A. Borisov V.B. Belevich N.P. Morgan J.E. Konstantinov A.A. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13800-13809Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, under specific conditions of the enzyme isolation, it is possible to purify cytochrome bd from E. coli that retains some quantity of bound quinol (37Belevich I. Borisov V.B. Zhang J. Yang K. Konstantinov A.A. Gennis R.B. Verkhovsky M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3657-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Such a reduced enzyme contains five reducing equivalents, and the O2 reaction proceeds beyond F. Our experiments with this enzyme preparation show an additional phase with τ = 1.1 ms. The spectrum of the 1.1-ms phase has a minimum at 680 and a maximum at 645 nm (Fig. 1C, gray solid line) that may be assigned to the conversion of F to the oxidized enzyme (O) or more likely into the oxy complex (A) because bound quinol is a two electron donor. The Role of the Heme Groups in the Formation of the Catalytic Cycle Intermediates—When the complex of the ferrous heme d with oxygen forms (R → A transition), the b-type hemes remain reduced, as evidenced by the lack of the distinct troughs at 560 and 595 nm in the spectrum of the 1.4-μs phase (Fig. 1C). In contrast, the spectrum of the 4.5-μs phase corresponding to the A → P transition has minima at 560 and 595 nm, which are typical features of the oxidized-minus-reduced spectrum of heme b595 (37Belevich I. Borisov V.B. Zhang J. Yang K. Konstantinov A.A. Gennis R.B. Verkhovsky M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3657-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 53Koland J.G. Miller M.J. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1051-1056Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 54Lorence R.M. Koland J.G. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2314-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Further support for the conclusion that heme b595 gets oxidized during the A → P transition comes from the fact that the difference spectrum of the 4.5-μs phase in the Soret is dominated by the bleaching at 440 nm (Fig. 2, solid line). The 440-nm band was identified as the Soret band of ferrous heme b595 (34Vos M.H. Borisov V.B. Liebl U. Martin J.-L. Konstantinov A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1554-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 55Zhang J. Hellwig P. Osborne J.P. Huang H.W. Moenne-Loccoz P. Konstantinov A.A. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8548-8556Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although the heme d absorption change also contributes to the Soret difference spectrum, its contribution to the Soret is usually minor compared with a b-type heme (56Poole R.K. Bacterial Energy Transduction. Academic Press, London1988: 231-291Google Scholar). It is clear that the P formation is accompanied by the oxidation of heme b595. At the same time, there is no evidence for the oxidation of heme b558 at this stage. The oxidation of heme b558 occurs during the next transition, the P → F, transition as evidenced by a prominent trough at 561 nm in the spectrum of the 47-μs phase (Fig. 1C, dashed line). Furthermore, the P → F transition is accompanied by a loss of absorbance at 430 nm and its increase at 414 nm (Fig. 2, dashed line). The peaks at 430 and 560 nm were reported to be the Soret and α bands of ferrous heme b558, respectively (29Borisov V.B. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1996; 61: 565-574Google Scholar). There is no indication that the oxidation of heme b595, observed during the P formation, contributes also to the F formation. A trough at 589 nm (Fig. 1C, dashed line) is most probably a specific spectral feature of the compound F. A similar feature was observed in the F-minus-O difference absorption spectrum where F was generated by the addition of excess hydrogen peroxide to cytochrome bd in the O state (41Borisov V. Gennis R. Konstantinov A.A. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 37: 975-982PubMed Google Scholar). The Distribution of the Charge Translocation Events along the Catalytic Cycle—An electrometric recording of the reaction of the fully reduced enzyme from E. coli with oxygen is shown in Fig. 3, dashed trace. It consists of an initial non-electrogenic phase (the lag) followed by the electrogenic phase, in agreement with previous reports (37Belevich I. Borisov V.B. Zhang J. Yang K. Konstantinov A.A. Gennis R.B. Verkhovsky M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3657-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 39Jasaitis A. Borisov V.B. Belevich N.P. Morgan J.E. Konstantinov A.A. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13800-13809Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The fit of the electrometric trace with the rate constants obtained in spectrophotometric measurements revealed that the first two processes, which were assigned to the formation of compound A followed by the transition from A to P, are electrically silent. Thus, both R → A and A → P transitions are not coupled to any charge translocation across the membrane plane. In the three electron-reduced cytochrome bd (no bound quinol), the electrically silent lag is followed by an electrogenic (Fig. 3, dashed trace) phase that develops concurrently with the 47-μs phase observed in the spectrophotometric experiment (Fig. 3, solid trace). Thus, it corresponds to the transition of the P intermediate to the F state (P → F transition). When the enzyme contains bound quinol, an additional electrogenic phase with τ of 0.6–1.1 ms is observed. This slow phase matches the corresponding spectral phase reflecting the F → A transition (37Belevich I. Borisov V.B. Zhang J. Yang K. Konstantinov A.A. Gennis R.B. Verkhovsky M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3657-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Why P Has Not Been Detected Previously—In this work, we examined the reaction of cytochromes bd from E. coli and A. vinelandii in the R state with oxygen. Earlier studies of this reaction reported that the initially formed intermediate A decays directly to F without any transient intermediate between A and F (38Hill B.C. Hill J.J. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15110-15115Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 39Jasaitis A. Borisov V.B. Belevich N.P. Morgan J.E. Konstantinov A.A. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13800-13809Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This apparently contradicts the identical reaction catalyzed by cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), where under the same conditions a transient formation of PR intermediate between A and F was documented (7Morgan J.E. Verkhovsky M.I. Wikstrom M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12235-12240Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It was concluded that in the reaction of cytochrome bd with O2 there is either no intermediate between A and F or this intermediate is too short-lived to be detected (39Jasaitis A. Borisov V.B. Belevich N.P. Morgan J.E. Konstantinov A.A. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13800-13809Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In this study, we were able to clearly resolve the transient formation of a spectrally discernible intermediate between A and F with a time constant of 4.5 μs at +21 °C (Fig. 1), which was denoted P. We suggest that P was not detected in earlier studies (38Hill B.C. Hill J.J. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15110-15115Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 39Jasaitis A. Borisov V.B. Belevich N.P. Morgan J.E. Konstantinov A.A. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13800-13809Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) due to some limitations of the methodologies used. In the work of Hill et al. (38Hill B.C. Hill J.J. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15110-15115Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the measurements were performed on the appropriate time scale of a few hundred microseconds; however, the measurements were done at selected wavelengths (Fig. 3 in Ref. 38Hill B.C. Hill J.J. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15110-15115Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) where the contribution of P was small and therefore could not have been trapped. Jasaitis et al. (39Jasaitis A. Borisov V.B. Belevich N.P. Morgan J.E. Konstantinov A.A. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13800-13809Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) tried to catch P both in the reaction of the R enzyme with O2 at -20 °C and in the reaction of the O enzyme with excess H2O2 at room temperature. Despite recording the entire spectra, the time resolution (1 ms) appeared to be not sufficient to detect P in that study, even at low temperature (39Jasaitis A. Borisov V.B. Belevich N.P. Morgan J.E. Konstantinov A.A. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13800-13809Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A question may arise why the P formation was not found in the electrometric measurement (39Jasaitis A. Borisov V.B. Belevich N.P. Morgan J.E. Konstantinov A.A. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13800-13809Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The present work shows that the initial electrically silent lag phase is actually a sum of the R → A and A → P transitions (Fig. 3). This lag phase was also observed in Ref. 39Jasaitis A. Borisov V.B. Belevich N.P. Morgan J.E. Konstantinov A.A. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13800-13809Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar and compared with the similar lag phase in CcO. It was established that in CcO the lag can be reasonably modeled as two sequential steps corresponding to the R → A and A → PR transitions (15Jasaitis A. Verkhovsky M.I. Morgan J.E. Verkhovskaya M.L. Wikstrom M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2697-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Based on the fact that the lag in cytochrome bd is markedly shorter than that in CcO, the former was fitted as a single step (39Jasaitis A. Borisov V.B. Belevich N.P. Morgan J.E. Konstantinov A.A. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13800-13809Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, it was not taken into consideration that binding of O2 to cytochrome bd (R → A transition) is ∼10 times faster compared with CcO (38Hill B.C. Hill J.J. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15110-15115Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 57Verkhovsky M.I. Morgan J.E. Wikstrom M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3079-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Much faster R → A transition in the bd oxidase obviously reduces the entire non-electrogenic lag in cytochrome bd. When such a correction with the O2 on-rates is introduced into analysis, the lag in cytochrome bd also must be fitted as two sequential non-electrogenic phases (Fig. 3). Identity of P—In the course of the reaction of the reduced cytochrome bd with O2, compound A decays to an intermediate with a maximum at 635 nm (denoted P) with τ = 4.5 μs (Fig. 1). The A → P transition coincides with the oxidation of heme b595 (Figs. 1C and 2). Reduction of O2 by two electrons is sufficient to generate a two electron-reduced form of O2 at the active site, i.e. bound (hydro)peroxide. It is not clear, however, whether the O-O bond is broken at this stage of the reaction. If the O-O bond is still intact, P corresponds to compound 0 in peroxidases, i.e. a true peroxy complex (Fe 3+d-O-O-(H)). Compound 0 was monitored in horseradish peroxidase at subzero temperatures (2Baek H.K. Van Wart H.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5714-5719Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Although an intermediate analogous to compound 0 was postulated for CcO, it has never been trapped. If the O-O bond is already broken, P is an oxoferryl species. Formation of the oxoferryl species requires four electrons to break the O-O bond. In the P state, two electrons may be taken from heme d and one from heme b595. However, the forth electron cannot be taken from heme b558 because no oxidation of heme b558 is observed at this stage (Figs. 1C and 2). Hence, if P is oxoferryl, the fourth electron should come from a nearby group, most likely amino acid residue (Fed4+ = Fed4+=O2·¯R·). In the latter case, P would be analogous to compound I of cytochrome c peroxidase or PM species of CcO. However, withdrawal of an electron from an amino acid residue requires rather high redox potential, typically higher than +0.8 V (58Stubbe J. van Der Donk W.A. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 705-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar), and the oxidation of heme b558 (Em ∼+0.15 V) (27Junemann S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1321: 107-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) would be much more favorable (∼0.65 V potential difference, or 10 orders difference in the equilibrium constant). At the same time, in our experiments the formation of P is not coupled to the oxidation of the low spin heme, in contrast to that detected during the formation of the PR oxoferryl species in heme-copper oxidases. The oxidation of the low spin heme b558 is observed only during decay of P, i.e. in the next transition. This is the reason why we suggest that in the case of cytochrome bd P is a true peroxy intermediate. Nevertheless, some further studies are required to establish its precise chemical structure. Reaction Scheme—The scheme describing the reaction reported in this work is shown in Fig. 4. The initial complex of the R cytochrome bd with CO (R-CO) is photolyzed in the presence of oxygen. The unliganded R enzyme generated by the photolysis binds O2 very rapidly, forming the ferrous heme d oxy species (A). The R → A transition is not electrogenic, and its rate is proportional to [O2] (kon = 1.9 × 109 m-1 s-1) (38Hill B.C. Hill J.J. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15110-15115Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 49Belevich I. Borisov V.B. Bloch D.A. Konstantinov A.A. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2007; (in press)Google Scholar). The A formation is followed by electron transfer from heme b595 to form P. The A → P transition occurs with k = 2.2 × 105 s-1 and is also non-electrogenic. The finding that electron transfer from heme b595 to heme d is not coupled with membrane potential generation is fully consistent with a recent study (37Belevich I. Borisov V.B. Zhang J. Yang K. Konstantinov A.A. Gennis R.B. Verkhovsky M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3657-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The chemical structure of P needs to be established. As depicted in the scheme, it is likely that P is a peroxy complex of ferric heme d. If this is the case, the bound peroxide is likely not in the anionic form but at least singly protonated. The proton may come from one of the two protonatable groups linked to the b595/d binuclear site (37Belevich I. Borisov V.B. Zhang J. Yang K. Konstantinov A.A. Gennis R.B. Verkhovsky M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3657-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) upon its oxidation. We cannot exclude, however, that at the P state the O-O bond is already broken and P could be similar to PM in CcO. The latter would be apparently inconsistent with the same reaction catalyzed by the R CcO where no PM-like intermediate preceding the formation of PR has been observed (7Morgan J.E. Verkhovsky M.I. Wikstrom M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12235-12240Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 16Morgan J.E. Verkhovsky M.I. Palmer G. Wikstrom M.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14664-14669Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The P intermediate is further converted into F with k = 2.1 × 104 s-1. This is accompanied by the oxidation of heme b558. In agreement with previous studies (37Belevich I. Borisov V.B. Zhang J. Yang K. Konstantinov A.A. Gennis R.B. Verkhovsky M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3657-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 39Jasaitis A. Borisov V.B. Belevich N.P. Morgan J.E. Konstantinov A.A. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13800-13809Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), formation of F is coupled to generation of a membrane potential. There is no doubt that at the F state the b-type hemes are in the ferric state and heme d is in the oxoferryl state. When cytochrome bd contains bound quinol, the reaction proceeds further to form the oxidized enzyme (O). The F → A transition occurs with k = 0.9 × 103 s-1 (Fig. 1C, gray solid line) and is electrogenic (37Belevich I. Borisov V.B. Zhang J. Yang K. Konstantinov A.A. Gennis R.B. Verkhovsky M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3657-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The fact that in the course of the reaction the oxidation of heme b595 precedes that of heme b558 may indicate that heme b595 is located closer to heme d than heme b558. This is in line with the proposal of physical proximity of hemes d and b595 and their functional cooperation in the O2-reducing site (31Hill J.J. Alben J.O. Gennis R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Because an intermediate spectrally and kinetically very similar to P of the E. coli cytochrome bd is also observed with the bd enzyme from A. vinelandii, P is most likely a catalytic intermediate inherent in all members of the bd-family of terminal oxidases.

Importantly, in many of these studies, AMFR was absent or present at significantly reduced levels in adjacent normal tissue. Recently, a genome-wide analysis identified AMFR as one of 189 genes that present a high frequency of intragenic mutations in breast cancer (9Sjoblom T. Jones S. Wood L.D. Parsons D.W. Lin J.

AMFR localizes to cell surface caveolae and internalizes AMF to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum via a dynamin-dependent, raft-mediated endocytic pathway negatively regulated by caveolin-1 (Cav1) (10Benlimame N.

Chem. 2002; 277: 3371-3379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Multiple raft-dependent pathways have been described that vary in their dependence on expression of Cav1 and dynamin-2 (13Kirkham M. Parton R.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1745: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 14Lajoie P. Nabi I.R. J. Cell Mol. Med. 2007; 11: 644-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The AMF pathway can be distinguished from the caveolae/raft-dependent endocytosis of SV40 virus to the endoplasmic reticulum (15Pelkmans L. Kartenbeck J. Helenius A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar) and of cholera toxin b-subunit to the Golgi apparatus by the insensitivity of its uptake to brefeldin A, nocodazole, and a 20 °C temperature block (11Le P.U. Nabi I.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1059-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Reduced expression of Cav1 upon transformation of NIH-3T3 cells with ras or abl oncogenes is associated with increased AMF uptake (12Le P.U. Guay G. Altschuler Y. Nabi I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3371-3379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Conversely, AMF transfection of NIH-3T3 cells induces enhanced transformation and survival via PI3K/Akt signaling and Cav1 down-regulation (16Tsutsumi S. Hogan V. Nabi I.R. Raz A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 242-249PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that AMF/AMFR expression and signaling are inversely related to Cav1 expression during tumor progression. However, AMF endocytosis in human tumor cells has yet to be studied, and factors that promote the raft-dependent endocytosis of AMF have not been identified. In this study, we show that AMF internalization is reduced in dysplastic MCF10A mammary cells relative to tumorigenic and metastatic tumor cell lines and that Cav1 is a critical regulator of the raft-dependent endocytosis of AMF in breast carcinoma cells. Tissue microarray analysis (TMA) of AMFR expression identified a highly significant association with p-Akt. AMF stimulates p-Akt expression, and PI3K inhibition prevents raft-dependent AMF uptake in breast carcinoma cells. PI3K is therefore identified as a positive regulator of the AMF raft pathway, indicative of a feedback loop linking AMFR signaling through PI3K to AMF uptake. Cells, Antibodies, and Reagents—MCF7, MDA-231, MDA-435, and MCF10A human breast cell lines (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in complete RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS.

Statistical significance was evaluated using the Student's t test for paired comparison; p < 0.05 was considered significant. Human Breast Tissue Microarrays— 438 sequential archival cases of invasive breast carcinoma, with available paraffin blocks, that had undergone treatment at Vancouver General Hospital between 1974 and 1995 were identified for TMA construction (21Parker R.L.

AMFR was scored positive (1+) if any invasive carcinoma cell staining was observed. For statistical analyses, score data were binarized using ≥10% cutoffs for ER and PR and a score of 1+ for AMFR and 2+ (equivalent to strong 3+ staining when utilizing the Herceptest) for HER2. TMA slides were digitized using a BLISS slide scanner (Bacus Laboratories, Inc., Chicago) and connected to a relational data base. They are publicly available on line. All samples were evaluated and scored, from scanned images on a computer monitor, by two pathologists blinded to patient clinical data. Clinical data on all patients was retrospectively collected from patient hospital charts. Median patient follow-up was 15 years, and all patients had newly diagnosed stage I-III invasive breast cancer. Clinicopathologic data collected included patient age and sex, lymph node status (negative versus positive), tumor size, tumor grade, tumor histology, patient follow-up, and survival. All data were logged onto a standardized score sheet matching each TMA section (Microsoft Excel, Redmond, WA), processed utilizing TMA-Deconvoluter 1.07 software (25Liu C.L. Prapong W. Natkunam Y.

Correlation analysis used the bivariate two-tailed Spearman nonparametric correlation test. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. The Kaplan-Meier method was utilized for survival analysis with log rank test to determine significance in survival differences. For the multivariate analysis, we used a proportional hazards model (Cox regression model). AMFR Expression and Internalization in Human Mammary Cell Lines—AMFR transcript and protein levels were significantly increased in MCF7, MDA-231, and MDA-435 breast cancer cell lines relative to dysplastic epithelial MCF10A cells (Fig. 1A). Protein, but not transcript, levels of AMFR were increased in MCF7 cells relative to metastatic MDA-231 and MDA-435 cells. By Western blot, AMFR was detected in both Nonidet P-40 soluble and insoluble fractions and Cav1 predominantly in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 1B). Cav1 levels were highest in MDA-231 cells, lesser in MDA-435 cells, and barely detectable in MCF10A and MCF7 cells (Fig. 1B). Higher expression of Cav1 in MDA-231 cells was associated with a significantly increased number of caveolae (Fig. 1C). FACS analysis showed that fewer dysplastic MCF10A cells were positive for surface AMFR expression relative to the three cancer cell lines; metastatic MDA-435 and MDA-231 presented 2-3-fold increased mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for surface AMFR expression relative to MCF7 and dysplastic MCF10A cell lines (Fig. 2A). Cell surface binding of anti-AMFR was efficiently competed by preincubation of the cells with AMF at 4 °C demonstrating, as reported previously (17Nabi I.R. Watanabe H. Raz A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 409-414PubMed Google Scholar), that the 3F3A anti-AMFR antibody is specific for the AMF receptor (Fig. 2B). When incubated with cells for 30 min at 37 °C, AMF-FITC showed increased association with MDA-435 cells relative to the other breast cell lines by FACS (Fig. 2C). Upon removal of cell surface-bound AMF-FITC by Pronase, MDA-435 cells showed significant uptake of AMF-FITC both in terms of positive cell number and MFI. AMF-FITC uptake was significantly increased in MCF7 relative to MCF10A and MDA-231 cells but reduced relative to MDA-435 cells. Regulation of AMFR Uptake by Cav1 in Breast Cancer Cells— Internalization of AMF-FITC to the anti-AMFR-labeled smooth endoplasmic reticulum is inhibited by cholesterol extraction with mβCD and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (Fig. 3A). FACS analysis confirmed that these inhibitors of caveolae/raft-dependent endocytosis inhibited AMF-FITC internalization without impacting on clathrin-dependent uptake of Tf-FITC (Fig. 3B). AMF uptake in these cell lines is receptor-mediated as a 10-fold excess of unlabeled AMF competed for AMF-FITC uptake (Fig. 3B). Neither mβCD nor genistein treatment impacted on cell surface AMFR expression (Fig. 3C). Adenoviral expression of Cav1 and mutant dynamin-1 K44A, but not clathrin hub or wild-type dynamin, significantly inhibited AMF-FITC uptake in MDA-435 cells without impacting cell surface AMFR expression (Fig. 4A). As a control, adenoviral expression of the clathrin hub and mutant dynamin-1 K44A, but not Cav1 or wild-type dynamin-1, was found to inhibit clathrin-dependent uptake of Tf-FITC (Fig. 4A). Conversely, lentiviral infection of MDA-231 cells with Cav1 shRNA, reducing Cav1 levels by ∼80%, resulted in a 2-fold increase in AMF uptake (Fig. 4B). Cav1 expression therefore negatively regulates the clathrin-independent, dynamin-dependent, raft-dependent uptake of AMF in invasive breast cancer cells. Tissue Microarray Analysis of Invasive Human Breast Carcinomas—From TMA analysis (Fig. 5), 99 of 370 interpretable cases (27%) of invasive breast cancer expressed AMFR. Increased AMFR expression was not associated (p = 0.414) with disease-specific survival (Fig. 5C). No correlations were found between AMFR expression and tumor HER2, ER status, tumor size, or histologic grade. AMFR had a weak negative correlation with tumor PR status (p = 0.025) and axillary lymph node status (p = 0.015) (Fig. 5D). Interestingly, AMFR expression showed a highly significant correlation (p = 0.000065) with p-Akt, previously scored on the same breast cancer TMA (24Sutherland B.W. Kucab J. Wu J. Lee C. Cheang M.C.U. Yorida E. Turbin D. Dedhar S. Nelson C. Pollak M. Leighton Grimes H. Miller K. Badve S. Huntsman D. Blake-Gilks C. Chen M. Pallen C.J. Dunn S.E. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4281-4292Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Raft-dependent Endocytosis of AMF Is PI3K-dependent—The high degree of correlation of AMFR and p-Akt in the TMA analysis led us to assess p-Akt expression in the breast cancer cell lines. As seen in Fig. 6A, basal p-Akt levels are elevated in MCF7 and MDA-435 relative to MCF10A and MDA-231 cells. Furthermore, in MDA-435 cells, AMF induced Akt phosphorylation after 2 h (Fig. 6B), consistent with the up-regulation of p-Akt in stable AMF-transfected NIH-3T3 cells (16Tsutsumi S. Hogan V. Nabi I.R. Raz A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 242-249PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with genistein had no effect on pAkt phosphorylation in MDA-435 and MCF7 cells indicating that decrease of AMF uptake by genistein is not due to PI3K inhibition (Fig. 6C). Increased p-Akt expression corresponds to the increased AMF uptake detected in MDA-435 cells and, to a lesser extent, in MCF7 cells (Fig. 2). Pretreatment with the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, for 60 min inhibited Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 7A) and, when added prior to addition of AMF-FITC, significantly inhibited AMF uptake in MCF7 and MDA-435 cells (Fig. 7B). PI3K inhibition affected neither AMFR surface expression nor uptake of Tf-FITC (Fig. 7B). PI3K has been described as a regulator of macropinocytosis (26Amyere M. Payrastre B. Krause U. Smissen P.V.D. Veithen A. Courtoy P.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3453-3467Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 27Araki N. Hatae T. Furukawa A. Swanson J.A. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 28Zhou K. Pandol S. Bokoch G. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 283-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, AMF uptake was not affected by inhibitors of macropinocytosis such as amiloride or actin disruption with cytochalasin D nor stimulated by the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) (Fig. 7, C and D). AMFR expression was reduced in dysplastic MCF10A cells relative to breast cancer cell lines. AMFR is expressed both at the cell surface and within the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (29Goetz J.G. Nabi I.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 340: 370-373Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Reduced expression of AMFR by Western blot contrasted with its increased mRNA transcript and cell surface expression by FACS in metastatic MDA-231 and MDA-435 cells relative to the nonmetastatic MCF7 cells. AMFR is a critical ubiquitinprotein isopeptide ligase involved in ER-associated degradation and can target itself for degradation by the proteasome (30Fang S. Ferrone M. Yang C. Jensen J.P. Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14422-14427Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The role of the ER-associated degradation function of AMFR in tumor cells remains uncertain. However, our data suggest that the cell surface expression of AMFR is more closely associated with its role in metastasis. Uptake of exogenous AMF was detected selectively in tumorigenic MCF7 and metastatic MDA-435 breast tumor cells (31De Larco J.E. Wuertz B.R. Rosner K.A. Erickson S.A. Gamache D.E. Manivel J.C. Furcht L.T. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 639-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), consistent with increased AMFR internalization in Ras-transformed NIH-3T3 and metastatic B16-F1 melanoma cells (12Le P.U. Guay G. Altschuler Y. Nabi I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3371-3379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 32Watanabe H. Nabi I.R. Raz A. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2699-2705PubMed Google Scholar). In these, uptake of protease-sensitive AMF-FITC is clathrin-independent, dynamin-dependent, and cholesterol- and tyrosine kinase-sensitive. AMF uptake in these breast cancer cell lines therefore follows the same caveolae/raft-dependent pathway to the AMFR-positive smooth endoplasmic reticulum as reported previously in other cell types (10Benlimame N. Le P.U. Nabi I.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1773-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 12Le P.U. Guay G. Altschuler Y. Nabi I.R. J. Biol.

Reduced uptake of AMF in metastatic MDA-231 cells was associated with increased expression of Cav1. Cav1 overexpression and Cav1 shRNA in metastatic MDA-435 and MDA-231 cells, respectively, identifies Cav1 as a critical, negative regulator of AMF uptake in these invasive cancer cells. The high degree of correlation of AMFR and p-Akt (24Sutherland B.W. Kucab J. Wu J. Lee C. Cheang M.C.U. Yorida E. Turbin D. Dedhar S. Nelson C. Pollak M. Leighton Grimes H. Miller K. Badve S. Huntsman D. Blake-Gilks C. Chen M. Pallen C.J. Dunn S.E. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4281-4292Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) on the same breast tumor TMA (Fig. 5) led us to assess whether PI3K regulates AMF uptake. In MDA-435 cells, AMF induced Akt phosphorylation and PI3K regulated AMF uptake. In addition, p-Akt expression was higher in AMF internalizing MCF7 and MDA-435 cells but not in the poorly internalizing, Cav1 expressing MDA-231 cells (Fig. 6A). Multiple kinases have been shown to regulate caveolae-mediated SV40 uptake (34Pelkmans L. Fava E. Grabner H. Hannus M. Habermann B. Krausz E. Zerial M. Nature. 2005; 436: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), and the fact that genistein inhibits AMF uptake but does not affect Akt phosphorylation argues that other kinases are involved in the raft-dependent endocytosis of AMF. AMF stimulation of p-Akt phosphorylation in MDA-435 cells was detectable after only 2 h, far longer than the short (<5 min) time of AMF delivery to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (11Le P.U. Nabi I.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1059-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). It is therefore not clear whether AMF-dependent PI3K activation autoregulates its endocytosis or whether AMF uptake is required for its activation of PI3K. Multiple pathways of raft-dependent endocytosis have been described, including dynamin-dependent, caveolae/raft-mediated and dynamin-independent, noncaveolar pathways (13Kirkham M. Parton R.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1745: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 14Lajoie P. Nabi I.R. J. Cell Mol. Med. 2007; 11: 644-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The latter includes PI3K-, raft-dependent but dynamin-independent macropinocytosis (13Kirkham M. Parton R.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1745: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). However, inhibition of the protease-sensitive uptake of AMF by the dynamin 1 K44A mutant demonstrates that the dynamin sensitivity of AMF uptake occurs at the cell surface and not at a subsequent internal site. Furthermore, AMF uptake was not affected by regulators of macropinocytosis identifying the raft-dependent uptake of AMF as a distinct PI3K-dependent raft endocytic pathway. PI3K inhibitors have been shown to inhibit uptake of fluorescent sterol dyes by endothelial cells; however, whether this endocytic route corresponds to the AMF uptake pathway remains to be determined (35Niles W.D. Malik A.B. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 167: 85-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cholesterol could impact indirectly on macropinocytosis through modulation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate-dependent reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (13Kirkham M. Parton R.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1745: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 36Kwik J. Boyle S. Fooksman D. Margolis L. Sheetz M.P. Edidin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13964-13969Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). AMF uptake was not affected by disruption of the actin cytoskeleton with cytochalasin D in MDA-435 cells (Fig. 7) or MCF7 cells (data not shown). Actin cytoskeleton disruption is associated with increased mobility of Cav1 and caveolae-mediated uptake (37Conrad P.A. Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Anderson R.G.W. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1421-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 38Parton R.G. Joggerst B. Simons K. J.

The independence of AMF uptake on actin cytoskeleton integrity further distinguishes this pathway from caveolae-mediated endocytosis. We have shown previously that AMF uptake to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum is distinct from raft-dependent cholera toxin b-subunit uptake to the Golgi apparatus and SV40 uptake to the endoplasmic reticulum (11Le P.U. Nabi I.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1059-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The PI3K dependence and actin independence of AMF internalization provide further evidence for the distinct nature of this dynamin-dependent, raft-dependent pathway. Of particular importance, this pathway is shown here to be tumor cell-specific and associated with enhanced AMFR expression in aggressive tumor cells. AMF-dependent p-Akt activation in MDA-435 cells and PI3K-dependent AMF uptake is indicative of a feedback loop between these two cancer-related proteins functionally linking the extensive correlation of AMFR and p-Akt in the breast tumor TMA. Stable transfection of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts with AMF, resulting in autocrine activation of AMFR, neoplastic transformation, and resistance to apoptosis, was found to be associated with Akt activation and reduced Cav1 expression (16Tsutsumi S. Hogan V. Nabi I.R. Raz A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 242-249PubMed Google Scholar). Autocrine activation of AMFR and downstream PI3K signaling in tumor cells may function to generally enhance AMFR trafficking and plasma membrane turnover. Akt activation is generally associated with increased tumor progression and tumor cell invasivity (42Nicholson K.M. Anderson N.G. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 381-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar) and is an indicator of aggressive tumor behavior and reduced overall survival in node-negative breast cancer (43Schmitz K.J. Otterbach F. Callies R. Levkau B. Holscher M. Hoffmann O. Grabellus F. Kimmig R. Schmid K.W. Baba H.A. Mod. Pathol. 2004; 17: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Overall AMFR positivity in breast carcinomas did not correlate with patient disease-specific survival, as reported for p-Akt labeling of the same TMA (24Sutherland B.W. Kucab J. Wu J. Lee C. Cheang M.C.U. Yorida E. Turbin D. Dedhar S. Nelson C. Pollak M. Leighton Grimes H. Miller K. Badve S. Huntsman D. Blake-Gilks C. Chen M. Pallen C.J. Dunn S.E. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4281-4292Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). This is consistent with a recent study of AMF and AMFR expression in breast tumors (44Jiang W.G. Raz A. Douglas-Jones A. Mansel R.E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2006; 54: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Coordinate overexpression of AMFR and p-Akt may define a cohort of human breast cancers that, although not the most clinically aggressive, does represent a significant proportion of all invasive tumors. Although factors other than Cav1 and p-Akt may regulate AMF uptake, our data suggest that internalization of cell surface AMFR may be associated with PI3K-dependent activation of Akt and reduction of Cav1 levels in breast tumor cells. In our invasive breast cancer patient cohort, AMFR tumor expression showed no significant correlation with ER or HER2 expression, but it did present a negative correlation with PR expression. Thus, individuals with breast tumors expressing AMFR may represent a specific subset of patients with breast cancer who may have little benefit from HER2 targeted or hormonal therapies. The abundant expression of AMFR by cancer cells in vitro and in vivo suggests that the dynamin and PI3K-dependent, Cav1-regulated, raft-mediated endocytosis of AMF may represent a cancer cell-specific endocytic pathway.

The increased enzyme activity is the result of an increase in gene transcription, mRNA translation, and protein stability. Induction of SSAT by polyamine analogues can lead to intracellular polyamine depletion and apoptosis. The mechanism by which polyamines alter the translational efficiency of SSAT mRNA is not well understood. In this study, we investigated the regulation of SSAT translation by the polyamine analogue N1,N11-diethylnorspermine (DENSPM). DENSPM induced expression of both FLAG-tagged SSAT and SSAT fused to Renilla luciferase in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. This effect was not inhibited by actinomycin D indicating that changes in gene transcription did not explain the enhanced expression in the presence of DENSPM. Furthermore, because FLAG-SSAT did not contain the 5′- or 3′-untranslated regions of SSAT, translational regulation involved the coding sequence only. By contrast, cycloheximide completely inhibited induction by DENSPM, indicating a requirement for new protein synthesis. Deletion constructs identified two regions of the SSAT protein-coding RNA sequence that conferred polyamine responsiveness. Using these regions as probes in RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we observed specific binding of a cytoplasmic protein. In addition, we found that the interaction between the RNA probes and the binding protein could be inhibited by DENSPM in a concentration-dependent manner. These results suggest that polyamines regulate SSAT mRNA translational efficiency by inhibiting a repressor protein from binding to regions of the coding sequence of the SSAT transcript.

Normally, the intracellular level of SSAT is low, but it can be rapidly induced by elevating intracellular polyamine concentrations (3Fogel-Petrovic M. Vujcic S. Brown P.J. Haddox M.K. Porter C.W.

Moreover, polyamines stabilize SSAT mRNA (6Fogel-Petrovic M. Shappell N.W. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. J. Biol.

Finally, elevated polyamine levels can lead to a stabilization of the SSAT protein by inhibiting its polyubiquitination and targeting to the proteasome (8Coleman C.S. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). N-terminal substituted polyamine analogues are not substrates for SSAT but appear to mimic the endogenous polyamine and cause an increase in intracellular SSAT activity that can be >1000-fold higher than that in untreated cells. The elevation in SSAT levels leads to a depletion of intracellular polyamines and induction of apoptosis (4Kramer D.L. Vujcic S. Diegelman P. White C. Black J.D. Porter C.W. Biochem. Soc.

The regulation of SSAT mRNA translation by polyamines is not fully understood. Fogel-Petrovic and coworkers (11Fogel-Petrovic M. Vujcic S. Miller J. Porter C.W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) showed that cycloheximide can increase SSAT mRNA in Malme-3 M cells, but removal of the protein synthesis inhibitor was not accompanied by an increase in enzyme activity. However, addition of polyamines led to an increased rate of SSAT translation, suggesting that protein synthesis required polyamines. Similarly, Parry and coworkers (5Parry L. Balana Fouce R. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) reported that N1,N12-bis(ethyl)spermine increased the amount of SSAT mRNA associated with the protein-synthesizing 80 S monosomes. They also concluded from deletion studies of an SSAT expression construct that the region of the mRNA responsive to N1,N12-bis(ethyl)spermine was located within the protein coding sequence. Thus, SSAT translation appears to be inhibited at low polyamine concentration, and this inhibition is released when polyamine levels are increased. SSAT activity is induced by a number of physiological stimuli, including oxidative stress (12Chopra S. Wallace H.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1119-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), x-ray irradiation (13Mita K. Fukuchi K. Hamana K. Ichimura S. Nenoi M. Int. J. Radiat.

J. 1993; 294: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Some of these stimuli do not appear to alter mRNA levels, suggesting that co- and/or post-translational mechanisms predominate. In the present study, we have investigated the translational regulation of the SSAT mRNA by DENSPM using two models, FLAG-tagged SSAT and SSAT fused to luciferase. Sequences located within the protein-coding region, and in close proximity to both the start and stop codons, are essential for the translational induction of SSAT transcript. We provide evidence for the binding of a cytosolic protein to the SSAT mRNA that can be displaced by DENSPM. Cloning of SSAT 5′-UTR and Coding Region—The SSAT 5′-UTR and various lengths of the coding sequence were cloned upstream and in-frame with the Renilla luciferase gene located in the XhoI/XbaI sites of pcDNA3.1 (rLuc). Initially, the SSAT 5′-UTR and the entire coding region except the terminal lysine and stop codon were amplified from a human breast cancer cDNA library (Prof. Peter Leedman, Western Australian Institute for Medical Research) using primers F1 and R1 (see supplemental Table S1 for oligonucleotides used in this study) and cloned into the NheI and BamHI sites of the vector pGL3 (Promega, Madison, WI). It was then removed by digestion with KpnI/BamHI and cloned into the same sites in rLuc such that the SSAT and luciferase sequences were in-frame to generate rLucSSAT510. Deletions of the coding region were achieved by amplifying SSAT using a common forward primer F2 and different reverse primers (R2, R3, R4, and R5), which were designed to generate products that contained the entire 5′-UTR only or together with 333, 166, or 68 bases of the coding region, respectively. The resulting constructs were named rLucSSATUTR, rLucSSAT333, rLucSSAT166, and rLucSSAT68 (shown in Fig. 1B). To make FLAG-tagged constructs, the coding region of SSAT was amplified using rLucSSAT510 as template and primers F3 and R6. Reverse primer R6 added the terminal lysine and stop codon missing from rLucSSAT510. The entire SSAT coding region was cloned into the HindIII and BamHI sites of p3XFLAG-CMV-7.1 expression vector (Sigma) yielding FLAG-SSAT513. A series of 3′ deletion constructs was made using the common forward primer F3 and various reverse primers (R7, R8, R9, and R10), which produced products containing the first 504, 498, 482, or 486 bases of the SSAT coding region, respectively. These constructs were named FLAG-SSAT504, FLAG-SSAT498, FLAG-SSAT492, and FLAG-SSAT486. A series of 5′ deletion constructs was made using various forward primers (F4, F5, and F6) with the common reverse primer R6, which produced products missing the first 15, 30, or 45 bases of the coding region, respectively. These constructs were named FLAG-SSAT15–513, FLAG-SSAT30–513, and FLAG-SSAT45–513. In addition, FLAG-tagged SSAT constructs were made that contained premature stop codons or base mutations. The primers used to make these constructs are shown in supplemental Table S1, and the location of premature stop codons and base mutations are shown in Fig. 5B. Constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Transient Transfections—HeLa (human cervical adenocarcinoma) cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. For luciferase studies, cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/well (24-well plate) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Cells were cotransfected in the absence of fetal bovine serum with 1 μg of rLucSSAT plasmid and 0.1 μg of the internal control plasmid pGL3-basic (Promega) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h, cells were treated with up to 100 μm DENSPM (a kind gift from Dr. Carl Porter, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo) for a further 24 h. Cells were then washed and assayed for luciferase activity using a Dual Luciferase Kit (Promega). For FLAG studies, cells were seeded and transfected as above with 1 μg of FLAG-SSAT plasmids, unless stated otherwise. Following transfection, cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C, and then treated with 10 μm DENSPM or vehicle for 4 h. In some experiments, cells were treated with actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) or cycloheximide (10 μg/ml). Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by scraping into 0.4 ml of 20 mm Tris/1 mm EDTA buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. Cells were then disrupted on ice by sonication, and the supernatants were cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 × g (4 °C). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad), and equal amounts (10 μg) of each sample were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted using anti-FLAG-M2 HRP monoclonal antibody (Sigma). MG132 Treatment and Immunoprecipitation—HeLa cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well (6-well plate) and co-transfected with 1 μg of pcDNA3-HA-ubiquitin and 2 μg of either FLAG-SSAT513 or FLAG-SSAT504 plasmid. After an overnight incubation, cells were co-treated with 10 μm DENSPM and 5 μm MG132 (Calbiochem) or vehicle (Me2SO) and incubated for a further 16 h. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by scraping into 0.8 ml of 20 mm Tris/1 mm EDTA buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. Cells were then disrupted on ice by sonication, and the supernatants were cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 × g (4 °C). Anti-FLAG-M2 monoclonal antibody (10 μg, F 3165, Sigma) was added, and the supernatants were rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose 4B (P 3296, Sigma) was then added, and the lysates were rotated for a further 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation, and the beads were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The recovered proteins were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted using anti-HA antibody (H 6908, Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA Extraction, Reverse Transcription, and Real-time PCR—For RNA studies, HeLa cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/well (6-well plate) and transfected with 2.5 μg of FLAG-SSAT513 plasmid. Cells were then incubated for 4 h in the absence or presence of 10 μm DENSPM, and total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as outlined in the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Reactions lacking reverse transcriptase also were performed to ensure no plasmid DNA contamination. Expression levels of FLAG-SSAT mRNA were quantified using the iCycler iQ Real-time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). First strand cDNA was amplified using specific primers for FLAG-SSAT (F10 and R7) or β-actin (F11 and R21). Reactions contained iQ Supermix (Bio-Rad), 6 pmol of each primer, and 1 μl of cDNA in a final volume of 25 μl. Samples were amplified using the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing at 50 °C for 15 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. A melting curve was obtained to verify specificity of the PCR. Samples were analyzed by the comparative CT method. In Vitro Transcription/Translation—Reaction mixtures contained 1 μg of rLucSSAT510 DNA and 40 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System, Promega), in a total volume of 50 μl. Initially, reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in the absence of methionine to synthesize transcript. Then, actinomycin D was added to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml to stop the transcription. Reactions were divided into two aliquots containing equal amounts of mRNA, and DENSPM (50 μm) or an equal volume of vehicle was added to each aliquot. The paired reactions were prewarmed, and protein synthesis was initiated by the addition of 20 μm methionine. Aliquots (5 μl) were removed at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min and boiled immediately in Laemmli buffer. Samples were then separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, immunoblotted using anti-Renilla luciferase monoclonal antibody (MAB4410, Chemicon), and quantified by densitometry (Quantity One software, Bio-Rad). Preparation of Cytoplasmic Extracts—HeLa cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into cytoplasmic extraction buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 3 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cell extracts were incubated on ice for 20 min and then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was retained. Extract was used immediately or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until required. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Preparation of RNA Transcripts—Fragments of the SSAT 5′ coding region were amplified by PCR using rlucSSAT510 as template and the common forward primer F7 and the reverse primers R16, R17, and R18. PCR products were digested with BamHI and HindIII and cloned into the same sites of pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene) in the T7 sense orientation, giving the constructs P1–42, P1–77, and P1–165, where the number indicates the number of bases of the SSAT insert (beginning at the start codon). Fragments of the SSAT 3′ coding region were also amplified using the common reverse primer R19 and the forward primers F8 and F9, giving the constructs P433–513 and P333–513. P333–492 was made using forward primer F9 and reverse primer R20. All constructs were then linearized with HindIII and used as templates in in vitro transcription reactions. Linearized templates were transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase (Invitrogen) in reactions containing [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol, GE Healthcare) as described elsewhere (17Thomson A.M. Rogers J.T. Walker C.E. Staton J.M. Leedman P.J. BioTechniques. 1999; 27: 1032-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Full-length transcripts were isolated on 6% urea/acrylamide gels, eluted for 3 h at 22 °C in 0.5 m ammonium acetate/1 mm EDTA, and ethanol-precipitated to recover the RNA. Unlabeled RNA transcripts were synthesized as above but with 2.5 mm UTP. REMSAs—Binding reactions (10 μl) contained 10 μg of HeLa cytoplasmic extract and 100,000 cpm of 32P-Riboprobe (P1–42, P1–77, P1–165, or P333–513) and were performed as described elsewhere (17Thomson A.M. Rogers J.T. Walker C.E. Staton J.M. Leedman P.J. BioTechniques. 1999; 27: 1032-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions were incubated for 30 min at 22 °C, 0.3 unit of RNase T1 (Roche Applied Science) was added for 10 min, and the followed by heparin (Sigma, final concentration of 5 μg/μl unless stated otherwise) for 10 min. Samples were then electrophoresed on 5% native acrylamide gels, dried, and analyzed with a Personal Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad). In some assays, cell extracts were preincubated for 10 min at 22 °C with nonspecific or specific competitor unlabeled RNA (∼100× molar excess) or with DENSPM (0–50 μm). SSAT-luciferase Fusion Protein Is Induced by DENSPM—To determine whether SSAT fused to a reporter protein was inducible by DENSPM treatment, human cervical HeLa cells were transfected with rLucSSAT510 and then treated with increasing concentrations of drug. The SSAT-luciferase fusion protein showed almost a 10-fold increase in expression, with an EC50 of 2.7 ± 0.4 μm (Fig. 1A). A series of SSAT ORF deletion reporter constructs was generated (Fig. 1B) in an attempt to locate the region of SSAT that was responsive to DENSPM. The basal expression levels of the longer fusion proteins rLucSSAT333 and rLucSSAT166 were not different from rLucSSAT510, whereas those of rLucSSAT68 and rLucSSATUTR were significantly greater than rLucSSAT510 (Fig. 1C). The observed differences in basal expression levels were a result of differing fusion protein half-lives (Table 1). None of the C-terminal rLucSSAT deletion proteins were induced by DENSPM, including the control rLuc vector (Fig. 1C). Similar results were obtained using the human melanoma cell line MM2058 (data not shown). These results suggest that the induction of SSAT is dependent on the presence of the 3′ third of the coding region. To investigate the effect of DENSPM on the stability of SSAT-luciferase proteins, the inducible rLucSSAT510 and the non-inducible rLucSSAT333 proteins were treated with cycloheximide, and their half-lives were determined in the absence or presence of DENSPM. DENSPM had no significant effect on the half-life of either fusion protein (Table 1).TABLE 1Stability of SSAT-luciferase fusion proteins in HeLa cellsConstructsFusion protein half-life-DENSPM+DENSPMh (mean ± S.E.)rLuc-SSAT5101.17 ± 0.041.29 ± 0.14rLuc-SSAT3331.29 ± 0.111.31 ± 0.12rLuc-SSAT1661.12 ± 0.10NDaND, not determinedrLuc-SSAT681.91 ± 0.10NDrLuc-SSATUTR3.46 ± 0.11NDrLuc2.34 ± 0.19NDa ND, not determined Open table in a new tab DENSPM Enhances the Translation of SSAT-luciferase Fusion Protein in Vitro—The effect of DENSPM on the translation of rLucSSAT510 was investigated using an in vitro transcription/translation system. First, mRNA was synthesized from rLucSSAT510 plasmid in a reaction containing rabbit reticulocyte lysate, but lacking methionine. Actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) was added to stop the transcription, and the reaction was then divided into two equal aliquots, one treated with 50 μm DENSPM and the other with an equal volume of vehicle. Protein synthesis was initiated by the addition of methionine and the rate of protein synthesis measured over 30 min. Aliquots taken from each paired reaction at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min were boiled immediately in Laemmli buffer and subjected to Western blot using an anti-Renilla luciferase antibody. The blots were quantified by densitometry, and the slope of the linear part of the curves was used to measure the rate of rLucSSAT protein synthesis (Fig. 2). The rate of protein synthesis in the presence of DENSPM was significantly greater than that in its absence (74.4 ± 3.4 and 19.8 ± 2.1 density units/min, respectively). Induction of FLAG-tagged SSAT by DENSPM Is via Translational Regulation—An inherent problem with the luciferase fusion proteins used in the first part of this study is the possibility of direct interference with the luciferase enzyme activity by the attached SSAT fragments. For that reason, FLAG-tagged SSAT was used as a model for the remainder of the study, and protein levels rather than enzyme activities were measured. Full-length SSAT was cloned into a FLAG vector (FLAG-SSAT513) and expressed in HeLa cells to investigate the mechanism by which DENSPM induces SSAT expression. In the absence of DENSPM treatment, no FLAG-SSAT protein was detectable by Western blot using an anti-FLAG HRP antibody (Fig. 3A). Upon DENSPM (10 μm) treatment there was a time-dependent increase in FLAG-SSAT protein production, with near maximal levels occurring by 8 h (Fig. 3A). To determine whether the induction of FLAG-SSAT required new mRNA synthesis, cells were treated with actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) for 10 min, and then with 10 μm DENSPM for 4 h. Induction of FLAG-SSAT by DENSPM was not affected by the presence of actinomycin D (Fig. 3B). By contrast, when cells were treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) and DENSPM, induction was completely abolished (Fig. 3B). To determine if FLAG-SSAT mRNA was present in the absence of DENSPM, total RNA was extracted from control cells and cells that had been treated with 10 μm DENSPM for 4 h. Following reverse transcription, specific primers were used to quantify FLAG-SSAT transcript levels by real-time PCR. Transcript levels were not increased in the presence of DENSPM (Fig. 3C). In fact, transcript levels were reduced in the presence of DENSPM, which is consistent with increased translation and translation-dependent mRNA degradation (18Wilson T. Treisman R. Nature. 1988; 336: 396-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). A previous study by Parry and coworkers (5Parry L. Balana Fouce R. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) also observed a decrease in SSAT mRNA levels following polyamine analogue treatment. This indicates that expression of FLAG-SSAT mRNA has little effect on SSAT protein levels. Combined, these results indicate that translation of FLAG-SSAT mRNA is blocked in the absence of DENSPM. In addition, because the SSAT 5′- and 3′-UTRs were not present in the plasmid, the translational control of SSAT by DENSPM is mediated by the protein coding region, which is in agreement with a previous study (5Parry L. Balana Fouce R. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Induction of FLAG-SSAT by DENSPM Is Not Due to Protein Stabilization—SSAT is degraded via the ubiquitin/26 S proteasome pathway (19Coleman C.S. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12164-12169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and it has been demonstrated that the C-terminal MATEE amino acid motif plays a critical role in polyamine-mediated stabilization of the protein (20Coleman C.S. Huang H. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13423-13430Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As a result, the lack of FLAG-SSAT protein detected in cells not treated with DENSPM may be due to rapid turnover of the protein. To address this possibility, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with plasmid containing either full-length SSAT (FLAG-SSAT513) or a truncated construct (FLAG-SSAT504), which produces a protein that is reported to be stabilized in the absence of polyamine analogue (19Coleman C.S. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12164-12169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cells were then treated with 10 μm DENSPM in the absence or presence of the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (20 μm). In cells not treated with DENSPM or MG132, no expression of either FLAG-SSAT513 or FLAG-SSAT504 was observed (Fig. 4A). When MG132 was added, a small amount of FLAG513 was observed in the absence of DENSPM. This low level of translation may be due to the presence of endogenous polyamines. In addition, no polyubiquitinated products were observed in lysates from cells treated with MG132 in the absence of DENSPM (Fig. 4B). These data indicate that the lack of FLAG-SSAT protein observed in the absence of DENSPM was not because of rapid protein degradation. Sequences Essential for DENSPM Induction of SSAT Are Located Both at the 5′- and 3′-Ends of the mRNA—To identify the region of the SSAT mRNA involved in SSAT translational induction, we constructed a series of FLAG-SSAT deletion mutants and determined the effect of DENSPM in transiently transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 5A). Because SSAT-luciferase fusion protein studies indicated that the 3′ third of the ORF was important, initial deletions were of this region. The FLAG-SSAT504 deletion had the same inducibility as full-length FLAG-SSAT513 (Fig. 5A). The next shortest construct, FLAG-SSAT498, was DENSPM-responsive but showed some leakiness with a small amount of FLAG-SSAT protein being produced in the absence of DENSPM. The FLAG-SSAT492 and FLAG-SSAT486 constructs were not inducible by DENSPM with similar amounts of FLAG-SSAT protein translated in the absence and presence of DENSPM (Fig. 5A). These results suggest that the coding sequence located between bases 492 and 504, relative to the SSAT start codon, serves to repress translation in the absence of DENSPM. Deletions also were performed on the 5′-end of the SSAT ORF. FLAG-SSAT15–513 and FLAG-SSAT30–513 constructs were inducible by DENSPM, but showed some leakiness with a small amount of FLAG-SSAT protein being translated in the absence of DENSPM (Fig. 5A). The FLAG-SSAT45–513 construct was not responsive to DENSPM, and there were similar levels of protein translated in the absence and presence of DENSPM (Fig. 5A). These results show that the first 45 bases of the SSAT coding region as well as the bases between 492 and 504 are required for DENSPM responsiveness. Functional mRNA instability elements have been detected within the coding regions of several mRNAs (21Tierney M.J. Medcalf R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13675-13684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The bases located between 492 and 504 of the SSAT coding region bear resemblance to an mRNA instability element identified in plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 as well as in five other mRNAs (21Tierney M.J. Medcalf R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13675-13684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2089687879,"MICA is a major histocompatibility complex-like protein that undergoes a structural transition from disorder to order upon binding its immunoreceptor, NKG2D. We redesigned the disordered region of MICA with RosettaDesign to increase NKG2D binding. Mutations that stabilize this region were expected to increase association kinetics without changing dissociation kinetics, increase affinity of interaction, and reduce entropy loss upon binding. MICA mutants were stable in solution, and they were amenable to surface plasmon resonance evaluation of NKG2D binding kinetics and thermodynamics. Several MICA mutants bound NKG2D with enhanced affinity, kinetic changes were primarily observed during association, and thermodynamic changes in entropy were as expected. However, none of the 15 combinations of mutations predicted to stabilize the receptor-bound MICA conformation enhanced NKG2D affinity, whereas all 10 mutants predicted to be destabilized bound NKG2D with increased on-rates. Five of these had affinities enhanced by 0.9–1.8 kcal/mol over wild type by one to three non-contacting substitutions. Therefore, in this case, mutations designed to mildly destabilize a protein enhanced association and affinity.

NKG2D-ligand interactions play a central role in inducible NK cell and γδ T cell activation, initiating cytotoxic responses to transformation and infection (1Bauer S. Groh V. Wu J. Steinle A.

All known NKG2D-binding proteins use a major histocompatibility complex platform-like tertiary structure as a scaffold to contact NKG2D, including two binding surface α helices (α1 and α2). In the crystal structure of the NKG2D ligand MICA, electron density was absent for a central portion of the α2 helix (residues 152–161), indicating that the helix in that region was disordered into a flexible loop (4Li P. Willie S.T. Bauer S. Morris D.L. Spies T. Strong R.K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 577-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). When bound to NKG2D, the residues were ordered beneath the receptor (5Li P. Morris D.L. Willcox B.E. Steinle A. Spies T. Strong R.K. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). This type of transition from disorder to order upon binding is similar to other immunoreceptor-ligand combinations (6Dyson H.J.

The thermodynamics of four NKG2D-ligand interactions were compared and found to be driven by both enthalpy and entropy, distinct from the generally enthalpy-driven, entropy-hindered T-cell receptor-major histocompatibility complex interactions (10McFarland B.J. Strong R.K. Immunity. 2003; 19: 803-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The structural characterization of NKG2D-ligand interfaces allows computational optimization of the interactions. Algorithms for computational design of proteins have already been used for energetic dissection of NKG2D-ligand interactions, confirmed by experiment (11McFarland B.J. Kortemme T. Yu S.F. Baker D. Strong R.K. Structure. 2003; 11: 411-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Different rational design techniques applied to LFA-1 with ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) (12Song G. Lazar G.A. Kortemme T. Shimaoka M. Desjarlais J.R. Baker D. Springer T.A. J. Biol.

Hanf K.J. Jarpe M. Liparoto S.F. Li Y. Lugovskoy A. Miller S. Rushe M. Sherman W. Simon K. Van Vlijmen H. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 949-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), for example, have engineered interfaces toward increased affinities. We applied rational design to the MICA-NKG2D interface by attempting to stabilize MICA in its receptor-bound conformation. Loss of configurational freedom for the MICA α2 loop should pose an entropic barrier to MICA-NKG2D association, assuming protein entropy dominates. Using RosettaDesign, we used a two-stage design strategy to stabilize this region of MICA with the goal of reducing the entropic barrier to protein-protein association, altering MICA minimally to maintain global protein stability and retain most NKG2D contacts. We predicted that successful redesign would alter only the association rate, leaving dissociation kinetics unchanged, and would therefore increase affinity through a more favorable entropy of interaction. To test this, we created 25 mutant MICA molecules that were amenable to thermodynamic binding analysis. As expected, many mutants bound NKG2D significantly faster than wild-type but dissociated at a similar rate, and hence had increased affinity for NKG2D. Van't Hoff thermodynamics were also consistent with our hypothesis, but entropic stabilization was compensated with enthalpic destabilization. Surprisingly, the design scores for the tight-binding MICA mutants were worse than for wild type; for these mutants, RosettaDesign predicts mild destabilization of the receptor-bound MICA conformation. Computational Protein Design—Computational protein design methods seek to identify low energy sequences compatible with a given protein structure or function. Here we aimed to stabilize MICA in its bound conformation, as observed in the MICA-NKG2D structure. We first identified eight sequence positions on MICA for redesign (see “Results”). At each of these positions we sampled rotameric conformations of 19 naturally occurring amino acids (except cysteine) during the design simulations. Sequences and side-chain conformations were optimized for the bound MICA backbone using Monte-Carlo simulated annealing and a scoring function dominated by Lennard-Jones atomic packing interactions, hydrogen bonding, and an implicit solvation model, as previously described (14Kortemme T. Morozov A.V. Baker D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 1239-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). We collected 500 low energy sequences from the design simulations and used the most frequently observed amino acids at each position in this set to compile a computational library (Table 1). We also included the wild-type amino acid at each position, yielding a total of 4608 sequence combinations. We then built models for all sequence combinations in this library, where the MICA backbone was held fixed in the bound conformation observed in the MICA-NKG2D complex structure and the side-chain conformations of all designed residues were varied. All models were then ranked using the scoring function applied during design.TABLE 1Locations of designed residues in MICA and comparison to known allelic polymorphism MICB or other = residues appearing in other alleles of MICA or in MICB alleles as summarized previously (8Holmes M.A. Li P.

(Bacterial expression can be used because glycosylation of MICA does not affect NKG2D interaction (5Li P. Morris D.L. Willcox B.E. Steinle A. Spies T. Strong R.K. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar).) Cells were lysed mechanically using 1-mm glass beads (BeadBeater/BioSpec); 30-min incubations at room temperature with 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and 1 mg/ml DNase; and multiple freeze/thaw cycles and washes with 0.5% Triton X-100. (All chemicals were purchased from Sigma except where noted.) Inclusion bodies were collected by centrifugation and dissolved in 8 m urea/100 mm Tris/50 mm glycine, pH 8.0, placed in Snakeskin 10-kDa dialysis tubing (Pierce), and dialyzed using overnight steps into 2-liter solutions of 4 m, 2 m, 1 m, and 0 m urea, also containing 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0/400 mm l-arginine/0.5 mm EDTA/0.02% sodium azide. Protein was then dialyzed overnight into standard Qiagen nitrilotriacetic acid binding buffer (for MICA) or 10 mm phosphate, pH 8.0 (for NKG2D). Standard procedures for nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) or High-Q ion exchange (Bio-Rad) chromatography were used to purify MICA and NKG2D, respectively. The purity of each protein sample was confirmed to be >95% by SDS-PAGE. All proteins were purified by Superdex 200 size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) 2The abbreviations used are: SEC, size-exclusion chromatography; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry. within 72 h of use and showed no evidence of aggregation by additional analytical SEC within that time period with the exception of MICQ120I_K154M. After elution from the column, concentration was found by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce), as confirmed by Nanodrop UV-visible analysis. CD Analysis—Experiments were patterned after analysis of soluble major histocompatibility complex class I-peptide complexes (15Miley M.J. Messaoudi I. Metzner B.M. Wu Y. Nikolich-Zugich J. Fremont D.H. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 1445-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and redesigned small proteins (16Dantas G. Kuhlman B. Callender D. Wong M. Baker D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). 5–20 μm solutions of MICA proteins were dialyzed into 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. The ellipticity at 220 nm was measured with an Aviv 62A DS spectrometer from 20 to 98 °C with 1° steps (2-mm pathlength). Wild-type and mutant melts were irreversible. The melting temperature (Tm) was determined by fitting the data to a Gibbs-Helmholtz equation and normalizing to the parameters from the fit (16Dantas G. Kuhlman B. Callender D. Wong M. Baker D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Three wild-type melts produced Tm values within 1 °C, as did multiple melts for mutants. Fluorescence Quenching—Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was measured using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 55 fluorometer and ∼0.2 μm SEC-pure MICA samples in HBS-EA buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.02% sodium azide) in a 10-mm quartz cuvette, 280 nm excitation and 300–500 nm or 350 nm emission, with both slit widths at 10.0 nm. The sample was titrated with a 3 m acrylamide solution. Scans were repeated three times and averaged. Fluorescence readings of a blank HBS-EA sample were subtracted, and the readings were corrected for titrant dilution (never exceeding 10%). Each sample was also corrected for inner filter effects as described previously (17Calhoun D.B. Vanderkooi J.M. Englander S.W. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—A BIAcore 3000 surface plasmon resonance (SPR) instrument was equilibrated in HBS-EP buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.05% P-20, BIAcore AB). 0.05% P-20 was added to all protein samples. MICA proteins were coupled to research-grade CM5 chips using standard NHS-based amine-coupling chemistry (BIAcore AB). (NKG2D was inactive upon amine coupling, probably due to positively charged residues near the active site.) The first or third flow cells were subjected to the chemical steps of coupling to serve as an internal blank. Ligand coupling densities resulting in ∼50 maximum response units upon NKG2D injection were used for wild-type and most mutants; the same conditions resulted in surfaces for high affinity mutants where Rmax ∼100–300 response units. Coupling of lower or higher ligand densities did not change the kinetic constants measured within error. NKG2D was injected at 40 μl/min at 25 °C. Flow rates of 20–100 μl/min did not change NKG2D association or dissociation phases. For each experiment, 1–9 μm NKG2D samples serially diluted five to six times were injected, along with three buffer blanks. Each experiment was independently repeated three to five times with average buffer blank and flow cell blank-corrected values and standard errors reported. For equilibrium binding constants, the average responses from the last 5–15 s of NKG2D injection were fit to a steady-state binding model. For kinetic constants, the first 80 s of data collection after NKG2D injection within a set of 4–6 injections were globally fit to a standard 1:1 Langmuir binding model using BIAevaluation 3.0 software (BIAcore AB). For biphasic kinetics, the data show some slow (k+2, k-1 < 1 s-1) kinetic complexity and were globally fit to a standard two-step reaction (conformation change model) using BIAevaluation 3.0 software. Reaction 1 shows the simplest way to model a biphasic protein-protein interaction, A+Bk+1⇌k−1[AB]∗k+2⇌k−2ABREACTION 1 where A and B are the MICA variant and NKG2D, [AB]* is an intermediate encounter complex, and AB is the final, fully engaged protein complex. Reaction 1 is written in induced fit form, although the conformational change may either precede binding (pre-equilibrium) or coincide with binding (induced fit). As previously observed, wild-type MICA at high NKG2D concentrations shows some kinetic complexity too fast for SPR to detect (10McFarland B.J. Strong R.K. Immunity. 2003; 19: 803-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which also appears for mutant MICA with mutations predicted to stabilize the receptor-bound conformation (see Fig. 3D). These were fit as refractive index offsets within the Langmuir model, because no kinetic information could be derived. If the offset is removed, a poorer fit results, the change in ΔΔG is <10%, and the rank order of mutations is not changed, but increases relative standard errors, and the residuals of the equation fits increase systematically. At equilibrium, all kinetic phases contribute, and ΔΔGeq correlates with ΔΔGkin obs (see Fig. 3G). Several control experiments were used to confirm that none of the multiple kinetic phases observed in these sensorgrams could be caused by transiently formed aggregates or other impurities: 1) MICA mutants were specifically oriented on a chip by binding to an amine-coupled antibody specific for the α3 domain; 2) a lower ligand density of the MICA mutant was used (both amine-coupled and antibody-oriented); and 3) we injected samples of NKG2D that were not size-purified or were size-purified months before, containing more multimeric, aggregated forms of the receptor. In all cases, multiphasic kinetics were obtained that were identical within error to those obtained from the typical amine-coupled MICA mutant chip, showing that the fast on/off phases are not caused by weak, nonspecific association of aggregate. Therefore, the complex kinetics are not caused by nonspecific binding of trace amounts of multimeric forms of MICA (control #2) or NKG2D (control #3), or by heterogeneity in the amine coupling process (controls #1 and 2). In addition, sample homogeneity was assured, because proteins were prepared from inclusion bodies, no other proteins or forms of protein were detectable by SDS-PAGE or SEC, and all experimental samples were SEC-purified before use in quantitative SPR assays. Finally, k+2 was concentration-independent at high concentrations (see Fig. 3F), whereas weak, nonspecific binding would be concentration-dependent, increasing significantly at high receptor concentrations (18Li Y. Lipschultz C.A. Mohan S. Smith-Gill S.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2011-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Size-exclusion Binding Assay—10–20 μg of NKG2D and MICA proteins in the 1–5 μm range, either alone or mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio, were injected onto a 10/300 GL Superdex 200 FPLC column (General Electric Healthcare) equilibrated in HBS-EA buffer, and peaks were detected by absorbance at 280 nm. Columns were calibrated with protein standards (GE Healthcare). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—A MicroCal VP-ITC instrument was used with 9.3 μm human NKG2D in 1.4 ml of HBS-EA in the calorimetric cell. All solutions were size-exclusion-purified, concentrated, and degassed immediately before use. Aliquots (8 μl) of 110 μm MICN69W_K152E in HBS-EA were added stepwise to the stirred NKG2D solution with 240-s spacing. The heat evolved was calculated by fitting the data with Origin software. Two-stage Design of MICA Helix-Loop Stabilization—Disorder at the MICA-NKG2D binding interface was targeted for stabilization. Electron density corresponding to the α2 helix residues 152–161 does not appear in the crystal structure of MICA alone, but when NKG2D is bound, those residues are folded into two turns of a helix and a short loop (Fig. 1A). We designed mutations to stabilize the receptor-bound conformation of the α2 helix-loop by optimizing the α2 contacts with the rest of MICA in the receptor-bound conformation. Using the coordinates from the receptor-bound MICA structure as a design template, we selected residues as design targets in the region disordered in the unbound structure but away from the direct contact interface with NKG2D. This yielded four residues in the center of the α2 helix-loop, and four residues that interact with α2 residues: two from the α1 helix and two from the β sheet underneath (Fig. 1B). Only residue Thr-155 was observed contacting NKG2D in the crystal structure (5Li P. Morris D.L. Willcox B.E. Steinle A. Spies T. Strong R.K. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). We optimized MICA using a two-stage strategy: we first allowed non-cysteine amino acid residue substitutions at all selected positions simultaneously during RosettaDesign runs (see Methods), and we selected sequences predicted to stabilize MICA relative to wild-type in the backbone conformation found in the NKG2D-bound MICA structure. Simulations were performed using a Monte-Carlo simulated annealing procedure, and sequences were ranked by a scoring function dominated by Lennard-Jones atomic packing interactions, hydrogen bonding, and an implicit solvation model, as previously described (14Kortemme T. Morozov A.V. Baker D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 1239-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). In the second stage of design, we enumerated all combinations of amino acid changes frequently observed as stabilizing in design round one and ranked the resulting structures relative to wild-type (see Table 1 and “Experimental Procedures”). Accordingly, the second-stage “design space” was biased toward low-scoring sequences predicted to be more stable than wild type, but also contained some residue combinations predicted to be less stable than wild type (Fig. 1C). We constructed 25 MICA variants by site-directed mutagenesis to test variants with design scores both better and worse than wild type. Mutants are named by the positions at which they differ from wild type as MICmutant_mutant. All mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies, refolded by stepwise dialysis, and purified by nickel-affinity chromatography followed by preparative SEC. Characterization of Mutant MICA—Mutants were well behaved in several assays. All MICA mutants and wild type with the exception of MICQ120I_K154M eluted from SEC columns in sharp, ∼30-kDa peaks; CD spectra of MICA mutants (Fig. 2A) taken from 200 to 250 nm at 25 °C were similar to wild type; and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectra for mutants were coincident with the wild-type MICA spectrum (data not shown). The loss of ellipticity with increased temperature associated with unfolding was observed by CD at Tm = 47.5 °C for wild type. Ten representative mutants showed 50% loss of ellipticity at temperatures ranging from 33.0 °C for MICK152E_K154M to 54.6 °C for MICN69Q_D72F_Q108L_K152V_Y157L, or higher for MICN69Q_Q108L_Q120I_K154S_T155D, which did not exhibit an upper-baseline loss of signal even at 95 °C (Fig. 2A). Except for K152E_K154M, the nine mutants retained full ellipticity at physiological temperature. The transition measured by CD and the local stability of the α2 helix region are distinct phenomena that may not be related. The local secondary structure predicted to be influenced by the eight designed mutations consists of two α-helical turns and a loop. This is a fraction of the total secondary structure in MICA and is not necessarily part of the overall structural transition observed by CD. Six mutant Tm values are similar to wild type, melting within a 5° range. Of the four mutants with Tm values >5° from wild-type, the two predicted to be destabilized have lower Tm values, and the two predicted to be stabilized have higher Tm values. Some MICA mutants were predicted to be destabilized by tryptophans introduced at buried positions (N69W and D72W), which we probed with fluorescence quenching. Acrylamide quenches solvent-contacting tryptophan side chains but is too polar to penetrate into a folded protein (19Calhoun D.B. Vanderkooi J.M. Holtom G.R. Englander S.W. Proteins. 1986; 1: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). When titrated with acrylamide up to 300 mm, MICN69W_K152E and MICN69W_D72W_ K152E fluorescence at 350 nm decreased linearly, despite the buried nature of residues 69 and 72 (Fig. 2B). Acrylamide quenching of wild-type tryptophan fluorescence plateaued by 150 mm, so some tryptophan residues in wild type appear too buried for the acrylamide to contact. The predicted destabilization did not result in a loss of global thermal stability for the mutant with the greatest predicted destabilization, MICN69W_K152E (Fig. 2A), or loss of solution monodispersivity measured by SEC for any protein other than MICQ108I_K154M. Because these mutants maintain global structure according to SEC and CD, any structural disruption resulting in solvent exposure of the introduced tryptophans appears local. Equilibrium SPR Affinity of Mutant MICA for NKG2D—Mutant binding to NKG2D was assessed at equilibrium by SPR. Mutant MICA molecules and wild-type MICA were amine-coupled to sensor chips. NKG2D injections resulted in increased signal and a flat response corresponding to binding equilibrium within 60–75 s (Fig. 3, A and B). Plots of equilibrium response versus [NKG2D] gave affinities in terms of dissociation constants, KD eq, in the nanomolar to low micromolar range. Contrary to our original hypothesis, none of the 15 MICA mutants predicted to stabilize the receptor-bound conformation exhibited significantly increased affinity for NKG2D (defined as ΔΔGeq < -0.4 kcal mol-1, where ΔΔGeq = ΔGmutant eq - ΔGWT eq and ΔGeq = RT ln KD eq) (Table 2). However, 10 MICA mutants were predicted to destabilize the receptor-bound conformation, and five of these bound to NKG2D with ΔΔGeq ≤ -0.9 kcal mol-1 (Table 3). We confirmed these findings in solution with 1:1 molar injections of all MICA mutants and NKG2D through an analytical SEC column (20Steinle A. Li P. Morris D.L. Groh V. Lanier L.L. Strong R.K. Spies T. Immunogenetics. 2001; 53: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), after which the five destabilized/enhanced-affinity MICA mutants eluted as bound complexes with NKG2D at ∼60 kDa, whereas wild-type and stabilized mutants did not (data not shown).TABLE 2MICA mutants predicted to stabilize the receptor-bound conformation and fit with a monophasic kinetic model All thermodynamic values are given at 25 °C in kcal mol-1.

https://openalex.org/W2091539862,"We previously demonstrated that the N-terminal 1000 amino acid residues of human apolipoprotein (apo) B (designated apoB:1000) are competent to fold into a three-sided lipovitellin-like lipid binding cavity to form the apoB “lipid pocket” without a structural requirement for microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP). Our results established that this primordial apoB-containing particle is phospholipid-rich (Manchekar, M., Richardson, P. E., Forte, T. M., Datta, G., Segrest, J. P., and Dashti, N. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 39757-39766). In this study we have investigated the putative functional role of MTP in the initial lipidation of apoB:1000 in stable transformants of McA-RH7777 cells. Inhibition of MTP lipid transfer activity by 0.1 μm BMS-197636 and 5, 10, and 20 μm of BMS-200150 had no detectable effect on the synthesis, lipidation, and secretion of apoB:1000-containing particles. Under identical experimental conditions, the synthesis, lipidation, and secretion of endogenous apoB100-containing particles in HepG2 and parental untransfected McA-RH7777 cells were inhibited by 86-94%. BMS-200150 at 40 μm nearly abolished the secretion of endogenous apoB100-containing particles in HepG2 and parental McA-RH cells but caused only 15-20% inhibition in the secretion of apoB: 1000-containing particles. This modest decrease was attributable to the nonspecific effect of a high concentration of this compound on hepatic protein synthesis, as reflected in a similar (20-25%) reduction in albumin secretion. Suppression of MTP gene expression in stable transformants of McA-RH7777 cells by micro-interfering RNA led to 60-70% decrease in MTP mRNA and protein levels, but it had no detectable effect on the secretion of apoB:1000. Our results provide a compelling argument that the initial addition of phospholipids to apoB:1000 and initiation of apoB-containing lipoprotein assembly occur independently of MTP lipid transfer activity. We previously demonstrated that the N-terminal 1000 amino acid residues of human apolipoprotein (apo) B (designated apoB:1000) are competent to fold into a three-sided lipovitellin-like lipid binding cavity to form the apoB “lipid pocket” without a structural requirement for microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP). Our results established that this primordial apoB-containing particle is phospholipid-rich (Manchekar, M., Richardson, P. E., Forte, T. M., Datta, G., Segrest, J. P., and Dashti, N. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 39757-39766). In this study we have investigated the putative functional role of MTP in the initial lipidation of apoB:1000 in stable transformants of McA-RH7777 cells. Inhibition of MTP lipid transfer activity by 0.1 μm BMS-197636 and 5, 10, and 20 μm of BMS-200150 had no detectable effect on the synthesis, lipidation, and secretion of apoB:1000-containing particles. Under identical experimental conditions, the synthesis, lipidation, and secretion of endogenous apoB100-containing particles in HepG2 and parental untransfected McA-RH7777 cells were inhibited by 86-94%. BMS-200150 at 40 μm nearly abolished the secretion of endogenous apoB100-containing particles in HepG2 and parental McA-RH cells but caused only 15-20% inhibition in the secretion of apoB: 1000-containing particles. This modest decrease was attributable to the nonspecific effect of a high concentration of this compound on hepatic protein synthesis, as reflected in a similar (20-25%) reduction in albumin secretion. Suppression of MTP gene expression in stable transformants of McA-RH7777 cells by micro-interfering RNA led to 60-70% decrease in MTP mRNA and protein levels, but it had no detectable effect on the secretion of apoB:1000. Our results provide a compelling argument that the initial addition of phospholipids to apoB:1000 and initiation of apoB-containing lipoprotein assembly occur independently of MTP lipid transfer activity.

ApoB is a predominant protein component of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and intermediate density lipoproteins and is essentially the only apoprotein component of low density lipoproteins (LDL2) (3Knott T.J.

ApoB100 (the full-length protein) is one of the largest monomeric proteins known with 4536 amino acid residues (2Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17377-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). It is expressed primarily in mammalian liver, is an essential structural component for the formation and secretion of VLDL, and serves as a ligand for the LDL receptor (2Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17377-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). ApoB is present as a single molecule per lipoprotein particle (5Elovson J. Chatterton J.E. Bell G.T. Schumaker V.N. Reuben M.A. Puppione D.L. Reeve J.R. Young Jr., N.L. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1461-1473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and therefore, its concentration in the plasma approximates the number of potential atherogenic lipoprotein particles.The processes involved in the assembly of apoB-containing lipoproteins in the liver are complex and are regulated at multiple levels throughout the secretory pathway. The assembly of apoB-containing lipoproteins occurs co-translationally (1Schumaker V.N. Phillips M.L. Chatterton J.E. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 205-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), i.e. while the C-terminal portion is still being synthesized on the ribosome of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the N-terminal portion is translocated across the ER and is assembled as a small lipoprotein particle. The addition of lipids to apoB is widely believed to occur in two steps (2Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17377-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 6Alexander C.A. Hamilton R.L. Havel R.J. J.

Med. 2000; 10: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The first step involves the addition of small amounts of lipids to apoB, as it is translated and translocated into the lumen of ER preventing its degradation and formation of a partially lipidated small pre-VLDL particle in the high density lipoprotein (HDL) density range (2Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17377-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 7Olofsson S.O. Stillemark-Billton P. Asp L. Trends Cardiovasc.

In the second step, this pre-VLDL particle is believed to acquire the bulk of its core lipids and is converted to bona fide VLDL (2Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17377-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 7Olofsson S.O. Stillemark-Billton P. Asp L. Trends Cardiovasc.

Nielsen L.B. Young S.G. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1543-1557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical studies of VLDL assembly support the concept that the bulk of neutral lipids are added in the second step after apoB translation is completed (10Boren J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).One of the most important factors in the assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins is microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), which predominantly resides in the ER of hepatocytes and enterocytes (11Wetterau J.R.

A vital role of MTP in the formation and secretion of apoB-containing lipoprotein particles is further substantiated by the observation that patients with abetalipoproteinemia, an autosomal-recessive disorder caused by mutations in the MTP gene, have low levels of apoB in plasma (11Wetterau J.R.

Although the obligatory role of MTP in the secretion of VLDL is well established, the precise mechanism by which MTP transfers lipids to the nascent apoB polypeptide during its synthesis and assembly into VLDL is not fully understood. Furthermore, the relative importance of MTP in the two steps of VLDL assembly remains unclear and controversial. Some studies indicate that MTP has a crucial role in the first step assembly of VLDL (15Du E.Z. Wang S.L. Kayden H.J. Sokol R. Curtiss L.K. Davis R.A. J.

The secreted 35S-labeled apoB and albumin in the media and 35S-labeled apoB in cell lysates were isolated by immunoprecipitation as described below.Metabolic Labeling of the Lipid Content of ApoB-containing Lipoprotein Particles—Cells were grown in 6-well dishes as described above. At the start of experiments, maintenance media were removed; cells were washed twice with PBS and were incubated for 17 h in serum-free DMEM (for McA-RH cells) or MEM (for HepG2 cells) containing either [3H]glycerol (7 μCi/ml of medium) or [14C]oleic acid (0.4 mm) bound to 0.75% BSA. In experiments where the radiolabeled lipids associated with apoB-containing particles were determined by autoradiography, cells were labeled with both [3H]glycerol and [14C]oleic acid to enhance the signal. The labeled conditioned media were processed and supplemented with preservatives as described above. Cell monolayers were washed with PBS, scraped off the plate in 1.0 ml of PBS, and sonicated. The incorporation of [3H]glycerol or [14C]oleic acid into various lipid moieties of apoB-containing lipoproteins secreted into the medium and accumulated in the cells was determined by immunoprecipitation or by nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (NDGGE) as described below. Cell protein content was measured by the method of Lowry et al. (38Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol.

The 35S-labeled albumin in the conditioned media of HepG2 and McA-RH cells was determined as above using rabbit antibody to human and rat albumin, respectively. The 35S-labeled proteins were extracted from protein G as described previously (26Dashti N. Gandhi M. Liu X. Lin X. Segrest J.P.

After electrophoresis, the gels were analyzed by autoradiography, in conjunction with computer-assisted image processing, or by immunoblotting as described below and in the figure legends.NDGGE—The [3H]glycerol-labeled apoB-containing lipoprotein particles in the conditioned media were separated on 4-20% NDGGE as described previously (26Dashti N. Gandhi M. Liu X. Lin X. Segrest J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6978-6987Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Gels were stained, and the bands corresponding to apoB100 (in parental McA-RH and HepG2 cells) and apoB:1000 (in stably transfected McA-RH cells), identified by immunoblotting of a duplicate gel, were excised and analyzed for lipids as described below. Alternatively, the incorporation of [3H]glycerol and [14C]oleic acid into total lipids of intact apoB-containing lipoproteins was determined by NDGGE of the labeled conditioned media and autoradiography.Immunoblot Analysis—The apoB-containing particles were separated on 4-12% SDS-PAGE (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205950) Google Scholar) or on 4-20% NDGGE.

Full-length recombinant DLDH (rDLDH) was expressed and compared with enzyme expressed in the absence of lipoic acid (rDLDH-LA) or with enzyme lacking the first 112 amino acids constituting the lipoyl protein domain (rDLDH-LIPOYL). All three proteins contained 1 mol of FAD/mol of protein, had a higher activity for the conversion of NAD+ to NADH than for the reaction in the reverse direction, and were unable to use NADP+ and NADPH as substrates. The enzymes had similar substrate specificities, with the Km for NAD+ being ∼20 times higher than that for dihydrolipoamide. The kinetic pattern suggested a Ping Pong Bi Bi mechanism, which was verified by product inhibition studies. The protein expressed without lipoic acid was indistinguishable from the wild-type protein in all analyses. On the other hand, the protein without a lipoyl protein domain had a 2–3-fold higher turnover number, a lower KI for NADH, and a higher KI for lipoamide compared with the other two enzymes.

In a 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complex, the DLDH enzyme catalyzes the terminal pyridine nucleotide-linked reoxidation of a protein-bound dihydrolipoic acid using NAD+ as an electron acceptor and FAD as a prosthetic group (4Williams C.H. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar). Purified DLDH is capable of catalyzing the reversible NAD+-dependent oxidation of free dihydrolipoamide and other reduced lipoic acid derivatives (14Dietrichs D. Andreesen J.R. J.

Catalysis by the DLDH enzyme occurs via a Ping Pong Bi Bi reaction mechanism, which has been verified by both substrate inhibition kinetics and isotope exchange between NADH and NAD+ (18Massey V.

Furthermore, the enzyme shows a strong substrate inhibition by NADH, making it difficult to measure the initial velocity of the forward reaction. We recently identified DLDH from Streptococcus pneumoniae (25Smith A.W. Roche H. Trombe M.C. Briles D.E. Håkansson A.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 431-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Mutational inactivation of the gene abolishes DLDH activity and results in loss of virulence in both septicemia and respiratory tract infection models in mice. As S. pneumoniae lacks activity associated with all known 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes, alternative functions of the enzyme were investigated. The DLDH-negative strains were found to display impaired galactose and α-galactoside metabolism because of a down-regulation of α-galactosidase and impaired galactose transport into DLDH-negative cells. How these phenotypes relate to a reduction in virulence is under study. The pneumococcal dldh sequence suggests the presence of an N-terminal lipoyl protein domain, which is the physiologic substrate for the enzyme. This study presents the enzymatic characterization of DLDH from S. pneumoniae and describes the contribution of lipoic acid and the lipoyl protein domain to the catalytic characteristics of the enzyme. Using recombinant pneumococcal DLDH preparations with and without a functional lipoyl domain, we show that the absence of lipoic acid in the enzyme has no impact on enzyme behavior, but that the absence of the lipoyl protein domain changes the kinetic characteristics of the enzyme.

Serum from a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis was kindly provided by Dr. Jem Palmer (School of Biochemistry and Genetics, University of Newcastle, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK). Expression of Recombinant DLDH Proteins—The dldh gene with and without the initial 112 amino acids (representing the lipoyl protein domain) was amplified by PCR using primer pair DLDH-clon-F/DLDH-clon-R or DLDH-DL-F/DLDH-clon-R (see Table 1) and chromosomal DNA from S. pneumoniae TIGR4 (27Tettelin H.

The amplified fragments were cloned into the pQE30 vector and electroporated into TOP10F′ cells (Invitrogen). Clones carrying the insert of interest were selected on LB agar containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and verified by restriction digestion and sequencing of the purified plasmid. Verified plasmids were then transformed into E. coli M15 cells for protein expression.TABLE 1Primers used in the study Lowercase letters refer to restriction sites added to the primers, and uppercase letters refer to actual genomic or plasmid sequence.Primer namePrimer sequenceSourceDLDH-clon-F5′-cgcggatccGCCTTAGAAGTAATTATGCC-3′This studyDLDH-clon-R5′-cccaagcttAATAACCTTCCAGTCTAATC-3′This studyDLDH-DL-F5′-ggaagatctAACGATGATGGTAAGAGCGA-3′This studyDLDH-K43A5′-AAATCATGACTGATGCAGTCAGCATGGAAT-3′This studyDLDH-K43R5′-AAATCATGACTGATAGAGTCAGCATGGAAT-3′This studypQE-F5′-CGGATAACAATTTCACACAG-3′Qiagen Inc.pQE-R5′-GTTCTGAGGTCATTACTGG-3′Qiagen Inc. Open table in a new tab The expression construct containing the full-length DLDH sequence was further used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis of the Lys43 codon. A primer was constructed covering 12 bp in either direction from the Lys43 codon. The codon (AAA in the original sequence) was changed to AGA to make a lysine-to-arginine substitution or to GCA to make a lysine-to-alanine mutation using primers DLDH-K43R and DLDH-K43A (see Table 1). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the U.S.E. site-directed mutagenesis kit (GE Healthcare). The mutated sequence was verified by sequencing and transferred into the E. coli M15 cells for protein expression. Expression of DLDH proteins was done in either LB broth or M9 medium (1 g of NH4Cl, 3 g of KH2PO4, 6 g of Na2HPO4·7H2O, 20 ml of 20% glucose, 1 ml of 1 m MgSO4, and 0.5 g of NaCl per liter of water) with the addition of 300 μg/ml lipoic acid. To express DLDH without covalently attached lipoic acid, bacteria harboring the full-length dldh gene in pQE30 were grown and induced for protein expression in M9 medium without the addition of lipoic acid. Expression of plasmid-borne protein sequences was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at room temperature, and the overexpressed proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose according to the manufacturer's instructions. The proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting and quantified using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay. DNA Sequencing—Automated sequencing reactions were run on an ABI PRISM 377 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Each construct was sequenced using the pQE-F or pQE-R primer (Table 1). Sequences were analyzed and edited using the Sequencher software program (Gene Codes Corp.). Enzyme Assays—DLDH activity was measured as the oxidation of NADH in the presence of 6,8-thioctic acid amide (lipoamide) or the reduction of NAD+ in the presence of dihydrolipoamide, visualized as decreased absorbance at 365 nm or increased absorbance at 340 nm, respectively (14Dietrichs D. Andreesen J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 243-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Engels A. Kahmann U. Ruppel H.G. Pistorius E.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1340: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In brief, the enzyme source was added to 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 1 mm EDTA with various concentrations of NADH and lipoamide or NAD+ and dihydrolipoamide in a final volume of 1 ml. The initial velocity was determined for each combination of substrate concentrations and plotted in a Lineweaver-Burk (double-reciprocal) plot. These plots were used to calculate the kinetic parameters of the enzyme preparations with an extinction coefficient for NADH of 6.22 mm-1 cm-1 at 340 nm or 3.29 mm-1 cm-1 at 365 nm. The pH optimum for enzymatic activity was determined using potassium phosphate buffer at pH 5.5–9.8. Activity was measured at both room temperature and 37 °C. DLDH activity was also detected in a native gel assay. The enzyme source was run on 10% polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) in the absence of SDS, and the gel was incubated at 37 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA and 0.4 mm NADH using 0.75 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium as the electron acceptor. Activity was detected as purple-colored protein bands. Western Blotting—Enzyme sources (1–4 μg) were run on 4–12% polyacrylamide gels under denaturing conditions, and the gels were electroblotted onto a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) in Tris/glycine buffer (20% methanol, 25 mm Tris, and 192 mm glycine (pH 8.1–8.4)) at 100 V for 1 h. Blotted membranes were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) with 2.5% skim milk for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times with PBS-T. The membrane was incubated with human antiserum from a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis (1:5000 dilution in PBS-T) or with anti-RGS-His antibody (1:5000 in PBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times with PBS-T. The membrane was further incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human or anti-mouse antibody (1:5000 dilution in PBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the membrane was developed on film after exposure to enhanced chemiluminescence substrate. Flavin Determination—The absorbance spectrum for the recombinant DLDH preparations was measured in an Ultrospec III spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare) from 273 to 600 nm. Samples were measured against a reference cuvette containing buffer without protein present. The spectrum of the reduced enzyme was measured in the presence of NADH or dihydrolipoamide. The enzyme-bound flavins were liberated by thermal denaturation at 100 °C for 15 min, after which the protein was pelleted at 13,000 × g. The flavin concentration of the supernatant was determined spectrophotometrically at 455 nm using an extinction coefficient for FAD of 11.3 mm-1 cm-1. To verify the presence of FAD, a portion of the supernatant was analyzed by thin-layer chromatography on silica plates with 1-butanol/acetic acid/water (4:3:3) as the solvent using FAD and flavin mono-nucleotide as references. Thiol Titration—The number of accessible thiol groups in oxidized and NADH-reduced proteins was determined using 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) as described (28Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). To 1 ml of reaction buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.3) with 1 mm EDTA) was added 100 μl of 10 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) solution, and the absorbance at 412 nm was recorded. The enzyme source (4 μm) was added, and the absorbance was recorded until the reaction was complete, usually ∼20 min. The reaction was monitored in the presence and absence of 10 mm NADH to determine the reactive thiol concentration of the reduced and oxidized proteins, respectively. The thiol concentration was then determined after correcting for the absorbance of a buffer control using an extinction coefficient for 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate anion of 14.15 mm-1 cm-1. Expression of Recombinant DLDH Proteins—The aim of this study was to enzymatically characterize DLDH from the Gram-positive organism S. pneumoniae. Pneumococcal DLDH has the intriguing feature that it harbors an N-terminal protein domain containing a 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase acetyltransferase component lipoyl-binding motif, which is the physiologic substrate for the enzyme (amino acids 27–56) of the DLDH sequence, with Lys43 being the conserved lysine to which lipoic acid can be covalently attached; PROSITE accession number PDOC00168). Although it shares this feature with most Streptococcus and Clostridium and some Mycoplasma species, the lipoyl protein domain is part of the acetyltransferase component in all other species expressing 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases. Recombinant DLDH (rDLDH) proteins with or without covalently attached lipoic acid and/or the N-terminal lipoyl protein domain were produced. To obtain DLDH enzyme lacking covalently attached lipoic acid, we first attempted to mutate the conserved Lys43 codon to either arginine (rDLDHK43R) or alanine (rDLDHK43A). Both mutations were postulated to make covalent attachment of lipoic acid impossible. rDLDHK43R expressed well, but still had lipoic acid attached (see below). Several attempts were made to construct the lysine-to-alanine mutation (rDLDHK43A); however, all positive clones obtained were unable to express the mutant protein. This suggests that this variant of the protein may not fold correctly or may be toxic to E. coli cells during expression. To obtain non-lipoylated DLDH (rDLDH-LA), the wild-type protein sequence was instead expressed in minimal medium lacking lipoic acid. To obtain DLDH lacking the N-terminal lipoyl protein domain (rDLDH-LIPOYL), we expressed the DLDH sequence without the first 112 amino acids that correspond to the lipoyl protein domain (25Smith A.W. Roche H. Trombe M.C. Briles D.E. Håkansson A.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 431-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The full-length protein (rDLDH) had a calculated molecular mass of 61.6 kDa, and a band close to that size was visible on the gel as well as after Western blotting using anti-RGS-His antibody (Fig. 1, A and C). rDLDH-LA ran identically to wild-type DLDH on the gel, whereas rDLDH-LIPOYL (lacking the N-terminal 112 amino acids and with a calculated molecular mass of 49.8 kDa) ran close to the 50-kDa molecular mass standard. All three recombinant preparations were at least 90% pure as determined by Coomassie Blue staining of the gel as well as by flavin absorbance spectrometry (see below). The activity of the pure DLDHs was investigated in a native polyacrylamide gel assay using NADH as the substrate and nitro blue tetrazolium as the electron acceptor. Proteins capable of oxidizing NADH to NAD+ were visualized as purple-colored bands within the gel. All three rDLDH proteins exhibited strong DLDH activity in this assay (Fig. 1B). A denatured (8 m urea) sample of rDLDH exhibited no enzymatic activity in this assay and ran as a lower molecular mass band (suggestive of a monomer), supporting the fact that DLDH activity requires dimerization of the protein (data not shown) (29Mattevi A. Obmolova G. Kalk K.H. Westphal A.H. de Kok A. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1183-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Each of the recombinant protein samples also contained higher molecular mass bands that showed activity and reacted with anti-His antibody (Fig. 1B). This suggests that DLDH can function as part of larger protein complexes. This analysis also confirmed that the N-terminal protein domain is not necessary for the enzymatic activity of pneumococcal DLDH. Lipoylation and Thiol Quantitation of the rDLDHs—Lipoylation of protein domains in E. coli is a two-step process in which an octanoate precursor is first attached to the conserved lysine residue in the lipoyl protein domain and then converted to lipoate by enzymatic insertion of two sulfur atoms (30Zhao X. Miller J.R. Jiang Y. Marletta M.A. Cronan J.E. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 1293-1302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Alternatively, lipoic acid present in the extracellular environment can be scavenged and directly attached to the lipoyl protein domain. Attachment of octanoate or lipoate to lipoyl protein domains is catalyzed by lipoate-protein ligase (31Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16091-16100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the conversion of octanoate to lipoate requires the activity of lipoate synthase (32Miller J.R. Busby R.W. Jordan S.W. Cheek J. Henshaw T.F. Ashley G.W. Broderick J.B. Cronan Jr., J.E. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15166-15178Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 33Vanden Boom T.J. Reed K.E.

During overexpression of lipoyl protein domains in E. coli, the activities of both lipoate-protein ligase and lipoate synthase are rate-limiting and may result in portions of the lipoyl protein domains being octanoylated or unmodified (34Ali S.T. Moir A.J. Ashton P.R. Engel P.C. Guest J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To ensure optimal lipoylation of our DLDH preparations, lipoic acid was added to the medium, and expression was induced at low inducer concentration and low temperature. Both rDLDH and the lipoic acid-deficient rDLDH-LA contained an N-terminal lipoyl protein domain that could be detected with serum from a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis by Western blotting (Fig. 1D) (35Quinn J. Diamond A.G. Masters A.K. Brookfield D.E. Wallis N.G. Yeaman S.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 36Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). rDLDH-LIPOYL did not react with this serum, verifying that it lacked the N-terminal lipoyl protein domain. Because these antibodies recognize the protein subsequence of the lipoyl domain and not the actual lipoic acid group itself, the presence of covalently attached lipoic acid on rDLDH and rDLDH-LA was assessed by thiol titration. The concentration of thiol groups was determined in both the oxidized and reduced enzyme states. In its reduced form, full-length DLDH showed a molar ratio (mol of thiol groups/mol of enzyme) of 5.04 ± 0.45, consistent with the expected three cysteine residues from within the protein sequence and two thiol groups from the dihydrolipoic acid attached to Lys43. In its oxidized form, only 1 mol (0.94 ± 0.22) of thiol groups/mol of protein was accessible, consistent with intrinsic disulfide bonding between two of the three cysteine residues and oxidation of dihydrolipoic acid to lipoic acid. rDLDH-LA (grown in the absence of lipoic acid) showed the expected 3 mol (3.20 ± 0.36) of thiol groups/mol of enzyme in its reduced form and 1 mol (0.81 ± 0.29) in its oxidized form. rDLDH-LIPOYL also contained the expected 3 mol (3.09 ± 0.32) of thiol groups/mol of enzyme in its reduced form and 0.83 ± 0.24 mol of thiol groups/mol of protein in its oxidized form. These results show that the N-terminal domain of DLDH is in fact a lipoyl protein domain to which lipoic acid can be attached. Of related interest, the site-directed mutant rDLDHK43R (harboring a lysine-to-arginine substitution in the lipoic acid-binding site) showed a similar or (for some batches) higher molar thiol ratio (5.5–7.4) in its reduced state compared with wild-type rDLDH. Whether this results from unspecific lipoylation at other sites in the protein sequence or the tantalizing possibility that arginine in this position can serve as a substrate for ligation of lipoic acid needs to be verified with more specific experiments in the future. Flavin Determination—At identical concentrations, the rDLDH preparations displayed a yellow color of similar intensity, indicating the presence of a protein-bound flavin. The spectra of the recombinant enzymes were obtained by scanning the absorbance between 273 and 600 nm. All rDLDHs showed the classical flavin-protein absorbance spectra, with a peak at 454 nm, a distinct shoulder at 480 nm, and a smaller shoulder at 430 nm (Fig. 2). The flavin moiety could be reduced by the addition of NADH or dihydrolipoamide, resulting in a characteristic shift in the spectrum (Fig. 2, inset). After thermal denaturation of the recombinant proteins, the flavin component was identified as FAD by thin-layer chromatography (data not shown). The molar ratios of FAD were determined to be 0.98, 0.91, and 0.96 mol of FAD/mol of enzyme for rDLDH, rDLDH-LA, and rDLDH-LIPOYL, respectively. This indicated that all of the rDLDH constructs contained 1 mol of FAD/mol of protein. The FAD molar ratios also indicated that the DLDH preparations had a high level of purity. This was supported by the ratios of the absorbance peaks at 273 and 455 nm (an excellent indicator of protein purity), which were 5.5, 6.0, and 5.2 for rDLDH, rDLDH-LA, and rDLDH-LIPOYL, respectively (4Williams C.H. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar). Characterization of the rDLDH Proteins—The activities of the different recombinant enzymes were measured both for the dihydrolipoamide-dependent reduction of NAD+ and for the lipoamide-dependent oxidation of NADH (Equation 1),NAD++Lip(SH)2↔NADH+H++Lip(S-S)(Eq. 1) where Lip(SH)2 and Lip(S-S) are reduced and oxidized lipoate, respectively. When the purified DLDH proteins were eluted directly into potassium phosphate buffer, the enzymatic activity rapidly dissipated. This loss of activity was attributed to the dissociation of the dimeric and multimeric enzyme structures into inactive monomers and could be prevented by the direct addition of 10% ammonium sulfate or 30% glycerol upon elution. These latter enzyme preparations were used for the remaining experiments and were stable for long periods at 4 or -20 °C, respectively. DLDH activity was based on determining the initial velocity of the reaction, measuring the change in NADH absorbance as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We first determined the pH at which the enzymes worked optimally. Initial velocities were determined at saturating substrate concentrations for each of the recombinant enzymes in phosphate buffer at pH 5.5–9.8. The pH optima for all three enzymes were ∼8.5 in the forward reaction and ∼8.3 in the reverse reaction (data not shown). Phosphate buffer at pH 8.5 and 8.3 was therefore used for all subsequent analyses in the forward and reverse directions, respectively. At saturating substrate concentrations, the full-length enzyme (rDLDH) converted NADH to NAD+ with an activity of 11.5 μmol/min/mg of enzyme source and NAD+ to NADH with an activity of 72.6 μmol/min/mg of enzyme source. The corresponding activities were 12.3 and 75.4 μmol/min/mg for rDLDH-LA and 32.4 and 215.4 μmol/min/mg for rDLDH-LIPOYL. The higher conversion activity seen in the forward reaction (Equation 1) correlates well with the trend seen in crude pneumococcal extracts (25Smith A.W. Roche H. Trombe M.C. Briles D.E. Håkansson A.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 431-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and suggests that the enzyme favors the reaction direction usually seen in 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes. Additionally, the higher conversion activity determined for rDLDH-LIPOYL suggests that the presence of the lipoyl protein domain (but not lipoic acid alone) decreases the activity of pneumococcal DLDH.
