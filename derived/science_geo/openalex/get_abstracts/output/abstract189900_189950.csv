https://openalex.org/W2065309968,"Plant pathogenic fungi of the genus Fusarium cause agriculturally important diseases of small grain cereals and maize. Trichothecenes are a class of mycotoxins produced by different Fusarium species that inhibit eukaryotic protein biosynthesis and presumably interfere with the expression of genes induced during the defense response of the plants. One of its members, deoxynivalenol, most likely acts as a virulence factor during fungal pathogenesis and frequently accumulates in grain to levels posing a threat to human and animal health. We report the isolation and characterization of a gene from Arabidopsis thaliana encoding a UDP-glycosyltransferase that is able to detoxify deoxynivalenol. The enzyme, previously assigned the identifier UGT73C5, catalyzes the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to the hydroxyl group at carbon 3 of deoxynivalenol. Using a wheat germ extract-coupled transcription/translation system we have shown that this enzymatic reaction inactivates the mycotoxin. This deoxynivalenol-glucosyltransferase (DOGT1) was also found to detoxify the acetylated derivative 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol, whereas no protective activity was observed against the structurally similar nivalenol. Expression of the glucosyltransferase is developmentally regulated and induced by deoxynivalenol as well as salicylic acid, ethylene, and jasmonic acid. Constitutive overexpression in Arabidopsis leads to enhanced tolerance against deoxynivalenol."

This method is costly, often not implemented in remote regions, and incapable of measuring flow on floodplains and wetlands. Without these observations, global models of climate and water management are poorly constrained. In their Perspective,
 Alsdorf and Lettenmaier
 argue that satellite observations are required to measure the spatial diversity of the water surface across the globe. Three different satellite-based methods can measure water volumes in floodplains, channels, lakes, and reservoirs. Further development of these methods should allow global, volumetric measurements of fresh water from space."

In the current study we investigated the intracellular mechanisms involved in the NP-stimulated lipolytic effect in human preadipocytes and adipocytes. We demonstrate that the atrial NP (ANP)-induced lipolysis in human adipocytes was associated with an enhanced serine phosphorylation of the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). Both ANP-mediated lipolysis and HSL phosphorylation were inhibited in the presence of increasing concentrations of the guanylyl cyclase inhibitor LY-83583. ANP did not modulate the activity of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Moreover, H-89, a PKA inhibitor, did not affect the ANP-induced lipolysis. On primary cultures of human preadipocytes, the ANP-mediated lipolytic effect was dependent on the differentiation process. On differentiated human preadipocytes, ANP-mediated lipolysis, associated with an increased phosphorylation of HSL and of perilipin A, was strongly decreased by treatment with the inhibitor of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase I (cGKI), Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS. Thus, ANP-induced lipolysis in human adipocytes is a cGMP-dependent pathway that induces the phosphorylation of HSL and perilipin A via the activation of cGKI. The present study shows that lipolysis in human adipocytes can be controlled by an independent cGKI-mediated signaling as well as by the classical cAMP/PKA pathway. Our previous studies have demonstrated that natriuretic peptides (NPs), peptide hormones with natriuretic, diuretic, and vasodilating properties, exert a potent control on the lipolysis in human adipocytes via the activation of the type A guanylyl cyclase receptor (1.Sengenes C.

NPs signaling operates through two groups of cell surface receptors: the guanylyl cyclase (GC) receptors named GC-A and GC-B (6.Potter L.R. Hunter T. J. Biol.

The cGMP produced after the activation of GC-coupled receptors has multiple effectors within the cell, including the families of cGMP-dependent protein kinases (cGK), cGMP-stimulated/cGMP-inhibited phosphodiesterases (PDEs), cGMP-gated cation channels, and, in some cases, cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) (11.Lincoln T.M.

In addition to their renal, adrenal, and vascular effects, NPs may affect the metabolism of human adipocytes. In previous studies, we have demonstrated that ANP and brain NP, but not C-type NP, are potent stimulators of human fat cell lipolysis (1.Sengenes C. Berlan M. De Glisezinski I. Lafontan M. Galitzky J. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1345-1351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Sengenes C. Zakaroff-Girard A. Moulin A. Berlan M. Bouloumie A. Lafontan M. Galitzky J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: R257-R265Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Clinical studies have validated their action in vivo (13.Galitzky J. Sengenes C. Thalamas C. Marques M.A. Senard J.M.

Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 2002; 26: 24-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, the intracellular pathway involved in the NP-stimulated lipolytic effect still remained to be characterized. Former studies on human adipocytes have shown the essential role of cAMP in the modulation of the lipolytic pathway. Indeed, the main lipolytic regulators in human fat cells, i.e. catecholamines and insulin, are known to exert their effects through the regulation of intracellular cAMP content. On one hand, catecholamines induce their lipolytic effect through their interaction with β-adrenergic receptors. The consecutive increase in intracellular cAMP concentration leads to the activation of PKA which phosphorylates the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). Activated HSL hydrolyzes the triglycerides into nonesterified fatty acids and glycerol (15.Langin D. Lucas S. Lafontan M. Horm. Metab. Res. 2000; 32: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 16.Lafontan M. Sengenes C. Galitzky J. Berlan M. De Glisezinski I. Crampes F. Stich V. Langin D. Barbe P. Riviere D. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 2000; 24: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the inhibition of lipolysis by insulin involves the activation of the main PDE of the adipocyte, the PDE-3B, which promotes a reduction in the intracellular levels of cAMP (17.Degerman E. Landström T.R. Wijkander J. Holst L.S. Ahmad F. Belfrage P. Manganiello V. Methods. 1998; 14: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have shown that the PDE-3B activity as well as levels of intracellular cAMP are not modified by ANP in human adipocytes and that the presence of a GC-A receptor is required to trigger the lipolytic effect of NPs (1.Sengenes C. Berlan M. De Glisezinski I. Lafontan M. Galitzky J. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1345-1351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Sengenes C. Zakaroff-Girard A. Moulin A. Berlan M. Bouloumie A. Lafontan M. Galitzky J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: R257-R265Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). For the first time, we demonstrate that the lipolytic pathway activated by NPs involves a separate pathway in human fat cells (i.e. an increase in intracellular cGMP content followed by the phosphorylation of HSL and perilipin mediated by the activation of cGKI). Moreover, ontogenesis of this new pathway is described during human preadipocyte differentiation. Subjects—Human subcutaneous adipose tissue (1–2 g) was obtained from 16 normal or moderately overweight women undergoing plastic surgery. Their mean age was 48.4 ± 3.8 years, and their mean body mass index was 26.3 ± 0.9 kg/m2. The study was approved by the ethical committees of Toulouse and Frankfurt am Main University Hospitals. Human Mature Adipocyte Preparation—Isolated adipocytes were obtained according to the method of Rodbell (18.Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 29: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) by collagenase digestion of adipose fragments in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing albumin (3.5 g/100 ml) and glucose (6 mmol/liter) at pH 7.4 and under gentle shaking at around 60 cycles/min at 37 °C. Then the fat cells were filtered through a silk screen and washed three times with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer to eliminate collagenase. Human Preadipocyte Preparation and Culture—The isolation of human fat cell precursors was performed as described by Hauner et al. (19.Hauner H. Petruschke T. Russ M. Rohrig K. Eckel J. Diabetologia. 1995; 38: 764-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). All of the visible fibrous material and blood vessels were discarded from adipose tissue samples. The remaining adipose tissue was cut into small pieces and digested in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.15% collagenase and 2% bovine serum albumin under gentle shaking at 120 cycles/min at 37 °C. After centrifugation, the stromal cell fraction was resuspended and incubated in an erythrocyte-lysing buffer (155 mmol/liter NH4Cl, 5.7 mmol/liter K2HPO4, 0.1 mmol/liter EDTA) and then filtered through a nylon mesh (150 μm). After additional centrifugation, washing, and filtration steps, stromal cells were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (60000 cells/cm2). After 24 h of incubation, the medium was changed into medium consisting on Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 33 μmol/liter biotin, 17 μmol/liter panthotenate, 10 μg/ml human transferrin, 50 μg/ml gentamycin (basal medium) in the presence of 66 nmol/liter insulin, 1 nmol/liter triiodothyronine, 100 nmol/liter cortisol, and, for the first 3 days, 1 μg/ml ciglitazone. The medium was changed every 2 days. Before the experiments, the cells were placed in basal medium for 24 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and either lysed for Western blot analysis or treated for lipolysis experiments. Lipolysis Measurement in Human Preadipocytes or Mature Adipocytes—Isolated mature adipocytes were brought to a suitable dilution (2000–3000 cells/assay) in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer and incubated with pharmacological agents at the indicated concentrations for 90 min at 37 °C. For lipolysis measurements, 10-day differentiated human adipocytes were incubated for 6 h in basal medium at 37 °C in both the presence and absence of the pharmacological agents. At the end of the incubation, 20–50-μl aliquots of the infranatant were taken for glycerol determination (used as the lipolytic index) (20.Bradley D.C. Kaslow H.R. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Total lipid content was determined gravimetrically after solvent extraction. Determination of cGMP Concentrations—Isolated mature adipocytes were preincubated in 1 ml of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence of 0.1 mmol/liter isobutylmethylxanthine (nonspecific PDE inhibitor). The cells were further incubated for 10 min both in the presence of and absence of 10 nmol/liter ANP. The reaction ceased with the addition of a solution of chloroform, methanol, 1 n HCl (2 volumes/1 volume/0.1 volume). To measure cGMP content according to the kit manufacturer instructions (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI), the aqueous phase of each sample was freeze-dried and redissolved in the appropriate buffer after centrifugation (5000 rpm, 5 min). RNA Extraction and RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNAs were extracted from human mature adipocytes or preadipocytes using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). RNA concentrations were determined using a fluorometric assay (Ribogreen). For the RT, 1–2 μg of total RNA were incubated with 200 units of reverse transcriptase (SuperScript II; Invitrogen), dNTP (0.5 mmol/liter), hexamer (25 ng/liter), dithiothreitol (0.01 mol/liter), and reaction buffer in a final volume of 20 μl at 42 °C for 50 min and then at 70 °C for 15 min. In some reaction mixtures, total RNA was omitted to ensure the lack of amplification of contaminating genomic DNA, which was always the case in the present study. After a final denaturation at 94 °C for 4 min, 10 μl of cDNA was subjected to PCR consisting of a denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min followed by 1 min of hybridization with specific primers at a variable temperature that depends on the target gene, and 90 s of elongation at 72 °C for n cycles. The last cycle ended with 7 min of elongation at 72 °C. The annealing temperature (T) and the number (n) of PCR cycles (optimized for each couple of primer): cGKI, 54 °C for 40 cycles; cGKII, 52 °C for 40 cycles; and GAPDH, 56 °C for 35 cycles (Table I).Table IHuman cGK primersForwardReverseHuman cGKIGAGGACAGGACTCATCAAGACAGCTTCAGGTTGGCGAAGHuman cGKIIAACCATATCTTTGTGCTGGCACTCTTCCGAACCCACCAACGAPDHTATGACAACTCCCTCAAGATAGATCCACAACGGATACATT Open table in a new tab The PCR contained 0.4 μmol/liter of each primer, dNTP (0.2 mmol/liter), MgCl2 (1.5mmol/liter) reaction buffer, and 5 units of Taq polymerase (Promega) in a final volume of 50 μl. The amplified cDNAs were size-fractioned by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized under UV with a 1% ethidium bromide staining. The gels were scanned and analyzed using the National Institutes of Health Image program. Individual data were calculated as means of four independent experiments and expressed as the ratios of cGKI or cGKII over GAPDH expression. Real Time Quantitative PCR Assay—RNA (2 μg) was reverse transcribed using the ThermoScript RT system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Random Hexamers and dNTPs were also supplied by Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was also performed without Thermoscript enzyme on RNA samples to provide a control for contamination of samples with genomic DNA. PCR primers were designed using Primer Express software according to the recommendations of Applied Biosystems. Optimum primer concentrations were determined by performing PCR with a range of primer concentrations and comparing the rate of product accumulation (Table II).Table IIPrimers for the human NP receptorsForwardReverseHuman GC-ATGGAACCGAAGCTTTCAAGGTCCATATCCCAGAGGGAGAAGTCTHuman GC-BAATGGTCAGCGGCCATATTTTACGCAAAACTAGCTCTTCATTCAGHuman NPr-CGGAAGACATCGTGCGCAATATGCTCCGGATGGTGTCACT18 SGGAGGTCATTGGTGATTACTTTGGAAGAGCCCCAAGGATATTTGACA Open table in a new tab Amplification reaction was performed in duplicate on 20 ng of the cDNA sample (5 μl) in a final volume of 26 μl in 96-well Optical reaction plates (Applied Biosystems) in a GeneAmp 5700 sequence detection system. For GC-A, GC-B, and NPr-C, the PCR mixture contained 900 nmol/liter forward and reverse primer mix (8 μl) and 13 μl of SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) containing a fluorescence dye, SYBR Green, which upon binding to double-stranded DNA exhibits fluorescence enhancement. The enhancement of fluorescence is proportional to the initial concentration of the cDNA. For ribosomal RNA control (18 S rRNA), PCR mixture contained 8 μl of primers and fluorogenic probe mix (Applied Biosystems) and 13 μl of TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). All of the reactions were performed under the same conditions: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The results were analyzed with the GeneAmp 5700 software, and all of the values were normalized to levels of the ribosomal RNA control (18 S rRNA). PKA Activity Measurement—Human mature adipocytes were incubated in both the absence and presence of ANP (1 μmol/liter) or forskolin (100 μmol/liter) for 5 min. The cells were lysed at 4 °C in lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mmol/liter Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 1 mmol/liter CaCl2, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mmol/liter Na3VO4, and anti-protease mixture. The protein lysates were centrifuged (10 min, 10,000 × g, 4 °C), and the protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined. Each sample (1 mg/ml) was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C with the 32P/substrate solution (3000–6000 Ci/mmol [γ-32P]ATP, 50 μmol/liter Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide), 100 μmol/liter ATP, 10 mmol/liter MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mmol/liter Tris HCl (pH 7.5)) in the presence or in the absence of PKA activator (10 μmol/liter cAMP) and PKA inhibitor (1 μmol/liter PKI (6.Potter L.R.

At the end of the incubation time period, aliquots of the enzymatic reactions (20 μl) were spotted onto separate phosphocellulose discs, which were then immersed into an acid solution (1% phosphoric acid) and placed into scintillations vials to measure peptide incorporated 32P. Immunoprecipitation—Human mature fat cells or preadipocytes were lysed at 4 °C in lysis buffer. The lysates were centrifuged (10 min, 10,000 × g, 4 °C), and a preclearing step was performed on supernatants by incubation for 1 h with protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C under constant shaking. After a brief centrifugation, the precleared extracts were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C under constant shaking with a polyclonal rabbit anti-phosphoserine antibody or with the chicken polyclonal antibody against human HSL, and the immune complexes were recovered by 1 h of incubation with protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C under shaking and analyzed by Western blot. Western Blot Analysis—40 μg of cell lysate protein were separated by SDS-PAGE under denaturing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and Ponceau staining was performed to verify equal loading of the lanes. The membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C with a blocking buffer (50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mmol/liter NaCl, 0.05% polyethylene-sorbitan monolaurate (Tween), 3% bovine serum albumin, and 10% horse serum), incubated with a primary antibody for 90 min, rinsed, blocked for 40 min, and incubated with secondary antibody for 60 min. The immunocomplexes were visualized using the chemiluminescence reagent kit. The autoradiographs were scanned by an imaging densitometer and quantified using the National Institutes of Health Image program. Drugs and Chemicals—(–)-Isoproterenol hydrochloride (nonselective β-adrenergic receptor agonist), isobutylmethylxanthine (nonselective phosphodiesterease inhibitor), insulin, and bovine serum albumin (fraction V) were from Sigma-Aldrich. Crude collagenase, enzymes for glycerol assays, and tablets of protease inhibitors came from Roche Applied Science. Human-ANP (1.Sengenes C. Berlan M. De Glisezinski I. Lafontan M. Galitzky J.

The concentration response curves were fitted using nonlinear regression, and the EC50 values (half-maximal effective drug concentration) were calculated using the program Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). HSL Phosphorylation after ANP Exposure on Human Adipocyte—Because the serine phosphorylation of HSL is the limiting step of HSL activation and lipolysis, we first studied the effects of treatments for increasing times (5, 10, and 30 min, respectively) with 10 nmol/liter ANP or 100 nmol/liter isoproterenol (β-adrenergic receptor agonist) on the serine phosphorylation rate of HSL in human mature adipocytes. The selected concentrations are known to promote stimulation of lipolysis to a similar extent. As shown in Fig. 1A, Western blot analysis using an antibody directed against human HSL, performed on immunoprecipitates obtained with an antibody directed against phosphoserine residues, evidenced one band, the molecular mass of which corresponded to HSL (88 kDa). ANP, as well as isoproterenol, induced a time-dependent phosphorylation of HSL on serine residues (Fig. 1A). The kinetics of HSL phosphorylation observed for the both lipolytic agents exhibited statistically significant differences. Although exposure to isoproterenol was associated with a transient phosphorylated state of HSL, ANP-induced HSL phosphorylation, which was maximal after 10 min of incubation (3-fold increase compared with control), remained elevated for the following 20 min (p < 0.05, n = 6) (Fig. 1B). Moreover, the same experiments performed on rat adipocytes, known as a nonresponsive species regarding ANP-mediated lipolysis (2.Sengenes C. Zakaroff-Girard A. Moulin A. Berlan M. Bouloumie A.

Role of cGMP in ANP-induced Lipolysis on Human Fat Cells—To further characterize the intracellular pathway involved in the ANP-mediated HSL phosphorylation, human fat cells were treated with increasing concentrations (1–100 μmol/liter) of the GC inhibitor, LY-83583.

Vif functions to counteract an anti-HIV-1 cellular factor in non-permissive cells, CEM15/Apobec-3G, which shares a cytidine deaminase motif. CEM15/Apobec-3G deaminates dC to dU in the minus strand DNA of HIV-1, resulting in G to A hypermutation in the plus strand DNA. In this study, we have done the mutagenesis analysis on two cytidine deaminase motifs in CEM15/Apobec-3G and examined their antiviral functions as well as the DNA editing activity. Point mutations in the C-terminal active site such as E259Q and C291A almost completely abrogated the antiviral function, while those in the N-terminal active site such as E67Q and C100A retained this activity to a lesser extent as compared with that of the wild type. The DNA editing activities of E67Q and E259Q mutants were both retained but impaired to the same extent. This indicates that the enzymatic activity of this protein is essential but not a sole determinant of the antiviral activity. Furthermore, all the deletion mutants tested in this study lost the antiviral activity because of the loss of the activity for dimerization, suggesting that the entire protein structure is necessary for the antiviral function."

At present, it is only poorly understood whether members of the TRPC3/6/7 subfamily are functionally redundant or whether they serve distinct cellular roles.

To identify potential molecular correlates accounting for the functional difference, we analyzed the glycosylation pattern of TRPC6 compared with TRPC3. Two NX(S/T) motifs in TRPC6 were mutated (Asn to Gln) by in vitro mutagenesis to delete one or both extracellular N-linked glycosylation sites. Immunoblotting analysis of HEK 293 cell lysates expressing TRPC6 wild type and mutants favors a model of TRPC6 that is dually glycosylated within the first (e1) and second extracelluar loop (e2) as opposed to the monoglycosylated TRPC3 channel (Vannier, B., Zhu, X., Brown, D., and Birnbaumer, L. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 8675–8679). Elimination of the e2 glycosylation site, missing in the monoglycosylated TRPC3, was sufficient to convert the tightly receptor-regulated TRPC6 into a constitutively active channel, displaying functional characteristics of TRPC3. Reciprocally, engineering of an additional second glycosylated site in TRPC3 to mimic the glycosylation status in TRPC6 markedly reduced TRPC3 basal activity.

Based on structural and functional criteria, TRPC3, -6, and -7 form a distinct subgroup within the TRPC family. The primary amino acid sequences of TRPC3, -6, and -7 are ∼75% identical, and the latter proteins represent non-selective cation channels characterized by both inward and outward rectification. A functional hallmark of the TRPC3, -6, -7 subfamily is their membrane-delimited activation by diacylglycerols (DAGs) independent of protein kinase C (9Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M.

Schilling W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48303-48310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) TRPC3, -6, and -7 interact with each other, but not with other members of the TRPC family (8Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7461-7466Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both TRPC3 and TRPC6 are expressed in brain (12Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 13Boulay G. Zhu X. Peyton M. Jiang M. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29672-29680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). TRPC3 expression in the brain is most prominent around the time of birth, and in pontine neurons channel activation occurs through a signaling pathway initiated by binding of brain-derived growth factor to its cognate receptor, the transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB (14Li H.S. Xu X.Z. Montell C. Neuron. 1999; 24: 261-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The role of TRPC6 or putative TRPC3/6 heteromultimers in brain still remain elusive. TRPC3 was originally cloned from human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293 cells) (12Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) and functionally contributes to calcium permeable ion channels gated by store depletion in these cells (15Wu X. Babnigg G. Villereal M.L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 278: C526-C536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Low level stable expression of TRPC3 in HEK 293 cells gave rise to ion currents only when IP3 is bound to its receptor and internal calcium stores are depleted (16Kiselyov K. Xu X. Mozhayeva G. Kuo T. Pessah I. Mignery G. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Muallem S. Nature. 1998; 396: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, interacting domains of the IP3 receptor and TRPC3 have been characterized in great detail, thus entertaining the notion of store-dependent activation by a conformational coupling mechanism (Ref. 17Boulay G. Brown D.M. Qin N. Jiang M. Dietrich A. Zhu M.X. Chen Z. Birnbaumer M. Mikoshiba K. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Birnbaumer L. Zhu M.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3168-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Although TRPC3 expressed in DT40 avian B-lymphocytes show activation by store depletion (20Trebak M. Bird G, St.J. McKay R.R. Putney J.W. Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21617-21623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), the latter concept is not undisputed, and a predominant store-operated activation mechanism could not be confirmed in transiently transfected HEK 293 cells (20Trebak M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Most notably, the latter two studies and a report by Hurst et al. (23Hurst R.S. Zhu X. Boulay G. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) describe a high basal activity of TRPC3 channels. In the present study we address the question of whether TRPC3 and TRPC6 are functionally redundant or whether they display distinct functional characteristics. Thus, we monitored the basal activity of TRPC3 and compared it to that of TRPC6 by analysis of TRPC3- and TRPC6-expressing HEK 293 cells in Mn2+-quench experiments and electrophysiological recordings. In contrast to TRPC6, which turns out to be a tightly receptor- and phospholipase C-regulated channel, TRPC3 shows pronounced basal channel activity despite a high degree of overall amino acid identity between the two proteins (5Montell C. Sci. STKE. 2001; 2001: RE1PubMed Google Scholar). To identify the underlying cause for the different functional characteristics, we examined the glycosylation pattern of TRPC6 and identified two glycosylated asparagine residues as opposed to the monoglycosylated TRPC3 channel (7Vannier B. Zhu X. Brown D.M. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8675-8679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Elimination of the distal glycosylation site in TRPC6 (N561Q) by in vitro mutagenesis was sufficient to convert the tightly regulated TRPC6 protein into a constitutively active channel, resembling TRPC3 in this regard. Conversely, engineering of a second distal glycosylation site into TRPC3 (E512N) reduced basal activity. Thus, post-translational modifications of TRPC3 and TRPC6 determine distinct functional characteristics of genetically closely related cation channels. Materials—All cell culture media and supplements were purchased from PAA laboratories (Linz, Austria) Cell Culture and Transient Transfections—HEK 293 cells were grown in Earle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 units/ml streptomycin. For transient transfections, cells were seeded into 6-well dishes on glass coverslips and transfected the following day (80% confluency) with Metafectene reagent (Biontex, Munich, Germany). The concentration of transfected plasmid DNA was kept constant by combining 0.2 μg/dish green fluorescent protein (GFP) plasmid (Invitrogen, San Diego), 0.2 μg/dish of the guinea pig histamine H1 receptor in pcDNA3 and 1.6 μg/dish of the indicated TRPC subunit in pcDNA3 together with 6 μl of Metafectene reagent in 100 μl of serum-free medium. The mixture was added to the medium of the cells, which were analyzed 48 h later. Generation of Fluorescent Fusion Proteins and TRPC6GM1/2/1.2— The C-terminal fusion of hTRPC6 and hTRPC3 with green (GFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), respectively, is described elsewhere (8Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7461-7466Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Glycosylation mutants of TRPC6 were produced by using the Quick-Change XL mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Europe, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and the following oligonucleotides (mutated nucleotides are underlined): GM1 (N473Q) forward primer, 5′-GGC ACA AAA CTC CTT CCT CAA GAA ACC AGC ACA GAT, reverse primer, 5′-ATC TGT GCT GGT TTC TTC AGG AAG GAG TTT TGT GCC; GM2 (N561Q) forward primer, 5′-GC ATC:ATT GAC GCA CAA GAT ACT TTG AAG GAC TTG ACG; reverse primer, 5′-CGT CAA GTC CTT CAA AGT ATC TTG TGC GTC AAT GAT GC. The double mutant GM1.2 (N473Q/561Q) was constructed by amplifying the GM1 mutant with primers specific for GM2. The TRPC3Gly2 mutant (E512N) was constructed by a two-step PCR using the following primers: product A forward primer, 5′-GGA AGG ACC TAG GGA ATA CA, reverse primer, 5′-CTC TGG TGG GAG TGT CAC GTT ACT GAG GTC ACT CTC TTG; product B forward primer, 5′-CAA GAG AGT GAC CTC AGT AAC GTG ACA VCTC CCA GAG, reverse primer, 5′-TGG GAA AGT TAA CAA TTC GCA TGA TG. Products A and B were mixed and amplified by using the product A forward primer and the product B reverse primer. The resulting PCR product was digested with the restriction enzymes AvrII and HpaI and used to replace the corresponding fragment in the TRPC3 cDNA. All mutations were verified by sequencing. YFP- or GFP-tagged TRPC proteins were used for detection in immunoblots and in confocal microscopy, whereas all functional data were acquired with untagged counterparts. Tunicamycin Treatment and Immunoblotting—HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs coding for the indicated TRPC subunit in pcDNA3 (3 μg) using 9 μl of the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 14 h after transfection one-fifth of the medium was replaced with medium containing 0.1% Me2SO or tunicamycin (10 μm, Calbiochem, San Diego) in 0.1% Me2SO giving rise to a final tunicamycin concentration of 2 μm in 0.02% Me2SO. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline 36 h after transfection and resuspended in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) and protease inhibitors provided through MiniProtean tablets (Roche Applied Science). After repetitive aspiration through a 26-gauge needle, one volume of 2× Laemmli buffer was added. The cell lysate was heated (65 °C for 5 min), and proteins were resolved by 7% SDS-PAGE. After electroblotting to nitrocellulose (Hybond N, Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany), membranes were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h and incubated with an anti-TRPC6 (24Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) or an anti-TRPC3 antibody (14Li H.S. Xu X.Z. Montell C. Neuron. 1999; 24: 261-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) (1:1000 in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20). After washing with phosphate-buffered saline/0.05% Tween 20 (3 × 15 min), membranes were incubated with a secondary peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit Ig-G (1: 2000 in blocking medium; Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany) for 2 h, washed as before, and proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany). Assessment of Mn2+Entry—Mn2+ quenching experiments were conducted 48 h after transfection as described previously (9Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were loaded with fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester (5 μm) in HEPES-buffered saline (HBS: 140 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1.25 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm glucose and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) at room temperature for 45 min. Cells of interest were selected and analyzed using a Polychrome II monochromator and an IMAGO CCD camera (Till Photonics, Martinsried, Germany) coupled to an inverted Olympus IX70 microscope. Cells expressing GFP were selected at 470 nm and analyzed in Mn2+ quench experiments at the isosbestic wavelength of fura-2 (360 nm in our system) and at 340 and 380 nm for measuring [Ca2+]i. Cells were superfused with 2 or 0.2 mm MnCl2 in HBS and 100 μm histamine in HBS/Mn2+ at the time points indicated. Fluorescence signals of cells expressing GFP and the histamine receptor were recorded at 330-ms intervals at 360 nm and normalized to 100% of the initial value. Basal decreases of fluorescence after adding Mn2+ were calculated in percent/s, and initial decreases due to bleaching were subtracted. Each experiment was performed at least three times with similar results. Electrophysiological Techniques—HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs coding for the indicated TRPC subunits in pcDNA3 (2 μg), guinea pig H1 histamine receptor in pcDNA3 (0.5 μg) and GFP reporter plasmid (0.1 μg) using FuGENE 6 reagent (7.8 μl).

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1333-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) was used and compared with the one published by Zhu et al. (12Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). No functional differences were observed. The TRPC6GM1.2 and TRPC6GM2 mutants were subcloned into the pIRES2-EGFP vector (Invitrogen, San Diego) containing the coding sequence for the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) downstream of the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and cotransfected with the guinea pig H1 receptor (0.5 μg) as described above. Whole cell patch clamp recordings were carried out at room temperature (23 °C) 12–48 h after transfection, except for the TRPC6GM1.2 and TRPC6GM2 mutants, which were analyzed 48–120 h after transfection. Cells were superfused with bath solution (in mm): NaCl 140, CsCl 5, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 1, glucose 10, HEPES 10, buffered to pH 7.4 with NaOH. Data of whole cell recordings were collected with an EPC9 patch clamp amplifier (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany) using the Pulse software. Patch pipettes made of borosilicate glass (Science Products, Hofheim, Germany) had resistances of 2.5 to 3.5 mΩ when filled with intracellular solution (in mm): CsCl 120, NaCl 9.4, MgCl2 1, GTP 0.2, 100 nm free Ca2+ buffered with BAPTA 10, HEPES 10, titrated to pH 7.2 with CsOH. The liquid junction potential was +4.3 mV and corrected for by the Pulse software. Current-voltage relations were obtained from triangular voltage ramps from –100 to +60 mV with a slope of 0.4 V s–1 applied at a frequency of 1 Hz. Data were acquired at a frequency of 5 kHz after filtering at 1.67 kHz. Inside-out single-channel measurements were carried out 48–96 h after transfection with TRPC6 or TRPC6GM2 cDNAs as described above with a pipette solution (in mm): CsCl 120, NaCl 10, MgCl2 1, buffered at 100 nm free Ca2+ with BAPTA 10, HEPES 10, titrated to pH 7.2 with CsOH and a bath solution containing (in mm): CsCl 120, NaCl 10, MgCl2 1, glucose 10, buffered at 200 nm free Ca2+ with EGTA 10, HEPES 10, titrated to pH 7.2 with CsOH. The liquid junction potential was +0.5 mV. Data acquisition was performed with an EPC9 and EPC10 patch clamp amplifier using the Pulse software. For the evalution of channel activity, defined as NPo (the product of the number of channels and open probability) PC DAC 1.1.4 of Marburg University Software Team was used. NPo values were calculated for voltage ladders from –60 to +60 mV, recorded in 1-s steps. 1 μm 1-stearoly-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol (SAG), a potent non membrane-permeable diacylglycerol derivative, was added to stimulate the channels in inside-out patches. The sampling rate was 15 kHz and the data were filtered with a –3dB cut-off frequency of 5 kHz. Only patches with baseline noise of <560 fA r.m.s. were used. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.E. of the mean (S.E.). In the case of Mn2+ quench measurements, one representative experiment out of three is shown. Unless stated otherwise, data were compared by an unpaired Students' t test, if a Gaussian distribution was confirmed by applying a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (normality) test, and significance was accepted at p < 0.05. For multiple comparisons a one-way ANOVA was applied. Different Basal Activities of TRPC3 and TRPC6 —To address the issue as to whether TRPC3 and TRPC6 are functionally redundant or whether they have discernible characteristics, we set out to compare basal channel activities. To this end, human TRPC3 or TRPC6 were transiently coexpressed with the H1 histamine receptor in HEK 293 cells. Current-voltage relationships before and after application of histamine to the bath solution were recorded in whole cell patch clamp experiments (Fig. 1A). In both TRPC3- and TRPC6-expressing cells H1 receptor activation gave rise to rapidly developing transient outward and inward currents at holding potentials of +60 and –60 mV (Fig. 1A, insets), respectively. The current-voltage relations revealed rectification in the inward and outward direction, a property which is consistently encountered with members of the TRPC3/6 subfamily (25Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strübing C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). Most notably, basal TRPC3 activity in the absence of histamine was higher than that of TRPC6 when recorded both at negative and at positive potentials (Fig. 1A). Reversal potentials for TRPC3-expressing cells were –2.1 ± 0.8 and –1.7 ± 1.1 mV before and after histamine application, respectively, and –1.5 ± 1.0 and –2.6 ± 1.0 mV for TRPC6-expressing cells and were not significantly different (p > 0.05 One-way ANOVA). By plotting reversal potentials of TRPC3-expressing cells against current densities at +60 mV and at –60 mV no correlation between both values was detected (Fig. 1B). When basal TRPC3 and TRPC6 activities at –60 and +60 mV were normalized to maximal currents in response to histamine challenge monitored at the same holding potentials, TRPC3-expressing cells displayed significantly (p < 0.002) increased constitutive channel activities (-46.0 ± 5.0% and 48.7 ± 4.3% at –60 and +60 mV, respectively) as compared with HEK 293 cells studied after transfection of TRPC6 cDNA (-10.6 ± 2.3% and 20.9 ± 4.3% at –60 and +60 mV, respectively) (Fig. 1C). The functional differences between the two TRPC proteins did not depend on the type of Gq/11-coupled receptor coexpressed, because TRPC3 and TRPC6 could likewise be distinguished by means of their discrepant basal activities in HEK 293 cells expressing m5 muscarinic instead of H1 histamine receptors (data not shown). By adding Mn2+ to the bath solution, the influx of extracellular cations into single TRPC protein-expressing cells can be monitored by the quenching of fura-2 fluorescence by Mn2+ ions recorded at the isosbestic wavelength. Subsequent to the addition of 2 mm Mn2+ to the extracellular medium, a profound acceleration of the basal decrease of fura-2 fluorescence (–0.13 ± 0.01%/s) was observed only in TRPC3-expressing cells (Fig. 1D). On the contrary, the presence of TRPC6 did not give rise to increased fura-2 quenching by Mn2+ ions (–0.034 ± 0.008%/s, similar to untransfected cells, data not shown), thus revealing a significantly reduced (p < 0.001) basal activity. These data lend further credence to the concept of high basal TRPC3 activity as opposed to the quiescence of TRPC6 in the absence of phospholipase C activation. Glycosylation Status of TRPC3 and TRPC6 —TRPC3 and TRPC6 are closely related members of the same subfamily of TRPC proteins. We hypothesized that in addition to differences in the primary structure post-translational modifications like protein glycosylation may also contribute to the distinctive functional properties of the two cation channels. Therefore, we searched for potential glycosylation consensus sites (NX(S/T)) in the TRPC6 primary amino acid sequence. We detected seven potential glycosylation sites, only two of which are predicted to face the extracellular space as deduced from the TRPC3 transmembrane topology proposed by Vannier et al. (7Vannier B. Zhu X. Brown D.M. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8675-8679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, the N-terminal site, Asn-473, appears to be located in the first extracellular loop (e1) and corresponds to the single glycosylated asparagine residue in TRPC3 (7Vannier B. Zhu X. Brown D.M. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8675-8679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), while Asn-561 in the second extracellular loop (e2) has no counterpart in the TRPC3 primary amino acid sequence. To test whether these putative glycosylation sites were indeed post-translationally modified in TRPC6 and whether such modifications would entail any functional consequences, we initially created three glycosylation mutants (TRPC6GM1[N473Q], TRPC6GM2[N561Q], TRPC6GM1.2[N473/561Q]) as illustrated in Fig. 2A. In order to minimize the possibility of conformational disruption and to preserve the local charge distribution within the ion channel proteins, we exchanged Asn for structurally very similar Gln residues differing only by one methylene group in the amino acid side chains. TRPC6 and its three mutated versions C-terminally fused to GFP were expressed in HEK 293 cells and analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2B) and confocal laser-scanning microscopy (Fig. 2C). When lysates of wild-type TRPC6GFP-expressing cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with an anti-TRPC6 antibody, two specific bands of ∼120 and 160 kDa were detected (Fig. 2B). The diffuse band migrating with a higher molecular mass disappeared upon preincubation of cells with the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin, commensurate with the assumption that it represented a glycosylated form of TRPC6, while the 120-kDa band conforms to the non-glycosylated ion channel protein. Bands with apparent molecular masses around 80 kDa were also detected in non transfected control cells (left panel of Fig. 2B). Elimination of the N-terminal glycosylation site in TRPC6GM1 did not prevent the appearance of a diffuse slowly migrating, tunicamycin-sensitive band of ∼140 kDa indicating that protein glycosylation still occurred at the C-terminal site in e2. Reciprocally, removal of the C-terminal Asn-561 in TRPC6GM2 did not abolish protein glycosylation, because the relevant Asn residue in e1 could still be post-translationally modified. Only lysates of cells expressing TRPC6GM1.2 in which both possible glycosylation sites were eliminated, did no longer show slowly migrating tunicamycin-responsive protein bands. Thus, in contrast to TRPC3 modified only at one site in e1, our results strengthen the notion of a dually glycosylated TRPC6 channel. As protein glycosylation is known to have a profound impact on p"

In this study, we demonstrate that liver X receptors (LXRs) regulate the expression of GLUT4 through direct interaction with a conserved LXR response element in the GLUT4 promoter. The expression of GLUT4 in WAT is induced by a potent LXR agonist in wild type, LXRα-/-, and LXRβ-/- mice but not in LXRα-/-β-/- mice, demonstrating that both LXRs are able to mediate ligand activated transcription of the GLUT4 gene. However, basal and insulin stimulated expression of GLUT4 in epididymal WAT is reduced only in mice carrying ablation of the LXRα isoform. The expression of GLUT4 is furthermore correlated to the induction of LXRα during mouse and human adipocyte differentiation. LXRβ is thus apparently not able to rescue basal expression of GLUT4 in the absence of LXRα. We have previously demonstrated that LXRα is down-regulated in animal models of obesity and diabetes, thus revealing a striking correlation between GLUT4 and LXRα expression in insulin-resistant conditions. This suggests that the LXRα isoform has a unique role in adipose expression of GLUT4 and suggests that alteration of adipose tissue expression of LXRα might be a novel tool to normalize the expression of a gene that is dysregulated in diabetic and insulin-resistant conditions.

One important physiological consequence of obesity is a reduced ability to respond to insulin in peripheral tissues. Untreated, this insulin resistance is associated with increased risk for development of cardiovascular disease and, in later stages, type 2 diabetes. Numerous studies have shown that the effect of insulin to increase glucose uptake is directly dependent on recruitment of GLUT4, a facilitative glucose transporter, from an intracellular vesicle pool to the plasma membrane (reviewed in Refs. 1Suzuki K. Kono T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2542-2545Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar and 2Simpson F. Whitehead J.P. James D.E. Traffic. 2001; 2: 2-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). GLUT4 is expressed exclusively in tissues exhibiting insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, such as muscle, heart, and adipose tissue (3Kaestner K.H. Christy R.J. McLenithan J.C. Braiterman L.T. Cornelius P. Pekala P.H. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3150-3154Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In the basal state, GLUT4 is sorted to an intracellular compartment with a low exocytotic rate, which changes to a high exocytotic rate upon insulin stimulation through activation of intracellular phosphorylation cascades (2Simpson F. Whitehead J.P. James D.E. Traffic. 2001; 2: 2-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Although this insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 is the main factor that increases glucose uptake, it also depends on the amount of stored GLUT4 in such a compartment. The expression of GLUT4 is reduced in rodent models of insulin deficiency (4Berger J. Biswas C. Vicario P.P. Strout H.V. Saperstein R. Pilch P.F.

Diabetes. 1992; 41: 465-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), directly linking adipose expression of GLUT4 to insulin resistance. Moreover, recent studies in mice have demonstrated that selective ablation of GLUT4 in adipose tissue leads to decreased whole body glucose tolerance and insulin responsiveness (8Abel E.D. Peroni O.

Yang H. Leach F. Kahn B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22243-22246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This implies an important role of adipose tissue GLUT4 expression in whole body glucose homeostasis, despite the fact that it is estimated that adipose tissue only accounts for 10% of the insulin-mediated whole body glucose uptake (10Smith U.

This suggests that the LXRs are important regulators of lipid metabolism, in addition to their roles as regulators of cholesterol homeostasis. Earlier studies have shown that the transcription of GLUT4 in adipocytes is induced by ligands that activate PPARγ (37Wu Z. Xie Y. Morrison R.F. Bucher N.L. Farmer S.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and that the reduced levels of GLUT4 in adipose tissue in animal models of diabetes is normalized by treatment with PPARγ activators (38Hofmann C.

Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 172-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Furthermore, activation of LXRs in adipose tissue increases basal glucose uptake (40Ross S.E. Erickson R.L. Gerin I. DeRose P.M. Bajnok L. Longo K.A. Misek D.E. Kuick R. Hanash S.M. Atkins K.B. Andresen S.M. Nebb H.I. Madsen L. Kristiansen K. MacDougald O.A. Mol. Cell.

Jacinto S. Ulven S.M. Bamberg K. Gustafsson J.-Å. Nebb H.I. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 172-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Since all of these factors pointed to a role of LXRs in the regulation of glucose metabolism, we initiated a study to determine whether genes involved in this pathway are regulated by LXRs. Here we demonstrate that the adipose tissue expression of GLUT4 is directly regulated by both LXRα and LXRβ upon ligand stimulation but that the basal expression of GLUT4 is selectively dependent on the LXRα isoform. In view of the recently proposed antidiabetic effects of LXRs (41Cao G. Liang Y. Broderick C.L. Oldham B.A. Beyer T.P. Schmidt R.J. Zhang Y. Stayrook K.R. Suen C. Otto K.A. Miller A.R. Dai J. Foxworthy P. Gao H. Ryan T.P. Jiang X.C. Burris T.P. Eacho P.I. Etgen G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1131-1136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), this work supports such a role for LXRs, since we now demonstrate a direct link between LXRα and a gene that is down-regulated in diabetic and insulin-resistant conditions. Materials—All restriction enzymes were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). All cell culture plastic ware was obtained from Corning Inc. Media (D6546 and D6421), oligonucleotides, and other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. EMSAs and Northern blots were analyzed by phosphorimaging (ImageQuant™ software; Amersham Biosciences). The pCMX, pCMX-RXRα, and pCMX-LXRα expression vectors (29Venkateswaran A. Repa J.J. Lobaccaro J.M. Bronson A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14700-14707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) were a gift from D. J. Mangelsdorf (Dallas, TX). Darglitazone and T0901317 were obtained from AstraZeneca (Mölndal, Sweden). Culturing of Cells—COS-1 and 3T3-L1 cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Integro, Dieren, Holland; lot 5-80301), 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were handled as described (42Tobin K.A. Steineger H.H. Alberti S. Spydevold O. Auwerx J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Nebb H.I. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 741-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and were not allowed to grow confluent prior to experiments. 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated into adipocytes by the addition of adipogenic factors (23Willy P.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) with some adjustments. Preadipocytes were seeded at passage 6–8, grown 1–2 days postconfluence, and exposed to adipogenic medium (0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 0.1 μm dexamethazone, and 1 μg/ml insulin) for 3 days and then medium containing insulin (1 μg/ml) for 3 days, followed by an additional 7 days with regular medium to obtain mature adipocytes (day 13). Human (SGBS) cells were cultured and differentiated into adipocytes essentially as described (43Wabitsch M. Brenner R.E. Melzner I. Braun M. Moller P. Heinze E. Debatin K.M. Hauner H. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 2001; 25: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were subcultured in basal medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mix F-12 (D6421) supplemented with 4 mg of biotin, 2 g of d-pantothenate, 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) supplemented with 10% noninactivated fetal calf serum (10270-106; Invitrogen). For adipocyte differentiation, cells were seeded at low passage 6–10, grown into confluence, and exposed to adipogenic medium (Quickdiff; 3FC supplemented with 25 nm dexamethazone, 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, and 2 μm rosiglitazone), followed by continuous culturing in 3FC (basal medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml human transferrin, 20 nm insulin, 100 nm cortisol, and 0.2 nm T3). Cells were given fresh medium twice a week until experiments were started at days 15–17. Preparation and Analysis of RNA—Total RNA was extracted with TRIZOL® Reagent (Invitrogen), and 10–20 μg of total RNA was used for Northern blotting. Hybridization and stripping of membranes (Hybond-N; Amersham Biosciences) were performed as recommended (PT1200-1; Clontech). Membranes were probed with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences)-radiolabeled cDNAs synthesized using a multiple DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). Human (h) and mouse (m) probes used were h-GLUT4, h-LXRα, h-PPARγ, h-SREBP-1, h-FAS, m-GLUT4, m-aFABP, m-L27, and m-36B4. Cloning of the GLUT4 cDNA and Probe—The mouse GLUT4 cDNA and the human GLUT4 probe were generated by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from total RNA isolated from differentiated 3T3-L1 and SGBS cells, respectively, using the ImProm-II™ reverse transcription system (Promega) with an oligo(dT)16 primer, followed by a PCR (30 cycles) with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The obtained PCR fragments were cloned into the pPCR-Script vector using the PCR-Script™ Amp cloning kit (Stratagene). PCR fragments obtained by a second PCR amplification from these vectors were used for labeling reactions in Northern analysis. The following primers were used to amplify the mouse GLUT4 CDS (accession number BC014282, nucleotides 111–1770): 5′-mGLUT4-CDS (5′-TAGAATTCCCCGGACCCTATACCCTATTCATTT-3′) and 3′-mGLUT4-CDS (5′-TAGGATCCGCTGTAGAGGAAAGGAGGGAGTCT-G-3′) and the human GLUT4 probe 5′-hGLUT4 probe (5′-CCATTGTT-ATCGGCATTCTGATCG-3′) and 3′-hGLUT4-probe (5′-ATAGCCTC-CGCAACATACTGGAAAC-3′). Cloning and Mutagenesis of the GLUT4 Promoter—A previously described nucleotide sequence for the human GLUT4 promoter (accession number M61126) was used as a bait in a BLAST search against htgs sequences at NCBI to identify a longer 5′-upstream sequence (annealed to accession number AC003688). The mouse GLUT4 promoter was identified with the full-length mouse GLUT4 mRNA as bait (accession number BC014282 annealed to accession number AL596185.8). For both promoters, the promoter sequence spanning 10,000 bp up- and downstream from the transcription start site was extracted and analyzed using a consensus LXRE (DGGTYA HWHW MGKKCA) generated by the GCG program (Wisconsin Package version 10.0, Genetics Computer Group (GCG), Madison, WI) to localize potential LXR response elements. The full-length GLUT4 promoter was amplified by PCR with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) from human genomic DNA (6550-1; Clontech) with primers selected by the Primer3 program (51Rozen S. Skaletsky H.J. Krawetz S. Misener S. Bioinformatics Methods and Protocols: Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000: 365-386Google Scholar) (primers were 5′-h-GLUT4-promoter (TAAGATCTCTGTGCTGGAACTCAGGGATCA) and 3′-h-GLUT4-promoter (TAAGATCTTCGGAGCCTATCTGTTGGAAGC)). The promoter was amplified in a 100-μl PCR mixture (100–500 ng of template, 1× cloned Pfu buffer, 200 μm each dNTP, 2.5 units of Pfu Turbo polymerase, and 20 pmol of each primer) in a long cycled PCR (2 min at 95 °C; 1 min at 95 °C, 45 sec at 60 °C (2 min/1000 bp) at 72 °C for 30 cycles; 10 min at 72 °C). The amplified promoter fragment was inserted into the pPCR-Script vector (Stratagene) prior to insertion into the BglII site in the pGL3-Basic luciferase reporter vector (Promega). The GLUT4 SmaI deletion reporter was made by restriction cutting of the full-length reporter with SmaI followed by religation of the vector. The mutation of the LXRE element in the human GLUT4 reporter was introduced by employing the mutated oligonucleotides used in the EMSA (Fig. 5A) as mutation-targeting primers. 10 ng of the full-length GLUT4 reporter was amplified in a 50-μl PCR mixture (1× cloned Pfu buffer, 200 μm each dNTP, 2.5 units of Pfu Turbo polymerase, and 15 pmol/each mutation oligonucleotide) in a long cycled PCR reaction (2 min at 95 °C; 45 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, 15 min at 68 °C for 20 cycles). Following PCR, the PCR mixture was treated with DpnI (1 unit) at 37 °C for 1 h and transformed into supercompetent cells. Positive clones were identified by restriction analysis and verified by sequencing. Transfection, Luciferase Assay, and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—For reporter gene assays, COS-1 cells were transiently transfected in six-well dishes with luciferase reporters (5 μg) and co-transfected with pCMX-RXRα, pCMX-LXRα (1 μg each), and pSV-β-galactosidase (3 μg) expression vectors with calcium phosphate precipitation (42Tobin K.A. Steineger H.H. Alberti S. Spydevold O. Auwerx J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Nebb H.I. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 741-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Total DNA concentration was adjusted to 12 μg with corresponding empty expression vectors and pGL3-basic vector. Differentiated human SGBS cells were transfected (12 wells) with reporters (800 ng) and pTK Renilla luciferase (80 ng) with LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Total DNA concentration was adjusted to 1.0 μg by the addition of pGL3-basic vector. After 3 h of transfection, medium containing appropriate reagents was added for 48 h. Cells were harvested in 100 μl lysis buffer, and luciferase activities were measured using the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega). For preparation of nuclear extract, COS-1 cells were transfected in 10-cm dishes with 20 μg of vector mixed with 70 μl of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) in 10 ml of serum and antibiotic-free medium for 6 h, followed by 48-h incubation in 20 ml of medium containing serum and antibiotics. Nuclear extracts from 3T3-L1 and transfected cells were isolated according to Ref. 44Caruccio L. Banerjee R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 230: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, except that the proteinase inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was replaced with 2× Complete (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentrations were measured by a BC assay (Interchim, Montlucon, France). Unprogrammed reticulocyte lysate and murine RXRα and human LXRα proteins were synthesized in vitro from pCMX, pCMX-mRXRα, and pCMX-hLXRα expression vectors, respectively, using a TNT-T7 quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). The oligonucleotide probes (for sequences, see Fig. 4A) were labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and purified on ProbeQuant G50 Micro columns (Amersham Biosciences). Binding reactions and separation of the protein-DNA complexes from free probes were performed by using a modified version of a previously published protocol (26Lehmann J.M. Kliewer S.A. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Oliver B.B. Su J.L. Sundseth S.S. Winegar D.A. Blanchard D.E. Spencer T.A. Willson T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3137-3140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). For in vitro translated proteins, binding reactions were performed in a 20-μl reaction mixture (40 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 6% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 μg of single-stranded DNA, and 4 μl of in vitro translated lysate). Nuclear extract binding reactions were performed in a 20-μl reaction mixture (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20 mm KCl, 4% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 4 μl nuclear extract). Binding reactions were preincubated on ice for 15 min before the addition of 1 μl of double-stranded 32P-labeled probe (80–800 fmol; 20,000–100,000 cpm) followed by 20 min of incubation at room temperature. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 4.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 1× EMSA buffer (25 mm Trisma base (pH 8.5), 190 mm glycine and 1 mm EDTA) at 180 V for 3.5 h at 4 °C. Animal Experiments—All animal use was approved and registered by the Norwegian Animal Research authority and the regional ethical committee for animal experiments in Sweden. Male C57BL/6J mice, 10 weeks of age (25–30 g) (B & K Universal Ltd., Sollentuna, Sweden), LXRα-/-β+/+, LXRα+/+β-/-, LXRα-/-β-/-, and wild-type (LXRα+/+β+/+) control mice (7–9 weeks) were maintained in a temperature-controlled (22 °C) facility with a strict 12-h light/dark cycle and given free access to food and water. The generation of the LXRα-/-β+/+ and LXRα+/+β-/- mice has been described previously (45Alberti S. Schuster G. Parini P. Feltkamp D. Diczfalusy U. Rudling M. Angelin B. Bjorkhem I. Pettersson S.

All transgenic mice used in this study, LXRα-/-β+/+, LXRα+/+β-/-, LXRα-/-β-/-, and wild-type (LXRα+/+β+/+) control mice, had mixed genetic backgrounds based on 129/Sv and C57BL/6J strains, backcrossed in C57BL/6J mice for three generations. In the 24-h feeding experiment, mice were gavage-fed twice (24 and 8 h before the mice were sacrificed) using 50 mg/kg T0901317 or 1 mg/kg darglitazone in a vehicle containing 1% carboxymethyl-cellulose (Sigma). Control mice received vehicle only. In the experiments including insulin injections, the mice were first fed twice with T0901317 (30 mg/kg) as described above and then injected with PBS (as a control) or insulin as a single 0.2-unit injection (intraperitoneally) of Actrapid insulin (Novo Nordisk, Bagsværd, Denmark) 3 h before they were sacrificed. For the 1-week feeding experiment, the mice were fed orally once a day with darglitazone (1 mg/kg) or T0901317 (30 mg/kg). For all in vivo experiments, tissues were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70 °C"

Most studies have focused on the role of glycation products in vascular complications. Here, we have investigated the action of human glycated albumin (HGA) on insulin signaling in L6 skeletal muscle cells. Exposure of these cells to HGA inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and glycogen synthase activity by 95 and 80%, respectively. These effects were time- and dose-dependent, reaching a maximum after 12 h incubation with 0.1 mg/ml HGA. In contrast, exposure of the cells to HGA had no effect on thymidine incorporation. Further, HGA reduced insulin-stimulated serine phosphorylation of PKB and GSK3, but did not alter ERK1/2 activation. HGA did not affect either insulin receptor kinase activity or insulin-induced Shc phosphorylation on tyrosine. In contrast, insulin-dependent IRS-1 and IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation was severely reduced in cells preincubated with HGA for 24 h. Insulin-stimulated association of PI3K with IRS-1 and IRS-2, and PI3K activity were reduced by HGA in parallel with the changes in IRS tyrosine phosphorylation, while Grb2-IRS association was unchanged. In L6 myotubes, exposure to HGA increased PKC activity by 2-fold resulting in a similar increase in Ser/Thr phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2. These phosphorylations were blocked by the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide (BDM). BDM also blocked the action of HGA on insulin-stimulated PKB and GSK3α. Simultaneously, BDM rescued insulin-stimulation of glucose uptake and glycogen synthase activity in cells exposed to HGA. The use of antibodies specific to PKC isoforms shows that this effect appears to be mediated by activated PKCα, independent of reactive oxygen species production. In summary, in L6 skeletal muscle cells, exposure to HGA leads to insulin resistance selectively in glucose metabolism with no effect on growth-related pathways regulated by the hormone.

Resistance to insulin action is a common abnormality present in major human diseases such as diabetes mellitus and obesity. Insulin resistance in diabetes is genetically determined, but its incidence is also affected by environmental conditions and by factors secondary to diabetes itself (7Kahn B.B. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar). These acquired and secondary factors further impair insulin action in the diabetic individual. For instance, chronic hyperglycemia per se promotes insulin resistance (8Hager S.R. Jochen A.L. Kalkhoff R.K. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 1991; 260: E353-E362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Davidson M.B. Bouch C. Venkatesan N. Karjala R.G. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 267: E808-E813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain hyperglycemia-induced insulin resistance. These include abnormalities in the PKC signaling system (10Idris I. Gray S. Donnelly R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 967: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and activation of the NF-κB transcription factors by chronically elevated glucose concentrations (11Yerneni K.K. Bai W. Khan B.V. Medford R.M. Natarajan R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 855-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 12Nishikawa T. Edelstein D. Du X.L. Yamagishi S. Matsumura T. Kaneda Y. Yorek M.A. Beebe D. Oates P.J. Hammes H.P. Giardino I. Brownlee M. Nature. 2000; 404: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3583) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism(s) through which hyperglycemia exacerbates insulin resistance in diabetes have only partially been elucidated. An additional deleterious effect of chronic hyperglycemia is the increased production of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Chronic high intracellular glucose concentrations cause an increase in both intracellular and extracellular AGEs (13Degenhardt T.P. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 44: 1139-1145PubMed Google Scholar, 14Brownlee M. Metabolism. 2000; 49: 9-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). AGE precursors are formed by several reactions including intracellular auto-oxidation of glucose to glyoxal (15Wells-Knecht K.J. Zyzak D.V. Litchfield J.E. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3702-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) and breakdown of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate to methylglyoxal (16Thornalley P.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). AGEs are generated through the interaction of these intracellular α-dicarbonyl precursors with the amino groups of both intra- and extracellular proteins (17Brownlee M. Nature. 2001; 414: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (6864) Google Scholar). Chronic hyperglycemia also leads to the production of Amadori products through the nonenzymatic glycation reactions between glucose and reactive amino groups of serum proteins. Depending on the protein turnover rate and glucose concentration, these Amadori products undergo further irreversible reactions to form AGEs. The modifications of proteins that lead to their glycation induce alterations in their biological properties as compared with their non-glycated counterparts. Several studies have shown that elevated concentrations of Amadori products such as glycated albumin are associated with diabetic atherogenesis by activating vascular smooth muscle cells (18Hattori Y. Suzuki M. Hattori S. Kasai K. Hypertension. 2002; 39: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Glycated albumin has also been implicated in the development of diabetic retinopathy (19Ruggiero-Lopez D. Rellier N. Lecomte M. Lagarde M. Wiernsperger N. Diabetes Res. Clin.

Friedrichs U. Eichler W. Rosenthal A. Wiedemann P. Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol. 2002; 240: 996-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Finally, glycated albumin has been shown to participitate in the development of diabetic nephropathy by the induction of the cellular formation of cytokines and growth factors (23Makita Z. Yanagisawa K. Kuwajima S. Yoshioka N. Atsumi T. Hasunuma Y. Koike T. J. Diabetes Complic. 1995; 9: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which may themselves contribute to diabetic renal disease (24Flyvbjerg A.

Glycated albumin and AGEs exert their effects through specific cellular receptors found in different cell types and through the activation of several signaling pathways (25Schmidt A.M. Yan S.D. Yan S.F. Stern D.M. Biochim. Biophy. Acta, Mol. Cell Res. 2000; 1498: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 26Wu V.-Y. Shearman C.W. Cohen M.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 602-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, glycated albumin-receptor binding elicits a signal transduction pathway leading to the generation of oxygen free radicals. These reactive oxygen species activate the redox-sensitive transcription factor NF-κB (18Hattori Y. Suzuki M. Hattori S. Kasai K. Hypertension. 2002; 39: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), a pleiotropic regulator of many genes. Recently, Naitoh et al. (27Naitoh T. Kitahara M. Tsuruzoe N. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) demonstrated that, in human monocytic cells, glycated albumin induces the release of TNF-α, a factor involved in insulin resistance (28Peraldi P. Spiegelman B. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1998; 182: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Although glycated albumin has been linked to the vascular complications of diabetes, it is presently unclear whether exposure to glycated albumin induces resistance to insulin and at which step in the insulin-signaling cascade this may occur. We hypothesized that glycated albumin may be involved in the modulation of insulin signaling and hence in the generation of insulin resistance. To investigate this hypothesis, we analyzed the action of human glycated albumin (HGA) on insulin signaling in L6 skeletal muscle cells. We demonstrated that, in these cells, exposure to human glycated albumin selectively inhibits the PI3K/PKB branch of the insulin signaling cascade, while leaving the Ras-ERK pathway and mitogenic action of the hormone unaltered. Mechanistically, HGA-mediated PI3K/PKB inhibition is dependent on a PKCα-mediated serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS-1/2 proteins that leads to a strong decrease in insulin-regulated metabolic responses, such as glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis. Interestingly, activation of PKCα by chronic HGA treatment appears to be independent of ROS production. Thus, by deregulating intracellular insulin signaling, human glycated albumin exacerbates the insulin-resistant state. General—Media and sera for tissue culture were from Invitrogen. Phospho-PKB, phospho-ERK, IRS-1, and IRS-2 antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly MA). PI3K and phospho-GSK-3 antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc.

Characterization of Glycated Human Serum Albumin—Glycated and nonglycated human serum albumin were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. The glycated serum albumin contained 2.7–3.5 mol of fructosamine per mol of albumin. The human glycated and nonglycated albumin preparations were tested for (i) fluorescent advanced glycation end products concentrations, determined by fluorescence assays (from 360 to 600 nm) upon excitation at 370 nm or 350 nm (30Pongor S.

Each batch was tested for possible insulin-like growth factor-I contamination by IGF-I-D-RIA-CT (BioSource Europe, Nivelles, Belgium) and the absence of endotoxin (LPS) by the use of Limulus amebocyte lysates assay (Sigma). Each human glycated albumin batch was reconstituted at 10 mg/ml with sterile PBS, and in order to avoid glycoxydation, immediately thereafter frozen at —30 °C until use (34Smith P.R. Thornalley P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 729-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—The L6 skeletal muscle cells were plated (6 × 103 cells/cm2) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 2% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C, in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% (v/v) CO2. Under these culture conditions, L6 myoblasts spontaneously differentiate into myotubes upon confluence. For PKC inhibition studies, cells were pretreated with 100 nm BDM for 30 min followed by combined pretreatment with HGA and BDM. Unless otherwise stated all experiments were performed with L6 cells at the myotube stage of differentiation. Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were solubilized for 20 min at 4 °C with lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.4, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (TAT buffer). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and aliquots were either directly separated by SDS-PAGE or incubated with the indicated antibodies for 18 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were then precipitated with protein A beads, and resuspended in Laemmli buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted on Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked for 1 h in TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl), containing 4% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and then incubated with the indicated antibodies. Detection of blotted proteins was performed by ECL according to the manufacturer's instruction. In Vivo Phosphorylation Experiments—Myotubes pretreated or not with HGA for 24 h were washed twice with phosphate-free DMEM and labeled for 12 h in this medium containing 500 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate (1.7 mCi/ml). At the end of labeling, after three washes with ice-cold PBS, proteins were solubilized for 15 min at 4 °C in TAT buffer. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-IRS-1 or IRS-2 antibodies. Immunocomplexes were washed four times with solubilization buffer, boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. For KOH treatment, the gels were incubated for 1 h at 55 °C in 1 m KOH as described (35Scimeca J.C. Ballotti R. Nguyen T.T. Filloux C. Van Obberghen E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9313-9319Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). [32P]orthophosphate-labeled IRS-1/2 fractions were detected with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and quantified (ImageQuant software). 2-Deoxy-d-glucose Uptake, Glycogen Synthase Activity, and Thymidine Incorporation Assays—These assays were performed in L6 myotubes as described in (36Hajduch E. Alessi D.R. Hemmings B.A. Hundal H.S. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated in serum-free α-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 24 h in the presence or absence of 0.1 mg/ml HGA. Cells were incubated in glucose-free 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgSO4, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2 (HEPES buffer) and then exposed or not to 100 nm insulin for 10 min. Glucose uptake was measured by incubating cells with 20 μm 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose (1 μCi/assay) for 10 min in HEPES buffer. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 μm cytochalasin B, and the cells were washed three times with ice-cold isotonic saline solution prior to lysis in 0.1 m NaOH. Incorporated radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. Glycogen synthase activity was assayed by a modification of the described method (36Hajduch E. Alessi D.R. Hemmings B.A. Hundal H.S. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Briefly, L6 myotubes were incubated in HEPES buffer for 3 h before the assay, the cells were then stimulated with 100 nm insulin, resuspended in 10 mm EDTA and sonicated for 10 s at 300 watts. The cell suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 2,000 × g, and 20-μl aliquots of the supernatants (20 μg of cell protein) were added to 60 μl of a reaction mixture containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 25 mm NaF, 20 mm EDTA, 10 mg/ml glycogen, and 7.2 mm uridine 5′-diphosphate-glucose (UDPG) and 0.05 mCi [14C]UDPG in the absence or the presence of 6.7 mm glucose 6-phosphate. The supernatant reaction mixture was incubated for 20 min at 30 °C and terminated by spotting on p81 phosphocellulose filter followed by precipitation with ice-cold ethanol, and the radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation. Enzyme activity was expressed as percent of the glucose-6-phosphate independent form (% I form). Thymidine incorporation assays were performed as previously described (37Formisano P. Sohn K. Miele C. Di Finizio B. Petruzziello A. Riccardi G. Beguinot L. Beguinot F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a plating density of 105 cells/well. After 24 h, the culture medium was replaced with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in the presence or absence of HGA, as specified for an additional 24 h. 100 nm insulin and [3H]thymidine were added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 16 h. Kinase Assays—L6 myotubes were deprived of serum for 24 h in the presence or absence of HGA and then exposed to 100 nm insulin for 10 min. For PI3K assays, after insulin stimulation, the cells were solubilized for 30 min at 4 °C in TAT buffer. After lysate clarification by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, aliquots of the lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-IRS-1 or anti-IRS-2 antibodies coupled to protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. PI3K activity was determined in IRS-1/2 immunoprecipitates as described in Filippa et al. (38Filippa N. Sable C.L. Filloux C. Hemmings B. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4989-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). For PKB assays, after insulin stimulation, the cells were solubilized for 30 min at 4 °C in TAT buffer. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and PKB was immunoprecipitated using antibodies to PKB. The immune complexes were washed and assayed for PKB activity using Crosstide substrate as previously described (38Filippa N. Sable C.L. Filloux C. Hemmings B. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4989-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). PKC activity was assayed as previously described (29Formisano P. Oriente F. Fiory F. Caruso M. Miele C. Maitan M.A. Andreozzi F. Vigliotta G. Condorelli G. Beguinot F. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 6323-6333Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were solubilized in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 μg/ml leupeptin. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min and then supplemented with lipid activators (10 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, 0.28 mg/ml phosphatidylserine and 4 mg/ml dioleine, final concentrations). Phosphorylation reactions were initiated by addition of 50 μm acetylated myelin basic protein (residues 4–14) substrate in 4 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm CaCl2, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of (3,000 Ci/mmol) [γ-32P]ATP per ml (final concentrations). The reaction mixtures were further incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and then rapidly cooled on ice and spotted onto phosphocellulose discs. Disc-bound radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. PKC activity was calculated by subtracting the nonspecific kinase activity obtained in the absence of lipid activators. Activity of the specific PKC isoforms was assayed as described above, after immunoprecipitation using specific PKC isoform antibodies. Assay for Reactive Oxygen Species Production—Intracellular production of ROS was measured by CM-DCF fluorescence as described (39Maziere C. Floret S. Santus R. Morliere P. Marcheux V. Maziere J.-C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 629-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The cells were treated with H2O2 (500 μm) for 15 min in the absence or presence of the antioxidant PDTC (200 μm), and then exposed to 10—5m CM-DCF in phosphate buffered saline for 45 min. The cells were washed three times in PBS, solubilized in H20, and sonicated. The fluorescence was determined at 503/529 nm, normalized on a protein basis and expressed as percentages of control. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as means ± S.D. Statistical significance was evaluated using the Student's t test for unpaired comparison. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Physicochemical Properties of HGA—Table I summarizes the physicochemical properties of the human glycated albumin used in this report. We find that HGA does not contain measurable amounts of fluorescent advanced glycation end products. The CML concentrations observed in our HGA preparations are lower than the level of CML observed in diabetic plasma (32.6 ± 8.3 μg CML/ml) (40Xu B. Chibber R. Ruggerio D. Kohner E. Ritter J. Ferro A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1289-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Nagai et al. (41Nagai R. Matsumoto K. Ling X. Suzuki H. Araki T. Horiuchi S. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1714-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) have observed that methylglyoxal and glyoxal preferentially modified arginine rather than lysine residues. To detect the presence of modified aldehyde in human albumin, the extent of lysine and arginine modifications in human glycated and nonglycated albumin were determined. The results obtained are summarized in Table I and show the absence of significant modifications in the extent of free lysine and arginine residues between the two preparations. Lastly, the batches were found not to contain IGF-I and to be bacterial endotoxin-free. To summarize, the physicochemical properties determined for our HGA preparation demonstrate that this preparation does not contain significant AGEs products and that therefore the effects observed in L6 myotubes after 24 h of preincubation with 0.1 mg/ml of HGA are the consequence of glycated albumin present essentially as a glycated Amadori product.Table IPhysicochemical properties of glycated human albuminNon-glycated human albuminGlycated human albuminFluorescent AGEsUndetectableUndetectableCML/mg protein60 ng170 ngLys modification (%)10091.9 ± 5.2Arg modification (%)10098.6 ± 0.5IGF-1UndetectableUndetectableLPSUndetectableUndetectable Open table in a new tab Effect of HGA on Insulin Action—Insulin-resistant states are associated with alterations affecting glucose metabolism of muscle cells (42Kurowski T.

Diabetes. 2000; 49: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To determine whether HGA could induce insulin resistance in L6 myotubes, the effect of preincubation for 24 h with 0–0.2 mg/ml HGA on glucose transport was studied. Control cells were treated with nonglycated albumin. In control myotubes not treated with HGA or treated for 24 h with 0.1 mg/ml HA, insulin induced a 2-fold 2-DG uptake. HGA decreased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in a dose-dependent manner without affecting basal glucose uptake. Maximal inhibition was achieved starting from 0.1 mg/ml HGA (Fig. 1A). To study the time course for HGA-induced insulin resistance in myotubes, cells were preincubated with 0.1 mg/ml HGA for 0–24 h. Insulin-induced glucose uptake was reduced by 60 and 75% upon HGA incubation for 4 and 8 h, respectively (decreases significant at the p < 0.001 level). A 12-h preincubation with 0.1 mg/ml HGA completely abolished insulin stimulation of 2-DG uptake in L6 myotubes, an inhibition conserved for at least 12 additional hours (Fig. 1B). Glycogen synthase activation by insulin was also inhibited by preincubation with HGA (300% increase in the absence of HGA and only 50% upon 24 h HGA preincubation, as shown in Fig. 1C). Similar to 2-DG uptake, the HGA-induced inhibition of glycogen synthase activation was also time- and dose-dependent, reaching a maximum after 12 h of exposure (data not shown). On the"

To cleave the β-1,4-linkages between β-d-galactose and α-l-3,6-anhydro-galactose residues in the red algal galactans known as agars, marine bacteria produce polysaccharide hydrolases called β-agarases. β-Agarases A and B from Zobellia galactanivorans Dsij have recently been biochemically characterized. Here we report the first crystal structure of these two β-agarases. The two proteins were overproduced in Escherichia coli and crystallized, and the crystal structures were determined at 1.48 and 2.3 A for β-agarases A and B, respectively. The structure of β-agarase A was solved by the multiple anomalous diffraction method, whereas β-agarase B was solved with molecular replacement using β-agarase A as model. Their structures adopt a jelly roll fold with a deep active site channel harboring the catalytic machinery, namely the nucleophilic residues Glu-147 and Glu-184 and the acid/base residues Glu-152 and Glu-189 for β-agarases A and B, respectively. The structures of the agarases were compared with those of two lichenases and of a κ-carrageenase, which all belong to family 16 of the glycoside hydrolases in order to pinpoint the residues responsible for their widely differing substrate specificity. The relationship between structure and enzymatic activity of the two β-agarases from Z. galactanivorans Dsij was studied by analysis of the degradation products starting with different oligosaccharides. The combination of the structural and biochemical results allowed the determination of the number of subsites present in the catalytic cleft of the β-agarases."

Indeed, a slow ATP hydrolysis activity has been detected in Hsp90 (29Panaretou B. Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H.

Mechanistic explanations of how ATP binding and hydrolysis are coupled to Hsp90 activity have been hindered, however, by the lack of any observed change in the conformation of the N-domain in response to ligands. The crystal structures of the Hsp90 N-domain, either in the apo form or in complex with ATP, ADP, and inhibitors such as geldanamycin, radicicol, and others are essentially superimposable (15Prodromou C.

However, the manner in which N- and C-domains associate across the flexible linker and the interfaces participating in oligomerization remain unknown. Interactions with co-chaperones may also be important catalysts for ATP hydrolysis in Hsp90s from some species as well (34Panaretou B. Siligardi G. Meyer P. Maloney A. Sullivan J.K. Singh S. Millson S.H. Clarke P.A. Naaby-Hansen S. Stein R. Cramer R. Mollapour M. Workman P. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Mol.

Although GRP94 responds to ansamycin inhibitors in a manner analogous to Hsp90, indicating ligand regulation (35Supino-Rosin L. Yoshimura A. Yarden Y. Elazar Z. Neumann D. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 22798-22805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), nor have co-chaperones or partner proteins been identified for this paralog. Domains of Hsp90 and GRP94 also do not functionally substitute for one another (10Randow F. Seed B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 891-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In addition, although Hsp90 binds ADP/ATP with micromolar affinity (15Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar), the binding constant for these ligands to GRP94 is estimated to be several millimolar (38Rosser M.F. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22798-22805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The difference in ligand regulation between GRP94 and Hsp90 is further highlighted by their interactions with 5′-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA), 1The abbreviations used are: NECA5′-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine2ClddA2-chlorodideoxyadenosineGSTglutathione S-transferaseDTTdithiothreitolPEGpolyethylene glycolr.m.s.root mean square.1The abbreviations used are: NECA5′-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine2ClddA2-chlorodideoxyadenosineGSTglutathione S-transferaseDTTdithiothreitolPEGpolyethylene glycolr.m.s.root mean square. a broad-spectrum adenosine A2 receptor antagonist. Biochemical screens for NECA-binding activity identified GRP94 as the prominent cellular target of this ligand, with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 200 nm (39Hutchison K.A. Nevins B. Perini F. Fox I.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5138-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 40Hutchison K.A. Fox I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19898-19903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NECA has no detectable binding affinity for cytoplasmic Hsp90s, however (38Rosser M.F. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22798-22805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).The functional differences between GRP94 and Hsp90 underscore the fact that many aspects of hsp90 biology remain to be addressed, including the mechanism of selective regulation of the cellular paralogs, the role of ATP in GRP94 where ATP hydrolysis has proven difficult to detect, and the structural basis for tertiary interactions between hsp90 domains and quaternary associations between intact chaperones. To understand the mechanism for selective ligand responsiveness in GRP94, we have solved the structure of the N-domain of GRP94 in complex with the GRP94-specific ligand NECA, as well as with the high affinity but non-selective ligands radicicol and 2-chlorodideoxyadenosine (2ClddA). We show that an intrinsic conformational difference between cytoplasmic Hsp90 and GRP94 accounts for selectivity in ligand binding. We also show that the 5′ substituent of NECA occupies a previously unidentified second pocket adjacent to the adenosine-binding cavity. This structural difference arises in large part from a 5-amino acid insertion unique to GRP94 whose structural role until now has been unknown. These structures also identify a subdomain within the N-domain that has the potential to act as a ligandresponsive conformational switch in GRP94. Finally, to understand the structural relationship between the N- and C-domains of GRP94, the constructs we used for crystallization have included the charged region. We show here that this region forms a disordered loop whose end returns, surprisingly, to form an ordered, stable interaction with the body of the N-domain. This provides evidence for an intimate interaction between the N- and C-domains of the protein.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Purification—Canine GRP94 (residues 69–337) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli as a GST fusion. BL21(DE3)pLysS cells harboring the expression plasmid were grown to an A600 of 1 at 37 °C and induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. The cells were harvested after 3 more h of shaking, and the cell pellet was lysed in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 350 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride by three passes through a Microfluidics M110L homogenizer. The cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 25,000 × g, and the supernatant was applied to a column of glutathione-agarose (Sigma) in lysis buffer. GST-GRP94-(69–337) was eluted with a buffer containing 10 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT. The fusion protein was diluted to 2.5 mg/ml and cleaved by the addition of thrombin (Hematologic Technologies) at an enzyme:protein ratio of 1:1000 (w/w) for 3.0 h at room temperature while being dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT. The cleaved mixture was applied to a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a 50–600 mm NaCl gradient in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm DTT. The fractions containing intact GRP94-(69–337) were combined and concentrated in a Centriprep-10 (Millipore) and further purified by gel filtration (Superdex 75, Amersham Biosciences) and high performance ion exchange (Resource Q, Amersham Biosciences) chromatography, both in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, buffers. Purified GRP94-(69–337) was concentrated by ultrafiltration in a Millipore Ultrafree 4–30 mg/ml, buffer exchanged into 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and stored in small aliquots at -80 °C. GRP94-(69–337Δ40) was purified in a similar manner, except that the final Resource Q step was omitted.Ligands and Protein·Ligand Complexes—NECA and radicicol were purchased from Sigma. 2-Chlorodideoxyadenosine (2ClddA) was obtained from the Open Chemical Repository of the Drug Therapeutics Program at the NCI, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). GRP94-(69–337)·ligand complexes were prepared by adding a 3- to 5-fold molar excess of concentrated ligand (10–50 mm) in Me2SO to the 30 mg/ml protein solution and used without further purification.Crystallization and Data Collection—GRP94-(69–337)·ligand complexes were crystallized at 18 °C by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Two μl of protein·ligand complex was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution, which consisted of 100 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 200–300 mm MgCl2, and 35–45% PEG 400 for the NECA, 2ClddA, and Δ40 complexes. The reservoir for the radicicol complex was the same except that PEG 550 monomethylether was substituted for PEG 400. Diffraction quality crystals with typical dimensions of 0.6 × 0.2 × 0.1 mm grew in less than 1 week.Crystals of the NECA complex were strengthened by vapor diffusion cross-linking with glutathione following the procedure of Lusty (41Lusty C.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1999; 32: 106-112Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar) using 5 μl of a 25% glutaraldehyde solution in a microbridge for 30 min. Following cross-linking the drop containing the crystals was placed over a fresh reservoir solution containing 100 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 220 mm MgCl2, 43% PEG 400 and gradually stabilized with this solution. Stabilized crystals were removed from the drop in nylon loops and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Crystals of the radicicol and Δ40 complexes were removed directly from the mother liquor and flash frozen in a stream of N2 gas cooled to -170 °C. Crystals of the 2ClddA complex were equilibrated into reservoir solution that had been supplemented with glycerol to a final concentration of 20%, removed from the drop in loops and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.Diffraction data sets used to obtain initial phases for the NECA complex were collected at 113 K on a home source using CuKα x-rays. High resolution data were collected at 100 K on beamlines 19BM or 14-IDB at the Advanced Photon Source using charge-coupled device detectors. All data was indexed and reduced using HKL2000 (42Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar).Structure Determination and Refinement—The structures of the GRP94-(69–337)·ligand complexes were solved by molecular replacement with CNS (43Brunger A.T.

Initial phases for the NECA complex were obtained by molecular replacement using a 2.75-Å home source data set processed in space group C2 (Native 1, 97.6% complete, I/σ = 2.2 last shell, Rmerge = 0.057), with the search model consisting of the backbone atoms only of the N-domain of yeast Hsp90 (PDB code 1AMW). The two GRP94 molecules in the asymmetric unit were located sequentially in the translation search. Electron density maps calculated from this solution revealed good density for the model through Hsp90 residue 111 (residue 181 in the GRP94 numbering). Subsequent rounds of simulated annealing refinement and manual rebuilding with O (44Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Final refinement was carried out against a 1.75-Å C2221 data set (Native 3) using a maximum likelihood target, bulk solvent correction, and individual restrained B factor correction. The radicicol and 2ClddA complexes were solved by molecular replacement using the polypeptide from the partially refined NECA complex as the search model and were refined in a manner similar to the NECA complex. The GRP94-(69–337Δ40)-NECA complex, which has two molecules in the asymmetric unit, was solved by molecular replacement using a partially refined P21212 2ClddA complex as the search model, which also has two molecules in the asymmetric unit, and was refined as described above.

The GRP94-(69–337) protein domain was crystallized in the presence of a 5-fold molar excess of ligand. The structure of the GRP94·NECA complex was solved by molecular replacement using the backbone atoms only from the yeast Hsp90·ADP complex (PDB code 1AMW) as the search model and refined against data to the diffraction limit. The GRP94-(69–337)·radicicol and GRP94-(69–337)·2ClddA complexes were solved by molecular replacement using the backbone atoms of the GRP94-(69–337)·NECA complex as the search model. In all three structures the charged domain residues 287–327 were disordered. A portion of an omit electron density map for the NECA complex is shown in Fig. 1. The structure of the charged domain deletion mutant GRP94(69–337Δ40) in complex with NECA was crystallized, solved, and refined in a manner similar to that of the radicicol and 2ClddA complexes.Overall Architecture—The three GRP94-(69–337)·ligand complexes fold into a conformation that closely resembles the N-domains of yeast (32Prodromou C.

As will be discussed later, helices 1, 4, and 5 constitute a subdomain of GRP94 that has a different orientation relative to the remainder of the N-domain than the equivalent region in Hsp90. Excluding this region from the comparison reduces the r.m.s. deviation between GRP94 and Hsp90 to 0.90–1.1 Å for all backbone atoms, indicating a highly similar fold. The 10 residues that make up the adenine-binding cavity (Leu104, Asn107, Ala111, Asp149, Gly153, Met154, Asn162, Gly196, Phe199, and Thr245) are completely conserved between Hsp90 and GRP94 and, with the exception of Gly196, are not in the helix 1-4-5 subdomain. The r.m.s. deviation for just these 10 residues (all atoms) is 0.89 Å with yeast Hsp90 and 1.27 Å with human Hsp90.NECA Binding Is Stabilized by Interaction with Two Adjacent Cavities in GRP94 —NECA is an adenine-based nucleotide analog that binds selectively to GRP94, and not Hsp90, with a KD of 200 nm (38Rosser M.F.

Selective ligands such as NECA may aid in the elucidation of the specific role of GRP94 in the cell and serve as a scaffold for the design of high affinity modulators of GRP94 activity.

https://openalex.org/W2001025517,"We previously demonstrated that a conserved transforming growth factor-β control element (TCE) within the 5′-region of the smooth muscle cell (SMC) differentiation marker gene SM α-actin could mediate both transcriptional activation and repression in cultured SMCs through interaction with members of the zinc finger Kruppel-like transcription factor (KLF) family. The aims of the present studies were to: 1) determine the role of the SM α-actin TCE in vivo through mutagenesis studies in transgenic mice and 2) further characterize the possible role and mechanisms by which the TCE-binding factor GKLF/KLF4 induces repression of SMC marker genes in various SMC model systems in vitro. Our results showed that the TCE was required for SM α-actin promoter activity in transgenic mice in vivo. Results of transient transfection studies showed that GKLF-induced repression of a SM α-actin promoter/luciferase reporter gene partially depended on the TCE. Furthermore, a GKLF overexpressing adenovirus inhibited whereas GKLF morpholino antisense oligos increased expression of endogenous SMC marker genes. Results of chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed GKLF binding to TCE containing regions of various SMC marker gene promoters within intact chromatin. Finally, results of co-transfection studies showed that overexpression of IKLF/KLF5 reversed GKLF-dependent repression thus supporting a model of reciprocal activation-repression of SMC gene expression by different members of the KLF gene family. We previously demonstrated that a conserved transforming growth factor-β control element (TCE) within the 5′-region of the smooth muscle cell (SMC) differentiation marker gene SM α-actin could mediate both transcriptional activation and repression in cultured SMCs through interaction with members of the zinc finger Kruppel-like transcription factor (KLF) family. The aims of the present studies were to: 1) determine the role of the SM α-actin TCE in vivo through mutagenesis studies in transgenic mice and 2) further characterize the possible role and mechanisms by which the TCE-binding factor GKLF/KLF4 induces repression of SMC marker genes in various SMC model systems in vitro. Our results showed that the TCE was required for SM α-actin promoter activity in transgenic mice in vivo. Results of transient transfection studies showed that GKLF-induced repression of a SM α-actin promoter/luciferase reporter gene partially depended on the TCE. Furthermore, a GKLF overexpressing adenovirus inhibited whereas GKLF morpholino antisense oligos increased expression of endogenous SMC marker genes. Results of chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed GKLF binding to TCE containing regions of various SMC marker gene promoters within intact chromatin. Finally, results of co-transfection studies showed that overexpression of IKLF/KLF5 reversed GKLF-dependent repression thus supporting a model of reciprocal activation-repression of SMC gene expression by different members of the KLF gene family.

Little C.D. J. Vasc. Res. 1999; 36: 2-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Moreover, in pathological states such as atherogenesis, restenosis, and hypertension, SMCs “dedifferentiate” by reducing expression of SMC marker genes and increasing their proliferation rate and synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins (2Owens G.K. Atherosclerosis and Coronary Artery Disease. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 401-420Google Scholar). As such, there is considerable interest in identifying extracellular signals, signal transducing molecules and transcription factors involved in regulating SMC differentiation. Many different environmental cues are known to affect SMC differentiation including endothelial cell-SMC interactions, SMC-matrix contacts, mechanical forces, and various cytokines such as platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB), activin, and transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1). Of particular interest, TGF-β1 has been implicated in control of SMC differentiation/proliferation and synthesis of extracellular matrix, processes that are important for blood vessel development/maturation and/or progression of vascular disorders such as atherosclerosis and restenosis after balloon angioplasty (3Owens G.K. Geisterfer A.A. Yang Y.W. Komoriya A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 771-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 4Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (10004) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 has also been shown to induce expression of SMC differentiation marker genes in a variety of cell types in vitro, including multipotent embryonic 10T1/2 cells (5Hirschi K.K. Rohovsky S.A. D'Amore P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), neural crest cells (6Shah N.M. Groves A.K. Anderson D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 331-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar), myofibroblasts (7Desmouliere A. Geinoz A. Gabbiani F. Gabbiani G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar), and pericytes (8Verbeek M.M. Otte-Holler I. Wesseling P. Ruiter D.J. de Waal R.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 372-382PubMed Google Scholar). The spatial and temporal expression pattern of TGF-β1 and TGF-β type II receptor expression in mesenchymal cells is consistent with the possibility that TGF-β1 plays an important role in stimulating vascular development (9Lawler S. Candia A.F. Ebner R. Shum L. Lopez A.R. Moses H.L. Wright C.V. Derynck R. Development. 1994; 120: 165-175PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, targeted disruption of the TGF-β1 gene, or TGF-β receptor genes resulted in early embryonic lethality due to defects in development and/or vascular maturation as manifested by reduced investment of endothelial tubes by presumptive SMCs. For example, 50% of mice deficient in both alleles of TGF-β1 died in utero between 9.5 and 10.5 dpc from abnormalities in yolk sac blood vessel development (10Dickson M.C. Martin J.S. Cousins F.M. Kulkarni A.B. Karlsson S. Akhurst R.J. Development. 1995; 121: 1845-1854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The vessel defects observed included impaired contacts between layers of endothelial and mesenchymal cells. Similarly, disruption of the TGF-β type II receptor caused embryonic lethality around E10.5 due to defects in yolk sac vasculogenesis, including enlargement and reduced SMC investment of yolk sac blood vessels (11Oshima M. Oshima H. Taketo M.M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 179: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Knockout of endoglin, a TGF-β type III receptor, also led to embryonic lethality by 11.5 dpc from defects in angiogenesis including failed VSMC development (12Li D.Y. Sorensen L.K. Brooke B.S. Urness L.D. Davis E.C. Taylor D.G. Boak B.B. Wendel D.P. Science. 1999; 284: 1534-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). However, since the mice with disrupted genes died before SMC differentiation began during embryogenesis, the role of TGF-β in regulating SMC differentiation in vivo remains unclear. smooth muscle cell transforming growth factor TGF-β control element analysis of variance plaque-forming unit chromatin immunoprecipitation assay Kruppel-like transcription factor enhanced green fluorescent protein electrophoretic mobility shift assay cytomegalovirus. In contrast to its clearly documented effect in promoting SMC differentiation in vitro, the role of TGF-β1 in atherogenesis and restenosis is controversial and complex. For example, TGF-β1 is not only released by platelets (13Assoian R.K. Sporn M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1217-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) and macrophages (14Assoian R.K.

A. 1987; 84: 6020-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) at the site of vascular injury, but its mRNA and protein are also elevated in neointimal vascular SMCs following balloon injury to rat carotid arteries (15Majesky M.W. Lindner V. Twardzik D.R. Schwartz S.M. Reidy M.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 88: 904-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 16Nikol S. Isner J.M. Pickering J.G. Kearney M. Leclerc G. Weir L. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 90: 1582-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TGF-β1 expression was shown to be higher in restenotic tissue than in primary plaque tissue from human atherectomy specimens (16Nikol S. Isner J.M. Pickering J.G. Kearney M. Leclerc G. Weir L. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 90: 1582-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In addition, reduction of TGF-β1 levels in the blood vessel wall by neutralizing antibodies led to a small but significant reduction in neointima formation, whereas overexpression of TGF-β1 by adenoviral gene transfer resulted in transient neointima formation (17Wolf Y.G. Rasmussen L.M. Ruoslahti E. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 93: 1172-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it was recently reported that administration of TGF-βs 1, 2, and 3 neutralizing antibody accelerated the development of atherosclerotic lesions in apoE-deficient mice (18Mallat Z. Gojova A. Marchiol-Fournigault C. Esposito B. Kamate C. Merval R. Fradelizi D. Tedgui A. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 930-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Previously our laboratory identified a novel cis-element referred to as TGF-β control element or TCE in the SM α-actin promoter that is highly conserved across species in multiple SMC marker genes including smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SM MHC), SM22α, and h1-calponin (19Hautmann M.B. Madsen C.S. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10948-10956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Mutation of the TCE within the SM22α promoter in transgenic mice showed that the TCE was critical for expression of SM22α in all three muscle types during embryogenesis and in SMC containing tissues in adult mice (20Adam P.J. Regan C.P. Hautmann M.B. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37798-37806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). To identify possible TCE binding factors, a 17.5-day mouse embryo cDNA library was screened with a yeast one-hybrid system, using three repeats of TCE as bait sequence. One of the candidate TCE-binding factors identified was GKLF/KLF4, which belongs to a family of Kruppel-like zinc finger transcription factors hallmarked with three CX2CX3FX5LX2HX3H zinc finger motifs separated by a highly conserved 7-amino acid interfinger spacer, TGEKP(Y/F)X (21Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Studies from our laboratory showed that GKLF specifically bound to the TCE of the SM α-actin or SM 22α promoters and overexpression of GKLF repressed expression of SM22α and SM α-actin promoter-reporter constructs in cultured SMCs. Paradoxically, TGF-β has been shown to up-regulate various SMC marker genes (20Adam P.J. Regan C.P. Hautmann M.B. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37798-37806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 22Hautmann M.B. Adam P.J. Owens G.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2049-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To reconcile this apparent contradiction, we postulated that the TCE could act as an activator or repressor of expression of SMC marker genes, and that activation or repression would dominate depending on the stoichiometry of specific binding factors. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that: 1) GKLF was not expressed in TGF-β-treated differentiated SMCs but was present in phenotypically modulated cultured SMCs; 2) TGF-β1 could down-regulate GKLF RNA and protein in cultured SMCs; and 3) BTEB2/IKLF/KLF 5 could stimulate the activity of SM22α and SM α-actin promoters in cultured cells (20Adam P.J. Regan C.P. Hautmann M.B. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37798-37806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Whereas the preceding studies have provided evidence implicating a possible role of the TCE/GKLF in transcriptional regulation of SM22α and SM α-actin in cultured SMCs, the previous studies have not: 1) addressed if GKLF could repress expression of endogenous SMC marker genes as opposed to transiently transfected promoter-reporter constructs; 2) directly tested if GKLF is an endogenous repressor for SMC differentiation using loss-of-function approaches; 3) determined if GKLF is directly associated with promoters of SMC marker genes within intact chromatin, and 4) directly tested whether IKLF can antagonize GKLF induced repression of SM α-actin promoter activity in cultured cells. The present studies address each of these questions, and provide compelling evidence that GKLF is a very potent repressor of multiple SMC differentiation marker genes at least in cultured cell systems. Generation and Analysis of Mutation of the SM α-Actin TCE in Transgenic Mice—Mutation of the SM α-actin TCE was made by PCR mutagenesis in the context of a full-length SM α-actin promoter/enhancer from –2560 to +2784 that we have previously shown is sufficient to recapitulate expression of the endogenous SM α-actin in transgenic mice in vivo (23Mack C.P. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). A 1.1-kb fragment containing the TCE mutation was verified by sequencing and used to replace its wild type counterpart within the SM α-actin promoter (Fig. 1). The mutated promoter was then linked to a LacZ reporter to make the transgenic construct PPITCE-LacZ. The transgenic mice were then generated by the Transgenic Core Facility at the University of Virginia as described previously (23Mack C.P. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Positive founder lines were identified by PCR genotyping, and bred for assessment of transgene expression in embryonic and adult mice. Animals were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation, and tissues or embryos stained for β-galactosidase activity as previously described (23Mack C.P. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Multiple independent founder lines were analyzed to address possible locus and transgene copy number effects on expression patterns. Cell Cultures—Rat aortic SMCs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + F12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclones), 200 μg/ml l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) as previously described (19Hautmann M.B. Madsen C.S. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10948-10956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 0.075% sodium bicarbonate, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 200 μg/ml l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Generation of Constructs and Virus—The SM α-actin promoter region from –2560 to +2784 (with or without TCE mutation) was subcloned into the pGL3 vector to generate PPITCE-Luc and PPI-Luc reporter constructs, respectively. GKLF cDNA was subcloned into a pcDNA3.0 mammalian expression vector (pcDNA-GKLF). The SRF expression plasmid pcDNA-SRF was generated as previously described (24Spencer J.A. Misra R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16535-16543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The mouse IKLF cDNA was a generous gift from Dr. Masahiko Kurabayahi at the Gunma University (25Conkright M.D. Wani M.A. Anderson K.P. Lingrel J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1263-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and was subcloned into pcDNA3.0 vector (pcDNA-IKLF). A FLAG epitope tag was included on the N terminus of GKLF to generate pcDNA-Flag-GKLF. The FLAG-tagged GKLF was then subcloned into pShuttle (Clontech), and used to make an Adeno-GKLF construct according to the manufacturer's protocol. Purified GKLF adenoviruses (Ad-CMV-GKLF) were prepared by Gene Transfer Vector Core (Iowa). Control viruses Ad-CMV and ad-CMV-EGFP were also obtained there. A GKLF construct lacking the binding domain (pcDNA-GKLF-NB) was made by deleting 93 bp on the C terminus of the GKLF open reading frame. Transient Transfections/Reporter Assays and Infections by Adenovirus—SMCs were transfected with PPI-Luc or PPITCE-Luc and pcDNA-GKLF or pcDNA-GKLF-NB, and NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with PPI-Luc or PPITCE-Luc, pcDNA-SRF, pcDNA-GKLF and pcDNA-IKLF in triplicate using Superfect reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were incubated 48 h before being harvested with Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured with Luciferase Assay Substrate (Promega), and was normalized to total protein (Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent, Pierce). Transfections were repeated at least three times, and the relative luciferase activities were presented as mean ± S.E. SMCs were infected with GKLF Adeno virus (Ad-CMV-GKLF) or control virus (Ad-CMV) in triplicate 3 days after plating at multiplicity of infection (moi) of five plaque forming unit (pfu) per cell. The infection efficiency was demonstrated to be almost 100% based on infection with an EGFP expression adenovirus construct, i.e. Ad-CMV-EGFP (data not shown). RNA samples were prepared with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction 24 h after infection. RNA samples were then subjected to real time RT-PCR analyses, and the relative changes are presented as mean ± S.E. The experiments were repeated three times. Loss-of-Function Assay Using Morpholino Oligos—A GKLF morpholino antisense oligonucleotide was designed to target at the initiation site for GKLF translation (agactcgccaggtggctgcctcatt) and was synthesized by Gene Tools (Fig. 5A). Morpholinos were transfected into SMC with ethoxylated polyethylenimine (EPEI) according to the manufacturer's instructions 1 day after plating. The transfection efficiency was verified to be higher than 80% with fluorescent control oligos (data not shown). The specificity of the antisense oligo was validated by employing two rigorous control oligos: GKLF-Inv, ttactccgtcggtggaccgctcaga and GKLF-Mis, agtctagccaggaggctgcgtcttt. RNA samples were prepared from cells 48 h after transfection with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The purified RNA was then subjected to real time RT-PCR, and the relative changes are presented as mean ± S.E. The experiments were repeated seven times. Real Time RT-PCR—RNA samples were run on a 1% agarose gel to check quality. 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed as follows: dH2O was mixed with 1 μg of RNA, made to 10 μl, heated at 68 °C for 10 min, and chilled on ice for 3 min. RNA was mixed with a 10-μl reaction mix: 4 μl of 5× buffer, 2 μl of 10 mm dNTP, 1 μl of random decamer (cat. 5722g, Ambion), 0.5 μl of RNase inhibitor (40 units/μl), 0.5 μl of Superscript II (Invitrogen), and 2 μl of dH2O, incubated at 42 °C for 90 min and heated up at 95 °C for 5 min. 0.5 μl of cDNA was used for each real time PCR reaction. The PCRs were performed in the iCycler (Bio-Rad) and unknown samples were quantified by reference to serial dilutions of a known standard. For each sample, SMC-specific gene expression was normalized to 18 S rRNA or GAPDH level to correct for differences in RNA extraction and reverse transcription efficiencies. The primer and probe sequences are described here: 18 S rRNA-For, cggctaccacatccaaggaa; 18 S rRNA-Rev, agctggaattaccgcggc; 18 S probe, tgctggcaccagacttgccctc; Rat SM α-actin-For, agtcgccatcaggaa cctcgag; Rat SM α-actin-Rev, atcttttccatgtcgtcccagttg; Rat SMMHC-For, cagttggacactatgtcagggaaa; SMMHC-Rev, atggagacaaatgctaatcagcc; SMMHC probe, caaaataccaaatgacagcaaagcccagc; GAPDH-For, ggctcatgaccacagtccat; GAPDH-Rev, gcctgcttcaccaccttct; and GAPDH probe, cctggagaaacctgccaagtatgatgac (IDT). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—Three days after plating, SMCs were infected with Ad-CMV-GKLF or Ad-CMV at 5 M.O.I. After a 24-h incubation, ChIP assays were performed as described previously (26Manabe I. Owens G.K. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In brief, chromatin samples were immunoprecipitated with no antibody, anti-acetylated histone 4 (Upstate), anti-SRF antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), or anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). Immunoprecipitated chromatin samples were reverse-cross-linked, purified, and subjected to PCR amplification using primers specific to TCE-containing promoter regions of SM α-actin, SM MHC, or transin. The supernatant of the no antibody immunoprecipitation reaction was used as total input DNA. The sequences of the PCR primers were as follows: SM α-actin 5, acgcgaacagaggaatgcagtggaagagac; SM α-actin 3, cctcccactcgcctcccaaacaaggagc; SM MHC 5, ctgcgcgggaccatatttagtcagggggag; SM MHC 3, ctgggcgggag acaacccaaaaaggccagg; Transin 5, gatggccttatctggcatcaatggga; and Transin 3, gatgctctcccactcaccaactcact. The SM α-Actin TCE Was Required for SM α-Actin Promoter Activity in Vivo—Our initial goal was to determine if a 4-bp mutation of the SM α-actin TCE altered expression in transgenic mice (Fig. 1). Our earlier studies showed that the TCE mutation employed prevented TGF-β-dependent TCE binding activity in EMSA and abolished SM α-actin promoter activity in cultured SMCs (20Adam P.J. Regan C.P. Hautmann M.B. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37798-37806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In the current study, four independent transgenic founder lines carrying the PPITCE-LacZ transgene were obtained, and three of them successfully transmitted the transgene over multiple generations. Embryos at 13.5 dpc and 16.5 dpc or adult tissues from 6–10 weeks old mice were stained with X-gal and compared with embryos or tissues carrying the wild-type SM α-actin promoter from –2560 to +2784/LacZ transgene (PPI-LacZ), which was previously shown to recapitulate the same spatial and temporal expression pattern as the endogenous SM α-actin gene (23Mack C.P. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Our results showed that the TCE mutation completely abolished SM α-actin promoter activity in all three muscle types in embryos (Fig. 2A). In adult tissues, the TCE mutation abolished LacZ expression in aorta, coronary vessels, and bronchi, while it dramatically decreased LacZ expression in bladder, intestine, and stomach (Fig. 2B). These results thus provide compelling evidence that the TCE is required for expression of the SM α-actin gene in vivo in most SMC tissues, although results showing partial detection of β-gal activity in bladder and intestine suggest that there may be different regulatory paradigms for SM α-actin in various SMC subtypes in a manner similar to the SM MHC (26Manabe I. Owens G.K. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and SM22α genes (27Li L. Miano J.M. Mercer B. Olson E.N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Virtually identical results were found in all three independent TCE mutant transgenic founder lines thus indicating that loss of expression was a function of mutation of the TCE and not due to random locus-dependent gene silencing. A major long term goal of our laboratory has been to understand mechanisms that down-regulate expression of SMC marker genes associated with phenotypic modulation. However, since results of our TCE mutant studies in transgenic mice showed virtually complete absence of SM α-actin promoter activity in various SMC tissues in vivo, it was not possible to further examine role of TCE in phenotypic modulation of SMC using these transgenic founder lines. As an alternative, we employed cultured SMCs, which are well documented to be phenotypically modulated (28Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar), to study the possible role of the TCE in expression of SM α-actin gene expression. GKLF-induced Repression of the SM α-Actin Promoter in Cultured SMCs Was Partially Dependent on a Conserved TGF-β Control Element (TCE)—Our previous studies showed that the zinc finger Kruppel-like factor GKLF bound to SM22α and SM α-actin TCEs in EMSA and repressed the activity of the SM22α and SM α-actin promoters in co-transfection studies of TGF-β1-treated 10T1/2 cells (20Adam P.J. Regan C.P. Hautmann M.B. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37798-37806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In this study, we tested whether the GKLF-mediated repression of the SM α-actin promoter activity was TCE-dependent. As shown in Fig. 3A, at a low concentration of GKLF plasmid, repression of SM α-actin expression was highly TCE dependent, whereas at higher concentrations of GKLF plasmid, the relative dependence on the TCE was virtually lost. Since transcription factors are usually present at low copy number in cells, it is tempting to speculate that the TCE dependence exhibited at lower concentrations of GKLF plasmid might better reflect what occurs in vivo under physiological circumstances, and that the effects seen at higher concentrations of GKLF plasmid may represent gene squelching. However, due to the absence of antibody that is completely specific for GKLF the actual concentration of GKLF protein that exists in vivo is unknown, and it is equally plausible that GKLF may play a key role in modulating SMC gene expression via both TCE dependent and independent mechanisms. The results shown in Fig. 3A indicate that a significant component of GKLF-induced suppression of SM α-actin was TCE-independent. Indeed, the proximity of the TCE and the CArG box, a conserved SRF binding element that is required for expression of multiple SMC genes (23Mack C.P. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 26Manabe I. Owens G.K. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 27Li L. Miano J.M. Mercer B. Olson E.N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) suggests that TCE-independent GKLF mediated repression might depend on both protein-DNA and/or protein-protein interactions. To test if DNA binding was required for GKLF-induced repression, we made a GKLF construct with two zinc fingers of the DNA binding domain deleted (designated GKLF-NB). This mutation completely abrogated GKLF's ability to repress the SM α-actin promoter (Fig. 3B). However, we could not rule out the possibility that destroying the GKLF DNA binding domain might also inactivate its effecter domain or its activity to interact with other protein involved in regulation of SMC marker genes, although studies by others have shown that GKLF has a modular structure, and that its DNA binding domain and effecter domain can function independently of each other (29Geiman D.E. Ton-That H. Johnson J.M. Yang V.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1106-1113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Yet S.F. McA'Nulty M.M. Folta S.C. Yen H.W. Yoshizumi M. Hsieh C.M. Layne M.D. Chin M.T. Wang H. Perrella M.A. Jain M.K. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1026-1031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In summary, the preceding results indicate that GKLF can potentially inhibit transcription of SM α-actin through both TCE-dependent and -independent mechanisms. However, it is unclear whether TCE-independent activity is mediated through binding to another cis-element in the SM α-actin promoter and/or is mediated through protein-protein interactions. A GKLF-expressing Adenovirus Repressed Endogenous SM α-Actin and SM MHC Expression in Cultured SMCs—Because of low transfection efficiency in cultured SMCs, to directly test if GKLF could alter expression of endogenous SMC marker genes, a GKLF-expressing adenovirus (Ad-CMV-GKLF) was generated. Cultured SMCs were infected by Ad-CMV, Ad-CMV-EGFP, or Ad-CMV-GKLF at 5 pfu/cell. The infected cells appeared normal, and no apparent cell death was observed by phase-contrast microscopy. Total RNA was prepared from infected cells, and subjected to reverse transcription and real time RT-PCR analyses of SM α-actin and SM MHC, which represent markers of early and late stages of SMC differentiation respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, expression of SM α-actin and SM MHC mRNAs were substantially reduced in GKLF virus infected cells as compared with cells infected with control viruses. Results thus indicate that GKLF can potential inhibit expression of multiple endogenous SMC differentiation marker genes. Inhibition of Endogenous GKLF with Antisense Morpholinos Increased Expression of Endogenous SM α-Actin and SM MHC in Cultured SMCs—Our earlier studies showed that GKLF was expressed in phenotypically modulated cultured SMCs (20Adam P.J.

https://openalex.org/W2059443787,"The molecular mechanism underlying the transport of G protein-coupled receptors from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cell surface is poorly understood. This issue was addressed by determining the role of Rab1, a Ras-related small GTPase that coordinates vesicular protein transport in the early secretory pathway, in the subcellular distribution and function of the angiotensin II type 1A receptor (AT1R), β2-adrenergic receptor (AR), and α2B-AR in HEK293T cells. Inhibition of endogenous Rab1 function by transient expression of dominant-negative Rab1 mutants or Rab1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) induced a marked perinuclear accumulation and a significant reduction in cell-surface expression of AT1R and β2-AR. The accumulated receptors were colocalized with calregulin (an ER marker) and GM130 (a Golgi marker), consistent with Rab1 function in regulating protein transport from the ER to the Golgi. In contrast, dominant-negative Rab1 mutants and siRNA had no effect on the subcellular distribution of α2B-AR. Similarly, expression of dominant-negative Rab1 mutants and siRNA depletion of Rab1 significantly attenuated AT1R-mediated inositol phosphate accumulation and ERK1/2 activation and β2-AR-mediated ERK1/2 activation, but not α2B-AR-stimulated ERK1/2 activation. These data indicate that Rab1 GTPase selectively regulates intracellular trafficking and signaling of G protein-coupled receptors and suggest a novel, as yet undefined pathway for movement of G protein-coupled receptors from the ER to the cell surface.

Although most of the Rab GTPases identified are ubiquitous and highly conserved in their structure and function, each Rab GTPase has a distinct intracellular localization and regulates discrete protein transport steps in secretory and endocytic pathways (1Takai Y.

Intracellular trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors is a highly regulated and dynamic process. G protein-coupled receptors are synthesized and modified in the ER, transported to the Golgi apparatus for additional post-translational modifications (e.g. glycosylation), and then further transported to the plasma membrane. The receptors at the plasma membrane may undergo internalization upon stimulation with agonists. The internalized receptors are then transported to the lysosomes for degradation or recycled back to the plasma membrane. Because most studies on receptor trafficking have focused on the events involved in receptor internalization, recycling, and degradation (17Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 18Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar), transport processes of G protein-coupled receptors from the ER through the Golgi to the cell surface itself and regulation of receptor signaling by these processes are poorly understood. As an initial approach to these issues, we determined the role of Rab1 GTPase in intracellular trafficking and signal transduction of the angiotensin II type 1A receptor (AT1R), β2-adrenergic receptor (AR), and α2B-AR. Our data indicate that Rab1 GTPase selectively regulates the intracellular trafficking and signaling of G protein-coupled receptors and suggest a novel, as yet undefined pathway for movement of G protein-coupled receptors from the ER to the cell surface.

Plasmid Constructions—For generation of AT1R tagged with green fluorescent protein at its carboxyl terminus (AT1R-GFP), full-length AT1R in pCDM8 was amplified by PCR (forward primer, 5′-GATCAAGCTTGTCTGGATAAATCACAC-3′; and reverse primer, 5′-GATCGTCGACCACTCCACCTCAAAACAAG-3′), in which the AT1R stop codon was mutated, and AT1R was in-frame with GFP, restricted with HindIII/SalI, and ligated into the pEGFP-N1 vector (Invitrogen).

The amino termini of AT1R (HA-AT1R) and β2-AR (HA-β2-AR) were also tagged with the HA epitope using primers coding YPYDVPDYA and containing appropriate restriction sites. The GFP and HA epitopes have been used to label G protein-coupled receptors, including AT1R and β2-AR, resulting in receptors with similar characteristics to the wild-type receptors (23Barak L.S.

The sequence of each construct used in this study was verified by restriction mapping and nucleotide sequence analysis (Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center DNA Sequence Core). Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transient transfection of the HEK293T cells was carried out using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). For measurement of total and cell-surface receptor expression and ERK1/2 activation, HEK293T cells were cultured on 6-well dishes. For each transfection, 0.8 μg of AT1RGFP, β2-AR-GFP, or α2B-AR-GFP and 2.0 μg of pcDNA3.1 or Rab1 constructs were diluted into 125 μl of serum-free Opti-MEM in a tube. In another tube, 7 μl of LipofectAMINE was diluted into 125 μl of serum-free Opti-MEM. The two solutions were combined and mixed gently. After incubation for 20 min at room temperature, the mixture was added to each well containing 800 μl of fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. For measurement of inositol phosphate (IP) production, HEK293T cells were cultured on 100-mm dishes and transfected with 4 μg of AT1R-GFP plasmid together with 10 μg of pcDNA3.1 vector or Rab1 constructs. Based on the GFP fluorescence, 60-85% of the cells were transfected. For immunofluorescence microscopy analysis, HEK293T cells were cultured on 6-well dishes and transfected with 30 ng of GFP- or HA-tagged receptors and 300 ng of Rab1 constructs. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Receptor Expression—For measurement of total AT1R expression, HEK293T cells transfected with AT1R-GFP were collected and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% fetal calf serum at a density of 8 × 106 cells/ml. Total receptor expression was determined by measuring total GFP fluorescence on a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences FACSCalibur) as described (28Zhang X.Y. La Russa V.F. Bao L. Kolls J. Schwarzenberger P. Reiser J. Mol. Ther. 2002; 5: 555-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). For measurement of AT1R expression at the cell surface, HEK293T cells were transfected with HA-AT1R. The transfected cells were collected, suspended in PBS containing 1% fetal calf serum at a density of 4 × 106 cells/ml, and incubated with high affinity fluoresceinconjugated anti-HA antibody 3F10 at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing twice with 0.5 ml of PBS and 1% fetal calf serum, the cells were resuspended, and the fluorescence was analyzed as described above. Because the staining with the anti-HA antibodies was carried out in the unpermeabilized cells and only those receptors expressed at the cell surface were accessible to the anti-HA antibodies, the fluorescence measurement reflected the amount of AT1R expressed at the cell surface. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HEK293T cells were grown on coverslips, fixed with a mixture of 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose in PBS for 15 min, permeabilized with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and blocked with 5% normal donkey serum for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with primary antibody for 1 h. After washing with PBS (3 × 5 min), the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 594-labeled secondary antibody (1:2000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were mounted, and fluorescence was detected with a Leica DMRA2 epifluorescence microscope. Images were deconvolved using SlideBook software and the nearest-neighbors deconvolution algorithm (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO) as described (29Blumer J.B. Chandler L.J. Lanier S.M.

Double-stranded Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated Interference—A double-stranded siRNA with a 19-nucleotide duplex and 2-nucleotide 3′-(dT)2 overhangs (sense, 5′-GAUCCGAACCAUCGAGCUG-dTdT-3′; and antisense, 3′-dTdTCUAGGCUUGGUAGCUCGAC) targeting the sequence at positions 136-156 relative to the start codon (5′-AAGATCCGAACCATCGAGCTG-3′) of human Rab1 (GenBank™/EBI Data Bank accession number NM_030981) and a control non-silencing siRNA duplex (sense, 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUdTdT-3′; and antisense, 5′-dTdTAAGAGGCUUGCACAGUGCA-3′) targeting DNA sequence AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT were purchased from QIAGEN Inc. (Valencia, CA). BLAST searches of the data base indicated that this siRNA probe is specific for Rab1 and has no homology to other Rab proteins. HEK293T cells were plated on 6-well dishes at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well for 12-16 h before transfection. The plasmid encoding the selected receptor was mixed with siRNA and simultaneously transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent. Briefly, 8 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 and 6 μl of 20 μm siRNA plus 0.8 μg of individual receptor plasmids were added separately to 100 μl of Opti-MEM. After a 5-min incubation, both solutions were mixed and incubated for 20 min. The transfection mixture was added to culture dishes containing 0.8 ml of fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal bovine serum without antibiotics. After incubation at 37 °C for 6-8 h, the culture medium was changed to complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. All experiments were performed 48 h after siRNA transfection. Measurement of IP Production—IP accumulation was measured as described (30Downes C.P. Michell R.H. Biochem. J. 1981; 198: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 31Downes C.P. Mussat M.C.

At 8-12 h after transfection, the transfected cells were split into 60-mm culture dishes. At 24 h after transfection, the cells were labeled with fresh medium supplemented with myo-[3H]inositol (2 μCi/ml) for 24 h. The cells were washed three times with 2 ml of ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1.26 mm Ca2+ and 0.89 mm Mg2+ and incubated in 2 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 mm LiCl at room temperature for 20 min. The cells were then stimulated with Ang II at 1 μm for 45 min at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated with 1 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. The cells were frozen at -80 °C for 10 min, collected, and mixed with 0.5 ml of 0.72 m KOH and 0.6 m KHCO3. After centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min to remove the precipitated proteins, the supernatants were applied to Dowex AG 1-X8 anion exchange columns (1.0 ml) equilibrated with 0.1 m formic acid. The columns were washed with 0.1 m formic acid (4 × 4 ml) to remove free myo-[3H]inositol, and IPs were eluted with 0.1 m formic acid (3 × 2.0 ml) containing 1 m ammonium formate and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry in 18 ml of Ecoscint A scintillation solution (National Diagnostics, Inc., Atlanta, GA). Measurement of ERK1/2 Activation—HEK293T cells were cultured on 6-well dishes and transfected as described above. At 36-48 h after transient transfection, HEK293T cells were starved for at least 2 h and then stimulated with individual agonists as indicated in the figure legends. Stimulation was terminated by addition of 600 μl of 1× SDS gel loading buffer. For measurement of ERK1/2 activation by isoproterenol and UK14304, 300 μl of SDS gel loading buffer was used to terminate reactions. After solubilizing the cells, 20 μl of total cell lysates was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. ERK1/2 activation was determined by Western blotting by measuring the levels of phosphorylation of ERK1/2 with phospho-specific ERK1/2 antibodies. The membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-ERK2 antibodies to determine the total amount of ERK2 and to confirm equal loading of proteins. Immunoblotting—Western blotting was carried out as described previously (19Wu G. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Lanier S.M. J. Biol.

HEK293T cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The signal was detected using ECL Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and a Fuji Film luminescent image analyzer (LAS-1000 Plus) and quantitated using the Image Gauge program (Version 3.4). Statistical Analysis—Differences were evaluated by one-way analysis of variance, with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. The EC50 values of ERK1/2 activation in response to stimulation with receptor agonists were analyzed using PRISM software (GraphPAD, San Diego, CA). Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Regulation of AT1R Expression at the Cell Surface by Rab1 GTPase—To determine whether or not Rab1 regulates AT1R trafficking in the secretory pathway, we first determined the effect of transient expression of wild-type Rab1 (Rab1WT) and its dominant-negative mutants on AT1R expression at the cell surface and total AT1R expression. Rab1WT and its dominant-negative mutants S25N (a GDP-bound form) and N124I (a guanine nucleotide binding-deficient form) tagged with the FLAG epitope at their amino termini were transiently expressed in HEK293T cells, and FLAG-Rab1 expression was determined by Western blot analysis using high affinity anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 1A). AT1R was tagged with GFP at its carboxyl terminus (AT1R-GFP) or with the HA epitope at its amino terminus (HA-AT1R). AT1R-GFP or HAAT1R was transiently expressed together with pcDNA3.1 vector, FLAG-Rab1WT, FLAG-Rab1S25N, or FLAG-Rab1N124I in HEK293T cells. Expression of Rab1WT and its mutants did not alter total AT1R-GFP expression as determined by measuring GFP fluorescence by flow cytometry (Fig. 1B). In contrast, coexpression of Rab1S25N and Rab1N124I with HA-AT1R significantly attenuated AT1R expression at the cell surface by 66 and 45%, respectively, compared with transfection with HAAT1R and the empty pcDNA3.1 vector (Fig. 1B) as quantified by flow cytometry following staining with anti-HA antibodies in unpermeabilized HEK293T cells. We then determined the effect of expressing Rab1WT and Rab1S25N on the subcellular localization of AT1R by fluorescence microscopy analysis. As anticipated, AT1R tagged with GFP or HA was localized mainly at the cell surface in the absence of exogenous Rab1, as indicated by extensive co-localization with ConA, a plasma membrane marker (Figs. 2 and 3A). Consistent with flow cytometry data, expression of Rab1S25N markedly reduced AT1R localization at the cell surface (Fig. 2, A and B) and co-localization with ConA (Fig. 3B). Rab1S25N induced AT1R accumulation in the perinuclear regions of the transfected cells (Fig. 2), and the accumulated AT1R was co-localized with calregulin (an ER marker) and GM130 (a Golgi marker), but not with Rab4 (an endosome marker) (Fig. 3B). These data indicate that Rab1 GTPase is involved in AT1R trafficking from the ER through the Golgi to the cell surface, consistent with Rab1 function in regulating protein transport selectively from the ER to the Golgi. In contrast to the dominant-negative Rab1 mutants, expression of Rab1WT had no obvious effect on the subcellular localization of AT1R (Fig. 2), suggesting that endogenous Rab1 is not a rate-limiting factor for AT1R transport to the cell surface.Fig. 3Co-localization of AT1R with intracellular organelle marker proteins.A, HEK293T cells were transfected with AT1R-GFP and stained with tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated ConA (a plasma membrane marker). B, HEK293T cells were transfected with AT1RGFP and Rab1S25N and stained with ConA and antibodies against calregulin (an ER marker; 1:50 dilution), GM130 (a Golgi marker; 1:100 dilution), and Rab4 (an endosome marker; 1:100 dilution) as described under ”Experimental Procedures.” The subcellular distribution and co-localization with marker proteins of AT1R were revealed by fluorescence microscopy.

To determine whether Rab1 GTPase is capable of regulating the trafficking of other G protein-coupled receptors, we determined the effect of dominant-negative mutant Rab1S25N on the subcellular distribution of β2-AR and α2B-AR using the same strategy followed for AT1R. Rab1S25N expression markedly reduced β2-AR localization at the cell surface, with a retention of β2-AR in the perinuclear regions of the transfected cells (Fig. 4A). Surprisingly, in contrast to AT1R and β2-AR, expression of Rab1S25N did not affect the subcellular distri"
https://openalex.org/W2001314991,"Bromocriptine, acting through the dopamine D2 receptor, provides robust protection against apoptosis induced by oxidative stress in PC12-D2R and immortalized nigral dopamine cells. We now report the characterization of the D2 receptor signaling pathways mediating the cytoprotection. Bromocriptine caused protein kinase B (Akt) activation in PC12-D2R cells and the inhibition of either phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), or c-Src eliminated the Akt activation and the cytoprotective effects of bromocriptine against oxidative stress. Co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that the D2 receptor forms a complex with the EGFR and c-Src that was augmented by bromocriptine, suggesting a cross-talk between these proteins in mediating the activation of Akt. EGFR repression by inhibitor or by RNA interference eliminated the activation of Akt by bromocriptine. D2 receptor stimulation by bromocriptine induced c-Src tyrosine 418 phosphorylation and EGFR phosphorylation specifically at tyrosine 845, a known substrate of Src kinase. Furthermore, Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor or dominant negative Src interfered with Akt translocation and phosphorylation. Thus, the predominant signaling cascade mediating cytoprotection by the D2 receptor involves c-Src/EGFR transactivation by D2 receptor, activating PI 3-kinase and Akt. We also found that the agonist pramipexole failed to stimulate activation of Akt in PC12-D2R cells, providing an explanation for our previous observations that, despite efficiently activating G-protein signaling, this agonist had little cytoprotective activity in this experimental system. These results support the hypothesis that specific dopamine agonists stabilize distinct conformations of the D2 receptor that differ in their coupling to G-proteins and to a cytoprotective c-Src/EGFR-mediated PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway.

Kish S. Yahr M. Bergmann K. Parkinson's Disease. Raven Press, New York1987: 19-34Google Scholar), causing a profound reduction in dopamine-mediated signaling (2Fahn S. Wyngaarden J. Smith Jr., L. Cecil's Textbook of Medicine. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1988: 2143-2147Google Scholar). The prominent locomotor deficits that occur in this disease are in large part attributable to the loss of stimulation of the dopamine D2 receptor (3Sealfon S.C. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 47: S12-S21PubMed Google Scholar), a member of the rhodopsin-like heptahelical receptor family (4Probst W.C. Snyder L.A. Schuster D.I. Brosius J. Sealfon S.C. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). The D2 receptor is an important target for anti-parkinsonian drugs that ameliorate the motor deficits associated with this disorder. In recent years, dopamine agonists have also been found to have neuroprotective activity in some experimental models, and the possibility that they may decrease the progression of PD has been proposed (5Le W.D. Jankovic J. Drugs Aging. 2001; 18: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying the agonist-mediated neuroprotection reported in experimental models are poorly understood, and the potential for dopamine agonists to alter the clinical course of this disease remains an area of controversy (6Ahlskog J.E. Neurology. 2003; 60: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).

Many heptahelical receptors couple to multiple signal transduction pathways, including various heterotrimeric G-protein-second messenger pathways and growth factor receptor-protein kinase cascades (7Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2075) Google Scholar). The signal for activation of the proximal mediators of signaling such as heterotrimeric G-proteins, receptor kinases, or other protein partners, is an alteration in the receptor's conformation that occurs following complexing with agonist. Studies in several heptahelical receptors suggest that these proteins exist in multiple, functionally significant conformations that may differ in their relative activation of different signaling pathways (8Seifert R. Wenzel-Seifert K. Gether U. Kobilka B.K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 297: 1218-1226PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sakmar T.P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

Studies with several receptors, including the dopamine D2 receptor, suggest that agonists acting at the same receptor select among different active receptor conformations and determine the relative levels of activation of downstream signaling pathways, a hypothesis called agonist-directed signal trafficking (13Kenakin T.

We had previously investigated the role of the D2 receptor expressed in the PC12 cell line (PC12-D2R) in modulating the induction of apoptotic cell loss caused by hydrogen peroxide-induced (H2O2) oxidative stress (17Nair V.D. Olanow C.W. Sealfon S.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of neuronal loss in PD is not known, many studies have implicated oxidative stress (reviewed in Refs. 18Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1983; 23: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar and 19Ames B. Shigenaga M. Hagen T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7915-7922Crossref PubMed Scopus (5382) Google Scholar). Oxidation of dopamine by auto-oxidation and monoamine oxidase produces reactive oxygen species, including H2O2. H2O2 reacts with ferrous (Fe2+) iron to produce hydroxyl radicals, which can damage proteins, nucleic acids, and membrane phospholipids, and induce apoptosis (20Olanow C.W. Tatton W.G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 123-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). Some animal model and human PD postmortem studies provide evidence that the degeneration of DA neurons occurs via apoptosis (21Mattson M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar, 22Hartmann A. Hirsch E.C. Adv. Neurol. 2001; 86: 143-153PubMed Google Scholar). We found that activation of the D2 receptor in the PC12-D2R line caused a robust, concentration-dependent increase in cell survival during oxidative stress that required activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). Among the agonists studied, we found significant discrepancies in the capacity of individual agonists to mediate anti-apoptosis and to stimulate G-protein activation, assayed via [35S]GTPγS binding (17Nair V.D. Olanow C.W. Sealfon S.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanisms underlying agonist-specific modulation of cell survival, we have now investigated the anti-apoptotic signaling pathway activated by the D2 receptor. We find that D2 receptor-mediated protection against oxidative stress involves a novel c-Src-dependent transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that activates PI 3-kinase/protein kinase B (Akt) and that agonists differ in their capacity to activate this pathway. Chemicals—(+)-Bromocriptine methanesulfonate, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), H2O2, nerve growth factor (NGF) and pertussis toxin (PTX) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.

Cell Culture and Viability Analysis—The development and characterization of the PC12-D2R cell line, which is stably transfected with the human D2L receptors, were previously described (17Nair V.D. Olanow C.W. Sealfon S.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 500 μg/ml G418 in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For differentiation, PC12-D2R cells were plated onto collagen-coated plates in DMEM containing 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum and allowed to attach overnight. The cells were then induced to differentiate by growing in DMEM supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum and 100 ng/ml NGF for 10–14 days. Nigral dopamine cell line SN4741 (generous gift from Dr. J. H. Son, Columbia University, New York, NY) was cultured as described previously (23Son J.H. Chun H.S. Joh T.H. Cho S. Conti B. Lee J.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell viability was measured by the MTT method 24 h after various treatments as described (17Nair V.D. Olanow C.W. Sealfon S.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Transfections and DNA Constructs—For live cell fluorescence microscopy, PC12-D2R cells (1 × 105) were plated into 60-mm culture dishes and incubated in the media for 24 h. The media was replaced with serum-free DMEM, and a mixture containing 5 μg of the plasmid DNA encoding the pleckstrin homology domain of Akt protein kinase (1–167) tagged with green fluorescent protein (PH-Akt-GFP) (24Varnai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. T. Balla, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and 30 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent were gently added to each plate and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C at 5% CO2. The DNA-containing medium was replaced with fresh DMEM-containing serum. When cotransfection of c-Src (wild type) or dominant negative c-Src (K295R/Y527F) (both were generous gifts from Dr. J. Burgge, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) with PH-Akt-GFP was carried out, the DNA concentration used was 1:1. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) plasmid was from Clontech. SN4741 cells were co-transfected with D2L and PH-Akt-GFP or GFP by calcium phosphate method (25Xia Z. Dudek H. Miranti C.K. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5425-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Epifluorescence Imaging—Microscopy of live cells transfected to express PH-Akt-GFP was performed on the Olympus (BX65) upright fluorescent microscope using a water immersion objective lens (×40) fitted with a heated stage and an objective lens heater. Images were collected at 2-min intervals after the addition of the drugs and processed using Adobe Photoshop (5.5). Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—PC12-D2R cells (1 × 106 cells/100-mm plate) were grown for 24 h, and following respective treatments, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal C630, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science, GmbH) at 4 °C for 20 min. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, equal amounts of proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The resolved proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Detection of proteins by immunoblotting was conducted using ECL system according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The blots were then stripped in buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 °C and re-probed with respective antibodies. For immunoprecipitation, the protein extract was incubated sequentially (2 h for each incubation at 4 °C) with anti-D2 receptor antibody and protein A/G-agarose with gentle agitation. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, boiled for 5 min in 3× Laemmli sample buffer, and processed for Western blotting using EGFR or c-Src antibody. The EGFR blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-phospho tyrosine (PY20) antibody. RNA Interference—Custom SMARTpool plus small interfering RNA (siRNA) to target rat EGFR (catalog no. M-004710-00) was designed and synthesized by Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). siRNA (50 pmol) was co-transfected with PH-Akt-GFP (2 μg) into PC12-D2R cells using transit-TKO and -neural transfection reagents (Mirus, Madison, WI) according to manufacturer's protocol. For immunofluorescence, 24 h after transfection, cells were serum-starved for 1 h and were treated with bromocriptine for 10 min. The cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol and immunostained for EGFR and visualized using CY3-conjugated secondary antibody. A nonspecific RNA duplex (Dharmacon, catalog no. D-001206-09-05) was used in control experiments. Neuroprotection by D2Receptor Activation Involves PI 3-Kinase/Akt Signaling Cascade—We have previously reported that the increased cell survival in PC12-D2R cells mediated by D2 receptor activation was completely abolished by inhibitors of PI 3-kinase, suggesting that the D2 receptor may be altering cell survival by activating PI 3-kinase (17Nair V.D. Olanow C.W. Sealfon S.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We therefore studied whether PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling was modulated by the D2 receptor when complexed with an agonist that prevents apoptosis in these cells. Activation of PI 3-kinase generates phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) and thereby stimulates anti-apoptotic proteins (26Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar). The downstream PI 3-kinase target, protein kinase B (Akt), has been reported to be important in mediating survival in many cell types (27Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Akt is activated by phosphorylation at Thr308 in the catalytic loop and Ser473 in the C-terminal domain (28Stokoe D. Stephens L.R. Copeland T. Gaffney P.R.J. Reese C.B. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. McCormick F. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1997; 277: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 29Stephens L. Anderson K. Stokoe D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. McCormick F. Tempst P. Coadwell J. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1998; 279: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). We first determined whether the anti-apoptotic dopamine agonist bromocriptine induced phosphorylation of Ser473 of endogenous Akt in PC12-D2R cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, Akt phosphorylation was increased 15 min after exposure to bromocriptine. In some cell lines, H2O2 has been reported to activate Akt (30Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 31Wang X. McCullough K.D. Franke T.F. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14624-14631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). However, we found that in PC12-D2R cells H2O2 alone had no effect on the phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 1A). Akt phosphorylation occurs after it is recruited to the plasma membrane through an interaction of its N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain with PIP3 (32Datta K. Franke T.F. Chan T.O. Makris A. Yang S.I. Kaplan D.R. Morrison D.K. Golemis E.A. Tsichlis P.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2304-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), thereby bringing the enzyme into the proximity of additional PIP3-dependent and -independent protein kinases (33Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Ahmed N.N. Datta K. Malstrom S. Stokoe D. McCormick F. Feng J. Tsichlis P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). We studied the redistribution of Akt by D2 receptor signaling using a PH-Akt-GFP fusion protein (24Varnai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). The localization of PH-Akt-GFP in quiescent PC12-D2R cells was indistinguishable from that of transfected GFP alone. Receptor activation by bromocriptine, however, caused a rapid (<5 min) translocation of the PH-Akt-GFP to ruffled membrane regions (Fig. 1B, top panels). No response to bromocriptine was observed in control PC12-D2R cells expressing GFP alone (Fig. 1B, middle panels) or in the parent PC12 cells, which lack the D2 receptor, expressing PHAkt-GFP (Fig. 1B, bottom panels). We also tested whether this pathway was active in cells exposed to oxidative stress. As shown in Fig. 1C, the bromocriptine-induced phosphorylation of Akt and translocation of PH-Akt-GFP (Fig. 1D) were unaffected in the presence of H2O2. Thus, D2 receptor stimulation by bromocriptine caused translocation and phosphorylation of Akt in PC12-D2R cells during oxidative stress. D2 Receptor Activation of Akt Is PTX-insensitive and PI 3-Kinase-dependent—The D2 receptor is a member of the rhodopsin-like heptahelical receptor family, whose classic signaling pathway involves the activation of the Gi/Go subtype heterotrimeric G-proteins, which can be inactivated by PTX (34Lachowicz J.E. Sibley D.R. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 81: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To examine the role of Gi/Go coupling in activation of PI 3-kinase/Akt, we determined the effects of PTX on these responses. Pretreatment of PC12-D2R cells with 100 ng/ml PTX (16 h) eliminated bromocriptine-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding (data not shown). In contrast, the D2 receptor-mediated phosphorylation of Akt was unaffected by PTX (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 3 and 4). To assess the role of PI 3-kinase in the activation of Akt induced by D2 receptors, PC12-D2R cells were pretreated with the inhibitor wortmannin at 100 nm, a concentration that selectively blocks PI 3-kinase (35Davies S. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3926) Google Scholar). The cultures were then exposed to bromocriptine. Wortmannin completely prevented the phosphorylation of Akt that is inducible by D2 receptor activation (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 4 and 5). Similar results were also obtained with LY294002 (20 μm), another commonly used but less potent inhibitor of PI 3-kinase (35Davies S. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3926) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 4 and 6). Translocation of PH-Akt-GFP by bromocriptine was also inhibited by pretreatment with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, whereas it was unaffected by PTX pretreatment (Fig. 2B). Similar results were obtained with LY294002 (data not shown). These results indicate that the D2R-mediated activation of Akt occurs through PI 3-kinase by a mechanism independent of Gi/Go class heterotrimeric G-proteins. D2 Receptor Activates PI 3-kinase/Akt Pathway in Nigral Dopamine Cells—To explore whether the D2 receptor coupling to PI 3-kinase/Akt observed in PC12-D2R cells was present when the D2 receptor was expressed in a different cellular context, we studied this signaling pathway in the mouse immortalized nigral dopamine cell line SN4741, which expresses tyrosine hydroxylase, the dopamine transporter, and D2 auto-receptors (23Son J.H. Chun H.S. Joh T.H. Cho S. Conti B. Lee J.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of D2 receptors by bromocriptine in these cells was found to induce phosphorylation of endogenous Akt (Fig. 3A). When the cells were transfected with the PHAkt-GFP construct, bromocriptine induced redistribution of this reporter (data not shown). The capacity of the activated D2 receptor to induce Akt redistribution in this model was enhanced in cells co-transfected with D2 receptor and PH-Akt-GFP. Bromocriptine caused a translocation of the PH-Akt-GFP protein into discrete regions of the SN4741 cells (Fig. 3B) that was similar to the response observed in differentiated PC12-D2R cells (Fig. 3C). The bromocriptine-stimulated translocation of PH-Akt-GFP in SN4741 cells was eliminated by pretreatment with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY290042 (data not shown). Control experiments in which cells were transfected with the D2 receptor and GFP showed no change in the distribution of fluorescence in response to bromocriptine. These results suggest that the D2 receptor can couple to the PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway in dopaminergic neurons. D2 Receptor-mediated Neuroprotection and Activation of PI3-Kinase/Akt Involves EGFR Transactivation—We previously reported that bromocriptine showed significant PI 3-kinase-dependent anti-apoptotic activity in PC12-D2R cells and have demonstrated, as described above, that bromocriptine also induced Akt phosphorylation and translocation. We next attempted to delineate the signal mediators connecting the D2 receptor to PI 3-kinase. It has been reported that the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway in PC12 cells can be activated by receptor tyrosine kinases (36Piiper A. Dikic I. Lutz M.P. Leser J. Kronenberger B. Elez R. Cramer H. Muller-Esterl W. Zeuzem S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43623-43630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The effectiveness of several receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors on bromocriptine-mediated neuroprotection was evaluated. H2O2 exposure caused significant loss of PC12-D2R cell viability at 24 h, as determined using the MTT metabolism assay, and this cell loss was nearly completely reversed by the D2 receptor agonist bromocriptine (Fig. 4A), consistent with our previous results (17Nair V.D. Olanow C.W. Sealfon S.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The effects of various growth factor receptor inhibitors on the capacity of bromocriptine to protect cells against cell death due to H2O2 exposure were studied. AG1296 (200 nm), AG1478 (200 nm), and k252a (50 nm) in the presence of H2O2 and the presence or absence of bromocriptine (100 nm) for 24 h were evaluated. As shown in Fig. 4A, AG1478, a specific inhibitor of EGFR intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (37Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1616) Google Scholar), completely abolished the neuroprotection provided by bromocriptine exposure, an effect similar to that observed with inhibition of PI 3-kinase (17Nair V.D. Olanow C.W. Sealfon S.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In contrast, inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors by AG1296 or NGF receptor by k252a had no effect on D2 receptor-mediated cell survival. We next investigated the role of the EGFR in mediating the signaling from the D2 receptor to Akt. Activation of the EGFR by EGF caused a rapid phosphorylation of Akt and a translocation of PH-Akt-GFP in PC12-D2R cells, similar to the response observed with bromocriptine (Fig. 4B). The involvement of EGFR transactivation in D2 receptor stimulation of Akt phosphorylation and translocation was supported by finding a complete inhibition of these responses after pretreatment with AG1478 (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that PI 3-kinase/Akt is one of the downstream effectors of the EGFR and that the D2 receptor activates PI 3-kinase/Akt via transactivation of the EGFR in PC12-D2R cells. To confirm the role of the EGFR in the activation of PI-3 kinase/Akt by D2 receptors, we reduced the levels of EGFR expression in PC12-D2R cells using RNA interference. After transfection with EGFR-specific or control small interfering RNA (siRNA), cultures were assessed for EGFR protein expression by immunofluorescence. As shown in Fig. 5, EGFR was substantially repressed by 24 h post-transfection in ∼60–70% of the cells. The involvement of EGFR transactivation in D2 receptor-stimulation of Akt was studied in PC12-D2R cells co-transfected with PH-Akt-GFP and EGFR siRNA or control siRNA. 24 h after transfection the cells were serum-starved for 1 h, stimulated with bromocriptine, and assessed for the expression of EGFR and the translocation of PH-Akt-GFP. In control siRNA-transfected cells, PH-Akt-GFP translocation was similar to that observed in cells not transfected with siRNA (Fig. 6A and data not shown). However, EGFR repression by siRNA completely blocked the translocation of PH-Akt-GFP by bromocriptine (Fig. 6B). We conclude that EGFR i"
https://openalex.org/W2005571237,"We have investigated the effects of two heat shock proteins, Hsp10 and Hsp60, on insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) signaling in cardiac muscle cells. Neonatal cardiomyocytes were transduced with Hsp10 or Hsp60 via adenoviral vector. Compared with the cells transduced with a control vector, overexpression of Hsp10 or Hsp60 increased the abundance of IGF-1R and IGF-1-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation. Thus, Hsp10 and Hsp60 overexpression increased the number of functioning receptors and amplified activation of IGF-1R signaling. IGF-1 stimulation of MEK, Erk, p90Rsk, and Akt were accordingly augmented. Transducing cardiomyocytes with antisense Hsp60 oligonucleotides reduced Hsp60 expression, decreased the abundance of IGF-1R, attenuated IGF-1R autophosphorylation, and suppressed the pro-survival action of IGF-1 in cardiomyocytes. Using cycloheximide to inhibit protein synthesis did not alter the effect of Hsp60 on IGF-1R signaling, and IGF-1R mRNA levels were not up-regulated by Hsp10 or Hsp60. Additional experiments showed that Hsp10 and Hsp60 suppressed polyubiquitination of IGF-1 receptor. These data indicate that Hsp10 and Hsp60 can modulate IGF-1R signaling through post-translational modification. In animal models of diabetes, diabetic myocardium is associated with decreased abundance of Hsp60, increased ubiquitination of IGF-1R, and lower level of IGF-1R protein. Declined myocardial protection is a major feature of diabetic cardiomyopathy.

IGF-1 receptor signaling is involved in the regulation of multiple aspects of biological actions (1LeRoith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). For example, IGF-1 activation of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase and MAP kinase suppresses cardiac muscle apoptosis and enhances myocardial protection during myocardial injuries (2Wu W. Lee W-L. Wu Y.Y. Chen D. Liu T-J. Jang A. Sharma P.M. Wang P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40113-40119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 3Parrizas M. Saltiel A.R. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 154-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). In addition to phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, growth factor receptor signaling can be modulated through transcriptional and post-translational modification of ligands, receptors, and signaling intermediates. Recent studies (4Dalle S. Imamura T. Rose D.W. Worrall D.S. Ugi S. Hupfeld C.J. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6272-6285Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 5Rui L. Fisher T.L. Thomas J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40362-40367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) have shown that insulin and IGF-1 receptor signaling can be modulated through post-translational modification of signaling molecules such as arrestin-1 and insulin receptor substrate (IRS2). There was evidence suggested that IGF-1 receptor signaling might be modulated through degradation of receptor proteins as proteolysis inhibitors prevented degradation of IGF-1 receptor (6Sepp-Lorenzino L. Ma Z. Lebwohl D.E. Vinitsky A. Rosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16580-16587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). However, whether post-translational modification of IGF-1 receptor contributed to the regulation of IGF-1 receptor signaling in cardiac muscle has not yet been investigated. Heat shock proteins are a group of molecular chaperones that are capable of preventing protein damages and proteolysis. In cardiac muscle, Hsp60 and Hsp10 may form mitochondrial chaperoning complexes and are believed to play a role in the maintenance of normal mitochondria function (7Lau S. Patnaik N. Sayen M.R. Mestril R. Circulation. 1997; 96: 2287-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Hsp60 and Hsp10 also exist in the cytosolic compartment and interact with cytosolic proteins (8Kirchhoff S.R. Gupta S. Knowlton A.A. Circulation. 2002; 105: 2899-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), which suggests that Hsp60 and Hsp10 may regulate proteins through post-translational modification. Whether Hsp10 and Hsp60 can modulate IGF-1 receptor signaling has not been studied. This study was carried out to determine whether Hsp10 and Hsp60 can modulate IGF-1 receptor signaling in cardiomyocytes. The results showed that IGF-1 receptor signaling can be modulated by Hsp60 and Hsp10 through post-translational modification in cardiac muscle cells. Further experiments on animal models of diabetes showed that the changes of Hsp60 paralleled the levels of IGF-1 receptor in various tissues. Moreover, diabetic myocardium exhibited reduced Hsp60 and increased ubiquitination of IGF-1 receptor. These findings may have significant implications in understanding the fundamental mechanisms that lead to a decreased myocardial protection during the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Materials—Mouse anti-Hsp60 monoclonal antibody and rabbit anti-Cpn10 (Hsp10) peptide polyclonal antibody were purchased from StressGen Biotechnologies Corp. (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies to mouse and goat immunoglobulins were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Other antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biolabs (Santa Cruz, CA). Immobilon-P membranes were from Millipore Co. (Bedford, MA). DIG RNA labeling kit, Anti-digoxigenin-AP antibodies, DNase I, protector RNase inhibitor, β-actin RNA probe, DIG Easy Hyb, Wash and Block Buffer Set, and positively charged nylon membranes were from Roche. A ≅0.71 kb fragment of IGF-1R cDNA (EcoRI insert from ATCC clone pIGF-1R.8, subcloned into pGEM-7Zf) was kindly provided by Dr. Murray Korc (University of California, Irvine, CA). Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma or Fisher Scientific. Animal Models of Diabetes—Two different models of diabetes were used in this study. Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes was obtained by injecting STZ (75 mg/kg body weight, intravenous) to 5-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats. Zucker Fatty rats (ZDF fa/fa) and lean control rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (9Phillips M.S. Liu Q. Hammond H. Dugan V. Hey P. Caskey C.T. Hess J.F. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 18-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Blood glucose levels were monitored by tail vein sampling, the diabetic rats were harvested 10 days after the onset of diabetes (random glucose > 200 mg/dL). The animal experimental protocol was approved by the IACUC at University of California, Irvine. Cell Culture and Transduction of Adenoviral Constructs—Primary cultures of neonatal cardiomyocytes were prepared from Sprague-Dawley rats according to a protocol we previously described (2Wu W. Lee W-L. Wu Y.Y. Chen D. Liu T-J. Jang A. Sharma P.M. Wang P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40113-40119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The construction of recombinant adenoviruses expressing Hsp10, Hsp60, and the control adenovirus Ad-SR was described previously (7Lau S. Patnaik N. Sayen M.R. Mestril R. Circulation. 1997; 96: 2287-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 10Lin K.M. Lin B. Lian I.Y. Mestril R. Scheffler I.E. Dillmann W.H. Circulation. 2001; 103: 1787-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In brief, the human HSP60 and HSP10 genes were cloned into the multiple cloning site of the adenoviral shuttle plasmid pACCMVpLpASR. The viruses were replicated in 293 cells, purified by Virakit™ from Virapau (Carlsbad, CA), and the viral titers were determined by plaque assay in 293 cells. Cardiomyocytes were plated in 100-mm Petri dishes in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. When indicated, the cells were infected with adenoviruses of Ad-SR, Ad-Hsp10, or Ad-Hsp60 and incubated for 36–48 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cell Viability—Cell viability was performed by staining the cells with calcein AM (Molecular Probe, Eugene, OR) as previously described (2Wu W. Lee W-L. Wu Y.Y. Chen D. Liu T-J. Jang A. Sharma P.M. Wang P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40113-40119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Calcein AM hydrolyzes to calcein and retains only in live cells, thus serves as an indicator for cell viability. To measure cell viability, cardiomyocytes were plated in 48-well plates. After rinsing twice with 1× PBS buffer (pH 7.4), 200 μl of 1 μm calcein AM (in 1× PBS) were added to each well and incubated for 45 min at room temperature in the dark. The plates were analyzed with the Cytofluor 2300 Fluorescence Measurement System (Millipore) at excitation of 485 nm and emission of 530 nm. Western Blot—Cardiomyocytes were infected with Ad-SR (control cells), Ad-Hsp10, or Ad-Hsp60 for 48h and incubated in serum-free medium overnight. The cells were treated with IGF-1 or vehicles when indicated. Then the cells were lysed with lysis buffer (137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 3 μg/ml aprotinin, 3 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm NaF, 10 mm NaPP, and 2 mm Na3VO4). Equal amounts of proteins from each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and incubated with a blocking buffer (5% nonfat milk in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were sequentially incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, washed three times (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, and 0. 1% Tween 20), incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times, and then detected with ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was carried out as we previously reported (8Kirchhoff S.R. Gupta S. Knowlton A.A. Circulation. 2002; 105: 2899-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed and the lysates (500 μg proteins in 1 ml) were pre-absorbed with 20 μl protein A/G agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 30 min on a rocking platform, spun for 5 min at 10,000 rpm for 10 s, and the supernatant was incubated with specific primary antibody at 4 °C overnight. After incubation with 20 μl protein A/G agarose beads for 1.5 h at 4 °C, the immunocomplexes were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with ice-cold washing buffer (137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0; 2 mm PMSF, and 2 mm Na3VO4). The final products were briefly boiled and resolved with SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with specific antibodies as indicated. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNAs were isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The quality of RNA was verified by electrophoresis with 1% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde. Northern blots were performed with a non-radioactive method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche). In brief, equal amounts of total RNA were resolved with 1% agarose gel (6% formaldehyde), blotted, and cross-linked onto nylon membranes. IGF-1 receptor RNA probes were labeled with digoxigenin by in vitro transcription in the presence of digoxigenin-11-UTP. Hybridization was performed at 68 °C overnight in DIG Easy Hyb solution (Roche) containing denatured digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes (100 ng/ml). After hybridization, the membranes were washed two times in 2× SSC + 0.1% SDS for 10 min at room temperature and two times in 0.1× SSC + 0.1% SDS at 60 °C for 15 min. Membranes were sequentially incubated with a blocking solution for 30 min, anti-digoxigenin antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (1:10000) for 30 min at room temperature, and rinsed twice in the washing buffer (15 min each). After equilibrating for 5 min in the detection buffer, the blots were developed with the CDP-Star and exposed to film. β-actin probes were used as control probe in these blots. Reducing Hsp60 Expression with Hsp60 Antisense Oligo—Hsp60 antisense oligonucleotides (AS) were introduced to cardiomyocytes to reduce the expression of endogenous Hsp60. Phosphorothioate oligonucleotides were obtained from TriLink BioTechnologies (San Diego, CA). The antisense Hsp60 (AS) sequence corresponds to bases 109 to 123 (5′-TAAGGCTCGAGCATC-3′) of rat Hsp60 and a scrambled oligo (SCR) (5′-GCTCGTGGTCAATAC-3′) was used as a control oligo as previously described (8Kirchhoff S.R. Gupta S. Knowlton A.A. Circulation. 2002; 105: 2899-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Cardiomyocytes were incubated with AS or SCR (25 μg/ml) in serum-free medium for 24 h. Statistical Analysis—The data were expressed as mean ± S.E. based on data derived from three to six independent experiments. The intensity of bands from Western and Northern blots were scanned with densitometry and digitally analyzed. The statistical significance was tested by Student's t test or analysis of variance with post hoc analysis when appropriate. A p value below 0.05 was considered statistically significant. IGF-1 Signaling in the Cardiomyocytes Overexpressing Hsp10 or Hsp60 —If Hsp10 or Hsp60 can modulate IGF-1 receptor signaling, overexpression of Hsp10, and Hsp60 should change IGF-1 receptor autophosphorylation. To this end, neonatal cardiomyocytes were transduced with adenoviral vectors carrying Hsp10 or Hsp60. As shown in Fig 1a, the abundance of Hsp10 and Hsp60 respectively increased (Hsp60, 321 ± 31%; Hsp10, 401 ± 29%; p < 0.001 versus Ad-SR) in the cardiomyocytes infected with Ad-Hsp10 and Ad-Hsp60. Autophosphorylation of IGF-1 receptor was accordingly enhanced in the cardiomyocytes transduced with Hsp10 or Hsp60 (Fig. 1b). Immunoblots with anti-IGF-1 receptor β subunits antibodies showed that the abundance of IGF-1 receptor protein was increased in the cells overexpressing Hsp10 or Hsp60 (Fig. 1b). Further analysis on receptor phosphorylation showed an increased stoichiometry of phosphorylation/receptor protein in the cells overexpressing Hsp10 or Hsp60 (p < 0.01, Ad-Hsp10 or Ad-Hsp60 versus Ad-SR), which suggests there were more functioning IGF-1 receptor available in response to IGF-1 activation (Fig. 1c). In these studies, the effect of Hsp60 appeared more robust than the effect of Hsp10 (p < 0.03). Further experiments showed that IGF-1-stimulated phosphorylation of MEK, Erk, Akt, and p90Rsk were accordingly increased in the cells overexpressing Hsp10 or Hsp60 (Fig. 1d). The effect of Hsp10 and Hsp60 on IGF-1 signaling occurred at pharmacological as well as physiological concentrations of IGF-1 (Fig. 1e). The effects of Hsp60 and Hsp10 on signaling were more significant at physiological concentrations of IGF-1. At maximal concentration of IGF-1 (10–8m) the augmentative effect of Hsp10 and Hsp60 were moderate. Interestingly, at physiological concentrations of IGF-1, phosphorylation of Akt were more robust than phosphorylation of MEK and p90RSK in the cells overexpressing Hsp60. The Effect of Hsp10 and Hsp60 Involves Post-translational Modification of IGF-1 Receptor—To determine whether the effect of Hsp10 and Hsp60 on IGF-1 receptor involves increased synthesis IGF-1 receptor, cycloheximide or vehicles were added to the culture medium in the cells overexpressing Hsp10 or Hsp60 (Fig. 2a). In these cells, cycloheximide reduced the abundance of IGF-1 receptor; the relative elevation of IGF-1R in the Hsp10/60-transduced cells treated with cycloheximide was the same as in the controls. However, the level of IGF-1 receptor remained higher in the cells overexpressing Hsp10 or Hsp60. This suggests that the effect of Hsp10 and Hsp60 on IGF-1 receptor did not involve protein synthesis. To further confirm that Hsp10 or Hsp60 did not increase IGF-1 receptor synthesis, we had analyzed the abundance of IGF-1 receptor mRNA with Northern blots (Fig. 2b). The results showed that IGF-1 receptor mRNA level was not up-regulated by Hsp10 or Hsp60. These data render evidence that Hsp10 and Hsp60 might have modulated the abundance of IGF-1 receptor through post-translational modification. Proteolysis can be enhanced through ubiquitination of proteins. To explore whether Hsp10 and Hsp60 can regulate ubiquitination of IGF-1 receptor, we next analyzed the abundance of ubiquitinated IGF-1 receptor β subunits. As shown in Fig. 2c, the abundance of ubiquinated IGF-1 receptor β subunits was significantly reduced in the cells transduced with Hsp10 and Hsp60. The ubiquitinated IGF-1 receptors migrated around 180 Kd and around 130–140 Kd , suggesting that these receptors were polyubiquitinated. Thus, the effect of Hsp10 and Hsp60 on IGF-1 receptor degradation might have involved inhibition of IGF-1 receptor polyubiquitination. In consistent with the effect of Hsp10 and Hsp60 on IGF-1 receptor signaling, the effect of Hsp60 on receptor ubiquitination is more robust than the effect of Hsp10. These findings suggest that the effect of Hsp10 and Hsp60 on IGF-1 receptor signaling involves post-translational modification of receptor. Antisense Hsp60 Reduced IGF-1 Receptor Signaling—If Hsp60 plays a major role in the modulation of IGF-1 receptor signaling in cardiac muscle, reduced expression of Hsp60 should lead to a reduction in IGF-1 receptor protein and receptor signaling. To this end, an antisense Hsp60 was transfected to the cardiomyocytes to reduce endogenous Hsp60 expression as shown in Fig. 3a. The control oligo (SCR) did not affect the expression of Hsp60. The reduction of Hsp60 was accompanied by a decrease of IGF-1 receptor protein in the cells transfected with antisense Hsp60. Using this approach, we have characterized the abundance of IGF-1 receptor protein and receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in the control and IGF-1-stimulated cardiomyocytes (Fig. 3b). IGF-1-stimulated receptor tyrosine phosphorylation was significantly reduced in the cells transfected with antisense Hsp60, and was accompanied by decreased activation of Akt, MEK, Erk, and p90Rsk. Thus, reducing Hsp60 expression lead to attenuation of IGF-1 receptor signaling. To determine whether down-regulation of Hsp60 attenuated survival action of IGF-1, cardiomyocytes were subjected to serum withdrawal in the presence or absence of IGF-1 (Fig. 3c). Serum withdrawal reduced cell survival in the cardiomyocytes. As expected, IGF-1 rescued cardiomyocytes from the effect of serum withdrawal in the un-transfected cells and the control-oligo-transfected cells. However, the pro-survival effect of IGF-1 was inhibited in the cells transfected with the antisense Hsp60. The Relationship of Hsp60 and IGF-1 Receptor Protein in Diabetic Myocardium—Our findings thus far suggest that Hsp60 is involved in the regulation of IGF-1 receptor signaling in cardiac muscle cells. Because IGF-1 signaling enhances myocardial protection, Hsp60 may modulate myocardial survival through modulation of IGF-1 receptor signaling. An important feature of diabetic cardiomyopathy is decreased myocardial protection against myocardial injuries. To investigate whether the occurrence of diabetes lead to perturbation of Hsp60 and IGF-1 receptor, we first analyzed the abundance of myocardial Hsp60 and IGF-1 receptor protein in STZ-induced diabetes (Fig. 4a). The abundance of Hsp60 and IGF-1 receptor was concomitantly reduced in the STZ-diabetic myocardium. In contrast, the abundance of insulin receptor was up-regulated as expected (11Wang P.H. Almahfouz A. Giorgino F. McCowen K.C. Smith R.J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1141-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition to Hsp60, we also investigated Hsp10 in the normal and diabetic myocardium. Unfortunately, the levels of myocardial Hsp10 were quite low and could not be reliably detected with immunoblot. To further confirm the changes of Hsp60 and IGF-1 receptor in diabetic state, we next studied the ZDF rats and the lean controls. The levels of Hsp60 and IGF-1 receptor protein were reduced in the ZDF myocardium (Fig. 4, b and c). The content of Hsp60 and IGF-1 receptor proteins were both decreased in the myocardium and adipose tissue (Fig 4c). Hsp60 and IGF-1 receptor were unchanged in the liver, but Hsp60 and IGF-1 receptor were simultaneously increased in the kidney (Fig. 4c). These observations support our hypothesis that Hsp60 modulates the abundance of IGF-1 receptor. If the reduction of myocardial IGF-1 receptor in diabetic myocardium involves post-translational modification, ubiquitination of IGF-1 receptor should have increased in the diabetic myocardium. To this end, we have analyzed ubiquitination of IGF-1 receptor in the ZDF myocardium. As shown in Fig. 4c, there was increased polyubiquitination of IGF-1 receptor in the diabetic myocardium. These observations suggest that the mechanisms underlying the reduction of IGF-1 receptor in diabetic myocardium may involve down-regulation of Hsp60 and subsequent alterations in post-translational modification. IGF-1 plays an important role in myocardial protection and remodeling (12Wang P.H. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 552-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The biological actions of IGF-1 are mediated through activation of IGF-1 receptors on cell surface. Previous studies (1LeRoith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar, 13Condorelli G. Bueno R. Smith R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8510-8516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kim J.J. Accili D. Growth. Horm. IGF Res. 2002; 12: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) have shown that IGF-1 receptor signaling can be modulated in a number of ways, such as increased synthesis of IGF-1 receptors, formation of hybrid IGF-1/insulin receptors, different IGF-1 receptor isoforms, and interactions between IGF-1 receptors and secondary signaling/adaptor proteins. In this study we have identified Hsp10 and Hsp60 as novel modulators of IGF-1 receptor signaling in cardiac muscle. This is the first report showing that members of the heat shock protein family can augment IGF-1 receptor signaling in cardiac muscle cells through post-translational modification of the receptor. There are growing interests in the role of heat shock proteins in cardiac muscle biology (15Latchman D.S. Cardiovasc Res. 2001; 51: 637-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Heat shock proteins were originally discovered as a set of proteins induced by temperature increase. A wide array of biological actions of heat shock proteins have been identified, such as protein folding/unfolding, protein degradation, anti-oxidative stress, and anti-apoptosis. During the last two years, several studies showed important function of Hsp60 in the heart (7Lau S. Patnaik N. Sayen M.R. Mestril R. Circulation. 1997; 96: 2287-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 16Gupta S. Knowlton A.A. Circulation. 2002; 106: 2727-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 17Schafler A.E. Kirmanoglou K. Balbach J. Pecher P. Hannekum A. Schumacher B. Basic Res Cardiol. 2002; 97: 258-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The expression of myocardial Hsp60 is increased under ischemic distress (17Schafler A.E. Kirmanoglou K. Balbach J. Pecher P. Hannekum A. Schumacher B. Basic Res Cardiol. 2002; 97: 258-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and overexpression of Hsp60 lead to inhibition of apoptosis in the cardiomyocytes underwent ischemic and reperfusion injuries (10Lin K.M. Lin B. Lian I.Y. Mestril R. Scheffler I.E. Dillmann W.H. Circulation. 2001; 103: 1787-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). These findings, along with studies showed protective role of Hsp60 in tissues other than cardiac muscle (18Izaki K. Kinouchi H. Watanabe K. Owada Y. Okubo A. Itoh H. Kondo H. Tashima Y. Tamura S. Yoshimoto T. Mizoi K. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 88: 14-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), emphasized the protect effect of Hsp60. The present study showed a causal relationship between the abundance of Hsp60 and the magnitude of IGF-1 receptor signaling, which suggests the pro-survival action of Hsp60 may involve augmentation of IGF-1 receptor signaling. Although both Hsp10 and Hsp60 modulated IGF-1 receptor signaling, the effects of Hsp10 were less profound than that of Hsp60. Furthermore, the abundance of myocardial Hsp10 is low and cannot be reliably detected with Western blots in the two lines of normal/diabetic rats we studied (data not shown). Thus, between these two heat shock proteins, it appears that Hsp60 is the major modulator of IGF-1 receptor signaling in myocardium. Emerging evidence suggest that heat shock proteins are involved in the regulation of intracellular signaling. Hsp90 chaperones STAT3 signaling at plasma membrane and during the formation of cytosolic STAT3 signaling complexes (19Shah M. Patel K. Fried V.A. Sehgal P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45662-45669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Hsp90 also chaperones steroid receptor, Raf, Akt, and cdk4 (20Czar M.J. Galigniana M.D. Silverstein A.M. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7776-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 21Basso A.D. Solit D.B. Chiosis G. Giri B. Tsichlis P. Rosen N. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The role of Hsp60 on intracellular signaling is rarely explored, but Hsp60 was recently identified as a protein associated with integrin and is involved in the activation of α3β1 integrin in breast cancer cells (23Barazi H.O. Zhou L. Templeton N.S. Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1541-1548PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in the present study, Hsp60 likely modulates intracellular signaling at more than one signaling step. Some heat shock proteins, such as Hsp90, are known for their inhibitory effect on protein ubiquitination and degradation. Ubiquitin/proteasome pathway enables rapid protein degradation. Sepp-Lorenzino et al. (6Sepp-Lorenzino L. Ma Z. Lebwohl D.E. Vinitsky A. Rosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16580-16587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) had shown that chemical inhibitors of the 20S proteasome can prevent degradation of IGF-1 receptor, which suggests ubiquitination of IGF-1 receptor play a major role in the regulation of IGF-1 receptor degradation. Diabetic myocardium is different from other forms of cardiomyopathy regarding the expression of Hsp60. As discussed earlier, Hsp60 expression is increased during ischemic/reperfusion injury, probably representing a myocardial self-defense mechanism (17Schafler A.E. Kirmanoglou K. Balbach J. Pecher P. Hannekum A. Schumacher B. Basic Res Cardiol. 2002; 97: 258-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). But we have found that Hsp60 expression was reduced in diabetic myocardium. Down-regulation of myocardial Hsp60 and its functional implications in the context of diabetic cardiomyopathy have not been investigated previously. The changes of myocardial Hsp60 and IGF-1 receptor were consistent in both STZ-DM (type 1 DM model) and ZDF-DM (type 2 DM model) rats, which indicates down-regulation of Hsp60 and IGF-1 receptor is a common feature of diabetic myocardium. These findings provide evidence that reduced Hsp60 proteins may contribute to an escalation of IGF-1 receptor ubiquitination and subsequent decline in the number of functional IGF-1 receptor in diabetic myocardium. Using antisense approach (Fig. 3), our results showed that the pro-survival effect of IGF-1 was suppressed when Hsp60 was decreased and IGF-1 signaling reduced. IGF-1 receptor signaling protects myocardium from injuries through suppression of oxidative stress, inhibition of cardiac muscle apoptosis, enhancement of contractile function, and modulation of cardiac-specific genes (2Wu W.

Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1991-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Reduced IGF-1 receptor abundance can lead to decreased myocardial protection during myocardial ischemia and thus may play a fundamental role during the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Our data not only raise the possibility that dysregulation of Hsp60-IGF-1 receptor axis represents a new paradigm contributing to the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy, but also corroborate and extend previous reports that augmentation of IGF-1 signaling will likely lead to better myocardial protection in diabetic cardiomyopathy (25Kajstura, J., Fiordaliso, F., Andreoli, A.

Further insight into the mechanisms responsible for the effect of Hsp10 and, especially, Hsp60 on ubiquitination of cardiac IGF-1 receptor may provide new opportunities to design novel therapeutic strategies for diabetic cardiomyopathy.

Aβ is derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP), but the mechanisms that regulate APP processing to produce Aβ are not fully understood. X11α (also known as munc-18-interacting protein-1 (Mint1)) is a neuronal adaptor protein that binds APP and modulates APP processing in transfected non-neuronal cells. To investigate the in vivo effect of X11α on Aβ production in the brain, we created transgenic mice that overexpress X11α and crossed these with transgenics harboring a familial Alzheimer's disease mutant APP that produces increased levels of Aβ (APPswe Tg2576 mice). Analyses of Aβ levels in the offspring generated from two separate X11α founder mice revealed a significant, approximate 20% decrease in Aβ(1-40) in double transgenic mice expressing APPswe/X11α compared with APPswe mice. At a key time point in Aβ plaque deposition (8 months old), the number of Aβ plaques was also deceased in APPswe/X11α mice. Thus, we report here the first demonstration that X11α inhibits Aβ production and deposition in vivo in the brain.

However, whether it fulfills similar functions in vivo within the brain has not so far been established.

For crossing of X11α and APPswe lines, male APPswe Tg2576 animals were mated with female X11α mice. Northern Analyses—Mouse brains were removed and bisected along the midline. One half was utilized for analyses of mRNA/protein expression (see below), and the other half was used for Aβ assays. RNA was prepared using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA samples were quantified by spectrophotometric analysis, and their integrity was confirmed by observing 28 and 18 S ribosomal species following electrophoresis in denaturing 1% agarose gels in MOPS buffer (40 mm MOPS, 10 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2) containing 2% formaldehyde. For Northern blotting, 20 μg of each sample were separated as above and transferred to Gene-Screen Plus membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The probes were labeled with [γ-32P]dCTP by random priming using a Prime-It II kit (Stratagene). APP mRNA was detected using a full-length human APP cDNA probe, and β-actin was detected with a commercial probe (Clontech). Hybridizations washings and autoradiography were performed as previously described (41McLoughlin D.M. Irving N.G. Brownlees J. Brion J.-P. Leroy K. Miller C.C.J. Eur. J.

SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Mouse brains were weighed and prepared as 10%(w/v) homogenate in ice-cold 125 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA plus complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). One-quarter volume of 10% SDS sample buffer was then added, and the samples were heated in a boiling water bath for 10 min. Protein concentrations were determined using Markwell assays. The samples were separated on 8% (w/v) acrylamide gels and transferred to Protran nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) using a Bio-Rad TransBlot system. The blots were probed with primary antibodies, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit Igs (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. X11α was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (28Lau K.-F. McLoughlin D.M. Standen C. Miller C.C.J. Mol.

APP was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody generated using a synthetic peptide to the last 21 amino acid residues of APP (28Lau K.-F. McLoughlin D.M. Standen C. Miller C.C.J. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2000; 16: 555-563Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To calculate the relative amounts of APP in the different mouse brain samples, increasing amounts (2.5-40 μg) of total brain proteins were probed for APP on immunoblots, and the signals were then quantified by pixel densitometry using a Bio-Rad GS710 imaging densitometer and Quantity 1 software as described (42Lau K.F.

From these data, standard curves were generated so as to demonstrate that the protein amounts loaded on the gels gave APP signals on the immunoblots that were within the linear range. Immunohistochemical Analyses—Transgenic X11α distribution was analyzed by immunostaining for the Myc tag using antibody 9B11. Brains from 10-12-week-old X11α transgenic and nontransgenic mice were fixed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and then cryoprotected at 4 °C in a solution of 30% sucrose in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 40 mm Tris, 0.7% NaCl in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.8) containing 0.05% sodium azide prior to freezing on dry ice and storage at -80 °C. 40-μm frozen sections were cut coronally or saggitally from either hemisphere, collected in TBS-azide buffer, and stored at 4 °C prior to immunohistochemical staining. The optimal concentrations of primary and secondary antisera were determined by performing a checkerboard titration on transgenic tissue. The sections were labeled by blocking endogenous peroxidase activity with 1% H2O2 in TBS for 15 min and then blocking with 15% normal goat serum. The sections were then incubated with antibody 9B11 diluted 1:5000 in TBS-T (TBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100) with 10% normal goat serum for 16 h at 4 °C, washed in TBS-T, and then incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit Igs (Vector Laboratories) diluted in TBS-T/10% normal goat serum. Following washing in TBS, the sections were further incubated for 2 h in avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex in TBS (Vectastain, Vector Laboratories), washed in TBS, and developed with 0.05% diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and 0.001% H2O2 in TBS. The sections were mounted on gelatin-chrome alumcoated Superfrost slides, air-dried overnight, cleared in xylene, and coverslipped with DPX (Merck). To detect Aβ deposits, the brains were fixed as above, embedded in paraffin wax, and stained as described previously using antibody 1E8 that detects residues 13-27 of Aβ (43Kurt M.A. Davies D.C. Kidd M. Duff K. Rolph S.C. Jennings K.H. Howlett D.R. Exp. Neurol. 2001; 171: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10-μm coronal sections through the cortex and hippocampus of APPswe and APPswe/X11α double transgenic mice were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and then treated with 85% formic acid for 8 min. Following washes and incubation with primary and secondary antibodies, reactivity was developed with Vectastain Elite ABC solution (Vector Laboratories) and diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride with nickel enhancement, and the sections were dehydrated and mounted in DPX. The images were captured on a Zeiss Axioscope 2 MOT using an Axiocam and Axiovision software (Zeiss). The diameters of plaques were determined using Metamorph image analysis software. Aβ Assays—Aβ species were assayed using commercial ELISA assay kits. Aβ(1-40) was assayed using human amyloid β(1-40)-(N) ELISA (IBL, Hamburg, Germany) and Aβ(1-42) detected using Innotest β-amyloid(1-42) ELISA (Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium). Brain samples were prepared for assay by homogenization as 20% homogenates using a Dounce homogenizer as described (44Moechars D. Dewachter I. Lorent K. Reverse D. Baekelandt V. Naidu A. Tesseur I.

The protein concentrations were determined using Bradford assays. The data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance tests. We created X11α transgenic mice using the mouse prion gene promoter and regulatory elements to drive expression as previously described for other genes (38Borchelt D.R. Ratovitski T. Van Lare J.

To facilitate detection of transgene-derived X11α, we placed a Myc epitope tag on the carboxyl terminus of the protein. We obtained five transgenic founders, were able to breed from four of these, and selected the two highest level expressors as determined by immunoblot analyses (lines 10 and 15) for further study. Immunoblotting with an X11α antibody and antibody 9B11 to the Myc tag revealed that transgenic X11α protein was expressed principally in the brain, which is in agreement with previous studies that have utilized the prion promoter (38Borchelt D.R.

Comparisons of X11α expression in the brains of transgenic and nontransgenic littermate mice by densitometric analyses of immunoblots revealed that X11α was overexpressed ∼8-fold in line 10 and 6-fold in line 15 (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Expression of X11α and APP protein in the brains of mice derived from crosses between APPswe Tg2576 mice and X11α lines 10 and 15 mice.A shows immunoblots of two animals of each genotype probed with an antibody to X11α, antibody 9B11 to the Myc tag on transgenic X11α, and an antibody to APP as indicated. 10 μg of protein is loaded in each track.

These studies revealed that transgenic X11α protein was distributed in a similar, if not identical fashion in both transgenic lines where Myc immunoreactivity was present in neurons in a diverse number of brain regions including the cortex, hippocampus, and scattered subcortical nuclei but with no obvious expression in cells with glial morphology (Fig. 3). Myc immunoreactivity was present in apical dendrites in the cortex and hippocampus but was particularly prominent in neuronal cell bodies and proximal dendrites, and this is in agreement with studies of endogenous X11α subcellular distribution where it has been shown to be enriched in the trans-Golgi network; APP is also located in these regions (30Biederer T.

Brain Res. 2001; 92: 27-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, transgenic X11α expression broadly mimics that of the endogenous protein. To investigate the effect of X11α overexpression on APP and Aβ production in the brain, we crossed each of the selected X11α transgenic lines with transgenic mice expressing a familial Alzheimer's disease mutant APP harboring the double K670N/M671L Swedish mutation (transgenic APPswe mice line Tg2576). These APPswe mice secrete increased levels of human Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42) (39Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F.S. Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3712) Google Scholar). This approach of crossing Alzheimer's disease mutant APP mice with other transgenics to investigate the effect of a particular transgene on Aβ production has now been utilized in a number of studies. These include investigating the effects of wild-type and mutant presenilin 1 and β-secretase on Aβ production (38Borchelt D.R. Ratovitski T. Van Lare J. Lee M.K. Gonzales V. Jenkins N.A.

Analyses of the offspring derived from these crosses revealed that their genotypes approximated that expected of Mendelian inheritance (one-quarter each nontransgenic, APPswe transgenic, X11α transgenic, and APPswe/X11α double transgenic). There was no evidence of any gross abnormal phenotype in any of the mice. Northern blots demonstrated that overexpression of X11α had no detectable effect on the steady-state levels of either endogenous mouse or transgenic human APP mRNAs (Fig. 4). To determine whether overexpression of X11α influenced APP holoprotein levels, we performed quantitative immunoblots for APP on the different brain samples. We first generated standard curves for APP signal on the blots (Fig. 2B) and, by loading amounts of protein (10 μg) that fell within the linear range for this signal, analyzed the relative APP levels in the different mice generated from the various crosses. Statistical analyses of these data by one-way analysis of variance tests revealed that X11α had no effect on the steady-state levels of either endogenous mouse or transgenic human APP protein (all data not shown but see Fig. 2A for examples of signals obtained from nontransgenic, APPswe, X11α, and APPswe/X11α transgenic mice). We next compared the levels of human Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42) in the brains of APPswe and APPswe/X11α double transgenic mice aged between 10 and 12 weeks. For X11α line 10 transgenic crosses, we observed a significant, 24% reduction in Aβ(1-40) levels in APPswe/X11α double transgenics compared with APPswe only littermates (p = 0.0015). For X11α line 15 transgenic crosses, we again observed a significant 17% reduction in Aβ(1-40) levels in APPswe/X11α double transgenics compared with APPswe littermates (p = 0.0331) (Fig. 5). The more marked reduction of Aβ(1-40) levels in X11α line 10 is consistent with the higher levels of X11α protein detected in these animals. Analyses of Aβ(1-42) levels in the mice revealed no significant differences between any genotypes. Thus, overexpression of X11α reduces Aβ(1-40) but not Aβ(1-42) levels in the brains of the APPswe Tg2576 transgenic mice, and this effect is not mediated via a detectable effect on the steady-state levels of APP mRNA or protein. Finally, we analyzed Aβ deposition in the brains of APPswe and APPswe/X11α double transgenic mice. For these experiments we focused on transgenic line 10, which expressed the highest level of X11α. At 7-8 months of age, APPswe Tg2576 develop Aβ plaque deposits similar to those seen in Alzheimer's disease (40Kawarabayashi T. Younkin L.H. Saido T.C. Shoji M. Ashe K.H. Younkin S.G. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 372-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because this age is a key time point in the development of Alzheimer's pathology, we analyzed 8-month-old animals. Coronal sections through the cortex and hippocampus of APPswe and APPswe/X11α double transgenic mice were labeled for Aβ deposits using antibody 1E8, and the number of plaques/section was counted. Statistical analyses of these data revealed a significant reduction in the number of Aβ plaques in the APPswe/X11α double transgenic mice (Fig. 6). We also compared the size of plaques in APPswe and APPswe/X11α double transgenic mice and discovered that the mean diameter of plaques was reduced in the APPswe/X11α animals (mean diameter of plaques in APPswe mice, 28.3 μm; mean diameter of plaques in APPswe/X11α mice, 15.5 μm). Statistical analyses of these data revealed a significant difference (p = 0.027 by one-way analysis of variance test). Thus, the number and size of amyloid plaques in the cortex/hippocampus are reduced in APPswe/X11α mice. The X11s are a family of adaptor proteins comprising three members, X11α, X11β, and X11γ, all of which bind to the carboxyl terminus of APP (6McLoughlin D.M. Miller C.C.J.

Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1988-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), although there is currently no evidence to demonstrate that any X11 protein modulates APP processing and Aβ secretion in vivo in the brain. Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of X11α reduces Aβ levels and Aβ plaque numbers in the brains of APPswe transgenic mice. Our analyses revealed that whereas Aβ(1-40) levels were significantly reduced in APPswe/X11α mice, we observed no such changes in Aβ(1-42) levels. Whether this remains the case in older mice in which Aβ(1-42) levels are 1000-fold higher (40Kawarabayashi T. Younkin L.H. Saido T.C. Shoji M. Ashe K.H. Younkin S.G. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 372-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) will require analyses of aged animals. Alternatively, X11α may have a selective effect on Aβ(1-40) production at all ages because the related X11β has been shown to inhibit secretion of Aβ(1-40) but not Aβ(1-42) in transfected cells (13Tomita S. Ozaki T. Taru H. Oguchi S. Takeda S. Yagi Y. Sakiyama S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2243-2254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, it is notable that even in the relatively young animals analyzed here, we see a marked reduction by ∼20% in the levels of Aβ(1-40), and this is sufficient to reduce the number of Aβ plaques that are deposited in 8-month-old APPswe/X11α mice. This reduction in Aβ plaque numbers was more marked than the 24% reduction in Aβ(1-40) levels would predict, and this might suggest that overexpression of X11α acts to delay Aβ deposition. Indeed, the age at which Aβ deposition was analyzed (8 months) is a key time point in the development of Alzheimer's disease pathology in the APPswe Tg2576 model and one where Aβ plaque deposits are first observed (40Kawarabayashi T. Younkin L.H. Saido T.C. Shoji M. Ashe K.H. Younkin S.G. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 372-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a contrasting fashion, crossing of APPswe Tg2576 mice with Alzheimer's disease mutant presenilin 1 transgenics accelerates Aβ plaque formation at this age (46Holcomb L. Gordon M.N. McGowan E. Yu X. Benkovic S. Jantzen P. Wright K. Saad I. Mueller R. Morgan D. Sanders S. Zehr C. O'Campo K. Hardy J. Prada C.M. Eckman C. Younkin S. Hsiao K. Duff K. Nat.

Thus, it will therefore be interesting to examine Aβ deposition in older and aged APPswe/X11α mice so as to establish the full profile of pathological changes. Additionally, because APPswe mice display spatial memory deficits (39Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F.S. Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3712) Google Scholar, 53Westerman M.A. Cooper-Blacketer D. Mariash A. Kotilinek L. Kawarabayashi T. Younkin L.H. Carlson G.A. Younkin S.G. Ashe K.H.

The mechanisms by which X11α inhibits Aβ production are not clear. In cell transfection studies, overexpression of X11α is accompanied by increased stability of full-length APP (16Mueller H.T.

However, these effects of X11α on APP in the highly overexpressing transfected cells are more marked than those in our transgenic lines (e.g. Aβ production is decreased by ∼70% in one study (31Borg J.P.

In this context, it is notable that modulating presenilin 1 expression in transgenic mice alters Aβ production without a detectable effect on APP levels (54De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K.

Schoonjans L. De Strooper B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 461-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we have demonstrated that X11α binds to presenilin 1 via its PDZ domains to facilitate the formation of APP-X11α-presenilin 1 trimeric complexes (28Lau K.-F. McLoughlin D.M. Standen C. Miller C.C.J. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2000; 16: 555-563Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and this interaction has now been confirmed by others (30Biederer T. Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Liu X. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7340-7351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). X11α may therefore modulate APP processing and Aβ production via some effect on presenilin 1 that inhibits γ-secretase activity. Whatever the precise mechanisms by which X11α influences APP processing, our results demonstrate that altering its expression can reduce Aβ levels in vivo in the brain. As such, modulation of X11α function may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease."

Modification of the amino acid sequence 106-126 caused a striking increase in aggregation rate, with formation of large amount of protease-resistant amorphous material and relatively few amyloid fibrils.

Modification of the amino acid sequence 106-126 caused a striking increase in aggregation rate, with formation of large amount of protease-resistant amorphous material and relatively few amyloid fibrils. Alteration of the 127-146 region had even more profound effects, with the inability to generate amyloid fibrils. These data indicate that the intrinsic properties of PrP-(82-146) are dependent upon the integrity of the C-terminal region and account for the massive deposition of PrP amyloid in GSS.

In the presence of detergents, the protease-resistant core of PrPSc assembles into insoluble fibrillar structures with the tinctorial and ultrastructural properties of amyloid (6Prusiner S.B.

In all these conditions, amyloid fibrils are associated with PrP aggregates that are devoid of the tinctorial and ultrastructural properties of amyloid (11Giaccone G. Verga L. Bugiani O. Frangione B.

Biochemical studies have shown that amyloid fibrils purified from GSS brain contain a major PrP fragment of ∼7 kDa, spanning residues 81-82 to 144-153 of PrP (12Tagliavini F. Prelli F. Ghiso J.

This fragment is very similar in patients with different mutations (i.e. A117V, F198S, Q217R) and is derived from mutant PrP, although in GSS F198S and Q217R it does not contain the amino acid substitution (13Tagliavini F.

Evidence suggests that N- and C-terminal cleavage of abnormal PrP isoforms generating amyloid peptides occurs before rather than after fibril formation (15Piccardo P. Seiler C. Dlouhy S.R. Young K.

Western blot analysis of total brain extracts from F198S patients has revealed three major protease-resistant PrP fragments of 27-29, 18-19, and 8 kDa. The 18-19- and 8-kDa peptides are N- and C-terminal truncated, as deduced by their antigenic profile, and are unglycosylated, likely representing amyloid protein precursors (15Piccardo P. Seiler C.

Similar low molecular weight fragments have been detected in GSS patients with other PRNP mutations and are also present in areas without amyloid deposits, suggesting that regional factors feature in amyloidogenesis (15Piccardo P.

To investigate the contribution of different regions of the GSS amyloid protein to the physicochemical properties of disease-specific PrP isoforms and fibrillogenesis, we synthesized a peptide homologous to the smallest amyloid subunit purified from GSS brains (PrP-(82-146)wt) and PrP peptides with scrambled sequences thereof. In particular, we generated an entirely scrambled PrP-(82-146) (PrP-(82-146)scr) and partially scrambled PrP-(82-146), where only the sequence 106-126 (PrP-(82-146)106-126scr) or 127-146 (PrP-(82-146)127-146scr) was altered (Fig. 1). The selection of the sequences to be modified was based on previous observations that the region spanning residues 106-147 is central to amyloid fibril formation (20Tagliavini F. Prelli F. Verga L. Giaccone G. Sarma R. Gorevic P. Ghetti B. Passerini F. Ghibaudi E. Forloni G. Salmona M. Bugiani O. Frangione B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9678-9682Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In particular, a peptide comprising residues 106-126 showed high propensity to adopt stable β-sheet secondary structure and to assemble into straight, unbranched amyloid fibrils, similar in ultrastructure to those observed in GSS patients (20Tagliavini F. Prelli F. Verga L. Giaccone G. Sarma R. Gorevic P. Ghetti B. Passerini F. Ghibaudi E. Forloni G. Salmona M. Bugiani O. Frangione B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Also, a peptide spanning PrP residues 127-147 (PrP-(127-147)) was able to generate amyloid-like fibrils, resembling scrapie-associated fibrils isolated from subjects with transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (20Tagliavini F. Prelli F. Verga L. Giaccone G. Sarma R. Gorevic P. Ghetti B. Passerini F. Ghibaudi E. Forloni G. Salmona M. Bugiani O. Frangione B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Here we report that PrP-(82-146)wt has high intrinsic ability to form amyloid fibrils indistinguishable from those observed in GSS disease and that the formation of ordered structures having a parallel β-sheet organization is dependent upon the integrity of the C-terminal region. Synthesis and Purification of PrP Peptides—The following peptides were chemically synthesized: PrP-(82-146) wild type (PrP-(82-146)wt, GQPHGGGWGQGGGTHSQWNKPSKPKTNMKHMAGAAAAGAVVGGLGGYMLGSAMSRPIIHFGSDYE); PrP-(82-146) with a scrambled sequence in the region spanning residues 106-126 (PrP-(82-146)106-126scr, GQPHGGGWGQGGGTHSQWNKPSKPNGAKALMGGHGATKVVGAAAGYMLGSAMSRPIIHFGSDYE); PrP-(82-146) with a scrambled sequence in the region spanning residues 127-146 (PrP-(82-146)127-146scr, GQPHGGGWGQGGGTHSQWNKPSKPKTNMKHMAGAAAAGAVVGGLGSMYPASHGLMEDFYGIGSIR); PrP-(82-146) with a totally scrambled sequence (PrP-(82-146)scr, EADQFALGGSKHGNGMQQVAGHGGSMGAKAWGANGHPSGTGIPTAKMVPYKIYGGGWAGMGRPSS). In some experiments, the shorter peptides PrP-(106-126)wt (KTNMKHMAGAAAAGAVVGGLG) and PrP-(127-146)wt (GYMLGSAMSRTIIHFGSDYE) were also used. Peptides were prepared by solid-phase synthesis on a 433A synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) purified by reverse phase-HPLC and verified by amino acid sequencing (46600 Prosequencer, Milligen, Bedford, MA) and electrospray mass spectrometry (model 5989A, Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA) as described previously (22De Gioia L.

Hydropathic Profile and Transmembrane Helix Prediction of PrP Peptides—PrP-(82-146)wt and its analogues were analyzed by a program devised by Kyte and Doolittle (24Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16885) Google Scholar) that progressively evaluates the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of a protein along its amino acid sequence (www.expasy.ch/cgi-bin/protscale.pl). The common hydropathy value, defined at one specific position in a sequence, is the mean value of the hydrophobicity of the amino acids within a window around each position. In hydrophobic regions the hydropathy value is high for a number of consecutive positions in the sequence. The grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) is defined as the average value of the hydropathy value at each position (24Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16885) Google Scholar). For prediction of membrane protein topology the TMHMM method, based on a hidden Markov model developed by Krogh and co-workers, was applied (25Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8721) Google Scholar) (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/). Preparation of PrP Peptide Stock Solutions—Peptides were dissolved in sterile deionized water at 5 mg/ml. Under these conditions they were soluble, as deduced by the absence of a visible pellet after centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min. The stock solutions were stable for 2 weeks at -80 °C, as determined by reverse phase-HPLC. For all the experiments aliquots of stock solutions were diluted with different buffers as specified below. Sedimentation Experiments—The study was performed with 0.5 and 1 mm peptide in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. Aliquots of 30 μl were incubated at 37 °C for 1, 4, 8, 24, 48, 72, and 168 h and then chilled on ice and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were analyzed by reverse phase-HPLC, and peptide concentrations at different times were expressed as percentages of the corresponding values determined at zero time (26Salmona M. Malesani P. De Gioia L. Gorla S. Bruschi M. Molinari A. Della Vedova F. Pedrotti B. Marrari M.A. Awan T. Bugiani O. Forloni G. Tagliavini F. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). PK Digestion—Aliquots of 1 mm peptides in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm CaCl2 were incubated at 37 °C for 96 h and then digested with PK for 30 min at 1:20 (w/w) enzyme-to-substrate ratio. Proteolysis was terminated by the addition of EGTA at a final concentration of 5 mm. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the pellets were dissolved in 30 μl of 97% formic acid, and 20 μl were analyzed by reverse phase-HPLC. Control samples were processed under the same conditions in the absence of PK. The extent of the proteolysis was calculated as the percentage of the peptide present in the pellets compared with undigested controls (23Tagliavini F. Forloni G. Colombo L. Rossi G. Girola L. Canciani B. Angeretti N. Giampaolo L. Peressini E. Awan T. De Gioia L. Ragg E. Bugiani O. Salmona M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1309-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Light and Electron Microscopy—Samples of 0.5, 0.1, and 0.05 mm peptides in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, were incubated at 37 °C for 1, 4, 8, 24, 48, 72, and 168 h. At each time point, sample aliquots were analyzed by light and electron microscopy. For light microscopy, 10 μl of suspension were air-dried on poly-l-lysine-coated slides (Bio-Optica, Milan, Italy), stained with thioflavine S and Congo Red, and viewed under fluorescent or polarized light, respectively (Nikon Eclipse E-800, Kyoto, Japan). For ultrastructural examination, 5 μl of suspension were applied to Formvar-carbon 200-mesh nickel grids for 5 min, negatively stained with uranyl acetate, and observed in an electron microscope (EM109 Zeiss, Oberkoken, Germany) operated at 80 kV at a standard magnification, calibrated with an appropriate grid. The mean diameter of fibrils generated by PrP peptides after short (1 h) and long (1, 3, and 7 days) incubation was measured on printed photos at a final magnification of ×90,000 by using a computer-assisted image analyzer (Nikon, Japan) (23Tagliavini F. Forloni G. Colombo L. Rossi G. Girola L. Canciani B. Angeretti N. Giampaolo L. Peressini E. Awan T. De Gioia L. Ragg E. Bugiani O. Salmona M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1309-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). At day 7, samples were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min. The pellets were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, post-fixed in 0.1% aqueous osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in graded acetone, and embedded in epoxy resin (Spurr, Electron Microscopy Science, Fort Washington, PA). Ultrathin sections (50 nm) were collected on 200-mesh copper grids, positively stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and observed with the electron microscope. X-ray Diffraction—The peptides were analyzed under the following conditions: lyophilized, vapor-hydrated, solubilized, and then dried. Lyophilized peptide was gently packed into a siliconized thin walled glass capillary (0.7 mm diameter; Charles A. Supper Co., South Natick, MA) to form a disk. For vapor hydration, the lyophilized peptide was equilibrated against a column of water that was sealed with it in the capillary. For preparing solubilized/dried peptide assemblies, lyophilized peptide was dissolved at ∼10 mg/ml in water, and the solution was aspirated into a thin walled siliconized capillary to a column height of ∼10-12 mm. A tiny hole was poked through the sealing wax at one end of the capillary, and the sample was left to dry gradually under ambient temperature and humidity while in a 2-tesla permanent magnet (Charles A. Supper Co.) (27Oldenbourgh R. Phillips W.C. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1986; 57: 2362-2365Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which can promote fibril alignment by diamagnetic anisotropy (28Makowski L. Sweet R.M. Woodhead A.D. Brookhaven Symposium, Synchrotron Radiation in Biology. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1989: 341-347Google Scholar). Orientation and dehydration were monitored by periodic observation of sample birefringence between crossed polarizers. When the sample had dried to a small uniform disk, the capillary was transferred to a holder for x-ray diffraction. X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained using nickel-filtered, double-mirror focused CuKα radiation from an Elliott GX-20 rotating anode x-ray generator (GEC Avionics, Hertfordshire, UK) with a 200-μm focal spot, operated at 35 kV and 25 mA. A helium tunnel was placed in the x-ray path to reduce air scatter. Patterns were recorded on Eastman Kodak DEF film. The known Bragg spacing of calcite (0.3035 nm) was used to calibrate the specimen-to-film distance (87.6 mm). The Bragg spacings of reflections were measured with a 6× optical comparator directly off the films. FTIR of Peptide Aggregates—Samples of 0.1 mm PrP-(82-146)wt and PrP-(82-146)106-126scr in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Following centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min, peptide aggregates were collected and gently dried in a stream of nitrogen to remove any water residue. The samples were mixed with KBr, pulverized, and formed into a disk-shaped pellet (29Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1980: 468-477Google Scholar, 30Nillson M.R. Dobson C.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Data were collected on the solid pellets at room temperature with a Fourier transform IR spectrum BX (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for wavelengths in the range of 4000 to 400 cm-1. The spectral processing and the determination of the secondary structures from the intensities of bands in the second derivative amide I spectra were performed as described by Caughey et al. (3Caughey B.W. Dong A. Bhat K.S. Ernst D. Hayes S.F. Caughey W.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7672-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). As indicated by the relatively small signal of the second derivative spectrum in the range 1720-1800 cm-1 (Fig. 8A, inset), there was little or no appreciable residual water vapor contribution to the spectrum, and the signal-to-noise was sufficiently high for the secondary structure determination. Membrane Microviscosity Determination—Membrane microviscosity was assessed in suspensions of primary cultures of rat cortical neurons using DPH as a fluorescent probe as described previously (31Salmona M. Forloni G. Diomede L. Algeri M. De Gioia L. Angeretti N. Giaccone G. Tagliavini F. Bugiani O. Neurobiol. Dis. 1997; 4: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The reported FP (expressed as arbitrary units) is a function of the emission (420 nm) detected through an analyzer oriented parallel (p1) and perpendicular (p2) to the direction of the polarization of the exciting light (365 nm), according to the equation FP = (p2 - p1)/(p2 + p1) (12Tagliavini F. Prelli F. Ghiso J. Bugiani O. Serban D. Prusiner S.B. Farlow M.R. Ghetti B. Frangione B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Membrane microviscosity (η, poise) is related to FP according to the equation η = 2FP/0.46 - FP. Neuronal cells (2 × 106 cell/ml) were mechanically detached, gently centrifuged at 550 × g for 10 min, washed with saline, resuspended in 2.5 ml of 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2 μm DPH, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. PrP peptides were dissolved in 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and tested within 10 min of solubilization. The FP value was determined at 25 °C, before and 30 min after the addition of 25 μm PrP peptides to cell suspensions (31Salmona M. Forloni G. Diomede L. Algeri M. De Gioia L. Angeretti N. Giaccone G. Tagliavini F. Bugiani O. Neurobiol. Dis. 1997; 4: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Hydropathic Profile of PrP-(82-146) Peptides—The hydropathic profile of the peptides selected for study was evaluated according to the Kyte and Doolittle scale (24Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16885) Google Scholar). The analysis showed that PrP-(82-146)wt has an N-terminal hydrophilic region followed by an extended hydrophobic domain spanning residues 112-131, with a maximum of 1.844 at Gly-119 and a minimum of 0.633 at Gly-131. PrP-(82-146)127-146scr exhibited a similar profile, whereas the alteration of the 106-126 sequence (PrP-(82-146)106-126scr) resulted in a shorter hydrophobic region spanning residues 120-131, with a maximum of 1.511 at Ala-124 and a minimum of 0.633 at Gly-131. PrP-(82-146)scr showed a flat profile, consistent with its disarranged hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains compared with PrP-(82-146)wt (Fig. 1). Disarrangement of C-terminal Region of PrP-(82-146) Has Profound Effect on Peptide Aggregation—To investigate the ability of PrP-(82-146)wt and its analogues to form macroaggregates, we carried out sedimentation experiments. Peptides were dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, incubated at 37 °C for 0-96 h, and then centrifuged. The supernatants were analyzed by HPLC to determine the percentage of peptide still in solution after centrifugation. The aggregation kinetics of PrP-(82-146)wt was substantially linear during the first 3 days, yielding ∼25, 40, and 60% of sedimentable peptide after 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively. Thereafter, the peptide showed an increased aggregation rate, and more than 90% was found in the pellet after 96 h. The modification of the amino acid sequence 106-126 resulted in a change in the aggregation kinetics, as almost 60% of PrP-(82-146)106-126scr was sedimentable after 24 h; subsequently, the aggregation proceeded slowly, except for an acceleration in the last 24 h leading to more than 85% of sedimentable peptide after 96 h of incubation. On the other hand, the alteration of the 127-146 region remarkably reduced the aggregation ability, as PrP-(82-146)127-146scr showed a limited rate of assembly into sedimentable structures that reached statistical significance (t< 0.01, Student's t test, n = 5) in comparison to the non-sedimentable PrP-(82-146)scr only after 96 h (Fig. 2). Protease Resistance of PrP Peptides Related to Their Aggregation Properties—Suspensions of pre-aggregated peptides were subjected to PK digestion at 37 °C for 30 min at 1:20 (w/w) enzyme-to-substrate ratio. Following centrifugation, the pellets were dissolved in formic acid and analyzed by HPLC. The extent of proteolysis was calculated as percentage of peptide present in the pellet compared with undigested controls. Under these conditions, 47.2 ± 3.0% of PrP-(82-146)wt was protease-resistant, whereas PrP-(82-146)scr was almost completely degraded (Fig. 3). The modification of the amino acid sequence 127-146 resulted in a decrease of the protease-resistant fraction to 15.4 ± 2.3% of control values. Conversely, the change of the 106-126 region yielded a striking increase in PK resistance (78.3 ± 8.2%). PrP-(82-146) Protofilament and Amyloid Fibril Formation Depends upon Integrity of C-terminal Region—The staining properties and ultrastructure of aggregates generated by PrP-(82-146) analogues were determined at various incubation times ranging from 1 to 168 h. At each time point, aliquots of peptide suspensions were stained with Congo Red and thioflavine S and examined by polarized light and fluorescence microscopy, respectively, or negatively stained with uranyl acetate and analyzed by EM. After 168 h, the samples were centrifuged, and the pellets were fixed in glutaraldehyde and embedded in Spurr. Ultrathin sections were positively stained and analyzed by EM. The analysis showed that PrP-(82-146)wt readily formed amyloid fibrils, whereas the entirely scrambled peptide, PrP-(82-146)scr, did not generate filamentous structures even after a 7-day incubation. Two distinct populations of long, straight, unbranched fibrils were observed in negatively stained PrP-(82-146)wt suspensions after 1 h: (i) 5.5-nm-diameter protofilaments with high propensity to adhere to each other, organizing into bundles of various widths (Fig. 4A); and (ii) 9.5-nm-diameter fibrils generating loose meshworks (Fig. 4B and Table I). The first population progressively decreased, whereas the second population progressively increased with time, and only 9.8-nm-diameter fibrils organized into dense meshworks were detectable after 72 h.Table IDiameter (nm) of fibrils generated by PrP-(82-146) analogues at different incubation times Results are the means ± S.D. of at least 100 measurements in three different experiments.TimePrP-(82-146)wtPrP-(82-146)106-126scrPrP-(82-146)127-146scrh15.5 ± 1.8No fibrilsNo fibrils9.5 ± 1.1245.6 ± 1.87.3 ± 1.07.1 ± 1.59.6 ± 1.2729.7 ± 1.17.6 ± 0.97.3 ± 1.11689.8 ± 1.17.7 ± 1.17.4 ± 1.0 Open table in a new tab The fibrillogenic ability of the peptide was affected by modification of the 106-126 region.

https://openalex.org/W2077772422,"Tpit (Tbx19) is a transcription factor belonging to the T-box family, and it is essential for late differentiation of pituitary pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing corticotroph and melanotroph cells. Tpit is also required, both in humans and mice, for cell-specific expression of the POMC gene in cooperation with the homeoprotein Pitx1. Despite their important roles as developmental regulators, the molecular mechanisms underpinning the functions of T-box factors in general, and of Tpit in particular, are still poorly defined. We now report that Tpit functions as an activator of transcription by recruiting SRC/p160 co-activators to its cognate DNA target in the POMC promoter, the Tpit/Pitx-RE. We also show that Tpit is a mediator of hormone signaling and that the Tpit/Pitx-RE is responsive to signals elicited by hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone. These signals are mediated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, and activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase also enhances Tpit and SRC-dependent transcription. We have previously shown that corticotropin-releasing hormone action is also exerted at the POMC promoter through the orphan nuclear receptor NGFI-B and its recruitment of SRC co-activators. Given that Tpit exhibits transcriptional synergy with NGFI-B, our results suggest that Tpit, along with NGFI-B and SRC-2, is part of a transcription regulatory complex assembled on the POMC promoter in response to hormonal stimulation.

Tpit (also known as Tbx19) is a member of the T-box family of transcription factors. These transcriptional regulators play critical roles in development, and the prototypical and founding member of the family is Brachyury or T (1Papaioannou V.E. Silver L.M.

Int. Rev. Cytol. 2001; 207: 1-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Within the family, Tpit is most similar to T and exhibits a highly restricted pattern of expression; indeed, it is solely expressed in a subset of pituitary lineages, the POMC-expressing corticotrophs and melanotrophs. Its expression starts at embryonic day 12.5 and is maintained throughout adulthood (4Lamolet B. Pulichino A.M. Lamonerie T. Gauthier Y. Brue T. Enjalbert A. Drouin J. Cell. 2001; 104: 849-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar).

Gain-of-function experiments showed that Tpit could induce uncommitted pituitary cells into POMC-expressing cells (4Lamolet B. Pulichino A.M. Lamonerie T. Gauthier Y. Brue T. Enjalbert A. Drouin J. Cell. 2001; 104: 849-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Gene inactivation studies revealed a failure of prospective corticotrophs and melanotrophs to reach terminal differentiation (as defined by POMC expression) but no effect on their precursors: thus, Tpit is required for late differentiation but not for lineage commitment (5Pulichino A.M. Vallette-Kasic S. Tsai J.P.Y. Couture C. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Tpit is also a negative regulator of gonadotroph differentiation, as inactivation of the Tpit gene switches cells to the gonadotroph fate (5Pulichino A.M. Vallette-Kasic S. Tsai J.P.Y. Couture C. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). As predicted by the exquisite association between Tpit and POMC-expressing cells, mutations of the TPIT gene are associated at high frequency (73%) with early onset isolated adrencorticotropin deficiency in humans (6Pulichino A.M. Vallette-Kasic S. Couture C. Gauthier Y. Brue T. David M. Malpuech G. Deal C. Van Vliet G. De Vroede M. Riepe F.G. Partsch C.J. Sippell W.G. Berberoglu M. Atasay B. Drouin J.

Tpit is a 446-amino acid protein containing a sequence-specific DNA-binding domain, the T-box, which is highly homologous to Brachyury. Protein sequence analysis reveals 84% homology with Brachyury in the T-box compared with 58–64% with other T-boxes (4Lamolet B. Pulichino A.M. Lamonerie T. Gauthier Y. Brue T. Enjalbert A. Drouin J. Cell. 2001; 104: 849-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). T-box transcription factors can bind DNA either as dimers on a palindromic DNA element (7Muller C.W. Herrmann B.G. Nature. 1997; 389: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 8Kispert A. Herrmann B.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3211-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) or as monomers on T element half-sites (4Lamolet B. Pulichino A.M. Lamonerie T. Gauthier Y. Brue T. Enjalbert A. Drouin J. Cell. 2001; 104: 849-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 9Sinha S. Abraham S. Gronostajski R.M. Campbell C.E. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 258: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Tpit activates POMC gene transcription in cooperation with the homeoprotein Pitx1, and both transcription factors bind DNA as monomers at contiguous sites on the POMC promoter, within the Tpit/Pitx regulatory element (Tpit/Pitx-RE) (4Lamolet B. Pulichino A.M. Lamonerie T. Gauthier Y. Brue T. Enjalbert A. Drouin J. Cell. 2001; 104: 849-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Tpit DNA binding activity is important for transcriptional activation, as highlighted by the fact that mutation in the Tpit binding site greatly reduces POMC promoter activity (4Lamolet B. Pulichino A.M. Lamonerie T. Gauthier Y. Brue T. Enjalbert A. Drouin J. Cell. 2001; 104: 849-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Moreover, three TPIT mutations that abolish DNA binding have been identified in isolated adrenocorticotropin deficiency patients and no longer activate POMC transcription (6Pulichino A.M. Vallette-Kasic S. Couture C. Gauthier Y. Brue T. David M. Malpuech G. Deal C. Van Vliet G. De Vroede M. Riepe F.G. Partsch C.J. Sippell W.G. Berberoglu M. Atasay B. Drouin J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Tpit was also involved in transcriptional repression, which likely accounts for its role as a negative regulator of gonadotroph differentiation. Tpit and the nuclear receptor SF-1 mutually antagonize each other's transcriptional activity by a mechanism of trans-repression that does not require Tpit DNA binding activity (5Pulichino A.M. Vallette-Kasic S. Tsai J.P.Y. Couture C. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). POMC expression becomes hormonally regulated by the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis at around embryonic day 15 in mice (10Lugo D.I. Pintar J.E. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Proteolytic processing of POMC in anterior pituitary corticotrophs produces the hormone adrenocorticotropin that controls adrenal glucocorticoid synthesis, and these steroids exert a negative feedback on the upper levels of the axis (11Gagner J.-P. Drouin J. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 1985; 40: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). POMC gene expression is itself under the positive control of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). Extensive studies have characterized the early steps of corticotrophs response to CRH, which include activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway, MAPK activation and accumulation of intracellular Ca2+ (12Kuryshev Y.A. Childs G.V. Ritchie A.K. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2269-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 13Labrie F. Veilleux R. Lefevre G. Coy D.H. Sueiras-Diaz J. Schally A.V.

Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1638-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that nuclear receptors (NRs) of the NGFI-B subfamily (Nur factors) are important mediators of CRH action on POMC, and at least part of the CRH effects are mediated through their binding element in the promoter, the NurRE (16Philips A. Lesage S. Gingras R. Maira M.H. Gauthier Y. Hugo P. Drouin J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 5946-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 17Maira M.H. Martens C. Philips A. Drouin J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 7549-7557Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 18Maira M.H. Martens C. Batsche E. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 63-76Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Nur factors are also implicated at the other levels of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, in regulation of cell death and in a variety of developmental events (reviewed in Ref. 18Maira M.H. Martens C. Batsche E. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 63-76Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition, an ever-increasing body of work has demonstrated that the transcriptional activity of NGFI-B is closely regulated by phosphorylation events. In basal conditions, the N terminus and DNA-binding domain of NGFI-B are phosphorylated, with key DNA-binding domain serines such as Ser316 preventing DNA binding (19Davis I.J. Hazel T.G. Chen R.H. Blenis J. Lau L.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 20Fahrner T.J. Carroll S.L. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 6454-6459Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Depending on the system and stimulus, the phosphorylation status of NGFI-B is modified, resulting in differential regulation of its transcriptional activity. For example, in adrenal-derived Y1 cells adrenocorticotropin treatment leads to dephosphorylation of Ser316 and unmasking of DNA binding activity, with a concomitant hyperphosphorylation of its N terminus that results in increased transcriptional activity (21Davis I.J. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 3469-3483Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 22Li Y. Lau L.F. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4138-4146Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that CRH treatment of AtT-20 cells leads to dephosphorylation of Ser316, thus playing a permissive role for subsequent NGFI-B dimer binding and co-activator recruitment (18Maira M.H. Martens C. Batsche E. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 63-76Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We have also shown that SRC/p160 co-activators are important mediators of CRH action, because they are recruited to Nur dimers in response to CRH (18Maira M.H. Martens C. Batsche E. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 63-76Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The SRC/p160 family includes three homologous members, namely SRC-1, SRC-2 (also known as TIF2 or GRIP1), and SRC-3 (also known as p/CIP, RAC3, ACTR, AIB1, or TRAM-1) (23Leo C. Chen J.D. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 245: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 24McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). SRC/p160 co-activators were first cloned as transcriptional partners for NRs, but they were also shown to function with other transcriptional regulators, such as the bZIP factor c-Jun (25Teyssier C. Belguise K. Galtier F. Chalbos D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36361-36369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), the basic helix-loop-helix factor myogenin, and the MADS box factor MEF2c (26Chen S.L. Dowhan D.H. Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1209-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SRC/p160 co-activators enhance the activity of transcription factors in part because of their intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity and also by recruitment of other transcriptional regulators. These include an array of chromatin remodelers such as CBP/p300 and p/CAF, the histone methyltransferase CARM-1, and BAF 57, a subunit of the SWI/SNF complex. In addition, SRCs interact with proteins of the general transcriptional machinery such as TFIIB and TBP (for review see Refs. 23Leo C. Chen J.D. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 245: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar and 24McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). SRC-2 has also been shown to function as a co-repressor for the glucocorticoid receptor GR (27Rogatsky I. Zarember K.A. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6071-6083Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and different domains of SRC-2 are implicated in co-activator versus co-repressor activities (28Rogatsky I. Luecke H.F. Leitman D.C. Yamamoto K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16701-16706Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We now report that Tpit recruits SRC co-activators, resulting in enhancement of Tpit-dependent transcription. PKA activation also modulates Tpit activity, seemingly by modulating SRC recruitment. We also show that the Tpit/Pitx-RE of the POMC promoter is responsive to signals elicited by CRH and mediated by PKA and MAPK pathways. Tpit also exhibits transcriptional synergism with NGFI-B, thus suggesting that Tpit is part of a transcription regulatory complex assembled on the POMC promoter in response to hormonal stimulation.

Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—293 cells (10-cm plates) were transfected with 24 μg of total DNA, and nuclear extracts were prepared 48 h later. We used 250 μg of nuclear extract in 100 μl of buffer B (18Maira M.H. Martens C. Batsche E. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 63-76Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar) by assay. The total volume was brought to 1 ml by adding 167 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) and 733 μl of binding buffer with 150 mm NaCl. Co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed using anti-FLAG affinity gel with the monoclonal antibody covalently attached to agarose beads (Sigma A2220). 40 μl of affinity gel (washed twice with 0.5 ml of Tris-buffered saline) was added and immunoprecipitation was performed at 4 °C for 4 h on a roller shaker. Immunoprecipitates were washed thrice in 1 ml of Tris-buffered saline for 5 min and eluted in Laemmli buffer without dithiothreitol. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. SRCs as Co-activators of Tpit—The T-box transcription factor Tpit was cloned as a cell-specific activator of the pituitary POMC gene in cooperation with the homeoprotein Pitx1 (4Lamolet B. Pulichino A.M. Lamonerie T. Gauthier Y. Brue T. Enjalbert A. Drouin J. Cell. 2001; 104: 849-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). To assess transcriptional partners of Tpit, we tested for recruitment of transcriptional co-activators previously implicated in POMC transcription, the SRC/p160 family (18Maira M.H. Martens C. Batsche E. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 63-76Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). 2E. Batsche, J. Desroches, S. Bilodeau, Y. Gauthier, and J. Drouin, submitted for publication. To investigate the ability of SRCs to modulate Tpit transcriptional activity, we performed transient co-transfections in CV-1 cells. As reported previously (4Lamolet B. Pulichino A.M. Lamonerie T. Gauthier Y. Brue T. Enjalbert A. Drouin J. Cell. 2001; 104: 849-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), transfection of either Tpit or Pitx1 alone had little effect on a luciferase reporter plasmid driven by a Tpit/Pitx target sequence, but together they exhibited transcriptional synergism (Fig. 1A). Co-transfection of an SRC-2 expression plasmid did not enhance Pitx1-dependent transcription, but in contrast enhanced both the transcriptional activity of Tpit alone as well as the synergistic activities of Tpit and Pitx1. These results suggested that SRC-2 specifically enhances activity through interaction with Tpit. To test the respective abilities of Tpit and Pitx1 to physically recruit SRC-2, we performed in vitro pull-down assays using MBP fusion proteins for either Tpit, Pitx1, or β-Gal chimeras and 35S-labeled SRC-2 proteins. Only MBP-Tpit effectively retained SRC-2 protein (Fig. 1B), which correlates with the transcriptional specificity observed with Tpit and Pitx1 (Fig. 1A). We also tested the ability of the other members of the p160 family to enhance Tpit-dependent activity. All three SRCs similarly enhanced Tpit transcriptional activity on a Tpit/Pitx target sequence (Fig. 1C). This enhancement cannot be attributed to effects on Tpit expression as indicated by Western blot analysis of Tpit (Fig. 1C, inset). To define the domains of SRC-2 required for Tpit co-activation, we used a series of SRC-2 mutants known to disrupt different interactions with NRs. These included the SRC-2m123 mutant that contains mutations in all three LXXLL motifs essentials for stimulation of NR AF-2-dependent activity, a deletion mutant lacking the glutamine-rich domain necessary for co-activation of the NR AF-1-dependent activity (SRC-2ΔQ), as well as a double mutant SRC-2m123ΔQ. In co-transfection experiments, the SRC-2m123 mutant was as efficient as wild-type SRC-2, whereas the mutant SRC-2ΔQ abrogated SRC-2-mediated co-activation of Tpit transcriptional activity (Fig. 1D), as did the double mutant SRC-2m123ΔQ. The SRC-2 ΔQ mutant was previously shown to be appropriately expressed and to retain NR AF-2-dependent activity (31Benecke A. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To determine whether this was a consequence of impaired interaction with Tpit, we performed pull-down assays using wild-type and mutant in vitro translated SRC-2. The MBP-Tpit column bound only wild-type and SRC-2m123 mutant, whereas mutants SRC-2ΔQ and SRC-2m123ΔQ were not retained (Fig. 1E). Taken together, these results identify SRC-2 as a co-activator of Tpit and clearly implicate the glutamine-rich domain of SRC-2 in Tpit interaction and co-activation. Tpit as a Target for Signaling Pathways—We have recently demonstrated that SRC-2 is recruited to the POMC promoter in response to cAMP/PKA signaling elicited by CRH, a pathway that targets the nuclear receptor NGFI-B in corticotroph cells (18Maira M.H. Martens C. Batsche E. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 63-76Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar).2 Given our observation that SRC-2 is also a co-activator of Tpit, we tested whether Tpit would also be a target for PKA signaling pathway. To test whether PKA would modulate Tpit transcriptional activity, a Tpit/Pitx-reporter plasmid was co-transfected in CV-1 cells with expression plasmids for Tpit and/or the catalytic subunit of PKA. Although the transcriptional response to Tpit is modest, co-expression of PKA greatly enhanced Tpit activity (Fig. 2A). PKA also enhanced the transcriptional activity of Brachyury, but not of Tbx1, another T-box transcription factor present in POMC-expressing AtT-20 cells (4Lamolet B. Pulichino A.M. Lamonerie T. Gauthier Y. Brue T. Enjalbert A. Drouin J. Cell. 2001; 104: 849-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). We next tested whether the Tpit/Pitx-RE conferred responsiveness to activation by the CRH/cAMP/PKA pathway in AtT-20 cells. CRH treatment of AtT-20 cells resulted in activation of the transfected Tpit/Pitx-RE driven reporter plasmid, whereas CRH treatment had no effect on the minimal POMC promoter (Fig. 2, B and C). To confirm that the Tpit- and/or Pitx-binding sites were necessary, we scanned the entire Tpit/Pitx element with a set of 3-bp mutants and assessed them for CRH responsiveness. As expected, mutants M5 and M6, which destroy the Tpit half-site, were minimally active and were not enhanced upon CRH treatment (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, mutants M8 and M9, which destroy the Pitx-binding site, were also nonresponsive to CRH, confirming the interdependence of Tpit and Pitx activity in POMC-expressing cells (4Lamolet B. Pulichino A.M. Lamonerie T. Gauthier Y. Brue T. Enjalbert A. Drouin J. Cell. 2001; 104: 849-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). To confirm that an AP-1 site present in the minimal POMC promoter, which had been implicated in CRH responsiveness (35Boutillier A.L. Monnier D. Lorang D. Lundblad J.R. Roberts J.L. Loeffler J.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 745-755PubMed Google Scholar), is not implicated in Tpit/Pitx-dependent CRH response, we used a reporter lacking this sequence, and this construct responded equally well to CRH treatment (Fig. 2C, construct 3). It is noteworthy that the AP-1 site in the minimal promoter reporter confers a slight but reproducible CRH response (compare constructs 2 and 4). Finally, to determine whether the Tpit/Pitx target sequence is essential for CRH responsiveness of the POMC promoter, we used reporte"

We examined oligodeoxyribonucleotide duplexes bearing a site-specific cross-link of the transplatin analogue containing the piperidine ligand by biochemical methods. The results indicate that in contrast to transplatin, trans-(PtCl2(NH3)(piperidine)) forms stable 1,3-intrastrand cross-links in double-helical DNA that distort DNA and are not readily removed from DNA by nucleotide excision repair system. Hence, the intrastrand cross-links of trans-(PtCl2(NH3)(piperidine)) could persist for a sufficiently long time, potentiating its toxicity toward tumor cells. trans-(PtCl2(NH3)(piperidine)) also forms in DNA minor interstrand cross-links that are similar to those of transplatin so that these adducts appear less likely candidates for genotoxic lesion responsible for antitumor effects of trans-(PtCl2(NH3)(piperidine)).

The paradigm for structure-pharmacological activity relationship of platinum complexes is that the trans isomer of cisplatin (transplatin) (Fig. 1A) is clinically ineffective. To this end, however, several new complexes of the trans structure have been identified that exhibit an enhanced cytotoxicity in tumor cell lines, such that cytotoxicity is equivalent or even better than that of the analogous cis isomers and, indeed, cisplatin itself (for reviews, see Refs. 4Farrell N. Sigel A. Sigel H. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. Vol. 32. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1996: 603-639Google Scholar, 5Perez J.-M. Fuertes M.A. Alonso C. Navarro-Ranninger C. Crit. Rev. Oncol.

Examples of such new antitumor transplatinum compounds are (i) analogues containing planar amine ligand of general structure trans-(PtCl2(NH3)(L)), where L represents planar amine such as quinoline or thiazole; (ii) analogues containing iminoether groups of the general formula trans-(PtCl2(E-iminoether)2) (trans-EE); and (iii) analogues with asymmetric aliphatic ligands and trans-(PtCl2(NH3)(L)), where L represents cyclohexylamine. We have recently reported (7Khazanov E. Barenholz Y. Gibson D. Najajreh Y. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 5196-5204Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 8Najajreh Y. Perez J.M. Navarro-Ranninger C.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6321-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) that the replacement of one ammine ligand by the heterocyclic ligand, such as piperidine (pip) (Fig. 1A), piperazine, or 4-picoline in the molecule of transplatin results in a radical enhancement of its activity in tumor cell lines both sensitive and resistant to cisplatin. For instance, the IC50 (the concentration of the compound that afforded 50% cell killing) of trans-(PtCl2(NH3)(pip)) in the A2780 cell line was more than 40 times lower than that of transplatin. Since DNA is considered the major pharmacological target of antitumor platinum drugs (10Johnson N.P. Butour J.-L. Villani G. Wimmer F.L. Defais M. Pierson V. Brabec V. Prog. Clin. Biochem. Med. 1989; 10: 1-24Crossref Google Scholar), it appears important that due to this replacement, the analogues of transplatin alter the properties of DNA in a markedly different way than the parent compound. This is an intriguing finding, because the same replacement in the molecule of antitumor cisplatin (Fig. 1A) results in a reduced activity of the drug in both sensitive and resistant cell lines (for instance, the IC50 measured in A2780 cell line was ∼12 times higher than that of cisplatin (9Kasparkova J. Marini V. Najajreh Y. Gibson D. Brabec V. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6321-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar)). Thus, the latter observation represents an additional example of activation of trans geometry in bifunctional mononuclear platinum(II) compounds, although the reasons for this activation have not been completely clarified. Preliminary mechanistic studies using the analogues of transplatin containing piperidine, piperazine, or 4-picoline nonleaving ligand (9Kasparkova J. Marini V. Najajreh Y. Gibson D. Brabec V. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6321-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) suggest that one strategy how to activate trans geometry in antitumor bifunctional platinum(II) compounds may consist in a chemical modification of the ineffective transplatin, resulting in an increased stability of its intrastrand cross-links (CLs) in double-helical DNA and/or in an increased efficiency to form interstrand CLs. Hence, the latter suggestion is consistent with the concept of designing new platinum drugs (acting by a new mechanism and with activity complementary to drugs such as cisplatin) based on the observation that the replacement of the ammine ligand in transplatin can modulate their DNA binding mode and consequently their activity in cancer cell lines (11Farrell N. Kelland L.R. Roberts J.D. Van Beusichem M. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5065-5072PubMed Google Scholar). Initial data on calf thymus and plasmid DNA globally modified in cell-free media by analogues of transplatin in which one ammine ligand was replaced by piperidine, piperazine, or 4-picoline have been reported in our previous work (9Kasparkova J. Marini V. Najajreh Y. Gibson D. Brabec V. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6321-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The results have demonstrated that these analogues form on DNA mainly intrastrand and interstrand CLs (for instance trans-(PtCl2(NH3)(pip)) forms ∼26% interstrand and ∼59% intrastrand CLs if DNA is incubated with this compound for 48 h). These results are of fundamental importance, because the clinical ineffectivity of transplatin has been proposed to be associated with a low stability of its intrastrand CLs in double-helical DNA and in general with its reduced capability to form in double-helical DNA bifunctional adducts (12Boudvillain M. Dalbies R. Aussourd C. Leng M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2381-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 13Leng M. Schwartz A. Giraud-Panis M.J. Kelland L.R. Farrell N.P. Platinum-based Drugs in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press Inc, Totowa, NJ2000: 63-85Google Scholar). Because structural details of individual DNA adducts formed by these analogues of transplatin are not yet available, it remains uncertain how these CLs affect conformation of DNA and how these alterations are further processed in the cells. Therefore, in order to shed light on the mechanism that underlies activity of transplatin analogues containing a heterocyclic ligand we examine in the present work in detail short oligodeoxyribonucleotide duplexes containing single, site-specific intrastrand or interstrand CL of the transplatin analogue containing the nonplanar piperidine ligand (Fig. 1A). The piperidine analogue of transplatin was chosen as the representative of this class of new platinum compounds. This choice was made because the changes in the activity in cancer cell lines and some features of its DNA binding mode in a cell-free medium due to the replacement of one ammine ligand by the heterocyclic group in the parent compound were most pronounced (9Kasparkova J. Marini V. Najajreh Y. Gibson D. Brabec V. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6321-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We investigated how the CLs affect the local conformation of DNA (in particular, bending and unwinding) and how these adducts are stable in double-helical DNA and further processed by some cellular components in cell-free media. Antitumor activity of platinum compounds is also affected by the factors that do not operate directly at the level of DNA adducts. Among these factors are also those that affect the amount of platinum complex that can reach target DNA in cancer cells by changing the cell accumulation of the complexes. Therefore, we also compared the cellular uptake of transplatin and its analogue containing the piperidine ligand and determined the amount of platinum bound to DNA in the cells treated with these platinum compounds. Chemicals—trans-(PtCl2(NH3)(pip)), where pip represents piperidine (Fig. 1A), was prepared by the methods described in detail previously (8Najajreh Y. Perez J.M. Navarro-Ranninger C. Gibson D. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 5189-5195Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Cisplatin and transplatin (Fig. 1A) were obtained from Sigma. The stock solutions of platinum compounds were prepared at the concentration of 5 × 10–4m in 10 mm NaClO4 and stored at 4 °C in the dark. The synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides (Fig. 1B) were synthesized and purified as described previously (14Brabec V. Reedijk J. Leng M.

Hydroxyl Radical Footprinting of Interstrand CLs—Platinated (or unplatinated) oligodeoxyribonucleotide duplexes (their concentration was 6 nm) that had either the top or bottom strand 32P-labeled at the 5′-end were dissolved in the medium of 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The cleavage of the phosphodiesteric bonds was performed by incubating the duplexes in 0.04 mm Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2, 0.08 mm EDTA, 0.03% H2O2, and 2 mm sodium ascorbate for 5 min at 20 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 15 mm thiourea, 3 mm EDTA, 0.3 m sodium acetate, and 0.3 mg tRNA/ml. After precipitation, the samples were loaded onto a 24% denaturing polyacrylamide (PAA)/8 m urea gel. Maxam-Gilbert sequencing reactions were run in parallel. Inhibition of DNA Polymerization—The 23- or 30-mer templates (see Fig. 4) containing a single 1,3-GTG intrastrand CL of trans-(PtCl2(NH3)(pip)) or 1,2-GG intrastrand CL of cisplatin were prepared in the same way as described (9Kasparkova J.

The DNA substrates were formed by annealing templates and 5′-end-labeled primers at a molar ratio of 3:1. All experiments using KF– and RT HIV-1 were performed at 25 °C in a volume of 50 μl in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Nonidet P-30, 25 μm dATP, 25 μm dCTP, 25 μm dGTP, and 25 μm TTP and 0.5 unit of KF–. The experiments with RT HIV-1 were performed at 37 °C using the same conditions, except that the nucleoside triphosphates were at a concentration of 100 μm and 1.0 unit of RT HIV-1 was used. Reactions were terminated by the addition of EDTA, so that its resulting concentration was 20 mm, and heating at 100 °C for 30 s. Products were resolved by denaturing 24% PAA/8 m urea gel and then visualized and quantified by using the FUJIFILM bioimaging analyzer and AIDA image analyzer software. Gel Mobility Shift Assay—Reactions with RPA and XPA. 32P-Labeled DNA substrates (0.5 nm) and the amounts of RPA or XPA indicated were incubated at 20 °C in reactions of 20 μl containing 25 mm HEPESKOH (pH 8.3), 30 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.9 mm dithiothreitol, 45 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10% glycerol. The reaction with XPA was still supplemented by unlabeled and unplatinated competitor duplex (20-bp, 70 nm). To assess binding at equilibrium, reactions were stopped after 30 min by cooling the samples to 0 °C. Following the addition of gel loading buffer (4 μl) containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 10% glycerol, and 0.05% Orange G, the extent of binding was determined on 6% native PAA gel. The electrophoresis was performed for 50 min at 4 °C, gels were dried and visualized by using the FUJIFILM bio-imaging analyzer, and the radioactivities associated with bands were quantitated with the AIDA image analyzer software.

In vitro repair was measured with excision assay using these CFEs and 148-bp linear DNA substrates (see above) in the same way as described previously (26Reardon J.T. Vaisman A. Chaney S.G. Sancar A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3968-3971PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular Platinum Complex Uptake—Platinum complexes of novel structure may have an altered pharmacology associated with drug uptake that may affect their cytotoxicity. Therefore, we examined first how the replacement of the ammine group in transplatin by piperidine ligand affects its accumulation in tumor cell lines. Results in CH1cisR cells (this cancer cell line was among those used for testing activity of the novel transplatin analogues in which trans-(PtCl2(NH3)(pip)) exhibited a markedly enhanced activity in comparison with transplatin (9Kasparkova J. Marini V. Najajreh Y. Gibson D. Brabec V. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6321-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar)) show that the replacement of the ammine group by the piperidine ligand considerably reduces the amount of platinum associated with the cells (Fig. 2A). Given that significantly less trans-(PtCl2(NH3)(pip)) appears to be accumulated in cells, the question arises as to how the piperidine ligand affects the binding of transplatin analogues to DNA in cells. Results in Fig. 2B demonstrate that trans-(PtCl2(NH3)(pip)) binds to DNA in CH1cisR cells treated with this transplatin analogue more slowly and to a lesser extent than the parent complex. This is in contrast to the data showing that transplatin and trans-(PtCl2(NH3)(pip)) bind to DNA in a cell-free medium with approximately the same rate (9Kasparkova J. Marini V. Najajreh Y. Gibson D. Brabec V. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6321-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Hence, it is reasonable to suggest that the slower binding rate and the lesser binding level of trans-(PtCl2(NH3)(pip)) to DNA in culture cells is mainly a consequence of its lower intracellular concentration. Fig. 2 shows that the markedly enhanced cytotoxicity of trans-(PtCl2(NH3)(pip)) in comparison with transplatin (9Kasparkova J. Marini V. Najajreh Y. Gibson D. Brabec V. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6321-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) is not due to either enhanced cellular accumulation or higher levels of DNA platination in the cells. Since the cytotoxicity cannot be correlated with the levels of DNA modification, it is intuitively appealing to suggest that the enhanced cytotoxicity may be related to the nature of the adducts that are formed with the DNA and to the effects of the altered DNA properties on downstream cellular events. Intrastrand Cross-links—Unlike cisplatin, due to steric reasons, transplatin and its analogues cannot form intrastrand CLs in double-helical DNA between adjacent base residues. The trans compounds can cross-link two bases on the same strand only if they are separated by at least one intervening base, forming mostly 1,3-GNG intrastrand CLs (where N represents adenine, cytosine, or thymine). These adducts formed by the antitumor analogues of transplatin, in which the ammine group was replaced by the heterocyclic ligand, are stable in double-helical DNA and represent major DNA adducts of this class of antitumor trans compounds. It was, therefore, of great interest to examine how single, site-specific 1,3-GTG intrastrand CL of trans-(PtCl2(NH3)(pip)) affects conformation of double-helical DNA and what are some subsequent “downstream” effects of this type of DNA damage, such as recognition by some damaged DNA-binding proteins and repair capacity for this lesion of eukaryotic nucleotide excision repair (NER) system. Important structural motifs induced in DNA by antitumor platinum compounds that play a significant role in the mechanism underlying their antitumor activity are the bending and unwinding of the helix axis (27Jamieson E.R. Lippard S.J. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 2467-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (2620) Google Scholar). For DNA intrastrand adducts of cisplatin and transplatin, the structural details responsible for bending and unwinding have been elucidated (28Anin M.F. Leng M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4395-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 29Bellon S.F. Lippard S.J. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 35: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In this work we further performed studies on the bending and unwinding induced by single, site-specific intrastrand CL of trans-(PtCl2(NH3)(pip)) using electrophoretic retardation as a quantitative measure of the extent of planar curvature. The oligodeoxyribonucleotide duplexes TGTGT(19–22) (19–22 bp long, whose sequences were identical or similar to that of the duplex TGTGT (21Kasparkova J. Zehnulova J. Farrell N. Brabec V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48076-48086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) shown in Fig. 1B; the 19- and 20-bp duplexes had one or two marginal C·G pairs deleted, respectively, whereas one additional T·A pair was added to one end in the 22-bp duplex) were used for the bending and unwinding studies of the present work. The ligation products of these unplatinated or CL containing duplexes were analyzed on native PAA electrophoresis gel. Experimental details of these studies are given in our recent reports (20Kasparkova J. Mellish K.J. Qu Y. Brabec V. Farrell N.

The DNA bending toward the minor groove and unwinding due to one 1,3-intrastrand adduct of trans-(PtCl2(NH3)(pip)) has been found 30 ± 2 and 8 ± 2°, respectively (the direction of the bend was determined using the duplex (TGTGT+(A/T)5)(32) (Fig. 1B) in the same way as in our recent papers (21Kasparkova J.

Moreover, the ligation of the 21- and 22-bp duplexes containing 1,3-intrastrand CL of trans-(PtCl2(NH3)(pip)) resulted in the formation of circles, suggesting that the 1,3-intrastrand CLs of this transplatin analogue increased the flexibility of the double helix (29Bellon S.F. Lippard S.J. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 35: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 34Brabec V. Sip M. Leng M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11676-11681Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Further studies of the present work were focused on analysis of the distortion induced by the 1,3-intrastrand CL of trans-(PtCl2(NH3)(pip)) by chemical probes of DNA conformation. The duplex TGTGT (Fig. 1B) containing a single, site-specific adduct was treated with several chemical agents that are used as tools for monitoring the existence of conformations other than canonical B-DNA. These agents included KMnO4, diethyl pyrocarbonate, and bromine. They react preferentially with single-stranded DNA and distorted double-stranded DNA (34Brabec V. Sip M. Leng M.

We used for this analysis exactly the same methodology described in detail in our recent papers dealing with DNA adducts of various antitumor platinum drugs (21Kasparkova J. Zehnulova J. Farrell N.

Therefore, these experiments are only described in more detail in the Supporting material (see “Chemical Probes” and Fig. S2). The results schematically summarized in Fig. 3A indicate that 1,3-intrastrand CL of trans-(PtCl2(NH3)(pip)) induces in DNA the distortion that extends over at least 6 bp and is localized mainly at the base pair between the platinated G residues and the base pairs on its 5′ side. It has been demonstrated that various DNA secondary structures have significant effects on processivity of a number of prokaryotic, eukaryotic, and viral DNA polymerases (38Comess K.M. Burstyn J.N.

https://openalex.org/W2079950503,"Intersectin (ITSN) is a molecular scaffold involved in regulating endocytosis and mitogenic signaling. We previously demonstrated that ITSN transformed rodent fibroblasts, accelerated hormone-induced maturation of Xenopus oocytes, and activated the Elk-1 transcription factor through an MEK- and Erk-independent mechanism. We now demonstrate that ITSN complexes with the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos1 leading to increased RasGTP levels. Using fluorescence resonant energy transfer analysis, we demonstrate that ITSN complexes with Ras in living cells leading to Ras activation on intracellular vesicles. These vesicles contain epidermal growth factor receptor but are distinct from transferrin-positive vesicles. However, Ras is not required for ITSN stimulation of transcription. Rather, we demonstrate that ITSN signals through JNK to activate Elk-1. Although ITSN activation of Elk-1 was Ras-independent, ITSN cooperates with Ras to synergistically activate JNK. These findings indicate that ITSN activates multiple intracellular signaling pathways and suggest that this adaptor protein may coordinately regulate the activity of these pathways in vivo.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27414-27420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, ITSN cooperated with progesterone to accelerate maturation of Xenopus oocytes in vitro, induced morphological transformation of rodent fibroblasts, and stimulated Elk-1-dependent transcriptional events (9Adams A. Thorn J.M. Yamabhai M. Kay B.K. O'Bryan J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27414-27420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Preliminary characterization of the pathway(s) involved in Elk-1 activation by ITSN revealed that this activity was independent of MEK1/2 and Erk MAPK (9Adams A. Thorn J.M. Yamabhai M. Kay B.K. O'Bryan J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27414-27420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This result was surprising given the proposed involvement of ITSN in activation of Ras, a potent activator of the Raf-MEK-Erk pathway (10Tong X.K. Hussain N.K. de Heuvel E. Kurakin A. Abi-Jaoude E. Quinn C.C. Olson M.F. Baranes D. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1263-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 11Tong X.K. Hussain N.K. Adams A.G. O'Bryan J.P. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29894-29899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, a recent study demonstrated that Ras activates distinct signaling pathways at different endomembrane compartments (12Chiu V.K. Bivona T. Hach A. Sajous J.B. Silletti J. Wiener H. Johnson II, R.L. Cox A.D. Philips M.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Thus, we were interested in determining the contribution of Ras to ITSN signaling. The results presented herein demonstrate for the first time that ITSN stimulates RasGTP levels and forms a complex with Ras in vivo on a previously uncharacterized vesicular compartment. However, ITSN stimulation of Elk-1 does not require Ras function. In addition, ITSN signaling does not require the kinase activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor although EGFR and ITSN cooperate to synergistically activate Elk-1 and are co-localized on vesicles. Rather, ITSN stimulates Elk-1 through a JNK-dependent pathway. Inhibition of JNK attenuates Elk-1 activation by ITSN. Conversely, ITSN overexpression activates JNK. These data further define the biochemical pathways through which ITSN functions and support the model that ITSN is a pivotal component in integrating numerous cellular processes, including activation of GTPase cascades, endocytosis, and mitogenesis. Cells and Reagents—293T and NIH/3T3 cells were maintained as previously described (13O'Bryan J.P. Lambert Q.T. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20431-20437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Growth factors were purchased from the following: recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor BB, recombinant human hepatocyte growth factor, and recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor were from R & D Systems, Inc.; human recombinant epidermal growth factor was from Upstate Biotechnology; and bovine insulin was from Invitrogen. SB203580 and SP600125 (also known as Jnk inhibitor II) were purchased from Calbiochem. For each 10 μm of JNK inhibitor added to the media, 0.1% Me2SO was also added (e.g. 20 μm SP600125/0.2% Me2SO). All the inhibitors were resuspended in Me2SO as carrier. PY20 antibody was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. FLAG monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma. Phosphospecific JNK antibody was purchased from New England Biolabs. Monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin antibody was purchased from Covance. Polyclonal GST antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal antibodies to Sos-1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Upstate Biotechnology. Constructs—The Xenopus laevis intersectin full-length, EH, coiled-coil, and SH3 expression constructs in pCGN-Hyg were previously described (9Adams A. Thorn J.M. Yamabhai M. Kay B.K. O'Bryan J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27414-27420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse intersectin was isolated by PCR from reverse-transcribed total RNA from NIH/3T3 cells using the primers 5′mInt (5′-GGATCCATGGCTCAGTTTCCCACACCT) and 3′mInt (5′-GGATCCGGATGGACAACATATGATTCA). Products were subcloned into pCRII (Invitrogen) and subjected to DNA sequence analysis to confirm wild type sequence. The full-length cDNA was digested with BamHI to release the fragment from pCRII and subcloned into pCGN-Hyg as a BamHI fragment. All clones possess an amino-terminal hemagglutinin epitope tag. YFP-tagged mouse ITSN was created by subcloning the BamHI fragment from pCGN-ITSN (mouse) into pEYFP (Clontech) digested with BglII. The pGEX expression constructs were previously described (1Yamabhai M. Hoffman N.G. Hardison N.L. McPherson P.S. Castagnoli L. Cesareni G. Kay B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31401-31407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) with the exception of SH3B, which was constructed using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) to amplify the SH3B from pCGN ITSN SH3 with the primers 5′-CGC GGA TCC GTA GAA GGC CTT and 5′-TTC CTT TTT TCG CCG GCG TTA ACC GGA TAT AAG. The fragment was subcloned into pCRII T/A vector (Invitrogen), sequenced, then digested with BamHI/NotI (New England Biolabs) and subcloned into pGEX 4T-2. The Ras dominant-negative expression constructs were generated by subcloning a BamHI fragment from pCMV FLAG-based constructs (kindly provided by Dr. Lawrence Quilliam) into pEF6 V5/His digested with BamHI (Invitrogen). The JNK dominant-negative construct (Jnk(APF)) was kindly provided by Dr. Roger Davis. Reporter Assays—293T cells were transfected with the GAL4-Elk-1 and 5xGAL4-luciferase reporter plasmids as previously described along with the indicated expression constructs, and reporter activation was measured as previously described (13O'Bryan J.P. Lambert Q.T. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20431-20437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Following serum starvation overnight, cells were either left unstimulated or stimulated for 4–6 h with growth factor. Cells were washed with warm PBS then harvested in 1× luciferase lysis buffer (Analytical Luminescence). Luciferase activity was then measured in a Dynex 96-well microtiter plate luminometer, and the relative light units (RLUs) per microgram of protein were determined. For each experiment, relative activation was normalized to the vector control determined by dividing the RLU/μg for each experimental point by the RLU/μg for unstimulated vector-transfected samples. Ras Activation Assays—Determination of the RasGTP levels was performed essentially as described previously (14Taylor S.J. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, a GST fusion protein of the Ras binding domain of Raf, GST-Raf-RBD, was used to selectively purify RasGTP from cell lysates prepared as follows: 3–5 × 106 293T cells per 100-mm dish were transfected with 0.5 μg of pCGN-H-Ras wild type along with the various ITSN expression plasmids using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. After allowing precipitates to incubate on cells for several hours, the media were replaced with fresh media. Following an additional incubation, the cells were transferred to serum-free media overnight. On the following day, cells were incubated in the absence or presence of EGF (100 ng/ml) for 5 min, washed once with PBS, and then lysed in 500 μl of GTPase lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 25 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm vanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 10–15 min with gentle mixing and then clarified by centrifugation for 10 min. Equivalent amounts of GST-Raf-RBD bound to GSH beads were then added to 250 μl of each lysate and incubated at 4 °C for 30–60 min with gentle mixing. Beads were then spun down and washed 4× with GTPase lysis buffer, resuspended in 50 μl of 4× NuPAGE sample buffer supplemented with 5% β-mercaptoethanol and then heated to 70 °C for 10 min. Ten microliters of each sample was then fractionated on a 4–12% NuPAGE gel along with equivalent amounts of lysate from each sample as a control for total Ras levels. Gels were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes and then analyzed by Western blot with anti-HA antibodies. To determine the level of Ras activation, the signal for Ras bound to the GST-Raf-RBD beads was divided by the signal for total Ras in each sample and then normalized to the vector control, unstimulated sample. FRET Analysis—COS-1 cells were co-transfected with YFP-tagged mouse ITSN and either CFP-H-Ras or Raf1RBD-CFP and untagged H-Ras. Transfected cells were imaged alive the next day with a Zeiss 510 laser scanning confocal microscope. The distributions of YFP-ITSN and CFP-H-Ras or Raf1RBD-CFP were imaged with conventional CFP and YFP settings. FRET was analyzed as sensitized acceptor emission by excitation at 458 nm with an argon laser and detection of emissions, limited by a 560-nm bandpass filter. Acquired images were processed with Adobe Photoshop 6.0 to enhance contrast. FRET was quantified by reversal of donor quenching after acceptor photobleaching at 514 nm (15Kenworthy A.K. Methods. 2001; 24: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). From each cell two to three individual vesicles (for a total of 25 vesicles) that co-expressed ITSN and H-Ras were selected, and CFP fluorescence intensity (Icfp) was measured prior to and following acceptor photobleaching at 514 nm. FRET efficiency was calculated as follows: (Icfppostbleach - Icfpprebleach)/Icfppostbleach. EGF and Transferrin Internalization Assays—Cells to be examined by fluorescence microscopy were plated at 2 × 105 per plate into 35-mm dishes containing a glass coverslip-covered 15-mm cutout (MatTek) and transfected with YFP-ITSN the next day. Fluorescent loading of endosomes was accomplished by incubating cells with 5 μg/ml Texas Redconjugated transferrin (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C followed by removal of the unincorporated probe. Fluorescent labeling of activated EGFRs was accomplished by incubating cells with 40 ng/ml Texas Red-conjugated EGF (Molecular Probes) for 20 min at 37 °C. Dual-color digital laser scanning confocal microscope was used to continuously monitor ligand internalization by individual cells. JNK Assays—HEK 293T cells were transiently co-transfected with the indicated expression constructs and a FLAG-epitope-tagged JNK expression construct. Following an overnight incubation in serum-free media, cell lysates were harvested and Western blots were performed to assess the expression of FLAG-JNK. Lysates were normalized so that equal amounts of FLAG-JNK were immunoprecipitated with a FLAG monoclonal antibody. Precipitates were washed three times with ice-cold PLC-LB (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaF) supplemented with 1 mm vanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin then resuspended in 25 μl of 4× NuPAGE sample buffer supplemented with 5% β-mercaptoethanol. After heating to 70 °C for 10 min, equivalent amounts of samples were fractionated on duplicate 4–12% NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen), transferred to Immobilon-P membranes, and probed with antibodies to the FLAG epitope to determine total levels of JNK or antibodies to activated, dually phosphorylated JNK (New England Biolabs). GST Pull-down Assays—Bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins were prepared essentially as described (16O'Bryan J.P. Songyang Z. Cantley L. Der C. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2729-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) except that bacterial pellets were lysed in PLC-LB. Ten micrograms of the individual GST-SH3 domains bound to Sepharose beads was combined with 250 μg of lysate from cells stimulated with EGF for varying lengths of time and then incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with gentle mixing. The beads were then pelleted at 20,800 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, washed five times with 500 μl of PLC-LB with inhibitors, resuspended in 25 μlof4× NuPAGE loading buffer (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% β-mercaptoethanol, boiled at 100 °C for 5 min, fractionated on NuPAGE gels, and then transferred to Immobilon-P filters. The filters were then blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk, 1× Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma), pH 7.4 (TBS-T), overnight at 4 °C. The top half of the filters was then probed with antibodies to Sos1 (2 μg/ml) in PBS containing 3% nonfat dry milk overnight at 4 °C. The lower half of the blots were probed with αGST-horseradish peroxidase TBST containing 3% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. Filters were washed five times for a total of 50 min. Signals were developed with SuperSignal chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce). ITSN Activation of Elk-1 Does Not Require EGFR Kinase Activity—We previously demonstrated cooperativity between ITSN and EGF in the synergistic activation of Elk-1 and in the transformation of rodent fibroblasts (9Adams A. Thorn J.M. Yamabhai M. Kay B.K. O'Bryan J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27414-27420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given this finding coupled with the fact that ITSN overexpression is sufficient to inhibit endocytosis (4Sengar A.S. Wang W. Bishay J. Cohen S. Egan S.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1159-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 17Pucharcos C. Estivill X. de la Luna S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), it is possible that the ability of ITSN to activate Elk-1 may stem from inhibition of EGFR down-regulation thereby leading to enhanced or sustained signaling from the activated receptor at the cell surface. Alternatively, ITSN may stimulate an autocrine loop involving EGFR ligands thereby leading to receptor activation and Elk-1 stimulation. To test whether ITSN signaling was dependent on the EGFR kinase activity, we treated cells with a specific pharmacological inhibitor of EGFR, PD153035 (18Fry D.W. Kraker A.J. McMichael A. Ambroso L.A. Nelson J.M. Leopold W.R. Connors R.W. Bridges A.J. Science. 1994; 265: 1093-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Inhibition of EGFR did not attenuate ITSN activation of Elk-1, although there was a complete loss of Elk-1 activation with EGF stimulation alone in the presence of this inhibitor. In addition, inhibition of EGFR abolished the cooperative activation of Elk-1 by ITSN and EGF. ITSN Complexes with Sos to Activate Ras—Given that the signaling activity of ITSN was independent of the EGFR kinase, we sought to determine the signaling pathway(s) activated by ITSN. Previous results revealed that ITSN complexed with the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos1, and this interaction was mediated by the SH3 domains of ITSN (10Tong X.K. Hussain N.K. de Heuvel E. Kurakin A. Abi-Jaoude E. Quinn C.C. Olson M.F. Baranes D. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1263-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To determine the specificity of this interaction, we used GST-SH3 fusion proteins of the individual ITSN SH3 domains to purify Sos1 from cell lysates. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, SH3A, SH3C, and SH3E each bound Sos1 with apparent equal affinity. GST, SH3B, and SH3D did not complex with Sos1. Given the cooperativity between EGF and ITSN and the ability of growth factor stimulation to regulate complex formation between Sos and Grb2 through phosphorylation (19Corbalan-Garcia S. Degenhardt K.R. Bar-Sagi D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1063-1068PubMed Google Scholar, 20Rozakis-Adcock M. van der Geer P. Mbamalu G. Pawson T. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1417-1426PubMed Google Scholar), we tested whether EGF stimulation of cells altered the ability of Sos1 to bind the SH3 domains of ITSN. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, EGF stimulation did not affect in vitro binding of the SH3 domains to Sos1. Overexpression of the SH3 region of ITSN inhibited EGF activation of both MAPK and Ras suggesting that ITSN might regulate Ras activation through interaction with Sos (9Adams A. Thorn J.M. Yamabhai M. Kay B.K. O'Bryan J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27414-27420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Tong X.K. Hussain N.K. Adams A.G. O'Bryan J.P. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29894-29899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Based on the localization of ITSN to the plasma membrane (21Hussain N.K. Yamabhai M. Ramjun A.R. Guy A.M. Baranes D. O'Bryan J.P. Der C.J. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15671-15677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and the interaction with Sos, we hypothesized that ITSN expression would enhance Ras activation through recruitment of Sos to the plasma membrane (22Aronheim A. Engelberg D. Nanxin L. Al-Alawi N. Schlessinger J. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 78: 949-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 23Quilliam L.A. Huff S.Y. Rabun K.M. Wei W. Park W. Broek D. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8512-8516Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Indeed, overexpression of either Xenopus or mouse ITSN was sufficient to increase Ras GTP levels (Fig. 2B). The difference in activity between Xenopus ITSN and mouse ITSN is due to higher expression of mouse versus Xenopus ITSN (data not shown). ITSN and Ras Interact on Cytoplasmic Vesicles—Previous studies reported localization of endogenous ITSN on clathrin-coated pits in COS-7 cells and cytoplasmic vesicles in primary hippocampal neurons (21Hussain N.K. Yamabhai M. Ramjun A.R. Guy A.M. Baranes D. O'Bryan J.P. Der C.J. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15671-15677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). YFP-tagged mouse ITSN expressed in COS-1 cells was observed in the cytosol and on distinct cytoplasmic vesicles that were clustered in the paranuclear region adjacent to Golgi but were also evident in the cell periphery (Fig. 3). This pattern was very similar to that observed for endogenous ITSN in hippocampal neurons (21Hussain N.K. Yamabhai M. Ramjun A.R. Guy A.M. Baranes D. O'Bryan J.P. Der C.J. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15671-15677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Although the subcellular distribution of these vesicles and the reported co-localization with clathrin are consistent with endosomes, they did not accumulate Texas Red-conjugated transferrin suggesting that they are distinct compartments (Fig. 4). However, these ITSN-positive vesicles do contain EGFR consistent with the notion that these vesicles are sites of active signaling complexes (Fig. 4). To determine if H-Ras was associated with ITSN-bearing vesicles, we co-transfected COS-1 cells with CFP-H-Ras and YFP-ITSN (Fig. 3A). H-Ras was associated with a subset of ITSN-bearing vesicles. To determine if H-Ras and ITSN interacted with each other on this compartment, we measured FRET between the two molecules. A FRET signal could be detected as sensitized emission on vesicles bearing both H-Ras and ITSN (Fig. 3A). No FRET signal was observed when YFP-ITSN was co-expressed with CFP alone (data not shown). FRET was further validated by release of donor quenching upon acceptor photobleaching (24Bastiaens P.I. Majoul I.V. Verveer P.J. Soling H.D. Jovin T.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4246-4253Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The FRET efficiency was calculated as 10 ± 1% (mean ± S.E., n = 25 vesicles), within the range reported for intracellular protein-protein interactions (15Kenworthy A.K. Methods. 2001; 24: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Furthermore, immunoprecipitation of ITSN from cell lysates resulted in the co-precipitation of wild type H-Ras (Fig. 3C). Thus, H-Ras and ITSN interact on a subset of ITSN-bearing cytoplasmic vesicles.Fig. 4Intersectin co-localizes with internalized EGF but not transferrin on intracellular vesicles in living cells.A, COS1 cells were transfected with YFP-ITSN as in Fig. 3, serum-starved 24 h later and imaged by dual color laser scanning confocal microscope during stimulation with Texas Red-conjugated EGF. YFP-ITSN is shown in green, and Texas Red-conjugated EGF is displayed in red. Arrows indicate vesicles harboring both YFP-ITSN and Texas Red-conjugated EGF. B, COS1 cells were transfected with YFP-ITSN, 24 h later were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with Texas Red-transferrin and imaged as in A. YFPITSN is shown in green, and Texas Redconjugated transferrin is displayed in red. Scale bars indicate 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine if the ITSN-H-Ras association led to Ras activation, we co-expressed the Ras binding domain of Raf-1 (RBD) tagged with CFP and YFP-ITSN along with untagged H-Ras (Fig. 3B). CFP-RBD was associated with a subset of ITSN-bearing vesicles indicating that at least a portion of the H-Ras on this compartment was in the GTP-bound state. Consistent with this result, we were able to co-precipitate constitutively activated H-Ras with ITSN (Fig. 4C). In contrast to CFP-HRas, we detected no FRET signal between CFP-RBD and YFP-ITSN. ITSN Activation of Elk-1 Is Independent of Ras—Given that ITSN complexed with Ras and stimulated RasGTP levels, we tested whether ITSN activation of Elk-1 was dependent on Ras. Co-expression of Ras dominant-negatives along with ITSN did not block Elk-1 activation by ITSN (Fig. 5). However, EGF activation of Elk-1 was inhibited by the Ras dominant-negatives as was the cooperative activation of Elk-1 by EGF and ITSN. These results indicated that ITSN signals to Elk-1 activation through a Ras-independent mechanism. ITSN Activation of Elk-1 Is Differentially Regulated by the JNK and p38 Pathways—The observation that ITSN activated Elk-1 independent of Ras and the Erk MAPK pathway coupled with the fact that p38 and JNK activate Elk-1 in various cell types (25Whitmarsh A.J. Yang S.H. Su M.S.S. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 2360-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) suggested that alternative MAPK pathways were involved in ITSN signaling. To test this hypotheses, we treated ITSN-expressing cells with a pharmacological inhibitor of JNK (26Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakaa S.T. Xu W. Leisten J.C. Motwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 6A, ITSN activation of Elk-1 was significantly impaired with JNK inhibition. Our previous studies with truncation mutants of ITSN revealed that the signaling activity of ITSN was localized to the amino-terminal EH domains (9Adams A. Thorn J.M. Yamabhai M. Kay B.K. O'Bryan J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27414-27420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of EH-expressing cells with the JNK inhibitor also blocked JNK activation. Given a recent report demonstrating that the SP600125 inhibits kinases other than JNK (27Bain J. McLauchlan H. Elliott M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar), we tested whether a JNK dominant-negative (JNKAPF) (28Lei K. Nimnual A. Zong W.X. Kennedy N.J. Flavell R.A. Thompson C.B. Bar-Sagi D. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4929-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) would also block ITSN signaling. As illustrated in Fig. 6B, stimulation o"

The high sensitivity of the mismatch-specific thymine glycosylase is exploited to facilitate reliable quantitative evaluation of the in vitro RNA editing products. A pea mitochondrial lysate correctly processes a C to U editing site in the cognate atp9 template. Reaction conditions were determined for a number of parameters, which allow first conclusions on the proteins involved. The apparent tolerance against specific Zn2+ chelators argues against the involvement of a cytidine deaminase enzyme, the theoretically most straightforward catalysator of the deamination reaction. Participation of a transaminase was investigated by testing potential amino group receptors, but none of these increased the RNA editing reaction. Most notable is the requirement of the RNA editing activity for NTPs. Any NTP or dNTP can substitute for ATP to the optimal concentration of 15 mm. This observation suggests the participation of an RNA helicase in the predicted RNA editing protein complex of plant mitochondria.

RNA editing has been observed in various forms in diverse organisms including trypanosomes, mammals, slime molds, and land plants (1Grosjean H. Benne R. Modification and Editing of RNA. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1998Crossref Google Scholar). In land plants, RNA editing has so far been reported in mitochondria and plastids. In flowering plants the majority of this organellar editing involves C to U conversions, with U to C changes occurring much more infrequently and only in mitochondria (2Bonnard G. Gualberto J. Lamattina L. Grienenberger J.M. Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1992; 10: 503-521Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 3Pring D. Brennicke A. Schuster W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 21: 1163-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 4Giegé P. Brennicke A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15324-15329Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In non-flowering plants this latter direction of RNA editing is much more common in mitochondria as well as in chloroplasts, the U to C reactions almost reaching the frequency of the C to U editing in the hornworts (5Malek O. Lättig K. Brennicke A. Knoop V. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1403-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Since its discovery more than a decade ago, progress into understanding how this process works has been hampered by the lack of manageable and reliable in vitro systems. The first in vitro system for plant mitochondrial RNA editing was successfully developed from wheat embryos (6Araya A. Domec C. Begu D. Litvak S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), but has not been exploited further. Conclusions about the determinants of specificity during RNA editing in mitochondria and in plastids have initially been drawn from comparisons of transcribed sequence duplications (e.g. 7). Such comparisons suggested that upstream (5′) sequences are crucial in targeting the editing machinery and that downstream similarities are not sufficient to specify a site. These observations were corroborated by the recent breakthrough development of an in vitro editing system for plastids (8Hirose T. Sugiura M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1144-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 9Miyamoto T. Obokata J. Sugiura M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 6726-6734Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and an electroporation protocol for mitochondria (10Farré J.-C. Araya A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2484-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 11Farré J.-C. Leon G. Jordana X. Araya A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 6731-6737Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of templates in these as well as in in vivo experiments in transgenic chloroplasts (12Chaudhuri S. Maliga P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5958-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 13Bock R. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 14Chateigner-Boutin A.-L. Hanson M.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 8448-8456Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) showed that for several editing sites 20–30 nucleotides upstream and 2–5 nucleotides downstream are sufficient to guide the editing activity, precisely what had initially been deduced for mitochondria (7Lippok B. Wissinger B. Brennicke A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The biochemistry of this RNA editing activity is still largely unclear, and more detailed understanding requires accessible in vitro systems for experimental investigations. Initial in vitro experiments from plant mitochondria had indicated that the sugar phosphate backbone remains intact during the deamination step of C to U editing (6Araya A. Domec C. Begu D. Litvak S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15Rajasekhar V.K. Mulligan R.M. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1843-1852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Blanc V.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18227-182233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Analogous observations with the in vitro systems for tobacco and pea chloroplasts further support the similarity between the editing processes in both organelles (8Hirose T. Sugiura M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1144-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 9Miyamoto T. Obokata J. Sugiura M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 6726-6734Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The most likely enzyme able to catalyze this reaction could be one of (or a homologue of) the cytidine deaminases identified in plants (18Faivre-Nitschke S.E. Grienenberger J.M. Gualberto J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 896-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) as well as in other organisms. One of these deaminases is in mammals the crucial enzyme of the apolipoprotein mRNA C to U editing (19Hodges P. Scott J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 77-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Problematic for this group of deaminases, however, appears to be the reverse reaction, because none of the homologous enzymes from various organisms has been found to be able to catalyze the amination step leading to a U to C conversion. The recent identification of this class of enzymes in Arabidopsis thaliana will allow us to determine their potential involvement in RNA editing (18Faivre-Nitschke S.E. Grienenberger J.M. Gualberto J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 896-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To facilitate direct investigations into the biochemistry and specificity of RNA editing in plant mitochondria we have now developed an in vitro system from pea mitochondria, which allows comparatively rapid and robust access to biochemical parameters. This system employs the advantages of mismatch detection and incision in double-stranded DNA by a thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) 1The abbreviations used are: TDGthymine DNA glycosylasentnucleotideRTreverse transcription.1The abbreviations used are: TDGthymine DNA glycosylasentnucleotideRTreverse transcription. enzyme (reviewed in Ref. 20Taylor G.R. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 1125-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We report ion and cofactor requirements of pea mitochondrial RNA editing, which suggest participation of an RNA helicase but do not support the involvement of a classic cytidine deaminase. thymine DNA glycosylase nucleotide reverse transcription. thymine DNA glycosylase nucleotide reverse transcription. RNA Substrates—DNA clones (patp9) were constructed in an adapted pBluescript SK+ to allow run-off transcription of the editing template RNA. The synthesized RNA molecule contains the first two pea atp9 editing sites flanked by bacterial sequences to allow specific amplification against the background of internal mRNAs (Fig. 1). 154 bp of the 5′ untranslated region and the first 69 bp of the coding sequences of the pea mitochondrial atp9 gene are cloned into the PstI site of the vector multiple cloning site between the T7 promoter followed by a KS sequence on the upstream side and the T3 promoter sequence in the downstream region. Downstream of the T3 sequence follow 89 bp of the mRNA 3′ terminal double stem-loop sequence of the pea mitochondrial atp9 gene flanked by the 20 upstream and 22 downstream adjacent nucleotides. To facilitate easier cloning, 6 nucleotides are added at the 5′ flank to create an NdeI recognition site and at the 3′ end 3 additional nucleotides generate a PvuII site (Fig. 1). The RNA substrate for the in vitro editing reaction is transcribed as a run-off product from PvuII digested patp9 using T7 RNA polymerase (MBI). The resulting transcript (475 nt) contains 69 nt upstream and 183 nt downstream sequences outside of the atp9 region. The upstream part corresponds to vector sequences from the T7 transcription start point to the PstI restriction site. The downstream anchor consists of vector sequences from the PstI site to the T3 promoter region and the downstream attached pea atp9 double stem-loop sequence. Preparation of Pea Mitochondrial Extracts—Pea seedlings (Pisum sativum L., var) were grown at 25 °C in the dark for 6 days. Mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation and purification on Percoll gradients as described previously (21Binder S. Hatzack F. Brennicke A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22182-22189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Four hundred mg of purified mitochondria were lysed in 1,200 μl of extraction buffer (0.3 M HEPES-KOH, pH 7.7, 3 mm magnesium-acetate, 2 m KCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.2% Triton X-100. After 30 min of incubation on ice, the lysate was centrifuged at 22,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was recovered and dialyzed against 5 × 100 ml dialysis buffer (30 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.7, 3 mm magnesium-acetate, 45 mm potassium-acetate, 30 mm ammonium-acetate, and 10% glycerol) for a total of 5 h. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. The resulting extract (10∼20 μg protein/μl) was rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. When stored at –80 °C the lysate was stable for at least 3 months. In Vitro RNA Editing Reactions—The in vitro RNA editing reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction mixture consisted of 30 mm HEPES-KOH, pH7.7, 3 mm magnesium-acetate, 45 mm potassium-acetate, 30 mm ammonium-acetate, 15 mm ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1% polyethyleneglycol 6000, 5% glycerol, 40 units RNase inhibitor (MBI), 1× proteinase inhibitor mixture (Complete™, Roche Applied Science), 100 amol (100 × 10–18 mol) mRNA substrate, and 6.0 μl mitochondrial extract. After incubation at 28 °C for 4 h, the substrate mRNA was extracted with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Variations of individual concentrations and additions of various other compounds are indicated in the respective figure legends. Detection of the RNA Editing Activity by Mismatch Analysis—The cDNA was synthesized from the substrate mRNA with reverse transcriptase StrataScript (Stratagene) from the T3 primer. The subsequent PCR reactions were performed with 0.1 units of Pwo polymerase (peqLab) and 0.5 units of Taq polymerase using a Cy5 labeled KS primer (Cy5-KS) and an unlabelled T3 primer. Cycling was performed as follows: 95 °C for 2 min; 5 cycles of touchdown PCR (95 °C for 30 s, 65 °C to 60 °C decreasing by 1 °C per cycle for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min); 45 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 59 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min; finally 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR products were purified by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Denaturation and reannealing were done as follows: 95 °C for 10 min; 90 °C to 70 °C decreasing by 5 °C per cycle for 5 min; 65 °C for 1 h. After reannealing, the resulting heteroduplexes were treated with 0.2 units of the enzyme TDG (thymine DNA glycosylase, Trevigen). The TDG-treated fragments were denatured for 5 min at 95 °C in alkali buffer (300 mm NaOH, 90% formamide, and 0.2% bromphenol blue), and the single strands of the DNA were separated by 6 m urea 6% PAGE. The Cy5 fluorescence was scanned and displayed using an ALF express DNA sequencer (Amersham Biosciences). To quantify the efficiency of the in vitro RNA editing reaction, the area under the peaks of the cleaved and uncut DNA fragments was determined. The ratio of cleaved, i.e. edited, fragment to uncut DNA was used to determine relative efficiencies of the investigated conditions in each experiment. To obtain comparable values to combine several independently repeated assays and to allow determination of variation bars, the ratios of cleaved to uncleaved fragments were displayed as percentages of the standard reaction conditions. Between individual experiments major sources of variation are the differences in RNA editing activity and RNase content of individual lysate preparations. In the gel analysis of the in vitro editing products, smearing of the uncut fragment signal complicates the determination of the respective signal area for comparable quantification between individual gel runs. Therefore cotreatment and parallel resolution of the template under standard conditions was adopted for reference in each experiment. The in Vitro Editing System from Pea Mitochondria—To investigate the biochemical mechanisms of RNA editing, we developed an in vitro system based upon the pea atp9 mRNA as a model substrate and a mitochondrial lysate from etiolated pea seedlings. Preparation of the mitochondrial lysate essentially followed the steps of the protocol for an RNA editing active lysate from tobacco chloroplasts (8Hirose T. Sugiura M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1144-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 9Miyamoto T. Obokata J. Sugiura M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 6726-6734Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Mitochondria prepared from 6-days-old pea seedlings as detailed under “Experimental Procedures” were lysed with 0.2% Triton X-100 in the presence of 2 m KCl. Mitochondrial debris was pelleted by centrifugation and the resulting protein supernatants were extensively dialyzed. The pea mitochondrial atp9 gene was chosen as standard substrate because this gene is abundantly transcribed and has been investigated in detail with respect to its promoters and transcript stability (22Hoffmann M. Binder S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 23Kuhn J. Tengler U. Binder S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It is furthermore efficiently edited at most of its editing sites, 2S. Binder, personal communication. including the first site in the reading frame, which was selected as the editing target. The general applicability of the system was probed with a second RNA template, which covers part of exon e from the nad5 gene in the pea mitochondrial genome (data not shown). The Detection System—Briefly, plasmid patp9 was constructed to generate the mRNA substrate for the in vitro reaction (Fig. 1). The run-off RNA transcribed from the T7 promoter in the PvuII-digested patp9 plasmid serves as the 475 nt substrate that is incubated with the pea mitochondrial extract. In this RNA 173 nt upstream of the first editing site and 49 nt downstream are genuine atp9 sequences. A second editing site lies 30 nt downstream of the first and is thus covered by the cloned region. Flanking this continuous mitochondrial sequence are (beyond the leftovers from the multiple cloning site) the sequences of the T3 and the transcribed part of the T7 phage RNA polymerase promoters, respectively, integrated. The T3 promoter sequence and the KS sequence downstream of the residual T7 promoter serve as specific PCR primer binding sites. Downstream adjacent 89 nt from the pea atp9 mRNA 3′ terminus are inserted, which contain the stability conferring inverted repeat region (23Kuhn J. Tengler U. Binder S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). After incubation in the lysate, total RNA is isolated for RT-PCR between primers Cy5-KS and T3, which are specific to the bacterial anchor inserts in patp9 and do not match any internal sequence of plant mitochondria (Fig. 1). The resulting DNA fragments are denatured and slowly reannealed, partially forming heteroduplexes at heteroplasmic sites. Nucleotide variants are expected at the sites of RNA editing, where a certain percentage of all molecules of template RNA and consequently of the PCR products will contain U respectively a T, whereas most molecules retain the unedited C. The majority of the G-containing antisense strand will result in a respective majority of T/G mismatched molecules. These heteroduplexes are detected as cleaved DNA fragments resulting from a TDG enzyme treatment (Fig. 2). TDG specifically recognizes T/G and G/G mismatches in heteroduplexes and nicks one of the two DNA strands at these sites, in the T/G mismatch the strand with the T and in the G/G mismatch either of the two. Because primer KS is labeled with Cy5, the cleaved fragments can be detected as shorter single-stranded DNA molecules in an automated DNA sequencer. An exemplary image of the automated DNA sequencer analysis of TDG cleavage at the editing site is shown in Fig. 2. After incubation with the mitochondrial extract (+Ex), TDG cleaved fragments of 218 nt are observed. Parallel incubation without the mitochondrial extract (–Ex) does not yield detectable TDG cleaved fragments. Sensitivity and Range of Detection—Artificial mixtures of DNA and cDNA sequences with varying portions of the edited cDNA sequence were employed to determine the sensitivity and detection range of the TDG mismatch cleaving procedure (Fig. 3A). The first signal of the TDG enzyme products is detected at 0.5% and a clear fragment is seen at 1% of mismatched cDNA. The intensity of the signal of course depends on the percentage of mismatches and thus on the percentage of T containing (i.e. successfully edited) substrate. Theoretically, the strongest signal is expected at a ratio of 50:50 of the C/T containing molecules. At this ratio 50% of the T containing (edited) molecules will be mismatched. At a ratio of 25% T-molecules a considerably higher proportion of these molecules (namely 75%) will be mismatched and so forth. This behavior results in a non-linear function between the ratio of T containing (edited) molecules and the observed signal (Fig. 3, B and C). Increasing the effectiveness of RNA editing beyond 50% will result in a decreasing signal, but the efficiency of in vitro RNA editing is not expected to reach this limit and leave the effective range of detection. The experiments with mixed DNA and cDNA sequences confirm this non-linear behavior, and the most effective signal conversion is indeed observed at the lowest percentage of edited nucleotides, whereas a diminished signal is seen above a concentration of 50% T-containing molecules (Fig. 3). At the higher percentages of edited sequence templates the signal is exaggerated because the uncut fragment spreads in the gel and is underrepresented. Sequence Analysis of in Vitro RNA Editing Products and Efficiency of the System—To test whether the in vitro system supports accurate RNA editing of the atp9 mRNA and to confirm the results of the TDG mismatch analysis, cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR between primers KS and T3 from substrate mRNA isolated after the editing reaction. Sequence analysis of the cloned cDNAs revealed that C to U conversion indeed occurred exclusively at the editing site in 14 out of 400 cDNA clones examined (data not shown). This result shows that a good lysate converts in the average experiment about 3–4% of the Cs to Us by in vitro RNA editing at site 1. None of these clones showed C to U conversion at site 2, which explains the absence of a detectable signal at this site in the TDG detection assays. Because the putative cis-signals for this second site should be contained in the template, in vitro editing should occur here as well. An experiment aimed at this second site by deletion of the upstream site likewise showed no editing, and more detailed specific experiments are required to investigate why this site is not altered by the lysate. Extract Concentration, Time Course, Optimal Temperature, and RNA Substrate Quantity—The in vitro editing activity showed a linear increase with increasing concentrations of extract up to adding 60–120 μg of protein extract to the final volume of 20 μl (Fig. 4A). Similar to observations made with the chloroplast lysate, 3T. Miyamoto, J. Obokata, and M. Sugiura, personal communication. tests with various extract preparations showed high protein concentrations to be crucial for activity. At saturating extract concentrations, the amount of edited product increased linearly up to 4 h of incubation time, showing that the lysate retains its activity during this time (Fig. 4B). Evaluation of the temperature influence on the in vitro editing reaction revealed a fairly sharp optimum at 28 °C with little activity observed at 37 °C, one of the temperature extremities investigated (Fig. 4C and data not shown). Tests of various amounts of the RNA substrate showed that 100 amol supply enough template to clearly detect the editing reaction. Lower quantities of the substrate tended to favor unspecific RT-PCR amplifications (data not shown), whereas higher amounts of the substrate yielded less efficient RNA editing. Thus 100 amol were routinely used in all further assays (Fig. 4D). Depending on the individual lysate preparation 60–120 μg mitochondrial protein extract and 4 h incubation time at 28 °C were adopted as standard conditions. Ion Requirements of the RNA Editing Activity—Several standard ions were investigated at varying concentrations to learn more about the properties and requirements of the editing enzyme(s) and to determine optimal concentrations. For K+ ions efficient editing of the RNA substrate was observed at levels between 20 and 45 mm (Fig. 5A and data not shown). Further increasing the concentration of this salt to 50 mm resulted in inhibition of the activity. With CaCl2 strong inhibition was observed already at a concentration of 5 mm (Fig. 5B). Increasing concentrations of Mg2+ inhibited the editing reaction less prominently. Titration of Mg2+ ions against the concentration of ATP to compensate the effect of the phosphate seems not crucial, because increasing Mg2+ ions beyond 3 mm at 15 mm ATP inhibited the reaction (not shown). The sensitivity to Ca2+ ions is possibly due to activation of unspecific protease(s) in the crude mitochondrial fraction employed here, which may degrade essential protein components of the RNA editing activity. Similarly, Mg2+ ions possibly activate unspecific nucleases in the extract. In a wheat mitochondrial in vitro RNA editing system (6Araya A. Domec C. Begu D. Litvak S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) optimal Mg2+ ion concentrations were found to be 10 mm, higher than those observed here in pea, whereas K+ salts had no effect up to 150 mm in the wheat system (6Araya A. Domec C. Begu D. Litvak S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These differences possibly reflect distinctions between the different plant species analyzed. In subsequent assays K+ was adjusted to 45 mm and Mg2+ to 3 mm, whereas no further Ca2+ ions were added. NTP/dNTP Dependence of the RNA Editing Reaction—Because for the chloroplast in vitro RNA editing reaction Hirose and Sugiura (8Hirose T. Sugiura M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1144-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) had reported a prominent influence of ATP with an optimum at 3 mm, we investigated the effect of the ATP concentration on the RNA editing activity in the mitochondrial system. The pea mitochondrial lysate displays an even higher requirement for added ATP in that no editing is observed without at least 5 mm ATP, the optimal concentration of ATP being reached only at 15 mm (Fig. 6A). The editing activity does not plateau with higher ATP concentrations, but rather is inhibited by further increasing levels of this compound. This is again different from the wheat mitochondrial lysate, where no additional ATP was required (6Araya A. Domec C. Begu D. Litvak S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We then investigated the influence of other NTPs and dNTPs and surprisingly find that any NTP or dNTP can substitute for ATP in the editing reaction (Fig. 6, B and C). Mixed assays show that the effect of different NTPs is cumulative. Addition of 5 mm of either CTP, GTP, or UTP to a 10 mm ATP reaction mixture increases the editing activity to about the level of 15 mm ATP (Fig. 6D, +5 mm and data not shown). Addition of 15 mm of any of these NTPs to 10 mm ATP results in a distinct decrease of the editing activity analogous to the one observed with 25 mm ATP alone (Fig. 6D, +15 mm and data not shown). Thus we conclude that the reaction can use any of the NTPs or dNTPs as essential cofactor in the reaction, with the optimal NTP or dNTP concentration being 15 mm in this assay (Fig. 6). Zinc Requirements of the RNA Editing Reaction and Effect of Chelators—The specific Zn2+ chelator 1.10-o-phenanthroline and the nonspecific divalent ion chelator 1.7-o-phenanthroline show comparable influences on the efficiency of the RNA editing reaction. Both had similarly little effect at 1 mm, inhibited the reaction somewhat at 5 mm and completely blocked editing at 25 mm respective concentrations (Fig. 7 and data not shown). These observations suggest that no free Zn2+ ions are required for the reaction, although of course internally bound Zn2+ ions may be protected from this interference. The inhibitory effect of divalent ion chelators was furthermore investigated by addition of EDTA or EGTA to the in vitro reaction (Fig. 8). Both chelating compounds inhibit the reaction, the editing activity is almost completely lost at 50 mm EDTA or EGTA, respectively. This further confirms that divalent ions are required, which can be titrated by chelators, but we can as yet not deduce their identity. Tests for Cofactors as Potential Acceptors for the Amino Group—Several compounds used in transamination reactions in other biochemical pathways were tested for their influence on the RNA editing activity (data not shown). However, neither glutamate, α-ketoglutarate, nor aspartate changed the efficiency of the editing reaction. Actually, these low molecular compounds should have been completely eliminated from the extract by the extensive dialysis. Addition should have increased the editing reaction, if any of these compounds was active as amino group acceptor in a transaminating reaction. The in Vitro System—We here report a sensitive in vitro system for RNA editing in plant mitochondria and its application to investigations of molecular and biochemical characteristics of this process. Such an open system should allow conclusions about the enzymatic activities involved. Our novel detection system identifies in vitro RNA editing events via PCR amplification of cDNA and mismatch detection consistently and reproducibly. We find the high sensitivity of the detection cascade to be essential for a robust mitochondrial in vitro system, because the efficiency of the in vitro activity is not very high. From the direct sequence analysis of 400 cDNA clones as well as from the observed signal strength in the mismatch system we estimate about 3–4% of the cytosines at the investigated atp9 site to be deaminated to uridines in an average in vitro reaction. In the previously established in vitro system for wheat mitochondria, the wheat atp9 gene was edited to about 6%, a similarly low efficiency (6Araya A. Domec C. Begu D. Litvak S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In their chloroplast in vitro system Hirose and Sugiura (8Hirose T. Sugiura M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1144-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) observed about 10–30% editing of the added template RNA, 5–8 times more efficient than the wheat (6Araya A. Domec C. Begu D. Litvak S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) or our pea mitochondrial extracts. All the variations of mitochondrial extract preparations we tested did not further improve the efficiency, and we are tempted to think that this limitation maybe an inherent feature of mitochondria. Possibly the more than 10-fold higher number of different RNA editing sites in mitochondria versus chloroplasts in flowering plants dilutes essential factor(s) to reaction-limiting concentrations. Indeed any attempt at stretching the amount of extract used per experiment rapidly leads to a complete loss of editing (Fig. 4A and data not shown). This suggests that the concentrations of one or more compounds in the mitochondrial lysate are crucial to get any editing at all. In Vitro RNA Editing at Another Site—To evaluate the generality of the in vitro system, we tested in addition to the atp9 template also an RNA substrate covering exon e of the nad5 gene in pea (data not shown). The selected region was cloned into the arrangement described for atp9 (Fig. 1). The generated run-off RNA contains four RNA editing sites, the most 5′ of which was investigated in vitro. In vitro editing is found to alter the correct nucleotide also in this template (data not shown), confirming the mitochondrial extract to contain all necessary factors for editing at several sites. Involvement of an RNA Helicase?—ATP requirement, which is usually equal to energy needs, can yield important information about the enzyme(s) involved in a biochemical reaction. For the chloroplast in vitro RNA editing reaction, Hirose and Sugiura (8Hirose T. Sugiura M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1144-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) reported a strict ATP dependence. Furthermore, a non-hydrolyzable analog was not able to substitute for ATP, suggesting that ATP is indeed used as an energy source. In our plant mitochondrial in vitro system the RNA editing activity is similarly dependent on and influenced by the concentration of ATP (Fig. 6). Conversely in the wheat mitochondrial in vitro system (6Araya A. Domec C. Begu D. Litvak S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) addition of nucleoside triphosphate did not affect RNA editing, which may be due to different biochemical requirements between monocot and dicot plants or a feature of the different lysate preparation protocols. In our pea system the optimal concentration of ATP was observed at 15 mm, beyond which higher concentrations inhibited the editing activity. Surprisingly any of the other NTPs or dNTPs can substitute for ATP in the editing reaction, which is not very common for enzymatically catalyzed reactions. Some of the few enzymes accepting NTP or dNTP belong to a subgroup of the RNA helicases (24Flores-Rozas H. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 28: 21372-21383Google Scholar, 25Okanami M. Meshi T. Iwabuchi M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2638-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). RNA helicases have been identified in plants through in silico analyses of the genomic and cDNA data in the databases and a number of putative genes have been found in the A. thaliana genome (26Aubourg S. Kreis M. Lechamy A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 628-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Several of these are predicted to contain N-terminal pre-sequences, which may target the respective protein to either the chloroplast and/or the mitochondrion. These predictions, however, need to be investigated experimentally in each instance. So far, evidence for only one RNA helicase as a mitochondrial enzyme has been published, AtSUV3, the homologue of the yeast suv3 gene (27Gagliardi D. Kuhn J. Spadinger U. Brennicke A. Leaver C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial subcellular targeting and ATPase activity have been shown for this protein, but its general NTP requirements have not yet been tested in detail. In yeast the suv3 enzyme is potentially involved in RNA turnover and its homologue in plants may have a similar function. This analogy would suggest that one of the other predicted mitochondrial helicases could be a more likely candidate helicase for RNA editing. Involvement of a Cytidine Deaminase?—The deamination of cytidine to uridine typical for higher plant mitochondria and chloroplasts could most easily be achieved by a direct deamination reaction such as those catalyzed by cytidine deaminases. The most prominent example of a cytidine deaminase diverted to RNA editing is the modification of the apolipoprotein B mRNA in several mammals (1Grosjean H. Benne R. Modification and Editing of RNA. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1998Crossref Google Scholar, 19Hodges P. Scott J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 77-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 28Navaratnam N.

Bhattacharya S. Fujino T. Patel D. Jarmuz A.L. Scott J. Cell. 1995; 81: 187-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To investigate the potential participation of such a cytidine deaminase, we tested the RNA editing activity in our plant mitochondrial extract for its sensitivity to chelators of Zn2+ ions. Such specific chelators can completely block the classic cytidine deaminases including the apobec-1 enzyme, which requires Zn2+ ions to deaminate a single C in the apolipoprotein B mRNA (28Navaratnam N. Morrison J.R. Bhattacharya S. Patel D. Funahashi T. Giannoni F. Teng B.-B. Davidson N.O. Scott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20709-20712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Navaratnam N. Bhattacharya S. Fujino T. Patel D. Jarmuz A.L. Scott J. Cell. 1995; 81: 187-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The insensitivity of the pea mitochondrial editing reaction to the Zn2+ ion-chelator suggests the involvement of an enzyme distinct from the classic cytidine deaminases. Indirect support for this conclusion also comes from the occurrence of reverse reactions in plant mitochondria (i.e. the C to U de facto amination reactions), which have never been found to be catalyzed by a cytidine deaminase. Enzymes known to mediate both forward and reverse reactions include transaminases, such as those involved in amino acid synthesis pathways. The possibility of a transamination reaction was tested by monitoring the effect of several potential NH2 acceptors used in transamination reactions in vivo, glutamate, α-ketoglutarate, and aspartate. None of these potential acceptors improved the efficiency of the editing reaction. A transamination reaction is nevertheless possible with different amino group acceptors, because the biochemical and enzymatic requirements for the C to U deamination as well as the U to C aminating reaction would most parsimoniously be explained by a single transaminase acting for both directions of the amino group transfer.

https://openalex.org/W2131522684,"ICln is a multifunctional protein that is essential for cell volume regulation. It can be found in the cytosol and is associated with the cell membrane. Besides its role in the splicing process, ICln is critically involved in the generation of ion currents activated during regulatory volume decrease after cell swelling (RVDC). If reconstituted in artificial bilayers, ICln can form ion channels with biophysical properties related to RVDC. We investigated (i) the cytosol versus cell membrane distribution of ICln in rat kidney tubules, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, and LLC-PK1 epithelial cells, (ii) fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in living fibroblasts between fluorescently tagged ICln and fluorochromes in the cell membrane, and (iii) possible functional consequences of an enhanced ICln presence at the cell membrane. We demonstrate that ICln distribution in rat kidneys depends on the parenchymal localization and functional state of the tubules and that cell swelling causes ICln redistribution from the cytosol to the cell membrane in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and LLC-PK1 cells. The addition of purified ICln protein to the extracellular solution or overexpression of farnesylated ICln leads to an increased anion permeability in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. The swelling-induced redistribution of ICln correlates to altered kinetics of RVDC in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, LLC-PK1 cells, and MDCK cells. In these cells, RVDC develops more rapidly, and in MDCK cells the rate of swelling-induced depolarization is accelerated if cells are swollen for a second time.

This coincides with an enhanced ICln association with the cell membrane. The ability of volume regulation is a fundamental feature of cells. On the one hand, cells are persistently challenged by disturbances of the osmotic equilibrium between intra- and extracellular space due to changes in the ambient osmolarity, metabolism of osmotically active solutes or ion- and substrate transport. On the other hand, cells have to change their volume to execute specific functions such as cell division, migration, or secretion. Accordingly, cell volume regulatory mechanisms are involved in various cell functions, and disturbances of these mechanisms can lead to severe dysfunctions (1.Lang F. Busch G.L. Ritter M. Völkl H.

Besides K+ channels, most cells activate a distinct class of anion channels (termed IClvol, IClswell, volume-regulated anion channel, or volume-sensitive osmolyte and anion channel). Interestingly, these channels are also permeable to cations, organic osmolytes, and possibly ATP. Therefore, the (an)ion channels and the respective currents that are activated by cell swelling have recently been termed and are here referred to as regulatory volume decrease channels/currents (RVDC) (3.Fürst J. Gschwentner M. Ritter M. Botta G. Jakab M. Mayer M. Garavaglia L. Bazzini C. Rodighiero S. Meyer G. Eichmüller S. Wöll E. Paulmichl M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J.

The phenotypes of RVDC vary between cells but display some fingerprint features: they can be blocked by chloride channel blockers and extracellular nucleotides, are outwardly rectifying, inactivate at positive potentials, and are permeable to organic osmolytes and to both anions and cations in a manner depending on pH, calcium concentration, and lipid composition (3.Fürst J. Gschwentner M. Ritter M. Botta G. Jakab M. Mayer M. Garavaglia L. Bazzini C. Rodighiero S. Meyer G. Eichmüller S. Wöll E. Paulmichl M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2002; 444: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The molecular identity of RVDC is still elusive if we expect a one-molecule/one-function relation, i.e. that one molecule is responsible for generating all of the heterogeneous current phenotypes observed after cell swelling in different cells. However, several candidate-proteins can be envisioned to be involved in the formation of functional RVDC, such as ATP binding cassette transporters (P-glycoprotein, MDR1, CFTR), phospholemman, voltage-dependent anion channels, the CLC family of chloride channels (CLC2 and CLC3), and ICln (3.Fürst J. Gschwentner M. Ritter M. Botta G. Jakab M. Mayer M. Garavaglia L. Bazzini C. Rodighiero S. Meyer G. Eichmüller S. Wöll E. Paulmichl M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2002; 444: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). ICln is a highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed protein that has been identified in all cells studied so far. The human gene for ICln is located on chromosome 11q13.5–14.1 and controlled by a constitutively highly active promoter (5.Scandella E. Nagl U.O. Oehl B. Bergmann F. Gschwentner M. Fürst J.

The protein is essential for life, because all attempts to genetically knock out ICln in either mice, nematodes, or a cell line failed due to the lethality of the knockout (6.Pu W.T. Wickman K.

ICln is mainly found to be a water-soluble protein in the cytosol, but some portion is found within or in close association with the cell membrane. Different functions have been discussed for ICln. Overexpression of ICln in Xenopus laevis oocytes results in the occurrence of ion currents with features closely resembling RVDC. Accordingly it was assumed that ICln could form the ion conductive part of RVDC (7.Paulmichl M. Li Y. Wickman K. Ackerman M. Peralta E. Clapham D.

Overexpression of ICln or ICln related peptides in Escherichia coli renders the bacteria tolerant to hypotonicity, an effect that can be reversed by extracellular nucleotides (12.Tao G.-Z.

Reconstitution of purified ICln in lipid bilayers indeed revealed that the protein can form ion channels and the induced current displays fingerprint features of RVDC. ICln reconstituted in heart lipid is anion selective, in artificial lipids it is cation selective, with relative permeability sequences matching those of RVDC (14.Fürst J. Bazzini C. Jakab M.

Analysis of the amino acid sequence of ICln predicts a transmembrane domain in the N-terminal half of the protein. This sequence shows a remarkable similarity to the pore-forming β-hairpin of α-hemolysin and leukocidin, which are water-soluble bacterial toxins that refold and build large pores upon insertion into cell membranes. Secondary structure and hydrophobicity pattern prediction suggests a transmembrane domain that is composed of a four-stranded β-sheet. To form a functional channel, the formation of an ICln dimer is required. The model of the ICln channel has been refined by site-directed mutagenesis experiments (7.Paulmichl M. Li Y. Wickman K.

It is however still a matter of debate, as to whether the protein itself is a part of the molecular RVDC complex or rather acts as a regulator thereof (4.Jakab M. Fürst J. Gschwentner M. Botta G.

In addition to its role in volume regulation, ICln has recently been shown to interact with methylosomes, a cytoplasmatic complex involved in RNA splicing (19.Pu W.T. Krapivinsky G.B. Krapivinsky L.

An intriguing feature of ICln is that it can appear in a water-soluble form, as well as in close association with the cell membrane. The mechanisms by which soluble ICln protein associates with and/or incorporates itself into the membrane are unknown. The present study has been performed to further investigate the intracellular distribution of ICln under normal conditions and during hypo-osmotic stress, as well as to correlate an enhanced presence of membrane-bound ICln with functional changes of the cell. All salts, chemicals, and drugs were of pro analysi grade and purchased from Sigma, Germany unless otherwise stated. Cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen, Germany. Optical filters were purchased from AHF Analysentechnik, Germany. Standard procedures (23.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and procedures according to the manufacturers' protocols were used for DNA preparation, cloning, purification, and sequencing. Plasmids coding for fusion proteins of ICln attached to the C terminus of ECFP or EYFP (CFP-ICln and YFP-ICln) were prepared by cloning the ORF coding for the canine (MDCK) ICln inframe into the vectors pECFP-C1 and pEYFP-C1 (Clontech) using the XhoI and BamH1 restriction sites. For cell membrane labeling with fluorescent proteins (CFP-Mem and YFP-Mem) the vectors pECFPMem and pEYFPMem (Clontech) were used. To enhance targeting of ICln to the cell membrane, cells were transfected with the pCDNA3YFPCaaX vector (24.Fürst J. Haller T. Chwatal S. Wöll E. Dartsch P.C. Gschwentner M. Dienstl A. Zwierzina H.

The same vector lacking the ICln and YFP insert was used as a control vector. All constructs were sequenced using an automated sequencer (Gene ReadIR 4200, LiCor). The ORF of ICln was cloned in-frame into the pET3-His vector, which adds a histidine tag to the N terminus of ICln (14.Fürst J. Bazzini C. Jakab M. Meyer G. König M. Gschwentner M. Ritter M. Schmarda A. Botta G. Benz R. Deetjen P. Paulmichl M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2000; 440: 100-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein was expressed in E. coli (BL21/DE3), purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen) and stored at –74 °C in 50 mm K2HPO4, 200 mm imidazole, pH 8.00. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, LLC-PK1 cells, and MDCK cells (strain II, low resistance) were grown in culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin, at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and 95% air. Subcultures were routinely established every second to third day by trypsin/EDTA treatment (0.05%, pH 7.2). Cells were used for experiments at a degree of confluency of ∼40–70% unless otherwise stated. For transfection with the appropriate plasmids, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were grown to 70% confluency and incubated for 6 h with 3 μg of plasmid DNA and 7 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000™ (Invitrogen). For double transfection with CFP-ICln and YFP-Mem a ratio of 2:1 yielded the best results. Thereafter the cells were subcultured and grown on uncoated glass cover slips for 24–48 h. The transfection efficacy was ∼15–20%. For all FRET experiments, ECFP served as a donor and EYFP as an acceptor (26.Gadella Jr., T.W. van der Krogt G.N. Bisseling T.

Cells were cotransfected with CFP-ICln and YFP-Mem (schematically shown in Fig. 1A) or with CFP-Mem and YFP-ICln. Transfected cells were superfused at room temperature (20–23 °C) with a control solution (in mm: NaCl 90, KCl 5, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 2, glucose 5, mannitol 80, HEPES 10, pH 7.4) or hypotonic solution (omission of mannitol). Visualization of ECFP- and/or EYFP-expressing cells and detection of FRET was performed on an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope equipped with a monochromator (Polychrome 4, TILL Photonics) and a cooled charge-coupled device camera (TILL Imago SVGA) controlled by the TILL Vision software (versions 3.3 and 4.0). Experiments were either performed by changing three separate Olympus BX cubes equipped with the appropriate filter combinations for ECFP, EYFP, and FRET measurements or by using a CFP/YFP dual-band polychroic mirror in combination with a real-time dual color imaging device (Dual-View™, Optical Insights) (Table I). All images were adjusted to pixel-by-pixel alignment and corrected for background, which was then clamped to zero (29.Xia Z. Liu Y. Biophys.

Open table in a new tab Light from a xenon lamp (XBO 75, Osram) was passed through a 515-nm cutoff filter toward the object. The FRET efficiency (FRETeff) was calculated from the increase in ECFP intensity after the bleaching of EYFP: FRETeff = 1 – (ICFP-bgDA/ICFP-bgD), where ICFP-bgDA and ICFP-bgD are the background-corrected fluorescence intensities of ECFP in the presence of both donor and acceptor and in the presence of the donor alone, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1 (B and C) YFP-Mem is bleached to 11 ± 2% (n = 6) within 10 min. This is paralleled by an increase of the CFP-ICln fluorescence to 114 ± 5% (n = 6). The calculated FRET efficiency after 10 min is 0.11 ± 0.04 (n = 6) and 0.20 ± 0.03 (n = 6) if calculated from the entire area of the cell and from selected regions close to the cells' outer margins, respectively. Fig. 1D shows the calculated FRET efficiency image of the cells shown in Fig. 1C. Corrected FRET images (NFRET) were calculated from the sensitized emission of EYFP (29.Xia Z. Liu Y. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2395-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Each of the images was corrected for ECFP cross-talk (i.e. contribution of ECFP emission to the EYFP emission window) and EYFP cross-excitation (i.e. EYFP emission due to excitation at 436 nm), and this is referred to as, netFRET = IFRET-bg – (ICFP-bg × k1) – (IYFP-bg × k2), where IFRET-bg, ICFP-bg, and IYFP-bg are the background-corrected pixel gray values in the windows for FRET (ex, 436; em, 560 nm), ECFP (ex, 436; em, 480 nm), and EYFP (ex, 515; em, 560 nm), and k1 and k2 denote the relative contribution to the fluorescence intensity in the FRET window by ECFP cross-talk (k1) and EYFP cross-excitation (k2). For the excitation wavelengths and filter combinations provided in Table I, k1 and k2 were measured to be 0.3 and 0.04, respectively. These values did not change significantly under hypotonic conditions. The obtained netFRET values were normalized against protein expression levels and are referred to as, NFRET = netFRET × 100/(ICFP-bg × IYFP-bg)1/2 (29.Xia Z. Liu Y. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2395-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The integrated fluorescence density values of the images from total cells or from particular regions of interest therein were analyzed using TILL Vision and Microsoft Excel software. Because the fluorescence of green fluorescent protein and its variants is sensitive to pH (30.Llopis J. McCaffery J.M. Miyawaki A. Farquhar M.G. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6803-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar), FRET could be affected by swelling-induced intracellular acidification (31.Ritter M. Paulmichl M. Lang F. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1991; 418: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). During cell swelling the relative fluorescence of YFP-Mem decreased by 5.5 ± 2.3% (n = 17), and the measured FRET signals are therefore likely to be underestimated. Rat kidneys were removed after sacrifice, decapsulated, and cut into 2-mm sections from which the cortex, outer medulla, inner medulla, and papilla regions were separated (Fig. 2), washed in ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4), frozen and stored at –70 °C until further processing for Western analysis. For IGSS, the sections were fixed overnight (2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS), washed in PBS, dehydrated in ethanol, incubated in xylol and paraplast, cut to 6-μm sections, and placed on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips. Thereafter the paraplast was removed, the specimens were rehydrated, rinsed in distilled water and PBS (32.Huang W.M. Gibson S.J. Facer P. Gu J. Polak J.M. Histochemistry. 1983; 77: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), incubated in diluted (1:10) normal rabbit serum, then placed for 1 h in the primary polyclonal rabbit anti-ICln-antibody-containing solution (14.Fürst J. Bazzini C. Jakab M. Meyer G. König M. Gschwentner M. Ritter M. Schmarda A. Botta G. Benz R. Deetjen P. Paulmichl M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2000; 440: 100-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), washed and incubated with the labeled (10-nm gold) secondary anti-rabbit IgG antibody. Then the samples were extensively washed, incubated in the dark for 5–10 min in a 1:1 mixture of hydrochinon and silver acetate (British Bio Cell International), washed extensively again in distilled water, subjected to iron hematoxilin staining and evaluated on a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM 410, Zeiss). The images obtained from the light reflections from the silver grains were overlaid with the conventional confocal transmission images. Subconfluent NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, LLC-PK1 cells, MDCK cells, or confluent LLC-PK1 cells were washed with PBS, detached by gentle treatment with trypsin, suspended in isotonic PBS, centrifuged for 10 min (700 × g, room temperature) and resuspended for 15 min in either isotonic or hypotonic buffer at 37 °C. The buffers were composed of (mm): phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 0.1, 2-ME 5 in PBS (pH 7.4; 310 mosm) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 0.1, 2-ME 5, Tris-HCl 20, in distilled water (pH 7.4; 110 mosm). Thereafter, the cells were homogenized by repeated freeze-thawing cycles (liquid nitrogen/37 °C) or by sonication (5–20 s, 4 °C) in lysis buffer (33.Stuart-Tilley A. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. Schwartz M.A. Brown D. Alper S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C559-C568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cell lysates were centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. Supernatant (cytosolic fraction) and pellet (membrane fraction) were separated, and 2 μl of each supernatant was used to determine the protein concentration (34.Bradford M. Analyt. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Sample buffer (4× SDS-PAGE) was added to each sample containing supernatant. A volume of 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, equal to the volume of the corresponding supernatant sample, was added to the respective membrane fraction. Samples were then vortexed, heated to 100 °C for 5 min, centrifuged (19,000 × g, 5 min), and separated on a 13% SDS-PAGE according to the method of Laemmli (35.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). A volume containing 100 μg of cytosolic protein, and an equal volume from the corresponding membrane-sample was loaded onto the gel for electrophoretic protein separation. Thus the same relative amounts of the total cytosolic proteins and total membrane proteins, respectively, of a given cell preparation were separated. Proteins were then electroblotted (23.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked in TBS containing 1% Tween and 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with primary anti-ICln polyclonal antibody for 1 h, washing, incubation with secondary antibody (1:2500) in TBST and antibody detection by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL™-System, Amersham Biosciences). Significant immunoreactivity was detected only at an apparent molecular mass of 36 kDa. Densitometric quantification was performed for the 36-kDa bands (ImageQuant™, Amersham Biosciences or Eagle Eye™, Stratagene). Data from subconfluent and confluent LLC-PK1 cells were pooled. Whole Cell Patch Clamp and Perforated Patch Clamp Measurements—Cells were used 24–48 h after splitting. All experiments were performed at room temperature. For data acquisition and analysis, an EPC-9 (HEKA) or Axopatch 200A (Axon Instruments) amplifier, as well as Pulse/Pulsefit software (HEKA) were used. Current signals were filtered at 1 kHz (4-pole Bessel). The holding potential was 0 mV. The time courses of current activation were monitored by applying pulses (0.5 s) to +40 mV at intervals of 10 s. Current-voltage relations were registered by pulsing (0.5 s) from –120 mV to +100 mV with step increments of 20 mV or by applying a voltage ramp (–120 mV"

Activation of matrix metalloproteinases induced by three-dimensional type I collagen, the principal component of the myocardial interstitium, is hypothesized to be essential for this migration. By utilizing primary cultures of cardiac fibroblasts and collagen lattice models, we demonstrated that type I collagen induced MMP-2 activation, and cells undergoing a change from isometric tension to mechanical unloading were associated with increased levels of total and active MMP-2 species. The collagen-induced MMP-2 activation coincided with up-regulated cellular levels of both membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) and TIMP-2. A fraction of cellular membrane prepared from cells embedded in the collagen lattice containing active MT1-MMP and TIMP-2 was capable of activating pro-MMP-2, and exogenous TIMP-2 had a biphasic effect on this membrane-mediated MMP-2 activation. Interestingly, the presence of 43-kDa MT1-MMP species in a fraction of intracellular soluble proteins prepared from monolayer cells but not cells embedded in the lattices indicates that MT1-MMP metabolizes differently under the two different culture conditions. Treatment of cells embedded in the lattice with furin inhibitor attenuated pro-MT1-MMP processing and MMP-2 activation and impeded cell migration and invasion. These results suggest that the migration and invasion of cardiac fibroblasts is furin-dependent and that the active species of MT1-MMP and MMP-2 may be involved in both events.

First of all, MMP-2 activation and high levels of MT1-MMP are well correlated with tumor spread (13Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Invasion Metastasis. 1994; 14: 259-268PubMed Google Scholar, 14Nomura H.

Moreover, generation of active MT1-MMP and mature MMP-2, which is necessary for proteolytic degradation of ECM during cell migration and invasion, requires the action of furin in many cell types studied (29Yana I. Weiss S.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2387-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 30Aznavoorian S. Moore B.A. Alexander-Lister L.D. Hallit S.L. Windsor L.J. Engler J.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6264-6275PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of furin prevents collagen-induced pro-MT1-MMP processing and MMP-2 activation in HT1080 cells (31Maquoi E. Noel A. Frankenne F. Angliker H. Murphy G. Foidart J.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and melanoma MV3 cell line (32Kurschat P. Zigrino P. Nischt R. Breitkopf K. Steurer P.

Alternatively, transfection with α1-PDX (a protein-based specific furin inhibitor) cDNA prevents pro-MT1-MMP processing and MMP-2 activation in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells and attenuates the invasive capacity of these cells (33Bassi D.E. Lopez D.C.R. Mahloogi H. Zucker S. Thomas G. Klein-Szanto A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10326-10331Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that furin modulates cell migration and invasion. We hypothesized that the activation of matrix metalloproteinases induced by three-dimensional type I collagen would be essential for the migration and invasion of cardiac fibroblasts residing in the collagen matrix in vitro. By utilizing primary cultures of cardiac fibroblasts and collagen lattice models, we demonstrated that three-dimensional type I collagen-induced MMP-2 activation coincided with up-regulated cellular levels of MT1-MMP and TIMP-2. High levels of active MT1-MMP and TIMP-2 were associated with a fraction of cellular membrane prepared from cells embedded in the collagen lattice, and 43-kDa MT1-MMP species was found in a fraction of intracellular soluble proteins prepared from monolayer cells but not cells embedded in the collagen lattices. Inhibition of furin attenuated MT1-MMP and MMP-2 activation induced by three-dimensional type I collagen and impeded the migration and invasion of cells embedded in the collagen lattice. Furthermore, the expression profile of cellular furin protein by cells embedded in the collagen lattice was different from that expressed by their counterparts cultured as a monolayer. These results suggest that the migration and invasion of cardiac fibroblasts is furin-dependent and that the active species of MMP-2 and MT1-MMP may be involved in both events. Cell Culture—Cardiac fibroblasts were prepared by enzymatic dissociation of left ventricular tissue from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (250–450 g), as described previously (34Piacentini L. Gray M. Honbo N.Y. Chentoufi J. Bergman M. Karliner J.S. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2000; 32: 565-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and maintained in minimal essential medium (MEM) (Invitrogen) containing 10% (v/v) newborn bovine calf serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C, in humidified air supplemented with 5% CO2 until the cells were almost confluent. Two to three rats were used for each preparation. First and second passage cardiac fibroblasts were used for experiments. Human fibrosarcoma cell lines (HT1080 cells, European Collection of Cell Culture, EC number 85111505) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (DMEM), 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), and 1% (v/v) non-essential amino acids at 37 °C in humidified air supplemented with 5% CO2. Preparation of Collagen Lattices—Three-dimensional type I collagen lattices were prepared as described previously in other cells type (5Lee A.Y. Akers K.T. Collier M. Li L. Eisen A.Z. Seltzer J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4424-4429Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 12Tomasek J.J. Halliday N.L. Updike D.L. Ahern-Moore J.S. Vu T.K. Liu R.W. Howard E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7482-7487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Type I collagen (BD Biosciences), 10× concentrated MEM, NaOH (1 n), and deionized H2O were used to make up the collagen lattice solution. This solution was constituted in the pH-adjusted serum-free MEM such that the culture conditions were identical to those employed for cells cultured as a monolayer. Briefly, following trypsinization cardiac fibroblasts were pelletted and washed twice with serum-free MEM. After centrifugation the cells were suspended with serum-free MEM supplemented with apotransferrin (10 μg/ml), insulin (10 μg/ml), and selenium (5 ng/ml). Then one part of cell suspension was added to three parts of collagen lattice solution. The final collagen concentration was adjusted to ∼1 mg/ml at a density of ∼1 × 106 cells/ml (unless otherwise stated). At this point, the collagen mixture was mixed quickly and thoroughly, and 500 μl or 2-ml aliquots were pipetted into each well of 6-well plates or each 100-mm dish, respectively. After 60 min of incubation at 37 °C to allow for polymerization of the collagen, 2.5 or 8 ml of serum-free medium was placed over each collagen lattice in the plates or dishes. Under these conditions a collagen lattice, previously termed a “stabilized lattice” (12Tomasek J.J. Halliday N.L. Updike D.L. Ahern-Moore J.S. Vu T.K. Liu R.W. Howard E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7482-7487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), formed that remained attached to the base of the culture plate. In some experiments this stabilized lattice was detached from the plate base after 24 h, and this was termed a “released lattice” (12Tomasek J.J. Halliday N.L. Updike D.L. Ahern-Moore J.S. Vu T.K. Liu R.W. Howard E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7482-7487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a “floating lattice” was generated by gently detaching the lattice from the plate base using a sterile spatula immediately after polymerization (35Rosenfeldt H. Grinnell F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3088-3092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The stabilized, released, and floating lattices represent different mechanical loading; in the stabilized lattice, cells develop isometric tension in an attached polymerized collagen gel; in the floating lattice, cells remain mechanically unloaded; in the released lattice, cells undergo a change from isometric tension to mechanical unloading (35Rosenfeldt H. Grinnell F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3088-3092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The cell-populated lattices were maintained for 24–96 h in serum-free media. The three lattice types were used to test the effect of the changes in mechanical tension on MMP-2 activation, whereas only the stabilized lattice was employed for the other experiments. For comparison, stabilized HT1080 cell-populated, three-dimensional type I collagen lattices were generated using a similar experimental protocol applied for cardiac fibroblasts. HT1080 cells were seeded at a density of ∼1 × 106 cells/ml into the lattice that had a collagen concentration of ∼1 mg/ml. 10× concentrated DMEM was used as the substitute for the concentrated MEM for making up collagen lattice solution. Serum-free DMEM supplemented with 1% (v/v) non-essential amino acids, apotransferrin, insulin, and selenium was layered over the lattice after polymerization of the collagen. Preparation of Whole Cell Lysates—Polymerized collagen lattices containing embedded cells were centrifuged at 400 × g to remove as much water as possible, then suspended in a large volume of ice-cold PBS, mixed well, and centrifuged again. This wash procedure was performed 5 times. The entire lattice was then mixed with a chilled lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1% (v/v) IGEPAL CA-630, 0.05% (v/v) Brij 35, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μm E-64, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, homogenized by trituration with a 22-gauge needle for 30 passages, vigorously vortexed, and lysed on ice for 60 min. After a centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 15 min, supernatants corresponding to the whole cell lysates were collected. Meanwhile, lysate samples from time-matched cells grown as a monolayer were prepared using an identical protocol after the cells were thoroughly washed twice with PBS and scraped into the chilled lysis buffer. Preparation of Intracellular Soluble Proteins—Intracellular soluble proteins were prepared as described previously (36Pei D. Kang T. Qi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33988-33997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Following 24 h of culture, monolayer cells or cell-populated collagen lattices were washed three times with PBS and incubated with PBS (pH 7.2) containing 0.1% (w/v) saponin, 75 mm potassium acetate, and 25 mm Hepes for 30 min at room temperature. The supernatant was collected, and a proteinase inhibitor mixture including 1 mm PMSF, 10 μm E-64, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A was immediately added. The post-saponin extraction residual components were then lysed with the chilled lysis buffer as stated above. Following protein concentration determination, saponin-extracted supernatant was concentrated using Micron YM-10 concentrators (Millipore Corp.). Preparation of Cell Membrane Fraction—Cell membrane fractions were prepared from cardiac fibroblasts embedded in three-dimensional type I collagen lattice using a modified method (5Lee A.Y. Akers K.T. Collier M. Li L. Eisen A.Z. Seltzer J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4424-4429Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cells were embedded in the lattice for 24 h under serum-free conditions and were then digested from the lattices by incubating with type V clostridial collagenase at a concentration of 100 units/mg collagen with constant shaking. The digestion took 15–20 min for completion. At this point, a large volume of MEM containing 10% newborn bovine calf serum was added to neutralize the collagenase. The cells were washed three times using PBS, counted, and resuspended in a hypotonic osmotic shock buffer containing 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm PMSF, and 10 μm E-64 at ∼107 cells/ml. The cell suspension was homogenized on ice by trituration with a 22-gauge needle until phase contrast microscopic examination showed that over 80% cells were broken. The solubilized sample was centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was taken and kept on ice. The pellet was resuspended in a small volume of the osmotic shock buffer and re-triturated through the needle. Following another centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was pooled with the first to make up the whole cell homogenate. The whole cell homogenate was then centrifuged at 6,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The subsequent post-nuclear supernatant was pelleted at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Precipitates corresponding to cell membrane fractions were washed with a chilled buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.02% (w/v) NaN3 and ultracentrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the precipitates were then resuspended in this buffer. Cell membrane fractions were prepared from time-matched untreated cells grown as a monolayer using an identical protocol. Zymography—Gelatinolytic activities in media samples and whole cell lysates were detected using zymography. A gelatin (type I, Sigma) concentration of 2 mg/ml was employed in 10% polyacrylamide resolving gels. Gelatinolytic bands were size-calibrated with a high molecular mass marker (Sigma), and the intensity of the bands was quantified using NIH1.62 image software program. The ratio of the active (A) MMP-2, which includes intermediate and full active forms of MMP-2, to the total (T) MMP-2, which combines pro- and active forms of MMP-2, was calculated. The A/T ratio (%) was adopted in this study as an index for the evaluation of the extent of MMP-2 activation as described previously (37Zucker S. Conner C. DiMassmo B.I. Ende H. Drews M. Seiki M. Bahou W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23730-23738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—To examine expressions of MMP-2, MT1-MMP, TIMP-2, or furin in whole cell lysates, cell membrane fraction, or conditioned media, Western blot analysis was performed. Sample proteins were prepared under reducing conditions, size-fractionated in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide resolving gel, and transferred onto Hybond-P hydrophobic polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Monoclonal antibodies against MMP-2 (Ab-3, Oncogene, used in 1:1,000 dilution) and MT1-MMP (2D7, generously gifted by Dr. Marie-christine Rio, Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, Strasbourg, France, used in 1:50 dilution), furin (Mon-139, Alexis Biochemicals, used in 1:1,000 dilution), and a polyclonal antibody against TIMP-2 (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, used in 1:1,000 dilution) were employed. Secondary goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, used in 1:5,000 dilution) was used for monoclonal antibody procedures, whereas secondary donkey anti-goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, used in 1:10,000 dilution) was used for polyclonal antibody procedures. Immunoreactive bands in the membrane were detected with a standard chemiluminescence procedure (Amersham Biosciences). Generation of Cell Migration and Invasion Models—In order to investigate the potential of cardiac fibroblasts for migration and invasion from three-dimensional type I collagen lattice, a novel model was established, based on a conventional trans-well model for monolayer cells (38Albini A. Iwamoto Y. Kleinman H.K. Martin G.R. Aaronson S.A. Kozlowski J.M. McEwan R.N. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3239-3245PubMed Google Scholar). Trans-well chambers (BD Biosciences) were used for cell migration and invasion experiments. The chambers consist of BD Biosciences Falcon TM TC companion 6-well plates and Falcon cell culture inserts containing 8-μm pore size transparent tracked-etched polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membranes. Non-coated cell culture inserts were used for cell migration experiments, and the chambers were termed “migration chambers.” Cell culture inserts coated with a thin layer of the Matrigel basement membrane matrix were employed in cell invasion experiments, and the chambers were termed “invasion chambers.” Before each experiment, invasion chambers were removed from –20 °C storage and allowed to come to room temperature. Warm MEM (37 °C) was added to the interior of the inserts and wells to rehydrate the Matrigel matrix for 2 h in a humidified tissue culture incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 atmosphere. After rehydration, the medium was carefully removed without disturbing the layer of Matrigel matrix on the PET membrane. When migration or invasion experiments were performed, trypsinized cardiac fibroblasts were preincubated with 50 μm furin inhibitor I (FI, decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethyl ketone, Calbiochem) for 20 min and then seeded in type I collagen solution at a density of ∼3.0 × 105 cells/ml. The final concentration of the collagen was 1 mg/ml. 800 μl of collagen lattice solution was layered over the upper surface of each cell culture insert to make a stabilized lattice. After 60 min of incubation at 37 °C to allow for polymerization of the collagen, 2.5 ml of serum-free MEM containing 10–6m angiotensin II (a known chemoattractant) (2Graf K. Neuss M. Stawowy P. Hsueh W.A. Fleck E. Law R.E. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 978-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was added to each well of the accompanying 6-well plate, and 2 ml of serum-free MEM containing 50 μm FI was placed over the collagen lattice immediately. The assembled invasion and migration chambers were incubated for 24 h in a humidified tissue culture incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 atmosphere. At the end of the incubation period, collagen lattices were removed from the upper surface of the inserts, and the surface of the insert was then gently but firmly rubbed using a cotton-tipped swab to remove all remaining cells and/or the Matrigel matrix on the PET membrane. The bottom side of the insert was then sequentially passed through PBS (pH 7.4) containing 10 mm sodium periodate, 75 mm l-lysine, and 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 2 min, 0.1% crystal violet for 2 min, and two beakers of deionized water to remove excess stain. The PET membrane was air-dried and then cut from the insert housing using the tip of a sharp scalpel blade and mounted, bottom side down, on a microscope slide. Cells on the membrane were observed under a microscope. For migration experiments, for each membrane, cells in four random microscopic fields were counted at 400× magnification (39Pauly R.R. Passaniti A. Bilato C. Monticone R. Cheng L. Papadopoulos N. Gluzband Y.A. Smith L. Weinstein C. Lakatta E.G. Crow M.T. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 41-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The mean of total cell numbers in duplicate membranes from three independent experiments using different cell populations was used for statistical comparisons. Cell Counting—To assess the effect of FI on cell numbers, confluent cardiac fibroblasts grown as a monolayer were serum-starved and then incubated in the absence or presence of variable concentrations of FI (25–100 μm) under serum-free conditions for 48 h. At the end of the incubation period, the cells were detached from culture plates by incubation with 0.25% (w/v) trypsin-EDTA for approximately 3 min. The plates were washed twice with PBS. Duplicate samples of cells were then counted using a hemocytometer. Statistics—Statistical analysis between three or more time-matched groups was performed using repeated measures analysis of variance followed by either Bonferroni post-test to compare any two groups or Dunnet's post-test to compare all treated groups versus controls. For comparisons between two time-matched groups, a paired Student's t test with two-tail p value was used. All values are presented as the means ± S.E. in n experiments as indicated. p values less than 0.05 (p < 0.05) were considered statistically significant. Cardiac Fibroblasts Embedded in Three-dimensional Type I Collagen Lattices Produce Latent and Active MMP-2 Species— Gelatinolytic activities corresponding to both latent and mature forms of MMP-2 were present in conditioned media from all three types of cardiac fibroblast-populated lattices (Fig. 1A). Cardiac fibroblasts maintained in these lattices were also associated with high gelatinolytic activities attributable to both latent and mature MMP-2 species (Fig. 1B). Identities of the pro- and active MMP-2 species were verified by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1C). In an earlier study using neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts embedded in three-dimensional type I collagen lattice (4Borg K.T. Burgess W. Terracio L. Borg T.K. Cardiovasc. Pathol. 1997; 6: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), a high level of active MMP-2 species was only detected in whole cell lysates p"
https://openalex.org/W2013820965,"SmIIIA is a new μ-conotoxin isolated recently from Conus stercusmuscarum. Although it shares several biochemical characteristics with other μ-conotoxins (the arrangement of cysteine residues and a conserved arginine believed to interact with residues near the channel pore), it has several distinctive features, including the absence of hydroxyproline, and is the first specific antagonist of tetrodotoxin-resistant voltage-gated sodium channels to be characterized. It therefore represents a potentially useful tool to investigate the functional roles of these channels. We have determined the three-dimensional structure of SmIIIA in aqueous solution. Consistent with the absence of hydroxyprolines, SmIIIA adopts a single conformation with all peptide bonds in the trans configuration. The spatial orientations of several conserved Arg and Lys side chains, including Arg14 (using a consensus numbering system), which plays a key role in sodium channel binding, are similar to those in other μ-conotoxins but the N-terminal regions differ, reflecting the trans conformation for the peptide bond preceding residue 8 in SmIIIA, as opposed to the cis conformation in μ-conotoxins GIIIA and GIIIB. Comparison of the surfaces of SmIIIA with other μ-conotoxins suggests that the affinity of SmIIIA for TTX-resistant channels is influenced by the Trp15 side chain, which is unique to SmIIIA. Arg17, which replaces Lys in the other μ-conotoxins, may also be important. Consistent with these inferences from the structure, assays of two chimeras of SmIIIA and PIIIA in which their N- and C-terminal halves were recombined, indicated that residues in the C-terminal half of SmIIIA confer affinity for tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels in the cell bodies of frog sympathetic neurons. SmIIIA and the chimera possessing the C-terminal half of SmIIIA also inhibit tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels in the postganglionic axons of sympathetic neurons, as indicated by their inhibition of C-neuron compound action potentials that persist in the presence of tetrodotoxin.

Polypeptide toxins typically interact with their target receptors with high potency and exquisite selectivity and as such are valuable tools in elucidating the physiological functions of their targets and in probing the size and shape of their cognate binding sites. Toxins from the genus Conus have been especially valuable in this respect, and, of the various classes of conotoxin that have been characterized to date (1Olivera B.M. Hillyard D.R. Marsh M.

Three families of conotoxins target VGSCs, causing either inhibition (μ- and μO-conotoxins) or delayed inactivation (δ-conotoxins), but to date a detailed understanding of their interactions with the channel has been achieved only in the case of the μ-conotoxins. These toxins bind to Site 1 on VGSCs, one of several toxin binding sites identified on these channels (3Cestele S. Catterall W.A. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). The pore-forming α-subunit of each VGSC consists of four homologous domains, each containing six putative transmembrane helices S1–S6, with the Na+ channel thought to be formed by the S5-S6 loops from all four domains (these S5-S6 linkers are further subdivided into the S5-P, P, and P-S6 loops, with the P loop containing the SS1 and SS2 segments). Site 1, located on the extracellular surface of this pore, binds the guanidinium alkaloids tetrodotoxin (TTX) and saxitoxin as well as the μ-conotoxins. Not all VGSCs, however, bind TTX. Of the nine well characterized α-subunits cloned to date from mammals (4Goldin A.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 871-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 5Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 26: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1702) Google Scholar), at least three, NaV1.5, NaV1.8, and NaV1.9, can be classified as TTX-resistant. To probe the physiological roles of these VGSCs, and indeed of the different subtypes of TTX-sensitive VGSCs, additional blockers are needed. The μ-conotoxins offer considerable promise in this respect. The first μ-conotoxin characterized, μ-conotoxin GIIIA from the fish-hunting snail Conus geographus, competes with TTX and saxitoxin for binding to Site 1 on the skeletal muscle Na+ channel (6Cruz L.J.

Han E. Toledo-Aral J.J. Olivera B.M. Brehm P. Mandel G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 76-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of the neuronal subtypes studied thus far, NaV1.1 is the most readily blocked by GIIIA, but the EC50 is still an order of magnitude higher than that for NaV1.4 (9Li R.A. Ennis I.L. Xue T. Nguyen H.M.

GIIIB, from the same species, has similar selectivity, binding preferentially to skeletal muscle over neuronal or cardiac subtypes (6Cruz L.J. Gray W.R. Olivera B.M. Zeikus R.D. Kerr L. Yoshikami D.

Another μ-conotoxin, PIIIA from the fish-hunting snail Conus purpurascens, also has a strong preference for the skeletal muscle subtype but can block other TTX-sensitive subtypes as well, albeit with lower affinity (8Safo P.

Very recently, West et al. (14West P.J. Bulaj G. Garrett J.E. Olivera B.M. Yoshikami D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15388-15393Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) described a novel μ-conotoxin, SmIIIA, from the fly speck cone snail C. stercusmuscarum, which blocked TTX-resistant VGSCs in frog sympathetic and dorsal root ganglia but had little effect on TTX-sensitive currents. SmIIIA thus represents the first specific antagonist for TTX-resistant Na+ channels. The amino acid sequence of SmIIIA is compared with those of GIIIA, GIIIB, GIIIC, and PIIIA in Fig. 1. The locations of the six half-cystines, and thus of three disulfide bridges, are conserved, as is the key residue Arg14 (using the consensus numbering of Fig. 1). The important basic residues at positions 2, 9, 17, and 21 are also conserved or conservatively substituted. On the other hand, SmIIIA lacks the hydroxyproline residues found in all other μ-conotoxins described to date, contains a Trp at position 15 in contrast to Gln or Arg, and has an atypical sequence between the fourth and fifth half-cystines. As these changes might be expected to affect the three-dimensional structure of SmIIIA we have determined its structure in solution using NMR spectroscopic data. Comparison of the structure with those of GIIIA (15Lancelin J.M. Kohda D. Tate S. Yanagawa Y. Abe T. Satake M. Inagaki F.

These inferences have been confirmed by the construction and assay of chimeras of SmIIIA and PIIIA in which the N- and C-terminal halves were recombined. Peptide Synthesis and Sample Preparation—Conotoxins SmIIIA and PIIIA and chimeras were synthesized, folded, and purified using the protocols described previously (12Shon K.J. Olivera B.M. Watkins M. Jacobsen R.B. Gray W.R. Floresca C.Z. Cruz L.J. Hillyard D.R. Brink A. Terlau H. Yoshikami D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4473-4481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14West P.J. Bulaj G. Garrett J.E. Olivera B.M. Yoshikami D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15388-15393Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The peptides were purified using C18 reversed-phase HPLC and their identities confirmed by mass spectrometry. Samples were prepared for NMR by dissolving SmIIIA in 350 μl of 95% H2O/5% 2H2O to a final concentration of ∼0.9 mm. The pH was adjusted to 4.7, but no buffer was present. pH was measured at room temperature and no allowances were made for isotope effects. NMR Spectroscopy—Two-dimensional homonuclear TOCSY spectra with a spin-lock time of 50 ms and E-COSY spectra were collected on a Bruker AMX-500 spectrometer, and NOESY spectra with mixing times of 300, 200, and 75 ms were collected on a Bruker DRX-600 spectrometer, essentially as described previously (19Miles L.A. Dy C.Y. Nielsen J. Barnham K.J. Hinds M.G. Olivera B.M. Bulaj G. Norton R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43033-43040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A 300-ms NOESY at pH 3.1 was also acquired. A series of one-dimensional spectra at 5 °C intervals were collected over the range 5–25 °C. Water was suppressed by use of the WATERGATE pulse sequence (20Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3523) Google Scholar). Backbone amide exchange was measured by dissolving the sample in 2H2O at pH 4.4 and recording a series of one-dimensional and TOCSY spectra at 5 °C. Once exchange was complete, E-COSY and a 300-ms NOESY spectra were acquired. All amide proton signals except for Cys16, Arg17, and Ser20 disappeared within 30 min, indicating that the protons were in fast exchange. The amide proton signals of Cys16 and Ser20 were still visible in a two-dimensional TOCSY acquired 4 h after 2H2O addition (Table SIII in Supplementary Material). A pH titration was performed over the range 1.5–9.5. All spectra were collected at 5 °C unless otherwise stated and were referenced to an impurity peak at 0.15 ppm or the water resonance. Spectra were processed using XWINNMR (Bruker Biospin) and analyzed using XEASY (21Bartels C. Xia T.H. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar). Chemical shift assignments for SmIIIA have been deposited in the BioMagResBank data base (22Seavey B.R. Farr E.A. Westler W.M. Markley J.L. J. Biomol. NMR. 1991; 1: 217-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Structural Constraints—SmIIIA contains three disulfide bonds linking the following pairs of half-cystines: Cys4–Cys16, Cys5–Cys22, and Cys11–Cys23. Appropriate restraints for each of these disulfides were included at each stage of the structure calculations. Distance restraints were obtained from the following spectra: 300- and 75-ms NOESY spectra at pH 4.7, 300-ms NOESY at pH 3.1, and 300-ms NOESY at pH 4.4 in 2H2O, all acquired at 600 MHz. 3JHNHα coupling constants were measured from a double quantum filtered COSY acquired at 500 MHz and then converted to dihedral restraints (3JHNHα > 8 Hz, φ = –120 ± 30°; 3JHNHα < 6 Hz, φ = –60 ± 30°). If a positive φ angle could be excluded on the basis of NOE data (23Ludvigsen S. Poulsen F.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), φ angles were restricted to the range –180 to 0°. χ1 angles were determined based on analysis of a 75-ms NOESY spectrum. Structure Calculations—Two sets of structural calculations were performed in CYANA (24Herrmann T. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). Both used a set of four peak lists derived from the NOESY spectra described above. The first set of calculations used manual assignments for each peak. Intensities for each peak were calibrated using the conventional CALIBA script supplied with CYANA. These were then scaled by a factor of 1.2 before use in structural calculations to allow for possible effects of spin diffusion. A family of 200 structures was calculated using torsion angle dynamics, and 20 structures with the lowest target function were chosen for further analysis. No dihedral violations greater than 5° or NOE violations greater than 0.2 Å were observed in this family. In addition to the traditional manual assignment of NOE cross peaks, we used the CANDID module of CYANA to assign NOE cross-peaks and calculate a structure for SmIIIA. The peak lists used for the manual assignments were supplied to CANDID and NOE assignments and structures were determined using the default scripts. The peak intensities from CANDID were equivalent to those obtained after scaling the peak intensities in the manually assigned peak lists by a factor of 1.2. Of the 1193 peaks supplied to CANDID, 1174 were assigned automatically, with the remainder being unassigned predominantly because of ambiguity among several possible assignments. Only eight of the assignments made by CANDID differed from those made manually. The backbone r.m.s.d. between structures calculated in CYANA using a manually assigned peak list and those calculated with the peak list produced by CANDID was 0.66, indicating that the methods were in excellent agreement. The final NOE and dihedral restraint lists from CYANA were then used to calculate a family of 200 structures in Xplor-NIH (25Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar) using the standard distance geometry and simulated annealing scripts. The library files supplied with Xplor-NIH were modified to include a pyroGlu residue. The lowest 30 structures in energy were chosen for further refinement. A water box was built around the molecule and then energy minimized on the basis of NOE and dihedral restraints and the geometry of bonds, angles, and impropers. A final family of 20 structures was then chosen for further analysis based on stereochemistry and energy considerations. This family has been deposited in the RCSB protein structural data base (Protein Data Base accession number 1Q2J). Structures were analyzed using the programs PROCHECK (26Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4402) Google Scholar) and MOLMOL (27Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (51–55): 29-32Crossref Scopus (6487) Google Scholar). Structural figures were prepared using MOLMOL (27Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (51–55): 29-32Crossref Scopus (6487) Google Scholar), GRASP (28Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5315) Google Scholar), and InsightII (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). Dissociated Neuron Preparation—Lumbar paravertebral ganglia 8–10 were dissected from 6–7.5-cm adult frogs (Rana pipiens) of either sex and processed as described previously (29Jones S.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1987; 389: 605-627Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 30Selyanko A.A. Smith P.A. Zidichouski J.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1990; 425: 471-500Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, ganglia were treated with collagenase followed by trypsin. Cells were mechanically dissociated by trituration, washed, and suspended in 73% Leibowitz's L15 solution (supplemented with 14 mm glucose, 1 mm CaCl2, 7% fetal bovine serum, and penicillin/streptomycin), plated on polylysine-coated coverslips, and stored at 4 °C. Whole Cell Patch Clamp Electrophysiology—Whole cell patch clamp recordings were made essentially as described previously (14West P.J. Bulaj G. Garrett J.E. Olivera B.M. Yoshikami D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15388-15393Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, sympathetic neurons were perfused with extracellular solution containing (in mm): NaCl, 117; KCl, 2; MgCl2, 2; MnCl2, 2; HEPES, 5; TEA, 10; TTX, 0.01; pH 7.2. Recording pipettes contained (in mm): NaCl, 10; CsCl, 110; MgCl2, 2; CaCl2, 0.4; EGTA, 4.4; HEPES, 5; TEA, 5; MgATP, 4; pH 7.2. These solutions inhibit voltage-gated K+, Ca2+, and TTX-sensitive Na+ currents, thereby permitting recording of TTX-resistant Na+ currents exclusively. Conotoxins were dissolved in extracellular solution and applied to neurons by bath exchange. Toxin exposures were conducted in static baths. To evoke voltage-gated TTX-resistant Na+ currents, the neuron was held at –80 mV, while 50-ms test pulses to 0 mV were applied every 10 s. Each test pulse was preceded by a –120 mV prepulse lasting 50 ms to relieve steady-state inactivation. Current signals, acquired at room temperature with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments), were filtered at 2 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz, and leak-subtracted by a P/5 protocol using in-house software written in LabVIEW (National Instruments, Austin, TX). Extracellular Electrophysiology—Extracellular recordings of compound action potentials (CAPs) in sympathetic nerves were made essentially as described previously (31Tavazoie S.F. Tavazoie M.F. McIntosh J.M. Olivera B.M. Yoshikami D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 995-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, lumbar paravertebral ganglia 8–10 and the adjoining 10th spinal nerve were dissected from 6–7.5 cm adult frogs (R. pipiens) of either sex. The recording chamber was fabricated from Sylgard and consisted of seven circular or semicircular compartments with diameters of 4–5 cm (see Fig. 4A), each separated from its neighbor by a partition about 1-mm wide. A bead of Vaseline was placed atop each partition between compartments. The chain of sympathetic ganglia and attached 10th nerve were arranged in the compartments as illustrated in Fig. 4A. Those portions draped over the Vaseline-topped partitions were covered with additional Vaseline to prevent drying and to seal compartments from each other such that the fluid in each compartment was isolated and independently maintained and electrical stimulation or recording across compartment partitions was possible. Each compartment was maintained essentially as a static bath except for the test compartment, which was perfused when it did not contain toxin. All compartments contained normal frog Ringer's solution consisting of (in mm): NaCl, 111; KCl, 2; CaCl2, 1.8; HEPES, 10; pH 7.2. Conotoxins were dissolved in this solution and applied to the test compartment by stopping its perfusion and replacing the solution with one containing toxin. During toxin exposure, the test compartment was static to conserve toxin. Platinum wire electrodes were used to convey supramaximal stimuli to the preganglionic sympathetic chain between the 8th and 9th ganglia and to record postganglionic CAPs in the 10th spinal nerve. Stimuli (0.1–1-ms rectangular voltage pulses) were provided by a stimulator (S-88, Grass Instruments) through a stimulus isolation unit. Recordings were made using a differential A/C preamplifier (P-55, Grass Instruments, with bandpass filter settings of 1 Hz and 1 kHz). All experiments were performed at room temperature. NMR Spectroscopy—Broad NH chemical shift dispersion in one-dimensional spectra indicated that SmIIIA was well structured, and two-dimensional homonuclear spectra recorded at 5, 15, and 25 °C showed that only one conformation was present in aqueous solution at these temperatures. Sequence-specific resonance assignments for backbone and side-chain protons in SmIIIA were made at 500 and 600 MHz using standard two-dimensional homonuclear NMR experiments. Assignments at pH 4.7 and 3.1 are tabulated in Supplementary Material and have been deposited with BioMagResBank (22Seavey B.R. Farr E.A. Westler W.M. Markley J.L. J. Biomol. NMR. 1991; 1: 217-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) with accession number 5881. Distance constraints were taken from the volumes of NOE cross-peaks in NOESY spectra acquired at 5 °Cat 600 MHz. NMR Assessment of Hydrogen Bonds—The temperature dependence of each amide proton chemical shift was determined to probe for hydrogen bonding. The amide protons of Cys5, Gly10, Cys11, Cys16, Arg17, His19, Ser20, and Cys23 exhibited temperature coefficients of magnitude ≤4 ppb/°C (see Supplementary Material), consistent with their possible involvement in hydrogen bonds (32Baxter N.J. Williamson M.P. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). However, amide exchange experiments conducted at 5 °C and pH 4.4 indicated that all amide protons, except for those of Cys16 and Ser20, exchanged with solvent deuterium within minutes of dissolution of the polypeptide in 2H2O. Amide protons from these residues were apparent in NMR spectra for several hours following dissolution. Because even the most slowly exchanging amides in SmIIIA exchanged relatively quickly, no hydrogen bonds were used as distance constraints in the structure calculations. Solution Structure—Parameters characterizing the final 20 structures of SmIIIA and structural statistics are summarized in Table I, and stereo views of the structures superimposed over the backbone are shown in Fig. 2. Inspection of Table I indicates that the final 20 structures fit well with experimentally derived distance and angle constraints and are well defined over the entire length of the polypeptide. The structures of SmIIIA have been deposited with the RSCB Protein Data Bank (accession number 1Q2J) (33Berman H.M. Battistuz T. Bhat T.N. Bluhm W.F. Bourne P.E. Burkhardt K. Feng Z. Gilliland G.L.

Open table in a new tab The angular order parameters, S, for the backbone φ and ψ angles and the side-chain χ1 angles of SmIIIA are presented in Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Material. The φ and ψ angles are well ordered (Sφ,ψ > 0.9) for all residues except Arg8, for which Sψ is 0.82, indicating that the structure is well defined. Of the three disulfide bridges in SmIIIA, two, Cys4–Cys16 and Cys5–Cys22 have a left-handed (χSS –90°) configuration and Cys11–Cys23 is right-handed (χSS +90°). In the N-terminal region of SmIIIA the pattern of NOEs and hydrogen bonds is consistent with a series of turns, including an inverse γ-turn at Cys4 and a γ-turn at Gly10. There is no evidence of the β-hairpin seen in the N-terminal region of GIIIB (18Hill J.M. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8824-8835Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2056010798,"Tonicity-responsive enhancer binding protein (TonEBP), also known as NFAT5, belongs to the Rel family of transcriptional activators. In the kidney medulla and thymus, TonEBP plays a major role in protecting renal cells and T cells from the deleterious effects of ambient hypertonicity. TonEBP is stimulated by hypertonicity via several pathways: increased expression of protein, nuclear translocation, and increased transactivation. In this study, we identified five domains of TonEBP involved in transactivation. The two conserved glutamine repeats were not involved in transactivation. There were three activation domains that could stimulate transcription independently. In addition, there were two modulation domains that potentiated the activity of the activation domains. One of the activation domains is unique to a splice isoform that is more active than others, indicating that alternative splicing can affect the activity of TonEBP. Another activation domain and one of the modulation domains were stimulated by hypertonicity. All the five domains acted in synergy in every combination. Although overall phosphorylation of TonEBP increased in response to hypertonicity, phosphorylation of the activation and modulation domains did not increase in isolation. In sum, TonEBP possesses far more elaborate domains involved in transactivation compared with other Rel proteins.

In this study, we identified five domains of TonEBP involved in transactivation. The two conserved glutamine repeats were not involved in transactivation. There were three activation domains that could stimulate transcription independently. In addition, there were two modulation domains that potentiated the activity of the activation domains. One of the activation domains is unique to a splice isoform that is more active than others, indicating that alternative splicing can affect the activity of TonEBP. Another activation domain and one of the modulation domains were stimulated by hypertonicity. All the five domains acted in synergy in every combination. Although overall phosphorylation of TonEBP increased in response to hypertonicity, phosphorylation of the activation and modulation domains did not increase in isolation. In sum, TonEBP possesses far more elaborate domains involved in transactivation compared with other Rel proteins.

Woo S.K. Dahl S.C. Handler J.H. Kwon H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2538-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar) is a member of the Rel family of transcriptional activators that include NFκB and NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells). The Rel family is defined based on structural similarity in the Rel-homology domain (RHD) that binds DNA. The RHD of TonEBP shares ∼43% of amino acids with those of NFAT isoforms. On this basis, TonEBP is also called NFAT5 (2López-Rodríguez C. Aramburu J. Rakeman A.S. Rao A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7214-7219Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the RHD of TonEBP forms a dimer like the RHD of NFκB, even though they share minimal amino acid identities, i.e. <20% (3Stroud J.C. López-Rodríguez C. Rao A. Chen L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). tonicity-responsive enhancer TonE binding protein nuclear factor of activated T cells Rel-homology domain activation domain modulation domain GAL4 DNA binding domain. Analyses of genome databases reveal that the Rel proteins first appeared in invertebrates such as Drosophila (4Graef I.A. Gastier J.M. Francke U. Crabtree G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5740-5745Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). There are several NFκB members and a homolog of TonEBP named MSER1 in the Drosophila genome (5Huang A.M. Rubin G.M. Genetics. 2000; 156: 1219-1230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MSER1 seems to be the ortholog of TonEBP because its RHD displays higher homology to the RHD of TonEBP than NFAT, and it has two glutamine repeats like TonEBP. Based on analyses of exon structures of the Rel proteins, it has been suggested that TonEBP is the direct evolutionary ancestor of the NFAT subfamily that exists only in vertebrates (4Graef I.A. Gastier J.M. Francke U. Crabtree G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5740-5745Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). TonEBP was initially cloned from the kidney medulla as a transcriptional activator that stimulates genes in response to ambient hypertonicity, i.e. hyperosmotic salt (1Miyakawa H. Woo S.K. Dahl S.C. Handler J.H. Kwon H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2538-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Osmolality of the mammalian kidney medulla is very high, often 10 times that of the blood or higher, because of high concentrations of salt and urea. The hyperosmolality provides the driving force for water reabsorption and urinary concentration and, thereby, contributes to maintenance of the body fluid volume and blood pressure (6Sands J.M. Layton H.E. Seldin D.W. Giebisch G. The Kidney. 3rd Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, MD2000: 1175-1216Google Scholar). Because of the hypertonicity, TonEBP activity in the kidney medulla is high (7Cha J.H. Woo S.K. Han K.H. Kim Y.H. Handler J.S. Kim J. Kwon H.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 2221-2230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By stimulating its target genes, TonEBP contributes to the function of the kidney medulla. TonEBP enhances expression of the vasopressin-regulated urea transporter, a key molecule in the generation of the high urea concentration in the kidney medulla (8Nakayama Y. Peng T. Sands J.M. Bagnasco S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38275-38280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the hyperosmolality imposes a great deal of stress to cells, causing double-stranded DNA breaks (9Kültz D. Chakravarty D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1999-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and cell death (10Michea L. Ferguson D.R. Peters E.M. Andrews P.M. Kirby M.R. Burg M.B. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2000; 278: F209-F218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TonEBP also plays a major role in the protection of cells in the kidney medulla in two ways (see Ref. 11Woo S.K. Lee S.D. Kwon H.M. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2002; 444: 579-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar for a recent review). First, TonEBP stimulates several genes to encode plasma membrane transporters and aldose reductase that catalyze the cellular accumulation of organic osmolytes. Organic osmolytes protect cells from the deleterious effects of hypertonicity by lowering the intracellular ionic strength. Second, TonEBP stimulates expression of heat shock protein 70 that protects cells from the deleterious effects of high urea (12Woo S.K. Lee S.D. Na K.Y. Park W.K. Kwon H.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5753-5760Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). TonEBP is abundantly expressed throughout development (13Maouyo D. Kim J.Y. Lee S.D. Wu Y. Woo S.K. Kwon H.M. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 282: F802-F809Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and in many adult tissues outside the kidney such as brain, heart, and thymus (14Trama J. Lu Q. Hawley R.G. Ho S.N. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4884-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The function of TonEBP is understood in the thymus. T cell receptor activation leads to an increased TonEBP expression in T cells (14Trama J. Lu Q. Hawley R.G. Ho S.N. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4884-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). When TonEBP activity is inhibited in the thymus, the number of T cells decreases (15Trama J. Go W.Y. Ho S.N. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5477-5488Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It appears that the osmoprotective function of TonEBP is required for proliferation/survival of T cells in the thymus. In mature T cells, TonEBP stimulates the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α and lymphotoxin β (16López-Rodríguez C. Aramburu J. Jin L. Rakeman A.S. Michino M. Rao A. Immunity. 2001; 15: 47-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The function of TonEBP in other organs is unknown, except that TonEBP seems to participate in the integrin-mediated carcinoma invasion (17Jauliac S. López-Rodríguez C. Shaw L.M. Brown L.F. Rao A. Toker A. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2002; 4: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, recessive lethal mutations of MSER1 have been reported (18Bourbon H.-M. Gonzy-Treboul G. Peronnet F. Alin M.-F. Ardourel C. Benassayag C. Cribbs D. Deutsch J. Ferrer P. Haenlin M. Lepesant J.-A Noselli S. Vincent A. Mech. Dev. 2002; 110: 71-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Overexpression of MSER1 resulted in the suppression of RAS signaling (5Huang A.M. Rubin G.M. Genetics. 2000; 156: 1219-1230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and axon guidance/synaptogenesis phenotypes (19Kraut R. Menon K. Zinn K. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 417-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). How TonEBP is stimulated by hypertonicity is of great interest. This involves increased TonEBP abundance caused by increased transcription (20Woo S.K. Dahl S.C. Handler J.S. Kwon H.M. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2000; 278: F1006-F1012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), nuclear translocation (21Dahl S.C. Handler J.S. Kwon H.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C248-C253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Woo S.K. Maouyo D. Handler J.S. Kwon H.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 278: C323-C330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and increased transactivation (23Ferraris J.D. Williams C.K. Persaud P. Zhang Z. Chen Y. Burg M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 739-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Although phosphorylation of TonEBP is increased by hypertonicity (21Dahl S.C. Handler J.S. Kwon H.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C248-C253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the role of phosphorylation in the stimulation of TonEBP is not known. Recent studies implicated the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, Fyn (24Ko B.C.B. Lam A.K.M. Kapus A. Fan L. Chung S.K. Chung S.S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46085-46092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and protein kinase A (25Ferraris J.D. Persaud P. Williams C.K. Chen Y. Burg M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16800-16805Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) in transactivation. In this study, we defined five domains of TonEBP involved in transactivation. Our data do not provide evidence that stimulation of TonEBP transactivation involves phosphorylation of TonEBP. DNA Constructs—All constructs were generated by using standard cloning procedures and verified by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. Each TonEBP cDNA fragment was generated by PCR or by using restriction enzymes and cloned into pCMV-Tag or pFA-CMV (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which allows the expression of TonEBP fragments fused with the GAL4 DNA binding domain (GAL4DBD). Where indicated (see Fig. 3), the polyglutamine repeats were deleted by using two independent PCRs, which led to the insertion of glycine and serine in place of the glutamines. Serial deletion mutants from the C terminus of 618–1531 fragments were made by using the Erase-a-Base System (Promega, Madison, WI) Cell Culture and Transfection—COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products, Woodland, CA), 100 unit/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). COS7 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 as instructed by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). To examine the effects of protein kinase inhibitors (see “Discussion”), NIH3T3 cells were maintained in the same conditions as COS7 cells except that bovine calf serum (Invitrogen) was used and FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science) was used for transfection, as reported earlier (24Ko B.C.B.

Luciferase Assay—Cells grown in each well of a 24-well cluster were transfected with 0.2 μg of GAL4 upstream activation sequence-driven photinus luciferase expression construct (pFR-Luc), 0.2 μg of pFA-CMV plasmids directing expression of the TonEBP fragments in fusion with GAL4DBD, and 2 ng of pRL-CMV (Promega) directing renilla luciferase expression driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. In some experiments (see Figs. 6C and D and 10), TonE-driven photinus luciferase expression construct (1Miyakawa H. Woo S.K. Dahl S.C. Handler J.H. Kwon H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2538-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar) and pCMV-Tag plasmids directing expression of myc- or FLAG-tagged TonEBP fragments were used. The cells were cultured for 20 h, and then some of the wells were switched to hypertonic medium made by the addition of 100 mm NaCl. Activity of luciferase was measured 4 h or 20 h later from cell lysates using a commercial kit, Dual-Luciferase Assay System (Promega). For each extract, activity of the photinus luciferase was divided by the activity of the renilla luciferase to correct for transfection efficiency.Fig. 10Phosphorylation of TonEBP. Full-length or C-terminally deleted TonEBP was fused to FLAG and transfected into COS7 cells. A, the FLAG-TonEBP constructs were cotransfected with a TonE-driven luciferase reporter gene into COS7 cells. The transfected cells were switched for 4 h to hypertonic (Hyp) or kept in isotonic medium (Iso). Expression of luciferase activity is shown. Mean ± S.E., n = 3. B, cells were transfected as above and then labeled for 4 h in isotonic (I) or hypertonic (H) medium containing [32P]orthophosphate. FLAG fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibody and resolved on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Autoradiogram (32P) and immunoblot (IB) probed with anti-FLAG antibody are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Immunoblot Analysis—To detect the expression of the fusion proteins, immunoblot analysis was performed on cells transfected as described above. To prepare whole cell extracts, cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. The extracts were then cleared by centrifugation for 5 min at 15,000 × g. Whole cell extracts were separated on a 4–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tween-Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 30 min at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated with 1:200 dilution of anti-GAL4DBD antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies Inc, Santa Cruz, CA), 1:2,000 dilution of anti-FLAG M5 (Sigma), or anti-myc antibody (Covance, Richmond, CA) in the blocking solution for 60 min at room temperature. To detect the antibody binding, the membrane was incubated with 1:5,000 dilution of anti-mouse IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Alkaline phosphatase was visualized by using a commercial kit (Sigma). Phosphorylation—COS7 cells grown in a 60-mm dish were transfected with 6 μg of a GAL4DBD-fusion plasmid or FLAG-TonEBP and cultured for 20 h. Cells were labeled in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 120 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 4 h in isotonic or hypertonic conditions. Cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and whole cell extracts were prepared as described above. Cleared whole cell extract containing 1 mg of protein was incubated with 30 μl of agarose-conjugated anti-GAL4DBD antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies Inc) or anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) for 60 min at 4 °C to immunoprecipitate GAL4DBD fusion proteins or FLAG fusion proteins. The immune complexes were washed four times in lysis buffer, resuspended in 20 μl of sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol), and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. The samples were separated on a 6% or 4–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Radioactivity was visualized and quantified by using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Isoform-specific Activation Domain (AD)—Because of alternative splicing in exons 2–4, there are 4 forms of mouse TonEBP named the a-, b-, c-, and d-forms (13Maouyo D. Kim J.Y. Lee S.D. Wu Y. Woo S.K. Kwon H.M. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 282: F802-F809Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The b-, c-, and d-forms have an additional 52, 76, and 94 amino acids, respectively, at the N terminus of the a-form, which is the shortest. In various human cells, we have found the a-, c-, and d-forms but not the b-form of TonEBP (not shown). The c-form of TonEBP is more active in the stimulation of transcription than the a-form (13Maouyo D. Kim J.Y. Lee S.D. Wu Y. Woo S.K. Kwon H.M. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 282: F802-F809Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We suspected that there might be an additional transactivation domain in the N-terminal 76 amino acids of TonEBP-c. With this in mind, we decided to search the entire TonEBP-c for domains involved in transactivation by fusing TonEBP fragments with the GAL4DBD, as shown in Fig. 1A. Three of the four TonEBP fusions stimulated transcription of the reporter gene by virtue of their binding to the GAL4 binding sites upstream (Fig. 1C). The C-terminal fragment, amino acids 1044–1531, was most active, whereas the N-terminal fragment, amino acids 1–548, was least active. The lack of activity by the 406–876 fragment was not due to low level of expression. When the expression of the fusion protein was increased up to 4 times by increasing the amount of the expression vector, expression of luciferase was not affected (not shown). In several other fusion constructs tested, variations in the level of expression (up to 4-fold) did not influence their transcriptional activity (measured by expression of luciferase, not shown). Activity of transfected TonEBP isoforms was also independent of its level of expression in COS7 cells (13Maouyo D. Kim J.Y. Lee S.D. Wu Y. Woo S.K. Kwon H.M. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 282: F802-F809Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the experimental conditions used in this study, it seems that the constructs expressed at levels above the functionally maximum point. We examined the N-terminal fragment to locate precisely the region responsible for transactivation. As shown in Fig. 2B, the TonEBP fragment containing amino acids 1–76 or 1–171 was active, whereas other fragments devoid of the N-terminal 76 amino acids were inactive. These data indicate that the N-terminal 76 amino acids contain a transactivation domain. This domain is AD1 (see Fig. 5). Because AD1 is unique to TonEBP-c, it should be at least partially responsible for the higher activity of TonEBP-c compared with TonEBP-a (13Maouyo D. Kim J.Y. Lee S.D. Wu Y. Woo S.K. Kwon H.M. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 282: F802-F809Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).Fig. 5Schematic representation of activation domains (white boxes: AD1, AD2, and AD3) and modulation domains (striped boxes: MD1 and MD2) of TonEBP.AD1, amino acids 1–76 (nucleotides 319–546 of KIAA0827 cDNA; GenBank accession no. AB020634); AD2, amino acids 1039–1249 (nucleotides 3433–4065); AD3, amino acids 1363–1476 (nucleotides 4405–4746). MD1, amino acids 618–820 (nucleotides 2170–2778); MD2, amino acids 889–955 (nucleotides 2983–3183). Activity of MD1 and AD2 is stimulated by hypertonicity (see text for details).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The Glutamine Repeats of TonEBP Do Not Stimulate Transcription—In human or mouse TonEBP, there are two glutamine repeats in the C terminus (Fig. 1A). MSER1, the Drosophila homolog of TonEBP, also contains two glutamine repeats (5Huang A.M. Rubin G.M. Genetics. 2000; 156: 1219-1230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because 10 or more repeats of glutamines were known to stimulate transcription (26Gerber H.P. Seipel K. Georgiev O. Höfferer M. Hug M. Rusconi S. Chaffner W. Science. 1994; 263: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), we asked whether the glutamine repeats in TonEBP were responsible for the transactivation by the C-terminal fragments (Fig. 1). Deletion of either the glutamine repeats did not affect the activity of the C-terminal fragments (Fig. 3). Thus, the evolutionarily conserved glutamine repeats are not involved in transactivation. Although glutamine repeats also play a role in protein-protein interaction (27Stott K. Blackburn J.M. Buttler P.J.G. Perutz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6509-6513Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), they are not involved in the dimerization of TonEBP (28Lee S.D. Woo S.K. Kwon H.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com. 2002; 294: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The function of the glutamine repeats of TonEBP remains unknown. Activation Domains 2 and 3; AD2 Is Stimulated by Hypertonicity—The two overlapping C-terminal fragments of TonEBP shown in Fig. 1 displayed far greater activity than the N-terminal fragments, and their activity was stimulated by hypertonicity. A larger C-terminal fragment with amino acids 618–1531 of TonEBP that covers the two C-terminal fragments displayed tonicity-responsive transactivation as expected (Fig. 4). To define domains of transactivation within the 618–1531 region, serial deletions were made from the C terminus (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, there were two large peaks and a small peak (Fig. 4B, Inset) of activity. From these and other data shown below, we concluded that the large peaks represented activation domains (AD2 in amino acids 1039–1249 rather than 1039–1276 because of the glutamine repeats in 1250–1266, and AD3 in amino acids 1364–1476), and the small peak was due to modulation domains (see below), as summarized in Fig. 5. Deletion of AD2 or AD3 from the GAL4DBD-TonEBP fusion (Fig. 6B) or TonEBP itself (Fig. 6D) led to a decrease in transcription. When AD2 or AD3 was isolated, on the other hand, it stimulated transcription (Fig. 6F) like AD1 (Fig. 2). The three activation domains displayed remarkable synergy in all possible combinations (Fig. 7). Of interest, AD2, but not AD1 or AD3, was stimulated by hypertonicity in COS7 cells (see also Figs. 1 and 6F). When AD2 was combined with AD1 or AD3, the response to hypertonicity was maintained. When AD1 and AD3 were combined without AD2, the response to hypertonicity was not observed. We conclude that TonEBP contains three domains, AD1, AD2, and AD3, that stimulate transcription. They act synergistically, and only AD2 is stimulated by hypertonicity in COS7 cells (see below for more). Modulation Domains (MD) 1 and 2; MD1 Is Stimulated by Hypertonicity—When the AD1, AD2, and AD3 were combined (Fig. 7, AD123), their activity was significantly lower than the TonEBP fragment 618–1531 (Figs. 4B and 6B), indicating that other domains were required for full activity. We noticed that the 618–955 fragment stimulated transcription (small peak in Fig. 4B, Inset), and that this activity was stimulated by hypertonicity. Because the 618–820 fragment (Fig. 4B, Inset), the 406–876 fragment (Fig. 1C), and the glutamine repeats at 879–888 (Fig. 3) were not active, we examined the fragment 889–955 named MD2. Unexpectedly, this fragment was not active (Fig. 6F), hence the name modulation domain rather than activation domain. When MD2 was deleted from the GAL4DBD-TonEBP fusion (Fig. 6B) or TonEBP itself (Fig. 6D), transcriptional activity decreased as in the deletion of either AD2 or AD3. When fused to the activation domains, MD2 enhanced their activity dramatically (Fig. 8D). Thus, MD2 does not stimulate transcription by itself, but it potentiates the activity of the activation domains. To identify the source of the hypertonicity-inducible activity of the 618–955 fragment (Fig. 4B, Inset), we examined the fragment 618–820 (MD1) further. Like MD2, MD1 dramatically potentiates activity of all of the activation domains, whereas MD1 itself is not active in the stimulation of transcription (Fig. 8B). Furthermore, MD1 made AD1 and AD3 responsive to hypertonicity and increased the responsiveness of AD2 to hypertonicity. We suggest that MD1 is responsible for the hypertonicity responsiveness of the AD2-deleted 618–1531 construct (Fig. 6B, ΔMD2). This is further supported by the observation that the 618–1531 construct was stimulated by hypertonicity even when amino acids 821–1249 (i.e. MD2 and AD2) were deleted (not shown). In summary, MD1 or MD2 is inactive in transactivation unless both are fused together. They potentiate the activity of AD1, AD2, and AD3. In addition, MD1 renders AD1 and AD3 responsive to hypertonicity and increases the responsiveness of AD2 (Fig. 8). Phosphorylation Does Not Correlate with the Stimulation of Transcription in Response to Hypertonicity—To explore the potential role of phosphorylation in the hypertonicity-induced transactivation, we examined phosphorylation of the GAL4DBD-TonEBP fragment fusions shown in Fig. 1. Although the active fusion proteins were phosphorylated in isotonic conditions, the level of phosphorylation did not change in response to hypertonicity even in the two C-terminal TonEBP fragments (amino acids 733–1204 and 1044–1531; Fig. 9A) whose activity was tonicity-responsive (Fig. 1). On the other hand, we noticed that phosphorylation of the larger fusion protein containing amino acids 618–1531 of TonEBP increased dramatically in response to hypertonicity (Fig. 9A). To define the regions involved in the tonicity-responsive phosphorylation, we examined phosphorylation of the C-terminal deletion constructs shown in Fig. 4. The hypertonicity-induced phosphorylation disappeared completely when amino acids were deleted to 1233 (Fig. 9B), even though all the fusion constructs displayed hypertonicity-induced transactivation (Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained when the C-terminal deletions were made from TonEBP without the GAL4DBD fusion (Fig. 10). Thus, in the various TonEBP deletion constructs, the level of phosphorylation did not correlate with transactivation. It is possible that phosphorylation of critical residues may be a very small portion of the total phosphorylation because there are 327 serines and threonines plus 15 tyrosines in the c-form of TonEBP. If this is the case, it might be easier to detect the hypertonicity-responsive phosphorylation in smaller TonEBP constructs. The smallest functional constructs, i.e. the GAL4DBD fusions to AD1, AD2, and AD3 (Fig. 7), were examined for phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 9C, phosphorylation of these proteins (including the GAL4DBD-AD2, which displayed hypertonicity-induced transactivation) did not increase in hypertonicity. In sum, we have not found evidence that hypertonicity-induced phosphorylation of TonEBP plays a role in the stimulation of transactivation. Collectively the data demonstrate that multiple domains of TonEBP cooperate to stimulate transcription. Three activation domains, AD1, AD2, and AD3, are distinguished from the two modulation domains, MD1 and MD2, by virtue of their ability to stimulate transcription independently. On the other hand, both activation domains and modulation domains are synergistic in all combinations tested (Figs. 4, 6, 7, 8). The amino acid sequence of these domains does not resemble any of the known motifs in current databases. Although 21% of amino acids in TonEBP are serines and threonines, 19–28% of amino acids of the activation and modulation domains are serines and threonines. AD1 is enriched with proline (12%) and acidic residues (13%). The tonicity-responsive AD2 and MD1 have more glutamine residues (22 and 19% of the amino acid residues, respectively) than the whole TonEBP (14%), AD1 (2.6%), AD3 (18%), or MD2 (16%). This is generally in line with the three classical types of transactivation domains: acidic, proline-rich, and glutamine-rich (29Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). Transactivation domains of the NFAT family have been characterized mainly in NFAT1. Of the two domains, one is in the N-terminal ∼100 residues, which is rich in acidic residues and proline (30Luo C. Burgeon E. Rao A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 8907-8912Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Corresponding regions in other members of the NFAT family are also rich in acidic residues and proline, suggesting that they are also transactivation domains. The other transactivation domain of NFAT1 is located C-terminal to the DNA binding domain (31Luo C. Burgeon E. Carew J.A. Badalian T.M. MacCaffrey P.G. Lane W.S. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3955-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether other members also have C-terminal transactivation domains. More information is available for transactivation of the NFκB family. In the NFκB p65/p50 heterodimer, the transactivation domain is found only in the p65 subunit at the C terminus (32Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3805-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). This domain stimulates transcription by means of interacting with transcriptional coactivators CBP/p300. Of interest, this pathway is regulated by protein kinases. Phosphorylation of the p65 subunit at Ser-276 by protein kinase A enhances transactivation because the phosphorylated Ser-276 binds CBP/p300 independently of the transactivation domain, creating a stronger bivalent interaction (33Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). The cyclin-dependent kinase 2 that is associated with p300 inhibits the transactivation by p65 (34Perkins N. Felzien L.K. Betts J.C. Leung K. Beach D.H. Nabel G.J. Science. 1997; 275: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). When a cell is exposed to hypertonicity, a number of protein kinases including p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and Fyn are activated (35Nahm O. Woo S.K. Handler J.S. Kwon H.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 282: C49-C58Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, our data do not provide support for a model in which protein kinases directly phosphorylate TonEBP and, as a result, influence its transactivation. In many of the truncated constructs of TonEBP, increased transactivation is not associated with increased phosphorylation (Figs. 9 and 10). Stimulation of AD2 by hypertonicity is not accompanied by an increase in phosphorylation of AD2 itself (Fig. 9C). As AD2 contains 44 serines and threonines, however, we cannot exclude the possibility of increased phosphorylation in a small number of residues that would not be detectable with the method used. On the other hand, unlike the previous report (24Ko B.C.B. Lam A.K.M. Kapus A. Fan L. Chung S.K. Chung S.S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46085-46092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), we did not observe consistent inhibition of transactivation by inhibitors of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and Fyn (not shown). Even though we found that H89, an inhibitor of protein kinase A, consistently inhibited the activation domains in hypertonic conditions (not shown) as reported (25Ferraris J.D. Persaud P. Williams C.K. Chen Y. Burg M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16800-16805Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), its effects seemed to be indirect, because AD1 that was not activated by hypertonicity was also inhibited by it (not shown). The role of increased phosphorylation of TonEBP in transactivation is unknown. We conclude that transactivation of TonEBP is mediated by five discrete domains distributed throughout the TonEBP molecule. Thus, TonEBP displays far more elaborate transactivation domains compared with the other Rel proteins, NFκB and NFAT. All of the domains cooperate to stimulate transcription. Stimulation of transactivation by TonEBP in response to hypertonicity is mediated by two of the domains, AD2 and MD1. The data do not provide evidence that TonEBP is a direct substrate of the tonicity-responsive protein kinases. The domains provide tools to investigate mechanisms involved in transactivation by TonEBP."

Yakel J.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 447-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To date two 5-HT3 receptor subunits have been identified: 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B (2Maricq A.V. Peterson A.S. Brake A.J. Myers R.M. Julius D. Science. 1991; 254: 432-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar, 3Davies P.A. Pistis M. Hanna M.C. Peters J.A. Lambert J.J. Hales T.G. Kirkness E.F. Nature. 1999; 397: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The 5-HT3A receptor subunits can form functional channels homomerically (2Maricq A.V. Peterson A.S. Brake A.J. Myers R.M. Julius D. Science. 1991; 254: 432-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar), whereas the 5-HT3B receptor subunits are nonfunctional when expressed alone (3Davies P.A. Pistis M. Hanna M.C. Peters J.A. Lambert J.J. Hales T.G. Kirkness E.F. Nature. 1999; 397: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). However, the 5-HT3B receptor subunits can form heteromeric channels with the 5-HT3A receptor subunits, which results in modified biophysical characteristics compared with homomerically expressed 5-HT3A receptor subunits (3Davies P.A. Pistis M. Hanna M.C. Peters J.A. Lambert J.J. Hales T.G. Kirkness E.F. Nature. 1999; 397: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B receptor subunits also have different distribution patterns in the nervous system. The 5-HT3A receptor subunits are expressed in both central and peripheral neurons, whereas the 5-HT3B receptor subunits are restricted to peripheral neurons (4Morales M. Wang S.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6732-6741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that homomeric 5-HT3A receptors play a dominant role in 5-HT3 receptor-mediated responses in the central nervous system. serotonin type 3 acetylcholine transmembrane domain 2-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine human embryonic kidney cells wild type. serotonin type 3 acetylcholine transmembrane domain 2-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine human embryonic kidney cells wild type. 5-HT3 receptors belong to a superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels, which includes nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) receptors, glycine receptors, and γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (5Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1231-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). The subunits in this superfamily are thought to assemble as pentamers with each subunit containing a large extracellular N-terminal domain, four transmembrane domains (TM1-TM4), a large intracellular loop between TM3 and TM4, and an extracellular C-terminal domain (Fig. 1A) (6Karlin A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). The agonist binding sites are thought to be located in the N-terminal domain at subunit-subunit interfaces, and the lining of the ion channel is believed to be formed by the second transmembrane (TM2) domain (6Karlin A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). The binding of agonist to the binding sites in the N-terminal domain presumably results in a conformational change of the channel protein, which is then transduced to the TM2 domain to result in channel opening. A number of studies have been carried out to determine the sequence elements involved in agonist binding and channel gating of 5-HT3A receptors (7Yakel J.L. Lagrutta A. Adelman J.P. North R.A. Proc.

However, the mechanisms that transduce the binding of agonist to the opening of the channel are still poorly understood. Understanding the function of ligand-gated ion channels at the molecular level requires understanding how agonist binding to the receptor is converted to channel opening. Arginine (Arg) 222 is of particular interest because it is located at the distal end of the extracellular N-terminal domain, immediately adjacent to the first transmembrane (TM1) domain (Fig. 1A), and thus, it is between the presumed agonist binding sites in the N-terminal domain and TM2. Sequence alignments reveal that Arg-222 of the mouse 5-HT3A receptor is conserved in all of 5-HT3A receptors and α7-nACh receptors that have been cloned from various species (Fig. 1B). Moreover, some mutations at Arg-222 can alter the sensitivity of 5-HT3A receptors to agonists and produce channels that open spontaneously (14Zhang L. Hosoi M. Fukuzawa M. Sun H. Rawlings R.R. Weight F.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46256-46264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In an attempt to understand the role of Arg-222 in the function of 5-HT3A receptors, we replaced the arginine residue with an alanine using site-directed mutagenesis. The wild-type and R222A 5-HT3A receptors were transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, and the functional properties of the receptors were studied using the whole-cell patch clamp recording technique in combination with fast solution exchange. The results suggest that Arg-222 is involved in transducing the signal that couples agonist binding to channel opening in 5-HT3A receptors. Mutagenesis—Point mutation of the mouse 5-HT3A receptor was accomplished using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutation was verified by double strand DNA sequencing using an ABI Prism 377 automatic DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The cDNAs were then subcloned into the vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) for expression in HEK 293 cells. Cell Culture and Transient Receptor Expression—HEK 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown in minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% horse serum and maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with the wild-type or R222A 5-HT3A receptor cDNA using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Green fluorescent protein (pGreen Lantern, Invitrogen) was co-expressed with the 5-HT3A receptor subunits to permit selection of transfected cells under fluorescence optics. Patch Clamp Recording—HEK 293 cells were recorded 1–3 days after transfection. Cells were continuously superfused with a solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 5mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH; ∼340 mosmol with sucrose). Membrane current was recorded in the whole-cell configuration (15Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15065) Google Scholar) using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) at 20–22 °C. Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (TW-150F, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) using a two-stage puller (Flaming-Brown P-87; Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) and had resistances of ∼5 megaohms when filled with pipette solution containing 140 mm CsCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2 with CsOH; ∼315 mosmol with sucrose). Cells were held at –60 mV unless otherwise indicated. Data were acquired using pClamp8.0 software (Axon). Currents were filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 2–10 kHz. Agonists were applied with a piezoelectric device (PZ-150M; EXFO Burleigh Products Group Inc., Victor, NY) through two-barrel θ glass tubing (TGC150, Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) that had been pulled to a tip diameter of ∼200 μm. The piezoelectric device was driven by transistor-transistor logic pulses from pClamp 8.0 software. Voltage applied to the piezoelectric device produced a rapid lateral displacement of the θ tubing to move the interface between control and agonist solutions. Solution exchange rate was estimated using the potential change induced by switching from the control solution to a 140 mmN-methyl-d-glucamine test solution. The solution exchange time constants were ∼0.3 ms for an open pipette tip and ∼1.6 ms for whole-cell recording. Data Analysis—Average data are presented as means ± S.E. unless noted otherwise. Data analysis and curve fitting were performed with Origin 6.0 (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA), pClamp 8.0 (Axon), Statistica 5.5 (StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK), or GraphPad InStat 3.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) software. Concentration-response curves were fitted by the Hill equation, I/IMAX = 1/[1 + (EC50/[agonist])n], where I is the current amplitude activated by a given concentration of agonist ([agonist]), IMAX is the maximum response of the cell, n is the Hill slope, and EC50 is the concentration eliciting a half-maximal response. The time constants for activation, deactivation, and desensitization were determined with Levenberg-Marquardt algorithms. Functional Characterization of the Wild-type and Mutant (R222A) 5-HT3A Receptors—The wild-type and R222A 5-HT3A receptors were transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells, and their responses to the full agonist, 5-HT, or the partial agonist, 2-Me-5-HT, were recorded in the whole-cell configuration with fast solution exchange. Typical responses activated by these agonists are shown in Fig. 2, A and B. At a holding potential of –60 mV, application of a maximally efficacious concentration of the full agonist, 5-HT (30 μm), induced a rapidly activating inward current in both the wild-type (Fig. 2A, left) and R222A (Fig. 2B, left) receptors. Application of a maximally efficacious concentration of the partial agonist, 2-Me-5-HT (100 μm), activated the wild-type receptor more slowly compared with the response activated by 30 μm 5-HT (Fig. 2A, right). By contrast, the R222A mutation resulted in a more rapidly activating response to 2-Me-5-HT (Fig. 2B, right). In addition, in the wild-type receptor the current activated by 100 μm 2-Me-5-HT was much smaller in amplitude than the current activated by 30 μm 5-HT (Fig. 2A), whereas in the R222A mutant receptor the current activated by 100 μm 2-Me-5-HT was similar in amplitude to that activated by 30 μm 5-HT (Fig. 2B). Concentration-response curves for agonists were constructed by normalizing the amplitude of current activated by a range of 5-HT or 2-Me-5-HT concentrations (I/IMAX for 5-HT and I/I30 μm 5-HT for 2-Me-5-HT), as shown in Fig. 2, C and D. The amplitude of currents activated by 5-HT or 2-Me-5-HT was concentration-dependent for both wild-type and R222A receptors. In addition, the concentration-response curves for both 5-HT and 2-Me-5-HT were shifted to the left by the R222A mutation (Fig. 2, C and D). In the R222A receptor the potency for 5-HT and 2-Me-5-HT was increased 5-fold and 12-fold, respectively (5-HT, EC50 = 0.5 ± 0.1 μm; 2-Me-5-HT, EC50 = 1.2 ± 0.2 μm), as compared with the wild-type receptor (5-HT, EC50 = 2.7 ± 0.4 μm; 2-Me-5-HT, EC50 = 14.4 ± 1.4 μm). The Hill slope of the concentration-response curve for 5-HT was not significantly changed by the R222A mutation (wild-type, 1.48 ± 0.08; R222A, 1.44 ± 0.06; p > 0.5), whereas the R222A mutation decreased the Hill slope for 2-Me-5-HT (wild-type, 2.48 ± 0.10; R222A, 1.20 ± 0.20; p < 0.05). In addition, the maximal response to 2-Me-5-HT was greatly increased by the R222A mutation, from 57.8 ± 2.3 to 103.3 ± 5.6% of the current activated by 30 μm 5-HT (p < 0.01). Voltage Independence—To address whether the R222A mutation altered ion permeation, current-voltage (I-V) relationships were obtained by measuring the amplitude of current activated by either 30 μm 5-HT or 100 μm 2-Me-5-HT at holding potentials from –80 to +60 mV (Fig. 3, A and B). The current evoked by both 5-HT and 2-Me-5-HT reversed at ∼5 mV, and the current-voltage relationship exhibited slight inward rectification for both agonists (Fig. 3, C and D). The R222A mutation had no significant effect on either the reversal potential for both 5-HT (wild-type, 4.90 ± 0.57; R222A, 4.49 ± 0.68; p > 0.5) and 2-Me-5-HT (wild type, 5.25 ± 0.0.62; R222A, 5.19 ± 0.0.67; p > 0.5) or the shape of the I-V relationship (Fig. 3, C and D). Antagonist Profile—Because some Arg-222 mutants exhibited spontaneous channel opening when expressed in Xenopus oocytes (14Zhang L. Hosoi M. Fukuzawa M. Sun H. Rawlings R.R. Weight F.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46256-46264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we examined whether the R222A mutation produced such activity in HEK 293 cells. Spontaneous opening of ligand-gated channels can be blocked with antagonists (14Zhang L. Hosoi M. Fukuzawa M. Sun H. Rawlings R.R. Weight F.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46256-46264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 16Chang Y. Weiss D.S. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2542-2551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, left, in cells expressing the wild-type receptors the application of 300 nm MDL 72222, a competitive 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, for 10 s in the absence of 5-HT did not alter the holding current. Similarly, in cells expressing the R222A receptors the application of 300 nm MDL 72222 for 10 s did not alter the holding current (Fig. 4A, right). We also tested the effectiveness of MDL 72222 in antagonizing 5-HT-activated currents. MDL 72222 at 300 nm completely blocked the current activated by 30 μm 5-HT in both the wild-type and the R222A receptors (Fig. 4B). Blockade of 5-HT-activated responses by MDL 72222 was readily reversed by washing (data not shown). Apomorphine has been reported to be an antagonist/very weak partial agonist in the 5-HT3 receptors (17van Hooft J.A. Vijverberg H.P. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Fig. 4C, left, shows that in the wild-type receptors 30 μm apomorphine activated a very small current when compared with the current activated by 30 μm 5-HT. In addition, when co-applied with 5-HT in the wild-type receptors, 30 μm apomorphine inhibited the current activated by 30 μm 5-HT. On the other hand, 30 μm apomorphine activated a significant inward current in the R222A receptors (Fig. 4C, right). The bar graphs in Fig. 4D show the average action of apomorphine in both the wild-type and the R222A receptors. Apomorphine inhibited 5-HT-activated current by 82.1 ± 3.1% in the wild-type receptors (p < 0.01). In the wild-type receptors the average amplitude of the current activated by 30 μm apomorphine was less than 1% that activated by 30 μm 5-HT; however, in the R222A receptors the average amplitude of the current activated by 30 μm apomorphine was ∼ 60% of the amplitude of the current activated by 30 μm 5-HT (wild type, 0.88 ± 0.35%; R222A, 60.8 ± 4.3%, p < 0.01). Activation Kinetics—To evaluate the kinetics of 5-HT3A receptor activation, 5-HT or 2-Me-5-HT was applied at different concentrations for a sufficient duration to allow the receptor-agonist interaction to reach equilibrium. Fig. 5, A and B, shows normalized responses to the application of 2.7 and 30 μm 5-HT (Fig. 5A) and 14.4 and 100 μm 2-Me-5-HT (Fig. 5B), respectively, from cells expressing the wild-type or the R222A receptors. The records show that high agonist concentrations elicited a faster activation than low agonist concentrations for both the wild-type and the R222A receptors. In addition, the rate of receptor activation was agonist-dependent for both the wild-type and the R222A receptors; fast for 5-HT and slower for 2-Me-5-HT. The R222A mutation significantly increased the rate of receptor activation for both 5-HT and 2-Me-5-HT. The activation of 5-HT3A receptors could be fitted with a single exponential function. The time constants for 2.7 and 30 μm 5-HT were 124.0 ± 7.4 and 16.2 ± 0.65 ms, respectively, in the wild-type receptors and 19.3 ± 1.4 and 8.7 ± 0.5 ms, respectively, in the R222A receptors. The time constants for 14.4 and 100 μm 2-Me-5-HT were 753.1 ± 43.4 and 288.7 ± 12.4 ms, respectively, in the wild-type receptors and 19.6 ± 1.4 and 13.0 ± 1.0 ms, respectively, in the R222A receptors. Fig. 5, C and D, plots the activation rate (inverse of the activation time constant, τactivation) as a function of 5-HT (Fig. 5C) and 2-Me-5-HT (Fig. 5D) concentration for the wild-type and the R222A receptors. Although the concentration at which the activation rate was half-maximal was 3.7 μm 5-HT for the R222A receptor, 25 μm 5-HT was required to achieve the same activation rate for the wild-type receptor. Similarly, 23 μm 2-Me-5-HT produced the half-maximal activation rate in the R222A receptor, but extrapolation suggests that 1800 μm 2-Me-5-HT would be needed to produce the same activation rate for the wild-type receptor. Gating—Activation of ligand-gated ion channels involves agonist binding and conformational changes that lead to gating. Previous studies on ligand-gated ion channels suggest that at low agonist concentrations, agonist binding is the rate-limiting step; however, when the agonist concentration is high, gating becomes the rate-limiting step, and the activation rate approximates the channel opening rate (18Celentano J.J.

In view of this, we examined the activation of both the wild-type and the R222A receptors with saturating concentrations of 5-HT. The increase in activation rate with increasing agonist concentrations appeared to reach a plateau at ∼300 μm 5-HT for both the wild-type (Fig. 6A) and R222A (Fig. 6B) receptors, since the activation rate did not appear to be accelerated by increasing 5-HT concentration above 300 μm (up to 3 mm). On the other hand, the activation rate was faster in R222A receptors than in wild-type receptors (Fig. 6C). In the wild-type receptors, for 5-HT concentrations ≥300 μm, average activation rates (Fig. 6D) were not significantly different (analysis of variance, p > 0.5). Similarly, in the R222A receptors, average activation rates (Fig. 6D) were not significantly different for 5-HT concentration ≥300 μm (analysis of variance, p > 0.3). However, the R222A mutation significantly accelerated the activation rate for 300 μm (p < 0.01), 1 mm (p < 0.001), and 3 mm 5-HT (p < 0.001) compared with the wild-type receptors (Fig. 6D). Deactivation Kinetics—Deactivation is the process of agonist unbinding and channel closing, and it is generally considered as an index of agonist affinity (19Lester R.A. Jahr C.E. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 635-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lester R.A. Tong G. Jahr C.E. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1088-1096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the R222A mutation alters the rate of deactivation, we examined the current deactivation kinetics after rapid removal of the agonist. The records in Fig. 7, A and B, illustrate the current deactivation after rapid removal of 1 mm 5-HT (Fig. 7A) and 100 μm 2-Me-5-HT (Fig. 7B) in cells expressing the wild-type and R222A 5-HT3A receptors. 5-HT was removed after a 2-ms application, whereas 2-Me-5-HT was removed before desensitization was observed. When the agonist was rapidly washed-out, the currents decayed back to base line as a mono-exponential function for both the wild-type and the R222A receptors. The R222A mutation did not alter the deactivation rate (inverse of deactivation time constant, τdeactivation) for either 5-HT (wild type, 0.34 ± 0.03 s–1; R222A, 0.34 ± 0.03 s–1; p > 0.5) or 2-Me-5-HT (wild type, 0.57 ± 0.02 s–1; R222A, 0.58 ± 0.02 s–1; p > 0.5). However, the deactivation rate was agonist-dependent, and on average, 2-Me-5-HT had a significantly faster deactivation rate than 5-HT (p < 0.01) for both the wild-type and the R222A receptors, Fig. 7C). Desensitization Kinetics—In the continued presence of agonist, the activated current exhibited a marked decrease in amplitude after reaching a peak, indicating receptor desensitization. Examples of the desensitization resulting from the application of 30 μm 5-HT and 100 μm 2-Me-5-HT are shown in Fig. 8, A and B, respectively. For the wild-type 5-HT3A receptors, the desensitization of the current was relatively slow and well described by a mono-exponential function. In addition, the desensitization time constant for 2-Me-5-HT in the wild-type receptors was significantly slower than for 5-HT (p < 0.04). For the R222A receptors, a bi-exponential function was required to adequately fit the desensitization of the current activated by 5-HT or 2-Me-5-HT. Both the fast and slow desensitization components of the R222A receptors were similar for 5-HT and 2-Me-5-HT (p > 0.50). The fast component contributed ∼60% of the total current decay for both agonists (Fig. 8, C and D). The slow component of the decay in the R222A receptor for either 5-HT or 2-Me-5-HT was faster than the current decay in the wild-type receptor (p < 0.01). In the present study, we investigated the role of amino acid residue Arg-222 in the function of 5-HT3A receptors. We found that the R222A mutation increased the apparent potency of both the agonist, 5-HT, and the partial agonist, 2-Me-5-HT. The R222A mutation also increased the efficacy of the partial agonist, 2-Me-5-HT, and converted the antagonist/very weak partial agonist, apomorphine, to a potent agonist. In addition, the R222A mutation accelerated the rate of 5-HT3A receptor activation and desensitization, but it did not alter the rate of 5-HT3A receptor deactivation. Ligand-gated ion channels exist in at least three intercon-vertible states (resting, open, and desensitized), and the function of these channels is thought to be determined by the transitions among these states (6Karlin A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Activation of ligand-gated ion channels involves the binding of agonist to the receptor, which results in a conformational change of the protein that opens the channel. In the present study, how the R222A mutation affects 5-HT3A receptor activation was examined. Because deactivation is defined as the process of the unbinding of agonist from the open state of the receptor and the channel returning to the closed resting state, it is expected that receptors with a higher affinity for agonist in the open state would decrease the probability of agonist unbinding from the receptor. Thus, agonist affinity could be assessed from agonist unbinding rate (19Lester R.A. Jahr C.E. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 635-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lester R.A. Tong G. Jahr C.E. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1088-1096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If the R222A mutation increases agonist affinity, the deactivation rate of the receptor would be expected to be slower. We found, however, that the R222A mutation did not change the rate of deactivation, because currents for both wild-type and R222A receptors decayed with similar kinetics upon removal of agonist. The observation that the mutation did not alter the deactivation rate for either 5-HT or 2-Me-5-HT is, thus, inconsistent with an increase in agonist affinity for R222A receptors. This is consistent with the observation in a single-oocyte binding assay (14Zhang L. Hosoi M. Fukuzawa M. Sun H. Rawlings R.R. Weight F.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46256-46264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, we cannot exclude the possibility from this study that Arg-222 is part of the agonist binding pocket. 2-Me-5-HT is a partial agonist at mouse wild-type 5-HT3A receptors (21Hussy N. Lukas W. Jones K.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 481: 311-323Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Because the relative efficacy of an agonist is dependent in part upon the gating process (22Colquhoun D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 924-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar), the conversion of the partial agonist, 2-Me-5-HT, into a full agonist suggests the possibility of an enhanced gating efficacy in the R222A receptors. The increase in efficacy by R222A mutation is not unique to 2-Me-5-HT, because this mutation also converted the extremely weak 5-HT3 receptor partial agonist, apomorphine, to a potent agonist. In addition, the R222A mutation was found to enhance the rate of 5-HT3A receptor activation at saturating concentrations of 5-HT, which is also consistent with a facilitation of the gating process. For the ligand-gated ion channels, it has been found that a mutation that facilitates gating may only cause a shift to the left of the agonist concentration-response curve for a full agonist (22Colquhoun D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 924-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). The observations that the R222A mutation accelerated activation of 5-HT3A receptors by 5-HT and increased the apparent potency of 5-HT suggest that the efficacy of 5-HT to gate the channel is also enhanced by the mutation. Alterations in apparent potency and efficacy of agonists by mutations have been observed for other ligand-gated ion channels. For example, point mutations in α7-nACh receptors at Leu-247 (23Bertrand D. Devillers-Thiery A. Revah F. Galzi J.L. Hussy N. Mulle C. Bertrand S. Ballivet M. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1261-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic acid receptors at Ala-636 (24Taverna F. Xiong Z.G. Brandes L. Roder J.C. Salter M.W. MacDonald J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8475-8479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) converted an antagonist into an agonist and increased the apparent potency of agonists. On the other hand mutations in the NR1 subunit of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors at Asp-732 (25Williams K. Chao J. Kashiwagi K. Masuko T. Igarashi K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 701-708PubMed Google Scholar) and the α2 subunit of nACh receptors at Asp-200 (26O'Leary M.E. White M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8360-8365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Akk G. Sine S. Auerbach A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 496: 185-196Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar) decreased apparent agonist potency and converted partial agonists into competitive antagonists. The distance between the agonist binding sites and the channel pore of the nACh receptor is estimated to be ∼30 Å (28Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1101-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). The agonist binding sites of the 5-HT3A receptor are thought to be comparable with those of the nACh receptor (29Reeves D.C. Lummis S.C. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2002; 19: 11-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Because the agonist binding sites are at a distance from the channel gating mechanism, the binding signal must involve a transduction mechanism to open the channel. The binding of agonist to the receptor is thought to provide the driving force to open the channel (30Chen J. Zhang Y. Akk G. Sine S. Auerbach A. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 849-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31Jackson M.B. Adv. Neurol. 1999; 79: 511-524PubMed Google Scholar). It is proposed for nACh receptors that the binding of agonist triggers a localized disturbance at the binding sites that transmits to transmembrane domains of the receptor through a small rotation of the N-terminal domain (32Unwin N. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci.. 2000; 355: 1813-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Our observations on the role of Arg-222 in the gating of 5-HT3A receptors suggest that this amino acid residue may be involved in the transduction of the signal from agonist binding to channel gating. The pre-TM1 region and TM2-TM3 loop of several ligandgated ion channels have been found to be critical in the coupling of agonist binding to channel gating. Certain residues of the TM2-TM3 loop in nACh receptors (33Campos-Caro A. Sala S. Ballesta J.J. Vicente-Agullo F. Criado M. Sala F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6118-6123Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 34Grosman C. Salamone F.N. Sine S.M. Auerbach A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), glycine receptors (35Rajendra S. Lynch J.W. Pierce K.D. French C.R. Barry P.H. Schofield P.R. Neuron. 1995; 14: 169-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (36Kash T.L. Jenkins A. Kelley J.C. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Nature. 2003; 421: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) have been found to participate in the transduction of agonist binding to channel gating. For N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, the pre-TM1 segment was found to link agonist binding to channel gating and to affect entry into open and desensitized states (37Krupp J.J. Vissel B. Heinemann S.F. Westbrook G.L. Neuron. 1998; 20: 317-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent study suggests that an interaction of residues in TM1 of nACh receptors, which are near Arg-222 in 5-HT3A receptors, and TM2 contributes to the gating process (38Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 424: 949-955Crossref Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that Arg-222, located in pre-TM1 of 5-HT3A receptors, may also play a crucial role in the transduction mechanism coupling agonist binding to channel opening and entry into the desensitized state. In this context, Arg-222 may serve as a constraint to gating of the 5-HT3A receptors by maintaining the wild-type receptors in the resting closed state. The R222A mutation may release this constraint and reduce the energy barrier for channel opening, increasing apparent agonist potency and partial agonist efficacy as a result of enhanced coupling between agonist binding and gating. In the present study, it appears that the R222A mutation reduced the energy barrier for agonist to open the channel. In this regard, it should be noted that arginine and alanine residues differ in their size, polarity, and hydrophobicity. Facilitated coupling resulting from the R222A mutation might be due to the decreased side-chain size, the increased hydrophobicity, or the reduced charge. Any of these changes may reduce the energy barrier for channel opening and, thus, facilitate the transition from a closed to an open state. Mutations at Val-385 of the α subunit of muscle type nACh receptors revealed that both volume and stereochemistry contribute to channel gating but not to binding affinity (39Wang H.L. Milone M. Ohno K. Shen X.M. Tsujino A. Batocchi A.P. Tonali P. Brengman J. Engel A.G. Sine S.M. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The observation that some 5-HT3A receptor mutants, such as R222F and R222I, exhibits spontaneous channel opening (14Zhang L. Hosoi M. Fukuzawa M. Sun H. Rawlings R.R. Weight F.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46256-46264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) is consistent with the notion that Arg-222 mutations can reduce the energy barrier for channel opening. It has been proposed that the closed resting state is the most stable conformation in the absence of agonist, whereas the closed desensitized state is the most stable conformation in the presence of agonist (6Karlin A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Desensitization is a widespread phenomenon among ligand-gated ion channels (40Jones M.V. Westbrook G.L. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 96-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Our observation that the R222A receptors exhibited a significantly faster desensitization than the wild-type receptors suggests that although the R222A mutation facilitated gating of the receptor, it also increased the proportion of receptors entering into the desensitized state from the open state. It has been proposed for the nACh receptor that gating and desensitization are energetically coupled events (41Auerbach A. Akk G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 181-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Our observation that an increase in gating efficacy is associated with an enhanced desensitization of 5-HT3A receptors is consistent with such a notion and suggests that desensitization of 5-HT3A receptors is positively coupled to gating. In summary, we have found that the R222A mutation can enhance the apparent potency of agonists and the efficacy of partial agonists in 5-HT3A receptors. Kinetic analysis indicates that these alterations are associated with faster activation and desensitization of this receptor channel. The unique position of Arg-222 may allow it to couple the binding of agonist to the opening of the channel, since the R222A mutation appears to reduce the energy barrier for gating. A reduced energy barrier may speed up activation, which in turn may increase the apparent potency of agonists and the efficacy of partial agonists. Thus, our data suggest that Arg-222 has a functional role in the signal transduction mechanism of 5-HT3A receptors. We thank Drs. Amir Ghazanfari and Julia Healey for technical assistance, Dr. David Julius for providing mouse 5-HT3A receptor cDNA, and Drs. David Lovinger and Robert Peoples for reviewing the manuscript."

We used reverse transcription-PCR to identify SAP97 isoforms of human and rat myocardium. In Chinese hamster ovary cells, cloned protein expression was studied using Western blot, confocal imaging of green fluorescent protein-tagged proteins, and patch clamp technique. The two main cardiac SAP97 isoforms contained both I3 and I1B inserts and differed by the I1A insert. Both isoforms co-precipitated with hKv1.5 channels. Only the isoform lacking I1A increased the current (by 215 ± 22%), whatever the level of channel expression. To examine the involvement of the proline-rich I1A insert in the effect of SAP97, a W623F mutation in the Src homology 3 domain was created, and that restored the effect of the SAP97 on current. SAP97 isoform containing an I1A and I2 domain instead of the I3 domain stimulated the current, whereas SAP97 after deletion of the Src homology 3 and guanylate kinase-like domains did not. In cells co-expressing I3(+I1A) or I3(-I1A), green fluorescent protein-tagged Kv1.5 channels were organized in plaque-like structures at the plasma membrane level, whereas intracellular aggregates of channels predominated with the I2 isoform.

The two cardiac SAP97 isoforms have different effects on the hKv1.5 current, depending on their capacity to form channel clusters. Localization of ionic channels in distinct plasma membrane domains is critical for cell function. For instance, in the myocardium, a number of ionic channels are concentrated in the intercalated disk, where they contribute to the normal propagation of the electrical influx between myocytes. The functional properties of ionic channels are generally regulated by various auxiliary proteins that compose, together with the α-subunits of the channels, large protein networks.The mechanisms that regulate this highly specialized organization and localization of ionic channels are unclear. Important clues have come from the identification of a family of anchoring proteins named MAGUK (membrane-associated guanylate kinases) that appear to play a critical role in the formation and subcellular localization of channel complexes (1Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). The MAGUK protein SAP97 (the mammalian homologue of Dlg in Drosophila) is abundantly expressed in both human and rat ventricular myocardium and is associated with potassium Kir2.2 and Kv1.5 channels (2Leonoudakis D. Mailliard W. Wingerd K. Clegg D. Vandenberg C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 987-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Murata M. Buckett P.D. Zhou J. Brunner M. Folco E. Koren G. Am. J.

Like other MAGUK proteins, SAP97 bears multiple sites of protein-protein interactions, namely three PDZ (postsynaptic, disc large, zonula occludens) domains, an Src homology 3 (SH3) 1The abbreviations used are: SH3Src homology 3GUKguanylate kinase-likeGKguanylate kinaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinCHOChinese hamster ovarypA/pFpicoamps/picofarads.1The abbreviations used are: SH3Src homology 3GUKguanylate kinase-likeGKguanylate kinaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinCHOChinese hamster ovarypA/pFpicoamps/picofarads. region, and a guanylate kinase-like domain (GUK). The PDZ domains are the best characterized and bind to the carboxyl-terminal peptide motif (S/T)X(V/L) in a number of proteins, including voltage-gated and inwardly rectifying K+ channels (1Kim E.

These channels are responsible for one of the major repolarizing currents of cardiac myocytes. By using various electrophysiological and cytological approaches, we found that cardiac SAP97 isoforms have distinct effects on the functional properties and membrane expression of hKv1.5 channels.MATERIALS AND METHODSTissue Samples—Whole hearts were excised from Wistar rats, washed in 1× PBS, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Specimens of human right atrial appendage were obtained, with approval from the ethics committee of our institution, from patients undergoing heart surgery. Myocardial samples were also frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C.Cell Preparation and Transfection—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen Nutrient Mixture) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Single and double transfection of CHO cells was performed with hKv1.5 and/or SAP97 isoforms cloned into tagging or biscistronic vectors, as previously described (12Godreau D. Vranckx R. Hatem S.N. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 300: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Except when indicated, cells were transfected with 0.1 μg of Kv1.5 plasmid plus 1.5 μg of SAP97 plasmid and 0.4 μg of empty plasmid or with 0.1 μg of Kv1.5 plasmid plus 1.9 μg of empty plasmid. For proteasome inhibition, growing transfected cells were treated with calpain I inhibitor (MG101 or N-acetyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinyl-l-norleucinal (ALLN)) at a final concentration of 50 μm for 24 h before confocal microscopy.Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Assay—Total RNA was extracted from tissue by using the phenol-chloroform method (13Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal.

To evaluate the relative abundance of the different isoforms, reverse-transcribed RNA (100 ng) was submitted to polymerase chain reaction amplification (PCR) in a 25-μl reaction mixture with conventional Taq (Invitrogen) (annealing temperature 55 °C, 30 cycles), using the following sense and antisense primers for rat tissue: 5′-GTGACTTCAGAGAGCCTGCC-3′ and 5′-CCCCTTTCAAGTGTGATTTCC-3′ for I1 insertion; 5′-CAGACAGGTGACCCCAGA-3′ and 5′-CGGCTCATACGATAAAACA-3′ for the I2 versus I3 insertion. For human tissue, the following primers were used: 5′-GTGACTTCAGAGACACTGCCA-3′ and 5′-CCCTTTCAAGTGTGATTTCTTC-3′ for I1 insertion; 5′-ACCAGATGGTGAGAGCGAT-3′ and 5′-CGGCTCATACGATAAAACA-3′ for the I2 versus I3 insertion.Cloning Procedures—Reverse-transcribed cardiac RNA (100 ng) was submitted to PCR in a 50-μl reaction mixture using high fidelity Taq Platinium (Invitrogen) in the following conditions: 32 cycles (annealing temperature 55 °C, 30 s, elongation temperature 72 °C, 1 min). The sense and antisense primers used to investigate the I1A and I1B region of rat SAP97 were 5′-TCAGGACGAAGAGGTGCTGCC-3′ and 5′-CCGTTGAGCCACGATGAAGAACA-3′. Primers 5′-CAAAAGCGGTCCCTCTATGTC-3′ and 5′-ATGCTTGCCCTTCTCTGCTAC-3′ were used to investigate the hook region. After verifying that the amino acid sequences of SAP97 domains were similar in rats and humans, we constructed the cardiac isoforms from a rat SAP97 sequence already available in the laboratory. The new insertions of SAP97 amplified by PCR were digested with appropriate enzymes and ligated into the previous SAP97 construct (4Godreau D. Vranckx R. Maguy A. Rucker-Martin C. Goyenvalle C. Abdelshafy S. Tessier S. Couetil J.P. Hatem S.N. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 56: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech) or homemade pIRES2-DsRed1 expression vectors containing the coding sequence for cardiac isoforms were thus constructed. The constructs containing a mutation in the SH3 domain were assembled by sequential PCR with appropriate primer sequences.A both-end-modified EGFP was produced by PCR with the primers 5′-AAGGATCCAAGGGCGAGGAGCTGTT-3′ and 5′-AAGGATCCGAGAGTGATCCCGGCG-3′ and pIRES2-EGFP as matrix. The product was inserted into the BamHI restriction site of the hKv1.5 coding sequence and then inserted into the EcoRI/SalI cloning site of plasmid pCDNA3 to create an internally GFP-tagged hKv1.5. The GFP-tagged SAP97 (I3 isoform containing the I1A domain) was constructed in pEGFP-N3. All PCR products were sequenced to confirm that the inserted nucleotides sequences were correct.Protein Extraction and Immunoprecipitation—Two days after transfection, 100-mm culture dishes of confluent CHO cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested with ice-cold 10 mm Tris buffer, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, in the presence of the following enzyme inhibitors: iodoacetamine (1 mm), 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (0.5 nm), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), pepstatin (1 μg/ml), and Na3VO4 (1 mm). Final protein extraction and immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out as previously described (4Godreau D. Vranckx R. Maguy A. Rucker-Martin C. Goyenvalle C. Abdelshafy S. Tessier S. Couetil J.P. Hatem S.N. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 56: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Goat anti-mouse IgG M-450 Dynabeads (Dynal) were used for immunoprecipitation. Negative control consisted in incubating proteins with beads that were not coated with the PSD95 family or GFP mouse antibodies. Proteins were separated on 8% polyacrylamide-SDS gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Western blots were incubated with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies and then revealed by chemoluminescence with the Amersham ECL kit. The antibodies used were as follows: rabbit anti-mouse Kv1.5 antibody (Alomone Labs), mouse anti-PSD-95 family antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), and rabbit or mouse anti-GFP (Torrey Pines Biolabs Inc. and Chemicon International, respectively). The specificity of the primary antibodies used was checked by probing the membrane with the secondary antibody only.Confocal Microscopy—Unfixed transfected CHO cells were examined with a Zeiss LSM-510 confocal scanning laser microscope equipped with a 25-milliwatt argon laser and a ×63 oil objective with a numerical aperture of 1.4. Green fluorescence was observed with a 505–550-nm band pass emission filter under 488-nm laser illumination.Current Measurements—Whole-cell patch clamp currents were recorded with borosilicate glass pipettes (resistance 1.5–2 megaohms) connected to the input stage of a patch clamp amplifier (Axoclamp 200A; Axon Instruments). Resistance in series was compensated to obtain the fastest capacity transient current, but the capacitive and leakage currents were not compensated. Currents were filtered at 5 kHz, digitized with a Labmaster (Lab Rac; Scientific Solutions), and stored on the hard disk of a personal computer. Data were acquired and analyzed with Acquis-1 software (G. Sadoc, CNRS, Gif/Yvette, France).Solutions and Drugs—Cells were bathed in an external solution containing 137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose, adjusted to pH 7.3 with NaOH. Patch pipettes were filled with an internal solution containing 115 mm potassium aspartate, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm MgATP, 5 mm sodium pyruvate, 3 mm MgCl2, 4 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH. All experiments were carried out at room temperature.Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.E. For comparison of the effect on ionic currents between the various SAP97 mutants studied, the following statistical analyses were used: (i) for each experiment, a Student's unpaired t test was used to determine the significance of differences between control current and the SAP97 isoform tested; (ii) for comparisons of data obtained from the different experiments of the study, Dunnett's test was used. Current density, expressed in pA/pF, or normalized current (i.e. for each experiment, values were normalized with the average current density obtained in control conditions) were used for statistical analysis. p values of <0.05 were considered significant.RESULTSMultiple SAP97 Isoforms Exist in Human Atrial Myocardium—As illustrated in Fig. 1A, in addition to PDZ repeats and SH3 and GUK domains, SAP97 is known to contain the alternatively spliced exons I1A, I1B, I2, and I3 (8Lue R.A. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9818-9822Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 10McLaughlin M. Hale R. Ellston D. Gaudet S. Lue R.A. Viel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6406-6412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Using a semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR assay, we only detected transcripts for SAP97 isoforms containing I3 and I1A domains (I3(+I1A)) or containing I3 but lacking I1A (I3(-I1A)), in both human atrial and ventricular myocardium (Fig. 1B). Unless a large number of PCR amplification cycles was used, the other SAP97 isoforms, including the variant containing the I2 domain, were not detected, using rat liver as positive control (Fig. 1B).We therefore decided to clone the two main cardiac SAP97 isoforms, namely I3(-I1A) and I3(+I1A). Expression of the cloned proteins was first checked in transfected CHO cells, using a Western blot assay. As shown in Fig. 1C, probing membrane protein extracted from transfected CHO cells with the anti-PSD95 protein family antibody revealed a strong doublet at 140 kDa (the molecular mass of SAP97) together with a band at around 90 kDa that has been shown to correspond to a cleaved form of SAP97 (4Godreau D. Vranckx R. Maguy A. Rucker-Martin C. Goyenvalle C. Abdelshafy S. Tessier S. Couetil J.P. Hatem S.N. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 56: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In control CHO cells, a weak band at 140 kDa was visible whereas the short form was absent, indicating the presence of endogenous MAGUK proteins in this cell line. It should be noted that, with both the I3(-I1A) and I3(+I1A) isoforms, the short form that cross-reacted with an anti-PDZ1–2 antibody migrated at the same molecular mass of around 90 kDa. To further discriminate between endogenous and exogenous SAP97, CHO cells were transfected with an empty pIRES2-EGFP plasmid or with a plasmid containing the sequence encoding the GFP-tagged SAP97. In CHO cells expressing GFP-tagged SAP97, in addition to the 140-kDa band, also seen in cells expressing GFP alone, the anti-PSD95 protein family antibody cross-reacted with two bands at around 170 and 120 kDa. These two 170- and 120-kDa bands were also detected by the anti-GFP antibody and thus very likely correspond to the GFP-tagged SAP97 and its short form (Fig. 1D).SAP97 Isoforms Interact with Cloned hKv1.5 Shaker Channels—Co-immunoprecipitation assays were used to study interactions between cardiac SAP97 isoforms and hKv1.5 channels expressed in CHO cells. Both cardiac SAP97 isoforms co-immunoprecipitated with GFP-tagged hKv1.5, as indicated by the typical pattern of protein migration with a band at 140 kDa and the short form at around 90 kDa (Fig. 2A). Endogenous MAGUK proteins also co-precipitated with GFP-tagged Kv1.5 channels, but again the density of the band at around 140-kDa was lower than in transfected cells, and the cleaved form was absent (Fig. 2A). It is noteworthy that in control CHO cells, beads coated with the anti-GFP antibody failed to precipitate the SAP97 (Fig. 2A; raw 4). This result indicated that the precipitation of SAP97 obtained with the anti-PSD95 or anti-GFP antibodies in cells expressing GFP-tagged Kv1.5 channels could not be attributed to an unspecific binding of SAP97 on beads. Additional evidence of an interaction between SAP97 isoforms and GFP-tagged hKv1.5 channels was provided by the detection, in the immunoprecipitate obtained with the anti-PSD95 family antibody, of a protein probed with the anti-GFP antibody at a molecular mass of around 110 kDa, corresponding roughly to the sum of the Kv channel and GFP molecular weights (n = 3) (Fig. 2B). These results indicated that both cardiac isoforms interact with hKv1.5 channels.Fig. 2Interaction between SAP-97 isoforms and hKv1.5 Shaker channels.A, total protein obtained from CHO cells co-expressing one of the two SAP97 isoforms and GFP-tagged Kv1.5 channels was immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody, and Western blots were probed with anti-PSD95 family antibody. B, the same protein sample as in A was immunoprecipitated with anti-PSD95 family antibody and hybridized with rabbit anti-GFP antibody (note that nonspecific bands were also detected).

Cells expressing hKv1.5, either alone (0.1 μg of Kv1.5 plasmid) or together with the SAP97 isoforms, showed a typical rapidly activating voltage-dependent outward current with a threshold of activation at around -20 mV and a reversal potential of tail current at -81 ± 1 mV (Ek = -85 mV in our conditions) (Fig. 3A). In cells co-expressing hKv1.5 and the I3(-I1A) isoform, the current density was markedly increased compared with cells expressing Kv1.5 alone (215 ± 22%; n = 29, p < 0.01 and Fig. 3B). In contrast, current density did not differ between cells expressing Kv1.5 channels alone and those also expressing the I3(+I1A) isoform (126 ± 15%; n = 29, not significant and Fig. 3B). Since the effects of SAP97 on current can vary with the level of channel expression (3Murata M. Buckett P.D. Zhou J. Brunner M. Folco E. Koren G. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H2575-H2584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the effects of the I3(+I1A) and I3(-I1A) isoforms in CHO cells transfected with a very small amount of Kv1.5 plasmid (0.01 μg of Kv1.5 plasmid). In this experimental condition, current density was reduced (29.6 ± 3.14 pA/pF versus 13.4 ± 15.2 pA/pF with 0.1 μg and 0.01 of Kv1.5 plasmid, respectively), in keeping with the presence of fewer functional channels; in addition, the I3(+I1A) isoform stimulated the current (215 ± 16%, n = 33; p < 0.01) (Fig. 3B). These results indicated that the enhancing effect of the two cardiac SAP97 isoforms on current depends on the level of channel expression.Fig. 3Effect of cardiac SAP-97 on the hKv1.5 channel-encoded current.A, traces of current elicited by 750-ms incremental test pulses starting at -60 mV in CHO cells expressing hKv1.5 channels alone or together with the two SAP-97 isoforms I3(-I1A) and I3(+I1A).

In PSD-95, W470 mediates the binding of proline-rich domain to the SH3 domain. In SAP97, this amino acid is located in position 623. We replaced it by a phenylalanine and checked that this mutant still interacted with hKv1.5 channels in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. In CHO co-expressing both the MAGUK and the GFP-tagged Kv1.5 channel, SAP97 protein was detected in the anti-GFP immunoprecipitate at around 140 kDa, whereas GFP-tagged Kv1.5 channels were detected in the protein precipitate obtained with the anti-PSD95 family antibody (Fig. 4, A and B). Moreover, the hKv1.5-encoded current was increased by I3(+I1A)W623F with 0.1 μg of Kv1.5 cDNA: 240 ± 50%; n = 14; p < 0.01) (Fig. 5).Fig. 4Role of intramolecular interactions in the SAP97 effect on Kv1.5 channels.A, in CHO cells co-expressing the GFP-tagged Kv1.5 channel and the SAP97 I3 variants, proteins were immunoprecipitated with the mouse anti-GFP antibody and hybridized with an anti-PSD95 family antibody. B, the same protein sample as in A was precipitated with the anti-PDS95 family antibody and probed with the rabbit anti-GFP antibody (note that a nonspecific band was also detected). C, in CHO cells co-expressing the GFP-tagged Kv1.5 channels and the SAP97 I2 isoform, proteins were immunoprecipitated with the anti-GFP antibody and hybridized with an anti-PSD95 family antibody. D, the same protein sample as in C was immunoprecipitated with an anti-PDS95 family antibody and probed with the mouse anti-GFP antibody.

Thus, we examined the effect on the K+ current of SAP97 isoforms containing an I2 domain instead of an I3 domain, with or without the proline-rich domain I1A, I2(+I1A) and I2(-I1A), respectively. Both I2 isoforms co-immunoprecipitated with hKv1.5 channels (Fig. 4, C and D) and enhanced the current density, by 187 ± 16% (n = 40; p < 0.01) and 188 ± 24% (n = 21; p < 0.01) with I2(+I1A) and I2(-I1A), respectively (Fig. 5).To further examine the role of molecular interactions in the effects of SAP97 on Kv1.5-encoded current, a truncated SAP97 lacking the SH3 and GUK domains but containing the spliced exon I1A was created. The truncated form bound to the channel but did not significantly enhance the current density (118 ± 18%, n = 18, not significant) (Fig. 5).Distinct Effects of SAP97 Isoforms on the Spatial Channel Organization—The role of SAP97 isoforms in the cellular localization and organization of Kv1.5 channels was studied in live cells by using GFP-tagged channels and confocal microscopy. Fig. 6A shows that in CHO cells transfected only with GFP-tagged Kv1.5 channels, the fluorescence was homogeneously distributed throughout the entire cell body (Fig. 6A). In cells co-expressing hKv1.5 channels and the I3(-I1A) or I3(+I1A) isoform, the fluorescence was well organized at the plasma membrane level, resembling the plaquelike clusters described in the literature and also showing a reticular distribution (Fig. 6, B and C) (14Tiffany A.M.

To determine whether the large aggregates of channels observed with the I2 isoform were due to aggresome of protein, in some experiments the proteasome was inhibited with 50 μm ALLN, or cells were transfected with a large amount (2 μg) of Kv1.5 plasmid (15Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar). Incubation with ALLN of CHO co-expressing the I3(+I1A) isoform and Kv channels GFP-tagged or transfected with a large amount of hKv1.5 plasmid (2 μg) resulted in the appearance of large aggregates of Kv1.5 channels that accumulated in the cytosol of more than 60% of cells studied (Fig. 6, E and F).DISCUSSIONPrevious studies have shown the existence of several isoforms of the MAGUK protein SAP97, containing different combinations of alternatively spliced insertions that regulate both the subcellular localization of SAP97 and its capacity to self-associate in multimers (8Lue R.A.

However, the precise locations and roles of these receptors in the central nervous system are unknown. We studied the expression localization of GABA receptor/channel ρ1 subunit in mouse spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia (DRG). The immunohistochemistry results indicated that GABA receptor/channel ρ1 subunits were expressed in mouse spinal cord superficial dorsal horn (lamina I and lamina II) and in DRG. To understand the functions of the GABA receptor/channel ρ1 subunit in these crucial sites of sensory transmission in vivo, we generated GABA receptor/channel ρ1 subunit mutant mice (rho1-/-). GABA receptor/channel ρ1 subunit expression in the rho1-/- mice was eliminated completely, whereas the gross neuroanatomical structures of the rho1-/- mice spinal cord and DRG were unchanged. Electrophysiological recording showed that GABA-mediated spinal cord response was altered in the rho1-/- mice. A decreased threshold for mechanical pain in the rho1-/- mice compared with control mice was observed with the von Frey filament test.

GABA receptors have been classified into three distinct subtypes based on their pharmacological properties. GABAA receptor/channels are inhibited by bicuculline (1Curtis D.R. Duggan A.W. Felix D. Johnston G.A. Nature. 1970; 226: 1222-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), GABAB receptors are sensitive to baclofen (an agonist) (2Hill D.R. Bowery N.G. Nature. 1981; 290: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar), whereas GABAC receptor/channels are insensitive to both bicuculline and baclofen (3Johnston G.A. Prog.

Both GABAA and GABAC receptors form ligand-gated chloride channels, whereas the GABAB receptor belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor family and is coupled to the K+ and Ca2+ channels. GABA receptor/channel heterogeneity in the CNS is achieved by at least 19 different subunits, including α1–6, β1–3, γ1–3, δ, θ, π, ϵ, and ρ1–3 (5Davies P.A. Hanna M.C. Hales T.G. Kirkness E.F.

The hybrid receptor/channel very likely possesses pharmacological and electrophysiological properties that are distinct from those of typical GABAA and GABAC receptor/channels (19Ekema G.M. Zheng W. Lu L. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 2326-2333PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the GABAC receptor/channel formed by the ρ1 subunit is suggested to be a unique subclass of the GABA-gated ionotropic receptor/channel family. The ρ1 subunit is also considered to be an important component of the GABA receptor/channel heterogeneity with special functional properties. γ-aminobutyric acid central nervous system dorsal root ganglia (1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine-4-yl) methyl-phosphinic acid reverse transcriptase phosphate-buffered saline glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase embryonic stem lamina. GABA receptor/channel ρ1 subunit is highly enriched in the retina, where strong immunoreactivities of ρ1 and ρ2 subunits have been found in the inner plexiform layer, and weaker immunoreactivities have been found in the outer plexiform layer and cell bodies of bipolar cells (16Koulen P.

The ρ1 subunit is also expressed elsewhere, including the hippocampus (23Wegelius K. Pasternack M. Hiltunen J.O. Rivera C. Kaila K. Saarma M. Reeben M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), cerebellum (24Boue-Grabot E. Roudbaraki M. Bascles L. Tramu G. Bloch B. Garret M. J.

Neurosci. 2002; 15: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, the precise localizations of the ρ1 subunit within these regions have not been defined. One important function of the ρ1 subunit is its weak desensitization, even at high agonist concentrations (4Bormann J. Feigenspan A.

Desensitization of ligand-gated receptor/channel is an intrinsic feedback mechanism and prevents the receptor/channel from being overly activated. The slow desensitization of the ρ1 subunit suggests a unique biological function of the subunit in the nervous system (29Johnston G.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 319-323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Feigenspan A. Bormann J. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 1998; 17: 99-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). GABA receptor/channel ρ1 subunit is inhibited by (1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine-4-yl) methyl-phosphinic acid (TPMPA) (31Ragozzino D. Woodward R.M. Murata Y. Eusebi F. Overman L.E. Miledi R. Mol.

The functions of the GABA receptor/channel ρ1 subunit are mainly studied in the retina, where it is thought that the GABAC receptor/channel formed by the ρ1 subunit is involved in mediating lateral inhibition (30Feigenspan A. Bormann J. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 1998; 17: 99-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 34Lukasiewicz P.D. Werblin F.S. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1213-1223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and local gain control circuitry (34Lukasiewicz P.D. Werblin F.S. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1213-1223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Dong C.J. Werblin F.S. J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 79: 2171-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In other regions of the CNS, the functions of the GABA receptor/channel ρ1 subunit are largely unknown. Nevertheless, GABA has been long known for its important roles within the spinal cord, controlling sensory input via modulation of primary afferent transmitter release (36Malcangio M. Bowery N.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 457-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Indeed, the activation of GABAA and GABAB receptors is antinociceptive in a variety of rodent models (36Malcangio M. Bowery N.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 457-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 37Sawynok J. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 1987; 26: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The effects are thought to be mediated through the presynaptic inhibition of the primary afferent fibers by GABAA and GABAB receptors (36Malcangio M. Bowery N.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 457-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 38Henry J.L. Neuropharmacology. 1982; 21: 1085-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the functional significance of the GABA receptor/channel ρ1 subunit in the spinal sensory pathway remains to be resolved. To address this issue, we have conducted RT-PCR and immunohistochemical studies to define the expression localization of the GABA receptor/channel ρ1 subunit within mouse spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia (DRG). To assess the functional roles of ρ1 subunit in the sensory pathway, we have generated mutant mice carrying a deletion of the first exon of the ρ1 gene. RT-PCR analyses indicate that the ρ1 subunit gene transcription was completely abolished in tissues from the rho1-/- mice. Immunohistochemical results demonstrate that ρ subunits expression was eliminated completely in the rho1-/- mice spinal dorsal horn and DRG. Electrophysiological studies indicate that GABA-inhibited spinal cord response was altered in rho1-/- mice. Moreover, mechanical pain sensitivity in the rho1-/- mice was significantly changed compared with control mice despite the apparently normal neuroanatomical structures of the mutant mice. These findings suggest that the GABA receptor/channel ρ1 subunit is essential in modulating spinal cord nociceptive functions in vivo. Immunohistochemistry and Nissl Stain—Adult mice (rho1-/- and rho1+/+) were overdosed with 5% sodium pentobarbital and then transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min. Spinal cord lumbar segments (L4–L6) and DRG were removed and placed overnight in 10, 20, and 30% sucrose PBS solution series for cryoprotection. The spinal segments and DRG were embedded in OCT® compound (Fisher), and 10–20-μm sections were cut on a cryostat (Zeiss). The sections were thaw-mounted onto slides, air-dried, and stored at -80 °C. For immunohistochemistry experiments, the slides were warmed to room temperature and washed four times for 5 min in PBS. The sections were encircled with hydrophobic resin (PAP Pen) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h in a solution of 1:10 normal goat serum in PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100 and 1% bovine serum albumin to block nonspecific antibody binding. Then rabbit anti-ρ antiserum in the blocking solution at dilution of 1:100 was applied to the sections at 4 °C for overnight. After washing with PBS five times for 5 min, the sections were incubated with Alexa 488-goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) 1:250 in PBS at room temperature for 2 h. After washing with PBS five time for 5 min, the sections were air-dried and coverslipped with VectaShield (Vector). When fluorescent Nissl counter stain was desired, the sections were washed an additional three times for 10 min in PBS and for 10 min in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100. NeuroTrace™ red fluorescence Nissl stain (Molecular Probes) 1:100 solution in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 was applied to the sections at room temperature for 20 min. Then the sections were washed for 10 min in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100, followed by three washes for 10 min and one 2-h wash with PBS. Finally, the sections were air-dried and coverslipped with VectaShield (Vector). The slides were viewed under Leica microscope, and the images were captured by Leica TCS SP2 laser scanning confocal microscope with proper filter sets (Leica, Germany). RT-PCR Analysis—Spinal cord lumbar segments, retina, and liver tissues from wild-type or rho1-/- mice were homogenized in Ultraspec RNA reagent (Biotecx Laboratories, Houston, TX). RNA samples were then extracted and purified. After treatment with DNase I, 1 μg of each RNA sample was reverse transcribed into cDNA using 1 μm of oligo(dT) primer and 2 units of Omniscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen). 0.25 or 0.5 μg of cDNA was used in the subsequent PCRs with a pair of ρ1 gene-specific primers (forward, 5′-GAATCTATGTTGGCTGTCCAGA-3′; reverse, 5′-TGGTGTGGAATTCTTGAATGAG-3′). PCRs were run for 40 cycles with 94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. 40 ng of the same cDNA samples was used in control PCRs with primers specific to the mouse GAPDH gene. All PCR products were visualized in 0.9% agarose gels after electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. Mouse GABACReceptor ρ1Subunit Gene, Targeting Construct, and Embryonic Stem Cell Homologous Recombinants—Two oligonucleotide primers were used in PCRs using mouse 129 genomic DNA as template. The sequences of these primers are 5′-GTTGGCTGTCCAGAATATGAAAT-3′ and 5′-CTTTCCTAGATGGCTCATGAAC-3′, respectively (39Greka A. Koolen J.A. Lipton S.A. Zhang D. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The resulting 120-bp PCR product containing part of the ρ1 gene first exon was used to clone mouse ρ1 gene and its flanking sequences from a 129 genomic library. To make the gene targeting construct, four pieces of DNA were ligated together. With plasmid pBluescript (Stratagene) as the backbone, a 3.8-kb BamHI-EcoRI fragment from the 5′ end of the ρ1 gene, a 1.8-kb DNA containing a neo gene driven by the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter, and a 5.5-kb XbaI fragment from 3′ of the ρ1 first exon were assembled in order. To obtain homologous recombinants, mouse J1 embryonic stem (ES) cells were transfected with 50 μg of linearized targeting construct by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser at 800 V and 3 microfarads. G418 selection was applied 24 h after the transfection at 200 μg/ml. G418-resistant colonies were picked 6 days after transfection (40Xu M. Moratalla R. Gold L.H. Hiroi N. Koob G.F. Graybiel A.M. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1994; 79: 729-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA from the ES cell colonies was analyzed by NcoI digestion and hybridization with a 3′ ρ1 gene-specific probe. rho1-/-Mice—Three identified homologous recombinant ES cell clones were amplified and subsequently injected into blastocysts isolated from C57BL/6 female mice. The injected blastocysts were implanted back into the uteri of B6 × DBA2 F1 foster mothers (40Xu M. Moratalla R. Gold L.H. Hiroi N. Koob G.F. Graybiel A.M. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1994; 79: 729-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The resulting male chimeric mice were bred repeatedly with C57BL/6 females, and germ-line transmission was identified initially by screening for agouti offspring. Mice heterozygous for the ρ1 gene mutation were confirmed by genomic Southern analyses of DNA isolated from their tail biopsies. Finally, mice homozygous for the ρ1 gene mutation were produced by crossing heterozygous mutants. The genotypes of those animals were identified by Southern analyses with a 3′ probe and were further confirmed by an exon 1 probe. Mutants and their wild-type and heterozygous control littermates 8 weeks of age were used in all subsequent analyses. Recording of Spinal Cord Response—Spinal cord preparations were obtained from 8-week-old rho1+/+ and rho1-/- mice. The animals were anesthetized by intraperitoneal administration of 10% urethane (0.3–0.5 ml). An incision was made on the back of the mouse, and the spinal cord lumbar segment (L2–L6) was dissected out. The isolated spinal cord was transferred in ice-cold Kreb's solution composed of 115 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 11 mm glucose, pH 7.4. The spinal cord preparation was placed in a perfusion voltage clamp chamber with the dorsal side up. The chamber was grounded through an agar bridge connected with an Ag/AgCl wire. Stimulation pulse (0.1 ms, 0.01 Hz, 5–10 V) was delivered by a stimulating electrode to the L3–L5 dorsal root. A glass recording electrode containing Kreb's solution was placed in the dorsal region of the spinal cord, and light suction was applied into the electrode. Spinal cord depolarization potential was recorded by a direct current-coupled amplifier (Axon labs, Foster City, CA). The data were filtered through a 4-pole filter at 1 kHz and stored in a digital recorder (32Rozzo A. Ballerini L. Nistri A. Neuroscience. 1999; 90: 1085-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Mechanical Pain Sensitivity—A set of force-calibrated von Frey filaments (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL) was used to assess mechanical pain sensitivity (41Chaplan S.R. Bach F.W. Pogrel J.W. Chung J.M. Yaksh T.L. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1994; 53: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (5621) Google Scholar, 42Laughlin T.M. Vanderah T.W. Lashbrook J. Nichols M.L. Ossipov M. Porreca F. Wilcox G.L. Pain. 1997; 72: 253-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The mice were placed on a wire mesh platform inside individual round plastic containers (7 cm in diameter) and allowed to acclimate for 30 min before the test. A series of von Frey filaments (0.09–6 g) were applied through the wire mesh onto the hairless plantar surface of a hind paw. A response was indicated by the brisk withdrawal or flinching of the paw. In the absence of a response, the filament of the next greater force was used. In the presence of a response, the filament of the next lower force was used. Each monofilament was applied five times at 30-s intervals to each hind paw, and the response threshold was defined as the lowest force that caused at least three withdrawals of the five consecutive applications. Data Analysis—The results are shown as the means ± S.E. Student's t test and analysis of variance were performed to determine significant differences. Statistic significance was considered as p < 0.05. Expression of GABA Receptor/Channel ρ1Subunit in Spinal Cord and DRG—Total RNA samples from mouse spinal cord, retina, and liver tissues were analyzed with RT-PCR using ρ1-specific primers. The results clearly demonstrated the presence of ρ1 subunit expression in the spinal cord. The specificity of the PCR products was affirmed by the positive control obtained from the retina RNA sample and by the negative control obtained from the liver RNA sample. The integrity of RNA samples was assured by the intactness of control GAPDH gene products (Fig. 1A). Our result was consistent with previous findings of the existence of the ρ1 subunit in the spinal cord of mice (23Wegelius K. Pasternack M. Hiltunen J.O. Rivera C. Kaila K. Saarma M. Reeben M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 26Rozzo A. Armellin M. Franzot J. Chiaruttini C. Nistri A. Tongiorgi E. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 15: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The precise localizations of the GABA receptor/channel ρ1 subunit were studied using immunohistochemistry. GABA receptor/channel ρ subunit immunoreactivity revealed distinct punctate immunofluorescence in lamina I and II (LI and LII) of the superficial dorsal horn, as well as in ventral LIX motoneurons (Fig. 1B). Immunoreactivity of ρ1 subunit was most abundant in the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord, labeling LI or LII neurons, and the surrounding network of neuronal processes and synaptic terminals (Fig. 1, B and C). On LI and LII neurons, ρ1 subunit immunoreactivity displayed continuous membrane labeling (Fig. 1C). Because abundant ρ1 subunit immunoreactivity was exhibited in LI and LII where the primary afferent fibers are known to terminate, cell bodies of primary sensory neurons in the DRG were also examined for ρ1 subunit immunoreactivity. Noticeably, a considerable amount of ρ1 subunit immunoreactivity was detected in DRG neurons (Fig. 1B). Generation of rho1-/-Mice—A restriction map of the first exon of the ρ1 gene and its flanking sequences is shown in Fig. 2A. Sequence analysis indicated that the first exon of the ρ1 gene includes the entire published 5′-untranslated region and 105 bp of coding region. The cloned first exon is 100% identical to the published mouse ρ1 sequence (39Greka A. Koolen J.A. Lipton S.A. Zhang D. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The gene targeting construct was designed to delete a 2.5-kb genomic DNA sequence including the first exon of the ρ1 gene and a portion of its promoter region (Fig. 2A) that will disrupt the transcription of the gene. To assemble the targeting construct, a BamHI-EcoRI fragment from the 5′ end of the ρ1 gene and a XbaI fragment from the 3′ of the ρ1 gene first exon were ligated to the 5′ and the 3′ ends of a selectable marker (Fig. 2A). When homologous recombination takes place, one allele of the ρ1 gene exon 1 is replaced by the neo gene, and this recombination creates a shift of the NcoI fragment from its native 7.5 kb to 6.5 kb when detected by a 3′ end probe (Fig. 2, A and B). After transfection with the gene targeting construct and G418 selection, we picked and screened the ES cell colonies for homologous recombinants by genomic Southern analysis using the 3′ probe. Twelve ES cell clones harboring the desired homologous recombination were identified. ES cells amplified from three of the homologous recombinants were used to generate male chimeric mice, which were bred with C57BL/6 females to obtain heterozygous mutant mice (rho1+/-). rho1-/- mice were obtained by sibling mating of heterozygotes. The genotypes of the mice were identified by genomic Southern blotting with the 3′ probe. rho1-/- mice were identified with a single 6.5-kb band, a shift from the single 7.5-kb band from the rho1+/+ mice, whereas the rho1+/- mice showed double bands with both sizes (Fig. 2B). The desired gene mutation was further confirmed by genomic Southern blotting with the exon 1 probe, showing the successful deletion of the ρ1 gene first exon from the genome of rho1-/- mice (Fig. 2C). As expected, the deletion of the first exon and part of the promoter region from the mouse genome disrupted the transcription of the ρ1 gene completely, which was clearly demonstrated by RT-PCR assays. Total RNA from spinal cord lumbar segments and retina was subjected to analysis, and the integrity of the RNA samples was assured by the intactness of control GAPDH gene products (Fig. 3). Our result confirmed that the ρ1 subunit was absent from spinal cord in rho1-/- mice (Fig. 3). The ρ1 subunit gene transcripts were also missing from the retina in rho1-/- mice (Fig. 3). Thus, deletion of the ρ1 gene first exon and its promoter region disrupted the gene transcription, and consequently the expression of the ρ1 subunit was abolished in rho1-/- mice. rho1-/- mice appeared healthy and did not show obvious growth abnormalities compared with their wild-type or heterozygous littermates. Both male and female rho1-/- mice were fertile, and the rho1-/- females nursed their offspring until they were weaned and separated from the parents at 3 weeks after birth. Alteration of GABA Effects on Spinal Cord Response in rho1-/-Mice—To investigate the consequences of the ρ1 gene mutation, we used current clamp to compare the effect of GABA on spinal cord responses. Polysynaptic reflexes were elicited by delivering a stimulatory pulse to L3–L5 dorsal roots through a stimulating electrode in the absence and presence of GABA (500 μm). Spinal cord responses were characterized by a depolarization potential (upward deflections) measured though a recording electrode located in the dorsal root region (Fig. 4). These depolarization potentials may be caused by direct responses of spinal cord neurons or via a local network of interneurons. Upon application of GABA in the spinal cord of rho1+/+ mice, the spinal cord response was significantly inhibited in wild-type mice (p < 0.05) but was less inhibited in rho1-/- mice (Fig. 4A). This inhibitory effect of GABA on the depolarization potential was decreased by applications of 10 μm TPMPA in the current clamp chamber (p < 0.05, comparing GABA with and without TPMPA; Fig. 4B). However, application of TPMPA alone did not affect the depolarization potential (p > 0.1, comparing control to TPMPA alone). In contrast, in rho1-/- mice the effect of GABA on depolarization potentials was much less effective than in rho1+/+ mice (p < 0.05), and TPMPA had no effect on the GABA-mediated inhibition of depolarization potentials in the spinal cord (p > 0.1; Fig. 4B). Depolarization potential recorded from wild-type and rho1-/- mice were traced and amplified to overlap each other in a proportionally enlarged scale to compare altered responses among these mice (Fig. 4C). Statistical analysis demonstrated that there was a significant effect of TPMPA on the GA"

We have determined the crystal structure of PGI from Pyrococcus furiosus in native form and in complex with two active site ligands, 5-phosphoarabinonate and gluconate 6-phosphate. In these structures, the metal ion, which in vivo is presumed to be Fe2+, is located in the core of the cupin fold and is immediately adjacent to the C1-C2 region of the ligands, suggesting that Fe2+ is involved in catalysis rather than serving a structural role. The active site contains a glutamate residue that contacts the substrate, but, because it is also coordinated to the metal ion, it is highly unlikely to mediate proton transfer in a cis-enediol mechanism. Consequently, we propose a hydride shift mechanism of catalysis. In this mechanism, Fe2+ is responsible for proton transfer between O1 and O2, and the hydride shift between C1 and C2 is favored by a markedly hydrophobic environment in the active site. The absence of any obvious enzymatic machinery for catalyzing ring opening of the sugar substrates suggests that pyrococcal PGI has a preference for straight chain substrates and that metabolism in extreme thermophiles may use sugars in both ring and straight chain forms.

The enzyme is represented by two evolutionarily distinct protein families. In eubacteria, eukaryotes, and a few archaea, the enzyme is of the conventional type that has been studied extensively at the biochemical and structural level. To date, the second, novel type has been found in two Euryarchaeota species, Pyrococcus furiosus and Thermococcus litoralis (1Hansen T. Oehlmann M. Schönheit P. J.

This is markedly smaller than conventional PGI; for instance, the enzyme from P. furiosus comprises a dimer of 43 kDa (1Hansen T. Oehlmann M. Schönheit P. J.

Based on sequence alignments, it has been suggested that the novel type of PGI contains a cupin fold (2Verhees C.H. Huynen M.A. Ward D.E. Schiltz E. de Vos W.M. van der Oost J. J. Biol.

Fushinobu S. Ito S. Jeon B.S. Shoun H. Wakagi T. FEBS Lett. 2003; 535: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). phosphoglucose isomerase fructose 6-phosphate glucose 6-phosphate gluconate 6-phosphate 5-phosphoarabinonate Pyrococcus furiosus phosphoglucose isomerase. The reaction catalyzed by PGI is an aldose-ketose isomerization in which a hydrogen atom is transferred between the C1 and C2 positions of the substrate. A second hydrogen, in the form of a proton, also moves between the O1 and O2. The carbon-bound hydrogen can move by one of two mechanisms, a hydride shift or a proton transfer via a cis-enediol intermediate (6Rose I.A. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1975; 43: 491-517PubMed Google Scholar). In isomerases that contain a metal ion at the catalytic center the mechanism appears to be a hydride shift, e.g. xylose isomerase (7Whitlow M. Howard A.J. Finzel B.C. Poulos T.L. Winbourne E. Gilliland G.L. Proteins. 1991; 9: 153-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), whereas isomerases without a metal cofactor use the cis-enediol mechanism (6Rose I.A. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1975; 43: 491-517PubMed Google Scholar). Conventional PGI does not require a metal for activity and, accordingly, operates via an acid-base mechanism involving a cis-enediol intermediate (see Ref. 6Rose I.A. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1975; 43: 491-517PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian PGIs, an active site glutamate (Glu-357) is the base catalyst for isomerization, and His-388 is the acid catalyst for ring opening (8Lee J.H. Chang K.Z. Patel V. Jeffery C.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7799-7805Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 9Read J. Pearce J. Li X. Muirhead H. Chirgwin J. Davies C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 447-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 10Jeffery C.J. Hardre R. Salmon L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1560-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Along with its enzymatic properties, PGI from mammalian sources exhibits the properties of a cytokine (11Watanabe H. Takehana K. Date M. Shinozaki T. Raz A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2960-2963PubMed Google Scholar, 12Xu W. Seiter K. Feldman E. Ahmed T. Chiao J.W. Blood. 1996; 87: 4502-4506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given the structural differences between the two types of PGI, the catalytic mechanism of the novel PGI is likely to be distinct from that of conventional PGI. One question is whether the metal ion in the cupin fold mediates a hydride transfer mechanism or whether it serves a structural role. Although the recent crystal structure of the enzyme from P. furiosus confirmed the cupin-based fold (4Berrisford J.M. Akerboom J. Turnbull A.P. DeGeus D. Sedelnikova S.E. Staton I. McLeod C.W. Verhees C.H. van der Oost J. Rice D.W. Baker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33290-33297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), in the absence of any data from crystals in complex with either substrate or inhibitor, little could be inferred regarding the active site or of the residues responsible for catalysis. To decipher the catalytic mechanism of these novel PGIs, we have determined the crystal structure of PGI from P. furiosus (PfPGI) in complex with the inhibitors 5-phosphoarabinonate (PAB) and gluconate 6-phosphate (6PG). These structures provide evidence for a hydride mechanism of hydrogen transfer. PfPGI used for this study was cloned and expressed from Escherichia coli as described previously (1Hansen T. Oehlmann M. Schönheit P. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3428-3435Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), except that a pet17b expression vector was used in place of pBAD. Previously, we reported on crystals of PfPGI grown in space group P21 (13Swan M.K. Hansen T. Schönheit P. Davies C. Protein Pept. Lett. 2003; 10: 517-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), but those used here were of a second form that belongs to space group P1. These crystals were grown by vapor diffusion using the hanging drop method. They were cryoprotected over a period of several hours by passage through a series of stabilizing solutions (25% polyethylene glycol 4000 and 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.6) containing increasing amounts of glycerol in 2% increments up to a maximum of 26%. The crystals were then flash frozen in situ in the cryostream (X-Stream 2000; Rigaku-MSC). Diffraction data were recorded with an RAXIS-IV++ imaging plate system (Rigaku-MSC) mounted on a Rigaku RU-H3R copper rotating anode generator operating at 50 kV and 100 mA. The x-ray beam was conditioned with Confocal Maxflux™ optics (Osmic Inc.). The crystal-to-plate distance was set at 120 mm, and 360° data were recorded in 1° oscillations with an exposure time of 4 min per frame. The data were scaled and reduced using d*Trek (14Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using MOLREP (15Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4173) Google Scholar). For the search model a dimer was constructed by applying a symmetry operation to the published coordinates of native PfPGI (4Berrisford J.M. Akerboom J. Turnbull A.P. DeGeus D. Sedelnikova S.E. Staton I. McLeod C.W. Verhees C.H. van der Oost J. Rice D.W. Baker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33290-33297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (PDB accession number 1PLZ), which crystallized, with one subunit in the asymmetric unit, in space group C2. The preliminary model was refined using REFMAC (16Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13910) Google Scholar), water molecules were added using ARP/wARP (17Perrakis A. Harkiolaki M. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1445-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), and, thereafter, the structure was refined by alternating rounds of REFMAC and manual fitting using O (18Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Crystals of PfPGI were soaked separately in solutions containing the inhibitors 5-phosphoarabinonate (19Chirgwin J.M. Noltmann E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7272-7276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or gluconate 6-phosphate. Data were collected from these crystals in the same manner as for native data except that the exposure time was 3 min per frame and ∼250° were collected per data set. After an initial refinement using REFMAC, the presence of the inhibitor was revealed using difference Fourier maps calculated using Fo - Fc amplitudes. If present, the ligand was incorporated into the model, and the structure was refined using REFMAC and O. The stereochemistry of all the structures was assessed using PROCHECK (20Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Coordinates and structure factors for all three structures have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank with the following accession numbers: native, 1QXJ; PAB, 1QXR; and 6PG, 1QY4. Native Structure Determination—Previously, we reported on crystals of PfPGI grown from polyethylene glycol 4000 that belonged to space group P21 (13Swan M.K. Hansen T. Schönheit P. Davies C. Protein Pept. Lett. 2003; 10: 517-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a second crystal form was obtained over wells containing 25% polyethylene glycol 4000 (w/v) and 0.2 m ammonium acetate and buffered with 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.6. This is similar to the previous condition, except that ammonium acetate was used in place of magnesium chloride. The crystals belong to space group P1 with cell dimensions a = 36.0 Å, b = 39.7 Å, c = 74.7 Å, α = 73.7°, β = 78.5°, and γ = 72.6° and diffract to at least 1.7 Å. The asymmetric unit in this crystal form is a dimer of PfPGI (corresponding to a solvent content of 45%; Ref. 21Matthews B. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7926) Google Scholar), whereas for the published native structure it is one subunit of the dimer (4Berrisford J.M. Akerboom J. Turnbull A.P. DeGeus D.

The structure was solved by molecular replacement, and the statistics of the final refined model at 1.8 Å resolution are shown in Table I. All residues are visible in the electron density except two at the C terminus.

Akerboom J. Turnbull A.P. DeGeus D. Sedelnikova S.E. Staton I. McLeod C.W. Verhees C.H. van der Oost J. Rice D.W. Baker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33290-33297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, the structure is dominated by the cupin domain, which is a sandwich of two β sheets (Fig. 1) in the shape of a barrel. The secondary structure was calculated using the DSSP program (22Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12413) Google Scholar) and is shown in Fig. 1c. This varies slightly from that described for the previous structure because of marginal differences in the assignment of β strands. The structure begins with a segment that is separate from the cupin domain, comprising a β strand (β1) followed by a β hairpin (β2 and β3). In the cupin domain, one sheet comprises β4, β5, β6, β13, and β17 (sheet 1), and the second sheet comprises β9, β11, β12, and β14 (sheet 2). Located between β4 and β5 are two segments of α helical structure (α1 and α2). A third helix, α3, is between β15 and β16. There are additional β hairpins that are not part of the cupin sandwich; β5 and β6 form a connection between the two sheets of the sandwich, and β15 and β16 form the C terminus of the protein. The two monomers in the dimer are essentially identical; they can be superimposed with a root mean square deviation between all main chain atoms of 0.30 Å. The only significant structural differences occur in two regions as follows: 1) residues 18-20, which form the connection between the β1-β2-β3 segment and the main body of the molecule; and 2) residues 45-46 (α2-β5 connection). Both monomers also superimpose very closely with the published native structure (4Berrisford J.M. Akerboom J. Turnbull A.P. DeGeus D. Sedelnikova S.E. Staton I. McLeod C.W. Verhees C.H. van der Oost J. Rice D.W. Baker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33290-33297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar); the root mean square deviation in common main chain atoms is 0.50 Å for monomer A and 0.41 Å for monomer B. The principal structural differences also lie in the 18-20 region. Dimer Interface—As determined by gel filtration, the native form of PfPGI is a dimer (1Hansen T. Oehlmann M. Schönheit P. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3428-3435Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 2Verhees C.H. Huynen M.A. Ward D.E. Schiltz E. de Vos W.M. van der Oost J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40926-40932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and in the crystal form used for our structure determination the protein crystallized as a dimer in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 1b). The dimer interface is formed by the packing of sheet 1 against its partner from the other monomer. Interestingly β1 of monomer A is a member of sheet 1 from monomer B and vice versa, creating a six-stranded sheet. This is a another example of so-called domain swapping (23Ostermeier M. Benkovic S.J. Adv. Protein Chem. 2000; 55: 29-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that likely contributes to the overall stability of the enzyme. The interface region is populated almost exclusively with hydrophobic residues, predominantly valines, leucines, and phenylalanines. There is one electrostatic interaction, between Lys-3 and Asp-65, which is repeated at each edge of the interface. Because Lys-3 is part of β1, this “intermolecular” contact is actually mediated via residues that belong to the same monomer. Iron Binding Site—Members of the cupin family typically contain a metal ion, which in many cases is essential for function (for review, see Ref. 5Dunwell J.M. Khuri S. Gane P.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 153-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The metal binding site is located in the core of the cupin barrel, and, in the majority of cases, the metal ion is coordinated by three histidines and one glutamate. The crystal structure of native PfPGI as reported previously (4Berrisford J.M. Akerboom J. Turnbull A.P. DeGeus D. Sedelnikova S.E. Staton I. McLeod C.W. Verhees C.H. van der Oost J. Rice D.W. Baker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33290-33297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) did not contain any bound metals, but this was attributed to the use of EDTA during protein purification. Zn2+ and Mn2+ were introduced through crystal soaking experiments, and this confirmed the presence of a metal binding site in the same location as observed in other members of the cupin family (4Berrisford J.M. Akerboom J. Turnbull A.P. DeGeus D. Sedelnikova S.E. Staton I. McLeod C.W. Verhees C.H. van der Oost J. Rice D.W. Baker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33290-33297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In our structure, a strong peak of electron density is observed in the protein core surrounded by the same constellation of residues, i.e. His-88, His-90, His-136, and Glu-97 (Fig. 2). Two additional coordination positions are occupied by apparent water molecules. The coordination distances around the metal in both monomers range between 2.1 and 2.3 Å; the closest coordination is to an ϵ oxygen of Glu-97 (2.1 Å). The identity of this metal depends on both the source of protein and its purification procedure. Analysis of the recombinant protein by atomic absorption spectroscopy showed 0.39 mol of nickel and 0.04 mol of iron per mol of protein.2 These two atoms are very similar in mass and are indistinguishable in the electron density maps. Accordingly, we modeled this density as nickel and, after refinement, the resulting Fo - Fc difference density in this region was flat in monomer A, and there was only a slight peak of negative density in molecule B, showing that this was a reasonable interpretation. Because both metal binding sites were close to fully occupied, the protein must have chelated additional metal ions from impurities in the buffers used for crystallization. The native enzyme in vivo presumably binds iron, and, given the reducing environment in which P. furiosus is found, this must exist in the reduced state i.e. 2+. This is supported by metal depletion experiments, which show that the activity of EDTA-treated PfPGI can be restored by the addition of Fe2+. 2T. Hansen and P. Schönheit, unpublished results. Irrespective of the identity of the metal ion, the catalytic mechanism (presented below) is the same. Complex with 5-Phosphoarabinonate—PAB is a well known competitive inhibitor in the conventional family of PGI enzymes that is presumed to mimic the cis-enediol intermediate of the reaction (19Chirgwin J.M. Noltmann E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7272-7276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Compared with G6P or F6P, it contains a carboxylate group in place of C2, O2, and C1; an atom directly equivalent to O1 is absent. To locate the active site of PfPGI and develop an understanding of the catalytic mechanism, we determined the structure of PfPGI in complex with PAB at 1.7 Å resolution (Table I). This structure was generated very easily after a single soaking experiment in 6 mm of PAB. An electron density map calculated using Fo - Fc coefficients reveals the inhibitor molecule bound inside the cupin fold between the two sheets (Fig. 4a). The location is in agreement with the active sites in other enzymes containing a cupin fold e.g. oxalate decarboxylase (24Anand R. Dorrestein P.C. Kinsland C. Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7659-7669Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The binding of PAB to each monomer is essentially identical. The inhibitor is bound such that the carboxylate group contacts both the metal ion and Glu-97, thus demonstrating that Fe2+ in the native enzyme in vivo is intimately involved with catalysis rather than simply serving a structural role. The carboxylate oxygens of PAB have been designated as O1A and O1B (Fig. 4b). Of the two water moleculess coordinated to the metal ion, one has been displaced by O1A, whereas the other water molecule is still present and is within hydrogen-bonding distance of both O1A and O1B (Fig. 4b). O1A is also within hydrogen-bonding distance of the side chain hydroxyl group of Tyr-99 and His-88. Interestingly, O1B of the PAB molecule lies very close (2.1 Å) to the side chain carbonyl of Glu-97. This close proximity is permitted by the neutrality of the carbonyl group and by the fact that the negative charge of the carboxylate group of PAB will be compensated by the metal ion. At the other end of the inhibitor molecule, the phosphate group is coordinated through hydrogen-bonding interactions with the side chains of Tyr-160, Tyr-52, and His-88 as well as with the amide of Gly-87 and one water molecule. The intervening section of the inhibitor makes no direct contacts with the enzyme, with the exception of O4, which contacts Thr-71.Fig. 4The structure of the PfPGI in complex with PAB at 1.7 Å resolution.a, stereo view showing PAB bound to the active site region of PfPGI. Monomer B of the dimer is shown, but the contacts are essentially the same in monomer A. The electron density is a Fo - Fc difference map calculated from the final coordinates refined in the absence of ligand and thus represents unbiased density of PAB. The side chains of those residues surrounding the ligand are shown in ball-and-stick form in which carbons are yellow, oxygens are red, and nitrogens are blue. The metal ion atom, denoted M, is shown as an orange sphere, and water molecules are shown as red spheres. Potential hydrogen bonding and coordination contacts are shown as dashed lines.

The inhibitor is colored green.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Complex with Gluconate 6-Phosphate—To determine the catalytic mechanism, the face of the substrate along which the hydrogen is transferred must be identified i.e. the configuration at C1 or C2 needs to be established unambiguously. PAB is less than ideal for this purpose because the equivalent to the C1 position is occupied by an oxygen, and the C2 position is trigonal planar in geometry. 6PG is an intermediate of the pentose phosphate pathway that inhibits both conventional and novel type PGIs (25Dyson J.E.D. Noltmann E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1401-1414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).2 It is a better probe than PAB because, like G6P and F6P, it is a six-carbon molecule, whereas PAB is one carbon shorter (Fig. 3). It differs from straight chain G6P by having a carboxylate in place of the aldehyde group at C1. Most importantly, it has tetrahedral geometry at C2 and, thus, shows the orientation of the transferred hydrogen. Following crystal soaking experiments, a structure of PfPGI in complex with 6PG was solved at 1.8-Å resolution. The quality of the Fo - Fc electron density permitted easy fitting of the whole molecule with the exception of C4, where a lack of density indicated some flexibility in this region of the inhibitor (Fig. 5). Repeat experiments using higher molarities of 6PG and longer crystal soaking times gave the same results (data not shown). Nevertheless a small peak of difference density was sufficient to position C4-O4, and, after refinement, the 2(Fo - Fc)density showed an excellent fit (not shown). Importantly, the tetrahedral shape of the density made assignment of the C2 position facile and shows that its hydrogen projects downwards into the active site rather than outward toward the solvent. Interestingly, this region of the active site is markedly hydrophobic in character, comprising Tyr-152, Ala-69, Ala-150, and, to a lesser extent, Phe-148 and Tyr-99. As with PAB, the carboxylate oxygens of 6PG have been designated O1A and O1B. Examination of the ligand-enzyme contacts shows that the carboxylate group of 6PG binds somewhat differently to that of PAB, likely because of the longer length of 6PG. Most notably, both of the water molecules coordinated to the metal ion in the native structure have been displaced by O1A and O2. The inclusion of these atoms in the coordination shell of the metal ion may mimic the binding of O1 and O2 of the substrate molecules (Fig. 5b). The close contact seen between O1B and Glu-97 in the PAB-bound structure is lost, and, instead, Glu-97 is now much closer to the metal ion. In fact, in monomer B, the ϵ oxygen of Glu-97 is only 1.4 Å from the metal ion, which suggests that this interaction is essentially a covalent bond. The equivalent distance in monomer A is 1.7 Å, and, interestingly, this is the only instance where contacts vary between the two active sites in the dimer, albeit slightly and close to the coordinate error in a typical crystal structure. The only other significant difference with the PAB-bound structure is a new interaction between O1B of 6PG and His-158. The remaining enzyme-inhibitor contacts are essentially the same as those for PAB, including the phosphate group and the interaction between O5 (O4 in PAB) and Thr-71. Conformational Changes upon Ligand Binding—In conventional PGI, a number of conformational changes associated with ligand binding have been described (9Read J. Pearce J. Li X. Muirhead H. Chirgwin J.

However, the identification of P2 receptors subtypes and their native ligands, and the distribution and function of these receptors within the secretory and non-secretory pituitary cells has been incompletely characterized. The focus in this study was on lactotroph subpopulation of cells. ATP and ADP, but not UTP and UDP, triggered calcium signaling in a majority (85%) of lactotrophs and prolactin release in mixed pituitary cells. Consistent with the role of P2 receptors in signaling and secretion, the actions of ATP and ADP were abolished in the presence of apyrase, an ectonucleotidase. Transcripts for Gq-coupled calcium-mobilizing P2Y1R, P2Y2R, P2Y4R, and P2Y6R, as well as Gi-coupled P2Y12R, were identified in mixed anterior pituitary cells. The ligand-selectivity profile of calcium mobilization-dependent signaling and prolactin secretion and the blockade of these responses by pyridoxal 5-phosphate 6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulphonic acid indicated that P2Y1R mediates the stimulatory action of ATP and ADP. Within the channels expressed in anterior pituitary (P2X2R, P2X3R, P2X4R, and P2X7R), the P2X4R subtype provides a major pathway for calcium influx-dependent signaling and prolactin secretion. This conclusion was based on comparison of native to recombinant channels with respect to their ligand preference, sensitivity to pyridoxal 5-phosphate 6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulphonic acid, and the rates of calcium signal desensitization.

This conclusion was based on comparison of native to recombinant channels with respect to their ligand preference, sensitivity to pyridoxal 5-phosphate 6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulphonic acid, and the rates of calcium signal desensitization. Purines (adenosine, ADP, and ATP) and pyrimidines (UDP and UTP) are not only important intracellular molecules, but also function as extracellular messengers by activating distinct plasma membrane receptors. These receptors were termed “purinergic” in the seventies and belong to two groups: P1 receptors (P1Rs) 1The abbreviations used are: P1Radenosine receptorP2Rnucleotide receptorPRLprolactinTRHthyrotrophin releasing hormoneP2XRnucleotide receptor-channelP2YRG protein-coupled nucleotide receptorsαβ-meATPαβ-methylene-ATPBzATP3′-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl-ATP2-MeSATP2-methylthio-ATPPPADSpyridoxal 5-phosphate 6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulphonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: P1Radenosine receptorP2Rnucleotide receptorPRLprolactinTRHthyrotrophin releasing hormoneP2XRnucleotide receptor-channelP2YRG protein-coupled nucleotide receptorsαβ-meATPαβ-methylene-ATPBzATP3′-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl-ATP2-MeSATP2-methylthio-ATPPPADSpyridoxal 5-phosphate 6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulphonic acid. that are activated by adenosine and P2 receptors (P2Rs) that recognize mainly ADP, ATP, UDP, and UTP. Four subtypes comprise the P1R family of G protein-coupled receptors, termed A1, A2A, A2B, and A3, whereas P2Rs are composed of two families: the ligand-gated channels (P2XR) and the G protein-coupled receptors (P2YR). To date, seven functional channels (P2X1 to P2X7) and six receptors (P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, P2Y6, P2Y11, and P2Y12) have been identified in mammals (1Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar, 2North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2458) Google Scholar, 3Khakh B.S. Burnstock G. Kennedy C. King B.F. North R.A. Seguela P. Voigt M. Humphrey P.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 107-118PubMed Google Scholar). P2Rs are expressed in a variety of non-excitable and excitable tissues. Three lines of previously published evidence also indicate that an extracellular nucleotide-controlled signaling system is expressed and operative in anterior pituitary cells. First, ATP is co-stored with hormones in secretory vesicles and co-secreted by anterior pituitary cells (4Tomic M. Jobin R.M. Vergara L.A. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21200-21208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 5Chen Z.-P. Kratzmeier M. Levy A. McArdle C.A. Poch A. Day A. Mukhopadhyay A.K. Lightman S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5219-5223Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Second, P1Rs, P2YRs, and P2XRs are expressed in these cells and their activation leads to amplification of calcium signals and secretion triggered by hypothalamic neurohormones (6Stojilkovic S.S.

Third, the autocrine/paracrine actions of ATP are controlled by ectonucleotidases (4Tomic M. Jobin R.M. Vergara L.A. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21200-21208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These enzymes degrade extracellular ATP in a sequential manner to adenosine (9Zimmermann H. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2000; 362: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar) and thus provide a pathway for activation of P1Rs. adenosine receptor nucleotide receptor prolactin thyrotrophin releasing hormone nucleotide receptor-channel G protein-coupled nucleotide receptors αβ-methylene-ATP 3′-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl-ATP 2-methylthio-ATP pyridoxal 5-phosphate 6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulphonic acid. adenosine receptor nucleotide receptor prolactin thyrotrophin releasing hormone nucleotide receptor-channel G protein-coupled nucleotide receptors αβ-methylene-ATP 3′-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl-ATP 2-methylthio-ATP pyridoxal 5-phosphate 6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulphonic acid. The expression of P1R subtypes in pituitary cells, their distribution within the secretory and non-secretory pituitary cells, and their physiological roles are relatively well characterized (7Rees D.A. Scanlon M.F. Ham J. Clin. Sci. 2003; 104: 467-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 8Rees D.A. Scanlon M.F. Ham J. J. Endocrinol. 2003; 177: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A substantial progress was also made in characterizing the P2R signaling pathway in pituitary. The presence of P2YRs was initially observed in a mixed population of sheep pituitary cells (10Van Der Merwe P.A. Wakefield I.K. Fine J. Millar R.P. Davidson J.S. FEBS Lett. 1989; 243: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11Davidson J.S. Wakefield I.K. Sohnius U. Van Der Merwe P.A. Millar R.P. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Rat pituitary cells also express P2YRs and their activation by ATP is associated with an elevation in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) due to release of calcium from intracellular stores (12Carew M.A. Wu M.-L. Law G.J. Tseng Y.-Z. Mason W.T. Cell Calcium. 1994; 16: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 13Chen Z.-P. Levy A. McArdle C.A. Lightman S.L.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 248-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Molecular cloning and functional characterization of rat P2YRs in the pituitary revealed the expression of P2Y2R with the pharmacological profile resembling the one observed in sheep pituitary cells (15Chen Z.-P. Krull N. Xu L. Levy A. Lightman S.L. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1833-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). More recent studies have also suggested the presence of P2XRs in normal and immortalized pituitary cells (4Tomic M. Jobin R.M. Vergara L.A. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21200-21208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 16Villalobos C. Alonso-Torre S.R. Nunez L. Garcia-Sancho J. Am. J.

Initially, the mRNA messages for P2X2aR and its spliced form, P2X2bR, were identified in pituitary cells (18Koshimizu T. Tomic M. Van Goor F. Stojilkovic S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 901-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 19Koshimizu T. Tomic M. Koshimizu M. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12853-12857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 20Brake A.J. Wagenbach M.J. Julius D. Nature. 1994; 371: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). This was followed by discovery of P2X3R, P2X4R, and P2X7R in these cells (21Koshimizu T. Tomic M. Wong A.O.L. Zivadinovic D. Stojilkovic S.S. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4091-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Several important questions regarding the functional operation of nucleotide receptor signaling system in pituitary have not been addressed. For example, in contrast to P2XRs (21Koshimizu T. Tomic M. Wong A.O.L. Zivadinovic D. Stojilkovic S.S. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4091-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the expression of P2YR subtypes and their distribution within the secretory and non-secretory pituitary cells has not been studied. The characterization of calcium signaling by P2Rs other than P2Y2R (15Chen Z.-P. Krull N. Xu L. Levy A. Lightman S.L. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1833-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) is at a preliminary stage, as well as the nature of relationship between plasma membrane current and calcium signaling. The recombinant P2XRs expressed in an excitable cell generate global calcium signals (22He M.-L. Zemkova H. Koshimizu T.-A. Tomic M. Stojilkovic S.S. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 285: C467-C479Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), suggesting that nuclear and cytoplasmic cellular functions, including exocytosis, should be affected. Yet, only limited information is available about the relevance of nucleotide receptor-mediated calcium signaling in secretion, and their potential role in other cellular functions in pituitary cells has not been studied. Finally, the co-expression of several receptor subtypes, as well as ectonucleotidases in pituitary cells raise the question of which receptor family (P2YR, P2XRs, and/or P1Rs) and which signaling molecules (adenosine, ADP, ATP, UDP, and/or UTP) are critical for signaling and secretory actions in a particular cell type. The focus in this study was on expression of P2YRs in anterior pituitary cells and role of both P2YRs and P2XRs in calcium signaling and secretion in pituitary lactotrophs. We screened the expression of P2YRs in pituitary tissue and cultured pituitary cells. To analyze their role in calcium signaling and PRL release, we bathed cells in calcium-deficient medium and defined the receptor pharmacological profiles using intracellular calcium and PRL measurements. To analyze the potential participation of P2XRs in calcium influx and secretion, experiments were also performed with cells bathed in calcium-containing medium, as well as in cells treated with thapsigargin, a blocker of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (23Takemura H. Hughes A.R. Thastrup O. Putney J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12266-12271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the pharmacological profiles of recombinant P2XRs were compared with those observed in secretory anterior pituitary cells. The results of these investigations indicated a complex pattern of P2YR expression in pituitary cells and revealed that calcium-mobilizing P2Y1R and cation-conducting P2X4R play a major role in ATP- and ADP-induced calcium signaling and PRL release. Cell Cultures—Experiments were performed in anterior pituitary cells from normal postpubertal female Sprague-Dawley rats obtained from Taconic Farm (Germantown, NY) and immortalized GnRH-secreting GT1 cells. Pituitary cells were dispersed as described previously (4Tomic M. Jobin R.M. Vergara L.A. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21200-21208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and cultured as mixed cells or enriched lactotrophs in medium 199 containing Earle's salts (Invitrogen), sodium bicarbonate, 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (Invitrogen), and penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). A two-stage Percoll discontinuous density gradient procedure (4Tomic M. Jobin R.M. Vergara L.A. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21200-21208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) was used to obtain enriched lactotrophs and their further identification in single cell calcium studies was done by the addition of TRH (Peninsula Laboratories, Belmont, CA) at the end of recording. For expression of recombinant P2XRs, GT1 cells were selected because they do not express native P2Rs and, as pituitary cells, exhibit spontaneous electrical activity (22He M.-L. Zemkova H. Koshimizu T.-A. Tomic M. Stojilkovic S.S. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 285: C467-C479Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 24Van Goor F. Krsmanovic L.Z. Catt K.J. Stojilkovic S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 587-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). GT1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12 medium (1:1), containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml Gentamicin (Invitrogen). Procedures for transient transfection in GT1 cells were performed as described (18Koshimizu T. Tomic M. Van Goor F. Stojilkovic S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 901-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated on 25 mm coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine (0.01% w/v; Sigma) at a density of 7.5 × 104 cell per 35 mm dish and allowed to grow for 24 h. For each dish of cells, transient transfection of expression constructs was conducted using 1 μg of DNA and 7 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) in 3 ml of serum-free Opti-MEM. After 6 h of incubation, the transfection mixture was replaced with normal culture medium. Cells were subjected to experiments 24 h after transfection. Pituitary and GT1 cells were stimulated with ATP, ADP, αβ-methylene-ATP (αβ-meATP), 3′-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl-ATP (BzATP), and UDP (all from Sigma), as well as with ATPγS, 2-methylthio-ATP (2-MeSATP), UTP, and pyridoxal 5-phosphate 6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulphonic acid (PPADS) (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). To increase ectonucleotidase activity, cells were treated with apyrase (Grade I, Sigma). Single Cell Intracellular Calcium Measurements—For [Ca2+]i measurements, cells were loaded with 1 μm Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in modified Krebs-Ringer buffer (120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 0.7 mm MgSO4, 1.8 g/l glucose, and 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) for 60 min at room temperature. After dye loading, cells were incubated in modified Krebs-Ringer buffer and kept in the dark for at least 30 min before single-cell [Ca2+]i measurement. Recordings were done in calcium-containing medium (free calcium 1.26 mm) and calcium-deficient medium (about 100 nm free calcium, adjusted by addition of EGTA). To exclude calcium mobilization from intracellular pool, cells were pretreated with 1 μm thapsigargin (RBI, Natick, MA) for at least 20 min. Coverslips with cells were mounted on the stage of an Axiovert 135 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) attached to the Attofluor Digital Fluorescence Microscopy System (Atto Instruments, Rockville, MD). The dynamic changes of [Ca2+]i were examined under a 40× oil immersion objective during exposure to alternating 340 and 380 nm light beams, and the intensity of light emission at 520 nm was recorded. The ratio of light intensities, F340/F380, which reflects changes in [Ca2+]i, was simultaneously followed in several single cells at rate of about 1 point/s. Measurements of PRL and ATP—Hormone secretion and ATP content was monitored using cell column perifusion experiments, as described previously (4Tomic M. Jobin R.M. Vergara L.A. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21200-21208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.2 × 107 cells were incubated with pre-swollen cytodex-1 beads in 60-mm Petri dishes for 24 h. The beads were then transferred to 0.5 ml chambers and perifused with Krebs-Ringer medium for 2.5 h at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min and at 37 °C to establish stable basal secretion. Fractions were collected in 1 min intervals and immediately assayed for PRL and ATP contents. Primary antibody and standard for PRL assay were provided by the National Pituitary Agency and Dr. A. F. Parlow (Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, CA), 125I-PRL was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and secondary antibody from Sigma. The concentration of ATP in the effluent was determined using an ATP bioluminescent assay kit (Sigma) in TD-20/20 Luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). Calibration curves were constructed from measurements of standard solutions, which were diluted in the same medium as the corresponding solutions of unknown ATP concentration. Detection limit of the assay was 0.2 nm. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Analysis of P2YR Expression—Total RNA from rat anterior pituitary was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). After DNase I digestion, 2 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into first-strand cDNA with oligo-dT primers and Super-ScriptII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The cDNAs were then amplified with different P2YR isoform-specific primer sets in the nonconserved carboxyl-terminal region. The oligonucleotide sequences of primers used for PCR amplification, with GeneBank™ accession numbers given in parentheses, are listed as P2Y1R (U22830): sense primer, 5′-GCCTGAGTTGGAAAGAAGAGGATG-3′, antisense primer, 5′-GGAAATCCAGCCGTGCCCTC-3′; P2Y2R (L46865): sense primer, 5′-CAAGAGCAGGAGCTGATCGGGTC-3′, antisense primer, 5′-CGATGGTGCGCACAGACTTG-3′; P2Y4R (Y14705): sense primer, 5′-CATGACCAGTGCAGAATCCTTG-3′, antisense primer, 5′-GGGTCGAGTCACCTTGTAAAC-3′; P2Y6R (D63665): sense primer, 5′-GGAAAAGCAGGCCGCCAGTTATG-3′, antisense primer, 5′-AGTGCGGTTGCGCTGGATGC-3′; P2Y12R (AF313450): sense primer, 5′-GGCAACGAAACCAAGTCACTGAG-3′, antisense primer, 5′-CACTAAAGACTGAAGCAACCC-3′. The amplification was conducted in a Robocycler Thermal Cycler (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in a 50-μl reaction volume containing 1 μl of the first-strand cDNA as template, 1 unit of TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen), 0.5 μm concentration of each primer, 0.2 mm dNTP, and 1× PCR buffer (2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4). Amplification of DNA templates was initiated by a denaturation step at 94 °C for 180 s, followed by 35 cycles of denaturing at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 52 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 90 s. The reaction was then terminated by a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. After PCR, a 10-μl aliquot of PCR products was size-fractionated by electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. To check for the integrity of RNA preparation, reverse transcriptase-PCR of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was also conducted as an internal control using primers GAPDH-sense (5′-GGCATCCTGGGCTACACTG-3′) and GAPDH-antisense (5′-TGAGGTCCACCACCCTGTT-3′). Ligand and Ectonucleotidase-dependence of PRL Release—To define the pattern of signals applied in our perifusion experiments, we added ATP to chambers with and without cells, collected fractions every minute, and measured ATP concentrations immediately after collection. Fig. 1A illustrates concentrations of ATP measured in effluents prior, during, and after the addition of 10 μm ATP. In effluents from chambers containing beads without cells, free ATP concentrations reached the steady level shortly after its addition and returned back to undetectable levels within 2 min after stopping its application. In chambers containing beads with cells, the profile of ATP content was similar as described above, but the steady levels was only about one fourth of that found in effluents from chambers without cells (Fig. 1A). This finding is consistent with earlier studies showing the operation of endogenous ectoATPases in pituitary cells (4Tomic M. Jobin R.M. Vergara L.A. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21200-21208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, in our experimental conditions the ATP signal has a square-like type and native ectoATPases influence its amplitude but not its pattern. To examine the potential secretagogue action of ATP, we also measured PRL content in effluents from chambers with cells attached on beads. As shown in Fig. 1B, there was high basal PRL release prior to the addition of ATP and further increase in PRL release occurred during perifusion of cells with ATP. In contrast to the square-type ATP signal, the secretion of PRL was composed of two phases: a rapid spike response and a sustained plateau response (Fig. 1B). The early spike response was observed in all experiments (n = 44), whereas the sustained low amplitude response was only visible in some experiments. ATPγS, a non-hydrolysable agonist for majority of P2Rs (1Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar, 25Beukers M.W. Kerkhof C.J. van Rhee M.A. Ardunau U. Gurgel C. Widjaja H. Nickel P. Ijzerman A.P. Soudjin W. Nauyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1995; 351: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), also induced rapid and transient increase in PRL release (Fig. 1C). To clarify which agonist acts as a native extracellular messenger, cells were stimulated with ATP, ADP, UTP, and UDP. As shown in Fig. 1, D and E, ATP and ADP induced comparable increase in PRL release. Furthermore, the secretory action of these two agonists was abolished in cells perifused with apyrase, an ectonucleotidase that degrades both ATP and ADP. In contrast, only a small increase in PRL release was observed in cells perifused with UTP and UDP (not shown). These results indicate that ATP and ADP, rather than their degradation products AMP and adenosine, are native P2R agonists in lactotrophs. Agonist-induced PRL release does not provide the evidence that P2Rs are expressed in lactotrophs, because the secretory action of nucleotides could be mediated indirectly, through a paracrine factor released by another cell type, like endothelins that are known to modulate secretion in lactotrophs (26Samson W.K. Skala K.D. Alexander B.D. Huang F.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 169: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 27Kanyicska B. Livingstone J.D. Freeman M.E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, single cell calcium measurements revealed that 88% of TRH-responsive cells responded to ATP stimulation with an elevation in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 2A). In a fraction of lactotrophs (76 of 614 TRH-sensitive cells) no increase in [Ca2+]i was observed (Fig. 2B). Cells other than TRH-sensitive also responded to ATP stimulation under these conditions (Fig. 2C). These data clearly indicate that majority of lactotrophs express P2Rs capable of elevating the [Ca2+]i. Expression of P2YRs in Pituitary Cells—In further studies, we analyzed the presence of mRNA transcripts for mammalian P2YRs in rat anterior pituitary tissue. This analysis revealed the presence of rat-specific mRNAs for P2Y1R, P2Y2R, P2Y4R, P2Y6R, and P2Y12R (Fig. 3A). Functional analysis of P2YRs was further studied at single cell level. With the exception of P2Y12R, all other receptor subtypes expressed in pituitary cells belong to family of Gq-coupled receptors, i.e. their activation leads to the stimulation of phospholipase C, generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and release of calcium from intracellular stores (28Muller C.E. Current Pharmacol. Design. 2002; 8: 2353-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 29Kugelgen I. Wetter A. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2000; 362: 310-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Thus, single cell calcium measurements provide a valid method for functional characterization of these receptors. To exclude the possible participation of P2XRs in calcium signaling, we stimulated mixed population of pituitary cells with ATP in extracellular calcium-deficient medium. Fig. 3, B and C, illustrates that 51% of TRH-responsive cells also responded to ATP stimulation with a rise in [Ca2+]i. Similar ratio was also observed in enriched fraction of lactotrophs (Table I). However, calcium-mobilizing P2YRs were not exclusively expressed in lactotrophs; about 47% of cells other than TRH-sensitive also responded to ATP (Fig. 3D).Table IEffects of 10 μm PPADS on agonist-induced calcium signaling in lactotrophs bathed in calcium-deficient (-Ca2+) and calcium-containing (+Ca2+) medium)Treatments-Ca2++Ca2+ATP + TRHTRH onlyATP + TRHTRH only%%Controls46 (61/132)54 (71/132)87 (160/184)13 (24/184)10 μm PPADS6 (14/252)94 (238/252)79 (283/358)21 (75/358) Open table in a new tab Role of P2YR in PRL Release—To clarify the potential relevance of calcium-mobilizing P2YRs in ATP-induced PRL release, pituitary cells were perifused with calcium-deficient and calcium-containing medium. As shown in Fig. 4, A–C, ATP and its two analog agonists, ATPγS and BzATP, induced a transient increase in PRL release in both experimental conditions. However, the peak amplitude of PRL responses in calcium-deficient medium represented only about 25% of that observed in cells perifused with calcium-containing medium. Our enriched fractions of lactotrophs (about 70%) was not enough purified to be used for further reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis on the expression pattern of P2YRs in these cells. Thus, identification of subtypes of P2YRs responsible for extracellular calcium-independent signaling and secretion was done pharmacologically. Based on the ligand-selectivity profiles of recombinant rat P2YRs, these receptors could be separated into two groups: P2Y1R is the most sensitive to 2-MeSATP and ADP and insensitive to UTP and UDP, whereas P2Y2R, P2Y4R, and P2Y6R are highly sensitive to UTP and low sensitive to 2-MeSATP (28Muller C.E. Current Pharmacol. Design. 2002; 8: 2353-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 29Kugelgen I. Wetter A. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2000; 362: 310-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). In pituitary cells perifused in calcium-deficient medium, 2-MeSATP was more potent secretagogue than ATP, whereas UTP was practically ineffective (Fig. 4, E–F). The following order reflected the ligand-selectivity profile of native P2YR controlling extracellular calcium-independent PRL release: 2-MeSATP > ATP = ADP » BzATP = ATPγS » UTP. Similar sensitivity was also observed in single cell calcium measurements (Table II).Table IIEffects of P2R agonists on calcium signaling in lactotrophs bathed in calcium-deficient mediumTreatmentAgonist and TRHTRH only%2-MeSATP55 (160/289)45 (129/289)ADP51 (32/62)49 (30/62)ATP47 (50/106)53 (56/106)BzATP26 (10/38)74 (28/38)αβ-MeATP13 (8/62)87 (54/62)UDP13 (10/75)87 (65/75)UTP11 (7/62)89 (55/62) Open table in a new tab The recombinant rat P2YRs also differ in their sensitivity to PPADS. This compound acts as an antagonist at P2Y1R with an IC50 of 5 μm, partially blocks P2Y6R at 100 μm, and does not block P2Y2R and P2Y4R (28Muller C.E. Current Pharmacol. Design. 2002; 8: 2353-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 29Kugelgen I. Wetter A. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2000; 362: 310-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Single cell calcium measurements in cells bathed in calcium-deficient medium revealed that ATP was unable to trigger calcium mobilization in the presence of 10 μm PPADS (Table I). The extracellular calcium-independent ATP-stimulated PRL release was also blocked by 10 μm PPADS (controls 7.5 ± 1.8 ng/ml/min, PPADS-treated 0.19 ± 0.3 ng/ml/min, basal PRL secretion subtracted). These observations support the view that P2Y1R plays a critical role in ATP-induced PRL release in cells bathed in calcium-deficient medium. The equipotency of ATP and ADP (Table II and Fig. 4D) further suggests that both molecules function as extracellular messengers by activating the calcium-mobilizing pathway and stimulating PRL secretion.

https://openalex.org/W1987625115,"Protein import into chloroplasts is postulated to occur with the involvement of molecular chaperones. We have determined that the transit peptide of ferredoxin-NADP(H) reductase precursor binds preferentially to an Hsp70 from chloroplast stroma. To investigate the role of Hsp70 molecular chaperones in chloroplast protein import, we analyzed the import into pea chloroplasts of preproteins with decreased Hsp70 binding affinity in their transit peptides. Our results indicate that the precursor with the lowest affinity for Hsp70 molecular chaperones in its transit peptide was imported to chloroplasts with similar apparent Km as the wild type precursor and a 2-fold increase in Vmax. Thus, a strong interaction between chloroplast stromal Hsp70 and the transit peptide seems not to be essential for protein import. These results indicate that in chloroplasts the main unfolding force during protein import may be applied by molecular chaperones other than Hsp70s. Although stromal Hsp70s undoubtedly participate in chloroplast biogenesis, the role of these molecular chaperones in chloroplast protein translocation differs from the one proposed in the mechanisms postulated up to date.

Plastids accomplish a great variety of metabolic functions and developmental roles in plants and eukaryotic algae. They are distributed in different amounts in each plant tissue but are present in almost all plant cells. These organelles contain their own genomes, but most of their proteins are nuclear encoded and post-translationally imported through a complex machinery located in the plastid envelope. The import process requires a number of cytosolic and stromal soluble factors and several membrane-bound and integral proteins. Most of these proteins have been identified and studied (1Jarvis P. Soll J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1541: 64-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 2Keegstra K. Cline K. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 557-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 3Chen X. Schnell D.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The significant biochemical and molecular data achieved to date have allowed the creation of working models for the chloroplast protein import mechanism. Precursor proteins containing N-terminal signal sequences are bound to the chloroplast outer membrane probably by interacting initially with lipids and then, by a “docking” step that involves a highly specific protein-protein recognition, and GTP-ATP hydrolysis and/or exchange (4Bruce B.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1541: 2-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The passage of the preprotein through the membranes is initiated by its N terminus. Once the precursor protein has reached the irreversible stage recognized as “early import intermediate,” the transit peptide and the N-terminal unfolded portion of the preprotein pass through the outer membrane channel and interact with some of the components of the internal membrane translocation apparatus (5Akita M. Nielsen E. Keegstra K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 6Nielsen E. Akita M. Davila-Aponte J. Keegstra K.

The complete translocation of the protein requires high energy availability (>1 mm ATP in in vitro import experiments) to unfold the bound folded precursor and move it across both envelope membranes (8Theg S.M. Bauerle C. Olsen L.J. Selman B.R. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6730-6736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Pain D. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3288-3292Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Finally, the transit peptide is proteolytically removed (10Robinson C. Ellis R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 142: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and the mature protein is folded to its final conformation. Two possible mechanisms have been proposed for mitochondrial protein import (11Glick B.S. Cell. 1995; 80: 11-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 12Pfanner N. Meijer M. Curr.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6497-6507Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In both models, internal Hsp70s has been postulated to be the main motor of the process. The Brownian ratchet mechanism assumes that the precursor chain diffuses within the translocation pore. Then, Hsp70 molecular chaperones located in the inner side of the organelle bind to sites distributed along the polypeptide chain hampering the reverse movement of the polypeptide, thus promoting an unidirectional movement of the chain into the mitochondrial matrix (13Neupert W. Hartl F.U. Craig E.A. Pfanner N. Cell. 1990; 63: 447-450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 14Gaume B. Klaus C. Ungermann C. Guiard B. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6497-6507Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The second model postulates that Hsp70 associates with the membrane-bound complex (Sec63p or Tim44) and the precursor protein. Hsp70 then undergoes an ATP-dependent conformational change that pulls the precursor through the pore, driving the external unfolding, and impelling the precursor protein to cross the membranes (11Glick B.S. Cell. 1995; 80: 11-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 12Pfanner N. Meijer M. Curr.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6727-6736Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The interaction of the transit peptides of mitochondrial and chloroplast precursors with Hsp70, which helps to sustain the above mentioned models, is supported by experimental and theoretical means (14Gaume B.

The Hsp70 molecular chaperones comprise a protein family that is widely distributed among different organisms and subcellular compartments. Several Hsp70 proteins were found to be located in chloroplasts, associated with the envelope, or resident in the stroma. Com70 was detected facing the cytoplasm, Hsp70-IAP was found to be exposed to the intermembrane space between the outer and inner membranes, and at least two more Hsp70 molecular chaperones are located in the stroma, CSS1, for which its cDNA has been isolated and sequenced, and another Hsp70 less characterized (22Marshall J.S. Keegstra K. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 1048-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 23Marshall J.S. DeRocher A.E. Keegstra K. Vierling E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The intermembrane and stromal Hsp70s can be considered ideal candidates for providing the driving force during precursor protein import into chloroplasts. However, it is still a matter of discussion which class of chaperones acts as the main molecular motor of the protein import into chloroplasts. It has been proposed that an Hsp93 molecular chaperone (ClpC), a member of the Hsp100 family associated with the inner face of the envelope alone or in collaboration with a plastidic Hsp70, may function as the driving force of the system (4Bruce B.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1541: 2-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 25Jackson-Constan D. Akita M. Keegstra K. Biochim. Biophys.

In previous work, we have demonstrated that more than 75% of chloroplast transit peptides have at least one putative DnaK (Escherichia coli Hsp70 molecular chaperone) binding site. We have also confirmed that an interaction exists between the transit peptide of ferredoxin-NADP(H) reductase precursor (preFNR) 1The abbreviations used are: preFNRferredoxin-NADP(H) reductase precursorFNRferredoxin-NADP(H) reductase (EC 1.18.1.2)GSTglutathione S-transferase (EC 2.5.1.18)GST-TPGST-transit peptide fusion proteinRubiscoribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. and Hsp70 molecular chaperones from plant cells in vitro (21Rial D.V. Arakaki A.K. Ceccarelli E.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6239-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Similar observations were made for the transit peptide of the precursor of the small subunit of Rubisco (18Ivey III, R.A. Subramanian C. Bruce B.D. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 1289-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). ferredoxin-NADP(H) reductase precursor ferredoxin-NADP(H) reductase (EC 1.18.1.2) glutathione S-transferase (EC 2.5.1.18) GST-transit peptide fusion protein ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. In this report we have studied the import of wild type and mutant precursors with altered affinity for Hsp70 in their transit peptides into isolated chloroplasts and their interactions with cytosolic and chloroplast Hsp70 molecular chaperones. As a model, the ferredoxin-NADP(H) reductase (FNR) precursor was used. This enzyme catalyzes NADP+ reduction during photosynthesis. The NADPH generated is used for CO2 fixation and other biosynthetic pathways (27Arakaki A.K. Ceccarelli E.A. Carrillo N. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). preFNR had been previously purified as a tightly folded precursor containing non-covalently bound FAD. The protein was fully active and was efficiently imported to intact pea chloroplasts (28Ottado J. Ceccarelli E.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We used monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to show that the transit peptide of preFNR interacts preferentially with the chloroplast Hsp70 molecular chaperone CSS1 and not with chaperones from the cytosol. We performed quantitative protein import studies using precursors with decreased Hsp70 binding ability in their transit peptides to challenge the current working models on polypeptide translocation. Here we show that weakening the interaction between the chaperone and the transit peptide does not impair the protein import process. To the contrary, mutations introduced in the transit peptides produced a 2-fold import efficiency increase, whereas they did not affect the precursor binding to the import machinery. Therefore, in chloroplasts the main unfolding force may be applied by molecular chaperones different from stromal Hsp70s, and a simple Hsp70-Brownian ratchet mechanism may not be sufficient to drive chloroplast polypeptide import. These results provide additional insights to the process and are discussed under the light of the current models. Plasmid Constructions, Expression, and Purification of preFNRs— The cDNAs coding for preFNR variants (preFNR-14, preFNR-23, and preFNR-1234) were inserted into a modified pET32 vector (Novagen) and expressed in E. coli as thioredoxin N-terminal fusion proteins. The construction of this modified vector was previously described (29Rial D.V. Lombardo V.A. Ceccarelli E.A. Ottado J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5431-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Then, the PstI-EcoRI cDNA fragments (≅1.3 kbp) coding for pea preFNR mutants from plasmids pGF202-14, pGF202-23, and pGF202-1234 (21Rial D.V. Arakaki A.K. Ceccarelli E.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6239-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) were subcloned into the modified pET32b vector digested with PstI and EcoRI. To ensure that no sequence artifacts were introduced during protein expression E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells were transformed each time with the different sequenced plasmids and then grown in Luria-Bertani medium containing antibiotics at 37 °C up to the suspension reached an absorbance of 0.7 at 600 nm. Expression and purification of 35S-labeled preFNRs were performed as described previously (29Rial D.V. Lombardo V.A. Ceccarelli E.A. Ottado J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5431-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Binding of Hsp70 Chaperones to GST-TP Fusion Proteins—In vitro binding of plant Hsp70 chaperones to GST-TP or GST-TP-1234 was performed essentially as described (21Rial D.V. Arakaki A.K. Ceccarelli E.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6239-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), using cytosol or chloroplast extracts. Briefly, GST-TP fusion proteins used for these studies were expressed and purified from the E. coli strain BB1553 (30Kanemori M. Mori H. Yura T. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5648-5653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which does not contain the E. coli Hsp70 molecular chaperone DnaK. GST-TP fusion proteins (0.3 nmol) loaded in 30-μl fractions of glutathione-agarose were incubated with extracts (2.2 mg/ml final concentration of total proteins) in a final volume of 180 μl in buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol). After 5 min of incubation in an ice-cold bath, each sample was recovered by centrifugation (2 min, 3000 × g), washed twice with 120 μl of buffer A, and eluted in two 40-μl steps of the same buffer containing 10 mm glutathione (Fig. 2, A and B). In the binding assays shown in Fig. 2C, the loaded resin was washed three times and eluted in two 50-μl steps of Buffer A containing 10 mm glutathione. In each experiment aliquots of 20 μl of the eluted samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. To estimate the binding affinity of E. coli Hsp70 to the different transit peptides, wild type or mutant GST-TP·Hsp70 complexes were bound to glutathione-agarose beads from cell lysates as described previously (21Rial D.V. Arakaki A.K. Ceccarelli E.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6239-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Then, the loaded matrix containing the in vivo formed GST-TP·Hsp70 complexes was divided equally into several Eppendorf tubes (25-μl matrix/tube containing about 0.2 nmol of fusion protein in a total volume of 175 μl), and different volumes of Buffer A were added. After equilibrium was established, the beads were sedimented, and the amounts of GST-TP, the chaperone complexed with GST-TP (associated with the beads) and free in solution, were quantified using specific antibodies. The Kd values were determined by fitting the data obtained using Sigmaplot (Jandel Scientific). Antibodies against E. coli and human Hsp70 were purchased from Stressgen, Canada (Products SPA-880 and SPA-820). Antisera against CSS1 (a chloroplast stroma Hsp70 homolog) were kindly provided by Drs. J. E. Froehlich and K. Keegstra. Binding and Import into Chloroplasts—Intact chloroplasts were isolated from 10- to 14-day-old pea seedlings (Pisum sativum cv. little marvel) as described (31Schreier P.H. Reiss B. Kuntz M. Gelvin S.B. Schilperoort R.A. Verma D.P.S. Plant Molecular Biology Manual. Kluwer Academic Press, Dordrecht1988: 1-22Google Scholar) and suspended in import buffer (50 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.3, 330 mm Sorbitol, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm MnCl2) at a chlorophyll concentration of 0.6 mg/ml. Import reactions were carried out essentially as described (32Serra E.C. Krapp A.R. Ottado J. Feldman M.F. Ceccarelli E.A. Carrillo N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19930-19935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Radioactive precursor proteins were precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 66% final concentration and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C and 10,000 × g, and the pellet was dissolved in import buffer. A typical import reaction contained the amount of chloroplasts suspension equivalent to 30 μg of chlorophyll in a final reaction volume of 150 μl. Precursors were incubated with the chloroplast suspension and5mm MgATP in import buffer at 25 °C in the light. At the end of the import reaction 2.5 μg of thermolysin was added to each sample. After a 30-min treatment on ice, EDTA was added to a final concentration of 10 mm, and chloroplasts were recovered by centrifugation through silicone oil layers (AR200). For studying the import of unfolded precursors, the preproteins were incubated with 8 m urea for 10 min after the precipitation with ammonium sulfate. Prior to their incubation with intact chloroplasts, the precursors were diluted 20 times in import buffer. Binding reactions were carried out in a final volume of 150 μl during 15 min on ice at different precursor concentrations in the presence of 50 μm MgATP. Immediately after reaction, intact chloroplasts were recovered by centrifugation through silicone oil layers. Samples were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by blotting and autoradiography. Urea Gradient Gel Electrophoresis—Urea gradient gels were prepared as described previously (33Calcaterra N.B. Pico G.A. Orellano E.G. Ottado J. Carrillo N. Ceccarelli E.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12842-12848Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, polyacrylamide gels containing a horizontal linear gradient of 0–8 m urea and a compensatory inverse gradient of 7.0–5.5% (w/v) acrylamide were used. The gradient uniformity among gels was maintained by the use of a casting box that allows the simultaneous preparation of several gels. Samples were incubated in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol for 20 min at 30 °C to reduce any oxidized state of the proteins, then diluted to 0.2 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 20 μg/ml bromphenol blue, and finally applied onto the gels and electrophoresed for 600 min at 10 V at 4 °C. After the electrophoresis was completed, gels were subjected to electroblotting and immunoreaction with rabbit anti-FNR antibodies. Rate constants for unfolding at the transition midpoints were estimated from the continuity of the gel bands, which depends upon the rate of unfolding. The observed distributions of protein at the midpoint were compared with those predicted for different arbitrary values of the unfolding rate constants (34Goldenberg D.P. Creighton T.E. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Analytical Procedures—Quantification of labeled protein bands was performed using Gel-Pro Analyzer Software 3.1 (Media Cybernetics). Different amounts of purified labeled preFNR proteins were included in each experiment as standard. Import rates and kinetics parameters were determined by fitting the data obtained to a first order equation using Sigmaplot. FNR-dependent diaphorase activity was determined by published methods (35Zanetti G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 445: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) using ferricyanide reduction at 420 nm (ϵ420 = 1 mm–1·cm–1). Purification of FNR Precursors Containing Mutations in Their Transit Peptides—Four amino acid substitutions were successfully introduced previously into the preFNR transit peptide sequence by PCR techniques (Fig. 1A, see also Ref. 21Rial D.V. Arakaki A.K. Ceccarelli E.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6239-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Mutations were designed to produce a major increase of ΔΔGK for each region, thus decreasing the putative E. coli Hsp70 (DnaK) binding with a minimal sequence variation. It was experimentally determined that transit peptides carrying these mutations exhibit an increased release of bound DnaK. Moreover, the effect introduced by each mutation was accumulative (21Rial D.V. Arakaki A.K. Ceccarelli E.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6239-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It has been stated that predicted binding specificity for E. coli Hsp70 could be valid for a broad range of Hsp70s (20Zhang X.P. Glaser E. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 14-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 21Rial D.V. Arakaki A.K. Ceccarelli E.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6239-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Moreover, the above mentioned mutations were proved to affect the interaction of the preFNR transit peptide with plant Hsp70 chaperones (21Rial D.V. Arakaki A.K. Ceccarelli E.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6239-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Three different preFNRs carrying the mutations described above and the wild type precursor were cloned as thioredoxin N-terminal fusion proteins, expressed in E. coli, and purified by affinity chromatography using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin. Precursor proteins were released of Hsp70 molecular chaperones as described previously (36Rial D.V. Ceccarelli E.A. Protein Expr. Purif. 2002; 25: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Then, precursors were separated from thioredoxin by digestion with the endoprotease thrombin. Purified samples are shown in Fig. 1B. Precursor preparations used were >90% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and scanning densitometry. Faint minor bands were reactive against anti FNR antibodies. They could be truncated proteins or the result of some proteolytic digestion of the fusion protein. No Hsp70 molecular chaperones were detected by the monoclonal and polyclonal anti-Hsp70 antibodies used in this work copurifying with the isolated precursor proteins. Interaction of Stromal Hsp70s with Precursor Proteins— Models of post-translational protein translocation assume that interaction of the incoming polypeptide with the chaperones responsible for its import occurs only at the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum, or the inner side of the organelles (37Elston T.C. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2235-2251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 38Liebermeister W. Rapoport T.A. Heinrich R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 643-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 39Chauwin J.F. Oster G. Glick B.S. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1732-1743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Considering that homologs of the Hsp70 chaperone family are present at both sides of the chloroplast envelope, differences in affinities or specificities should be required at both sides of the membranes to uphold these models of protein import. Thus, we have analyzed the binding preference of the preFNR transit peptide for molecular chaperones from cell cytosol or chloroplast stroma. In the case of cellular extracts, chaperones from cytosol and from organelles were present, because a considerable breakage of plastids probably occurs during the mechanical disruption of the plant tissues. To the contrary, intact chloroplasts were isolated through a Percoll gradient, a method that had been shown to avoid contamination of chloroplasts with cytosolic factors involved in protein import (40Waegemann K. Paulsen H. Soll J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 89-92Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, the stroma obtained from them did not contain cytosolic or envelope factors and will mainly have stromal Hsp70 molecular chaperones. We incubated GST-TP fusion proteins with whole cellular extracts from pea leaves or chloroplast stroma at identical final protein concentration. Then, complexes between GST-TPs and the interacting proteins from the extracts were purified, washed, resolved in SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, or Western blotting using two different antibodies. One of them (anti-Hsp70) is a monoclonal antibody raised against human Hsp70 that also reacts against plant Hsp70s. The other is a polyclonal antibody prepared against purified recombinant CSS1, a chloroplast Hsp70 also known as Hsp78. As shown in Fig. 2A (lanes 1 and 4), the human monoclonal antibody reacted with the Hsp70s present in whole cellular extracts but did not recognize Hsp70 molecular chaperones present in purified chloroplast stroma. To the contrary, anti-CSS1 detected a chloroplast chaperone present in stroma and whole cellular extracts (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 4). When the isolated complexes were examined, we observed that the protein of ∼70 kDa, which always co-purified with GST-TP, was reactive only with anti-CSS1 antibodies (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3). It had been previously reported that the molecular mass of mature CSS1 is about 69 kDa (22Marshall J.S. Keegstra K. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 1048-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). No reaction of the purified samples was observed using antibodies against cytoplasmic Hsp70 (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3). The reactive band in Fig. 2B (lanes 2 and 3) was of identical molecular weight to the one observed when chloroplast stroma was analyzed with the same antibodies (Fig. 2B, lane 1). Identical results were obtained when the stroma used in the incubations was purified from chloroplasts that were previously treated with thermolysin, a protease that does not penetrate the chloroplast outer membrane, thus excluding the possibility that the chaperone bound to the fusion protein was a cytoplasmic contaminant (not shown). When the complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Fig. 2C, lanes 1 and 2), a band of ∼70 kDa with identical molecular mass to the one detected by Western blotting was observed. These results show that, even in the presence of cytosolic Hsp70 molecular chaperones, the transit peptide of preFNR specifically binds to organellar Hsp70. When we incubated GST-TP-1234, in which all its Hsp70 binding sites were modified by site directed mutagenesis (see Fig. 1A and Ref. 21Rial D.V. Arakaki A.K. Ceccarelli E.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6239-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), with chloroplast stroma or whole cellular extracts, we detected a significant decrease in the amount of Hsp70 chaperone bound compared with the wild type form (Fig. 2, C (lanes 3 and 4) and D (lane 2)). Using a solid-phase binding assay, the affinity of the E. coli Hsp70 to the wild type and mutated transit peptides were estimated (Table I). A high affinity binding (Kd 125 nm) occurs with the wild type transit peptide, meanwhile introduction of the four mutations decreased about seven times the Kd (880 nm for the GST-TP-1234·Hsp70 complex).Table IParameters characterizing the import kinetics and unfolding of preFNRsPrecursorKmaKinetic parameters were determined by fitting the experimental data to a first order equation as described under “Experimental Procedures.”VmaxaKinetic parameters were determined by fitting the experimental data to a first order equation as described under “Experimental Procedures.”CmbMidpoint of the urea unfolding curves.mcSlope of ΔG versus urea concentration at Cm.FNR activitydFNR-dependent diaphorase activity was determined as stated under “Experimental Procedures.”KdeKd values for the complex of GST-TPs and DnaK (E. coli Hsp70) determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.”nmmolecules/chl·minmkcal/mol·mmmol/mg·min.nmpreFNR406 ± 19410,195 ± 1,8884.00 ± 0.521.11 ± 0.28149125preFNR-14477 ± 13812,291 ± 1,5574.00 ± 0.270.90 ± 0.18141232preFNR-23399 ± 5911,650 ± 6934.00 ± 0.231.25 ± 0.09150540preFNR-1234380 ± 8019,989 ± 1,4764.10 ± 0.311.42 ± 0.11145880FNR4.00 ± 0.581.38 ± 0.21156a Kinetic parameters were determined by fitting the experimental data to a first order equation as described under “Experimental Procedures.”b Midpoint of the urea unfolding curves.c Slope of ΔG versus urea concentration at Cm.d FNR-dependent diaphorase activity was determined as stated under “Experimental Procedures.”e Kd values for the complex of GST-TPs and DnaK (E. coli Hsp70) determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.”"

https://openalex.org/W2056221575,"We have reconstituted a multiprotein system consisting of 22 purified proteins that catalyzed the initiation of replication specifically at ori γ of R6K, elongation of the forks, and their termination at specific replication terminators. The initiation was strictly dependent on the plasmid-encoded initiator protein π and on the host-encoded initiator DnaA. The wild type π was almost inert, whereas a mutant form containing 3 amino acid substitutions that tended to monomerize the protein was effective in initiating replication. The replication in vitro was primed by DnaG primase, whereas in a crude extract system that had not been fractionated, it was dependent on RNA polymerase. The DNA-bending protein IHF was needed for optimal replication and its substitution by HU, unlike in the oriC system, was less effective in promoting optimal replication. In contrast, wild type π-mediated replication in vivo requires IHF. Using a template that contained ori γ flanked by two asymmetrically placed Ter sites in the blocking orientation, replication proceeded in the Cairns type mode and generated the expected types of termination products. A majority of the molecules progressed counterclockwise from the ori, in the same direction that has been observed in vivo. Many features of replication in the reconstituted system appeared to mimic those of in vivo replication. The system developed here is an important milestone in continuing biochemical analysis of this interesting replicon.

The system developed here is an important milestone in continuing biochemical analysis of this interesting replicon. The plasmid R6K is a fascinating model system to investigate the mechanisms of initiation and termination of DNA replication for the following reasons. First, it has three origins of replication called α, β, and γ (1Crosa J.H. Luttrop L.K. Falkow S. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 126: 454-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Crosa J.H. Luttrop L. Falkow S. J.

Mukherjee S. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1205-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). At a given time and in a given molecule, only one of the three origins (ori) is active. In vivo, ori α and β are almost equally active, whereas γ remains mostly silent (8Crosa J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11075-11077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Inuzuka N. Inuzuka M.

A. 1979; 76: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These observations present an opportunity to uncover the mechanism of origin selection and activation in a multiorigin system. Second, although α and β are the most frequent sites of initiation in vivo, these are not the primary binding sites for the plasmid-encoded π initiator protein. In fact the single iteron at α and the half iteron at β are incapable of binding to π protein by themselves in the absence of the seven γ iterons present in cis (7Miron A. Mukherjee S. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1205-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 11Mukherjee S. Erickson H. Bastia D.

A. 1988; 85: 6287-6291Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Rather, π binds to the seven iterons at ori γ. Action at a distance (initiation) is potentiated by looping of the π bound to the seven iterons of γ to the single iteron at α or the half iteron at β that are located ∼4000 and 1200 bp away, respectively, from γ (8Crosa J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11075-11077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kolter R. Inuzuka M. Helinski D.R. Cell. 1978; 15: 1199-1258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). DNA looping is believed to convey the π protein along with other replisomal proteins to the physically separated α and β origins, thus providing additional opportunity for investigating the mechanism of long range ori activation (7Miron A. Mukherjee S. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1205-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 11Mukherjee S. Erickson H. Bastia D. Cell. 1988; 52: 375-383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition, R6K has sequence-specific replication termini that invite further investigations into the physiological roles of replication termination (14Bastia D. Germino J. Crosa J.H. Ram J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2095-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 15Bastia D. Mohanty B.K. DePamphilis M. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells.

In a series of in vitro experiments we have shown that π binds to α and β by DNA looping between γ-α or γ-β sequences (7Miron A. Mukherjee S. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1205-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 11Mukherjee S. Erickson H. Bastia D.

A. 1988; 85: 6287-6291Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Consistent with the biochemical results, both α and β require the presence of γ in cis to be active (8Crosa J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11075-11077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Inuzuka N. Inuzuka M. Helinski D.R. J. Biol.

We have previously reported the isolation of a looping defective mutant form of π protein (P42L) that fails to activate α and β in vivo but derepresses ori γ (7Miron A. Mukherjee S. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1205-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus the ori γ sequences are the central elements in the replication initiation from all three origins. ori γ contains several sequence elements that are essential for its function (see Fig. 1). First, it has seven tandem 21-bp repeated sequences called iterons that bind to π protein (17Germino J. Bastia D. Cell. 1983; 32: 131-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 18Germino J. Bastia D. Cell. 1983; 34: 125-134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The binding of π protein to the iterons causes localized DNA bending (19Mukherjee S. Patel I. Bastia D. Cell. 1985; 52: 375-385Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (77) Google Scholar). There are two binding sites for the host-encoded DnaA initiator protein called dnaA1 and dnaA2 (20Wu F. Goldberg I. Filutowicz M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 21Wu F. Levchenko I. Filutowicz M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6338-6345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kelley W.L. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15924-15937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas, dnaA1 can be deleted without destroying ori activity, either deletion of dnaA2 or insertion of a 6-bp sequence between the seventh iteron and dnaA2 site causes inactivation of ori γ (5Kelley W.L. Bastia D. New Biol. 1992; 4: 569-580PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kelley W.L. Patel I. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5078-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Wu F.

There is an AT-rich region between the dnaA1 site and the iterons and several point mutations in this region inactivate ori γ (6Kelley W.L. Patel I. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5078-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 23McEachern M.J. Filutowicz M. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1480-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Embedded in the AT-rich region is a binding site (ihf) for the DNA-bending protein IHF (22Kelley W.L. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15924-15937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Filutowicz M. Appelt K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 3829-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Binding of IHF at the ihf locus causes bending of the DNA (6Kelley W.L. Patel I. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5078-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) that presumably brings the DnaA protein bound to the dnaA1 site into contact with π protein bound to the seven iterons and also with DnaA bound to dnaA2. DNA bending also promotes contact between the π-iteron complex and the AT-rich region by forming a local DNA loop (25Lu Y.B. Datta H.J. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5192-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Several mutations at the ihf locus that abolish binding to IHF also cause ori γ inactivation. 1M. Abhyankar and D. Bastia, manuscript in preparation.1M. Abhyankar and D. Bastia, manuscript in preparation. ori γ is maintained at a very low copy number in IHFΔ cells (22Kelley W.L. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15924-15937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore the DNA-bending protein greatly enhances the efficiency of initiation. In addition to the iterons, π binds to inverted half iterons that form the operator of the ORF 2The abbreviations used are: ORF, open reading frame; pol, polymerase; DTT, dithiothreitol; WT, wild type; nt, nucleotide(s).2The abbreviations used are: ORF, open reading frame; pol, polymerase; DTT, dithiothreitol; WT, wild type; nt, nucleotide(s). encoding the protein and autoregulates π synthesis at the transcriptional level (26Kelley W.L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The π initiator proteins can promote pairing of two sets of iterons in trans as determined by the enhancement of topoisomerase II catalyzed formation of catenated dimers (19Mukherjee S. Patel I. Bastia D. Cell. 1985; 52: 375-385Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This in vitro observation was found to be of biological significance in vivo by Helinski and independently by Chattoraj who showed that plasmid-encoded initiator mediated pairing of iteron arrays causes inactivation of the ori pairs (28McEachern M.J. Bott M.A. Tooker P.A. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7942-7946Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 29Chattoraj D.K. Mason R.J. Wickner S.H.

A. 1991; 88: 9011-9015Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Presumably, the active ori structure consisting of iteron DNA wrapped around monomeric form of π is isomerized into paired arrays of iterons held together by dimeric π. This paired or handcuffed structure apparently shuts down initiation from both of the paired origins (33Pal S.K. Chattoraj D.K. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3554-3560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work using crude extract systems had shown the dependence of the plasmid replication on the plasmid-encoded π protein (9Inuzuka N. Inuzuka M. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11071-11074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Inuzuka M. Helinski D.R. Biochemistry. 1975; 17: 2567-2573Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 35Inuzuka M.a. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 5381-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Our previous work, using a partially fractionated crude extract system, had established that both the host-encoded DnaA and the plasmid-encoded π initiators were needed for initiation from ori γ in vitro (36MacAllister T. Kelley W. Miron A. Stenzel T. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16056-16062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo work showed that ori α and γ but not ori β require the bacterial initiator DnaA for replication (5Kelley W.L. Bastia D. New Biol. 1992; 4: 569-580PubMed Google Scholar, 36MacAllister T. Kelley W. Miron A. Stenzel T. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16056-16062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further advance in the analysis of the mechanism of replication initiation from ori γ and looping-dependent initiation of replication from α and β required the development of a replication system reconstituted from purified proteins. Such a system should not only establish definitively the minimum set of host proteins needed for R6K replication but also should provide an opportunity to dissect the details of the initiation pathway involving dual initiator proteins. Considering the central role played by the γ sequences in initiation, in this report we have developed a reconstituted system of 21 purified host-encoded proteins and the plasmid-encoded π protein that catalyzed replication initiation specifically from ori γ and produced full-length molecules. The replication was mostly of authentic Cairns type (θ type) as revealed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the replication intermediates (37Brewer B.J. Fangman W. Cell. 1987; 51: 463-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). The replication was dependent on DnaA and on π*, a mutant form of π that tended to monomerize upon binding to DNA. The wild type dimeric form of π in contrast was mostly inert in promoting initiation. Optimal replication in vitro required the DNA-bending protein IHF and substitution of IHF by HU elicited sub-optimal replication. Many of the characteristics of the replication in vitro in the reconstituted system mimicked that observed in vivo. In this report, we also present the mapping of the start point of the leading strand(s) and the direction of replication in vitro. Plasmids and Bacterial Strains—The Escherichia coli strain DH5α (F′/end1 hsdR17 (r–k mk)–) glnV44thi-1 recA1 gyrA (Nalr) relA1Δ-(lacYZA-argF) U189 deoR[φ80 dlacΔ(lacZ)M15] was used for all cloning experiments. The plasmid DNA template pMA1 contains the region of R6K starting from the dnaA1 box and extending into HindIII fragment 15 (2Crosa J.H. Luttrop L. Falkow S. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 124: 443-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The DNA prepared by PCR as a BamHI-SphI cassette that lacks the C-terminal 28 amino acids of π and ori β, was cloned between the BamHI-SphI sites of pUC19. Supercoiled DNA was prepared by CsCl-ethidium bromide equilibrium centrifugation. PUC19-OriC template contains the minimal oriC region cloned in the pUC19 vector (38Fang L. Davey M.J. O'Donnell M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 541-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The plasmid pHOC3.2.1 that contains nine subunits of pol III under the transcriptional control of a lac promoter was a gift from Drs. C. McHenry and Arthur Pritchard (University of Colorado, Health Sciences Center (UCHSC), Denver, CO). The plasmid pMA1-DT contained two TerB sites of E. coli cloned ∼350 and ∼1200 bp away and on either sides of oriγ (see Fig. 9A). Proteins and Enzymes—SSB and RNaseH were bought from commercial sources (USB, Cleveland, OH). π protein was purified from an intein vector containing the π ORF fused at the sequence corresponding to its C-terminal end to intein followed by the chitin binding domain. The fusion protein was bound to chitin-agarose affinity column in the absence of reducing agents. The column was then infused with 10 mm DTT and incubated at 4 °C for 12 h followed by 4 h of incubation at 16 °C that caused self-cleavage of intein and release of the π moiety. The fusion was constructed in such a way that intein cleavage generated normal WT π or its mutant form π* (P42L, P106L, and F107S). The mutant form of the protein has a tendency to monomerize when bound to the iterons. The detailed characterization of the mutant forms and the implication of the data for the mechanism of copy control will be published elsewhere. DnaA was purified as described previously (39Weigel C. Schmidt A. Ruckert B. Lurz R. Messer W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6574-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). DnaB and DnaC were purified from an overproducer plasmid that was constructed by Dr. N. Dixon (University of Sydney, Australia) that contained the ORF of DnaB and DnaC under the control of a Tac promoter (40Datta H.J. Khatri G.S. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

GyrA and GyrB were purified from a His6-tagged GyrA open reading frame cloned into the expression vector pET15b and from an intein vector, respectively. The details of GyrA and GyrB purification will be described elsewhere. DNA polymerase III* was reconstituted from the core complex consisting of the α, θ, and ϵ subunits, a gift from Dr. Mike O'Donnell, Rockefeller University (45O'Donnell M. Studwell P.S. J. Biol.

We also purified all of the nine subunits of pol III* from an overproducer plasmid pHOC3.2.1 (a gift from Drs. A. Pritchard and Charles McHenry, UCHSC, Denver, CO). The β sliding clamp was purified from an overproducer plasmid, constructed in our laboratory by Dr. I. Patel. In Vitro Reconstitution of Replication of oriγ—The standard reaction mixture (in 25 μl) contained 40 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 8.0), 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm DTT, 20 μg/ml creatine kinase (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), 5 mm creatine phosphate, 10% glycerol, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 40 μm of each of the dNTPs, 3000 cpm/pmol of [3H]dTTP, 2 mm ATP, 500 μm each of CTP, UTP, and GTP, 1 μg SSB, 120 ng of DnaA, 70 ng of DnaB, 30 ng of DnaC, 30 ng of DnaG, 150 ng of GyrA, 450 ng of GyrB, 20 ng of IHF, 150 ng of pol III holoenzyme, 0.5 unit of RnaseH, 200 ng of ori γ template, and 200 ng of a mutant form (P42L, P106L, and F107S) of π that tends to form monomers. The reaction components were assembled on ice, and the reaction was carried out at 37 °C for various periods of time, stopped by precipitation with 10% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid containing 10% 0.2 m sodium pyrophosphate. The precipitate was trapped on GFC glass fiber filters, dried, and counted with liquid scintillation counter. OriC Replication—Replication in vitro of the pUC19-OriC template was carried out as described previously (38Fang L. Davey M.J. O'Donnell M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 541-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 48Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A.

Origin Mapping by DideoxyNTP Incorporation—The reactions were carried out as described above but with [α-32P]dATP and [α-32P]dCTP and 0, 40, 60, and 80 μm ddTTP. The reaction products were purified as described (44Khatri G.S. MacAllister T. Sista P. Bastia D. Cell. 1989; 59: 667-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis after cleaving with ScaI and HindIII. Replication Intermediates in Neutral Two-dimensional Gels—To investigate the mode of replication, we analyzed the replication intermediates that were synthesized by incorporation of [α-32P]dNTPs cleaved with ScaI and resolved in two-dimensional Brewer-Fangman gels at neutral pH (37Brewer B.J. Fangman W. Cell. 1987; 51: 463-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). In Vitro Termination of Replication—We wished to obtain independent evidence for origin-specific initiation and on the topology of replication by interposing two TerB sites, in the blocking orientation with respect to the ori on either sides of ori γ, resulting in the plasmid pMA1-DT (Fig. 9A). The pMA1-DT template was replicated in vitro by incorporating 32P-labeled precursors, and the intermediates were cleaved and resolved in two-dimensional gels at neutral pH (37Brewer B.J. Fangman W. Cell. 1987; 51: 463-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Primer Extension—Replication intermediates were generated as described above from the template pMA1-DT in the presence of either 3H-labeled or unlabeled precursors. The primers RGPX1 (5′-GCAGTTCAACCTGTTGATAG) and GPX2 (5′-CGATCGTCGTGCGGTATC) were 5′-end-labeled with 32P and separately hybridized to the pool of replication products and subjected to linear, single primer PCR. The products were run in a DNA sequencing gel along with markers generated by dideoxy sequencing reactions made from the same primers. The extension products should end at the 5′-end of the templates and the resolution of the products in DNA sequencing gels provided precise locations of the start points of the leading strands. Protein Components Required for in Vitro Replication— Twenty-two purified proteins (counting the heterodimeric IHF as one protein) were used in the reconstitution experiments. The proteins were checked for purity by being resolved in a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel are shown in Fig. 2. RNaseH was used as a specificity factor to suppress DnaA-independent synthesis (48Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Cell. 1984; 38: 183-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Several pol III* preparations were used that were purified in our laboratory using pHOC3.2.1 (Fig. 2). We have also used highly purified pol III* reconstituted from the individual subunits (gift from Dr. Mike O'Donnell, Rockefeller University) to confirm the results derived from our reconstituted preparations of pol III. Using the ensemble of purified proteins we first replicated bacterial oriC plasmid as a test for the activity of many of the proteins used in the system. The oriC replication also provided us with the means, not only to work out the optimal amount of each protein in the reaction mixture but also to compare and contrast its properties with the replication characteristics of the R6K ori γ system (38Fang L. Davey M.J. O'Donnell M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 541-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 48Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Cell. 1984; 38: 183-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The template pMA1 (Fig. 3A) contained both the γ ori and the ori of the vector pUC19. To make sure that the initiation of replication was not nonspecific, we attempted to replicate both pUC19 and separately pMA1 in vitro and observed that the pUC19 template was inert, whereas the pMA1 template yielded from 150 to 200 pmol of the product after ∼60 min of replication at 37 °C (Fig. 3B). The effects of omission of the various proteins on ori γ replication are shown in Fig. 4. Omission of ATP or the other components of the multiprotein system drastically reduced net synthesis. Although omission of RNaseH caused a modest reduction, RNaseH suppressed, as noted above, DnaA and π independent initiation (48Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Cell. 1984; 38: 183-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Monomeric but Not the Wild Type Dimeric Form of π Was Active in Catalyzing Initiation—Unlike the crude extract system in which wild type (WT) π was active in initiating replication (35Inuzuka M.a. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 5381-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 36MacAllister T. Kelley W. Miron A. Stenzel T. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16056-16062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the initiator was almost inert in the purified reconstituted system (Fig. 5). Addition of π* (P42L, P106L, and F107S) was essential for promoting vigorous DNA replication (Fig. 5). The WT π was dimeric by gel filtration analysis even in the presence of 3 m guanidine chloride, whereas the π* form under identical conditions was monomeric (data not shown). In the absence of guanidium, both types of proteins behaved as dimers. We have observed that, upon binding to an iteron, the π* almost completely dissociates into monomers. 3M. Abhyankar, R. Sharma, J. Reddy, S. Zzaman, and D. Bastia, manuscript in preparation. Therefore, it appears likely that some types of chaperones (the identities of which are not known at this time) monomerize and activate WT π in vivo. Determination of the identities of the chaperones is one of our future goals. Requirement for the DNA-bending Protein IHF—As noted above, the minimal sequence of ori γ contains an ihf site that is embedded in the AT-rich region located between the dnaA1 box and the seven tandem iterons. Replication programmed by WT π requires the bending of DNA by IHF binding to the ihf site (22Kelley W.L. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15924-15937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Filutowicz M. Appelt K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 3829-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In vivo, ori γ tagged with a kanamycin resistance marker can replicate in an IHFΔ strain of E. coli with a very low copy number and form minute colonies. When ampicillin was used as a selection marker, no colonies were recovered on the plates (22Kelley W.L. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15924-15937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We wished to investigate whether the replication in vitro was IHF-dependent, or could it be functionally replaced, as in the oriC system, by supplying HU protein (which is structurally similar to IHF). We carried out replication of oriC and ori γ in vitro with IHF and separately with HU. The results showed that HU could not, as contrasted with the oriC system, fully substitute for IHF in supporting optimal replication of ori γ (up to ∼180 pmol). As expected, IHF and HU were fully interchangeable for oriC replication (Fig. 6). Why does ori γ replicate at all in the absence of IHF in vitro, whereas in vivo its replication by WT π requires IHF? This point is discussed in a later section. Kinetics of Replication Suggested the Formation of a Preinitiation Complex—As observed in other in vitro systems (48Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A.

In contrast, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is processed in the regulated secretory pathway, stored in vesicles, and released in response to neuronal activity, consistent with its role in modulating synaptic plasticity. In this study, we used vaccinia virus infection and transfection methods to monitor the processing and sorting of neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) in AtT-20 cells, which have been used as a model for the sorting of secretory proteins in neurons. Our data show that NT-4 is processed in the constitutive secretory pathway. The molecule is diffusely distributed within the cells and released, soon after being synthesized, in a manner that is not affected by cell depolarization. We further show that NT-4 and BDNF, when co-expressed, can form heterodimers that are constitutively released. In contrast, heterodimers of NT-3 and BDNF have been shown to be released through the regulated secretory pathway.

Previously, we and others have examined the post-cleavage fate of neurotrophins in neurons and neuroendocrine cells to distinguish whether neurotrophins are sorted into the constitutive or regulated secretory pathways. In the constitutive pathway, proteins are rapidly secreted following cleavage, whereas proteins in the regulated pathway are stored within secretory vesicles and released in an activity-dependent manner or in response to extracellular cues (see Ref. 10Burgess T.L. Kelly R.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 243-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar for review). Results show that BDNF is sorted to the regulated secretory pathway of both hippocampal neurons and AtT-20 cells (3Mowla S.J. Pareek S. Farhadi H.F. Petrecca K. Fawcett J.P. Seidah N.G. Morris S.J.

Heterodimers of BDNF and NT-3 are also sorted into the regulated pathway, suggesting that BDNF in some way can exert a dominant influence over the sorting fate of a neurotrophin that is normally slated for continuous release (2Farhadi H.F.

NT-4 (also designated NT-5 or NT-4/5) was first identified in Xenopus and viper (16Hallbook F. Ibanez C.F. Persson H. Neuron. 1991; 6: 845-858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) and subsequently in mammals (17Berkemeier L.R. Winslow J.W. Kaplan D.R. Nikolics K. Goeddel D.V. Rosenthal A.

Like the other neurotrophins, NT-4 promotes the survival of peripheral (19Schober A. Wolf N. Huber K. Hertel R. Krieglstein K. Minichiello L. Kahane N. Widenfalk J. Kalcheim C. Olson L. Klein R.

NT-4 also potentiates transmission at Xenopus neuromuscular junctions in culture (22Wang X. Berninger B. Poo M. J.

However, it is not known whether these effects are promoted directly, following activity-dependent secretion of NT-4, or whether NT-4 is released constitutively and so may only play a permissive role in modulating activity-dependent processes. In this study, we examined the intracellular sorting of NT-4 in neuroendocrine AtT-20 cells, a common model in which to study the sorting of secretory proteins (10Burgess T.L. Kelly R.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 243-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 25Brechler V. Chu W.N. Baxter J.D. Thibault G. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 810-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Results show that NT-4 is sorted into the constitutive pathway. We further show that heterodimers of NT-4 and BDNF are constitutively secreted, unlike heterodimers of BDNF and NT-3, suggesting that coupling NT-4 to BDNF diverts BDNF from the regulated to the constitutive pathway. Cell Culture—AtT-20 cells were maintained in DMEM (Biowhittaker, Walkersville, MD) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 1% glutamax (Invitrogen), and 0.4% gentamicin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Vaccinia Virus Infections—Purified vaccinia virus encoding rat pro-NT-4 was obtained essentially as described for PC1 and PC2 (27Benjannet S. Rondeau N. Day R. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3564-3568Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 28Hruby D.E. Thomas G. Herbert E. Franke C.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 124: 295-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We used the full-length rat NT-4 coding region inserted at the BamHI (5′) and HindIII (3′) sites of the transfer vector PMJ601. The full-length cDNA of pro-NT-4 was generously provided by Regeneron Inc. For metabolic labeling studies, we plated 5 × 105 AtT-20 cells in each well of a 6-well plate (BD Biosciences) and allowed the cells to recover for 2 days. Each dish was then incubated for 1 h with 2.5 × 106 plaque-forming units vaccinia virus in 1.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.01% bovine serum albumin and 1 mm magnesium chloride. The virus was removed, and the cells were allowed to recover for 8 h in supplemented DMEM. For immunostaining, 2 × 105 AtT-20 cells were plated per 60-mm diameter dish (BD Biosciences) and infected with 106 plaque-forming units in 2 ml/dish. Transfections—Rat prepro-NT-4 sequence was extracted from pBluescript SK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by PCR using primers KS (Stratagene), 5′-ATGGTGATGGTGATGCGATCCTCGGGCACGGCCTGTTCGGCTGAGGA-3′ and 5′-TCTTAAGCTTGAATTCTACATCATCATCATGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCGATCC-3′. The product, NT-4-RGS6His (RGS6His is a protein tag with the sequence RGSHHHHHH), was cloned into the EcoRI site of pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) to produce NT-4-RGS6His pCDNA3. pCDNA3 vector containing the sequence for BDNF-HA (BDNF-HA pCDNA3) was produced using a similar strategy. pCDNA3 and EGFP-N1 (Clontech) were used for some transfections. Transfections with Superfect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) were carried out using a modification of the manufacturer's instructions. For monitoring the release of proteins in response to depolarization, we plated 5 × 105 AtT-20 cells/well of a 6-well plate and allowed the cells to recover for 2 days. A total of 4 μg of plasmid DNA in Tris/EDTA buffer was mixed with 100 μl of DMEM with no supplements. For co-transfections, equal amounts of each plasmid were used. Superfect (13.3 μl) was mixed into the solution by vortexing for 5 s. The suspension was incubated at room temperature for 10 min before being mixed with 600 μl of complete medium, which was added immediately to the cells. After a 3-h incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2, the mixture was removed and replaced with 1.5–2 ml of complete medium. For immunostaining, the same procedures were followed with some modifications. 1.1 × 105 cells were plated into each chamber of a four-chambered slide (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL). Complexes were formed between a total of 0.43 μg of DNA and 2.85 μl of Superfect in 12.8 μl of DMEM. After the incubation, 87.5 μl of complete medium was added to the mixture before complexes were added to the cells, and following transfection, the cells were maintained in 0.5 ml of DMEM. In experiments in which the cells were transfected with two different vectors, it was assumed that any cell transfected with one vector would also express the other. This assumption is based on the nature of the Superfect-DNA complex. Each complex contains multiple plasmids. When two plasmids are used in equal amounts, the probability of all plasmids in a single complex being identical is very low. This was supported by our observations of cells co-transfected with pCDNA3 encoding BDNF along with EGFP-N1. Very few cells immunopositive for the neurotrophin failed to also express GFP. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Vaccinia virus-infected AtT-20 cells were washed twice and incubated for 1 h in Cys-Met-free DMEM (Biowhittaker) containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 1% glutamax, and 0.4% gentamicin. The cells were incubated for 1 h in 1 ml of the same medium containing 0.3 mCi 35S translabel (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (70% methionine, 30% cysteine). Cells were washed twice and incubated with 1 ml of medium supplemented with excess non-radioactive cysteine/methionine for 0–8 h, and the media were saved. The cells were washed three times with PBS and then lysed in 1 ml of RIPA (150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, with protease inhibitors). The lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was collected. Non-specific binding was reduced by incubating lysates and media with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) saturated with normal rabbit serum. To immunoprecipitate NT-4, we incubated the supernatants with 0.8 μg of anti-NT-4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. (In controls, non-immune serum replaced the primary antibody or 50 μl of the peptide against which the antibody was raised (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added along with the antibody.) Twenty μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose in RIPA was added to the samples and incubated for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with 1 ml of RIPA, boiled for 5 min in 50 μl of sample buffer, vortexed, and centrifuged. The supernatants were analyzed by 13–22% SDS-PAGE. The samples were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Osmonics, Westborough, MA), which was rinsed, dried, and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Amersham Biosciences). Deglycosylation Experiments—Cells were lysed immediately following incubation with 35S translabel and immunoprecipitated as described above. After two washes with RIPA, the beads were treated as follows. For N-glycanase digestion, the beads were resuspended in 188 μlof0.2 m NaPO4, pH 7.6, 0.1% SDS, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Twelve μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. N-glycanase (4.5 μl, New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) was added, and the beads were incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. Low salt wash buffer (900 μl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5) was added, and the beads were centrifuged and washed twice more with low salt buffer followed by boiling in sample buffer and electrophoresis on SDS gels as described above. For endoglycosidase H digestion, the beads were washed once with incubation buffer (20 mm NaPO4, pH 6.0, 20 mm NaCl) and resuspended in 200 μl of incubation buffer. 5 μl of endoglycosidase H (Roche Applied Science, Laval QC) was added, and the beads were incubated for 18 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with low salt buffer and analyzed as described above. Immunostaining—Transfected cells were washed twice with PBS, incubated for 15 min in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed three times for 5 min each with cold PBS, incubated for 5 min in ice-cold 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, rinsed once with PBS, and blocked for at least 2 h in blocking solution (6% normal goat serum plus 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS). The blocking solution was removed, and the cells were incubated with the primary antibodies in 50% blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. Anti-NT-4 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) and anti-HA (Covance, Richmond, CA) were diluted 1:500, anti-EEA1 (BD Biosciences) was diluted 1:2500, and anti-GM130 (BD Biosciences) was diluted 1:250. The cells were washed three times with 1 ml of PBS for 5 min and incubated in 1:500 anti-rabbit Cy-3 (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) or 1:500 anti-mouse Cy-3 along with 1:500 Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit (Molecular probes, Eugene, OR) for the co-staining experiments, in 50% blocking solution for 1 h in the dark at room temperature. The cells were washed and mounted in Immunon (Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA). Epifluorescence was visualized using a Zeiss LSM5 Pascal confocal microscope. Images were prepared for publication using Adobe PhotoShop. In some cases, γ adjustment was used to emphasize the signals. Neurotrophin Release—Neurotrophin release from cells was stimulated and measured using a modification of a method described previously (11Goodman L.J. Valverde J. Lim F. Geschwind M.D. Federoff H.J. Geller A.I. Hefti F. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 222-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed 3 × 15 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2 with a control solution (127 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.33 mm Na2HPO4, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 4.2 mm NaHCO3, 5.2 mm CaCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) followed by a 30-min incubation with 1 ml of the same solution. The solution from this incubation was saved, and the cells were incubated for 30 min with 1 ml of a depolarizing solution (the same as for the control solution except with 77 mm NaCl and 55 mm KCl). Cells were washed three times with PBS, lysed in 1 ml of RIPA. The lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 16,000 × g, and the supernatant was saved. To detect the RGS6 His-tagged NT-4, we brought the samples to 20 mm imidazole, 10% fetal bovine serum, and incubated them with 20 μl of Ni-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen) overnight at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were washed three times with 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, before being boiled in sample buffer, vortexed, centrifuged, and separated by 15% SDS-PAGE. The samples were transferred to nitrocellulose (Osmonics) (400 mA for 90 min), blocked for 1 h in 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween, and incubated overnight at 4 °C in 1:1000 or 1:250 anti-RGS6 His (Qiagen) in 5% milk. The blot was washed 3 × 15 min in Tris-buffered saline with Tween, incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 1:1000 anti-mouse peroxidase (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories), washed three times as before, and visualized using ECL (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). HA-tagged BDNF was immunoprecipitated using 1 μl of rabbit anti-HA (Covance) and protein A-Sepharose beads. Immunoblotting was performed with 1:1000 mouse anti-HA (Covance). To specifically detect NT-4-RGS6 His/BDNF-HA heterodimers, samples were incubated with Ni-NTA-agarose beads, and the beads were washed as above. Following a fourth 5-min wash, the NT-4 RGS6 His-containing dimers were incubated in 50 μl of 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, for 10 min, vortexed, and centrifuged, and the supernatant was analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE. Immunodetection of the BDNF-HA was done using 1:1000 mouse anti-HA (Covance). Quantitative Analysis—Exposed films were digitized in TIFF format and analyzed using Image J 1.29 (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Following background subtraction, each band density, along with a background control, was quantified. For each analysis, the selection area was kept constant. For each band, the background was subtracted, and ratios were calculated. The data were statistically analyzed by two-way analysis of variance followed by Student Newman Keuls post-hoc test. Synthesis, Processing, and Glycosylation of Pro-NT-4 in Virally Transduced AtT-20 Cells—To examine the processing and sorting of NT-4, we infected AtT-20 cells with recombinant vaccinia virus encoding rat prepro-NT-4. The protein produced by these cells was metabolically labeled and immunoprecipitated with an antibody that recognizes an epitope in the C-terminal region of the mature form of NT-4. Specific bands corresponding to pro-NT-4 and mature NT-4 were observed (Fig. 1A) that were not immunoprecipitated by non-immune rabbit serum or when excess competing peptide was added along with the antibody. The protein evident on the gel with a lower apparent molecular weight than the precursor was induced in response to wild-type virus infection (data not shown) and therefore was non-specific. The molecular mass predicted from the primary amino acid sequence of pro-NT-4 is 20 kDa. However, in our experiments, pro-NT-4 has an apparent molecular mass of ∼28 kDa, suggesting that the precursor is glycosylated, as has been demonstrated with NGF (4Seidah N.G. Benjannet S. Pareek S. Savaria D. Hamelin J. Goulet B. Laliberte J. Lazure C. Chretien M. Murphy R.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and BDNF (29Mowla S.J. Farhadi H.F. Pareek S. Atwal J.K. Morris S.J. Seidah N.G. Murphy R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12660-12666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). To test for glycosylation, we digested the immunoprecipitated lysate with either N-glycanase or endoglycosidase H. Removal of N-linked carbohydrate residues with N-glycanase reduced the apparent molecular mass of the NT-4 precursor to ∼23 kDa. (Fig. 1B). Treatment with endoglycosidase H, which removes high mannose sugar moieties, also reduced the apparent molecular mass of the precursor. In both cases, the non-specific band seen in Fig. 1A is also detected. Absence of an NT-4 endoglycosidase H-resistant band suggests that pro-NT-4 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum and rapidly cleaved upon entering the trans-Golgi network, as reported previously for other neurotrophins (4Seidah N.G. Benjannet S. Pareek S. Savaria D. Hamelin J. Goulet B. Laliberte J. Lazure C. Chretien M. Murphy R.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 5Seidah N.G. Benjannet S. Pareek S. Chretien M. Murphy R.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Alternatively, pro-NT-4 may remain endoglycosidase H-sensitive even upon entering the trans-Golgi network, as has been reported for the convertases PC1 and PC2 (30Benjannet S. Rondeau N. Paquet L. Boudreault A. Lazure C. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Kinetics of Processing and Release of NT-4—To examine the processing and release of NT-4, we metabolically labeled virally infected AtT-20 cells and monitored the time course of processing and release of NT-4 by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE. Fig. 2 shows that the precursor is rapidly cleaved to yield mature NT-4, with almost no precursor evident in cell extracts after 2 h. At the same time, significant amounts of mature NT-4 accumulate in the conditioned media. Processed NT-4 was not detected in the lysate at any time, indicating that, rather than being stored intracellularly, it is primarily released rapidly after being cleaved. Released NT-4 begins to disappear with chase times longer than 2 h, probably due to proteolytic degradation in the media and/or cellular endocytosis followed by lysosomal degradation. The lack of retention of NT-4 within the cells and its rapid release is characteristic of proteins secreted from the constitutive secretory pathway and was similar to that of NGF (3Mowla S.J. Pareek S. Farhadi H.F. Petrecca K. Fawcett J.P. Seidah N.G. Morris S.J. Sossin W.S. Murphy R.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2069-2080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and NT-3 (2Farhadi H.F. Mowla S.J. Petrecca K. Morris S.J. Seidah N.G. Murphy R.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4059-4068Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but not BDNF (2Farhadi H.F. Mowla S.J. Petrecca K. Morris S.J. Seidah N.G. Murphy R.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4059-4068Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Mowla S.J. Pareek S. Farhadi H.F. Petrecca K. Fawcett J.P. Seidah N.G. Morris S.J. Sossin W.S. Murphy R.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2069-2080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We did not detect secretion of pro-NT-4 under these conditions. Previous studies have failed to detect secretion of pro-NGF or pro-NT-3 by identical assays, although significant amounts of pro-BDNF were secreted (2Farhadi H.F. Mowla S.J. Petrecca K. Morris S.J. Seidah N.G. Murphy R.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4059-4068Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Mowla S.J. Pareek S. Farhadi H.F. Petrecca K. Fawcett J.P. Seidah N.G. Morris S.J. Sossin W.S. Murphy R.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2069-2080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NT-4 Is Constitutively Secreted—The secretion kinetics we observed suggested that NT-4 is in the constitutive secretory pathway rather than the regulated secretory pathway. To test this idea further, we asked whether cell depolarization would stimulate NT-4 release, which would only occur if NT-4 were in the regulated pathway. AtT-20 cells were transfected with NT-4-RGS6His plasmid, and conditioned medium was collected over 2 days following transfection. The cells were exposed to non-depolarizing solution and depolarized for 30 min, and finally, the cells were lysed. Mature NT-4-RGS6His was evident in all four samples, with no difference between the amounts released into the non-depolarizing and depolarizing media (Fig. 3A). Thus, the release of NT-4 was not influenced by depolarization. We were able to detect a significant amount of pro-NT-4 in the media conditioned over 2 days, but not in either of the test solutions, each conditioned for only 30 min (Fig. 3A). In contrast, Fig. 3B shows that the depolarizing solution stimulated the release of BDNF, which is known to be in the regulated secretory pathway, ∼2-fold (11Goodman L.J. Valverde J. Lim F. Geschwind M.D. Federoff H.J. Geller A.I. Hefti F. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 222-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous data (3Mowla S.J. Pareek S. Farhadi H.F. Petrecca K. Fawcett J.P. Seidah N.G. Morris S.J. Sossin W.S. Murphy R.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2069-2080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) we also observed release of pro-BDNF into the media, although pro-BDNF was detected at far lower levels than the mature protein. In many, but not all cases, pro-BDNF was also detected in the 30-min test solutions. Pro-BDNF release was independent of activity (see Fig. 5, C and D). Our methods for detecting N"

Members of the Ca2+-binding proteins play a central function in the transduction of Ca2+ signals, exerting their roles through a Ca2+-dependent interaction with their target proteins, spatially and temporally. By performing a suppression subtractive hybridization screen we identified a novel mouse gene, Scarf (skin calmodulin-related factor), which has homology to calmodulin (CaM)-like Ca2+-binding protein genes and is exclusively expressed in differentiating keratinocytes in the epidermis. The Scarf open reading frame encodes a 148-amino acid protein that contains four conserved EF-hand motifs (predicted to be Ca2+-binding domains) and has homology to mouse CaM, human CaM-like protein, hClp, and human CaM-like skin protein, hClsp. The functionality of Scarf EF-hand domains was assayed with a radioactive Ca2+-binding method. By Southern blot and computational genome sequence analysis, a highly related gene, Scarf2, was found 15 kb downstream of Scarf on mouse chromosome 13. The functional Scarf Ca2+-binding domains suggest a role in the regulation of epidermal differentiation through the control of Ca2+-mediated signaling.

Keratinocytes follow a complex program of differentiation from the basal layer to the spinous and granular layers of the epidermis, which ultimately leads to the formation of a waterimpermeable barrier. The final phase in epidermal differentiation is characterized by granular cell death, destruction of organelles, covalent cross-linking of cornified envelope precursors by Ca2+-dependent transglutaminases (TGases), 1The abbreviations used are: TGasetransglutaminasePKCprotein kinase CPKAprotein kinase ACaMcalmodulinhClphuman calmodulin-like proteinhClsphuman calmodulin-like skin proteinORFopen reading frameSSHsuppression subtractive hybridizationLORloricrinINVinvolucrinKIkeratin 1K5keratin 5rScarfrecombinant Scarf proteinRT-PCRreverse transcription PCRH89N-[2–99p-bromocinnamyl-O-amino-O-ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamideKN621-[N,O-bis-5-isoquinolinesulfonyl-N-methyl-l-tyrosyl]-4-phenylpiperazineGFGF109203X (bisindolylmaleimide I).1The abbreviations used are: TGasetransglutaminasePKCprotein kinase CPKAprotein kinase ACaMcalmodulinhClphuman calmodulin-like proteinhClsphuman calmodulin-like skin proteinORFopen reading frameSSHsuppression subtractive hybridizationLORloricrinINVinvolucrinKIkeratin 1K5keratin 5rScarfrecombinant Scarf proteinRT-PCRreverse transcription PCRH89N-[2–99p-bromocinnamyl-O-amino-O-ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamideKN621-[N,O-bis-5-isoquinolinesulfonyl-N-methyl-l-tyrosyl]-4-phenylpiperazineGFGF109203X (bisindolylmaleimide I). and attachment of lipid molecules to the cross-linked envelopes (1Kalinin A.

This program is accomplished through specific transcriptional induction and repression of structural and enzymatic differentiation-specific markers (2Eckert R.L. Welter J.F. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1996; 23: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The differentiation process can be recapitulated partially in mouse keratinocytes cultivated in vitro by increasing the Ca2+ concentration in the culture medium (3Yuspa S.H. Kilkenny A.E. Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1207-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) and is associated with the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) (4Dlugosz A.A. Yuspa S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). This produces a situation that mimics the endogenous Ca2+ gradient present in the skin, with low extracellular levels surrounding the basal cells and increasing levels toward the upper granular layers (5Menon G.K. Grayson S. Elias P.M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1985; 84: 508-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar).

A crucial role for the transduction of the Ca2+ signal is accomplished by members of the Ca2+-binding proteins, which are characterized by the presence of a common helix-loop-helix structural motif in their Ca2+-binding domain, termed EF-hand (6Nelson M.R. Chazin W.J. Calmodulin and Signal Transduction. Academic Press, London1998: 17-59Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These proteins function by undergoing conformational changes upon binding of Ca2+, allowing the association and regulation of activity of a range of specific target proteins. EF-hand-containing proteins have been described in epidermis; these include the large proteins profilaggrin and repetin (7Presland R.B. Bassuk J.A. Kimball J.R. Dale B.A. J. Investig.

We present the cloning, genomic structure, expression, and functional assay for a novel mouse Ca2+-binding protein that we have termed Scarf. The Scarf open reading frame (ORF) codes for a small protein with four EF-hand Ca2+-binding domains. The Scarf gene and protein are differentially expressed in vivo in the spinous and granular layers of the epidermis. We also present the identification of a second highly homologous gene, Scarf2, which localizes 15 kb downstream from Scarf in the mouse chromosome 13. We propose that Scarf and Scarf2 are new members of the CaM-like proteins with potential roles in the Ca2+-dependent epidermal differentiation process. Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH)—An SSH screen was performed following the instructions of the manufacturer (Clontech) using basal cell RNA as a “driver” and suprabasal cell RNA as a “tester” (18Diatchenko L. Lau Y.F. Campbell A.P. Chenchik A. Moqadam F. Huang B. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K. Gurskaya N. Sverdlov E.D. Siebert P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The primary mouse basal and suprabasal keratinocytes were obtained from neonatal skins that were trypsinized overnight at 4 °C and then separated by a discontinuous Percoll gradient (20Lichti U. Yuspa S.H. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 74-81PubMed Google Scholar). From this screen, we identified a partial cDNA sequence (231 bp), which corresponded to a partial coding region of a novel mouse gene we called Scarf (113–344 bp). The upstream sequence was obtained by performing rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE, Clontech) utilizing a genespecific oligonucleotide (5′-tgaacacagcccgcagctcccctgctctgtgccc-3′). The complete mRNA sequence was deposited in GenBank™ (accession no. AY293058). Cloning and Genomic Sequences Analysis of Scarf and Scarf2—A genomic DNA region of ∼120 kb was cloned through screening of a mouse VJ/129 BAC library (Genome Systems Inc.) using an 0.9-kb Scarf cDNA as a probe. Comparison of the genomic and cDNA sequences determined the 5′- and 3′-end boundaries, the absence of intronic regions in the Scarf gene, and the identification of a Scarf-related gene that we termed Scarf2 (GenBank™ accession no. AY314008). For sequence homology searches we used a BLAST analysis (basic local alignment search tool), made available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST). Cell Culture—Primary mouse keratinocytes were isolated from trypsinized newborn BALB/c mouse skins and cultured as reported previously (19Park G.T. Lim S. Jang S.-I. Morasso M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45195-45202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Keratinocytes were cultured in medium with 0.05 mm Ca2+ to maintain a basal-like population of undifferentiated cells (3Yuspa S.H. Kilkenny A.E. Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1207-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with different inhibitors at 10 μm concentration: a PKC inhibitor, GF109203X; a PKA inhibitor, H89; and a CaM kinase II inhibitor, KN62. Differentiation was achieved by increasing the Ca2+ concentration in the medium to 0.12 mm. Northern Blots and Gene Expression—Total RNA was isolated from basal and suprabasal keratinocytes and mouse primary keratinocytes differentiated in vitro using TRIZOL (Invitrogen). The RNA samples (1–3 μg) were electrophoresed in 1.2% agarose-methymercuryhydroxide gels, electroblotted to nylon membranes, and hybridized according to Church and Gilbert (21Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7251) Google Scholar). An mRNA dot blot and Northern blot for mouse tissues were purchased from Clontech and used according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The mouse-specific probes used were: the 3′-untranslated regions for loricrin (LOR), keratin 5 (K5), and keratin 1 (K1) (kindly provided by Dr. Yuspa and Dr. Compton). For the early differentiation marker involucrin (INV), the expressed sequence tag clone AA798100 was utilized. The coding region of CaM used as probe was obtained by PCR with the following gene-specific oligonucleotides: Forward, 5′-tccgttcttccttcttcgctcgcaccatggc-3′, and Reverse, 5′-gtgtgtggacagaggggcttctgacatcag-3′. The Scarf coding region was obtained by PCR using: Forward, 5′-gccggatccagatgtctcacgggtttactaaggag-3′, and Reverse, 5′-gccggatccttttaaatgtggaggcgcacaaactc-3′. A glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe was used to control for RNA integrity (22Fort P. Marty L. Piechaczyk M. el Sabrouty S. Dani C. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1970) Google Scholar). For the RT-PCR reactions, cDNA was synthesized by Superscript II kit (Invitrogen) using 0.2 μg of mRNA isolated from the total RNA of suprabasal keratinocytes with an Oligotex kit (Qiagen). The oligonucleotides used were: Forward Scarf2, 5′-tactaaggaggagaataaggatggcc-3′, and Reverse Scarf2, 5′-gtcagtcagatatgtggaccttgtat-3′. As a negative control, an RT-PCR reaction was performed with no cDNA input. PCR reactions were 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. Radioactive in Situ Hybridization—RNA probes corresponding to the sense and antisense strands of mouse Scarf partial cDNA (202–447 bp) were prepared using T7 and Sp6 RNA polymerase. In situ hybridization was performed at high stringency on consecutive sagittal sections of 8-, 9-, 15-, and 16-day mouse embryos and neonatal skin as described by Mackem and Mahon (23Mackem S. Mahon K.A. Development. 1991; 112: 791-806PubMed Google Scholar). Protein Expression and Purification—Scarf coding sequence was obtained by PCR and subcloned into the BamHI site of the pET-28c(+) vector (Novagen). The recombinant protein was expressed in BL21(DE3) and contained a His tag and a T7 tag at the NH2 terminus of the protein. The soluble recombinant protein was purified over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose column (Ni-NTA, Qiagen). We analyzed the predicted protein sequence using the Swiss Institute of Experimental Cancer Research tools (www.isrec.isb-sib.ch/), and Mac-Vector version 6.5.3. Mutations in the EF-hand motifs to generate the pET-28c/Scarf mutants were performed using the QuikChange sitedirected mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The conserved first Asp residue of each EF-hand motif (sequence GAC) was replaced with a Gly residue (GCC sequence). Mutant recombinant proteins were purified on nickelnitrilotriacetic acid spin columns (Qiagen). mtEF1–4 represent the mutated forms of Scarf in each EF-hand 1–4 motif, respectively. Anti-Scarf antibody against the full-length protein was generated in hens (Aves Laboratories). Recombinant hClsp was obtained by subcloning a PCR fragment containing the ORF into the BamHI site of pET-28a(+) vector (Novagen). The oligonucleotides used were: Forward, 5′-gccggatccatggccggtgagctgact-3′, and Reverse, 5′-cggggatcctcactcctgggcgagcat-3′. PCR reactions were performed for 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 58 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. Purification of the recombinant hClsp was performed as mentioned above. hClp recombinant protein was kindly provided by Dr. Strehler. Immunohistochemistry and Western Blot Analysis—Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on paraffin-embedded 8-μm sections of murine neonatal skin. The deparaffinized sections were treated with a 1:2000 dilution of the anti-Scarf primary antibody overnight at 4 °C and a 1:200 dilution of anti-IgY fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Aves Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were visualized by fluorescence microscopy. For Western blot analysis, basal and suprabasal keratinocytes were incubated separately in lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min. Soluble fractions were collected, and insoluble pellets were resuspended in 6 m urea buffer (6 m urea, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 5 mm EDTA, 0.05% SDS). 25 μg of total protein extract or 1 μg of recombinant CaM-like Ca2+-binding proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed using anti-Scarf primary antibody (1:5000) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-chicken IgG or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-chicken IgG secondary antibody (1:2000; Aves Laboratories). Calcium Binding Assay—Calcium binding was assayed by the micro method described by Kawasaki et al. (24Kawasaki H. Kasai H. Okuyama T Anal. Biochem. 1985; 148: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 μg of the recombinant proteins were blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and washed with two changes of methanol for 5 min, after which the membrane was soaked in 10 μm CaCl2, 50mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and incubated for 1 h with 10 μCi of 45Ca2+/ml in the same buffer. The filter was washed twice for 30 s at room temperature in a solution containing 10 μm CaCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tri-HCl (pH 7.5), and 10% methanol, dried, and exposed to an x-ray film. The autoradiograms were quantitated on a densitometer. The ability to bind Ca2+ by the recombinant proteins was assayed in three independent experiments. Scarf Cloning and Genomic and Protein Characterization—A cDNA differentially expressed in suprabasal keratinocytes was obtained from an SSH screen. Scarf 899-bp cDNA (Fig. 1A) contains an ORF that encodes a protein of 148 amino acids with four EF-hand domains (Fig. 1A, bold letters) and a predicted molecular mass of 16.7 kDa. As is characteristic of other members of the CaM-like Ca2+-binding proteins, Scarf is an acidic protein (pI = 4.59) with no cysteine or tryptophan residues. A particular difference with calcium-binding proteins (13Haeseleer F. Sokal I. Verlinde C.L.M.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. Fariss R.N. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1247-1260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 14Haeseleer F. Imanishi Y. Sokal I. Filiek S. Palczewski K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) is that Scarf does not present putative sites for myristoylation. Comparison of the four EF-hand motifs of Scarf and other CaM-like proteins showed high homology in the EF-2, -3, and -4 motifs, with EF-1 being the most divergent (Fig. 1B). Protein sequence comparisons determined that Scarf presented 56.7% similarity to mouse CaM (mCaM), 64.2% to hClp, and 64.9% hClsp (Fig. 1C). A phylogenic analysis of several Ca2+-binding proteins shows that Scarf and hClsp belong to the same subgroup and are more distantly related to CaM and hClp (data not shown). A genomic DNA region of ∼120 kb was cloned by screening of a mouse VJ/129 BAC library using an 0.9-kb Scarf cDNA probe. Comparison of the genomic and cDNA sequences determined the 5′- and 3′-end boundaries and the absence of intronic regions in the Scarf gene. Southern blot analysis of the BAC clone helped us identify the existence of a second gene with homology to Scarf. We termed this second gene Scarf2. Computational analysis of the Scarf2 genomic sequence proposed that a complete ORF would be derived after the splicing of a putative small intronic region. To determine whether the gene was expressed in keratinocytes and whether the transcript was the product of a splicing event, Scarf2-specific oligonucleotides encoding sequences surrounding the putative intronic region (Fig. 2A) were utilized to perform RT-PCR with mouse keratinocytes mRNA. As shown in Fig. 2A (lower panel), a fragment was obtained, and after subcloning and subsequent sequencing we determined that the predicted intronic sequence had been spliced to generate the Scarf2 mRNA transcript. As a control reaction, RT-PCR was performed with the same set of primers and no input cDNA. Therefore, Scarf2 is expressed in keratinocytes; the mRNA sequence and putative ORF is presented in Fig. 1A. The Scarf2 gene localized 15.3 kb downstream of Scarf (Fig. 2B), and the high degree of homology between Scarf and Scarf2 extended to regions upstream and downstream of the ORF for both genes. These regions contain potential proximal promoter and regulatory sequences (Fig. 2B). The upstream regions (Fig. 2B, striped boxes) are 1.6 kb in length and 96% homologous. The downstream regions (Fig. 2B, gray boxes) are 1.2 kb in length and 89.5% homologous. A mouse gene with homology to hClp (mClp) localized ∼33 kb upstream from the Scarf gene. Comparison of the genomic organization of the CaM-like genes in human chromosome 10 and the syntenic region on mouse chromosome 13 is shown in Fig. 2B. Human and mouse show similar genomic arrangement, with Scarf and hClsp being potential homologs and the differences being that hClp is in reverse transcriptional orientation and the apparent absence of a Scarf2 homolog of human chromosome 10. Scarf Expression during Development and in Cultured Primary Keratinocytes—Using Northern blot analysis and radioactive in situ hybridization, we examined the pattern of Scarf expression during development and in mouse primary keratinocytes. In situ hybridization of sagittal sections of 15-day (Fig. 3, A and B) and 16-day (Fig. 3, C and D) mouse embryos with antisense Scarf probes (Fig. 3, A and C), showed epidermis-specific expression at both developmental stages. The expression was not detected in the basal layer, but was clearly seen within the spinous and granular layers in the stratified epidermis of 16-day embryos (Fig. 3, E and F). Expression was also detected in the dorsum of the tongue (Fig. 3, H and I) and in the vibrissae of a 16-day mouse embryo (Fig. 3, J and K). Scarf expression was restricted to the differentiated layers of the stratified epidermis in neonatal skin (Fig. 3, L and M). No expression was detected with the use of Scarf sense probe (Fig. 3, B, D, G, and N). Using a commercial Northern blot of total embryo mRNA at different developmental stages, Scarf was first detected at 15 days of embryogenesis and dramatically increased by day 17 (Fig. 4A). Sites of expression detected on a dot blot and Northern blot of different adult tissues (Clontech) were thyroid (data not shown) and skeletal muscle (Fig. 4B). Using the commercial blot, no expression was detected in heart, brain, spleen, lung, liver, kidney, or testis (Fig. 4B). With the hybridization of the commercial blot to a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe to determine loading amounts and integrity of the mRNA, it became apparent that there was less input from the spleen, lung, and testis samples. For this reason, it is not possible to clearly assess the expression level of Scarf in these tissues. In the epidermis, Scarf expression was restricted to the suprabasal differentiated cells obtained by Percoll gradient of preparations from neonatal skins (Fig. 4C). Several epidermis-specific markers were utilized to validate the Percoll separation method for basal (B) and suprabasal (SB) cells (Fig. 4C). The K5 marker is restricted to the basal fraction, whereas the markers INV, LOR, and K1 are primarily in the suprabasal fraction. The ubiquitously expressed CaM mRNA was detected in both proliferating and differentiated keratinocytes (Fig. 4C). The expression of Scarf was also studied in cultured primary keratinocytes induced to differentiate in vitro. Scarf expression was detectable in low Ca2+ (0.05 mm) and showed a 4-fold increase 24 h after induction of differentiation by raising the Ca2+ concentration to 0.12 mm and a further increase by 48 h (Fig. 4D). Northern blots were also hybridized with basal cellspecific marker (K5) and suprabasal differentiation-specific markers (K1, LOR, and INV). The Scarf expression pattern in cultured keratinocytes mimics that of early differentiation markers such as INV, whereas the late epidermal differentiation marker, LOR, was detected 48 h after Ca2+ switch. Treatment of cultured cells with different kinase (PKC, PKA, CaM kinase II) inhibitors showed a specific down-regulation of Scarf expression by treatment with a PKC inhibitor, GF109203X (Fig. 4E). We also determined the down-regulation for other epidermal factors (INV, KI, and LOR), where expression is dependent on the PKC signaling pathway. No effect on Scarf expression was seen with treatment with PKA inhibitor H89 and CaM kinase II inhibitor KN62. Scarf Ca2+-binding Protein in Differentiated Keratinocytes—To assess the expression of Scarf protein in epidermis, we performed immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections of mouse neonatal skin with a polyclonal antibody generated in hens against the full-length recombinant protein (rScarf). Scarf protein was clearly detected from the spinous layers to anucleated cells of the stratum corneum in neonatal skin sections using a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary anti-body against hen (shown in green, Fig. 5A). Propidium iodide counter-stain determined the localization of the nuclei (Fig. 5A, shown in red). In Western blot assays, anti-Scarf polyclonal antibody detected rScarf and the endogenous Scarf protein in the soluble fraction of suprabasal cells (Fig. 5B). No Scarf was detected in the insoluble fractions of either basal or suprabasal keratinocytes. Using several recombinant CaM-like proteins in a Western blot analysis, Scarf antibody weakly detected recombinant hClsp but had no cross-reactivity to either hClp or CaM (Fig. 5C). To investigate the capability of Scarf to bind Ca2+ and the functionality of each of the EF-hand motifs, we performed Ca2+ binding assays. Scarf mutants were obtained by substituting the conserved first Asp residue of each EF-hand motif (sequence GAC) with a Gly residue (GCC sequence) to generate mtEF1, mtEF2, mtEF3, and mtEF4. Parallel binding assays were performed with CaM as control, several CaM-like Ca2+-binding proteins (CaM, hClsp, and hClp), rScarf, and each recombinant mutant. Quantitation of the autoradiograms with a densitometer show that Scarf is able to bind Ca2+ (Fig. 6A) and that mutations in each of the EF-hand motifs lead to a diminished ability to bind Ca2+, with mutation of the EF-2 domain showing the highest effect (Fig. 6B). The data presented are the mean from three independent experiments ± S.D. (Fig. 6B). Identification of differentially expressed proteins during epidermal stratification will help us elucidate the necessary precursors and the series of complex steps that are required for the formation of a functional water barrier in the skin. By performing an SSH screen between the undifferentiated and differentiated cells of the neonatal mouse epidermis, we identified a novel murine Ca2+-binding protein gene we termed Scarf. Sequencing of the full-length cDNA determined that Scarf contained regions that would translate into putative EF-hand Ca2+-binding motifs. The presence of four EF-hand motifs and the degree of homology to CaM indicate that Scarf belongs to the family of CaM-like Ca2+-binding proteins. In the in situ hybridization data, we showed that Scarf mRNA was expressed throughout the differentiated layers of the embryonic developing epidermis. In neonatal epidermis, the Scarf gene was also differentially expressed in the spinous and granular layers. An 0.9-kb mRNA Scarf transcript was detected in suprabasal cells obtained from neonatal epidermis by discontinuous Percoll gradients and in primary keratinocytes differentiated in vitro. Scarf expression was similar to that of other early differentiation markers such as INV and was dependent on PKC signaling. The Scarf transcript encodes a small acidic protein of 148 amino acids detected with anti-Scarf-specific antibodies in the suprabasal layers of the epidermis. Scarf EF-hand motifs maintain the highly conserved residues present in the canonical 12 residue EF-hand motif (DXDX(D/N)GX(I/V)XXXE) (12Crivici A. Ikura M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-binding ability and functionality of each Scarf EF-motif were tested. Our results indicate that Scarf is able to bind Ca2+ and mutations in each EF-hand lead to a decreased ability to bind Ca2+, with mutations in the EF-2 hand motif being the most effective. For the CaM-like protein hClsp, it has recently been reported that its four EF-hand motifs bind Ca2+, but the motifs have been defined as two Ca2+-Mg2+ high affinity binding motifs (EF-1 and EF-2) and two low Ca2+-binding motifs (EF-3 and EF-4) (25Durussel I. Mehul B. Bernard D. Schmidt R. Cox J.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5439-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In CaM, mutations of the EF-2 motif decreased its affinity for several of its known target proteins: smooth and skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinases, adenyl cyclase, and plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (26Gao Z.H. Krebs J. VanBerkum M.F.A. Tang W.-J. Maune J.F. Means A.R. Stull J.T. Beckingham K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20096-20104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether Scarf EF-hands have differential affinity for Ca2+, whether the motifs are independent or mutually interactive, and what physiological relevance this has for its capacity to interact with its specific target proteins in the mouse epidermis. Targets for other members of the CaM-like binding-protein family have been reported, with hClp binding a human unconventional myosin X (27Rogers M.S. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12182-12189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), CaBPs binding the inositol trisphosphate receptor (Ins-P3-R) (28Yang J. McBride S. Mak D.D. Vardi N. Palczewski K. Haeseleer F. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7711-7716Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and hClsp binding TGase3 (17Mehul B. Bernard D. Schmidt R. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2001; 116: 905-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TGases are Ca2+-dependent enzymes that catalyze the N-(γ-glutamyl)lysine isopeptide bonds that occur during the cross-linking of precursors to form the specialized cornified cell envelope in the epidermis (1Kalinin A. Kajava A.V. Steinert P.M. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-dependent binding of hClsp to TGase3 is a potential way of regulating epidermal differentiation through the modulation of TGase3 enzyme activity (16Mehul B. Bernard D. Simonetti L. Bernard M.A. Schmidt R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12841-12847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Alternatively, members of the S100 EF-hand-containing protein family are TGase enzymatic targets (11Broome A.-M. Ryan D. Eckert R.L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2003; 51: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 29Ruse M. Lambert A. Robinson N. Ryan D. Shon K.-J. Eckert R.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3167-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), leading to a mechanism for regulating the S100 protein functions in the epidermis. Based on sequence homology and genomic localization, we propose that Scarf is a potential mouse homolog of hClsp. However, certain relevant distinctions between Scarf and hClsp have been determined: (a) hClsp was reported as a late granular differentiation marker expressed only in the very late stages of human keratinocyte differentiation and detected in lung tissue (16Mehul B. Bernard D. Simonetti L. Bernard M.A. Schmidt R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12841-12847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 17Mehul B. Bernard D. Schmidt R. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2001; 116: 905-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Scarf is expressed early in the differentiation process throughout the spinous and granular layers in the stratified epidermis and is also detected in thyroid and skeletal muscle, and (b) Scarf has a slightly extended central helix when compared with hClsp (16Mehul B. Bernard D. Simonetti L. Bernard M.A. Schmidt R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12841-12847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), making it more similar to CaM. For CaM, the central helix serves a fundamental role, allowing the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains to swing around and permitting interactions with specific target proteins (6Nelson M.R. Chazin W.J. Calmodulin and Signal Transduction. Academic Press, London1998: 17-59Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 12Crivici A. Ikura M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). The focus of our future studies will be to establish whether the slightly extended central helix in Scarf allows for the binding to targets other than the factors that interact with hClsp and to determine the role of these interactions in the control of the Ca2+-dependent epidermal differentiation. In this study we have also identified a gene with high homology to Scarf, which we termed Scarf2, that localizes ∼15 kb downstream on mouse chromosome 13. Sequence analysis of the genomic regions 5′ and 3′ to each gene showed that the homology extended to the putative proximal promoter and 3′-regions. We hypothesize that the bigenic cluster arose by recent duplication in the mouse, because we were unable to localize by genomic sequence scanning a counterpart to Scarf2 in the human genome. We detected a transcript for Scarf2 in mouse keratinocytes by RT-PCR but not in Northern blots with samples of total RNA from basal and suprabasal cells isolated from neonatal skins or in commercial blots (data not shown), suggesting that Scarf2 is expressed at lower levels than Scarf. Analysis of the Scarf2 putative ORF indicated that it encodes a Ca2+-binding protein, and based on a comparison with the canonical consensus sequence for the EF-hand motif and the critical role of the residues at positions 1 and 12, we hypothesize that the Scarf2 EF-1 and -4 motifs will be inactive or present altered Ca2+ binding. How these differences characterize Scarf2 function remains to be determined, as does the role of the highly homologous Scarf and Scarf2 and their interaction with target proteins in the transduction of the Ca2+-dependent regulatory signals during the epidermal differentiation process. We thank Dr. I. Karavanova for assistance with the in situ hybridization, Dr. E. Strehler for providing recombinant hClp protein, and Rick Dreyfuss and Shauna Everett for photographic assistance. We appreciate comments from and helpful discussions with Drs. A. Kalinin, S. Lim, and G. T. Park."
https://openalex.org/W2056088410,"The type I copper center of amicyanin was replaced with a binuclear CuA center. To create this model CuA protein, a portion of the amino acid sequence that contains three of the ligands to the native type I copper center of Paracoccus denitrificans amicyanin was replaced with the corresponding portion of sequence that provides five ligands for the CuA center of cytochrome c oxidase from P. denitrificans. UV-visible and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy confirm that the engineered protein as isolated possesses the mixed-valence Cu1.5Cu1.5 (purple) CuA center. Comparison of the spectroscopic properties of this CuA amicyanin with those of the CuA centers of other natural and engineered CuA proteins suggests that the spectroscopic features may be dictated more by the protein host than the sequence of the CuA loop. Novel reactions for a simple CuA model protein are also described. In contrast to other natural and engineered CuA proteins, the fully reduced CuA amicyanin may be reoxidized by molecular oxygen to the mixed-valence state. It is also shown that CuA amicyanin can serve as an electron donor and an electron acceptor for other redox proteins. The mixed-valence form accepts electrons from cytochromes c-551i and c-550 from P. denitrificans. The fully reduced form donates electrons to native and P94F amicyanin. The function as either an electron donor or acceptor is consistent with the measured redox potential of CuA amicyanin of +273 mV. These data indicate that this CuA amicyanin will be a particularly useful model protein for structure-function studies of reactivity and the electron transfer properties of the CuA redox center."

We now examine a more limited amino-terminal region of α3(IV) non-collagenous domain (NC1) and the impact of single amino acid (AA) mutations of this region on glomerulonephritis induction. Rats were immunized with collagenase-solubilized glomerular basement membrane (csGBM), D3, an α1(IV)NC1 chimeric protein with 69 AA of α3(IV)NC1 (binds Goodpasture sera), D4, the D3 construct shortened by 4 AA (non-binding), P9, P10, single AA mutants (non-binding), and S2, α1(IV)NC1 with 9 AA of α3(IV)NC1 (binding). All rats immunized with csGBM and S2 and 50% of D3 rats developed glomerulonephritis. csGBM rats had intense GBM-bound IgG deposits, but S2 and D3 rats had minimal deposits.

Discrete segments of α3(IV)NC1 within the α1(IV)NC1 backbone can induce glomerulonephritis. Single AA mutations within that epitope render the antigen unresponsive to Goodpasture sera and incapable of inducing glomerulonephritis. These studies support the concordance of glomerulonephritis inductivity and Goodpasture serum binding. Further, they define a critical limited AA sequence within α3(IV)NC1 of nine or fewer AA, which confers nephritogenicity to the nonnephritogenic α1(IV)NC1 without in vivo antibody binding.

Autoimmunization to α3(IV)NC1 in man is associated with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with deposition of IgG along the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and tubular basement membrane (7Bolton W.K. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 1753-1766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In some patients with intrinsic pulmonary damage, hemoptysis also occurs (7Bolton W.K. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 1753-1766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The disease is mediated by autoantibodies to type IV collagen, as shown by the transfer of disease with antibody (8Sado Y. Naito I. Okigaki T. J.

By using chimeric proteins and recombinant constructs of α3(IV)NC1 domain, we have previously shown that the major nephritogenic epitope for induction of experimental autoimmune glomerulonephritis in rats is also localized to the amino-terminal third of the α3(IV)NC1 domain (17Chen L. Hellmark T. Wieslander J. Bolton W.K. Kidney Int. 2003; 64: 1-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Point mutations of various AA in this region of α3(IV)NC1 are capable of abolishing Goodpasture syndrome antibody binding (18Hellmark T. Burkhardt H. Wieslander J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25862-25868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Whether these same epitopes are also responsible for the induction of disease cannot be studied directly in man. We have thus utilized our model of glomerulonephritis to address this question. This model, induced by immunization with native or recombinant GBM antigens, results in severe proliferative glomerulonephritis in rats with crescents, hematuria, proteinuria, pulmonary hemorrhage, and decreased kidney function with progression to chronic kidney failure resulting in death (19Bolton W.K. May W.J. Sturgill B.C. Kidney Int. 1993; 44: 294-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the present studies, we have extended our investigations of the critical role of the amino-terminal third of the NC1 domain in the induction of glomerulonephritis. We show that Goodpasture serum binding constructs also induce glomerulonephritis and a T-cell response, whereas point mutations resulting in abrogation of Goodpasture antibody binding also abrogate the ability of the constructs to induce glomerulonephritis and elicit T-cell proliferation. Finally, the close approximation of these epitopes within a narrow region in the absence of in vivo bound antibody suggests that this area may contain an epitope responsible for T-cell-induced glomerulonephritis. Antibodies—Patients with Goodpasture syndrome were used as a source of human autoantibodies. Murine monoclonal antibodies with specificity to the α3(IV)NC1 domain (mAb17), a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a discontinuous conformational epitope on α3(IV)NC1 consisting of AA 17–31 and 127–141 (20Johansson C. Butkowski R.J. Wieslander J. Connect. Tissue Res. 1991; 25: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and against 6xHis epitope (anti-His.G, Qiagen) were used in these experiments. Anti-36 mer antibody was obtained from rats immunized against the terminal 36 AA of α3(IV)NC1 (21Bolton W.K. Luo A.M. Fox P. May W.J. Fox J. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 327-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It recognizes both α1 and α3(IV)NC1 domains. Rat sera were obtained from animals immunized with recombinant proteins and collagenase-solubilized (cs) GBM. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies, fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG and fibrinogen, and anti-human IgG were purchased from ICN/Cappel. Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE was performed in 12.5% gels under non-reducing conditions. 1 mg/ml csGBM and 0.05 mg/ml purified recombinant proteins were dissolved in Laemmli buffer, and 20 μl were loaded in each lane (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting studies, the proteins separated on SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), blocked with 5% dry milk in 0.1% phosphate buffered saline Tween 20 (PBS-T), and washed with PBS-T. The membranes were incubated for 2 h with primary antibodies diluted in PBS-T. After this, the membranes were washed thoroughly with PBS-T, followed by 1-h incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, multiple washings with PBS-T, and identification of proteins by chemiluminescence (Pierce). Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—ELISA assays for native and recombinant proteins were performed as described previously in detail (18Hellmark T. Burkhardt H. Wieslander J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25862-25868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 19Bolton W.K. May W.J. Sturgill B.C.

Preparation of Bovine csGBM—csGBM immunizing antigen was isolated from homogenized cortical tissue by differential sieving, sonication to obtain disrupted GBM, and consequent digestion with collagenase to form csGBM, as described previously (19Bolton W.K. May W.J. Sturgill B.C. Kidney Int. 1993; 44: 294-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 23Bolton W.K. Tucker F.L. Sturgill B.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 1263-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Recombinant Human α3(IV)NC1 and Chimeric α3/α1(IV)NC1—Chimeric proteins (Fig. 1) were constructed as described previously by substituting various lengths of α3(IV)NC1 chain with the α1(IV)NC1 chain, which is non-nephritogenic (Fig. 1A) (1Hellmark T. Segelmark M. Unger C. Burkhardt H. Saus J. Wieslander J. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 936-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 18Hellmark T. Burkhardt H. Wieslander J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25862-25868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These substitutions consisted variably of different lengths of α3, with the predominant α1 designated D3 and D4, and single AA mutations from α3 to α1, P9 and P10 (Fig. 1B). S2 consists of the α1(IV)NC1 domain with nine AA from α3(IV)NC1 substituted into the backbone of α1(IV)NC1. csGBM, D3, and S2 all bind Goodpasture sera. D4, P9, and P10 are non-binding with Goodpasture sera (18Hellmark T. Burkhardt H. Wieslander J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25862-25868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Replacement mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using an overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (18Hellmark T. Burkhardt H. Wieslander J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25862-25868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The constructs were expressed in HEK293 cells. The secreted proteins contained a BM40 signal peptide followed by a 6-His tag, a 30-AA length of type X collagen, and the NC1 domain from type IV collagen. Constructs were tested for protein translation with the correct molecular weight using an in vitro system (Promega, Madison, WI) with [35S]cysteine and T7 RNA polymerase. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (DMEM/F-12) with 5% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) in the presence of selection reagent G-418 (Invitrogen). Culture medium was collected and purified by resin column (Invitrogen). α3–732 is a full-length α3(IV)NC1 domain without the collagen X leader protein (25Bolton W.K. Chen L. Fox J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 543AGoogle Scholar). It was likewise expressed, and recombinant protein was produced in HEK293 cells. The secreted protein was fused with a myc epitope and a 6x-His tag at the carboxyl terminus (25Bolton W.K. Chen L. Fox J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 543AGoogle Scholar). The cells were cultivated, harvested, and purified as described above, except that zeocin (Invitrogen) was used as the selection reagent. α3–732 induces glomerulonephritis in rats (25Bolton W.K. Chen L. Fox J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 543AGoogle Scholar). α3–732 purified by high-pressure liquid chromatography was used in the ELISA and immunoblot experiments in this study. Characterization of the proteins demonstrated that mAb17 was blot positive with protein containing AA 17–31 and 127–141, which are required for its binding (5Netzer K.O. Leinonen A. Boutaud A.A.

All constructs blotted positive with anti-36 mer, at the expected molecular size (Fig. 2). Previous studies demonstrated binding of Goodpasture sera to S2 and D3, but not to D4, P9, or P10 (18Hellmark T. Burkhardt H. Wieslander J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25862-25868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Experimental Animals and Immunization—Hypersusceptible normal male Wistar-Kyoto rats, weighing 200 g, were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). The animals were kept in standard conditions in the Department of Comparative Medicine for acclimatization prior to initiation of the experimental studies. The immunizing antigens were suspended in 0.1 m acetic acid, emulsified with an equal amount of complete Freund's adjuvant (H37Ra, Sigma), and given as a single subcutaneous injection in the left hind footpad. Each animal received 100 μg of protein. There were six to seven rats in each experimental group. Serum Biochemistries, Urine Analysis, and Total Urinary Protein— Animals were placed in metabolic cages and 24-h urine samples were collected weekly after immunization for a total of 7 weeks. Urinary protein was determined by using 3% sulfosalicylic acid with bovine serum albumin as a standard (19Bolton W.K. May W.J. Sturgill B.C. Kidney Int. 1993; 44: 294-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The upper limits of normal per 24 h are 10 mg. Urine was also examined for hematuria (0–3+) using reagent strips (Multistix 10 SG, Bayer Corp.). Serum creatinine and urea nitrogen were measured in blood obtained from the tail vein from each rat every 2 weeks after immunization using diagnostic kits from Sigma for creatinine (Procedure No. 555) and urea nitrogen (Procedure No. 640). Immunofluorescence Studies and Histological Examination—Kidney tissue obtained at death or at time of euthanasia at 8 weeks after immunization was used for histologic studies. Tissue was snap-frozen in isopentane (2-methylbutane, Fisher) on dry ice and stained for rat IgG and fibrinogen as described previously (26Luo A.-M. Fox J. Chen L. Bolton W.K. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 2002; 139: 303-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The intensity of deposits was semiquantitatively graded in a masked fashion from 0 to 4+ (19Bolton W.K. May W.J. Sturgill B.C. Kidney Int. 1993; 44: 294-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 23Bolton W.K. Tucker F.L. Sturgill B.C. J. Clin.

For light microscopy studies, kidney tissue was fixed in 10% buffered formalin, dehydrated in alcohol, and embedded in paraffin. Hematoxylin-eosin stained sections were examined in a masked fashion using a 4-point scale (26Luo A.-M. Fox J. Chen L. Bolton W.K. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 2002; 139: 303-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Lymphocyte-Proliferation Assay—Lymphocytes isolated from spleens of rats with glomerulonephritis were stimulated in vitro with different antigens and cultured in 96-well flat-bottom plates as described previously (21Bolton W.K. Luo A.M. Fox P. May W.J. Fox J. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 327-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 26Luo A.-M. Fox J. Chen L. Bolton W.K. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 2002; 139: 303-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). 3 days later, the cells were pulsed with tritiated thymidine, harvested, and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. All assays were performed in triplicate. Data are expressed as the stimulation index, the ratio of stimulated to medium counts per minute. We considered stimulation indices of 2.0 or greater as significant (26Luo A.-M. Fox J. Chen L. Bolton W.K. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 2002; 139: 303-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Statistical Analyses—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical differences between groups were evaluated by the Student's t test and analysis of variance (23Bolton W.K. Tucker F.L. Sturgill B.C. J. Clin.

Induction of Glomerulonephritis by csGBM and Goodpasture Serum Binding Chimeric Protein Constructs—Animals immunized with csGBM and S2 construct all developed hematuria, and half of the animals immunized with D3 developed hematuria. Animals immunized with csGBM and S2 developed proteinuria in a typical fashion, with onset by 3 weeks (Fig. 3). Approximately half of the animals immunized with D3 also developed proteinuria, albeit of lesser degree than S2- and csGBM-immunized animals. Elevations of blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were observed in csGBM- and S2-immunized animals (Fig. 4, A and B) but not in D3-immunized rats.Fig. 4Level of serum urea nitrogen (A) and creatinine (B) in rats immunized with recombinant proteins and csGBM, week 8.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) By light microscopy, all animals immunized with csGBM and S2 had typical florid glomerulonephritis (Fig. 5), which was characterized by intense tubulointerstitial infiltration with mononuclear cells, tuftal proliferation with fibrosis, scarring, cellular crescents with giant cells, and tubular atrophy. Half of the D3-immunized animals developed overt glomerulonephritis as well, with the intensity of histologic findings being somewhat less than that observed with S2 and csGBM. By immunofluorescence (Fig. 6), intense linear deposits of IgG typical of glomerulonephritis were observed on the basement membrane in csGBM-immunized animals. In contrast to csGBM recipient rats, animals immunized with S2 and D3 had minimal deposits of IgG along the basement membrane despite glomerulonephritis. Five of seven S2 rats were completely negative, whereas two had slight deposits. One D3-immunized rat had 1–2+ GBM deposits of IgG, two had trace deposits, and three were negative. Typical fibrinogen deposits were present in csGBM-, D3-, and S2-immunized animals. The fibrinogen deposits were present in all csGBM and S2 rats and were more intense in csGBM- and S2-immunized animals than D3 rats. Five of six D3-immunized animals had fibrinogen deposits, and three of these rats had glomerulonephritis by light microscopy. Influence of Mutations Abolishing Goodpasture Serum Binding on Glomerulonephritis Induction—Rats immunized with D4, P9, and P10 did not show any evidence of hematuria at any time. No proteinuria or biochemical abnormalities were observed in these animals, there were no histologic abnormalities, and there was no deposition of antibody or fibrinogen in glomeruli. No deposits, biochemical abnormalities, or histologic abnormalities were observed in negative control Freund's adjuvant-immunized rats. Lymphocyte Proliferation—Cells from rats with glomerulonephritis responded strongly to antigens with Goodpasture serum binding capacity (Table I). On the other hand, constructs that failed to bind Goodpasture sera in vitro (18Hellmark T. Burkhardt H. Wieslander J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25862-25868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) also failed to elicit cellular proliferation.Table IIn vivo and in vitro immunoreactant correlationsAntigenIn vivo fluorescenceaFluorescence intensity graded on a 0-4+ (++++) scale.Indirect fluorescence for IgG on kidney sectionsELISA Goodpasture serum binding (1Hellmark T.

Open table in a new tab ELISA—All animals immunized with chimeric proteins containing collagen X leader protein produced a vigorous antibody response in ELISA against the immunogen, collagen X, α3–732, and other chimeric constructs (Fig. 7). They also demonstrated a robust response to NC1 domains from bovine and human GBM and lesser responses to rat NC1 and csGBM. At a common dilution of 1:1000 versus bovine NC1, the week-six sera optical densities were, respectively, 0.69 for rats immunized with csGBM, 0.49 for P9, 0.25 for P10, 0.46 for D3, 0.41 for S2, and 0.42 for D4. At a dilution of 1:4000, all sera had optical densities comparable with normal serum. Indirect Immunofluorescence—By indirect fluorescence of kidney sections, Table I, staining of human GBM was present with sera from csGBM-immunized rats. In addition, P9- and P10-immunized animals without glomerulonephritis also had circulating antibody to human glomeruli in tissue sections. S2- and D3-immunized rat sera had much less activity against GBM sections in vitro. There was no circulating antibody activity in D4- and Freund's adjuvant-immunized rats by indirect immunofluorescence on human kidney sections, despite antibody by ELISA. The fluorescence pattern was both GBM and mesangial for sera from D3 and P9. None of the sera from any of the rats bound to rat GBM in sections of rat kidney by indirect fluorescence. We have shown that the amino-terminal domain of α3(IV)NC1 contains the immunodominant region for binding antibodies from patients with Goodpasture syndrome (1Hellmark T. Segelmark M. Unger C. Burkhardt H. Saus J. Wieslander J. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 936-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This does not prove that the epitope is also capable of inducing the disease, nor are these studies possible in man. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the same antibody-binding epitope was responsible for induction of the disease in our model. Indeed, constructs demonstrating in vitro antibody binding also induced glomerulonephritis. Somewhat surprising to us was the ability of single-point mutations in P9 and P10 constructs to totally abrogate the ability of the chimeric proteins to induce glomerulonephritis. Although this was consistent with in vitro Goodpasture antibody binding (18Hellmark T. Burkhardt H. Wieslander J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25862-25868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we had anticipated that redundancy in the immune system would nonetheless allow these constructs to induce glomerulonephritis. Animals immunized with the P9 and P10 constructs did develop antibody to human GBM in vitro, whereas D4-immunized animals developed no antibody to human GBM in tissue sections, but they did by ELISA. This illustrates the key importance of the four AA (TAIP) contained in the D3 construct for both disease induction and Goodpasture antibody binding. To examine the critical AA further, S2 was utilized to immunize rats. Previous studies with chimeric protein S1 containing five of the critical AA on the α1(IV)NC1 backbone demonstrated non-binding of Goodpasture antibodies (18Hellmark T. Burkhardt H. Wieslander J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25862-25868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Four additional AA substitutions (for a total of nine AA from α3(IV)NC1) was sufficient to restore full antibody binding activity to the S2 construct (18Hellmark T. Burkhardt H. Wieslander J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25862-25868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Similarly, these same nine critical AA on the α1 NC1 backbone restored nephritogenicity to the chimeric protein construct, such that disease severity in S2-immunized animals was the same as animals immunized with csGBM. However, there was one significant difference. Rats immunized with csGBM had deposits of rat IgG along the GBM in vivo and circulating antibody which fixed avidly to human GBM in vitro. S2-immunized rats had minimal deposits of IgG in vivo, and serum from these animals reacted less intensely by indirect fluorescence with human GBM. The D3 construct containing the same nine critical AA as S2 and native csGBM induced glomerulonephritis as well, with minimal deposits of IgG on the GBM, like S2, but lesser amounts of fibrinogen and less severe glomerulonephritis.
