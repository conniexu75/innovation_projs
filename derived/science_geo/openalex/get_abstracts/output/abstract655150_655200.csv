https://openalex.org/W3037544553,"To investigate the immune response and mechanisms associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on nasopharyngeal and bronchial samples from 19 clinically well-characterized patients with moderate or critical disease and from five healthy controls. We identified airway epithelial cell types and states vulnerable to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In patients with COVID-19, epithelial cells showed an average three-fold increase in expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2, which correlated with interferon signals by immune cells. Compared to moderate cases, critical cases exhibited stronger interactions between epithelial and immune cells, as indicated by ligand–receptor expression profiles, and activated immune cells, including inflammatory macrophages expressing CCL2, CCL3, CCL20, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL10, IL8, IL1B and TNF. The transcriptional differences in critical cases compared to moderate cases likely contribute to clinical observations of heightened inflammatory tissue damage, lung injury and respiratory failure. Our data suggest that pharmacologic inhibition of the CCR1 and/or CCR5 pathways might suppress immune hyperactivation in critical COVID-19. Single-cell analysis of COVID-19 patient samples identifies activated immune pathways that correlate with severe disease."

Machine learning (ML) methods can play vital roles in identifying COVID-19 patients by visually analyzing their chest x-ray images. In this paper, a new ML-method proposed to classify the chest x-ray images into two classes, COVID-19 patient or non-COVID-19 person. The features extracted from the chest x-ray images using new Fractional Multichannel Exponent Moments (FrMEMs). A parallel multi-core computational framework utilized to accelerate the computational process. Then, a modified Manta-Ray Foraging Optimization based on differential evolution used to select the most significant features. The proposed method evaluated using two COVID-19 x-ray datasets. The proposed method achieved accuracy rates of 96.09% and 98.09% for the first and second datasets, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W3033609484,"Background Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) is caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, transmissible both person-to-person and from contaminated surfaces. Early COVID-19 detection among healthcare workers (HCWs) is crucial for protecting patients and the healthcare workforce. Because of limited testing capacity, symptom-based screening may prioritize testing and increase diagnostic accuracy. Methods and findings We performed a retrospective study of HCWs undergoing both COVID-19 telephonic symptom screening and nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 assays during the period, March 9—April 15, 2020. HCWs with negative assays but progressive symptoms were re-tested for SARS-CoV-2. Among 592 HCWs tested, 83 (14%) had an initial positive SARS-CoV-2 assay. Fifty-nine of 61 HCWs (97%) who were asymptomatic or reported only sore throat/nasal congestion had negative SARS-CoV-2 assays (P = 0.006). HCWs reporting three or more symptoms had an increased multivariate-adjusted odds of having positive assays, 1.95 (95% CI: 1.10–3.64), which increased to 2.61 (95% CI: 1.50–4.45) for six or more symptoms. The multivariate-adjusted odds of a positive assay were also increased for HCWs reporting fever and a measured temperature ≥ 37.5°C (3.49 (95% CI: 1.95–6.21)), and those with myalgias (1.83 (95% CI: 1.04–3.23)). Anosmia/ageusia (i.e. loss of smell/loss of taste) was reported less frequently (16%) than other symptoms by HCWs with positive assays, but was associated with more than a seven-fold multivariate-adjusted odds of a positive test: OR = 7.21 (95% CI: 2.95–17.67). Of 509 HCWs with initial negative SARS-CoV-2 assays, nine had symptom progression and positive re-tests, yielding an estimated negative predictive value of 98.2% (95% CI: 96.8–99.0%) for the exclusion of clinically relevant COVID-19. Conclusions Symptom and temperature reports are useful screening tools for predicting SARS-CoV-2 assay results in HCWs. Anosmia/ageusia, fever, and myalgia were the strongest independent predictors of positive assays. The absence of symptoms or symptoms limited to nasal congestion/sore throat were associated with negative assays."

To define a high-resolution temporal profile of metabolites during healthy pregnancy, we analyzed the untargeted metabolome of 784 weekly blood samples from 30 pregnant women. Broad changes and a highly choreographed profile were revealed: 4,995 metabolic features (of 9,651 total), 460 annotated compounds (of 687 total), and 34 human metabolic pathways (of 48 total) were significantly changed during pregnancy. Using linear models, we built a metabolic clock with five metabolites that time gestational age in high accordance with ultrasound (R = 0.92). Furthermore, two to three metabolites can identify when labor occurs (time to delivery within two, four, and eight weeks, AUROC ≥ 0.85).

Pregnancy is one of the most critical periods for mother and child (Alkema et al., 2016Alkema L. Chou D. Hogan D. Zhang S. Moller A.B. Gemmill A. Fat D.M. Boerma T. Temmerman M. Mathers C. Say L.

It involves a tremendous flow of physiological changes and metabolic adaptations week by week, and even small deviations from the norm might have detrimental consequences at different pregnancy stages. For example, approximately 20% of all pregnancies end in miscarriage (< 20 weeks), and around 10% end in preterm birth (< 37 weeks) (Blencowe et al., 2013Blencowe H. Cousens S. Chou D. Oestergaard M.

The latter is the leading cause of global neonatal morbidity and mortality (Blencowe et al., 2013Blencowe H. Cousens S. Chou D. Oestergaard M. Say L. Moller A.B. Kinney M. Lawn J.

With a better understanding of how pregnancy is regulated, even small improvements in obstetric health care can enhance the well-being of many women and children. An accurate estimation of the timing of pregnancy and birth is important for many clinical decisions in obstetrics, including determination of preterm birth and related treatment regimens (Committee on Obstetric Practicethe American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicineand the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, 2017Committee on Obstetric Practice, the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineCommittee Opinion No 700: Methods for Estimating the Due Date.Obstet. Gynecol. 2017; 129: e150-e154Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The current clinical method of determining the gestational age and due date is based on information about the last menstruation date, which can be imprecise, or ultrasound imaging, which depends on accessibility at early pregnancy (Committee on Obstetric Practicethe American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicineand the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, 2017Committee on Obstetric Practice, the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineCommittee Opinion No 700: Methods for Estimating the Due Date.Obstet. Gynecol. 2017; 129: e150-e154Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Missing the time window is common even in developed countries: in the United States, approximately 900,000 pregnancies annually do not have a prenatal visit before the second or third trimester (Martin et al., 2018Martin J.A. Hamilton B.E. Osterman M.J.K. Driscoll A.K. Drake P. Births: Final Data for 2017.Natl. Vital Stat. Rep. 2018; 67: 1-50PubMed Google Scholar). The maternal circulatory system connects with the fetal circulatory system through the placenta, carrying bioactive molecules and biomarkers such as steroid hormones, micronutrients, and circulating nucleic acids, whose concentrations alter as gestation progresses (King, 2000King J.C.

Recent work on cell-free RNA suggests that markers in maternal blood can be used to estimate gestational age, but sequencing can be expensive and time-consuming, and the accuracy, at present, is not ideal (Ngo et al., 2018Ngo T.T.M.

Therefore, a more accurate and cost-effective method for estimating gestational age and delivery time, possibly using blood metabolites, is needed. In addition, current clinical tests often only focus on a few markers, whereas research covering more molecules often examines the profiles at one or a few time points during pregnancy (Bahado-Singh et al., 2012Bahado-Singh R.O.

Thus, a high-resolution landscape of pregnancy-related metabolites during healthy pregnancy and the postpartum period is still poorly understood. Here, we use untargeted metabolomics (Kaddurah-Daouk et al., 2008Kaddurah-Daouk R. Kristal B.S. Weinshilboum R.M. Metabolomics: a global biochemical approach to drug response and disease.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2008; 48: 653-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) to systematically profile blood metabolites throughout pregnancy with weekly sampling of maternal blood. The study identified a large number of pregnancy-related metabolites and metabolic pathways offering a comprehensive view of the metabolite changes during healthy pregnancy and the postpartum period. Leveraging the high-resolution datasets, we built a metabolic clock that not only predicts gestational age in high accordance with the first-trimester ultrasound, the clinical gold standard, but also recovers personal pregnancy variations undetected by ultrasound but capable of affecting delivery time. To capture the highly dynamic pregnancy process at high resolution, we established a multi-year single-center Danish normal pregnancy cohort and a design of high-density blood sampling. Consenting female participants submitted weekly blood draws beginning in week 5 of pregnancy and ending in the postpartum period. A total of 30 women with weekly blood samples were assigned to a discovery (N = 21) and a validation (test set 1, N = 9) cohort (Table 1; Figures 1A and S1A). The samples were analyzed in two separate years. In addition, another separate set of women (N = 8) was included as the secondary validation cohort. These samples were analyzed independently three years apart from the discovery cohort (test set 2) (Table 1).Table 1Demographics and Birth Characteristics of the Discovery and Validation CohortsDiscoveryTest Set 1Test Set 2N = 21N = 9N = 8DemographicsMaternal age at birth, years29.8 ± 3.129.7 ± 3.331.4 ± 1.0Previous births, No. (%)013 (61.9)6 (66.7)4 (50.0)18 (38.1)2 (22.2)3 (37.5)≥ 20 (0)1 (11.1)1 (12.5)Pre-pregnancy BMI, kg/m222.1 ± 2.921.2 ± 3.421.1 ± 1.6Smoking during pregnancy, No. (%)Yes0 (0)0 (0)1 (12.5)No18 (85.7)9 (100)6 (75.0)Missing3 (14.3)0 (0)1 (12.5)Alcohol during pregnancy, No. (%)Yes5 (23.8)1 (11.1)1 (12.5)Average number of units per week0.801.00.25No13 (61.9)8 (88.9)6 (75.0)Missing3 (14.3)0 (0)1 (12.5)Birth characteristicsGestational age, days281 ± 8.4280.7 ± 8.3279.3 ± 9.5Mode of delivery, No. (%)Spontaneous vaginal birth10 (47.6)5 (55.6)4 (50.0)Induced vaginal birth7 (33.3)1 (11.1)3 (37.5)C-section before onset of labor1 (4.8)3 (33.3)1 (12.5)C-section during labor3 (14.3)0 (0)0 (0)Birth weight, grams3,638 ± 5003,803 ± 6623,362 ± 493Birth length, centimeters52.4 ± 253.3 ± 251 ± 2.3Gender of child, No. (%)Male9 (42.9)5 (55.6)5 (62.5)Female12 (57.1)4 (44.4)3 (37.5)Values are means (SDs) or numbers (percentages).

We randomized the 784 samples from the first 30 subjects within each cohort (Discovery and test set 1), processed them by using a standardized protocol (Contrepois et al., 2015Contrepois K. Jiang L. Snyder M. Optimized Analytical Procedures for the Untargeted Metabolomic Profiling of Human Urine and Plasma by Combining Hydrophilic Interaction (HILIC) and Reverse-Phase Liquid Chromatography (RPLC)-Mass Spectrometry.Mol.

After quality control, data filtering, and normalization (see STAR Methods) (N = 30), we identified 9,651 metabolic features across the different samples. Of these, 4,995 features (51.7%) were altered during pregnancy and/or the postpartum period (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05), suggesting extensive metabolic changes occur during pregnancy. We examined the data globally with principal component analysis (PCA), in which the samples were distributed on the basis of the first two principal components according to their gestational stages (Figure 1B; Scree plot in Figure S1B and the partial least-squares discriminant analysis [PLS-DA] results in Figure S1C), regardless of individual variation and batches (Figures S1D and S1E). Interestingly, we found that metabolites with uni-directional behaviors dominated the features, and over half of them increased across pregnancy until reaching their peaks immediately before labor (Figures S1F and S1G). To understand the potential function of pregnancy-related metabolites, we first annotated metabolic features by using an in-house library and a combined public spectral database (see details in STAR Methods). A total of 952 metabolic features were mapped to 687 compounds, which include plasma metabolites with important functions in humans. We then applied significance analysis for microarrays (SAM) to examine the correlation between the abundance of each compound and the reported gestational age of a woman at blood sampling. Among the 687 annotated compounds, 460 compounds were significantly associated with pregnancy (67.0%; FDR < 0.05, SAM). In addition, 264 compounds were identified with a metabolomics standards initiative (MSI) level 1 or 2 identification (Viant et al., 2017Viant M.R. Kurland I.J. Jones M.R. Dunn W.B. How close are we to complete annotation of metabolomes?.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2017; 36: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), among which 176 compounds (66.7%) were significantly associated with pregnancy, as determined by linear regression with gestational age (FDR < 0.05, SAM). Our dense sampling revealed detailed temporal patterns of molecular changes. Among the top 68 metabolites (of the 176) that changed over 50% during whole pregnancy, those that increased (N = 30) included steroid hormones estriol-16-glucuronide, estrone 3-sulfate, and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC). All three increased more rapidly than the well-known steroids progesterone and 17α-hydoxyprogesterone (FDR < 0.05, SAM) (Figures 1C and 1D). By contrast, the top metabolites that decreased during pregnancy (N = 38) were mostly lipids or lipid-like molecules, such as monoacylglycerides (MGs), lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC or lysoPC), and oleoylcarnitine (Figures 1C and 1E). Hierarchical clustering of the weekly samples on the basis of the top 68 altered metabolites revealed a week-order mostly consistent with the actual progression of gestational age (Table S1; Figures 1D and 1E). Intriguingly, most of these metabolite changes rapidly returned to baseline after childbirth (postpartum) (Figures 1B and 1D and 1E). Together, these results suggest a dramatic and programmed change of human blood metabolites at a system level during pregnancy. To detect the functional groups of metabolites that change during pregnancy, we performed correlation analysis on the temporal intensity profiles of the top 68 pregnancy-related compounds mentioned above. In Figure S2, metabolites that were significantly increased or decreased tended to cluster together. Using existing structural and biological information, we first categorized the top changing compounds in pregnancy into seven groups. Interestingly, compounds of the same groups tended to cluster together in the correlation matrix. On the basis of the correlation relationship, we constructed a regularized partial correlation network using all pregnancy-related compounds to explore the potential regulatory relationships (Figures 2A and S2B). The topology of the network indicates that different metabolite groups occupied different positions; dense interactions occurred between both inter- and intra- metabolite groups with the densest interactions between central steroid hormones (Figure 2A). These findings highlight that even though the amount of each compound dynamically changes during pregnancy, a highly coordinated metabolite regulatory network underlies the pregnancy process.Figure 2Functional Metabolite Groups Altered during PregnancyShow full caption(A) Regularized partial correlation network of top altered compounds in pregnancy.

See also Figure S2. We next examined the main clusters that were present in the correlation analysis. Three main clusters emerged from the hierarchical clustering of metabolites (Figure S2A), with a steroid cluster (e.g., antrostane-3,17-diol, estriol-16-glucuronide, progesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, and THDOC) sitting between the large clusters of lipids and non-lipid molecules. Compared with the other steroids in this cluster that slowly but steadily increased throughout pregnancy, estriol-16-glucuronide exhibited a rapid increase before week 24, (Figures 1D and 2B). Nearly all upregulated metabolites positively correlated with this cluster of steroids, whereas all downregulated metabolites negatively correlated with this cluster (Figure S2A). This result suggests that different steroid hormones might regulate global metabolome dynamics during pregnancy. Within the lipid cluster, intra-correlation was relatively high. The largest cluster was composed of LysoPCs (Figures 2A and S2A), a class of phospholipids. LysoPCs gradually decreased during pregnancy and increased after childbirth in a pattern that highly correlates with the steroid dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) (Figure 2C). LysoPCs are bioactive pro-inflammatory lipids that have been linked with organismal oxidative stress and inflammation (Sevastou et al., 2013Sevastou I. Kaffe E. Mouratis M.A. Aidinis V. Lysoglycerophospholipids in chronic inflammatory disorders: the PLA(2)/LPC and ATX/LPA axes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1831: 42-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The second-largest cluster of lipids included several free fatty acids that were highly correlated within the cluster (Figures 2A and S2A). Long-chain fatty acids showed intricate dynamics in their amounts revealed by the dense sampling. Hexadecadienoylcarnitine and tetracosahexaenoic acid (THA) decreased at the beginning of pregnancy, followed by waves of increased amounts similar to other fatty acids in the late second and third trimesters (Figure 2D). After childbirth, the amounts of most long-chain fatty acids decreased, except for hexadecadienoylcarnitine (Figure 2D). Within the non-lipid cluster, one sub-cluster included five highly correlated metabolites belonging to the same caffeine metabolism pathway (Figures 2A and S2A). All five metabolites were consistently elevated during pregnancy, and caffeine reached a concentration three times higher at the end of pregnancy than at the beginning (Figure 2E). This elevation might be due to a slower caffeine metabolism in pregnant women rather than an increase in coffee intake (Knutti et al., 1981Knutti R. Rothweiler H. Schlatter C. Effect of pregnancy on the pharmacokinetics of caffeine.Eur. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1981; 21: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Overall, among the 68 top-altered metabolites in pregnancy, functional metabolite groups (e.g., steroids, LysoPCs, fatty acids, and caffeine metabolites) were altered in an orchestrated manner during pregnancy, and individual compounds within each group showed inter-correlation to each other (Figure 2A). Next, we longitudinally examined the global pathway changes of all 687 annotated compounds during normal pregnancy. Among the 48 mapped Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, 34 showed significant changes (70.8%, adjusted FDR < 0.05, global test) (Goeman et al., 2004Goeman J.J. van de Geer S.A. de Kort F. van Houwelingen H.C.

To quantify the pathway activities through gestational age, we calculated the average intensity of metabolites in the pathways (Figure 3B; see STAR Methods). Among the top altered pathways (Figure 3A), steroid hormone biosynthesis showed elevated activity precisely timed to gestation, peaking before the end of pregnancy and then declining sharply shortly after delivery (Figure 3B). Along with the essential roles of steroid hormones in maintaining pregnancy and later inducing parturition (Mendelson, 2009Mendelson C.R. Minirevi"

In contrast to two-photon methods, however, one-photon methods suffer from higher levels of crosstalk from neuropil, resulting in a decreased signal-to-noise ratio and artifactual correlations of neural activity. We address this problem by engineering cell-body-targeted variants of the fluorescent calcium indicators GCaMP6f and GCaMP7f. We screened fusions of GCaMP to natural, as well as artificial, peptides and identified fusions that localized GCaMP to within 50 μm of the cell body of neurons in mice and larval zebrafish. One-photon imaging of soma-targeted GCaMP in dense neural circuits reported fewer artifactual spikes from neuropil, an increased signal-to-noise ratio, and decreased artifactual correlation across neurons.

Although such algorithms are widely used in two-photon calcium imaging, one-photon calcium imaging is subject to higher neuropil contamination levels, which remains an open problem for ongoing computational research (Zhou et al., 2016Zhou P.

Methods. 2014; 11: 883-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar); however, the requirement for calcium to enter the nucleus slows the temporal precision of such imaging, compared with classical cytosolic calcium imaging. We hypothesized that if we could localize a genetically encoded calcium indicator such as GCaMP6f (Chen et al., 2013Chen T.-W. Wardill T.J. Sun Y. Pulver S.R. Renninger S.L. Baohan A. Schreiter E.R.

We screened through natural and artificial peptides and discovered two motifs that, when fused to GCaMP, enabled it to express within 50 μm of the cell body. Kinetics were similar to those mediated by conventional GCaMP. In intact brain circuits of larval zebrafish and mice, such soma-targeted GCaMPs greatly reduced the number of neuropil contamination spikes mistakenly attributed to a given neural cell body and reduced artifactual correlations between nearby neurons. We fused various peptides to GCaMP6f and GCaMP7f and assessed their ability to target GCaMP to the cell body (Tables S1A, list of the proteins, and S7, sequences of the fragments used). These included the kainate receptor subunit KA2 (Valluru et al., 2005Valluru L. Xu J. Zhu Y. Yan S. Contractor A. Swanson G.T.

In some cases, key fragments were found to cause soma targeting of a reporter: for NaV1.2 and NaV1.6, 326- and 27-amino acid segments within intracellular loops between transmembrane domains, termed NaV1.2(I–II) and NaV1.6(II–III), respectively, were sufficient for somatic localization (Garrido et al., 2001Garrido J.J.

For rSK1, the tail region (rSK1 tail) sufficed (Fletcher et al., 2003Fletcher S. Bowden S.E.H. Marrion N.V.

For AnkyrinG, it was found that the spectrin-binding domain (AnkSB motif), the tail domain (AnkTail motif), the membrane-binding domain (AnkMB motif), the COOH-terminal domain (AnkCT motif), and the serine-rich domain (AnkSR motif) were targeted to the axon and the cell body of neurons (Zhang and Bennett, 1998Zhang X.

We made more than 30 fusions between GCaMP6f and the protein fragments reported earlier (Tables S1B, fusions screened, and S7, sequences). For NaV1.2, NaV1.6, KV2.1, and rSK1, we performed fusions in which the previously characterized localization fragment was attached to the C terminus of GCaMP6f. In a recent study (Shemesh et al., 2017Shemesh O.A. Tanese D. Zampini V. Linghu C. Piatkevich K. Ronzitti E. Papagiakoumou E. Boyden E.S. Emiliani V. Temporally precise single-cell-resolution optogenetics.Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20: 1796-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we fused the channelrhodopsin CoChR (Klapoetke et al., 2014Klapoetke N.C. Murata Y. Kim S.S. Pulver S.R. Birdsey-Benson A. Cho Y.K. Morimoto T.K. Chuong A.S. Carpenter E.J. Tian Z. et al.Independent optical excitation of distinct neural populations.Nat. Methods. 2014; 11: 338-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar) to the first 150 amino acids of the KA2 receptor subunit (KA2(1–150)), thereby creating a somatic CoChR. Because both N- and C-terminal fusions of KA2(1–150) with CoChR caused somatic localization, we made similar upstream and downstream fusions of this fragment with GCaMP6f. In the present study, we also found that the first 100 amino acids of KA2 (KA2(1–100)) were sufficient to introduce somatic localization of GCaMP6f; therefore, we made additional upstream and downstream fusions of KA2(1–100) with GCaMP6f. In some cases, we inserted into the construct a superfolder GFP (sfGFP) (Pédelacq et al., 2006Pédelacq J.-D. Cabantous S. Tran T. Terwilliger T.C. Waldo G.S. Engineering and characterization of a superfolder green fluorescent protein.Nat. Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar), which contains three mutations to EGFP to enhance folding, with a mutation to abolish its fluorescence (here called nullsfGFP). For AnkyrinG fragments, we made fusions both upstream and downstream of GCaMP6f. For de novo coiled-coil proteins, we made downstream fusions only. We expressed each of these GCaMP6f fusion proteins in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons. Using wide-field fluorescence microscopy, we screened for expression level (fluorescence under baseline conditions), somatic localization, toxicity (assessed as the percentage of dead cells), and whether there were fluorescence changes (df/f0) in response to spontaneous neural activity. Five constructs did not result in obvious toxicity, exhibited somatic localization, and displayed df/f0 similar to that of GCaMP6f. These were GCaMP6f fused to the following fragments: NaV1.2(I–II) (GCaMP6f-27-NaV1.2(I–II)-ER2); nullsfGFP and KA2(1–100) (GCaMP6f-24-nullsfGFP-24-KA2(1–100)-ER2); a zero-photocurrent CoChR mutant called nullCoChR, followed by the KV2.1 motif (nullCoChR-12-GCaMP6f-KV2.1-motif); the AnkTail motif (GCaMP6f-27-AnkTail-motif-ER2) (Figure 1D); and the coiled-coil peptide set EE-RR (GCaMP6f-27-EE-RR) (Figure 1E). We next screened these somatic GCaMP6f candidates in mouse brain slices exposed to 1 mM 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, which resulted in ∼5–20 GCaMP fluorescent transients per minute, aka GCaMP spikes). We assessed df/f0, the ratio of df/f0 between the cell body and the neuropil, and the brightness. We found that GCaMP6f-24-nullsfGFP-24-KA2(1–100)-ER2 expressed in the neurites of pyramidal neurons in the cortex, in contrast to the culture data, and did not pursue this construct further. The remaining constructs had a similar df/f0 compared with GCaMP6f and a soma-to-neuropil df/f0 ratio higher than that of GCaMP6f. GCaMP6f-27-AnkTail-motif-ER2 and GCaMP6f-27-EE-RR had the highest baseline brightness (Figure 2; Table S2, statistics for Figure 2); thus, we pursued these two constructs for more detailed characterization, naming them SomaGCaMP6f1 and SomaGCaMP6f2, respectively. We co-expressed GCaMP6f, SomaGCaMP6f1, or SomaGCaMP6f2 with the red FP miRFP to serve as a cellular tracer, using cultured mouse hippocampal neurons (Figures 1C–1E). We found that fluorescence decreased at a higher rate along the neurites in SomaGCaMP6f1-expressing cells (Figures 1F and 1G) and SomaGCaMP6f2-expressing cells (Figures 1F and 1H) compared with GCaMP6f-expressing cells (Table S2, statistics for Figure 1). We also fused GCaMP7f (Dana et al., 2019Dana H. Sun Y. Mohar B. Hulse B.K. Kerlin A.M. Hasseman J.P. Tsegaye G. Tsang A. Wong A.

The baseline fluorescence levels of cells expressing GCaMP6f, SomaGCaMP6f1, SomaGCaMP6f2, and GCaMP6f-NLS (nuclear localization sequence) in culture were similar to each other (Figure 3A; Table S2, statistics for Figure 3), as were the baseline fluorescence levels of GCaMP7f and SomaGCaMP7f (Figure 3A). The fluorescent responses of each molecule to a single action potential (AP) (Figure 3B) were similar between targeted and untargeted GCaMPs (Figure 3C). SomaGCaMPs had SNRs (signal-to-noise ratios; defined as the magnitude of fluorescence change caused by a single AP divided by the standard deviation of the baseline fluorescence) similar to untargeted GCaMPs, whereas GCaMP6f-NLS had an SNR lower than that of GCaMP6f (Figure 3D). We found that SomaGCaMPs had rise (τon) and decay (τoff) times, for a single AP, similar to those of untargeted GCaMP but that, as expected from previous work, GCaMP6f-NLS had τon and τoff times significantly slower than those of GCaMP6f (Figures 3E and 3F). The resting potential, membrane capacitance, holding current, and membrane resistance of cultured hippocampal neurons did not differ for cells expressing conventional versus soma-targeted GCaMPs, nor did AP width, amplitude, or threshold (Figure S1; Table S5, statistics for Figure S1). In addition, we quantified the distribution of native proteins along axons and found no differences in the locations of endogenous proteins assessed (KV2.1, NaV1.2, and the calcium channel CaV2.1, as well as the scaffolding protein AnkG) between conventional versus soma-targeted GCaMP-expressing neurons (Figure S2; Table S6, statistics for Figure S2). Both SomaGCaMPs and conventional GCaMPs appeared to express in the cytosol, as opposed to on the membrane (Figure S3). We repeated some localization experiments of Figure 1 in neurons in mouse brain slices, focusing on GCaMP6f variants for concreteness. We co-expressed GCaMP variants with a red FP (mScarlet) in layer 2/3 neurons of the mouse cortex. We used mScarlet to manually trace cells and quantified fluorescence brightness for various GCaMP6f variants (Figure 4A). We normalized the GCaMP6f fluorescence in the green channel by the mScarlet fluorescence to control for the varying size and shape of neural processes and found that for SomaGCaMPs, this ratio decreased to a few percent of the ratio for GCaMP6f-expressing cells over the first 150 μm of neurite (Figure 4B; Table S3, statistics for Figure 4). Similar patterns held when we looked at GCaMP6f brightness without mScarlet normalization (Figure 4D). We next characterized whether soma targeting of GCaMP6f could reduce neuropil contamination in brain slices, choosing SomaGCaMP6f1 for this experiment. We found that the baseline brightness of the cell body of SomaGCaMP6f1-expressing neurons was about 5-fold lower than that of GCaMP6f-expressing neurons in live brain slices (Figures 2I and S4; Table S6, statistics for Figure S4). Slices expressing GCaMP6f versus SomaGCaMP6f1 had comparable densities (18 ± 7 versus 21 ± 5 cells per 106 μm3; mean ± standard error of the mean is reported unless otherwise indicated; n = 3 slices from 3 mice each). We increased the excitation light power in SomaGCaMP6f1 experiments to match the baseline brightness of GCaMP6f (Figure 4C) for the remaining experiments of Figure 4; in such a condition, the df/f0 and SNR of GCaMP spikes per single patch-reported spikes observed during 4-AP-evoked activity were similar between GCaMP6f- and SomaGCaMP6f1-expressing cells (Figures 4E and 4F). The df/f0 of the GCaMP transient driven by a burst (5–20 spikes) was significantly higher in SomaGCaMP6f1- versus GCaMP6f-expressing cells (Figure S5; Table S6, statistics for Figure S5). We then measured the number of fluorescent GCaMP-reported spikes that lacked an associated patch-reported spike in brain slices expressing GCaMP6f versus SomaGCaMP6f1, when slices were exposed to 0.1 mM 4-AP to cause asynchronous spiking (Figure 4G versus Figure 4H). Patch-reported spike rates were similar between GCaMP6f- and SomaGCaMP6f1-expressing cells (Figure 4I). GCaMP6f neurons exhibited a roughly 2:3 ratio of erroneous spikes to actual spikes, but in SomaGCaMP6f1 slices, the ratio was reduced to 1:6 (Figure 4J). GCaMP6f-expressing neurons exhibited 10.4 ± 2.2 GCaMP spikes per minute (Figure S5D), similar to the number of electrophysiology-derived APs (Figure 4I, 6.2 ± 1.3) plus the number of erroneous spikes (Figure 4J, 3.9 ± 1.4). SomaGCaMP6f1-expressing neurons exhibited 6.7 ± 3.0 GCaMP spikes per minute (Figure S5D), similar to the number of electrophysiology-derived APs (Figure 4I, 6.0 ± 2.4) plus the number of erroneous spikes (Figure 4J, 0.65 ± 0.3). Algorithms for neuropil contamination reduction for one-photon calcium imaging have been developed for neuroscience use. A popular algorithm is constrained non-negative matrix factorization (CNMF) (Pnevmatikakis et al., 2016Pnevmatikakis E.A. Soudry D. Gao Y. Machado T.A. Merel J. Pfau D. Reardon T. Mu Y. Lacefield C. Yang W. et al.Simultaneous Denoising, Deconvolution, and Demixing of Calcium Imaging Data.Neuron. 2016; 89: 285-299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), which enables identification of GCaMP-expressing neurons with subsequent demixing and deconvolution of their fluorescence spikes. We simulated calcium transients in mouse (Figures 5A–5C) and larval zebrafish (Figures 5D–5F) brain, to help us understand the impact of SomaGCaMP versus CNMF on live brain imaging. We simulated the ground-truth spikes in the cell bodies (Figures 5A and 5D), as well as how the data would look in isolated volumes when imaged through a lightsheet microscope (chosen because of its high spatial resolution), reported by GCaMP6f variants (Figures 5B and 5E) versus SomaGCaMP6f variants (Figures 5C and 5F). We simulated in-plane and out-of-plane artifacts of neuropil driven by the point-spread function of the microscope and then calculated the correlation between the simulated ground-truth spiking and the microscope-observed spiking that would be observed when expressing GCaMP6f versus SomaGCaMP6f variants. We found that for both mice (Figure 5G) and fish (Figure 5H), the correlation between the simulated ground-truth spiking and the microscope-observed spiking reported by SomaGCaMP variants was significantly higher than when the microscope-observed spiking was reported by GCaMP6f (Table S4, statistics for Figure 5). CNMF, in contrast, did not increase the correlation between the simulated ground-truth spiking and the microscope-observed spiking reported by either GCaMP6f or SomaGCaMP variants. Thus, CNMF may reduce correlations in calcium imaging data, but at least in simulation, some of that reduction in correlation may be reduction in actual signal. We transiently and sparsely expressed GCaMP6f, SomaGCaMP6f1, SomaGCaMP6f2, GCaMP7f, or SomaGCaMP7f, along with mCherry as a cell morphology marker, in the brains of larval zebrafish (Figures 6A and 6B ). All of these molecules expressed successfully, but we focused on comparing GCaMP6f and SomaGCaMP6f1, because the SomaGCaMP6f1 fish transgenic line was the first to be ready for experimentation. We evaluated the green-to-red ratio for SomaGCaMP6f1 and SomaGCaMP7f and found it to decrease to a few percent over the first 150 μm of neurite coming out of the cell body (Figure 6C).

The IgSF interactome represents an important resource to fuel biological discoveries and a framework for understanding the functional organization of the surfaceome during homeostasis and disease, ultimately informing therapeutic development. The plasma membrane constitutes a critical biological interface between the cytosol and the extracellular environment of the cell. Cell surface receptors are therefore quintessential regulators of cellular communication and interaction with the extracellular milieu, control signaling cascades during homeostasis, and are largely responsible for dysregulation during disease (Overington et al., 2006Overington J.P.

The protein families that dictate these processes have expanded greatly during evolution, and recent studies predict that over 3,000 genes in the human genome encode for membrane-expressed proteins (Thul et al., 2017Thul P.J.

Our fragmentary understanding of the extracellular interactome can be partially attributed to the difficulties associated with the study of membrane proteins and limited compatibility with most high-throughput proteomics technologies (Martinez-Martin, 2017Martinez-Martin N.

To address these challenges and comprehensively study the extracellular protein networks in humans, we recently developed a technology for high-throughput detection of receptor-ligand interactions within a near complete library of human single transmembrane (STM) proteins (Martinez-Martin et al., 2018Martinez-Martin N. Marcandalli J. Huang C.S. Arthur C.P. Perotti M. Foglierini M. Ho H. Dosey A.M. Shriver S.

In this study, we utilize our discovery platform to elucidate the extracellular interaction network for the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), the most represented domain in human proteins (Özkan et al., 2013Özkan E.

IgSF members mediate a wide array of functionalities and represent a major focus for drug development efforts. Nevertheless, although select IgSF proteins have been studied in great detail, the majority remain uncharacterized in terms of binding partners and biological activity. To our knowledge, there has been no systematic experimental evaluation of the ensemble of interactions between human IgSF members, let alone between IgSF and a comprehensive set of STM receptors. To systematically study this interaction ensemble, we screened 445 IgSF proteins against the STM library, resulting in a network of 577 high confidence protein-protein interactions (PPI) that revealed more than 400 interactions previously undocumented in either BioPlex (https://bioplex.hms.harvard.edu; Huttlin et al., 2017Huttlin E.L.

Parzen H. et al.Architecture of the human interactome defines protein communities and disease networks.Nature. 2017; 545: 505-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar), Biogrid (Chatr-Aryamontri et al., 2017Chatr-Aryamontri A.

Sellam A. et al.The BioGRID interaction database: 2017 update.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45: D369-D379Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), or STRING (Szklarczyk et al., 2015Szklarczyk D.

Tsafou K.P. et al.STRING v10: protein-protein interaction networks, integrated over the tree of life.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: D447-D452Crossref PubMed Scopus (6709) Google Scholar). Using complementary biophysical methods, cell-based assays, and co-immunoprecipitation studies, we confirmed more than 60 receptor-ligand pairs, including interactors for prominent immune receptors, such as PD-L1/CD274 and PD-L2/PDCD1LG2. Integration of the IgSF interactome with human tissue expression profiles suggested functional associations between families, placing multitude of proteins with unknown or poorly defined functions in a biological context, including orphan receptors. In the same vein, overlay with differential mRNA and protein expression profiles in tumors enabled identification of interacting communities synergistically dysregulated, highlighting perturbations that may play a prominent role in cancer. Finally, evaluation of the IgSF Interactome in a cohort of cancer patients treated with the anti-PD-L1 therapeutic antibody atezolizumab revealed interacting protein communities associated with CD8+ T-effector (Teff) cell function and uncovered protein interaction signatures highly correlated with lack of response to treatment and survival. In sum, this study presents an experimental map of human extracellular protein interactions, spanning a significant fraction of the IgSF and STM receptors encoded by the human genome. Our results reveal hundreds of previously unknown interactions, including binding partners for prominent immune receptors and orphan proteins, suggesting functional associations between protein families and providing valuable insights into dysregulation of receptor-ligand pairs in tumors. Combined with clinical data, our work identifies interacting protein signatures significantly associated with clinical outcome, which uncover potential determinants of response and resistance to treatment. Collectively, this study represents an important resource to identify therapeutically relevant targets, and provides insights into individual receptor functions as well as global human receptome organization. Striving toward the goal of elucidating the human extracellular interactome, we sought to determine the network of interactions between the IgSF and STM receptors in the human genome. First, a comprehensive list of STM receptors, including the IgSF, was compiled. A collection 445 human proteins, covering 365 proteins with at least one IgSF domain (≈73% of the superfamily) was complemented with selected functionally relevant extracellular proteins to constitute the set of “query” proteins to be screened against a library of >1,100 unique STM proteins, referred to as “preys” (Figures 1A and S1A; Table S1). To enable robust detection of receptor interactions at large scale, we recently implemented a cell surface interaction screen to interrogate this collection of STM proteins in high-throughput (Bushell et al., 2008Bushell K.M. Söllner C. Schuster-Boeckler B. Bateman A. Wright G.J.

We have previously demonstrated the power of this technology to detect receptor-ligand interactions characterized by a wide range of affinities, including transient interactions with micromolar KD (Martinez-Martin et al., 2018Martinez-Martin N.

To further benchmark the sensitivity and robustness of this platform, PD-1/PDCD1 and PD-L2/PDCD1LG2 proteins were screened following the procedure described (Figure 1B). All expected interactors were detected with high normalized signal (>0.75), high binding specificity, and reproducibility (Pearson’s r ≥0.87) (Figures 1C and S1B–S1D).Figure S1A Discovery Pipeline to Systematically Map IgSF-STM Receptor Interactions, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Venn Diagram representing the overlap between the number of unique proteins with documented interactions in three comprehensive protein-protein interaction resources (Biogrid, Bioplex and STRING) and the STM library used for the screen presented in this study.

Known binding partners of the respective query proteins are labeled. The systematic exploration of the interaction repertoire between IgSF members and STM receptors entailed screening over 2,000 individual 384-well plates to test ∼600,000 binary binding events (Figure S2A). To enable analysis of this dataset and reliably identify non-specific (false-positives) binders in an automated manner we developed a custom computational classification tool. To allow comparisons between thousands of screenings results, the enzymatic absorbance values were normalized and used to compute query and prey Z scores. Additionally, a custom specificity score was computed for each interacting pair (Figures 2B and S2B; STAR Methods). To predict high-confidence interactions, a supervised classification algorithm using the four above described metrics was trained on a benchmark dataset (Figures S2C–S2E; Table S2). This resulted in 577 predicted high-confidence interactions between 440 unique IgSF and STM proteins, referred to as the “IgSF interactome” (Figure 2A; Table S2; Data S1). To facilitate data integration, analysis, and visualization, the IgSF interactome was represented as a cytoscape interaction network where “nodes” represent extracellular proteins and “edges” the interactions between them (Figure 2A). A network analysis showed that the IgSF interactome network is highly connected with on average of 2–3 neighbors per node and with topological coefficients following a power-law distribution (Figure 2C), a hallmark of scale-free networks (Barabási, 2009Barabási A.L. Scale-free networks: a decade and beyond.Science. 2009; 325: 412-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar), altogether suggesting that the network consists of modular components with dense intra-connectivity and sparse but relevant interconnectivity (Albert, 2005Albert R.

The largest overlap was found with the STRING database (82/1,037) and the smallest overlap with the combined BioPlex in HEK293 and HCT116 cells (11/350), an important observation given the scale and coverage of the BioPlex effort (Figure S1A). Integration of protein localization information (from the Human Protein Atlas) revealed that the number of interactions between two extracellular proteins is disproportionally low (∼1%) in BioPlex (Figure 2E), further highlighting the relevance of the present study to address interactions that take place in the extracellular environment. Finally, given that all IgSF query proteins are also included as STM library proteins, we investigated the percentage of reciprocal binding events for 316 heterophilic interactions in our screen. Indeed, 114 interactions (∼36%) were observed both as query-prey and prey-query pair (Figure 2F; Table S2), whereas 202 (∼64%) were not reproduced reciprocally. These included well-known protein pairs such as CTLA4, which as a query failed to bind the CD80 and CD86 library proteins, despite their demonstrated activity upon the CD28 query protein, suggesting that the format in which protein pairs are studied can influence their binding properties and result in potential false-negatives when not tested reciprocally. The inherent challenges associated with the study of plasma membrane proteins have importantly hindered a systematic exploration of functional relationships between human receptors. To facilitate a functional interpretation of the IgSF Interactome, healthy tissue mRNA expression profiles for all genes in the network were obtained from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEX) project (Pierson et al., 2015Pierson E. Koller D. Battle A. Mostafavi S. Ardlie K.G. Getz G. Wright F.A. Kellis M. Volpi S. Dermitzakis E.T. GTEx ConsortiumSharing and Specificity of Co-expression Networks across 35 Human Tissues.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2015; 11: e1004220Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar; Figure S3A). In agreement with the hypothesis that network modules with tight functional relationships are more likely to be co-expressed, we observed that the global tissue correlation coefficients for pairs of interacting proteins were significantly higher, compared to those of non-interacting pairs (p < 1.2 e−20, one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (Figure 3B). Given the clear agreement between physical and co-expression evidence, GTEX expression correlation coefficients were used to inform clustering of the IgSF Interactome into modular components or “communities” (Figures 3A and S3B; Table S3). The clustered Interactome displayed a number of tightly connected communities between closely related IgSF members, such as the nectin receptors (Figure 3, cluster 13) or the semaphorin/plexin family (Figure 3, cluster 21), among others. Next, each community was interrogated with a custom Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis to attempt its functional classification. This enrichment analysis showed that all sizeable communities (n > 2) captured known IgSF biological processes and enabled assignment of putative functions to poorly characterized extracellular proteins, by association (Figure 3A; Table S3).Figure 3Network Clustering by Healthy Tissue Expression Correlations Reveals Functionally Related CommunitiesShow full caption(A) The IgSF interactome dissected into modular communities based on network connectivity and healthy tissue gene expression profiles.

While software techniques have been developed for simulating single hearts, there remain significant challenges in simulating cohorts of virtual hearts from multiple patients. To facilitate the development of new simulation and model analysis techniques by groups without direct access to medical data, image analysis techniques and meshing tools, we have created the first publicly available virtual cohort of twenty-four four-chamber hearts. Our cohort was built from heart failure patients, age 67±14 years. We segmented four-chamber heart geometries from end-diastolic (ED) CT images and generated linear tetrahedral meshes with an average edge length of 1.1±0.2mm. Ventricular fibres were added in the ventricles with a rule-based method with an orientation of -60° and 80° at the epicardium and endocardium, respectively. We additionally refined the meshes to an average edge length of 0.39±0.10mm to show that all given meshes can be resampled to achieve an arbitrary desired resolution. We ran simulations for ventricular electrical activation and free mechanical contraction on all 1.1mm-resolution meshes to ensure that our meshes are suitable for electro-mechanical simulations. Simulations for electrical activation resulted in a total activation time of 149±16ms. Free mechanical contractions gave an average left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) ejection fraction (EF) of 35±1% and 30±2%, respectively, and a LV and RV stroke volume (SV) of 95±28mL and 65±11mL, respectively. By making the cohort publicly available, we hope to facilitate large cohort computational studies and to promote the development of cardiac computational electro-mechanics for clinical applications."
https://openalex.org/W3037229000,"Adult mammalian hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside in the bone marrow (BM) but can be mobilized into blood for use in transplantation. HSCs interact with BM niche cells that produce growth factor c-Kit ligand (Kitl/SCF) and chemokine CXCL12, and were thought to be static and sessile. We used two-photon laser scanning microscopy to visualize genetically labeled HSCs in the BM of live mice for several hours. The majority of HSCs showed a dynamic non-spherical morphology and significant motility, undergoing slow processive motion interrupted by short stretches of confined motion. HSCs moved in the perivascular space and showed intermittent close contacts with SCF-expressing perivascular stromal cells. In contrast, mobilization-inducing blockade of CXCL12 receptor CXCR4 and integrins rapidly abrogated HSC motility and shape dynamics in real time. Our results reveal an unexpectedly dynamic nature of HSC residence in the BM and interaction with the SCF+ stromal niche, which is disrupted during HSC mobilization."

https://openalex.org/W3037728723,"Adaptive movements are critical for animal survival. To guide future actions, the brain monitors various outcomes, including achievement of movement and appetitive goals. The nature of these outcome signals and their neuronal and network realization in the motor cortex (M1), which directs skilled movements, is largely unknown. Using a dexterity task, calcium imaging, optogenetic perturbations, and behavioral manipulations, we studied outcome signals in the murine forelimb M1. We found two populations of layer 2-3 neurons, termed success- and failure-related neurons, that develop with training, and report end results of trials. In these neurons, prolonged responses were recorded after success or failure trials independent of reward and kinematics. In addition, the initial state of layer 5 pyramidal tract neurons contained a memory trace of the previous trial's outcome. Intertrial cortical activity was needed to learn new task requirements. These M1 layer-specific performance outcome signals may support reinforcement motor learning of skilled behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3038072412,"The maturation of the mammalian brain occurs after birth, and this stage of neuronal development is frequently impaired in neurological disorders, such as autism and schizophrenia. However, the mechanisms that regulate postnatal brain maturation are poorly defined. By purifying neuronal subpopulations across brain development in mice, we identify a postnatal switch in the transcriptional regulatory circuits that operates in the maturing mammalian brain. We show that this developmental transition includes the formation of hundreds of cell-type-specific neuronal enhancers that appear to be modulated by neuronal activity. Once selected, these enhancers are active throughout adulthood, suggesting that their formation in early life shapes neuronal identity and regulates mature brain function."
https://openalex.org/W3037204282,"Exposure to microgravity results in vascular remodeling and cardiovascular dysfunction. To elucidate the mechanism involved in this condition, we investigated whether endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress during simulated microgravity induced endothelial inflammation and apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Microgravity was simulated by clinorotation in the current study. We examined markers of ER stress, inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS)/NO content, proinflammatory cytokine production, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)/IκB signaling, NLRP3 inflammasome, and detected apoptosis in HUVECs. We found that the levels of C/EBP homologous protein and glucose-regulated protein 78, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-8, and IL-1β), and iNOS/NO content were upregulated by clinorotation. ER stress inhibition with tauroursodeoxycholic acid or 4-phenylbutyric acid and iNOS inhibition with 1400 W dramatically suppressed activation of the NF-κB/IκB pathway and the NLRP3 inflammasome, and decreased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The increase of apoptosis in HUVECs during clinorotation was significantly suppressed by inhibiting ER stress, iNOS activity, NF-κB/IκB, and the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway. Therefore, simulated microgravity causes ER stress in HUVECs, and subsequently activates iNOS/NO-NF-κB/IκB and the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway, which have key roles in the induction of endothelial inflammation and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W3037263639,"China reported a major outbreak of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV2, from mid-January till mid-March 2020. We review the epidemic virus growth and decline curves in China using a phenomenological logistic growth model to summarize the outbreak dynamics using three parameters that characterize the epidemic’s timing, rate and peak. During the initial phase, the number of virus cases doubled every 2.7 days (range 2.2–4.4 across provinces). The rate of increase in the number of reported cases peaked approximately 10 days after suppression measures were started on 23–25 January 2020. The peak in the number of reported sick cases occurred on average 18 days after the start of suppression measures. From the time of starting measures till the peak, the number of cases increased by a factor 39 in the province Hubei, and by a factor 9.5 for all of China (range: 6.2–20.4 in the other provinces). Complete suppression took up to 2 months (range: 23-57d.), during which period severe restrictions, social distancing measures, testing and isolation of cases were in place. The suppression of the disease in China has been successful, demonstrating that suppression is a viable strategy to contain SARS-CoV2."
https://openalex.org/W3039815988,"Mobile Bay, the fourth largest estuary in the USA located in the northern Gulf of Mexico, is known for extreme hypoxia in the water column during dry season caused by NH4+-rich and anoxic submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). Nutrient dynamics in the coastal ecosystem point to potentially elevated microbial activities; however, little is known about microbial community composition and their functional roles in this area. In this study, we investigated microbial community composition, distribution, and metabolic prediction along the coastal hydrological compartment of Mobile Bay using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We collected microbial samples from surface (river and bay water) and subsurface water (groundwater and coastal pore water from two SGD sites with peat and sandy lithology, respectively). Salinity was identified as the primary factor affecting the distribution of microbial communities across surface water samples, while DON and PO43- were the major predictor of community shift within subsurface water samples. Higher microbial diversity was found in coastal pore water in comparison to surface water samples. Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidia, and Oxyphotobacteria dominated the bacterial community. Among the archaea, methanogens were prevalent in the peat-dominated SGD site, while the sandy SGD site was characterized by a higher proportion of ammonia-oxidizing archaea. Cyanobium PCC-6307 and unclassified Thermodesulfovibrionia were identified as dominant taxa strongly associated with trends in environmental parameters in surface and subsurface samples, respectively. Microbial communities found in the groundwater and peat layer consisted of taxa known for denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). This finding suggested that microbial communities might also play a significant role in mediating nitrogen transformation in the SGD flow path and in affecting the chemical composition of SGD discharging to the water column. Given the ecological importance of microorganisms, further studies at higher taxonomic and functional resolution are needed to accurately predict chemical biotransformation processes along the coastal hydrological continuum, which influence water quality and environmental condition in Mobile Bay."
https://openalex.org/W3037051980,"Background Physical inactivity and chronic pain are both major public health concerns worldwide. Although the health benefits of regular physical exercise are well-documented, few large epidemiological studies have investigated the association between specific domains of physical exercise and chronic pain in young adults. We sought to investigate the association between frequency, intensity and duration of physical exercise, and chronic pain. Methods Data stem from the SHoT2018-study, a national health survey for higher education in Norway, in which 36,625 fulltime students aged 18–35 years completed all relevant questionnaires. Chronic pain, defined according to the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11), was assessed with a newly developed hierarchical digital instrument for reporting both distribution and characteristics of pain in predefined body regions. Physical exercise was assessed using three sets of questions, measuring the number of times exercising each week, and the average intensity and the number of hours each time. Results The majority (54%) of the students reported chronic pain in at least one location, and the prevalence was especially high among women. The overall pattern was an inverse dose-response association between exercise and chronic pain: the more frequent, harder or longer the physical exercise, the lower the risk of chronic pain. Similar findings were generally also observed for the number of pain locations: frequent exercise was associated with fewer pain locations. Adjusting for demographical, lifestyle factors and depression had little effect on the magnitude of the associations. Conclusion Given the many health benefits of regular exercise, there is much to be gained in facilitating college and university students to be more physically active, ideally, thru a joint responsibility between political and educational institutions. Due to the cross-sectional nature of the study, one should be careful to draw a firm conclusion about the direction of causality."
https://openalex.org/W3037716972,"The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a crucial factor in cancer progression. In breast cancer, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and the derived stromal components have been recognized as comprising the majority of the pathological structure of the TME. In this study, we show that metformin (Met), a diabetes drug, transforms CAFs in the TME. Met disrupts tumor-stromal cross talk by preventing breast cancer cell transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling and the production of stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) by CAFs. The suppression of bidirectional signaling between tumor cells and CAFs by Met is attributed to increased phospho-AMP kinase (p-AMPK) levels. By upregulating p-AMPK in CAFs, Met induces prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs), leading to the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) in CAFs. Moreover, interruption of HIF-1α-driven SDF-1 signaling in CAFs by Met leads to decreased breast cancer cell invasion. These findings suggest that Met may be used to target tumor-promoting signaling between CAFs and breast cancer cells in the TME."
https://openalex.org/W3038046699,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by altered epithelial cell phenotypes, which are associated with myofibroblast accumulation in the lung. Atypical alveolar epithelial cells in IPF express molecular markers of airway epithelium. Polymorphisms within and around Toll interacting protein (TOLLIP) are associated with the susceptibility to IPF and mortality. However, the functional role of TOLLIP in IPF is unknown. Using lung tissues from IPF and control subjects, we showed that expression of TOLLIP gene in the lung parenchyma is globally lower in IPF compared to controls. Lung cells expressing significant levels of TOLLIP include macrophages, alveolar type II, and basal cells. TOLLIP protein expression is lower in the parenchyma of IPF lungs but is expressed in the atypical epithelial cells of the distal fibrotic regions. Using overexpression and silencing approaches, we demonstrate that TOLLIP protects cells from bleomycin-induced apoptosis using primary bronchial epithelial cells and BEAS-2B cells. The protective effects are mediated by reducing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and upregulating autophagy. Therefore, global downregulation of the TOLLIP gene in IPF lungs may predispose injured lung epithelial cells to apoptosis and to the development of IPF."
https://openalex.org/W3037150172,"Pathogenic clostridial species secrete potent toxins that induce severe host tissue damage. Paeniclostridium sordellii lethal toxin (TcsL) causes an almost invariably lethal toxic shock syndrome associated with gynecological infections. TcsL is 87% similar to C. difficile TcdB, which enters host cells via Frizzled receptors in colon epithelium. However, P. sordellii infections target vascular endothelium, suggesting that TcsL exploits another receptor. Here, using CRISPR/Cas9 screening, we establish semaphorins SEMA6A and SEMA6B as TcsL receptors. We demonstrate that recombinant SEMA6A can protect mice from TcsL-induced edema. A 3.3 Å cryo-EM structure shows that TcsL binds SEMA6A with the same region that in TcdB binds structurally unrelated Frizzled. Remarkably, 15 mutations in this evolutionarily divergent surface are sufficient to switch binding specificity of TcsL to that of TcdB. Our findings establish semaphorins as physiologically relevant receptors for TcsL and reveal the molecular basis for the difference in tissue targeting and disease pathogenesis between highly related toxins."

I have tried to live in a world that does not see color but have only succeeded in living in a world that does not see me. I am a medical doctor and a scientist; the first African American awarded a PhD in neuroscience at Duke University. I have led a National Institutes of Health-funded research lab for almost a decade, and I was awarded the Society for Neuroscience Young Investigator Prize in 2019. I am an American Association for the Advancement of Science Alan I. Leshner Public Engagement Fellow, and I have hosted TEDMED three times. I am a scholar, teacher, mentor, speaker, and mental health advocate. I have served on national commissions, I have advanced federal policy, and I have even held court with a president of the United States. I have published in Cell scientific journals, and as a peer reviewer, I have worked to advance the scientific rigor of my colleagues. Yet, most days, I am unseen and unknown. As I watched a knee slowly, mercilessly, and inhumanly extinguish yet another black life, I was overwhelmed by anger and sorrow, and at this very moment, I am terrified to run on the trail near my home. I am a black academic in America. Academia is the space where evidence is created, explored, and shared. I started medical school 20 years ago full of the belief that everyone was equal and that scientific evidence was fair, unbiased, and always reflected the truth. Yet, I was soon confronted by overwhelming images of black men in my textbooks who all had advanced-staged sexually transmitted diseases. Surely it wasn’t only black men that get STDs? These subtexts about race and health infected many of the narratives that accompanied daily morning rounds in the hospital. One day, it became strikingly clear that the academic system was subtly advancing an insidious idea that everyone was not indeed equal. As I grew as a scientist, I began to recognize the profound consequences of this insidious framework. I learned that blacks were underrepresented in the clinical trials used to achieve FDA approval for many commonly prescribed medications. How could any well-reasoned scholar then argue that these medications worked as well for black patients? Even the large-scale genomic studies I read in the world-leading scientific journals as a physician-scientist trainee did not extrapolate to blacks. Did black lives even matter with regards to the equitable development and distribution of medical interventions? Every corner of the academic system seemed to suggest that they did not, and there were few black academics to generate alternative evidence to confront this insidiously biased framework. Even now, only 1%–2% of scientists awarded major grants by the National Institutes of Health are black. Painfully, scientific evidence also suggests that even after accounting for training institutions, publication records, and major awards, the review system used to select winners for these research grants is biased against blacks. While these systematic realities each take their emotional and intellectual toll, my personal experiences as a black academic in America have been much more scarring. There was the time a “well-meaning” individual called the police to report a black man soliciting in my friend’s neighborhood. The squad car arrived as I was walking toward my friend’s house from a nearby pond; my Danskos, scrubs, white coat, Duke medical school ID badge, and the oversized anatomy book in my hand were not sufficient evidence to bypass their 20 min inquisition. There was the first time that I was invited to give a keynote lecture at a major international conference. While I stood in the hotel lobby with my colleagues, a woman walked through the crowd and handed me her suitcase. I was the only black face in sight. Then, there are the endless occasions where colleagues who always say “hi” when I am wearing my white coat either don’t recognize me when I wave or even make eye contact with me when I am wearing sweatpants (my preferred outfit in the lab). The most embarrassing experience was when I went to grab a slice of pizza at my department lunch after a student seminar. A staff member quickly approached and asked me who I work for (myself) and then whose lab I was in (my own) as if I had not understood the question, though we were literally standing in the same research building that I’ve spent the vast majority of my time in as a graduate student, postdoctoral researcher, clinical resident, and faculty over the last 20 years. I responded in the same way I always do. I hid myself and answered with a smile. I am a black man, and the idea of making people feel uncomfortable about my presence always feels like career suicide. Since then, I’ve sat in far too many meetings where there are no faces that look like mine. “The pipeline doesn’t exist—it’s impossible to recruit talented black people,” they say. And so, I choose to quietly protest this entire academic system with my excellence. I held my protests at Duke, MIT, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, WashU, UPenn, Yale, Weill Cornell, Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, Stanford, UCSF, Columbia, UVA, University of Rochester, Tufts, University of Maryland School of Medicine, UT Southwestern, Baylor, NYU, University of Chicago, Northwestern, UIC, UT San Antonio, UNC, NC State, Brown, University of Buffalo, Ohio State, University of Minnesota, UCSD, UCLA, University of Colorado Anschultz, Cal Tech, National Institutes of Health, Woods Hole, Einstein, and the University of Florida. For the few black trainees in the audience, it is the first time that they see a face that looks like theirs at the podium. I prepare endlessly to become the best because my excellence gives these trainees hope. I must outwork this system. I must outlast this system. I must be scientifically sound and full of wit. It’s the only way to have impact. I must be endlessly optimistic. It’s the only way to endure the unceasing environmental cues that scream I don’t belong. I bear the full weight of my experiences, my perspectives, and my community as I work tirelessly to advance the biomedical research enterprise and the mental health of all Americans. Every meeting is my protest. Every protest is exhausting. There is a price that I pay every single day. I accept this unfathomable personal cost to create new evidence and to counterbalance insidious historical untruths. I also bear the shared experiences of the many young scientists that I mentor. We are all tired, and we have been crippled by the weight of these chronic and acute experiences. And yet, we all continue to yearn and desperately hope for a day when AllLivesMatter. This was Martin Luther King Jr.’s dream, the self-evident promise whispered at our precious America’s inception. We are drowning in sorrow. Yet, we are also overbrimming with hope as our beloved America finally awakens to the notion that all lives cannot matter until BlackLivesMatter too. We are black academics in America. We too define the truth, and it is time for our colleagues to listen and, in this instance, follow."
https://openalex.org/W3039640712,"Two invasive mussels (zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha and quagga mussel D. rostriformis bugensis) have restructured the benthic habitat of many water bodies in both Europe and North America. Quagga mussels dominate in most lakes where they co-occur even though zebra mussels typically invade lakes first. A reversal to zebra mussel over time has rarely been observed. Laboratory experiments have shown that quagga mussels grow faster than zebra mussels when predator kairomones are present and this faster growth is associated with lower investment in anti-predator response in quagga mussels than zebra mussels. This led to the hypothesis that the dominance of quagga mussels is due to faster growth that is not offset by higher vulnerability to predators when predation rates are low, as may be expected in newly colonized lakes. It follows that in lakes with high predation pressure, the anti-predatory investments of zebra mussels should be more advantageous and zebra mussels should be the more abundant of the two species. In Onondaga Lake, NY, a meso-eutrophic lake with annual mussel surveys from 2005 to 2018, quagga mussels increased from less than 6% of the combined mussel biomass in 2007 to 82% in 2009 (from 3 to 69% by number), rates typical of this displacement process elsewhere, but then declined again to 11–20% of the mussel biomass in 2016–2018. Average total mussel biomass also declined from 344–524 g shell-on dry weight (SODW)/m2 in 2009–2011 to 34–73 g SODW/m2 in 2016–2018, mainly due to fewer quagga mussels. This decline in total mussel biomass and a return to zebra mussel as the most abundant species occurred as the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) increased in abundance. Both the increase to dominance of quagga mussels and the subsequent decline following the increase in this molluscivorous fish are consistent with the differences in the trade-off between investment in growth and investment in defenses of the two species. We predict that similar changes in dreissenid mussel populations will occur in other lakes following round goby invasions, at least on the habitats colonized by both species."
https://openalex.org/W3037678785,"Although renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a common malignant urological cancer, its pathogenesis remains unclear. Previous studies have indicated that miR-140-5p acts as a tumor suppressor in various tumors, including bladder cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and gastric cancer, but its biological function in RCC remains unknown. In the present study, we found that miR-140-5p was upregulated in RCC tissues, whereas Kruppel-like factor 9 (KLF9) was downregulated and correlated inversely with miR-140-5p in RCC tissues. miR-140-5p promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of RCC cells in vitro, and knockdown of miR-140-5p significantly suppressed tumor growth and lung metastasis in nude mouse model of RCC. We also found that miR-140-5p significantly suppressed the expression of KLF9 by binding to the 3'-UTR of KLF9 mRNA and that KLF9, as a transcription factor, upregulates KCNQ1 (also called Kv 7.1 and Kv LQT1) expression by binding to the site (-841/-827) in the KCNQ1 promoter region in RCC cells. Moreover, forced expression of KCNQ1 decreased the growth and metastasis of RCC cells. These results suggest that the miR-140-5p/KLF9/KCNQ1 axis functions as a key signaling pathway in RCC progression and metastasis and represents a potential target of RCC therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3037676939,"This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and clinical significance of lead-related tricuspid regurgitation (TR) in patients with permanent pacemaker (PM). A total of 2,533 patients who underwent permanent PM implantation between January 2008 and December 2017 in a single center were retrospectively reviewed. Among them, 429 patients who underwent transthoracic echocardiography within 90 days before implantation and were followed up at least 3 months after PM implantation were included. Patients who had pre-existing grade 3 or 4 TR, had a single atrial lead, or had undergone tricuspid valve surgery before PM implantation were excluded. Occurrence of PM-related TR (PMTR) was defined as worsening of TR by at least 2 grades on follow-up echocardiography. Cardiovascular outcomes were defined as the composite of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure. During the median follow-up of 855 days, 42 (9.8%) patients had PMTR and 86 (20.0%) presented with cardiovascular outcomes. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the presence of atrial fibrillation (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.07, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.27–4.09, p = 0.037]) and history of open-heart surgery (HR: 3.34, 95% CI: 1.68–6.68, p<0.001) were independently associated with PMTR. Patients with PMTR showed significantly higher cardiovascular events than those without (45.2 vs. 17.3%, log-rank p<0.001). Furthermore, PMTR was independently associated with the primary outcome (HR: 2.45, 95% CI: 1.43–4.22, p = 0.001). In conclusion, the occurrence of TR in patients with permanent PM is not uncommon. PMTR is associated with atrial fibrillation, the history of open-heart surgery, and poorer cardiovascular outcomes."

Ovarian RNA levels of most genes related to lipid and amino acid metabolism were higher in stage II and III than in stage IV. Serum contents of differential metabolites in arginine, cysteine, methionine, purine, tyrosine, lysine, valine, leucine and isoleucine metabolism pathways peaked at stage III, while the contents of sarcosine, alanine and histidine, as well as most oxylipins derived from fatty acids peaked at stage IV. These results indicated the more active amino acids, lipid metabolism, and energy dynamics of fish body in response to the high energy input of ovary developing from stage II to III, and the importance of alanine, histidine, taurine, folate and oxylipins for fish with ovary at stage IV."
https://openalex.org/W3037985328,"The newly reassorted IAV subtypes from zoonotic reservoirs respond poorly to current vaccines and antiviral therapy. There is an unmet need in developing novel antiviral drugs for better control of IAV infection. The cellular factors that are crucial for virus replication have been sought as novel molecular targets for antiviral therapy. Recent studies have shown that Janus kinases (JAK), JAK1, and JAK2, play an important role in IAV replication. Leflunomide is an anti-inflammatory drug primarily used for treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Prior studies suggest that A77 1726, the active metabolite of leflunomide, inhibits the activity of JAK1 and JAK3. Our current study aims to determine if A77 1726 can function as a JAK inhibitor to control IAV infection. Here, we report that A77 1726 inhibited the replication of three IAV subtypes（H5N1, H1N1, H9N2）in three cell types (chicken embryonic fibroblasts, A549, and MDCK). A77 1726 inhibited JAK1, JAK2, and STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation. Similar observations were made with Ruxolitinib (Rux), a JAK-specific inhibitor. JAK2 overexpression enhanced H5N1 virus replication and compromised the antiviral activity of A77 1726. Leflunomide inhibited virus replication in the lungs of IAV-infected mice, alleviated their body weight loss, and prolonged their survival. Our study demonstrates for the first time the ability of A77 1726 to inhibit JAK2 activity and suggests that inhibition of JAK activity contributes to its antiviral activity."
https://openalex.org/W3038334349,"Background Increasing attention is being paid to cancer information seeking (CISE) (active searching for cancer-related health information) and information scanning (CISC) (passive collection of cancer-related health information) among migrants. However, information is lacking with respect to the extent and distribution of CISE and CISC among migrants, particularly in Japan. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of both CISE and CISC, to clarify factors associated with CISE and CISC, and to elucidate the association of CISE and CISC with basic cancer knowledge and preventive behavior among Nepalese migrants living in Tokyo, Japan. Methods Nepalese migrants living in Tokyo were recruited from March to August 2019, with snowball sampling. We collected data on CISE, CISC, sociodemographic components, health-related factors, knowledge about risk factors for cancer, and cancer-prevention behavior using a structured questionnaire. We employed several regression approaches to fulfill our study objectives. Results Out of the total 200 participants, 53 (27%) were actively involved in CISE and 176 (88%) in CISC. Internet was the most common information source. High education level and Japanese language skills were positively associated with both CISE and CISC. Migrants with low perceived health status were more likely to perform CISC, while those who had been ill last year and who perceived proper access to doctors were more likely to undertake CISE. Migrants with high CISE (B = 0.10, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.19) and high CISC (B = 0.16, 95% CI: 0.08, 0.23) were more likely to have better knowledge on risk factors of cancer. Furthermore, migrants with high CISE were more likely to eat fruits (B = 0.17, 95%CI: 0.01, 0.32), undergo pap smear test (OR = 1.72, 95%CI: 1.12, 2.65), and colonoscopy (OR = 6.02, 95%CI: 1.63, 22.13). Conclusion In this study, the proportion of Nepalese migrants who deliberately undertook CISE was low, while the practice of CISC was relatively common. Given that the CISE was associated with cancer-prevention behavior, proper strategies should be implemented to alleviate barriers for CISE and improve its impact on providing reliable evidence about cancer to migrants in Japan."
https://openalex.org/W3037572643,"Muscle adaptations to exercise are underpinned by alterations to the abundance of individual proteins, which may occur through a change either to the synthesis or degradation of each protein. We used deuterium oxide (2H2O) labeling and chronic low-frequency stimulation (CLFS) in vivo to investigate the synthesis, abundance, and degradation of individual proteins during exercise-induced muscle adaptation. Independent groups of rats received CLFS (10 Hz, 24 h/d) and 2H2O for 0, 10, 20, or 30 days. The extensor digitorum longus (EDL) was isolated from stimulated (Stim) and contralateral non-stimulated (Ctrl) legs. Proteomic analysis encompassed 38 myofibrillar and 46 soluble proteins and the rates of change in abundance, synthesis, and degradation were reported in absolute (ng/d) units. Overall, synthesis and degradation made equal contributions to the adaptation of the proteome, including instances where a decrease in protein-specific degradation primarily accounted for the increase in abundance of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W3039496101,"The aim of this study was to investigate pre- and post-diagnostic use of antihypertensive drugs on prostate cancer (PCa)-specific survival and the initiation of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The cohort investigated 8,253 PCa patients with 837 PCa-specific deaths during the median follow-up of 7.6 years after diagnosis. Information on drug use, cancer incidence, clinical features of PCa, and causes of death was collected from Finnish registries. Hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using Cox regression with antihypertensive drug use as a time-dependent variable. Separate analyses were performed on PCa survival related to pre- and post-diagnostic use of drugs and on the initiation of ADT. Antihypertensive drug use overall was associated with an increased risk of PCa-specific death (Pre-PCa: 1.21 (1.04–1.4), Post-PCa: 1.2 (1.02–1.41)). With respect to the separate drug groups, angiotensin II type 1 receptor (ATr) blockers, were associated with improved survival (Post-PCa: 0.81 (0.67–0.99)) and diuretics with an increased risk (Post-PCa: 1.25 (1.05–1.49)). The risk of ADT initiation was slightly higher among antihypertensive drug users as compared to non-users. In conclusion, this study supports anti-cancer effect of ATr blockers on PCa prognosis and this should be investigated further in controlled clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W3037074528,"Visualizing intracellular fatty acids (including free and esterified form) is very useful for understanding how and where such molecules are incorporated, stored, and metabolized within cells. However, techniques of imaging multiple intracellular fatty acids have been limited by their small size, making it difficult to label and track without changing their biological and biophysical characteristics. Here, we present a new method for simultaneously visualizing up to five atomically labeled intracellular fatty acid species. For this, we utilized the distinctive Raman spectra depending on the labeling patterns and created a new, extensible opensource software to perform by-pixel analysis of extracting original spectra from mixed ones. Our multiplex imaging method revealed that fatty acids with more double bonds tend to concentrate more efficiently at lipid droplets. This novel approach contributes to reveal not only the spatial dynamics of fatty acids, but also of any other metabolites inside cells."
https://openalex.org/W3037217748,"Body weight is substantially determined by eating behaviors, which are themselves driven by biological factors interacting with the environment. Previous studies in young children suggest that genetic influences on dopamine function may confer differential susceptibility to the environment in such a way that increases behavioral obesity risk in a lower socioeconomic status (SES) environment but decreases it in a higher SES environment. We aimed to test if this pattern of effect could also be observed in adolescence, another critical period for development in brain and behavior, using a novel measure of predicted expression of the dopamine receptor 4 (DRD4) gene in prefrontal cortex. In a sample of 76 adolescents (37 boys and 39 girls from Baltimore, Maryland/US, aged 14-18y), we estimated individual levels of DRD4 gene expression (PredDRD4) in prefrontal cortex from individual genomic data using PrediXcan, and tested interactions with a composite SES score derived from their annual household income, maternal education, food insecurity, perceived resource availability, and receipt of public assistance. Primary outcomes were snack intake during a multi-item ad libitum meal test, and food-related impulsivity assessed using a food-adapted go/no-go task. A linear regression model adjusted for sex, BMI z-score, and genetic ethnicity demonstrated a PredDRD4 by composite SES score interaction for snack intake (p = 0.009), such that adolescents who had lower PredDRD4 levels exhibited greater snack intake in the lower SES group, but lesser snack intake in the higher SES group. Exploratory analysis revealed a similar pattern for scores on the Perceived Stress Scale (p = 0.001) such that the low PredDRD4 group reported higher stress in the lower SES group, but less stress in the higher SES group, suggesting that PredDRD4 may act in part by affecting perceptions of the environment. These results are consistent with a differential susceptibility model in which genes influencing environmental responsiveness interact with environments varying in obesogenicity to confer behavioral obesity risk in a less favorable environment, but behavioral obesity protection in a favorable one."
https://openalex.org/W3037552531,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Although previous studies have described the clinical aspects of COVID-19, few studies have focused on the early detection of severe COVID-19. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the predictors of severe COVID-19 and to compare clinical features between patients with severe COVID-19 and those with less severe COVID-19. Patients admitted to designated hospital in the Henan Province of China who were either discharged or died prior to February 15, 2020 were enrolled retrospectively. Additionally, patients who underwent at least one of the following treatments were assigned to the severe group: continuous renal replacement therapy, high-flow oxygen absorption, noninvasive and invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The remaining patients were assigned to the non-severe group. Demographic information, initial symptoms, and first visit examination results were collected from the electronic medical records and compared between the groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the predictors of severe COVID-19. A receiver operating characteristic curve was used to identify a threshold for each predictor. Altogether,104 patients were enrolled in our study with 30 and 74 patients in the severe and non-severe groups, respectively. Multivariate logistic analysis indicated that patients aged ≥63 years (odds ratio = 41.0; 95% CI: 2.8, 592.4), with an absolute lymphocyte value of ≤1.02×109/L (odds ratio = 6.1; 95% CI = 1.5, 25.2) and a C-reactive protein level of ≥65.08mg/L (odds ratio = 8.9; 95% CI = 1.0, 74.2) were at a higher risk of severe illness. Thus, our results could be helpful in the early detection of patients at risk for severe illness, enabling the implementation of effective interventions and likely lowering the morbidity of COVID-19 patients."
https://openalex.org/W3037809246,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a common cause of disability, which often leads to sensorimotor cortex dysfunction above the spinal injury site. However, the cerebral regional effects on metabolic information after SCI have been little studied. Here, adult Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into acute and chronic treatment groups and sham groups with day-matched periods. The Basso, Beatte, and Bresnahan scores method were utilized to evaluate the changes in behaviors during the recovery of the animals, and the metabolic information was measured with the 1H-observed/13C-edited NMR method. Total metabolic concentrations in every region were almost similar in both treated groups. However, the metabolic kinetics in most regions in the acute group were significantly altered (P < .05), particularly in the cortical area, thalamus and medulla (P < .01). After long-term recovery, some metabolic kinetics were recovered, especially in the temporal cortex, occipital cortex, and medulla. The metabolic kinetic changes revealed the alteration of metabolism and neurotransmission in different brain regions after SCI, which present evidence for the alternation of brain glucose oxidation. Therefore, this shows the significant influence of SCI on cerebral function and neuroscience research. This study also provides the theoretical basis for clinical therapy after SCI, such as mitochondrial transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W3037996857,"Autophagy is a multistage catabolic process that mediates stress responses. However, the role of autophagy in epidermal proliferation, particularly under conditions when the epidermis becomes “activated” (hyperproliferative), remains unclear. We have shown that inhibition of Beclin 1, a key activator in the initiation phase of autophagy, attenuates imiquimod (IMQ)-induced epidermal hyperplasia in adult mice as well as naturally occurring hyperproliferation in neonatal mouse epidermis. Inhibition of Beclin 1 did not change the levels of several key inflammatory molecules or the numbers of immune cells in lesional skins. This indicates that autophagy does not affect inflammatory regulators in IMQ-treated mouse skin. Bioinformatic analysis combined with gene expression quantitative assays, revealed that a deficiency in autophagy decreases the expression of PDZ Binding Kinase (PBK), a regulator of the cell cycle, in mouse epidermis and human epidermal keratinocytes (HEKs). Interestingly, the decrease in PBK results in inhibition of proliferation in HEKs and such reduced proliferation can be rescued by activation of p38, the downstream signaling of PBK. Collectively, autophagy plays a positive role in epidermal proliferation, which is in part via regulating PBK expression."
https://openalex.org/W3028113930,"Aspirin prevents thrombosis by inhibiting platelet cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 activity and the production of thromboxane (Tx)A2 , a pro-thrombotic eicosanoid. However, the non-platelet actions of aspirin limit its antithrombotic effects. Here, we used platelet-COX-1-ko mice to define the platelet and non-platelet eicosanoids affected by aspirin. Mass-spectrometry analysis demonstrated blood from platelet-COX-1-ko and global-COX-1-ko mice produced similar eicosanoid profiles in vitro: for example, formation of TxA2 , prostaglandin (PG) F2α , 11-hydroxyeicosatraenoic acid (HETE), and 15-HETE was absent in both platelet- and global-COX-1-ko mice. Conversely, in vivo, platelet-COX-1-ko mice had a distinctly different profile from global-COX-1-ko or aspirin-treated control mice, notably significantly higher levels of PGI2 metabolite. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) predicted that platelet-COX-1-ko mice would be protected from thrombosis, forming less pro-thrombotic TxA2 and PGE2 . Conversely, aspirin or lack of systemic COX-1 activity decreased the synthesis of anti-aggregatory PGI2 and PGD2 at non-platelet sites leading to predicted thrombosis increase. In vitro and in vivo thrombosis studies proved these predictions. Overall, we have established the eicosanoid profiles linked to inhibition of COX-1 in platelets and in the remainder of the cardiovascular system and linked them to anti- and pro-thrombotic effects of aspirin. These results explain why increasing aspirin dosage or aspirin addition to other drugs may lessen antithrombotic protection."
https://openalex.org/W3037872778,"Background A cost analysis of implementation of interventions informs budgeting and economic evaluations. Objective To estimate the cost of implementing the integrated chronic disease management (ICDM) model in primary healthcare (PHC) clinics in South Africa. Methods Cost data from the provider’s perspective were collected in 2019 from four PHC clinics with comparable patient caseloads (except for one). We estimated the costs of implementing the ICDM model current activities for three (facility reorganization, clinical supportive management and assisted self-management) components and additional costs of implementing with enhanced fidelity. Costs were estimated based on budget reviews, interviews with management teams, and other published data. The standard of care activities such as medication were not included in the costing. One-way sensitivity analyses were carried out for key parameters by varying patient caseloads, required infrastructure and staff. Annual ICDM model implementation costs per PHC clinic and per patient per visit are presented in 2019 US dollars. Results The overall mean annual cost of implementing the ICDM model was $148 446.00 (SD: $65 125.00) per clinic. Current ICDM model activities cost accounted for 84% ($124 345.00) of the annual mean cost, while additional costs for higher fidelity were 16% ($24 102.00). The mean cost per patient per visit was $6.00 (SD:$0.77); $4.94 (SD:0.70) for current cost and $1.06 (SD:0.33) for additional cost to enhance ICDM model fidelity. For the additional cost, 49% was for facility reorganization, 31% for adherence clubs and 20% for training of nursing staff. In the sensitivity analyses, the major cost drivers were the proportion of effort of assisted self-management staff and the number of patients with chronic diseases receiving care at the clinic. Conclusion Minimal additional cost are required to implement the ICDM model with higher fidelity. Further research on the cost-effectiveness of the ICDM model in middle-income countries is required."
https://openalex.org/W3037293252,"Nogo-A is a key inhibitory molecule to axon regeneration, and plays diverse roles in other pathological conditions, such as stroke, schizophrenia, and neurodegenerative diseases. Nogo-66 and Nogo-Δ20 fragments are two known functional domains of Nogo-A, which act through the Nogo-66 receptor (NgR1) and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2), respectively. Here, we reported a new functional domain of Nogo-A, Nogo-A aa 846-861, was identified in the Nogo-A-specific segment that promotes complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced inflammatory pain. Intrathecal injection of its antagonist peptide 846-861PE or the specific antibody attenuated the CFA-induced inflammatory heat hyperalgesia. The 846-861 PE reduced the content of transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member 1 (TRPV1) in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and decreased the response of DRG neurons to capsaicin. These effects were accompanied by a reduction in LIMK/cofilin phosphorylation and actin polymerization. GST pull-down and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays both showed that Nogo-A aa 846-861 bound to NgR1. Moreover, we demonstrated that Nogo-A aa 846-861 inhibited neurite outgrowth from cortical neurons and DRG explants. We concluded that Nogo-A aa 846-861 is a novel ligand of NgR1, which activates the downstream signaling pathways that inhibit axon growth and promote inflammatory pain."
https://openalex.org/W3037334803,"Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a skeletal disorder characterized by the impaired synthesis of type I collagen (Col1). This study tests the hypothesis that the craniofacial phenotype of severe OI is linked to an overall reduction in body size. 3D landmark data were collected from µCT scans of adult OIM-/- and wild-type (WT) mice and used to calculate centroid sizes (CS) and interlandmark distances (ILDs). To remove the effect of body size, ILDs were scaled against craniomandibular lengths and CS. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare CS and absolute/scaled ILDs between genotypes. OIM-/- mice are smaller than their WT littermates in body mass, craniomandibular CS, and absolute ILDs including skull, basicranial, palatal, mandibular, and toothrow lengths. When linear distances are scaled to CS, OIM-/- mice have a relatively short midface, short nasal bones, tall mandibular corpora, and long mandibular toothrows. Results underscore the importance of size and scaling in morphometric analyses. The deleterious effect of Col1 mutations on global skeletal dimensions combined with localized morphometric changes may underlie the facial phenotype seen in human patients with severe OI. Attempts to identify these localized changes should first account for the restricted growth and small body sizes present in individuals with OI."
https://openalex.org/W3037606073,"Uterine leiomyomas (ULM) are a major public health issue contributing to high morbidity and poor pregnancy outcomes. However, its molecular pathogenesis is poorly understood. HMGA2-ULM is the second major subtype of human ULM and associates with large sizes, fast-growth, and high percentages of estrogen receptor α (ERα). As altered ERα expression plays a distinct role in ULM growth, here, we investigate a regulatory mechanism driving ULM growth via HMGA2 and ERα. We reveal a positive correlation of HMGA2 with ERα protein and demonstrate that HMGA2 promotes ULM cells proliferation via ERα. In addition, autophagy pathway and p62/SQSTM1 (a selective autophagy receptor) are found to participate in the regulation of HMGA2 and ERα. Moreover, HMGA2 suppresses the transcription of p62 by binding to its promoter, meanwhile, p62 interacts with ERα, and inhibition of p62 increases ERα expression and enhances cell viability in ULM, suggesting a novel mechanism of the HMGA2-p62-ERα axis in ULM proliferation. Notably, rapamycin, a familiar autophagy agonist, reduces ERα levels and the proliferation ability of ULM cells. This study demonstrates a causal role of the HMGA2-p62-ERα axis in preventing autophagy and increasing ERα expression in HMGA2-ULM. Therefore, blocking HMGA2-p62-ERα axis and targeting autophagy pathway establish a roadmap toward HMGA2-ULM medical treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3038840816,"Several Amaranthus spp. around the world have evolved resistance (and cross resistance) to various herbicide mechanisms of action. Populations of redroot pigweed (RRPW-R) and tall waterhemp (TW-R) in Mississippi, USA have been suspected to be resistant to one or more acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibiting herbicides. Whole plant dose-response experiments with multiple ALS inhibitors, ALS enzyme assays with pyrithiobac, and molecular sequence analysis of ALS gene constructs were conducted to confirm and characterize the resistance profile and nature of the mechanism in the RRPW-R and TW-R populations. Two susceptible populations, RRPW-S and TW-S were included for comparison with RRPW-R and TW-R, correspondingly. The resistance index (R/S; the herbicide dose required to reduce plant growth by 50% of resistant population compared to the respective susceptible population) values of the RRPW-R population were 1476, 3500, and 900 for pyrithiobac, imazaquin, and trifloxysulfuron, respectively. The R/S values of the TW-R population for pyrithiobac, imazaquin, and trifloxysulfuron were 51, 950, and 2600, respectively. I50 values of RRPW-S and RRPW-R populations for pyrithiobac were 0.062 and 208.33 μM, indicating that the ALS enzyme of the RRPW-R population is 3360-fold more resistant to pyrithiobac than the RRPW-S population under our experimental conditions. The ALS enzyme of the TW-R population was 1214-fold resistant to pyrithiobac compared to the TW-S population, with the I50 values for pyrithiobac of ALS from TW-R and TW-S populations being 87.4 and 0.072 μM, correspondingly. Sequencing of the ALS gene identified a point mutation at position 574 of the ALS gene leading to substitution of tryptophan (W) residue with a leucine (L) residue in both RRPW-R and TW-R populations. Thus, the RRPW-R and TW-R populations are resistant to several ALS-inhibiting herbicides belonging to different chemical classes due to an altered target site, i.e., ALS. Resistance in Amaranthus spp. to commonly used ALS-inhibiting herbicides warrants an integrated weed management scheme incorporating chemical, mechanical, and cultural strategies by growers."

To inform future NCD prevention programs in Bhutan, this study explores knowledge, perception, and the practices of Bhutanese related to NCDs in the context of the philosophy of happiness.Research was conducted in rural and urban communities of Bhutan in 2017 among 79 inhabitants of both genders, aged ≥18. Participants were recruited through purposive sampling with the data collected by in-depth interviews, participatory observation, and anthropometric measurements. Data were analyzed by thematic analysis.Across participants, health was considered as an important element of ""happiness"". However, lifestyle-related NCD risk factors prevailed due to the lack of effective education programs on NCDs and thus the lack of practical knowledge for NCD prevention across society. We further found that the value of happiness ""finding happiness in any situation is virtue"" was universal as well as other traditional values and customs, shaping people's health behaviors. From these observations, it is recommended that more practical NCD education/prevention programs should be urgently introduced in Bhutan that involve multiple generations, religion authorities, educational settings, and medical services.This is the first comprehensive qualitative study on the NCD-related lifestyle risks among Bhutanese concerning the concept of happiness."
https://openalex.org/W3037597937,"The prognostic impact of worsening renal function (WRF) in patients with acute heart failure (AHF) remains under debate. Successful decongestion might offset the negative impact of WRF, but little is known about indicators of successful decongestion in the very acute phase of AHF. We hypothesized that decongestion as evaluated by the percent reduction in brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) could identify relevant prognostic implications of WRF in the very acute phase of AHF.Data on 907 consecutive hospitalized patients with AHF in the REALITY-AHF study (age: 78±12 years; 55.1% male) were analyzed. Creatinine and BNP were measured at baseline and 48 hours from admission. WRF was defined as an increase in creatinine >0.3 mg at 48 hours from admission. The primary endpoint was 1-year all-cause mortality. Patients were divided into four groups according to the presence/absence of WRF and a BNP reduction higher/lower than the median: no-WRF/higher-BNP-reduction (n = 390), no-WRF/lower-BNP-reduction (n = 397), WRF/higher-BNP-reduction (n = 63), and WRF/lower-BNP-reduction groups (n = 57). Kaplan-Meier curve analysis showed that the WRF/lower-BNP-reduction group had a worse prognosis than the other groups. In a Cox regression analysis, only the WRF/lower-BNP-reduction group had higher mortality compared to the no-WRF/higher-BNP-reduction group (hazard ratio: 3.34, p<0.001).In the very acute phase of AHF, BNP reduction may aid in identifying relevant prognostic significance of WRF."
https://openalex.org/W3037680805,"Numerous animal models have been used to investigate the neural mechanisms of auditory processing in complex acoustic environments, but it is unclear whether an animal’s auditory attention is functionally similar to a human’s in processing competing auditory scenes. Here we investigated the effects of attention capture in birds performing an objective auditory streaming paradigm. The classical ABAB… patterned pure tone sequences were modified and used for the task. We trained the birds to selectively attend to a target stream and only respond to the deviant appearing in the target stream, even though their attention may be captured by a deviant in the background stream. When no deviant appeared in the background stream, the birds experience the buildup of streaming process in a qualitatively similar way as they did in a subjective paradigm. Although the birds were trained to selectively attend to the target stream, they failed to avoid the involuntary attention switch caused by the background deviant, especially when the background deviant was sequentially unpredictable. Their global performance deteriorated more with increasingly salient background deviants, where the buildup process was reset by the background distractor. Moreover, sequential predictability of the background deviant facilitated the recovery of the buildup process after attention capture. This is the first study that addresses the perceptual consequences of the joint effects of top-down and bottom-up attention in behaving animals."
https://openalex.org/W3039419359,"In 2017, India was home to nearly 20% of maternal and child deaths occurring globally. Accredited social health activists (ASHAs) act as the frontline for health services delivery in India, providing a range of reproductive, maternal, newborn, child health, and nutrition (RMNCH&N) services. Empirical evidence on ASHAs' knowledge is limited, yet is a critical determinant of the quality of health services provided. We assessed the determinants of RMNCH&N knowledge among ASHAs and examined the reliability of alternative modalities of survey delivery, including face-to-face and caller attended telephone interviews (phone surveys) in 4 districts of Madhya Pradesh, India.We carried out face-to-face surveys among a random cross-sectional sample of ASHAs (n = 1,552), and administered a follow-up test-retest survey within 2 weeks of the initial survey to a subsample of ASHAs (n = 173). We interviewed a separate sub-sample of ASHAs 2 weeks of the face-to-face interview over the phone (n = 155). Analyses included bivariate analyses, multivariable linear regression, and prevalence and bias adjusted kappa analyses.The average ASHA knowledge score was 64% and ranged across sub-domains from 71% for essential newborn care, 71% for WASH/ diarrhea, 64% for infant feeding, 61% for family planning, and 60% for maternal health. Leading determinants of knowledge included geographic location, age <30 years of age, education, experience as an ASHA, completion of seven or more client visits weekly, phone ownership and use as a communication tool for work, as well as the ability to navigate interactive voice response prompts (a measure of digital literacy). Efforts to develop a phone survey tool for measuring knowledge suggest that findings on inter-rater and inter-modal reliability were similar. Reliability was higher for shorter, widely known questions, including those about timing of exclusive breastfeeding or number of tetanus shots during pregnancy. Questions with lower reliability included those on sensitive topics such as family planning; questions with multiple response options; or which were difficult for the enumerator to convey.Overall results highlight important gaps in the knowledge of ASHAs. Findings on the reliability of phone surveys led to the development of a tool, which can be widely used for the routine, low cost measurement of ASHA RMNCH&N knowledge in India."
https://openalex.org/W3037058066,"Enteric nervous system (ENS) development is governed by interactions between neural crest cells (NCC) and the extracellular matrix (ECM). Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) results from incomplete NCC migration and failure to form an appropriate ENS. Prior studies implicate abnormal ECM in NCC migration failure. We performed a comparative microarray of the embryonic distal hindgut of wild-type and EdnrBNCC-/- mice that model HSCR and identified laminin-β1 as upregulated in EdnrBNCC-/- colon. We identified decreased expression of 37/67 kDa laminin receptor (LAMR), which binds laminin-β1, in human HSCR myenteric plexus and EdnrBNCC-/- NCC. Using a combination of in vitro gut slice cultures and ex vivo organ cultures, we determined the mechanistic role of LAMR in NCC migration. We found that enteric NCC express LAMR, which is downregulated in human and murine HSCR. Binding of LAMR by the laminin-β1 analog YIGSR promotes NCC migration. Silencing of LAMR abrogated these effects. Finally, applying YIGSR to E13.5 EdnrBNCC-/- colon explants resulted in 80%-100% colonization of the hindgut. This study adds LAMR to the large list of receptors through which NCC interact with their environment during ENS development. These results should be used to inform ongoing integrative, regenerative medicine approaches to HSCR."

Continuous thin layer sections were prepared from colonic tissue specimens and immunohistochemically stained for CD34 and CAM5.2. Three-dimensional reconstructed images were created by superimposing immunohistochemically stained pathological images. The endoscopic image with magnifying BLI was compared with the top view of the 3D reconstructed image to identify any one-to-one correspondence between the endoscopic images and histopathological images using the gland orifices and microvessels as a guide. Using 3D reconstructed pathological images, we were able to identify the location on the endoscope image in cases of colonic adenocarcinoma, adenoma and normal mucosa. As a result, the horizontal plane of the endoscopic image and the vertical plane of the 2D pathological specimen were able to be compared, and we successfully determined the visible blood vessel depth and performed a detailed evaluation on magnifying BLI. Examples are as follows: (1) The median vasculature depth from the mucosal surface that could be recognized as vasculature on magnifying BLI was 29.4 μm. The median depth of unrecognizable vessels on magnifying BLI was 218.8 μm, which was significantly deeper than recognizable vessels. (2) Some brownish structures were suggested to potentially be not only dense vessels, vessel expansions, corrupted vessels but also bleeding or extravasation of erythrocytes. Overall, we demonstrated a new approach to matching endoscopic images and pathological findings using a 3D-reconstructed pathological model immunohistochemically stained for CD34 and CAM5.2. This approach may increase the overall understanding of endoscopic images and positively contribute to making more accurate endoscopic diagnoses."
https://openalex.org/W3037356986,"Phoresy is a behavior in which an organism, the phoront, travels from one location to another by 'hitching a ride' on the body of a host as it disperses. Some phoronts are generalists, taking advantage of any available host. Others are specialists and travel only when specific hosts are located using chemical cues to identify and move (chemotax) toward the preferred host. Free-living nematodes, like Caenorhabditis elegans, are often found in natural environments that contain terrestrial isopods and other invertebrates. Additionally, the C. elegans wild strain PB306 was isolated associated with the isopod Porcellio scaber. However, it is currently unclear if C. elegans is a phoront of terrestrial isopods, and if so, whether it is a specialist, generalist, or developmental stage-specific combination of both strategies. Because the relevant chemical stimuli might be secreted compounds or volatile odorants, we used different types of chemotaxis assays across diverse extractions of compounds or odorants to test whether C. elegans is attracted to P. scaber. We show that two different strains–the wild isolate PB306 and the laboratory-adapted strain N2 –are not attracted to P. scaber during either the dauer or adult life stages. Our results indicate that C. elegans was not attracted to chemical compounds or volatile odorants from P. scaber, providing valuable empirical evidence to suggest that any associations between these two species are likely opportunistic rather than specific phoresy."
https://openalex.org/W3037903569,"Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a prevalent condition. Clinical diagnosis requires subjective evidence (i.e. symptoms) and objective evidence of inflammation (e.g. sinus computed tomography [CT]). Few studies have assessed differences in common CT scoring approaches for CRS, the Lund-Mackay (LM) system and its modified version (mLM); none in a general population sample. The aims of this study were to answer the following: (1) Is mLM superior to LM? (2) Should nasal cavity opacification be included in scoring? (3) How should location-specific scores be utilized? (4) If location-specific scores are summed, what should be the cutoff? (5) Are associations of opacification with symptoms observed when using different measurement approaches? We scored sinus CTs using LM and mLM from 526 subjects selected from a larger CRS study. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) assessed similarity of mLM and LM. Latent class analysis (LCA) identified subgroups of sinus opacification patterns. Factors associated with group membership and relations with nasal and sinus symptoms (NSS) guided clinical relevance. EFA suggested no differences between LM and mLM, or after addition of nasal cavity opacification. LCA identified three opacification groups: no/mild, localized, and diffuse. Males were 2.7x more likely to have diffuse opacification than females, as were those with asthma or hay fever. A LM cutoff of 3 had similar performance to the currently used 4. Diffuse opacification was associated with nasal blockage and smell loss. Differing patterns of opacification may be clinically relevant, improving measurement of objective evidence in studies of CRS and sinus diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3037001780,"Our previous studies suggest that physical activity (PA) levels are potentially regulated by endogenous metabolic mechanisms such as the vasodilatory roles of nitric oxide (NO) production via the precursor arginine (ARG) and ARG-related pathways. We assessed ARG metabolism and its precursors [citrulline (CIT), glutamine (GLN), glutamate (GLU), ornithine (ORN), and phenylalanine (PHE)] by measuring plasma concentration, whole-body production (WBP), de novo ARG and NO production, and clearance rates in previously classified low-active (LA) or high-active (HA) mice. We assessed LA (n = 23) and HA (n = 20) male mice by administering a stable isotope tracer pulse via jugular catheterization. We measured plasma enrichments via liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and body compostion by echo-MRI. WBP, clearance rates, and de novo ARG and NO were calculated. Compared to LA mice, HA mice had lower plasma concentrations of GLU (71.1%; 36.8 ± 2.9 vs. 17.5 ± 1.7μM; p<0.0001), CIT (21%; 57.3 ± 2.3 vs. 46.4 ± 1.5μM; p = 0.0003), and ORN (40.1%; 55.4 ± 7.3 vs. 36.9 ± 2.6μM; p = 0.0241), but no differences for GLN, PHE, and ARG. However, HA mice had higher estimated NO production ratio (0.64 ± 0.08; p = 0.0197), higher WBP for CIT (21.8%, 8.6 ± 0.2 vs. 10.7 ± 0.3 nmol/g-lbm/min; p<0.0001), ARG (21.4%, 35.0 ± 0.6 vs. 43.4 ± 0.7 nmol/g-lbm/min; p<0.0001), PHE (7.6%, 23.8 ± 0.5 vs. 25.6 ± 0.5 nmol/g-lbm/min; p<0.0100), and lower GLU (78.5%; 9.4 ± 1.1 vs. 4.1 ± 1.6 nmol/g lbm/min; p = 0.0161). We observed no significant differences in WBP for GLN, ORN, PHE, or de novo ARG. We concluded that HA mice have an activated whole-body ARG pathway, which may be associated with regulating PA levels via increased NO production."
https://openalex.org/W3037044933,"Proteins are covalently trapped on DNA to form DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) when cells are exposed to DNA-damaging agents. Aldehyde compounds produce common types of DPCs that contain proteins in an undisrupted DNA strand. Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) repairs topoisomerase 1 (TOPO1) that is trapped at the 3'-end of DNA. In the present study, we examined the contribution of TDP1 to the repair of formaldehyde-induced DPCs using a reverse genetic strategy with chicken DT40 cells. The results obtained showed that cells deficient in TDP1 were sensitive to formaldehyde. The removal of formaldehyde-induced DPCs was slower in tdp1-deficient cells than in wild type cells. We also found that formaldehyde did not produce trapped TOPO1, indicating that trapped TOPO1 was not a primary cytotoxic DNA lesion that was generated by formaldehyde and repaired by TDP1. The formaldehyde treatment resulted in the accumulation of chromosomal breakages that were more prominent in tdp1-deficient cells than in wild type cells. Therefore, TDP1 plays a critical role in the repair of formaldehyde-induced DPCs that are distinct from trapped TOPO1."
https://openalex.org/W3037843525,"The use of image covariates to build a classification model has lots of impact in various fields, such as computer science, medicine, and so on. The aim of this paper is to develop an estimation method for logistic regression model with image covariates. We propose a novel regularized estimation approach, where the regularization is a combination of L1 regularization and Sobolev norm regularization. The L1 penalty can perform variable selection, while the Sobolev norm penalty can capture the shape edges information of image data. We develop an efficient algorithm for the optimization problem. We also establish a nonasymptotic error bound on parameter estimation. Simulated studies and a real data application demonstrate that our proposed method performs very well."
https://openalex.org/W3039682380,"Chronic pain is a complex experience that has now become a major public health issue. This has prompted many researchers to study attention, understanding it to be a crucial factor that allows altering the experience of pain, while attributing considerable importance to sustained attention. Accordingly, the main studies in this field stress the importance of emotion regulation processes and emotions on the perception of painful stimuli and attentional processes themselves. Nevertheless, only a handful of studies have been found that directly study the relationship between these variables. Within this context, this article sets out to analyse emotional regulation processes, emotional variables (depression and anxiety), the experience of pain, and age on the ability to maintain the vigilance response in a sample of patients with chronic pain. This involved selecting a sample of 49 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and examining their performance in an ad-hoc sustained attention test. With a view to complying with the study's main purpose, the participants were also assessed through the use of the following self-report measures: the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-I); the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS); the McGill Pain Questionnaire, and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). Linear regression analyses revealed a significant impact of the aging process on the performance times in the attention task. Likewise, age and depression recorded a significant correlation with the mistakes made during the task. These results suggest that higher depression levels and an older age might be related to a worse adaptation to pain management techniques based on attention processes, such as mindfulness."
