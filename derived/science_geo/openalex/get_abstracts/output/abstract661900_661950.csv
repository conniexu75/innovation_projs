https://openalex.org/W3094505816,"A new future for polyethylene Most current plastic recycling involves chopping up the waste and repurposing it in materials with less stringent engineering requirements than the original application. Chemical decomposition at the molecular level could, in principle, lead to higher-value products. However, the carbon-carbon bonds in polyethylene, the most common plastic, tend to resist such approaches without exposure to high-pressure hydrogen. F. Zhang et al. now report that a platinum/alumina catalyst can transform waste polyethylene directly into long-chain alkylbenzenes, a feedstock for detergent manufacture, with no need for external hydrogen (see the Perspective by Weckhuysen).

https://openalex.org/W3094021184,"In December 2019, the first cases of infection with a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, were diagnosed. Currently, there is no effective antiviral treatment for COVID-19. To address this emerging problem, we focused on the SARS-CoV-2 main protease that constitutes one of the most attractive antiviral drug targets. We have synthesized a combinatorial library of fluorogenic substrates with glutamine in the P1 position. We used it to determine the substrate preferences of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 main proteases. On the basis of these findings, we designed and synthesized a potent SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor (Ac-Abu-dTyr-Leu-Gln-VS, half-maximal effective concentration of 3.7 µM) and two activity-based probes, for one of which we determined the crystal structure of its complex with the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. We visualized active SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells of patients suffering from COVID-19 infection. The results of our work provide a structural framework for the design of inhibitors as antiviral agents and/or diagnostic tests. Screening for substrate preference of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 main protease Mpro leads to the development of activity-based probes useful for structural analysis and for visualization of active Mpro in infected patient epithelial cells."

With the screen located some distance from the eye, the typical number of pixels per inch is in the region of hundreds. For near-eye microdisplays—for example, in virtual and augmented reality applications—the required pixel density runs to several thousand pixels per inch and cannot be met by present display technologies. Joo et al. developed a full-color, high-brightness OLED design based on an engineered metasurface as a tunable back-reflector. An ultrahigh density of 10,000 pixels per inch readily meets the requirements for the next-generation microdisplays that can be fabricated on glasses or contact lenses. Science , this issue p. 459"

https://openalex.org/W3094494543,"A ligand is located, at long last! Members of the Nod-like receptor (NLR) family act as intracellular sensors of infection. Once they recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns, they assemble into signaling complexes called inflammasomes, which induce proinflammatory cytokines and pyroptotic cell death. Although rodent NLR family pyrin domain containing 1 (NLRP1) can recognize bacterial toxins and protozoan pathogens, the ligands for human NLRP1 have remained elusive. Robinson et al. found that human NLRP1 senses and is activated by enteroviruses. During human rhinovirus (HRV) infection, the HRV 3C protease cleaves an autoinhibitory N-terminal fragment from NLRP1, which is subsequently degraded. The NLRP1 C-terminal fragment that is released then initiates inflammasome formation. This work offers insights into immune sensing of respiratory viral infections and provides an example of the N-terminal glycine degron pathway in human innate immunity.

https://openalex.org/W3094228332,"Colon mucus segregates the intestinal microbiota from host tissues, but how it organizes to function throughout the colon is unclear. In mice, we found that colon mucus consists of two distinct O-glycosylated entities of Muc2: a major form produced by the proximal colon, which encapsulates the fecal material including the microbiota, and a minor form derived from the distal colon, which adheres to the major form. The microbiota directs its own encapsulation by inducing Muc2 production from proximal colon goblet cells. In turn, O-glycans on proximal colon-derived Muc2 modulate the structure and function of the microbiota as well as transcription in the colon mucosa. Our work shows how proximal colon control of mucin production is an important element in the regulation of host-microbiota symbiosis."

https://openalex.org/W3094148346,"Microbial selection drives adaptation Many legumes have a host-symbiote relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, or rhizobia, that provides a benefit to both the plant and the microbe. Batstone et al. experimentally evolved the association between five legume accessions and different bacterial isolates. Rather than observe selection by the host for bacterial associations (host choice), mutations accumulated within a bacterial plasmid and increased the strength of the mutualism. Thus, local and recent associations between bacterial strains and plant genotypes are due to selection for bacterial adaptation. Science , this issue p. 476"
https://openalex.org/W3094116377,"Humans prioritize close, positive relationships during aging, and socioemotional selectivity theory proposes that this shift causally depends on capacities for thinking about personal future time horizons. To examine this theory, we tested for key elements of human social aging in longitudinal data on wild chimpanzees. Aging male chimpanzees have more mutual friendships characterized by high, equitable investment, whereas younger males have more one-sided relationships. Older males are more likely to be alone, but they also socialize more with important social partners. Further, males show a relative shift from more agonistic interactions to more positive, affiliative interactions over their life span. Our findings indicate that social selectivity can emerge in the absence of complex future-oriented cognition, and they provide an evolutionary context for patterns of social aging in humans."
https://openalex.org/W3094077549,"Using curves to make twists The growth of layered materials on flat substrates usually occurs in stacked layers, although defects or a lattice mismatch can induce strains that distort the shape of subsequent layers. However, these effects are usually small and can be uncontrolled. Zhao et al. now demonstrate the possibility of synthesizing multilayers of two-dimensional materials with certain twists between the layers induced by the presence of screw dislocations in combination with curved substrate surfaces. Different twist angles are achieved by varying the amount of nonplanarity and the character (conical or hyperbolic) of the surface. Science , this issue p. 442"
https://openalex.org/W3094350893,"Vertebrate sensory organs arise from epithelial thickenings called placodes. Along with neural crest cells, cranial placodes are considered ectodermal novelties that drove evolution of the vertebrate head. The anterior-most placode generates the endocrine lobe [adenohypophysis (ADH)] of the pituitary, a master gland controlling growth, metabolism, and reproduction. In addition to known ectodermal contributions, we use lineage tracing and time-lapse imaging in zebrafish to identify an endodermal contribution to the ADH. Single-cell RNA sequencing of the adult pituitary reveals similar competency of endodermal and ectodermal epithelia to generate all endocrine cell types. Further, endoderm can generate a rudimentary ADH-like structure in the near absence of ectodermal contributions. The fish condition supports the vertebrate pituitary arising through interactions of an ancestral endoderm-derived proto-pituitary with newly evolved placodal ectoderm."

Kishore et al. now follow the development of inhibitory interneurons as these circuits are assembled in the larva. Interneurons generated early in development drive different sorts of circuits and synapse onto different subcellular sections of the motor neurons than interneurons generated later in development. Thus, both rapid evasion and slower swimming are supported by the same cellular components assembled in different ways. The authors suggest that development follows an opportunistic rule in which interneurons synapse onto what is available to them at that moment in development. Science , this issue p. 431"
https://openalex.org/W3093915955,"The oncofetal long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) H19 is postnatally repressed in most tissues, and re-expressed in many cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The role of H19 in carcinogenesis is a subject of controversy. We aimed to examine the role of H19 in chronic inflammation-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis using the Mdr2/Abcb4 knockout (Mdr2-KO) mouse, a well-established HCC model. For this goal, we have generated Mdr2-KO/H19-KO double knockout (dKO) mice and followed spontaneous tumor development in the dKO and control Mdr2-KO mice. Cellular localization of H19 and effects of H19 loss in the liver were determined in young and old Mdr2-KO mice. Tumor incidence and tumor load were both significantly decreased in the liver of dKO versus Mdr2-KO females. The expression levels of H19 and Igf2 were variable in nontumor liver tissues of Mdr2-KO females and were significantly downregulated in most matched tumors. In nontumor liver tissue of aged Mdr2-KO females, H19 was expressed mainly in hepatocytes, and hepatocyte proliferation was increased compared to dKO females. At an early age, dKO females displayed lower levels of liver injury and B-cell infiltration, with higher percentage of binuclear hepatocytes. In human samples, H19 expression was higher in females, positively correlated with cirrhosis (in nontumor liver samples) and negatively correlated with CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) mutations and patients’ survival (in tumors). Our data demonstrate that the lncRNA H19 is pro-oncogenic during the development of chronic inflammation-mediated HCC in the Mdr2-KO mouse model, mainly by increasing liver injury and decreasing hepatocyte polyploidy in young mice."
https://openalex.org/W3094171143,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection leads to cancers with an epithelial origin, such as nasopharyngeal cancer and gastric cancer, as well as multiple blood cell-based malignant tumors, such as lymphoma. Interestingly, EBV is also the first virus found to carry genes encoding miRNAs. EBV encodes 25 types of pre-miRNAs which are finally processed into 44 mature miRNAs. Most EBV-encoded miRNAs were found to be involved in the occurrence and development of EBV-related tumors. However, the function of EBV-miR-BART12 remains unclear. The findings of the current study revealed that EBV-miR-BART12 binds to the 3'UTR region of Tubulin Polymerization-Promoting Protein 1 (TPPP1) mRNA and downregulates TPPP1, thereby promoting the invasion and migration of EBV-related cancers, such as nasopharyngeal cancer and gastric cancer. The mechanism underlying this process was found to be the inhibition of TPPP1 by EBV-miRNA-BART12, which, in turn, inhibits the acetylation of α-tubulin, and promotes the dynamic assembly of microtubules, remodels the cytoskeleton, and enhances the acetylation of β-catenin. β-catenin activates epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). These two processes synergistically promote the invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal the role of EBV-miRNA-BART12 in the development of EBV-related tumors as well as the mechanism underlying this process, and suggests potential targets and strategies for the treatment of EBV-related tumors."
https://openalex.org/W3093719983,"Smoking rates in the UK are at an all-time low but this masks considerable inequalities; prevalence amongst adults who are homeless remains four times higher than the national average. The objective of this trial was to assess the feasibility of supplying free e-cigarette starter kits to smokers accessing homeless centres and to estimate parameters to inform a possible future larger trial. In this feasibility cluster trial, four homeless centres in Great Britain were non-randomly allocated to either a Usual Care (UC) or E-Cigarette (EC) arm. Smokers attending the centres were recruited by staff. UC arm participants (N = 32) received advice to quit and signposting to the local Stop Smoking Service. EC arm participants (N = 48) received an EC starter kit and 4-weeks supply of e-liquid. Outcome measures were recruitment and retention rates, use of ECs, smoking cessation/reduction and completion of measures required for economic evaluation. Eighty (mean age 43 years; 65% male) of the 153 eligible participants who were invited to participate, were successfully recruited (52%) within a five-month period, and 47 (59%) of these were retained at 24 weeks. The EC intervention was well received with minimal negative effects and very few unintended consequences (e.g. lost, theft, adding illicit substances). In both study arm, depression and anxiety scores declined over the duration of the study. Substance dependence scores remained constant. Assuming those with missing follow up data were smoking, CO validated sustained abstinence at 24 weeks was 3/48 (6.25%) and 0/32 (0%) respectively for the EC and UC arms. Almost all participants present at follow-up visits completed data collection for healthcare service and health-related quality of life measures. Providing an e-cigarette starter kit to smokers experiencing homelessness was associated with reasonable recruitment and retention rates and promising evidence of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness."

Disease risk analysis (DRA) tools are designed to provide objective, repeatable and documented assessment of the disease risks for a population and measures to reduce these risks through management options. To the best of our knowledge, DRAs have not previously been published for sea turtles, although disease is reported to contribute to sea turtle population decline. Here, a comprehensive list of health hazards is provided for all seven species of sea turtles. The possible risk these hazards pose to the health of sea turtles were assessed and “One Health” aspects of interacting with sea turtles were also investigated. The risk assessment was undertaken in collaboration with more than 30 experts in the field including veterinarians, microbiologists, social scientists, epidemiologists and stakeholders, in the form of two international workshops and one local workshop. The general finding of the DRA was the distinct lack of knowledge regarding a link between the presence of pathogens and diseases manifestation in sea turtles. A higher rate of disease in immunocompromised individuals was repeatedly reported and a possible link between immunosuppression and environmental contaminants as a result of anthropogenic influences was suggested. Society based conservation initiatives and as a result the cultural and social aspect of interacting with sea turtles appeared to need more attention and research. A risk management workshop was carried out to acquire the insights of local policy makers about management options for the risks relevant to Queensland and the options were evaluated considering their feasibility and effectiveness. The sea turtle DRA presented here, is a structured guide for future risk assessments to be used in specific scenarios such as translocation and head-starting programs."
https://openalex.org/W3093596456,"In this paper, the interaction strategies and the evolutionary game analysis of the actions taken by the government and the public in the early days of the epidemic are incorporated into the natural transmission mechanism model of the epidemic, and then the transmission frequency equations of COVID-19 epidemic is established. According to the cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the UK and China, the upper limit of the spread of COVID-19 in different evolutionary scenarios is set. Using SPSS to perform logistic curve fitting, the frequency fitting equations of cumulative confirmed cases under different evolution scenarios are obtained respectively. The analysis result shows that the emergency response strategy adopted by the government in the early days of the epidemic can effectively control the spread of the epidemic. Combined with the transmission frequency equation of COVID-19 epidemic, measures taken by the government are analyzed. The influence of each measure on the frequency variable is judged and then the influence on the spread of the epidemic is obtained. Finally, based on the above analysis, the government is advised to adhere to the principles of scientific, initiative and flexibility when facing major epidemics."
https://openalex.org/W3094353521,"Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is a heterogeneous disorder associated with several genes. The majority of cases are still unsolved. Our aim was to identify the molecular diagnosis of a Brazilian cohort with POI. Genetic analysis was performed using a customized panel of targeted massively parallel sequencing (TMPS) and the candidate variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Additional copy number variation (CNV) analysis of TMPS samples was performed by CONTRA. Fifty women with POI (29 primary amenorrhea and 21 secondary amenorrhea) of unknown molecular diagnosis were included in this study, which was conducted in a tertiary referral center of clinical endocrinology. A genetic defect was obtained in 70% women with POI using the customized TMPS panel. Twenty-four pathogenic variants and two CNVs were found in 48% of POI women. Of these variants, 16 genes were identified as BMP8B, CPEB1, INSL3, MCM9, GDF9, UBR2, ATM, STAG3, BMP15, BMPR2, DAZL, PRDM1, FSHR, EIF4ENIF1, NOBOX, and GATA4. Moreover, a microdeletion and microduplication in the CPEB1 and SYCE1 genes, respectively, were also identified in two distinct patients. The genetic analysis of eleven patients was classified as variants of uncertain clinical significance whereas this group of patients harbored at least two variants in different genes. Thirteen patients had benign or no rare variants, and therefore the genetic etiology remained unclear. In conclusion, next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a highly effective approach to identify the genetic diagnoses of heterogenous disorders, such as POI. A molecular etiology allowed us to improve the disease knowledge, guide decisions about prevention or treatment, and allow familial counseling avoiding future comorbidities."

https://openalex.org/W3094516196,"This study aimed to investigate the relationship between serum zinc level and hepatic fibrosis in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). A cross-sectional study was conducted using nationally representative samples from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2010. Significant hepatic fibrosis was defined as Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index>1.3. Zinc level was measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess risk factors for significant hepatic fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. A total of 300 patients with NAFLD were analyzed in this study. The mean serum zinc level was 139.8±29.9 μg/dL. FIB-4 index was significantly increased as the serum zinc level decreased (Adjusted correlation coefficient = -0.177, p = 0.003). Significant liver fibrosis was observed in 62 patients (21%). The multivariable analysis showed that significant liver fibrosis in NAFLD was associated with diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR], 3.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.71-6.19; p<0.001), male (OR, 2.59; 95% CI, 1.31-5.12; p = 0.006), and zinc level <140 μg/dL (OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.16-3.94; p = 0.015). There was an inverse relationship between serum zinc level and FIB-4 index in NAFLD. Low levels of serum zinc were an independent risk factor for significant hepatic fibrosis in NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W3094201275,"Background Peritoneal dissemination (PD) frequently occurs in gastric cancer (GC) and is incurable. In this study, we aimed to identify novel PD-associated genes and clarify their clinical and biological significance in GC. Materials and methods We identified LOXL1 as a PD-associated candidate gene by in silico analysis of GC datasets (highly disseminated peritoneal GC cell line and two freely available GC datasets, GSE15459 and TCGA). Next, we evaluated the clinical significance of LOXL1 expression using RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry staining (IHC) in a validation cohort (Kyushu cohort). Moreover, we performed gene expression analysis, including gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) with GSE15459 and TCGA datasets. Finally, we performed a series of in vitro experiments using GC cells. Results In silico analysis showed that LOXL1 was overexpressed in tumor tissues of GC patients with PD and in highly disseminated peritoneal GC cells, relative to that in the control GC patients and cells, respectively. High expression of LOXL1 was a poor prognostic factor in the TCGA dataset. Next, IHC showed that LOXL1 was highly expressed in GC cells. High LOXL1 mRNA expression was associated with poorly differentiated histological type, lymph node metastasis, and was an independent poor prognostic factor in the Kyushu validation cohort. Moreover, LOXL1 expression was positively correlated with the EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) gene set in GSEA. Finally, LOXL1-overexpressing GC cells changed their morphology to a spindle-like form. LOXL1 overexpression reduced CDH1 expression; increased the expression of VIM, CDH2, SNAI2, and PLS3; and promoted the migration capacity of GC cells. Conclusions LOXL1 is associated with PD in GC, possibly through the induction of EMT."

Methods Participants were randomly selected from a diabetes outpatient facility (N = 216) and from among patients admitted to a medical center and psychiatric hospital (N = 99). The participants completed the PHQ-9. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview were used to identify the presence of psychiatric symptoms. The optimal cut-offs for PHQ-9 in people with and without type 2 diabetes were investigated based on two methods: 1) Youden’s index which identifies cut-off points useful in scientific research; 2) a second method of two-stage screening for depressive disorders to provide guidance for clinical practice. Results The Polish version of the PHQ-9 is a reliable and valid screening tool for depression in people with and without type 2 diabetes. An optimal cut-off of ≥ 7 was indicated by Youden’s index and ≥ 5 by the two-stage method for screening for MDD and ‘MDD and/or dysthymia’ in the group with type 2 diabetes. A cut-off of ≥ 11 was optimal for screening for both MDD and ‘MDD and/or dysthymia’ among people without diabetes (Youden’s index). The two-stage approach suggested a ≥ 10 score for screening for MDD and ≥ 9 for screening for ‘MDD and/or dysthymia’ in people without diabetes. Conclusions A lower cut-off score of the PHQ-9 is recommended for people with type 2 diabetes as compared to the general population.
https://openalex.org/W3094085763,"Objectives A growing number of Western studies have been exploring sustainable and healthy dietary patterns that target to reduce diet-related greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) and to achieve nutritional needs. However, research is limited among Asian populations, where food sources for diet-related GHGE differ from those in Western populations. This study aimed to investigate associations between diet-related GHGE and the prevalence of inadequate nutritional intake. Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out among 392 healthy Japanese volunteers aged 20–69 years. Dietary intake was assessed by four-non-consecutive day diet record. Diet-related GHGE was estimated using the Global Link Input-Output model and adjusted for energy intake by residual method. Prevalence of inadequacy was defined as a percentage of participants with nutrient intake outside the Tentative Dietary Goal for Preventing Lifestyle-Related Disease or below the Estimated Average Requirement defined by the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) for Japanese. The association between diet-related GHGE and the prevalence of inadequacy of the usual intake of each nutrient was examined using logistic regression models. Results Participants with higher diet-related GHGE had overall better adherence to the DRIs. Intakes of all selected nutrients were positively associated with diet-related GHGE, except for carbohydrate, total fat, and saturated fat. With increasing quartile of diet-related GHGE, the prevalence of inadequacy decreased for protein, dietary fiber, potassium, vitamins A, B-6, and C, thiamin, riboflavin, calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc, while that for sodium increased. Conclusions Diets with lower diet-related GHGE did not have better adherence to the DRIs compared to diets with higher diet-related GHGE among Japanese adults. Drastic dietary change or other strategies such as improving the food system would be needed to achieve a sustainable and healthy diet among Japanese."
https://openalex.org/W3094220369,"Na+ /H+ exchanger NHE3 of human or primates differs from NHE3 of other animals by having a PY motif, which mediates interaction with the E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase Nedd4-2. Ub-conjugation of human NHE3 by Nedd4-2 regulates endocytosis of NHE3 but does not affect its cellular expression. Because Ub-conjugation is a reversible process, the aim of this study is to identify deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) regulating the post-endosomal fate of human NHE3. Using an activity-based chemical screening, we identified ubiquitin specific protease-7 (USP7) and USP10 that bind NHE3. The roles of DUBs in regulation of NHE3 were studied by determining the effects of silencing of USP7 and USP10. Knockdown of USP7 or USP10 resulted in increased NHE3 ubiquitination and decreased NHE3 expression at the surface membrane and cellular level. The endocytic retrieval of NHE3 was promoted by depletion of USP7 or USP10, with increased association of NHE3 with Rab5a and Rab7. Inhibition of USP7 and USP10 by chemical inhibitors or knockdown had an additive effect on NHE3. In addition, NHE3 half-life was reduced accounting for decreased NHE3 protein abundance. NHE3 is inhibited by protein kinase A. Activation of PKA by forskolin decreased the binding of USP7 and USP10 to NHE3, while increasing ubiquitination of NHE3. Knockdown of USP10 had an additive effect on PKA-dependent inhibition of NHE3. These findings demonstrate that USP7 and USP10 are DUBs that regulate NHE3 ubiquitination and expression, and reveal a new mechanism of NHE3 inhibition involving DUBs."
https://openalex.org/W3094291959,"Background The environment in which a patient lives influences their health outcomes. However, the degree to which community factors are associated with readmissions is uncertain. Objective To estimate the influence of community factors on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services risk-standardized hospital-wide readmission measure (HWR)–a quality performance measure in the U.S. Research design We assessed 71 community variables in 6 domains related to health outcomes: clinical care; health behaviors; social and economic factors; the physical environment; demographics; and social capital. Subjects Medicare fee-for-service patients eligible for the HWR measure between July 2014-June 2015 (n = 6,790,723). Patients were linked to community variables using their 5-digit zip code of residence. Methods We used a random forest algorithm to rank variables for their importance in predicting HWR scores. Variables were entered into 6 domain-specific multivariable regression models in order of decreasing importance. Variables with P-values <0.10 were retained for a final model, after eliminating any that were collinear. Results Among 71 community variables, 19 were retained in the 6 domain models and in the final model. Domains which explained the most to least variance in HWR were: physical environment (R2 = 15%); clinical care (R2 = 12%); demographics (R2 = 11%); social and economic environment (R2 = 7%); health behaviors (R2 = 9%); and social capital (R2 = 8%). In the final model, the 19 variables explained more than a quarter of the variance in readmission rates (R2 = 27%). Conclusions Readmissions for a wide range of clinical conditions are influenced by factors relating to the communities in which patients reside. These findings can be used to target efforts to keep patients out of the hospital."
https://openalex.org/W3094104800,"The growth and differentiation of neurons are critical events in the establishment of proper neuron connectivity and function. Planarians have a remarkable ability to completely regenerate a functional nervous system from a pluripotent stem cell population. Thus, planarians provide a powerful model to identify genes required for neuronal differentiation in vivo. The Wnt/Ca2+ signaling pathway is crucial for cancer development, arousing inflammatory responses, and neurodegeneration. We analyzed the expression patterns and RNAi phenotypes for members of the Wnt/Ca2+ signaling pathway in the planarian, Dugesia japonica. The expression of DjWnt5a, DjPLC-β, DjCamKII, and DjCaln during regeneration was surprisingly similar and revealing in the regenerated brain. RNAi knockdown of DjWnt5a, DjPLC-β, DjCamKII, and DjCaln led to defects in regenerated brains including brain partial deletions, incompact phenotypes at the posterior of the new brain, and lateral branches, which could not regenerate. Furthermore, the expressions of GAD and the number of GABAergic neurons decreased. Together, these results suggest that the Wnt/Ca2+ signaling pathway is required for GABAergic neuron regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3094200335,"Third-variable effect refers to the effect transmitted by third-variables that intervene in the relationship between an exposure and a response variable. Third-variable effect analysis has been broadly studied in many fields. However, it remains a challenge for researchers to differentiate indirect effect of individual factor from multiple third-variables, especially when the involving variables are of hierarchical structure. Yu et al. (2014) defined third-variable effects that were consistent for all different types of response (categorical or continuous), exposure, or third-variables. With these definitions, multiple third-variables can be considered simultaneously, and the indirect effects carried by individual third-variables can be separated from the total effect. In this paper, we extend the definitions of third-variable effects to multilevel data structures, where multilevel additive models are adapted to model the variable relationships. And then third-variable effects can be estimated at different levels. Moreover, transformations on variables are allowed to present nonlinear relationships among variables. We compile an R package mlma, to carry out the proposed multilevel third-variable analysis. Simulations show that the proposed method can effectively differentiate and estimate third-variable effects from different levels. Further, we implement the method to explore the racial disparity in body mass index accounting for both environmental and individual level risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W3094346820,"Background/objectives Scalp melanoma is a subgroup of melanomas on the head and neck, historically associated with worst prognosis. Knowledge of the usual presentation of scalp melanoma can help to understand the reasons for the poor outcomes of treatment. This is the first publication to describe the clinical, histopathological and epidemiological profile of patients with scalp melanoma in a Latin American population. Methods A cross-sectional study was performed of all primary cutaneous melanoma seen by the A.C.Camargo Cancer Center between 2008 and 2018, using an electronic health records to access clinical and pathology data. Results When compared to trunk and limbs, increasing age is expected for patients with scalp melanoma (10.865; CI (95%) = [8.303; 13.427]). Regarding risk of invasion, scalp melanomas have a higher chance to be invasive than in situ (OR = 1.783; CI (95%) = [1.196; 2.657]) and present with higher Breslow thickness (OR = 3.005; CI (95%) = [2.507; 3.601]). Scalp site was significantly associated with male sex (OR = 3.750; CI (95%) = [2.533; 5.554]), perineural invasion (OR = 13.739; CI (95%) = [5.919; 31.895]), ulceration (OR = 2.311; CI (95%) = [1.488; 3.588]), and mitosis (OR = 2.366; CI (95%) = [1.701; 3.292]), when compared to trunk and limbs melanoma. Conclusion In the present study, head and neck melanomas represented 14.9% of all melanomas, a frequency slightly lower than that described in the literature and the mean age of melanoma on the scalp found was lower than that reported in the literature. These results could be explained by the demographic characteristics of Brazil, which has a population with a lower life expectancy compared to the European and North American population. Scalp melanomas occurred in older men, were diagnosed with greater Breslow thickness and were associated with the presence of perineural invasion, mitosis and ulceration."
https://openalex.org/W3093983048,"Background Onion is one of the most commonly used plants in the traditional medicine for the treatment of various diseases. We recently demonstrated the anti-inflammatory properties of onion bulb extract (OBE) in reducing colitis severity in mice when administered at the same time of colitis induction. However, whether onion can reverse established colitis or even prevent its development has not been investigated. Hypothesis To test 1. whether OBE can reduce colitis severity when given either before (preventative approach) or after (treatment approach) colitis induction and if so, 2. what are the mechanisms by which onion can achieve these effects. Methods Colitis was induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) administration using treatment and preventative approaches. The severity of the inflammation was determined by the gross and histological assessments. The colonic level/activity of pro-inflammatory molecules and immune cell markers was assessed by immunofluorescence and western blotting analysis. In vitro neutrophil superoxide release and survival was assessed by chemilumenecense and Annexin-V/7AAD assays respectively. Results OBE treatment significantly reduced colitis severity in both approaches, the colonic expression/activity profile of pro-inflammatory molecules, inhibited WKYMVm-induced superoxide release, and increased spontaneous apoptosis of neutrophils in vitro. Conclusions OBE can be used as an effective option in the prevention and/or the treatment of established colitis."
https://openalex.org/W3094063404,"Green lacewings (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) are key biological control agents found in a broad range of crops. Given the importance of enhancing their presence and conservation, in this study, we aim to identify and to determine the relative importance of the pollen consumed by Chrysoperla lucasina (Lacroix, 1936) from 29 pollen types offered by 51 native plant species sown in an experimental farm in Villarrubia in the south of Spain. For the purposes of this study, C. lucasina specimens were captured in the late spring of 2016 and 2017. The pollen types and other components in the alimentary canal of C. lucasina were microscopically identified using the transparency method, which is a novel technique applied to green lacewings captured in the field. The results show that (i) C. lucasina feeds on over half of the pollen types offered by the sown plant species, with no differences in behaviour by sex or year; (ii) Capsella bursa-pastoris was the most frequently identified pollen type in the alimentary canal; (iii) the majority of pollen types identified correspond to sown native plant species and not to surrounding plant species; and that (iv) most of the adults studied also consumed honeydew. Our feeding study has important implications for the selection of plant mixtures for ground cover restoration and flower vegetation strips in Mediterranean agroecosystems, which complements our previous findings on how C. lucasina use native plant species as host and reproduction sites. The plant species Capsella bursa-pastoris and Biscutella auriculata, which are best suited to provide pollen, host and reproduction sites for C. lucasina in late spring, should consequently be included in the proposed plant mixtures for Mediterranean agroecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W3094141692,"The use of statins in complicated pregnancy is being considered, as they protect endothelial function in the mother and placenta. However, whether statins affect cardiovascular function in the fetus is completely unknown. Here, we have determined the effects of pravastatin and underlying mechanisms on the cardiovascular system of the hypoxic chicken embryo, a model system that permits the direct effects of pravastatin on the developing offspring to be isolated independently of additional effects on the mother and/or placenta. Chicken embryos were incubated under normoxia or hypoxia (14% O2) from day 1 ± pravastatin (1 mg/kg/d) from day 13 of incubation (term is 21 days). On day 19 of incubation, hearts and vessels were isolated to determine changes in the cardiovascular structure and function. The data show that pravastatin protected the hypoxic chicken embryo against impaired cardiovascular dysfunction. Mechanisms involved in this protection included reduced oxidative stress, enhanced NO bioavailability, restored antioxidant defenses and normalized protein expression of RhoA in the embryonic heart, and improved NO-dependent vasodilator mechanisms in the peripheral circulation. Therefore, we show that the treatment of the chronically hypoxic chicken embryo with pravastatin from day 13 of incubation, equivalent to ca. 25 weeks of gestation in human pregnancy, has direct beneficial effects on the embryonic cardiovascular system. Therefore, pravastatin may be a candidate for human clinical translation to rescue fetal cardiovascular dysfunction in risky pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W3093659598,"Mutualistic plant-pollinator interactions are critical for the functioning of both non-managed and agricultural systems. Mathematical models of plant-pollinator interactions can help understand key determinants in pollination success. However, most previous models have not addressed pollinator behavior and plant biology combined. Information generated from such a model can inform optimal design of crop orchards and effective utilization of managed pollinators like western honey bees (Apis mellifera), and help generate hypotheses about the effects of management practices and cultivar selection. We expect that the number of honey bees per flower and male to female flower ratio will influence fruit yield. To test the relative importance of these effects, both singly and simultaneously, we utilized a delay differential equation model combined with Latin hypercube sampling for sensitivity analysis. Empirical data obtained from historical records and collected in kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis) orchards in New Zealand were used to parameterize the model. We found that, at realistic bee densities, the optimal orchard had 65-75% female flowers, and the most benefit was gained from the first 6-8 bees/1000 flowers, with diminishing returns thereafter. While bee density significantly impacted fruit production, plant-based parameters-flower density and male:female flower ratio-were the most influential. The predictive model provides strategies for improving crop management, such as choosing cultivars which have their peak bloom on the same day, increasing the number of flowers with approximately 70% female flowers in the orchard, and placing enough hives to maintain more than 6 bees per 1000 flowers to optimize yield."
https://openalex.org/W3093962128,"Recently, the Cancer Genome Atlas and Asian Cancer Research Group propose two new classifications system of gastric cancer by using multi-platforms of molecular analyses. However, these highly complicated and cost technologies have not yet been translated into full clinical utility. In addition, the clinicians are expected to gain more guidance of treatment for different molecular subtypes. In this study, we developed a panel of gastric cancer patients in population from Southern China using commercially accessible TMA and immunohistochemical technology. A cohort of 259 GC patients was classified into 4 subtypes on the basis of expression of mismatch repair proteins (PMS2, MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6), E-cadherin and p21 protein. We observed that the subtypes presented distinct prognosis. dMMR-like subtype was associated with the best prognosis, and E-cadherin-a subtype was associated with the worst prognosis. Patients with p21-High and p21-Ligh subtypes had intermediate overall survival. In multivariate analysis, the dMMR-like subtype remained an independent prediction power for overall survival in the model. We described a molecular classification of gastric cancers using clinically applicable assay. The biological relevance of the four subtypes was illustrated by significant differences in prognosis. Our molecular classification provided an effective and inexpensive screening tool for improving prognostic models. Nevertheless, our study should be considered preliminary and carries a limited predictive value as a single-center retrospective study."
https://openalex.org/W3093526298,"We present a method for assembling directed networks given a prescribed bi-degree (in- and out-degree) sequence. This method utilises permutations of initial adjacency matrix assemblies that conform to the prescribed in-degree sequence, yet violate the given out-degree sequence. It combines directed edge-swapping and constrained Monte-Carlo edge-mixing for improving approximations to the given out-degree sequence until it is exactly matched. Our method permits inclusion or exclusion of ‘multi-edges’, allowing assembly of weighted or binary networks. It further allows prescribing the overall percentage of such multiple connections—permitting exploration of a weighted synthetic network space unlike any other method currently available for comparison of real-world networks with controlled multi-edge proportion null spaces. The graph space is sampled by the method non-uniformly, yet the algorithm provides weightings for the sample space across all possible realisations allowing computation of statistical averages of network metrics as if they were sampled uniformly. Given a sequence of in- and out- degrees, the method can also produce simple graphs for sequences that satisfy conditions of graphicality. Our method successfully builds networks with order O(107) edges on the scale of minutes with a laptop running Matlab. We provide our implementation of the method on the GitHub repository for immediate use by the research community, and demonstrate its application to three real-world networks for null-space comparisons as well as the study of dynamics of neuronal networks."
https://openalex.org/W3093974750,"Aim Clinical guidelines recommend non-surgical treatment before surgery is considered in patients eligible for knee replacement. Surgical treatment is provided by orthopedic surgeons and exercise therapy is provided by physical therapists. The aim of this study was to identify perceived facilitators and barriers-among orthopedic surgeons and physical therapists-towards coordinated non-surgical and surgical treatment of patients eligible for knee replacement using pre-operative home-based exercise therapy with one exercise. Methods This qualitative study is embedded within the QUADX-1 randomized trial that investigates a model of coordinated non-surgical and surgical treatment for patients eligible for knee replacement. Physical therapists and orthopedic surgeons working with patients with knee osteoarthritis in their daily clinical work were interviewed (one focus group and four single interviews) to explore their perceived facilitators and barriers related to pre-operative home-based exercise therapy with one exercise-only in patients eligible for knee replacement. Interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results From the thematic analysis three main themes emerged: 1) Physical therapists' dilemma with one home-based exercise, 2) Orthopedic surgeons' dilemma with exercise, and 3) Coordinated non-surgical and surgical care. Conclusion We found that the pre-operative exercise intervention created ambivalence in the professional role of both the physical therapists and orthopedic surgeons. The physical therapists were skeptical towards over-simplified exercise therapy. The orthopedic surgeons were skeptical towards the potential lack of (long-term) effect of exercise therapy in patients eligible for knee replacement. The consequence of these barriers and ambivalence in the professional role is important to consider when planning implementation of the model of coordinated non-surgical and surgical treatment.

https://openalex.org/W3094290714,"This study addresses the pressing issue of how to raise the performance of disadvantaged students in mathematics. We combined established findings on effective instruction with emerging research addressing the specific needs of disadvantaged students. A sample of N = 260 disadvantaged 6th-graders received 4 weeks (15 lessons) of fraction instruction either as usual or evidence-based instruction, with and without digital learning support (i.e., interactivity, adaptivity, and immediate explanatory feedback). To examine the sustainability of effects, we assessed students’ fraction knowledge immediately after the 4 weeks and once again after a period of additional 8 weeks. Generalized linear mixed models revealed that students only benefitted from evidence-based instruction if digital support was available in addition. Digital support principles implemented in evidence-based instruction helped disadvantaged students to acquire mathematics knowledge—and to maintain this knowledge."
https://openalex.org/W3094385804,"Objectives To determine if the URO-MCP-1 mouse model for bladder IC/BPS is associated with in vivo bladder hyper-permeability, as measured by contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI), and assess whether molecular-targeted MRI (mt-MRI) can visualize in vivo claudin-2 expression as a result of bladder hyper-permeability. Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is a chronic, painful condition of the bladder that affects primarily women. It is known that permeability plays a substantial role in IC/BPS. Claudins are tight junction membrane proteins that are expressed in epithelia and endothelia and form paracellular barriers and pores that determine tight junction permeability. Claudin-2 is a molecular marker that is associated with increased hyperpermeability in the urothelium. Materials and methods CE-MRI was used to measure bladder hyper-permeability in the URO-MCP-1 mice. A claudin-2-specific mt-MRI probe was used to assess in vivo levels of claudin-2. The mt-MRI probe consists of an antibody against claudin-2 conjugated to albumin that had Gd-DTPA (gadolinium diethylenetriamine pentaacetate) and biotin attached. Verification of the presence of the mt-MRI probe was done by targeting the biotin moiety for the probe with streptavidin-horse radish peroxidase (SA-HRP). Trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was also used to assess bladder permeability. Results The URO-MCP-1 mouse model for IC/BPS was found to have a significant increase in bladder permeability, following liposaccharide (LPS) exposure, compared to saline-treated controls. mt-MRI- and histologically-detectable levels of the claudin-2 probe were found to increase with LPS -induced bladder urothelial hyper-permeability in the URO-MCP-1 IC mouse model. Levels of protein expression for claudin-2 were confirmed with immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence imaging. Claudin-2 was also found to highly co-localize with zonula occlidens-1 (ZO-1), a tight junction protein. Conclusion The combination of CE-MRI and TEER approaches were able to demonstrate hyper-permeability, a known feature associated with some IC/BPS patients, in the LPS-exposed URO-MCP-1 mouse model. This MRI approach could be clinically translated to establish which IC/BPS patients have bladder hyper-permeability and help determine therapeutic options. In addition, the in vivo molecular-targeted imaging approach can provide invaluable information to enhance our understanding associated with bladder urothelium hyper-permeability in IC/BPS patients, and perhaps be used to assist in developing further therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3094487348,"Mitochondrial swelling is involved in the pathogenesis of many human diseases associated with oxidative stress including obesity. One of the strategies for prevention of deleterious effects related to obesity and overweight is engaging in regular physical activity, of which high intensity interval training (HIIT) is efficient in promoting biogenesis and improving the function of mitochondria. Therefore, our aims were to investigate the effects of HIIT on metabolic and neuro-cardiovascular dynamic control and mitochondrial swelling induced by high-fat diet (HFD).Twenty-three male Wistar rats (60 - 80g) were divided into 4 subgroups: control (C), HIIT, HFD and HFD+HIIT. The whole experimentation period lasted for 22 weeks and HIIT sessions were performed 5 days a week during the last 4 weeks. At the end of the experiments, fasting glucose and insulin tolerance tests were performed. Cerebral microcirculation was analyzed using cortical intravital microscopy for capillary diameter and functional density. Cardiac function and ergoespirometric parameters were also investigated. Mitochondrial swelling was evaluated on brain and heart extracts. HFD promoted an increase on body adiposity (p<0.001), fasting glucose levels (p<0.001), insulin resistance index (p<0.05), cardiac hypertrophy index (p<0.05) and diastolic blood pressure (p<0.05), along with worsened cardiac function (p<0.05), reduced functional cerebral capillary density (p<0.05) and its diameter (p<0.01), and heart and brain mitochondrial function (p<0.001). HFD did not affect any ergoespirometric parameter. After 4 weeks of training, HIIT was able to improve cardiac hypertrophy index, diastolic blood pressure, cerebral functional capillary density (p<0.01) and heart and brain mitochondrial swelling (p<0.001).In animals subjected to HFD, HIIT ameliorated both cerebral mitochondrial swelling and functional capillary density, but it did not improve cardiovascular function suggesting that the cardiovascular dysfunction elicited by HFD was not due to heart mitochondrial swelling."
https://openalex.org/W3011729642,"Recent developments in high-throughput methods have resulted in the collection of high-dimensional data types from multiple sources and technologies that measure distinct yet complementary information. Integrated clustering of such multiple data types or multi-view clustering is critical for revealing pathological insights. However, multi-view clustering is challenging due to the complex dependence structure between multiple data types, including directional dependency. Specifically, genomics data types have pre-specified directional dependencies known as the central dogma that describes the process of information flow from DNA to messenger RNA (mRNA) and then from mRNA to protein. Most of the existing multi-view clustering approaches assume an independent structure or pair-wise (non-directional) dependence between data types, thereby ignoring their directional relationship. Motivated by this, we propose a biology-inspired Bayesian integrated multi-view clustering model that uses an asymmetric copula to accommodate the directional dependencies between the data types. Via extensive simulation experiments, we demonstrate the negative impact of ignoring directional dependency on clustering performance. We also present an application of our model to a real-world dataset of breast cancer tumor samples collected from The Cancer Genome Altas program and provide comparative results."

https://openalex.org/W3093881605,"The present research aims at quantifying the impact of practicing a new coordination pattern with an online visual feedback on the postural coordination performed on a mechanical horse. Forty-four voluntary participants were recruited in this study. They were randomly assigned to four practice groups based on i) with or without feedback (i.e., group 1, control, did not receive the feedback; group 2, 3 and 4 received an online feedback during practice) and ii) the specific trunk/horse coordination to target during practice (group 1, target coordination = 180° (without feedback); group 2, target coordination = 0°; group 3, target coordination = 90°; group 4, target coordination = 180°). All participants performed pre-, practice, post- and retention sessions. The pre-, post- and retention sessions consisted of four trials, with one trial corresponding to one specific target coordination to maintain between their own oscillations and the horse oscillations (spontaneous, 0°, 90°, and 180°). The practice phase was composed of three different sessions during which participants received an online feedback about the coordination between their own oscillations and the horse oscillations. Results showed a significant change with practice in the trunk/horse coordination patterns which persisted even after one month (retention-test). However, all the groups did not show the same nature of change, evidenced by a high postural variability during post-test for 0° and 90° target coordination groups, in opposition to the 180° and spontaneous groups who showed a decrease in coordination variability for the 180° group. The coordination in anti-phase was characterized as spontaneously adopted by participants on the mechanical horse, explaining the ease of performing this coordination (compared to the 0° and 90° target coordination). The effect of online visual feedback appeared not only on the coordination pattern itself, but most importantly on its variability during practice, including concerning initially stable coordination patterns."
https://openalex.org/W3094097456,"The year is 2022. It is a warm summer day in Boston, and Naomi, an incoming graduate student, sits in a cafe waiting for two colleagues who have greatly influenced her career—although they've never met in person. It was back in 2020 when Naomi, then an undergraduate at Howard University, spent a summer working virtually with Matthias, a postdoc, and Maha, the lab principal investigator, through a Harvard University internship program. Now that the world has managed COVID-19, they are excited to finally meet face-to-face and reflect on that summer experience.



> “With a little work, we formed a lasting bond.” 

NAOMI: I remember that day in March 2020 when everything seemed to unravel. I was told to evacuate my campus and that classes would be virtual for the indefinite future. While many of my peers' summer research opportunities were canceled, I was lucky that the Harvard summer internship was scheduled to continue virtually. But I wondered how I would learn a completely new topic and research style from 3000 kilometers and two time zones away. How would I form a relationship with my mentors?

MATTHIAS: Both Maha and I had doubts about the virtual internship format. I had never mentored a student completely remotely, and I knew you had never done this type of research before. I counted on Maha's experience mentoring students and her optimism that we would make it work.

NAOMI: The biggest challenge for me was not knowing whether I was on track. If we had been working together in person, it would have been easy to casually touch base and get gentle nudges in the right direction when I needed them. But I was too nervous to ask basic questions over video calls and chat, so I relied on trial and error and online tutorials. Then, when I presented my work to you, I was disappointed to learn that the model I had worked on for 2 weeks was completely wrong.

MAHA: I remember that moment well. It became clear then that we needed to reset our expectations and how we communicated. I urged you to use chat liberally and reach out for more frequent short check-ins. As the days rolled on, you seemed to become more at ease asking for help.

NAOMI: It certainly helped that you were present and responsive via telephone calls and chat. I also learned the importance of making my concerns heard. And when we began to speak more often, I got to see another side of your lives. I never expected to have video calls with Matthias while he was at the playground with his kids!

MATTHIAS: Me neither! Do you remember when my daughter poured water on my laptop? It delayed me terribly in sending over a key figure for your final presentation. I was balancing so much at the time and yet desperately wanted to be there when you needed me.

NAOMI: Yes, that wasn't the smoothest moment—but ultimately it only strengthened our relationship. Seeing your struggles with working from home helped me realize that we are all human, navigating through a difficult time together.

MATTHIAS: I enjoyed connecting with you informally; it felt very genuine. It also offered an opportunity to reflect on what kind of mentor I want to be in the “real” world. I hope to carry that forward with me.

MAHA: Losing the connection with mentees was among the hardest aspects of the quarantine for me professionally. Shifting to a more relaxed communication style really helped. It also reinforced my belief that science and scientists should be less aloof and more welcoming, especially to aspiring scientists early in their careers.

NAOMI: The virtual environment made it hard to connect at times—but with a little work, we formed a lasting bond."
https://openalex.org/W3094606009,"We have been using the Inbred Long- and Short-Sleep mouse strains (ILS, ISS) and a recombinant inbred panel derived from them, the LXS, to investigate the genetic underpinnings of acute ethanol tolerance which is considered to be a risk factor for alcohol use disorders (AUDs). Here, we have used RNA-seq to examine the transcriptome of whole brain in 40 of the LXS strains 8 hours after a saline or ethanol as in previous behavioral studies. Approximately 1/3 of the 14,184 expressed genes were significantly heritable and many were unique to the pretreatment. Several thousand cis- and trans-eQTLs were mapped; a portion of these also were unique to pretreatment. Ethanol pretreatment caused differential expression (DE) of 1,230 genes. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis suggested involvement in numerous biological processes including astrocyte differentiation, histone acetylation, mRNA splicing, and neuron projection development. Genetic correlation analysis identified hundreds of genes that were correlated to the behaviors. GO analysis indicated that these genes are involved in gene expression, chromosome organization, and protein transport, among others. The expression profiles of the DE genes and genes correlated to AFT in the ethanol pretreatment group (AFT-Et) were found to be similar to profiles of HDAC inhibitors. Hdac1, a cis-regulated gene that is located at the peak of a previously mapped QTL for AFT-Et, was correlated to 437 genes, most of which were also correlated to AFT-Et. GO analysis of these genes identified several enriched biological process terms including neuron-neuron synaptic transmission and potassium transport. In summary, the results suggest widespread genetic effects on gene expression, including effects that are pretreatment-specific. A number of candidate genes and biological functions were identified that could be mediating the behavioral responses. The most prominent of these was Hdac1 which may be regulating genes associated with glutamatergic signaling and potassium conductance."
