https://openalex.org/W2841775729,"Challenges exist in recruiting an international sample of clinicians and researchers to an online survey. Traditional recruitment methods remain relevant but issues such as narrow geographical reach, high cost and time intensity limit what can be achieved when aiming to recruit an international, multi-disciplinary sample. Internet-mediated and social media approaches to recruitment and engagement offer new, untested ways of capitalizing upon existing professional networks.To develop, use and appraise a multi-modal recruitment strategy for an online, international survey regarding the management of shoulder pain.Traditional recruitment methods were combined with internet-mediated recruitment methods to form a multi-modal recruitment strategy. An overview of the development of this three-month recruitment strategy is provided and the value and role of each strand of the recruitment strategy discussed.In response to the multi-modal recruitment strategy, data was received from 565 clinicians and researchers from 31 countries (64% UK). Complete data was received from 387 respondents with no demographic differences between respondents who completed, and those who started but did not complete the survey. Over 30% of responses were received within 1 week, 50% within 4 weeks and 81% within 8 weeks.This study shows the acceptability and international, multidisciplinary reach of a low cost multi-modal recruitment strategy for an online survey of international clinicians and researchers. Incorporating the use of social media proved to be an effective, time and resource-efficient recruitment strategy for this online survey and appeared to enhance clinician engagement. A multimodal recruitment strategy is worthy of consideration for future online surveys of clinicians and researchers."
https://openalex.org/W2859691308,"In agricultural landscapes honeybees and other pollinators are exposed to pesticides, often surveyed by residue analysis of bee bread. However, bee bread is a mixture of pollen pellets of different plants collected over a longer time period. Therefore, pesticide content in the hive varies with plant species and time of pollen collection. Hence, the analysis of bee bread is an approximate approach to gain information on detailed pesticide exposure during the agronomic active season. As high-resolution data is missing, we carried out a pesticide residue survey over five years (2012–2016) of daily collected pollen pellets at three agricultural distinct sites in southern Germany. 281 single day pollen samples were selected and subjected to a multi-pesticide residue analysis. Pesticide contaminations of pollen differed between the sites. Intensive pesticide exposure can be seen by high pesticide concentrations as well as a high amount of different pesticides detected. During the five years of observation 73 different pesticides were found, of which 84% are characterized as non-harmful to honeybees. To estimate pesticide risks for honeybees, the pollen hazard quotient (PHQ) was calculated. Even though pesticides were detected in sublethal concentrations, we found substances not supposed to be exposed to honey bees, indicating the necessity for further improvement of seed treatments and increasing awareness of flowering shrubs, field margins and pesticide drift. Additionally, an in-depth analysis of nine pollen samples, divided into sub-fractions dominated by single plant species, revealed even higher concentrations in single crops for some pesticides. We give precise residue data of 1,657 single pesticide detections, which should be used for realistic laboratory and field tests."

https://openalex.org/W2873423843,"Intestinal epithelial cells are multi-tasked cells that participate in digestion and absorption as well as in protection of the digestive tract. While information on the physiology and immune functions of intestinal epithelial cells in mammals is abundant, little is known of their immune function in birds and other species. Our main objectives were to study the development of anti-bacterial innate immune functions in the rapidly developing gut of the pre- and post-hatch chick and to determine the functional diversity of epithelial cells. After establishing primary intestinal epithelial cell cultures, we demonstrated their capacity to uptake and process bacteria. The response to bacterial products, LPS and LTA, induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes (IL-6, IL-18) as well as the expression of the acute phase proteins avidin, lysozyme and the secretory component derived from the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor. These proteins were then localized in gut sections, and the goblet cell was shown to store avidin, lysozyme as well as secretory component. Lysozyme staining was also located in a novel rod-shaped intestinal cell, situated at different loci along the villus, thus deviating from the classical Paneth cell in the mammal, that is restricted to crypts. Thus, in the chicken, the intestinal epithelium, and particularly goblet cells, are committed to innate immune protection. The unique role of the goblet cell in chicken intestinal immunity, as well as the unique distribution of lysozyme-positive cells highlight alternative solutions of gut protection in the bird."
https://openalex.org/W2848366362,"Despite an overwhelming scientific consensus, a sizable minority of people doubt that human activity is causing climate change. Communicating the existence of a scientific consensus has been suggested as a way to correct individuals' misperceptions about human-caused climate change and other scientific issues, though empirical support is mixed. We report an experiment in which psychology students were presented with consensus information about two issues, and subsequently reported their perception of the level of consensus and extent of their endorsement of those issues. We find that messages about scientific consensus on the reality of anthropogenic climate change and the safety of genetically modified food shift perceptions of scientific consensus. Using mediation models we also show that, for both these issues, high consensus messages also increase reported personal agreement with the scientific consensus, mediated by changes in perceptions of a scientific consensus. This confirms the role of perceived consensus in informing personal beliefs about climate change, though results indicate the impact of single, one-off messages may be limited."
https://openalex.org/W2811254217,"Derivation of functional skeletal muscle stem cells from pluripotent cells without genetic modification has proven elusive. Here we show that teratomas formed in adult skeletal muscle differentiate in vivo to produce large numbers of α7-Integrin+ VCAM-1+ myogenic progenitors. When FACS-purified and transplanted into diseased muscles, mouse teratoma-derived myogenic progenitors demonstrate very high engraftment potential. As few as 40,000 cells can reconstitute ∼80% of the tibialis anterior muscle volume. Newly generated fibers are innervated, express adult myosins, and ameliorate dystrophy-related force deficit and fatigability. Teratoma-derived myogenic progenitors also contribute quiescent PAX7+ muscle stem cells, enabling long-term maintenance of regenerated muscle and allowing muscle regeneration in response to subsequent injuries. Transcriptional profiling reveals that teratoma-derived myogenic progenitors undergo embryonic-to-adult maturation when they contribute to the stem cell compartment of regenerated muscle. Thus, teratomas are a rich and accessible source of potent transplantable skeletal muscle stem cells. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W2823527536,"Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are noncoding RNAs that guide chemical modifications of structural RNAs. Whereas snoRNAs primarily localize in the nucleolus, where their canonical function is to target nascent ribosomal RNAs for 2′-O-methylation, recent studies provide evidence that snoRNAs traffic out of the nucleus. Furthermore, RNA-Seq data indicate that extracellular vesicles released from cells contain snoRNAs. However, it is not known whether snoRNA secretion is regulated or whether secreted snoRNAs are functional. Here, we show that inflammation stimulates secretion of Rpl13a snoRNAs U32a (SNORD32a), U33 (SNORD33), U34 (SNORD34), and U35a (SNORD35a) from cultured macrophages, in mice, and in human subjects. Secreted snoRNAs co-fractionate with extracellular vesicles and are taken up by recipient cells. In a murine parabiosis model, we demonstrate that snoRNAs travel through the circulation to function in distant tissues. These findings support a previously unappreciated link between inflammation and snoRNA secretion in mice and humans and uncover a potential role for secreted snoRNAs in cell–cell communication.

https://openalex.org/W2839949610,"It remains unclear whether PAX6 acts as a crucial transcription factor for lung cancer stem cell (CSC) traits. We demonstrate that PAX6 acts as an oncogene responsible for induction of cancer stemness properties in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Mechanistically, PAX6 promotes GLI transcription, resulting in SOX2 upregulation directly by the binding of GLI to the proximal promoter region of the SOX2 gene. The overexpressed SOX2 enhances the expression of key pluripotent factors (OCT4 and NANOG) and suppresses differentiation lineage factors (HOPX and NKX2-1), driving cancer cells toward a stem-like state. In contrast, in the differentiated non-CSCs, PAX6 is transcriptionally silenced by its promoter methylation. In human lung cancer tissues, the positive linear correlations of PAX6 expression with GLI and SOX2 expression and its negative correlations with HOPX and NKX2-1 expression were observed. Therapeutically, the blockade of the PAX6-GLI-SOX2 signaling axis elicits a long-lasting therapeutic efficacy by limiting CSC expansion following chemotherapy. Furthermore, a methylation panel including the PAX6 gene yielded a sensitivity of 79.1% and specificity of 83.3% for cancer detection using serum DNA from stage IA LUAD. Our findings provide a rationale for targeting the PAX6-GLI-SOX2 signaling axis with chemotherapy as an effective therapeutic strategy and support the clinical utility of PAX6 gene promoter methylation as a biomarker for early lung cancer detection."
https://openalex.org/W2857487573,"Background Using salivary microbiota as an accurate proxy for monitoring supragingival microbiota remains controversial because their relationship remains unclear. The eruption of permanent teeth and the exfoliation of primary teeth in mixed dentition greatly alter microbial habitats, which may cause compositional shifts of oral microbiota from childhood to adults. Objective This study’s purpose was to assess whether saliva represents a suitable sample for monitoring supragingival microbiota in healthy people, and to explore how the replacement process of deciduous teeth with permanent teeth in mixed dentition influences microbiota within the oral cavity. Design Samples of saliva and of supragingival plaque from permanent and deciduous teeth were collected separately from 20 healthy children with mixed dentition. To characterize their microbial communities, we used the V3–V4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequence. Results Saliva harbored a less even and less diverse community than did the plaque. Discriminating genera, namely Rothia and Streptococcus, contributed to the saliva and plaque differentiation. About half of predicted KEGG pathways varied between the plaque and saliva communities. Oral bacteria showed significantly associations between their supragingival and salivary states. We identified 20 supragingival plaque-related genera in saliva, such as Corynebacterium, Capnocytophaga, Fusobacterium, and Neisseria. Additionally, the relative abundance of Actinobacteria peaked in the permanent teeth plaque but subsided in deciduous teeth plaque and saliva. The exfoliation of deciduous teeth and eruption of permanent teeth might be related to the reported fluctuation in the relative abundance of Actinobacteria from primary dentition to permanent dentition within the oral cavity. The variation between PT and DT was due mainly to permanent teeth being enriched in Actinomyces and deciduous teeth in Treponema. Conclusion These results suggested that the supragingival plaque-related bacteria could be suitable candidates when sampling saliva for monitoring supragingival microbiota. The replacement process of deciduous teeth with permanent teeth in mixed dentition might be related to the reported age-maturation of phylum Actinobacteria in the oral cavity."
https://openalex.org/W2871823601,"Pollination by bees improves agricultural crop yields and improves the financial outlook of beekeepers because it increases honey production and hive rental revenues. However, in Brazil, with a few exceptions, these benefits have been neglected in recent years because beekeepers are more interested in honey production than in agricultural pollination. The excessive and indiscriminate use of insecticides on agricultural fields in Brazil appears to be one of the principal obstacles preventing partnership between farmers and beekeepers. The goal of this study was therefore to evaluate the most recent situation in Brazil in relation to the use of insecticides, agriculture and to honey production in comparison with other countries. Our results show that Brazil is the largest consumer of insecticides in the world and that consumption has increased by > 150% over 15 years. While countries with a high Human Development Index (i.e., a measure that can also be used to question national policy choices) are reducing their levels of insecticide use in agriculture, Brazil is going in the opposite direction. It is highly likely the increase seen in other countries is a result of alternative methods for pest control rather than a result of the amount of area under agricultural cultivation and their capability to shift their economies from agriculture to other sectors. The number of hives (23%) and the volume of honey production (72%) in Brazil have, however, increased over the same period, raising Brazil to the ninth highest honey producer in the world. Although the data on apiculture are promising, the growth in use of insecticides in Brazil is a cause for concern because they leave residuals on bee products, on crops, and in the environment. Civil society and government in Brazil should encourage reductions in insecticide use and better relations between agricultural farmers and beekeepers."
https://openalex.org/W2829883424,"We aimed to assess the correlations among multiple cytokine concentrations in the maternal plasma, cervicovaginal fluid (CVF), and amniotic fluid (AF) compartments in women with preterm premature rupture of membranes (pPROM), and to develop a prediction model based on non-invasive measures, having better sensitivity and specificity for the identification of microbial invasion of amniotic cavity (MIAC).This retrospective study included 75 consecutive women with pPROM (20+0-34+0 weeks), who underwent amniocentesis. Both maternal plasma and CVF samples were collected at the time of amniocentesis. Stored AF, plasma and CVF samples were assayed for cytokine levels [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, MIP-1β] using a multiplex immunoassay kit.Levels of inflammatory proteins measured in the CVF were significantly correlated with AF proteins levels, whereas none of the proteins in plasma correlated significantly with any in the AF or CVF. Proteins levels measured in the AF and CVF were significantly higher in women with MIAC compared to those without, whereas only high levels of IL-6 in plasma were significantly associated with MIAC. By using stepwise regression analysis, a non-invasive model (using clinical factors and CVF cytokine levels) for the prediction of MIAC was developed; the area under curve of this non-invasive model was similar to that of the invasive model (using clinical factors and AF cytokines).The levels of inflammatory proteins in the CVF correlated with those in the AF, whereas those in the plasma showed no correlation. A non-invasive model using clinical factors and CVF cytokine levels predicted the risk of MIAC in women with pPROM."
https://openalex.org/W2838052412,"Estimation of remaining capacity is essential for ensuring the safety and reliability of lithium-ion batteries. In actual operation, batteries are seldom fully discharged. For a constant current-constant voltage charging mode, the incomplete discharging process affects not only the initial state but also processed variables of the subsequent charging profile, thereby mainly limiting the applications of many feature-based capacity estimation methods which rely on a whole cycling process. Since the charging information of the constant voltage profile can be completely saved whether the battery is fully discharged or not, a geometrical feature of the constant voltage charging profile is extracted to be a new aging feature of lithium-ion batteries under the incomplete discharging situation in this work. By introducing the quantum computing theory into the classical machine learning technique, an integrated quantum particle swarm optimization-based support vector regression estimation framework, as well as its application to characterize the relationship between extracted feature and battery remaining capacity, are presented and illustrated in detail. With the lithium-ion battery data provided by NASA, experiment and comparison results demonstrate the effectiveness, accuracy, and superiority of the proposed battery capacity estimation framework for the not entirely discharged condition."
https://openalex.org/W2821910033,"White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is one of the most devastating pathogens of cultured shrimp, responsible for massive loss of its commercial products worldwide. The oriental river prawn Macrobrachium nipponense is an economically important species that is widely farmed in China and adult prawns can be infected by WSSV. However, the molecular mechanisms of the host pathogen interaction remain unknown. There is an urgent need to learn the host pathogen interaction between M. nipponense and WSSV which will be able to offer a solution in controlling the spread of WSSV. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) was used in this study to determin the transcriptome differences by the comparison of control and WSSV-challenged moribund samples, control and WSSV-challenged survived samples of hepatopancreas in M. nipponense. A total of 64,049 predicted unigenes were obtained and classified into 63 functional groups. Approximately, 4,311 differential expression genes were identified with 3,308 genes were up-regulated when comparing the survived samples with the control. In the comparison of moribund samples with control, 1,960 differential expression genes were identified with 764 genes were up-regulated. In the contrast of two comparison libraries, 300 mutual DEGs with 95 up-regulated genes and 205 down-regulated genes. All the DEGs were performed GO and KEGG analysis, overall a total of 85 immune-related genes were obtained and these gene were groups into 13 functions and 4 KEGG pathways, such as protease inhibitors, heat shock proteins, oxidative stress, pathogen recognition immune receptors, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, MAPK signaling pathway and Ubiquitin Proteasome Pathway. Ten genes that valuable in immune responses against WSSV were selected from those DEGs to furture discuss the response of host to WSSV. Results from this study contribute to a better understanding of the immune response of M. nipponense to WSSV, provide information for identifying novel genes in the absence of genome of M. nipponense. Furthermore, large number of transcripts obtained from this study could provide a strong basis for future genomic research on M. nipponense."
https://openalex.org/W2840734108,"High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is widely used for absolute quantitation. The advent of new columns and HPLC technology has enabled higher sample throughput, and hence, larger scale studies that perform quantitation on different sample types (e.g. healthy controls vs. patients with rheumatoid arthritis) using HPLC are becoming feasible. However, there remains a lack of methods that can analyse the increased number of HPLC samples. To address this in part, the modular toolkit HappyTools has been developed for the high-throughput targeted quantitation of HPLC measurements. HappyTools enables the user to create an automated workflow that includes retention time (tr) calibration, data extraction and the calculation of several quality criteria for data curation. HappyTools has been tested on a biopharmaceutical standard and previously published clinical samples. The results show comparable accuracy between HappyTools, Waters Empower and ThermoFisher Chromeleon. However, HappyTools offered superior precision and throughput when compared with Waters Empower and ThermoFisher Chromeleon. HappyTools is released under the Apache 2.0 license, both the source code and a Windows binary can be freely downloaded from https://github.com/Tarskin/HappyTools."
https://openalex.org/W2840780224,"Background Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors may have protective effects on diabetic kidney disease (DKD) via specific antioxidant pathways. The DPP-4 inhibitor, linagliptin, was evaluated with the hypothesis that DPP-4 inhibition would ameliorate the development of DKD in a glucose-independent manner by altering specific antioxidant function. Methods DBA/2J mice (a well-characterized model of DKD) and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficient mice (a model of impaired antioxidant function) were evaluated. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin. Mice were divided into: diabetic (DM), diabetic+linagliptin (DM+Lina), and non-diabetic control and treated for 12 weeks. Results In DBA/2J mice, there was no difference in body weight and blood glucose between DM and DM+Lina groups. Linagliptin ameliorated albuminuria and kidney hypertrophy in DM DBA/2J mice and specifically increased the mRNA and protein levels for the antioxidants catalase and MnSOD. In G6PD deficient mice, however, increases in these mRNA levels did not occur and linagliptin renoprotection was not observed. Linagliptin also ameliorated histological trends toward mesangial expansion in wild-type mice but not in G6PD deficient mice. Conclusions Linagliptin renoprotection involved glucose-independent but antioxidant-enzyme-system-dependent increases in transcription (not just increased protein levels) of antioxidant proteins in wild-type mice. These studies demonstrate that an intact antioxidant system, in particular including transcription of catalase and MnSOD, is required for the renoprotective effects of linagliptin."
https://openalex.org/W2881799221,"The human virome plays an important role for the clinical outcome of lung transplant recipients (LTRs). While pathogenic viruses may cause severe infections, non-pathogenic viruses may serve as potential markers for the level of immunosuppression. However, neither the complexity of the virome in different compartments nor the dynamics of the virus populations posttransplantation are yet understood. Therefore, in this study the virome was analyzed by metagenomic sequencing in simultaneously withdrawn bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and plasma samples of 15 LTRs. In seven patients, also follow-up samples were investigated for abundance and dynamics of virus populations posttransplantation. Five eukaryotic and two prokaryotic virus families were identified in BAL, and nine eukaryotic and two prokaryotic families in plasma. Anelloviruses were the most abundant in both compartments, followed by Herpes- and Coronaviruses. Virus abundance was significantly higher in LTRs than in healthy controls (Kruskal-Wallis test, p<0.001). Up to 48 different anellovirus strains were identified within a single LTR. Analyses in the follow-up patients revealed for the first time a highly complex and unique dynamics of individual anellovirus strains in the posttransplantation period. The abundance of anelloviruses in plasma was inversely correlated with that of other eukaryotic viruses (Pearson correlation coefficient r = -0.605; p<0.05). A broad spectrum of virus strains co-exists in BAL and plasma of LTRs. Especially for the anelloviruses, a high degree of co-infections and a highly individual and complex dynamics after transplantation was observed. The biological impact of these findings and their relation to clinical variables remain to be elucidated by future analyses."

A case series of 12 men from Metro Manila were interviewed to explore barriers to uptake of HIV testing services. Most did not see the need to get tested for HIV despite significant risk, based on the misconception they were feeling well or showed no symptoms. Being of a higher socioeconomic class, feeling morally superior to other gay men, distance of the testing facility, fear of what will happen once infected, fear of HIV- and sexual stigma, fear of side effects of antiretroviral drugs and fear of high health care expenses after testing positive for HIV were key reasons why MSM kept postponing their test. Misconceptions about HIV risk, disease, and treatment and care need to be addressed in order to increase uptake of HIV services in this population."
https://openalex.org/W2864639456,"Recent research on aesthetics has challenged the adage that “beauty is in the eye of the beholder” by identifying several factors that predict ratings of beauty. However, this research has emerged in a piecemeal fashion. Most studies have examined only a few predictors of beauty, and measured either subjective or objective predictors, but not both. Whether the predictors of ratings of beauty versus liking differ has not been tested, nor has whether predictors differ for major distinctions in art, such as abstract vs. representational paintings. Finally, past studies have either relied on experimenter-generated stimuli—which likely yield pallid aesthetic experiences—or on a curation of high-quality art—thereby restricting the range of predictor scores. We report a study (N = 598) that measured 4 subjective and 11 objective predictors of both beauty ratings and liking ratings, for 240 abstract and 240 representational paintings that varied widely in beauty. A crossover pattern occurred in the ratings, such that for abstract paintings liking ratings were higher than beauty ratings, whereas for representational paintings beauty ratings were higher than liking ratings. Prediction was much better for our subjective than objective predictors, and much better for our representational than abstract paintings. For abstract paintings, liking ratings were much more predictable than beauty ratings. Implications and directions for future research are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2876713292,"Embryos of the crustacean, Artemia franciscana, may undergo oviparous development, forming encysted embryos (cysts) that are released from females and enter diapause, a state of suppressed metabolism and greatly enhanced stress tolerance. Diapause-destined embryos of A. franciscana synthesize three small heat shock proteins (sHsps), p26, ArHsp21 and ArHsp22, as well as artemin, a ferritin homologue, all lacking in embryos that develop directly into nauplii. Of these diapause-specific molecular chaperones, p26 and artemin are important contributors to the extraordinary stress tolerance of A. franciscana cysts, but how their synthesis is regulated is unknown. To address this issue, a cDNA for heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1), shown to encode a protein similar to Hsf1 from other organisms, was cloned from A. franciscana. Hsf1 was knocked down by RNA interference (RNAi) in nauplii and cysts of A. franciscana. Nauplii lacking Hsf1 died prematurely upon release from females, showing that this transcription factor is essential to the survival of nauplii. Diapause cysts with diminished amounts of Hsf1 were significantly less stress tolerant than cysts containing normal levels of Hsf1. Moreover, cysts deficient in Hsf1 possessed reduced amounts of p26, ArHsp21, ArHsp22 and artemin, revealing dependence on Hsf1 for expression of their genes and maximum stress tolerance. The results demonstrate an important role for Hsf1, likely in concert with other transcription factors, in the survival and growth of A. franciscana and in the developmentally regulated synthesis of proteins responsible for the stress tolerance of diapausing A. franciscana cysts."
https://openalex.org/W2830777979,"The genus Cooperia includes important parasites of ruminants and currently contains 34 accepted species. However, even for those species infecting livestock, there is a considerable lack of molecular information and many species are only identifiable using subtle morphological traits. The present study aimed to provide molecular data to allow diagnosis of Cooperia species infecting cattle. Partial sequences of two mitochondrial (cytochrome oxidase 2, 12S rRNA gene) and two nuclear genes (isotype 1 β tubulin gene including two introns, internal transcribed spacers (ITS) were obtained from morphologically identified specimens of Cooperia pectinata, Cooperia punctata and Cooperia spatulata as well as from larvae of pure Cooperia oncophora and C. punctata laboratory isolates. Pairwise identity of ITS-2 sequences was very high and it was the only region able to identify a specimen as Cooperia sp. However, the ITS-2 was unreliable for diagnosis at the species level. All other marker sequences could not unequivocally be allocated to the genus Cooperia but allowed clear species identification with the exception of the pair C. punctata/C. spatulata for which no significant differences were found for any marker sequence. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analyses of individual genes as well as a multi-locus analysis covering all four sequences confirmed that specimen identified as C. spatulata were randomly distributed throughout the C. punctata cluster and formed no group of their own. In contrast, the other Cooperia species formed clearly separated and statistically supported clusters. These data indicate that C. spatulata is most likely only a morphotype of C. punctata and the name should be considered a synonym. Combinations of nuclear and mitochondrial markers should be used to identify morphotypes or cryptic species to benefit from excellent barcoding properties of the latter but allowing proper phylogenetic analyses and controlling for lineage sorting that might occur for mitochondrial genotypes within a species."
https://openalex.org/W2847541658,"The first draft genome sequencing of the non-model fungal pathogen Pyrenochaeta lycopersici showed an expansion of gene families associated with heterokaryon incompatibility and lacking of mating-type genes, providing insights into the genetic basis of this ""imperfect"" fungus which lost the ability to produce the sexual stage. However, due to the Illumina short-read technology, the draft genome was too fragmented to allow a comprehensive characterization of the genome, especially of the repetitive sequence fraction. In this work, the sequencing of another P. lycopersici isolate using long-read Single Molecule Real-Time sequencing technology was performed with the aim of obtaining a gapless genome. Indeed, a gapless genome assembly of 62.7 Mb was obtained, with a fraction of repetitive sequences representing 30% of the total bases. The gene content of the two P. lycopersici isolates was very similar, and the large difference in genome size (about 8 Mb) might be attributable to the high fraction of repetitive sequences detected for the new sequenced isolate. The role of repetitive elements, including transposable elements, in modulating virulence effectors is well established in fungal plant pathogens. Moreover, transposable elements are of fundamental importance in creating and re-modelling genes, especially in imperfect fungi. Their abundance in P. lycopersici, together with the large expansion of heterokaryon incompatibility genes in both sequenced isolates, suggest the presence of possible mechanisms alternative to gene re-assorting mediated by sexual recombination. A quite large fraction (~9%) of repetitive elements in P. lycopersici, has no homology with known classes, strengthening this hypothesis. The availability of a gapless genome of P. lycopersici allowed the in-depth analysis of its genome content, by annotating functional genes and TEs. This goal will be an important resource for shedding light on the evolution of the reproductive and pathogenic behaviour of this soilborne pathogen and the onset of a possible speciation within this species."
https://openalex.org/W2850686245,"Mountains are considered excellent natural laboratories for studying the determinants of plant diversity at contrasting spatial scales. To gain insights into how plant diversity is structured at different spatial scales, we surveyed high mountain plant communities in the Chilean Andes where man-driven perturbations are rare. This was done along elevational gradients located at different latitudes taking into account factors that act at fine scales, including abiotic (potential solar radiation and soil quality) and biotic (species interactions) factors, and considering multiple spatial scales. Species richness, inverse of Simpson's concentration (Dequiv), beta-diversity and plant cover were estimated using the percentage of cover per species recorded in 34 sites in the different regions with contrasted climates. Overall, plant species richness, Dequiv and plant cover were lower in sites located at higher latitudes. We found a unimodal relationship between species richness and elevation and this pattern was constant independently of the regional climatic conditions. Soil quality decreased the beta-diversity among the plots in each massif and increased the richness, the Dequiv and cover. Segregated patterns of species co-occurrence were related to increases in richness, Dequiv and plant cover at finer scales. Our results showed that elevation patterns of alpine plant diversity remained constant along the regions although the mechanisms underlying these diversity patterns may differ among climatic regions. They also suggested that the patterns of plant diversity in alpine ecosystems respond to a series of factors (abiotic and biotic) that act jointly at different spatial scale determining the assemblages of local communities, but their importance can only be assessed using a multi-scale spatial approach."
https://openalex.org/W2862059015,"The impairment to discriminate the motion direction of a large high contrast stimulus or to detect a stimulus surrounded by another one is called visual suppression and is the result of the normal function of our visual inhibitory mechanisms. Recently, Melnick et al. (2013), using a motion discrimination task, showed that intelligence strongly correlates with visual suppression (r = 0.71). Cook et al. (2016) also showed a strong link between contrast surround suppression and IQ (r = 0.87), this time using a contrast matching task. Our aim is to test this link using two different visual suppression tasks: a motion discrimination task and a contrast detection task. Fifty volunteers took part in the experiments. Using Bayesian staircases, we measured duration thresholds in the motion experiment and contrast thresholds in the spatial experiment. Although we found a much weaker effect, our results from the motion experiment still replicate previous results supporting the link between motion surround suppression and IQ (r = 0.43). However, our results from the spatial experiment do not support the link between contrast surround suppression and IQ (r = -0.09). Methodological differences between this study and previous studies which could explain these discrepancies are discussed."

This research aimed to evaluate associations between BLL and blood pressure in an occupational population-based study in Jiangsu province, China. We enrolled 21,688 workers in this study. Information on socioeconomic and occupational background was obtained with face-to-face interviews. BLL, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured, and hypertension status was confirmed. We found that workers in mini-factories had the highest average BLL (20.3 μg/dL; 95% CI, 19.0–21.6 μg/dL) for overall participants. The employees in private factories had higher BLL (9.6 μg/dL; 95% CI, 9.5–9.8 μg/dL). However, BLL was much lower (4.0 μg/dL; 95%CI, 3.7–4.2 μg/dL) in state-owned factories. Participants working in the electrical machinery and equipment manufacturing industry had higher BLL (9.1 μg/dL; 95% CI, 9.0–9.3μg/dL). Compared to those workers with ≤ 4.6 μg/dL BLL, workers with > 17.5 μg/dL BLL presented 1.34 mmHg and 0.70 mmHg average difference in SBP and DBP, respectively. The adjusted OR for hypertension was 1.11 (95%CI, 1.08–1.15) compared to the workers with > 17.5 μg/dL BLL and to those with ≤ 4.6 μg/dL BLL. In summary, we found that BLL was positively associated with SBP and DBP and with the morbidity of hypertension in occupational populations with a high concentration of lead exposure. It is important to formulate new standards of blood lead levels to screen for elevated lead exposure. In addition, a series of new systems of risk assessment should be established to further reduce and prevent lead exposure."

PDO mutations result in the autosomal-recessive disorder ethylmalonic encephalopathy (EE). Here, we developed γ-glutamyl-homocysteinyl-glycine (GHcySH), in which the cysteinyl moiety in GSH is substituted with homocysteine, as a mechanism-based PDO inhibitor. Human PDO used GHcySH as an alternative substrate and converted it to GHcy-SO2H, mimicking GS-SO2H, the putative oxygenated intermediate formed with the natural substrate. Because GHcy-SO2H contains a C–S bond rather than an S–S bond in GS-SO2H, it failed to undergo the final hydrolysis step in the catalytic cycle, leading to PDO inhibition. We also characterized the biochemical penalties incurred by the L55P, T136A, C161Y, and R163W mutations reported in EE patients. The variants displayed lower iron content (1.4–11-fold) and lower thermal stability (1.2–1.7-fold) than WT PDO.

https://openalex.org/W2827630022,"Background Hearing impairment, vision impairment, and dual impairment (both hearing and vision impairment), have been independently associated with functional and cognitive decline. In prior studies of dual impairment, vision impairment is generally not defined or defined by visual acuity alone. Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness and does not affect visual acuity until late in the disease; instead, visual field loss is used to measure vision impairment from glaucoma. Objective To examine the effect of glaucomatous visual field loss and hearing impairment on function. Design Cross-sectional. Setting Hospital-based clinic in Baltimore, Maryland. Subjects 220 adults, ≥55 years presenting to the glaucoma clinic. Methods Vision impairment was defined as mean deviation on visual field testing worse than -5 decibels in the better eye, and hearing impairment was defined as pure tone average worse than 25 decibels on threshold audiometry testing in the better ear. Standardized questionnaires were used to assess functional status. Results Five participants were excluded for incomplete testing, leaving 32 with vision impairment only, 63 with hearing impairment only, 42 with dual impairment, and 78 controls with no hearing impairment or vision impairment. Participants with dual impairment were more likely to be older and non-White. Dual impairment was associated with significantly more severe driving limitation and more difficulty with communication compared to those without sensory impairment when adjusted for age, race, gender and number of comorbidities. Conclusion Older individuals with glaucoma and hearing loss seem to have generally poorer functioning than those with single sensory loss. Health professionals should consider visual field loss as a type of vision impairment when managing patients with dual impairment."
https://openalex.org/W2817356622,"It is intriguing that a rare, inherited lysosomal storage disorder Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) shares similarities with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We have previously reported an enhanced processing of β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-secretase (BACE1), a key enzyme in the pathogenesis of AD, in NPC1-null cells. In this work, we characterized regional and temporal expression and processing of the recently identified BACE1 substrates seizure protein 6 (Sez6) and seizure 6-like protein (Sez6L), and APP, in NPC1-/- (NPC1) and NPC1+/+ (wt) mouse brains. We analysed 4-weeks old brains to detect the earliest changes associated with NPC, and 10-weeks of age to identify changes at terminal disease stage. Sez6 and Sez6L were selected due to their predominant cleavage by BACE1, and their potential role in synaptic function that may contribute to presentation of seizures and/or motor impairments in NPC patients. While an enhanced BACE1-cleavage of all three substrates was detected in NPC1 vs. wt-mouse brains at 4-weeks of age, at 10-weeks increased proteolysis by BACE1 was observed for Sez6L in the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of NPC1-mice. Interestingly, both APP and Sez6L were found to be expressed in Purkinje neurons and their immunostaining was lost upon Purkinje cell neurodegeneration in 10-weeks old NPC1 mice. Furthermore, in NPC1- vs. wt-mouse primary cortical neurons, both Sez6 and Sez6L showed increased punctuate staining within the endolysosomal pathway as well as increased Sez6L and BACE1-positive puncta. This indicates that a trafficking defect within the endolysosomal pathway may play a key role in enhanced BACE1-proteolysis in NPC disease. Overall, our findings suggest that enhanced proteolysis by BACE1 could be a part of NPC disease pathogenesis. Understanding the basic biology of BACE1 and the functional impact of cleavage of its substrates is important to better evaluate the therapeutic potential of BACE1 against AD and, possibly, NPC disease."

Total cholesterol decreases after surgery and in various pathological conditions, including trauma, sepsis, burns, and liver dysfunction. This study aimed to determine whether hypocholesterolemia after emergency gastrointestinal (GI) surgery is associated with in-hospital mortality in patients with diffuse peritonitis. Methods The medical records of 926 critically ill patients who had undergone emergency GI surgery for diffuse peritonitis, between January 2007 and December 2015, were retrospectively analyzed. The integrated areas under the curve (iAUCs) were calculated to compare the predictive accuracy of total cholesterol values from postoperative days (PODs) 0, 1, 3, and 7. Cox proportional hazard regression modeling was performed for all possible predictors identified in the univariate and multivariable analyses. Results The total cholesterol level measured on POD 7 had the highest iAUC (0.7292; 95% confidence interval, 0.6696–0.7891) and was significantly better at predicting in-hospital mortality than measurements on other days. The optimal total cholesterol cut-off value for predicting in-hospital mortality was 61 mg/dL and was determined on POD 7. A Cox proportional hazard regression analysis revealed that a POD 7 total cholesterol level < 61 mg/dL was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality after emergency GI surgery (hazard ratio, 3.961; 95% confidence interval, 1.786–8.784). Conclusion Severe persistent hypocholesterolemia (<61 mg/dL) on POD 7 independently predicted in-hospital mortality, after emergency GI surgery, in critically ill patients with diffuse peritonitis."
https://openalex.org/W2823215340,"Background Scrub typhus is a potentially life-threatening vector-borne infection caused by Orientia species. It occurs mainly in the Asian-Pacific region, where it causes significant morbidity and mortality. Recently, an endemic focus of scrub typhus has been described in South America, on Chiloé Island in southern Chile. Dogs have been used as sentinel hosts to determine the presence and spatial distribution of various vector-borne infections. Their suitability to gain insight into human exposure to Orientia tsutsugamushi has been suggested in studies from Asia. Methodology In January 2016, we conducted a cross-sectional study, which included the two main cities on Chiloé Island. Canine blood samples were obtained in households, chosen by double stratified random sampling in urban and by convenience in rural locations. Specimens were tested by ELISA for IgG antibodies against whole-cell antigen preparations from three strains of O. tsutsugamushi. Data were further analyzed for factors associated with seropositivity including spatial clustering. Results Serum samples from 202 dogs (104 urban, 98 rural) were tested for IgG against O. tsutsugamushi, of which 43 (21.3%) were positive. Seroprevalence rates were higher in rural than in urban settings (p<0.01) and in older compared to younger dogs (p<0.01). Spatial analysis by LISA indicated the presence of four localities of highly grouped cases. Conclusions The detected seroprevalence supports the endemicity of scrub typhus in southern Chile and suggests a wide exposure of household dogs to the infected, yet unknown vector(s). The spatial data will be used for future research identifying further human cases as well as the local vector(s)/reservoirs for scrub typhus in southern Chile. The study reinforces that dogs are useful sentinels for Orientia spp. in regions of uncertain endemicity and distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2837895885,"Background Many studies investigating the impact of individual risk factors on cord blood immune cell counts may be biased given that cord blood composition is influenced by a multitude of factors. The aim of this study was to comprehensively investigate the relative impact of environmental, hereditary and perinatal factors on cord blood cells. Methods In 295 neonates from the prospective Basel-Bern Infant Lung Development Cohort, we performed complete blood counts and fluorescence-activated cell sorting scans of umbilical cord blood. The associations between risk factors and cord blood cells were assessed using multivariable linear regressions. Results The multivariable regression analysis showed that an increase per 10μg/m3 of the average nitrogen dioxide 14 days before birth was associated with a decrease in leukocyte (6.7%, 95% CI:-12.1,-1.0) and monocyte counts (11.6%, 95% CI:-19.6,-2.8). Maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated with significantly lower cord blood cell counts in multiple cell populations. Moreover, we observed sex differences regarding eosinophilic granulocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Finally, significantly increased numbers of cord blood cells were observed in infants exposed to perinatal stress. Cesarean section seems to play a significant role in Th1/Th2 balance. Conclusions Our results suggest that all three: environmental, hereditary and perinatal factors play a significant role in the composition of cord blood cells at birth, and it is important to adjust for all of these factors in cord blood studies. In particular, perinatal circumstances seem to influence immune balance, which could have far reaching consequences in the development of immune mediated diseases."

Integration site clusters showed the highest ATAC-seq signals at HSC-specific peaks and strongly correlated with hematopoietic risk variants. Tagged genes were significantly enriched for HSC gene sets. We were able to map over 3,000 HSC regulatory regions in late-contributing HSCs, and we used these data to identify miR-10a and miR-335 as two miRNAs regulating early hematopoiesis. In this study, we show that viral insertion sites can be used as molecular tags to assess chromatin conformation on functionally defined cell populations, thereby providing a genome-wide resource for regulatory regions in human repopulating long-term HSCs."

Recent microfluidic studies suggest that differential growth or gene expression patterns may explain some of the heterogeneity of aging assays. Herein, we sought to complement this work by similarly examining a large set of replicative lifespan data from traditional plate assays. In so doing, we reproduced the finding that short-lived cells tend to arrest at senescence with a budded morphology. Further, we found that wild type cells born unusually small did not have an extended lifespan. However, large birth size and/or high inter-generational growth rates significantly correlated with a reduced lifespan. Finally, we found that SIR2 expression levels correlated with lifespan and intergenerational growth. SIR2 expression was significantly reduced in large cells and increased in small wild type cells. A moderate increase in SIR2 expression correlated with reduced growth, decreased proliferation and increased lifespan in plate aging assays. We conclude that cellular growth rates and SIR2 expression levels may contribute to lifespan variation in individual cells."

Normal ovarian physiology is intricately connected to small GTP binding proteins of the Ras superfamily (Ras, Rho, Rab, Arf, and Ran) which govern processes such as signal transduction, cell proliferation, cell motility, and vesicle transport. We hypothesized that common germline variation in genes encoding small GTPases is associated with EOC risk. We investigated 322 variants in 88 small GTPase genes in germline DNA of 18,736 EOC patients and 26,138 controls of European ancestry using a custom genotype array and logistic regression fitting log-additive models. Functional annotation was used to identify biofeatures and expression quantitative trait loci that intersect with risk variants. One variant, ARHGEF10L (Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 10 like) rs2256787, was associated with increased endometrioid EOC risk (OR = 1.33, p = 4.46 x 10-6). Other variants of interest included another in ARHGEF10L, rs10788679, which was associated with invasive serous EOC risk (OR = 1.07, p = 0.00026) and two variants in AKAP6 (A-kinase anchoring protein 6) which were associated with risk of invasive EOC (rs1955513, OR = 0.90, p = 0.00033; rs927062, OR = 0.94, p = 0.00059). Functional annotation revealed that the two ARHGEF10L variants were located in super-enhancer regions and that AKAP6 rs927062 was associated with expression of GTPase gene ARHGAP5 (Rho GTPase activating protein 5). Inherited variants in ARHGEF10L and AKAP6, with potential transcriptional regulatory function and association with EOC risk, warrant investigation in independent EOC study populations."
https://openalex.org/W2949549185,"An unanswered question regarding Alzheimer disease dementia (ADD) is whether amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques sequester toxic soluble Aβ species early during pathological progression. We previously reported that the concentration of soluble Aβ aggregates from patients with mild dementia was higher than soluble Aβ aggregates from patients with modest Aβ plaque burden but no dementia. The ratio of soluble Aβ aggregate concentration to Aβ plaque area fully distinguished these groups of patients. We hypothesized that initially plaques may serve as a reservoir or sink for toxic soluble Aβ aggregates, sequestering them from other targets in the extracellular space and thereby preventing their toxicity. To initially test a generalized version of this hypothesis, we have performed binding assessments using biotinylated synthetic Aβ1-42 peptide. Aβ1-42-biotin peptide was incubated on unfixed frozen sections from non-demented high plaque pathology controls and patients with ADD. The bound peptide was measured using ELISA and confocal microscopy. We observed no quantitative difference in Aβ binding between the groups using either method. Further testing of the buffering hypothesis using various forms of synthetic and human derived soluble Aβ aggregates will be required to definitively address the role of plaque buffering as it relates to ADD."

However, the exact mechanisms of antidiabetic effects of Lobe have not been established in an animal model. The aim of this study was to evaluate the hypoglycemic effects of Lobe and investigate possible factors involved in Lobe-enhanced hepatic steatosis in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Mice were fed an HFD for 15 weeks. Lobe was administrated orally during the last 9 weeks. Lobe treatment significantly reduced insulin resistance and increased expression of hepatic glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and PPARs in HFD-fed mice. However, increased body weight and hepatic steatosis were not reduced by Lobe in these mice. Metabolomics fingerprinting showed that several lipogenesis-related hepatic and serum metabolites in HFD-fed mice had positive or negative correlations with Lobe administration. In particular, increased leptin levels during HFD were further increased by Lobe. HFD-induced signaling transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation in the hypothalamus was increased by Lobe. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis showed more proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-positive neurons in the hypothalamus of HFD-fed mice (with or without Lobe) compared with normal diet-fed mice. Despite improving leptin signaling in the hypothalamus and enhancing insulin sensitivity in HFD-fed mice, Lobe increased body weight and steatosis. Further research is necessary regarding other factors affecting Lobe-enhanced hepatic steatosis and hyperphagia."

https://openalex.org/W2856986341,"Stable carbon (13C) and nitrogen isotopes (15N) are useful tools in determining the presence of agricultural influences in freshwater ecosystems. Here we examined δ15N and δ13C signatures in nitrate, fish, and mussel tissues, from rivers in Southern Ontario, Canada, that vary in their catchment proportion of agriculture land use, nutrients and organic matter quality. We found comparatively 15N-enriched δ15N values in animal tissues and dissolved nitrates, relative to expected values characterized by natural sources. We also observed a strong, positive correlation between riparian agriculture percentages and δ15N values in animal tissues and nitrates, indicating a significant influence of agricultural land use and the probable dominance of organic fertilizer and manure inputs in particular. The use of a 15N-based equation for the estimation of fish trophic position confirmed dietary analyses is showing all fish species to be tertiary consumers, with a relatively consistent 15N-enrichment in animal tissues between trophic levels. This indicates that variability in 15N-trophic fractionation is minor, and that fish and mussel tissue δ15N values are largely representative of source nitrogen. However, the trophic fractionation value varied from accepted literature values, suggesting strong influences from either local environmental conditions or dietary variation. The δ13C datasets did not correlate with riparian agriculture, and animal δ13C signatures in their tissues are consistent with terrestrial C3 vegetation, suggesting the dominance of allochthonous DOC sources. We found that changes in water chemistry and dissolved organic matter quality brought about by agricultural inputs were clearly expressed in the δ15N signatures of animal tissues from all trophic levels. As such, this study confirmed the source of anthropogenic nitrogen in the studied watersheds, and demonstrated that this agriculturally-derived nitrogen could be traced with δ15N signatures through successive trophic levels in local aquatic food webs. The δ13C data was less diagnostic of local agriculture, due to the more complex interplay of carbon cycling and environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2839267431,"Inaccuracy in the vergence eye position (“fixation disparity”) can occur despite a fusion stimulus. When measured with eye trackers, this inaccuracy is referred to as “objective fixation disparity”. It is a matter of debate whether objective fixation disparity can be estimated with a technically simple psycho-physical procedure, i.e. the perceived offset of aligned dichoptic nonius targets, referred to as “subjective fixation disparity”. To investigate the relation between these two measures, simultaneous tests were made in far vision when placing prisms in front of the eyes (for a few seconds) in order to induce forced vergence, i.e. to vary the absolute disparity (from 1 deg divergent to 3.4 deg convergent). Frequent repeated measurements in 12 observers allowed for individual analyses. Generally, fixation disparity values and the effects of prisms were much smaller in the subjective than in the objective measures. Some observers differed systematically in the characteristics of the two types of prism-induced curves. Individual regressions showed that the subjective vs. objective slope was 8% on the average (with largest individual values of 18%). This suggests that sensory fusion shifts the visual direction of the (peripheral) binocular targets by the full amount of objective fixation disparity (since single vision was achieved); however, for the (central) monocular nonius lines this shift was more or less incomplete so that the dichoptic nonius targets indicated an individual percentage of objective fixation disparity. The subjective-to-objective ratio seems to be an individual characteristic of fixation disparity in terms of the amount and in terms of the effect of prism-induced forced vergence. Therefore, on the group level the subjective measures do not allow for a precise prediction of the objective measures."
https://openalex.org/W2878893122,"In eubacteria, cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) signaling is involved in virulence, persistence, motility and generally orchestrates multicellular behavior in bacterial biofilms. Intracellular c-di-GMP levels are maintained by the opposing activities of diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) and cognate phosphodiesterases (PDEs). The c-di-GMP homeostasis in Mycobacterium smegmatis is supported by DcpA, a conserved, bifunctional protein with both DGC and PDE activities. DcpA is a multidomain protein whose GAF-GGDEF-EAL domains are arranged in tandem and are required for these two activities. To gain insight into how interactions among these three domains affect DcpA activity, here we studied its domain dynamics using real-time FRET. We demonstrate that substrate binding in DcpA results in domain movement that prompts a switch from an open to a closed conformation and alters its catalytic activity. We found that a single point mutation in the conserved EAL motif (E384A) results in complete loss of the PDE activity of the EAL domain and in a significant decrease in the DGC activity of the GGDEF domain. Structural analyses revealed multiple hydrophobic and aromatic residues around Cys579 that are necessary for proper DcpA folding and maintenance of the active conformation. On the basis of these observations and taking into account additional bioinformatics analysis of EAL domain-containing proteins, we identified a critical putatively conserved motif, GCXXXQGF, that plays an important role in c-di-GMP turnover. We conclude that a substrate-induced conformational switch involving movement of a loop containing a conserved motif in the bifunctional diguanylate cyclase-phosphodiesterase DcpA controls c-di-GMP turnover in M. smegmatis."

However, despite the cultural and economic importance of fame and its gradations, there exists no consensus method for quantifying the fame of an individual, or of comparing that of two individuals. We argue that, even if fame is difficult to measure with precision, one may develop useful metrics for fame that correlate well with intuition and that remain reasonably stable over time. Using datasets of recently deceased individuals who were highly renowned, we have evaluated several internet-based methods for quantifying fame. We find that some widely-used internet-derived metrics, such as search engine results, correlate poorly with human subject judgments of fame. However other metrics exist that agree well with human judgments and appear to offer workable, easily accessible measures of fame. Using such a metric we perform a preliminary investigation of the statistical distribution of fame, which has some of the power law character seen in other natural and social phenomena such as landslides and market crashes. In order to demonstrate how such findings can generate quantitative insight into celebrity culture, we assess some folk ideas regarding the frequency distribution and apparent clustering of celebrity deaths."
https://openalex.org/W2833919170,"We have demonstrated previously that a soluble factor (LrS) produced by Lactobacillus (L.) reuteri CRL 1098 modulates the inflammatory response triggered by lipopolysaccharide. In this study, the production of LrS by L. reuteri CRL 1098 was realized through two steps: i) bacterial biomass production, ii) LrS production, where the bacterial biomass was able to live but did not proliferate. Therefore, the simultaneous evaluation of the effect of different factors on the growth and LrS production was performed. Biomass production was found to be dependent mainly on culture medium, while LrS production with anti-inflammatory activity depended on culture conditions of the biomass such as pH, agitation and growth phase. The L. reuteri CRL 1098 biomass and LrS production in the optimized culture media designed for this work reduced the complete process cost by approximately 95%, respectively to laboratory scale cost."

We developed a risk-adjustment model from readily available, internationally used survey data and a simple patient classification to aid such comparisons. Design We investigated the association between pediatric conserve antibiotic (pCA) exposure and patient / treatment characteristics derived from global point prevalence surveys of antibiotic prescribing, and developed a risk-adjustment model using multivariable logistic regression. The performance of a simple patient classification of groups with different expected pCA exposure levels was compared to the risk model. Setting 226 centers in 41 countries across 5 continents. Participants Neonatal and pediatric inpatient antibiotic prescriptions for sepsis/bloodstream infection for 1281 patients. Results Overall pCA exposure was high (35%), strongly associated with each variable (patient age, ward, underlying disease, community acquisition or nosocomial infection and empiric or targeted treatment), and all were included in the final risk-adjustment model. The model demonstrated good discrimination (c-statistic = 0.83) and calibration (p = 0.38). The simple classification model demonstrated similar discrimination and calibration to the risk model. The crude regional pCA exposure rates ranged from 10.3% (Africa) to 67.4% (Latin America). Risk adjustment substantially reduced the regional variation, the adjusted rates ranging from 17.1% (Africa) to 42.8% (Latin America). Conclusions Greater comparability of pCA exposure rates can be achieved by using a few easily collected variables to produce risk-adjusted rates."
https://openalex.org/W2869513180,"Background Zika virus (ZIKV) was first isolated in Uganda in 1947. In Brazil, the first reported case of ZIKV infection was in May 2015. Additionally, dengue (DENV) is endemic and there has been a recent outbreak of chikungunya (CHIKV). Since the clinical manifestations of different arboviral infections (AI) can be similar, definitive diagnosis requires laboratory testing. Objectives To determine the prevalence of ZIKV, DENV, and CHIKV infections in a Brazilian cohort of HIV-infected pregnant women, to assess clinical/immunological characteristics and pregnancy outcomes of women with evidence of recent AI. Study design Laboratory diagnosis of ZIKV, DENV and CHIKV infections utilized serological assays, RT-PCR and PRNT. The tests were performed at the first visit, 34–36 weeks of gestation and at any time if a woman had symptoms suggestive of AI. Mann-Whitney tests were used for comparison of medians, Chi-square or Fisher’s to compare proportions; p< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Poisson regression was used to analyze risk factors for central nervous system (CNS) malformations in the infant according to maternal symptomatology. Results Of 219 HIV-infected pregnant women enrolled, 92% were DENV IgG+; 47(22%) had laboratory evidence of recent AI. Of these, 34 (72%) were ZIKV+, nine (19%) CHIKV+, and two (4%) DENV+. Symptoms consistent with AI were observed in 23 (10%) women, of whom 10 (43%) were ZIKV+, eight (35%) CHIKV+. No CNS abnormalities were observed among infants of DENV+ or CHIKV+ women; four infants with CNS abnormalities were born to ZIKV+ women (three symptomatic). Infants born to ZIKV+ women had a higher risk of CNS malformations if the mother was symptomatic (RR = 7.20), albeit not statistically significant (p = 0.066). Conclusions Among HIV-infected pregnant women with laboratory evidence of a recent AI, 72% were ZIKV-infected. In this cohort, CNS malformations occurred among infants born to both symptomatic and asymptomatic pregnant women with Zika infection."
https://openalex.org/W2864822501,"Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) are commonly used in experimental laparoscopy in swine undergoing carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum. Hypercapnia may be present and may prolong NMBAs’ pharmacologic activity. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of permissive hypercapnia on the neuromuscular blockade of atracurium in swine. Six Large White swine weighing 30.5 ± 1.6 kg were sedated with intramuscular ketamine and medetomidine, after which anaesthesia was induced with propofol and maintained with sevoflurane. Atracurium 0.4 mg/kg was administered intravenously and the neuromuscular block monitored by acceleromyography during normocapnic and hypercapnic conditions (PaCO2 range 35–45 mmHg and 60–70 mmHg, respectively). Onset time and time to reach a train of four ratio (TOFR) of 0.7 and 0.9 were recorded. Cardiorespiratory parameters, electrolytes and acid-base status were measured under both conditions. Onset time was similar between the two conditions. Time to reach a TOFR of 0.7 and 0.9 (duration of the neuromuscular block) was longer in hypercapnic compared to normocapnic animals being 1325 ± 300 vs 855 ±111 (p = 0.002) and 1823 ± 434 vs 1218 ± 210 seconds (p = 0.005), respectively. Three hypercapnic swine had a TOF count of 2 and 1 instead of a count of 4 with fade. Permissive hypercapnia was associated with a decrease in pH from 7.444 ± 0.039 to 7.257 ± 0.025 (p < 0.001). No differences were observed for heart rate, end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane, body temperature and arterial haemoglobin saturation. Nonetheless, hypercapnic swine had a statistically significant increase in mean arterial pressure (p = 0.020) and plasma potassium concentration (p = 0.003). The values of PaCO2 achieved during hypercapnia were well tolerated in swine undergoing CO2 pneumoperitoneum for laparoscopy. Permissive hypercapnia increased the duration of the atracurium effect and caused an increase in the intensity of the neuromuscular block in few swine."
https://openalex.org/W2835321665,"Many studies have proven the importance of SnRK1 in the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism and plant development. Compared to Arabidopsis, much less is known about SnRK1 complexes in crop plants, and therefore, more work needs to be done to identify SnRK1 genes and to investigate their function in crop plants.In this study we identified five SnRK1-related genes in potato by analyzing the potato genome through BLAST, which encode one α-subunit isoform (stKIN), two β-subunit isoforms (stKINβ1 and stKINβ2) and two γ-subunit isoforms (stKINγ and stKINβγ). To investigate the functions of SnRK1 in the tuber development of potato, we further made overexpression and RNAi transgenic plants of these five genes. Based on these overexpression transgenic plants, the Fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) were employed to purify SnRK1 complexes, which were tracked by western-blot.Experiments in vivo and in vitro showed that these five proteins in potato are functional SNF1/AMPK/SnRK1-related proteins. The SnRK1 activity decreased by 60% in the RNAi transgenic lines of stKIN; the starch content increased by 25% in the overexpression transgenic lines of stKIN, compared to that in the wild-type lines, whereas there is no significant difference in SnRK1 activity and starch content in the RNAi transgenic or overexpression lines of stKINβ1, stKINβ2, stKINγ and stKINβγ. In addition, we found that a few different SnRK1 complexes are present in potato by partially purifying SnRK1 complexes from these overexpression transgenic plants.Five functional SnRK1-related genes were identified in potato, including three novel genes, which encode one α-subunit isoform (stKIN), two β-subunit isoforms (stKINβ1 and stKINβ2) and two γ-subunit isoforms (stKINγ and stKINβγ). We found that a few SnRK1 related genes are present in potato tuber, which form several different SnRK1 isoenzymes. We found that stKIN is the primary α subunit of SnRK1 in potato tuber and plays important roles in the development of potato tubers."
