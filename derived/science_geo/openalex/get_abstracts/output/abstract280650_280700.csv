Some policy analysts think that by tweaking the rules, the United States could eventually sign on, but if they are tweaked too much, other countries may balk. The key, some say, will be keeping the treaty going now and rethinking its controversial goals later."

(2) This 5,5-dichloroxyhydrouracil reacts with barium hydroxide immediately at ordinary temperature giving the purple colored barium salt of dialuric acid. (3) Both uracil and cytosine can be detected successfully in minute quantities by application of the technique discussed in this paper."

https://openalex.org/W1546684928,"By publishing an alternative, and decidedly upbeat, scenario for how greenhouse warming might play out in the next half-century, the director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City hoped to open new prospects for attacking the problem. Instead, he got a lot of grief."
https://openalex.org/W1552304531,"Just a few weeks after two physicists won the Nobel Prize for figuring out how to make lasers out of semiconductors, researchers announced that they have made those lasers much more useful. A new technique permits the lasers to shine light in regions of the infrared spectrum previously inaccessible to similar devices. The advance may open the door to cheap devices to sniff explosives and other robotic sensors."
