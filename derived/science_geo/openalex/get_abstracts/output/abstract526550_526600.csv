https://openalex.org/W2024181148,"Canonical Wnt and Nodal signaling are both required for induction of the primitive streak (PS), which guides organization of the early embryo. The Wnt effector β-catenin is thought to function in these early lineage specification decisions via transcriptional activation of Nodal signaling. Here, we demonstrate a broader role for β-catenin in PS formation by analyzing its genome-wide binding in a human embryonic stem cell model of PS induction. β-catenin occupies regulatory regions in numerous PS and neural crest genes, and direct interactions between β-catenin and the Nodal effectors SMAD2/SMAD3 are required at these regions for PS gene activation. Furthermore, OCT4 binding in proximity to these sites is likewise required for PS induction, suggesting a collaborative interaction between β-catenin and OCT4. Induction of neural crest genes by β-catenin is repressed by SMAD2/SMAD3, ensuring proper lineage specification. This study provides mechanistic insight into how Wnt signaling controls early cell lineage decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2093068860,"Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) display extensive epigenetic instability, particularly on the X chromosome. In this study, we show that, in hPSCs, the inactive X chromosome has a specific heterochromatin landscape that predisposes it to erosion of X chromosome inactivation (XCI), a process that occurs spontaneously in hPSCs. Heterochromatin remodeling and gene reactivation occur in a non-random fashion and are confined to specific H3K27me3-enriched domains, leaving H3K9me3-marked regions unaffected. Using single-cell monitoring of XCI erosion, we show that this instability only occurs in pluripotent cells. We also provide evidence that loss of XIST expression is not the primary cause of XCI instability and that gene reactivation from the inactive X (Xi) precedes loss of XIST coating. Notably, expression and coating by the long non-coding RNA XACT are early events in XCI erosion and, therefore, may play a role in mediating this process."
https://openalex.org/W2069178599,"Fish faced with stressful stimuli launch an endocrine stress response through activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI-) axis to release cortisol into the blood. Scientifically validated biomarkers to capture systemic cortisol exposure over longer periods of time are of utmost importance to assess chronic stress in governmental, wildlife, aquaculture and scientific settings. Here we demonstrate that cortisol in scales of common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) is the long-sought biomarker for chronic stress. Undisturbed (CTR) and daily stressed (STRESS) carp were compared. Dexamethasone (DEX) or cortisol (CORT) fed fish served as negative and positive controls, respectively. Scale cortisol was quantified with a validated ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method. An increase in scale cortisol content was found in STRESS and CORT but not in CTR and DEX fish. Scale cortisol content reflects its accumulation in a stressor and time dependent manner and validates the scale cortisol content as biomarker for chronic stress. Plasma analyses confirmed that (i) CTR, DEX and CORT treatments were effective, (ii) plasma cortisol of STRESS fish showed no signs of chronic HPI-axis activation, and (iii) plasma cortisol is a poor predictor for chronic stress. The expression of HPI key genes crf, pomc, and star were up-regulated in STRESS fish in the absence of a plasma cortisol response, as was the target gene of cortisol encoding subunit α1 of the Na+/K+-ATPase in gills. When lost, scales of fish regenerate fast. Regenerated scales corroborate our findings, offering (i) unsurpassed time resolution for cortisol incorporation and as such for stressful events, and (ii) the possibility to investigate stress in a well defined and controlled environment and time frame creating novel opportunities for bone physiological research. We conclude that the cortisol content in ontogenetic and regenerated scales is an innovative biomarker for chronic stress offering ample applications in science and industry."
https://openalex.org/W2090024902,"The selenoenzyme Gpx4 is essential for early embryogenesis and cell viability for its unique function to prevent phospholipid oxidation. Recently, the cytosolic form of Gpx4 was identified as an upstream regulator of a novel form of non-apoptotic cell death, called ferroptosis, whereas the mitochondrial isoform of Gpx4 was previously shown to be crucial for male fertility. Here, we generated and analyzed mice with a targeted mutation of the active site selenocysteine of Gpx4 (Gpx4_U46S). Mice homozygous for Gpx4_U46S died at the same embryonic stage (E7.5) as Gpx4−/− embryos as expected. Surprisingly, male mice heterozygous for Gpx4_U46S presented subfertility. Subfertility was manifested in a reduced number of litters from heterozygous breeding and an impairment of spermatozoa to fertilize oocytes in vitro. Morphologically, sperm isolated from heterozygous Gpx4_U46S mice revealed many structural abnormalities particularly in the spermatozoa midpiece due to improper oxidation and polymerization of sperm capsular proteins and malformation of the mitochondrial capsule surrounding and stabilizing sperm mitochondria. These findings are reminiscent of sperm isolated from selenium-deprived rodents or from mice specifically lacking mitochondrial Gpx4. Due to a strongly facilitated incorporation of Ser in the polypeptide chain as compared with selenocysteine at the UGA codon, expression of the catalytically inactive Gpx4_U46S was found to be strongly increased. Because the stability of the mitochondrial capsule of mature spermatozoa depends on the moonlighting function of Gpx4 both as an enzyme oxidizing capsular protein thiols and as a structural protein, tightly controlled expression of functional Gpx4 emerges as a key for full male fertility.Background: The selenoperoxidase (Gpx4) is essential for embryogenesis, adult tissue function, and spermatogenesis.Results: Homozygous expression of Gpx4 with a targeted substitution of selenocysteine to serine causes early embryonic death as expected but, unexpectedly, male subfertility in heterozygous mice.Conclusion: Heterozygous expression of a catalytically inactive mutant form of Gpx4 impairs spermatogenesis.Significance: Well-balanced expression of wild type Gpx4 is prerequisite for proper sperm development.

https://openalex.org/W2022708180,"Clostridium difficile is responsible for 15-20% of antibiotic-associated diarrheas, and nearly all cases of pseudomembranous colitis. Among the cell wall proteins involved in the colonization process, Cwp84 is a protease that cleaves the S-layer protein SlpA into two subunits. A cwp84 mutant was previously shown to be affected for in vitro growth but not in its virulence in a hamster model. In this study, the cwp84 mutant elaborated biofilms with increased biomass compared with the parental strain, allowing the mutant to grow more robustly in the biofilm state. Proteomic analyses of the 630Δerm bacteria growing within the biofilm revealed the distribution of abundant proteins either in cell surface, matrix or supernatant fractions. Of note, the toxin TcdA was found in the biofilm matrix. Although the overall proteome differences between the cwp84 mutant and the parental strains were modest, there was still a significant impact on bacterial surface properties such as altered hydrophobicity. In vitro and in vivo competition assays revealed that the mutant was significantly impaired for growth only in the planktonic state, but not in biofilms or in vivo. Taken together, our results suggest that the phenotypes in the cwp84 mutant come from either the accumulation of uncleaved SlpA, or the ability of Cwp84 to cleave as yet undetermined proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1994797165,"This research investigated how an individual’s endorsements of mitigation and adaptation relate to each other, and how well each of these can be accounted for by relevant social psychological factors. Based on survey data from two European convenience samples (N = 616 / 309) we found that public endorsements of mitigation and adaptation are strongly associated: Someone who is willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (mitigation) is also willing to prepare for climate change impacts (adaptation). Moreover, people endorsed the two response strategies for similar reasons: People who believe that climate change is real and dangerous, who have positive attitudes about protecting the environment and the climate, and who perceive climate change as a risk, are willing to respond to climate change. Furthermore, distinguishing between (spatially) proximal and distant risk perceptions suggested that the idea of portraying climate change as a proximal (i.e., local) threat might indeed be effective in promoting personal actions. However, to gain endorsement of broader societal initiatives such as policy support, it seems advisable to turn to the distant risks of climate change. The notion that “localising” climate change might not be the panacea for engaging people in this domain is discussed in regard to previous theory and research."
https://openalex.org/W1978048291,"The liver is a major site of glucose, fatty acid, and triglyceride (TG) synthesis and serves as a major regulator of whole body nutrient homeostasis. Chronic exposure of humans or rodents to high-calorie diets promotes non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, characterized by neutral lipid accumulation in lipid droplets (LD) of hepatocytes. Here we show that the LD protein hypoxia-inducible gene 2 (Hig2/Hilpda) functions to enhance lipid accumulation in hepatocytes by attenuating TG hydrolysis. Hig2 expression increased in livers of mice on a high-fat diet and during fasting, two states associated with enhanced hepatic TG content. Hig2 expressed in primary mouse hepatocytes localized to LDs and promoted LD TG deposition in the presence of oleate. Conversely, tamoxifen-inducible Hig2 deletion reduced both TG content and LD size in primary hepatocytes from mice harboring floxed alleles of Hig2 and a cre/ERT2 transgene controlled by the ubiquitin C promoter. Hepatic TG was also decreased by liver-specific deletion of Hig2 in mice with floxed Hig2 expressing cre controlled by the albumin promoter. Importantly, we demonstrate that Hig2-deficient hepatocytes exhibit increased TG lipolysis, TG turnover, and fatty acid oxidation as compared with controls. Interestingly, mice with liver-specific Hig2 deletion also display improved glucose tolerance. Taken together, these data indicate that Hig2 plays a major role in promoting lipid sequestration within LDs in mouse hepatocytes through a mechanism that impairs TG degradation.

Chronic exposure of humans or rodents to high-calorie diets can lead to a disease spectrum known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (2.Charlton M.

Overabundance of liver lipids has also been associated with insulin resistance in both humans and rodents (4.Birkenfeld A.L. Shulman G.I.

In all cells including hepatocytes, neutral lipids are stored in organelles termed lipid droplets (LDs) (6.Walther T.C. Farese Jr., R.V. Lipid droplets and cellular lipid metabolism.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 687-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). These LDs are highly dynamic and are regulated by the nutritional status of the organism (7.Brasaemle D.L.

Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 2547-2559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), named for its three founding members Perilipin, Adipophilin, and Tip47 that have PAT domains, and the cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor 45-like effector (CIDE) family (8.Xu L. Zhou L. Li P. CIDE proteins and lipid metabolism.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2012; 32: 1094-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The PAT family has five members (Perilipin 1–5), whereas the CIDE family has three members (Cidea, Cideb, and Cidec/Fsp27). LDs are heterogeneous in their coats, and LD proteins generally demonstrate tissue-specific distribution patterns (9.Greenberg A.S. Coleman R.A. Kraemer F.B. McManaman J.L. Obin M.S. Puri V. Yan Q.W.

In healthy murine liver, Perilipin 2 and Perilipin 3 promote LD formation (10.Patel S. Yang W. Kozusko K. Saudek V. Savage D.B.

Although deletion of Perilipin 3 has not yet been performed, genetic deletion of Perilipin 2 or Cideb ameliorates hepatic steatosis (12.McManaman J.L. Bales E.S. Orlicky D.J. Jackman M. MacLean P.S.

However, in the context of diet-induced obesity and fatty liver, Fsp27 (Cidec in humans) and Cidea are critical for LD formation (8.Xu L. Zhou L. Li P.

These authors also showed that Hig2 co-localized with Perilipin 2 and 3, two LD proteins essential for neutral lipid deposition in healthy liver. Due to the importance of lipid homeostasis and deposition in liver, we examined the role of Hig2 in these processes. Here, we demonstrate that Hig2 localizes to LDs in primary mouse hepatocytes. Importantly, its deletion in hepatocytes in vivo causes depletion of hepatic TG, indicating that it plays a physiological role in regulating liver lipid abundance in mice. Furthermore, we show that the basis for its ability to promote LD formation and TG deposition in liver is through the inhibition of TG lipolysis. All of the studies performed were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Animals were maintained in a 12-h light/dark cycle. Hig2fl/fl animals were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Hilpdatm1.1Nat/J). For metabolic studies, the animals were backcrossed onto C57Bl/6J animals for at least six generations. Genomic DNA was extracted from the obtained mice and subjected to PCR for genotyping using the Qiagen Fast Cycling PCR kit (Hig2fl/fl primer 5′-CCGGCAGGGCCTCCTCTTGCTCCTG-3′, 5′-GTGTGTTGGCTAGCTGACCCCTCGTG-3′). Hig2fl/fl animals were crossed to a tamoxifen-inducible ubiquitous cre mouse line (B6.Cg-Tg(UBC-cre/ERT2)1Ejb/J, The Jackson Laboratory). Hig2fl/fl animals were also crossed to an albumin cre mouse line (C57BL/6-Tg(Alb-cre)21Mgn/J, The Jackson Laboratory). Cre genotyping was performed according to the method of The Jackson Laboratory. At 5–6 weeks of age, male C57Bl/6J, Hig2fl/fl, or Hig2fl/fl albumin cre-positive littermates animals were placed on a high-fat diet (60% fat, 12492i Harlan) or fed chow (Lab Diet 5P76) for 12 or 16 weeks. Mice were fasted 16 h for glucose tolerance tests and 4 h for insulin tolerance tests. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 g/kg of glucose or 1 IU/kg of insulin, blood was drawn from the tail vein at the indicated times, and blood glucose levels were measured with a Breeze-2-glucose meter (Bayer). Mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation followed by bilateral pneumothorax. Mice were fasted for 3 h for plasma lipid analysis. Blood was taken via cardiac puncture, and EDTA-containing plasma was collected. Total serum cholesterol levels (ab65359 Abcam), serum triglyceride levels (triglyceride determination kit, Sigma), serum non-esterified fatty acids (Wako Diagnostics), and β-hydroxybutyrate (Sigma) were measured using calorimetric assays according to the manufacturer's instructions. Insulin levels were measured with an insulin ELISA Kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Whole livers were isolated and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Lipids were extracted from livers or pelleted hepatocytes via the Folch method (24.Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. A simple method for the isolation and purification of total lipides from animal tissues.J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipids were dissolved in isopropanol with 1% Triton X-100. Triglyceride (triglyceride determination kit, Sigma) and cholesteryl ester (ab65359 Abcam) levels were measured using calorimetric assays according to the manufacturer's instructions and normalized to liver weight or hepatocyte protein content. Male or female 8–10-week-old chow-fed animals were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 1:1 ketamine:xylazine and perfused with Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 0.5 m EGTA. Livers were digested with a perfusion of 50 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma, C6885) in Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2, physically dissociated, and filtered through a 100-μm filter. Hepatocytes were washed, centrifuged at low speed, filtered through a 70-μm filter, and plated at a density of 1 million cells/ml. Total RNA was isolated from cells or tissues using the TriPure isolation reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The isolated RNA was DNase-treated (DNA-free, Life Technologies), and cDNA was synthesized using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). RT-quantitative PCR was performed on the Bio-Rad CFX97 using iQ SYBR Green supermix, and 36B4 served as the reference gene. Primer sequences are as follows: 36B4 (5′-TCCAGGCTTTGGGCATCA-3′, 5′-CTTTATCAGCTGCACATCACTCAGA-3′); Hig2 (5′-CATGTTGACCCTGCTTTCCAT-3′, 5′-GCTCTCCAGTAAGCCTCCCA-3′). Tissues and cells were lysed in a high-salt, high-SDS buffer (2% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA) with 1× Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Scientific). Lysates were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE gel run in a 1× Tris-Tricine buffer (National Diagnostics) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blotted with the following antibodies: β-actin (A2228, Sigma), HA-Tag (2367, Cell Signaling Technology). The Hig2 antibody was directed against a 15-amino acid peptide (PPKGLPDHPSRGVGV) at the C terminus of murine Hig2 (Rockland Immunochemicals). Hepatocytes were isolated from male or female 8–10-week-old Hig2fl/fl Ubc ERT2 cre-positive animals, plated in M199 adherence medium (Life Technologies, 11150, supplemented with 2% FBS, 10% BSA, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 100 nm insulin, and 100 nm dexamethasone) for 3 h, changed to M199 maintenance medium (M199 supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 100 nm insulin, and 100 nm dexamethasone), and treated with ethanol vehicle or 2.5 μm (Z)4-hydroxytamoxifen (Sigma H7904) dissolved in filtered ethanol (5 mg/ml) for 48 h before experiments. For imaging experiments, hepatocytes were plated on collagen-coated Millicell 4 chambered slides (Millipore) and transfected with GFP constructs using 1.5 μg of DNA, Opti-MEM, and Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions 48 h prior to experiments. Hepatocytes were also infected with HA-tagged adenoviruses 48 h prior to experiments. Cells were loaded with the indicated concentration of oleic acid (Sigma) dissolved in ethanol and conjugated to 10% fatty acid-free BSA dissolved in 0.1 m Tris pH 8. For radiation experiments, hepatocytes were plated on collagen-coated plates in William's E adherence medium (Life Technologies 12551, supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, 10% BSA (Sigma A4503), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 100 nm insulin, and 100 nm dexamethasone). After 3 h, medium was changed to maintenance medium (William's E medium supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 100 nm insulin, and 100 nm dexamethasone). Cells were fixed in 10% buffered formalin in PBS for 15 min, stained with Oil Red O, and mounted with Prolong Gold with DAPI (Life Technologies). Cells were imaged at room temperature with a Solamere Technology Group modified Yokogawa CSU10 spinning disk confocal system with a Nikon TE-2000E2 inverted microscope at 60× and 100×. Images were acquired with MetaMorph Software, version 6.1 (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA). Lipid droplet analysis was performed on fixed, Oil Red O- and DAPI-stained cells with BioPix iQ imaging software (BioPix AB, Göteborg, Sweden). At least 90 cells were analyzed per condition. Hepatocytes were isolated from male 8–10-week-old Hig2fl/fl or Hig2fl/fl albumin cre-positive animals. 24 h after isolation, cells were loaded with 1 μCi/ml [3H]oleic acid mixed with 100 μm oleic acid conjugated to 0.5% fatty acid-free BSA in William's E medium.

Data were analyzed in GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). A two-tailed Student's t test with Welch's correction was used to compare two groups of data. Where indicated, data were analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures or a linear regression model. p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. The Grubb's test was used to determine whether there were statistical outliers, and if an outlier was determined, it was removed from the statistical analysis. Variance was estimated using S.E. To characterize Hig2 as a potential hepatic LD protein, we first determined whether it localized to LDs in primary mouse hepatocytes. We isolated primary hepatocytes from C57Bl/6J animals and transfected them with either GFP control or GFP-tagged Hig2 constructs and incubated them with oleic acid to induce LD formation. Although the GFP control construct displayed a diffuse, cytoplasmic distribution in the cells, the GFP-Hig2 construct clearly localized around the perimeter of Oil Red O-positive LDs (Fig. 1B). Gimm et al. (20.Gimm T. Wiese M. Teschemacher B. Deggerich A. Schödel J. Knaup K.X. Hackenbeck T. Hellerbrand C. Amann K. Wiesener M.S. Höning S. Eckardt K.U. Warnecke C.

To confirm that this was also the targeting domain in hepatocytes, we created a Hig2 truncation mutant with a loss of amino acids 1–28 of this putative binding domain. When the Hig2 truncation mutant was transfected into primary hepatocytes, it also localized diffusely, similar to the GFP control, demonstrating that Hig2 localizes to LDs in hepatocytes through this putative LD binding domain (Fig. 1B). As Gimm et al. (20.Gimm T. Wiese M. Teschemacher B. Deggerich A. Schödel J. Knaup K.X. Hackenbeck T. Hellerbrand C. Amann K. Wiesener M.S. Höning S. Eckardt K.U. Warnecke C.

Farese Jr., R.V. Walther T.C. The biophysics and cell biology of lipid droplets.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14: 775-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Hepatic LD protein expression is highly sensitive to nutritional status. As both Fsp27 and Cidea, two bona fide liver LD proteins, are highly up-regulated upon high-fat diet (HFD) feeding in mice (8.Xu L. Zhou L. Li P. CIDE proteins and lipid metabolism.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2012; 32: 1094-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we measured Hig2 expression in two situations of hepatic steatosis. Fasting, which liberates lipids from adipose tissue via lipolysis, causes a temporary increase in liver lipids (27.Bechmann L.P. Hannivoort R.A. Gerken G. Hotamisligil G.S. Trauner M. Canbay A. The interaction of hepatic lipid and glucose metabolism in liver diseases.J. Hepatol. 2012; 56: 952-964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Indeed, a 24-h fast caused a 2-fold increase in Hig2 mRNA expression in C57Bl/6J mouse livers (Fig. 1C). Obesity-induced hepatic steatosis in C57Bl/6J mice also caused a significant 2.7-fold increase in Hig2 mRNA expression in liver (Fig. 1D), consistent with the concept that Hig2 expression is highly correlated with liver lipid levels. LD protein overexpression can also promote lipid deposition (7.Brasaemle D.L. Thematic review series: adipocyte biology.

FSP27 contributes to efficient energy storage in murine white adipocytes by promoting the formation of unilocular lipid droplets.J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2808-2821PubMed Google Scholar). We tested whether Hig2 expression modifies TG accumulation in liver by manipulating Hig2 expression in primary mouse hepatocytes. First, we isolated primary hepatocytes from Hig2fl/fl animals and infected them with either control adenovirus (AV) or an AV expressing HA-tagged Hig2. As expected, Hig2-HA AV-infected cells demonstrated increased Hig2-HA levels as compared with controls as determined by Western blot (Fig. 2B). We incubated the cells with 250 μm oleic acid for 24 h to induce LD formation, fixed, and then stained them with Oil Red O to image LDs. Imaging revealed that Hig2-HA AV-infected hepatocytes had significantly more LDs as compared with controls (Fig. 2A). Although there was no significant difference in TG levels in BSA vehicle-treated hepatocytes, Hig2-infected cells demonstrated a 1.5-fold increase in TG content as compared with control cells after oleate loading (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that high Hig2 expression is sufficient to promote lipid deposition in hepatocytes. These results confirmed those of a study"

The miRNA-302 family has been documented as playing a critical role in carcinogenesis. In this study, we investigated the role of miRNA-302a in prostate cancer (PCa). MiRNA-302a expression was detected in 44 PCa tissues and 10 normal prostate tissues, and their clinicopathological significance was analyzed. Cell proliferation and cell cycle analysis were performed on PCa cells that stably expressed miRNA-302a. The target gene of miRNA-302a and the downstream pathway were further investigated. Compared with normal prostate tissues, miRNA-302a expression was downregulated in PCa tissues, and was even lower in PCa tissues with a Gleason score ≥8. Overexpression of miRNA-302a induced G1/S cell cycle arrest in PCa cells, and suppressed PCa cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, miRNA-302a inhibits AKT expression by directly binding to its 3΄ untranslated region, resulting in subsequent alterations of the AKT-GSK3β-cyclin D1 and AKT-p27Kip1 pathway. These results reveal miRNA-302a as a tumor suppressor in PCa, suggesting that miRNA-302a may be used as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in PCa."
https://openalex.org/W1988821830,"Functional brain signals are frequently decomposed into a relatively small set of large scale, distributed cortical networks that are associated with different cognitive functions. It is generally assumed that the connectivity of these networks is static in time and constant over the whole network, although there is increasing evidence that this view is too simplistic. This work proposes novel techniques to investigate the contribution of spontaneous BOLD events to the temporal dynamics of functional connectivity as assessed by ultra-high field functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The results show that: 1) spontaneous events in recognised brain networks contribute significantly to network connectivity estimates; 2) these spontaneous events do not necessarily involve whole networks or nodes, but clusters of voxels which act in concert, forming transiently synchronising sub-networks and 3) a task can significantly alter the number of localised spontaneous events that are detected within a single network. These findings support the notion that spontaneous events are the main driver of the large scale networks that are commonly detected by seed-based correlation and ICA. Furthermore, we found that large scale networks are manifestations of smaller, transiently synchronising sub-networks acting dynamically in concert, corresponding to spontaneous events, and which do not necessarily involve all voxels within the network nodes oscillating in unison."

Here, we have studied the dynamics of Na+ and aspartate binding to GltPh. Tryptophan fluorescence measurements on the fully active single tryptophan mutant F273W revealed that Na+ binds with low affinity to the apoprotein (Kd 120 mm), with a particularly low kon value (5.1 m−1s−1). At least two sodium ions bind before aspartate. The binding of Na+ requires a very high activation energy (Ea 106.8 kJ mol−1) and consequently has a large Q10 value of 4.5, indicative of substantial conformational changes before or after the initial binding event. The apparent affinity for aspartate binding depended on the Na+ concentration present. Binding of aspartate was not observed in the absence of Na+, whereas in the presence of high Na+ concentrations (above the Kd for Na+) the dissociation constants for aspartate were in the nanomolar range, and the aspartate binding was fast (kon of 1.4 × 105 m−1s−1), with low Ea and Q10 values (42.6 kJ mol−1 and 1.8, respectively).

We generated a double-transgenic mouse strain (hpa-hIAPP) that overexpresses human heparanase and human IAPP but is deficient of endogenous mouse IAPP. Culture of hpa-hIAPP islets in 20 mm glucose resulted in less amyloid formation compared with the amyloid load developed in cultured islets isolated from littermates expressing human IAPP only. A similar reduction of amyloid was achieved when human islets were cultured in the presence of heparin fragments. Furthermore, we used CHO cells and the mutant CHO pgsD-677 cell line (deficient in HS synthesis) to explore the effect of cellular HS on IAPP-induced cytotoxicity. Seeding of IAPP aggregation on CHO cells resulted in caspase-3 activation and apoptosis that could be prevented by inhibition of caspase-8. No IAPP-induced apoptosis was seen in HS-deficient CHO pgsD-677 cells. These results suggest that β cell death caused by extracellular IAPP requires membrane-bound HS.

https://openalex.org/W2001430685,"Fibrosis refers to the accumulation of excess extracellular matrix (ECM) components and represents a key feature of many chronic inflammatory diseases. Unfortunately, no currently available treatments specifically target this important pathogenic mechanism. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally repress target gene expression and the development of miRNA-based therapeutics is being actively pursued for a diverse array of diseases. Because a single miRNA can target multiple genes, often within the same pathway, variations in the level of individual miRNAs can potently influence disease phenotypes. Members of the miR-29 family, which include miR-29a, miR-29b and miR-29c, are strong inhibitors of ECM synthesis and fibrosis-associated decreases in miR-29 have been reported in multiple organs. We observed downregulation of miR-29a/b/c in fibrotic livers of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) treated mice as well as in isolated human hepatocytes exposed to the pro-fibrotic cytokine TGF-β. Importantly, we demonstrate that a single systemic injection of a miR-29a expressing adeno-associated virus (AAV) can prevent and even reverse histologic and biochemical evidence of fibrosis despite continued exposure to CCl4. The observed therapeutic benefits were associated with AAV transduction of hepatocytes but not hepatic stellate cells, which are the main ECM producing cells in fibroproliferative liver diseases. Our data therefore demonstrate that delivery of miR-29 to the hepatic parenchyma using a clinically relevant gene delivery platform protects injured livers against fibrosis and, given the consistent fibrosis-associated downregulation of miR-29, suggests AAV-miR-29 based therapies may be effective in treating a variety of fibroproliferative disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2077716593,"Malaria continues to place a disease burden on millions of people throughout the tropics, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Although efforts to control mosquito populations and reduce human-vector contact, such as long-lasting insecticidal nets and indoor residual spraying, have led to significant decreases in malaria incidence, further progress is now threatened by the widespread development of physiological and behavioural insecticide-resistance as well as changes in the composition of vector populations. A mosquito-directed push-pull system based on the simultaneous use of attractive and repellent volatiles offers a complementary tool to existing vector-control methods. In this study, the combination of a trap baited with a five-compound attractant and a strip of net-fabric impregnated with micro-encapsulated repellent and placed in the eaves of houses, was tested in a malaria-endemic village in western Kenya. Using the repellent delta-undecalactone, mosquito house entry was reduced by more than 50%, while the traps caught high numbers of outdoor flying mosquitoes. Model simulations predict that, assuming area-wide coverage, the addition of such a push-pull system to existing prevention efforts will result in up to 20-fold reductions in the entomological inoculation rate. Reductions of such magnitude are also predicted when mosquitoes exhibit a high resistance against insecticides. We conclude that a push-pull system based on non-toxic volatiles provides an important addition to existing strategies for malaria prevention."

Current treatments for fungal infections are limited by drug toxicity and pathogen resistance. Cm-p5 (SRSELIVHQRLF), a peptide derived from the marine mollusk Cenchritis muricatus peptide Cm-p1, has a significantly increased fungistatic activity against pathogenic Candida albicans (minimal inhibitory concentration, 10 µg/ml; EC50, 1.146 µg/ml) while exhibiting low toxic effects against a cultured mammalian cell line. Cm-p5 as characterized by circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance revealed an α-helical structure in membrane-mimetic conditions and a tendency to random coil folding in aqueous solutions. Additional studies modeling Cm-p5 binding to a phosphatidylserine bilayer in silico and isothermal titration calorimetry using lipid monophases demonstrated that Cm-p5 has a high affinity for the phospholipids of fungal membranes (phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine), only moderate interactions with a mammalian membrane phospholipid, low interaction with ergosterol, and no interaction with chitin. Adhesion of Cm-p5 to living C. albicans cells was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy with FITC-labeled peptide. In a systemic candidiasis model in mice, intraperitoneal administration of Cm-p5 was unable to control the fungal kidney burden, although its low amphiphaticity could be modified to generate new derivatives with improved fungicidal activity and stability."
https://openalex.org/W2034868571,"We present a simple framework for classifying mutually exclusive behavioural states within the geospatial lifelines of animals. This method involves use of three sequentially applied statistical procedures: (1) behavioural change point analysis to partition movement trajectories into discrete bouts of same-state behaviours, based on abrupt changes in the spatio-temporal autocorrelation structure of movement parameters; (2) hierarchical multivariate cluster analysis to determine the number of different behavioural states; and (3) k-means clustering to classify inferred bouts of same-state location observations into behavioural modes. We demonstrate application of the method by analysing synthetic trajectories of known 'artificial behaviours' comprised of different correlated random walks, as well as real foraging trajectories of little penguins (Eudyptula minor) obtained by global-positioning-system telemetry. Our results show that the modelling procedure correctly classified 92.5% of all individual location observations in the synthetic trajectories, demonstrating reasonable ability to successfully discriminate behavioural modes. Most individual little penguins were found to exhibit three unique behavioural states (resting, commuting/active searching, area-restricted foraging), with variation in the timing and locations of observations apparently related to ambient light, bathymetry, and proximity to coastlines and river mouths. Addition of k-means clustering extends the utility of behavioural change point analysis, by providing a simple means through which the behaviours inferred for the location observations comprising individual movement trajectories can be objectively classified."
https://openalex.org/W2164881817,"Prostaglandin (PG) E2 exhibits an anti-fibrotic effect in the lung in response to inflammatory reactions and is a high-affinity substrate of PG transporter (SLCO2A1). The present study aimed to evaluate the pathophysiological relevance of SLCO2A1 to bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that Slco2a1 protein was expressed in airway and alveolar type I (ATI) and II (ATII) epithelial cells, and electron-microscopic immunohistochemistry further demonstrated cell surface expression of Slco2a1 in ATI cells in wild type (WT) C57BL/6 mice. PGE2 uptake activity was abrogated in ATI-like cells from Slco2a1-deficient (Slco2a1-/-) mice, which was clearly observed in the cells from WT mice. Furthermore, the PGE2 concentrations in lung tissues were lower in Slco2a1-/- than in WT mice. The pathological relevance of SLCO2A1 was further studied in mouse BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis models. BLM (1 mg/kg) or vehicle (phosphate buffered saline) was intratracheally injected into WT and Slco2a1-/- mice, and BLM-induced fibrosis was evaluated on day 14. BLM induced more severe fibrosis in Slco2a1-/- than in WT mice, as indicated by thickened interstitial connective tissue and enhanced collagen deposition. PGE2 levels were higher in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, but lower in lung tissues of Slco2a1-/- mice. Transcriptional upregulation of TGF-β1 was associated with enhanced gene transcriptions of downstream targets including plasminogen activator inhitor-1. Furthermore, Western blot analysis demonstrated a significant activation of protein kinase C (PKC) δ along with a modest activation of Smad3 in lung from Slco2a1-/- mice, suggesting a role of PKCδ associated with TGF-β signaling in aggravated fibrosis in BLM-treated Slco2a1-/- mice. In conclusion, pulmonary PGE2 disposition is largely regulated by SLCO2A1, demonstrating that SLCO2A1 plays a critical role in protecting the lung from BLM-induced fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2062617488,"The recent rise in obesity is widely attributed to changes in the dietary environment (e.g., increased availability of energy-dense foods and larger portion sizes). However, a critical feature of our ""obesogenic environment"" may have been overlooked - the dramatic increase in ""dietary variability"" (the tendency for specific mass-produced foods to be available in numerous varieties that differ in energy content). In this study we tested the hypothesis that dietary variability compromises the control of food intake in humans. Specifically, we examined the effects of dietary variability in pepperoni pizza on two key outcome variables; i) compensation for calories in pepperoni pizza and ii) expectations about the satiating properties of pepperoni pizza (expected satiation). We reasoned that dietary variability might generate uncertainty about the postingestive effects of a food. An internet-based questionnaire was completed by 199 adults. This revealed substantial variation in exposure to different varieties of pepperoni pizza. In a follow-up study (n= 66; 65% female), high pizza variability was associated with i) poorer compensation for calories in pepperoni pizza and ii) lower expected satiation for pepperoni pizza. Furthermore, the effect of uncertainty on caloric compensation was moderated by individual differences in decision making (loss aversion). For the first time, these findings highlight a process by which dietary variability may compromise food-intake control in humans. This is important because it exposes a new feature of Western diets (processed foods in particular) that might contribute to overeating and obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2001323937,"The existence of redundant replication and repair systems that ensure genome stability underscores the importance of faithful DNA replication. Nowhere is this complexity more evident than in challenging DNA templates, including highly repetitive or transcribed sequences. Here, we demonstrate that flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1), a canonical lagging strand DNA replication protein, is required for normal, complete leading strand replication at telomeres. We find that the loss of FEN1 nuclease activity, but not DNA repair activities, results in leading strand-specific telomere fragility. Furthermore, we show that FEN1 depletion-induced telomere fragility is increased by RNA polymerase II inhibition and is rescued by ectopic RNase H1 expression. These data suggest that FEN1 limits leading strand-specific telomere fragility by processing RNA:DNA hybrid/flap intermediates that arise from co-directional collisions occurring between the replisome and RNA polymerase. Our data reveal the first molecular mechanism for leading strand-specific telomere fragility and the first known role for FEN1 in leading strand DNA replication. Because FEN1 mutations have been identified in human cancers, our findings raise the possibility that unresolved RNA:DNA hybrid structures contribute to the genomic instability associated with cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2003908120,"Background Sexual violence is a major public health issue, affecting 35% of women worldwide. Major risk factors for sexual assault include inadequate indoor sanitation and the need to travel to outdoor toilet facilities. We estimated how increasing the number of toilets in an urban township (Khayelitsha, South Africa) might reduce both economic costs and the incidence and social burden of sexual assault. Methods We developed a mathematical model that links risk of sexual assault to the number of sanitation facilities and the time a woman must spend walking to a toilet. We defined a composite societal cost function, comprising both the burden of sexual assault and the costs of installing and maintaining public chemical toilets. By expressing total social costs as a function of the number of available toilets, we were able to identify an optimal (i.e., cost-minimizing) social investment in toilet facilities. Findings There are currently an estimated 5600 toilets in Khayelitsha. This results in 635 sexual assaults and US$40 million in combined social costs each year. Increasing the number of toilets to 11300 would minimize total costs ($35 million) and reduce sexual assaults to 446. Higher toilet installation and maintenance costs would be more than offset by lower sexual assault costs. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis shows that the optimal number of toilets exceeds the original allocation of toilets in the township in over 80% of the 5000 iterations of the model. Interpretation Improving access to sanitation facilities in urban settlements will simultaneously reduce the incidence of sexual assaults and overall cost to society. Since our analysis ignores the many additional health benefits of improving sanitation in resource-constrained urban areas (e.g., potential reductions in waterborne infectious diseases), the optimal number of toilets identified here should be interpreted as conservative."

We aimed to garner preliminary data on the real-world use of olanzapine and aripiprazole as augmentation agents of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) in adult inpatients affected by AN. We retrospectively evaluated the clinical charts of patients who were hospitalized between 2012 and 2014. Patients were evaluated upon admission and discharge. We investigated eating symptomatology, and both general and eating psychopathology using: Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and Yale-Brown-Cornell Eating Disorders Scale. The charts of 75 patients were included in this study. The sample resulted equally distributed among those receiving SSRIs and either aripiprazole or olanzapine in addition to SSRIs. Notwithstanding a few baseline clinical differences, upon discharge all groups were significantly improved on all measures. Interestingly, aripiprazole showed the greatest effectiveness in reducing eating-related preoccupations and rituals with a large effect size. The body of evidence on medication management in AN is in dismal condition. Augmentation therapy is a well-established approach to a variety of mental disorders and it is often used in every-day clinical practice with patients affected by AN as well. Nevertheless, to date very little data is available on this topic. Results from our sample yielded promising results on the effectiveness of aripiprazole augmentation in reducing eating-related obsessions and compulsions. Randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm these encouraging findings."

Allophycocyanin (APC) is the phycobiliprotein always found in the PBS core complex. Phycocyanobilin (PCB) chromophores, covalently bound to conserved Cys residues of α- and β- subunits of APC, are responsible for solar energy absorption from phycocyanin and for transfer to photosynthetic apparatus. In the known APC structures, heterodimers of α- and β- subunits (known as αβ monomers) assemble as trimer or hexamer. We here for the first time report the crystal structure of APC isolated from a marine cyanobacterium (Phormidium sp. A09DM). The crystal structure has been refined against all the observed data to the resolution of 2.51 Å to Rwork (Rfree) of 0.158 (0.229) with good stereochemistry of the atomic model. The Phormidium protein exists as a trimer of αβ monomers in solution and in crystal lattice. The overall tertiary structures of α- and β- subunits, and trimeric quaternary fold of the Phormidium protein resemble the other known APC structures. Also, configuration and conformation of the two covalently bound PCB chromophores in the marine APC are same as those observed in fresh water cyanobacteria and marine red algae. More hydrophobic residues, however, constitute the environment of the chromophore bound to α-subunit of the Phormidium protein, owing mainly to amino acid substitutions in the marine protein."

Although there is evidence to support this notion, few studies have focused on Facts Up Front type symbols which are used in the US. Participants with varying levels of prior knowledge were asked to view two products and decide which was more healthful. FOPs on packages were manipulated so that one product was more healthful, allowing us to assess accuracy. Attention to nutrition information was assessed via eye tracking to determine what if any FOP information was used to make their decisions. Results showed that accuracy was below chance on half of the comparisons despite consulting FOPs. Negative correlations between attention to calories, fat, and sodium and accuracy indicated that consumers over-relied on these nutrients. Although relatively little attention was allocated to fiber and sugar, associations between attention and accuracy were positive. Attention to vitamin D showed no association to accuracy, indicating confusion surrounding what constitutes a meaningful change across products. Greater nutrition knowledge was associated with greater accuracy, even when less attention was paid. Individuals, particularly those with less knowledge, are misled by calorie, sodium, and fat information on FOPs."
https://openalex.org/W1995554298,"The NF-κB transcriptional response is tightly regulated by a number of processes including the phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and subsequent proteasomal degradation of NF-κB subunits. The IκB family protein BCL-3 stabilizes a NF-κB p50 homodimer·DNA complex through inhibition of p50 ubiquitination. This complex inhibits the binding of the transcriptionally active NF-κB subunits p65 and c-Rel on the promoters of NF-κB target genes and functions to suppress inflammatory gene expression. We have previously shown that the direct interaction between p50 and BCL-3 is required for BCL-3-mediated inhibition of pro-inflammatory gene expression. In this study we have used immobilized peptide array technology to define regions of BCl-3 that mediate interaction with p50 homodimers. Our data show that BCL-3 makes extensive contacts with p50 homodimers and in particular with ankyrin repeats (ANK) 1, 6, and 7, and the N-terminal region of Bcl-3. Using these data we have designed a BCL-3 mimetic peptide based on a region of the ANK1 of BCL-3 that interacts with p50 and shares low sequence similarity with other IκB proteins. When fused to a cargo carrying peptide sequence this BCL-3-derived peptide, but not a mutated peptide, inhibited Toll-like receptor-induced cytokine expression in vitro. The BCL-3 mimetic peptide was also effective in preventing inflammation in vivo in the carrageenan-induced paw edema mouse model. This study demonstrates that therapeutic strategies aimed at mimicking the functional activity of BCL-3 may be effective in the treatment of inflammatory disease."

Here, we show that gastrin stimulation of DLD-1 colon carcinoma cells acts through CCK2R to promote Gα13-stimulated FAK Tyr-97 and paxillin Tyr-31 tyrosine phosphorylation, RhoA GTP binding, and the activation of SRE reporter transcription. We find that Gα13 activates Rgnef utilizing a previously uncharacterized domain within the Rgnef C-terminal region in close proximity to the Rgnef-FAK-binding site. These results establish Rgnef as a new effector of Gα13 in the control of cell migration downstream of gastrin. Antibodies to Gα13 (32.Aragay A.M. Collins L.R. Post G.R. Watson A.J. Feramisco J.R.

Plasmid for GST-RhoAG17A was a generous gift from K. Burridge (University of North Carolina). HEK293, HEK293T, and DLD-1 cells were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen) and 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin (Lonza) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C. Prior to cell treatments, cells were serum-starved for 16 h. Cells were stimulated with gastrin at 200 nm in serum-free medium for the indicated time periods. For transient transfections, cells were plated at 60–70% confluence, and after 24 h, cells were transfected utilizing FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) or Metafectene Pro (Biontex) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein expression was evaluated 24–48 h after transfection. Gα13 short hairpin-interfering RNA (shRNA) targeted against human GNA13 (TRCN0000036885, Mission shRNA, Sigma) was used for stable knockdown in DLD-1 cells. For lentivirus production, HEK293T were co-transfected with pLKO.1 vectors containing the shRNA vector together with pCMVΔR8.91 (HIV Gag and Pol) and pVSVG at a ratio of 4:3:1, respectively. Medium was collected every 24 h for 2 days and sterile-filtered (0.45-μm MCE filter, Millipore). Viral particles were stored at −80 °C. To infect cells by spinoculation, 1 ml of the viral particle supernatant was added to cells, and plates were centrifuged at 1200 × g for 2 h at room temperature. After 24 h, infected cells were selected by adding 2 μg/ml of puromycin (Sigma). The efficiency of shRNA knockdown was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of protein extracts.

Supernatants were incubated with 200 μl of 50% glutathione-Sepharose 4B slurry (GE Healthcare) for 45–60 min at 4 °C with rotation. GST-RBD beads were washed six times in RBD wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors), and GST-RhoAG17A beads were washed twice in RhoAG17A lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, and protein inhibitors) and two more times with HBS wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT). Bead-associated GST-RBD and GST-RhoAG17A protein concentration was estimated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining alongside BSA protein standards. Bead aliquots were stored at −80 °C in 10% glycerol. Cells were transfected with Rgnef and/or Gα13 plasmids utilizing MetafecteneTM Pro (Biontex) and serum-starved overnight 24 h post-transfection.

Modified Bradford assays were used to determine protein concentration (Bio-Rad). Aliquots were mixed with SDS sample buffer and stored at −20 °C as total protein lysates. Lysates of equal protein content were incubated with 30–40 μg of GST-Rhotekin RBD immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for 45–60 min at 4 °C by rotation. Beads were washed four times with 4 °C RBD wash buffer and activated RhoA eluted with SDS sample buffer addition and detected by monoclonal anti-RhoA immunoblotting. HEK293 cells expressing Rgnef and Gα proteins were lysed in ice-cold RhoAG17A lysis buffer.

https://openalex.org/W1994134731,"Background African Americans (AAs) have lower circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3] concentrations and higher prostate cancer (CaP) aggressiveness than other racial/ethnic groups. The purpose of the current study was to examine the relationship between plasma 25(OH)D3, African ancestry and CaP aggressiveness among AAs and European Americans (EAs). Methods Plasma 25(OH)D3 was measured using LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry) in 537 AA and 663 EA newly-diagnosed CaP patients from the North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project (PCaP) classified as having either ‘high’ or ‘low’ aggressive disease based on clinical stage, Gleason grade and prostate specific antigen at diagnosis. Mean plasma 25(OH)D3 concentrations were compared by proportion of African ancestry. Logistic regression was used to calculate multivariable adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) for high aggressive CaP by tertile of plasma 25(OH)D3. Results AAs with highest percent African ancestry (>95%) had the lowest mean plasma 25(OH)D3 concentrations. Overall, plasma 25(OH)D3 was associated positively with aggressiveness among AA men, an association that was modified by calcium intake (ORT3vs.T1: 2.23, 95%CI: 1.26–3.95 among men with low calcium intake, and ORT3vs.T1: 0.19, 95%CI: 0.05–0.70 among men with high calcium intake). Among EAs, the point estimates of the ORs were <1.0 for the upper tertiles with CIs that included the null. Conclusions Among AAs, plasma 25(OH)D3 was associated positively with CaP aggressiveness among men with low calcium intake and inversely among men with high calcium intake. The clinical significance of circulating concentrations of 25(OH)D3 and interactions with calcium intake in the AA population warrants further study."

The aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of the clinical trials on stem cell-based therapy after PAD. We searched for clinical trials that investigated the effect of stem cell-based therapy on patients with PAD and were published between January 2000 and October 2014. The outcomes of interest comprised all-cause mortality, amputation rate, ulcer healing, and ankle-brachial index (ABI). In addition, pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the safety and efficacy of the stem cell-based therapies for PAD. Thirteen studies were retrieved from 261 citations for the analysis, and in total, 527 patients (mean age: 64.2 years; median follow up: 6 months) were included in the analysis. After synthesizing data, the meta-analysis showed significant improvement in the amputation rate (OR=0.33, 95%CI=0.22-0.51; P<0.001), ulcer healing (OR=6.11, 95%CI=3.04-12.28; P<0.001), and ABI (SMD=0.65, 95%CI=0.33-0.97; P<0.001) for the stem cell-based therapy group compared with the controls. Moreover, significant improvement in the amputation rate, ulcer healing, and ABI were also found based on the time point and stem cell source. In addition, no significant difference was found in the all-cause mortality (OR=0.80, 95%CI=0.39-1.641; P=0.546) between the stem cell-based therapy and control groups. Therefore, according to the results of our meta-analysis, stem cell-based therapy is safe and shows a beneficial outcome for patients with PAD, especially in the short term."
https://openalex.org/W2118427619,"Granulosa cells support the developing oocytes and serve as transducers of the ovulatory stimulus induced by LH surge. Fyn kinase is expressed in granulosa cells, though its role in these cells has not been studied. In human embryonic kidney 293T cells, microRNA (miR)-125a-3p down-regulates Fyn expression, causing a decrease in cells' migratory ability. Our aim was to explore the role of miR-125a-3p and Fyn in granulosa cells toward ovulation, focusing on migration as a possible mechanism. We demonstrate expression of miR-125a-3p and Fyn in mouse mural granulosa cells of preovulatory follicles and miR-125a-3p-induced down-regulation of Fyn expression in a granulosa cell line (rat). Administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG; LH analog) caused a 75% decrease in the in vivo miR-125a-3p:Fyn mRNA ratio, followed by a 2-fold increased migratory ability of mural granulosa cells. In the hCG-treated granulosa cell line, miR-125a-3p expression was decreased, followed by Fyn up-regulation and phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and paxillin, enabling cell migration. An in vivo interference with miR-125a-3p:Fyn mRNA ratio in granulosa cells by intrabursal injections of Fyn small interfering RNA or miR-125a-3p mimic caused a 33 or 55% decrease in the number of ovulated oocytes, respectively. These observations reveal a new regulatory pathway in mural granulosa cells under the regulation of LH/hCG. Modulation of cell migration may account for the significance of the LH/hCG-miR-125a-3p-Fyn pathway to ovulation."

Currently, there is no optimal animal model of FA for the screening of immunotherapies or for testing the allergenicity of new foods.The aim of the present study was to develop an effective and rapid model of FA in Brown Norway rats. In order to establish biomarkers of FA in rat, we compared the immune response and the anaphylactic shock obtained in this model with those achieved with only intraperitoneal immunization.Rats received an intraperitoneal injection of ovalbumin (OVA) with alum and toxin from Bordetella pertussis, and 14 days later, OVA by oral route daily for three weeks (FA group). A group of rats receiving only the i.p. injection (IP group) were also tested. Serum anti-OVA IgE, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgA antibodies were quantified throughout the study. After an oral challenge, body temperature, intestinal permeability, motor activity, and mast cell protease II (RMCP-II) levels were determined. At the end of the study, anti-OVA intestinal IgA, spleen cytokine production, lymphocyte composition of Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes, and gene expression in the small intestine were quantified.Serum OVA-specific IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b concentrations rose with the i.p. immunization but were highly augmented after the oral OVA administration. Anti-OVA IgE increased twofold during the first week of oral OVA gavage. The anaphylaxis in both IP and FA groups decreased body temperature and motor activity, whereas intestinal permeability increased. Interestingly, the FA group showed a much higher RMCP II serum protein and intestinal mRNA expression.These results show both an effective and relatively rapid model of FA assessed by means of specific antibody titres and the high production of RMCP-II and its intestinal gene expression."

Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey among healthcare workers (HCWs) in Kigali during 2010. We purposively selected the public referral hospital, both district hospitals, and randomly selected 7 of 17 health centers. School workers (SWs) from the nearest willing public schools served as a local reference group. We tested for latent TB infection (LTBI) using tuberculin skin testing (TST) and asked about past TB disease. We assessed risk of LTBI and past history of TB disease associated with hospital employment. Among HCWs, we assessed risk associated with facility type (district hospital, referral hospital, health center), work setting (inpatient, outpatient), and occupation. Results Age, gender, and HIV status was similar between the enrolled 1,131 HCWs and 381 SWs. LTBI was more prevalent among HCWs (62%) than SWs (39%). Adjusted odds of a positive TST result were 2.71 (95% CI 2.01–3.67) times greater among HCWs than SWs. Among HCWs, there was no detectable difference between prevalence of LTBI according to facility type, work setting, or occupation. Conclusion HCWs are at greater risk of LTBI, regardless of facility type, work setting, or occupation. The current status of TB infection control practices should be evaluated in the entire workforce in all Rwandan healthcare facilities."
https://openalex.org/W2051639441,"What Is Known about this Subject? Diffusion-weighted MRI has demonstrated changes in the corpus callosum of term neonates with perinatal asphyxia. The severity of cerebral changes demonstrated using diffusion-weighted MRI is difficult to assess without measuring values of the Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC). What Is New? ADC values of the anterior part of the corpus callosum are slightly higher than of the posterior part in full term infants with perinatal asphyxia. Low ADC values of the corpus callosum were associated with an adverse outcome in infants with perinatal asphyxia. In infants treated with hypothermia lower ADC values than with normothermia were associated with a poor outcome, supporting neuroprotective effects of hypothermia Background Using MRI, changes can be detected in the corpus callosum (CC) following perinatal asphyxia which are associated with later neurodevelopmental outcome. Aim To study the association between the apparent diffusion coefficient of water (ADC) in the CC on MRI in neonates with perinatal asphyxia and neurodevelopmental outcome at 18 months of age. Subjects, Methods Of 121 infants 32 (26%) died and 13 (11%) survived with an adverse neurological outcome. Sixty-five (54%) received therapeutic hypothermia. MRI was performed within 7 days after birth using a 1.5 T or 3.0 T system, and ADC values were measured in the anterior and posterior CC. The association between ADC and composite outcome (death or abnormal neurodevelopment) was analyzed for both normothermia and hypothermia cases using receiver operating characteristics. Results ADC values of the posterior CC were lower than of the anterior part (mean difference 0.050 x 10-3 mm2/s, p<0.001). Field strength did not affect ADC values. ADC values of the posterior part of the CC were significantly lower in infants with basal ganglia/thalamus or near total brain injury (p<0.001). Lower ADC values were associated with an adverse outcome, but cut-off levels were lower after hypothermia (1.024 x 10-3 mm2/s vs 0.969 x 10-3 mm2/s) Conclusion Low ADC values of the posterior part of the corpus callosum are associated with an adverse outcome in term or near term neonates with perinatal asphyxia.

The sample consisted of 100 Finland-Swedish children in two age groups. About half (n = 52) of the participants were early simultaneous bilinguals, and the other half (n = 48) were monolinguals. As no Finland-Swedish versions of the tests are available at the moment, both tests were translated and adapted to suit this population. The results revealed no difference in the performance between bilingual and monolingual children. This speaks against a cognitive advantage in bilingual children and indicates that development of separate norms for monolingual and bilingual children is not needed for clinical use."

The mechanisms that lead to insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes have not been well understood. In this study, we show that mice deficient in MAPK phosphatase 5 (MKP5) develop insulin resistance spontaneously at an early stage of life and glucose intolerance at a later age. Increased macrophage infiltration in white adipose tissue of young MKP5-deficient mice correlates with the development of insulin resistance. Glucose intolerance in MKP5-deficient mice is accompanied by significantly increased visceral adipose weight, reduced AKT activation, enhanced p38 activity, and increased inflammation in visceral adipose tissue when compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Deficiency of MKP5 resulted in increased inflammatory activation in macrophages. These findings thus demonstrate that MKP5 critically controls inflammation in white adipose tissue and the development of metabolic disorders.

https://openalex.org/W1990294847,"Choline is an essential nutrient, and the amount needed in the diet is modulated by several factors. Given geographical differences in dietary choline intake and disparate frequencies of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in choline metabolism genes between ethnic groups, we tested the hypothesis that 3 SNPs that increase dependence on dietary choline would be under negative selection pressure in settings where choline intake is low: choline dehydrogenase (CHDH) rs12676, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 1 (MTHFD1) rs2236225, and phosphatidylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PEMT) rs12325817. Evidence of negative selection was assessed in 2 populations: one in The Gambia, West Africa, where there is historic evidence of a choline-poor diet, and the other in the United States, with a comparatively choline-rich diet. We used 2 independent methods, and confirmation of our hypothesis was sought via a comparison with SNP data from the Maasai, an East African population with a genetic background similar to that of Gambians but with a traditional diet that is higher in choline. Our results show that frequencies of SNPs known to increase dependence on dietary choline are significantly reduced in the low-choline setting of The Gambia. Our findings suggest that adequate intake levels of choline may have to be reevaluated in different ethnic groups and highlight a possible approach for identifying novel functional SNPs under the influence of dietary selective pressure.—Silver, M.

https://openalex.org/W1967718769,"Production of titanium-dioxide nanomaterials (nano-TiO2) is increasing, leading to potential risks associated with unintended release of these materials into aquatic ecosystems. We investigated the acute effects of nano-TiO2 on metabolic activity and viability of algae and cyanobacteria using high-throughput screening. The responses of three diatoms (Surirella angusta, Cocconeis placentula, Achnanthidium lanceolatum), one green alga (Scenedesmus quadricauda), and three cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa, Gloeocapsa sp., Synechococcus cedrorum) to short-term exposure (15 to 60 min) to a common nano-TiO2 pigment (PW6; average crystallite size 81.5 nm) with simulated solar illumination were assessed. Five concentrations of nano-TiO2 (0.5, 2.5, 5, 10, and 25 mg L-1) were tested and a fluorescent reporter (fluorescein diacetate) was used to assess metabolic activity. Algae were sensitive to nano-TiO2, with all showing decreased metabolic activity after 30-min exposure to the lowest tested concentration. Microscopic observation of algae revealed increased abundance of dead cells with nano-TiO2 exposure. Cyanobacteria were less sensitive to nano-TiO2 than algae, with Gloeocapsa showing no significant decrease in activity with nano-TiO2 exposure and Synechococcus showing an increase in activity. These results suggest that nanomaterial contamination has the potential to alter the distribution of phototrophic microbial taxa within freshwater ecosystems. The higher resistance of cyanobacteria could have significant implications as cyanobacteria represent a less nutritious food source for higher trophic levels and some cyanobacteria can produce toxins and contribute to harmful algal blooms."
https://openalex.org/W2039495828,"Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common life-threatening genetic disease that leads to renal failure. No treatment is available yet to effectively slow disease progression. Renal cyst growth is, at least in part, driven by the presence of growth factors in the lumens of renal cysts, which are enclosed spaces lacking connections to the tubular system. We have shown previously shown that IL13 in cyst fluid leads to aberrant activation of STAT6 via the IL4/13 receptor. Although antagonistic antibodies against many of the growth factors implicated in ADPKD are already available, they are IgG isotype antibodies that are not expected to gain access to renal cyst lumens. Here we demonstrate that targeting antibodies to renal cyst lumens is possible with the use of dimeric IgA (dIgA) antibodies. Using human ADPKD tissues and polycystic kidney disease mouse models, we show that the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) is highly expressed by renal cyst-lining cells. pIgR expression is, in part, driven by aberrant STAT6 pathway activation. pIgR actively transports dIgA from the circulation across the cyst epithelium and releases it into the cyst lumen as secretory IgA. dIgA administered by intraperitoneal injection is preferentially targeted to polycystic kidneys whereas injected IgG is not. Our results suggest that pIgR-mediated transcytosis of antagonistic antibodies in dIgA format can be exploited for targeted therapy in ADPKD."
https://openalex.org/W2063538859,"VEGF-A (VEGF) drives angiogenesis through activation of downstream effectors to promote endothelial cell proliferation and migration. Although VEGF binds both VEGF receptor 1 (R1) and receptor 2 (R2), its proangiogenic effects are attributed to R2. Secreted protein, acidic, rich in cysteine (SPARC) is a matricellular glycoprotein thought to inhibit angiogenesis by preventing VEGF from activating R1, but not R2. Because R2 rather than R1 mediates proangiogenic activities of VEGF, the role of human SPARC in angiogenesis was reevaluated. We confirm that association of SPARC with VEGF inhibits VEGF-induced HUVEC adherence, motility, and proliferation in vitro and blocks VEGF-induced blood vessel formation ex vivo. SPARC decreases VEGF-induced phosphorylation of R2 and downstream effectors ERK, Akt, and p38 MAPK as shown by Western blot and/or phosphoflow analysis. Surface plasmon resonance indicates that SPARC binds slowly to VEGF (0.865 ± 0.02 × 10(4) M(-1) s(-1)) with a Kd of 150 nM, forming a stable complex that dissociates slowly (1.26 ± 0.003 × 10(-3) s(-1)). Only domain III of SPARC binds VEGF, exhibiting a 15-fold higher affinity than full-length SPARC. These findings support a model whereby SPARC regulates angiogenesis by sequestering VEGF, thus restricting the activation of R2 and the subsequent activation of downstream targets critical for endothelial cell functions."

Human glucose transporter 9 (hSLC2A9) is an essential protein that mainly regulates urate/hexose homeostasis in human kidney and liver. hSLC2A9 is a high affinity-low capacity hexose transporter and a high capacity urate transporter. Our previous studies identified a single hydrophobic residue in trans-membrane domain 7 of class II glucose transporters as a determinant of fructose transport. A mutation of isoleucine 335 to valine (I355V) in hSLC2A9 can reduce fructose transport while not affecting glucose fluxes. This current study demonstrates that the I335V mutant transports urate similarly to the wild type hSLC2A9; however, Ile-335 is necessary for urate/fructose trans-acceleration exchange to occur. Furthermore, Trp-110 is a critical site for urate transport. Two structural models of the class II glucose transporters, hSLC2A9 and hSLC2A5, based on the crystal structure of hSLC2A1 (GLUT1), reveal that Ile-335 (or the homologous Ile-296 in hSLC2A5) is a key component for protein conformational changes when the protein translocates substrates. The hSLC2A9 model also predicted that Trp-110 is a crucial site that could directly interact with urate during transport. Together, these studies confirm that hSLC2A9 transports both urate and fructose, but it interacts with them in different ways. Therefore, this study advances our understanding of how hSLC2A9 mediates urate and fructose transport, providing further information for developing pharmacological agents to treat hyperuricemia and related diseases, such as gout, hypertension, and diabetes.

Initially, hSLC2A9 was shown to be a high affinity-low capacity glucose and fructose transporter; however, more recently studies have demonstrated that it is also a high capacity urate transporter, playing a key role in the handling of this important metabolite in humans. Detailed characterization of hSLC2A9 indicates that this transporter exhibits hexose/hexose trans-acceleration and hexose/urate exchange across the cell membrane (13.Caulfield M.J. Munroe P.B.

That is, hexose on one side of the membrane can stimulate the unidirectional flow of hexose or urate from the other side of the membrane. This trans-acceleration exchange behavior provides confirmation that hexoses and urate share the same transporter despite the observation that there is little or no competition for transport between these substrates (13.Caulfield M.J.

Physiol. 2012; 303: F527-F539Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although trans-acceleration has been reported for a number of other members of this gene family, such as hSLC2A1, the exact mechanism for this interaction, particularly for hexoses and urate by hSLC2A9, remains unknown. Extensive analysis has predicted that the SLC2As all have twelve transmembrane domains (TMs) with both carboxyl and amino termini and a long loop that connects TM6 and TM7, presenting to the cytosol (15.Mueckler M. Thorens B. The SLC2 (GLUT) family of membrane transporters.Mol. Aspects Med. 2013; 34: 121-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). The recent report by Deng et al. (16.Deng D. Xu C. Sun P. Wu J. Yan C. Hu M. Yan N. Crystal structure of the human glucose transporter GLUT1.Nature. 2014; 510: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) provides the first crystal structure for SLC2A1 and has now confirmed this topology. However, some features such as an intracellular helical bundle (ICH) domain, formed by the intracellular loop, which apparently closes the inner vestibule when the protein is in the outward-facing conformation, appears to be novel. TM7, long suspected to form part of the lining of the translocation pore with several key residues potentially involved in substrate binding and selectivity, is confirmed by this first SLC2A1 crystal structure. We previously proposed that residues in this pore-lining helix, TM7, play key roles in determining substrate specificity. We have also shown that a single hydrophobic residue in the TM7 of several of the class II glucose transporters (hSLC2A5, 7, -9, and -11) and SLC2A2 markedly affects their ability to transport fructose but not glucose (17.Manolescu A.R. Augustin R. Moley K. Cheeseman C.

Biol. 2007; 24: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). An early computer model of hSLC2A7, based on the glycerol 3-phosphate transporter (GlpT), predicted that the isoleucine residue, Ile-314, in TM7 faces the aqueous pore and could potentially interact with a second hydrophobic residue, Trp-89, on the other side of the pore in TM2. This interaction was proposed to form a substrate selectivity filter, which determined the ability of fructose to access the translocation mechanism (18.Manolescu A. Salas-Burgos A.M. Fischbarg J. Cheeseman C.I. Identification of a hydrophobic residue as a key determinant of fructose transport by the facilitative hexose transporter SLC2A7 (GLUT7).J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42978-42983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Substitution of the equivalent isoleucine (Ile-296) with a valine in hSLC2A5 abolished fructose transport while having no effect on glucose transport. Similarly, substitution of isoleucine 335 with valine (I335V) in hSLC2A9 also strongly decreased fructose transport with glucose transport remaining unaffected. This current study examined the importance of the hydrophobic residues Ile-335 and Trp-110 of hSLC2A9 for urate transport and urate/hexose trans-acceleration exchange. For this we constructed three point mutations of hSLC2A9: isoleucine 335 to valine (I335V) and tryptophan 110 to alanine (W110A) and phenylalanine (W110F). The impact of these mutations on hSLC2A9 transport characteristics was then assessed after expressing the proteins in Xenopus oocytes by the use of radiotracer flux measurements and electrophysiology. We found that the mutation I335V has urate transport kinetics similar to the wild type (WT) protein, whereas W110A has a lower capacity and higher affinity for urate transport compared with WT hSLC2A9. Wild type and mutant transporters exhibited urate/urate trans-acceleration; however, fructose/urate trans-acceleration was lost in both the I335V and W110A mutants but retained in W110F mutant. Immunohistochemistry and biotinylation studies indicated that all proteins are expressed at similar levels in the oocyte. This suggests that these functional differences between WT and mutant hSLC2A9 are due to structural changes in the protein, which is further discussed in light of a new structural model for hSLC2A9 based upon the crystal structure of hSLC2A1 (16.Deng D. Xu C. Sun P. Wu J. Yan C. Hu M. Yan N. Crystal structure of the human glucose transporter GLUT1.Nature. 2014; 510: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that Ile-335 of hSLC2A9 is necessary for urate/fructose trans-acceleration exchange to occur. They also indicate that Trp-110 of hSLC2A9 is critical for urate transport. Together they also confirmed that urate and fructose are both mediated by hSLC2A9 but that they interact with the transporter protein differently. Original human hSLC2A9 was a gift from Kelly Moley and were inserted into the pGEM-HE vector for oocyte expression. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by using QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to construct isoleucine 335 to valine (I335V) and tryptophan 110 to alanine (W110A) mutants of hSLC2A9 WT.

In brief, plasmids containing hSLC2A9 WT and its I335V, W110A, and W110F mutants were linearized with NheI and transcribed in vitro with T7 polymerase mMESSAGEmMACHINETM (Ambion). Individual adult female X. laevis oocytes were separated by collagenase and manually defoliculated before injection. Isolated oocytes were injected with 10–20 nl (20 ng) of mutant plasmid mRNA and incubated in modified Bath medium (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.33 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm Hepes, 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mg/ml penicillin, and 0.05 mg/ml gentamycin sulfate, pH 7.5, for 4 days at 16–18 °C before functional assays. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated (Sigma, Oakville, Ontario, Canada). The same volume of water was injected into oocytes as a control. The concentration of mRNA was determined using a Nano Drop 1000 Spectrophotometer V3.7 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All radiotracer flux studies were conducted at room temperature 20–22 °C. 14C-labeled urate (Moravek) was used in flux and efflux experiments to test the urate handling ability of hSLC2A9 WT, I335V, W110A, and W110F mutants. Radioactivity was measured with a Beckman LS6500 liquid scintillation counter (Fullerton, CA). Experiments were performed as previous studies described (13.Caulfield M.J. Munroe P.B. O'Neil D.

Oocytes were incubated for 20 min, which was determined as the linear portion of the urate uptake. The transport reaction was stopped by washing with ice-cold modified Barth's medium, then individual oocytes were placed into scintillation vials for uptake activity measurement. Uptake activity was corrected for nonspecific activities measured from control water-injected oocytes from the same batch for each experiment. Oocytes were loaded with substrates, d-fructose, urate, and d-fructose by preincubation for 1 h. Preloading was terminated by washing the oocytes with fresh modified Barth's medium. Preloaded oocytes were then used to perform [14C]urate uptake experiments as described above. Experiments were conducted using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp (TEVC) technique with a GeneClamp 500B (Molecular Devices Inc. Sunnyvale, CA). Sodium-containing transport medium (STM; 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, with Tris base) was used to perfuse oocytes to obtain a baseline current before adding experimental substrates. Urate induced current (1 mm urate in standard STM), and urate kinetics analysis (with urate concentration ranging from 0.05 to 5 mm, added to STM) was performed using a Gap-free protocol. Individual oocytes were clamped at −30 mV and super-perfused with different concentrations of urate for 30 s (range from 0.1 to 5 mm) followed by a 1-min wash with urate free buffer in between. Data were collected at the peak of each urate-induced current (previous analysis had shown that using the plateau after the peak provided identical kinetics). Data was expressed in the form of urate-induced mean current ±S.E. Current-voltage (I-V) curves were measured with a RAMP protocol in which the voltage was changed from −120 to 60 mV for a 3-s period. I-V curves were RAMP at the peak of the urate-induced currents. A Digidata 1320A converter and pClamp8 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) were used to collect and analyze data. Then we performed the Gap-free protocols to compare inward mean peak currents using either STM wash buffer or fructose containing STM buffer after oocytes were preincubated in situ with 1 mm urate for 1 min. The trans-acceleration measured with TEVC assumed that the inward currents induced by washing the oocytes with STM are urate-induced. That is, these currents were induced when urate moved out of the oocyte (downward facing peak current value; see Fig. 4, A and B). Biotinylation and Western blot analyses were carried out to measure the protein expression level of each isoform based upon a previously published protocol (19.Wang Q. Dai X.Q. Li Q. Tuli J. Liang G. Li S.S. Chen X.Z. Filamin interacts with epithelial sodium channel and inhibits its channel function.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 264-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) with modification. Oocytes were washed three times with phosphate buffer saline (PBS), pH 8.0; then they were incubated in 2 mm Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by washing with quenching buffer (192 mm glycine and 25 mm Tris-HCl in PBS, pH 7.5). Oocytes were then lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). Lysates were incubated with streptavidin (Pierce) at 4 °C overnight. The next day beads with bound protein were spun down gently. Biotinylated proteins were resuspended using SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins from SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked with 3% milk in PBST (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS). After blocking, the membrane was probed with primary hSLC2A9 antibody (Cedarlane, Canada) and anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Protein quantification was by measuring the band intensities using Image J (imagej.nih.gov). Immunohistochemistry was used to determine protein expression in X. laevis oocyte membranes. Oocytes were washed with PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.78 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4), then fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. After fixation, oocytes were washed with 50 mm NH4Cl and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Oocytes were then blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin for 30 min followed by incubation with primary hSLC2A9 antibody in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature and then with secondary antibody, Alexa 488 (Invitrogen). After incubation, oocytes were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc. Burlingame, CA) on slides with secure-seal spacers. Protein expression was determined by Wave FX confocal microscopy (Quorum Technologies, ON, Canada) of the fluorescent secondary antibody. Graphpad 5.0 was used to analyze all the data. Urate kinetic data were fitted using nonlinear regression. Current-voltage (I-V) curves were graphed in X-Y plots. Trans-acceleration data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA for the flux studies and Student's unpaired t test in TEVC studies. Significant values were accepted when p < 0.05. Biotinylation of protein expression level data were compared using arbitrary units of band intensity. The three-dimensional models of the human transporters SLC2A5 and SLC2A9 were built using the I-TASSER server, which is based on ab initio/threading methods (20.Zhang Y. I-TASSER servers of protein 3D.BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9: 40Crossref PubMed Scopus (3886) Google Scholar), and choosing the crystal structure of human glucose transporter SLC2A1 (PDB ID 4PYP) as the preferred template. The sequence identity/similarity between SLC2A1 (or SLC2A5) and SLC2A9 was 28/49% (or 29/59%). The server generated 5 models with the best model for each target selected based on their C-scores (−1.2) implemented in I-TASSER. The score is calculated based on the significance of threading template alignments and the convergence parameters of the structure assembly simulations. The stereochemical quality of the model was assessed with Molprobity, and it showed that 92% of the residues are in the most favorable regions of the Ramachandran plot for both molecular models (21.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. Procheck: a program to check the stereochemical quality of protein structures.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Sequence alignments were conducted with Clustal Omega (22.Sievers F. Wilm A. Dineen D. Gibson T.J. Karplus K. Li W. Lopez R. McWilliam H. Remmert M. Söding J. Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Fast, scalable generation of high-quality protein multiple sequence alignments using Clustal Omega.Mol. Syst.

Deciphering key features in protein structures with the new ENDscript server.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: W320-W324Crossref PubMed Scopus (3649) Google Scholar) and the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.5.0.4 Schrödinger, LLC. After determining that urate transport mediated by WT hSLC2A9 and its I335V, W110A, and W110F mutants were similar at 0.1 mm substrate concentration (data not shown), the kinetics for both mutants were then fully characterized. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, the data indicate that the Michaelis-Menten-like kinetics for urate are similar for both the WT and the I335V mutant. WT hSLC2A9 has an average Vmax of 981.9 ± 136.5 pmol/oocyte/20 min with a Km of 4.5 ± 11.6 mm, I335V has a Vmax of 937.7 ± 278.1 pmol/oocyte/20 min and Km of 6.6 ± 3.1 mm, W110A has an average Vmax of 108.5 ± 11.1 pmol/oocyte/20 min and Km of 0.3 ± 0.1 mm, and W110F has an average Vmax of 355.6 ± 61.9 pmol/oocyte/20 min and Km of 1.7 ± 0.7 mm. This indicates that urate transport by the I335V mutant is very similar to the WT. The W110A mutant, on the other hand, has higher affinity and lower transport capacity compared with WT. W110F show an intermediate Vmax and Km between W110A and WT hSLC2A9. Because urate transport by WT hSLC2A9 is electrogenic (13.Caulfield M.J. Munroe P.B. O'Neil D. Witkowska K. Charchar F.J.

Human SLC2A9a and SLC2A9b isoforms mediate electrogenic transport of urate with different characteristics in the presence of hexoses.Am. J. Physiol. Renal. Physiol. 2012; 303: F527-F539Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we also used the TEVC method to further investigate how hSLC2A9 and its mutants transport urate. A representative trace from the actual recording obtained with WT hSLC2A9 is shown in Fig. 2A. We clamped a single oocyte at a holding potential of −30 mV, then perfused the oocyte with different concentrations of urate followed by a 1-min wash with STM. We then measured the mean induced outward current. Data were collected at the peak of each urate-induced current. Fig. 2B shows that urate transport by hSLC2A9 WT and its mutants displayed classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics. This confirms that all these proteins have only a single binding site for urate. Also, we can conclude that hSLC2A9 WT and I335V transport urate in the same way because they have very similar kinetic constants (Fig. 2C) (WT: Vmax = 433.4 ± 21.5 nA, Km = 1.9 ± 0.2 mm; I335V: Vmax = 451.0 ± 26.5 nA, Km = 2.2 ± 0.3 mm). However, the W110A and W110F mutations shift the urate kinetic curve to the right with a significantly smaller Vmax (115.0 ± 5.8 nA and 158.9 ± 14.5 nA) and Km (0.7 ± 0.1 mm and 1.0 ± 0.3 mm), suggesting that this tryptophan residue may play a key role in substrate preselection or binding. In addition, we further investigated the protein function using current-voltage (I-V) curves as shown in Fig. 2D using a RAMP protocol. I-V curves were RAMP at the peak of the urate-induced currents. The voltage was progressively changed from −120 to 60 mV within a 3-s time period. Current recordings were filtered, and current values at 20 different voltages from −120 to 60 mV were shown. As indicated in Fig. 2C, urate transport showed a quasi-linear relationship with the membrane potential in the range from −120 to 60 mV, indicating that urate transport is driven, but not gated, by the voltage. The I-V curves of WT and I335V are similar;"
https://openalex.org/W2047491039,"Some land and ocean processes are related through connections (and synoptic-scale teleconnections) to the atmosphere. Synoptic-scale atmospheric (El Niño/Southern Oscillation [ENSO], Pacific Decadal Oscillation [PDO], and North Atlantic Oscillation [NAO]) decadal cycles are known to influence the global terrestrial carbon cycle. Potentially, smaller scale land-ocean connections influenced by coastal upwelling (changes in sea surface temperature) may be important for local-to-regional water-limited ecosystems where plants may benefit from air moisture transported from the ocean to terrestrial ecosystems. Here we use satellite-derived observations to test potential connections between changes in sea surface temperature (SST) in regions with strong coastal upwelling and terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) across the Baja California Peninsula. This region is characterized by an arid/semiarid climate along the southern California Current. We found that SST was correlated with the fraction of photosynthetic active radiation (fPAR; as a proxy for GPP) with lags ranging from 0 to 5 months. In contrast ENSO was not as strongly related with fPAR as SST in these coastal ecosystems. Our results show the importance of local-scale changes in SST during upwelling events, to explain the variability in GPP in coastal, water-limited ecosystems. The response of GPP to SST was spatially-dependent: colder SST in the northern areas increased GPP (likely by influencing fog formation), while warmer SST at the southern areas was associated to higher GPP (as SST is in phase with precipitation patterns). Interannual trends in fPAR are also spatially variable along the Baja California Peninsula with increasing secular trends in subtropical regions, decreasing trends in the most arid region, and no trend in the semi-arid regions. These findings suggest that studies and ecosystem process based models should consider the lateral influence of local-scale ocean processes that could influence coastal ecosystem productivity."

All participants received dynamic EPDWI with a total of 8 repetitions. Imaging quality of DWI was evaluated. Probability of severe overestimation of ADC (soADC), defined by an ADC ratio more than 1.2, was calculated. Error on T2WI, DWI, and ADC was computed. Statistical analysis included paired Student t testing and Mann-Whitney U test. A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Transient signal loss was visually detected on some excitations of DWI but not on T2WI or mean DWI. soADC occurred randomly among 8 excitations and 3 directions of diffusion encoding gradients. Probability of soADC was significantly higher in radiotherapy group (42.86%) than in healthy group (24.39%). The mean error percentage decreased as the number of excitations increased on all images, and, it was smallest on T2WI, followed by DWI and ADC in an increasing order.Transient signal loss on DWI was successfully detected by dynamic EPDWI. The signal loss on DWI and overestimation of ADC could be partially remedied by increasing the number of excitations."
https://openalex.org/W2066987991,"For a population of interacting self-interested agents, we study how the average cooperation level is affected by some individuals' feelings of being betrayed and guilt. We quantify these feelings as adjusted payoffs in asymmetric games, where for different emotions, the payoff matrix takes the structure of that of either a prisoner's dilemma or a snowdrift game. Then we analyze the evolution of cooperation in a well-mixed population of agents, each of whom is associated with such a payoff matrix. At each time-step, an agent is randomly chosen from the population to update her strategy based on the myopic best-response update rule. According to the simulations, decreasing the feeling of being betrayed in a portion of agents does not necessarily increase the level of cooperation in the population. However, this resistance of the population against low-betrayal-level agents is effective only up to some extend that is explicitly determined by the payoff matrices and the number of agents associated with these matrices. Two other models are also considered where the betrayal factor of an agent fluctuates as a function of the number of cooperators and defectors that she encounters. Unstable behaviors are observed for the level of cooperation in these cases; however, we show that one can tune the parameters in the function to make the whole population become cooperative or defective."
https://openalex.org/W2060442989,"How animals, including mammals, can respond to and utilize the direction and intensity of the Earth's magnetic field for orientation and navigation is contentious. In this study, we experimentally tested whether the Chinese Noctule, Nyctalus plancyi (Vespertilionidae) can sense magnetic field strengths that were even lower than those of the present-day geomagnetic field. Such field strengths occurred during geomagnetic excursions or polarity reversals and thus may have played an important role in the evolution of a magnetic sense. We found that in a present-day local geomagnetic field, the bats showed a clear preference for positioning themselves at the magnetic north. As the field intensity decreased to only 1/5th of the natural intensity (i.e., 10 μT; the lowest field strength tested here), the bats still responded by positioning themselves at the magnetic north. When the field polarity was artificially reversed, the bats still preferred the new magnetic north, even at the lowest field strength tested (10 μT), despite the fact that the artificial field orientation was opposite to the natural geomagnetic field (P<0.05). Hence, N. plancyi is able to detect the direction of a magnetic field even at 1/5th of the present-day field strength. This high sensitivity to magnetic fields may explain how magnetic orientation could have evolved in bats even as the Earth's magnetic field strength varied and the polarity reversed tens of times over the past fifty million years."
https://openalex.org/W1975885645,"Objectives The primary aim of this study was to assess the ultrasonographic features of hip joints in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type I and II in comparison with healthy population. The secondary aims were to correlate these features with clinical measures and to evaluate the utility of ultrasound in the diagnosis of MPS disease. Materials and Methods Sixteen MPS I (n = 3) and II (n = 13) patients were enrolled in the present study and underwent clinical and radiological evaluation, and bilateral high-resolution ultrasonography (US) of hip joints. The distance from the femoral neck to joint capsule (synovial joint space, SJS), joint effusion, synovial hyperthrophy, and local pathological vascularization were evaluated. The results were compared to the healthy population and correlated with clinical and radiological measures. Results 1. There was a difference in US SJS between children with MPS disease and the normative value for healthy population (7mm). Mean values of SJS were 15.81 ± 4.08 cm (right hip joints) and 15.69 ± 4.19 cm (left joints). 2. No inflammatory joint abnormalities were detected in MPS patients. 3. There was a clear correlation between US SJS and patients’ age and height, while no clear correlation was observed between SJS and disease severity. Conclusions 1. Patients with MPS I and II present specific features in hip joint ultrasonography. 2. The data suggests that ultrasonography might be effective in the evaluation of hip joint involvement in patients with MPS and might present a valuable tool in facilitating the diagnosis and follow up of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2126275032,"In alpine Australia, Orthoptera are abundant, dominant herbivores, important prey species, and hosts for parasites and parasitoids. Despite the central role of orthopterans in alpine ecosystems, the impact of parasites on orthopteran populations is under-explored. In this study we describe the relationship between parasite prevalence and host sex, body size and year of collection. We accessed an existing, preserved collection of 640 Kosciuscola tristis collected from across its range between 2007 and 2011. Upon dissection we collected juvenile parasites and used molecular tools to identify them to three families (Nematoda; Mermithidae, and Arthropoda: Diptera: Tachinidae and Sarcophagidae). The prevalence of nematodes ranged from 3.5% to 25.0% and dipterans from 2.4% to 20.0%. Contrary to predictions, we found no associations between parasite prevalence and grasshopper sex or size. Although there was an association between prevalence of both nematodes and dipterans with year of collection, this is likely driven by a small sample size in the first year. Our results provide a foundation for future studies into parasite prevalence within the alpine environment and the abiotic factors that might influence these associations."
https://openalex.org/W2109504883,"Adopted children often experience health and well-being disadvantages compared to biological children remaining in their natal households. The degree of genetic relatedness is thought to mediate the level of parental investment in children, leading to poorer outcomes of biologically unrelated children. We explore whether mortality is related to adoption in a historical Taiwanese population where adoption rarely occurred among kin. Using Cox proportional hazards models in which adoption is included as a time-dependent covariate, we show that adoption of girls does not increase the risk of mortality, as previously suggested; in fact, it is either protective or neutral with respect to mortality. These results suggest that socio-structural variables may produce positive outcomes for adopted children, even compared to biological children who remain in the care of their parents."
https://openalex.org/W2053550392,"MicroRNAs are known to play important roles in the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. While intensive research has been conducted to identify miRNAs and their target genes in various genomes, there is only limited knowledge about how microRNAs are regulated. In this study, we construct a pipeline that can infer the regulatory relationships between transcription factors and microRNAs from ChIP-Seq data with high confidence. In particular, after identifying candidate peaks from ChIP-Seq data, we formulate the inference as a PU learning (learning from only positive and unlabeled examples) problem. Multiple features including the statistical significance of the peaks, the location of the peaks, the transcription factor binding site motifs, and the evolutionary conservation are derived from peaks for training and prediction. To further improve the accuracy of our inference, we also apply a mean reciprocal rank (MRR)-based method to the candidate peaks. We apply our pipeline to infer TF-miRNA regulatory relationships in mouse embryonic stem cells. The experimental results show that our approach provides very specific findings of TF-miRNA regulatory relationships."
https://openalex.org/W2004949031,"Yersiniosis caused by Yersinia enterocolitica has been reported from all continents. The bacterial species is divided into more than fifty serovars and six biovars viz. 1A, 1B, 2, 3, 4 and 5 which differ in geographical distribution, ecological niches and pathogenicity. Most Y.enterocolitica strains harbor chromosomal genes for two β-lactamases, blaA an Ambler class A penicillinase and blaB an Ambler class C inducible cephalosporinase. In the present study, susceptibility to b-lactam antibiotics and β-lactamase inhibitor was studied for Y. enterocolitica strains of biovars 1A, 1B, 2 and 4. We observed that β-lactamases were expressed differentially among strains of different biovars. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying such differential expression, the sequences of genes and promoters of blaA were compared. Also, the variants of blaA present in different biovars were modeled and docked with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. The mRNA secondary structures of blaA variants were also predicted in-silico. Our findings indicated that neither variations in the promoter regions, nor the secondary structures of mRNA contributed to higher/lower expression of blaA in different biovars. Analysis of H-bonding residues of blaA variants with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid revealed that if amino acid residues of a β-lactamase interacting with amoxicillin and the clavulanic acid were similar, clavulanic acid was effective in engaging the enzyme, accounting for a significant reduction in MIC of amoxicillin-clavulanate. This finding might aid in designing better β-lactamase inhibitors with improved efficiencies in future."
