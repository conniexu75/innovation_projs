https://openalex.org/W1986958080,"Photochemical reactions in the martian exosphere produce fast atoms of oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen and provide large escape fluxes of these elements. They appear to play a crucial role in the evolution of the martian atmosphere. The relative outgassing rates of H(2)O and CO(2) on Mars are comparable with terrestrial values, although absolute rates for Mars are lower by a factor of 10(3). Nitrogen is a trace constituent, less than 1 percent, of the present martian atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2915796668,"Although only part of the information from the x-ray fluorescence geochemical experiment has been analyzed, it is clear that the experiment was highly successful. Significant compositional differences among and possibly within the maria and highlands have been detected. When viewed in the light of analyzed lunar rocks and soil samples, and the data from other lunar orbital experiments (in particular, the Apollo 15 gamma-ray spectroscopy experiment), the results indicate the existence of a differential lunar highland crust, probably feldspathic. This crust appears to be related to the plagioclase-rich materials previously found in the samples from Apollo 11, Apollo 12, Apollo 14, Apollo 15, and Luna 16."
https://openalex.org/W1994115635,"The Rutherford scattering of carged particles from the heavier elements and nuclear scattering and (alpha,p) reactions from the light elements result in energy spectra that are characteristic of the nucleus being bombarded. A simple apparatus for analyzing surfaces based on these ideas can be made by using an alpha source such as Cm244, a solid state detector, and an electronic pulse height analyzer."

The vegetation on the denuded upland site showed a large increase in bunch-grass and an invasion by pioneer shrubs which ordinarily are chiefly confined to dry washes."
https://openalex.org/W2052737025,"Roots of tomato plants infected with Meloidogyne javanica were grown in soil subjected to oxygen concentrations of 21 percent, 5.5 percent, 3.5 percent, 2.0 percent, 0.6 percent, and 0 percent for 28 and 35 days. The lowest oxygen tension which still allowed development of the host and the nematode was 3.5 percent. Below this level the plant root growth, size of developing females, and production of nematode eggs were reduced. Nematode activity as measured bythe number of nematode galls on the roots of treated plants was sharply reduced at the 5.5-percent level of oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W2032527203,"Lunar anorthosite 15415 consists almost entirely of anorthite (homogeneous anorthite 96.6 molecule percent), with accessory diopsidic augite and traces of hypersthene, ilmenite, and a silica mineral. The rock has had a complex metamorphic history. The texture reflects at least two episodes of shearing (followed by intense and partial recrystallization, respectively), one episode of cataclastic deformation, and one or more episodes of shattering and fragmentation."
https://openalex.org/W2042599444,"The last lava flow in the Hadley Rille area of Mare Imbrium, as inferred from an argon-40-argon-39 experiment on a plagioclase separate from the lunar basalt 15555, occurred 3.31+/-0.03x10(9) years ago. An argon-40-argon-39 experiment on a whole rock sample shows significant loss of radiogenic argon-40 and yields a well-defined, high-temperature plateau indicating a lower age of 3.22+/-0.03x10(9) years. A cosmic-ray exposure age of 90+/-10x10(6) years is determined from the ratio of spallogenic argon-38 to calcium."
https://openalex.org/W2038865408,"The crystallization age of an Apollo 15 anorthosite rock, 15415,9, returned from the lunar highlands has been measured to be (4.09 +/- 0.19) x 10(9) years. The primitive lunar crust must have been formed in the first 300 to 400 x 10(6) years. The results give some credence to the hypothesis that the primitive lunar surface was molten and large-scale fractional crystallization occurred in the early history of the moon."

https://openalex.org/W1994244893,The amount of 1-tryptophane excreted per day by 9 different normal male subjects was determined by a microbiological method with L. arabinosus as the test organism. From 12-30 mg per day were excreted as contrasted to an average value of 281 mg per day reported by Albanese and Frankston. A negligible amount of indole in the urine could be demonstrated. Satisfactory values and recoveries of 1-tryptophane were obtained at different levels of the test sample.
https://openalex.org/W2037235159,"The anorthosite slide 15415,18 contains 98 percent subhedral plagioclase (97 mole percent anorthite), two pyroxenes: diopsidic augite (46 percent wollastonite, 39 percent enstatite, 16 percent ferrosilite) with subsidiary (100) lamellae and grains of hypersthene (2.5 percent wollastonite, 58 percent enstatite, 39.5 percent ferrosilite), and traces of ilmenite. The pyroxene occurs interstitial to, and as small grains enclosed within, plagioclase. The textures and compositions of the phases appear compatible with an origin by concentration and adcumulus growth of plagioclase from a gabbroic anorthosite (or hyperaluminous) magma in a ""plutonic"" environment."
https://openalex.org/W1974298194,Lunar sample 15555 is a mare type basalt generally similar in chemical composition to the Apollo 12 basalts. Sample 15555 is older than any Apollo 12 basalt but younger than the Apollo 14 basalts analyzed thus far.
https://openalex.org/W2050098633,"The presence of stigmasterol in tomato fruits was demonstrated. Labeled mevalonic acid was incorporated into this sterol, while sodium acetate was not. The identity of the isolated product was established by rigorous purification to constant specific activity, melting point determinations, and infrared spectrum."
https://openalex.org/W1984548338,"Major and trace element concentrations have been determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, colorimetry, and isotope dilution in Apollo 15 mare basalt 15555 from the Hadley Rille area; trace element concentrations have also been determined in plagioclase and pyroxene separates from basalt 15555 and in soil 15531 from the same area. Basalt 15555 most closely resembles in composition the Apollo 12 olivine-rich basalts. The concentrations of lithium, potassium, rubidium, barium, rare-earth elements, and zirconium in basalt 15555 are the lowest, and the negative europium anomaly is the smallest, reported for lunar basalts; this basalt might be the least differentiated material yet returned from the moon. Crystallization and removal of about 6 percent of plagioclase similar to that contained in the basalt would account for the observed europium anomaly; if plagioclase is not on the liquidus of this basalt, a multistage origin is indicated. Mineral data indicate that plagioclase and pyroxene approached quasi-equilibrium. Most of the chemical differences between basalt 15555 and soil 15531 would be accounted for if the soil were a mixture of 88 percent basalt, 6 percent KREEP (a component, identified in other Apollo soils, rich in potassium, rare-earth elements, and phosphorus) and 6 percent plagioclase (anorthosite?)."
https://openalex.org/W2038802018,"An age of 3.33+/-0.05x10(9) years was obtained for Apollo 15 sample 15555 by argon40-argon-39 dating. The age of rock 15555, a basalt from the rim of Hadley Rille, establishes an upper limit to the age of the rille. The basalt flows filling the Hadley Rille section of the Imbrium basin postdate the formation of the basin-as measured by the Apollo 14 samples of the Fra Mauro formation-by at least 500x10(6) years. Therefore, the mare basalts cannot be simple impact melts but rather must result from some igneous activity on the moon."

https://openalex.org/W2003181426,"Blood and extracts of gut of the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana, powerfully stimulate contractions of the isolated rat uterus. The contractions are characterized by long latency and a prolonged relaxation phase having superimposed rhythmic contractions. Evidence indicates that the stimulating factor is not acetylcholine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, histamine, or substance P. The active factor is heat labile and nondialyzable."
https://openalex.org/W2021830724,"The spallation krypton data from rock chip 15555,23 indicate a wellshielded location during most of the time during which the rock was exposed to cosmic rays. A krypton-krypton exposure age of 81(+17)(-7) x 10(6) years is calculated, and the gas retention ages are estimated. No evidence for the presence of products from plutonium-244 or iodine-129 was found."

https://openalex.org/W1970411929,The lunar mare basalt 15555 from the edge of Hadley Rille has been dated at 3.3x10(9) years by both rubidium-strontium and potassium-argon techniques. Age and trace element abundances closely resemble those of the Apollo 12 mare basalts. Data from lunar basalts obtained thus far indicate that they cannot be derived by simple fractionation from a homogeneous source.

https://openalex.org/W2005072751,"As announced in the previous issue, p. 103, the brig “Galilee” of San Francisco, a wooden sailing vessel built in 1891, of length 132.5 feet, breadth 33.5 feet, depth 12.7 feet, displacement about 600 tons, has been chartered by the Department Terrestrial Magnetism of the Carnegie Institution of Washington for the purpose of making a magnetic survey of the North Pacific Ocean. After the various necessary alterations, e.g. substitution of the steel rigging by hemp rigging, etc., etc., were made, the vessel entered upon her duties early in August. Magnetic observations were made at various places on the shores around San Francisco Bay and the most suitable place for “swinging ship” by their aid determined. The ship was “swung” with the aid of a tug on August 2d, 3d, and 4th in San Francisco Bay between Goat Island and Berkeley, California, and the various deviation co-efficients were determined."
https://openalex.org/W2015301492,"Two basalts, two breccias, and two soils from Apollo 15 were analyzed by nondestructive gamma-ray spectrometry. The concentrations of potassium, thorium, and uranium in the basalts were similar to those in the Apollo 12 basalts, but the potassium: uranium ratios were somewhat higher. Primordial radioelements were enriched in the soils and breccia, consistent with a two-component mixture of mare basalt and up to 20 percent foreign component (KREEP). The abundance patterns for cosmogenic radionuclides implied surface sampling for all specimens. The galactic cosmic-ray production rate of vanadium-48 was determined as 57 +/- 11 disintegrations per minute per kilogram of iron. Cobalt-56 concentrations were used to estimate the intensity of the solar flare of 25 January 1971."
