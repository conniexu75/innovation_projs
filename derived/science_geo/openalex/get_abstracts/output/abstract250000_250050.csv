https://openalex.org/W2048705639,"Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) is a facultative intracellular pathogen that causes disease in a variety of hosts. S. Typhimurium actively invade host cells and typically reside within a membrane-bound compartment called the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV). The bacteria modify the fate of the SCV using two independent type III secretion systems (TTSS). TTSS are known to damage eukaryotic cell membranes and S. Typhimurium has been suggested to damage the SCV using its Salmonella pathogenicity island (SPI)-1 encoded TTSS. Here we show that this damage gives rise to an intracellular bacterial population targeted by the autophagy system during in vitro infection. Approximately 20% of intracellular S. Typhimurium colocalized with the autophagy marker GFP-LC3 at 1 h postinfection. Autophagy of S. Typhimurium was dependent upon the SPI-1 TTSS and bacterial protein synthesis. Bacteria targeted by the autophagy system were often associated with ubiquitinated proteins, indicating their exposure to the cytosol. Surprisingly, these bacteria also colocalized with SCV markers. Autophagy-deficient (atg5-/-) cells were more permissive for intracellular growth by S. Typhimurium than normal cells, allowing increased bacterial growth in the cytosol. We propose a model in which the host autophagy system targets bacteria in SCVs damaged by the SPI-1 TTSS. This serves to retain intracellular S. Typhimurium within vacuoles early after infection to protect the cytosol from bacterial colonization. Our findings support a role for autophagy in innate immunity and demonstrate that Salmonella infection is a powerful model to study the autophagy process. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S.

It is responsible for a variety of host-specific diseases, including gastroenteritis in humans and a systemic disease resembling typhoid fever in permissive mouse models (1Tsolis R.M. Kingsley R.A.

Microbes Infect. 2004; 6: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Inside host cells, S. Typhimurium replicates within a vacuolar compartment termed the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV). Maturation of this phagosome-like compartment is altered by the bacteria to create a niche favorable for replication (3Brumell J.H. Grinstein S. Curr. Opin.

Traffic. 2003; 4: 587-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). For example, delivery of NADPH oxidase and inducible nitric-oxide synthase to the SCV is blocked, along with fusion of the SCV with lysosomes (2Mastroeni P. Sheppard M.

Late stages of infection in vitro are characterized by the formation of tubular membranous extensions emanating from the SCV called Salmonella-induced filaments (Sifs) (11Brumell J.H.

Typhimurium delivers bacterial effector proteins into the host cell via needle-like appendages on the bacterial surface termed type III secretion systems (TTSSs) (5Knodler L.A. Steele-Mortimer O. Traffic. 2003; 4: 587-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 14Hueck C.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 379-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kubori T. Matsushima Y. Nakamura D.

The TTSS encoded in Salmonella pathogenicity island (SPI)-1 is necessary for the invasion of non-phagocytic cells and the establishment of gastroenteritis in animal models (1Tsolis R.M. Kingsley R.A.

Cell Microbiol. 2005; 7: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and expression of the SPI-2 TTSS is induced to continue modification of the SCV and intracellular growth (17Eriksson S.

Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 379-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and these needle-like structures have been shown to cause damage to host cell membranes. For example, TTSSs form pores in membranes to allow protein delivery (28Blocker A. Gounon P. Larquet E. Niebuhr K. Cabiaux V. Parsot C. Sansonetti P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) and can cause contact-dependent lysis of sheep red blood cells (28Blocker A. Gounon P. Larquet E. Niebuhr K. Cabiaux V.

Science. 2004; 304: 1515-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) have suggested that the S. Typhimurium SPI-1 TTSS can damage the SCV early after invasion, and have proposed a vacuole repair mechanism in which lysosomes are recruited to the damaged vacuoles in a calcium-dependent manner. Recently, we and others (23Brumell J.H. Tang P. Zaharik M.L. Finlay B.B. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 3264-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 24Beuzon C.R. Meresse S. Unsworth K.E.

Typhimurium escape from the SCV early after invasion in vitro, though the mechanism(s) of this escape are currently unclear. The existence of cytosolic S. Typhimurium suggests that the mechanism proposed by Roy et al. (30Roy D. Liston D.R. Idone V.J. Di A. Nelson D.J. Pujol C. Bliska J.B. Chakrabarti S. Andrews N.W. Science. 2004; 304: 1515-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) is not sufficient to retain the entire bacterial population within vacuoles. We have previously shown that bacteria that enter the cytosol in such a manner are targeted by the ubiquitin system (31Perrin A.J. Jiang X. Birmingham C.L. So N.S. Brumell J.H. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 806-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The consequences of this are still unknown, though it may play a role in MHC class I presentation in macrophages. Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is a cellular process that mediates the degradation of long-lived proteins and unwanted organelles in the cytosol by delivering them to the lysosome (32Ohsumi Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar, 33Kirkegaard K. Taylor M.P. Jackson W.T. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 301-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 34Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. Science. 2000; 290: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (3014) Google Scholar). Autophagy is regulated by a multitude of factors, including nutritional status, hormones and intracellular signaling pathways (34Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. Science. 2000; 290: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (3014) Google Scholar, 35Meijer A.J. Codogno P. Int. J. Biochem.

Recent evidence has suggested that the autophagy pathway interacts with intracellular bacteria in a variety of ways (33Kirkegaard K. Taylor M.P. Jackson W.T. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 301-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 37Dorn B.R. Dunn Jr., W.A. Progulske-Fox A. Cell Microbiol. 2002; 4: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Some bacterial species subvert autophagy and reside within autophagosome-like vacuoles, including Brucella abortus (38Pizarro-Cerda J. Meresse S. Parton R.G. van der Goot G. Sola-Landa A. Lopez-Goni I. Moreno E. Gorvel J.P. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 5711-5724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Pizarro-Cerda J. Moreno E. Sanguedolce V. Mege J.L. Gorvel J.P. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2387-2392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Porphyromonas gingivalis (40Dorn B.R. Dunn Jr., W.A. Progulske-Fox A. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 5698-5708Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), Coxiella burnetti (41Beron W. Gutierrez M.G. Rabinovitch M. Colombo M.I. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 5816-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and Legionella pneumophila (42Amer A.O. Swanson M.S. Cell Microbiol. 2005; 7: 765-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 43Swanson M.S. Isberg R.R. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3609-3620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that these bacteria block fusion of their autophagosomelike compartments with lysosomes, thereby providing a niche permissive for growth (33Kirkegaard K. Taylor M.P. Jackson W.T. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 301-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Recent studies also suggest a role for autophagy in host cell defense. Group A Streptococcus pyogenes is able to invade cells and lyse the phagosome using Streptolysin O. Once within the cytosol, autophagy targets this pathogen and effectively restricts its growth (44Nakagawa I. Amano A. Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Yamaguchi H. Kamimoto T. Nara A. Funao J. Nakata M. Tsuda K. Hamada S. Yoshimori T. Science. 2004; 306: 1037-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Rickettsiae spp. have been observed in double-membrane autophagosome-like structures, correlating with bacterial destruction and decreased replication (45Walker D.H. Popov V.L. Crocquet-Valdes P.A. Welsh C.J. Feng H.M. Lab. Invest. 1997; 76: 129-138PubMed Google Scholar, 46Rikihisa Y. Anat Rec. 1984; 208: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Additionally, autophagy targets Mycobacterium tuberculosis-containing phagosomes in interferon γ-activated macrophages to overcome the block in phagosomal maturation imposed by this pathogen (47Gutierrez M.G. Master S.S. Singh S.B. Taylor G.A. Colombo M.I. Deretic V. Cell. 2004; 119: 753-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1785) Google Scholar). The above studies suggest that autophagy is able to target bacteria in the cytosol and within vacuoles. However, the mechanisms by which autophagy targets intracellular bacteria are still unclear. To date, a possible interaction of S. Typhimurium with the autophagy system has not been tested. Here we demonstrate a role for autophagy in controlling infection by this pathogen. Our results suggest that autophagy targets S. Typhimurium in SCVs damaged by the SPI-1 TTSS. We propose that the host cell uses autophagy to restrict the growth of S. Typhimurium in the cytosol during infection. Bacterial Strains and Cell Culture—Wild-type S. Typhimurium SL1344 (48Hoiseth S.K. Stocker B.A. Nature. 1981; 291: 238-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar) and the isogenic mutants ΔsifA (27Stein M.A. Leung K.Y. Zwick M. Garcia-del Portillo F. Finlay B.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and ΔssaR (11Brumell J.H. Rosenberger C.M. Gotto G.T. Marcus S.L. Finlay B.B. Cell Microbiol. 2001; 3: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) were used for these studies. Wild-type-expressing GFP was previously described (19Valdivia R.H. Falkow S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). ΔinvA and ΔinvA expressing the Yersinia Inv protein (ΔinvA/pinv) in the 14028S background (49Pace J. Hayman M.J. Galan J.E. Cell. 1993; 72: 505-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 50Steele-Mortimer O. Brumell J.H. Knodler L.A. Meresse S. Lopez A. Finlay B.B. Cell Microbiol. 2002; 4: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) were also used. HeLa human epithelial cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's growth medium (HyClone) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Wisent) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 without antibiotics. Cells were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates at 5.0 × 104 cells/well 16-24 h before use. Plasmids and Transfection—GFP-LC3 was generated as previously described (51Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5510) Google Scholar). GeneJuice (Oncogene Research Products, San Diego, CA) and FuGene 6 (Roche Applied Science) transfection reagents were used according to the manufacturers' instructions. For visualization of wild-type bacteria during co-infection studies, monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) was expressed in S. Typhimurium. Bacteria were transformed with the plasmid pBR-RFP.1, which expresses the mRFP protein (52Campbell R.E. Tour O. Palmer A.E. Steinbach P.A. Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7877-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar) under the promoter for the ribosomal protein RpsM. To generate pBR-RFP.1, the rfp gene was amplified from plasmid pRSET B (52Campbell R.E. Tour O. Palmer A.E. Steinbach P.A. Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7877-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar) using the following primers: Rfpf (5′-ATG GAA TTC TTT AAG AAG GAG ATA TAC ATA TGG CCT CCT CCG AGG ACG TC-3′) and Rfpr (5′-ATG AAG CTT TTA GGC GCC GGT GGA GTG GCG-3′). The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and HindIII (sites underlined in Rfpf and Rfpr) and cloned into pBR322 to construct pBR-RFP. The region upstream from rpsM in Salmonella was PCR-amplified using the following primers: prpsmf (5′-ATG CAA TTG ATA CTA TCG AGC AAG CGC-3′) and prpsmr (5′-ATG CAA TTG CTA TTT AAT ATG TAC GTA CCA T-3′). The PCR product was then digested with MfeI (sites underlined in prpsmf and prpsmr) and cloned into the EcoRI site lying upstream of mrfp in pBR-RFP. A clone where the rpsM promoter orientation was driving expression of mrfp was selected, confirmed by nucleotide sequencing and designated pBR-RFP.1. Bacterial Infections—Late-log S. Typhimurium cultures were used for infecting cells and prepared using a method optimized for bacterial invasion (53Steele-Mortimer O. Meresse S. Gorvel J.P. Toh B.H. Finlay B.B. Cell Microbiol. 1999; 1: 33-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Briefly, wild-type and mutant bacteria were grown for ∼16 h at 37 °C with shaking and then subcultured (1:33) in LB without antibiotics for 3 h. Bacterial inocula were prepared by pelleting at 10,000 × g for 2 min, diluted 1:100 in PBS, pH 7.2, and added to cells for 10 min at 37 °C. After infection, extracellular bacteria were removed by extensive washing with PBS and addition of 100 μg/ml gentamicin to the medium. At 2 h postinfection, the gentamicin concentration was decreased to 10 μg/ml. ΔinvA/pinv bacteria were grown to late-log, harvested, and adjusted to an A600 of 1. The bacteria were then diluted 1:40 in PBS pH 7.2 and centrifuged onto cells for 1 min at 1000 rpm. The rest of the infection was performed as with wild-type S. Typhimurium. For ΔinvA co-infection experiments, wild-type S. Typhimurium expressing mRFP (52Campbell R.E. Tour O. Palmer A.E. Steinbach P.A. Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7877-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar) and ΔinvA were added to the cells at the same time in a 1:5 ratio as previously described (50Steele-Mortimer O. Brumell J.H. Knodler L.A. Meresse S. Lopez A. Finlay B.B. Cell Microbiol. 2002; 4: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The rest of the infection was performed as with wild-type S. Typhimurium. To inhibit bacterial protein synthesis, 200 μg/ml chloramphenicol was added directly to the growth medium and kept on throughout the rest of the infection. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor wortmannin was similarly added to a final concentration of 100 nm. The gentamicin-protection replication assay was performed as previously described (11Brumell J.H. Rosenberger C.M. Gotto G.T. Marcus S.L. Finlay B.B. Cell Microbiol. 2001; 3: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Cells were fixed with 2.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.2, for 10 min at 37 °C. Fixed cells were permeabilized and blocked in 0.2% saponin (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) and 10% normal goat serum for 12-24 h, and stained as previously described (11Brumell J.H. Rosenberger C.M. Gotto G.T. Marcus S.L. Finlay B.B. Cell Microbiol. 2001; 3: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Samples were mounted on slides and analyzed using a Zeiss Axiovert confocal microscope and LSM 510 software. Confocal images were imported into Adobe Photoshop and assembled in Adobe Illustrator. For three-dimensional representations, confocal Z-stacks were deconvolved and movies assembled with Volocity software (Improvision). Colocalization and enumeration studies were performed on a Leica DMIRE2 fluorescence microscope by direct visualization. At least 100 bacteria or cells were counted per condition in each experiment, and at least three independent experiments were performed. The mean ± S.D. are shown in the figures. Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to S. Typhimurium O antiserum Group B were from Difco Laboratories (Kansas City, MO). Mouse anti-human LAMP-1 antibody (clone H4A3) was developed by J. Thomas August and obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank under the auspices of the NICHD, National Institutes of Health and maintained by the University of Iowa, Department of Biological Sciences, Iowa City, IA. Mouse anti-human MHC-1 antibody was from Serotec (Raleigh, NC) and mouse anti-human CD44 from Sigma. Mouse anti-ubiquitinated proteins (clone FK2) was from Affiniti Research Products Ltd. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). All secondary antibodies used were AlexaFluor conjugates from Molecular Probes (Burlington, Ontario). DAPI (Molecular Probes) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Autophagy System Targets a Population of S. Typhimurium following Invasion—S. Typhimurium invades non-phagocytic cells and modifies the SCV to create a specialized vacuolar niche permissive for intracellular growth (3Brumell J.H. Grinstein S. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 4Holden D.W. Traffic. 2002; 3: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 5Knodler L.A. Steele-Mortimer O. Traffic. 2003; 4: 587-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). As previously noted, not all intracellular S. Typhimurium remain within SCVs, but rather a significant proportion escape into the cytosol early after invasion (23Brumell J.H. Tang P. Zaharik M.L. Finlay B.B. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 3264-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 24Beuzon C.R. Meresse S. Unsworth K.E. Ruiz-Albert J. Garvis S. Waterman S.R. Ryder T.A. Boucrot E. Holden D.W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3235-3249Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). These cytosolic bacteria are targeted by the ubiquitin system and become associated with ubiquitinated proteins (31Perrin A.J. Jiang X. Birmingham C.L. So N.S. Brumell J.H. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 806-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used immunostaining for ubiquitinated proteins as a marker for bacteria exposed to the cytosol (Fig. 1A). To examine autophagy during S. Typhimurium infection, HeLa cells were transfected with a GFP fusion to the N terminus of microtubuleassociated light chain-3 (LC3) (51Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5510) Google Scholar). LC3 is conjugated onto the membrane of autophagosomes and is a well-characterized marker of these structures (33Kirkegaard K. Taylor M.P. Jackson W.T. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 301-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 51Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5510) Google Scholar). Cells were infected with wild-type S. Typhimurium under conditions optimized for SPI-1 TTSS expression and bacterial invasion (53Steele-Mortimer O. Meresse S. Gorvel J.P. Toh B.H. Finlay B.B. Cell Microbiol. 1999; 1: 33-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, a population of intracellular S. Typhimurium colocalized with GFP-LC3 (see also supplementary Movie S1). Treatment of cells with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin, also a wellknown inhibitor of autophagy (33Kirkegaard K. Taylor M.P. Jackson W.T. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 301-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), blocked GFP-LC3 colocalization with intracellular S. Typhimurium (data not shown). Approximately 50% of GFP-LC3+ bacteria colocalized with ubiquitinated proteins, compared with only ∼5% for GFP-LC3- bacteria (Fig. 1B,). This suggests that S. Typhimurium autophagy is occurring in the cytosol, or a compartment that has access to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes present in the cytosol. Next, we examined the kinetics of S. Typhimurium autophagy (Fig. 1C). Colocalization of S. Typhimurium with GFP-LC3 peaked at 1 h postinfection, with up to ∼20% of total intracellular bacteria associated with the autophagy marker. Autophagy of S. Typhimurium was transient, as GFP-LC3 colocalization was not observed above background levels (3-5% of total bacteria) after 2 h postinfection. However, bacterial colocalization with ubiquitinated proteins peaked at 4 h postinfection (∼24% of the total bacterial population). Thus, autophagy of S. Typhimurium is an early event, and occurs prior to maximal escape by the bacteria into the cytosol, possibly when damage to the SCV is first initiated. Lysosomal-associated membrane protein-1 (LAMP-1) was rapidly acquired by the SCV during the first hour postinfection (Fig. 1C), as previously described (23Brumell J.H. Tang P. Zaharik M.L. Finlay B.B. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 3264-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 24Beuzon C.R. Meresse S. Unsworth K.E. Ruiz-Albert J. Garvis S. Waterman S.R. Ryder T.A. Boucrot E.

Microbiology. 2002; 148: 2705-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Only 75-80% of wild-type S. Typhimurium colocalized with LAMP-1 between 2 and 12 h postinfection. However, S. Typhimurium did not colocalize with GFP-LC3 during this period despite the fact that up to 20% of intracellular bacteria were LAMP-1- and apparently present in the cytosol. These findings demonstrate that the autophagy response to S. Typhimurium is limited, because it does not target cytosolic bacteria after 1 h postinfection. Autophagy Restricts the Intracellular Growth of S. Typhimurium—Autophagy of S. Typhimurium would be expected to have two important consequences. First, autophagosomes would be expected to deliver these bacteria to lysosomes for degradation. Because of technical limitations, we were unable to directly demonstrate that S. Typhimurium subject to autophagy are killed in lysosomes. However, a second, and perhaps more important consequence of S. Typhimurium autophagy, is that it would remove these bacteria from the cytosol. In this scenario, autophagy would protect the host cell cytosol, which has been show to be permissive for S. Typhimurium replication in some cell types, including HeLa cells (23Brumell J.H. Tang P. Zaharik M.L. Finlay B.B. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 3264-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 25Beuzon C.R. Salcedo S.P. Holden D.W. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 2705-2715Crossref PubMed"

To better understand the role of FoxO proteins in the liver, we created transgenic mice expressing constitutively active FoxO1 in the liver using the α1-antitrypsin promoter. Fasting glucose levels are increased, and glucose tolerance is impaired in transgenic (TGN) versus wild type (WT) mice. Interestingly, fasting triglyceride and cholesterol levels are reduced despite hyperinsulinemia, and post-prandial changes in triglyceride levels are markedly suppressed in TGN versus WT mice. Activation of pro-lipogenic signaling pathways (atypical protein kinase C and protein kinase B) and the ability to suppress β-hydroxybutyrate levels are not impaired in TGN. In contrast, de novo lipogenesis measured with 3H2O is suppressed by ∼70% in the liver of TGN versus WT mice after refeeding. Gene-array studies reveal that the expression of genes involved in gluconeogenesis, glycerol transport, and amino acid catabolism is increased, whereas genes involved in glucose utilization by glycolysis, the pentose phosphate shunt, lipogenesis, and sterol synthesis pathways are suppressed in TGN versus WT. Studies with adenoviral vectors in isolated hepatocytes confirm that FoxO1 stimulates expression of gluconeogenic genes and suppresses expression of genes involved in glycolysis, the shunt pathway, and lipogenesis, including glucokinase and SREBP-1c. Together, these results indicate that FoxO proteins promote hepatic glucose production through multiple mechanisms and contribute to the regulation of other metabolic pathways important in the adaptation to fasting and feeding in the liver, including glycolysis, the pentose phosphate shunt, and lipogenic and sterol synthetic pathways.

FoxO proteins form a subgroup within the family of Forkhead box (or Fox) transcription factors (4Kaestner K.H. Knochel W. Martinez D.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 142-146PubMed Google Scholar). Early studies indicated that Forkhead proteins interact with insulin response sequences (IRSs) in the promoter of the IGF-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) and the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) genes (5Unterman T.G.

Genetic studies of Caenorhabditis elegans revealed that DAF-16, a FoxO transcription factor, is a major target of insulin-like signaling (8Ogg S. Paradis S. Gottlieb S. Patterson G.I. Lee L. Tissenbaum H.A. Ruvkun G. Nature. 1997; 389: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar, 9Lin K. Dorman J.B. Rodan A. Kenyon C. Science. 1997; 278: 1319-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). DAF-16 plays an important role in the adaptation to environmental stress, including nutrient restriction, and signaling through phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase and PKB suppresses the function of DAF-16. Subsequent studies revealed that FoxO proteins contain highly conserved PKB phosphorylation sites (corresponding to Thr-24, Ser-256, and Ser-319 in human FoxO1) (10Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J.

Gan L. Pan H. Kan D. Majeski M. Adam S.A. Unterman T.G. Biochem. J. 2003; 378: 839-849Crossref Google Scholar). FoxO proteins are targets for other signaling pathways (14Brunet A. Park J. Tran H.

Partridge L. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 408-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), indicating that FoxO proteins are targets for both signaling and energy-sensing pathways (18Matsumoto M. Accili D. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 215-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). FoxO transcription factors exert positive and negative effects on gene expression. In addition to binding directly to DNA target sites and stimulating transcription of target genes, FoxO proteins interact with and modulate the function of other transcription factors and co-activator proteins, including factors important for the regulation of gene expression in the liver (2Barthel A. Schmoll D. Unterman T.G. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 16: 183-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Interaction with transcription factors associated with the promoter of region of target genes can help to recruit co-activating factors that promote gene transcription (19Nemoto S. Fergusson M.M. Finkel T. Science. 2004; 306: 2105-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). On the other hand, FoxO proteins can suppress gene expression by sequestering other transcription factors and/or co-activators (20Dowell P. Otto T.C. Adi S. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45485-45491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 21Hirota K. Daitoku H. Matsuzaki H. Araya N. Yamagata K. Asada S. Sugaya T. Fukamizu A. J. Biol.

FoxO proteins also can suppress gene expression by inducing the expression of repressor proteins (22Fernandez d.M. Essafi A. Soeiro I. Pietersen A.M. Birkenkamp K.U. Edwards C.S. Martino A. Nelson B.H. Francis J.M. Jones M.C. Brosens J.J. Coffer P.J. Lam E.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10058-10071Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and possibly by recruiting co-repressor proteins to promoters (23Liu Z.P. Wang Z. Yanagisawa H. Olson E.N. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 261-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Thus, FoxO proteins may provide an effective platform for integrating the effects of multiple regulatory pathways on gene expression. FoxO proteins play an important role in the adaptation to nutrient restriction in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila (24Henderson S.T. Johnson T.E. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1975-1980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 25Kramer J.M. Davidge J.T. Lockyer J.M. Staveley B.E. BMC Dev. Biol. 2003; 3: 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and increasing evidence indicates that this function is conserved in mammals. In muscle, FoxO proteins promote the expression of atrogin-1, an F-box protein that targets proteins for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome, thereby providing amino acid substrate for gluconeogenesis (26Sandri M. Sandri C. Gilbert A. Skurk C. Calabria E. Picard A. Walsh K. Schiaffino S. Lecker S.H. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 2004; 117: 399-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar). FoxO proteins also stimulate the expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (27Furuyama T. Kitayama K. Yamashita H. Mori N. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), which limits oxidative metabolism of glucose and conserves glucose for utilization in other tissues. FoxO proteins also stimulate the expression of lipoprotein lipase (28Kamei Y. Mizukami J. Miura S. Suzuki M. Takahashi N. Kawada T. Taniguchi T. Ezaki O. FEBS Lett. 2003; 536: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and the translocation of CD36 to the plasma membrane where it can promote fatty acid uptake (29Bastie C.C. Nahle Z.

Chem. 2005; 280: 14222-14229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and thereby enhances the metabolism of fatty acids. In the liver, FoxO1 interacts with insulin-responsive sequences in the promoters of IGFBP-1 (12Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol.

However, little is known regarding the effects of FoxO proteins on other metabolic pathways that are important in the adaptation to fasting and feeding in the liver. To address this point, we studied transgenic mice targeting a constitutively active form of FoxO1 to the liver using the α1-antitrypsin promoter. Initial studies confirmed that the FoxO1 transgene is expressed in the liver in a tissue-specific manner and showed that FoxO1 transgenic mice are resistant to glucose lowering effects of insulin. Subsequent studies revealed that constitutively active FoxO1 also has prominent effects on post-prandial triglyceride levels and de novo lipogenesis, measured with 3H2O. Gene-array studies demonstrated that FoxO1 exerts effects on the expression of multiple genes involved in glucose utilization and lipogenesis in vivo, and studies using adenoviral vectors in isolated hepatocytes showed that these changes reflect a direct effect of FoxO1. Together, these findings indicate that FoxO proteins play an important role in regulating the expression of multiple metabolic pathways involved in the response to fasting and feeding in the liver. Creation of Transgenic Mice—The creation of transgenic mice and all animal studies followed National institutes of Health guidelines and were approved by the institutional animal care committees at the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine and the Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Medical Center. The full-length cDNA coding for constitutively active human FoxO1, where Thr-24, Ser-256, and Ser-319 have been replaced by alanines (36Scheimann A.O. Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Snuggs M.B. Powell D.R. Horm. Metab. Res. 2001; 33: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), was inserted downstream of the 650-bp rabbit β-globin intron and upstream of a fragment of the bovine growth hormone gene containing the polyadenylation signal (37Silha J.V. Gui Y. Modric T. Suwanichkul A. Durham S.K. Powell D.R. Murphy L.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4305-4313Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). PCR primers were used to isolate from genomic DNA a 1200-bp DNA fragment containing the human α1-antitrypsin promoter and part of the noncoding first exon, and this promoter was placed upstream of the rabbit β-globin sequence, as shown in Fig. 1A. The function of this construct was confirmed in HepG2 cells in reporter gene assays by demonstrating that the expressed protein stimulates IGFBP-1 promoter activity in a sequence-specific fashion through known FoxO binding sites (7Cichy S.B. Uddin S. Danilkovich A. Guo S. Klippel A. Unterman T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6482-6487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The linearized 4.2-kb targeting construct was released from the vector backbone with ClaI. The purified construct, devoid of plasmid sequences, was injected into the pronuclei of fertilized FVB/N mouse zygotes, and microinjected embryos were transferred into CD-1 foster mice in the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine Transgenic Facility, according to the methods of Hogan et al. (38Hogan B. Beddington F. Constantini F. Lacy E. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). The presence of the transgene in the genomic DNA of offspring was determined by PCR using sense and antisense primers that span the 3′-end of the β-globin intron and the 5′-end of the FoxO1 cDNA, as indicated in Fig. 1A, and results were confirmed by Southern blotting. Two founders were identified, including one that had very high copy number and was paraplegic due to spina bifida occulta and was not suitable for further study. The other founder demonstrated germ line transmission and was used for subsequent studies. To examine the expression of the transgene in tissues from 2-month-old transgenic (TGN) and wild type (WT) mice, tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at –80 °C until extraction of total cellular RNA with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In subsequent studies, RNA was isolated from liver and cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and treated with DNase I on the column according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm and stored at –80 °C. cDNAs were synthesized with Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Amplification of the transgenic FoxO1 mRNA was accomplished by PCR using primers that span the heterologous flanking sequence from the β-globin intron (sense) and the 5′-end of the FoxO1 cDNA (antisense), as above (Fig. 1A). PCR products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized with ethidium bromide. Histochemistry—Livers were harvested from animals and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBD) and then embedded in paraffin. Standard hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed on deparaffinized 7-μm-thick sections. For Oil Red O staining, livers were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and then tissue was cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Tissue was then frozen under liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane and stored at –80 °C until sectioning. The 7-μm-thick sections were prepared and stained, as previously described (39Churukian C.J. J. Histotechnol. 1999; 22: 309-311Crossref Google Scholar). Photographs were taken on an Olympus Provis microscope. Animal Maintenance and Metabolic Studies—Mice were maintained on a 12/12 light/dark cycle and provided rodent chow (Diet 5L42, LabDiet, St. Louis, MO) in the animal care facility at the Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Tail clippings were obtained at weaning (3 weeks after birth), and genotyping was performed by RT-PCR, as before. Mice were euthanatized by sedation with carbon dioxide and decapitation. Blood was collected from conscious mice in heparinized capillary tubes from clipped tails, or by cardiac puncture following sedation with CO2 at the time of euthanasia, unless otherwise specified. Livers were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C for subsequent studies. Glucose and insulin tolerance testing was performed in 7- to 8-week-old mice following an 18-h overnight fast. Dextrose 2 g/kg or recombinant human insulin (0.5 unit/kg, Eli Lilly Co., Indianapolis, IN) was administered intraperitoneally, and glucose levels in tail blood were measured at baseline and 30, 60, 90, and 120 min later by glucometer (Lifescan, Milipitas, CA). For studies related to lipogenic metabolism, mice were placed on a high carbohydrate (65% sucrose) diet that is low in polyunsaturated fatty acids (TD.03303, Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI) for 4–5 days prior to studies, and housed in individual cages with non-digestible bedding (iso-PAD, Omni Bioresources, Cherry Hill, NJ). For fasting/refeeding studies, mice were fasted for 24 h (10 a.m. to 10 a.m.), and then allowed free access to high carbohydrate chow, and plasma samples obtained at appropriate time points. Biochemical Assays and FPLC Analysis of Plasma Lipids—Plasma insulin levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Crystal Chem, Inc., Downers Grove, IL). In initial studies, plasma levels of triglycerides and cholesterol and amino leucine transferase activity were measured commercially (Ani Lytics, Gaithersburg, MD). In later studies, commercially available kits were used to measure triglycerides (Wako, Richmond, VA), cholesterol (Wako), and β-hydroxybutyrate (Wako), as per the manufacturer's instructions. Hepatic triglyceride content was measured following two-step extraction with chloroformmethanol, after the method of Bligh and Dyer (40Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). Plasma lipoprotein fractionation by FPLC was performed in the University of Cincinnati Mouse Metabolic Phenotype Center to characterize the distribution of triglyceride and cholesterol among the different lipoprotein classes. Plasma (200 μl) was chromatographed undiluted through two Superose 6 columns (Amersham Biosciences) linked in tandem and equilibrated with degassed buffer (50 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 7.7 mm NaN3, pH 7.4), as previously reported (41Du H. Heur M. Duanmu M. Grabowski G.A. Hui Y. Witte D.P. Mishra J. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A flow rate of 0.6 ml/min was maintained by an Amersham Biosciences FPLC controller, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected into 1-ml screw-capped vials. Before the next sample was applied, the column was flushed with buffer until A280 returned to a stable baseline. Because Superose 6 is a size-selective matrix, large particles elute first and small particles elute last. Eluted lipoprotein samples were stored at –80 °C until analysis. Cholesterol concentration in each 0.6-ml fraction was quantified by the Cholesterol/HP Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Triglyceride was determined using the Randox kit (Antrim, United Kingdom). Measurement of de Novo Lipogenesis in Liver and Fat Pads—Lipogenesis was measured in vivo using 3H2O after the method of Stansbie et al. (42Stansbie D. Brownsey R.W. Crettaz M. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1976; 160: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Eight-week-old male TGN and WT mice were studied at the end of a 24-h fast or 6 h after refeeding with lipogenic (high carbohydrate) chow. Here, 3H2O (17 μCi/g) (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) was injected intraperitoneally, and mice were sacrificed 1 h later. Retroorbital blood was obtained under isoflurane anesthesia, and mice were euthanatized by cervical dislocation. Plasma was deproteinized with 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, and diluted aliquots were taken for scintillation counting to estimate the specific activity of 3H in total body water. The liver and epididymal fat pad were weighed, and 0.8–1 g of liver or the entire fat pad was placed in 3 ml of 30% (w/v) potassium hydroxide for digestion at 70 °C for 20 min and then for an additional 2 h at 70 °C following the addition of 3 ml of 95% ethanol. Cooled samples were acidified by addition of 3 ml of 9 m H2SO4 and then extracted 3 times with 10 ml of petroleum ether. Ether extracts were washed three times with 10 ml of H2O and brought to a final volume of 30 ml. 15-ml aliquots were dried under air in scintillation vials prior to addition of Ecoscint scintillation mixture (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) and scintillation counting. Total extractable counts per minute (cpm) in liver or fat pad were calculated and adjusted for variations in specific activity based on plasma cpm. Western Blotting and Atypical Protein Kinase C Kinase Assay—Protein extracts of liver tissue were prepared with T-Per (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) in the presence of protease inhibitors (Protease Inhibitor Mixture, Cat. no. P8340, Sigma) and phosphatase inhibitors (Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktails I and II, Cat. nos. P2850 and P5726, Sigma), and protein concentration was determined by the BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 4–20% gradient gels (Bio-Rad) and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, and then probed overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody prior to incubation with secondary antibody. Membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (Bio-Rad) and developed using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate kit (Pierce Biotechnology). Polyclonal anti-FLAG antibody was purchased from Sigma, and antibodies against total protein kinase B (PKB), serine 473-phosphorylated PKB, total glycogen synthase kinase-3 and serine 21-phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3 were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Antibodies against β-actin (C-11, sc-1615) and sterol response element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) (2A4, sc-13551) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal sheep antibody against glucokinase was generously provided by Dr. M. Magnuson (Vanderbilt University) (43Liang Y. Jetton T.L. Zimmerman E.C. Najafi H. Matschinsky F.M. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6999-7007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-rabbit, -mouse, -goat, and -sheep secondary antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling. Liver aPKC kinase activity was measured as previously described (44Standaert M.L. Sajan M.P. Miura A. Kanoh Y. Chen H.C. Farese Jr., R.V. Farese R.V. J. Biol.

In brief, aPKCs were immunoprecipitated from tissue lysates with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) that recognizes both PKC-ζ and PKC-λ, which are both expressed in liver. Immunoprecipitates were collected on Sepharose-AG beads (Santa Cruz) and incubated for 8 min at 30 °C in 100 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 100 μm sodium vanadate, 100 μm sodium phosphate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg of phosphatidylserine (Sigma), 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 5 mm magnesium chloride, and, as substrate, 40 μm serine analogue of the PKC-ϵ pseudosubstrate (BioSource, Camarillo, CA). After incubation, 32P-labeled substrate was trapped on P-81 paper and counted. Gene Array Studies—Transcriptional profiling of murine tissue was performed with the use of the Affymetrix Mouse Genome U74Av2 GeneChip array, which contains probe sets interrogating ∼12,000 transcripts. Total cellular RNA was prepared from the livers of female wild-type and transgenic mice at the end of a 24-h fast or 6 h after refeeding (n = 3 for each group), and all subsequent manipulations, including labeling and hybridization, were performed independently for each sample. Labeling reactions and hybridizations were carried out according to the standard GeneChip® eukaryotic target labeling protocol (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) in the University of Illinois at Chicago Core Genomics Laboratory. Briefly, 10 μg of total cellular RNA per sample was used to synthesize double-stranded cDNA, which then was transcribed in vitro in the presence of biotinylated dNTPs (Enzo Diagnostics, Farmingdale, NY). Biotinylated target cRNA was fragmented and brought up in hybridization mix. Successful labeling of all the samples (a minimum of 15 μgof in vitro transcription product per sample) was followed by test array hybridizations. Test hybridizations were performed with the use of “Test3” arrays (Affymetrix) to ensure quality of the biotinylated target. All hybridizations were performed with arrays from the same manufacturing lot. Hybridizations were followed by binding to streptavidin-conjugated fluorescent marker. Detection of bound probe was achieved following laser excitation of the fluorescent marker and scanning of the resultant emission spectra using a scanning confocal laser microscope (Probe Array Scan, Agilent Technologies). Data acquisition was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip array 5.0 suite. Collected hybr"

The purpose of the present study was to identify the contributions of distinct signaling mechanisms to PTH-stimulated activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) ERK1/2. In Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells transiently transfected with hPTH1R, PTH stimulated a robust increase in ERK activity. The time course of ERK1/2 activation was biphasic with an early peak at 10 min and a later sustained ERK1/2 activation persisting for greater than 60 min. Pretreatment of HEK293 cells with the PKA inhibitor H89 or the PKC inhibitor GF109203X, individually or in combination reduced the early component of PTH-stimulated ERK activity. However, these inhibitors of second messenger dependent kinases had little effect on the later phase of PTH-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation. This later phase of ERK1/2 activation at 30–60 min was blocked by depletion of cellular β-arrestin 2 and β-arrestin 1 by small interfering RNA. Furthermore, stimulation of hPTH1R with PTH analogues, [Trp1]PTHrp-(1–36) and [d-Trp12,Tyr34]PTH-(7–34), selectively activated Gs/PKA-mediated ERK1/2 activation or G protein-independent/β-arrestin-dependent ERK1/2 activation, respectively. It is concluded that PTH stimulates ERK1/2 through several distinct signal transduction pathways: an early G protein-dependent pathway meditated by PKA and PKC and a late pathway independent of G proteins mediated through β-arrestins. These findings imply the existence of distinct active conformations of the hPTH1R responsible for the two pathways, which can be stimulated by unique ligands.

Ligands for PTH1R including PTHrp and PTH are involved in the etiology and treatment of disease processes such as hypercalcemia of malignancy and osteoporosis. The actions of PTH, however, are complex. PTH is known for both anabolic and catabolic effects on bone, which are dependent upon intermittent or persistent exposure, respectively (1Tam C.S.

The intracellular signaling pathways activated by PTH and PTHrP via the PTH1R receptor include Gs-mediated activation of adenylate cyclase, resulting in cAMP production and PKA activation, and Gq/11-mediated PLCβ stimulation, leading to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) production, calcium mobilization, and PKC activation (4Iida-Klein A.

It has also been demonstrated that PTH activates the Raf-MEK-ERK MAP kinase (MAPK) cascade through both PKA and PKC in a cell-specific and G protein-dependent manner (8Verheijen M.H. Defize L.H. J.

MAPKs activated in response to stimulation by many different classes of cell surface receptors, including growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases and 7TMRs, regulate cell growth, division, differentiation, and apoptosis (11Gutkind J.S. Sci. Stke. 2000; 40: 11Google Scholar). PTH-stimulated activation of MAPK is known to have proliferative effects in kidney and bone (12Swarthout J.T. Doggett T.A. Lemker J.L. Partridge N.C. J. Biol.

There is growing evidence for novel 7TMR signaling mechanisms that are distinct from the classical G protein second messenger-dependent pathways. One such mechanism involves β-arrestins, a small family of cytosolic proteins initially identified for their central role in 7TMR desensitization. β-Arrestins are recruited to agonist-occupied 7TMRs that have been phosphorylated by specialized G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and sterically inhibit receptor-G protein coupling resulting in homologous receptor desensitization. Additionally, β-arrestins act as adaptors in clathrin-mediated receptor endocytosis (14Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-353PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). The role of β-arrestins acting as signal transducers through the formation of scaffolding complexes with accessory effector molecules such as Src, Ras, ERK1/2, JNK3, and MAPK kinase 4 (MKK4) is becoming increasingly recognized (16McDonald P.H.

Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar). The potential signaling diversity of 7TMRs suggests the possible existence of multiple discrete “active” receptor conformations. This implies that specific ligands might direct distinct signaling responses by preferentially stabilizing one or more of these active conformations. In the simple two-state model of receptor activation, agonists are defined as drugs that stabilize the active receptor conformation, which in turn promotes G protein activation. Conversely, an inverse agonist preferentially binds to the inactive receptor conformational state thereby reducing G protein signaling (21Brzostowski J.A. Kimmel A.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 291-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Recent observations suggest that some inverse agonists for cAMP generation may none the less be capable of recruiting β-arrestin to the receptor and inducing biological effects (22Azzi M. Charest P.G. Angers S. Rousseau G. Kohout T. Bouvier M. Pineyro G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11406-11411Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Agonist stimulation of PTH1R promotes the translocation of both β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2 to the plasma membrane, the association of the receptor with β-arrestins, and the internalization of the receptor/β-arrestin complexes (23Ferrari S.L.

The mechanistic basis of these physiologic effects has not been established. Accordingly, we set out to determine the roles of G proteins and β-arrestins in PTH1R-stimulated ERK1/2 activation. Materials—Human PTH-(1–34) and [d-Trp12,Tyr34]PTH-(7–34) (PTH-IA) were obtained from Bachem (Philadelphia, PA). [Trp1]PTHrp-(1–36) (PTH-NBR) was obtained from Xsira Pharmaceuticals (Research Triangle Park, NC). H89 and GF109203X (GFX) were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). GeneSilencer and FuGENE 6 transfection reagents were from Gene Therapy Systems (San Diego, CA) and Roche Applied Science, respectively. cDNA Constructs—Previously described expression plasmids encoding the wild type human PTH1R and H223R mutant PTH1R were generous gifts from Ernestina Shippani. To facilitate the PTH1R immunopreciptitation, a FLAG epitope tag was introduced using Exsite PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). The amino acid sequence EKRLK located in the downstream of the predicted PTH1R signal peptide was replaced by the FLAG epitope sequence DYKDDDDK. The expression vectors for His-tagged-β-arrestin 1 and His-tagged-β-arrestin 2 vectors have been described previously (28Lin F.-T. Krueger K.M. Kendall H.E. Daaka Y. Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A.

Cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of pcDNA1-PTH1R using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Binding studies with radiolabeled human 125I-[Nle8,18,Tyr34]PTH-(1–34) amide (Amersham Biosciences) show PTH1R receptor expression of 100–200 fmol/mg of protein. siRNA Transfection—The double-stranded siRNA sequences individually targeting β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2 are 5′-AAAGCCUUCUGCGCGGAGAAU-3′ and 5′-AAGGACCGCAAAGUGUUUGUG-3′, corresponding to the positions 439–459 and 148–168 relative to the start codon, respectively. The double-stranded siRNA sequence 5′-ACCUGCGCCUUCCGCUAUG-3′ was used to simultaneously target β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2. This sequence corresponds to the positions 172–190 and 175–193 relative to the start codons of β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2, respectively. The chemically synthesized double-stranded siRNAs and a non-silencing control RNA duplex were purchased from Xeragon (Germantown, MD) in deprotected and desalted form. HEK293 cells were transfected simultaneously with 2 μg of pcDNA1-PTH1R and 1.44 nmol of β-arrestin 2 siRNA, β-arrestin 1 siRNA or control siRNA using the GeneSilencer Transfection reagent as previously described (29Ahn S.

Preparation of Cellular Extracts and Immunoblotting—Transfected HEK293 cells were starved for 12–18 h in serum-free medium prior to stimulation. After stimulation, media was removed, and 100 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer was added to each well. Whole cell lysates were sonicated, resolved on 4–20% (for ERK1/2) or 10% (for β-arrestins 1 and 2) Tris/glycine polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen), and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting. Phosphorylated ERK1/2, total ERK1/2, and β-arrestins were detected by immunoblotting with rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Cell Signaling, 1:2,000 Beverly, MA), anti-MAP kinase 1/2 (Upstate Technology Inc, 1:10,000, Lake Placid, NY), or rabbit polyclonal anti-β-arrestin (A1CT, 1:5,000) antibodies, respectively. Chemiluminescent detection was performed using the SuperSignal Western Pico reagent (Pierce). Immunoblots were quantified by densitometry with a Fluor-S MultiImager (Bio-Rad). Cyclic AMP Determination—PTH-stimulated cAMP levels were determined in HEK293 cells transiently transfected with either the wild type human PTH1R or the constitutively active H223R mutant. Cells were preincubated for 15 min in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine and stimulated for 15 min with PTH-(1–34), PTH-NBR, or PTH-IA. Forskolin (10 μm) was used as a positive control. The stimulation was terminated with the addition of 0.125 m EDTA, and the samples were boiled for 10 min and clarified by centrifugation for 1 min at 15,000 × g. cAMP levels were determined using a 3H-labeled cAMP assay as described previously (31Zamah A.M.

The results are expressed as a percent maximum stimulation normalized to forskolin. Coimmunoprecipitation Assays—Transfected HEK293 cells were stimulated with PTH-(1–34), PTH-NBR, or PTH-IA at 37 °C for 5 min. Cells were subjected to covalent protein cross-linking by using the membrane-permeable, hydrolyzable cross-linker dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (Pierce) and then solubilized in RIPA lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 100 μm benzaminidine). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and immunoprecipitation was performed using 25 μl of 50% slurry of monoclonal anti-FLAG affinity agarose (Sigma), with constant agitation overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer and incubated in Laemmli sample buffer at 37 °C for 30 min prior to SDS-PAGE. Coimmunoprecipitated β-arrestin with FLAG-PTH1R were detected by immunoblotting with a 1:3,000 dilution of the A1CT rabbit polyclonal anti-β-arrestin antibody. Inhibition of PKA and PKC Reveals Distinct Temporal Components of PTH-induced MAP Kinase Activation—HEK293 cells transiently transfected to express human PTH1R stimulated with PTH-(1–34) (100 nm) resulted in a time-dependent increase in MAP kinase activation (Fig. 1). There was an early rapid activation of ERK1/2 at 2–5 min. PTH-(1–34)-stimulated ERK1/2 activation reached a peak at 5 min and remained greater than 8-fold over basal for at least 60 min (Fig. 1A). To determine the contributions of Gs/PKA- and Gq/PKC-dependent mechanisms to MAP kinase activation, cells were pretreated with the PKA inhibitor H89 (20 μm) or the PKC inhibitor GFX (2.5 μm), respectively, for 15 min prior to stimulation with PTH-(1–34) (100 nm). Each of these treatments inhibited MAP kinase activation. The greatest effect on the time course of ERK phosphorylation was apparent at 2–5 min of stimulation. In contrast, the sustained ERK1/2 activation at 30–60 min after PTH stimulation was significantly less sensitive to H89 or GFX (Fig. 1, B and C). To determine the contribution of a putative MAP kinase signaling pathway independent of both PKA and PKC, cells were pretreated with a combination of H89 (20 μm) and GFX (2.5 μm) for 15 min prior to stimulation with PTH-(1–34) (100 nm) (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that PTH stimulation of PTH1R results in MAP kinase activation independent of PKA and PKC. As illustrated in Fig. 1E, MAP kinase activation is comprised of an early G protein-dependent component and a late G protein-independent component. Inhibition with H89 and GFX, individually and combination, demonstrates that the Gs/PKA- and Gq/PKC-dependent mechanisms contribute primarily to the early time component of MAP kinase activation. Subtraction of the time course obtained from the stimulation of PTH1R with PTH-(1–34) in the presence of combined inhibitors for PKA and PKC (Fig. 1D) from the curve obtained in the absence of inhibitors predicts the time course for the G protein-dependent activation of ERK1/2. The G protein independent component of MAP kinase activation is the time course obtained from the stimulation of PTH1R with PTH-(1–34) in the presence of combined inhibitors for PKA and PKC (Fig. 1E). The Late Component of ERK1/2 Activation by PTH1R Is Dependent upon β-Arrestin 1 and β-Arrestin 2—To determine whether β-arrestins contribute to PTH-mediated MAP kinase activation, we used RNA interference to reduce the expression of endogenous β-arrestin 1 or β-arrestin 2 in HEK293 cells and measured MAP kinase activation by PTH1R stimulated with PTH-(1–34). Fig. 2A shows that siRNA targeting β-arrestin 1 or β-arrestin 2 effectively silences their expression (>90%) with little cross-reativity. In control siRNA transfected cells stimulated with PTH-(1–34) (100 nm), ERK1/2 activation reaches maximal levels rapidly (within 5 min of PTH treatment) and persists, decreasing slowly over 60 min (Fig. 2, B and C). The cotransfection of either β-arrestin 1 or β-arrestin 2 siRNA with PTH1R in HEK293 cells stimulated with PTH-(1–34) significantly alters the time course of ERK1/2 activation. PTH-(1–34) stimulation in absence of either β-arrestin 1 or β-arrestin 2 leads to rapid and transient MAP kinase activation, which decreases after 5 min and reaches close to basal levels at 30 min (Fig. 2, B–D). Furthermore, the decreased expression of either β-arrestin 1 or β-arrestin 2 resulted in a decrease in ERK1/2 activity similar to that observed with the decreased expression of both β-arrestin isoforms combined (Fig. 2E). Taken together with the PKA and PKC inhibitor data above, these results suggest that the β-arrestin-mediated ERK1/2 activation follows a time course that is very different from the G protein-mediated PKA/PKC-dependent ERK1/2 activation. Specifically, G protein (Gs, Gq)-dependent activity is rapid in onset and transient, whereas the majority of β-arrestin-dependent activity contributes to the late component of ERK1/2 activation and is more prolonged. Consistent with the idea that the time course of PTH-stimulated ERK1/2 activity is composed of independent G protein-mediated and β-arrestin-mediated components, Fig. 2F shows that the G protein-dependent component of ERK1/2 activation observed in the absence β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2 overlays the predicted time course of G protein-dependent ERK1/2 activation illustrated in Fig. 1E. MAP Kinase Activation by a Gs/PKA-selective PTH1R Ligand—Pharmacologic interest in modifying PTH1R-agonist interactions that contribute to β-arrestin-mediated desensitization has lead to the design of novel PTH1R agonists that uniquely destabilize receptor-β-arrestin association (32Bisello A. Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Monticelli L. Mierke D.F. Ferrari S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38524-38530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These PTH analogues have been shown to induce selective stabilization of the active G protein-coupled state of the PTH1R receptor, without causing β-arrestin recruitment. We examined a new PTH1R agonist, PTH-NBR, and its ability to generate G protein second messengers and to stimulate MAP kinase activation. Fig. 3, A and B, illustrates the effect of PTH-(1–34) and PTH-NBR on cAMP generation and phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis in HEK293 cells expressing PTH1R. Stimulation of cells expressing PTH1R with PTH-NBR (100 nm) increased cAMP levels as effectively as PTH-(1–34) (100 nm). There was no measurable generation of IP3 in response to PTH-NBR. These experiments demonstrate that PTH-NBR acts as a selective agonist for Gs/PKA activation while having no apparent activity for Gq/PKC stimulation. The effect of PTH-NBR on the time dependence of ERK1/2 activation in HEK293 cells expressing wild type (WT) PTH1R is shown in Fig. 4, A and B. The time course of PTH-NBR-stimulated ERK1/2 activation was significantly different from the time course of PTH-(1–34)-stimulated ERK1/2 activation. PTH-NBR stimulated an early and rapid activation of ERK1/2 that reached a peak at 5 min. The peak response of PTH-NBR was 65% of that achieved by PTH-(1–34). PTH-NBR-stimulated ERK1/2, while robust, was not sustained and rapidly returned to basal levels by 30–60 min.FIGURE 4Inhibition of PKA inhibits PTH-NBR-stimulated ERK1/2 activation. A, phosphorylation of endogenous ERK1/2 in HEK293 cells transiently transfected to express human PTH1R stimulated with 100 nm PTH-NBR for the indicated periods of time in the absence or presence of H89 (20 μm) or GFX (2.5 μm) was determined by immunoblotting (IB). B, time course of ERK1/2 activation by PTH-NBR compared with that of PTH-(1–34). C, ERK1/2 activation in cells pretreated with H89 or GFX prior to stimulation with 100 nm PTH-NBR. Values in the graphs are expressed as percent of the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 obtained at 5 min of stimulation with PTH-(1–34) in the absence of inhibitors. Data represent the mean ± S.E. from at least five independent experiments. Statistical comparison of the curves was performed by using a two-way ANOVA (†, p < 0.0001), and a Bonferroni post-test was used to compare values at each of the time points (***, p < 0.001; **, p < 0.01; *, p < 0.05). DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine the contributions of Gs/PKA- and Gq/PKC-dependent mechanisms to PTH-NBR-stimulated MAP kinase activation, cells were pretreated with the PKA inhibitor H89 (20 μm) or the PKC inhibitor GFX (2.5 μm), respectively, for 15 min prior to stimulation with PTH-NBR (100 nm). Fig. 4C shows that treatment with H89 completely inhibited PTH-NBR MAP kinase activation and the time course of MAP kinase activation was not significantly affected by treatment with GFX. These results indicate that PTH-NBR stimulation of PTH1R results in a time course of MAP kinase activation that is primarily dependent upon a Gs/PKA-mediated pathway. To determine whether β-arrestins contributed to MAP kinase activation, we again used RNA interference to reduce the expression of endogenous β-arrestin 1 or β-arrestin 2. PTH-NBR-stimulated ERK1/2 activation was measured in HEK293 cells transfected with PTH1R and siRNA for β-arrestin 1 or β-arrestin 2. In control siRNA-transfected cells, ERK1/2 activation reached maximal levels within 5 min of treatment with PTH-(1–34) and then rapidly declined to basal levels by 30–60 min, and reduced amounts of either β-arrestin 1 or β-arrestin 2 by siRNA did not significantly alter the time course of PTH-NBR ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 5, A and B). There was no difference in the time course of ERK activation when both β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2 are silenced concomitantly (n = 2; data not shown). The results obtained from the use of Gs/PKA and Gq/PKC inhibitors taken together with results demonstrating the absence of a β-arrestin-mediated component contributing to PTH-NBR-stimulated ERK1/2 activation suggest that PTH-NBR exclusively activates ERK1/2 via a G protein-dependent mechanism, namely Gs/PKA. With the lack of β-arrestin recruitment by PTH-NBR, one might expect that the desensitization of PTHR would be impaired and that the ERK activation may be extended to some of the later time points. The results presented here suggest that PTH1R must undergo some form(s) of β-arrestin-independent desensitization when stimulated by PTH-NBR. Desensitization of PTH1R by GRK2 in the absence of receptor phosphorylation has been described previously (33Dicker F. Quitterer U. Winstel R. Honold K. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5476-5481Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). PKA has also been implicated in the desensitization of PTH1R (34Fukayama S. Tashjian Jr., A. Bringhurst F. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 1757-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). MAP Kinase Activation by a β-Arrestin-selective PTH1R Ligand—It has been previously reported that PTH-IA exhibited inverse agonist activity for cAMP in cells expressing the constitutively active PTH1R H223R mutant (35Gardella T.J. Luck M.D. Jensen G.S. Schipani E. Potts Jr., J.T. Juppner H. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3936-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The PTH1R point mutation, H223R, constitutively activates adenylate cyclase, but not phospholipase C, and results in Jansens metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (36Schipani E. Jensen G.S. Pincus J. Nissenson R.A. Gardella T.J. Juppner H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The effects of PTH-(1–34) and PTH-IA on cAMP generation in HEK293 cells expressing the WT PTH1R or the H223R mutant receptor were confirmed (Fig. 6). Reflecting its constitutive activity, the basal cAMP levels in untreated cells expressing H223R were 11-fold greater than basal levels in cells expressing the WT receptor. Stimulation with PTH-(1–34) (100 nm) increased cAMP levels in cells expressing WT PTH1R or H223R to 15-fold WT receptor basal cAMP levels. Treatment of cells expressing WT PTH1R with PTH-IA (1 μm) did not activate cAMP. In cells expressing H223R, treatment with PTH-IA (1 μm) significantly reduced cAMP levels by 50% compared with the cAMP levels in the untreated cells, consistent with inverse agonist activity. PI hydrolysis provoked by PTH-(1–34), and PTH-IA was measured in HEK293 cells transiently expressing WT PTH1R or H223R. There was no measurable generation of IP3 in response to PTH-IA in cells expressing the wild type PTH1R or the H223R mutant receptor (data not shown). These experiments demonstrate that PTH-IA acts as an inverse agonist for Gs/PKA activation while having no apparent activity for Gq/PKC stimulation. Despite its inability to activate Gs/PKA or Gq/PKC signaling pathways, the inverse agonist PTH-IA is able to stimulate MAP kinase activation in HEK293 cells expressing PTH1R. The effect of PTH-IA on the time dependence of MAP kinase activation in HEK293 cells expressing WT PTHR1 is shown in Fig. 7, A and B. The maximal stimulated ERK1/2 activity by PTH-IA reached 35% of that achieved by PTH-(1–34). Consistent with the inability of PTH-IA to activate Gs/PKA or Gq/PKC signaling pathways ERK1/2 activation by PTH-IA is unaffected by PKA or PKC inhibition with H89 or GFX, respectively (Fig. 7, A and B). Moreover, the time course of ERK1/2 activation was prolonged resembling the response to PTH-("

https://openalex.org/W1997452920,"Colorectal cancer is a major cause of cancer death worldwide. A number of key oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes have been proposed to drive progression from healthy colonic epithelia to malignant tumors, including members of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Recently, CpG island promoter hypermethylation was shown to cause inactivation of two extracellular Wnt inhibitors in colon cancer: secreted frizzled-related proteins (sFRPs) and Wnt inhibitory factor-1 (WIF-1). Here, we show for the first time that another extracellular Wnt inhibitor, the DICKKOPF-1 (DKK-1) gene, is transcriptionally silenced by CpG island promoter hypermethylation in colon cancer cell lines (n=9), whereas treatment with the DNA-demethylating agent 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine restored DKK-1 expression. Restoration of DKK-1 function in non-expressing cells bearing a truncated APC (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli) gene had no effect on β-catenin/T-cell factor-dependent transcription, but induced tumor suppressor-like features such as reduced colony formation density and tumor growth inhibition in nude mice. These results suggest additional functions for DKK-1 other than inhibiting canonical Wnt signaling. In primary colorectal tumors, DKK-1 was found hypermethylated in 17% (nine of 54) of cases. Furthermore, while for both SFRP-1 and WIF-1 methylation-associated silencing occurred across the whole spectrum of colorectal tumorigenesis, DKK-1 promoter was selectively hypermethylated in advanced colorectal neoplasms (Duke's C and D tumors)."
https://openalex.org/W1989463219,"When Pseudomonas putida KT2440 cells encounter toluene in the growth medium, they perceive it simultaneously as a potential nutrient to be metabolized, as a membrane-damaging toxic drug to be extruded, and as a macromolecule-disrupting agent from which to protect proteins. Each of these inputs requires a dedicated transcriptional response that involves a large number of genes. We used DNA array technology to decipher the interplay between these responses in P. putida KT2440 subjected to a short challenge (15 min) with toluene. We then compared the results with those in cells exposed to o-xylene (a non-biodegradable toluene counterpart) and 3-methylbenzoate (a specific substrate of the lower TOL pathway of the P. putida pWW0 plasmid). The resulting expression profiles suggest that the bulk of the available transcriptional machinery is reassigned to endure general stress, whereas only a small share of the available machinery is redirected to the degradation of the aromatic compounds. Specifically, both toluene and o-xylene induce the TOL pathways and a dedicated but not always productive metabolic program. Similarly, 3-methylbenzoate induces the expression not only of the lower meta pathway but also of the non-productive and potentially deleterious genes for the metabolism of (nonsubstituted) benzoate. In addition, toluene (and to a lesser extent o-xylene) inhibit motility functions as an unequivocal response to aromatic toxicity. We argue that toluene is sensed by P. putida KT2440 as a stressor rather than as a nutrient and that the inhibition by the aromatic compounds of many functions we tested is the tradeoff for activating stress tolerance genes at a minimal cost in terms of energy.

Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is a soil microorganism characterized by its metabolic versatility, which enables the strain to degrade a wide variety of natural and man-made aromatic compounds (1Nelson K.E. Weinel C. Paulsen I.T. Dodson R.J. Hilbert H. Martins dos Santos V.A. Fouts D.E. Gill S.R. Pop M. Holmes M. Brinkac L. Beanan M. DeBoy R.T. Daugherty S. Kolonay J. Madupu R. Nelson W. White O.

García J.L. Díaz E. Ramos J.L. Pseudomonas. 3. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, London2004: 425-462Google Scholar). This strain can use toluene and m- and p-xylene via the pWW0 TOL plasmidencoded pathways (3Nakazawa T. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 782-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 4Ramos J.L. Marqués S. Timmis K.N. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 341-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). When the strain is confronted with these aromatic compounds, cells face an enticing paradox. On the one hand, these chemical species can be mineralized to yield carbon and energy for growth, allowing the strain to colonize niches refractory to other microbes. On the other hand, toluene and xylenes are toxic for the bacteria above a certain threshold, since they partition in the cell membrane and disorganize it by removing lipids and proteins, which eventually leads to cell death (5Sikkema J. de Bont J.A. Poolman B. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 201-222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of toluene, m-xylene, and p-xylene metabolism to CO2 and H2Oin P. putida bearing pWW0 involves two sets of reactions and depends on the ability of two cognate regulatory proteins to become activated by certain aromatic compounds and to trigger the expression of specific pathways (summarized in Fig. 1) (4Ramos J.L. Marqués S. Timmis K.N. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 341-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). But activation of metabolic genes is not the only effect of exposing P. putida cells to aromatic hydrocarbons, as these compounds also trigger a solvent tolerance response which involves a number of mechanisms that are not yet fully understood (6Ramos J.L. Duque E. Gallegos M.T. Godoy P. Ramos-González M.I. Rojas A. Terán W. Segura A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2002; 56: 743-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 7Segura A. Terán W.

However, a number of factors involved in the process have been characterized over the last 10 years (for review, see Ref. 6Ramos J.L. Duque E. Gallegos M.T. Godoy P. Ramos-González M.I. Rojas A.

Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 3067-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Although extrusion of the solvent is probably the most important mechanism of solvent resistance, this phenomenon involves other factors such as membrane rigidification via cis to trans isomerization of the unsaturated fatty acids (16Junker F. Ramos J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5693-5700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17von Wallbrunn A. Richnow H.H. Neumann G. Meinhardt F. Heipieper H.J. J.

Ramos J.L. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 5937-5945Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Finally, exposure of P. putida cells to solvents and chaotropic agents triggers a heat-shock (HS) response that is likely to require a share of the available gene expression machinery of the cell (18Segura A. Godoy P. van Dillewijn P. Hurtado A. Arroyo N. Santacruz S. Ramos J.L. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 5937-5945Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 19Santos P.M. Benndorf D. Sa-Correia I. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 2640-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The issue at stake is, thus, how P. putida cells harboring a relatively stable transcriptional machinery are able to process all three different inputs from toluene; that is, a nutritional signal bound to trigger a large metabolic program, a toxic signal that triggers a solvent extrusion and tolerance response, and interference with the protein folding machinery leading to activation of the HS regulon. How the strain is able to manage all three tasks has not been examined because of the dearth of suitable technology (20Cases I. de Lorenzo V. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In this study we used a genome-wide DNA array setup to inspect in detail the immediate changes in global expression pattern of P. putida KT2440 in response to exposure to three different aromatic compounds; toluene, a metabolizable aromatic hydrocarbon (a carbon source and a stressor), o-xylene, a gratuitous counterpart known to induce the degradation pathway but which cannot be metabolized (21Abril M.A. Michán C. Timmis K.N. Ramos J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6782-6790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (and, thus, acts only as a stressor), and 3MB, a specific inducer of the lower TOL pathway (primarily a C-source with lower toxicity). Our main objectives were to understand how the presence of all three compounds (i.e. of two contradictory signals) is differentially sensed, to detect the direct consequences of their presence, and to determine the short-term global outcome on the genetic program. Our results reveal that after exposure to aromatic compounds a strong and specific metabolic response at the level of aromatic pathways is concomitant with a general stress response at several levels, reflected by the induction of genes known to respond to membrane damage, oxidative stress, and misfolding of soluble proteins. The interplay between the HS response, the induction of catabolic pathways, the synthesis of efflux pumps, and the stimulation of amino acid biosynthesis resulted in distinct patterns of transcription under all three conditions. Interestingly, these patterns appear to reflect a shift of resources available to the transcriptional machinery from possibly more dispensable functions and toward these vital tasks. Furthermore, our data suggest that the regulatory network behind this metabolic and genetic interplay is not fortuitous but reflects how priorities in the use of the transcriptional machinery are established in different expression programs. Bacterial Strains, Culture, and Growth Conditions—P. putida KT2440 (pWW0) was grown on M9 minimal medium (21Abril M.A. Michán C. Timmis K.N. Ramos J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6782-6790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with 25 mm citrate as a carbon source. 500-ml flasks containing 100 ml of this culture medium were inoculated with P. putida KT2440 to reach a turbidity of 0.03 and shaken at 30 °C and 200 rpm until the turbidity of the culture reached 0.7 ± 0.05 at 660 nm. Then the cultures were exposed to a 1 mm concentration of the different organic compounds, a concentration that neither inhibits cell growth nor affects cell viability. After 15 min, culture samples (15 ml) were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C in tubes precooled in liquid nitrogen, and the cell pellets were immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. The PbenA::lacZ transcriptional fusion was constructed by creating an XbaI site downstream from the transcription start site of P. putida KT2440 benA gene and cloning a 0.7-kilobase EcoRV-XbaI fragment containing the PbenA promoter between the BglII-XbaI cloning sites of the broad-host range vector pMP220 (22Spaink H.P.

The chips are also endowed with homogeneity controls consisting of oligonucleotides for the rpoD and rpoN genes spotted at 20 different positions as well as duplicate negative controls at 203 predefined positions (www.progenika.com). RNA Isolation—RNA was extracted from cells with the hot acidphenol isolation procedure (25Fawcett J. Pawson T. Science. 2000; 290: 725-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To this end the cell pellet was resuspended in 1.6 ml of LETS buffer prewarmed to 75 °C (100 mm LiCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0) and transferred to a prewarmed 15-ml tube containing 1 ml of glass beads (106-mm acid washed, Sigma) and 1.2 ml of acid phenol. The mixture was thoroughly vortexed for 3 min to complete cell lysis. Then 1.2 ml of chloroform was added, and tubes were vortexed for 30 s. The solution was centrifuged at 3200 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Samples (1.6 ml) of the aqueous phase were recovered and transferred to a 15-ml tube containing 1.6 ml of acid phenol at 75 °C. The sample was thoroughly mixed for 3 min and centrifuged at 3200 × g for 10 min. Samples of the aqueous phase (2 × 0.7 ml) were recovered, precipitated with 0.7 ml of isopropanol at room temperature, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was washed with 1 ml of 75% (v/v) ethanol (4 °C), dried, and resuspended in 75 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate/double distilled H2O. Then 1.2 ml of TRIzol (Sigma) was added to each sample, and the mixture was vortexed for 15 s and left to stand for 5 min at room temperature. Then 0.24 ml of chloroform was added, and the mixture was shaken and left to stand for 3 min at room temperature. Finally, samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min (4 °C). The aqueous phase (0.7 ml) was recovered and precipitated with 0.7 ml of isopropanol. The pellet was washed with 1 ml of 75% (v/v) ethanol (4 °C), dried, and resuspended in 15-25 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate/double distilled H2O. Samples were heated to 55-60 °C for 5 min and stored at -80 °C. The integrity and purity of the RNA were checked with agarose gel electrophoresis to rule out any traces of DNA. The concentration of RNA was measured spectrophotometrically at 260 nm. Labeling and Hybridization Conditions—cDNA was generated from RNA samples by direct incorporation of Cy3- or Cy5-labeled dUTP into cDNA. Differentially labeled samples from two different conditions were mixed and hybridized to the P. putida microarrays. For each experiment three independent biological replicates were done. For each reaction, RNA (30 μg) was incubated with 0.5 μg of random hexamers (Amersham Biosciences) at 70 °C for 10 min and then chilled on ice for 2 min. A mix containing 1× reverse transcription buffer, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, deoxynucleotide triphosphates (0.5 mm dATP, 0.5 mm dGTP, 0.5 mm dCTP, and 0.2 mm dTTP), 40 units of RNase OUT (Invitrogen), and either Cy3-dUTP or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the RNA primer mixture and incubated at 25 °C for 5 min. Superscript II reverse transcriptase (200 units, Invitrogen) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 10 min and then at 42 °C for 120 min. The reaction was stopped by heating the reaction mixture at 70 °C for 15 min. The RNA was then digested with RNase H (2 units, Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 20 min. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed through QiaQuick purification spin columns (Qiagen). The purified probes were mixed, dried, and reconstituted in 30 μl of hybridization buffer (3× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.2% (w/v) SDS, 5% dextran sulfate, 50% (v/v) formamide). Before hybridization, the probe was heated at 95 °C for 2 min, applied directly onto the microarray slide, and covered with a glass coverslip (24 × 60 mm). The array was hybridized overnight at 50 °C in a humidified hybridization chamber. After hybridization, the slides were washed for 5 min in 2× SSC and 0.1% (w/v) SDS (final volume 500 ml) followed by two 5-min washes in 50 ml of 1× SSC and 0.1× SSC. Before scanning, the slides were spun at 1600 × g for 5 min to remove residual salts. Finally, slides were scanned on a GMS 418 apparatus (Genetic Microsystems, Inc.). Separate images were acquired for Cy3 and Cy5 and then processed and analyzed with GenePix 4.0 software (Axon Instruments, Inc.). Data Analysis—After background subtraction, signal intensities for each replica were normalized and statistically analyzed using the Lowess intensity-dependent normalization method (26Yang Y.H. Dudoit S. Luu P. Lin D.M. Peng V. Ngai J. Speed T.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e15Crossref PubMed Scopus (2834) Google Scholar) included in the Almazen System software (Alma Bioinformatics S.L.). p values were calculated with Student's t test algorithm based on the differences between log 2 ratio values for each biological replicate. Genes were considered differentially expressed when they fulfilled the filter parameters of expression ratio ≥1.8 and p value ≤0.2. Cluster and Treeview software (27Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13267) Google Scholar) were used to group and visualize genes whose expression varied in the same direction in response to all three aromatic compounds. Then a hierarchical clustering algorithm based on the average linkage method was used to identify genes that were expressed differentially under all three experimental conditions. Western Blots—P. putida KT2440 (pWW0) was grown as described under “Bacterial Strains, Culture, and Growth Conditions”; after 15 min of challenge with aromatic compounds the cells (100 ml) were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellets were resuspended, washed once in 1× M9 buffer, and resuspended again in 2 ml of lysis buffer containing Tris 50 mm, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1× Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed by sonication, and the insoluble fraction was discarded by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 20 min. Aliquot fractions of the supernatant containing 70 μg of total protein were analyzed on SDS-PAGE (12.5% (w/v)) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked for 3 h at room temperature with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with monoclonal antibodies against Escherichia coli σ32 subunit (Neoclone), diluted 1:1000, washed with phosphatebuffered saline solution, and incubated with goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G+L conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:1000 dilution) for 1 h (Caltag Laboratories). The blots were developed with the SuperSignal® West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce). Chemiluminescent blots were exposed to autoradiographic film for 30 s to 2 min. Swimming Assay—The medium used for assays was M9 citrate that contained 0.3% (w/v) agar and 0.05% (w/v) tetrazolium red. Swim plates were inoculated with bacteria from an overnight culture in M9 citrate agar (1.2% (w/v)) plates with a sterile toothpick. The plates were kept for 14-16 h at 30 °C in humidified containers to prevent dehydration. Plates were then photographed. Hydrogen Peroxide Production—P. putida KT2440 (pWW0) was grown on M9 with citrate as a carbon source to a turbidity of 0.7 at 660 nm. The cultures were then exposed to 5 mm concentrations of different organic compounds. After 5 and 30 min of exposure, 10 ml of the culture was harvested by centrifugation, and the cells were broken as described above. We used 50 μl of the cell-free extract to determine the hydrogen peroxide concentration as described in Buege and Aust (28Buege J.A. Aust S.D. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (10913) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase Assays—P. putida KT2440 (pMQ220EV) cells bearing or not bearing plasmid pWW0 were grown overnight on M9 citrate and diluted 1/100 in fresh medium, and cultures were divided in four aliquot fractions (10 ml each). After 1 h at 30 °C,oneofthe fractions was supplemented with 1 mm 3MB, another one with toluene, and a third one with o-xylene. The remaining fraction was kept without the addition of aromatics. Samples for β-galactosidase activity assays were taken 3 h after induction. β-Galactosidase activity was determined in permeabilized whole cells according to Miller (29Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. 1972; (Cold Spring Harbor, NY): 352-355Google Scholar). Supplemental Material—Complete microarray datasets are available as Microsoft Excel files. Supplemental Tables 1-11 show the most relevant changes. P. putida KT2440 Genome-wide Microarrays Reveal a Massive Response to Aromatic Compounds—The DNA microarrays described previously (23Yuste L. Hervás A.B. Canosa I. Tobes R. Jiménez J.I. Nogales J. Pérez-Pérez M.M. Santero E. Díaz E. Ramos J.L. de Lorenzo V. Rojo F. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 8: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) were used to study the global expression profile of P. putida (pWW0) in response to metabolizable (toluene and 3MB) and nonmetabolizable (o-xylene) aromatic compounds. P. putida (pWW0) grows in M9 minimal medium with citrate as the sole carbon source with a duplication time of about 70 ± 4 min. When cultures reached the mid-exponential growth phase (turbidity at 660 nm 0.7 ± 0.05) they were split into four aliquots. One was kept as a control, and 1 mm toluene, o-xylene, or 3MB was added to the other three. This concentration of aromatic compounds was sublethal, and 100% of the cells survived the addition of these chemicals. To analyze the early events in the response to these compounds, samples were collected 15 min after the addition of the tested aromatics, and total RNA was prepared from all cultures. Our statistical analysis of the microarray data indicates low interexperiment variance between replicates. On the basis of our data, we selected changes of 1.8-fold or more in mRNA levels between aromatic compound-treated and untreated preparations as significant. A total of 180, 185, and 64 genes were significantly up-regulated in response to toluene, o-xylene, and 3MB respectively, with o-xylene and toluene sharing 69 up-regulated genes (Fig. 2). On the other hand, 127, 217, and 69 genes were significantly down-regulated in toluene-, o-xylene-, and 3MB-treated cultures. All three treatments produced a similar downregulation in 18 genes (Fig. 2), all of them related to membrane functions or energy transduction. Most up-regulated genes shared by all three aromatic treatments were related to the heat-sock response and general metabolism. These genes were grouped as proposed previously according to the metabolic function of the corresponding products (30Tatusov R.L. Mushegian A.R. Bork P. Brown N.P. Hayes W.S. Borodovsky M. Rudd K.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 279-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), e.g. metabolism of aromatic compounds, gene regulation, stress response, energy metabolism, transport of metabolites, chemotaxis, etc. (Fig. 3; see also below and supplemental Tables 1-11). Both up-regulated and downregulated genes were found in most physiological groups with the exception of those genes grouped under “energy metabolism,” “piliflagella,” and “protein metabolism,” where the presence of any of the aromatics caused repression in all cases. For most groups, o-xylene had the most pronounced effect. These general effects were concomitant with HS response, general stress endurance, and peripheral pathways for aromatic compound metabolism, among others (Fig. 3). These results and their significance are analyzed in detail below. Specific Metabolic Response to Aromatics; Induction of Distinct Segments of the Aromatic Degradation Pathways—Of all the known effects caused by toluene, o-xylene, and 3MB on P. putida KT2440 (pWW0), the best documented is induction of the promoters of TOL operons through two regulatory proteins specifically responding to the presence of aromatics (Fig. 1). We, therefore, used the output of xyl genes as a positive control to assess the performance of the array and then as an internal validation control. Fig. 4 highlights the changes in the expression of catabolic genes involved in the reaction of P. putida KT2440 (pWW0) to the three aromatic inducers we compared (see also supplemental Table 11). As expected, the whole of the TOL upper pathway was induced in response to both toluene and o-xylene. Although not identical, the results with the metabolizable substrate toluene were similar to those with o-xylene, which cannot serve as a substrate, although it is able to induce expression of the xyl genes by activating the XylR regulatory protein (21Abril M.A. Michán C. Timmis K.N. Ramos J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6782-6790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the genes for the meta-cleavage pathway was also detected in response to both aromatic hydrocarbons and to 3MB (Fig. 4B). The differences in activation of the meta-cleavage pathway in response to toluene and o-xylene should be considered in terms of metabolism; whereas toluene yields benzoate which activates the XylS meta-cleavage regulator, o-xylene cannot be metabolized, and internal production of the cognate XylS effector is prevented (Fig. 1). The low levels of meta-cleavage pathway induction with this aromatic are most probably due to the so-called cascade activation through XylS overproduction (4Ramos J.L. Marqués S. Timmis K.N. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 341-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the global analysis allowed us to detect differences in the induction levels of the different regions of the upper and meta operons (Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting additional regulatory steps in TOL gene expression regulation, e.g. changes in mRNA stability of different segments of the operon, which is transcribed as a single polycistronic mRNA (31Harayama S. Rekik M. Wubbolts M. Rose K. Leppik R.A. Timmis K.N. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5048-5055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Marqués S. Ramos J.L. Timmis K.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Yet the results summarized in Fig. 4, A and B, not only confirmed data reported in the literature in the past years but also new features of this pathway. The benABCDKEZF operon, present in the P. putida chromosome, specifies a conserved ortho-cleavage route for benzoate metabolism, which coexists with TOL plasmid pathways. Our data showed that 3MB, whose metabolism via the chromosomal ortho-cleavage pathway is nonproductive and leads to the accumulation of dead-end products (33Rojo F. Pieper D.H. Engesser K.H. Knackmuss H.J. Timmis K.N. Science. 1987; 238: 1395-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), significantly induced this pathway (Fig. 4C). Toluene, which gives rise to unsubstituted benzoate through the action of the upper TOL pathway enzymes, induced the chromosomal ben route to lower levels than the induction caused by o-xylene, which is unable to act as a substrate for the TOL upper pathway enzymes. Our interpretation of this result is that XylS, which is overproduced in the presence of o-xylene, is responsible for this induction. The pWW0-encoded XylS regulator"

Our goal was to identify compounds that block Wnt signaling as a first step toward investigating new strategies for suppression of invasive and other breast cancers. In a limited phytonutrient screen, EGCG ((–)-epigallocatechin 3-gallate), the major phytochemical in green tea, emerged as an intriguing candidate. Epidemiological studies have associated green tea consumption with reduced recurrence of invasive and other breast cancers. Wnt signaling was inhibited by EGCG in a dose-dependent manner in breast cancer cells. The apparent mechanism targeted the HBP1 transcriptional repressor, which we had previously characterized as a suppressor of Wnt signaling. EGCG treatment induced HBP1 transcriptional repressor levels through an increase in HBP1 mRNA stability, but not transcriptional initiation. To test functionality, DNA-based short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to knockdown the endogenous HBP1 gene. Consistently, the HBP1 knockdown lines had reduced sensitivity to EGCG in the suppression of Wnt signaling and of a target gene (c-MYC). Because our ongoing studies clinically link abrogation of HBP1 with invasive breast cancer, we tested if EGCG also regulated biological functions associated with de-regulated Wnt signaling and with invasive breast cancer. EGCG reduced both breast cancer cell tumorigenic proliferation and invasiveness in an HBP1-dependent manner. Together, the emerging mechanism is that EGCG blocks Wnt signaling by inducing the HBP1 transcriptional repressor and inhibits aspects of invasive breast cancer. These studies provide a framework for considering future studies in breast cancer treatment and prevention.

These studies provide a framework for considering future studies in breast cancer treatment and prevention. Breast cancer afflicts 1 in 8 women over her lifetime. Whereas the widespread use of mammography has greatly improved breast cancer survival, the increasingly frequent detection of earlier breast cancers highlights a need for better prognosis and prevention. The most frequently detected early types are now ductal carcinoma in situ and infiltrating ductal carcinoma (also known as invasive breast cancer) (1Harris J. Lippman M.E. Morrow M. Osbourne C.K. Diseases of the Breast. Second Ed. Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, 2000Google Scholar). The investigation of mechanisms and candidate compounds that may limit increased proliferation and invasiveness in breast cancers could advance new clinical strategies for prognosis and for preventing progression. In this paper, we investigated the green tea compound EGCG 2The abbreviations used are: EGCG, (–)-epigallocatechin 3-gallate; HA, hemagglutinin; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; RT, reverse transcriptase; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; TCF, T-cell factor; LEF, lymphocyte enhancing factor. 2The abbreviations used are: EGCG, (–)-epigallocatechin 3-gallate; HA, hemagglutinin; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; RT, reverse transcriptase; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; TCF, T-cell factor; LEF, lymphocyte enhancing factor. in the suppression of Wnt signaling. These studies highlight how knowledge from disparate disciplines can be used to address a possible link to breast cancer mechanisms. In this section, the relevant background into Wnt signaling and the green tea compound EGCG is summarized.Constitutive Wnt signaling has emerged as a paradigm in breast and other cancers (reviewed in Refs. 2Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 3Howe L.R. Brown A.M. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2004; 3: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Current knowledge indicates that genetic and biochemical de-regulation can result in aberrant Wnt signaling. The essential event in Wnt signaling is the stabilization of β-catenin. The resulting accumulation of β-catenin increases the pool of nuclear β-catenin bound to transcription factor TCF/LEF in complexes that can activate certain genes that ultimately establish the oncogenic phenotype. In numerous cancers, there are reports of loss-of-function mutations in APC and Axin, and gain-of-function mutations in β-catenin (reviewed in Ref. 4Reya T. Clevers H. Nature. 2005; 434: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (2986) Google Scholar). De-regulated Wnt signaling by genetic or biochemical means triggers an oncogenic gene expression program that contributes to breast tumorigenesis (3Howe L.R. Brown A.M. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2004; 3: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Wnt gene targets with clinical interest include Cyclin D1 and c-MYC. Finally, recent studies hint that Wnt signaling may have a broader impact through an autocrine mechanism and may provide another explanation of how β-catenin levels may accumulate in the absence of genetic mutation of Wnt pathway components (5Liu B.Y. McDermott S.P. Khwaja S.S. Alexander C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4158-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar).Wnt1 was the first oncogene that was discovered by mammary-specific murine mammary tumor virus retroviral insertion. Transgenic expression of Wnt remains an established model of breast tumorigenesis. As known G1 regulators Cyclin D1 and c-MYC are established oncogenes with overexpression in breast cancers. The ongoing definition of new gene targets indicate that constitutive Wnt signaling may affect angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis, which are important processes in cancer (2Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of an unexpectedly wide role in breast cancer processes, compounds and proteins that limit Wnt signaling in cancer may have an impact for prevention and treatment (6Logan C.Y. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 781-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (4177) Google Scholar).We have reported that the HBP1 transcriptional repressor is a suppressor of Wnt signaling (7Sampson E.M. Haque Z.K. Ku M.C. Tevosian S.G. Albanese C. Pestell R.G. Paulson K.E. Yee A.S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4500-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). HBP1 is a high mobility group box containing transcription factor, like the LEF and TCF transcription factors in the Wnt pathway. HBP1 was also characterized as a transcriptional repressor and cell cycle inhibitor in cells and animals (8Lavender P. Vandel L. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T.

Shih H. Pediatr. Pathol. Mol. Med. 1999; 18: 275-302Google Scholar). HBP1 suppresses Wnt signaling at the level of the transcriptional activation, thereby preventing the expression of genes that would otherwise establish the oncogenic phenotype. In the context of Wnt signaling, HBP1 suppressed the expression of endogenous Cyclin D1 and c-MYC (7Sampson E.M. Haque Z.K. Ku M.C. Tevosian S.G. Albanese C. Pestell R.G. Paulson K.E. Yee A.S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4500-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Our recent studies indicate that other relevant breast cancer pathways may be regulated by the HBP1 transcriptional repressor (Ref. 17Berasi S.P. Xiu M. Yee A.S. Paulson K.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3011-3024Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar and see “Discussion”). Finally, functional loss of HBP1 has been shown to be associated with invasive breast cancer. 3K. E. Paulson, K. R. Christ, M. A. McDevitt, C. Kuperwasser, J. Kim, X. Zhang, M. Hu, S. P. Berasi, C. Y. Huang, R. H. Paganelli, D. Giri, S. Kauffman, J. Blum, G. Netto, Z. M. Huang, D. E. Wazer, I.

Kauffman, J. Blum, G. Netto, Z. M. Huang, D. E. Wazer, I. Summerhayes, and A. S. Yee, submitted for publication. Strikingly, mutants/variants of HBP1 were observed in 30% of patients with invasive disease. No HBP1 mutants/variants were observed in either controls or patients with ductal carcinoma in situ. Furthermore, HBP1 mutants/variants were uniformly defective in Wnt signaling and suppression of growth and invasiveness. 3K. E. Paulson, K. R. Christ, M. A. McDevitt, C. Kuperwasser, J. Kim, X. Zhang, M. Hu, S. P. Berasi, C. Y. Huang, R. H. Paganelli, D. Giri, S. Kauffman, J. Blum, G. Netto, Z. M. Huang, D. E. Wazer, I. Summerhayes, and A. S. Yee, submitted for publication. The sum of both the molecular and clinical data suggests that HBP1 is a candidate gene that may have a role in breast cancer progression, and that HBP1 may be a useful target for prevention and treatment of breast cancer.To identify possible compounds, we surveyed the epidemiological and nutritional literature to identify natural compounds that may block constitutive Wnt signaling. Epidemiological studies have long linked the consumption of certain foods to reduced cancer prevalence. Phytonutrient compounds from green tea, tomato, red wine, and other foods have been identified. The definition of bioactive food components provides an opportunity to test their role in specific signaling pathways that may have cancer preventative impact. These investigations may also provide new informative biomarkers as indicators of treatment efficacy. Whereas we initially screened several candidate phytonutrients, the focus of this paper is the green tea compound EGCG ((–)-epigallocatechin gallate), which is the principal bioactive component. Several epidemiological studies have highlighted green tea consumption with decreased occurrence of several cancers (reviewed in Ref. 19Fujiki H. Suganuma M. Imai K. Nakachi K. Cancer Lett. 2002; 188: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Green tea consumption has been associated with the appearance of less aggressive breast cancer and an overall reduced rate of breast cancer recurrence in Japanese women (20Nakachi K. Suemasu K. Suga K. Takeo T. Imai K. Higashi Y. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1998; 89: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 21Inoue M. Tajima K. Mizutani M. Iwata H. Iwase T. Miura S. Hirose K. Hamajima N.

Brewed green tea is about 0.1% EGCG solution (w/v), or up to 2 mm. Green tea and EGCG (equivalent of 4–8 cups/day) have been tested in humans with no appreciable side effects and in United States phase 1 and 2 trials (Refs. 23Chow H.H. Cai Y. Hakim I.A. Crowell J.A.

Nutr. 2000; 71 (1703S–1694S): 1698S-1702SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several animal studies have begun to define EGCG preventative effects. The oral delivery of EGCG reduced tumor progression in animal models of breast cancer (26Sartippour M.R. Heber D. Ma J. Lu Q. Go V.L. Nguyen M. Nutr. Cancer. 2001; 40: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 27Kavanagh K.T. Hafer L.J. Kim D.W. Mann K.K. Sherr D.H. Rogers A.E. Sonenshein G.E. J. Cell.

Last, EGCG contributes to suppression of intestinal tumors in the Min mice, which arise through an Apc mutation and is an animal model of constitutive Wnt signaling. In somatic colon cancer, the prevalent APC mutations represent the earliest defined stage in the colon cancer pathway (reviewed Ref. 28Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4252) Google Scholar and 29Arends J.W. J. Pathol. 2000; 190: 412-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Together, EGCG is a very intriguing compound for cancer prevention.Our results indicate that EGCG blocked Wnt signaling through the HBP1 transcriptional repressor that was previously shown to inhibit Wnt signaling. The data in this paper supports a model by which EGCG induces HBP1 by stabilizing its mRNA and not through transcriptional induction. EGCG-induced HBP1 blocked Wnt signaling and cellular processes that are relevant to invasive breast cancer. Collectively, these studies further establish a role of HBP1 in suppressing Wnt signaling and define another signaling context for future EGCG applications in breast cancer prevention and treatment.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals, Cell Culture, and Transfection—MDA-MB-231 were cultured in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), and 10 mm l-glutamine. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). NIH 3T3 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), and 10 mm l-glutamine. Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000. HCT116 and HEK293T were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), and 10 mm l-glutamine. EGCG was purchased from Sigma. Puromycin was obtained from Sigma and used at either 0.5 (human cell lines) or 5 μg/ml (mouse cell lines).Plasmids—The pEFBOS vectors were used to express hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged versions of human HBP1 wild type and mutants, which were published (13Tevosian S.G. Shih H. Mendelson K.G. Sheppard K.A. Paulson K.E. Yee A.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 16Yang J. Mani S.A. Donaher J.L. Ramaswamy S. Itzykson R.A. Come C. Savagner P. Gitelman I. Richardson A. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2004; 117: 927-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3039) Google Scholar). HA epitope-tagged HBP1 cDNA was subcloned into the pBabe-Puro vector for the construction of HBP1 overexpressing cell lines. TOPFLASH, FOPFLASH, CMV-HA-β-cateninΔ45, and CMV Wnt1 were previously described (see Ref. 7Sampson E.M. Haque Z.K. Ku M.C. Tevosian S.G. Albanese C. Pestell R.G. Paulson K.E. Yee A.S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4500-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). HBP1 shRNA were provided by the DNA-based shRNA-expressing retroviral vector pSR (Oligoengine). Three shRNA coding oligos against human HBP1 were designed and verified to be specific to HBP1 by Blast search. The most effective HBP1 small interfering RNA target sequence is ACTGTGAGTGCCACTTCTC, which was used in all subsequent experiments. DNA encompassing 2 kb upstream to +83 bp of the HBP1 transcription start site was cloned into the pGL3basic luciferase vector (gift of Michael A. McDevitt).Viral Production and Infection of Target Cells—Amphotropic retroviral supernatants were produced by transfection of phoenix packaging cells by FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics). After 48 h, the tissue culture medium was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter. The viral supernatant was used for infection of cells after addition of 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). Cells were infected for 3 h and allowed to recover for 24 h with fresh medium. The infected cells were selected with puromycin.SYBR Green Real-time RT-PCR—The HBP1 RT-PCR forward primer (EX 4-5) was ATCATCTCCTGTACACATCATAGC and the reverse primer (EX 7-3) was CATAGAAAGGGTGGTCCAGCTTAC. The HBP1 pre-mRNA RT-PCR forward primer is EX 4-5 as above, whereas the reverse primer was AGTTTAACCTCATAAATAAACTTAC (Intron 4-3). cMyc forward and reverse primers for real-time RT-PCR were 5′-GGCTTTATCTAACTCGCTGTAG and 3′-GAGTCGTAGTCGAGGTCATAGTTC. 18 S forward and reverse primers were GTCTGTGATGCCCTTAGATG and AGCTTATGACCCGCACTTAC. Total RNA was extracted using RNAeasy Mini kits (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed with the random hexamer mixture (iScript, Bio-Rad). The resulting cDNA were used for real-time PCR performed on Opticon (MJ Research). SYBR Green master mixture was purchased from Bio-Rad. All quantitations were normalized to an endogenous 18 S RNA control. The relative quantitative value for each target gene compared with the calibrator for the target was expressed as comparative Ct (2–(ΔCt-Cc)) method (Ct and Cc are the mean threshold cycle differences after normalizing to 18 S). Real-time RT-PCR experiments were performed in triplicate and the percent coefficient of variation for the set value was less than 0.1. PCR efficiency with given primers was between 95 and 105%. Melting curves were also performed for identification of primer-specific amplicons; the HBP1 mRNA melting temperature Tm was 86 °C, the HBP1 pre-mRNA (exon 4-inton 4) Tm was 84.5 °C, whereas the 18 S Tm was 90 °C.Reporter Assays—A 100-mm plate was harvested 48 h after transfection and lysed using 300 μl of Promega lysis buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, 0.2% Triton X-100, pH 7.5) supplemented with 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. After three freeze-thaw cycles, lysates were rocked for 30 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 × g. The amount of luciferase enzyme in each lysate was determined using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according the manufacturer's protocol. Transfection efficiency was normalized using transfected RSV-β-gal (Rous sarcoma virus vector with β-galactosidase). β-Galactosidase activity was quantitated using the colorimetric substrate o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma).Western Blotting—Whole cell lysates were prepared from pelleted cells by extraction for 30 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/μl pepstatin). Cytoplasmic lysates were prepared identically except using cytoplasmic lysis buffer (20% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaCl, 0.2 m EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotonin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate). Nuclear lysates were then prepared from the cytoplasmic pellet using nuclear lysis buffer (20% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 500 mm NaCl, 0.2 m EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotonin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate). All lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 15 min at 14,000 × g and frozen at –80 °C. For detection of transfected HA-tagged HBP1, the HA.11 antibody (Covance) was used at 1:1000 dilution. The polyclonal rabbit antibody to HBP1 was as previously described (12Shih H. Tevosian S.G. Yee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4732-4743Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) or was purchased (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The β-catenin antibody was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. The phosphoserine 33/41 β-catenin was purchased from Cell Signaling. Western blots were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Statistical Analysis—All statistical analyses were done by two-way analysis of variance with the Tukey test, using SAS program version 9.12.RESULTSThe Green Tea Polyphenol EGCG Inhibits Wnt Signaling and the Wnt Target Gene c-MYC—We initially screened several bioactive compounds from foods and diets that are linked to reduced cancer risk for the suppression of Wnt signaling. These compounds included EGCG (green tea), curcumin (turmeric), resveratrol (red wine), and lycopene (tomato). Based on initial results, EGCG was selected for further analysis. To delineate the target of action in the canonical Wnt pathway, the impact of EGCG was assessed in cells in which Wnt signaling was activated at different points (7Sampson E.M. Haque Z.K. Ku M.C. Tevosian S.G. Albanese C. Pestell R.G. Paulson K.E. Yee A.S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4500-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Wnt signaling was activated by either: 1) expression of Wnt, or 2) through inhibition of GSK-3β using LiCl or SB 415286 (30Cross D.A. Culbert A.A. Chalmers K.A. Facci L. Skaper S.D. Reith A.D. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 31Coghlan M.P. Culbert A.A. Cross D.A. Corcoran S.L. Yates J.W. Pearce N.J. Rausch O.L. Murphy G.J. Carter P.S. Cox L.

All protocols give increased β-catenin stability and robust transcriptional activation through LEF/TCF sites (assessed by the TOPFLASH reporter consisting of three LEF/TCF sites fused to a minimal c-FOS promoter). The FOPFLASH reporter containing mutant LEF/TCF sites was used as a negative control. Finally, we tested the impact of EGCG on expression of the c-MYC gene, a documented Wnt target. These approaches provide a clear and simple framework for identifying any effects of EGCG on Wnt signaling. Whereas the primary focus of this paper is breast, it is important to verify results in other cell types to address generality.As shown in Fig. 1A, in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells, the TOPFLASH reporter was strongly induced by either transfected Wnt, whereas the FOPFLASH control was only marginally affected by either activator. Data bars represent -fold induction of the reporter by the stimulus relative to the basal reporter activity. EGCG treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells suppressed Wnt signaling in a dose-dependent manner from 25 to 100 μm, whereas there was no change in the control FOPFLASH reporter. Importantly, similar results were obtained, regardless of whether the Wnt pathway was activated by transfected Wnt or transfected β-catenin. Similar results for EGCG inhibition were observed in 293T cells activated by Wnt or GSK-3β inhibition (Fig. 1B) and in NIH 3T3 cells (not shown). Last, the results with HCT116 cells show that constitutive Wnt signaling (due to a stabilizing β-catenin mutation) is also repressed by EGCG (Fig. 1C).To corroborate the signaling results, we next investigated the c-MYC gene as a relevant Wnt target gene (32He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. daCosta L. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K. Science. 1998; 281: 1509-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4047) Google Scholar) in which increased expression is linked to breast and other cancers. c-MYC has a defined role in G1 control and is an established oncogene. Recent studies have indicated that c-MYC has a key role in human cell transformation in oncogene complementation studies and in the regulation of the telomerase gene, which is a critical component in transformation (33Hahn W.C.

Med. 2004; 10: 344-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that the expression of endogenous c-MYC was decreased by HBP1 overexpression and upon suppression of Wnt signaling (7Sampson E.M. Haque Z.K. Ku M.C. Tevosian S.G. Albanese C. Pestell R.G. Paulson K.E. Yee A.S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4500-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). As measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 1D), activation of Wnt signaling by inhibition of GSK-3β induces c-Myc expression. Like the Wnt signaling experiments in Fig. 1, A–C, the induction of the c-MYC target gene was also blocked by EGCG. The conclusion of Fig. 1 for both breast and non-breast lines is that EGCG can block Wnt signaling. Whereas the focus of most of the later experiments in the paper will be breast cancer, the results may have a wider impact on other cancers.HBP1 Contributes to the Suppression of Wnt Signaling and Gene Expression by EGCG—The experiments of Fig. 1 suggested two testable mechanisms for EGCG blocking Wnt signaling: 1) EGCG might trigger a reduction in β-catenin levels, or 2) EGCG might increase the levels of HBP1. Previously, we showed that HBP1 is a suppressor of Wnt signaling by inhibiting the LEF/TCF/β-catenin transcriptional activation complex (7Sampson E.M. Haque Z.K. Ku M.C. Tevosian S.G. Albanese C. Pestell R.G. Paulson K.E. Yee A.S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4500-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, endogenous β-catenin levels were unchanged with EGCG treatment. In addition, both the phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK-3β, as well as total, cytoplasmic and nuclear β-catenin levels were unchanged (Fig. 2B), further supporting the lack of change in β-catenin levels with EGCG. However, we observed that in 293T cells (Fig. 2A) and in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 4A), endogenous HBP1 protein levels increased with EGCG treatment. These results were extended with the observation that EGCG treatment increased HBP1 mRNA, as measured by real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 3A). Thus, EGCG increased expression of HBP1, suggesting that HBP1 may be a plausible target of EGCG action in the inhibition of Wnt signaling.FIGURE 2EGCG increases HBP1 expression levels but notβ-catenin levels. A, expression of HBP1 protein is increased with EGCG. HEK 293T cells were incubated with 50 or 100 μm EGCG and analyzed by Western blot for HBP1 and β-catenin protein. A blot for p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase was used as a loading control, as levels are unchanged with treatment. Total HBP1 protein increased in a dose-dependent manner, whereas total β-catenin remained constant. B, β-catenin and phosphorylated β-catenin protein levels are unchanged with EGCG treatment. Top panel, nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins were prepared from MDA-MB-231 cells. A Western blot was performed on protein lysates using anti-β-catenin. Protein levels were normalized with anti-α-tubulin as a loading control. Lower panel, MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with either 100 μm EGCG, 40μm SB415286, or a combination for 24 h, then analyzed by immunoblot (IB) with anti-β-catenin and anti-phospho-β-catenin. Protein levels were normalized with anti-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase as a loading control. As expected, the GSK-3β inhibitor SB415286 treatment inhibited phosphorylation of β-catenin while leading to a significant increase in total β-catenin. However, at the high [EGCG], no significant alteration of phospho- or total β-catenin was detected.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 4HBP1-shRNA knockdown, EGCG induction, and increased Wnt signaling.

Because a key hepatic factor, hepatic nuclear factor-4 (HNF-4), is crucial for the expression of many of these genes, we examined whether CAR could suppress HNF-4 transactivation. Expression of CAR inhibited HNF-4 transactivation of CYP7A1, a key gene in bile acid synthesis, in HepG2 cells, and mutation of the DNA binding domain of CAR impaired this inhibition. Gel shift assays revealed that CAR competes with HNF-4 for binding to the DR1 motif in the CYP7A1 promoter. TCPOBOP, a CAR agonist that increases the interaction of CAR with coactivators, potentiated CAR inhibition of HNF-4 transactivation. Furthermore, inhibition by CAR was reversed by expression of increasing amounts of GRIP-1 or PGC-1α, indicating that CAR competes with HNF-4 for these coactivators. Treatment of mice with phenobarbital or TCPOBOP resulted in decreased hepatic mRNA levels of the reported genes down-regulated by CAR, including Cyp7a1 and Pepck. In vivo recruitment of endogenous CAR to the promoters of Cyp7a1 and Pepck was detected in mouse liver after phenobarbital treatment, whereas association of HNF-4 and coactivators, GRIP-1, p300, and PGC-1α, with these promoters was significantly decreased. Our data suggest that CAR inhibits HNF-4 activity by competing with HNF-4 for binding to the DR1 motif and to the common coactivators, GRIP-1 and PGC-1α, which may be a general mechanism by which CAR down-regulates key genes in hepatic lipid and glucose metabolism.

Nature. 2000; 407: 920-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Although CAR-mediated induction of microsomal P450 enzymes is generally protective for liver function, it can be harmful if toxic metabolites are produced, which was shown by the observation that CAR null mice treated with acetaminophen were resistant to the liver toxicity induced by acetaminophen metabolites (3Zhang J. Huang W. Chua S.S. Wei P. Moore D.D. Science. 2002; 298: 422-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In addition to its primary role as a xenosensor for foreign compounds, CAR also plays a critical role in the protection of the liver by detoxification of toxic hepatic endogenous compounds. CAR was shown to be critical for the elimination of bilirubin from the body by activating five known components of the bilirubin clearance pathway (4Huang W. Zhang J. Chua S.S. Qatanani M. Han Y. Granata R. Moore D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4156-4161Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In addition, CAR and other nuclear receptors, such as PXR, FXR, and vitamin D receptor, are activated by elevated levels of toxic secondary bile acids such as lithocholic acids (5Guo G.L. Lambert G.

These nuclear receptors protect the liver not only by inducing expression of P450s that metabolize the toxic bile acids but also by suppressing the expression of CYP7A1 and CYP8B1, two key hepatic enzymes involved in bile acid biosynthesis (8Chiang J.Y.L. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 443-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). These effects have been exploited by treating cholestasis patients with phenobarbital (PB) or rifampicin to induce CAR or PXR, respectively, which results in increased metabolism and decreased synthesis of toxic bile acid levels in the liver (9Cancado E.L. Leitao R.M. Carrilho F.J. Laudanna A.A. Am. J. Gastroenterol. 1998; 93: 1510-1517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Recent gene arrays studies showed that phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) or enoyl-CoA isomerase (ECI) genes, which are involved in gluconeogenesis and fatty acid β-oxidation, respectively, were down-regulated by PB treatment in wild type mice but not in CAR null mice (10Ueda A.

Further CAR activation disrupted thyroid hormone homeostasis during fasting, suggesting an unexpected role in energy homeostasis (12Maglich J.M. Watson J. McMillen P.J. Goodwin B. Willson T.M. Moore J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19832-19838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Therefore, these recent studies extend the diverse function of CAR to the negative regulation of genes involved in hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism.Unlike classical nuclear receptors that are activated by their cognate ligands, CAR is transcriptionally active in the absence of ligand (13Baes M. Gulick T. Choi H.-S. Grazia M. Martinoli G. Simha D. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1544-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar).

Tzameli I. Choi H. Chen J. Simha D. Seol W. Evans R.M. Moore D.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). CAR is present in the cytoplasm in the liver in vivo, and agonists elicit nuclear translocation of CAR, which is essential for the activation of CAR target genes (19Kawamoto T. Sueyoshi T. Zelko I. Moore R. Washburn K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6318-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, CAR interacts with its heterodimer partner, RXR, binds to the direct repeat 3 (DR3), DR4, everted repeat 6 (ER6), ER7, or ER8 motifs in the regulatory region of target genes, and activates their transcription (6Eloranta J.J.

Ligand-independent nuclear localization mediated by interaction with the coactivator GRIP-1 has also been observed (15Min G. Kemper J.K. Kemper B. J. Biol.

In contrast to hepatocytes in vivo, in cultured hepatic HepG2 cells, CAR is primarily located in the nucleus in the absence of agonists.Whereas the mechanisms of induction of gene expression by CAR are well known, the mechanisms by which the expression of genes is down-regulated by CAR have not been studied extensively. It has been shown that CAR and PXR coordinately regulate genes that encode enzymes involved in drug metabolism and hepatic gluconeogenesis by inhibitory cross-talk with an insulin responsive forkhead transcription factor, Foxo-1 (21Kodama S. Koike C. Negishi M. Yamamoto Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7931-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that ligand-activated PXR inhibits HNF-4 transactivation of CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 by competing for binding to a common critical coactivator, PGC-1α (22Bhalla S. Ozalp C. Fang S. Xiang L. Kemper J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45139-45147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). PGC-1α is a key transcriptional coactivator in glucose and energy homeostasis that is induced during nutritional fasting and CAR has been also shown to interact with PGC-1α (16Shiraki T. Sakai N. Kanaya E. Jingami H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11344-11350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which CAR suppresses transcription of these genes are not known. Most of these genes that are down-regulated by CAR contain a functional HNF-4 site in their promoters and HNF-4 transactivation is critical for their promoter activities (23Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar, 24Stafford J.M.

Zhong W. Lai E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2353-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). HNF-4 binds to DR1 motifs as a homodimer and regulates expression of numerous key genes involved in cholesterol, fatty acid, and glucose metabolism (6Eloranta J.J. Kullak-Ublick G.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 27Jiang G. Nepomuceno L. Hopkins K. Sladek F.M. Mol. Cell.

A. 1995; 92: 412-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). A recent chromatin immunoprecipitation and microarray study showed that HNF-4 is functionally associated with hundreds of native promoters in liver and pancreatic β-cells, implying the importance of HNF-4 as a master transcription regulator in the liver and pancreas, particularly for lipid and glucose metabolic pathways (29Odom D.T. Zizlsperger N. Gordon D.B. Bell G.W. Rinaldi N.J. Murray H.L. Volkert T.L. Schreiber J. Rolfe P.A. Gifford D.K. Fraenkel E. Bell G.I. Young R.A. Science. 2004; 303: 1378-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). HNF-4 is also a key transcriptional regulator of CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 (8Chiang J.Y.L. Endocr.

Previous studies, including analysis of conditional HNF-4 null mice, demonstrated that HNF-4 is an essential in vivo positive regulator of genes involved in lipid homeostasis and hepatic glucose production, in contrast to CAR, which negatively regulates these genes (10Ueda A.

The importance of the HNF-4/PGC-1α pathway, in coordination with Foxo-1, in the induction of the hepatic gluconeogenic genes PEPCK and Glc-6-P during fasting is well established (33Rhee J. Inoue Y.

HNF-4 also has been shown to be critically involved in the regulation of liver CPT gene expression in combination with PGC-1α and the cAMP response element-binding protein during fasting (25Louet J.F. Hayhurst G. Gonzalez F.J. Girard J. Decaux J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37991-38000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). HNF-4 is, therefore, a key hepatic activator for genes involved in a variety of metabolic pathways in the liver.We, therefore, have examined the hypothesis that CAR inhibits expression of key genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolic pathways by antagonizing HNF-4 transcriptional activity. Here, we report that HNF-4 activation of key genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism was substantially inhibited by CAR via two mechanisms. First, CAR inhibits HNF-4 transactivation by competing with HNF-4 for binding to the DR1 motif, a consensus HNF-4 binding site, in the CYP7A1, CYP8B1, and PEPCK promoters. Second, ligand-activated CAR competes with HNF-4 for binding to common coactivators, including GRIP-1 and PGC-1α, and thus, causes dissociation of these coactivators from HNF-4 target promoters in mouse liver.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimal Experiments—BALB/c male mice (10–12 weeks old) were maintained on a 12-h light and 12-h dark cycle. Mice were randomly divided into groups that were fed normal chow ad libitum or fasted for 12 h. Animals were then injected intraperitoneally with PB (100 mg/kg body weight), TCPOBOP (0.3 mg/kg body weight), or isotonic saline as a control.Plasmids and Plasmid Construction—The reporter plasmids, –1887 human CYP7A1-luc, –371 human CYP7A1-luc, and –416 rat Cyp7a1-luc, were supplied by Dr. J.

Mutation of Cys-21 and Cys-24 in the CAR DNA binding domain to Ala was made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the primers 5′-TATGGGCCGAGGAACGCTGTGGTGGCTGGAGAC-3′ and 5′-CTGTGGCCCGGTCTCCAGCCACCACAGCGTTCC-3′. The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing.Cell Culture—Human hepatic HepG2 cells (ATCC HB8065) were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 phenol-red free media supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin G-streptomycin sulfate and 10% heat-inactivated charcoal dextrantreated fetal bovine serum.Transient Transfection and Reporter Assay—HepG2 cells were cotransfected with DNA of human or rat CYP7A-luc, DNA of pCMV-HNF-4, or pcDNA3CAR as indicated in the figure legends. For Gal4 reporter assays, COS-1 cells were transfected with DNA of the Gal4-TATA-luc reporter and DNA of Gal4DBD or Gal4DBD HNF-4 and PGC-1 in the presence of absence of CAR. Empty vector DNA was added as needed so that the same amounts of CMV expression vector DNA were present in each transfection. Ten ng of pRL-SV40 DNA, expressing Renilla luciferase, was cotransfected as an internal control. Transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 in 24-well plates. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were incubated with fresh media containing 0.25 μm TCPOBOP or Me2SO for 12 h. Luciferase activities were determined by the dual luciferase assay (Promega Inc.) and the firefly luciferase activities were divided by Renilla activities to normalize for transfection efficiency.Gel Mobility Shift Assay—6His-CAR, FLAG-RXR, or 6His-HNF-4 were partially purified as described (22Bhalla S.

Briefly, reactions contained 5,000 to 10,000 cpm of 32P-labeled oligonucleotides with sequences for either the DR1 motif containing the CYP7A1 promoter region or the DR4 motif containing the enhancer region of PB responsive CYP2B1, various amounts (10–20 ng) of HNF-4, CAR, and RXR, and 0.5 μg of poly-(dI·dC) in a final volume of 20 μl of reaction buffer (30 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 4 mm dithiothreitol). After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, the protein-DNA complexes were detected by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For antibody supershift assays, 0.5 μg of RXR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-553) was added to the reactions. For competition assays, a 25–100-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the wild type or mutated DR1 motif in the CYP7A1 promoter were added for 5 min before the addition of the probe.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays in Mouse Liver—Mice were treated with either 100 mg/kg PB or saline for 90 min before the animals were sacrificed. Livers were finely minced and incubated in phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min with rotation to cross-link the DNA and proteins, and the reaction was stopped by adding glycine to 125 mm for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm KOH-Hepes (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 1 mm EDTA, 5% sucrose) and lysed by homogenization with a Dounce homogenizer. The cell lysate was gauzefiltered and layered on a sucrose cushion buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 1 mm EDTA, 10% sucrose). Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 1 min and resuspended in sonication buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 0.85% SDS). The samples were sonicated to reduce DNA length to between 200 and 1,000 bp. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min, 2 volumes of dilution buffer (2 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate) were added. The chromatin sample was pre-cleared by incubation of 800 μl of chromatin solution with 80 μl of 25% slurry of protein A- or G-agarose that had been previously equilibrated with 30 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA and 100 μg of bovine serum albumin per ml of 25% slurry. The pre-cleared chromatin solution was incubated with 2–5 μg of antisera (HNF-4, sc-8987), SRC-1 (sc-6098), GRIP-1 (sc-8996), p300 (sc-585), PGC-1α (sc-13067), or CAR (39Kim J. Min G. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7559-7567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), or normal rabbit or goat serum at 4 °C overnight. The immune complex was collected by centrifugation after incubation with 45 μl of 25% slurry of protein A- or G-agarose. The beads were washed, the bound chromatin was eluted, and the genomic DNA was purified as described above for the HepG2 cells. The DNA was used as a template for semiquantitative PCR. Sequences of the primers used for ChIP assays are available upon request.Determination of mRNA Levels by Real Time-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from mouse liver using TRIzol reagent and cDNA was synthesized using a reverse transcription kit (Promega, Inc). For semi-quantitative RT-PCR, primers were as described previously (22Bhalla S. Ozalp C. Fang S. Xiang L. Kemper J.K. J. Biol.

Real-time RT-PCR was performed with an iCycler iQ (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's instructions and the amount of PCR product for mRNA of each gene was normalized by dividing by the amount of actin product. Sequences of the primers are available upon request.RESULTSCAR Inhibits HNF Transactivation of CYP7A1 Genes—To investigate whether CAR inhibits HNF-4 transactivation of CYP7A1, we performed transfection reporter assays in HepG2 cells. Cells were cotransfected with reporter plasmid DNA for –416 rat Cyp7a1-luc or –371 human CYP7A1-luc and increasing amounts of expression plasmids for HNF-4 and CAR. Expression of HNF-4 increased rat and human CYP7A1 promoter activity (Fig. 1, A, lanes 1, 4, and 7 and B, lanes 1, 2, and 5). Expression of increasing amounts of CAR had little effect on basal activity (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–3), but progressively inhibited the HNF-4-mediated transactivation of both promoters with the activities at the highest concentrations of CAR reduced to those without exogenous HNF-4 added (Fig. 1, A and B). Similar results were observed with the –1887 human CYP7A1 reporter (Fig. 1C). To determine whether CAR inhibition of HNF-4-mediated transactivation of CYP7A1 was specific for HNF-4, we examined the effects of CAR on the activities of the CYP7A1 promoter by a forkhead transcription factor, Foxa-2 (HNF-3β). Foxa-2 has been shown to directly bind to the CYP7A1 promoter and activate the transcription (42Kim J.Y. Kim H.J. Kim K.T. Park Y.Y. Seong H.A. Park K.C. Lee I.K. Ha H. Shong M. Park S.C. Choi H.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2880-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Expression of Foxa-2 in HepG2 cells resulted in about a 10-fold increase in human CYP7A1 promoter activity (Fig. 1D). In contrast to the inhibition of HNF-4 transactivation of the CYP7A1 gene, increasing amounts of CAR did not inhibit Foxa-2 transactivation of CYP7A1 (Fig. 1, C and D). These results indicate that the inhibition by CAR is not a general suppression of the promoter activity, but is specific for HNF-4 activity.In addition, mutation of the DR-1 HNF-4 site, which eliminated binding of HNF-4 to the human promoter (data not shown), abolished the CYP7A1 promoter activity (Fig. 1E). These functional reporter assays demonstrate that HNF-4 is required for the activation of the CYP7A1 promoter in HepG2 cells and CAR inhibits HNF-4 transactivation of CYP7A1 genes.CAR Competes with HNF-4 for Binding to the DR1 Motif in the CYP7A1 Promoter in Vitro—To delineate the mechanism by which CAR antagonizes HNF-4 transactivation, we first examined if CAR inhibits HNF-4 binding to the DNA by gel mobility shift assays. CAR is a promiscuous binding protein, which binds to both direct and everted nuclear receptor binding sites with different spacing between the half-sites (6Eloranta J.J. Kullak-Ublick G.A. Arch.

Two oligonucleotide probes were used that contained either the DR1 motif, an HNF-4 binding site, from the CYP7A1 promoter (Fig. 2A), or the DR4 CAR/RXR binding site from the CYP2B1 enhancer region (39Kim J.

Ccw5/Pir4p contains only one complete repeating sequence and its deletion caused a release of the protein into the medium. The exchange of each of three glutamines (Gln69, Gln74, Gln76) as well as one aspartic acid (Asp72) within the repeating unit leads to a loss of the protein from the cell wall. Amino acid sequencing revealed that only Gln74 is modified. Release of the protein with mild alkali, changed Gln74 to to glutamic acid, suggesting that Gln74 is involved in the linkage. Analysis by mass spectrometry showed that 5 hexoses are attached to Gln/Glu74. Sugar analysis revealed glucose as the only constituent. It is suggested that Pir proteins form novel, alkali labile ester linkages between the γ-carboxyl group of glutamic acids, arising from specific glutamines, with hydroxyl groups of glucoses of β-1,3-glucan chains.

Fungal cell walls are rigid albeit dynamic, complex structures, withstanding intracellular osmotic pressures of more than 10 bar (1Eamus D.G. Jennings D.H. Ayres P. Body L. Water, Fungi and Plants. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1986: 27-47Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the cell wall amounts to about 20% of the total dry weight of the cell. Besides a small amount of chitin, it mainly consists of β-glucans and mannoproteins. The actual protein content comes to about 10% of the wall by weight (2Orlean P. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 229-362Google Scholar).

Some of them are solubilized from the cell wall by SDS under reducing conditions and are therefore called soluble cell wall proteins (10Valentin E. Herrero W. Pastor J.F.I. Sentandreu R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1984; 130: 1419-1428Google Scholar), however, most of them are covalently attached to the glucan layer and can be released from SDS-extracted cell walls by β-glucanases (11Kopecka M.

This group of covalently attached cell wall proteins, called GPI-Cwp, are released from the wall both by β-1,6- and by β-1,3-glucanases, due to the attachment of GPI-Cwps to β-1,3-glucan via a short β-1,6-glucan bridge (4De Groot P.W.

The second group of covalently linked cell wall proteins are the so-called Pir proteins, named originally according to three genes coding for putative proteins with internal repeats (Pir) (17Toh-e A. Yasunaga S. Nisogi H. Tanaka K. Oguchi T. Matsui Y. Yeast. 1993; 9: 481-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and subsequently identified as covalently linked cell wall proteins Ccw1, -2, -3, and -4p (8Mrsa V. Seidl T. Gentzsch M. Tanner W.

For S. cerevisiae five PIR genes are known (Table 1) coding for proteins with varying numbers of repetitive units (1 to 10). Pir proteins do not contain a C-terminal GPI-addition signal, they are all processed by Kex2 protease, and they are released from intact cells by very mild alkaline treatment (30 mm NaOH, 12 h, 4 °C) (8Mrsa V. Seidl T. Gentzsch M. Tanner W. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1145-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Pir proteins are attached directly to β-1,3-glucan (20Kapteyn J.C. Van Den Ende H. Klis F.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) and can therefore be released from S. cerevisiae by the corresponding β-1,3-glucanase, not however by β-1,6-glucanase (4De Groot P.W. Ram A.F. Klis F.M. Fungal Genet. Biol. 2005; 42: 657-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The actual alkali labile linkage between the protein moiety and β-1,3-glucan is not known.TABLE 1The Pir proteins of S. cerevisiae (proteins with internal repeats)Gene locusGene nameNumber of repeatsYKL164cPIR1/CCW68YJL159wPIR2/CCW7/HSP14010YKL163wPIR3/CCW88YJL158cPIR4/CCW5/CIS31(-2)YJL160cPIR54 Open table in a new tab Pir proteins known to be involved in various biological phenomena are not essential for viability; a quadruple mutant, however, possesses a severe growth phenotype (21Mrsa V.

Narasimhan M.L. Damsz B. Lee H. Abad L.R. D'Urzo M.P. Hasegawa P.M. Bressan R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7082-7087Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Special functional importance of Pir proteins has also to be deduced from the fact that PIR1–3 are the most highly regulated genes in the cell cycle; the expression score of PIR1 amounts to 16 with the activity peaking in M/G1, i.e. during cell separation (24Spellman P.T. Sherlock G. Zhang M.Q. Iyer V.R. Anders K. Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Futcher B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3273-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (3900) Google Scholar). In this report we characterize the linkage between Ccw5/Pir4p and β-1,3-glucan. Evidence will be presented that the amido group of a specific glutamine residue within the repetitive sequence is deamidated and a carboxyl ester with β-1,3-linked glucose is formed. Yeast Strains and Genetic Methods—The following isogenic yeast strains were used: SEY6210 (MATα ura 3–52 leu2–3,112 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 lys2–801 suc2-Δ9), VMA5 (MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 lys2–801 suc2-Δ9 ccw5Δ). Cells were grown at 30 °C in standard yeast media either YEPD (1% Bacto yeast extract, 2% Bacto peptone, 2% dextrose) or YNBD (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 0.08% complete amino acid supplement mixture (from Bio 101, Inc.), 2% dextrose). Transformation into yeast and Eschericia coli was carried out using standard techniques. Plasmid Constructions—Standard molecular biology techniques were used for all plasmid constructions. The correct sequence of PCR-amplified products was verified by DNA sequencing. The sequences of primers used in this study are available on request. CCW5 was amplified from yeast genomic DNA. The amplified gene was inserted into the SmaI site of vector YEp351. To introduce a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope at the C terminus of CCW5 a NotI site was first created, and the fragment was inserted into the SalI restriction site at the very end of CCW5. Then, six HA epitopes were inserted into the NotI site in frame with CCW5 and verified by Western blot analysis. CCW5—plasmids containing N-terminal deletions, pCCW5-(Δ65–82)-HA and pCCW5-(Δ83–95)-HA, respectively (see Fig. 2) were generated by two-step PCR technology. Site-directed mutagenesis to exchange specific amino acids in pCCW5-HA was performed by the two step PCR method to give pCCW5-(Q69A)-HA, pCCW5-(D72N)-HA, pCCW5-(Q74A)-HA, and pCCW5-(Q76A)-HA, respectively. The correct sequences have been confirmed by sequencing. Plasmid pCCW5-ZZ contains two C-terminal protein A epitopes in frame with CCW5 inserted into the vector pRS425. In plasmid pCCW5-(S79M)-ZZ amino acid Ser79 has been replaced by Met as described above for the exchanges in the plasmid pCCW5HA. Isolation and Purification of Pir4/Ccw5-ZZ—SEY6210, harboring pCCW5-ZZ, was grown in YNBD without leucine to an A600 of 3. Cells (A600 2000) were harvested and washed in 50 ml 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8), resuspended in 5 ml of ice-cold 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, containing the protease inhibitors Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (0.1 mg/ml), l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (0.05 μg/ml), benzamidine (1 mm), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), leupeptin, pepstatin, and antipain, each 1 μg/ml. The cells were homogenized twice for 25 s with intermittent cooling in a FastPrep Instrument (Qbiogene) in portions of 0.5 ml by glass beads. Cell walls were isolated by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min. The cell wall pellets were washed twice with 20 ml of potassium phosphate buffer. Cell walls were boiled twice for 10 min at 100 °C in 20 ml of SDS Laemmli sample buffer, centrifuged at 3000 × g, washed with 20 ml of water and with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and lyophilized. Extracted cell walls were resuspended in 2.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), supplemented with protease inhibitors (see above), and incubated with 600 units of Quantazyme for 3 h at 37°C. Then an additional 300 units were added and incubated for another 2 h. The homogenate was centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 20 min. The clear supernatant was removed and adjusted to 75 mm NaCl, supplemented with protease inhibitors (see above) and added to 0.5 ml of IgG-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) prepared according to the manufacturer and equilibrated in TBST (0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), containing 0.15 m NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20). The slurry was incubated by gentle rotation for 4 h at 4 °C and then loaded into a column and washed three times with 5 column volumes TBST and two times with 5 mm NH4-acetate (pH 5). Ccw5p was eluted with 0.5 m NH4-acetate (pH 3.4) and lyophilized from NH4-acetate. For isolation of Ccw5p from the medium, this was lyophilized and extensively dialyzed against water, containing protease inhibitors, and subsequently subjected to IgG-Sepharose affinity chromatography, as described above. Analysis of Ccw5p-bound Carbohydrates—Ccw5-ZZp isolated from cell wall and medium, respectively, and purified by affinity chromatography was treated overnight with 0.2 ml of 30 mm NaOH at 4 °C. The material was lyophilized, dissolved in water, centrifuged through a Millipore Ultrafree-MC cartridge, and separated by high performance anion exchange chromatography with amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) on a Dionex DX 500/ED40 system using a CarboPac PA1 column and a linear gradient from 16 mm NaOH to 500 mm sodium acetate in 150 mm NaOH within 45 min. For preparative purpose several runs were performed, and the respective fractions 1, 2, and 3 (see Fig. 8) were combined. The material was then desalted on Dowex 50W × 8(H+), lyophilized, and used for further analysis. As reference standards for β-1,3-linked gluco-oligosaccharides served laminaribiose, triose, tetraose, and pentaose (Sigma) and for β-1,6-linked oligo-glucoses gentiobiose and pustulan (Calbiochem) partially hydrolyzed by 1 m trifluoroacetic acid for 1 h. To determine the sugar composition of the fractions 1, 2, and 3, glycans were hydrolyzed with 4 m trifluoroacetic acid and 4 n HCl, respectively, for 4 h at 100°C, dried under nitrogen, dissolved in water, and analyzed by HPAEC on a CarboPac PA1-column with 16 mm NaOH as eluent. Isolation and Structural Analysis of CNBr Peptides—CNBr digestion was performed overnight at 4 °C in 70% formic acid containing 5 mg CNBr/ml. The bulk of the solvent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen, the oily residue was diluted with water and lyophilized. The peptides were separated by reverse phase HPLC using a Vydac 214 RP18 column (250 × 2 mm) and identified by Edman degradation of collected peaks. Sequencing was done using a Procise 492A sequencer (Applied Biosystems) with on-line detection of the PTH-amino acids according to the manufacturer's instructions. Linear mode positive-ion MALDI spectra were recorded with a Ultraflex TOF/TOF (Bruker Daltonics) using 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as a matrix. Identification of the Amino Acid of the Pir4/Ccw5 Protein That Is Linked to β-1,3-Glucan—To study a possible role of the repetitive sequences of Pir proteins, we concentrated on the Pir4p/Ccw5p/Cis3p. This protein has only one repetitive sequence of the type present in all Pir proteins, whereas in a second, related sequence, next to the first one (Fig. 1), 5 of the 12 conserved amino acids are exchanged. As reported previously (25Castillo L. Martinez A.I. Garcera A. Elorza M.V. Valentin E. Sentandreu R. Yeast. 2003; 20: 973-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 26Mrsa V. Kokanj D. Ecker M. Tanner W. Aebi M. Molecular Mechanisms of Fungal Cell Wall Biogenesis. Microbiology ETH, Zürich, Switzerland2001Google Scholar), a deletion of the repetitive sequence (amino acids 65–82) resulted in the release of Pir4p to the medium. In Fig. 2 evidence is presented that HA-tagged Pir4p requires the conserved repetitive sequence, to get attached to the cell wall in a way withstanding extraction with hot SDS under reducing conditions. The following pseudorepetitive sequence (amino acids 83–95) is neither sufficient nor necessary for covalent cell wall attachment. As seen in lane 2, the size of the Δ65–82 peptide is not reduced, which is due to the fact that the Kex2p cleavage site right next to the deletion is not used in this construct, as confirmed by N-terminal sequencing. Pir4p is found to a considerable proportion also in the medium, which in part is due to the overexpression of the tagged protein. In addition, a certain amount of Pir4p remains non-covalently associated with the cell wall and is partly released as such also into the medium (8Mrsa V. Seidl T. Gentzsch M. Tanner W. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1145-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). This is not observed with any of the other Pir proteins, which all have several repeating units. The alkaline lability of the linkage of Pir proteins suggested that they may be attached to sugars via a hydroxy amino acid. However, when the serine and threonine residues in the repetitive sequence, as well as the neighboring ones (Fig. 3) were replaced by alanine, the attachment of Pir4p to the cell wall was not affected (data not shown). On the other hand, each individual exchange of the three glutamine residues within the repetitive sequence as well as aspartate 72 with alanine and asparagine, respectively, gave rise to a complete loss of cell wall-bound Pir4p (Fig. 3). The D65N exchange of an aspartate residue outside of the repetitive sequence had no effect. This result indicated that, although all 4 amino acids are necessary for the protein to get cell wall-bound, at most one could form the actual link. Helpful information concerning the amino acid involved in the respective linkage was obtained by N-terminally sequencing Pir4p, which was released from cell walls by either β-1,3-glucanase or mild alkali treatment. As shown in Fig. 4, sequencing the protein released by glucanase, revealed that the expected PTH-amino acid for Gln in position 74 was missing, indicating the presence of a modified amino acid not detected by the standard analytical procedure. Surprisingly, however, in the protein released by alkali, there was a glutamic acid at position 74. This suggests that Gln74 is indeed the linking amino acid and that it is deamidated during the attachment to β-1,3-glucan. In accordance with this interpretation is the fact that Pir4p secreted to the medium does contain a glutamine at that position (Fig. 4). A well known enzymatic reaction using protein-bound glutamine as substrate is the transglutaminase reaction (27Esposito C. Caputo I. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 615-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The responsible enzyme activates the γ-carboxamide group of the glutamine, which then reacts with primary amines, typically an ϵ-amino group of protein-bound lysines, thus cross-linking and polymerizing proteins in this way (28Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Assuming a similar type of reaction for binding Pir4p to the cell wall, one would have to postulate that β-1,3-glucan contains primary amines, for example glucosamine residues (X in Fig. 5A). In addition, one would have to assume that the newly formed link is alkali labile. An alternative way of linking a protein-bound glutamine to β-1,3-glucan via the release of the amido group is suggested in Fig. 5B. The bond formed in this case would be an ester between the γ-carboxyl group set free from glutamine and an OH group of a glucosyl residue within the β-1,3-glucan chains. Energetically this bond would be formed on the account of the deamidation and such an ester would definitely be alkali-labile. Identification of the Oligosaccharide Bound to Gln/Glu74 of the Pir4/Ccw5 Protein—To analyze the modification of the amino acid at position 74 of Pir4p, we used a C-terminal protein A-tagged variant, in which Ser79 was replaced with a methionine residue by site directed mutagenesis (Fig. 6). This allowed the generation of peptide B with a C-terminal homoserine by treatment of the mutated Pir4 protein by cyanogen bromide (Fig. 6). Subsequent Edman degradation of the purified peptide and HPLC separation of the released PTH-amino acids gave no signals for Ser68, Thr78, and Gln/Glu74 indicating that these amino acids are modified and escape detection under the separation conditions for standard amino acids. With our earlier finding that all hydroxyl amino acids of Pir4p are O-mannosylated (29Ecker M. Mrsa V. Hagen I. Deutzmann R. Strahl S. Tanner W. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 628-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we can conclude that Ser68 and Thr78 are mannosylated, but the modification of Gln74 remained obscure. To further investigate the identity of this modification, an aliquot of peptide B was treated with mild alkali, resulting in formation of peptide A (Fig. 6). Residues Ser78 and Thr78 were still modified, but in position 74 a glutamic acid showed up, in agreement with the results obtained for the intact protein, as described above. Obviously, this treatment was sufficient to remove the modification of Gln74 but not sufficient to remove the mannose residues from Ser68 and Thr78. Using mass spectrometry we obtained information about the size of the modifying groups. Linear mode positive ion MALDI mass spectrometry measurement of peptide B showed a prominent signal with a m/z (mass/charge) value of 3458.8 and weaker one with m/z = 2665.3 (Fig. 7A), with a mass accuracy being better than 1 dalton. As outlined in Fig. 7B, these m/z values correspond exactly to the molecular mass of singly charged, protonated peptides with homoserine lactone at the C-terminal end carrying 7 and 12 hexoses, respectively. In addition the signals at 2665.3 and 3458.8 show satellite peaks with masses higher by 18 mass units, which most probably correspond to the same molecules having a C-terminal homoserine instead of homoserine lactone, formed by opening of the lactone ring. After mild alkali treatment the peak at 3458.8 and its satellite completely disappeared and only the smaller mass remained (data not shown). Thus, together with the data obtained by Edman degradation, this is good evidence that Ser68 and Thr78 are substituted by a total of 7 mannose residues, and additional 5 hexoses are attached to the amino acid in position 74. Since the accuracy of the mass spectrometry analysis was better than 1 dalton, our data are consistent with attachment of the 5 hexoses to Glu and not Gln. Unfortunately, further structural analysis by MALDI-TOF/TOF was not possible, because due to decomposition during the time of flight the peptides could only be measured in linear mode and not in the reflector mode (data not shown). To further analyze the oligosaccharide attached to Gln/Glu74, we purified Pir4-ZZp after releasing it from the SDS-extracted cell walls by β-1,3-glucanase. As a control the protein was also purified from the medium. Both samples were treated with mild alkali, and the material released was separated by HPAEC. As can be seen from the elution profile shown in Fig. 8, the cell wall-bound material gave rise to three peaks, which were absent from protein purified from the medium. The three peaks coincided with laminaritriose, -tetraose, and -pentaose and clearly differed from the β-1,6-oligomer standards (Fig. 8). When the three peaks were hydrolyzed, only glucose and a minute amount of mannose; however, no glucosamine has been detected; the latter should amount to at least 20% in the case of the pentasaccharide and to 33% in the case of the trisaccharide. It has to be concluded, therefore, that Pir4/Ccw5p is directly linked to β-1,3-glucan. A laminaripentaose attached to the protein obviously cannot be further split by β-1,3-glucanase. The treatment with 30 mm NaOH presumably caused some peeling off of glucoses, resulting in the smaller oligosaccharides. For mass spectrometry analyses the material was treated with 5% NH4OH, conditions that obviously did not cause pentasaccharide degradation. Lability of the Pir4p-Glucan Bond as Compared with a γ-Isoglutamyl-Peptide Bond—To release the covalently bound Pir4/Ccw5 protein from yeast cell walls, we normally used an overnight treatment with 30 mm NaOH at 4 °C. However, as shown in Fig. 9 the linkage is considerably more labile. Even at 10 mm NaOH more than half of the protein is released from the cell wall in 14 h at 4 °C, and at 30 mm NaOH 7 h are sufficient for complete release. A peptide linkage with the involvement of the γ-carboxyl group of glutamic acid, the type of linkage that would form in a classical transglutamination reaction, is known to be more easily hydrolyzed than a regular peptide linkage. To compare the lability of the Pir4-cell wall link with that of an isoglutamyl bond, we tested the alkali lability of isoglutaminyl-Ala-OH. At 30 mm NaOH even after 20 h less than 2% of the isopeptide were hydrolyzed (data not shown). This considerable difference in lability is taken as further evidence for the ester linkage proposed. Unfortunately neither an isoglutamyl-glucosamine nor an isoglutamyl-glucose ester was available to test the lability of the corresponding bonds in greater detail. The analysis reported herein shows that the Ccw5/Pir4 protein is attached to the cell wall via glutamine residue 74 within the repetitive sequence QIGDGQ74VQ. This motif is conserved in all Pir proteins. The data also demonstrate that the linkage at Gln74 is extremely alkali labile and that after the hydrolytic splitting, the glutamine has been transformed to a glutamic acid. This behavior points to the existence of a transglutaminase-type reaction. Since neither an amino sugar nor a primary amine containing molecule was detected as part of the β-1,3-glucan attached to the Pir4 protein, and since no potential gene encoding a transglutaminase can be identified in the S. cerevisiae genome, it is postulated that an ester linkage between the γ-carboxyl of a glutamate residue, arising from glutamine, and the sugar hydroxyl is formed. Such an ester would be expected to be extremely alkali labile. Whereas the overall composition of S. cerevisiae cell wall is well known since quite some time, less is known about the problem how the various components are chemically linked and interconnected. Likewise, hardly any of the enzymes responsible for the corresponding reactions have been identified. About 50% of the chitin is β-1,4-linked to β-1,3-glucan chains, for which a periplasmic transglycosylation reaction has been postulated (30Kollar R. Petrakova E. Ashwell G. Robbins P.W. Cabib E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1170-1178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). An extensive molecular analysis of a yeast cell wall complex has been carried out in Cabib's laboratory (13Kollar R. Reinhold B.B. Petrakova E. Yeh H.J. Ashwell G. Drgonova J. Kapteyn J.C. Klis F.M. Cabib E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17762-17775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). From this and from previous work of the Klis' laboratory and others (16Fujii T. Shimoi H. Iimura Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1427: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), it was concluded that the GPI proteins are linked to β-1,6-glucan via one or several mannose residues of the GPI anchor; the linkage type remained unknown. Furthermore, evidence was presented that chitin with its reducing end may also be covalently bound to β-1,6-glucan. As a consequence cell wall proteins of the GPI type may be immobilized in the cell wall either due to their connection to β-1,3-glucan or to chitin and in either case a short β-1,6-glucan chain will constitute a bridging entity. The various transglycosidases required for these covalent bond formations have still to be uncovered. The different linkages between cell wall components, described so far, give rise to a very complex and highly branched macromolecule. This polymer does not, however, represent a covalently cross-linked network, as for instance the peptidoglycan sacculus of bacteria. The bacterial covalently cross-linked macromolecule explains the resistance to high internal pressure. Truly cross-linked macromolecules could arise in the yeast cell wall, for example, if cell wall proteins formed intermolecular disulfide linkages. That these in principle exist in fungal cell walls is well established, but there is no evidence for any extended protein network. The Pir proteins with up two 10 repetitive sequence domains (see Table 1) could be responsible for a different cross-linking principle. Since the repetitive unit forms a link to β-1,3-glucan as shown in the present paper, and since we can assume that this is the case for each repetitive unit, the Pir proteins could cross-link up to 10 β-1,3-glucan chains. The yeast strain deleted in four PIR genes does show a considerable increase in size as well as a changed morphology (21Mrsa V. Tanner W. Yeast. 1999; 15: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). They also show a pronounced susceptibility to cell wall synthesis inhibitors. On the other hand, assuming that Pir proteins play an important role in cell wall stability, their deletion would be expected to result in a lethal phenotype. According to the gene expression analysis (24Spellman P.T. Sherlock G. Zhang M.Q. Iyer V.R. Anders K. Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Futcher B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3273-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (3900) Google Scholar), the synthesis of several Pir proteins increases massively during cytokinesis. This might indicate that the Pir proteins are especially required to stabilize both the newly synthesized walls separating mother and daughter cell; evidence that Pir1p and Pir2p are localized at the bud scars has indeed been presented (31Sumita T. Yoko-o T. Shimma Y. Jigami Y. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 1872-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A major open question is how the formation of the Pir-protein/β-1,3-glucan link is brought about. Which enzyme catalyzes the postulated peptide-ester transformation? From an energetic point of view, such an extra-cytoplasmic reaction would not create a problem, since the free energy of amide hydrolysis would be sufficient for the formation of the ester linkage. The reaction type being new does not allow, however, a guess concerning the potential gene and gene product involved. A daring speculation would be that the repetitive sequences of the Pir proteins themselves catalyze the formation of their attachment to the β-1,3-glucan. This certainly could explain the essential role of 2 glutamine residues and an aspartate one in the immediate neighborhood of the Gln74, to which the glucan gets attached. The possibility of such a mechanism is under investigation. We acknowledge the expert technical support of Ingrid Fuchs, Angelika Rechenmacher, and Eduard Hochmuth and thank Dr. A. Asperger and Dr. S. Deininger from Bruker Daltonics/Leipzig for MALDI-TOF measurements."

The presence of the aberrant fibril subpopulation disrupts the normal linear and lateral growth mediated by fibril fusion. Therefore, abnormal fibril nucleation and dysfunctional fibril growth with potential disruption of cell-directed fibril organization leads to the connective tissue dysfunction associated with EDS."

The ""footprints"" of freshly secreted plaques deposited onto glass coverslips were shown by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry to consist chiefly of proteins ranging in mass from 5200 to 6700 Da. These proteins, variants of a family known as mcfp3 (<i>M. californianus</i> foot protein 3), were purified from acetic acid/urea extracts of plaques and foot tissue. Mcfp3 appears to sort into fast and slow electrophoretic variants. Both are rich in Gly and Asn and exhibit post-translational hydroxylation of Tyr and Arg to Dopa and 4-hydroxyarginine, respectively, with the fast variant containing more than twice as much Lys + Arg. Both the slow and fast variants were partially sequenced from the N terminus, and the complete sequences of 12 variants were deduced from cDNA using degenerate oligonucleotides, PCR, and rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Mcfp3s are highly polar molecules and contain up to 28 mol % Dopa, which remains intact and may be crucial for adhesion to metal and mineral surfaces."

https://openalex.org/W2156070415,"A major question in G protein-coupled receptor signaling concerns the quaternary structure required for signal transduction. Do these transmembrane receptors function as monomers, dimers, or larger oligomers? We have investigated the oligomeric state of the model G protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin (Rho), which absorbs light and initiates a phototransduction-signaling cascade that forms the basis of vision. In this study, different forms of Rho were isolated using gel filtration techniques in mild detergents, including n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, n-tetradecyl-β-d-maltoside, and n-hexadecyl-β-d-maltoside. The quaternary structure of isolated Rho was determined by transmission electron microscopy, demonstrating that in micelles containing n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, Rho exists as a mixture of monomers and dimers whereas in n-tetradecyl-β-d-maltoside and n-hexadecyl-β-d-maltoside Rho forms higher ordered structures. Especially in n-hexadecyl-β-d-maltoside, most of the particles are present in tightly packed rows of dimers. The oligomerization of Rho seems to be important for interaction with its cognate G protein, transducin. Although the activated Rho (Meta II) monomer or dimers are capable of activating the G protein, transducin, the activation process is much faster when Rho exists as organized dimers. Our studies provide direct comparisons between signaling properties of Meta II in different quaternary complexes.

A large number of experimental data from reconstitution systems in vitro, model cell lines, in vivo approaches, structural studies of the extracellular domain of three receptors, and modeling/sizing analysis reveal that G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 3The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; DDM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; TEM, transmission electron microscopy(e); TDM, n-tetradecyl-β-d-maltoside; HDM, n-hexadecyl-β-d-maltoside; Gt, rod photoreceptor G protein (transducin or Gt); Meta II (or Rho*); photoactivated Rho; Rho, rhodopsin; (R)OS: (rod) outer segment(s); CMC, critical micelle concentration; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. 3The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; DDM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; TEM, transmission electron microscopy(e); TDM, n-tetradecyl-β-d-maltoside; HDM, n-hexadecyl-β-d-maltoside; Gt, rod photoreceptor G protein (transducin or Gt); Meta II (or Rho*); photoactivated Rho; Rho, rhodopsin; (R)OS: (rod) outer segment(s); CMC, critical micelle concentration; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. can exist in various oligomeric forms (1Park P.S.

EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The functioning of GPCRs as a monomeric unit is significantly less extensively documented. The propensity of GPCRs to oligomerize is likely to be important for the posttranslational maturation of GPCRs in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, for cell surface expression, desensitization, and internalization, and for diversification of the signaling power through hetero-oligomerization (1Park P.S. Filipek S. Wells J.W. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15643-15656Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 2Terrillon S. Bouvier M. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Efficient coupling of GPCRs to their cognate heterotrimeric G proteins through dimeric or monomeric forms of the receptors has been suggested in modeling studies (3Filipek S. Krzysko K.A. Fotiadis D. Liang Y. Saperstein D.A. Engel A. Palczewski K. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2004; 3: 628-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 4Fanelli F. De Benedetti P.G. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 3297-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), but so far, only a pentameric complex composed of two GPCRs and G protein has been isolated (5Baneres J.L. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 815-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In our model, one rhodopsin (Rho) molecule needs to be activated whereas the second serves as a platform to support G protein binding and does not require activation (3Filipek S. Krzysko K.A. Fotiadis D. Liang Y. Saperstein D.A. Engel A. Palczewski K. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2004; 3: 628-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, the lack of biochemical methods that can produce different oligomers has prevented direct evaluation of the signaling properties of various forms of the receptors. In addition to atomic force microscopy, we have used blue native and native gel electrophoresis, chemical cross-linkers, and limited proteolysis to show that the GPCR Rho exists as oligomeric structures in isolated disk membranes of rod photoreceptors (3Filipek S.

The IV-V model of dimerization was proposed by taking into account structural constraints in which the interface between the subunits in the dimer is formed by rotationally symmetric and homologous interactions between the IV and V helices of each protomer (7Liang Y. Fotiadis D. Filipek S. Saperstein D.A. Palczewski K. Engel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21655-21662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Recently, this model was supported experimentally for the dopamine D2 receptor (8Guo W. Shi L. Filizola M. Weinstein H. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 17495-17500Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may extend to all GPCRs as well. Moreover, solubilized Rho dimers were directly visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (6Suda K. Filipek S. Palczewski K. Engel A. Fotiadis D. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2004; 21: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The isolated disks used in these experiments were produced by well established methods (13Papermaster D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), suggesting that most of the work carried out on the activation of its G protein, Gt, that has been published over the last 20 years employed oligomeric Rho when used as a membrane suspension. It should be noted that the density of Rho varies along the length of the rod outer segments (ROS) within the rod cells (14Moritz O.L. Tam B.M. Papermaster D.S. Nakayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28242-28251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), a property that did not allow x-ray or neutron diffraction to detect the intrinsic symmetry within ROS. In mild detergents with increasing detergent concentrations, we find that Rho dissociates from high molecular weight species to monomers (6Suda K. Filipek S. Palczewski K. Engel A. Fotiadis D. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2004; 21: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 12Jastrzebska B. Maeda T. Zhu L. Fotiadis D. Filipek S. Engel A. Stenkamp R.E. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54663-54675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). When Rho is reconstituted into asolectin, even at high lipid to Rho ratios, >90% of the receptor is present as oligomers (15Mansoor S.E. Palczewski K. Farrens D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3060-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In our current studies, we have carried out systematic biochemical screens for conditions leading to the isolation of Rho in different higher order structures. We have taken advantage of the preservation of Rho oligomers in alkyl-maltosides and tested a number of detergents and conditions to produce uniform oligomeric forms of Rho as verified by TEM. Once different forms of Rho were produced (the first time this has been achieved for any GPCR), we tested them in G protein activation and other biochemical assays. Chemicals—DDM, TDM, and HDM were obtained from Anatrace Inc. (Maumee, OH). GTPγS was purchased from Sigma. ROS Membrane Solubilization—Bovine ROS membranes were prepared from fresh retinas under dim red light according to the procedure of Papermaster (13Papermaster D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). ROS membranes (1 mg/ml of proteins) were treated with 10 mm Bis-Tris propane, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl and 10 mm DDM, 20 mm TDM, or 20 mm HDM. The membrane suspensions were incubated overnight at room temperature and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min using a Beckman Ultracentrifuge to remove insoluble material. The supernatant was used for the purification of Rho complexes by gel filtration chromatography. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Gel filtration chromatography was performed using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with 10 mm Bis-Tris propane, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, at either 3 mm DDM, 0.5 mm TDM, or 0.05 mm HDM. These concentrations are 17, 50, and 83 times above the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the respective detergent. The differences in detergent concentrations are correlated with differences in their CMC. The chromatography was carried out at room temperature with a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The absorbance of the eluate at 280 and 500 nm was monitored with a Cary 50 Bio UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Varian Inc., Walnut Creek, CA). 30 μl of fractions containing proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The void volume of the column (blue dextran 2,000 kDa; Amersham Biosciences) was in fraction 21, and the column volume as measured with NaN3 eluted in fraction 62. The column was calibrated using IgG (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.5 kDa). The standard proteins were run through the column with or without detergents. The different detergents did not change the migration of the standard soluble proteins. The linear calibration curve obtained by plotting the logarithm of the molecular mass as a function of the fraction number was used to calculate the molecular mass of the Rho complexes (12Jastrzebska B. Maeda T. Zhu L. Fotiadis D. Filipek S. Engel A. Stenkamp R.E. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54663-54675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Transmission Electron Microscopy—Rho purified by gel filtration in 3 mm DDM (fraction 35), 0.5 mm TDM (fraction 31), or 0.05 mm HDM (fraction 22) was adsorbed for 10 s to parlodion carbon-coated copper grids rendered hydrophilic by glow discharge at low pressures in air. Grids were washed with three drops of double-distilled water and stained with two drops of 0.75% uranyl formate. Electron micrographs of Rho particles were recorded with a Hitachi H-7000 TEM operated at 100 kV. Total Phospholipid Quantification—Rho was purified by gel filtration in 3 mm DDM, 0.5 mm TDM, or 0.05 mm HDM. The concentration of Rho was determined by its absorbance at 500 nm, using a molar extinction coefficient of 40,600 m-1 cm-1 (16Stubbs G.W. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). After Rho measurements, samples were dried and lipids were extracted with chloroform-methanol mixtures. Total phospholipids were quantified by phosphorus analysis (17Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipids were also extracted with H2O/methanol/CHCl3, and the bottom layer was removed, dried down, and then redissolved in CHCl3. The CHCl3 solution was fractionated into three different classes of lipids (neutral lipid, glycolipid, and polar lipid) by silicic acid column chromatography and subsequently eluted with CHCl3, acetone, and methanol (18White D.C. Ringelberg D.B. Burlage R.S. Atlas R. Stahl D. Geesey G. Sayler G. Signature Lipid Biomarker Analysis. Oxford University Press, New York1995: 255-272Google Scholar). The methanol fraction was dried down and dissolved again in 10% H2O/80% methanol/10% CHCl3. Electrospray mass spectrometry analysis of phospholipids was performed on a QSTAR PULSAR i with a nebulization-assisted homemade nanospray ionization source. For a mixture of phospholipids, the precursor ion experiment was carried out first to identify the different classes of phospholipids, and then tandem mass spectrometry followed to analyze the structures of the phospholipids. For detection of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine in the positive mode and nitrogen-containing phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine in the negative mode, 0.2% acetic acid or 0.05% piperidine (19Griffiths W.J. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2003; 22: 81-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) was included, respectively. Because of the characteristic polar head group structure of different phospholipids, diagnostic mass ions (m/z) were used for the identification of each individual class of phospholipids in the precursor ion experiment (20Pulfer M.K.

For complete analysis see supplemental data. Gt Activation Assay—Gt was purified as described previously (12Jastrzebska B. Maeda T. Zhu L. Fotiadis D. Filipek S. Engel A. Stenkamp R.E. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54663-54675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Rho was purified by gel filtration in different detergents, including 3 mm DDM, 0.5 mm TDM, or 0.05 mm HDM. The following fractions were used in the fluorescence assay of Gt activation: fraction 35 in DDM, fraction 31 in TDM, and fraction 22 in HDM. The ratio of Gt to Rho was ∼9:1, with Gt at a concentration of 250 nm and Rho at 30 nm, within the linear range of fluorescence change and protein concentration. The sample was bleached for 15 s using a Fiber-Lite covered with a long pass wavelength filter (>490 nm), followed by 10 min of incubation with continuous low speed stirring. The intrinsic fluorescence increase from Gtα was measured with a PerkinElmer LS 50B Luminescence Spectrophotometer, employing excitation and emission wavelengths at 300 and 345 nm, respectively (27Fahmy K. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7229-7236Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 28Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G.

Chem. 2001; 276: 10000-10009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). No signals from Rho without Gt were detected in the control experiment. Protein Concentration Measurements and Rho Stability—Rho concentration was determined using a PerkinElmer Lambda 800 UV-visible spectrophotometer in the range of 250-650 nm. Rho samples, freshly purified by gel filtration (fraction 35 in DDM, fraction 31 in TDM, and fraction 22 in HDM), were incubated at 50 °C while being monitored by UV-Vis absorption spectra with or without 20 mm neutral NH2OH. The recorded absorbance was read at 500 nm for 2 h. A standard deviation was calculated from three sets of data from parallel experiments. Meta II Decay Rate—All measurements were performed in 10 nm Rho purified by gel filtration (fraction 35 in DDM, fraction 31 in TDM, and fraction 22 in HDM) dissolved in buffer consisting of 10 mm Bis-Tris propane, 100 mm NaCl, and 3 mm DDM or 0.5 mm TDM or 0.05 HDM, pH 6.0, which favors the formation of Meta II. A PerkinElmer LS 50B Luminescence Spectrophotometer was used to measure the intrinsic fluorescence increase due to Trp residues, which is correlated with the decrease in the protonated Schiff base concentration (data not shown, consistent with Refs. 30Farrens D.L.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9165-9171Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Rho was bleached by a Fiber-Lite illuminator covered with a long pass wavelength filter (>490 nm) for 15 s immediately before the fluorescence measurements. Bleaching was carried out from a distance of 15 cm to prevent heat accumulation, and a thermostat was applied to stabilize the temperature of the cuvette at 20 °C. Fluorometer slit settings were 2.5 nm at 295 nm for excitation and 8.0 nm at 330 nm for emission. The Effect of Detergent on the Oligomeric State of Rho—We investigated the effect of DDM, TDM, and HDM on the oligomeric state of Rho. These detergents have the same head group but contain alkyl chains of different lengths (12, 14, and 16 carbon atoms). Membrane proteins of ROS (1 mg/ml of proteins) were solubilized in 10 mm DDM, 20 mm TDM, or 20 mm HDM (see “Materials and Methods”), and proteins were fractionated using gel filtration chromatography equilibrated with the appropriate detergent. In 3 mm DDM (17 × its CMC), monomeric and dimeric Rho appeared mainly in fractions 34-35 (Fig. 1A, upper panel). In 0.5 mm TDM (50 × its CMC), Rho appeared with a peak in fraction 31 (Fig. 1B, upper panel). In 0.05 mm HDM (83 × its CMC), Rho appeared very early, mainly in fractions 22-23 (Fig. 1C, upper panel), suggesting its presence as oligomers. When the ROS sample was titrated with increased concentration of HDM from 0.05 to 0.5 mm, a similar pattern of elution was observed in gel filtration, suggesting that oligomers are present because of intrinsic stability of the complexes and not because of insufficient amount of detergent. The calculation of the molecular mass of the Rho complexes was supported by the control experiments in which ROS membranes cross-linked with dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) were solubilized by the same detergents and fractionated by gel filtration column in the same conditions as non-cross-linked ROS (data not shown) (12Jastrzebska B. Maeda T. Zhu L. Fotiadis D. Filipek S. Engel A. Stenkamp R.E. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54663-54675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Absorption spectra of Rho purified by gel filtration in examined detergents were measured (Fig. 1, upper panels, insets). The same maximum of absorption at 500 nm was observed. However, the ratio in absorption 280/500 nm was higher for Rho preparation in HDM (2.9) compared with DDM (2.0) and TDM (2.3). All of these observations indicate that both TDM and HDM preserve the oligomeric structure or that these detergents extract lipids and induce Rho to form Rho aggregates. TEM of Negatively Stained Purified Rho—Rho solubilized in DDM, TDM, or HDM exhibits different migration patterns on gel filtration columns, suggesting that the protein exists in different oligomeric states in the various detergents. We used TEM and negative staining to visualize the oligomeric state of Rho in protein peaks coming from size exclusion chromatography in the three detergents. In DDM, there were two populations of particles (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). The larger particles (major population) had a length of 7.2 ± 0.9 nm (n = 34) and a width of 6.5 ± 0.8 nm (n = 34) and frequently exhibited two elongated domains that were at a center-to-center distance of 3.6 ± 0.4 nm (n = 30). Similar values were previously found for detergent-solubilized Rho dimers (6Suda K. Filipek S. Palczewski K. Engel A. Fotiadis D. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2004; 21: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The smaller particles (minor population) had a length of 5.4 ± 0.5 nm (n = 24) and a width of 3.2 ± 0.6 nm (n = 24). These particles did not reveal a distinct substructure and exhibited dimensions compatible with monomeric Rho (34Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I.

In TDM, although the sample was not fully homogeneous, two significant populations of particles with average diameters of 9.1 ± 0.4 nm (n = 33) and 12.6 ± 0.5 nm (n = 30) were discerned (Fig. 1B). Wormlike structures having a width of 8.6 ± 0.7 nm (n = 33) were present as well (see Fig. 1B, bottom panel). In HDM the sample was not homogeneous either, but most of the particles were significantly bigger than those observed in TDM and many displayed a worm-like structure (Fig. 1C, bottom panel). These particles of varying lengths had consistent widths of ∼8.2 ± 0.6 nm (n = 26). A similar value was found for rows of Rho dimers in native disk membranes by atomic force microscopy (Fig. 1C, bottom panel, upper inset) (7Liang Y. Fotiadis D. Filipek S. Saperstein D.A.

Atomic force microscopy analysis of the structures in HDM revealed a height of 6.8 ± 1.0 nm (n = 60; data not shown), which is in good agreement with the height of Rho perpendicular to the membrane (34Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7761-7772Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). This finding strongly suggests that HDM, even at concentrations much above its CMC, is unable to disrupt tightly packed Rho structures. This might be attributed to the mildness of this detergent that preserves the native lipids in Rho oligomers. Therefore we examined the phospholipid content of the Rho samples obtained by solubilization and gel filtration purification in DDM, TDM, and HDM. Typically, in disk membranes ∼65-75 phospholipids/Rho molecule are present (36Calvert P.D. Govardovskii V.I. Krasnoperova N. Anderson R.E. Lem J. Makino C.L. Nature. 2001; 411: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 37Aveldano M.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 324: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We found that in the sample purified in DDM, the phospholipid:Rho mole ratio was 22.0 ± 3. In the sample purified in TDM, the ratio was 24.0 ± 4. The sample purified in HDM contained 44.0 ± 8 phospholipids/Rho molecule. No specific depletion of phospholipids was observed as determined by mass spectrometric analysis (see supplemental data). Gt Activation by Meta II—Differences in the oligomeric state of Rho caused by solubilization in the investigated detergents influence the rate of activation of Gt. Rho purified by gel filtration in 3 mm DDM, 0.5 mm TDM, or 0.05 mm HDM was used to activate Gt, a process monitored at 345 nm (Fig. 2A, B, and C, respectively) (28Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar, 29Heck M. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol.

Conditions for the assay were chosen so that the Gt activation rate was the same as that determined by GTPγS-induced complex dissociation (27Fahmy K. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7229-7236Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Initial activation rates were determined during the first 200 s after GTPγS addition. In all experiments, an increase of fluorescence was observed, but in the case of Rho purified in TDM the reaction was two times faster, and for Rho purified in HDM the reaction was several times faster and with higher apparent cooperativity than for Rho purified in DDM. These results suggest that Rho oligomers observed by TEM in HDM (Fig. 1C, bottom panel) represent the most active form of Rho* as compared with Rho isolated in DDM and TDM. The oligomeric organization of Rho has important implications for the fast response of the activated receptor and, thus, signal amplification. In HDM where Rho was present as the highest oligomers and the Gt activation was the fastest, the largest amount of phospholipid was attached to Rho. To determine whether phospholipids alone can influence the ability of Rho to activate Gt, the Gt activation assay was performed in samples containing the excess of exogenous phospholipids. Phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylinositol were added to Rho purified by size exclusion chromatography in DDM with the ratio of 100 phospholipids:Rho molecule. We did not detect any effect of exogenous phospholipids on the Gt activation rate (data not shown). A possible explanation for these results might be that the detergent present in the solution sequestered both phospholipids and Rho, preventing formation of Rho oligomers. These results suggest that lipids affect Rho properties indirectly by preservation of its oligomeric status. Meta II Decay—Trp residues exhibit only weak fluorescence in dark state Rho, with the maximum fluorescence at 330 nm. Following bleaching and formation of Meta II, Trp fluorescence increases (30Farrens D.L. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5073-5076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 31Schadel S.A. Heck M. Maretzki D. Filipek S. Teller D.C. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 3162-3169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The decay rates of Meta II Rho purified by gel filtration chromatography in DDM, TDM, and HDM were examined by measuring changes in Trp emission at 330 nm (Fig. 3, A, B, and C). When the data were fitted to a first-order reaction, relaxation times of τ = 17.5 min for Rho in DDM, τ = 20.4 min for Rho in TDM, and τ = 24.6 min for Rho in HDM were measured. Therefore, Meta II decay is quite similar in all used detergents, DDM, TDM, and in HDM. Because NH2OH promotes removal of the chromophore from the binding site(s) following illumination, a rapid increase in fluorescence was seen for Rho in all three detergents in the presence of NH2OH. No significant differences were observed between them (Fig. 3, A-C, and insets), suggesting that although oligomerization may affect normal channeling of the chromophore, the difference in Rho decay is alleviated in the presence of the strong nucleophile. Rho Stability—Time-dependent denaturation of Rho purified by gel filtration in DDM, TDM, or HDM was also measured. Rho in TDM and HDM (Fig. 4, B and C, filled circles) was more stable than Rho in DDM (Fig. 4A, filled circles). After 2 h of incubation at 50 °C, 60% of Rho in DDM lost its chromophore, whereas Rho in both TDM and HDM was very stable (Fig. 4, B and C, filled circles), indicating that the tightly packed oligomeric state protects the protein from denaturing. This difference in stability between the different forms of Rho was not diminished even when a strong nucleophile, NH2OH, was added (Fig. 4, A-C, empty circles), suggesting that the highly organized Rho is more stable than the dissociated Rho in DDM (Fig. 4A, empty circles). Increasing evidence supports the idea that GPCRs in membranes exist as homo- and/or heterodimeric complexes (2Terrillon S. Bouvier M. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these dimers may be organized into higher order structures (for example, see Refs. 1Park P.S. Filipek S. Wells J.W. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15643-15656Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 3Filipek S. Krzysko K.A. Fotiadis D. Liang Y. Saperstein D.A. Engel A. Palczewski K. Photochem.

The oligomeric structures appear to be preserved among other GPCRs because they are essential for biosynthesis, cellular transport, diversification, and degradation (reviewed in Ref. 2Terrillon S. Bouvier M. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies on serotonin 5-HT2C further support the stoichiometry of two GPCRs/one G protein molecule (39Herrick-Davis K. Grinde E. Harrigan T.J. Mazurkiewicz J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40144-40151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Here we tested the influence of alkyl-maltosides on the preservation of Rho oligomers as well as on the relationship between the quaternary structure of Rho and its signal transduction capacity. Rho solubilized in three different detergents was purified by gel filtration chromatography, and protein particles of different molecular masses were visualized by TEM. TDM and HDM have the same polar groups as the widely used DDM, but they contain longer alkyl chains (14 and 16 instead of 12 carbon atoms). This is expected to have an effect on the stability of the oligomeric structure of Rho. It has been shown that purified leukotriene B4 receptor BLT1 is more stable in detergents with long hydrophobic chains than in detergents with short chains (5Baneres J.L. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 815-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 40Mesnier D. Baneres J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49664-49670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Alternatively, TDM and HDM might extract more lipids during solubilization than DDM, causing receptor aggregation or oligomeric structure preservation. We found no significant change in the different types of phospholipids among all solubilized Rho preparations, but approximately twice as many total phospholipids were associated with Rho purified in HDM than in DDM and TDM. As observed earlier, CHAPS also has the ability to extract similar amounts of phospholipids, and a higher oligomeric organization of Rho in this detergent was reported (12Jastrzebska B. Maeda T. Zhu L. Fotiadis D. Filipek S. Engel A. Stenkamp R.E. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54663-54675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 41Aveldano M.I. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1229-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). By negative stain TEM we have observed that Rho solubilized in 3 mm DDM exhibited a bimodal size distribution. The larger particles comprised the predominant population and possessed shapes and dimensions similar to previously examined Rho dimers (6Suda K. Filipek S. Palczewski K. Engel A. Fotiadis D. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2004; 21: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The loss of Gt activation capacity of these preparations is apparently related to the disruption of Rho oligomers by solubilization in DDM. HDM-solubilized Rho, however, revealed a more heterogeneous particle distribution exhibiting a large variation in shape and size. The frequent worm-like structures had a width compatible with those of the rows of Rho dimers seen by atomic force microscopy in native disk membranes (7Liang Y. Fotiadis D. Filipek S.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 564: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). When considering G protein coupling, there is a strong possibility that GPCRs are induced to be organized into dimers or higher oligomers. However, our results strongly support the hypothesis that the functionally most active unit of Rho is a dimer organized in higher ordered structures. Therefore, the oligomeric organization of Rho has important implications for Gt recognition, binding kinetics, signal amplification, and termination. Our experiments demonstrate that Rho activity goes down in the samples containing fewer dimers. In DDM where a mixture of Rho monomers and dimers was observed, the activity of Rho is the lowest and it increases with higher oligomerization. In HDM, where the highest oligomers were present, Rho appears to be the most active. These results explain how the dense packing and high organization of Rho molecules is important for rapid light signal transmission. Our results from biochemical analyses together with mass spectrometric analysis of lipids suggest that lipids affect Rho properties indirectly by preservation of its oligomeric status. Rho oligomers in TDM and HDM display higher stability than Rho in DDM. This is not surprising, considering that Rho could be stabilized by additional interactions between neighboring Rho molecules. In summary, for the first time for any GPCR we have isolated different oligomeric complexes of Rho. We find that oligomeric Rho is the active form, whereas monomeric Rho may have lost the ability to efficiently activate Gt. This suggests that oligomerization of GPCRs may be crucial for signal transduction.

It is composed of silica needles (spicules), which provide the morphogenetic scaffold of these metazoans. In the center of the spicules there is an axial filament that consists predominantly of silicatein, an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of biosilica. By differential display of transcripts we identified additional proteins involved in silica formation. Two genes were isolated from the marine demosponge Suberites domuncula; one codes for a galectin and the other for a fibrillar collagen. The galectin forms aggregates to which silicatein molecules bind. The extent of the silicatein-mediated silica formation strongly increased if associated with the galectin. By applying a new and mild extraction procedure that avoids hydrogen fluoride treatment, native axial filaments were extracted from spicules of S. domuncula. These filaments contained, in addition to silicatein, the galectin and a few other proteins. Immunogold electron microscopic studies underscored the role of these additional proteins, in particular that of galectin, in spiculogenesis. Galectin, in addition to silicatein, presumably forms in the axial canal as well as on the surface of the spicules an organized net-like matrix. In the extraspicular space most of these complexes are arranged concentrically around the spicules. Taken together, these additional proteins, working together with silicatein, may also be relevant for potential (nano)-biotechnological applications of silicatein in the formation of surface coatings. Finally, we propose a scheme that outlines the matrix (galectin/silicatein)-guided appositional growth of spicules through centripetal and centrifugal synthesis and deposition of biosilica.

The members of the phylum Porifera (sponges) are grouped according to their mineral skeleton into three classes: Hexactinellida and Demospongiae, which comprise a siliceous skeleton, and Calcarea, with calcareous skeletal materials (1Bergquist P.R. Sponges. University of California, Berkeley, CA1978Google Scholar). The elements constituting these skeletons are termed spicules; they are used as systematic characters for a given sponge species (2Schulze F.E. von Lendenfeld R. Die Bezeichnung der Spongiennadeln. Georg Reimer, Berlin1889Google Scholar). Given the comprehensive studies of Bütschli (3Bütschli O. Z. Wiss. Zool. 1901; 64: 235-286Google Scholar) and Minchin (4Minchin E.A. Ergeb. Fortschr. Zool. 1909; 2: 171-274Google Scholar), a descriptive view of the formation of the siliceous spicules has been well established. In demosponges, where most studies have been performed with Suberites domuncula, spicules are initially formed within specialized cells called sclerocytes (5Müller W.E.G. Belikov S.I. Tremel W. Perry C.C. Gieskes W.W.C. Boreiko A. Schröder H.C. Micron. 2006; 37: 107-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). S. domuncula has the advantage of containing only macroscleres (tylostyles/oxeas), whereas most other sponges, e.g. Tethya aurantium, contain macroscleres (oxeas) as well as microscleres (spherasters) (6Müller W.E.G. Zahn R.K. Senckenb. Biol. 1968; 49: 469-478Google Scholar). Spicules have in their center a 1-2-μm-wide axial canal (7Uriz M.J. Turon X. Becerro M.A. Cell Tissue Res. 2000; 301: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), which contains the axial filament. In demosponges first siliceous deposits are arranged around this axial filament. When spicules reach lengths of about 10 μm they are extruded from the cells. The spicules are completed extracellularly in the mesohyl (8Müller W.E.G. Rothenberger M. Boreiko A. Tremel W. Reiber A. Schröder H.C. Cell Tissue Res. 2005; 321: 285-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), where they reach final sizes of 10 μm (microscleres) and 200 μm (macroscleres) as well as their final shapes by appositional growth (7Uriz M.J. Turon X. Becerro M.A. Cell Tissue Res. 2000; 301: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 9Müller W.E.G. Borejko A. Brandt D. Osinga R. Ushijima H. Hamer B. Krasko A. Xupeng C. Müller I.M. Schröder H.C. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 3838-3852Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Major progress in understanding the biochemical mechanism of spicule formation in Demospongiae came from the discovery that silica deposition in T. aurantium is catalyzed by the enzyme silicatein (10Shimizu K. Cha J. Stucky G.D. Morse D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6234-6238Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 11Weaver J.C. Morse D.E. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2003; 62: 256-367Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar); silicatein exists in the axial filament around which the first layer(s) of biosilica are formed. The axial filament had been isolated by hydrogen fluoride (HF), 2The abbreviations used are: HF, hydrogen fluoride; CDP-Star, cytidine 5′-diphosphate(disodium 2-chloro-5-(4-methoxyspiro{1,2-dioxetane-3,2′-(5′-chloro)-tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7]-decan}-4-yl)phenyl phosphate); RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; pAb, polyclonal antibody; pAb-aSILIC, pAb against silicatein; pAb-aGALEC2, pAb against GALEC2; nt, nucleotide; aa, amino acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. which dissolves the biosilica of the spicules. During this procedure O-glycosidic and phosphate ester bonds in proteins are split off. As reported for the silaffins in diatoms, this treatment results in a loss of phosphate groups of the structural molecules and also a modification of their functions (12Kröger N. Deutzmann R. Sumper M. Science. 1999; 286: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar, 13Kröger N. Lorenz S. Brunner E. Sumper M. Science. 2002; 298: 584-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Therefore, the (apparently pure) preparation of the axial filaments (composed of silicatein) from T. aurantium studied hitherto (10Shimizu K. Cha J. Stucky G.D. Morse D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6234-6238Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 14Cha J.N. Shimizu K. Zhou Y. Christianssen S.C. Chmelka B.F. Stucky G.D. Morse D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, the reported presence of three different but related silicateins (silicatein-α,-β, and -γ) in the axial filaments of spicules had not been substantiated on molecular level. Until now, only genes encoding silicateins α and β could be isolated from T. aurantium (10Shimizu K. Cha J. Stucky G.D. Morse D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 4878-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar); it may however be possible that the transcript level of the putative silicatein-γ is too low. Very recently it could be proven that axial filaments of S. domuncula contain, in addition to silicatein, other proteins such as selenoprotein M or the spiculeassociated protein (9Müller W.E.G. Borejko A. Brandt D. Osinga R. Ushijima H. Hamer B. Krasko A. Xupeng C. Müller I.M. Schröder H.C. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 3838-3852Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A thorough cytological and electron microscopic study revealed that the axial canal, which harbors the axial filament, is filled with a non-homogenous material (8Müller W.E.G. Rothenberger M. Boreiko A. Tremel W. Reiber A. Schröder H.C. Cell Tissue Res. 2005; 321: 285-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the silicateins in S. domuncula are phosphorylated proteins, which are HF-labile. Only in this state are they able to oligomerize (form silicatein dimers and trimers) (8Müller W.E.G. Rothenberger M. Boreiko A. Tremel W. Reiber A. Schröder H.C. Cell Tissue Res. 2005; 321: 285-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Even though the enzymatic activity of silicatein isolated from axial filaments by HF treatment, as well as the enzymatic activity of recombinant silicatein, can be demonstrated to a limited extent, which likely does not reflect the physiological in vivo activity seen in the animal (14Cha J.N. Shimizu K. Zhou Y. Christianssen S.C. Chmelka B.F. Stucky G.D. Morse D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 15Krasko A. Batel R.

Under optimal conditions, spicules have an astonishing growth rate of 5 μm/h (16Weissenfels N. Biologie und Mikroskopische Anatomie der Süβwasserschwämme (Spongillidae). Gustav Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart, Germany1989Google Scholar), which certainly cannot be attributed to silicatein or recombinant silicatein alone (14Cha J.N. Shimizu K. Zhou Y. Christianssen S.C.

Because silicatein might be technically used to form silica nanoparticles and nanofibers under ambient (low temperature and low pressure) conditions (17Müller W.E.G. Schröder H.C. Lorenz B.

Silicatein, when chemically bound to metal surfaces, e.g. gold, retains its biocatalytic activity (18Tahir M.N. Théato P. Müller W.E.G. Schröder H.C. Janshoff A. Zhang J. Huth J. Tremel W. Chem.

Even more impressive are studies demonstrating that immobilized silicatein also allows the biosynthesis of titania and zirconia (19Tahir M.N. Théato P. Müller W.E.G. Schröder H.C. Borejko A.

Here we present a comprehensive study on the role of silicatein from S. domuncula in silica/spicule formation. The question by which molecules silica deposition in sponge spicules is biologically controlled is addressed and partially answered. Evidence is presented that a galectin builds, in concert with collagen, a proteinaceous framework into which silica is deposited. These studies took advantage of (a) the primmorph culture system, a special form of three-dimensional cell aggregates that comprise proliferating and differentiating sponge cells (20Müller W.E.G. Wiens M. Batel R. Steffen R. Borojevic R. Custodio R.M. Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser. 1999; 178: 205-219Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and (b) antibodies against silicatein. Chemicals, Materials, and Enzymes—Restriction enzymes, a Total RNA isolation kit, and reagents for the RACE procedure were purchased from Invitrogen; TriplEx2 vector from BD Biosciences; pET-41a(+) vector and BugBuster reagent from Novagen (Darmstadt, Germany); TRIzol reagent from Invitrogen; Hybond-N+ nylon membrane from Amersham Biosciences; Cy3-conjugated F(ab′)2 goat antirabbit IgG from Jackson ImmunoResearch; PCR-DIG probe-synthesis kit, a BM chemiluminescence blotting substrate kit, proteinase inhibitor mixture, and CDP-Star from Roche Applied Science; sodium metasilicate from Aldrich; a silicon test colorimetric assay kit and silicon standards from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany); natural seawater (containing 5 μm silicate) and tetraethoxysilane from Sigma; protein A/G-agarose beads from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); 1.4-nm nanogold anti-rabbit IgG from Nanoprobes (Yapbank, NY); and rhodamineconjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin from Dako (Carpinteria, CA). The synthetic oligopeptide was custom-synthesized. Sponges and Primmorphs—Specimens of the marine sponge S. domuncula (Porifera, Demospongiae, Hadromerida) were collected in the northern Adriatic Sea near Rovinj, Croatia, and then kept in aquaria in Mainz, Germany, at a temperature of 17 °C for more than 5 months. Primmorphs, the in vitro cell culture system, were prepared as described (15Krasko A. Batel R. Schröder H.C. Müller I.M. Müller W.E.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4878-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). These three-dimensional cell aggregates were used 5 days after their formation. Primmorphs were kept in natural seawater (containing 4-6 μm silicate) supplemented with 1% RPMI 1640 medium in the absence or presence of 60 μm sodium silicate (as sodium metasilicate) for up to 5 days. Extracts from primmorphs or from sponge tissue were prepared by homogenization in lysis buffer (1× Trisbuffered saline, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet-P40, and protease inhibitor mixture (1 tablet/10 ml)) and centrifuged, and the supernatants were subjected to further analysis. Isolation of the Proteins from Spicules—In earlier studies isolated spicules had been treated with HF to obtain the axial filament (10Shimizu K. Cha J. Stucky G.D. Morse D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6234-6238Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). In the present study this harsh procedure was replaced by treatment of the spicules with lysis buffer supplemented with 4 m urea. At first the spicules were isolated from tissue, collected (8Müller W.E.G. Rothenberger M. Boreiko A. Tremel W. Reiber A. Schröder H.C. Cell Tissue Res. 2005; 321: 285-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and then pulverized thoroughly in a mortar. The lysis-urea buffer was added, and the suspension was stirred for 1 h at 4 °C and subsequently centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used for further analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Differential Display and Cloning of Galectin and Collagen cDNAs—The technique of differential display of transcripts was performed as described previously (21Müller W.E.G. Krasko A. Skorokhod A. Bünz C. Grebenjuk V.A. Steffen R. Batel R. Schröder H.C. Immunogenetics. 2002; 54: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). RNA (1 μg) from untreated primmorphs (control, 0 days) and primmorphs treated for 2 days with 60 μm sodium silicate, was reverse-transcribed using the T11CC oligonucleotide as 3′ primer. The resulting cDNA was added to the PCR using the arbitrary primer GTGATCGCAG and the T11CC primer in the assay together with [α-32P]dATP. Among the dominantly expressed genes, collagen (SDCOLL3) and galectin (SDGALEC2) transcripts as well as transcripts of the silicatein-α gene (SDSILCAa) were identified. The ∼300-380-nt-long sequences were completed by 5′-RACE with vector primers of the cDNA library from S. domuncula (22Kruse M. Steffen R. Batel R. Müller I.M. Müller W.E.G. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4305-4313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The complete clone for collagen-3 (SDCOLL3) comprises 1302 nts, and that for galectin-2 (SDGA-LEC2) 955 nts. Northern Blotting—RNA was extracted from liquid nitrogen-pulverized sponge tissue with TRIzol reagent. Total RNA (5 μg) was electrophoresed through a 1% formaldehyde/agarose gel and blotted onto Hybond N+ membrane following the manufacturer's instructions (23Wiens M. Koziol C. Hassanein H.M.A. Batel R. Müller W.E.G. Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser. 1998; 165: 247-257Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed with the following probes (complete cDNAs from S. domuncula): silicatein-α (SDSILCAa (GenBank™ accession number CAC03737.1)), collagen (SDCOLL3), and galectin-2 (SDGALEC2), as well as the housekeeping cDNA for β-tubulin (SDTUB (AJ5508069)). Northern blot signals were quantified by the chemiluminescence procedure (24Stanley P.E. Kricka L.J. Bioluminescence and Chemiluminescence: Current Status. John Wiley and Sons, New York1990Google Scholar) with CDP-Star as substrate. The screen was scanned with the GS-525 molecular imager (Bio-Rad). Preparation of Recombinant S. domuncula Galectin-2 and Antibodies—The complete open reading frame of SDGALEC2 was expressed in Escherichia coli using the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion system in the pET-41a(+) vector as described (25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidmann J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York2004Google Scholar, 26Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester2000: 2.0.1-2.8.17Google Scholar). The GST fusion protein (65 kDa) was purified by GST-Bind Resign affinity chromatography. The fusion protein was then cleaved with enterokinase to separate the N-terminal GST tag and His tag as well as the S-tag from the recombinant galectin (rGALEC2_SUBDO). This resulting galectin-2 carried at its C terminus a small His tag. Gel electrophoresis of protein extracts was performed in polyacrylamide gels (12% gels) containing 0.1% SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies (pAb) were raised against the purified, recombinant galectin-2 (rGALEC2_SUBDO) in female rabbits (New Zealand White) as described (28Schütze J. Skorokhod A. Müller I.M. Müller W.E.G. J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 53: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). 10 μg of recombinant protein per injection was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After three boosts the serum was collected; the pAb against galectin-2 was termed pAb-aGA-LEC2. The titer of the antibodies was 1:3,000. In the controls, adsorbed pAb-aGALEC2 (100 μl of antibodies were incubated with 20 μg of rGALEC2_SUBDO) was used. Likewise, pAbs against silicatein (pAb-aSILIC) were raised against axial filaments from spicules, containing mainly silicatein, as described earlier (8Müller W.E.G. Rothenberger M. Boreiko A. Tremel W. Reiber A. Schröder H.C. Cell Tissue Res. 2005; 321: 285-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—For co-immunoprecipitation the described protocol (29Klenova E. Chernukhin I. Inoue T. Shamsuddin S. Norton J. Methods (London). 2002; 26: 254-259Google Scholar, 30Wiens M. Korzhev M. Krasko A. Thakur N.L. Perović-Ottstadt S. Breter H.J. Ushijima H. Diehl-Seifert B. Müller I.M. Müller W.E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27949-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) was applied. Primmorph samples (200 mg each) were exposed in seawater to 60 μm sodium silicate for 0-5 days. Then they were shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen, subjected to twice the volume of lysis buffer (1× Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet-P40, 10 mm NaF, protease inhibitor mixture (1 tablet/10 ml), and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate), homogenized, incubated for 60 min at 37 °C, and then brought to 4 °C. Finally the samples were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation or Western blot analyses. For each immunoprecipitation a 100-μl aliquot of the lysate was incubated with 2 μl of undiluted serum (preimmune or immune pAb (pAb-aGALEC2 or pAb-aSILIC)) for 1 h (4 °C). Protein A/G-agarose beads (10 μl) were added and after 3 h were washed with lysis buffer and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. SDS-PAGE-fractionated proteins were analyzed on Western blots. The membranes were probed with the pAb (pAb-aGALEC2 or pAb-aSILIC) and detected by anti-rabbit IgG (peroxidase-coupled) using the BM chemiluminescence blotting substrate kit. In control experiments 100 μl of the respective antibodies pAb-aGALEC2 and pAb-aSILIC were adsorbed with 20 μg of the recombinant proteins (rGALEC2_SUBDO or rSILIC_SUBDO) during an incubation period of 30 min (4 °C) prior to their use. Competition experiments with the synthetic oligopeptide (corresponding to the hydrophobic C terminus of galectin-2) were performed as follows. The 100-μl extract in lysis buffer was supplemented with 5 μl of the oligopeptide (5 μg), allowed to stand for 60 min at 37 °C, and then brought to 4 °C. Subsequently, the samples were processed with the antibodies as described above. Silicatein Enzyme Assay—For these studies recombinant silicatein was used; preparation (17Müller W.E.G.

Grebenjuk V.A. Steffen R. Müller I.M. Müller W.E.G. DNA Cell Biol. 2002; 21: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) were as described previously. In a total volume of 500 μl, 100 μg of recombinant silicatein was added to the 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2 (10 mm dl-dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 1 μm ZnCl2,5 μm Fe3+ citrate, 5 mm CaCl2,5 mm MgCl2). 1 mm tetraethoxysilane was used as substrate. Reaction proceeded at 22 °C for 0-120 min and was terminated by centrifugation (20,000 × g; 4 °C, 15 min). The sediment was hydrolyzed by NaOH, and the released silicic acid was determined as described (14Cha J.N. Shimizu K. Zhou Y. Christianssen S.C. Chmelka B.F. Stucky G.D. Morse D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Where specified, the standard assays were performed in the absence of silicatein, or they contained 100 μg of galectin-2 (rGALEC2_SUBDO) instead of silicatein or 100 μg of galectin-2 together with 100 μg of silicatein. Aggregate Formation of Recombinant Galectin-2—To visualize aggregate formation of rGALEC2_SUBDO in vitro recombinant protein (0.1 mg/ml) was dissolved in PBS supplemented with 5 mm CaCl2. After standing on ice for 2-30 min, samples were dropped onto a carboncoated copper grid. After drying, the film was stained with platinum and examined by electron microscope (32Diehl-Seifert B. Kurelec B. Zahn R.K. Dorn A. Jerecevic B. Uhlenbruck G. Müller W.E.G. J. Cell Sci. 1985; 79: 271-285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—For transmission microscopic analysis, sponge primmorphs or tissue samples were cut into pieces (1 mm3), incubated in phosphate buffer, and then washed in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, at room temperature as described (5Müller W.E.G.

Reiber A. Schröder H.C. Cell Tissue Res. 2005; 321: 285-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). After the samples were treated with 1.25% NaHCO3,2%OsO4, and 1% NaCl, they were dehydrated with ethanol. The dried samples were fixed in propylene oxide/araldite, covered with pure araldite, and hardened at 60 °C for 2 days prior to cutting to 60-nm ultrathin slices (Ultracut S; Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). The samples were transferred onto coated copper grids and analyzed with a Tecnai 12 microscope (FEI Electron Optics, Eindhoven, Netherlands). Electron immunogold labeling was performed with primmorph/tissue samples treated in glutaraldehyde/paraformaldehyde buffered in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (5Müller W.E.G. Belikov S.I. Tremel W.

Cell Tissue Res. 2005; 321: 285-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The material was dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in LR-White resin. 60-nm thick slices were cut and blocked with bovine serum albumin in PBS and then incubated with the primary antibody pAb-aSILIC (1:1,000) for 12 h at 4 °C. In controls, preimmune serum were used. After three washes with PBS, 1% BSA, sections were incubated with a 1:100 dilution of the secondary antibody (1.4-nm nanogold anti-rabbit IgG; diluted 1:200) for 2 h. Sections were rinsed in PBS, treated with glutaraldehyde/PBS, washed, and dried. Subsequently, enhancing of the immunocomplexes was performed with silver as described (33Danscher G. Histochemistry. 1981; 71: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). The samples were examined as described above with the Tecnai 12 microscope. S. domuncula Collagen—The sponge collagen was isolated from fresh tissue by urea extraction followed by acid precipitation (32Diehl-Seifert B. Kurelec B. Zahn R.K. Dorn A. Jerecevic B. Uhlenbruck G. Müller W.E.G. J. Cell Sci. 1985; 79: 271-285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fibrils were visualized electron microscopically after negative staining with potassium phosphotungstate and shadowing with platinum. Immunohistology—Tissue samples were embedded in paraformaldehyde. After dehydration the samples were embedded in Technovit 8100, and 8-μm-thick sections were cut (8Müller W.E.G. Rothenberger M. Boreiko A. Tremel W. Reiber A. Schröder H.C. Cell Tissue Res. 2005; 321: 285-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The sponge tissue was not treated with HF/NaF solution to ensure that siliceous spicules were not removed. The sections were incubated with the anti-galectin-2 antibody (pAb-aGALEC2); rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin was used as a secondary antibody. The preimmune rabbit serum was used as a control. Further details were given recently (9Müller W.E.G. Borejko A. Brandt D. Osinga R. Ushijima H. Hamer B. Krasko A. Xupeng C. Müller I.M. Schröder H.C. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 3838-3852Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The immunofluorescence analysis was done with an Olympus AHBT3 light microscope together with an AH3-RFC reflected light fluorescence attachment at an emission wavelength of 546 nm (filter G). Further Analytical Methods—For the quantification of protein, the Bradford method (34Compton S. Jones C.G. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 151: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) (Roti-Quant solution-Roth) was used. The N-terminal part of the mature galectin-2 protein was determined as described earlier (35Pfeifer K. Haasemann M. Gamulin V. Bretting H. Fahrenholz F. Müller W.E.G. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). After size separation by SDS-gel electrophoresis the N terminus of galectin-2 was determined by direct protein sequencing. By differential display in addition to the silicatein-α gene (SDSILCAa; CAC03737.1), two major genes were identified that are expressed in primmorphs in response to sodium silicate treatment. Analysis revealed that one of these transcript codes was for a galectin and the other one for a collagen protein; both cDNAs were completed. Galectin—The 955-nt-long cDNA for galectin (SDGALEC2) comprises one open reading frame between nt70/72 and nt949-951[stop]. The deduced protein (GALEC2a_SUBDO) of 293 aa (Fig. 1) has a predicted size of 33,091 Da. Galectin-2 shows two galactoside-binding lectin domains (Motif Scan), which s"
https://openalex.org/W2084403389,"Unlike most receptors, Notch serves as both the receiver and direct transducer of signaling events. Activation can be mediated by one of five membrane-bound ligands of either the Delta-like (-1, -2, -4) or Jagged/Serrate (-1, -2) families. Alternatively, dissociation of the Notch heterodimer with consequent activation can also be mediated experimentally by calcium chelators or by mutations that destabilize the Notch1 heterodimer, such as in the human disease T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Here we show that MAGP-2, a protein present on microfibrils, can also interact with the EGF-like repeats of Notch1. Co-expression of MAGP-2 with Notch1 leads to both cell surface release of the Notch1 extracellular domain and subsequent activation of Notch signaling. Moreover, we demonstrate that the C-terminal domain of MAGP-2 is required for binding and activation of Notch1. Based on the high level of homology, we predicted and further showed that MAGP-1 can also bind to Notch1, cause the release of the extracellular domain, and activate signaling. Notch1 extracellular domain release induced by MAGP-2 is dependent on formation of the Notch1 heterodimer by a furin-like cleavage, but does not require the subsequent ADAM metalloprotease cleavage necessary for production of the Notch signaling fragment. Together these results demonstrate for the first time that the microfibrillar proteins MAGP-1 and MAGP-2 can function outside of their role in elastic fibers to activate a cellular signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1991005717,"Mutations in the 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate-O-acyltransferase 2 (AGPAT2) gene have been identified in individuals affected with congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL). AGPAT2 catalyzes acylation of lysophosphatidic acid to phosphatidic acid, a precursor for both triacylglycerol (TAG) and phospholipid synthesis. Recent studies suggest that reduced AGPAT2 enzymatic activity may underlie the CGL clinical phenotype. To gain insight into how altered AGPAT2 activity causes lipodystrophy, we examined the effect of knockdown of AGPAT2 expression in preadipocytes on TAG synthesis and storage, and on adipocyte differentiation. We show that AGPAT2 mRNA expression is induced 30-fold during adipocyte differentiation and that AGPAT2 enzymatic activity is required for TAG mass accumulation in mature adipocytes. We demonstrate that small interference RNA-mediated knockdown of AGPAT2 expression prevents appropriate early induction of C/EBPβ and PPARγ, key transcriptional activators of the adipogenic program, and delays expression of multiple adipocyte-related genes. The unexpected finding, that levels of several phospholipid species, including phosphatidic acid (PA), are elevated in TAG-depleted adipocytes with AGPAT2 knockdown, suggests that impaired AGPAT2 activity affects availability of PA for TAG synthesis but not overall PA synthesis nor utilization of PA for phospholipid synthesis.

AGPAT2 (also referred to as lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase or LPAAT-β) encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the acylation of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) to phosphatidic acid (PA), which serves as a precursor for triacylglycerol (TAG) and phospholipid synthesis (4Vance D.

Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 134-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar).AGPAT2 is one of five murine lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase isoforms that have been identified (AGPAT1–5), each of which contains a highly conserved catalytic (NHX4D) and substrate binding motif (EGTR) (6Lu B. Jiang Y. Zhou Y. Xu F. Hatch G. Choy P. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although there are differences in the tissue distribution of the AGPAT isoforms, the physiological significance of this diversity is not understood. AGPAT1 and AGPAT3 are ubiquitously expressed, whereas AGPAT2, AGPAT4, and AGPAT5 are expressed in a tissue-specific manner (6Lu B. Jiang Y. Zhou Y. Xu F. Hatch G. Choy P. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In human tissues AGPAT2 is highly expressed in liver, pancreas, skeletal muscle, and small intestine (7Eberhardt C. Gray P. Tjoelker L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20299-20305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and is the most highly expressed AGPAT isoform in adipose tissue (3Agarwal A. Arioglu E. de Almeida S. Akkoc N. Taylor S. Bowcock A. Barnes R. Garg A. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 21-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar).Structure-function studies of AGPAT2 mutations identified in CGL patients demonstrated reduced conversion of LPA to PA, suggesting that reduced AGPAT2 enzymatic activity may underlie the CGL clinical phenotype (8Haque W. Garg A. Agarwal A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 327: 446-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Decreased availability of PA for TAG biosynthesis could cause lipodystrophy by resulting in reduced triglyceride synthesis and storage in adipocytes (9Agarwal A. Garg A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 14: 214-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). On the other hand, individuals affected with CGL have reduced serum adipokines, such as leptin and adiponectin, suggesting that AGPAT2 function is critical for adipocyte growth and differentiation (9Agarwal A. Garg A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 14: 214-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It is possible that altered AGPAT2 activity causes lipodystrophy by affecting formation of intermediates in the TAG and phospholipid biosynthetic pathways, such as PA and diacylglycerol, rather than through disruption of TAG synthesis per se. PA serves as an important lipid second messenger that participates in intracellular signaling events, such as mediating the mitogenic action of growth factors and as a regulator of G protein-coupled signaling pathways (10Fang Y. Vilella-Bach M. Bachman R. Flanigan A. Chen J. Science. 2001; 294: 1942-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar, 11Ouyang Y.-S. Tu Y. Barker S. Yang F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11115-11122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). PA can also be hydrolyzed to yield diacylglycerol, a key lipid-signaling molecule (12Topham M. Prescott S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar).In the present study we examine the contribution of AGPAT2 to TAG synthesis in adipocytes and its role in adipogenesis. We demonstrate that AGPAT2 gene expression is induced during adipocyte differentiation and that AGPAT2 enzymatic activity is required for the TAG accumulation in mature adipocytes. We show that siRNA-mediated knockdown of AGPAT2 expression prevents appropriate early induction of the C/EBPβ and PPARγ transcription factors, providing evidence that AGPAT2 expression is essential for adipocyte differentiation. The unexpected finding that levels of multiple phospholipid species, including PA, are elevated in adipocytes with AGPAT2 knockdown suggests that other AGPAT isoforms can partially compensate for decreased AGPAT2 activity by channeling metabolic intermediates to phospholipid, but not TAG, synthesis. These findings underscore the importance of an AGPAT2-mediated metabolic pathway in adipocyte differentiation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The HA antibody was obtained from BD Biosciences. 16% paraformaldehyde solution was obtained from Electron Microscopy Sciences.

Nakano. To generate CHO/AGPAT2-HA cell lines, CHO-K1 cells were infected with retrovirus prepared by transient transfection of 293GPG packaging cells (14Ory D.S. Neugeboren B.A. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 11400-11406Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar) with the ΔU3AGPAT2-HA plasmid. Stable knockdown of AGPAT2 in OP9 cells was achieved by transient transfection with pSilencer2.1-U6 vectors encoding siRNA sequences and selection in media containing 0.3 mg/ml hygromycin. Populations of OP9 cells that stably expressed the siRNA sequences were obtained and were used for the siRNA-mediated knockdown experiments.Cell Culture—Cells were maintained in monolayer culture at 37 °C with 5% CO2. All CHO-derived cell lines were maintained in medium A (1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagles's medium:Ham's F-12, 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin). 293GPG cells were cultured as described previously (14Ory D.S. Neugeboren B.A. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 11400-11406Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). OP9 cells were cultured in medium B (minimal essential medium-α, 20% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin). For differentiation, OP9 cells were fed medium C (minimal essential medium-α, 10% fetal calf serum inactivated at 65 °C for 30 min, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.5 mm IBMX, 0.25 μm dexamethasone, and 1 μg/ml insulin) on day 0 and then fed medium D (medium C without IBMX or dexamethasone) on day 2. On day 4, cells were re-fed and maintained in medium B.Protein Preparation from Cells—For total post-nuclear supernatants, CHO cells were lysed in TNET (1% Triton X-100, 0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 1× Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation. For microsome isolation, CHO cells were homogenized in buffer containing 0.5 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1× Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation, and microsomes were pelleted by centrifugation for 1 h at 356,000 × g. For alkaline extraction, CHO cells were homogenized in 100 mm Na2CO3, pH 11.5, with NaOH, and microsomes were prepared from post-nuclear supernatants as described. Detergent lysates were prepared from OP9 cells in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA). Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g at 4 °C. For all protein preparations, proteins were quantified using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) Protein Assay Kit (Pierce).SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—All protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose (0.45 μm, Schleicher & Schuell) with a semi-dry electroblotter (Owl Scientific). Western blot analysis was performed using primary antibodies to HA (1:1,000, murine monoclonal), ACSL1 (1:1,000, rabbit polyclonal), GLUT4 (1:500, rabbit polyclonal), perilipin (1:5,000, guinea pig polyclonal), adiponectin (1:1,000, rabbit polyclonal), β-actin (1:300, rabbit polyclonal), and AP2 (1:5,000, rabbit polyclonal). For secondary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000, Jackson ImmunoResearch), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000, Jackson ImmunoResearch), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-guinea pig IgG (1:3,500, Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used. Detection was by chemiluminescence (Renaissance reagents, PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Immunofluorescence—CHO cells expressing human AGPAT2-HA were plated on glass coverslips, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, permeabilized in PBS/0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and blocked in PBS/5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. Detection of AGPAT2-HA and BiP was performed using an αHA monoclonal antibody (1:250 dilution) and anαBiP rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:50 dilution, Stressgen). Cells were incubated with goat anti-rabbit Alexa 568 and goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes), mounted in ProLong Antifade medium (Molecular Probes), and viewed with a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal/multiphoton laser scanning imaging system (15Frolov A.

Microsomes were resuspended in Tris 50 mm HCl. Protein was determined by BCA, and lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase activity was assayed as described previously (8Haque W. Garg A. Agarwal A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 327: 446-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), measuring the rate of conversion of [3H]LPA to [3H]PA. A chromatography recovery standard was added (40 μg of phosphatidic acid and 5 nCi of [14C]PA), and samples were dried under nitrogen. The lipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC, PE SIL G plates from Whatman) using a chloroform:acetone:methanol:acetic acid:water (50:20:10:10:5) solvent system and visualized with iodine. [3H]PA and [14C]PA were quantified by liquid scintillation counting.Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from OP9 cells stably expressing siRNA1, -2, and -3 at the indicated day of differentiation using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Northern blotting was performed as described (16Schaeffer P. Wende A. Magee C. Neilson J. Leone T. Chen F. Kelly D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39593-39603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and blots were probed with a 0.84-kb 32P-labeled probe complementary to hAGPAT2. 18 S RNA served as a loading control.Real-time Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—RNA was harvested as above and was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using SuperScriptII RNase H-reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primers (Invitrogen). cDNA was then amplified for 40 PCR cycles using SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) and template-specific primers (50 nm) in an ABI Prism 7500 sequence detector. Primer sequences were selected using Primer express software (ABI) and are listed in Table 2. Relative quantification of gene expression was performed using the comparative threshold (CT) method as described by the manufacturer. Changes in mRNA expression level were calculated following normalization to expression of 36B4, a housekeeping gene whose expression does not change during differentiation of OP9 cells (not shown).TABLE 2Primer pairs used for RTQ-PCRGenemRNA acession no.PrimersmAGPAT1NM_0188625′–CCCTCGACCTGCTTGGAA–3′5′–GCTCACGCTTGGCAATGG–3′mAGPAT2NM_0262125′–ATGGACCCGTGGCCATGGCTGACG–3′5′–CTACTGGGCTGGCAAGACCCCAGG–3′mAGPAT3NM_0530145′–GCTTAGCTGACTACCCAGAGTACATG–3′5′–GATGCGATGCTTGGTCTCTGT–3′mAGPAT4NM_0266445′–CCAGCCAGTTGGTGATGCTT–3′5′–CGGGTCGGTGTAGATGGTACA–3′mAGPAT5NM_0267925′–CAGGAACACCGATGTATCTTGTG–3′5′–ATGCCTGACTGGCTGAAAGG–3′mC/EBPβNM_0098835′–AAGCTGAGCGACGAGTACAAGA–3′5′–GTCAGCTCCAGCACCTTGTG–3′mPPARγNM_0111465′–CACAATGCCATCAGGTTTGG–3′5′–GCTGGTCGATATCACTGGAGATC–3′miPLA2-βNT_0396215′–CCTTTCCATTACGCTGTGCAA–3′5′–GACTCACGGCTTGGTTGTT–3′miPLA2-γAB_0441395′–GAGGAGAAAAAGCGTGTGCTACTT–3′5′–CTTTCCATTACGCTGTGCAA–3′ Open table in a new tab Oil Red O Staining of OP9 Cells—OP9 cells expressing siRNA-1 (control), -2, and -3 were differentiated to days 0, 2, 4, and 6. Cells were fixed for 20 min in 10% formalin. Propylene glycol (100%) was added for 15 min followed by 0.7% Oil Red O solution for 15 min. Propylene glycol (85%) was placed on cells for 15 min with agitation. Cells were rinsed in distilled water and counterstained with hematoxylin for 2 min. A tap water rinse was followed by an ammonia water rinse. Cells were viewed with a Nikon Eclipse TS100 microscope, and mages were captured with a Nikon COOLPIX5000 camera.Lipid Determination by ESI/MS—siRNA1 (control) and siRNA2 cells were washed twice with PBS and scraped into 8 ml of medium B. Cells were pelleted and washed in PBS twice. Lipids of the pelleted cells were extracted by a modified Bligh and Dyer procedure after performing protein assay on the cell homogenates as described previously (17Han X. Yang J. Cheng H. Ye H. Gross R. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 330: 317-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Lipid analyses were quantitatively performed by shotgun lipidomics based on intrasource separation and multidimensional ESI mass spectrometric array analysis as previously described (17Han X. Yang J.

Lee D. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 134-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 6Lu B. Jiang Y. Zhou Y. Xu F. Hatch G. Choy P. Biochem.

Lipid Res. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). Hydrophobicity analysis of the primary amino acid sequence following the Kyte-Doolittle algorithm (21Kyte J. Doolittle R. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16996) Google Scholar) using a window of 19 suggests 4 potential membrane-spanning regions (Fig. 1A). The predicted membrane topology for human AGPAT2 is similar to that for the murine ortholog (not shown), with which human AGPAT2 shares 77% amino acid identity (6Lu B. Jiang Y. Zhou Y. Xu F. Hatch G. Choy P. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To further characterize the AGPAT2 protein, we expressed HA epitope-tagged AGPAT2 in wild-type CHO cells to determine whether the protein is membrane-associated. Western blot analysis shows that AGPAT2 associates with the membrane fraction in the absence of detergent and is associated with the alkaline-inextractable microsomal fraction (Fig. 1B), suggesting that AGPAT2 is an integral membrane protein. Immunofluorescence studies show a high degree of co-localization with the resident ER luminal protein BiP (Fig. 1C), consistent with the previously reported association with the microsomal fraction (22Leung D. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: d944-d953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To demonstrate the lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase activity of AGPAT2, AGPAT2-HA was expressed in CHO cells and the transacylation of LPA was assayed by monitoring conversion LPA to PA. We found that acyltransferase activity was increased 5-fold in CHO cells overexpressing AGPAT2 as compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 1D). Thus, AGPAT2 is a resident ER protein that catalyzes the conversion of LPA to PA.Induction of AGPAT2 during Adipocyte Differentiation—Because mutations in AGPAT2 are associated with human lipodystrophy, we hypothesized that AGPAT2 may play a central role either in regulation or maintenance of adipocyte differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we first examined AGPAT2 expression during adipocyte differentiation. For these studies we used the murine OP9 cell line (23Kitajima K. Tanaka M. Zheng J. Sakai-Ogawa E. Nakano T. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 365: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Umeda K. Heike T. Yoshimoto M. Shiota M. Suemori H. Luo H. Chui D. Torii R. Shibuya M. Nakatsuji N. Nakahata T. Development. 2004; 131: 1869-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), which differentiates into mature adipocytes in response to IBMX, dexamethasone, and insulin (25Wolins N. Quaynor B. Skinner J. Tzekov A. Park C. Choi K. Bickel P. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 450-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis in parental OP9 cells and adipocytes stably transfected with the control (i.e. scrambled) siRNA (siRNA-1) showed that AGPAT2 expression was induced early in differentiation (day 2) and persisted in the mature adipocyte (Fig. 2A). By contrast, stable siRNA expression (siRNA-2 and siRNA-3) prevented the early induction of AGPAT2 expression and markedly reduced expression throughout the differentiation period. Quantification of the AGPAT2 gene expression in siRNA-1-transfected adipocytes demonstrated a nearly 30-fold induction in mRNA expression, which was suppressed by up to 91% (day 2) and 63% (day 4) in adipocytes with stable knockdown of AGPAT2 (siRNA-2 and siRNA-3) (Fig. 2B). Acyltransferase activity, which was increased 2-fold in the adipocytes, was significantly reduced in cells with knockdown of AGPAT2 expression (siRNA-2 and siRNA-3), as compared with control siRNA (siRNA-1) (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2siRNA targeting of AGPAT2 in OP9 cells. A, Northern analysis from parental and siRNA-treated OP9 cells at various days of differentiation is shown using 32P-labeled probe complementary to AGPAT2 coding region (upper panel). 18 S RNA is shown as a loading control (lower panel). For each day of differentiation, samples include parental OP9 cells (WT), OP9s stably transfected with a scrambled control siRNA (siRNA1), and OP9s stably transfected with siRNAs that specifically target AGPAT2 (siRNA2 and siRNA3).

Among the AGPAT isoforms, we observed that AGPAT2 shows the greatest-fold induction during differentiation. We further found that AGPAT2 knockdown blunted expression of the other AGPAT isoforms (Fig. 3), suggesting that AGPAT2 activity is required for induction of these isoforms during differentiation. The decreased expression of these AGPATs is unlikely due to “off-target” effects, because neither of the siRNA sequences directed against AGPAT2 share greater than a 53% identity with the nucleotide sequences of any of the other AGPAT isoforms. These knockdown studies demonstrate that AGPAT2 is responsible for a significant portion of the acyltransferase activity present in mature adipocytes, either directly or indirectly through regulation of expression of other AGPAT isoforms.FIGURE 3Expression of AGPAT isoforms in OP9 cells with AGPAT2 knockdown.

Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) from HeLa cells was shown, by mass spectrometry and Edman degradation, to contain asymmetric NG,NG-dimethylarginine at five positions in its amino acid sequence (Arg256, Arg258, Arg268, Arg296, and Arg299). Whereas these five residues were quantitatively modified, Arg303 was asymmetrically dimethylated in <33% of hnRNP K and Arg287 was monomethylated in <10% of the protein. All other arginine residues were unmethylated. Protein-arginine methyltransferase 1 was identified as the only enzyme methylating hnRNP K in vitro and in vivo. An hnRNP K variant in which the five quantitatively modified arginine residues had been substituted was not methylated. Methylation of arginine residues by protein-arginine methyltransferase 1 did not influence the RNA-binding activity, the translation inhibitory function, or the cellular localization of hnRNP K but reduced the interaction of hnRNP K with the tyrosine kinase c-Src. This led to an inhibition of c-Src activation and hnRNP K phosphorylation. These findings support the role of arginine methylation in the regulation of protein-protein interactions.

Chem. 2004; 279: 48774-48779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) contain regions with clustered arginine residues in Arg-Gly-Gly motifs (RGG box) or RG repeats. These arginine residues are typically asymmetrically dimethylated. In addition, asymmetric arginine dimethylation has also been found in clustered RXR motifs (40Smith J.J. Rücknagel K.P. Schierhorn A. Tang J. Nemeth A. Linder M. Herschman H.R. Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13229-13234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and other sequences. Therefore, the prediction of a methylated arginine is difficult. Furthermore, the enzyme responsible for the dimethylation of a particular protein is unknown in many cases, and the substrate specificities of the different methyltransferases remain poorly characterized. The exact knowledge of the methylated arginine residues and their quantitative distribution as well as the identification of the relevant methyltransferases is a prerequisite for the functional analysis of arginine methylation. HnRNP K belongs to the family of heterogeneous nuclear RNPs that participate in the processing of pre-mRNAs and in the export of mRNAs from the nucleus. An N-terminal bipartite nuclear-localization signal and an hnRNP K-specific nuclear shuttling signal confer the capacity for bi-directional transport across the nuclear envelop (41Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 42Michael W.M. Eder P.S. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3587-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic accumulation of hnRNP K is mediated by its Erk-dependent serine phosphorylation (43Habelhah H. Shah K. Huang L. Ostareck-Lederer A. Burlingame A.L. Shokat K.M. Hentze M.W. Ronai Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm hnRNP K functions in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. For example, hnRNP K, together with hnRNP E1 and hnRNP E2, regulates human papilloma virus type 16 L2 capsid protein synthesis in the course of cellular differentiation by binding to the L2 mRNA 3′-untranslated region (44Collier B. Goobar-Larsson L. Sokolowski M. Schwartz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22648-22656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Binding of hnRNP K, hnRNP E1, and hnRNP E2 to the internal ribosome entry site of the c-myc mRNA enhances the translation of the c-myc proto-oncogene (45Evans J.R. Mitchell S.A. Spriggs K.A. Ostrowski J. Bomsztyk K. Ostareck D.H. Willis A.E. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8012-8020Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Furthermore, hnRNP K is involved in the regulation of reticulocyte 15-lipoxygenase (r15-LOX) mRNA translation. r15-LOX, a key enzyme in erythroid cell differentiation, participates in the breakdown of mitochondria in mature reticulocytes, which is a prerequisite for erythrocyte formation. Its premature expression in erythroid precursor cells is temporally restricted by translational silencing, mediated by hnRNP K and hnRNP E1 binding, individually or together, to the differentiation control element (DICE) in the r15-LOX mRNA 3′-untranslated region. The hnRNP K/E1-DICE complex blocks 80 S ribosome assembly (46Ostareck D.H. Ostareck-Lederer A. Wilm M. Thiele B.J. Mann M. Hentze M.W.

Cell. 2001; 104: 281-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The silencing mechanism can be recapitulated in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysate or wheat germ extract and in transfected HeLa cells (46Ostareck D.H. Ostareck-Lederer A. Wilm M. Thiele B.J. Mann M. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 597-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 47Ostareck D.H. Ostareck-Lederer A. Shatsky I.N. Hentze M.W. Cell. 2001; 104: 281-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Interestingly, hnRNP K has been found to bind and to activate the tyrosine kinase c-Src specifically. Activated c-Src, in turn, phosphorylates hnRNP K, which leads to an inhibition of its DICE-binding activity and abolishes inhibition of mRNA translation by hnRNP K. In contrast, hnRNP E1 is neither an activator nor a substrate of c-Src (48Ostareck-Lederer A. Ostareck D.H. Cans C. Neubauer G. Bomsztyk K. Superti-Furga G. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4535-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). HnRNP K contains three proline-rich domains, allowing an interaction with the Src homology domain 3 (SH3) of c-Src (49Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Nature. 1994; 368: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 50Van Seuningen I. Ostrowski J. Bustelo X.R. Sleath P.R. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol.

Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4509-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In addition, hnRNP K bears five clustered Arg-Gly-Gly (RGG) motifs within the proline-rich domains (52Matunis M.J. Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). HnRNP K, like other hnRNP proteins, is methylated in HeLa cells and lymphoblastoid cells (53Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2800-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 54Huang H.M. Tam M.F. Tam T.C.S. Chen D.H. Hsieh M. Li C. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), but neither the methylation sites nor the specific methyltransferase or the functional significance of arginine methylation are known. In this report, we have identified the methylated arginine residues in hnRNP K by mass spectrometry and Edman sequencing and quantitatively determined the methylation state. We provide biochemical and genetic evidence that PRMT1 is the only methyltransferase that methylates hnRNP K in vitro and in vivo. An hnRNP K variant in which all completely modified arginines were substituted is neither methylated by recombinant PRMT1 nor in HeLa cells. Methylation of arginine residues in hnRNP K did not influence its DICE-binding activity, its translation inhibitory function, or its cellular localization, but reduced its interaction with c-Src. This led to an inhibition of hnRNP K-dependent c-Src activation and a reduced hnRNP K phosphorylation. Plasmids—pET16b-hnRNP K and pET16b-hnRNP E1 have been described in Ref. 46Ostareck D.H.

CopA from Archaeoglobus fulgidus is a hyperthermophilic ATPase responsible for the cellular export of Cu+ and is a member of the heavy metal P1B-type ATPase subfamily, which includes the related Wilson and Menkes diseases proteins. The Cu+-ATPases are distinct from their P-type counter-parts in ion binding sequences, membrane topology, and the presence of cytoplasmic metal binding domains, suggesting that they employ alternate forms of regulation and novel mechanisms of ion transport. To gain insight into Cu+-ATPase function, the structure of the CopA ATP binding domain (ATPBD) was determined to 2.3 Å resolution. Similar to other P-type ATPases, the ATPBD includes nucleotide binding (N-domain) and phosphorylation (P-domain) domains. The ATPBD adopts a closed conformation similar to the nucleotide-bound forms of the Ca2+-ATPase. The CopA ATPBD is much smaller and more compact, however, revealing the minimal elements required for ATP binding, hydrolysis, and enzyme phosphorylation. Structural comparisons to the AMP-PMP-bound form of the Escherichia coli K+-transporting Kdp-ATPase and to the Wilson disease protein N-domain indicate that the five conserved N-domain residues found in P1B-type ATPases, but not in the other families, most likely participate in ATP binding. By contrast, the P-domain includes several residues conserved among all P-type ATPases. Finally, the CopA ATPBD structure provides a basis for understanding the likely structural and functional effects of various mutations that lead to Wilson and Menkes diseases.

Finally, the CopA ATPBD structure provides a basis for understanding the likely structural and functional effects of various mutations that lead to Wilson and Menkes diseases. The P-type ATPases encompass a large family of integral membrane proteins that couple ATP hydrolysis with the transport of cations across cell membranes (1Pedersen P.L. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem.

The importance of these enzymes for metal homeostasis is underscored by the two Cu+-ATPases present in humans, ATP7A (MNK) and ATP7B (WND) (7Bull P.C. Cox D.W.

Mutations in the genes encoding the ATP7A and ATP7B proteins lead to Menkes and Wilson diseases, respectively. Menkes disease is characterized by impaired transport of dietary copper across the small intestine, resulting in a copper deficiency in peripheral tissues. Improper function of WND leads to toxic copper accumulation in the liver because of reduced biliary excretion (10Lutsenko S. Tsivkovskii R. Walker J.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Although all P-type ATPases share essential structural elements, the subgroups differ in the number of predicted transmembrane helices and the arrangement of these segments with respect to the cytoplasmic ATP binding domain (ATPBD). 4The abbreviations used are: ATPBD, ATP binding domain; A-domain, actuator domain; AMP-PCP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylene)triphosphate; N-MBD, N-terminal metal binding domain; KdpB, potassium-transporting ATPase B chain; P-domain, phosphorylation domain; SERCA1, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase; MOPS, 3-[N-morpholino]propanesulfonic acid. 4The abbreviations used are: ATPBD, ATP binding domain; A-domain, actuator domain; AMP-PCP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylene)triphosphate; N-MBD, N-terminal metal binding domain; KdpB, potassium-transporting ATPase B chain; P-domain, phosphorylation domain; SERCA1, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase; MOPS, 3-[N-morpholino]propanesulfonic acid. In addition, the soluble regions vary in length and composition (4Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 5Solioz M. Vulpe C.

The P1B-type ATPases comprise eight transmembrane helices, a large ATPBD, an actuator domain (A-domain), and N- or C-terminal soluble metal binding domains (MBDs). Binding sites responsible for metal coordination during transport are located within the membrane and are believed to involve a CPX sequence motif as well as other key residues that confer metal ion selectivity (3Argüello J.M.

The N-terminal MBDs (N-MBDs), ranging from one to six depending on the organism, receive copper ions from metallochaperones (14Rosenzweig A.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), participate in ATPase regulation (15Mandal A.K. Arguello J.M.

The P1B-type ATPase transport mechanism follows the classical Post-Albers E1/E2 model (7Bull P.C. Cox D.W.

The central element of this catalytic cycle is the coupling of metal transport to enzyme phosphorylation by ATP. Phosphorylation of the aspartic acid residue from the signature sequence DKTGT is the unifying characteristic of all P-type ATPases (1Pedersen P.L. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem.

The ATP binding, hydrolysis, and enzyme phosphorylation steps occur within the ATPBD, which consists of a phosphorylation domain (P-domain) and a nucleotide binding domain (N-domain).

These cytoplasmic fragments are able to bind nucleotides and hydrolyze ATP, albeit at a low rate, and thus contain the key components needed for energy dependent ion transport by these ATPases. With the exception of solution structures of N-MBDs (23Gitschier J. Moffat B. Reilly D. Wood W.I. Fairbrother W.J. Nat. Struct.

Several structures of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA1) Ca2+-ATPase have been reported recently (25Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar, 26Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 27Toyoshima C. Mizutani T.

Because of significant architectural differences between heavy metal transporting and P2-type ATPases, homology modeling based on the SERCA1 structures is of limited utility in understanding P1B-type ATPase function and transport mechanisms at the molecular level. We have determined the 2.3 Å resolution crystal structure of the ATPBD from CopA from the hyperthermophile Archaeoglobus fulgidus, a well characterized Cu+-ATPases that contains all of the key elements present in eukaryotic Cu+-ATPase (13Mandal A.K.

The CopA ATPBD structure, because of its small size and compactness, constitutes a minimal ATP binding-phosphorylation unit. As such, the structure allows for the identification of the central catalytic features independently of the secondary structural elements likely associated with trafficking, targeting, and regulatory functions. Cloning of the CopA ATPBD—The CopA ATPBD (residues Lys407-Lys671) was PCR-amplified from CopA cDNA (30Mandal A.K. Cheung W.D. Argüello J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7201-7208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) by using the primers 5′-GCCCTTGGTCTCTAATGAAAAATGCCGACGCTCTCGAA-3′ and 5′-CGGGAAGGTCTCTGCGCTTTTGCTCATGGTCTTTCTGCT-3′, which introduce a Bsa1 restriction site at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the PCR product. The PCR product was digested with Bsa1 and cloned into the pPR-IBA1vector (IBA), which introduces an 8-amino-acid (WSHPQFEK) streptactin tag at the C terminus of the protein. The accuracy of the insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing. BL21Star(DE3)pLysS Escherichia coli cells carrying the plasmid pSJS1240 encoding for rare tRNAs (tRNAargAGA/AGG and tRNAileAUA) (31Kim B.-E. Smith K. Meagher C.K. Petris M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44079-44084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) were transformed with the pATPBD construct. Expression and Purification of the CopA ATPBD—E. coli cells containing the pATPBD plasmid were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin and 30 mg/liter chloramphenicol. ATPBD expression was induced with 250 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at an A600 of 0.7. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 5 min 3-4 h after induction. The pellet was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. For purification, the frozen cells were resuspended in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl (Buffer W), to which DNase, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were added. The cell suspension was sonicated for 10 min (30-s pulses with a 30-s rest) and centrifuged at 163,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was then loaded onto a 10-ml streptactin column (IBA) conditioned in buffer W, and the ATPBD was purified according to the manufacturer's protocol. SDS-PAGE of the eluted protein indicated it was greater than 95% pure. The ATPBD was exchanged into 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 20 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol by several concentration and dilution steps using an Amicon Ultra YM-10 concentrator, frozen at 30 mg/ml in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. This protocol yielded ∼15 mg of protein/liter of medium. The protein concentration was estimated by using the theoretical extinction coefficient, ϵ280 = 11,400 cm-1 m-1, and a molecular mass of 29.6 kDa. A selenomethionine derivative of the CopA-ATPBD was prepared using LeMaster's medium (32LeMaster D.M. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7263-7268Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and purified as described above. ATPase Activity—Activity assays were carried out at 70 °C for 20 min in a 500-μl solution containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, and ± 20 μm ATPBD. The reaction was stopped by quickly cooling the solution to 4 °C. The free phosphate concentration was measured at room temperature by using the EnzChek phosphate assay kit (Molecular Probes). The ATPBD had an activity of 4.2 nmol Pi/mg/min. Background activity (ATP hydrolysis in the absence of protein) was less than 50% in all of our determinations. Crystallization—Both wild-type and selenomethionine CopA-ATPBD were diluted to 10 mg/ml with a 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 20 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol solution and crystallized by using the hanging drop method at room temperature (22-24 °C). Equal volumes of protein and a precipitant solution containing 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6, 5-8% polyethylene glycol 4000, and 10-20% glycerol were combined. Large rectangular crystals grew within 2-3 days. Prior to data collection, the ATPBD crystals were quickly exchanged into a cryosolvent comprising 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6, 5% polyethylene glycol 4000, and 25% glycerol and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data Collection and Structure Determination—A SAD data set was collected at 100 K at the sector 32 beamline at the Advanced Photon Source (see Table 1). The crystals diffracted to 2.3 Å resolution, belong to the space group P31, and have unit cell dimensions of a = b = 80.78 Å and c = 105.96 Å. The data sets were integrated by using MOSFLM (33Powell H.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 1690-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and scaled with SCALA (34Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

CNS yielded the most interpretable electron density maps after density modification. The three ATPBDs comprising the asymmetric unit were built using XtalView (37McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar), and the model was refined with CNS (Table 1). Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were imposed throughout the refinement. Most of the residues in the three asymmetric units were observed in the electron density maps except for residues 407-410 at the N terminus, 670-671 at the C terminus, and 637-645 in the P-domain.

This isolated domain was able to bind and hydrolyze ATP at a measurable rate (4.2 nmol Pi/mg/min) when incubated at 70 °C, the growth temperature of the source organism. The A. fulgidus ATPBD exhibits a kidney bean-like topology with a cleft for ATP binding at the interface between the N- and P-domains (Fig. 1a). Two 5-6-amino-acid loops (residues 429-434 between β1 and β2 and residues 547-552 between β7 and α6) form a hinge region connecting the N- and P-domains. Notably, the CopA ATPBD adopts a closed conformation similar to the SERCA1 structures with bound AMP-PCP or AlF4- and ADP, which both mimic the E1P-ADP state of the protein (27Toyoshima C. Mizutani T. Nature. 2004; 430: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 29Sørensen T. L.-M. Møller J.V. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 304: 1672-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1b). This closed conformation is characterized by a quasiparallel orientation of helices α5 and α7, similar to helices α7 and α10 in the nucleotide-bound SERCA1 structures (Fig. 1b). By contrast, these helices adopt a perpendicular orientation in the open forms of P2-type ATPases (25Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1c). Among the different P-type ATPases, and within the specific P1, P1B, and P2 subfamilies, there is little sequence conservation in these helices (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S1). Nevertheless, mutations in the corresponding MNK and WND helices are known to lead to Wilson and Menkes diseases (Fig. 2) (40Cox D.W. Moore S.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2002; 34: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A crystal structure with a nucleotide analogue bound to the CopA ATPBD could not be obtained despite several cocrystallization and soaking efforts. The ATPBD may be locked in this closed state either by the crystallization conditions or by intrinsic interactions that confer thermostability to CopA.FIGURE 2Sequence alignment of the ATPBDs from WND, MNK, and CopA.

Residues highlighted in green are conserved among the different P-type ATPase families, whereas residues highlighted in blue are conserved only among P1B-type ATPases (alignment not shown).

Several highly conserved residues are present in the hinge region. These include Thr430 and Asp548, which appear to be universally conserved among all ATPases, and Gly432, which is conserved only among the P1B family members. The Thr430 and Asp548 side chains interact via hydrogen bonding. In addition, the Gly432 amide nitrogen interacts weakly with the Asp548 side chain. A similar pattern is observed in SERCA1 (supplemental Fig. S2) (25Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar, 26Toyoshima C.

Science. 2004; 304: 1672-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). These interactions may be critical for stabilizing the conformation of the phosphorylation loop (D424KTGT), which is just upstream of Thr430 in the P-domain, and are the focal point about which the hinge flexes. In support of a key role for these residues, mutations in Thr430 and Gly432 in WND are linked to disease states (Fig. 2) (40Cox D.W. Moore S.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2002; 34: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The N-domain—The N-domain consists of a six stranded anti-parallel β-sheet sandwiched between two α-helices on each side of the sheet (Fig. 3a). Structures of N-domains from SERCA1 (25Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar), the Na+,K+-ATPase (41HÅkansson K.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 1175-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the Kdp-ATPase (KdpB) (42Haupt M. Bramkamp M. Coles M. Altendorf K. Kessler H. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 1547-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and more recently WND, 5O. Dmitriev, R. Tsivkovskii, F. Abildgaard, C. T. Morgan, J. L. Markley, and S. Lutsenko, in press. all exhibit this overall fold despite a lack of sequence homology (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. S1). Moreover, SERCA1, the Na+/K+-ATPase, and WND differ significantly from CopA in that their sequences include several insertions ranging from 10 to 60 residues in length. The WND N-domain has an unstructured 39-amino-acid loop between β4 and β5 that extends into the cytosol away from the N-domain (Fig. 3, b and c). This loop, which spans 56 amino acids in MNK, is not essential for catalysis5 and comprises just four residues in CopA. The MNK and WND loops do not bear any sequence resemblance to each other, suggesting that these elements may specifically target the two proteins to different cellular compartments. Like WND, the Ca2+ and Na+,K+-ATPases have additional loops and structural elements, such as a seventh strand on the β-sheet (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). Some of these inserts in SERCA1 participate in interactions with the A-domain (25Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar, 26Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 27Toyoshima C. Mizutani T. Nature. 2004; 430: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 28Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; : 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 29Sørensen T. L.-M. Møller J.V. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 304: 1672-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The additional structural elements found in the various P-type ATPases may therefore be specific for their function and help to promote domain-domain interactions as well as proper cellular localization. The CopA N-domain is quite similar to the KdpB N-domain with bound AMP-PNP. There are no extra insertions in the KdpB sequence, and the root mean square deviation for Cα atoms between KdpB and CopA is 1.54 Å (Fig. 3d). When KdpB is superimposed onto CopA, the adenine and ribose rings of the ATP analogue fit well within a conserved pocket (Fig. 3e). Sequence analysis of the different P1B-type ATPase N-domains reveals that five amino acids, Glu457, His462, Gly490, Gly492, and Gly501, are universally conserved (Fig. 2).5 All of these residues are predicted to interact with the docked nucleotide in CopA on the basis of the superimposed KdpB structure. Residues Glu457, His462, and Gly492 may function to orient and bind the adenine ring through hydrogen bonding, whereas Gly490 and Gly501 likely interact primarily with the ribose moiety and α-phosphate. Mutagenesis and NMR studies on WND (44Tsivkovskii R. Efremov R.G. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13302-13308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar)5 and the E. coli Zn2+-transporting P1B-type ATPase ZntA (45Okkeri J. Laakkonen L. Haltia T. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 95-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are consistent with a role for these residues in ATP binding. Interestingly, none of these residues are conserved in the other ATPase families, and each family appears to preserve its own set of residues specific for ATP binding. For example, in KdpB (42Haupt M. Bramkamp M. Coles M. Altendorf K. Kessler H. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 1547-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and SERCA1 (27Toyoshima C. Mizutani T. Nature. 2004; 430: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 29Sørensen T. L.-M. Møller J.V. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 304: 1672-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), a phenylalanine residue on the strand equivalent to β3 forms π-stacking interactions with the adenine ring. In the model of nucleotide-bound CopA, His462 is not positioned properly for strong contacts with the adenine ring (Fig. 3e). Given the morphology of the adenine-binding cleft, the adenine may form better interactions with His462 and Glu457 by rotating 90° with respect to its position in KdpB. Further movement of the S460EHP loop between α2 and α3 may also facilitate interaction. The WND N-domain structure, which was determined with bound ATP, differs from CopA in that α2 has rotated by ∼30° to form a different set of interactions with the β-sheet (Fig. 3c). As a result, the position of the SEHP loop changes and α3 rotates by ∼10°. These differences may be related to interdomain regulatory interactions associated with the multiple MBDs present in eukaryotic proteins. It has been demonstrated that the first four MBDs of WND interact with the N-domain and that this interaction modulates ATP affinity (17Tsivkovskii R. MacArthur B. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2234-2242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 44Tsivkovskii R. Efremov R.G. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13302-13308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). CopA, which requires only one MBD for maximum activity (15Mandal A.K. Arguello J.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11040-11047Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), may function in a slightly different fashion. Because the N-domain in the full-length ATPase is likely to participate in domain-domain interactions required for catalysis, movement of the SEHP loop is likely to be important for protein function. The P-domain—The P-domain comprises a six-stranded parallel β-sheet sandwiched between six α-helices, three on each side of the sheet (Fig. 4a). The SERCA1 P-domain, which is the only other known structure of a P-domain, has a similar fold (root mean square deviation for Cα atoms = 1.7 Å) with the exception of a 50-amino-acid insert between α10 and β14 (Fig. 4, b and c). In CopA, both the invariant D424KTGT and T572GD loops are positioned in the back of the ATPBD crevice near the hinge region (Fig. 1a). These loops, which are critical for enzyme phosphorylation during catalysis, adopt similar conformations to those observed in the different SERCA1 structures (Fig. 4, c and d) (25Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar, 26Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 27Toyoshima C. Mizutani T. Nature. 2004; 430: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 28Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; : 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 29Sørensen T. L.-M. Møller J.V. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 304: 1672-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The loop between β10 and α9 containing the sequence A614XXGDGXND rests at the edge of the crevice marking the interface between the N- and P-domains. In the SERCA1 structures, the equivalent loop interacts with the A-domain and adopts different orientations. Finally, residues 637-645, for which no electron density was observed, would be located on a loop between β11 and β12 far from the phosphorylation site on the protein exterior (Figs. 1a and 4a). The analogous region in SERCA1 forms a small helix (Fig. 1b) and interacts with the A-domain in several different ways depending upon conformation of SERCA1. This loop in CopA would likely become more ordered in the presence of other cytosolic domains. The similarities in the core fold of the P-domain are not surprising considering that the majority of the conserved residues among the different P-type ATPase ATPBDs are located in this domain (Figs. 2, 4d, and supplemental Fig. S1). Conserved residues are clustered in the loops facing the ATP binding site of the N-domain. A superimposition of the CopA P-domain with the AlF4- and ADP-bound form of SERCA1 (Fig. 4d) suggests that CopA residues Asp424, Thr426, Thr572, Gly573, Asn621 probably interact with the β- and γ-phosphates, Asp424 and Asp618 likely coordinate Mg2+, and Asp574 hydrogen bonds to the nucleotide ribose moiety. The remaining conserved residues likely participate in second coordination sphere hydrogen bonding or serve a specific structural role to preserve the active site geometry. Domain Interactions—In P-type ATPases, transmembrane ion transport is coupled to ATP hydrolysis via key structural and conformational changes (1Pedersen P.L. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 146-150Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 2Møller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). These various movements include transient domain-domain interactions such as those described for the P- and N-domains of P2-type ATPases (25Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar, 26Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 27Toyoshima C. Mizutani T. Nature. 2004; 430: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 28Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; : 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Electrostatic surface maps of the CopA ATPBD (Fig. 5a) do not reveal any obvious patches of positive or negative charge suggestive of a domain interaction site. Comparisons to the SERCA1 structures provide some insight into potential interaction surfaces, however. Mapping the known A-domain interaction sites in SERCA1 (28Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; : 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) onto the surface of the CopA ATPBD identifies specific parts of the P-domain as likely to interact with the A-domain (Fig. 5, b and c). These sites correspond to the slightly positively charged surface at the crest of the P-domain ATP-binding cleft (Fig. 5a). Notably, interactions between the A-domain and the N-domain in the SERCA1 structures (26Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 27Toyoshima C. Mizutani T. Nature. 2004; 430: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 28Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; : 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 29Sørensen T. L.-M. Møller J.V. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 304: 1672-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) involve regions of secondary structure not present in P1B-ATPases. This observation does not preclude possible interactions between the A- and N-domains in CopA but could be related to the additional requirement for metal-dependant interactions between the N-MBDs and the ATPBD (17Tsivkovskii R. MacArthur B. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2234-2242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 44Tsivkovskii R. Efremov R.G. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13302-13308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and between the N-MBDs and metallochaperones (46Walker J.M. Tsivkovskii R. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Structural Significance of WND and MNK Mutations—A number of mutations in the ATPBDs of WND and MNK have been identified in Wilson and Menkes diseases patients (Fig. 2) (40Cox D.W. Moore S.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2002; 34: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The structure of the CopA ATPBD provides new insight into the probable effects of these mutations on enzyme function. For example, mutations T1031S, T1033A, G1035V, and R1038K occur in the WND hinge region and are predicted to alter P- and N-domain movement. Other mutations might affect ligand binding by direct participation in ligand-protein interactions or by proximity to interacting residues. These mutations not only include the well characterized mutations in the SEHP region like H1069Q but also the I1102T, C1104F, I1148T, and R1151H WND mutations that probably affect the positions of glycines interacting with the nucleotide. A similar case can be made for mutations that involve the phosphate binding site in the P-domain, like T1220M, D1222N, D1267A, and N1270S in WND. Finally, several mutations occur in regions not directly involved in ligand interaction or conformational changes. In WND, these mutations include L1043P, L1083P, T1232P, V1252I, and D1296N. Such mutations may affect the folding and stability of the protein. In sum, the CopA ATPBD structure reveals the key components required for ATP binding and hydrolysis by P1B-type ATPases. The overall fold, which resembles that observed in P2-type ATPases, represents the basic scaffold capable of performing key steps in the classical P-type ATPase E1/E2 mechanism. The structure additionally serves as a basis to explore domain-domain interactions specific to heavy metal transport. Finally, the CopA ATPBD structure provides a new framework for the structural analysis of the many mutations leading to Wilson and Menkes diseases.

https://openalex.org/W1976040259,"Aneuploidy is a key process in tumorigenesis. Dysfunction of the mitotic spindle checkpoint proteins has been implicated as a cause of aneuploidy in cells. We have previously reported that FAT10, a member of the ubiquitin-like modifier family of proteins, is overexpressed in several gastrointestinal and gynecological cancers. Here we show that FAT10 interacts with MAD2, a spindle checkpoint protein, during mitosis. Notably, we show that localization of MAD2 at the kinetochore during the prometaphase stage of the cell cycle was greatly reduced in FAT10-overexpressing cells. Furthermore, compared with parental HCT116 cells, fewer mitotic cells were observed after double thymidine-synchronized FAT10-overexpressing cells were released into nocodazole for more than 4 h. Nonetheless, when these double thymidine-treated cells were released into media, a similar number of G1 parental and FAT10-overexpressing HCT116 cells was observed throughout the 10-h time course. Additionally, more nocodazole-treated FAT10-overexpressing cells escape mitotic controls and are multinucleate compared with parental cells. Significantly, we observed a higher degree of variability in chromosome number in cells overexpressing FAT10. Hence, our data suggest that high levels of FAT10 protein in cells lead to increased mitotic nondisjunction and chromosome instability, and this effect is mediated by an abbreviated mitotic phase and the reduction in the kinetochore localization of MAD2 during the prometaphase stage of the cell cycle.

Genetic instability is an important phenomenon that underlies tumorigenesis. Chromosome instability (CIN) 2The abbreviations used are: CIN, chromosome instability; UBL, ubiquitin-like modifier; CMV, cytomegalovirus; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; MPM2, mitotic protein monoclonal 2 (anti-phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro). involving gains and loss of chromosomes has been found to occur in most malignancies, whereas microsatellite instability, which occurs at the nucleotide level, is less commonly observed in cancers (1Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1998; 396: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (3405) Google Scholar). Two forms of CIN, namely structural instability and numerical instability (aneuploidy), can be observed in various tumors. Genes responsible for CIN in human cancers include those involved in the condensation of chromosomes, cohesion of sister chromatids, formation of microtubules, and kinetochore structure and function as well as mitotic “checkpoint” genes that monitor the proper progression through the cell cycle (1Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1998; 396: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (3405) Google Scholar, 2Nowak M.A. Komarova N.L. Sengupta A. Jallepalli P.V. Shih Ie M. Vogelstein B. Lengauer C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16226-16231Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). MAD2 (mitotic arrest-deficient 2) is a key mitotic spindle checkpoint protein whose primary role is to ensure that all of the chromosomes are properly attached to the mitotic spindle before the onset of anaphase (3Li Y. Benezra R. Science. 1996; 274: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). It is activated by associating with unattached kinetochores. Activated MAD2 binds to Cdc20 and prevents the anaphase-promoting complex from ubiquitylating securin. As a result, anaphase is delayed until all of the kinetochores are attached by microtubules and the chromosomes are properly aligned along the metaphase plate (4Yu H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 706-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 5Shah J.V. Cleveland D.W. Cell. 2000; 103: 997-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 6Musacchio A. Hardwick K.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). MAD2 is an essential gene, and MAD2-/- mice die in utero (7Dobles M. Liberal V. Scott M.L. Benezra R. Sorger P.K. Cell. 2000; 101: 635-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Loss of one allele of MAD2 has been reported to result in premature anaphase and CIN in mammalian cells (8Michel L.S. Liberal V. Chatterjee A. Kirchwegger R. Pasche B. Gerald W. Dobles M. Sorger P.K. Murty V.V. Benezra R. Nature. 2001; 409: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Dysregulation of MAD2 has been implicated in various cancers. Reduced expression of MAD2 associated with loss of mitotic checkpoint control was observed in ovarian cancer cells (9Wang X. Jin D.Y. Ng R.W. Feng H. Wong Y.C. Cheung A.L. Tsao S.W. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1662-1668PubMed Google Scholar), breast cancer cells (3Li Y. Benezra R. Science. 1996; 274: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), and nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells (10Wang X. Jin D.Y. Wong Y.C. Cheung A.L. Chun A.C. Lo A.K. Liu Y. Tsao S.W. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 2293-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MAD2 has been reported to be overexpressed in colorectal (11Li G.Q. Li H. Zhang H.F. World J. Gastroenterol. 2003; 9: 1972-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and gastric (12Tanaka K. Nishioka J. Kato K. Nakamura A. Mouri T. Miki C. Kusunoki M. Nobori T. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 2001; 92: 952-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) cancers. Nonetheless, mutations of MAD2 are infrequent in bladder tumors, soft tissue carcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas (13Hernando E. Orlow I. Liberal V. Nohales G. Benezra R. Cordon-Cardo C. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 95: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), lung cancer, and breast cancer (14Gemma A. Hosoya Y. Seike M. Uematsu K. Kurimoto F. Hibino S. Yoshimura A. Shibuya M. Kudoh S. Emi M. Lung Cancer. 2001; 32: 289-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recently, it was demonstrated that the deregulation of the Rb pathway leads to abberant overexpression of MAD2, which then contributes to mitotic alterations and chromosome instability (15Hernando E. Nahle Z. Juan G. Diaz-Rodriguez E. Alaminos M. Hemann M. Michel L. Mittal V. Gerald W. Benezra R. Lowe S.W. Cordon-Cardo C. Nature. 2004; 430: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Aberrant interaction of MAD2 with other proteins may also deregulate the checkpoint function of MAD2. For example, overexpression of CMT2 (caught by MAD2), which is capable of binding to MAD2, induces premature entry into anaphase without chromosome segregation (16Habu T. Kim S.H. Weinstein J. Matsumoto T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6419-6428Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). FAT10 is another protein that was identified using the yeast two-hybrid system to noncovalently associate with MAD2 (17Liu Y.C. Pan J. Zhang C. Fan W. Collinge M. Bender J.R. Weissman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4313-4318Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Also known as diubiquitin, FAT10 is an 18-kDa protein containing 165 amino acid residues. It comprises two tandem ubiquitin-like domains and belongs to the ubiquitin-like modifier (UBL) family of proteins (18Jentsch S. Pyrowolakis G. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 335-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Its N and C termini are 29 and 36% identical to the corresponding segments of ubiquitin. Similar to ubiquitin, it contains the C terminus Gly-Gly residues that are important for conjugating to other proteins as well as the conserved Lys residue, which may serve as a potential site for polyubiquitination. Recently, it was reported that FAT10 degradation is accelerated by its interaction with NEDD8 (neural precursor cell-expressed, developmentally down-regulated 8) ultimate buster-1L (19Hipp M.S. Raasi S. Groettrup M. Schmidtke G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16503-16510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Additionally, the degradation of FAT10 and its conjugates were also found to be ubiquitin-independent (20Hipp M.S. Kalveram B. Raasi S. Groettrup M. Schmidtke G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3483-3491Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). FAT10 was observed to be up-regulated in human fetal cells from pregnancies affected with Trisomy 21 (21FitzPatrick D.R. Ramsay J. McGill N.I. Shade M. Carothers A.D. Hastie N.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3249-3256Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Its role in tumorigenesis is suggested by its ability to be up-regulated by the inflammatory molecule, tumor necrosis factor α (22Raasi S. Schmidtke G. de Giuli R. Groettrup M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 4030-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), a presumptive tumor promoter (23Young L.S. Murray P.G. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5108-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 24Szlosarek P.W. Balkwill F.R. Lancet Oncol. 2003; 4: 565-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). We recently reported that FAT10 expression is up-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma and other gastrointestinal and gynecological cancers (25Lee C.G. Ren J. Cheong I.S. Ban K.H. Ooi L.L. Yong Tan S. Kan A. Nuchprayoon I. Jin R. Lee K.H. Choti M. Lee L.A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2592-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that FAT10 interacts with MAD2, but only during mitosis. We also demonstrate that the kinetochore localization of MAD2 is reduced in FAT10-overexpressing cells. Furthermore, overexpression of FAT10 results in an abbreviated mitotic phase, as evidenced by a delay of entry into mitosis but not G1. Additionally, a greater number of FAT10-overexpressing cells escape mitotic controls and are multinucleate upon prolonged nocodazole treatment. Notably, we observed a higher degree of variability in chromosome number in cells overexpressing FAT10, suggesting a more pronounced degree of mitotic nondisjunction in these cells. This is the first report to identify FAT10 as an important player in the regulation of mitosis and CIN. Generation of Plasmid Constructs and HCT116 Cell Lines Stably Expressing FAT1—The Gateway Cloning Technology (Invitrogen) was utilized to clone the FAT10 cDNA downstream of the N-terminal His6 tag peptide of the destination vectors pDEST26 (with CMV constitutive promoter) and pT-REx-DEST31 (with tetracycline-inducible promoter) to generate pEXPR26-HisFAT10 and pTREXPR31-HisFAT10, respectively. HCT116 colon carcinoma cells were transfected with pEXPR26-His-FAT10 or co-transfected with pTREXPR31-HisFAT10 and pcDNA6/TR (containing the tetracycline repressor gene) using Superfect™ transfection reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions to generate cells expressing FAT10 constitutively or under tetracycline induction. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, a 1:100 dilution of cells was seeded into McCoy's 5A medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal calf serum and 0.7 mg/ml G418-sulfate (Promega). Additionally, 1 μg/ml Blasticidin (Invitrogen) was added to cells cotransfected with pTREXPR31-HisFAT10 and pcDNA6/TR. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for ∼10 days, and several colonies were selected and analyzed for FAT10 expression by Western blot analyses using anti-FAT10 antibody (25Lee C.G. Ren J. Cheong I.S. Ban K.H. Ooi L.L. Yong Tan S. Kan A. Nuchprayoon I. Jin R. Lee K.H. Choti M. Lee L.A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2592-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). For cells transfected with pTREXPR31-HisFAT10 and pcDNA6/TR, expression of HisFAT10 was induced for 24 h with 2 μg/ml tetracycline (Invitrogen) prior to harvesting for Western analysis. One clone stably expressing FAT10 constitutively (FAT116) and three clones stably expressing FAT10 under tetracycline induction (TetFAT116a, TetFAT116b, and TetFAT116c) were selected for further analyses. Characterization of HCT116 Cells Stably Expressing FAT1—Morphology of cells was examined under an Olympus Research inverted microscope (IX51), and images were captured with a Qimaging Retiga 1300R digital imager (Qimaging). The growth profile of these cells was determined by seeding these cells in 24-well plates. At various time points as indicated, cells were harvested, and only viable cells were counted using trypan blue exclusion and a hemocytometer. Cell cycle profile was examined by fixing the cells in 2% paraformaldehyde, staining them with propidium iodide solution, and analyzing the stained cells using the FACScalibur™ instrument (BD Biosciences). Apoptotic profile was examined using the Annexin V-phycoerythrin kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol and analyzed using the FACScalibur™ instrument. Immunofluorescence Analysis—HCT116 or FAT116 cells were grown on coverslips and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution. These cells were then permeabilized in 0.2% Triton solution and co-stained with rabbit anti-FAT10 polyclonal antibody (25Lee C.G. Ren J. Cheong I.S. Ban K.H. Ooi L.L. Yong Tan S. Kan A. Nuchprayoon I. Jin R. Lee K.H. Choti M. Lee L.A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2592-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and mouse anti-MAD2 monoclonal IgG (BD Biosciences). Alexa Fluor® 647 chicken anti-mouse or Alexa Fluor® 488 anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) were used as secondary antibodies. Cells were also incubated with DAPI to distinguish the cell cycle stages. Cellular localization and cell cycle stage observations were performed on the LSM510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Immunoprecipitation—HCT 116 cells were infected with either control vector adenoviruses (control) or adenoviruses expressing the FAT10 gene (25Lee C.G. Ren J. Cheong I.S. Ban K.H. Ooi L.L. Yong Tan S. Kan A. Nuchprayoon I. Jin R. Lee K.H. Choti M. Lee L.A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2592-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours later, these cells were incubated in 300 ng/ml nocodazole-containing media or left untreated. Twenty hours later, the cells were pelleted and lysed. Cell debris was removed through centrifugation, and the protein concentration of the protein lysate was adjusted to 3 mg/ml. Immunoprecipitation was carried out using the protein G-immunoprecipitation kit (Roche Applied Science) on 600 μg of the lysate with 2 μg of either of the following antibodies: p16 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), which served as a nonspecific rabbit IgG control; p53 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), which served as a nonspecific mouse IgG control; monoclonal MAD2 antibody (BD Biosciences); and FAT10 antibodies generated by our laboratory in rabbits. The immunoprecipitated proteins were electrophoresed in 18% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and Western blot analyses was performed as described previously (25Lee C.G. Ren J. Cheong I.S. Ban K.H. Ooi L.L. Yong Tan S. Kan A. Nuchprayoon I. Jin R. Lee K.H. Choti M. Lee L.A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2592-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) using either FAT10 or MAD2 antibodies. Generation of MAD2-EGFP Fusion Construct—To determine the subcellular localization of the MAD2 protein, a MAD2-EGFP fusion construct was generated via a two-step PCR as described previously (25Lee C.G. Ren J. Cheong I.S. Ban K.H. Ooi L.L. Yong Tan S. Kan A. Nuchprayoon I. Jin R. Lee K.H. Choti M. Lee L.A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2592-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) using the following primers: primer A, 5′-tataggatccaatggcgctgcagctctcc-3′; primer B, 5′-ctcgcccttgctcaccatgtcattgacaggaattttgt-3′; primer C, 5′-atggtgagcaagggcgag-3′; primer D, 5′-ttgcggccgcttacttgtacagctcgtcca-3′. In the first step, MAD2 and EGFP genes were amplified separately. MAD2 was amplified from human liver cDNA with primers A and B, whereas EGFP was amplified from pEGFP-1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using primers C and D. The purified amplified MAD2 and EGFP PCR products were then mixed, and another PCR was performed using primers A and D to generate the fused MAD2-EGFP-amplified product. The fused MAD2-EGFP-amplified product was then cloned into the BamHI/NotI site of the pCMVDsRed plasmid, replacing the resident DsRed (Discosoma red fluorescent protein) gene in the construct to generate pCMVMAD2EGFP. The identity of the fusion pCMVMAD2EGFP construct was confirmed by sequencing. MAD2 aggregation at the kinetochores was quantitated by determining the intensity of the bright fluorescent signals normalized against similarly sized diffused fluorescent signals in other regions of the cells. The region outside the cell serves as the “blank” signals. A paired two-tailed t test was utilized to evaluate the significance of the difference between HCT116 and FAT116 cells. DNA Content, Mitotic Index, and Apoptosis Determination—HCT116, FAT116, uninduced TetFAT116c, and tetracycline-induced TetFAT116c were synchronized to G1/S phase using double thymidine treatment. Briefly, cells were incubated in media containing 3 mm thymidine (Sigma) for 17 h, followed by 12 h in media without thymidine and finally another 15 h in media containing 3 mm thymidine. To determine the mitotic index, synchronized cells were released into 300 ng/ml nocodazole-supplemented media to arrest cells at mitosis, harvested at the indicated time points in PBS containing 4 mm EDTA, and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 solution and probed with MPM2 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) as the primary antibody and Alexa Fluor® 488 chicken anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) as the secondary antibody. Stained cells were analyzed using the FACScalibur™ flow sorter (BD Biosciences). To determine DNA content, synchronized cells were released into fresh working media without nocodazole, harvested at the indicated time points, and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde. These cells were then stained with propidium iodide solution and analyzed using the FACScalibur™ instrument. A paired two-tailed t test was utilized to evaluate the significance of the difference between control/uninduced and FAT10/induced cells. Analysis of Chromosomal Numbers—G-banded chromosome analysis was performed on HCT116 parental cells, FAT116 cells, uninduced parental HCT116, TetFAT116a, TetFAT116b, and TetFAT116c cells, and tetracycline-induced parental HCT116, TetFAT116a, TetFAT116b, and TetFAT116c cells. The parental HCT116 and FAT116 cells had been in continuous culture for ∼11 months with ∼80 subcultures (i.e. these cells had undergone ∼250 cell doublings). Tetracycline-inducible TetFAT116a, TetFAT116b, and TetFAT116c cells and parental HCT116 cells were grown in media with or without 3 μg/ml tetracycline supplementation (Sigma) for 33 subcultures (or ∼100 doublings). These cells were reselected in 5 μg/ml Blasticidin and 0.7 mg/ml G418 before karyotype determination. Briefly, cells were first synchronized for 17 h in media containing 3 mm thymidine, replaced with fresh medium without thymidine for 7 h, and then treated with 0.1 μg/ml colcemid (Invitrogen) for 1.5 h. Cells were detached in phosphate-buffered saline containing 4 mm EDTA and rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline without EDTA, swelled in 0.06 m KCl solution, and fixed in a 3:1 methanol/glacial acetate acid mix. Fixed cells were dropped onto microscope slides, partially digested with trypsin, and stained with Giemsa solution (Invitrogen). Chromosome numbers were counted using BandView (Applied Spectral Imaging GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Cells Stably Overexpressing FAT10 Have Growth, Cell Cycle, and Apoptotic Profiles Similar to Those of Parental Cells—We generated and characterized the HCT116 cell line stably overexpressing FAT10 named FAT116. FAT116 cells were found to express high levels of the FAT10 protein, as shown by Western blot analyses (Fig. 1A). The FAT10 protein was found to be expressed in the nucleus of these FAT116 cells (Fig. 1B) through confocal microscopy. Morphology (Fig. 1C) and growth properties (Fig. 1D) of FAT116 cells were found to be similar to their parental HCT116 cells. Additionally, expression of FAT10 in FAT116 cells also did not alter the general cell cycle (Fig. 1E, top two panels) or apoptotic profiles (Fig. 1E, bottom two panels) significantly. FAT10 Interacts with MAD2 during Mitosis—As FAT10 was reported to interact with MAD2 (17Liu Y.C. Pan J. Zhang C. Fan W. Collinge M. Bender J.R. Weissman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4313-4318Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), it may play a role in the regulation of mitosis. We thus evaluated if this interaction between FAT10 and MAD2 occurs during the mitotic phase of the cell cycle using co-immunoprecipitation assays. We were unable to detect the FAT10 protein in the anti-MAD2 immunoprecipitate or vice versa in unsynchronized cells, where a majority of the cells are in the G1 phase (Fig. 2, untreated). Notably, when these cells were arrested at mitosis with nocodazole, MAD2 was detected in the anti-FAT10 or anti-MAD2 immunoprecipitate in FAT10-expressing HCT116 cells and only in anti-MAD2 immunoprecipitate in control cells (Fig. 2, Nocodazole treated). FAT10 was detected in anti-MAD2 or anti-FAT10 immunoprecipitate of only nocodazole-treated FAT10-expressing HCT116 cells (Fig. 2). Neither FAT10 nor MAD2 was detected when cells were co-immunoprecipitated with nonspecific control antibodies (Fig. 2). These results confirm the previous observations (17Liu Y.C. Pan J. Zhang C. Fan W. Collinge M. Bender J.R. Weissman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4313-4318Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) that MAD2 and FAT10 are capable of interaction, and we demonstrate that the interaction occurs during mitosis. Localization of MAD2 at the Kinetochore Is Greatly Reduced in FAT10-overexpressing Cells—To determine the fate of MAD2 in FAT10-overexpressing cells, we generated a construct, pCMVMAD2EGFP, whereby the MAD2 gene was fused with the EGFP gene. We then transfected this construct as well as the vector control construct not containing MAD2, pCMVEGFP, into either the parental HCT116 or the FAT116 cells and demonstrated through Western analyses that the EGFP and MAD2-EGFP fusion proteins could be expressed (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, when pCMVEGFP, the vector control plasmid, was introduced into either the parental HCT116 or FAT116 cells, the EGFP fluorescence signal was diffused throughout the cell (Fig. 3B, top two panels). When the construct, pCMVMAD2EGFP, was transfected into the parental HCT116 cells, the MAD2-EGFP fusion protein seemed to accumulate as strong punctate signals at the kinetochores (Fig. 3B, bottom left panels) during the prometaphase but not the metaphase stage of the cell cycle. This observation is consistent with the reported localization of MAD2 during mitosis (26Waters J.C. Chen R.H. Murray A.W. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1181-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in FAT10-overexpressing FAT116 cells, the MAD2-EGFP fusion protein appeared diffuse whether the cells were in the prometaphase or metaphase stage of the cell cycle (Fig. 3B, bottom right panels). Statistically significant (p < 0.01) reductions in the punctuate signals at the kinetochores was observed in the prometaphase stage in FAT10-expressing cells compared with parental HCT116 cells (Fig. 3C). In cells that did not receive the pCMVEGFP or pCMVMAD2EGFP construct, no fluorescence was observed (Fig. 3B, top row of each panel). Taken together, these results suggest that MAD2 localization at the kinetochore is greatly reduced in FAT10-overexpressing cells during the critical prometaphase stage of the cell cycle. These observations are consistent with the results obtained when HCT116 and FAT116 cells were stained with anti-FAT10, anti-MAD2 antibodies, and DAPI (Fig. 3, D and E). As shown in Fig. 3D, in parental HCT116 cells where FAT10 expression is negligible, MAD2 aggregated at the kinetochores during the prometaphase stage of the cell cycle. However, when the FAT10 gene was overexpressed in FAT116 cells, MAD2 aggregation at the kinetochores was significantly reduced (p < 0.01). Hence, FAT10 interaction with MAD2 during mitosis may decrease the efficiency of binding of MAD2 to the unattached kinetochore, although it does not seem to completely block the function of MAD2. These results are consistent with the previous observation that MAD2 haploinsufficiency is sufficient to cause premature anaphase and chromosome instability (8Michel L.S. Liberal V. Chatterjee A. Kirchwegger R. Pasche B. Gerald W. Dobles M. Sorger P.K. Murty V.V. Benezra R. Nature. 2001; 409: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). FAT10 Overexpression Results in an Abbreviated Mitotic Phase—Since FAT10 interacts and reduces the kinetochore localization of MAD2 during mitosis and since MAD2 is a mitotic checkpoint protein (5Shah J.V. Cleveland D.W. Cell. 2000; 103: 997-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of overexpression of FAT10 on cell cycle regulation and especially on mitosis. HCT116 parental cells, HCT116 cells stably expressing FAT10 constitutively (FAT116), and uninduced and induced HCT116 cells stably expressing FAT10 under the tetracycline-inducible promoter (TetFAT116c) were synchronized at G1/S phase using double thymidine treatment (Fig. 4, A and C, 0 h). These cells were released into either media containing nocodazole or fresh media without nocodazole and at various time points were stained with the mitosis-specific antibody, MPM2 (Fig. 4B) or propidium iodide to monitor their progress into mitosis (Fig. 4, A, D, and E) or the next G1 phase (Fig. 4, C, F, and G), respectively. As shown in Fig. 4D, ∼5% of both HCT116 and FAT116 cells entered mitosis at 4 h after release from G1/S. However, at each time point after 4 h, ∼10% more parental cells entered mitosis than FAT10-overexpressing cells. Similar observations were made when uninduced and tetracycline-induced TetFAT116 cells were compared (Fig. 4E). When these experiments were repeated on different occasions, similar trends were observed. These results suggest that there may be a delay in entrance into mitosis in FAT10-overexpressing cells. However, it is also possible that the observed reduction in mitotic FAT10-expressing cells may be a consequence of these cells escaping M-phase and reverting to interphase with a tetraploid G1 DNA content. Interestingly, reentry of cells into G1 phase from their arrest at G1/S was similar between HCT116 and FAT116 cells (Fig. 4F) as well as between uninduced and tetracycline-induced TetFAT116 cells, despite the delayed entry into mitosis of FAT116 and tetracycline-induced Tet-FAT116 cells (Fig. 4G). Similar trends were observed when these experiments were repeated. When data from the different experiments were combined and analyzed together, we found that the difference between the HCT116 and FAT116 cells (Fig. 4H) or uninduced and induced TetFAT116 cells (Fig. 4I) in time of entry into mitosis was significantly greater (p < 0.05) than their corresponding difference in time of reentry into G1. Taken together, these data suggest both a delayed and an abbreviated mitotic phase in cells overexpressing FAT10. An alternative explanation is that FAT10 overexpression results in shortened mitotic arrest in cells with spindle damage. FAT10 Overexpression Results in Greater Escape from Mitotic Arrest, More Multinucleate Cells upon Prolonged Mitotic Arrest, and Chromosome Instability—To address the effect of FAT10 overexpression on mitosis, parental HCT116 and FAT116 cells were treated with 200 ng/ml nocodazole for 8 h. Mitotic cells were then shaken off and replated in media containing 200 ng/ml nocodazole for another 15 h. The doubling time for both HCT116 and FAT116 cells is ∼15 h. We found more adherent FAT116 (>20%) than HCT116 (6.5%) cells (Fig. 5, A and B), suggesting that more FAT116 cells either failed to arrest or escaped mitotic arrest and continued to cycle. To rule out the possibility that the observed increase in adherent FAT116 cells was due to increased contamination of interphase FAT116 cells, the mitotic index of the reattached HCT116 and FAT116 cells after shake-off was determined. As shown in Fig. 5C, greater than 95% of the reattached cells were mitotic cells, and the percentage of interphase cells was small and similar between the HCT116 and FAT116 cells. Upon prolonged exposure to nocodazole (54 h), most of the HCT116 and FAT116 cells"

It requires the involvement of the high energy form of the universal sulfate donor, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS). Recently, we identified a PAPS transporter gene in both humans and Drosophila. Although human colonic epithelial tissues express many sulfated glycoconjugates, PAPST1 expression in the colon is trace. In the present study, we identified a novel human PAPS transporter gene that is closely related to human PAPST1. This gene, called PAPST2, is predominantly expressed in human colon tissues. The PAPST2 protein is localized on the Golgi apparatus in a manner similar to the PAPST1 protein. By using yeast expression studies, PAPST2 protein was shown to have PAPS transport activity with an apparent Km value of 2.2 μm, which is comparable with that of PAPST1 (0.8 μm). Overexpression of either the PAPST1 or PAPST2 gene increased PAPS transport activity in human colon cancer HCT116 cells. The RNA interference of the PAPST2 gene in the HCT116 cells significantly reduced the reactivity of G72 antibody directed against the sialyl 6-sulfo N-acetyllactosamine epitope and total sulfate incorporation into cellular proteins.

Because most of the sulfation of glycoconjugates occurs in the Golgi apparatus, the translocation of PAPS is considered to be an essential process. Recently, we identified and characterized a PAPS transporter in both humans and Drosophila (3Kamiyama S. Suda T. Ueda R. Suzuki M. Okubo R. Kikuchi N. Chiba Y. Goto S. Toyoda H. Saigo K. Watanabe M.

Human PAPST1 and the Drosophila ortholog SLALOM (SLL) are Golgi-localized proteins that exhibit PAPS-specific transport activity.

Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) possess glycosaminoglycan chains that contain diversely sulfated uronic acid and glucosamine residues.

A mutation in the sll gene caused defects in multiple signaling pathways, including Wingless and Hedgehog signaling, probably because of the lack of HSPG sulfation (4Lüders F. Segawa H. Stein D.

For example, the 3′-sulfo Lewis a epitope (3′-sulfo Lea: Gal β1,3 (fucose α1,4) GlcNAc that is sulfated at the C-3 position of Gal) is strongly expressed in the normal colonic epithelium but diminishes considerably in primary colon carcinomas (11Irimura T.

In the present study, we attempted to identify the PAPS transporter that is responsible for the sulfation of glycoconjugates in the colon tissue. We found a gene that is closely related to the human PAPST1 gene by performing a BLAST search of data bases. This gene, called PAPST2, is preferentially expressed in human colon tissues. The PAPST2 protein exhibited PAPS transport activity similar to that of the PAPST1 protein. Here, we report the functional properties of this novel PAPS transporter. Materials—GDP-[2-3H]mannose (15 Ci/mmol), UDP-[1-3H]glucose (15 Ci/mmol), UDP-N-acetyl [6-3H]d-galactosamine (15 Ci/mmol), UDP-[14C(U)]glucuronic acid (15 Ci/mmol), and carrier-free [35S]H2SO4 (100 m Ci/ml) were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. (St. Louis, MO). GDP-[1-3H]fucose (6.95 Ci/mmol), UDP-[4,5-3H]galactose (48.3 Ci/mmol), CMP-[9-3H]sialic acid (33.6 Ci/mmol), UDP-N-acetyl [6-3H(N)]d-glucosamine (39.7 Ci/mmol), and [35S]PAPS (1.82 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Perkin Elmer Life Sciences Inc. Zymolyase 100T was obtained from Seikagaku Kogyo Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody (mAb) (9E10) and rhodamine-conjugated anti-influenza hemagglutinin epitope (HA) mAb (HA-probe, F-7) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). All the other reagents used in the study were of the highest purity grade available commercially. Isolation of Human PAPS Transporter cDNA and Construction of Expression Plasmids—The human PAPST2 gene was identified and cloned using the same procedures as described previously (3Kamiyama S. Suda T. Ueda R. Suzuki M. Okubo R. Kikuchi N. Chiba Y. Goto S. Toyoda H. Saigo K. Watanabe M. Narimatsu H. Jigami Y. Nishihara S. J. Biol.

Kawakita M. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) was used as a query sequence for the TBLASTN search that was performed to detect novel genes. To obtain the cDNA of NM_015948, a human gene that was identified in this study, and to create recombination sites for the GATEWAY™ cloning system (Invitrogen), we used two steps of attB adaptor PCR and prepared attB-flanked PCR products. For the first gene-specific amplification, a forward template-specific primer with attB1, 5′-AAAAAGCAGGCTTCCATAATGGCATGGACTTG-3′, and a reverse template-specific primer with attB2, 5′-AGAAAGCTGGGTCTACAGTCTGTGCCAGCGT-3′, were used. PCR was performed using Platinum® Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and a cDNA library derived from human colon tissue. The insertion of a complete attB adaptor and cloning into the pDONR™201 vector were performed in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol to create an entry clone for use during the subsequent subcloning steps. The entry clone was subcloned into the appropriate expression vectors by using the GATEWAY™ cloning system in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. A 3 × HA epitope tag or a c-Myc tag was inserted into the expression vectors at the position corresponding to the C terminus of the expressing protein. Transient Transfection and Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Transient transfection and immunofluorescence microscopy were performed by using one of two procedures. The first procedure is similar to one described previously (3Kamiyama S. Suda T. Ueda R. Suzuki M. Okubo R. Kikuchi N. Chiba Y. Goto S. Toyoda H. Saigo K. Watanabe M. Narimatsu H. Jigami Y.

Briefly, HCT116 cells were subcultured onto a 4-well Lab-Tek chamber slide (Nalge Nunc International) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's nutrient mixture F-12 (1:1) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After 24 h of subculturing, the HCT116 cells were transfected with 0.25 μg/well of pCXN2 (20Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene. 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar), pCXN2 inserted with HA-tagged PAPST1, or pCXN2 inserted with HA-tagged PAPST2 by using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. After 72 h, the cells were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C, and they were then permeabilized in a permeabilizing buffer (PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100) for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were subsequently double immunostained with rhodamine-conjugated anti-HA mAb and anti-β1,4-galactosyltransferase 1 mAb (21Uemura M. Sakaguchi T. Uejima T. Nozawa S. Narimatsu H. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6153-6157PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (3Kamiyama S. Suda T. Ueda R. Suzuki M. Okubo R. Kikuchi N. Chiba Y. Goto S. Toyoda H. Saigo K. Watanabe M. Narimatsu H.

Finally, the cells were washed four times and mounted with PermaFluor (Thermo Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA). The fluorescence was observed using a confocal laser scanning microscope, LSM5 Pascal (Carl Zeiss, Goettingen, Germany). In the second procedure, HA-tagged PAPST2 and c-Myc-tagged PAPST1 were expressed simultaneously in the HCT116 cells. After 24 h of subculturing, the cells were transfected with 0.25 μg/well of pCXN2 or pCXN2 inserted with HA-tagged PAPST2 and pCXN2 inserted with c-Myc-tagged PAPST1 by using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. The cells were fixed, permeabilized, and immunostained with FITC-conjugated anti-c-Myc mAb and rhodamine-conjugated anti-HA mAb for 30 min at 37 °C after 72 h. The remainder of the procedure was the same as that described above. Stable Transfection and Subcellular Fractionation—HCT116 cells were subcultured onto 6-cm dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's nutrient mixture F-12 (1:1) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After 24 h, the cells were transfected with 8 μg of pCXN2 vector, pCXN2 inserted with HA-tagged PAPST1, or pCXN2 inserted with HA-tagged PAPST2 by using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. The transfectants were selected by the addition of 600 μg/ml of geneticin (Invitrogen) to the medium and cultured for 1 month after 48 h. Subcellular fractionation was performed as described previously (3Kamiyama S. Suda T. Ueda R. Suzuki M. Okubo R. Kikuchi N. Chiba Y. Goto S. Toyoda H. Saigo K. Watanabe M. Narimatsu H. Jigami Y.

The cells were harvested and suspended in 10 mm HEPES-Tris (pH 7.4) containing 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A. The cells were then homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer. The lysate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min to remove the unlysed cells and cell wall debris. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 7,700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g to yield a pellet of P100 membrane fraction. Subcellular Fractionation of Yeast and Transport Assay—Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) strain W303-1a (MATa, ade2-1, ura3-1, his3-11,15, trp1-1, leu2-3,112, and can1-100) was transformed by the lithium acetate procedure (22Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a yeast expression vector, YEp352GAP-II (23Nakayama K. Maeda Y. Jigami Y. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These transformed yeast cells were grown at 30 °C in a synthetic defined medium, which did not contain uracil, for selecting transformants. Subcellular fractionation and nucleotide sugar transport assays were performed as described previously (3Kamiyama S. Suda T. Ueda R. Suzuki M. Okubo R. Kikuchi N. Chiba Y. Goto S. Toyoda H. Saigo K.

The cells were harvested, washed with ice-cold 10 mm NaN3, and converted into spheroplasts by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min in spheroplast buffer (1.4 m sorbitol, 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaN3, 40 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mg of Zymolyase 100T/g of cells). The spheroplasts were pelleted using a refrigerated centrifuge and washed twice with 1.0 m ice-cold sorbitol to remove traces of zymolyase. The cells were suspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.8 m sorbitol in 10 mm triethanolamine (pH 7.2), 5 μg/ml of pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and subsequently homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer. The lysate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min to remove the unlysed cells and cell wall debris. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, which yielded a pellet of P10 membrane fraction. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g to yield a pellet of P100 membrane fraction. Each fraction (200 μg of protein) was then incubated in 100 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.25 m sucrose, 5.0 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm MnCl2, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) that contained 1 μm radiolabeled substrate at 30 °C for 5 min. After incubation, the radioactivity incorporated in the microsomes was trapped using a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filter and measured using liquid scintillation. The amount of incorporated radioactivity was calculated as the difference from the background value obtained from the same assay at 30 °C for 0 min for each sample. Western Blot Analysis—Fifty micrograms of protein from each sample was added to 3× sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) and subsequently incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The samples were fractionated on a 2-15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel gradient (Daiichi Pure Chemicals Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The separated proteins were electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The HA-tagged proteins were immunostained with anti-HA mouse mAb and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG mAb. Bound horseradish peroxidase was detected using ECL plus (Amersham Biosciences) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative Analysis of the PAPST2 Transcript in Human Tissues by Real-time PCR—The amount of PAPST1 and PAPST2 transcripts in human tissues was determined by real-time PCR. Total RNA was extracted from human tissues by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). First strand cDNA was synthesized using a Superscript II First Strand Synthesis kit (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time PCR was performed using a qPCR Mastermix (QuickGoldStar; Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) and ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA). The PCR primer pair sequences and TaqMan probes used for each gene were as follows. For the detection of PAPST1, the forward primer 5′-GGCAGGCCCTGAAGCT-3′, reverse primer 5′-TGCGGGTCATCACTCTTTC-3′, and probe 5′-CCACAGGGCTCCAGGTGTCTTATCTG-3′ were used. For the detection of PAPST2, the forward primer 5′-GATTAGGCCCTGCAGTAACATT-3′, reverse primer 5′-ATCCAGTGAGGGAAAAAAGGA-3′, and probe 5′-TGTGCAAAGAATCCAGTTCGGACCTA-3′ were used. The probes were labeled at the 5′-end with the reporter dye FAM and at the 3′-end with the quencher dye TAMRA. The relative amounts of PAPST1 and PAPST2 transcripts were normalized with respect to the human glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) transcripts present in the same cDNA. Northern Blot Analysis—PAPST2 cDNA probe (full-length open reading frame) was prepared by random priming using [α-32P]dCTP and BcaBest™ labeling kit (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using Oligotex-dT30 (super) mRNA purification kit (Takara Bio Inc.) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Poly(A)+ RNA derived from each sample was separated by 1.2% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde and then transferred onto Hybond-XL nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were prehybridized in the hybridization solution (5× SSPE (standard saline phosphate with EDTA; 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA), 5× Denhardt's solution, and 0.2 mg/ml of sermon sperm DNA) for 2 h at 42°C. The membranes were hybridized overnight in hybridization solution containing 2 × 106 cpm/ml of each radiolabeled probe at 42 °C. Following hybridization, the membrane was washed in 2× SSPE containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature and in 0.2× SSPE containing 0.1% SDS at 50 °C. The radiolabeled materials were detected by using a BAS-2000 imaging analyzer (Fuji Photo Film). The membrane was reprobed with a human GAPDH cDNA probe. RNAi of PAPST2 Gene—A sequence of small interfering RNA (siRNA) for each gene was designed as described previously (25Ui-Tei K. Naito Y. Takahashi F. Haraguchi T. Ohki-Hamazaki H. Juni A. Ueda R. Saigo K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 936-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Twenty-five base pairs of stealth RNAs were designed and purchased from Invitrogen. The PAPST1-813 siRNA (initiated at the 813 nucleotide position from the start codon) has the sequence 5′-CCUCAUCUUACUGGCAGGUUAUAUU-3′. The sequences of PAPST2-342 siRNA (initiated at the 342 nucleotide position from the start codon) and PAPST2-513 siRNA (initiated at the 513 nucleotide position from the start codon) are 5′-CCUUACCUUAGUGCAGUUUGCCUUU-3′ and 5′-CCAAGUCAUCUUCAAGUGCUGCAAA-3′, respectively. As control siRNA, stealth RNAi negative control duplex (Invitrogen) was used. The HCT116 cells were subcultured onto 6-cm dishes at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's nutrient mixture F-12 (1:1) containing 10% fetal bovine serum 24 h prior to the transfection. The cells were transfected with 10 or 100 nm siRNA by using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and the first strand cDNA was synthesized using a Superscript II First Strand Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Metabolic Labeling of Colon Cancer Cell Line—Radiolabeling of sulfated residues in cell macromolecules was performed using procedures similar to those described previously (26Tsuiji H. Hayashi M. Wynn D.M. Irimura T. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1998; 89: 1267-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). HCT116 cells were subcultured onto 10-cm dishes at a concentration of 1.5 or 2 × 106 cells/dish in the inorganic sulfate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's nutrient mixture F-12 (1:1) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μCi/ml of carrier-free [35S]H2SO4 48 h after transfection and 48 h prior to the analysis. The cells were rinsed with PBS and detached with PBS containing 0.02% EDTA for 5 min. The cells were rinsed twice with PBS and suspended in 4 volumes of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 1 h. The solution was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatants were used as cell lysates. Fifty micrograms of protein from each sample were added to 3× SDS sample buffer (New England Biolabs Inc.) and boiled at 100 °C for 5 min. The samples were fractionated on a 2-15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel gradient (Daiichi Pure Chemicals Co., Ltd.). Gels were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue and dried on Whatman 3MM paper (Whatman International Ltd.). The radiolabeled materials were detected by using a BAS-2000 imaging analyzer (Fuji Photo Film). Flow Cytometric Analysis—The HCT116 cells were subcultured onto 10-cm dishes at a concentration of 1.5 or 2 × 106 cells/dish 72 h after transfection and 24 h prior to the analysis. These cells were then harvested with PBS containing 1 mm EDTA and washed with a wash buffer (PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% sodium azide). Cell suspensions of 100 μl (0.5 × 106 cells) were incubated with G72 mAb (27Mitsuoka C. Sawada-Kasugai M. Ando-Furui K. Izawa M. Nakanishi H. Nakamura S. Ishida H. Kiso M. Kannagi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11225-11233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) for 1 h on ice and washed twice with 0.5 ml of the wash buffer. The cells were then resuspended in 100 μl of FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM and incubated on ice for 30 min. The cells were washed twice with wash buffer and resuspended in 500 μl of PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide. Flow cytometric analysis was performed using FAC-SAria flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and WinMDI 2.8 software (The Scripps Research Institute Cytometry software page). Molecular Cloning of Human PAPST2 cDNA—We identified a cDNA sequence (GenBank™ Accession number NM_015948) homologous to the putative nucleotide sugar transporter gene UGTrel1 by using the same procedure that was employed for the PAPST1 gene (3Kamiyama S. Suda T. Ueda R. Suzuki M. Okubo R. Kikuchi N. Chiba Y. Goto S. Toyoda H. Saigo K. Watanabe M. Narimatsu H. Jigami Y. Nishihara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25958-25963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Initially, it was described as CGI-19 protein in the GenBank™ data base. We named it PAPST2 and cloned the open reading frame as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The phylogenetic tree of PAPS and the nucleotide sugar transporter genes in humans and Drosophila indicated that PAPST1, PAPST2, and UGTrel1 are classified in the same group (Fig. 1A). An alignment of the amino acid sequences of these genes is shown in Fig. 1B. PAPST2 comprised 401 amino acids with a calculated mass of 44.6 kDa. Hydrophobicity analyses of the amino acid sequences indicate that the PAPST2 protein is a type III transmembrane protein with nine transmembrane domains similar to that of PAPST1, although the transmembrane topology has yet to be verified experimentally. PAPST2 showed 22.4 and 21.7% identity to UGTrel1 and PAPST1, respectively. The structural similarity suggested that PAPST2 is a PAPS transporter gene similar to PAPST1. There are eight potential N-glycosylation sites in the PAPST2. The PAPST2 gene is mapped on human chromosome 6p24.3, and the mRNA comprises 11 exons. PAPST2 Is a Golgi-localized Protein—PAPST1 is a membrane protein that is localized on the Golgi apparatus (3Kamiyama S. Suda T. Ueda R. Suzuki M. Okubo R. Kikuchi N. Chiba Y. Goto S. Toyoda H. Saigo K. Watanabe M. Narimatsu H. Jigami Y. Nishihara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25958-25963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Because PAPST2 shares similarity to PAPST1, we expected that PAPST2 would also be a Golgi-localized PAPS transporter. First, we investigated the subcellular localization of the PAPST2 protein. Human colon cancer HCT116 cells were transiently transfected with a mammalian expression vector, pCXN2, that contained HA-tagged PAPST2 or HA-tagged PAPST1 gene and were double immunostained with anti-HA mAb and anti-β1,4 galactosyltransferase 1 mAb. The results of immunofluorescence microscopy of the cells are shown in Fig. 2A. The HA-tagged PAPST1 protein was observed to be colocalized with β1,4 galactosyltransferase 1, which is a protein that is typically localized in the trans-Golgi (21Uemura M. Sakaguchi T. Uejima T. Nozawa S. Narimatsu H. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6153-6157PubMed Google Scholar), and this observation is consistent with a previous report (3Kamiyama S. Suda T. Ueda R. Su"
https://openalex.org/W2070817709,"Cell-surface proteoglycans have been shown to modulate transforming growth factor (TGF)-β responsiveness in epithelial cells and other cell types. However, the proteoglycan (heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfate) involved in modulation of TGF-β responsiveness and the mechanism by which it modulates TGF-β responsiveness remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that TGF-β<sub>1</sub> induces transcriptional activation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and growth inhibition more potently in CHO cell mutants deficient in heparan sulfate (CHO-677 cells) than in wild-type CHO-K1 cells. <sup>125</sup>I-TGF-β<sub>1</sub> affinity labeling analysis of cell-surface TGF-β receptors reveals that CHO-K1 and CHO-677 cells exhibit low (<1) and high (>1) ratios of <sup>125</sup>I-TGF-β<sub>1</sub> binding to TβR-II and TβR-I, respectively. Receptor-bound <sup>125</sup>I-TGF-β<sub>1</sub> undergoes nystatin-inhibitable rapid degradation in CHO-K1 cells but not in CHO-677 cells. In Mv1Lu cells (which, like CHO-K1 cells, exhibit nystatin-inhibitable rapid degradation of receptor-bound <sup>125</sup>I-TGF-β<sub>1</sub>), treatment with heparitinase or a heparan sulfate biosynthesis inhibitor results in a change from a low (<1) to a high (>1) ratio of <sup>125</sup>I-TGF-β<sub>1</sub> binding to TβR-II and TβR-I and enhanced TGF-β<sub>1</sub>-induced transcriptional activation of PAI-1. Sucrose density gradient analysis indicates that a significant fraction of TβR-I and TβR-II is localized in caveolae/lipid-raft fractions in CHO-K1 and Mv1Lu cells whereas the majority of the TGF-β receptors are localized in non-lipid-raft fractions in CHO-677 cells. These results suggest that heparan sulfate negatively modulates TGF-β<sub>1</sub> responsiveness by decreasing the ratio of TGF-β<sub>1</sub> binding to TβR-II and TβR-I, facilitating caveolae/lipid-raft-mediated endocytosis and rapid degradation of TGF-β<sub>1</sub>, thus diminishing non-lipid-raft-mediated endocytosis and signaling of TGF-β<sub>1</sub> in these epithelial cells."

https://openalex.org/W1998171797,"A substantial number of neural stem cells (NSCs) continue to proliferate and generate neurons in the central nervous system throughout life. Ionizing radiation, an important adjuvant therapy for glioma patients, may damage NSCs and cause neuronal deficits, such as cognitive dysfunction and memory impairment. However, the precise mechanism of radiation effects on death and differentiation of NSCs remains largely unknown. Here, we found that radiation induced apoptosis in NSCs via the mitochondrial pathway, upregulating the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 and releasing cytochrome c into the cytoplasm. Radiation also inhibited neuronal differentiation of NSCs by 50%. Of the three stress-associated mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), only c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) was activated in NSCs after radiation. Interestingly, JNK inhibition by the specific inhibitor SP600125 rescued NSCs from apoptosis and improved neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, we examined whether radiation directly inhibits neuronal differentiation or not. Radiation did not affect the promoter activity of NeuroD, a basic helix–loop–helix transcription factor that regulates the expression of neuronal differentiation markers. Radiation induced more apoptosis in NeuroD-positive cells than NeuroD-negative cells. We concluded that radiation activates JNK and induces apoptosis, especially in neural progenitor cells, resulting in the inhibition of neurogenesis. Our findings raise the possibility that JNK inhibition has therapeutic potential in protecting NSCs from the adverse effects of radiation."
https://openalex.org/W2116200843,"The Clathrin Assembly Lymphoid Myeloid leukemia gene (CALM or PICALM) was first identified as the fusion partner of AF10 in the t(10;11)(p13;q14) translocation, which is observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and malignant lymphoma. The CALM/AF10 fusion protein plays a crucial role in t(10;11)(p13;q14) associated leukemogenesis. Using the N-terminal half of CALM as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, a novel protein named CATS (CALM interacting protein expressed in thymus and spleen) was identified. Multiple tissue Northern blot analysis showed predominant expression of CATS in thymus, spleen and colon. CATS codes for two protein isoforms of 238 and 248 amino acids (aa). The interaction between CALM and CATS could be confirmed using pull down assays, co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization experiments. The CATS interaction domain of CALM was mapped to aa 221-335 of CALM. This domain is contained in the CALM/AF10 fusion protein. CATS localizes to the nucleus and shows a preference for nucleoli. Expression of CATS was able to markedly increase the nuclear localization of CALM and of the leukemogenic fusion protein CALM/AF10. The possible implications of these findings for CALM/AF10-mediated leukemogenesis are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1981826184,"Similarly to many protein toxins, the growth factors fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF-1) and FGF-2 translocate from endosomes into the cytosol. It was recently found that certain toxins are dependent on cytosolic Hsp90 for efficient translocation across the endosomal membrane. We therefore investigated the requirement for Hsp90 in FGF translocation. We found that low concentrations of the specific Hsp90 inhibitors, geldanamycin and radicicol, completely blocked the translocation of FGF-1 and FGF-2 to the cytosol and the nucleus. The drugs did not interfere with the initial binding of FGF-1 to the growth factor receptors at the cell-surface or with the subsequent internalization of the growth factors into endosomes. The activation of known signaling cascades downstream of the growth factor receptors was also not affected by the drugs. The data indicate that the drugs block translocation from endosomes to the cytosol implying that Hsp90 is required for translocation of FGF-1 and FGF-2 across the endosomal membrane. Similarly to many protein toxins, the growth factors fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF-1) and FGF-2 translocate from endosomes into the cytosol. It was recently found that certain toxins are dependent on cytosolic Hsp90 for efficient translocation across the endosomal membrane. We therefore investigated the requirement for Hsp90 in FGF translocation. We found that low concentrations of the specific Hsp90 inhibitors, geldanamycin and radicicol, completely blocked the translocation of FGF-1 and FGF-2 to the cytosol and the nucleus. The drugs did not interfere with the initial binding of FGF-1 to the growth factor receptors at the cell-surface or with the subsequent internalization of the growth factors into endosomes. The activation of known signaling cascades downstream of the growth factor receptors was also not affected by the drugs. The data indicate that the drugs block translocation from endosomes to the cytosol implying that Hsp90 is required for translocation of FGF-1 and FGF-2 across the endosomal membrane. FGF-1 3The abbreviations used are: FGF, fibroblast growth factor; FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; Hsp90, heat shock protein 90; TPCK, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 3The abbreviations used are: FGF, fibroblast growth factor; FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; Hsp90, heat shock protein 90; TPCK, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. and FGF-2 bind to and activate FGFRs on the surface of target cells. Several downstream signaling cascades such as the Ras/MAPK, phospholipase C-γ/PKC, and PI 3-kinase/Akt pathways are then initiated (1Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3500) Google Scholar). FGF signaling is important in several cellular processes such as proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, survival, and differentiation (2Mason I.J. Cell. 1994; 78: 547-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 3Wiedl/ocha A. Sorensen V. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 286: 45-79PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, FGF-1 and FGF-2 have the peculiar ability to translocate through the endosomal membrane into the cytosol and then be transported into the nucleus (4Olsnes S. Klingenberg O. Wiedl/ocha A. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 163-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Several laboratories have presented data indicating that the nuclear targeting is involved in the proliferation of cells. Thus, elimination of the N-terminal nuclear localization signal of FGF-1 resulted in considerably reduced mitogenic activity even if binding and activation of the receptors was not much changed (5Imamura T. Engleka K. Zhan X. Tokita Y. Forough R. Roeder D. Jackson A. Maier J.A. Hla T. Maciag T. Science. 1990; 249: 1567-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). When FGF-1 was introduced into the cytosol as a fusion protein with diphtheria toxin, it stimulated DNA synthesis in cells lacking FGFRs arguing for an intracellular role of the growth factor (6Wiedl/ocha A. Falnes P.O. Madshus I.H. Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Cell. 1994; 76: 1039-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Similarly, nuclear FGF-2 has been shown to activate rDNA transcription and to be associated with cell proliferation (7Bouche G. Gas N. Prats H. Baldin V. Tauber J.P. Teissie J. Amalric F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6770-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 8Bailly K. Soulet F. Leroy D. Amalric F. Bouche G. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Nuclear FGF-2 has also been proposed to be involved in the survival of carcinoma cells important for lung metastasis (9Thomas-Mudge R.J. Okada-Ban M. Vandenbroucke F. Vincent-Salomon A. Girault J.M. Thiery J.P. Jouanneau J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4771-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We recently found that after endocytosis by the specific FGFRs, FGF-1 and -2 translocate from endosomes into the cytosol (10Mal/ecki J. Wiedl/ocha A. Wesche J. Olsnes S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4480-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 11Mal/ecki J. Wesche J. Skjerpen C.S. Wiedl/ocha A. Olsnes S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 801-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The positive inside membrane potential was found to be crucial for translocation across the endosomal membrane. Furthermore, we have shown that FGF-1 is then transported further from the cytosol to the nucleus by the concerted action of two nuclear localization signals (12Wesche J. Mal/ecki J. Wiedl/ocha A. Ehsani M. Marcinkowska E. Nilsen T. Olsnes S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6071-6081Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the nucleus FGF-1 is phosphorylated by PKCδ and then rapidly exported to the cytosol by a leptomycin B-sensitive protein, probably exportin-1, and subsequently degraded (13Wiedl/ocha A. Nilsen T. Wesche J. Sorensen V. Mal/ecki J. Marcinkowska E. Olsnes S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 794-810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the translocation of FGF-1 is prevented by PI 3-kinase inhibitors suggesting that it is regulated by signaling events (14Klingenberg O. Wiedl/ocha A. Citores L. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11972-11980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Another class of proteins that are endocytosed and translocated from endosomes are certain protein toxins. They have targets in the cytosol and need to translocate an enzymatic moiety into the host cells. Several of them, e.g. anthrax and diphtheria toxin, utilize the low pH in endosomes to trigger translocation (15Wesche J. Elliott J.L. Falnes P.O. Olsnes S. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15737-15746Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 16Sandvig K. Olsnes S. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 828-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was recently found that efficient translocation of diphtheria toxin catalytic domain requires the cytosolic chaperone Hsp90 (17Ratts R. Zeng H. Berg E.A. Blue C. McComb M.E. Costello C.E. vanderSpek J.C. Murphy J.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1139-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Hsp90 has also been shown to be essential for the translocation of Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin and iota-like toxins (18Haug G. Leemhuis J. Tiemann D. Meyer D.K. Aktories K. Barth H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32266-32274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 19Haug G. Aktories K. Barth H. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 3066-3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In light of the recent findings that certain toxins depend on Hsp90 for efficient translocation from endosomes to cytosol, we decided to investigate whether transport of FGF-1 and FGF-2 is also dependent on this chaperone. We here demonstrate that Hsp90 inhibitors completely block the translocation of the growth factors from endosomes to the cytosol. Materials, Media, and Buffers—[35S]Methionine (1000 Ci/mmol), [33P]phosphate (3000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Geldanamycin was obtained from Calbiochem, and radicicol was from Sigma. Recombinant FGF-1 was prepared as described previously (20Wesche J. Wiedl/ocha A. Falnes P.O. Choe S. Olsnes S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15091-15100Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The following buffers were used: HEPES medium, bicarbonate- and serum-free Eagle's minimal essential medium buffered with HEPES to pH 7.4; dialysis buffer, 140 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, and 2 mm CaCl2, adjusted to pH 7.0 with NaOH; lysis buffer, 0.1 m NaCl, 20 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, pH 7.4; PBS, 140 mm NaCl and 10 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4. Cell Cultures—NIH/3T3 and HUVE cells were propagated as earlier described (6Wiedl/ocha A. Falnes P.O. Madshus I.H. Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Cell. 1994; 76: 1039-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded into tissue culture plates the day preceding the experiments. In Vitro Transcription and Translation—Plasmid DNA was linearized downstream of the encoding gene and transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase as described (21McGill S. Stenmark H. Sandvig K. Olsnes S. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2843-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The mRNA was precipitated with ethanol and dissolved in H2O containing 10 mm dithiothreitol and 0.1 unit/μl RNasin. The translation was performed for 1 h at 30 °C in micrococcal nuclease treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Madison, WI). Radioactive proteins were prepared in lysates containing 1 μm [35S]methionine and a 25 μm concentration of the other 19 amino acids. Labeled methionine was replaced by 25 μm unlabeled methionine when nonradioactive proteins were synthesized. The amount of protein in the nonlabeled lysates was estimated as earlier described (22Stenmark H. Afanasiev B.N. Ariansen S. Olsnes S. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) by translating in parallel a small aliquot of the lysate in the presence of 5 μm [35S]methionine. The lysates were finally dialyzed against PBS to remove free [35S]methionine and reducing agents. SDS-PAGE—Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate was carried out in 13.5% gels as described by Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206514) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the gel was fixed for 30 min in 27% methanol, 4% acetic acid and then incubated for 30 min in 1 m sodium salicylate, 2% glycerol, pH 5.8. Kodak XAR-5 film was exposed to the dried gel at − 80 °C. Binding of125I-Labeled FGF-1—Confluent NIH/3T3 cells growing on 12-well gelatinized microtiter plates were washed twice with ice-cold binding buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.2% gelatin, and 10 units of heparin per ml). Cells were incubated with 125I-FGF-1 for 2 h at 4 °C. Then they were washed twice with binding buffer, twice with PBS containing 10 units/ml heparin, once with 0.7 m NaCl, and once with HEPES medium. Cells were lysed in 0.5 m NaOH, and the solubilized radioactivity was measured using a γ-counter (1261 Multigamma, LKB Wallac). Recombinant FGF-1 was iodinated by the Iodogen method (30Fraker P.J. Speck Jr., J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3623) Google Scholar). The specific activity of125I-aFGF was ~ 15,000 cpm/ng. Measurement of Cytotoxicity—NIH/3T3 cells were incubated with increasing amounts of geldanamycin or radicicol for 6 h in HEPES medium without leucine. The cells were then transferred to the same medium containing 1 μCi/ml [3H]leucine and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. The cells were then extracted with 5% trichloroacetic acid for 10 min, followed by a brief wash in 5% trichloroacetic acid, and subsequently dissolved in 0.1 m KOH. The cell-associated trichloroacetic acid-insoluble radioactivity was measured and reported as a percentage of radioactivity incorporated by cells untreated with the drugs. Phosphorylation Assay in NIH/3T3 Cells—NIH/3T3 cells growing in 6-well tissue culture plates (2 × 105 cells per well) were incubated for 24 h in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% serum at 37 °C. The cells were incubated with 25 μCi/ml Na3 33PO4 during the last 15 h and then incubated for 6 h with 100 ng/ml FGF-1 and 20 units/ml heparin. The cells were subsequently washed in PBS, pH 7.4, containing phosphatase inhibitors (100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate). The cells were lysed in P-lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 containing a mixture of phosphatase, and protease inhibitors, pH 7.4). The nuclei and membrane fractions were sonicated and incubated with heparin-Sepharose. To reduce the background of phosphorylated proteins, the heparin-Sepharose with adsorbed material was treated with 2 μg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin for 15 min at 25 °C. (Heparin-bound FGF-1 is exceptionally resistant to this treatment.) The digestion was terminated by washing the beads twice with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride. The adsorbed material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Fractionation of NIH/3T3 Cells—To fractionate the cells, NIH/3T3 cells were incubated with radiolabeled proteins for 6 h at 37 °C and washed with high salt/low pH buffer (2 m NaCl in 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0). The cells were then washed with PBS, and 20 μg/ml digitonin was added to permeabilize the cells. After 5-min incubation at 25 °C, the cells were kept on ice for additional 30 min to allow components of the cytosol to diffuse into the buffer. The medium was recovered and denoted the cytosolic fraction. The remainder of the cells was lysed with lysis buffer and scraped from the plastic to recover nuclei and centrifuged at 15,800 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was designated the membrane fraction. The pellet was washed three times in lysis buffer. After sonicating for 10 s on ice, the lysate was centrifuged for 5 min at 15,800 × g, and the supernatant was designated the nuclear fraction. The different fractions were adsorbed to heparin-Sepharose and subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. MAPK and Akt Activation Assay—Cells were serum-starved for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 0.5% NCS. Then the cells were treated with 10 units/ml heparin and 10 ng/ml FGF-1 or FGF-2 for the indicated period of time, lysed in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-p44/p42 MAP kinase antibodies. After stripping, the membrane was reprobed with antibodies against phospho-p44/p42 MAP kinase. Alternatively, the membrane was incubated with anti-phospho-Akt antibodies, stripped, and reprobed with anti-Akt antibodies. Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy—FGF-1 was labeled directly with Cy3-maleimide (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's procedures. NIH/3T3 cells were grown on Mat Tek tissue culture plates and incubated with or without the appropriate inhibitor for 30 min. Fluorophore-labeled FGF-1 was added, and the cells were further incubated for 2 h. The living cells were then examined with a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope (Thornwood, NY). Montages of images were prepared with the use of Adobe Photoshop 7.0 (San Jose, CA). Phosphorylation of FGF-1 Is Blocked by Hsp90 Inhibitors—When FGF-1 is added to NIH/3T3 cells, it is transported to the nucleus where it is phosphorylated by PKCδ (13Wiedl/ocha A. Nilsen T. Wesche J. Sorensen V. Mal/ecki J. Marcinkowska E. Olsnes S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 794-810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of exogenous FGF-1 can therefore be used as an essay to monitor translocation of the growth factor to the nucleus of the cells. We incubated serum-starved and 33P-treated NIH/3T3 cells with recombinant FGF-1 for 6 h. The cells were then lysed and analyzed for phosphorylated growth factor. As seen in Fig. 1A, lane 2, a band corresponding to phosphorylated FGF-1 was observed. When the addition of FGF-1 was omitted there was no band observed (lane 1). We then added increasing concentrations of the Hsp90 inhibitor radicicol (24Sharma S.V. Agatsuma T. Nakano H. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2639-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 25Roe S.M. Prodromou C. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Already at low concentrations of radicicol (10 nm), the phosphorylated band disappeared completely, indicating that Hsp90 is required for one or more steps in the process leading to phosphorylation of the growth factor. Similar results were obtained with another Hsp90 inhibitor, geldanamycin (GA), which also completely blocked phosphorylation at low concentrations (Fig. 1B). To test whether the drugs interfered with the phosphorylation process as such, we performed an in vitro phosphorylation assay. NIH/3T3 cells incubated with or without radicicol or geldanamycin and treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate to activate PKC were lysed and the active PKCδ was immunoprecipitated with an anti-PKCδ antibody. Recombinant FGF-1 was added to the immunopurified PKCδ in a kinase buffer containing [γ-33P]ATP either in the absence or presence of radicicol, geldanamycin, or other drugs as indicated. As can be seen in Fig. 1C, FGF-1 was phosphorylated by the activated and immunopurified PKCδ (lane 2). When an irrelevant antibody was used, anti-Sumo, there was no PKCδ purified and FGF-1 was not phosphorylated, as expected (lane 1). Addition of either radicicol or geldanamycin did not inhibit the in vitro phosphorylation of FGF-1. Rottlerin, which inhibits PKCδ selectively at low concentrations, blocked the phosphorylation, while the PKCα inhibitor, Gö 6976, did not block the phosphorylation. Taken together, the data demonstrate that the Hsp90 inhibitors do not interfere with the phosphorylation of FGF-1 by PKCδ in vitro. Geldanamycin has been reported to be toxic to certain cells and we tested the toxicity of the drugs in NIH/3T3 cells. First, we checked the morphology of NIH/3T3 cells treated with the Hsp90 inhibitors. No obvious change in morphology of the cells was observed when they were treated for 6 h with 100 nm of the inhibitors (Fig. 1D). We also tested whether the level of protein synthesis was changed in cells treated with the drugs. The cells were treated with increasing concentrations of the drugs for 6 h, and the ability of the cells to incorporate [3H]leucine into trichloroacetic acid precipitable material was used to estimate the rate of protein synthesis (Fig. 1E). Both compounds were toxic at 10 μm, but there was no detectible toxicity at lower concentrations. In our phosphorylation assay only a 10 nm concentration of the inhibitors was used, which is far below the concentration where toxicity was observed. We therefore conclude that the inhibition of phosphorylation of FGF-1 observed was not simply due to toxicity of the drugs. Hsp90 Inhibitors Block Translocation of FGF-1 and FGF-2 to the Cytosol and the Nucleus—Since phosphorylation of FGF-1 takes place in the nucleus, we wanted to investigate more closely at which stage of the transport the inhibition occurred. We therefore chose to add radiolabeled FGF-1 to cells and fractionate them into membrane, cytosol, and nuclear fractions (20Wesche J. Wiedl/ocha A. Falnes P.O. Choe S. Olsnes S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15091-15100Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For this purpose, we used digitonin to make holes in the plasma membrane to let cytosolic proteins leak out into the medium. The medium was then recovered and designated the cytosolic fraction. The remnants of the cells were lysed with 1% Triton X-100 and fractionated by centrifugation into a nuclear and a membrane fraction. We verified first that the fractionation procedure resulted in separation of marker proteins from the different parts of the cell. The membrane markers calreticulin (endoplasmic reticulum) and Rab5 (endosomes) were found mainly, as expected, in the membrane fraction (Fig. 2A). The cytosolic proteins Hsp90 and MAPK were found both in the cytosolic and membrane fraction. That a part of the proteins was found in the membrane faction was expected, since it is recommended to adjust the amount of digitonin used so that only 60-80% of the cytosolic components are released. At higher concentrations of digitonin internal membranes are affected as well. We measured the release of the cytosolic protein lactate dehydrogenase and adjusted the amount of digitonin to induce a release of ∼80% total lactate dehydrogenase. This means that the amount of proteins found in the cytosolic fraction is necessarily underestimated. In addition both Hsp90 and MAPK can associate with the cytoplasmic side of membranes and therefore be part of the membrane fraction. Importantly, the nuclear marker, lamin A, was found only in the nuclear fraction and none of the membrane and cytosolic markers were found in the nuclear fraction. In conclusion, the analysis of marker proteins shows that the fractionation procedure gives satisfactory separation of the three compartments of the cell. The localization of radiolabeled FGF-1 in cells incubated with the exogenous growth factor was then studied using the same fractionation procedure. As seen in Fig. 2B, lane 1, after incubating for 6 h, FGF-1 was found in all three fractions (M, C, N). In the presence of geldanamycin (10 nm) or radicicol (10 nm) FGF-1 was only found in the membrane fraction (lanes 2 and 3). As a control we added LY294002, a PI 3-kinase inhibitor that blocks the translocation of FGF-1 to the cytosol and the nucleus (14Klingenberg O. Wiedl/ocha A. Citores L. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11972-11980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Also in this case (Fig. 2B, lane 4), FGF-1 was only found in the membrane fraction. We also tested the translocation of FGF-2 in the same kind of experiment. When added to serum-starved NIH/3T3 cells, FGF-2 was recovered from the membrane, cytosol, and nuclear fraction (Fig. 2C, lane 1). In contrast, in the presence of geldanamycin the growth factor was only found in the membrane fraction and was absent from the cytosol and nuclear fractions (lane 2). Hsp90 has in some cases been found to stabilize proteins in the cytosol (26Young J.C. Moarefi I. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Thus, when Hsp90 is inhibited by geldanamycin or radicicol, the client proteins of the chaperone have a reduced half-life. We therefore considered the possibility that the lack of FGF-1 in the cytosol and the nucleus could be due to degradation of the growth factor by proteasomes in the absence of functional Hsp90. We therefore tested whether phosphorylation of FGF-1 could be detected in the presence of lactacystin, a proteasome inhibitor. However, as can be seen in Fig. 2D, the addition of lactacystin together with geldanamycin or radicicol did not result in the appearance of phosphorylated growth factor. Reduced stability is therefore probably not the reason for the lack of the growth factor in the cytosol and in the nucleus. Taken together, the data indicate that FGF-1 and FGF-2 are dependent on cytosolic Hsp90 to translocate to the cytosol and the nucleus. Binding and Internalization of FGF-1 Is Not Affected by the Drugs—The drugs could also interfere with the binding of FGF-1 to the FGFRs on the cell-surface of NIH/3T3 cells or the subsequent endocytosis of the growth factor. To measure binding, we incubated NIH/3T3 cells with increasing amounts of 125I-FGF-1 in the presence of heparin. In some cases, we also added 100 nm geldanamycin or 100 nm radicicol to test whether the drugs interfered with the binding. As seen in Fig. 3A, there was no demonstrable effect of the drugs on the binding to the FGFRs. We also tested the binding in a competition assay by incubating cells with 125I-FGF-1 in the presence of heparin and then adding increasing amounts of unlabeled FGF-1. In parallel experiments we added 100 nm geldanamycin or 100 nm radicicol to test whether the drugs interfered with the binding. Also in this case, there was no significant difference in the binding to the FGFRs whether the Hsp90 inhibitors were added or not (Fig. 3B). To analyze whether the endocytosis of FGF-1 was changed in the presence of the drugs, we labeled FGF-1 with the fluorophore Cy3 (27Citores L. Wesche J. Kolpakova E. Olsnes S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3835-3848Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). FGF-1-Cy3 was added to NIH/3T3 cells overexpressing FGFR-1 in the absence or presence of 100 nm geldanamycin or radicicol for 2 h at 37 °C. Intracellular red dots representing endosomes containing FGF-1 was then observed (Fig. 3C). We observed no difference in the endocytic uptake of FGF-1-Cy3 whether the inhibitors were added or not. At the present time it is only possible to see uptake of FGF-1 in cells overexpressing the FGF receptors. Furthermore, the overexpression does not result in increased transport to the nucleus, and it is therefore not possible to convincingly detect FGF-1-Cy3 in the nucleus either. It appears that the drugs do not affect binding and internalization of FGF-1, and the data point to the possibility that it is the translocation of the growth factors from endosomes to the cytosol that is affected. Geldanamycin or Radicicol Does Not Affect FGF Signaling—Cell signaling could be implicated in the translocation of FGF-1 into the cells (14Klingenberg O. Wiedl/ocha A. Citores L. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11972-11980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether the Hsp90 inhibitors altered cell signaling from the FGF receptors. First, we checked whether the stimulation of the Ras/MAPK cascade, which is induced by the intrinsic tyrosine kinase of the activated FGFR, was affected. This was done by probing the phosphorylation status of MAPK using a phospho-MAPK-specific antibody. As seen in Fig. 4A, upper panel, a strong band corresponding to phosphorylated MAPK was observed after 15-min stimulation of NIH/3T3 cells by FGF-1 or -2. This activation of MAPK was similar whether 100 nm geldanamycin and radicicol were added or not. Also after 6-h continuous stimulation with FGF-1 or -2, MAPK was activated, and there was no difference in the absence and presence of the inhibitors. The lower panel is the same Western blot membrane probed with an antibody against total MAPK to demonstrate equal loading. Next, we tested the activation of the PI 3-kinase cascade, which leads to phosphorylation of Akt. After 15-min stimulation of NIH/3T3 cells by FGF-1 or -2, phosphorylated Akt was observed (Fig. 4B, upper panel, lanes 2 and 6). The addition of 100 nm geldanamycin and radicicol did not affect the activation of Akt (lanes 3 and 7). In long term experiments, where the cells were stimulated for 6 h, Akt was still activated but to a lower extent than after 15 min (lanes 4 and 8). In this case, it also appeared to be somewhat less phosphorylated Akt when the drugs were present (lanes 5 and 9). However, the difference is small and only after a long incubation time (6 h). The results in the lower panel indicate that similar amounts of Akt were present in each case. Altogether, the cell signaling events investigated are not much affected by the drugs. It therefore seems unlikely to be a disturbance in signaling that causes the complete block in translocation of FGF-1 and -2 into the cell when they are treated with Hsp90 inhibitors. Time Dependence of Reactivation of Blocked Translocation by Monensin—We have earlier demonstrated that translocation of FGF-1 and FGF-2 to the cytosol is blocked by the inhibitors of vesicle-type proton pumps, bafilomycin A1 and concanamycin A (10Mal/ecki J. Wiedl/ocha A. Wesche J. Olsnes S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4480-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 11Mal/ecki J. Wesche J. Skjerpen C.S. Wiedl/ocha A. Olsnes S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 801-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), probably because the electrical potential (positive inside) across the limiting membrane of intracellular vesicles is required for translocation to occur (Fig. 5A). However, even in the presence of bafilomycin A the translocation can be restored when the cells are treated with the ionophores monensin or nigericin that exchange monovalent cations across membranes in an electroneutral manner. This is probably due to restoration of the membrane potential by activation of the Na+/K+-ATPase present in the vesicular membrane. Thus, the additional treatment with the Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitor, ouabain, prevents translocation under these conditions. Ten nm bafilomycin A1 completely blocked translocation assayed by phosphorylation of FGF-1 (Fig. 5B, lane 2). When monensin was present during the last hour of the experiment the translocation was restored (Fig. 5B, lane 3). Interestingly, it was sufficient to add monensin for the last 15 min to obtain efficient translocation (Fig. 5B, lane 5). Treatment with monensin for a short time period (15 min) was also sufficient to restore FGF-1 translocation, which had been blocked by concanamycin A, another inhibitor of the vesicle-type proton pump (Fig. 5C). The data indicate that during the block of translocation induced by bafilomycin A1 or concanamycin A, the growth factor accumulates in intracellular vesicles where it is unable to exit. Upon addition of monensin, the growth factor is rapidly translocated to the cytosol, presumably due to restoration of the membrane potential across the vesicular membrane. We used this assay to test the time required for the Hsp90 inhibitors to block the membrane translocation step in the internalization pathway. The outline of the experiment is showed in Fig. 6A. Radiolabeled FGF-1 was added to cells in the absence (Fig. 6B, lane 1) or in the presence of bafilomycin (lanes 2-5) to inhibit translocation and allow accumulation of the growth factor in endosomes. Monensin was then added to relieve the block in translocation and, as expected, FGF-1 was now also found in the cytosolic and nuclear fractions (lane 3). When geldanamycin or radicicol was added as late as 30 min before monensin, the translocation into the cytosol and the nucleus was still completely blocked (lanes 4 and 5). As an internal control, there was no FGF-1 in the cytosolic or nuclear fraction when LY294002, a PI 3-kinase inhibitor, which blocks FGF-1 translocation (14Klingenberg O. Wiedl/ocha A. Citores L. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11972-11980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), was added (lane 6). These results indicate that the Hsp90 inhibitors block the membrane translocation step as such and not earlier events. Here we have provided evidence that Hsp90 is crucial for the translocation of FGF-1 and FGF-2 across cellular membranes. More specifically, it seems to be the membrane translocation from endosomes into the cytosol that requires Hsp90. The effect of Hsp90 inhibitors on different steps in the uptake pathway taken by FGF-1 to reach the nucleus was studied. Neither the initial binding of the growth factors to the FGF receptors nor the endocytosis of FGF-1 was affected by the Hsp90 inhibitors. FGF-1 and FGF-2 seemed to be trapped in endosomes in the presence of the Hsp90 inhibitors. It therefore appears that it is the actual translocation across the endosomal membrane that is affected when Hsp90 is inhibited. We have previously shown that FGF translocation is dependent on signaling by PI 3-kinase (14Klingenberg O. Wiedl/ocha A. Citores L. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11972-11980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Hsp90 is involved in the stability of Akt, which acts downstream of PI 3-kinase activation. The effect of Hsp90 inhibition on translocation could therefore be indirect by interfering with the signaling from the FGFRs. However, we could not detect much change in signaling in cells treated with the inhibitors. Furthermore, when cells were treated with the inhibitors for a short time period (1 h), in the monensin-“pulse” experiments (Fig. 6), the translocation was still inhibited. We therefore think that the block of translocation by Hsp90 inhibitors is unlikely to be due to interference with signal transduction. Geldanamycin and radicicol both inhibit the intrinsic ATPase activity of Hsp90 necessary for the proper function of the chaperone (26Young J.C. Moarefi I. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Hsp90 binds generally to substrate proteins in the near native state and are not like many other chaperones thought as being involved in nascent protein folding. We have earlier provided evidence that FGF-1 does not unfold to a large extent during translocation, but it was not excluded that FGF-1 could assume a “molten globule” state that could more easily pass through the hydrophobic membrane bilayer (20Wesche J. Wiedl/ocha A. Falnes P.O. Choe S. Olsnes S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15091-15100Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, Hsp90 could potentially aid in the refolding to a native state after translocation to the cytosol. However, since we could not detect even traces of FGF-1 in the cytosol when cells were treated with the Hsp90 inhibitors, it appears more likely that Hsp90 is required at a step in the translocation across the membrane before eventual refolding in the cytosol. Hsp90 could be directly involved in the translocation of FGF across the membrane. In a generic membrane translocation system, the protein to be translocated is first targeted to the cis side of the membrane to a translocon (28Schnell D.J. Hebert D.N. Cell. 2003; 112: 491-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The polypeptide is then translocated across the membrane through a translocon. Often, chaperones are involved in the translocation process on the trans side of the membrane. For instance, the proper function of the ER translocon is dependent on the ER lumenal chaperone Bip, which is involved in the movement of the polypeptide chain across the membrane (29Brodsky J.L. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Chaperones also assist in the correct folding of the protein on the trans side of the membrane (28Schnell D.J. Hebert D.N. Cell. 2003; 112: 491-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In mitochondrial translocation, the chaperone mtHsp70 plays a similar role, and in chloroplast translocation, the chaperones Hsp70-IAP and Hsp93 are involved (28Schnell D.J. Hebert D.N. Cell. 2003; 112: 491-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Also in FGF translocation, mechanistic energy for translocation could be provided by Hsp90. Maybe Hsp90 is directly involved in the pulling of FGF-1 across the membrane. However, we could not detect a direct binding of FGF-1 and -2 with Hsp90 in in vitro studies 4J. Wesche, J. Małecki, A. Wieędłocha, C. S. Skjerpen, P. Claus, and S. Olsnes, unpublished results. . However, if Hsp90 acts as a molecular ratchet similar to Bip in ER translocation, we should possibly not be able to see a stable interaction, since in this case, they only interact transiently. Possibly the FGFs only interact with Hsp90 transiently during translocation through the membrane. Hsp90 protects several client proteins from degradation in the cytosol (28Schnell D.J. Hebert D.N. Cell. 2003; 112: 491-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether degradation of FGF-1 after translocation was the reason for the disappearance of FGF-1 in the cytosol and nucleus when the cells were treated with geldanamycin and radicicol. However, in the presence of the proteasomal inhibitor lactacystin in addition to geldanamycin we could still not detect any FGF-1 in the cytosol or in the nucleus. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that it is the actual translocation across the membrane into the cytosol that is affected by the Hsp90 inhibitors. However, Hsp90 could potentially have an additional role in refolding of the growth factor and protection of FGF-1 from degradation after translocation. It is striking that several toxins also depend on Hsp90 for efficient translocation into the cytosol. For both diphtheria toxin and C. botulinum C2 toxin Hsp90 seems to be crucial for the actual translocation step across the endosomal membrane (17Ratts R. Zeng H. Berg E.A. Blue C. McComb M.E. Costello C.E. vanderSpek J.C. Murphy J.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1139-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 18Haug G. Leemhuis J. Tiemann D. Meyer D.K. Aktories K. Barth H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32266-32274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Initial binding and endocytosis did not seem to be affected by the drugs. In the case of diphtheria toxin, Hsp90 was part of a bigger complex involving thioreductase and other chaperones that was proposed to act together in the translocation of the toxin (17Ratts R. Zeng H. Berg E.A. Blue C. McComb M.E. Costello C.E. vanderSpek J.C. Murphy J.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1139-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Perhaps, also in the case of FGF-1, a multiprotein complex may be involved in the membrane translocation. It is interesting that certain toxins and the FGF growth factors seem to utilize a similar system involving Hsp90 for translocation across the endosomal membrane. The Hsp90-dependent translocation system is obviously not developed for the translocation of dangerous toxins. Possibly, the system was developed for growth factor translocation and exploited by toxins for efficient transport into the cell. We are grateful to Anne Gro Bredesen for expert technical assistance.

Protein phosphorylation provides a rapid means of altering the function of a protein in response to changes in the cellular environment. In the case of transcription factors, phosphorylation can alter the activity of these proteins through regulation of their nuclear localization (1Nguyen T. Sherratt P.J. Huang H.C. Yang C.S.

The most serious consequence of this disorder is a heightened propensity to develop glaucoma, with 50% of affected individuals developing this progressively blinding disease. In addition to the ocular findings, patients can present with a variable array of nonocular findings, including dental, craniofacial, umbilical, and cardiac anomalies. In mice, targeted deletion of both Foxc1 alleles results in neonatal lethality, hydrocephalus, ocular and skeletal abnormalities (6Kume T. Deng K.Y. Winfrey V. Gould D.B. Walter M.A. Hogan B.L.

Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), establishing Foxc1 as an essential developmental transcription factor.Previous work in our laboratory has demonstrated that the FOXC1 transcription factor is a phosphoprotein and that amino acid residues 215–366 contribute to a phosphorylation-dependent mobility shift in the FOXC1 protein as detected by SDS-PAGE (13Berry F.B. Saleem R.A. Walter M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10292-10297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Removal of this region prevents this mobility shift and results in a transcriptionally hyperactive FOXC1 molecule. We sought to identify the residues that are phosphorylated in FOXC1 and the kinases responsible for the phosphorylation events. This information can allow us to understand the functional role of FOXC1 by placing it into signal transduction pathways in the cell and to explore how perturbations in these pathways contribute to disease pathologies.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSite-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis of FOXC1 was performed using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as described previously (14Saleem R.A. Banerjee-Basu S. Berry F.B. Baxevanis A.D. Walter M.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 68: 627-641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Mutated FOXC1 cDNAs were cloned into the pcDNA-HISMAX 4b (Invitrogen) expression vector to produce Xpress-tagged FOXC1. The mutated cDNA constructs were sequenced to confirm the fidelity of the mutagenesis reactions.Cell Culture and Transfections—HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). 2The abbreviations used are: FCS, fetal calf serum; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; Ub, ubiquitin; HA-Ub, HA-tagged ubiquitin; IMAC, immobilized metal chelate affinity chromatography; WT, wild-type; CHX, cycloheximide; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; EGF, epidermal growth factor. Transient transfections with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) were performed as described previously (13Berry F.B. Saleem R.A. Walter M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10292-10297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection and then sonicated in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and were stored at –80 °C.FOXC1 Luciferase Reporter Assays—Transcriptional activation assays using a FOXC1-responsive luciferase reporter were performed using HeLa cells as described previously (13Berry F.B. Saleem R.A. Walter M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10292-10297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least three times.Immunoblotting—Cell lysates (15 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and processed for immunoblotting as described previously (15Berry F.B. O'Neill M.O. Coca-Prados M. Walter M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1415-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Xpress-tagged FOXC1 was detected with α-Xpress antibody (Invitrogen) at a dilution of 1:5000. Anti-Erk1/2 and α-phospho-Erk1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology), α-myosin heavy chain (Chemicon), α-hemagglutinin, and α-transcription factor IID (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies were all used at 1:1000. For the detection of endogenous FOXC1 proteins, 40 μg of HeLa nuclear extracts were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and proteins transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. A rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against FOXC1 was diluted to 2 μg/ml and incubated with the membrane overnight at 4 °C. All secondary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:5000 and incubated at room temperature for 2 h.FOXC1 Half-life Determination—HeLa cells were transfected with Xpress-tagged FOXC1 expression vectors. Cycloheximide (CHX) (100 μg/ml) was added to the cells 24 h after transfection or was added to unstransfected cells for the determination of the half-life of the endogenous protein. The cells were harvested, as described for immunoblot analysis, at the appropriate time points. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assays, and protein expression was detected by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described above. Band intensities were determined by densitometry using ImageJ (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij), and FOXC1 levels were normalized to that of ERK1/2 levels. The rate of decay of FOXC1 was determined, as described in Ref. 16Xiu M. Kim J. Sampson E. Huang C.Y. Davis R.J. Paulson K.E. Yee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8890-8901Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, from four independent experiments.In Vitro Kinase Assay—FOXC1 or S272A cDNA fragments corresponding to amino acid residues 249–290 were subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pET28b (Novagen). The recombinant proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified by immobilized metal chelate affinity chromatography (IMAC). HeLa cells were harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1% Triton X-100). One hundred micrograms of HeLa cell extract were incubated with 2.5 μgof recombinant FOXC1 protein, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 0.3 mm ATP in 1× kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, and 10 mm MgCl2) for 30 min at 30 °C. Proteins were denatured by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography and total proteins visualized by Coomassie Blue staining.Ubiquitin Incorporation Assay—To monitor the incorporation of ubiquitin (Ub) into FOXC1 proteins, HeLa cells were co-transfected with 2 μg of Xpress-tagged FOXC1 expression vector along with 2 μgof pMT123, an expression vector expressing influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Ub (generously provided by Dr. D. Bohmann, University of Rochester Medical Center), or an empty HA-tagged expression vector. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection in lysis buffer without EDTA. Because the Xpress-tagged FOXC1 expression vectors also contained an N-terminal His6 tag, IMAC procedures were used to recover recombinant FOXC1. Six hundred micrograms of protein extract were incubated with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen)-agarose for 90 min and then washed four times with wash buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, and 0.05% Tween 20). Bound proteins were removed by boiling in 2× SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.RESULTSWe focused on ERK1/2 as a potential FOXC1 kinase, because it is well established that ERK1/2 activity can regulate growth and differentiation events and because many of the developmental anomalies observed from FOXC1 mutations are suggested to result from impaired differentiation processes (6Kume T.

Using the Motifscan search query from the Scansite data base (29Obenauer J.C. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3635-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar), three ERK1/2 sites were predicted in FOXC1 at residues Thr-68, Ser-241, and Ser-272 (Fig. 1A). These residues were individually converted to alanines by site-directed mutagenesis. Furthermore, a missense mutation that results in a P260R substitution in FOXC1 has been detected in cervical cancers (18Zhou Y. Kato H. Asanoma K. Kondo H. Arima T. Kato K. Matsuda T. Wake N. Genomics. 2002; 80: 465-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid adjacent to Pro-260 at position 259 is a serine; this serine residue was also converted to an alanine and used in our analyses.When the mutated FOXC1 proteins were assayed for activation of a FOXC1-responsive luciferase reporter, we found that T68A, S241A, and S259A had little effect on FOXC1 transactivation (Fig. 1B). In contrast, S272A had less than half the activity of wild-type (WT) FOXC1, suggesting that this residue can impact FOXC1 transcriptional activation. In addition, we found that S272A displayed a marked reduction in the steady state protein levels of FOXC1 compared with WT FOXC1 (Fig. 1C). This effect was reproducibly observed with five independent plasmid preparations, demonstrating that the reduced protein levels of S272A were not a result of a contaminant in the plasmid preparation, and an effect was also observed when S272A was expressed in COS-7 cells (data not shown). The levels of S241A protein were also reduced, indicating that the S241A substitution also affects FOXC1 steady state protein levels but not to the same extent as that of S272A. We co-transfected an Xpress-tagged LacZ expression vector along with WT FOXC1 or S272A and noted that the steady state levels of β-galactosidase expression were equivalent between WT FOXC1 and S272A lysates (Fig. 1D). However, the levels of FOXC1 were greatly reduced in lysates with the S272A substitution, demonstrating that impaired transfection efficiencies do not underlie the decreased levels of S272A.Because S272A had the most profound effect on FOXC1 transactivation and on steady state protein levels, we focused our analyses on this protein. To assess whether the S272A substitution reduced the stability of FOXC1, we measured the half-lives of transfected WT FOXC1 and S272A following treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor CHX in HeLa cells. Because the levels of S272A FOXC1 were markedly reduced compared with WT FOXC1, we utilized a 5-fold excess of S272A protein extract (100 μg) compared with levels of WT FOXC1 extract (20 μg). WT FOXC1 levels decreased upon CHX treatment (Fig. 1E) with a half-life of 65 ± 2 min (mean ± S.D.). The levels of S272A also decreased rapidly upon CHX treatment with a half-life of 47.4 ± 0.7 min (mean ± S.D.), indicating that the S272A substitution significantly reduced the stability of FOXC1 as assessed by a Student's t test (p = 0.0065).We next assessed whether the S272A substitution affects phosphorylation of FOXC1. We utilized a truncated FOXC1-(1–366) expression construct, which allows for a greater resolution of phosphorylated FOXC1 species (13Berry F.B. Saleem R.A. Walter M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10292-10297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Several phosphorylated, immunoreactive bands (Fig. 2A, square bracket) are present in HeLa extracts transfected with WT FOXC1-(1–366); however, the slowest migrating FOXC1 band (Fig. 2A, asterisk) was not present in S272A-(1–366). These data indicate that Ser-272 is itself phosphorylated or is necessary for a FOXC1 phosphorylation event responsible for the shifted band. The remainder of the FOXC1-phosphorylated bands were still observed in the S272A-(1–366) protein, indicating that phosphorylation of FOXC1 still does occur at additional residues. The steady state protein levels of S272A-(1–366) were comparable with WT FOXC1-(1–366) levels (Fig. 2A), suggesting that amino acids 367–553 are required for proteolysis. We constructed a bacterial expression vector producing a 31-amino-acid protein corresponding to residues 259–290 of WT FOXC1 and S272A to be used as a substrate for in vitro kinase assays with HeLa cell extracts. The phosphorylation of S272A was reduced compared with WT FOXC1, indicating that S272 is itself phosphorylated or is necessary for maximal phosphorylation of this region in vitro by protein kinases present in HeLa cell extracts (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2FOXC1 phosphorylation and its role on FOXC1 stability. A, reduced phosphorylation of S272A in vivo. Protein levels of full-length FOXC1 (residues 1–553) or C-terminally truncated FOXC1 (residues 1–366) harboring WT or Ser-272 sequences were analyzed by immunoblotting withα-Xpress antibodies. B, Ser-272 is required for efficient phosphorylation in vitro. HeLa cell extracts were incubated with a recombinant protein corresponding to amino acids 249–290 of FOXC1 or S272A along with [γ-32P]ATP and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gels were exposed to x-ray film to detect 32P incorporation or stained with Coomassie Blue (CB) to monitor input protein levels. C, identification of protein kinases that influence FOXC1 stability in vivo. HeLa cells were transfected with full-length FOXC1-(1–553) or C-terminally truncated FOXC1-(1–366) and treated with the protein kinase inhibitors PD98051 (50 μm), LiCl (20 mm), or Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitor II (JNKII; 20 μm) for 5 h before processing for immunoblot analysis.

DMSO, Me2SO.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To link FOXC1 stability to specific phosphorylation events, we tested the effects of protein kinase inhibitors on FOXC1 steady state protein levels. Treatment with the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase-1 inhibitor PD98059 and LiCl greatly reduced full-length FOXC1 protein levels, indicating a role for MAPK and glycogen synthase kinase 3 signaling in the regulation of FOXC1 protein levels (Fig. 2C). HeLa cells transfected with WT or S272A were then treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) to determine whether activation of the ERK1/2-MAPK pathway affects the levels of FOXC1 protein. As indicated in Fig. 2D, EGF administration increased levels of WT FOXC1 but had no effect on the levels of S272A FOXC1. Because the expression of both FOXC1 constructs are under the control of identical exogenous plasmid-derived promoters, the changes in protein levels observed are likely not to be derived from the changes observed solely in gene expression, rather they are due to an effect on protein stability that is dependent on Ser-272.Next, we determined whether the levels and stability of endogenous FOXC1 protein respond to similar stimuli as exogenous Xpress-tagged FOXC1 protein. HeLa cells were treated with CHX, and FOXC1 protein levels were examined by immunoblot analysis. As indicated in Fig. 3A, the levels of endogenous FOXC1 begin to decline after 1 h of CHX treatment, and little FOXC1 is detected after 3 h of CHX treatment. From three independent experiments, the half-life of endogenous FOXC1 was determined to be 23 ± 6 min (Fig. 3B). The shortened half-life of the endogenous protein compared with that of the exogenous protein (Fig. 1E) reflect the substantially lower levels of endogenous FOXC1 compared with that of transfected, exogenous FOXC1. The levels of endogenous FOXC1 were increased in HeLa cells treated with CHX along with EGF but not in cells treated with EGF + PD98059, indicating that the stability of endogenous FOXC1 is regulated by EGF activation of MAPK pathways (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3Stabilization of endogenous FOXC1 protein by EGF.

This effect was diminished when cells were pretreated with PD98059 prior to EGF administration. Activation by EGF was not observed in cells transfected with S272A, suggesting that this residue is critical for this transcriptional activation of FOXC1 in response to EGF. It should also be noted that growth in 0.2% FCS greatly reduced WT FOXC1 transcriptional regulatory activity (compare Fig. 1B with Fig. 4A). We detected little phosphorylated ERK1/2 in cells treated with 0.2% FCS, whereas ERK1/2 was robustly phosphorylated after 30 min of EGF stimulation (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that ERK1/2-MAPK signaling contributes to FOXC1 transcriptional activation in response to EGF.FIGURE 4MAPK signaling pathways regulating FOXC1 activity and stability. EGF stimulation of FOXC1 transcriptional regulatory activity is dependent on Ser-272. HeLa cells transfected with FOXC1 expression vectors were grown in 0.2% fetal calf serum (FCS) for 48 h. The cells were stimulated for 5 h with EGF (20 ng/ml) or EGF (20 ng/ml) and PD98059 (50 μm) (EGF + PD98059). B, ERK1/2 activation state in response to 0.2% FCS. EGF growth conditions were monitored by immunoblotting with α-phopshoERK1/2 and α-ERK1/2 antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Finally, we sought to determine whether FOXC1 protein stability was linked to the ubiquitin-26 S proteosome pathway. HeLa cells transfected with WT FOXC1 and S272A were incubated with the proteasomal inhibitors MG132 and proteasome inhibitor 1 (PI1). The levels of S272A were elevated in response to MG132 and PI1 treatment compared with treatment with Me2SO (Fig. 5, DMSO). NH4Cl, an inhibitor of the lysosomal degradation pathway, had no effect on WT and S272A. These data suggest that the S272A substitution results in a reduced stability of FOXC1 and its degradation is mediated by the 26 S proteasomal pathway. Because the 26 S proteasome recognizes and degrades proteins conjugated with polyubiquitin chains, we determined whether FOXC1 featured this covalent modification. HA-tagged ubiquitin (HA-Ub) along with Xpress-FOXC1 were co-transfected into HeLa cells, and Xpress-FOXC1 proteins were recovered by IMAC with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose. As indicated in Fig. 6A, numerous high molecular weight α-HA-immunoreactive bands were present in cell extracts transfected with FOXC1 and HA-Ub. When the same Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose-treated extracts were immunoblotted with α-Xpress antibodies, these same higher molecular weight bands along with full-length FOXC1 were present on all extracts that were transfected with FOXC1. Therefore, these data indicate that FOXC1 is conjugated with polyubiquitin in vivo. To ascertain which regions of FOXC1 are required for efficient conjugation of ubiquitin to the molecule, we utilized a series of FOXC1 deletion constructs in HA-Ub conjugation assays. HA-Ub was incorporated into all FOXC1 constructs, except FOXC1-(1–366), where 187 amino acids of the C-terminal region from residue 367–553 were removed (Fig. 6B). These data along with our observations above suggest that the C-terminal region of FOXC1 is essential for efficient proteolysis.FIGURE 5Inhibitors of the 26 S proteasomal pathway elevate steady state levels of WT and S272A FOXC1. HeLa cells transfected with WT FOXC1 or S272A expression vectors were subjected to treatment with inhibitors of the 26 S proteasomal degradation pathway (lactacystin, 10 μm; proteasome inhibitor 1 (PI1), 25 μm; or MG132, 20 μm; all from Calbiochem) or the lysosomal degradation pathway (NH4Cl, 20 μm) for 5 h. FOXC1 protein levels were determined by immunoblotting with α-Xpress, whereas protein loading was monitored by immunoblotting with α-MHC.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 6FOXC1 is ubiquitinated in vivo. A, protein samples from HeLa cells transfected with Xpress-tagged FOXC1 (pcFOXC1) along with HA-ubiquitin (HA-Ub) or an empty HA expression vector were subjected to IMAC to isolate recombinant FOXC1. Incorporation of HA-ubiquitin was detected by immunoblotting (IB) with α-HA antibodies. FOXC1 input levels were detected with α-Xpress antibodies. B, deletion constructs of FOXC1 were used to determine regions of FOXC1 required for efficient incorporation of HA-ubiquitin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn this report, we have demonstrated that FOXC1 is a short-lived transcription factor (t½ < 30 min) that is degraded through the ubiquitin 26 S proteasome pathway. FOXC1 stability and activity is regulated through the ERK1/2 MAPK signaling cascades and is dependent upon Ser-272. Efficient turnover of FOXC1 requires the residues 367–553, which include the C-terminal transactivation domain. This region is either required as a substrate for attachment of ubiquitin moieties or is required for the recruitment of an E3-ubiquitin ligase. We hypothesize that phosphorylation of Ser-272 is involved in modulating protein-protein interactions that regulate FOXC1 stability (Fig. 7). In the stable state, FOXC1 is phosphorylated at Ser-272 by ERK1/2 MAPK. This phosphoserine residue may act to recruit a stabilization factor or prevent the binding of an E3-ubiquitin ligase to the C terminus of FOXC1. Future work aimed at identifying the molecular counterparts that regulate ubiquitination of FOXC1 will be essential in our understanding of FOXC1 transcriptional regulatory activity and stabilization.FIGURE 7A proposed mechanism for regulation of FOXC1 stability by phosphorylation. Two states exist, a Ser-272 phosphorylated/stable state and a Ser-272 unphosphorylated/unstable state. Phosphorylation of FOXC1 by ERK1/2 MAPK-dependent pathways at Ser-272 either prevents recruitment of a degradation factor or recruits a stabilization factor that prevents binding of the degradation factor. This degradation factor may be a ubiquitin-E3 ligase or another protein that recruits the E3 ligase. In the unphosphorylated state, a degradation factor binds to the degron (residues 367–553), which promotes ubiquitination and degradation of FOXC1 through the 26 S proteasome pathway. The sites of ubiquitin incorporation are depicted at undetermined lysine residues on FOXC1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Our previous work has indicated that"
https://openalex.org/W2014111929,"We previously demonstrated that TIMP-2 increases the association of Crk with C3G and via subsequent activation of Rap1 enhances the expression of RECK, a membrane-anchored MMP inhibitor. In the present study, we investigate the mechanism of how the TIMP-2 signal is transduced from the α3β1 integrin receptor to the Crk-C3G-Rap1 molecular complex. TIMP-2 treatment of human microvascular endothelial cells (hMVECs) increased the phosphorylation levels of Src at Tyr-527, the negative regulatory site, through enhanced association of Src with Csk. This results in the reduction of Src kinase activity and dephosphorylation of paxillin at Tyr-31/118, the target sites for Src kinase phosphorylation and also the binding sites for the downstream effector Crk. Such TIMP-2 effects accompany the disassembly of paxillin-Crk-DOCK180 molecular complex and, in turn, Rac1 inactivation. On the contrary, levels of paxillin-Crk-C3G complex formation are not reduced, rather slightly increased, which is consistent with our previous finding. Therefore, TIMP-2-mediated inhibition of Src kinase activity leads to the signaling switch from Rac1 to Rap1, thereby leading to enhanced RECK expression."

However, pretreatment of neutrophils with thimerosal, an organomercury thiosalicylic acid derivative, led to a dramatic increase (>50-fold) in the production of leukotriene B4 and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, significantly higher than that observed after stimulation with calcium ionophore A23187. Little or no effect was observed with thimerosal alone or in combination with either GM-CSF or fMLP. Elevation of [Ca2+]i induced by thimerosal in neutrophils stimulated with GM-CSF/fMLP was similar but more sustained compared with samples where thimerosal was absent. However, [Ca2+]i was significantly lower compared with calcium ionophore-treated cells, suggesting that a sustained calcium rise was necessary but not sufficient to explain the effects of this compound on the GM-CSF/fMLP-stimulated neutrophil. Thimerosal was found to directly inhibit neutrophil lysophospholipid:acyl-CoA acyltransferase activity at the doses that stimulate leukotriene production, and analysis of lysates from neutrophil preparations stimulated in the presence of thimerosal showed a marked increase in free arachidonic acid, supporting the inhibition of the reincorporation of this fatty acid into the membrane phospholipids as a mechanism of action for this compound. The dramatic increase in production of leukotrienes by neutrophils when a physiological stimulus such as GM-CSF/fMLP is employed in the presence of thimerosal suggests a critical regulatory role of arachidonate reacylation that limits leukotriene biosynthesis in concert with 5-lipoxygenase and cytosolic phospholipase A2α activation.

Neutrophils play an important role in natural immunity and function to eliminate microbes and dead tissues. They are also a major cell involved in the acute inflammatory response, since they respond rapidly to chemotactic stimuli and can be activated by cytokines produced primarily by macrophages to perform degradative and phagocytic functions. Upon activation at the site of inflammation, they release lysosomal enzymes and neutral proteinases, reactive oxygen species, including H2O2 and O2˙- (1Segal A.W. Annu. Rev.

Science. 2001; 294: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (3048) Google Scholar). Biosynthesis of leukotrienes involves the release of AA from membrane phospholipids by Ca2+-dependent cytosolic phospholipase A2α (cPLA2α) (4Leslie C.C. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and its conversion into 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid and subsequently leukotriene A4 (LTA4), catalyzed by 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) (5Rouzer C.A. Matsumoto T. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 857-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). LTA4 is then enzymatically converted to LTB4 by LTA4-hydrolase (6Haeggstrom J.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50639-50642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) or to leukotriene C4 (LTC4) by the addition of a molecule of glutathione through the action of LTC4-synthase (7Lam B.K. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 2003; 69: 111-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The site for most of these biochemical events is the perinuclear region (8Luo M. Jones S.M. Peters-Golden M. Brock T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12165-12170Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Regulation of leukotriene production can occur at different levels; the increase in Ca2+ and release of free arachidonate by cPLA2α are fundamental for 5-LO full activation. Specifically, Ca2+ binds to a calcium-dependent phospholipid binding domain (C2) on cPLA2α that triggers its translocation from the cytosol to the membrane of the Golgi apparatus, nuclear envelope, and endoplasmic reticulum, where it can access its phospholipid substrate (9Evans J.H. Spencer D.M. Zweifach A. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30150-30160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). 5-LO activity is enhanced by ATP-dependent phosphorylation, and micromolar concentrations of Ca2+ are required for its catalytic activity and translocation from the cytosol to the nuclear membrane, where it interacts with the 5-LO-activating protein, which facilitates the conversion of AA into leukotrienes by “presenting” the substrate to 5-LO (10Peters-Golden M. Brock T.G. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 2003; 69: 99-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Leukotriene synthesis is characterized by a high cellular specificity, with neutrophils synthesizing exclusively LTB4, since they contain only 5-LO and LTA4-hydrolase. In these cells, LTB4 is also rapidly metabolized into biologically inactive ω-oxidation products (20-OH-LTB4 and 20-COOH-LTB4) by a specific cytochrome P-450 enzyme (11Kikuta Y. Kusunose E. Kusunose M. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68: 345-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A common model for neutrophil activation in vitro has been the exposure to formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), a bacterial chemotactic tripeptide that interacts with a specific membrane receptor (12Snyderman R. Goetzl E.J. Science. 1981; 213: 830-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), but the stimulation with this peptide alone does not lead to formation of detectable amounts of leukotrienes (13Serhan C.N. Broekman M.J. Korchak H.M. Marcus A.J. Weissman G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 107: 951-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The pretreatment of neutrophils with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a glycoprotein that induces proliferation and differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells (14Fleetwood A.J. Cook A.D. Hamilton J.A. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 25: 405-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), results in a “priming” effect on these cells, with consequent increase of the leukotriene production in response to the stimulation with physiological agonists, such as fMLP and platelet-activating factor (15DiPersio J.F. Billing P. Williams R. Gasson J.C. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 4315-4322PubMed Google Scholar). The exact mechanisms through which GM-CSF exerts its priming effects are not entirely known, but there is evidence that this cytokine activates protein kinase C and cPLA2α phosphorylation without increasing intracellular Ca2+ and causes an enhanced release of intracellular AA (16Schatz-Munding M. Ullrich V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 705-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The levels of free AA in cells are regulated by not only the cPLA2α-mediated release from phospholipids but also the deacylation-reacylation cycle that results in reincorporation of free arachidonate into phospholipids by sequential action of acyl-CoA ligase and lysophosphatidylcholine:acyl-CoA acyltransferase (LAT) (EC 2.3.1.23) (17Lands W.E.M.

The initial reacylation of arachidonoyl-CoA (AA-CoA) into neutrophil phospholipids is thought to take place with 1-acyl-2-lyso-phospholipids followed by a transfer of arachidonate by a CoA-independent transacylation to plasmalogen lysoglycerophosphoethanolamine lipids (19Chilton F.H. Fonteh A.N. Surette M.E. Triggiani M. Winkler J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Thimerosal is a water-soluble thiosalicylic acid derivative, mainly used as a preservative in vaccines and various chemicals, which is characterized by the presence of an atom of mercury in its structure (20Elferink J.G. Gen. Pharmacol. 1999; 33: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and has been used to enhance eicosanoid production in cells. It is well known as a sulfhydryl reagent, and it has been hypothesized that thimerosal covalently interacts with sulfhydryl groups present in the active site of target enzymes, including LAT (21Hansch G.M. Gemsa D. Resch K. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 1320-1324PubMed Google Scholar), leading to enzyme inactivation. This organomercurial has been shown to induce intracellular Ca2+ spikes in different cell types (22Thorn P. Brady P. Llopis J. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H.

The work described here suggests that regulation of leukotriene production in the neutrophil involves not only the activation of cPLA2α and 5-LO but also the absolute level of free arachidonate maintained during the activation event. Reacylation of free arachidonate is dependent upon formation of AA-CoA and lysophospholipid substrates and upon LAT activity.

Henson P.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1985; 119: 101-110PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, blood was collected in 3.8% sodium citrate, and, after centrifugation for 20 min at 300 × g, the platelet-rich plasma was removed. The residual blood was combined with 6% dextran and 0.9% NaCl solution, mixed well, and left for about 30 min at room temperature for the red blood cells to settle. The upper layer was then removed and centrifuged at 280 × g for 10 min, layered over a Percoll gradient (42-51%), and centrifuged at 400 × g for 30 min. The neutrophil-enriched layer was collected and then washed in KRPD buffer (4.8 mm KCl, 0.97 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 3.1 mm NaH2PO4, 12.5 mm Na2HPO4, 11 mm glucose). Cells were counted using a hemocytometer counting chamber. Neutrophil purity in these preparations was 95% with usually less than 2% eosinophils and cell viability greater than 98%. Neutrophils were then centrifuged and resuspended in calcium/magnesium-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) at a concentration of 10 × 106 cells/ml and primed with either GM-CSF (1 nm), tumor necrosis factor α (10 ng/ml), or Kdo2-lipid A (100 ng/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. After the addition of CaCl2 (final concentration 2 mm) and MgCl2 (final concentration 0.5 mm), the cells were stimulated with fMLP (10-7m) for 10 min at 37 °C. Thimerosal at different concentrations (5-100 μm) was added for 2 min at 37 °C before fMLP. Final incubation volume was 1 ml.

Samples were diluted with water to a final MeOH concentration lower than 15% and then extracted using a solid phase extraction cartridge (Strata C18-E, 100 mg/1 ml; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). The eluate (1 ml of MeOH) was dried down and reconstituted in 40 μl of HPLC solvent A (8.3 mm acetic acid buffered to pH 5.7 with NH4OH) plus 20 μl of solvent B (AcCN/MeOH, 65/35, v/v). Metabolite Separation and Analysis by Reversed Phase HPLC and Electrospray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry—An aliquot of each sample (35 μl) was injected into an HPLC system, and separation of the different metabolites was conducted using a C18 column (Columbus 150 × 1 mm, 5 μm; Phenomenex) eluted at a flow rate of 50 μl/min with a linear gradient from 25 to 100% of mobile phase B. Solvent B was increased from 25 to 85% in 24 min, increased to 100% in 2 min, and held at 100% for a further 12 min. The HPLC system was directly interfaced into the electrospray source of a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Sciex API 2000, PE-Sciex, Thornhill, Canada) where mass spectrometric analyses were performed in the negative ion mode using multiple reaction monitoring of the specific transitions m/z 319 → 115 for 5-HETE, m/z 335 → 195 for LTB4 and Δ6-trans-LTB4s, m/z 351 → 195 for 20-OH-LTB4, m/z 365 → 195 for 20-COOH-LTB4, m/z 335 → 115 for 5,6-di-HETEs, m/z 303 → 205 for AA, m/z 327 → 116 for d8-5-HETE, and m/z 339 → 197 for [d4]LTB4. Quantitation was performed using a standard isotope dilution curve as previously described (29Hall L.M. Murphy R.C. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 9: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Adenosine released from neutrophils was analyzed by stable isotope dilution mass spectrometry (liquid chromatography/MS/MS). After GM-CSF/fMLP stimulation, cells (e.g. 5 × 106 neutrophils in 0.5 ml) were not lysed but centrifuged (1000 × g, 5 min), and [15N5]adenosine (25 ng; Spectra Stable Isotopes, Columbia, MD) was added to the supernatant. An aliquot (20 μl) was directly injected onto a reversed phase HPLC column (150 × 1 mm, Synergi 4μ Hydro-RP C18 column; Phenomenex), which was eluted at 50 μl/min with a gradient from 95% solvent system C (20 mm ammonium acetate) and 5% solvent system D (MeOH/20 mm ammonium acetate, 20/80, v/v) over an 8-min period to 70% solvent D. Adenosine and [15N5]adenosine were detected by multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) of m/z 268 → 136 and m/z 273 → 141, respectively. A standard curve between 6.25 and 100 ng of adenosine was linear (r2 = 0.99) over this range. Calcium Assay—Neutrophils (10 × 106/ml in Hanks' balanced salt solution) were loaded with 5 μm Indo-1 AM and 0.02% Pluronic F-127 for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed and incubated with or without GM-CSF (1 nm) for an additional 30 min at 37 °C. After the addition of a 1 mm concentration each of CaCl2 and MgCl2, primed cells were pretreated with thimerosal (50 μm) or vehicle 2 min prior to stimulation with fMLP (10-7 m). Cells that had not been treated with GM-CSF were stimulated with the calcium ionophore ionomycin (5 μm). Intracellular calcium changes were monitored by measuring the ratio of the fluorescence emissions at 405 and 485 nm (excitation wavelength 355 nm) in a Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon, Edison, NJ). Gas Chromatography (GC)/MS and Quantitation of Free Fatty Acids— One aliquot (corresponding to 1 × 106 cells) of neutrophil lysate (1:2; H2O/MeOH) was acidified with HCl (70 mm final concentration), and stable isotope-labeled fatty acid standards [13C4]palmitic, [d3]stearic, [d2]oleic, and [d8]arachidonic acid were added. After mixing, samples were extracted with 1 ml of iso-octane. The extract was dried under a stream of N2 and then derivatized by adding 25μl each of 1% pentafluorobenzyl bromide and 1% diisopropylethylamine. After mixing, the vials were incubated at room temperature for 20 min, dried under a stream of N2, and reconstituted in 100μl of iso-octane. Analysis of the samples was performed by negative ion chemical ionization GC/MS (30Hadley J.S. Fradin A. Murphy R.C. Biomed. Environ. Mass Spectrom. 1988; 15: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) on a Finnigan DSQ GC/MS system (Thermo Finnigan, Thousand Oaks, CA), using a ZB-l column (15 m × 0.25-mm inner diameter × 0.10-μm film thickness; Phenomenex). The GC was programmed to increase the temperature from 150 to 250 °C at 20 °C/min, 280 °C at 5 °C/min, and finally 310 °C at 30 °C/min and held at 310 °C for 1 min. The mass spectrometer was operated in the negative ion chemical ionization mode using methane as reagent gas. Data were acquired by selected ion monitoring of the following fatty acids: myristic (m/z 227), palmitic (m/z 255), stearic (m/z 283), linolenic (m/z 277), linoleic (m/z 279), oleic (m/z 281), eicosapentaenoic (m/z 301), and arachidonic (m/z 303). The ions at m/z 259, 286, 283, and 311 were monitored for [13C4]palmitic, [d3]stearic, [d2]oleic, and [d8]arachidonic acids, respectively. Peak areas of each analyte were measured, and the ratio of the area from the fatty acidderived ion to that from the internal standard was calculated for each. These ratios were then compared with calibration curves for each analyte prepared from commercially available standards to calculate fatty acid amounts. Preparation of Microsomes from Human Neutrophils—The isolation of microsomes from human neutrophils was achieved following a previously described protocol for the extraction of LAT from pig spleen membranes (31Kerkhoff C. Kaever V. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 228: 111-127PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, neutrophils, either resting or stimulated, were suspended in LAT homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 20% w/v glycerol) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™; 1 tablet dissolved in 20 ml of buffer) at a concentration of 100 × 106 cells/ml. The cells were disrupted by sonication (4 × 15 s at 4 °C) using a high intensity ultrasonic processor (Vibracell VCX 600; Sonics and Materials Inc., Newtown, CT) equipped with a microtip (3-mm diameter) set at an amplitude of 23% and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to pellet the unbroken cells. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the microsome pellet was resuspended in LAT assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) at a final protein concentration of 10 mg/ml. Protein content was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce), using bovine serum albumin dissolved in 0.9% NaCl as a standard. LAT Activity Assay—Neutrophil microsomes (20 μg) were incubated in LAT assay buffer (200 μl final volume) containing bovine serum albumin (12.5 μm) with AA-CoA (30 μm) and with or without thimerosal (50 μm) for 2 min at 37 °C. A mixture of 16:0a/OH-GPCho and 19:0a/OH-GPCho (50 μm each) was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 37 °C. Samples were then extracted using chloroform/methanol according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (32Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42865) Google Scholar), dried under N2, and resuspended in 40 μl of HPLC solvent A (1 mm ammonium acetate in 60/20/20, MeOH/AcCN/H2O), and an aliquot (30 μl) was injected into the liquid chromatography/MS/MS system. A gradient from 100% solvent A to 100% solvent B (1 mm ammonium acetate in MeOH) was utilized to elute a C18 column (Columbus 150 × 2 mm, 5 μm; Phenomenex) at a flow rate of 200 μl/min. Mobile phase B was increased from 0 to 100% in 42 min and kept at 100% for 23 min. Identification of the different species formed was carried out using a Sciex API 2000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Mass spectrometric analysis were performed in the positive ion mode using multiple reaction monitoring of the specific transitions m/z 496 → 184 for 16:0a/OH-GPCho, m/z 538 → 184 19:0a/OH-GPCho, m/z 782 → 184 for 16:0a/20:4-GPCho, m/z 810 → 184 for 18:0a/20:4-GPCho, and m/z 824 → 184 for 19:0a/20:4-GPCho. The rate of conversion of the lysophosphatidylcholines into the corresponding phosphatidylcholines was expressed as a ratio between the peak areas of the product diacylphospholipid to the lysophospholipid substrate. Leukotriene Production and Thimerosal—Leukotriene synthesis in the human neutrophil can be initiated through different stimuli. In our study, neutrophils (10 × 106/ml) were pretreated with 1 nm GM-CSF for 30 min at 37 °C and then stimulated with 10-7 m fMLP for 10 min at 37 °C. Metabolite production was assessed by liquid chromatography followed by mass spectrometry through measurement of the ion abundances for the specific collision-induced transformations for 20-OH-LTB4, LTB4 and Δ6-trans-LTB4, LTC4, 5,6-di-HETEs, 5-HETE, and AA and the internal standards [d4]LTB4 and [d8]5-HETE. The stimulation with GM-CSF and fMLP resulted in a modest production of total LTB4 (0.24 ± 0.09 ng/106 cells) and 5-HETE (0.22 ± 0.08 ng/106 cells) (Fig. 1A, inset), with total LTB4 corresponding to the sum of LTB4 and the ω-oxidized metabolite 20-OH-LTB4. The small amount of LTC4 detected was probably due to the presence of eosinophils in the cell preparation, since neutrophils do not express LTC4-synthase, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of LTA4 into LTC4. The combination of GM-CSF and fMLP was necessary to achieve a detectable amount of 5-LO metabolites, since the analysis of lysates obtained from cells stimulated with either GM-CSF or fMLP alone did not show any measurable quantity of LTB4 or 5-HETE (Fig. 2). Pretreatment of GM-CSF-primed cells with the organomercury compound thimerosal (50 μm) resulted in a dramatic increase (50-fold) in the synthesis of both total LTB4 and 5-HETE (12.22 ± 0.35 and 10.12 ± 2.52 ng/106 cells, respectively) after stimulation with fMLP (Figs. 1B and 2).FIGURE 2LTB4 and 5-HETE production in human neutrophils. Total LTB4 (LTB4 + 20-OH-LTB4) and 5-HETE production in human neutrophils (10 × 106/ml) stimulated with GM-CSF (1 nm) and fMLP (10-7 m) in the presence and the absence of thimerosal (50 μm) is indicated. 5-LO metabolites were analyzed by reversed phase HPLC followed by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry, and absolute quantities were calculated through relative abundances of the specific ion transition relative to deuterium-labeled internal standard. Values are expressed as mean ± S.E. (n = 5), with each sample run in duplicate n.d., not detected.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Thimerosal alone or with GM-CSF did not induce the synthesis of detectable amounts of 5-LO metabolites, whereas the combination of thimerosal and fMLP yielded an increase in synthesis compared with samples from cells stimulated with GM-CSF and fMLP (0.81 ± 0.13 and 2.4 ± 0.3 ng/106 cells for LTB4 and 5-HETE, respectively) (Fig. 2), in agreement with previously published data (26Hatzelmann A. Haurand M. Ullrich V. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 39: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The dramatic effects on leukotriene synthesis observed when neutrophils were primed with GM-CSF and stimulated with fMLP in the presence of thimerosal suggested that full cell stimulation and activation of cPLA2α and 5-LO were required for this organomercury compound to exert its activity. The translocation of cytosolic 5-LO to nuclear membranes was also assessed in GM-CSF/fMLP-challenged neutrophils in the presence and absence of thimerosal (50 μm) by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Thimerosal treatment led to a substantial increase in membrane associated 5-LO, comparable with A23187-treated cells (see supplemental Fig. 1). The production of 5-LO metabolites in the presence of GM-CSF, fMLP, and thimerosal was induced very rapidly, with a maximal production of eicosanoids observed already at 3 min following the addition of fMLP (data not shown), and this level of total LTB4 did not change after 30 min. In subsequent experiments, cells were challenged for 10 min to be able to make comparisons with other stimuli, such as ionomycin, that require longer incubation times. Surprisingly, the absolute quantity of leukotriene production in thimerosal-treated neutrophils was higher than that observed when these cells were challenged with the calcium ionophore A23187 (8.08 ± 0.74 ng/106 cells). The same increase in leukotriene production by thimerosal was observed when neutrophils were primed with tumor necrosis factor α or Kdo2-lipid A (bacterial endotoxin) and challenged with fMLP (Table 1). This effect of increasing LTB4 production in activated neutrophils was also observed in the presence of other sulfhydryl-modifying reagents such as p-chloromercuribenzoic acid and Alexa Fluor phenylmercury (data not shown).TABLE 1LTB4 synthesis in human neutrophils Human neutrophils (10 × 106/ml) were stimulated with fMLP (10-7 m, 10 min at 37 °C) after priming with GM-CSF (1 nm), tumor necrosis factor α (10 ng/ml), or Kdo2-lipid A (100 ng/ml) (30 min at 37 °C) in the presence or absence of thimerosal (5-100 μm). Thimerosal was added 2 min before stimulation with fMLP. Alternatively, cells were stimulated with A23187 or ionomycin (5 μm, 10 min at 37 °C) after 2 min of thermal equilibration at 37 °C. After the addition of the internal standards [d4]LTB4 and [d8]5-HETE, samples were extracted using a C18 solid phase extraction cartridge, and metabolites were analyzed by reversed phase HPLC followed by electrospray ionization-ma"

It is well known that many substrates carry multiple lysines that can be ubiquitinated. However, it has seldom been addressed whether one lysine is preferred for ubiquitin conjugation when all other lysines exist. Here we studied the mechanism underlying ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Rpn4, a transcription activator of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteasome genes. We found that the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Rpn4 can be mediated by six different lysines. Interestingly, we showed through in vivo and in vitro assays that lysine 187 is selected for ubiquitination when all other lysines are available. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a preferential ubiquitination site chosen from a group of lysines susceptible for ubiquitination. We further demonstrated that lysine 187 and a proximal acidic domain constitute a portable degradation signal. The implications of our data are discussed.

Science. 2002; 296: 1254-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of a protein substrate is a consecutive process involving multiple enzymes (4Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2920) Google Scholar). Ub is first activated by the Ub-activating enzyme (E1), forming a thioester between the C-terminal carboxyl group of Ub and a specific cysteine of the E1. The Ub moiety of the E1∼Ub thioester is thereafter transferred to one of the Ub-conjugating enzymes (E2). The Ub moiety of the E2∼Ub thioester is conjugated, via an isopeptide bond, to the ϵ-amino group of a lysine residue (Lys) of a substrate or a preceding Ub molecule conjugated to the substrate, the latter reaction resulting in a substrate-linked multi-Ub chain. Most E2s function in complex with one of the E3 enzymes or Ub ligases. A Ub ligase also denotes an E2·E3 complex. Besides this common scenario, multiubiquitination of a subset of substrates also requires a Ub chain elongation factor (E4) (5Koegl M. Hoppe T. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Mayer T.U. Jentsch S. Cell. 1999; 96: 635-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of a specific substrate is mainly regulated through modulation of its degradation signal (degron) and through control of the activity of its cognate E3 (4Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2920) Google Scholar, 6Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The isopeptide bond between Ub and a substrate can be hydrolyzed by deubiquitinating enzymes, which provides yet another layer of regulation for substrate ubiquitination (9Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 189-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Most E3s are grouped into two families (HECT E3 and RING E3) based on their catalytic modules and features of sequence and structure (4Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2920) Google Scholar, 7Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). A HECT E3 can accept Ub moiety from an associated E2∼Ub thioester, forming an E3∼Ub thioester intermediate and acting as a proximal Ub donor to the substrate that it selects. By contrast, formation of thioester between a RING E3 and Ub has not been detected. The precise mechanism by which a RING E3 catalyzes the transfer of Ub from the E2∼Ub thioester to the substrate is still poorly understood. Many known substrates of the RING E3s carry multiple lysines that can be ubiquitinated (10Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 11Nakamura S. Roth J.A. Mukhopadhyay T. Mol. Cell.

It is unclear whether one lysine is preferred for Ub conjugation when all other lysines susceptible for ubiquitination are also available in the substrate. This question remains one of the central issues in regard to the mechanism of substrate ubiquitination by the RING E3s. It is also uncertain whether or not formation of multiple Ub chains is required for substrate degradation by the proteasome. Failure to address this problem partly results from biased experimental designs that emphasized the essential but not the sufficient lysine for substrate ubiquitination and degradation. Rpn4 (also named Son1 and Ufd5) is a transcription activator required for normal expression of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteasome genes (13Mannhaupt G. Schnall R. Karpov V. Vetter I. Feldmann H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 14Xie Y. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3056-3061Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Rpn4 is extremely short-lived and degraded by the proteasome (14Xie Y. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3056-3061Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). These observations and subsequent reports demonstrated that the proteasome homeostasis is regulated by a negative feedback circuit in which Rpn4 up-regulates the proteasome genes and is destroyed by the proteasome (15Ju D. Wang L. Mao X. Xie Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 321: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16London M. Keck B.I. Ramos P.C. Dohmen R.J. FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the proteasomal degradation of Rpn4 can be mediated by two distinct pathways (17Ju D. Xie Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23851-23854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). One pathway is Ub-independent, whereas the other involves lysine ubiquitination. Recently, we demonstrated that the Ub-dependent degradation of Rpn4 is mediated by the Rad6/Ubr2 Ub ligase (18Wang L. Mao X. Ju D. Xie Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55218-55223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Ubr2, a RING E3, is a sequence homolog of Ubr1, the E3 component of the N-end rule pathway (18Wang L. Mao X. Ju D. Xie Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55218-55223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 19Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev.

The Ubr2-mediated ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Rpn4 has been shown to play an important role in controlling the steady-state levels of Rpn4 and the proteasome (18Wang L. Mao X. Ju D. Xie Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55218-55223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the current work, we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the Ub-dependent degradation of Rpn4. We found that the Ub-dependent degradation of Rpn4 can be mediated by six different lysines. Remarkably, among these six lysines, Lys-187 is the preferential ubiquitination site. We further demonstrated that Lys-187 and a proximal acidic domain constitute a portable Ubr2-dependent degradation signal. Yeast Strains and Plasmids—The yeast strains used were JD52 (MATa his3-Δ200 leu2–3, 112 lys2–801 trp1-Δ63 ura3–52) and YXY274 (a ubr2Δ::HIS3 derivative of JD52; see Ref. 18Wang L. Mao X. Ju D. Xie Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55218-55223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Details of plasmid constructs are available upon request. All mutants carrying point mutations and/or deletions were generated by PCR-mediated mutagenesis and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Pulse-Chase and Immunoprecipitation Analysis—S. cerevisiae cells from 10-ml cultures (A600 of 0.8–1.0) in SD medium containing 0.1 mm CuSO4 and essential amino acids were harvested. The cells were resuspended in 0.3 ml of the same medium supplemented with 0.15 mCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Expre35S35S labeling mix, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and incubated at 30 °C for 5 min. The cells were then pelleted and resuspended in the same SD medium with cycloheximide (0.2 mg/ml) and excessive cold l-methionine/l-cysteine (2 mg/ml l-methionine and 0.4 mg/ml l-cysteine) and chased at 30 °C. An equal volume of sample was withdrawn at each time point. Labeled cells were harvested, lysed in an equal volume of 2× SDS buffer (2% SDS, 30 mm dithiothreitol, 90 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5), and incubated at 100 °C for 3 min. The supernatants were diluted 20-fold with buffer A (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5) before being applied to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody (Sigma) or anti-β-galactosidase antibody (Promega) combined with protein A-agarose (Calbiochem) or anti-FLAG M2 affinity-agarose (Sigma). The volumes of supernatants used in immunoprecipitation were adjusted to equalize the amounts of 10% trichloroacetic acid-insoluble 35S. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with buffer A and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography and quantitation with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Pulldown-Ubiquitination Assay—The pulldown-ubiquitination assay was carried out as described previously (18Wang L. Mao X. Ju D. Xie Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55218-55223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Specifically, ubr2Δ cells harboring plasmid 425GAL1FLAGUBR2 overexpressing N-terminally FLAG-tagged Ubr2 from the GAL1 promoter in a high copy vector were grown in synthetic selective medium containing 2% galactose to an A600 of 1.8. Cells were spun down and manually ground to fine powder with a pestle. The pellet being ground was kept frozen by liquid nitrogen. Crude extracts were prepared by incubation of the powder in buffer B (0.2% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) plus protease inhibitor mix (Roche Diagnostics). Approximately, 0.2 mg of crude extract was used for each pulldown. After a standard pulldown, the beads were washed three times with buffer C (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol) and then subjected to ubiquitination reactions containing 100 nm Uba1 and 1 μm Rad6 with or without 7 μm ubiquitin in buffer C at 30 °C for 45 min. The GST fusion proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-GST antibody (Sigma). Rad6 was overexpressed and purified from vector pET-11d in bacteria, whereas N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged Uba1 was overexpressed from YEplac181 in S. cerevisiae and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Ub-dependent Degradation of Rpn4 Mediated by Different Lysines with Lys-187 Being the Most Efficient—Our early work has shown that proteasomal degradation of Rpn4 can be mediated by two distinct mechanisms, Ub-dependent and -independent (17Ju D. Xie Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23851-23854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of the observation that deletion of the N-terminal 10 amino acids substantially inhibits the Ub-independent degron but displays no effect on the Ub-dependent degradation of Rpn4 (17Ju D. Xie Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23851-23854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 18Wang L. Mao X. Ju D. Xie Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55218-55223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we adopted Rpn4Δ1–10 to study the molecular mechanism underlying the Ub-dependent degradation of Rpn4. We first tried to define the lysine(s) required for Rpn4Δ1–10 degradation. Rpn4 possesses 35 lysines throughout its 531-amino acid sequence. Lys-9 was already deleted in Rpn4Δ1–10. Previous study and current pulse-chase analysis showed that the turnover of Rpn4Δ1–10/10R, a mutant of Rpn4Δ1–10 with 10 N-terminal lysines (Lys-47 to Lys-187, referred to the positions in wild type Rpn4, see Fig. 1A) mutated to arginines, was severely inhibited (Fig. 1, B and E), indicating that the major ubiquitination site or sites are among the 10 N-terminal lysines. Note that the band just above the position of Rpn4Δ1–10 and Rpn4Δ1–10/10R represents a phosphorylated form of these two proteins, which is sensitive to treatment with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (data not shown). To determine whether all 10 N-terminal lysines are required for Rpn4Δ1–10 degradation, we constructed two Rpn4Δ1–10 mutants that bear Lys-to-Arg mutations for the first four lysines (N-4R) and for the fifth to tenth lysines (C-6R), respectively. Pulse-chase experiments were carried out to measure the stability of these two proteins. Although C-6R remained unstable, its turnover was much slower than that of N-4R, which was degraded as rapidly as Rpn4Δ1–10 (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that whereas the four N-terminal lysines are dispensable, one or more of the next six lysines (Lys-123 to Lys-187) are essential for wild type level degradation of Rpn4Δ1–10. To determine whether any one of the six lysines (Lys-123, Lys-132, Lys-137, Lys-141, Lys-158, and Lys-187) is sufficient to sustain the degradation of Rpn4Δ1–10 at a normal rate, an individual lysine was added back into Rpn4Δ1–10/10R, and the turnover rates of the resulting mutants were measured by pulse-chase analysis. As shown in Fig. 1D, all Rpn4Δ1–10/10R derivatives carrying one of the six lysines were short-lived (lanes 1–18). Remarkably, the mutant with Lys-187 (Rpn4Δ1–10/K187) was clearly degraded faster than others (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 4–6 with lanes 1–3 and 7–18). The half-life of Rpn4Δ1–10/K187 is ∼3 min, which is similar to that of Rpn4Δ1–10, whereas the half-lives of other derivatives are ∼8 min (Fig. 1, B, D, and E). Thus, the degradation of Rpn4Δ1–10 can be efficiently mediated by any one of the six lysines in the N-terminal region (Lys-123, Lys-132, Lys-137, Lys-141, Lys-158, and Lys-187). Lys-187, however, is the only one that can sustain wild type level degradation of Rpn4Δ1–10. Lys-187 Is the Preferential Ubiquitination Site of Rpn4—The more efficient degradation of Rpn4Δ1–10 mediated by Lys-187 than by other lysines promoted us to examine if Lys-187 is a preferential ubiquitination site. We first sought to compare the ubiquitination efficiency of various Rpn4Δ1–10/10R derivatives that carry one of the lysines from Lys-132 to Lys-187. As the measurement of multiubiquitinated substrates formed in vivo can be complicated because of their degradation by the proteasome and rapid deubiquitination by the deubiquitinating enzymes, we decided to assess the efficiency of conjugation of the first Ub moiety to different lysines added back to Rpn4Δ1–10/10R. To this end, we took advantage of UbK48R/G76A, a ubiquitin mutant that inhibits the formation of a Lys-48-linked multi-Ub chain (21Finley D. Sadis S. Monia B.P. Boucher P. Ecker D.J. Crook S.T. Chau V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5501-5509Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Our early work has shown that the Ub-dependent degradation of Rpn4 is through Lys-48-linked multiubiquitination (17Ju D. Xie Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23851-23854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Moreover, UbK48R/G76A is a poor substrate for deubiquitinating enzymes (22Hodgins R.R.W. Ellison K.S. Ellison M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8807-8812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) such that substrates conjugated with a moiety of UbK48R/G76A can be well preserved in a short pulse-labeling period. Therefore, the ratio of monoubiquitinated to nonubiquitinated species of a specific substrate largely reflects the ubiquitination efficiency at a defined lysine. Cells co-overexpressing UbK48R/G76A with N-terminally HA-tagged Rpn4Δ1–10, Rpn4Δ1–10/10R, or Rpn4Δ1–10/10R derivatives carrying one of the lysines from Lys-132 to Lys-187 were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 5 min. To facilitate the determination of monoubiquitinated substrates, a transformant co-overexpressing N-terminally HA-tagged Rpn4Δ1–10 and N-terminally His6-Myc-tagged UbK48R/G76A (His -Myc-UbK48R/G76A6) was used as control. Substrates conjugated with epitope-tagged Ub have been shown to migrate slower than those with untagged Ub (17Ju D. Xie Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23851-23854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 23Ellison M.J. Hochstrasser M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21150-21157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled cell extracts were incubated with anti-HA antibody, and the precipitated substrates were separated by SDS-PAGE. As expected, a characteristic difference in mobility was observed between the Rpn4Δ1–10 conjugates attached with His6-Myc-UbK48R/G76A and UbK48R/G76A (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 1 and 2). Although no ubiquitinated species of Rpn4Δ1–10/10R was observed, monoubiquitinated species of the Rpn4Δ1–10/10R derivatives were readily detected (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 3 and 4–8), consistent with the observation that any one of these lysines can mediate Rpn4Δ1–10 degradation (Fig. 1D). Remarkably, the ratio of monoubiquitinated to nonubiquitinated Rpn4Δ1–10/K187 was comparable with that of Rpn4Δ1–10 and much higher (∼3–5-fold) than those of other Rpn4Δ1–10/10R derivatives bearing a different lysine (Fig. 2A, lanes 2–8). This observation is in line with the expectation of Lys-187 as a preferential Ub acceptor. Interestingly, monoubiquitinated Rpn4Δ1–10/K187 migrated noticeably faster than the monoubiquitinated species of other Rpn4Δ1–10/10R derivatives, whereas all nonubiquitinated substrates had a similar mobility (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 8 and 4–7), suggesting that the Lys-187-Ub conjugate exhibits a different configuration compared with the Ub conjugates at other lysines. Strikingly, only one type of monoubiquitinated species of Rpn4Δ1–10 was detected based on mobility, and this mobility was the same as that of the monoubiquitinated Rpn4Δ1–10/K187 (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 2 and 8). These observations reveal that Lys-187 is selected for ubiquitination from multiple lysines that could serve as Ub acceptors in Rpn4Δ1–10. It is noteworthy that small but noticeable amounts of Rpn4Δ1–10 and Rpn4Δ1–10/K187 appeared to bear two Ub moieties (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 8). Given that Rpn4Δ1–10/10R was not ubiquitinated, Lys-187 was therefore the only Ub-acceptor in Rpn4Δ1–10/K187. It is likely that the diubiquitinated species of Rpn4Δ1–10/K187 was generated by attachment of an endogenous Ub molecule to Lys-187 followed by conjugation of a UbK48R/G76A moiety to Lys-48 of the preceding endogenous Ub. The detection of diubiquitinated species of Rpn4Δ1–10/K187 but not other Rpn4Δ1–10/10R derivatives carrying Lys-132, Lys-137, Lys-141, or Lys-158 reflects the higher ubiquitination efficiency at Lys-187, further supporting that Lys-187 is the preferential ubiquitination site of Rpn4. To verify the results of the in vivo ubiquitination experiments, we performed a pulldown-ubiquitination assay, which has successfully shown that Ubr2, pulled down by GST fusion of Rpn4Δ1–10 (GST-Rpn4Δ1–10) from yeast extract, multiubiquitinated GST-Rpn4Δ1–10 in the presence of Rad6 and Uba1 (18Wang L. Mao X. Ju D. Xie Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55218-55223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Agarose beads preloaded with GST-Rpn4Δ1–10, GST-Rpn4Δ1–10/10R, GST-Rpn4Δ1–10/K187, and GST-Rpn4Δ1–10/K158 were incubated with extract from ubr2Δ cells overexpressing Ubr2 from the GAL1 promoter in a high copy plasmid. After a standard pulldown, the beads were further incubated with purified Rad6 and Uba1 in the presence (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7) or absence (lane 2, 4, 6, and 8) of ubiquitin (Fig. 2B). The GST fusions were then separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting analysis with anti-GST antibody. As expected, the ubiquitination was specific to the N-terminal lysines of Rpn4 as GST-Rpn4Δ1–10/10R was not ubiquitinated (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4). Consistent with the in vivo ubiquitination assay, GST-Rpn4Δ1–10/K187 was ubiquitinated more efficiently than GST-Rpn4Δ1–10/K158 (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 5 and 7). Moreover, the ubiquitination pattern of GST-Rpn4Δ1–10/K187 was virtually identical to the major ubiquitinated species of GST-Rpn4Δ1–10, which is somewhat different from that of GST-Rpn4Δ1–10/K158 (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1, 5, and 7). The difference in mobility of the monoubiquitinated species of GST-Rpn4Δ1–10/K187 and GST-Rpn4Δ1–10/K158 was also observed in the pull-down-ubiquitination assay (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 5 and 7; upper and lower panels). Taken together, the results from in vivo and in vitro assays demonstrate that Lys-187 is the preferential ubiquitination site of Rpn4, whereas the other five lysines serve as alternative ubiquitination sites. The N-terminal Acidic Domain (NAD) Is Essential for the Ub-dependent Degradation of Rpn4—Our recent study has located the major, if not exclusive, degron of Rpn4 to its N-terminal 229-residue domain (17Ju D. Xie Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23851-23854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To further define the minimal sequences required for the Ub-dependent degradation of Rpn4, we created a series of N-terminally truncated mutants (Fig. 3A). Pulse-chase analysis showed that deletion up to the N-terminal 148 amino acids had no effect on the turnover of Rpn4 (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–12), implying that the Ub-dependent degron was located within residues 149–229. Not surprisingly, further deletion to residue 190 or 205 inhibited the degradation (Fig. 3B, lanes 13–18) as the preferential and all alternative ubiquitination sites were removed. Interestingly, the sequence of residues 211–229 is rich in acidic amino acids, a characteristic of transcription activation domain (Fig. 3A). We suspect that this domain might act as a ubiquitination signal because the ubiquitination signals of transcription activators are often overlapped with their activation domains (24Muratani M. Tansey W.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 1-10Crossref Scopus (677) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we first compared the stability of two truncated Rpn4 mutants containing residues 11–229 (Rpn411–229) and 11–210 (Rpn411–210), respectively, using pulse-chase analysis (Fig. 3C). Whereas Rpn411–229 was extremely short-lived, Rpn411–210 was barely degraded, suggesting that residues 211–229 serve as a ubiquitination signal in Rpn411–229. We then examined the role of residues 211–229 in the context of Rpn4Δ1–10. Sequence analysis showed that Rpn4 carries two domains rich in acidic amino acids (Fig. 3A). NAD consists of residues 211–229, whereas the C-terminal acidic domain (CAD) lies between residues 300–312. We, therefore, generated two mutants from Rpn4Δ1–10 via internal deletion of residues 211–229 and 291–313, respectively (Fig. 3A). Remarkably, pulse-chase analysis showed that deletion of NAD but not CAD inhibited the degradation of Rpn4Δ1–10 (Fig. 3D, compare lanes 1–3 with 4–6), indicating that NAD is required for the Ub-dependent degradation of Rpn4. The proximal position of NAD to Lys-187 may functionally distinguish itself from CAD. To examine whether NAD also plays a role in the Ub-independent degradation of Rpn4, we deleted NAD in the context of full-length Rpn4 and measured the turnover of Rpn4Δ211–229 by pulse-chase analysis. As shown in Fig. 3D (lanes 7–9), deletion of NAD displayed no effect on the Ub-independent degradation of Rpn4, indicating that NAD is specific for the Ub-dependent degradation of Rpn4. Lys-187 and NAD Constitute a Portable Ubr2-dependent Degron—A Ub-dependent degron is composed of a ubiquitination site and a ubiquitination signal, usually a short primary sequence or a structural feature recognized by a specific Ub ligase. The identification of Lys-187 as the preferential ubiquitination site and NAD as an essential sequence for the Ub-dependent degradation of Rpn4 prompted us to determine whether Lys-187 and NAD (including minimal flanking sequences) constitute a sufficient degron. To this end, we fused residues 172–229 of Rpn4 to the otherwise stable β-galactosidase reporter protein and measured the stability of the resulting fusion protein Rpn4172–9-β-galactosidase. As shown in Fig. 4 (lanes 1–4), Rpn4172–229-β-galactosidase Ubr2 was rapidly degraded, indicating that Lys-187 and NAD do form a sufficient and portable degron. Interestingly, substitution of Lys-187 with arginine inhibited the degradation of Rpn4172–229-β-galactosidase (Fig. 4, lanes 9–12), indicating that the implanted Lys-187 functions as the ubiquitination site in the fusion protein. To rule out the possibility that a cryptic degron was created in the Rpn4172–229-β-galactosidase fusion, we evaluated the stability of Rpn4172–229-β-galactosidase in ubr2Δ, where Ubr2, the cognate Ub ligase for Rpn4, was absent. Pulse-chase analysis revealed that Rpn4172–229-β-galactosidase was stabilized in the ubr2Δ mutant (Fig. 4, lanes 5–8). Thus, Lys-187 and NAD constitute a portable degron specifically targeted by Ubr2. We postulate that NAD acts as the ubiquitination signal. Lysine selection by the RING E3s is a central question in the field of protein ubiquitination. Although several models exemplified by the “effective concentration” and the “hit-and-run” models have been proposed to explain the process of lysine selection (25Deffenbaugh A.E. Scaglione K.M.

Pagano M. Pavletich N. Nature. 2000; 408: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), these models can only interpret the data of ubiquitination of one substrate but not the other. It is well known that many substrates of the Ub-proteasome system can be ubiquitinated at multiple lysines. However, in every case that we are aware of, it has never been determined if one lysine is preferred when all other lysines are also available. Extensive analysis of several substrates including Gcn4, p53, and c-Jun show that no single Lys-to-Arg substitution affects protein degradation, suggesting that it is rather nonselective with respect to which lysine of these substrates is ubiquitinated (11Nakamura S. Roth J.A. Mukhopadhyay T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9391-9398Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 12Kornitzer D. Raboy B. Kulka R.G. Fink G.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6021-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 29Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). However, strictly speaking, this type of analysis only demonstrates whether one of the lysines is essential for substrate ubiquitination but is unable to define a potential preferential ubiquitination site. Using an approach of adding back individual lysines to a lysine-free Sic1 allele, Petroski and Deshaies (10Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that each one of the six N-terminal lysines is ubiquitinated and is sufficient to mediate the degradation of Sic1. Although these authors showed that the Ub chains attached at different N-terminal lysines influence the rate of in vitro proteasomal proteolysis, the in vivo half-lives of the Sic1 mutants carrying different lysines are quite similar (10Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether one of these N-terminal lysines of Sic1 behaves as a preferred ubiquitination site. Using a similar “adding-back” approach, we identified six lysines in the N-terminal domain of Rpn4, each of which was able to sustain the degradation of Rpn4. Remarkably, among these six lysines, Lys-187 was ubiquitinated more efficiently than the others, and the turnover rate of Rpn4 via Lys-187 was also markedly higher than that by other individual lysines. Consistently, Lys-187 and NAD constitute an efficient and portable Ubr2-dependent degron. More importantly, both in vivo and in vitro ubiquitination assays demonstrated that Lys-187 is selected for ubiquitination when all other lysines are also available. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a preferential ubiquitination site that is selected from a group of lysines susceptible for ubiquitination in a substrate. It is currently unclear how the Ub ligase Ubr2/Rad6 selects Lys-187 over other lysines. One possibility is that Lys-187 is proximally positioned to the active center of the Ubr2/Rad6 Ub ligase, as the primary sequence of Rpn4 suggests that Lys-187 is closer to the NAD ubiquitination signal than other lysines. Further investigation of the molecular details of Rpn4 ubiquitination, e.g. deciphering the atomic structure of the Ubr2·Rad6·Rpn4 complex, will shed new light on the general mechanism of lysine selection. It remains an open question whether the presence of multiple Ub chains on a protein substrate is essential for its degradation by the proteasome. Our current study demonstrates that the Ub-dependent degradation of Rpn4 can be mediated efficiently by six individual lysines. Consistent with our data, a recent report has shown that each one of the six N-terminal lysines is sufficient for the degradation of Sic1 (10Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that a single multi-Ub chain is sufficient to sustain efficient degradation of at least a subset of proteasomal substrates. What would be the physiological meaning of having multiple Ub chains on a substrate? Given the presence of multiple Ub chain receptors including the intrinsic proteasome subunits (Rpn10 and Rpt5) and proteasome-associated UBA domain proteins in the cell (30Madura K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 637-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), it is likely that multiple Ub chains may slow the dissociation of a substrate from the proteasome, providing the proteasome with sufficient time to unfold and translocate the substrate into the proteolytic chamber. This high affinity conferred by multiple Ub chains, although not an absolute requirement for the degradation of some substrates such as Rpn4 and Sic1, may be essential for others, especially those that are difficult to unfold. We reason that the structural features of protein substrates determine whether a single Ub chain is enough or multiple Ub chains are required for their degradation. For instance, a single multi-Ub chain may be sufficient for the degradation of substrates with loosely structured segments such as unfolding initiation sites. We thank Michael Ellison for plasmids."
https://openalex.org/W2004909458,"Ligation of TCRs on stimulated T cells leads to activation-induced cell death (AICD) resulting in the downregulation of immune responses, a process essential for T-cell homeostasis. In this study, using transformed T-cell lines such as Jurkat and Do11.10 as cellular models of TCR-mediated AICD, we have demonstrated that the proapoptotic protein Siva-1 is required for TCR-induced apoptosis. Knockdown of Siva-1 rendered T cells specifically resistant to anti-CD3 but not Fas-induced apoptosis. Further, we observed that in Siva-1 knockout Jurkat cells, TCR-mediated activation of the canonical and non-canonical limbs of the NF-kappaB pathway are significantly enhanced as reflected by elevated nuclear levels of p65 and RelB, respectively. In addition, loss of endogenous Siva-1 also resulted in the enhanced expression of NF-kappaB- responsive anti-apoptotic genes such as Bcl-xL and c-FLIP. Interestingly, the c-FLIP(short) was detected only in TCR-ligated Siva-1 knockdown Jurkat cells. These results demonstrate a significant role for endogenous Siva-1, through its inhibitory effect on NF-kappaB activity, in TCR-mediated AICD with implications in peripheral tolerance, T-cell homeostasis and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2028131556,"The tumor suppressor p14/p19(ARF) regulates Mdm2, which is known for controlling the p53 tumor suppressor. Here we report that loss of one allele of Mdm2 in cells that lack ARF resulted in a decreased rate of proliferation, fewer chromosomal aberrations, and suppression of Ras-induced transformation. Moreover, a haploinsufficiency of Mdm2 inhibited spontaneous tumor development in ARF-null mice. Remarkably, Mdm2(+/-)ARF(-/-) mice survived an average of 6 months longer than Mdm2(+/+)ARF(-/-) mice. The spectrum of tumors that arose in Mdm2(+/-)ARF(-/-) mice did not significantly differ from those that developed in mice lacking only ARF. However, the extended tumor latency allowed for the emergence of multiple primary tumors in a third of the Mdm2(+/-)ARF(-/-) mice, as compared to the single tumor type that arose in ARF-null only mice. Therefore, a decrease in Mdm2 levels restored regulation of critical cellular processes that are altered during transformation and that occur in the absence of ARF. Our findings also indicate that Mdm2 can function independently from ARF and imply that targeting Mdm2 in tumors that lack ARF expression should be an effective therapeutic approach."

(10Sato N. Sato M. Nakayama M. Saitoh R. Arai K. Masai H. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), Cdc7 does not have any known NLS. It was initially suggested that Dbf4 binds and transports Cdc7 into the nucleus (11Marx J. Science. 1995; 270: 1585-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, more recent data have shown that Cdc7 is located in the nucleus even when Dbf4 is not produced (12Guo B. Lee H. Somatic Cell Mol.

Arai K. Masai H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4340-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The Cdc7 protein consists of 11 putative kinase domains that are highly conserved in all known Cdc7-related mammalian proteins (12Guo B. Lee H. Somatic Cell Mol.

Arai K. Masai H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4340-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In addition, there are two kinase inserts: the Kinase Insert II spans from amino acids 203 to 370, and the Kinase Insert III from 440 to 538 (12Guo B. Lee H. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1999; 25: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 15Jiang W. Hunter T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14320-14325Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 16Sato N.

The amino acid sequences of the kinase inserts are the most diverse regions of the entire Cdc7 protein, and thus the inserts are thought to be involved in species-specific regulation and/or interactions with other proteins such as Dbf4 (4Masai H. Sato N. Takeda T. Arai K. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D834-D840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins containing a cNLS are imported into the nucleus by an importin-α/-β heterodimer (18Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar, 19Jans D.A. Xiao C.Y. Lam M.H.

In this transportation mode, the cNLS in a cargo protein is recognized and bound by importin-α through its carboxyl-terminal region, which, in turn, is bound by importin-β via its amino-terminal importin-β binding (IBB) domain. The cargo·importin-α/-β complex is transported into the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) (18Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar, 20Mosammaparast N. Pemberton L.F. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 547-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Several recent data have demonstrated that certain proteins are transported into the nucleus by importin-α alone (21Kotera I. Sekimoto T. Miyamoto Y. Saiwaki T. Nagoshi E. Sakagami H. Kondo H.

Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We examined the regulatory mechanism of human Cdc7 (huCdc7) nuclear transportation using in vitro and in vivo assays. We found that huCdc7 is directly bound and translocated into the nucleus by importin-β. The binding site is mapped to the Cdc7 Kinase Insert II, and the Lys306 and Lys309 residues within this domain are critical for Cdc7 nuclear localization. Most interestingly, importin-α can competitively bind to the Cdc7 Kinase Insert II, and can thus effectively inhibit importin-β-mediated Cdc7 nuclear transportation. Our data also raises the possibility that the binding of Cdc7 to importin-α could be involved in the activation or maintenance of the replication checkpoint in response to cell damaging agents such as irradiation and anticancer agents. Cell Culture and DNA Transfection—HeLa and HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and a combination of penicillin (50 units/ml) and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% Fetal Clone II (HyClone). Cells grown on a coverglass were transfected with plasmids for 12 h using Lipofectamine PLUS™ reagent as suggested by the supplier (Invitrogen) and as described previously (28Guo B. Pearce A.G. Traulsen K.E. Rintala A.C. Lee H. BioTechniques. 2001; 31: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Plasmid Constructs—The pEGFP-huCdc7 and pCMV-huCdc7 recombinant plasmids were constructed by cloning a full-length cDNA encoding the entire human Cdc7 into the SmaI site of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) or into the SmaI-XhoI site of pCMV-Tag2 (Stratagene), respectively. For recombinant protein expression in bacteria, a full-length Cdc7 cDNA was cloned into the SmaI site of pGEX-2T. Various Cdc7 deletion mutants were generated by cloning mutant DNA fragments into pGEX-2T or pGEX-5X-1 vectors (Amersham Biosciences). The plasmids PEVRF-NLS-PCNA and pEGFP-C1-PCNA were a kind gift of Dr. M. C. Cardoso (Max-Delbrück-Center for Molecular Medicine) (29Leonhardt H. Rahn H.P. Weinzierl P. Sporbert A. Cremer T. Zink D. Cardoso M.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The plasmid pGEX-KG-importin-β was a kind gift of Dr. S. A. Kornbluth (Duke University) (22Moore J.D. Yang J. Truant R. Kornbluth S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The plasmids pQE70-importin-α2 (Rch-1/hSRPα1) and pQE60-importin-β were kindly provided by Dr. D. Görlich (University of Heidelberg) (30Gorlich D. Kostka S. Kraft R. Dingwall C. Laskey R.A.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1153-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). pGEX-2T-importin-α2 was constructed by subcloning the DNA segment spanning from BamHI to EcoRI of pQE70-importin-α2 into a pGEX-2T vector. pQE70-importin-α2(ΔIBB; Δ amino acids 1-51) was constructed by subcloning a PCR fragment of pQE70-importin-α2 spanning SphI-BglII into a pQE70 vector. Antibodies—Anti-importin-β (C-19), -α1 (C-20), and -α2 (C-20) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) or the BD Transduction Laboratories (610559 and R43020, respectively); antibodies against MCM2 (N-19), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (PC10), 14-3-3 β (K-19), GFP (B-2), GST (Z-5), GST·fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Z-5), and all secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz. Anti-His tag polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling, and anti-Cdc7 antibodies (K0070-3) were purchased from MBL International (Woburn, MA). Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant GST, GST·Cdc7, GST·importin-β, and GST·importin-α2 proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli (BL21), and were purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B as suggested by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). GST pull-down assays were carried out using beads conjugated with either GST (negative control) or GST·Cdc7 recombinant proteins. Recombinant His-tagged proteins were purified using BD Talon metal affinity resins according to the manufacturers instruction (BD Biosciences) and as described previously (30Gorlich D. Kostka S. Kraft R. Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 383-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 31Kutay U. Izaurralde E. Bischoff F.R. Mattaj I.W. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1153-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Prior to carrying out nuclear import assays, all purified proteins were extensively dialyzed against Nuclear Transport Buffer (NTB: 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 110 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture). GST Pull-down Analysis—Cells transfected with plasmid were lysed at 24 h post-transfection with Lysis Buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaF, 50 mm glycerolphosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol plus 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche) (25Xiao Z. Liu X. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23425-23428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The cell lysates were then incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads pretreated with GST, GST·importin-α2, or GST·importin-β, respectively. To identify the cellular proteins interacting with Cdc7, HeLa cells (108-109) were lysed with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture. Protein concentrations of cell lysates were determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad), and were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads as above. The beads were extensively washed with PBST (PBS plus 0.02% Triton-X100), and the proteins bound to the beads were eluted by Elution Buffer (0.1 m glycine, 0.125 m NaCl, pH 2.8), to which 1.0 m Tris buffer was added to adjust the pH to 7.0. The proteins eluted were concentrated using a Microcon YM-10 centrifugal filter unit (cut-off 10 kDa, Millipore), followed by resolving it with 2× SDS Sample Buffer containing 60 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol. Protein-Protein Interactions in Solution (“Solution Binding Assay”)—Purified recombinant His-importin-α2 or His-importin-β proteins were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with the glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads pretreated with GST·Cdc7. Dot-blot Analysis—Purified recombinant proteins were dot blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences) using a CONVERTIBLE™ filtration manifold system (Invitrogen), and the membrane was then air-dried for 40 min at room temperature. The membrane was “blocked” for 2 h with PBS buffer containing 0.2% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk, followed by incubation with recombinant importin-α2 (1 mg/ml) or importin-β (1 mg/ml) proteins at 4 °C overnight. The membrane was washed three times with PBST for 10 min each, and then proteins bound to the membrane were detected by Western blot analysis. Densitometry was carried out using the QuantiScan version 3.0 (Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Immunofluorescence Analysis—Cells grown on a coverglass were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, and were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 3 min. After being treated with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature, cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. The cells were washed three times with PBS (5 min each wash), and then incubated with FITC- or rhodamine-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG for 45 min at room temperature. Subsequently, cells were washed with PBS, mounted on a slide glass, and then visualized by fluorescence microscopy (Axiovert 100, Carl Zeiss). Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) was used to visualize the nuclei. In Vitro Nuclear Import Assay—Nuclear import assays in digitonin-permeabilized cells were performed as described previously (32Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, cells grown on a coverglass were permeabilized with cold NTB containing 40 μg/ml digitonin (Roche) for 5 min. The cells were washed once with cold NTB, and excessive buffer was removed. Subsequently, the cells on a coverslip were treated with a small amount of nuclear transport mixture and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. A complete nuclear transport mixture contained HeLa cell cytosol (8 mg/ml), recombinant GST·Cdc7 proteins, and an energy generating system (1 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 20 units of creating phosphokinase/ml) and protease inhibitor mixture) (32Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Nuclear import was determined by immunofluorescence using the FITC-conjugated anti-GST antibodies (Santa Cruz). To deplete importin-α2 and/or importin-β, HeLa cell cytosol was incubated with 10 μg of anti-importin-α2 and/or 10 μg of anti-importin-β antibodies at 4 °C for 4 h, which was further incubated for another 1 h with protein-agarose A/G (Santa Cruz). The antibody-importin complexes bound to agarose beads were then removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 2 min. This procedure was repeated three times to completely remove importin-α2 and/or -β proteins. For reconstitution experiments, purified recombinant importin-α2 (0.125 mg/ml) and/or importin-β (0.125 mg/ml) were added to the cytosol depleted of the importins. For the docking assay, recombinant importin-β was used as a source of import factor instead of HeLa cell cytosol, as previously described (30Gorlich D. Kostka S. Kraft R. Dingwall C. Laskey R.A.

Chariot-based Antibody Transduction—HeLa and HEK293 cells grown on a coverglass were transduced with anti-importin-β or -importin-α2 antibodies using a Chariot™ transfection kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Normal goat IgG was used as negative control. At 12 h post-transfection, endogenous Cdc7 was detected by indirect immunostaining with an anti-Cdc7 antibody. Both Importin-α2 and -β Interact with HuCdc7—We wanted to confirm the nuclear localization of tagged Cdc7 proteins at the onset of this investigation because several tagged recombinant Cdc7 proteins were to be used for this work. As expected, GFP·Cdc7 protein was localized in the nucleus (Fig. 1A). To learn how huCdc7 is transported into the nucleus, we analyzed the proteins associated with Cdc7 by a “pull-down” assay using glutathione-Sepharose beads coupled with recombinant GST or GST·Cdc7 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” PAGE and subsequent Western blot analysis of the proteins bound to the beads showed that importin-α2, -β, and MCM2 proteins interacted with Cdc7, whereas PCNA, 14-3-3β and importin-α1 did not (Fig. 1B; data not shown). Because huCdc7 does not contain a cNLS, the binding of huCdc7 with importin-α2 was unexpected. The data shown in Fig. 1B, however, could not distinguish whether: 1) importin-α2 and -β bind to Cdc7 in a mutually exclusive manner; or 2) a classical cargo (i.e. Cdc7)-importin-α/-β complex forms. Subsequent studies showed that the former is true (below). The binding of MCM2 to Cdc7 is consistent with the published data that MCM2 protein is the major physiological substrate of Cdc7 (16Sato N. Arai K. Masai H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4340-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 35Kihara M. Nakai W. Asano S. Suzuki A. Kitada K. Kawasaki Y. Johnston L.H. Sugino A. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5703-5713Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B, MCM2). PCNA, a nuclear protein, and 14-3-3β, a ubiquitous protein, did not co-precipitate with Cdc7, suggesting that these proteins may not interact with Cdc7 at all (Fig. 1B). HuCdc7 Protein Showed Much Higher Binding Affinity for Importin-β than for Importin-α2 at Low Protein Concentrations—To determine whether the classical importin-α/-β pathway mediates Cdc7 nuclear import, we investigated the interactions between Cdc7 and importin-α2or -β using an in vitro pull-down assay. Immobilized GST, GST·importin-α2, or GST·importin-β on beads was incubated with cell extracts prepared from CHO cells expressing GFP, GFP·Cdc7, Cdc7, GFP·PCNA, or GFP·NLS·PCNA. As shown in Fig. 2A, Western blot analysis using anti-GFP or -Cdc7 antibodies suggests that both Cdc7 and GFP·Cdc7 similarly interact with GST·importin-α2 and GST·importin-β, which is consistent with the data in Fig. 1B. GST·importin-α2 specifically interacted with GFP·NLS·PCNA containing a cNLS (PKKKRKV) derived from SV40 T antigen, but not with GFP·PCNA without a cNLS (Fig. 2A, lane 3). This suggests that the GST and GFP tags of these proteins do not affect the interactions between these proteins. Similarly, Sekimoto et al. (37Sekimoto T. Imamoto N. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7067-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) previously showed that GST·importin-α or GST·importin-β fusion proteins did not affect the normal function of the importin proteins. An auxiliary observation of this experiment is that PCNA, which does not contain a cNLS, may be imported into the nucleus by directly interacting with importin-β. However, we did not pursue the PCNA nuclear transportation mechanism further. To analyze the nature of interactions between Cdc7 and importin-α2/-β, we incubated purified recombinant GST·Cdc7 with purified recombinant His-importin-α2or-β. As shown in Fig. 2C, Cdc7 directly interacts with either importin-α2or-β independent of the other importin. The dot-blot analysis using purified proteins also showed a similar result (Fig. 2D). Because the data in Fig. 2C appears to suggest that Cdc7 has higher affinity for importin-β than for -α (compared lanes 3 and 4), we carried out a more detailed dot blot experiment by applying different amounts and molar ratios of purified recombinant His-importin-β and His-importin-α2 onto each dot on a membrane. The membrane was then incubated with GST·Cdc7, followed by Western blot analysis with an anti-GST antibody. As shown in Fig. 2, E and F, the binding affinity of Cdc7 for both importin-α2 and -β is dose-dependent. However, the affinity of Cdc7 for importin-β is significantly higher than for importin-α2 at low protein concentrations. For example, the relative signal intensity of Cdc7 bound to importin-β at the concentration of 0.05 μg/dot was 83 (arbitrary) units, whereas that of importin-α2 at the same concentration was 17 units (Fig. 2, E and F). Furthermore, 0.25 μg/dot of importin-α2 was required to reach the relative intensity of 75 units (Fig. 2F). Considering the fact that the same amount of importin-α2 protein contains twice as many molecules than importin-β (i.e. molar ratio is 2:1 at the same amount of importin-α2 and -β proteins), the binding affinity of Cdc7 for importin-β is ∼10-fold higher than for importin-α2atlow protein concentrations (0.05-0.25 μg/blot). Taken together, the data shown in Figs. 1 and 2 suggest that Cdc7 has high binding affinity for importin-β in the absence or presence of a low concentration of importin-α2, raising the possibility that importin-β is responsible for Cdc7 nuclear import. Importin-β, but Not Importin-α, Mediates Cdc7 Nuclear Import—To test the hypothesis that importin-β is directly responsible for Cdc7 nuclear import, we carried out a series of in vitro nuclear import assays in the presence or absence of importin-β as described below. As shown in Fig. 3A, HeLa cell cytosol can effectively transport Cdc7 in the digitonin-permeabilized cells, confirming that the HeLa cell cytosol contains all the necessary factors for Cdc7 nuclear import. To identify cytosolic factors responsible for Cdc7 nuclear transportation, we carried out an in vitro nuclear import assay using HeLa cytosol depleted of both importin-α2 and -β. This depleted cytosol did not support Cdc7 nuclear import (Fig. 3B, panels I and II). As expected, Cdc7 nuclear localization was restored when both importin-α2 and -β recombinant proteins were added back to the depleted cytosol (Fig. 3B, panels III and IV). Supplementation of purified recombinant importin-α2 to the depleted HeLa cytosol did not restore Cdc7 nuclear import (Fig. 3B, panels V and VI). Importantly, Cdc7 nuclear import was restored when recombinant importin-β alone was added back to the depleted cytosol (Fig. 3B, panels VII and VIII), suggesting importin-β is directly responsible for the Cdc7 nuclear transportation. To confirm this finding, we depleted either importin-α2or-β alone from the “complete” HeLa cytosol. Consistent with the data shown in Fig. 3B, the absence or presence of importin-α2 did not affect Cdc7 nuclear import (Fig. 3C, III-VI). In contrast, the cytosol lacking importin-β could not support Cdc7 nuclear transportation, which was restored when purified recombinant importin-β was added (Fig. 3C, VII-X). This result further confirms that importin-β, but not importin-α2, is responsible for Cdc7 nuclear import, although both can bind to huCdc7. Note that the depletion of the proteins was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3D). To examine whether importin-β also mediates Cdc7 nuclear import in vivo, we transduced normal IgG, anti-importin-α2, or anti-importin-β antibodies into HeLa cells using a Chariot™ transduction system (Active Motif). The transduction of nonspecific IgG and anti-importin-α2 antibodies into HeLa cells did not affect the nuclear localization of endogenous Cdc7 (Fig. 4, I-VIII). In contrast, the transduction of anti-importin-β antibodies into HeLa cells effectively inhibited Cdc7 nuclear import (Fig. 4, IX-XII), confirming that importin-β is responsible for Cdc7 nuclear import in vivo. We also carried out a similar experiment using HEK293 cells, and found exactly the same result as shown in Fig. 4 (data not shown). Based on the data obtained from in vitro and in vivo assays, we concluded that importin-β, but not importin-α, directly mediates Cdc7 nuclear import. This conclusion is further supported by the data obtained by “docking” assay (below). The Kinase Insert II Is Required for the Binding of Cdc7 to Importin-β and Subsequent Nuclear Import—We next wanted to learn the mechanism of how importin-β mediates Cdc7 nuclear import. To this goal, we generated several Cdc7 deletion mutants (Fig. 5A; data not shown), and then examined their ability of binding to importin-β. As shown in Fig. 5B, GST·Cdc7(Δ1-146) has full binding affinity for both importin-α2 and -β, suggesting there is no binding site within the first 146 amino acids at the NH2 terminus. In contrast, GST·Cdc7(Δ196-372) (i.e. Kinase Insert II deletion) and GST·Cdc7(Δ1-431) completely lost Cdc7 binding affinity for both importin-α2 and -β, suggesting that the region encompassing amino acid residues 196-372 (i.e. Kinase Insert II domain) is required for Cdc7 binding to both importin-α2 and -β. The GST·Cdc7(Δ279-574) or GST·Cdc7(Δ1-279) alone bound to importin-β, albeit at a lower level. However, neither GST·Cdc7(Δ279-574) nor GST·Cdc7(Δ1-279) could bind to importin-α2 (Fig. 5B). To determine whether the in vitro binding of Cdc7 to importin-β is directly relevant to Cdc7 nuclear transportation, we carried out in vitro docking assays. Digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells were incubated with GST·Cdc7 or GST-tagged Cdc7 deletion mutants in the presence of purified recombinant His-importin-β and an energy generating system (note that cytosol was not used in this experiment). Because Ran protein and GTP were not added, the cargo protein (Cdc7) was not expected to be in the nucleus but “docked” at the NPC by this assay system (18Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar, 20Mosammaparast N. Pemberton L.F.

Consistent with in vitro binding experiments, wild-type Cdc7 and Cdc7(Δ1-146) efficiently docked at the NPC in the presence of importin-β, but Cdc7(Δ1-431) and Cdc7(Δ196-372) did not. The deletion mutants GST·Cdc7(Δ279-574) and GST·Cdc7(Δ1-279) also docked at the NPC, albeit at lower levels (Fig. 5C). This result demonstrates that in vitro binding of importin-β to Cdc7 is directly relevant to Cdc7 nuclear transportation in an importin-β-dependent manner. Further deletion analysis suggested that the Cdc7 segment spanning amino acids 306-313 is important for Cdc7 nuclear localization (data not shown). Therefore, w"
https://openalex.org/W2068466559,"To gain insight into the function of human protein kinase X (PrKX), a signal-transduction protein required for macrophage differentiation, we identified regulatory subunit I alpha of protein kinase A, T54 and Smad6 as partners for this protein using a yeast two-hybrid interaction screen. Interactions between PrKX and these proteins were substantiated by co-immunoprecipitation. Interaction between Smad6 and PrKX was also confirmed in human myeloid HL-60 cells following their phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced differentiation into macrophages. In vitro phosphorylation assays demonstrated that PrKX phosphorylates Smad6 at a serine residue. Mutagenesis of this site resulted in abrogation of PrKX phosphorylation. Both PrKX and Smad6 were shown to be co-localized to the nuclear compartment of HL-60 cells during their macrophage differentiation where PrKX levels are induced and Smad6 protein levels remain relatively constant while levels of serine phosphorylation of Smad6 increase. By using in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assays and in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation, we also demonstrate that during macrophage differentiation Smad6 displays an increased binding to the human osteopontin, Id2, and Hex gene promoters, which correlates to an observed increased expression of these genes. Finally, vector-based RNA interference experiments established that both Smad6 and PrKX proteins are required for PMA-induced cell attachment and spreading."
https://openalex.org/W2017508329,"Skp1 is a nucleocytoplasmic protein that is post-translationally modified by a pentasaccharide, Gal alpha1,Gal alpha1,3Fuc alpha1,2Gal-beta1,3GlcNAc alpha1O-, at a 4-hydroxylated derivative of Pro-143 in the amebazoan Dictyostelium discoideum. An enzymatic activity that catalyzes formation of the Gal alpha1,3Fuc linkage by transfer of Gal from UDP-alphaGal to Fuc alpha1,2Gal beta1,3GlcNAc alpha1O-benzyl, or the corresponding glycoform of Skp1, was described previously in cytosolic extracts of Dictyostelium. A protein GT78 associated with this activity has been purified to chromatographic homogeneity. In-gel tryptic digestion followed by nano-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry on a quadrupole time-of-flight geometry instrument with data-dependent tandem mass spectrometry acquisition yielded a number of peptide fragmentation spectra, nine of which were manually de novo sequenced and found to map onto a predicted 3-exon gene of unknown function on chromosome 4. GT78 is predicted to comprise 648 amino acids with an N-terminal glycosyltransferase and a C-terminal beta-propeller domain. Overexpression of GT78 with a His6-tag resulted in a 120-fold increase in GalT-activity in cytosolic extracts, and purified His6-GT78 exhibited alpha3GalT-activity toward a synthetic acceptor substrate. Expression of the truncated N-terminal region confirmed the predicted catalytic activity of this domain. Disruption of the GT78 gene led to a loss of enzyme activity in extracts and accumulation of the non-galactosylated isoform of Skp1 in cells. GT78 therefore represents the Skp1 alpha3GalT, and its mechanism conforms to the sequential model of Skp1 glycosylation in the cytoplasm shown for earlier enzymes in the pathway. Informatics studies suggest that related catalytic domains are expressed in the Golgi or cytoplasm of plants, other protozoans, and animals."

Xun L. Xie X.S. Science. 1998; 282: 1877-1882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Xie X.S. Lu H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15967-15970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The cholesterol oxidase was confined in an agarose gel preventing the enzyme diffusing away, but allowing free exchange of much smaller sized substrates and products. The flavin cofactor of cholesterol oxidase is nonfluorescent in the reduced state and slightly fluorescent in the oxidized state. Therefore, the successive “on-times” and “off-times” reflect the redox cycle and enzymatic turnover of the enzyme. Statistical analysis of multiple single-molecule trajectories revealed a detailed picture of reaction rate fluctuations and memory effects related to previous turnovers.Despite the impressive results on cholesterol oxidase and more recently dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (15Shi J. Palfey B.A. Dertouzos J. Jensen K.F. Gafni A. Steel D. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 6914-6922Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), flavoenzymes in general are not the easiest systems for single-molecule fluorescence studies. The flavin molecule bound in flavoenzymes has unfavorable photophysical properties: an intrinsic high triplet yield and in most cases low molecular brightness due to severe quenching of fluorescence (16van den Berg P.A.W.

Hink M.A. Petushkov V.N. Rigler R. Elson E.S. Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy. Theory and Applications. Springer, Berlin2001: 9-24Google Scholar). Another approach to overcome these limitations is to use a second, strongly fluorescent donor label that can communicate with the flavin via spFRET. Due to changes in the overlap of spectral cross-sections of flavin and donor label the donor fluorescence can be used as a sensitive antenna for the redox state and enzymatic activity of the flavoenzyme. The label can be designed in such a way that spFRET to the flavin will only affect the donor fluorescence when the flavin is in the oxidized state, whereas in the reduced state there is much less spectral overlap. Single-molecule fluorescence detection can thus provide insight in the conformational dynamics of single flavoenzymes in relation to catalysis.We illustrate this approach using the dimeric flavoprotein p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (PHBH, EC 1.14.13.2), a prototype for enzymes involved in the monooxygenation of an aromatic substrate (19Entsch B. van Berkel W.J.H. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). PHBH catalysis involves two half-reactions (Fig. 1) that occur in different active sites of the monomer. In the first half of the catalytic cycle, the FAD cofactor is reduced by NADPH in response to p-hydroxybenzoate binding and NADP+ is released. In the second part of the reaction cycle, the reduced form of the enzyme-substrate complex reacts with oxygen to form a labile flavin (C4a)-hydroperoxide species, which attacks the substrate aromatic ring. During PHBH catalysis, the isoalloxazine ring of the FAD moves in and out of the hydroxylation pocket (20Schreuder H.A. Mattevi A. Obmolova G. Kalk K.H.

Ludwig M.L. Science. 1994; 266: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In the oxidized state, the flavin swings out for the reaction with NADPH (22van Berkel W.J.H. Eppink M.H.M.

Biophys. 2005; 433: 297-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This closed conformation protects the flavin (C4a)-hydroperoxide from solvent and allows efficient substrate hydroxylation. Some PHBH mutants have been shown to stabilize an open conformation with solvent access to the active site (24Wang J. Ortiz-Maldonado M. Entsch B. Massey V. Ballou D. Gatti D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 608-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 26Entsch B. Cole L.J. Ballou D.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 297-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This conformation of the enzyme is unreactive with oxygen but might transiently be formed for sequestering p-hydroxybenzoate to initiate catalysis (26Entsch B. Cole L.J. Ballou D.P. Arch. Biochem.

However, Cys-116 is the only thiol accessible to labeling with maleimide derivatives (27van Berkel W.J.H. Weijer W.J. Müller F. Jekel P.A. Beintema J.J. Eur. J.

We have labeled Cys-116 of PHBH with two different fluorescent maleimides. One fluorescent maleimide used, Alexa Fluo 488 (Alexa488), shows overlap between its fluorescence spectrum and the absorption spectrum of the flavin prosthetic group, whereas the other fluorescent probe used, Alexa Fluo 546 (Alexa546), does not have this spectral overlap and can serve as a control. A three-dimensional representation of dimeric PHBH labeled with the Alexa488 dye is given in Fig. 2.

The results of these experiments show, for the first time, the suitability of the followed approach. The time-resolved fluorescence measurements on an ensemble of enzyme molecules provided a proof of principle. The single-molecule FCS experiments on PHBH under turnover conditions revealed distinct time-dependent fluorescence intensity fluctuations.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Rhodamine 110, tetramethyl-rhodamine, and Alexa488- and Alexa546-maleimides were purchased from Molecular Probes Europe BV (Leiden, The Netherlands). NADPH was obtained from Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany). All other chemicals used were of the highest purity available. Buffers were made from nanopure-grade water (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and before use were filtered through a 0.22-μm filter (Millipore).Labeled Protein Preparation—Recombinant PHBH was expressed and purified as described previously (30van Berkel W.J.H. Westphal A.H. Eschrich K. Eppink M.H.M. de Kok A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The enzyme was pure as judged by SDS-PAGE and stored at -70 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.5 mm EDTA and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Immediately before labeling, dithiothreitol was removed by gel filtration on a Bio-Gel P-6DG column (Bio-Rad), equilibrated in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.5 mm EDTA. Maleimide labeling of PHBH was carried out using the protocol provided by Molecular Probes. Excess of free label was removed by gel filtration on Superdex 200 HR 10/30 (Amersham Biosciences) in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, 0.5 mm EDTA (pH 7.0). The labeled enzyme was directly used in experiments, because it was noticed that prolonged standing resulted in the formation of aggregates and loss of activity. All spectroscopic measurements were carried out in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.0 at 20 °C.The degree of labeling was determined by comparison of the absorption spectra of unlabeled PHBH and Alexa488- or Alexa546-labeled PHBH. The concentrations of protein-bound dye were determined by using molar absorption coefficients ϵ554 = 93 mm-1 cm-1 and ϵ493 = 72 mm-1 cm-1 for Alexa546 and Alexa488, respectively, and a molar absorption coefficient ϵ450 of 10.2 mm-1 cm-1 (30van Berkel W.J.H. Westphal A.H. Eschrich K. Eppink M.H.M. de Kok A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) for the unlabeled protein. For Alexa488-PHBH conjugates, the Bradford protein assay method was used to determine the protein content. Native PHBH served as a reference to obtain a calibration curve. The degree of labeling was also established by mass spectrometry. For this, 2 μm enzyme in 10 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.8, was introduced in a nanoflow electrospray mass spectrometer coupled to an orthogonal time-of-flight analyzer operating in positive ion mode (Micromass LC-T, Waters). Preparation of nanoflow capillaries and optimization of the electrospray voltages was as described in Ref. 31Tahallah N. Pinkse M. Maier C.S. Heck A.J. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 15: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar.Enzyme Activity—PHBH activity was measured in air-saturated 100 mm Tris/sulfate, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mm EDTA, 200 μm p-hydroxybenzoate (POHB) and 200 μm NADPH (32Müller F. van Berkel W.J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The rate of NADPH oxidation was followed by recording the absorption decrease at 340 nm. Enzyme concentrations were determined by using a molar absorption coefficient ϵ450 of 10.2 mm-1 cm-1 (30van Berkel W.J.H. Westphal A.H. Eschrich K. Eppink M.H.M. de Kok A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Spectral Measurements—Light absorption measurements were performed on a Hewlett-Packard HP 8453 diode array spectrophotometer. Corrected fluorescence spectra were obtained using a Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluorolog 3.2.2 spectrofluorometer. To compare the fluorescence quantum yields of Alexa488 in water (pH 7.0) with that of fluorescein in 0.1 m sodium hydroxide in water, the absorbance of both solutions was made equal at the excitation wavelength of 480 nm, and the emission spectra were integrated.Time-resolved Fluorescence—Time-resolved fluorescence experiments were performed using the single-photon timing technique with pulsed laser excitation as recently described (33Borst J.W. Hink M.A. van Hoek A. Visser A.J.W.G. J. Fluoresc. 2005; 15: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The laser repetition frequency amounted to 3.8 × 106 pulses per second, the maximum pulse energy was at the sub-pJ level, the wavelength was 488 nm, and the pulse duration was ∼0.5 ps. Quartz cuvettes (1-cm path length in excitation, 1-ml volume) were placed in a thermostatted holder (20 °C). Fluorescence light was detected at an angle of 90° relative to the laser beam and passed through a combination of an OG 530 cut-off filter (Schott, Mainz, Germany) and a 526 nm band-pass filter (Δλ = 12.6 nm, Schott) or a 570.3 nm band-pass filter (Δλ = 10.3 nm, Schott) for Alexa488- and Alexa546-PHBH samples, respectively. The concentration of the labeled enzymes amounted to 200 nm. All measurements consisted of a number of sequences of measuring intervals of 10-s parallel (I∥) and of 10-s perpendicular (I⊥) polarized emission for a total of ∼2 min for each sample. For experimental decay, 4096 channels were used with a time spacing of 8.3 ps per channel. Erythrosine B in nanopure water (with a known single lifetime of 80 ps) served as a reference compound to yield the dynamical instrumental response curve (34Bastiaens P.I.H. van Hoek A. Benen J.A.E.

I(t)=E(t)⊗∑i=1Nαie-t/τi(Eq. 2) Data analysis with a model of discrete exponential terms was performed using the TRFA Data Processing Package version 1.2 of the Scientific Software Technologies Center (Belarusian State University, Minsk, Belarus, www.sstcenter.com) (details in Refs. 33Borst J.W.

Eur. Biophys. J. 1999; 28: 526-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).Fluorescence Anisotropy Decay Analysis—In time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy experiments the angular displacement of fluorophore emission dipoles is measured in real-time. The experimental observable is the fluorescence anisotropy r defined as in Equation 3. r(t)=I∥(t)-I⊥(t)I∥(t)+2I⊥(t)(Eq. 3) The anisotropy decay of proteins is often affected by rapid reorientation of the fluorophore in addition to the much slower overall rotation of the protein. This applies for both internal and external fluorophores attached to the protein. The anisotropy decay of a protein exhibiting rapid internal reorientation and slow overall rotation can be described by Equation 4 (36Szabo A. J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81: 150-167Crossref Scopus (369) Google Scholar). r(t)={β1exp(-t/ϕint)+β2}exp(-t/ϕprot)(Eq. 4) Here the parameter ϕint is the time constant for rapid internal reorientation, ϕprot is the rotational correlation time of the protein, and β1 + β2 is the fundamental anisotropy. We can define a second-rank order parameter S for a fluorophore reorienting in a protein according to Equation 5. S2=β2β1+β2=12cosΨ·(cosΨ+1)(Eq. 5) The parameter Ψ is the angular displacement of the fluorophore due to internal reorientation. It can be immediately seen that S = 1 when there is no flexibility (β1 = 0). The rate of reorientation is given by the diffusion coefficient D⊥ of internal motion (Equation 6) (36Szabo A. J. Chem.

Visser A.J.W.G. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 361: 93-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). All measurements were performed with a Zeiss LSM ConfoCor 2 combined microscope system (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). For excitation of the Alexa488-PHBH conjugate, the 488 nm line of an air-cooled argon ion laser was used. For excitation of the Alexa546-PHBH conjugate, the 543 nm laser line of a helium-neon laser was used. The laser power was set at 2.5 microwatts of output for the 488 nm line and at 1.5 microwatts for the 543 nm line, yielding good signal-to-noise autocorrelation traces and low triplet-state contribution (39Widengren J. Mets Ü. Rigler R. J. Phys. Chem. 1995; 99: 13368-13379Crossref Scopus (640) Google Scholar). A sample of rhodamine 110 (488 nm excitation) or tetramethylrhodamine (543 nm excitation) in nanopure water was used for calibration of the beam profile characterized by the structural parameter sp of the three-dimensional Gaussian-shaped observation volume (sp = ωz/ωxy; ωz and ωxy are the axial and equatorial radii, respectively). The beam radius (ωxy) can be determined from the measured diffusion time (τD) and the known diffusion coefficients (D)of rhodamine 110 (D = 280 μm2/s) and tetramethylrhodamine (D = 260 μm2/s) applying Equation 7. τD=ωxy2/4D(Eq. 7) Typical values obtained from calibration with rhodamine 110 are τD = 16 μs and S = 4.8 and with tetramethylrhodamine τD = 50 μs and S = 8.4. Samples were placed in 8-chambered plates (Nunc, Rochester, NY) with borosilicate bottom. Enzyme concentrations were 10–50 nm, and substrate concentrations were the same as those used for PHBH activity assays. Autocorrelation traces were acquired 10 times with 30-s periods.FCS Analysis—The autocorrelation curves were globally analyzed to specified models by using the FCS Data Processor version 1.4 of the Scientific Software Technologies Center (Belarusian State University) (40Skakun V.V. Hink M.A. Digris A.V. Engel R. Novikov E.G. Apanasovich V.V. Visser A.J.W.G. Eur. Biophys. J. 2005; 34: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In global analysis, several correlation curves are combined in one data set and simultaneously fitted with certain parameters linked over the set ensuring more reliable parameter recovery.Two model functions were used to fit the experimental autocorrelation curves. The first model is that of three-dimensional diffusion and triplet-state relaxation according to, Gbefore(τ)=1+1N·1-A+Aexp(-τ/τT)(1-A)·1/((1+(τ/τD))1+(τ/sp2τD))(Eq. 8) where Gbefore is the model function before enzymatic reaction, N is the number of fluorescent molecules in the observation volume, tτD is the diffusion time, τT is the triplet-state lifetime, A is the triplet-state fraction, and sp is the structural parameter. The second model is that of three-dimensional diffusion model, triplet-state kinetics and an additional exponential relaxation process with relaxation time τR and associated amplitude B according to, Greaction(τ)=1+1N·1-A+Aexp(-τ/τT)(1-A)·1-B+Bexp(-τ/τR)(1-B)·1/((1+(τ/τD))1+(τ/sp2τD))(Eq. 9) where Greaction is the model function applicable during enzymatic reaction.RESULTSProperties of Labeled Enzyme—The enzyme labeled with either dye had an activity of 54 ± 2 units per mg of protein, which is comparable to that of the wild-type enzyme (28van Berkel W.J.H. Müller F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 167: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Comparison of absorption spectra of unlabeled enzyme and labeled enzyme indicated an almost 100% labeling efficiency (results not shown). Nanoflow electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy revealed that Alexa488-PHBH contained ∼0.95 mol of dye per subunit. Moreover, under optimal spray conditions (31Tahallah N. Pinkse M. Maier C.S. Heck A.J. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 15: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), Alexa488-PHBH was almost completely in the dimeric holo- form with a mass of 91,633 ± 30 Da. The minor monomeric fraction of Alexa488-PHBH gave a mass of 45,810 ± 10 Da. These values are in good agreement with the reported masses of C116S-PHBH (dimer mass = 90,233 ± 30 Da; monomer mass = 45,096 ± 6 Da; sequential mass = 45,090.7 with FAD) (29Eschrich K. van Berkel W.J.H.

FEBS Lett. 1990; 277: 197-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and taking the mass of the free Alexa488 dye (mass = 721) into account.Fig. 3 shows the absorption spectrum of oxidized and reduced FAD in PHBH and the fluorescence emission spectra of Alexa488 and Alexa546. There is a clear spectral overlap between the FAD absorption spectrum and the Alexa488 fluorescence emission spectrum, whereas this overlap does not exist in case of Alexa546 as donor. The absorption spectra of the reduced and oxygenated FAD species formed during PHBH catalysis show reduced absorption peaks and are more UV-shifted than the absorption spectrum of oxidized FAD (41Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 999: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); they have strongly reduced overlap with the fluorescence spectrum of Alexa488. The critical transfer distance (42Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 369Google Scholar) is obtained from, R0=0.211[κ2n-4QDJ(λ)](1/6)(Eq. 10) where κ2 is the dipole orientation factor taken as 2/3 (dynamical average limit), n is the refractive index (n = 1.33), QD is the quantum yield of donor fluorescence (QD = 0.85 for Alexa488; by comparison to QD = 0.92 of fluorescein in 0.1 m sodium hydroxide in water), and J(λ) is the spectral overlap integral (6.68 × 1013 m-1 cm-1nm4). R0 is calculated to be 32 Å.FIGURE 3Absorption spectra of oxidized and reduced FAD in PHBH and fluorescence emission spectra of Alexa488 and Alexa546 covalently attached to PHBH.

https://openalex.org/W2023165370,"Blastula protease 10 (BP10) is a metalloenzyme involved in sea urchin embryogenesis, which has been assigned to the astacin family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases. It shows greatest homology with the mammalian tolloid-like genes and contains conserved structural motifs consistent with astacin, tolloid, and bone morphogenetic protein 1. Astacin, a crustacean digestive enzyme, has been proposed to carry out hydrolysis via a metal-centered mechanism that involves a metal-coordinated “tyrosine switch.” It has not been determined if the more structurally complex members of this family involved in eukaryotic development share this mechanism. The recombinant BP10 has been overexpressed in Escherichia coli, its metalloenzyme nature has been confirmed, and its catalytic properties have been characterized through kinetic studies. BP10 shows significant hydrolysis toward gelatin both in its native zinc-containing form and copper derivative. The copper derivative of BP10 shows a remarkable 960% rate acceleration toward the hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate N-benzoyl-arginine-p-nitroanilide when compared with the zinc form. The enzyme also shows calcium-dependent activation. These are the first thorough mechanistic studies reported on BP10 as a representative of the more structurally complex members of astacin-type enzymes in deuterostomes, which can add supporting data to corroborate the metal-centered mechanism proposed for astacin and the role of the coordinated Tyr.

We have demonstrated the first mechanistic study of a tolloid-related metalloenzyme involved in sea urchin embryogenesis. The astacin family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases is ubiquitously distributed across all phyla and part of the superfamily of metzincins (1Bond J.S. Beynon R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1247-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Approximately 30 members of the astacin family have been characterized at the protein level (2Hooper N.M. Zinc Metalloproteases in Health and Disease. Taylor and Francis, Bristol, PA1996: 23-46Google Scholar), such as meprins, bone morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP-1), 3The abbreviations used are: BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; Arg-NHOH, Arg-hydroxamate; BP10, blastula protease 10; LMCT, ligand-to-metal charge transfer transition(s); BAPNA, N-benzoyl-arginine-p-nitroanilide; TEMED, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine; EGF, epidermal growth factor; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; TAPS, 3-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}-1-propanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 3The abbreviations used are: BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; Arg-NHOH, Arg-hydroxamate; BP10, blastula protease 10; LMCT, ligand-to-metal charge transfer transition(s); BAPNA, N-benzoyl-arginine-p-nitroanilide; TEMED, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine; EGF, epidermal growth factor; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; TAPS, 3-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}-1-propanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. and tolloid, whereas several others have been identified through gene sequencing, including those in Caenorhabditis elegans (3Moehrlen F. Hutter H. Zwilling R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4909-4920Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The signature of the sequence of the active site motif for this family of enzymes is HEXXHXXGXXH, where one Zn2+ ion coordinates with the three histidines (boldface type), a tyrosine (Met-His/Ser-Tyr in a loop region downstream from the coordinated His residues), and a water molecule (4Gomis-Rüth F.X. Stöcker W. Huber H. Zwilling R. Bode W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 945-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Most members of this family share common domain structures such as the pre- and proenzyme sequences located immediately N-terminal to the protease domain. Several members contain one or two copies of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains and complement-like domains (Clr, Cls) near the C terminus (2Hooper N.M. Zinc Metalloproteases in Health and Disease. Taylor and Francis, Bristol, PA1996: 23-46Google Scholar). The shuffling of different domains in relation to the catalytic protease domain creates a variety of proteins with different structures and functions.Originally isolated and characterized as a developmentally regulated gene in sea urchin embryos (5Lepage T. Ghiglione C. Gache C. Development. 1992; 114: 147-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lepage T. Ghiglione C. Gache C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 744-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the BP10 protein has remained uncharacterized. It shares sequence similarity with other members of the astacin family of enzymes (astacin itself being a crayfish digestive enzyme (4Gomis-Rüth F.X. Stöcker W. Huber H. Zwilling R. Bode W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 945-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 7Bode W. Gomis-Rüth F.X. Huber R. Zwilling R. Stöcker W. Nature. 1992; 358: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) and hence a novel prototype in catalytic mechanism) important in development, such as tolloid-like and BMP-1 in vertebrates and tolloid in Drosophila. The BP10 protease is constructed of similar structural domains as BMP-1 and tolloid (i.e. astacin domain, CUB, and EGF) but has different arrangements and numbers of these domains. BP10 is most similar in sequence to the mammalian tolloid-like 2 proteins (8Takahara K. Brevard R. Hoffman G.F. Suzuki N. Greenspan D.S. Genomics. 1996; 34: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The recent sea urchin genome sequencing project has revealed a cluster of genes homologous to BP10 (available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genomes/) as well as several related genes with similar structural domains. One of these, SpAN, has been implicated in regulating BMP-4 signaling (9Wardle F.C. Angerer L.M. Angerer R.C. Dev. Biol. 1999; 206: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The transcription of the BP10 gene is transiently activated around the 16–32-cell stage, and the accumulation of BP10 mRNA peaks at the blastula stage. Temporarily, the highest BP10 activity is detected ∼1.5 h after expression of the sea urchin hatching enzyme (envelysin) reaches a maximum (5Lepage T. Ghiglione C. Gache C. Development. 1992; 114: 147-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The BP10 transcripts are detected in a limited area of the blastula. The protein is first detected in late cleavage, and its level peaks in the blastula stage, declines abruptly before ingression of primary mesenchyme cells, and remains invariable in late development (5Lepage T. Ghiglione C. Gache C. Development. 1992; 114: 147-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gache and co-workers (5Lepage T. Ghiglione C. Gache C. Development. 1992; 114: 147-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have proposed that BP10 acts as a zymogen activator, since an EGF domain is a highly conserved motif involved in proteolytic cascades or activation of precursors (5Lepage T. Ghiglione C. Gache C. Development. 1992; 114: 147-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Appella E. Weber I.T. Blasi F. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), although its in vivo function is not yet known. Mammalian tolloid-like-2 proteins have been shown to process lysyl oxidase but not procollagen or chordin (11Uzel M.I. Scott I.C. Babakhanlou-Chase H. Palamakumbura A.H. Pappanos W.N. Hong H.-H. Greenspan D.S. Trackman P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22537-22543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In the sea urchin, blocking lysyl oxidase activity inhibits gastrulation (12Butler E. Hardin J. Benson S. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 173: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 13Wessel G.M. McClay D.R. Dev. Biol. 1987; 121: 149-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Despite the uncertainty about its function, blocking BP10 activity prior to hatching with the use of an antibody resulted in abnormal embryos (5Lepage T. Ghiglione C. Gache C. Development. 1992; 114: 147-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), reflecting the significance of this protease in embryo development.BP10 has a unique arrangement of structural features (5Lepage T. Ghiglione C. Gache C. Development. 1992; 114: 147-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lepage T. Ghiglione C. Gache C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 744-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), such as the EGF-Ca2+ binding domain, two adjacent CUB domains, and a catalytic domain that is highly homologous to astacin. In particular, the EGF-Ca2+ domain is located between the catalytic domain and the proposed regulatory CUB sequences. More often, these EGF-Ca2+ domains are located between CUB sequences. CUB domains have been implicated in activity and regulation in BMP-1 (14Hartigan N. Garrigue-Antar L. Kadler K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18045-18049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Astacin family enzymes and serine proteases have been implicated in remodeling the pericellular space in sea urchin embryos, which is composed of the extracellular matrix and transmembrane proteins (15Sternlicht M.D. Werb Z. Cell. Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 463-516Crossref Scopus (3196) Google Scholar, 16Imai K. Kusakabe M. Sakakura T. Nakanishiki I. Okada Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 216-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Moreover, several studies have reported gelatinase and collagenase activities from enzymes located in the sea urchin egg and embryo, which were characterized as metalloenzymes due to inactivation with EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline (17Vafa O. Nishioka D. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 40: 36-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 18Karakiulakis G. Papakonstantinou E. Maragoudakis M.E. Miservic G.N. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 52: 92-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 19Quigley J.P. Braithwaite R.S. Armstrong P.B. Differentiation. 1993; 54: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 20Sharpe C. Robinson J.J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar).Besides the interesting distribution of astacin-like enzymes across phyla and the numerous functional roles of these enzymes in developmental biology, mechanistic questions about these highly conserved hydrolases domains still remain to be answered. Within the metzincin superfamily of enzymes, minor differences of active site function have been observed, which are likely to account for different substrate specificities (21Stöcker W. Grams F. Baumann U. Reinemer P. Gomis-Rüth F.X. McKay D.B. Bode W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 823-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). The metal-coordinated tyrosine in this protease family is a rather unusual metal-binding motif, due to possible reduction of Lewis acidity of the metal ion in the active site induced by the coordination of the negatively charged phenolate to the metal center (22Kimura E. Prog. Inorg. Chem. 1994; 41: 443-491Google Scholar, 23Kimura E. Koike T. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 44: 229-261Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, the coordination of the Tyr-phenolate under physiological conditions does not seem to affect astacin catalysis under neutral conditions. The status of the coordinated tyrosine has been proposed to be an inhibitory process in the metal-centered hydrolysis of peptide bonds by astacin and serralysin (a bacterial metalloprotease containing an astacin-like active site) (24Park H.I. Ming L.-J. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 7: 600-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 25Park H.I. Ming L.-J. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1998; 72: 57-62Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A metal-centered mechanism has been proposed for astacin and serralysin based on kinetic and spectroscopic studies of the enzymes and their Cu2+ derivatives (24Park H.I. Ming L.-J. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 7: 600-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 25Park H.I. Ming L.-J. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1998; 72: 57-62Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this mechanism, the active site Zn2+ coordinated by three His, a tyrosine, and a water molecule can be activated via detachment of the Tyr-phenolate with a concomitant deprotonation of the coordinated water assisted by a glutamate residue to afford the arrangement Zn2+–OH···Glu– without a coordinated Tyr. The metal-bound OH– is able to hydrolyze the scissile bond with Zn2+, creating electrostatic strain in the peptide bond by interaction with the carbonyl group of the scissile bond. To gain further insight into the mechanism of this family of developmentally significant proteases, we have performed and present herein the overexpression and thorough mechanistic study of recombinant BP10, which can serve as a model system for astacin-type developmentally regulated metalloenzymes. In this study, we show that BP10 is a zinc-dependent mononuclear metalloprotease with catalytic properties similar to astacin. Through the use of a synthetic substrate and porcine gelatin as substrates for the characterization of recombinant BP10, we demonstrate a unique Ca2+-dependent activation probably due to enhanced substrate binding. BP10 also is shown to have significant stability in the presence of chaotropic reagents by the use of circular dichroism. Finally, the copper derivative of BP10 is shown to have considerable catalytic and spectroscopic activities, which serve as evidence of the conserved astacin mechanism in developmentally regulated enzymes with the participation of the metal-coordinated tyrosine. Serralysin, a bacterial enzyme with similarity to BP10 only in the structure of the active site and in the primary sequence of the metal binding center, has similar substrate specificity.Further analysis of BP10 will add insight into the catalytic mechanism of members of the astacin family and the degree to which the mechanism is conserved among the enzymes found in deuterostomes. Characterization of BP10 will also provide insight into the role of tolloid family zinc endopeptidases in deuterostome development as well as the factors influencing substrate specificity of these enzymes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The expression vector pQE30Xa, Ni2+-NTA-agarose, and mouse anti-His primary antibody were from Qiagen (Valencia, CA); XL1-Blue chemically competent Escherichia coli was from Invitrogen; Rosetta Blue chemically competent E. coli and Factor Xa removal kit were from Novagen (San Diego, CA); all primers were from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA); all modifying and restriction enzymes were from Promega (Madison, WI); Eppendorf Perfect plasmid preparation was from Eppendorf (Westbury, NY); BM purple phosphatase substrate was from Roche Applied Science; EDTA, ZnCl2, Cu(NO3)2, Ca(NO3)2, glycerol, ninhydrin, guanidine hydrochloride, bovine serum albumin, SDS, Triton X-100, Tween 20, imidazole, NaH2PO4, Na2HPO4, Tris-HCl, acrylamide, bisacrylamide, TEMED, ammonium persulfate, NaN3, dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), sodium citrate, acetic acid, guanidine hydrochloride, and propanol were from Fisher; Type A porcine gelatin 300 bloom, N-benzoyl-arginine-p-nitroanilide (BAPNA), urea, isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyronoside, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, benzamidine, urea, lysozyme, bicinchoninic acid, arginine-hydroxamate, and HEPES, CAPS, TAPS, and MES buffers were from Sigma; and 1,10-phenanthroline was from Acros (Fairlawn, NJ). All reagents were of enzyme or molecular biology grade when available, and all others were reagent grade. All glassware and plasticware were extensively rinsed with EDTA to remove metal contaminants and thoroughly washed with 18-megaohm water to remove the chelator. All buffers contained Chelex resin to remove metal contaminants. CD spectra were collected in an AVIV 215 spectropolarimeter (Rheometric Scientific, Inc., Lakewood, NJ) at room temperature. All of the spectrophotometric measurements were performed in a Varian CARY 50 Bio-Spectrophotometer equipped with a PCB-150 water Peltier thermostable cell.Overexpression, Purification, and Refolding of Recombinant BP1—The cDNA coding for Paracentrotus lividus BP10 cloned into the pBluescript plasmid (pBP10) was a generous contribution from Christian Gache and Thierry Lepage (Unité de Biologie Cellulaire, Center National de la Recherche Scientifique et Université de Paris VI, Station Marine, Villefranche-sur-Mer, France). PCR primers coding for both 5′ and 3′ regions were designed according to the proposed full-length BP10 to subclone the cDNA into the pQE30Xa overexpression vector. The 5′ primer (5′-PO4-AAACTAATACTTTCCCTTTCGGGATTG-3′) codes for the first nine codons in the proposed nucleotide sequence in BP10 and is 5′-phosphorylated for blunt end cloning using the StuI restriction site in pQE30Xa; 3′ primer was designed for cloning into the XmaI restriction site 5′-AATTCCCGGGTTAGTTCAGACGAGGATCTCGGGT-3′ (where the boldface type represents extra base pairs for melting temperature optimization, the underline represents the XmaI restriction site, and underlined boldface type represents the stop codon). The PCR product coding for BP10 was digested with XmaI and cloned into the pQE30Xa vector. The BP10 construct was transformed into Rosetta Blue competent cells. The colonies overexpressing recombinant BP10 were screened using a colony lift protocol according to Qiagen without modifications, where the production of BP10 was monitored using a mouse anti-His tag primary antibody. The active colonies were picked, propagated in liquid medium to A600 = 0.4. Isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyronoside was added to a final concentration of 1.0 mm, and the culture was grown at 30 °C and 300 rpm for 4.5 h. The bacteria containing recombinant BP10 were pelleted at 4000 × g at 4 °C and resuspended in cell wall lysis buffer (50.0 mm NaH2PO4, 100.0 mm NaCl, 10.0 mm imidazole, 2.0 mm benzamidine, 2.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0) containing 1.7 mg/ml lysozyme, incubated on ice lightly shaking for 60 min, and then sonicated for 6 × 10 s with 10-s intervals. The cultures were pelleted at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min, and the inclusion bodies were resuspended in a urea buffer (8.0 m urea, 10.0 mm Tris, 100.0 mm NaH2PO4, 1.0% Triton X-100, 2.0 mm benzamidine, 2.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0) and incubated at 37 °C at 200 rpm for 60 min. The solubilized inclusion bodies were pelleted at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min, and 1.0 ml of Ni2+-NTA-agarose was added to the supernatant. The Ni2+-NTA slurry was gently shaken at room temperature for 45 min and then added to a gravityfed column, and the recombinant BP10 was eluted using a pH gradient, with buffers containing 6.0 m urea, 10.0 mm Tris, 100.0 mm NaH2PO4, at pH values of 6.3, 5.9, and 4.5. The recombinant BP10 was completely eluted at pH 4.5 and was immediately titrated to pH 7.4 using 0.5 m NaH2PO4. Overexpression and purification were monitored on a time-dependent basis using 12.5% SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli and Western blot techniques using the anti-His tag antibody.The concentration of recombinant BP10 was determined using standard BCA assay with a bovine serum albumin standard curve. The recombinant protein was diluted 40 times by volume using 50.0 mm Tris with 50 mm NaCl and then dialyzed extensively with several changes against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 50 μm ZnCl2 for 48 h at 4 °C. Recombinant BP10 was concentrated under 18 p.s.i. N2 using either an YM3 Amicon membrane or an Amicon Centricon YM3 spin column. Final BP10 concentrations were checked using BCA. The His tag fusion was removed using a Factor Xa His tag removal kit from Novagen according to the manufacturer's instructions.Preparation of the Copper Derivative of BP1—During the refolding of urea-denatured BP10, 1.0 mm 1,10-phenanthroline was added to the 50.0 mm Tris, 50.0 mm NaCl, pH 7.5 buffer and then extensively dialyzed against PBS containing 0.5 m guanidine·HCl. The guanidine·HCl-containing buffer was exchanged through dialysis with PBS buffer and then with PBS containing 50 μm Cu(NO3)2. Protein concentrations were determined with BCA assay.CD Studies—CD spectra of urea-denatured and folded Zn-BP10 and Cu-BP10 were collected in PBS using a 0.1-cm cell with a resolution of 0.5 nm. All absorbance readings were converted to molar ellipticity, and the α-helical content was calculated according to published methods (26Chen Y.-H. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar).Gelatin Zymogram—Gelatin was incorporated into a polyacrylamide gel matrix according to standard protocols with modifications to fit current studies as described below (27Murphy G. Crabbe T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 470-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). A volume of 1.25 ml of 1.4 m Tris at pH 8.8, 0.50 ml of 5.0 mg/ml gelatin solution in water, 25.0 μl of 10% (w/v) ammonium persulfate, 200 μl of 10% (w/v) SDS, 25.0 μl of TEMED, 2.0 ml of water, and 1.25 ml of 30:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide were mixed and allowed to polymerize in a minigel minus a stacking gel. Several concentrations of BP10 were mixed with nonreducing gel-loading dye and incubated for 15 min at room temperature (standard Laemmli protocol minus mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar)). These BP10 samples were loaded into each lane of the gel and run at 200 V and 4 °C until the dye front reached the bottom of the plate. The running buffer did not contain SDS. The gel was washed two times in 0.25% Triton X-100 for 15 min with gentle shaking and then incubated for 10 h in 50.0 mm Tris, pH 7.50, 1.0 μm ZnCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.02% NaN3, and 2.0 mm CaCl2. After 10 h, the gels were stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue in 40% propanol for 1.0 h. The gel was destained in a 7% acetic acid solution to reveal the digestion and then photographed on a light table with a digital camera.Gelatinase Assay—The gelatinase activity of recombinant BP10 was monitored using a detection method for α-amino groups with ninhydrin as an indicator of peptide hydrolysis according to a standard protocol with modifications to fit current studies as described below (29Grubb J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 602-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). A 5.0 mg/ml gelatin solution was prepared in H2O and heated to 55 °C for 15 min until completely dissolved. A ninhydrin detection solution was prepared by mixing 9.0 ml of glycerol, 3.0 ml of 0.5 m sodium citrate at pH 5.50, and 3.75 ml of 1.0% (w/v) ninhydrin solution in 0.5 m sodium citrate buffer. Gelatin and BP10 (1.0 μm final concentration) were mixed in PBS and incubated at room temperature. A 50.0-μl sample was taken from the reaction at several time points and mixed with 950 μl of ninhydrin detection solution and then boiled for 12.0 min; then the absorbance at 570 nm was determined. A sample containing undigested stock gelatin (the same gelatin used for the experiment, incubated under the same conditions without BP10) mixed with the same detection assay was used as the blank. The pseudo-first-order rate constant kobs was determined from an exponential curve fit. The molar absorptivity of Ruhemann's purple (ϵ570 = 22,000 m–1 cm–1) (30Friedman M. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2004; 52: 385-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) was used to determine gelatin concentrations in millimolar and also allowed for monitoring the substrate-dependent hydrolysis of gelatin. Several dilutions of a 10.0 mg/ml stock solution of gelatin incubated with BP10 with time points taken at 0.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, and 16.0 min were used to calculate the initial rate using the ninhydrin detection method described above. Initial rates were fitted as a function of substrate concentration according to the Michaelis-Menten equation, yielding kcat and Km parameters.Hydrolysis of BAPNA by Zn-BP10 and Cu-BP1—BAPNA stock solutions were made in Me2SO and then diluted with 50.0 mm HEPES, 50.0 mm NaCl, pH 7.50. Less than 2% Me2SO by volume was present in each assay and found not to interfere with kinetic measurements. Several concentrations of BAPNA were incubated with 2.17 μm BP10, and rates were determined colorimetrically from the release of the p-nitroaniline product (ϵ405 = 10,150 m–1 cm–1). Kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation.Calcium Activation Assays—Gelatin was extensively dialyzed against an EDTA solution and then extensively dialyzed to remove the chelator. Calcium was carefully titrated under substrate saturation conditions to determine its effect on the hydrolysis of gelatin and BAPNA. Once saturating concentrations of calcium were determined, new kinetic parameters were obtained using sufficient (1.0 mm) calcium in all buffers.Inhibition Studies—The effects of two inhibitors, 1,10-phenanthroline and arginine-hydroxamate (Arg-NHOH), on the hydrolysis of BAPNA were determined by running Michaelis-Menten kinetics under several concentrations of each inhibitor. Inhibition constants were determined according to the inhibition patterns for 1,10-phenanthroline and Arg-NHOH, respectively.pH Profiles—The pH profiles for Zn- and Cu-BP10 catalysis were constructed by monitoring gelatin and BAPNA hydrolysis under several different pH values using 50.0 mm buffers containing 50.0 mm NaCl and 1.0 mm CaCl2. The following buffers were used: acetate (pH 5.0), MES (pH 5.5–6.5), HEPES (pH 7.0–8.0), TAPS (pH 8.5–9.0), and CAPS (pH 9.5–11.0). The pH-dependent kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation, and pKa values were obtained from fitting the kinetic parameters to a two-ionization process.Electronic Spectrum of Cu-BP1—The electronic spectrum of 20.0 μm Cu-BP10 was obtained from 350 to 800 nm, and the tyrosine to copper charge transfer transition was observed at 454 nm. The quenching of this ligand-to-metal charge transfer transition (LMCT) was monitored spectrophotometrically upon the addition of Arg-NHOH.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONOverexpression and Refolding of Recombinant BP1—The recombinant enzyme was efficiently overexpressed, although it was insoluble and contained within inclusion bodies (Fig. 1, lane 3). Urea solubilization proved to be an efficient method for extracting the enzyme from inclusion bodies, coupled with a fusion His tag at the N terminus to BP10 that allows for efficient purification using Ni2+-NTA-agarose. The overexpression and purification yields an average of 0.7 mg/ml total recombinant BP10 after a pH gradient elution from the Ni2+-NTA-agarose column (Fig. 1). The protein overexpression was monitored on a time course using SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Fig. 2B). The detection of the His tag using an anti-His antibody upon induction with isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyronoside proved a sensitive and consistent method for monitoring the overexpression of the recombinant protein.FIGURE 2A, SDS-PAGE (12.5%) of intact BP10 after refolding.

It was determined empirically that a 40-fold dilution of the denatured protein prior to dialysis was important, since at higher concentrations, the protein coagulates and precipitates out of solution. Due to the large number of cysteine residues in BP10, cysteine and reduced glutathione were included in the refolding process in separate attempts. However, this refolding process"
https://openalex.org/W2079151413,"There is much debate about the way in which epithelial tumors metastasize. It has been proposed that the bone marrow (BM) acts as a tumor cell reservoir. We injected human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells (Mahlavu cell line) into the livers, circulation or BM of NOD/SCID mice and circulating tumor cells were quantified. When injected under the Glisson capsule, a primary tumor developed and continuously yielded circulating tumor cells. Liver tumor removal led to a very low level of Mahlavu cells both in blood and BM 30 days later. When Mahlavu cells (cultured or from BM of primary mice femurs) were intravenously injected into mice, the number of cells in the bloodstream (BS) steadily decreased, whereas the BM was not significantly colonized. When Mahlavu cells were directly injected into one femur, the controlateral femur was not colonized. Microscopic analysis and a sensitive PCR assay (<1 Mahlavu cell/nuclear cells) both failed to detect human tumor cells in other organs regardless of injection route. In conclusion, our model strongly supports the hypothesis that HCCs continuously release cells into the BS. However, in sharp contrast with the current hypothesis, the BM is not specifically colonized by tumor cells but could store them at a very low level."
https://openalex.org/W1970673890,"Human trypsin 4 is an unconventional serine protease that possesses an arginine at position 193 in place of the highly conserved glycine. Although this single amino acid substitution does not affect steady-state activity on small synthetic substrates, it has dramatic effects on zymogen activation, interaction with canonical inhibitors, and substrate specificity toward macromolecular substrates. To study the effect of a non-glycine residue at position 193 on the mechanism of the individual enzymatic reaction steps, we expressed wild type human trypsin 4 and its R193G mutant. 4-Methylumbelliferyl 4-guanidinobenzoate has been chosen as a substrate analogue, where deacylation is rate-limiting, and transient kinetic methods were used to monitor the reactions. This experimental system allows for the separation of the individual reaction steps during substrate hydrolysis and the determination of their rate constants dependably. We suggest a refined model for the reaction mechanism, in which acylation is preceded by the reversible formation of the first tetrahedral intermediate. Furthermore, the thermodynamics of these steps were also investigated. The formation of the first tetrahedral intermediate is highly exothermic and accompanied by a large entropy decrease for the wild type enzyme, whereas the signs of the enthalpy and entropy changes are opposite and smaller for the R193G mutant. This difference in the energetic profiles indicates much more extended structural and/or dynamic rearrangements in the equilibrium step of the first tetrahedral intermediate formation in wild type human trypsin 4 than in the R193G mutant enzyme, which may contribute to the biological function of this protease.

Trypsin is a prototype of the S1 serine protease family, the largest group of proteases. The residues indispensable for its enzymatic activity, His-57, Asp-102, and Ser-195 (chymotrypsinogen numbering), are structurally conserved and are referred to collectively as the catalytic triad (1Huber R.B.W. Acc. Chem. Res. 1978; 11: 114-122Crossref Scopus (604) Google Scholar). These residues are located at the active site of the enzyme. As the first step of the catalytic cycle, the enzyme binds the substrate forming the non-covalent Michaelis complex. The hydroxyl oxygen of the catalytic serine makes a nucleophilic attack on the electron-deficient carbonyl carbon of the scissile bond, and a covalent bond is formed. The attacked carbon atom becomes tetrahedrally coordinated; thus this state is called the first tetrahedral intermediate. In the next step, this species breaks down to yield the C-terminal (first) product and the acyl-enzyme. The acylation is followed by deacylation, a mechanistically similar action, in which the acyl-ester bond is attacked by a water molecule that has previously been activated by His-57 (2Bender M.L. Kézdy J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1965; 34: 49-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 3Polgár L. Bender M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 64: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). During the hydrolysis of the scissile bond, tetrahedral intermediates are developed that are stabilized via hydrogen bonding interactions, in which the amido groups of residues Gly-193 and Ser-195 act as H-donors and the developing oxyanion intermediate is the acceptor (4Henderson R.

Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4293-4303Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Despite glycine being the far most convenient amino acid at position 193 for optimal transition state stabilization, rare examples are known in which this site is occupied by a non-glycine residue. The best characterized such enzyme is mesotrypsinogen (6Nyaruhucha C.N. Kito M. Fukuoka S.I. J. Biol.

Gene (Amst.). 1993; 136: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), in which an arginine can be found at position 193 (Fig. 1). Human trypsin 4 has recently been shown to selectively process myelin basic protein in vitro, the most abundant membrane protein in the central nervous system (10Medveczky P. Antal J. Patthy A. Kékesi K. Juhász G. Szilágyi L. Gráf L. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Upon proteolytic cleavage, it generates a peptide fragment comprising the sequence that is recognized by major antibodies found in patients with multiple sclerosis. These results suggest that human trypsin 4 may be one of the candidate proteases involved in the pathomechanism of this neurodegenerative disease. Other instances also exist when the non-glycine-possessing enzymes at position 193 are not to be considered as mutant proteins, but these variants represent the native enzymes; Trimeresurus stejnejeri plasminogen activator (11Zhang Y.

Laskowski Jr., M. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) belong to this group of site 193 variants. Naturally occurring 193 mutants are reported among coagulation factors, including Factor XI (13Zivelin A. Yatuv R. Livnat T. Bulvik S. Peretz H. Salomon O. Seligsohn U. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; (Abstr. P1111)PubMed Google Scholar), Factor IX (14Giannelli F. Green P.M. Sommer S.S. Lillicrap D.P. Ludwig M. Schwaab R. Reitsma P.H. Goossens M. Yoshioka A. Brownlee G.G.

Marchetti G. Hum. Mutat. 1996; 8: 108-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These enzymes were characterized biochemically and found to be altered in various aspects when compared with their Gly-193-possessing counterpart. Deficiency of autoactivation and impaired activation of other zymogens (16Szmola R. Kukor Z. Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol.

These observations and structural data (human trypsin 4, Protein Data Bank code: 1h4w (19Katona G. Berglund G.I. Hajdu J. Gráf L. Szilágyi L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 1209-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar)) together indicate that the interaction with their respective protein partners is hindered by steric clashes and/or electrostatic repulsions upon binding to them due to the bulky and/or charged side chain at position 193 (S2′ subsite according to the Schechter-Berger nomenclature (20Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4697) Google Scholar)). The R193G variant human trypsin 4 shows practically identical catalytic properties and sensitivity to canonical inhibitors as human trypsin 1 (16Szmola R. Kukor Z. Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48580-48589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Our recent results confirm this finding. The kcat on Z-GPR-pNA substrate increased ∼3-fold, and the Km increased 2-3-fold; thus the kcat/Km value did not change significantly upon the substitution of Gly-193 with arginine (21Medveczky P. Tóth J. Gráf L. Szilágyi L. Abbasi A. Ali S.A. Protein Structure-Function Relationship. BCC&T Press, Karachi, Pakistan2003: 41-53Google Scholar). The equilibrium dissociation constants of wild type human trypsin 4 toward canonical inhibitors increased 2-3 orders of magnitude when compared with the pancreatic isoform human trypsin 1. These altered kinetic parameters were restored upon the back mutation of Arg-193 to glycine. Based on these data, the R193G mutant human trypsin 4 can be considered as a model for the pancreatic trypsin isoform. Another effect of a non-glycine residue at position 193 is that the geometry of the 192-193 peptide bond is assumed to be distorted; thus the structure of the S1 binding site and the oxyanion hole are perturbed in the active enzyme (22Schmidt A.E. Ogawa T. Gailani D. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29485-29492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Another study on the structural and energetic consequences of the amino acid substitution at position 193 with a non-glycine residue in thrombin and in rat trypsin has been reported recently (23Bobofchak K.M. Pineda A.O. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25644-25650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). From kinetic and structural data, it has been deduced that Gly-193 contributes to substrate binding by the stabilization of both the ground and the transition states despite the lack of a drastic structural perturbation even in the G193P mutant. Although human trypsin 4 has been comprehensively characterized and diverse aspects have been examined, thermodynamic consequences of replacing the conserved glycine 193 with arginine on substrate hydrolysis are presently unknown in this enzyme. The aim of this work was to identify the enzymatic steps that are affected by the substitution of glycine with arginine at position 193 in human trypsin 4. Furthermore, we intended to shed light on the differences in the thermodynamics of substrate hydrolysis for the wild type and the R193G mutant 2Denomination of these enzymes might be confusing as the default amino acid at position 193 is glycine in serine proteases. Still, the arginine-possessing human trypsin 4 is a naturally occurring isoform and therefore designated as the wild type enzyme. The R193G variant might be termed a back mutant or revertant referring to the otherwise conserved glycine at this position. 2Denomination of these enzymes might be confusing as the default amino acid at position 193 is glycine in serine proteases.

In the present study, reactions of wild type and R193G mutant human trypsin 4 on 4-methylumbelliferyl 4-guanidinobenzoate (MUGB) 3The abbreviations used are: MUGB, 4-methylumbelliferyl 4-guanidinobenzoate; MU, methylumbelliferone; hTry4WT, wild type human trypsin 4; hTry4R193G, R193G mutant human trypsin 4; TI1, first tetrahedral intermediate; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. 3The abbreviations used are: MUGB, 4-methylumbelliferyl 4-guanidinobenzoate; MU, methylumbelliferone; hTry4WT, wild type human trypsin 4; hTry4R193G, R193G mutant human trypsin 4; TI1, first tetrahedral intermediate; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. fluorogenic substrate analogue were followed using a stopped flow apparatus. This substrate is convenient for the present study as it is known that deacylation is slower for MUGB than the acylation step, and the final reaction step being the rate-limiting event is the requisite for the unambiguous determination of the rate constants of all preceding steps. On the grounds of our kinetic data, we propose a refined model for the reaction of human trypsin 4 and its R193G mutant on MUGB substrate, where the acylation step can be kinetically separated from the preceding reversible step. We assign this event as the formation of the first tetrahedral intermediate. Thermodynamic analysis of the acylation process revealed a marked difference between these enzymes; formation of the first tetrahedral intermediate is highly exothermic and accompanied by a large entropy decrease for the wild type enzyme. In contrast, it is endothermic accompanied by entropy gain for the R193G mutant. We conclude that along the first stage of acylation, wild type human trypsin 4 passes through significant structural and/or dynamic conversions, whereas a different rearrangement occurs in the R193G mutant enzyme. Reagents—4-methylumbelliferyl 4-guanidinobenzoate and porcine enterokinase was purchased from Sigma. Isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside was purchased from Fermentas. Benzamidine-Sepharose™ 4 Fast Flow column was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. All other materials were of reagent grade and were obtained from various suppliers. Cloning and Expression of Human Trypsinogen 4 and Its Variants—Wild type human trypsinogen 4 was cloned as described previously (19Katona G. Berglund G.I. Hajdu J. Gráf L. Szilágyi L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 1209-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The mutation R193G was introduced by the megaprimer PCR mutagenesis method using the following mutant oligonucleotide primer: hTry4R193G 5′-TCC TGC CAG GGT GAC TCC GGT GGC-3′ (Invitrogen). The inactive human trypsin 4 mutant, in which Ser-195 of the catalytic triad is replaced by alanine, was generated with the same method using the following oligonucleotide: hTry4S195A 5′-CCT GCC AGC GTG ACG CTG GTG GCC CTG TG-3′. PCR products were cloned into the modified pET-17b vector (19Katona G. Berglund G.I. Hajdu J. Gráf L. Szilágyi L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 1209-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Proteins were expressed and refolded as described previously (17Szilágyi L. Kénesi E. Katona G. Kaslik G. Juhász G. Gráf L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24574-24580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The correct fold and disulfide bond arrangement of the zymogen was checked by SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions. Trypsinogen was activated by adding porcine enterokinase (1:1000 molar ratio) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2 followed by affinity purification on a benzamidine-Sepharose column and eluted with 10 mm HCl. Protein containing fractions were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration using a Centricon filter unit (Amicon) and kept in aliquots at -20 °C. Protein concentration was determined from absorption data calculated with the theoretical extinction coefficient ϵ280 = 40570 m-1 cm-1. Purity was assessed by 15% SDS-PAGE using the Laemmli buffer system (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Transient Kinetic Measurements—Stopped-flow transients were recorded on a KinTek SF-2004 instrument (KinTek Corp.) using a 450-watt Hg-Xe super-quiet lamp (Hamamatsu Corp.). Excitation wavelength was 365 nm with a bandwidth of 0.5 nm, and a WG420 nm cut-off filter (Comar Instruments) was used on the emission side. 8 ml/sec flow rate was applied, and sample volumes were 40 μl with a mixing ratio of 1:1. Fluorescence emission intensities were measured with a photomultiplier set to 700 V voltage. The dead time of the stopped flow apparatus is 1.0 ms. For the substrate saturation studies, 0.1 μm enzyme was mixed with 0.94-500 μm 4-methylumbelliferyl 4-guanidinobenzoate substrate analogue for the wild type and 0.94-200 μm substrate for the R193G mutant human trypsin 4 (concentrations are stated as final values in the reaction chamber). Buffer conditions were 20 mm Tricine, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0, at 20.0 °C. Data were collected on a logarithmic time base to ensure that a significant number of data points were recorded even for a multiphase process. The analyzed transients are averages of 4-7 recorded traces. To obtain information on the thermodynamic properties of the reaction, 0.1 μm enzyme was mixed with saturating concentrations of substrate (500 μm for wild type and 200 μm for the R193G mutant enzyme), and the reaction was monitored in 3 °C increments over the temperature range of 6-36 °C. Buffer conditions were 20 mm Tricine, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0 ± 0.1. Using the correlation ΔpKa/10 °C = -0.21 for Tricine, the pH was adjusted at room temperature to 7.6 - 8.2 to give the value of 8.0 ± 0.1 at different experimental temperatures. Kinetic and Thermodynamic Analysis—Reaction profiles were analyzed by fitting to double exponential functions using the KinTek software (KinTek Corp.) and OriginLab v7.5 (MicroCal Software). Data were corrected for spontaneous hydrolysis of the substrate, which proved to be significant at higher temperatures. Derivation of the individual rate constants is described under “Results.” Activation parameters were calculated from the linear plots of ln (k/T) versus 1/T according to Equation 1 (25Keleti T. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), where k is the rate constant, R is the gas constant (8.314 Jmol-1 K-1), T is the absolute temperature, NA is Avogadro's number, h is Planck's constant, the enthalpy of activation ΔH‡ = -slope × 8.314 Jmol-1, and the entropy of activation ΔS‡ = (intercept - 23.76) × 8.314 Jmol-1 K-1. The free energy of activation (ΔG‡) was calculated using Equation 2. ln(k/T)=ln(R/NAh)+ΔS‡/R-ΔH‡/RT(Eq. 1) ΔG‡=ΔH‡-TΔS‡(Eq. 2) Standard free energy changes for equilibria (ΔG°) were calculated from Equation 3.

The time course of fluorescence change during the reaction showed a burst phase with a subsequent linear phase for both enzymes (Fig. 2, A-C). Furthermore, the burst followed a double exponential with a fast and a slow observed rate constant. These observed rate constants had a hyperbolic dependence on substrate concentration (Fig. 3), indicating that the reversible substrate binding is followed by at least one further step. The fluorescent signal is generated along these subsequent steps, namely the chemical reaction. In addition, the double-phase character of the burst revealed two distinct, kinetically separable events during the hydrolysis of MUGB and indicated that the first one is a reversible step. Finally, the linear phase following the burst is the consequence of the liberation of the regenerated enzyme due to deacylation. Taking these observations together, the following schematic four-step model was assumed to describe the reactions. E+Sk1⇌k-1E·Sk2⇌k-2C*→K3E-P2+P1*→K4E-P2SCHEME 1 where E denotes the free enzyme, S stands for the substrate (MUGB), C is a covalent enzyme-substrate complex, P1 and P2 denote the first product (4-methylumbelliferone) and second product (guanidinobenzoate), respectively, and the species providing fluorescent signal are marked with an asterisk.FIGURE 3Rate data from double exponential fits of the reaction of wild type (A) and R193G human trypsin 4 (B) on MUGB substrate, plotted against substrate concentration. Traces could be described with a two-phase burst followed by a linear phase. Reaction profiles were analyzed by fitting to double exponential functions. Observed rate constants for the fast (•) and the slow phase (▴) of the burst are shown for the wild type (A) and the R193G mutant enzyme (B), respectively. The observed rate constants had a hyperbolic dependence on substrate concentration. Elementary rate constants were calculated using parameters of the fitted hyperbolas.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To validate the supposed mechanism, we probed whether the fluorescent signal is generated during the binding of the substrate or in subsequent reaction steps. We performed the experiments with the S195A mutant human trypsin 4, which is able to bind MUGB but cannot catalyze acylation. Upon mixing MUGB with the catalytically inactive variant enzyme (26Corey D.R. Craik C.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 1784-1790Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar), neither the burst nor the following linear phase could be detected. This finding indicates that predominant fluorescent signal is not generated during binding events. A lag phase was expected to appear at the initial phase of the time courses as the signal-generating step is preceded by another step, namely the binding of the substrate. However, we failed to detect any sign of a lag. A possible explanation for the lack of the lag phase is that ∼5% of the total fluorescence intensity appears upon the binding of MUGB to the active site of the enzyme. This presumption was confirmed by modeling the reaction with Berkeley Madonna software, which showed that a small fluorescence intensity increase upon the binding step readily compensates the lag phase, which thus becomes undetectable. We also assumed that the fluorescence intensity of 4-methylumbelliferone does not change significantly upon dissociation from the surface of the enzyme. The observed rate constants showed a hyperbolic dependence on substrate concentration. The plot of the observed rate constants against MUGB concentration yielded different profiles for the two enzymes (Fig. 3). The fast phase was half-saturated at about 148 μm MUGB and the maximal rate of 9.95 ± 0.4 s-1 for wild type human trypsin 4 and reached the value of 23.9 ± 1.4 s-1 with half-saturation at 58 μm substrate concentration for the R193G mutant enzyme at 20.0 °C. Linear fits to the initial part of the observed rate constant of the fast phase plotted against substrate concentration yielded an intercept of 0.23 ± 0.04 s-1 and an initial slope of 0.068 ± 0.0004 μm-1 s-1 for the wild type enzyme, whereas these values are 0.042 ± 0.006 s-1 and 0.38 ± 0.019 μm-1 s-1 for the R193G mutant. The slow phase got saturated at significantly lower substrate concentrations and had a maximal rate of 0.42 ± 0.03 s-1 for the wild type enzyme and 1.44 ± 0.27 s-1 for the glycine-possessing counterpart. Amplitude of the fast phase showed an increasing hyperbolic function, whereas the amplitude of the slow phase had a decreasing hyperbolic dependence on the substrate concentration for wild type human trypsin 4. In contrast, amplitudes of the fast and the slow phase were constant in the examined substrate concentration range for the R193G mutant. However, at saturating substrate concentrations, the fast phase is dominant for both enzymes; the relative amplitude of the fast phase comprises 95% of the total amplitude for the wild type and 85% for the R193G mutant enzyme at 20.0 °C. The ratio of amplitudes of the fast and the slow phase will be set by the equilibrium constant for the formation of the covalent enzyme-substrate complex (K2) (K2 = amplitude fast phase/amplitude slow phase). The observed rate constant of the fast phase will be a composite of the equilibrium constant and the forward rate constant of the second reaction step (kobs fast phase = k2 × (K2 + 1)/K2), and it will also be equal to the sum of the forward and reverse rate constants for this event (kobs fast phase = k2 + k-2) at saturating substrate concentration. Furthermore, the equilibrium dissociation constant for the substrate binding step (Kd = k-1/k1) is derived from the slope of the observed rate constant-substrate concentration function (kobs fast phase initial slope = k2/Kd). The observed rate constant of the slow phase will be a composite of the equilibrium constant of the second reaction step (K2) and the rate constant of the third step (kobs slow phase = k3 × K2/(K2 + 1). Finally, the linear phase following the burst corresponds to the steady state; thus the rate constant of deacylation can be derived from the slope of the linear phase (k4 = steady-state slope/(amplitude fast phase + amplitude slow phase). Elementary rate constants and equilibrium constants for the individual reaction steps were calculated using Equations 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 presented below and are summarized in Table 1.

The fluorescence change was monitored with excitation at 365 nm and emission detected through a 420 nm cut-off filter. The transients fitted to double exponentials followed by a linear phase. Elementary rate constants were calculated using Equations 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 presented under “Results.” Each value represents the mean and standard deviation of three and two independent data sets for the wild type and the R193G mutant enzyme, respectively, each originating from 5-7 recorded traces.hTry4WThTry4R193Gk2 (s-1)9.19 ± 0.0120.22 ± 1.4k-2 (s-1)0.81 ± 0.053.56 ± 0.006k3 (s-1)0.46 ± 0.021.70 ± 0.3k4 (s-1)(1.85 ± 0.51) × 10-3(3.28 ± 3.1) × 10-4K211.4 ± 0.75.68 ± 0.4 Open table in a new tab Comparison of the Catalytic Cycle of the Wild Type and R193G Mutant Human Trypsin 4—We studied the effect of R193G substitution in human trypsin 4 on the catalytic process on 4-methylumbelliferyl 4-guanidinobenzoate substrate. Using transient kinetics, we examined which enzymatic steps and states are affected by this mutation. Data originating from the substrate saturation experiments are presented in Table 1. The value of the equilibrium dissociation constant shows 2-3-fold difference (Kd hTry4WT = 136.1 ± 0.8 μm, Kd hTry4R193G = 53.55 ± 6.6 μm), indicating that energetically, the R193G mutation does not have a significant effect on the strength of MUGB binding (ΔG° binding hTry4WT = -11.9 kJmol-1 at 293 K, ΔG° binding hTry4R193G = -9.7 kJmol-1 at 293 K). The formation of the covalent enzyme-substrate complex for both enzymes proved to be reversible. The forward rate constant of this step is two times smaller (k2 hTry4WT = 9.19 ± 0.01 s-1, k2 hTry4R193G = 20.22 ± 1.4 s-1), and the reverse rate constant is four times more moderate for hTry4WT (k-2 hTry4WT = 0.81 ± 0.05 s-1, k-2 hTry4R193G = 3.56 ± 0.006 s-1); thus the equilibrium of the second reaction step is shifted more toward the forward direction in the wild type enzyme (K2 hTry4WT = 11.4 ± 0.7, K2 hTry4R193G = 5.68 ± 0.4). The next event is 3-4 times slower in the wild type enzyme (k3 hTry4WT = 0.46 ± 0.02 s-1, k3 hTry4R193G = 1.70 ± 0.29 s-1). MUGB is turned over by both enzymes. Deacylation is slightly (5-6 times) faster by hTry4WT than by the R193G mutant enzyme (k4 hTry4WT = (1.85 ± 0.51) × 10-3 s-1, k4 hTry4R193G = (3.28 ± 3.06) × 10-4 s-1).

https://openalex.org/W2039072415,"Parkinson disease is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer disease. A subset of genetic forms of Parkinson disease has been attributed to alpha-synuclein, a synaptic protein with remarkable chaperone properties. Synphilin-1 is a cytoplasmic protein that has been identified as a partner of alpha-synuclein (Engelender, S., Kaminsky, Z., Guo, X., Sharp, A. H., Amaravi, R. K., Kleiderlein, J. J., Margolis, R. L., Troncoso, J. C., Lanahan, A. A., Worley, P. F., Dawson, V. L., Dawson, T. M., and Ross, C. A. (1999) Nat. Gen. 22, 110-114), but its function remains totally unknown. We show here for the first time that synphilin-1 displays an antiapoptotic function in the control of cell death. We have established transient and stable transfectants overexpressing wild-type synphilin-1 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, telecephalon-specific murine 1 neurons, and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, and we show that both cell systems display lower responsiveness to staurosporine and 6-hydroxydopamine. Thus, synphilin-1 reduces procaspase-3 hydrolysis and thereby caspase-3 activity and decreases poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, two main indicators of apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, we establish that synphilin-1 drastically reduces p53 transcriptional activity and expression and lowers p53 promoter transactivation and mRNA levels. Interestingly, we demonstrate that synphilin-1 catabolism is enhanced by staurosporine and blocked by caspase-3 inhibitors. Accordingly, we show by transcription/translation assay that recombinant caspase-3 and, to a lesser extent, caspase-6 but not caspase-7 hydrolyze synphilin-1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mutated synphilin-1, in which a consensus caspase-3 target sequence has been disrupted, resists proteolysis by cellular and recombinant caspases and displays drastically reduced antiapoptotic phenotype. We further show that the caspase-3-derived C-terminal fragment of synphilin-1 was probably responsible for the antiapoptotic phenotype elicited by the parent wild-type protein. Altogether, our study is the first demonstration that synphilin-1 harbors a protective function that is controlled by the C-terminal fragment generated by its proteolysis by caspase-3."
https://openalex.org/W2050405794,"Basal transcription of the bone sialoprotein gene is mediated by highly conserved inverted CCAAT (ICE; ATTGG) and TATA elements (TTTATA) separated by precisely 21 nucleotides. Here we studied the importance of the relative position and orientation of the CCAAT and TATA elements in the proximal promoter by measuring the transcriptional activity of a series of mutated reporter constructs in transient transfection assays. Whereas inverting the TTTATA (wild type) to a TATAAA (consensus TATA) sequence increased transcription slightly, transcription was reduced when the flanking dinucleotides were also inverted. In contrast, reversing the ATTGG (wild type; ICE) to a CCAAT (RICE) sequence caused a marked reduction in transcription, whereas both transcription and NF-Y binding were progressively increased with the simultaneous inversion of flanking nucleotides (f-RICE-f). Reducing the distance between the ICE and TATA elements produced cyclical changes in transcriptional activity that correlated with progressive alterations in the relative positions of the CCAAT and TATA elements on the face of the DNA helix. Minimal transcription was observed after 5 nucleotides were deleted (equivalent to approximately one half turn of the helix), whereas transcription was fully restored after deleting 10 nucleotides (approximately one full turn of the DNA helix), transcriptional activity being progressively lost with deletions beyond 10 nucleotides. In comparison, when deletions were made with the ICE in the reversed (f-RICE-f) orientation transcriptional activity was progressively lost with no recovery. These results show that, although transcription can still occur when the CCAAT box is reversed and/or displaced relative to the TATA box, the activity is dependent upon the flexibility of the intervening DNA helix needed to align the NF-Y complex on the CCAAT box with preinitiation complex proteins that bind to the TATA box. Thus, the precise location and orientation of the CCAAT element is necessary for optimizing basal transcription of the bone sialoprotein gene.

Regulation of class II nuclear gene promoters involves interaction between transcriptional activators and coactivators and accessory proteins with general transcription factors that form the preinitiation complex (PIC) 2The abbreviations used are: PIC, preinitiation complex; BSP, bone sialoprotein; ICE, inverted CCAAT element; RICE, reversed ICE; TBP, TATA-binding protein; nts, nucleotides; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; OPN, osteopontin; DSPP, dentin sialophosphoprotein; WT, wild type.

Many polymerase II promoters contain a TATA box (3Patikoglou G.A. Kim J.L. Sun L. Yang S.-H. Kodadek T. Burley S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3217-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) through which TFIID binds and directs the assembly of other transcription factors and RNAPII to form the PIC required to initiate transcription (4Nikolov D.B. Burley S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). TFIID consists of the TATA-binding protein (TBP), which binds specifically and with high affinity to the TATA box (5Burley S.K. Roeder R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 769-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 6Tan S. Richmond T.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and TBP-associated factors (TAFs), which confer the specificity of TFIID for polymerase II promoters. The TFIID complex also provides the primary anchor for the assembly of the multimeric PIC that recruits RNAPII (1Pugh B.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 7Burley S.K. Kamada K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). TBP is a saddle-shaped protein that binds to the minor groove of the TATA element and is characteristically positioned ∼30 base pairs upstream of the transcriptional start site. The directionality of transcription is primarily determined by the linear order of the upstream activator sequence relative to the TATA box rather than by the orientation of these elements (8Xu L.C. Thali M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6699-6704Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A CCAAT box is frequently found in close proximity to promoter elements, and in many cases, a precise distance is required for optimal transcription (9Romier C. Cocchiarella F. Mantovani R. Moras D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1336-1345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). CCAAT boxes are generally conserved within the same gene across species in terms of position, orientation, and flanking sequences. They are located, in either forward or reverse orientation, as a single copy element between nts –60 and –100 of the transcription start site in 30% of eukaryotic promoters (10Mantovani R. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 239: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). The CCAAT box is a targeting sequence of NF-Y as well as CTF/NF1 (CCAAT transcription factor/nuclear factor 1), C/EBP (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein), and CDP (CCAAT displacement protein) (11Maity S.N. Crombrugghe B.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 174-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 12Mantovani R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). NF-Y can be distinguished from the other CCAAT-binding proteins on the basis of a specific DNA sequence requirement flanking the CCAAT element. NF-Y binding to the CCAAT sequence transactivates the basal gene expression of the PIC complex. NF-Y comprises three subunits (subunits A, B, and C), each having a DNA-binding domain, which are required for CCAAT binding and transactivation. Subunits B and C contain a histone fold motif, through which they interact to form a tight dimer. Subunits A and C also contain conserved Q-rich domains that have a transcriptional activation function (13Bellorini M. Lee D.K. Dantonel J.C. Zemzoumi K. Roeder R.G. Tora L. Mantovani R.

Med. 1999; 10: 79-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Basal transcription of the BSP gene requires functional CCAAT and TATA boxes, which are characteristically inverted and separated by only 21 nucleotides (19Kim R. Shapiro H. Li J.J. Wrana J. Sodek J.

Although an inverted CCAAT element (ICE) is known to be functional and is commonly used for binding NF-Y (10Mantovani R. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 239: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), the inverted TATA box in the BSP gene was the first identified in eukaryotic organisms (19Kim R. Shapiro H. Li J.J.

The unusual arrangement of the CCAAT and TATA boxes in BSP therefore provides a unique opportunity to study the importance of the relative orientation and separation of these elements in the basal transcription of a natural gene promoter. These studies show that both the position and orientation of the CCAAT element relative to the TATA boxes are important for optimizing basal transcription of the BSP gene. Cell Culture—Rat osteosarcoma cells (ROS 17/2.8) (provided by Dr. Gideon Rodan, Merck-Frost, Philadelphia, PA) and RBMC-D8 cells were grown in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (penicillin G, 100 μg/ml; gentamicin sulfate, 50 μg/ml; and fungizone, 25 μg/ml). Preparation of Rat BSP Promoter Constructs—All of the constructs used in this study are based on –60 BSP Luc, in which –60 to +60 of the rat BSP promoter sequence was blunt end-ligated into SmaI site of pGL3-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI). The following constructs were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA): constructs with a single point-mutated CCAAT box, tTTGG; with a reversed CCAAT box, RICE; with the TATA element inverted, tataaa; with both the wild type ICE and TATA reversed, RICE+tataaa; with 2 nts on each side of the TATA inverted (from GG to CC) with the TATA box, Rvt-flTATA; and with both the ICE and the flanking nts of TATA reversed, RICE+RflTATA. To prepare 1) a series of promoter constructs with deletions between the ICE (and mutated ICE) and TATA boxes; 2) a series of RICE with flanking sequences inverted; 3) the reversed ICE with 5 flanking nucleotides, (f5-RICE-f5); 4) the ICE in a 3′ → 5′ orientation with five flanking nucleotides, f5-FlipC-f5; and 5) the RICE in a 3′ → 5′ orientation with five flanking nucleotides f5-FlipRICE-f5, –60 BSP Luc was first digested with NheI/XhoI. The 130-bp NheI/XhoI fragment was then further digested with MboII to obtain the 84-bp MboII/XhoI “adaptor” fragment. Oligonucleotides with 5′-NheI sites and 3′-MboII sites and with those required mutations were ordered from Invitrogen Canada Inc. (Burlington, Canada). The annealed complementary oligonucleotides, the 84-bp adapter, and the NheI/XhoI-digested and dephosphorylated –60 BSP Luc were then ligated at +16 °C overnight. All of the constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Transcription Assays—ROS 17/2.8 and RBMC-D8 cells were plated on 24-well cell culture plates (0.4 × 105/well) 24 h prior to transfection. The cells (60% confluent) were then transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). A total of 1.0 μg of DNA was used for transfection, either 1 μg of BSP promoter construct or 0.5 μg of BSP promoter construct plus 0.5 μg of NF-YA WT or NF-YA-DN expression vector (23Mantovani R.

A Renilla luciferase expression vector phRL-SV40 (Promega) was used as an internal control (1/1000 of total DNA). The cells were harvested 24 h after transfection. The cell lysates were prepared with the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega), and luciferase was analyzed on a Berthold Lumat LB-9501. EMSA—Nuclear extracts used for EMSA were prepared from ROS 17/2.8 cells as described (24Kim R.H. Sodek J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 565-571PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of the nuclear extract were measured using the Bio-Rad assay. Pure NF-Y protein and an antibody against NF-YB were prepared as described previously (23Mantovani R. Pessara U.

Double-stranded oligonucleotides used for EMSA were synthesized by Invitrogen. The double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen). 2.5 μg of nuclear extracts, or 1 μg of recombinant NF-Y were incubated with 50,000 dpm of labeled oligonucleotides at room temperature (21 °C). The nuclear extracts were incubated with or without antibody to NF-Y (23Mantovani R. Pessara U. Tronche F. Li X.Y. Knapp A.M. Pasquali J.L. Benoist C. Mathis D.

The sequences of the probes used are (only the sense strands are shown) as follows: s-CCAAT (ICE), CCGTGACCGTGATTGGCT-GCTGAGAG; RICE, CCGTGACCGTGccaatCTGCTGAGAG; f2-RICE-f2, CCGTGACCGagccaatcaGCTGAGAG; f5-RICE-f5, CCGTGAagcagccaatcacggGAGAG; f7-RICE-f7, CCGTtcagcagccaatcacggtcGAG; f8-RICE-f8, CCGctcagcagccaatcacggtcaAG; f9-RICE-f9, CctctcagcagccaatcacggtcacG; and f10-RICE-f10, Cctctcagcagccaatcacggtcacg. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays (ChIP)—The ChIP procedure was adapted from Mao et al. (25Mao D.Y. Barsyte-Lovejoy D. Ho C.S. Watson J.D. Stojanova A. Penn L.Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3462-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were plated on 15-cm plates 24-h prior to transfection. For each pull-down, 1 × 107 cells were used. HeLa cells grown to ∼60% confluence were transfected with total DNA of 18.6 μg/plate (–60 bsp Luc, tTTGG, RICE, or D10), using 93 μl/15-cm plate Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The cells were incubated for 44 h and fixed in 1% (v/v) formaldehyde. The extracted chromatin was sonicated (7 × 10 s at 13 W to fragment DNA to an average size of 600 bp) and then immunoprecipitated using antibodies that recognize NF-YA (CBF-B (H-209); Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or normal rabbit serum as a negative control. The chromatin immunoprecipitate was de-cross-linked with 0.3 m of NaCl. The bound DNA was PCR-amplified using promoter-specific primers, resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, and then visualized by UV fluorescence. ChIP-PCR primers (5′ to 3′) bsp_fwd (GTGACCGTGTTTGGCTGCTGAG) and Luc_rvs (TTGCTCTCCAGCGGTTCCAT) generated a DNA fragment of 254 bp.

Conservation of the Mammalian BSP Promoters—Comparison of the proximal promoter sequences of the human, rat, and mouse BSP genes has shown a highly conserved ICE and an inverted TATA box, which are separated by 21 nucleotides (18Ganss B. Kim R.H. Sodek J. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1999; 10: 79-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In addition, there is high sequence identity in the promoter sequences, particularly in the regions flanking the pentanucleotide CCAAT element. Notably, other SIBLING (small integrin-binding ligand N-linked glycoprotein) family members, rodent osteopontin (OPN) and dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) genes also include an inverted CCAAT box upstream from an atypical TATA box (Fig. 1). Whereas the TATA box in BSP is perfectly inverted relative to the consensus TATAAA sequence, in the TATA boxes of the OPN and DSPP promoters the penultimate thymidine is replaced by an adenosine. In the OPN gene the distance between the ICE and TATA elements is also 21 nts, whereas these elements are separated by 22 nts in the DSPP gene. To study the importance of the orientation and relative positions of the CCAAT and TATA elements, we analyzed the effects of a series of mutations on the transcriptional activity of a short promoter construct pBSP+60 to –60 ligated to a luciferase report gene. The strategy employed in these studies is depicted in Fig. 2.FIGURE 2Transcription assays of BSP promoter constructs with ICE and TATA elements at different orientations. Schematic diagram of cloning strategies used for preparing promoter constructs RICE, f5-FlipC-f5, and f5-FlipRICE-f5 are shown on the left side. NF-Y is depicted as the trimer of YA, YB, and YC. The 5 nts on each side of the ICE box are shown as a gradient bar with the head pointing to the consensus 3′ side of CCAAT-flanking sequence. Further deletions of 5 or 10 nts between the ICE and the TATA were constructed based on f5-FlipC-f5, and f5-FlipRICE-f5. Shown on the right side is the transcriptional activity of the 1) wild type, –60 BSP Luc; and the constructs with the following mutations: 2) ICE with A mutated to T; 3) reversed ICE (RICE); 4) f5-FlipC-f5, where the ICE is flipped with 5 nts on both sides; 5) f5-FlipRICE-f5, where the ICE is reoriented to GGTTA along with 5 nts on both sides; 6) TATA box, reversed to a consensus TATAAA sequence; and 7) ICE and TATA elements both reversed. The data (±S.D.) represent one of three experiments, which produced consistent results.

When the pentanucleotide ICE box alone was reversed (RICE) to a 5′ → 3′ CCAAT sequence, transcription measured in ROS 17/2.8 osteosarcoma cells was markedly reduced but not to the extent observed with a single nucleotide mutation in the ICE box, whereas reversing the TATA resulted in a modest but reproducible increase in transcription (Fig. 2), as found previously (20Li J.J. Kim R.H. Sodek J. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). When both elements were reversed, transcription was reduced but not to the same extent as reversing the ICE box alone, probably because of the more favorable effect of the change in the TATA box orientation. As anticipated, no transcriptional activity was obtained when either the CCAAT or ICE sequence was placed in a 3′ → 5′ orientation. Flanking Sequences and Transcription—To determine the importance of the flanking sequences, two nucleotides on each side of the TTTATA element were reversed with the inverted TATA sequence (Fig. 3). This change in flanking nucleotides reduced transcription with the ICE box left intact and more extensively when the orientation of the ICE was reversed (i.e. ICE → RICE). In comparison, when the flanking sequence was reversed with the ICE (f-RICE-f), transcription was progressively increased with an increase of flanking nucleotides until 5 nucleotides on each side had been reversed. With 5 flanking nucleotides reversed with the ICE, transcription approached the rate for the control WT promoter. However, reversing additional flanking nucleotides, beyond 5 nucleotides, resulted in decreased transcription (Fig. 3). Notably, the three nucleotides on the 5′ side and on the 3′ side in the reversed sequence conform to the consensus sequence determined for NF-Y binding (Fig. 1). When cells were cotransfected with an expression vector for the NF-YA subunit, luciferase activities were increased proportionately for each construct, indicating an enhancement of the NF-Y-mediated transcription. Thus, although the orientation of the TATA element is not critical for TBP binding, the nature of the flanking nucleotides appear to be important. In contrast to the TATA box, the flanking sequence must be reversed with the ICE sequence to obtain a functional CCAAT box. Flanking Sequences and EMSA—To determine whether the reversed flanking sequences were important for retaining NF-Y interactions, transcription factor binding was assessed by EMSA using nuclear extracts from ROS 17/2.8 cells (Fig. 4). With control oligonucleotides encompassing the ICE box and its normal flanking sequences (WT) gel shifts identified a strong band that was efficiently supershifted with antibodies to NF-YB and two minor more quickly migrating bands that were unaffected by NF-Y antibodies (26Su M. Bansal A.K. Mantovani R. Sodek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38365-38375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). With the RICE sequence, a new major band was seen together with a diffuse faster migrating band that migrated differently from the original minor bands. However, with only two 5′- and 3′-flanking nucleotides reversed with the RICE, the EMSA pattern showed the original minor bands and the major band shifted with NF-Y antibodies, albeit in a lower amount than seen with the WT probe. Further increases in reversed flanking sequence produced progressive increases in NF-Y binding, with maximal binding seen with 10 flanking nucleotides reversed. The progressive increase in NF-Y binding was also evident when shifts were performed with recombinant NF-Y, confirming that the major band in the nuclear shifts was NF-Y and that maximal binding of NF-Y occurred with 10 flanking nucleotides. Although the increases in NF-Y binding corresponded to increases in transcription with <5 nucleotides reversed, thereafter transcription activity was decreased, whereas NF-Y binding was further increased (Figs. 3 and 4). Separation of the ICE and TATA Boxes—To investigate the importance of position and orientation of the CCAAT box relative to the inverted TATA box, the distance separating these elements was reduced by introducing nucleotide deletions between the ICE and TATA boxes. As a result transcription was progressively decreased with maximal reduction observed after the deletion of ∼5 nucleotides (Fig. 5). Thereafter, transcription remained low until after 10 deletions, when transcriptional activity was fully restored and was frequently above that observed with the WT promoter. Beyond 10 deletions, transcription was progressively and completely lost. Notably, the decrease after 12 deletions occurred despite the retention of 5 flanking nucleotides on the 3′ side of the ICE box, suggesting that the decrease was not due to compromised transcription factor recognition. To demonstrate that NF-Y-mediated transcription was maintained following the deletion of nucleotides, ROS 17/2.8 cells were cotransfected with NF-YA, which increased transcription in all of the deleted constructs (Fig. 5B). The study was also replicated in a normal rat bone marrow cell line, RBMC-D8, in which cotransfection with a NF-Y-DN vector suppressed the transcriptional activity consistent with NF-YA-mediated transcription (Fig. 5C). Notably, the degree of stimulation by NF-YA and suppression by NF-Y-DN was variable, which may reflect the effect of positional differences on relative expression levels. To confirm that NF-Y binds to the CCAAT box in the undeleted and deleted constructs in vivo, chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses were conducted in HeLa cells, which express high levels of NF-Y. Following transfection with the WT construct or the 10-nucleotide-deleted construct (D10), promoter complexes were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to NF-Y (αCBF-B) and a promoter sequence encompassing the CCAAT region amplified by PCR. A band corresponding to the input DNA was strongly amplified for the WT and D10 constructs (Fig. 6), whereas only a weak amplification was observed with transfected promoter constructs in which the CCAAT box was either reversed (RICE) or included a single base mutation (tTTGG). These studies show that NF-Y binding in vivo is retained in the deletion construct. Separation of the RICE and TATA Boxes—To determine the relationship between the orientation of the CCAAT box and its distance from the TATA box, deletions were introduced between the TATA and 5f-RICE-f5, in which transcriptional activity is essentially optimal for the reversed CCAAT element. With the ICE sequence reversed, transcription was also reduced progressively with nucleotide deletions (Fig. 7). However, contrasting the results with the WT promoter, the transcriptional activity was further reduced beyond 5 deletions with minimal transcription observed after 10 deletions. To complete these analyses we also examined transcriptional activity when the ICE box sequences, together with 5 flanking nucleotides on each side were reversed (flipped) in direction from their 5′ → 3′ orientation to a 3′ → 5′ orientation (Fig. 2). In both cases, transcriptional activity was lost, and no effect was observed when intervening nucleotides were deleted (Fig. 7), indicating that the 5′ → 3′ direction of the CCAAT box (whether in the ICE or f5-RICE-f5 orientation) is critical for transcription factor binding. The results obtained in this series of experiments could be explained according to the stereochemical relationship between the orientation and position of the ICE (or RICE) and the TATA elements, as shown in Fig. 8. In the normal promoter the position and orientation of the ICE box in relation to the TATA box is conducive to transcription. However, although the orientation of the CCAAT-binding transcription factor is retained, its position relative to the TATA box is changed as deletions are introduced; each deletion not only shortening the distance from the TATA box but also changing its relative position on the face of the DNA helix. Thus, after five deletions the ICE box has rotated ∼180°, and its position is maximally removed from alignment with the TATA, and minimal transcription activity is seen. Although the rate of transcription is compromised, presumably because of the energy required to twist the DNA, there would appear to be sufficient distance to allow the intervening DNA to bend and thereby allow interaction between the CCAAT-binding transcription factor complex and PIC proteins. When the ICE sequence is reversed with its flanking sequence (f5-RICE-f5), the DNA is distorted to allow the RICE-binding transcription factor to “flip” orientation and interact with the PIC complex. This appears to be possible because transcriptional activity is similar to the WT constructs and indeed loss of transcription with five nucleotide deletions is similar to the reduction with the WT promoter construct. However, with further deletions there is insufficient intervening DNA to allow the flip to occur, so recovery of transcription, when the RICE and TATA are realigned at 10 deletions, is not observed. These studies have investigated the importance of the stereochemical relationship between the ICE and inverted TATA elements that are required for basal transcription and whose position and orientation are conserved in a large number of eukaryotic genes, including BSP and SIBLING family members. Although reversing the inverted TATA into a classical TATAAA element resulted in a modest increase in transcription, a similar reversal of the ICE box sequence (RICE) caused a loss of transcriptional activity. However, transcriptional activity could be recovered by reversing the flanking nucleotides with the ICE. By deleting nucleotides to reduce the separation of"
