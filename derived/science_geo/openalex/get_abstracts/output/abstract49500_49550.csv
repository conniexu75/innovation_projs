https://openalex.org/W2056222360,"gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is one of the major inhibitory neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. In the cerebral cortex, GABA-containing cells represent a subpopulation of interneurons. With semithin frozen sections, it is possible to demonstrate that most GABA neurons in the rat somatosensory cortex contain the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin and that parvalbumin is found virtually only in GABA neurons. Parvalbumin seems to influence the electrical properties and enzymatic machinery to modulate neuronal excitability and activity. The specific role of parvalbumin in GABA-containing cortical cells may be related to controlling the effectiveness of their inhibitory action."
https://openalex.org/W1968048563,"2-Deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography performed in human infants during development revealed progressive changes in local cerebral glucose utilization. In infants 5 weeks of age and younger, glucose utilization was highest in the sensorimotor cortex, thalamus, midbrain-brainstem, and cerebellar vermis. By 3 months, glucose metabolic activity had increased in the parietal, temporal, and occipital cortices and the basal ganglia, with subsequent increases in frontal and various association regions occurring by 8 months. These functional changes measured with positron emission tomography are in agreement with behavioral, neurophysiological, and anatomical alterations known to occur during infant development."
https://openalex.org/W2023089345,"In mammals different isoforms of myosin heavy chain are encoded by the members of a multigene family. The expression of each gene of this family is regulated in a tissue- and developmental stage-specific manner as well as by hormonal and various pathological stimuli. In this study the molecular basis of isoform switches induced in myosin heavy chain by thyroid hormone was investigated. The expression of the myosin heavy chain gene family was analyzed in seven different muscles of adult rats subjected to hypo- or hyperthyroidism with complementary DNA probes specific for six different myosin heavy chain genes. The results demonstrate that all six genes are responsive to thyroid hormone. More interestingly, the same myosin heavy chain gene can be regulated by thyroid hormone in highly different modes, even in opposite directions, depending on the tissue in which it is expressed. Furthermore, the skeletal embryonic and neonatal myosin heavy chain genes, so far considered specific to these two developmental stages, can be reinduced by hypothyroidism in specific adult muscles."
https://openalex.org/W1968631710,"Lambda repressors bind cooperatively to adjacent pairs of operator sites. Here we show that repressors bind cooperatively to pairs of operator sites whose centers have been separated by five or six turns of the helix. No cooperativity is observed when the centers of these sites are on opposite sides of the DNA helix. Cooperativity depends upon the same part of the protein (the carboxyl domain) that mediates cooperativity when the sites are adjacent. As the repressors bind, the DNA between the sites becomes alternately sensitive and resistant to DNAase I cleavage at half turn intervals. We suggest that when repressors bind cooperatively to separated sites, the DNA forms a loop, thus allowing the two repressors to touch."
https://openalex.org/W2007434276,"The clonal development of oligodendrocytes was studied by culturing individual oligodendrocyte-type-2 astrocyte (O-2A) progenitor cells on monolayers of type-1 astrocytes, which stimulate O-2A progenitor cells to divide. Oligodendrocytes developed by a proliferative lineage in which clonal progeny differentiated together after a number of cell divisions. Most O-2A progenitor cells had similar cell cycle times (1â€“2 days), but their proliferative capacity varied greatly: some divided only once while others divided up to eight times before differentiating. Sister cells behaved similarly when recultured separately on astrocyte monolayers. These findings are consistent with the cell-division-counting hypothesis previously proposed to explain the timing of oligodendrocyte differentiation. They also unambiguously establish the phenotype of O-2A progenitor cells in vitro and demonstrate that these cells respond directly to growth factors produced by type-1 astrocyte monolayers."

Efforts to isolate bases for these differences involved testing children on other achievement and cognitive tasks, interviewing mothers and teachers, and observing children in their classrooms. Cognitive abilities of children in the three countries are similar, but large differences exist in the children's life in school, the attitudes and beliefs of their mothers, and the involvement of both parents and children in schoolwork."
https://openalex.org/W2082833702,"We described a cell free system involving total homogenates of metaphase CHO cells, which yields telophase-like assembly of nuclear envelopes around mitotic chromosomes. During formation of the nuclear envelope in vitro, the three major lamina polypeptides (lamins A, B, and C) assemble around chromosomes and become dephosphorylated, similar to their behavior in vivo during telophase. Nuclear lamina and envelope assembly apparently do not require free ATP and are strongly inhibited by gamma-S-ATP, supporting the notion that these processes are regulated by protein dephosphorylation. Immunological depletion of disassembled lamins from the initial assembly system results in strong inhibition of subsequent nuclear envelope assembly, directly demonstrating that the lamins are involved in this process."

https://openalex.org/W2077476788,"Electrogenic Na-Ca exchange has been known to act in the cardiac sarcolemma as a major mechanism for extruding Ca ions. Ionic flux measurements in cardiac vesicles have recently suggested that the exchange ratio is probably 3 Na:1 Ca, although a membrane current generated by such a process has not been isolated. Using the intracellular perfusion technique combined with the whole-cell voltage clamp, we were able to load Na+ inside and Ca2+ outside the single ventricular cells of the guinea pig and have succeeded in recording an outward Na-Ca exchange current while blocking most other membrane currents. The current is voltage-dependent, blocked by La3+ and does not develop in the absence of intracellular free Ca2+. This report presents the first direct measurement of the cardiac Na-Ca exchange current, and should facilitate the study of Ca2+ fluxes during cardiac activity, together with various electrical changes attributable to the Na-Ca exchange and the testing of proposed models."
https://openalex.org/W2041985227,"We previously isolated an unusual hamster cell mutant (ldlD) that does not express LDL receptor activity unless it is cocultivated with other cells or grown in high concentrations of serum. We now show that ldlD cells are deficient in the enzyme UDP-galactose and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) 4-epimerase. When ldlD cells are grown in glucose-based media, they cannot synthesize enough UDP-galactose and UDP-GalNAc to allow normal synthesis of glycolipids and glycoproteins. The 4-epimerase deficiency accounts for all glycosylation defects previously observed in ldlD cells, including production of abnormal LDL receptors. All abnormal phenotypes of ldlD cells can be fully corrected by exogenous galactose and GalNAc. The separate effects of these sugars on LDL receptor activity suggest that O-linked carbohydrate chains are crucial for receptor stability. ldlD cells may be useful for structural and functional studies of many proteins, proteoglycans, and glycolipids containing galactose or GalNAc."
https://openalex.org/W1766057950,"The initial contractile event in muscle is the binding of Ca2+ ions to troponin C of the troponin complex, leading to a series of conformational changes in the members of the thin and thick filaments. Knowledge of the crystal structure of turkey skeletal muscle troponin C has provided a structural basis for the modeling of the first stage of this process in atomic detail. This crystal structure probably represents the molecule in the relaxed state of muscle, with two of the maximum of 4 Ca2+ ions bound. The basis for the model presented here is that upon binding of the additional two Ca2+ ions, the regulatory domain of the molecule undergoes a conformational transition to become closely similar in structure to the domain which always binds Ca2+ or Mg2+ under physiological conditions. The root mean square discrepancy in atomic coordinates between the apo and the modeled Ca2+-bound states of the regulatory domain is 4.8 A, with some shifts as large as 10-15 A in the region near the linker between the two Ca2+ binding sites. It is demonstrated that this Ca2+-bound conformation of the regulatory domain conforms to accepted protein structure rules and that the change in conformation can be accomplished without encountering any barriers too high to be surmounted on the physiological time scale."
https://openalex.org/W2041796969,"Theoretical investigations of the transition structures of additions and cycloadditions reveal details about the geometries of bond-forming processes that are not directly accessible by experiment. The conformational analysis of transition states has been developed from theoretical generalizations about the preferred angle of attack by reagents on multiple bonds and predictions of conformations with respect to partially formed bonds. Qualitative rules for the prediction of the stereochemistries of organic reactions have been devised, and semi-empirical computational models have also been developed to predict the stereoselectivities of reactions of large organic molecules, such as nucleophilic additions to carbonyls, electrophilic hydroborations and cycloadditions, and intramolecular radical additions and cycloadditions."

https://openalex.org/W2133928103,"The anomalous scattering data from five Cd in the native protein were used to determine the crystal structure of cadmium, zinc (Cd,Zn) metallothionein isoform II from rat liver. The structure of a 4-Cd cluster was solved by direct methods. A 2.3 A resolution electron density map was calculated by iterative single-wavelength anomalous scattering. The structure is folded into two domains. The amino terminal domain (beta) of residues 1 to 29 enfolds a three-metal cluster of one Cd and two Zn atoms coordinated by six terminal cysteine thiolate ligands and three bridging cysteine thiolates. The carboxyl terminal domain (alpha) of residues 30 to 61 enfolds a 4-Cd cluster coordinated by six terminal and five bridging cysteine thiolates. All seven metal sites have tetrahedral coordination geometry. The domains are roughly spherical, and the diameter is 15 to 20 A; there is limited contact between domains. The folding of alpha and beta is topologically similar but with opposite chirality. Redundant, short cysteine-containing sequences have similar roles in cluster formation in both alpha and beta."
https://openalex.org/W1993657614,"The pattern of connections between the retina and midbrain has been determined with electrophysiological and neuroanatomical methods in bats representing the two major subdivisions of the Chiroptera. Megachiropteran fruit bats (megabats), Pteropus spp., were found to have an advanced retinotectal pathway with a vertical hemidecussation of the kind previously found only in primates. In contrast, the microchiropteran bat Macroderma gigas has the ""ancestral"" or symplesiomorphous pattern of retinotectal connections so far found in all vertebrates except primates. In addition to linking primates and megachiropteran bats, these findings suggest that flight may have evolved twice among the mammals."

https://openalex.org/W2014887842,"A rod-shaped bacterium has been isolated that kills male eggs of the wasp Nasonia vitripennis, a pupal parasite of flies. Only some wasps of this species express this son-killer trait, and these wasps have bacterial infections in various organs. The bacterium was isolated from son-killer wasp tissue and from the hemolymph of fly pupae parasitized by wasps expressing the son-killer trait. Bacteria are apparently transferred to parasitized fly pupae during wasp oviposition, and developing wasp offspring are subsequently infected perorally. Sex-ratio distortion by microorganisms is found in a variety of plants and animals. The infectious peroral transmission of this trait variety of plants and animals. The infectious peroral transmission of this trait is in contrast to the typical pattern of cytoplasmic inheritance of sex-ratio distortion in these other systems."
https://openalex.org/W2019540487,"Because infant rats learn about odors that elicit suckling, and because certain chemosensory cues that help elicit mating behavior in adults are similar to those that elicit suckling, an experiment was undertaken to assess the influence of suckling-associated odors experienced during infancy on adult sexual behavior. Rat pups lived with and suckled dams whose nipple and vaginal odors were altered with citral, a lemon scent. The rats were weaned and never exposed again, until testing, to citral or females. At about 100 days of age, the males were paired in mating tests with a normal sexually receptive female or with a sexually receptive female that had been treated perivaginally with citral immediately before testing. The males ejaculated readily when paired with citral-treated females but were slow to achieve ejaculation when paired with normal females. These findings implicate an infantile experience as a determinant of adult sexual behavior in a mammal."
https://openalex.org/W2022772892,"While assessing a potential role of adrenal glands in the production of the hitherto unidentified puberty-delaying pheromone of female mice, the urinary volatile profiles of normal and adrenalectomized animals were quantitatively compared. Six components, whose concentrations were depressed after adrenalectomy, were identified: 2-heptanone, trans-5-hepten-2-one, trans-4-hepten-2-one, n-pentyl acetate, cis-2-penten-1-yl acetate, and 2,5-dimethylpyrazine. When these laboratory-synthesized chemicals were added (in their natural concentrations) to either previously inactive urine from adrenalectomized females or plain water, the biological activity was fully restored."

https://openalex.org/W2064774465,"Plasmids containing Z-DNA stretches can be paired and linked by combined action of Ustilago rec1 protein and topoisomerase. The product formed is a hemicatenated dimer in which two DNA rings are topologically intertwined at a region of homology. Superhelicity governs the reaction. Formation of linked product is coupled with formation of Z-DNA in the plasmid, a process dependent on the superhelix density. Pairing appears to initiate within the Z-DNA sequence, not at the unwound B-Z junction. The reaction can be blocked by a Z-DNA-specific binding protein, namely Z-DNA antibody. Plasmids with alternating Z-DNA dG-dC sequences at different sites on otherwise homologous molecules can be linked at the dG-dC sequences. However, a plasmid with a (dG-dC)n.(dG-dC)n Z-DNA stretch cannot be linked with a plasmid containing a (dG-dT)n.(dC-dA)n Z-DNA stretch."
https://openalex.org/W2031397333,"Hemoparasitic diseases are endemic in half the world's livestock production areas and are the greatest obstacle to improved meat, milk, and fiber production in the Third World. The most prevalent of these diseases, anaplasmosis, occurs throughout tropical and subtropical regions and is responsible for 50,000 to 100,000 cattle deaths annually in the United States alone. Despite its prevalence and the severity of the losses, an effective immunoprophylaxis for anaplasmosis has not been developed. A neutralization-sensitive epitope on a surface protein with a molecular weight of 105,000 (Am 105) of the causative rickettsia Anaplasma marginale was identified by monoclonal antibody inhibition of infectivity. This epitope was determined to be common to eight isolates with antigenic, morphologic, and protein structural differences. Cattle immunized with Am 105 purified by immunoaffinity chromatography were protected against challenge with virulent Anaplasma marginale. The identification of Am 105 as bearing isolate-common epitopes capable of inducing protection in immunized cattle provides the basis for the development of an effective subunit vaccine for bovine anaplasmosis."
https://openalex.org/W1971672674,"Cat X retinal ganglion cells that can resolve sine gratings of only 2.5 cycles per degree can nevertheless respond reliably to displacements of a grating of approximately 1 minute of arc. This is a form of hyperacuity comparable in magnitude to that seen in human vision. A theoretical analysis of this form of hyperacuity reveals it to be a result of the high gain and low noise of ganglion cells. The hyperacuity expected for the best retinal ganglion cells is substantially better than that observed in behavioral experiments. Thus the brain, rather than improving on the retinal signal-to-noise ratio by pooling signals from many ganglion cells, is unable to make use of all the hyperacuity information present in single ganglion cell responses."
https://openalex.org/W2154043329,"The praying mantis, thought to be deaf, possesses a sensitive and specialized acoustic sense. Neural recordings show that the auditory system responds primarily to ultrasound between 25 and 45 kilohertz with thresholds of 55 to 60 decibels. Other insects with auditory tympana possess paired, laterally placed ears; the mantis has only a single ear that is located in the ventral midline between the metathoracic legs. Some species of mantis abruptly and dramatically alter their flight path when stimulated with ultrasonic pulses, suggesting a behavioral response to insectivorous echo-locating bats."
https://openalex.org/W1552939162,"Liver microsomal flavin-containing monooxygenase (MFMO) has been shown to exhibit a stable 4a-flavin hydroperoxide intermediate in the absence of oxygenatable substrate (Poulsen, L. L., and Ziegler, D. M. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 6449-6455; Beaty, N. B., and Ballou, D. P. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 4619-4625). The reaction of this intermediate with an assortment of substrates was studied by stopped flow techniques. The first observed spectral change is a small blue shift in the absorbance peak of the 4a-flavin intermediate. The rate of this spectral change is dependent on the concentration of the substrate. This small spectral change is succeeded by a large increase in the absorbance at 450 nm. The rate of appearance of oxidized flavin is independent of substrate concentration but does increase at higher pH. Steady state turnover rates also greater at higher pH, consistent with earlier observations that the formation of oxidized flavin is rate determining in catalysis. Upon oxygenation by MFMO, thiobenzamide and iodide each undergo a spectral change which is dependent on substrate concentration. The spectral changes corresponding to oxygenation of these substrates occur at the same rates as do the initial small spectral changes contributed by the flavin chromophore as observed with all substrates. However, no substrate tested to date shows any effect on the rate of formation of oxidized flavin. Previous work has shown MFMO to catalyze the oxygenation of a variety of nitrogen- and sulfur-containing hydrophobic compounds. Two new classes of compounds are shown here to be substrates for this enzyme. The nucleophilic anions, iodide and thiocyanate, catalyze the decomposition of the 4a-flavin hydroperoxide. Organic boronic acids (e.g. phenylboronic acid and butylboronic acid) also appear to be oxygenated with no striking differences in kinetic characteristics from those of nucleophilic substrates. These organic boronic acids are classic electrophiles and suggest that like peracids, the 4a-flavin hydroperoxide is capable of oxygenating both nucleophiles and electrophiles (Lee, J. B., and Uff, B. C. (1967) Quart. Rev. 21, 429-457)."

On the basis of this assay system, L-isoleucine and L-leucine were suspected of being possible tumor promoters. Results of 40- to 60-week carcinogenesis experiments in which N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine was used as an initiator demonstrate that L-isoleucine and L-leucine promote bladder cancer in rats. This finding may be relevant to the high incidence of human bladder cancer in Western countries, where the diet is rich in protein."
https://openalex.org/W2005245249,"The vocal organ, or syrinx, of oscine birds has two parts, each of which has generally been presumed to operate independently of the other. A significant counter-example is now demonstrated in the production of a common vocalization by the black-capped chickadee (Parus atricapillus), in which the two acoustic sources interact in a nonlinear fashion. This bird produces a sound with multiple frequency components that are heterodyne products resulting from cross-modulation between two signals, thus providing evidence that avian phonation can involve cooperative coupling between the two syringeal sources."
https://openalex.org/W2079753450,"A monoclonal antibody (Epi 1) has been produced that recognizes an antigen expressed in epidermal cells of Xenopus laevis embryos. The Epi 1 antigen appears in embryonic epidermis at the end of gastrulation and is not expressed in nonepidermal structures derived from ectoderm (for example, neural tube or cement gland). The capacity to express the Epi 1 antigen is restricted to cells of the animal hemisphere prior to the midblastula stage of development (stage 8), and tissue interactions during gastrulation inhibit the expression of the Epi 1 antigen in neural ectoderm. This epidermal antigen will be a valuable marker for studies of ectodermal commitment."

https://openalex.org/W1572956878,"Abstract Adrenal chromaffin granules must shuttle reducing equivalents from the cytosol inward to reduce ascorbic acid oxidized during norepinephrine biosynthesis by intragranular dopamine-beta-hydroxylase. A transmembrane electron shuttle between the external (cytosolic) and intragranular ascorbate pools was demonstrated in vitro in intact bovine chromaffin granules undergoing tyramine- or dopamine-stimulated dopamine-beta-hydroxylase turnover. Incubation of intact chromaffin granules with tyramine results in a time-dependent decrease in reduced intragranular ascorbate and production of octopamine. The rate of ascorbate oxidation is a function of the extragranular concentrations of tyramine over the range 50 microM to 2 mM and is 95% inhibited by addition of the dopamine-beta-hydroxylase inhibitor disulfiram. The stoichiometry of octopamine synthesized/ascorbate oxidized closely approximates unity. The presence of extragranular dopamine also induces oxidation of intragranular ascorbate which is inhibited by blocking dopamine transport with reserpine. On the other hand, incubation with octopamine, which is also transported by the granules, causes no net decrease in reduced intragranular ascorbate. The presence of 400 microM extragranular ascorbate abolishes the observed tyramine-induced intragranular ascorbate oxidation. The addition of ascorbate extragranularly 30 min after addition of tyramine reverses the oxidation of intragranular ascorbate. The measurement of [14C]ascorbate distribution ratios in granule pellets and supernatants indicates that there is no transmembrane transport of ascorbate. Extravesicular NADH had no significant effect on matrix ascorbate levels during beta-hydroxylation. These data provide new in vitro evidence that chromaffin granules shuttle reducing equivalents inwardly from an extra- to an intravesicular ascorbate pool and that cytosolic ascorbate is the source of the intragranular reducing equivalents required during norepinephrine biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1515091337,"The role of the liver in the catabolism of high density lipoproteins (HDL) was examined in isolated perfused rabbit livers. Using 125I-labeled rabbit HDL the disappearance of labeled apolipoproteins from the perfusate was biphasic with 7% of the label removed after 20 min and a further 6% between 20 and 90 min. In contrast, with HDL labeled with [3H]cholesteryl esters 35% of label had been removed after 90 min. The effect of liver perfusion on HDL size and composition was further studied by recirculating rabbit HDL for 120 min. In control experiments HDL was incubated at 37 degrees C for 120 min with nonperfused media and with media that had been liver perfused. The added HDL was predominantly particles of 4.8-4.9-mm radius, and incubation with nonperfused and preperfused media produced no significant change in size. However, liver perfusion resulted in particles predominantly 4.2-4.3-mm radius. Hepatic perfusion also significantly reduced HDL cholesteryl ester composition as a percentage of lipoproteins mass from 13.3 +/- 2.2% in control incubations to 10.7 +/- 3.1% (p less than 0.001), and cholesteryl ester:protein mass ratio was reduced from 0.31 +/- 0.06 in control to 0.24 +/- 0.10 (p less than 0.001) after 120 min of liver perfusion. Thus interaction of rabbit HDL with rabbit liver results in smaller HDL particles significantly depleted of core cholesteryl esters."
https://openalex.org/W2013825596,Symmetry plays a key role in simplifying the control of legged robots and in giving them the ability to run and balance. The symmetries studied describe motion of the body and legs in terms of even and odd functions of time. A legged system running with these symmetries travels with a fixed forward speed and a stable upright posture. The symmetries used for controlling legged robots may help in elucidating the legged behavior of animals. Measurements of running in the cat and human show that the feet and body sometimes move as predicted by the even and odd symmetry functions.
https://openalex.org/W1571679969,"Small angle neutron scattering has been used to study the dimensions of G-actin and the formation of low molecular weight actin oligomers under conditions where rapid polymerization does not take place. In the presence of 200 microM Ca2+, actin in solution consists of a single component with a radius of gyration (Rg) of 19.9 +/- 0.4 A, consistent with the known molecular dimensions of the G-actin molecule. In the presence of 50 microM Mg2+, however, formation of an actin species with a larger Rg occurs over a 4-h period. Multicomponent fits were tried and the data were best fit assuming two components, the monomer and a species with an Rg of 29 +/- 1 A. This latter value is consistent with the dimensions expected for certain actin dimers. The apparent dissociation constant for dimer formation is approximately 150 microM with forward and reverse rate constants of 6.0 X 10(-7) microM-1 s-1 and 8.8 X 10(-5) s-1, respectively. Kinetic fluorescence experiments show that the dimer formed in the presence of low levels of Mg2+ is a nonproductive complex which does not participate in the polymerization process. However, the addition of cytochalasin D to actin in the presence of 50 microM Mg2+ rapidly induces the formation of dimers, presumably related to cytochalasin's ability to nucleate actin polymerization."
https://openalex.org/W1580661757,"One way in which serum promotes survival of primary cultured hepatocytes is by inhibiting plasma membrane protease (Nakamura, T., Asami, O., Tanaka, K., and Ichihara, A. (1984) Exp. Cell Res. 155, 81-91). One of these proteases was solubilized from the plasma membranes of rat liver with 4% octyl glucoside and purified to a homogeneous state by affinity chromatography on bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor linked to Sepharose 4B. The protease had an apparent Mr = 120,000 by Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration and the Mr of its subunits was 30,000, as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. It appeared to be a glycoprotein. A high concentration of detergent was necessary to keep the protein soluble. The purified enzyme readily hydrolyzed synthetic tripeptide nitroanilides at sites adjacent to Arg or Lys residues, but did not degrade synthetic substrates of chymotrypsin, elastase, or aminopeptidase. It showed endopeptidase activity, hydrolyzing various proteins such as casein, hemoglobin, and denatured albumin. The enzyme was strongly inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, leupeptin, antipain, and alpha 1-antitrypsin, but not by chymostatin, elastatinal, or inhibitors of carboxyl, thiol, or metallo proteases, suggesting that it is a seryl trypsin-like protease. This protease was found in plasma membranes of rat and mouse liver and in small amounts in those of kidney, but not in those of brain, red cells, Ehrlich ascites tumor, or two Morris hepatomas, suggesting that it may be involved in differentiated functions of normal hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2045313236,"A simple system was developed for obtaining x-ray diffraction patterns from magnetically oriented solutions of macromolecular assemblies. A small permanent magnet was designed that produces a magnetic field of 16 kilogauss in a volume of 1 cubic millimeter and is mountable on most x-ray cameras. Many subcellular structures have sufficient diamagnetic anisotropy that they exhibit orientation in dilute solution when placed between the poles of the magnet. Diffraction from solutions oriented in this magnet can provide substantially more structural information than small-angle scattering from isotropic solutions. In favorable cases, such as dilute solutions of filamentous bacteriophages, it is possible to produce oriented fiber diffraction patterns from which intensities along layer lines can be measured to 7-angstrom resolution. The magnetically induced birefringence observed in solutions of other macromolecular assemblies suggests that this technique may have broad applicability to subcellular structures."
https://openalex.org/W2047242573,"Hemocyanins, high molecular weight oxygen-binding proteins, were identified in two species of protobranch bivalve mollusks, Acila castrensis and Yoldia limatula. Although hemocyanins have been reported in chitons, gastropods, and cephalopods, they have not been observed in the Class Bivalvia. In A. castrensis the dissociation products of hemocyanin, characterized by gel electrophoresis, had a subunit molecular weight of approximately 250K. Negatively stained preparations of extracted hemocyanin formed protein aggregates in the shape of cylinders measuring 35 by 38 nanometers. X-ray microanalysis of hemocyanin aggregates in thin sections of Y. limatula demonstrated the presence of copper in the molecules. The discovery of hemocyanin in the protobranchs reinforces the primitive nature of the taxon and is further evidence that the major molluscan classes have a common ancestry."

https://openalex.org/W1505081213,"7-Dehydrocholesterol 5,6 beta-oxide covalently modifies and inactivates the rat liver microsomal enzyme cholesterol oxide hydrolase. The covalent modification is presumed to occur at the active site of the enzyme since 5,6 alpha-iminocholestanol, a potent competitive inhibitor of the enzyme, blocks incorporation of 3-[3H]-7-dehydrocholesterol 5,6 beta-oxide into the protein. Kinetics of the inactivation were measured both by following the loss of catalytic activity and by monitoring incorporation of 3-[3H]-7-dehydrocholesterol 5,6 beta-oxide into microsomal protein. Both the loss of catalytic activity and the incorporation of label followed first order kinetics. Linear plots of the reciprocal of the pseudo-first order rate constants for the loss of catalytic activity and for the incorporation of radioactivity versus reciprocal of inhibitor concentrations indicated saturation kinetics. The kinetic parameter kinac is found to be (2.83 +/- 0.43)10(-3) s-1 measured either by incorporation of tritium (300 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 2.4 mg of microsomal protein/ml at 37 degrees C) or by the loss of catalytic activity (300 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 0.99 mg of microsomal protein/ml at 37 degrees C). Unlike xenobiotic microsomal epoxide hydrolase (EC 3.3.2.3) which is not inactivated or inhibited by 7-dehydrocholesterol 5,6 beta-oxide, cholesterol oxide hydrolase appears to hydrolyze cholesterol oxides via a positively charged transition state."
https://openalex.org/W1584559936,"Porcine heart citrate synthase, a dimeric protein of Mr = 100,000 composed of two identical subunits, is shown to undergo a monomer-dimer equilibrium. The extent of dimerization is found to be dependent on the concentration of citrate synthase, pH, ionic strength, and the specific buffer system employed. Oxaloacetate and citrate, substrates for the forward and reverse reaction catalyzed by citrate synthase, affect dimerization at concentrations of the protein which exists as monomer in their absence. The dissociation of citrate synthase dimers has been demonstrated utilizing the techniques of gel permeation chromatography, fluorescence polarization, fluorescence energy transfer, and heat denaturation. Earlier studies of citrate synthase quarternary structure found the protein to be nondissociable except under denaturing conditions or extensive modification; however, most former studies were performed at relatively high protein concentration, ionic strength, and pH, conditions which stabilize the dimer. In light of recent evidence derived from x-ray crystallographic studies showing amino acid residues from one subunit contributing to the citrate and CoA binding sites of the other, the dissociation into monomers would be expected to have profound effects on citrate synthase activity and regulation, as well as overall tricarboxylic acid cycle activity."
https://openalex.org/W1619053649,"An aryl azide derivative of glucosamine, N-(4-iodoazidosalicyl)-2-amido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranose (GlcNAs), was synthesized as a potential photoaffinity label for the facilitative hexose carrier. The derivative inhibited hexose uptake into intact human erythrocytes half-maximally at 3.5 mM and was itself slowly transported into cells. However, photolysis of iodinated GlcNAs with leaky erythrocyte ghosts produced appreciable labeling on gel electrophoresis only of Band 6, which is glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Band 6 photolabeling in leaky ghosts by GlcNAs was: saturable, due mostly to the aryl azide moiety, inhibited by agents with known affinity for the enzyme including sulfhydryl reagents and the enzyme substrate glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, and not inhibited by the free-radical scavenger p-aminobenzoic acid. Moreover, GlcNAs also inhibited erythrocyte glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity in a dose-dependent fashion in the dark and more potently following irradiation. In resealed ghosts, Band 6 labeling was decreased by D-glucose, reflecting inhibition of carrier-mediated uptake of the agent. GlcNAs appears to be a specific photoaffinity label for erythrocyte glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and therefore potentially useful for studies of enzyme activity, compartmentation, or membrane association."
https://openalex.org/W1506483318,"Abstract The binding of the bisubstrate ligand N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate (PALA) to the active sites of both the free catalytic subunit of aspartate transcarbamoylase and the intact holoenzyme causes conformational changes which have been studied extensively. However, no kinetic information has been available about the sequence of events occurring during the formation or dissociation of the complexes. Stopped flow kinetics, 31P saturation transfer NMR spectroscopy, and presteady-state kinetics were used to monitor the interaction of PALA with the catalytic subunit (or a derivative containing nitrotyrosyl chromophores which served as spectral probes). The various experimental approaches lead to a mechanism that includes a rapid binding of PALA with an on rate of about 10(8)M-1s-1 and an off rate of 28 s-1, followed by a much slower isomerization of the complex with a forward rate constant of 0.18 s-1. Analysis of the presteady-state bursts of enzyme activity when the protein is added to a mixture of substrates and PALA and of the lag in activity when the PALA complex with catalytic subunit is added to substrates yielded a rate constant for the reverse isomerization of 0.018s-1. Thus, the conformational change subsequent to PALA binding leads to a 10-fold increase in the equilibrium constant for complex formation. Stopped flow kinetic measurements of the spectral change resulting from mixing the complex of PALA and nitrated protein with native enzyme showed a slow process with a t1/2 of about 11 s, whereas 31P saturation transfer NMR experiments yielded at t1/2 of about 260 ms for the dissociation of PALA from the complex. This apparent disparity is understood in terms of the two-step binding scheme where rapid dissociation of the initial ligand X enzyme complex is measured by the NMR technique and the slow isomerization of the complex is responsible for the bulk of the stopped flow signal."

S., and Kasper, C. B. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 259-266). This endogenous phosphorylation system was solubilized with Triton X-100 and fractionated by chromatography with DEAE-cellulose and Sepharose 4B. The resulting preparation lacked both ATPase and inorganic pyrophosphatase activity, but retained its original character: the first phase occurred in the presence of ATP but the second phase was initiated after its depletion, implying the presence of a phosphodonor other than ATP. The putative phosphoryl donors were demonstrated to be ATP in the first phase and in the second phase tripolyphosphate, which is present in [gamma-32P]ATP preparations as a radioactive impurity. The latter conclusion was corroborated by results showing that tripolyphosphate purified from a commercial [gamma-32P]ATP and chemically synthesized [32P] tripolyphosphate were both capable of phosphorylating the two proteins and that the unlabeled tripolyphosphate competed effectively against the phosphodonor. A rapid dephosphorylation was observed in both phases upon removal of substrates during the reaction, indicating that there is a continuous turnover of the phosphoryl groups being transferred to the proteins. The second phase of phosphorylation maintained by the tripolyphosphate was shown to be reversibly inhibited by micromolar levels of ATP, ADP, and nonhydrolyzable analogues of these compounds. The implications of this unique phosphorylation system are discussed."
