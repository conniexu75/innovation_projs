https://openalex.org/W4310439055,"Clonal haematopoiesis involves the expansion of certain blood cell lineages and has been associated with ageing and adverse health outcomes1–5. Here we use exome sequence data on 628,388 individuals to identify 40,208 carriers of clonal haematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). Using genome-wide and exome-wide association analyses, we identify 24 loci (21 of which are novel) where germline genetic variation influences predisposition to CHIP, including missense variants in the lymphocytic antigen coding gene LY75, which are associated with reduced incidence of CHIP. We also identify novel rare variant associations with clonal haematopoiesis and telomere length. Analysis of 5,041 health traits from the UK Biobank (UKB) found relationships between CHIP and severe COVID-19 outcomes, cardiovascular disease, haematologic traits, malignancy, smoking, obesity, infection and all-cause mortality. Longitudinal and Mendelian randomization analyses revealed that CHIP is associated with solid cancers, including non-melanoma skin cancer and lung cancer, and that CHIP linked to DNMT3A is associated with the subsequent development of myeloid but not lymphoid leukaemias. Additionally, contrary to previous findings from the initial 50,000 UKB exomes6, our results in the full sample do not support a role for IL-6 inhibition in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease among CHIP carriers. Our findings demonstrate that CHIP represents a complex set of heterogeneous phenotypes with shared and unique germline genetic causes and varied clinical implications. Exome sequence data from 628,388 individuals was used to identify 24 risk loci in 40,208 carriers of clonal haematopoiesis of indeterminate potential and link them to other conditions including COVID-19, cardiovascular disease and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4310483850,"The precise mechanisms that lead to cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease are unknown. Here we identify amyloid-plaque-associated axonal spheroids as prominent contributors to neural network dysfunction. Using intravital calcium and voltage imaging, we show that a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease demonstrates severe disruption in long-range axonal connectivity. This disruption is caused by action-potential conduction blockades due to enlarging spheroids acting as electric current sinks in a size-dependent manner. Spheroid growth was associated with an age-dependent accumulation of large endolysosomal vesicles and was mechanistically linked with Pld3-a potential Alzheimer's-disease-associated risk gene1 that encodes a lysosomal protein2,3 that is highly enriched in axonal spheroids. Neuronal overexpression of Pld3 led to endolysosomal vesicle accumulation and spheroid enlargement, which worsened axonal conduction blockades. By contrast, Pld3 deletion reduced endolysosomal vesicle and spheroid size, leading to improved electrical conduction and neural network function. Thus, targeted modulation of endolysosomal biogenesis in neurons could potentially reverse axonal spheroid-induced neural circuit abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease, independent of amyloid removal."

https://openalex.org/W4310439030,"Fanconi anaemia (FA), a model syndrome of genome instability, is caused by a deficiency in DNA interstrand crosslink repair resulting in chromosome breakage1-3. The FA repair pathway protects against endogenous and exogenous carcinogenic aldehydes4-7. Individuals with FA are hundreds to thousands fold more likely to develop head and neck (HNSCC), oesophageal and anogenital squamous cell carcinomas8 (SCCs). Molecular studies of SCCs from individuals with FA (FA SCCs) are limited, and it is unclear how FA SCCs relate to sporadic HNSCCs primarily driven by tobacco and alcohol exposure or infection with human papillomavirus9 (HPV). Here, by sequencing genomes and exomes of FA SCCs, we demonstrate that the primary genomic signature of FA repair deficiency is the presence of high numbers of structural variants. Structural variants are enriched for small deletions, unbalanced translocations and fold-back inversions, and are often connected, thereby forming complex rearrangements. They arise in the context of TP53 loss, but not in the context of HPV infection, and lead to somatic copy-number alterations of HNSCC driver genes. We further show that FA pathway deficiency may lead to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and enhanced keratinocyte-intrinsic inflammatory signalling, which would contribute to the aggressive nature of FA SCCs. We propose that the genomic instability in sporadic HPV-negative HNSCC may arise as a result of the FA repair pathway being overwhelmed by DNA interstrand crosslink damage caused by alcohol and tobacco-derived aldehydes, making FA SCC a powerful model to study tumorigenesis resulting from DNA-crosslinking damage."
https://openalex.org/W4310483820,"In neural networks that store information in their connection weights, there is a tradeoff between sensitivity and stability1,2. Connections must be plastic to incorporate new information, but if they are too plastic, stored information can be corrupted. A potential solution is to allow plasticity only during epochs when task-specific information is rich, on the basis of a 'when-to-learn' signal3. We reasoned that dopamine provides a when-to-learn signal that allows the brain's spatial maps to update when new spatial information is available-that is, when an animal is moving. Here we show that the dopamine neurons innervating the Drosophila head direction network are specifically active when the fly turns to change its head direction. Moreover, their activity scales with moment-to-moment fluctuations in rotational speed. Pairing dopamine release with a visual cue persistently strengthens the cue's influence on head direction cells. Conversely, inhibiting these dopamine neurons decreases the influence of the cue. This mechanism should accelerate learning during moments when orienting movements are providing a rich stream of head direction information, allowing learning rates to be low at other times to protect stored information. Our results show how spatial learning in the brain can be compressed into discrete epochs in which high learning rates are matched to high rates of information intake."

https://openalex.org/W4310438141,"Insect societies are tightly integrated, complex biological systems in which group-level properties arise from the interactions between individuals1-4. However, these interactions have not been studied systematically and therefore remain incompletely known. Here, using a reverse engineering approach, we reveal that unlike solitary insects, ant pupae extrude a secretion derived from the moulting fluid that is rich in nutrients, hormones and neuroactive substances. This secretion elicits parental care behaviour and is rapidly removed and consumed by the adults. This behaviour is crucial for pupal survival; if the secretion is not removed, pupae develop fungal infections and die. Analogous to mammalian milk, the secretion is also an important source of early larval nutrition, and young larvae exhibit stunted growth and decreased survival without access to the fluid. We show that this derived social function of the moulting fluid generalizes across the ants. This secretion thus forms the basis of a central and hitherto overlooked interaction network in ant societies, and constitutes a rare example of how a conserved developmental process can be co-opted to provide the mechanistic basis of social interactions. These results implicate moulting fluids in having a major role in the evolution of ant eusociality."
https://openalex.org/W4310438911,"Salt marshes provide ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration1, coastal protection2, sea-level-rise (SLR) adaptation3 and recreation4. SLR5, storm events6, drainage7 and mangrove encroachment8 are known drivers of salt marsh loss. However, the global magnitude and location of changes in salt marsh extent remains uncertain. Here we conduct a global and systematic change analysis of Landsat satellite imagery from the years 2000-2019 to quantify the loss, gain and recovery of salt marsh ecosystems and then estimate the impact of these changes on blue carbon stocks. We show a net salt marsh loss globally, equivalent to an area double the size of Singapore (719 km2), with a loss rate of 0.28% year-1 from 2000 to 2019. Net global losses resulted in 16.3 (0.4-33.2, 90% confidence interval) Tg CO2e year-1 emissions from 2000 to 2019 and a 0.045 (-0.14-0.115) Tg CO2e year-1 reduction of carbon burial. Russia and the USA accounted for 64% of salt marsh losses, driven by hurricanes and coastal erosion. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of salt marsh systems to climatic changes such as SLR and intensification of storms and cyclones."
https://openalex.org/W4310960000,"Abstract In humans, traumatic social experiences can contribute to psychiatric disorders 1 . It is suggested that social trauma impairs brain reward function such that social behaviour is no longer rewarding, leading to severe social avoidance 2,3 . In rodents, the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) model has been used to understand the neurobiology underlying stress susceptibility versus resilience following social trauma, yet little is known regarding its impact on social reward 4,5 . Here we show that, following CSDS, a subset of male and female mice, termed susceptible (SUS), avoid social interaction with non-aggressive, same-sex juvenile C57BL/6J mice and do not develop context-dependent social reward following encounters with them. Non-social stressors have no effect on social reward in either sex. Next, using whole-brain Fos mapping, in vivo Ca 2+ imaging and whole-cell recordings, we identified a population of stress/threat-responsive lateral septum neurotensin (NT LS ) neurons that are activated by juvenile social interactions only in SUS mice, but not in resilient or unstressed control mice. Optogenetic or chemogenetic manipulation of NT LS neurons and their downstream connections modulates social interaction and social reward. Together, these data suggest that previously rewarding social targets are possibly perceived as social threats in SUS mice, resulting from hyperactive NT LS neurons that occlude social reward processing."
https://openalex.org/W4310438556,"Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are bursts of electromagnetic energy that are released when supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies violently disrupt a star that passes too close1. TDEs provide a window through which to study accretion onto supermassive black holes; in some rare cases, this accretion leads to launching of a relativistic jet2–9, but the necessary conditions are not fully understood. The best-studied jetted TDE so far is Swift J1644+57, which was discovered in γ-rays, but was too obscured by dust to be seen at optical wavelengths. Here we report the optical detection of AT2022cmc, a rapidly fading source at cosmological distance (redshift z = 1.19325) the unique light curve of which transitioned into a luminous plateau within days. Observations of a bright counterpart at other wavelengths, including X-ray, submillimetre and radio, supports the interpretation of AT2022cmc as a jetted TDE containing a synchrotron ‘afterglow’, probably launched by a supermassive black hole with spin greater than approximately 0.3. Using four years of Zwicky Transient Facility10 survey data, we calculate a rate of $$0.0{2}_{-0.01}^{+0.04}$$ Gpc−3 yr−1 for on-axis jetted TDEs on the basis of the luminous, fast-fading red component, thus providing a measurement complementary to the rates derived from X-ray and radio observations11. Correcting for the beaming angle effects, this rate confirms that approximately 1 per cent of TDEs have relativistic jets. Optical surveys can use AT2022cmc as a prototype to unveil a population of jetted TDEs. A series of early-time, multiwavelength observations of an optical transient, AT2022cmc, indicate that it is a relativistic jet from a tidal disruption event originating from a supermassive black hole."
https://openalex.org/W4310439034,"Squamous cell carcinomas are triggered by marked elevation of RAS-MAPK signalling and progression from benign papilloma to invasive malignancy1-4. At tumour-stromal interfaces, a subset of tumour-initiating progenitors, the cancer stem cells, obtain increased resistance to chemotherapy and immunotherapy along this pathway5,6. The distribution and changes in cancer stem cells during progression from a benign state to invasive squamous cell carcinoma remain unclear. Here we show in mice that, after oncogenic RAS activation, cancer stem cells rewire their gene expression program and trigger self-propelling, aberrant signalling crosstalk with their tissue microenvironment that drives their malignant progression. The non-genetic, dynamic cascade of intercellular exchanges involves downstream pathways that are often mutated in advanced metastatic squamous cell carcinomas with high mutational burden7. Coupling our clonal skin HRASG12V mouse model with single-cell transcriptomics, chromatin landscaping, lentiviral reporters and lineage tracing, we show that aberrant crosstalk between cancer stem cells and their microenvironment triggers angiogenesis and TGFβ signalling, creating conditions that are conducive for hijacking leptin and leptin receptor signalling, which in turn launches downstream phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT-mTOR signalling during the benign-to-malignant transition. By functionally examining each step in this pathway, we reveal how dynamic temporal crosstalk with the microenvironment orchestrated by the stem cells profoundly fuels this path to malignancy. These insights suggest broad implications for cancer therapeutics."

https://openalex.org/W4311069998,"Attachment is an innate human relational mechanism that develops progressively from early childhood, influences individuals' representations and behaviors, shapes relationships, and affects the social and cultural environment. Parental bonding refers to the ability of parents to be emotionally and behaviorally available to the child during infancy. Attachment style refers to the individual's relational attitude in close relationships that influences adult love, bonding, handling relationships, and social exploration. The role of intergenerational, cultural and developmental factors influencing the relationship between the attachment style in adulthood and the parental bonding style recalled during childhood has been debated. This study explores the relationships between recalled parental bonding, adult attachment style, and cultural background in a sample of Spanish, Italian, and Japanese adults using a cross-sectional and cross-cultural design. For this purpose, the validated versions of the Experience in Close Relationship Scale and the Parental Bonding Instrument were administered to a non-clinical population of three hundred and five participants in the three countries. Results show that the most frequent adult attachment style is the secure style, followed by the dismissing-avoidant, the preoccupied, and the fearful-avoidant style. The dismissing-avoidant style was the most frequent insecure attachment style in the Japanese sample whereas the preoccupied style was the most frequent insecure attachment style in the Italians and Spaniards. Japanese are more anchored to the memory of maternal and paternal overprotection, which is related to more avoidance in actual close relationships. Spaniard's current relationships are mildly independent of recalled parental bonding, showing an association between lower current avoidance to primary parental care. In the Italian sample, there is no significant relationship between current adult close relationships and recalled parental bonding. These results suggest that different cultural models influence adult attachment representations differently, in terms of the weight placed on attachment-related avoidance, attachment-related anxiety, care, and overprotection in infant and adult relationships."
https://openalex.org/W4310507041,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M . tb ) causes tuberculosis (TB) and remains one of the leading causes of mortality due to an infectious pathogen. Host immune responses have been implicated in driving the progression from infection to severe lung disease. We analyzed longitudinal RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data from the whole blood of 74 TB progressors whose samples were grouped into four six-month intervals preceding diagnosis (the GC6-74 study). We additionally analyzed RNAseq data from an independent cohort of 90 TB patients with positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan results which were used to categorize them into groups with high and low levels of lung damage (the Catalysis TB Biomarker study). These groups were compared to non-TB controls to obtain a complete whole blood transcriptional profile for individuals spanning from early stages of M . tb infection to TB diagnosis. The results revealed a steady increase in the number of genes that were differentially expressed in progressors at time points closer to diagnosis with 278 genes at 13–18 months, 742 at 7–12 months and 5,131 detected 1–6 months before diagnosis and 9,205 detected in TB patients. A total of 2,144 differentially expressed genes were detected when comparing TB patients with high and low levels of lung damage. There was a large overlap in the genes upregulated in progressors 1–6 months before diagnosis (86%) with those in TB patients. A comprehensive pathway analysis revealed a potent activation of neutrophil and platelet mediated defenses including neutrophil and platelet degranulation, and NET formation at both time points. These pathways were also enriched in TB patients with high levels of lung damage compared to those with low. These findings suggest that neutrophils and platelets play a critical role in TB pathogenesis, and provide details of the timing of specific effector mechanisms that may contribute to TB lung pathology."
https://openalex.org/W4310937670,"Abstract Shallow cumulus clouds in the trade-wind regions cool the planet by reflecting solar radiation. The response of trade cumulus clouds to climate change is a key uncertainty in climate projections 1–4 . Trade cumulus feedbacks in climate models are governed by changes in cloud fraction near cloud base 5,6 , with high-climate-sensitivity models suggesting a strong decrease in cloud-base cloudiness owing to increased lower-tropospheric mixing 5–7 . Here we show that new observations from the EUREC 4 A (Elucidating the role of cloud-circulation coupling in climate) field campaign 8,9 refute this mixing-desiccation hypothesis. We find the dynamical increase of cloudiness through mixing to overwhelm the thermodynamic control through humidity. Because mesoscale motions and the entrainment rate contribute equally to variability in mixing but have opposing effects on humidity, mixing does not desiccate clouds. The magnitude, variability and coupling of mixing and cloudiness differ markedly among climate models and with the EUREC 4 A observations. Models with large trade cumulus feedbacks tend to exaggerate the dependence of cloudiness on relative humidity as opposed to mixing and also exaggerate variability in cloudiness. Our observational analyses render models with large positive feedbacks implausible and both support and explain at the process scale a weak trade cumulus feedback. Our findings thus refute an important line of evidence for a high climate sensitivity 10,11 ."
https://openalex.org/W4311069599,"In an era of climate change, impacts on the marine environment include warming and ocean acidification. These effects can be amplified in shallow coastal regions where conditions often fluctuate widely. This type of environmental variation is potentially important for many nearshore species that are broadcast spawners, releasing eggs and sperm into the water column for fertilization. We conducted two experiments to investigate: 1) the impact of water temperature on sperm swimming characteristics and fertilization rate in sand dollars (Dendraster excentricus; temperatures 8-38°C) and sea urchins (Mesocentrotus franciscanus; temperatures 8-28°C) and; 2) the combined effects of multiple stressors (water temperature and pH) on these traits in sand dollars. We quantify thermal performance curves showing that sand dollar fertilization rates, sperm swimming velocities, and sperm motility display remarkably wide thermal breadths relative to red urchins, perhaps reflecting the wider range of water temperatures experienced by sand dollars at our field sites. For sand dollars, both temperature (8, 16, 24°C) and pH (7.1, 7.5, 7.9) affected fertilization but only temperature influenced sperm swimming velocity and motility. Although sperm velocities and fertilization were positively correlated, our fertilization kinetics model dramatically overestimated measured rates and this discrepancy was most pronounced under extreme temperature and pH conditions. Our results suggest that environmental stressors like temperature and pH likely impair aspects of the reproductive process beyond simple sperm swimming behavior."
https://openalex.org/W4311069749,"Behavior change applications often assign their users activities such as tracking the number of smoked cigarettes or planning a running route. To help a user complete these activities, an application can persuade them in many ways. For example, it may help the user create a plan or mention the experience of peers. Intuitively, the application should thereby pick the message that is most likely to be motivating. In the simplest case, this could be the message that has been most effective in the past. However, one could consider several other elements in an algorithm to choose a message. Possible elements include the user’s current state (e.g., self-efficacy), the user’s future state after reading a message, and the user’s similarity to the users on which data has been gathered. To test the added value of subsequently incorporating these elements into an algorithm that selects persuasive messages, we conducted an experiment in which more than 500 people in four conditions interacted with a text-based virtual coach. The experiment consisted of five sessions, in each of which participants were suggested a preparatory activity for quitting smoking or increasing physical activity together with a persuasive message. Our findings suggest that adding more elements to the algorithm is effective, especially in later sessions and for people who thought the activities were useful. Moreover, while we found some support for transferring knowledge between the two activity types, there was rather low agreement between the optimal policies computed separately for the two activity types. This suggests limited policy generalizability between activities for quitting smoking and those for increasing physical activity. We see our results as supporting the idea of constructing more complex persuasion algorithms. Our dataset on 2,366 persuasive messages sent to 671 people is published together with this article for researchers to build on our algorithm."
https://openalex.org/W4311071006,"The sound of the pig is one of its important signs, which can reflect various states such as hunger, pain or emotional state, and directly indicates the growth and health status of the pig. Existing speech recognition methods usually start with spectral features. The use of spectrograms to achieve classification of different speech sounds, while working well, may not be the best approach for solving such tasks with single-dimensional feature input. Based on the above assumptions, in order to more accurately grasp the situation of pigs and take timely measures to ensure the health status of pigs, this paper proposes a pig sound classification method based on the dual role of signal spectrum and speech. Spectrograms can visualize information about the characteristics of the sound under different time periods. The audio data are introduced, and the spectrogram features of the model input as well as the audio time-domain features are complemented with each other and passed into a pre-designed parallel network structure. The network model with the best results and the classifier were selected for combination. An accuracy of 93.39% was achieved on the pig speech classification task, while the AUC also reached 0.99163, demonstrating the superiority of the method. This study contributes to the direction of computer vision and acoustics by recognizing the sound of pigs. In addition, a total of 4,000 pig sound datasets in four categories are established in this paper to provide a research basis for later research scholars."

https://openalex.org/W4311069484,"The suspension system determines riding comfort. This item utilizes an active suspension system to absorb vehicle vibration. A quarter-dynamics model with five state variables simulates the oscillations of a vehicle. This model incorporates the hydraulic actuator effect into linear differential equations. This is an entirely original design. In addition, the OSMC (Optimal Sliding Mode Control) algorithm is proposed for active suspension system operation control. The in-loop algorithm optimizes the controller’s parameters. According to the findings of the study, when the OSMC algorithm was implemented, the maximum and average displacement values of the sprung mass were dramatically lowered under normal oscillation conditions. If a vehicle employs only a passive suspension system or an active suspension system with a standard linear control algorithm, the wheel is fully detached from the road surface in hazardous conditions. When the OSMC algorithm is utilized to control the operation of the active suspension system, the wheel-to-road interaction is always maintained. This algorithm provides a great degree of efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W4310506794,"Background While Covid-19 monoclonal antibody therapies (Mab) have been available in the outpatient setting for over a year and a half, little is known about the impact of emerging variants and vaccinations on the effectiveness of Mab therapies. We sought to determine the effectiveness of Covid-19 Mab therapies during the first two waves of the pandemic in Los Angeles County and assess the impact of vaccines, variants, and other confounding factors. Methods and findings We retrospectively examined records for 2209 patients of with confirmed positive molecular SARS-CoV2 test either referred for outpatient Mab therapy or receiving Mab treatment in the emergency department (ED) between December 2020 and 2021. Our primary outcome was the combined 30-day incidence of ED visit, hospitalization, or death following the date of referral. Additionally, SARS-CoV2 isolates of hospitalized patients receiving Mabs were sequenced. The primary outcome was significantly reduced with combination therapy compared to bamlanivimab or no treatment (aHR 0·60; 95% CI ·37, ·99), with greater benefit in unvaccinated, moderate-to-high-risk patients (aHR ·39; 95% CI ·20, ·77). Significant associations with the primary outcome included history of lung disease (HR 7·13; 95% CI 5·12, 9·95), immunocompromised state (HR 6·59; 95% CI 2·91–14·94), and high social vulnerability (HR 2·29, 95% CI 1·56–3·36). Two predominant variants were noted during the period of observation: the Epsilon variant and the Delta variant. Conclusions Only select monoclonal antibody therapies significantly reduced ED visits, hospitalizations, and death due to COVID-19 during. Vaccination diminished effectiveness of Mabs. Variant data and vaccination status should be considered when assessing the benefit of novel COVID-19 treatments."
https://openalex.org/W4310506800,"Objective To relate preevacuation platelet count and leukogram findings, especially neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios (NLR) and platelet/lymphocyte ratios with the occurrence of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) after complete hydatidiform mole (CHM) among Brazilian women. Methods Retrospective cohort study of patients with CHM followed at Rio de Janeiro Federal University, from January/2015-December/2020. Before molar evacuation, all patients underwent a medical evaluation, complete blood count and hCG measurement, in addition to other routine preoperative tests. The primary outcome was the occurrence of postmolar GTN. Results From 827 cases of CHM treated initially at the Reference Center, 696 (84.15%) had spontaneous remission and 131 (15.85%) developed postmolar GTN. Using optimal cut-offs from receiver operating characteristic curves and multivariable logistic regression adjusted for the possible confounding variables of age and preevacuation hCG level (already known to be associated with the development of GTN) we found that ≥2 medical complications at presentation (aOR: 1.96, CI 95%: 1.29–2.98, p&lt;0.001) and preevacuation hCG ≥100,000 IU/L (aOR: 2.16, CI 95%: 1.32–3.52, p&lt;0.001) were significantly associated with postmolar GTN after CHM. However, no blood count profile findings were able to predict progression from CHM to GTN. Conclusion Although blood count is a widely available test, being a low-cost test and mandatory before molar evacuation, and prognostic for outcome in other neoplasms, its findings were not able to predict the occurrence of GTN after CHM. In contrast, the occurrence of medical complications at presentation and higher preevacuation hCG levels were significantly associated with postmolar GTN and may be useful to guide individualized clinical decisions in post-molar follow-up and treatment of these patients."
https://openalex.org/W4311069443,"Phosphodiesterase 1B (PDE1B) and PDE10A are dual-specificity PDEs that hydrolyse both cyclic adenosine monophosphate and cyclic guanosine monophosphate, and are highly expressed in the striatum. Several reports have suggested that PDE10A inhibitors may present a promising approach for the treatment of positive symptoms of schizophrenia, whereas PDE1B inhibitors may present a novel mechanism to modulate cognitive deficits. Previously, we have reported a novel dual inhibitor of PDE1B and PDE10A, compound 2 [(3-fluorophenyl)(2-methyl-2,3-dihydro-4H-benzo[b][1,4]oxazin-4-yl)methanone] which has shown inhibitory activity for human recombinant PDE1B and PDE10A in vitro . In the present study, the safety profile of compound 2 has been evaluated in rats in the acute oral toxicity study, as well as; the antipsychotic-like effects in the rat model of schizophrenia. Compound 2 was tolerated up to 1 g/kg when administered at a single oral dose. Additionally, compound 2 has strongly suppressed ketamine-induced hyperlocomotion, which presented a model for the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. It has also shown an ability to attenuate social isolation induced by chronic administration of ketamine and enhanced recognition memory of rats ​in the novel object recognition test. Altogether, our results suggest that compound 2 represents a promising therapy for the treatment of the three symptomatic domains of schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W4311069458,"Mental disorders often emerge during adolescence and have been associated with age-related differences in connection strengths of brain networks (static functional connectivity), manifesting in non-typical trajectories of brain development. However, little is known about the direction of information flow (directed functional connectivity) in this period of functional brain progression. We employed dynamic graphical models (DGM) to estimate directed functional connectivity from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data on 1143 participants, aged 6 to 17 years from the healthy brain network (HBN) sample. We tested for effects of age, sex, cognitive abilities and psychopathology on estimates of direction flow. Across participants, we show a pattern of reciprocal information flow between visual-medial and visual-lateral connections, in line with findings in adults. Investigating directed connectivity patterns between networks, we observed a positive association for age and direction flow from the cerebellar to the auditory network, and for the auditory to the sensorimotor network. Further, higher cognitive abilities were linked to lower information flow from the visual occipital to the default mode network. Additionally, examining the degree networks overall send and receive information to each other, we identified age-related effects implicating the right frontoparietal and sensorimotor network. However, we did not find any associations with psychopathology. Our results suggest that the directed functional connectivity of large-scale resting-state brain networks is sensitive to age and cognition during adolescence, warranting further studies that may explore directed relationships at rest and trajectories in more fine-grained network parcellations and in different populations."
https://openalex.org/W4311069544,"The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a global health crisis that has posed enormous pressure on workers in the health sector (WHS), having a massive impact on their mental health. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the sleep quality of WHS during the pandemic and compare frontline WHS to those who are not directly engaged in the care of COVID-19 patients. This cross-sectional, self-reported online survey assessed the sleep quality of WHS in Austria using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The same questionnaire was sent out two times. Due to the unequal sample and anonymity of the study participants, we analyzed the data of each time point separate from each other. The first study was conducted in April/May 2020, during the first lockdown in Austria (Study1), and the second study was conducted in July/August 2020, when the social restrictions were loosened (Study2). T-test was used to compare the mean values of PSQI scores between frontline vs. non-frontline WHS, while two two-way ANCOVAs were used to analyze differences in the PSQI mean scores (controlled for age) for male vs. female between frontline vs. non-frontline WHS. During the first lockdown in Austria (Study1) we identified a shorter sleep duration of frontline WHS compared to the non-frontline group, however the difference in global PSQI score between these groups was statistically not significant. In the period after loosened restrictions (Study2) the sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency and global PSQI score was worse in frontline WHS compared to the non-frontline WHS. Furthermore, female WHS scored higher in the PSQI indicating a worse sleep than male WHS. In addition, nurses and nursing assistants had a higher prevalence of poor sleep quality than other occupational groups. Our results indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacts the sleep of WHS, affecting particularly frontline WHS. Preventive interventions aiming to promote good sleep quality in WHS during a healthcare crisis like this pandemic are essential to enhance resilience and mitigate the vulnerability of this specific population."

Information on related attitudes and behaviors are needed to inform public health strategies. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19, risk factors of infection, and related attitudes and behaviors in a racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse urban population.The DFW COVID-19 Prevalence Study Protocol 1 was conducted from July 2020 to March 2021 on a randomly selected sample of adults aged 18-89 years, living in Dallas or Tarrant Counties, Texas. Participants were asked to complete a 15-minute questionnaire and COVID-19 PCR and antibody testing. COVID-19 prevalence estimates were calculated with survey-weighted data.Of 2969 adults who completed the questionnaire (7.4% weighted response), 1772 (53.9% weighted) completed COVID-19 testing. Overall, 11.5% of adults had evidence of COVID-19 infection, with a higher prevalence among Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black persons, essential workers, those in low-income neighborhoods, and those with lower education attainment compared to their counterparts. We observed differences in attitudes and behaviors by race and ethnicity, with non-Hispanic White persons being less likely to believe in the importance of mask wearing, and racial and ethnic minorities more likely to attend social gatherings.Over 10% of an urban population was infected with COVID-19 early during the pandemic. Differences in attitudes and behaviors likely contribute to sociodemographic disparities in COVID-19 prevalence."
https://openalex.org/W4311069759,"Lynch syndrome is a heritable condition caused by a heterozygous germline inactivating mutation of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, most commonly the MLH1 gene. However, one third of the identified alterations are missense variants, for which the clinical significance is unclear in many cases. We have identified three MLH1 missense alterations (p.(Glu736Lys), p.(Pro640Thr) and p.(Leu73Pro)) in six individuals from large Tunisian families. For none of these alterations, a classification of pathogenicity was available, consequently diagnosis, predictive testing and targeted surveillance in affected families was impossible. We therefore performed functional laboratory testing using a system testing stability as well as catalytic activity that includes clinically validated reference variants. Both p.(Leu73Pro) and p.(Pro640Thr) were found to be non-functional due to severe defects in protein stability and catalytic activity. In contrast, p.(Glu736Lys) was comparable to the wildtype protein and therefore considered a neutral substitution. Analysis of residue conservation and of the structural roles of the substituted residues corroborated these findings. In conjunction with the available clinical data, two variants fulfil classification criteria for class 4 “likely pathogenic”. The findings of this work clarify the mechanism of pathogenicity of two unclear MLH1 variants and enables predictive testing and targeted surveillance in members of carrier families worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W4311069763,"Next basket recommendation is a critical task in market basket data analysis. It is particularly important in grocery shopping, where grocery lists are an essential part of shopping habits of many customers. In this work, we first present a new grocery Recommender System available on the MyGroceryTour platform. Our online system uses different traditional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, and provides recommendations to users in a real-time manner. It aims to help Canadian customers create their personalized intelligent weekly grocery lists based on their individual purchase histories, weekly specials offered in local stores, and product cost and availability information. We perform clustering analysis to partition given customer profiles into four non-overlapping clusters according to their grocery shopping habits. Then, we conduct computational experiments to compare several traditional ML algorithms and our new DL algorithm based on the use of a gated recurrent unit (GRU)-based recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture. Our DL algorithm can be viewed as an extension of DREAM (Dynamic REcurrent bAsket Model) adapted to multi-class (i.e. multi-store) classification, since a given user can purchase recommended products in different grocery stores in which these products are available. Among traditional ML algorithms, the highest average F-score of 0.516 for the considered data set of 831 customers was obtained using Random Forest, whereas our proposed DL algorithm yielded the average F-score of 0.559 for this data set. The main advantage of the presented Recommender System is that our intelligent recommendation is personalized, since a separate traditional ML or DL model is built for each customer considered. Such a personalized approach allows us to outperform the prediction results provided by general state-of-the-art DL models."
https://openalex.org/W4311069823,"Given the increased use of air cleaners as a prevention measure in classrooms during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study aimed to investigate the effects of portable air cleaners with HEPA filters and window A/C fans on real-time (1 minute) concentrations of PM less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5) or less than 1 microns (PM1.0) in two classrooms in a non-urban elementary school in Rhode Island. For half of each school day, settings were randomized to ""high"" or ""low"" for the air cleaner and ""on"" or ""off"" for the fan. Descriptive statistics and linear mixed models were used to evaluate the impacts of each set of conditions on PM2.5 and PM1.0 concentrations. The mean half-day concentrations ranged from 3.4-4.1 μg/m3 for PM2.5 and 3.4-3.9 μg/m3 for PM1.0. On average, use of the fan when the air cleaner was on the low setting decreased PM2.5 by 0.53 μg/m3 [95% CI: -0.64, -0.42] and use of the filter on high (compared to low) when the fan was off decreased PM2.5 by 0.10 μg/m3 [95% CI: -0.20, 0.005]. For PM1.0, use of the fan when the air cleaner was on low decreased concentrations by 0.18 μg/m3 [95% CI: -0.36, -0.01] and use of the filter on high (compared to low) when the fan was off decreased concentrations by 0.38 μg/m3 [95% CI: -0.55, -0.21]. In general, simultaneous use of the fan and filter on high did not result in additional decreases in PM concentrations compared to the simple addition of each appliance's individual effect estimates. Our study suggests that concurrent or separate use of an A/C fan and air cleaner in non-urban classrooms with low background PM may reduce classroom PM concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W4311069873,"Physical activity and body mass index (BMI) have been reported to change around retirement. The objective was to examine the concurrent changes in physical activity and BMI around retirement, which have not been studied before. In addition, the associations of different demographic characteristics with these changes were examined.The prospective cohort study consisted of 3,351 participants in the ongoing Finnish Retirement and Ageing Study (FIREA). Repeated postal survey, including questions on physical activity and body weight and height, was conducted once a year up to five times before and after the retirement transition, the mean follow-up time being 3.6 years (SD 0.7). Group-based multi-trajectory modeling was used to identify several clusters with dissimilar concurrent changes in physical activity and BMI within the studied cohort.Of the participants, 83% were women. The mean age at the last wave before retirement was 63.3 (SD 1.4) years. Four clusters with different trajectories of physical activity and BMI were identified. BMI remained stable around retirement transition in all four clusters, varying from normal weight to class II obesity. The association of BMI trajectories with physical activity levels were inverse, however, each activity trajectory showed a temporary increase during the retirement transition.Retirement seems to have more effect on physical activity than BMI, showing a temporary increase in physical activity at the time of retirement."
https://openalex.org/W4311070377,"The shared and micro-mobility industry (ride sharing and hailing, carpooling, bike and e-scooter shares) saw direct and almost immediate impacts from COVID-19 restrictions, orders and recommendations from local governments and authorities. However, the severity of that impact differed greatly depending on variables such as different government guidelines, operating policies, system resiliency, geography and user profiles. This study investigated the impacts of the pandemic regarding bike-share travel behavior in Montgomery County, VA. We used bike-usage dataset covering two small towns in Montgomery county, namely: Blacksburg and Christiansburg, including Virginia Tech campus. The dataset used covers the period of Jan 2019-Dec 2021 with more than 14,555 trips and 5,154 active users. Findings indicated that a bikeshare user's average trip distance and duration increased in 2020 (compared to 2019) from 2+ miles to 4+ and from half an hour to about an hour. While there was a slight drop in 2021, bikeshare users continued to travel farther distances and spend more time on the bikes than pre-COVID trips. When those averages were unpacked to compare weekday trips to weekend trips, a few interesting trip patterns were observed. Unsurprisingly, more trips still took place on the weekends (increasing from 2x as many trips to 4x as many trips than the weekday). These findings could help to better understand traveler's choices and behavior when encountering future pandemics."
https://openalex.org/W4311070940,"This study evaluated factors that influence the cost-effectiveness of talazoparib, particularly for patients with a germline breast-cancer-gene-(brca)-mutation and locally advanced or metastasized breast cancer within the context of the German healthcare system. We constructed a partitioned survival model to compare medical costs and treatment effectiveness for patients with such cancers over 45 months. Transition probabilities were derived from survival data from a randomized Phase-III EMBRACA trial, utilities based on published reports, and costs in Euros, which included costs for drug acquisition, clinical monitoring, and treatment of adverse events. Willingness-to-pay thresholds were set to be multiples of the current German per capita gross domestic product. Treatment with talazoparib led to a gain of 0.32 life-years (0.22 quality-adjusted life-years). The mean total cost of €84,003 for talazoparib and €12,741 for standard therapy resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €223,246 per life-year and €323,932 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, indicating that talazoparib is unlikely to be cost-effective at current pricing."
https://openalex.org/W4311070993,"Information about the direct comparability of big data of epidemiological cohort studies and the general population still is lacking, especially regarding all-cause mortality rates. The aim of this study was to investigate the overall survival and the influence of several diagnoses in the medical history on survival time, adjusted to common risk factors in a populations-based cohort.From 10,000 subjects of the population-based cohort LIFE-Adult-Study (Leipzig Research Centre for Civilization Diseases), the medical history and typical risk factors such as age, smoking status and body-mass-index (BMI) were assessed. The survival status was identified from the saxonian population register. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine the influence of the medical history and risk factors on overall survival. To develope an optimal model, the method by Collet [1] was used.The mortality rate of the participants is approximately half the mortality rate expected for the german population. The selection bias in epidemiological studies needs to be considered whenever interpreting results of epidemiological cohort studies. Nevertheless we have shown that several diagnoses proved to have a negative influence on overall survival time even in this relatively healthy cohort. This study showed the significantly increased mortality risk if the following diseases are reported in medical history of the participants in a large population-based cohort study including adults aged 18 and over: diabetes mellitus (HR 1.533, p = 0.002), hypertension (HR 1.447, p = 0.005), liver cirrhosis (HR 4.251, p < 0.001), osteoporosis (HR 2.165, p = 0.011), chronic bronchitis (HR 2.179, p < 0.001), peptic ulcer disease (HR 1.531, p = 0.024) and cancer (HR 1.797, p < 0.001). Surprisingly, asthma has the opposite effect on survival time (HR 0.574, p = 0.024), but we believe this may be due to an overrepresentation of mild to moderate asthma and its management, which includes educating patients about a healthy lifestyle.In the LIFE-Adult-Study, common risk factors and several diseases had relevant effect on overall survival. However, selection bias in epidemiological studies needs to be considered whenever interpreting results of epidemiological cohort studies. Nevertheless it was shown that the general cause-and-effect principles also apply in this relatively healthy cohort."
https://openalex.org/W4311070998,"The green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer) is a generalist pest of various host plants, whose feeding preference and growth performance mainly depends on the quantity and quality of nutrients and defensive metabolites in host plants. Here, we studied the preference and performance of M . persicae on three major Brassicaceae vegetables in China and measured nutrient (amino acids) and defensive metabolites (glucosinolates) in these plants. We found that M . persicae preferred and performed better on Chinese cabbage than cabbage and radish, which may be due to the relatively higher concentration of amino acids and lower levels of indole glucosinolates in their leaves. The glucosinolates level in cabbage leaves was ten times higher than the other two plants, while the amino acid concentration in radish was only half of the cabbage or Chinese cabbage. The higher concentration of indole glucosinolates in cabbage and lower levels of amino acids in radish may account for the poorer preference and growth of M . persicae on these two plants. These results suggest that both amino acids and glucosinolates in plants may play important roles in the preference and performance of M . persicae , which provide new knowledge for the cultivation and breeding of Brassicaceae vegetables."

https://openalex.org/W4310437831,"Abstract The relatively stable Holocene climate was preceded by a pronounced event of abrupt warming in the Northern Hemisphere, the termination of the Younger Dryas (YD) cold period 1,2 . Although this transition has been intensively studied, its imprint on low-latitude ocean temperature is still controversial and its effects on sub-annual to decadal climate variability remain poorly understood 1,3,4 . Sea surface temperature (SST) variability at these timescales in the tropical Atlantic is expected to intensify under current and future global warming and has considerable consequences for environmental conditions in Africa and South America, and for tropical Pacific climate 5–8 . Here we present a 100-µm-resolution record obtained by mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) of long-chain alkenones in sediments from the Cariaco Basin 9–11 and find that annually averaged SST remained stable during the transition into the Holocene. However, seasonality increased more than twofold and approached modern values of 1.6 °C, probably driven by the position and/or annual range of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). We further observe that interannual variability intensified during the early Holocene. Our results demonstrate that sub-decadal-scale SST variability in the tropical Atlantic is sensitive to abrupt changes in climate background, such as those witnessed during the most recent glacial to interglacial transition."
https://openalex.org/W4310506823,"Background The paper established indexes of coordination efficiency, the theoretical framework and operation mechanism of emergency information sharing for coastal cities of China. Method First of all, we analyzed the operational relationship between the participants of emergency information sharing and information transmission, and based on the collaborative theory, constructed the emergency information sharing framework and operational mechanism suitable for the actual disaster prevention and reduction of coastal cities. Around the 3 dimensions of emergency information sharing mechanism construction, resource guarantee ability and collaborative driving force of emergency information sharing, the paper proposed the evaluation index system and the evaluation method. Results The empirical results showed that the efficiency of emergency information sharing in coastal cities in China was generally low, and the contribution rate of the construction level of emergency information sharing mechanism is higher than that of the resource guarantee ability and the collaborative driving force of emergency information sharing, but the efficiency of emergency information sharing in coastal cities in China was still at the bottom level. Conclusion The research results provided theoretical basis and methods for the emergency management departments of coastal cities in China."
https://openalex.org/W4310506839,"Objectives The expression/activation of IL-6, p-Stat3, PD-1 and PD-L1 in gastric cancer (GC) tissues were examined to evaluate their abilities in predicting the survival prognosis in postoperative patients with GC. Methods The clinicopathological data and paraffin-embedded tissues of 205 patients who underwent gastric cancer resection were collected at the First Affiliated Hospital of Shihezi University School of Medicine, and the patients were followed-up annually after surgery. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect the expression of IL-6, p-Stat3, PD-1 and PD-L1 proteins using tissue microarrays derived from these patients. Statistical analyses were performed using non-parametric tests, Spearman’s correlation, ROC curves, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox single-factor and multifactor regression models. In comparison, the analyses were also performed for GC patients from public databases (407 patients from TCGA and 433 patients from GEO, respectively). Results (1) The expression levels of IL-6, p-Stat3, PD-1 and PD-L1 in GC tissues were significantly higher than adjacent normal tissues (ANT) (81.01% vs. 52.78%, P &lt;0.001; 100% vs. 93.41%, P &lt;0.001; 58.58% vs. 40.12%, P &lt;0.001; 38.20% vs. 26.90%, P = 0.025, respectively). The mean optical density (MOD) values of IL-6, p-Stat3, PD-1 and PD-L1 were significantly higher in GC tissues. (2) The higher the levels of IL-6 ( P &lt;0.001), p-Stat3 ( P &lt;0.001), and PD-L1 ( P = 0.003) were, the worse the survival prognoses were observed, respectively, among GC patients. The expression of PD-1 was not correlated with the prognosis of GC patients ( P &gt;0.05). The lower the degree of cell differentiation ( P &lt;0.001) was, the worse the survival prognoses were observed among GC patients. (3) Independent risk factors for postoperative prognosis in GC patients included age (≥60 years old), poor cell differentiation, invasion depth (T3/T4), lymph node metastasis (N1-3), distant metastasis (M1), and high levels of IL-6 (2+/3+). (4) A multi-factor combination (cell differentiation+IL-6+p-Stat3+PD-1+PD-L1) appeared to be the best survival predictor for GC patients as indicated by AUC (AUC 0.782, 95% CI = 0.709, 0.856, P &lt;0.001). This combination may be the optimal predictor for postoperative survival of GC patients. (5) The levels of IL-6, p-Stat3, PD-1 and PD-L1 correlated with the infiltration levels of various tumor-infiltrating immune cells. (6) The analyses of ROC curves, calibration, DCA and Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves in TCGA dataset confirmed that the nomogram model could accurately predict the prognosis in GC patients. Conclusions (1) The expressed levels of IL-6, p-Stat3, PD-1 and PD-L1 are higher in GC tissues than in adjacent normal tissues. (2) The high levels of IL-6, p-Stat3 and PD-L1 are correlated with poor survival in GC patients. (3) The high levels of IL-6, p-Stat3, PD-1 and PD-L1 have influences in GC tumor microenvironment. (4) The multi-predictor combination of ""IL-6+p-Stat3+PD-1+cell differentiation"" serves as an optimal survival predictor for postoperative GC patients and better than the TNM staging system. As these molecules can be examined in preoperative biopsies, these observations may provide a useful guide for clinicians to strategize individualized surgical plans for GC patients before surgery."
https://openalex.org/W4310530568,"The mechanism underlying allostery in hemoglobin (Hb) is still not completely understood. Various models describing the action of allosteric effectors on Hb function have been published in the literature. It has also been reported that some allosteric effectors-such as chloride ions, inositol hexaphosphate, 2,3-diphospho-glycerate and bezafibrate-considerably lower the oxygen affinity of Hb. In this context, an important question is the extent to which these changes influence the conformational dynamics of the protein. Earlier, we elaborated a challenging method based on phosphorescence quenching, which makes characterizing protein-internal dynamics possible in the ms time range. The experimental technique involves phosphorescence lifetime measurements in thermal equilibrium at varied temperatures from 10 K up to 273 K, based on the signal of Zn-protoporphyrin substituted for the heme in the β-subunits of Hb. The thermal activation of protein dynamics was observed by the enhancement of phosphorescence quenching attributed to O2 diffusion. It was shown that the thermal activation of protein matrix dynamics was clearly distinguishable from the dynamic activation of the aqueous solvent, and was therefore highly specific for the protein. In the present work, the same method was used to study the changes in the parameters of the dynamic activation of human HbA induced by binding allosteric effectors. We interpreted the phenomenon as phase transition between two states. The fitting of this model to lifetime data yielded the change of energy and entropy in the activation process and the quenching rate in the dynamically activated state. The fitted parameters were particularly sensitive to the presence of allosteric effectors and could be interpreted in line with results from earlier experimental studies. The results suggest that allosteric effectors are tightly coupled to the dynamics of the whole protein, and thus underline the importance of global dynamics in the regulation of Hb function."

https://openalex.org/W4311069408,"Purpose E-cigarettes are the most common type of electronic nicotine delivery system in the United States. E-cigarettes contain numerous toxic compounds that has been shown to induce severe structural damage to the airways. The objective of this study is to assess if there is an association between e-cigarette use and respiratory symptoms in adults in the US as reported in the BRFSS. Methods We analyzed data from 18,079 adults, 18–44 years, who participated at the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) in the year 2017. E-cigarette smoking status was categorized as current everyday user, current some days user, former smoker, and never smoker. The frequency of any respiratory symptoms (cough, phlegm, or shortness of breath) was compared. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression analysis were used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results The BRFSS reported prevalence of smoking e-cigarettes was 6%. About 28% of the participants reported any of the respiratory symptoms assessed. The frequency of reported respiratory symptoms was highest among current some days e-cigarette users (45%). After adjusting for selected participant’s demographic, socio-economic, and behavioral characteristics, and asthma and COPD status, the odds of reporting respiratory symptoms increased by 49% among those who use e-cigarettes some days (OR 1.49; 95% CI: 1.06–2.11), and by 29% among those who were former users (OR 1.29; 95% CI: 1.07–1.55) compared with those who never used e-cigarettes. No statistically significant association was found for those who used e-cigarettes every day (OR 1.41; 95% CI 0.96–2.08). Conclusion E-cigarettes cannot be considered as a safe alternative to aid quitting use of combustible traditional cigarettes. Cohort studies may shed more evidence on the association between e-cigarette use and respiratory diseases."

https://openalex.org/W4311069453,"Using genomics, bioinformatics and statistics, herein we demonstrate the effect of statewide and nationwide quarantine on the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) in Hawai'i. To define the origins of introduced VOC, we analyzed 260 VOC sequences from Hawai'i, and 301,646 VOC sequences worldwide, deposited in the GenBank and global initiative on sharing all influenza data (GISAID), and constructed phylogenetic trees. The trees define the most recent common ancestor as the origin. Further, the multiple sequence alignment used to generate the phylogenetic trees identified the consensus single nucleotide polymorphisms in the VOC genomes. These consensus sequences allow for VOC comparison and identification of mutations of interest in relation to viral immune evasion and host immune activation. Of note is the P71L substitution within the E protein, the protein sensed by TLR2 to produce cytokines, found in the B.1.351 VOC may diminish the efficacy of some vaccines. Based on the phylogenetic trees, the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.427, and B.1.429 VOC have been introduced in Hawai'i multiple times since December 2020 from several definable geographic regions. From the first worldwide report of VOC in GenBank and GISAID, to the first arrival of VOC in Hawai'i, averages 320 days with quarantine, and 132 days without quarantine. As such, the effect of quarantine is shown to significantly affect the time to arrival of VOC in Hawai'i. Further, the collective 2020 quarantine of 43-states in the United States demonstrates a profound impact in delaying the arrival of VOC in states that did not practice quarantine, such as Utah. Our data demonstrates that at least 76% of all definable SARS-CoV-2 VOC have entered Hawai'i from California, with the B.1.351 variant in Hawai'i originating exclusively from the United Kingdom. These data provide a foundation for policy-makers and public-health officials to apply precision public health genomics to real-world policies such as mandatory screening and quarantine."

https://openalex.org/W4311069521,"Online fundraisers often showcase information about the number of donations received and the proximity to the campaign goal. This practice follows research on descriptive norms and goal-directed motivation, which predicts higher contributions as the number of donors increases and as the campaign goal is approached. However, across three studies, we demonstrate that when the campaign is close to completion, individuals give more when they see that there are few (vs. many) donors to the campaign. We observe this result across real campaigns on a fundraising website and obtain causal evidence for this effect in two laboratory experiments. We find that this effect is driven in part by an increase in the perceived progress that one's donation makes towards reaching the campaign goal. This work identifies a counterintuitive consequence of norm-based marketing appeals and has important implications for fundraisers."

Particularly critical among them is the process of keeping the membrane of cells in a fluid phase to prevent metabolic dysfunction. In this paper, we examine variation in the fatty acid composition of bone marrow and muscle tissues in the cold-adapted caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) to determine whether there are systematic differences in fatty acid profiles between anatomical regions that could potentially be explained by thermal adaptation as influenced by cell function, including hematopoiesis. Our results indicate that the bone marrow and muscle tissues from the appendicular skeleton are more unsaturated than the same tissues in the axial skeleton, a finding that is consistent with physiological adaptation of the appendicular regions to thermal challenges. Because mechanisms of thermal adaptation appear to be widely shared among terrestrial mammals, we suggest that the same patterns may prevail in other species, possibly including humans."

The pilot zones promote green finance development and explore the propagable and reproducible experiences regarding mechanisms and institutions. Adopting a sample of China's listed companies from 2012 to 2021, this paper constructed a quasi-natural experiment and investigated the GFRI policy's effect on firms' total factor productivity (TFP) using the difference-in-differences (DID) method to verify the implementation effect of the GFRI policy. Furthermore, heterogeneity analysis and mechanism analysis were conducted to identify the guidance effect and deep mechanisms of the GFRI policy. The empirical results demonstrated that firms' TFP in pilot zones increased substantially after implementing the GFRI pilot policy, confirming that the policy had a strong incentive effect. The corresponding promoting effect was particularly significant for non-state-owned companies, the eastern and central regions, and firms in the growth stage. Further mechanism analysis revealed that the GFRI pilot policy can stimulated firms' TFP by promoting technological innovation and improving resource allocation efficiency. This paper's empirical findings are essential in improving relevant policies and expanding the pilot zones."

(study sample 1,150,684). First, a multiple correspondence analysis was performed to aggregate information from the Population Information System of the Region of Valencia into an ISESI. Second, data from the 2016 Region of Valencia Health Survey were used for validation, and finally the relationship between CRCSP participation and the ISESI was analysed by logistic regression models.The variables included in the index were nationality, employment status, disability, healthcare coverage, risk of vulnerability and family size. The most important categories for determining the highest socioeconomic status were being employed and not being at risk of social vulnerability, and being unemployed and at risk of social vulnerability for determining the lowest socioeconomic status. Index validation demonstrated internal and external coherence for measuring socioeconomic status. The relationship between CRCSP participation and the ISESI categorised by quartile (Q) showed that Q4 (the lowest socioeconomic status) was less likely to participate OR = 0.769 (0.757-0.782) than Q1 (the highest socioeconomic status), and the opposite was found for Q2 OR = 1.368 (1.347-1.390) and Q3 OR = 1.156 (1.137-1.175).An ISESI was constructed and validated using Population Information System data and made it possible to evaluate inequalities in colorectal cancer screening."
https://openalex.org/W4311069982,"With the advent of Big Data technology and the Internet of Things, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become inevitable for future transportation networks. Travel time prediction (TTP) is an essential part of ITS and plays a pivotal role in congestion avoidance and route planning. The novel data sources such as smartphones and in-vehicle navigation applications allow traffic conditions in smart cities to be analyzed and forecast more reliably than ever. Such a massive amount of geospatial data provides a rich source of information for TTP. Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) has been successfully applied to traffic prediction problems due to its ability to handle long-term traffic sequences. However, the existing GRU does not consider the relationship between various historical travel time positions in the sequences for traffic prediction. We propose an attention-based GRU model for short-term travel time prediction to cope with this problem enabling GRU to learn the relevant context in historical travel time sequences and update the weights of hidden states accordingly. We evaluated the proposed model using FCD data from Beijing. To demonstrate the generalization of our proposed model, we performed a robustness analysis by adding noise obeying Gaussian distribution. The experimental results on test data indicated that our proposed model performed better than the existing deep learning time-series models in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Coefficient of Determination ( R 2 )."
