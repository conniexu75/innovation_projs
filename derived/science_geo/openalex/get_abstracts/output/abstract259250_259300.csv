https://openalex.org/W2076312647,"DNA methylation is a covalent chemical modification of DNA catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). DNA methylation is associated with transcriptional silencing and has been studied extensively as a lifelong molecular information storage mechanism put in place during development. Here we report that DNMT gene expression is upregulated in the adult rat hippocampus following contextual fear conditioning and that DNMT inhibition blocks memory formation. In addition, fear conditioning is associated with rapid methylation and transcriptional silencing of the memory suppressor gene PP1 and demethylation and transcriptional activation of the synaptic plasticity gene reelin, indicating both methyltransferase and demethylase activity during consolidation. DNMT inhibition prevents the PP1 methylation increase, resulting in aberrant transcription of the gene during the memory-consolidation period. These results demonstrate that DNA methylation is dynamically regulated in the adult nervous system and that this cellular mechanism is a crucial step in memory formation.

The learning and memory field has long recognized the importance of transcriptional regulation during memory formation. However, we have a relatively poor understanding of how this transcriptional regulation occurs. While a great deal of effort has focused on the role of transcription factors in synaptic plasticity and memory, a burgeoning field is discovering evidence implicating epigenetic mechanisms in the transcriptional regulation underlying long-term memory formation. Epigenetic mechanisms are essential to normal development, as they provide the cellular memory necessary for perpetuating the correct cellular phenotype during mitosis. The mechanisms that accomplish this are a set of posttranslational modifications of DNA and chromatin that alter gene expression patterns. Rapidly accumulating evidence suggests that the nervous system has co-opted these epigenetic mechanisms utilized during development for the generation of long-term behavioral memories in adulthood (Swank and Sweatt, 2001Swank M.W.

DNA is tightly packaged into a DNA-protein complex known as chromatin, and highly basic proteins known as histones are the major component. In chromatin's native state, transcription is repressed through tight binding of histones to DNA, preventing the requisite RNA polymerase II/DNA interaction (Varga-Weisz and Becker, 1998Varga-Weisz P.D. Becker P.B. Chromatin-remodeling factors: machines that regulate?.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, in order to initiate transcription, chromatin's tightly compacted structure must be disrupted. Acetylation of the ɛ-amino group of lysine residues by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) is one way of accomplishing this conformational change. This disrupts the histone-DNA interaction and facilitates binding of transcription factors and RNA polymerase II to DNA, resulting in increased initiation of transcription (Varga-Weisz and Becker, 1998Varga-Weisz P.D.

For example, several studies have implicated the HAT activity of CREB binding protein (CBP) in both long-term facilitation in Aplysia and the formation of long-term memory in rodents (Guan et al., 2002Guan Z.

Mem. 2005; 12: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has recently found that acetylation and phosphorylation of histone H3 are increased in vitro in the hippocampus following activation of NMDA receptors and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (Levenson et al., 2004aLevenson J.M. O'Riordan K.J. Brown K.D. Trinh M.A. Molfese D.L. Sweatt J.D. Regulation of histone acetylation during memory formation in the hippocampus.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40545-40559Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). In vivo, contextual fear conditioning is accompanied by similar increases in acetylation and phosphorylation of H3 within the hippocampus (Levenson et al., 2004aLevenson J.M. O'Riordan K.J. Brown K.D. Trinh M.A. Molfese D.L. Sweatt J.D. Regulation of histone acetylation during memory formation in the hippocampus.J. Biol.

ERK/MAPK regulates hippocampal histone phosphorylation following contextual fear conditioning.Learn. Mem. 2006; 13: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Moreover, artificially elevating levels of histone acetylation using histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors enhances induction of long-term potentiation in vitro and formation of long-term memory in vivo (Levenson et al., 2004aLevenson J.M. O'Riordan K.J. Brown K.D. Trinh M.A. Molfese D.L. Sweatt J.D. Regulation of histone acetylation during memory formation in the hippocampus.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40545-40559Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Thus, a model is emerging whereby hippocampus-dependent memory formation is initiated by activation of NMDA receptors, which leads to an influx of calcium, activation of signaling pathways, and altered gene transcription mediated in part by changes in chromatin structure. In the current study, we explored the potential role of another epigenetic mechanism, cytosine-5′ methylation, in memory formation. Many developmentally important processes utilize this “prima donna” of epigenetics (Scarano et al., 2005Scarano M.I. Strazzulo M. Matarazzo M.R. D'Esposito M.

Laudano A. Mattaliano R. Ingram V. Cloning and sequencing of a cDNA encoding DNA methyltransferase of mouse cells.

This covalent modification of DNA is catalyzed by DNA (cytosine-5′) methyltransferases (DNMTs) and involves the transfer of a methyl group to the 5′ position of cytosine residues, canonically at CG dinucleotides. Expression and activity of DNMTs is generally restricted to dividing cells and is very high during early development (Szyf et al., 1985Szyf M. Kaplan F. Mann V. Giloh H. Kedar E. Razin A.

DNA methylation can induce long-term transcriptional silencing through direct interference with transcription factor binding. In addition, methylated DNA can counter the transcriptional effects of histone acetylation by recruiting chromatin remodeling enzymes, including histone deacetylases (HDACs), via the action of methyl-CpG binding domain proteins (MBDs) like MeCP2 (Becker et al., 1987Becker P.B.

DNA methylation has been studied extensively in development and has long been considered a static process following cell differentiation, because typically DNMT expression greatly diminishes once terminal differentiation has occurred (Bestor et al., 1988Bestor T.

Because the mammalian brain primarily consists of postmitotic neurons and glial cells that possess relatively low proliferative potential, reports that the adult mammalian CNS possesses high levels of DNMT mRNA and enzymatic activity were unexpected (Monk et al., 1987Monk M.

However, recent studies have also implicated misregulation of DNA methylation and DNMTs in such cognitive disorders as schizophrenia, Rett syndrome, and Fragile X mental retardation (Veldic et al., 2004Veldic M.

DNA methylation represses FMR-1 transcription in fragile X syndrome.Hum. Mol. Genet. 1992; 1: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). To begin investigating a potential role for DNA methylation in the adult CNS, we examined a provocative possibility contrary to the prevailing model of an exclusive role for DNA methylation in development. Thus, we investigated whether DNA methylation regulates memory consolidation in the adult CNS via gene-specific control of transcription within the hippocampus. We recently characterized the effects of DNMT inhibition on hippocampal synaptic plasticity (Levenson et al., 2006Levenson J.M. Roth T.L. Lubin F.D. Miller C.A. Huang I. Desai P. Malone L.M. Sweatt J.D. Evidence that DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferase regulates synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15763-15773Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). We found that DNA of the gene reelin, which is involved in the induction of synaptic plasticity, exhibits rapid decreases in cytosine methylation when DNMT activity is blocked in acute hippocampal slices. We also found that DNMT inhibition prevents the induction of LTP. These findings suggested that DNA methylation might be dynamically regulated in the adult nervous system and serve as an additional epigenetic mechanism governing memory formation. To pursue this idea, we first investigated whether or not DNMT mRNA levels in the hippocampus are altered by contextual fear conditioning, a hippocampus-dependent associative memory paradigm. Using real-time quantitative PCR, we examined DNMT mRNA levels in the adult rat hippocampus 30 min after training for contextual fear conditioning. We assayed levels of three DNMT subtypes, DNMT 1, 3A, and 3B, as well as the immediate-early gene c-fos, which is rapidly induced in the hippocampus by fear conditioning (Melia et al., 1996Melia K.R. Ryabinin A.E. Corodimas K.P. Wilson M.C. Ledoux J.E.

Amygdala regulation of immediate-early gene expression in the hippocampus induced by contextual fear conditioning.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 1616-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Though there is some overlap in function, DNMT1 has preferential activity for hemimethylated DNA and is traditionally considered a maintenance methyltransferase in DNA replication, while 3A and 3B are responsible for de novo methylation (Siedlecki and Zielenkiewicz, 2006Siedlecki P. Zielenkiewicz P. Mammalian DNA methyltransferases.Acta Biochim. Pol. 2006; 53: 245-256PubMed Google Scholar). Animals exposed to the associative context-plus-shock training displayed an increase in DNMT3A and 3B mRNA in area CA1 relative to animals exposed only to the novel context of the fear conditioning chamber (DNMT3A: t7 = 2.88; DNMT3B: t7 = 4.56; c-fos: t7 = 2.81; p values < 0.05; Figure 1). These initial findings suggested the intriguing possibility that DNMT activity might be dynamically regulated in the adult CNS in vivo in response to environmental sensory stimulation. Because fear conditioning led to an upregulation of hippocampal DNMT mRNA, we next tested the necessity of DNMT activity for memory formation. For this experiment, we infused one of two distinct DNMT inhibitors, 5-aza-deoxycytidine (5-AZA) or zebularine (zeb), directly into area CA1 of the hippocampus immediately after contextual fear conditioning. Infusions were administered after training for this hippocampus-dependent task to avoid state-dependent effects of the drug. There were no differences in time spent freezing between the animals infused with 5-AZA and those infused with zeb during the retention tests (p > 0.05), nor were there any differences between their respective vehicle groups (0.8% acetate and 10% DMSO; p > 0.05). Therefore, the 5-AZA and zeb data were collapsed into one DNMT inhibitor group, as were the two vehicle groups. When memory was assessed 24 hr later (test day 1), animals infused with a DNMT inhibitor (5-AZA or zeb) displayed significantly less freezing than their vehicle-treated (VEH) counterparts (F(1,22) = 103.9; p < 0.001; Figure 2A), indicating that hippocampal DNMT activity is necessary for memory consolidation. DNA methylation is not generally considered to be a plastic process; in development, alterations in DNA methylation are essentially permanent. This consideration raised the question of whether or not the effects of DNMT inhibition on the capacity for memory formation are permanent. To address this, we assessed the ability of these same DNMT inhibitor-treated animals to form the fear memory later on, in the absence of the drug. For this experiment, animals treated with DNMT inhibitor or vehicle 24 hr earlier were retrained for contextual fear conditioning immediately after testing on test day 1. Twenty-four hours later, fear memory was again assessed (test day 2). The freezing behavior in vehicle-treated animals on test day 2 was significantly greater than their freezing during test 1 (p < 0.005) and lasted for nearly the entire test period (Figure 2A). This result was expected, as this test followed a second training trial for a task in which a single trial is sufficient to form a strong, long-lasting memory. Animals treated with DNMT inhibitor after the first training trial and subsequently retrained on test day 1 showed significantly greater freezing on test day 2 as compared to their performance on test day 1 (p < 0.005). This result establishes that the drug infusion did not damage the hippocampus. More importantly, it demonstrates that the effects of DNMT inhibition are not immuteable. Rather, the changes are plastic, allowing the DNA methylation states necessary for memory consolidation to be re-established after transient DNMT inhibition and DNA demethylation. Interestingly, test day 2 freezing in previously DNMT inhibitor-treated animals was equivalent to the freezing displayed by vehicle-treated animals on test day 1 and"
https://openalex.org/W2070413937,"Deregulation of intestinal immune responses seems to have a principal function in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. The gut epithelium is critically involved in the maintenance of intestinal immune homeostasis-acting as a physical barrier separating luminal bacteria and immune cells, and also expressing antimicrobial peptides. However, the molecular mechanisms that control this function of gut epithelial cells are poorly understood. Here we show that the transcription factor NF-kappaB, a master regulator of pro-inflammatory responses, functions in gut epithelial cells to control epithelial integrity and the interaction between the mucosal immune system and gut microflora. Intestinal epithelial-cell-specific inhibition of NF-kappaB through conditional ablation of NEMO (also called IkappaB kinase-gamma (IKKgamma)) or both IKK1 (IKKalpha) and IKK2 (IKKbeta)-IKK subunits essential for NF-kappaB activation-spontaneously caused severe chronic intestinal inflammation in mice. NF-kappaB deficiency led to apoptosis of colonic epithelial cells, impaired expression of antimicrobial peptides and translocation of bacteria into the mucosa. Concurrently, this epithelial defect triggered a chronic inflammatory response in the colon, initially dominated by innate immune cells but later also involving T lymphocytes. Deficiency of the gene encoding the adaptor protein MyD88 prevented the development of intestinal inflammation, demonstrating that Toll-like receptor activation by intestinal bacteria is essential for disease pathogenesis in this mouse model. Furthermore, NEMO deficiency sensitized epithelial cells to tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-induced apoptosis, whereas TNF receptor-1 inactivation inhibited intestinal inflammation, demonstrating that TNF receptor-1 signalling is crucial for disease induction. These findings demonstrate that a primary NF-kappaB signalling defect in intestinal epithelial cells disrupts immune homeostasis in the gastrointestinal tract, causing an inflammatory-bowel-disease-like phenotype. Our results identify NF-kappaB signalling in the gut epithelium as a critical regulator of epithelial integrity and intestinal immune homeostasis, and have important implications for understanding the mechanisms controlling the pathogenesis of human inflammatory bowel disease."

We examined brain network integrity in patients with neglect by measuring coherent fluctuations of fMRI signals (functional connectivity). Connectivity in two largely separate attention networks located in dorsal and ventral frontoparietal areas was assessed at both acute and chronic stages of recovery. Connectivity in the ventral network, part of which directly lesioned, was diffusely disrupted and showed no recovery. In the structurally intact dorsal network, interhemispheric connectivity in posterior parietal cortex was acutely disrupted but fully recovered. This acute disruption, and disrupted connectivity in specific pathways in the ventral network, strongly correlated with impaired attentional processing across subjects. Lastly, disconnection of the white matter tracts connecting frontal and parietal cortices was associated with more severe neglect and more disrupted functional connectivity. These findings support a network view in understanding neglect.

Functional connectivity (FC) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies temporal correlations between the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals in different brain regions. These temporal correlations are readily demonstrated in the resting state (i.e., in the absence of an explicit task; Biswal et al., 1995Biswal B. Yetkin F.Z. Haughton V.M. Hyde J.S.

One goal of the current study was to assess the behavioral significance of BOLD FC by measuring the relationship between FC and performance deficits in stroke patients longitudinally. The primary question was whether the degree of disruption in FC correlated with the severity of behavioral deficits at the acute stage and whether this correlation was maintained over the course of recovery. A second goal of this study was to gain insights into the role of coherent BOLD fluctuations in the pathophysiology of neglect. Neglect is a common syndrome following right hemisphere strokes that includes both a rightward bias in spatial sensory-motor processing as well as several nonlateralized deficits of arousal, attentional capacity, and working memory (for reviews see Heilman et al., 1985Heilman K.M.

Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam1987: 235-258Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar]). The present work fits within a more recent perspective that emphasizes the importance of distributed dysfunction in frontoparietal cortical networks (Corbetta et al., 2005Corbetta M. Kincade M.J. Lewis C. Snyder A.Z. Sapir A. Neural basis and recovery of spatial attention deficits in spatial neglect.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1603-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, Thiebaut de Schotten et al., 2005Thiebaut de Schotten M. Urbanski M. Duffau H. Volle E. Levy R. Dubois B. Bartolomeo P. Direct evidence for a parietal-frontal pathway subserving spatial awareness in humans.Science. 2005; 309: 2226-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). We have recently proposed that spatial neglect reflects dysfunction of two frontoparietal networks involved in the control of attention. The dorsal attention network controls the allocation of spatial attention to extrapersonal space and the selection of stimuli and responses predominantly in contralateral space and includes as core regions the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and the frontal eye field (FEF). The ventral attention network is necessary for target detection and reorienting toward salient unexpected events in either hemifield, is localized predominantly in the right hemisphere, and is centered around the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and ventral frontal cortex (VFC; for review see Corbetta and Shulman, 2002Corbetta M. Shulman G.L. Control of goal-directed and stimulus-driven attention in the brain.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 201-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (7748) Google Scholar). Strokes that cause neglect often structurally damage the ventral network while sparing the dorsal network (Corbetta et al., 2005Corbetta M. Kincade M.J. Lewis C. Snyder A.Z. Sapir A. Neural basis and recovery of spatial attention deficits in spatial neglect.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1603-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, Husain and Rorden, 2003Husain M. Rorden C.

The neurological basis of visual neglect.Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2005; 18: 748-753Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated, using a visuospatial attention task, that such strokes may lead to a functional imbalance of evoked responses in left (hyperactive) and right (hypoactive) dorsal parietal cortex, even though these areas are structurally intact (Corbetta et al., 2005Corbetta M. Kincade M.J. Lewis C. Snyder A.Z. Sapir A. Neural basis and recovery of spatial attention deficits in spatial neglect.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1603-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). This imbalance correlates with the degree of contralesional inattention and recovers over time. These observations suggest that structural damage of the ventral network leads to functional impairment of the posterior parietal nodes of the dorsal network. However, this previous fMRI study of neglect only examined task-evoked responses of individual regions. Inferences regarding network-level interactions were purely qualitative. Because stroke injury to part of a network may result in network dysfunction, direct assessments of functional interactions among brain areas using FC MRI should provide a better understanding of neglect. The dorsal and ventral attention networks were originally defined on the basis of task-evoked responses; more recently, using FC MRI acquired in healthy resting adults, Fox et al., 2006Fox M.D. Corbetta M. Snyder A.Z. Vincent J.L. Raichle M.E. Spontaneous neuronal activity distinguishes human dorsal and ventral attention systems.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 10046-10051Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar showed that the same two networks emerge from an analysis of coherent spontaneous fluctuations of BOLD signals. Here, we measured interregional functional connectivity in these two attention networks in patients with neglect at both acute and chronic stages after the ictus. Performance measures on a visuospatial attention task were correlated with FC measures across subjects. The obtained results show that disrupted FC in the dorsal and ventral attention networks constitutes a critical mechanism underlying the pathophysiology of neglect. To measure interregional FC, it was necessary first to identify regions of interest (ROIs) representing nodes in the dorsal and ventral attention systems. To this end, we reanalyzed data obtained in four previously published fMRI studies of visuospatial attention. Two sets of ROIs were defined and validated by FC mapping using data acquired in young healthy subjects, which showed that fluctuations were coherent within each system and largely independent across systems. Having defined two sets of functionally connected regions involved in attention-related functions, we measured interregional FC in patients and age-matched controls and determined whether temporal correlations within fMRI signals correlated with behavioral performance across patients. ROIs in the dorsal and ventral attention networks were determined from a meta-analysis of four previously published event-related fMRI studies of young healthy adults in which spatial attention was manipulated using a Posner-like paradigm (Astafiev et al., 2003Astafiev S.V.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4593-4604Crossref Scopus (427) Google Scholar; see Experimental Procedures and see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). In each experiment the locus of attention was indicated on each trial by a central arrow pointing toward a left or right location on the computer screen. After a variable delay, a target appeared at either the cued location (75% of trials, “valid trials”) or the opposite location (25% of trials, “invalid trials”). Subjects were instructed to maintain fixation on a central crosshair and to detect targets as quickly as possible. In different experiments, detection was signaled by a right-hand key press, a saccadic eye movement, a pointing hand movement, or object identification. Whole-brain ANOVA was conducted on each of the four studies (activation during cue period for dorsal attention regions, activation × validity during the period following target presentation for ventral attention regions) to identify significantly modulated voxels. The Z score maps were combined using a fixed-effects meta-analysis, and ROIs were then identified by an automated peak search algorithm. Eight ROIs in the dorsal attention network (DAN) were consistently recruited in responses to the cue: bilateral FEF, posterior IPS (pIPS), ventral IPS (vIPS), and middle temporal area (MT+; Figure 1A, yellow; Table S1, top). Several regions in the ventral attention network (VAN) were identified by consistently stronger activation to unexpected rather than expected targets: a precentral sulcus region (PrCe), middle frontal gyrus (MFG), anterior insula, TPJ, and superior temporal sulcus (STS; Figure 1A, orange; Table S1, bottom). All ventral regions were lateralized to the right hemisphere. To confirm that these regions constitute separate FC networks, interregional temporal correlations of BOLD signals were examined in a data set of young healthy subjects (n = 12) performing the Posner task. Time courses were extracted from all regions in the right hemisphere, and the consistent task-evoked BOLD responses were removed by regression (see Experimental Procedures and Discussion). The interregional correlation matrix then was computed (Figure S2). Correlations between regions in different networks were significantly weaker than correlations between regions within the DAN (p < 0.0001) or within the VAN (p < 0.0003), indicating that the two networks are dissociable. To explore the distributed spatial topography of the correlated activity, seed ROI-driven FC maps were computed on a voxel-wise basis for each of the nine a priori attention regions in the right hemisphere. For each network, FC maps were combined using a conjunction analysis that identified voxels correlated with at least three of four regions in the DAN (Figure 1B) or four of five regions in the VAN (Figure 1C). Although only right hemisphere regions were used as seeds, the FC-defined DAN network was largely bilaterally symmetric. Regions consistently correlated within the DAN included FEF, MT+, and a large swath of cortex extending along IPS into extrastriate visual cortex. Consistent with task-activation studies, the FC-defined VAN network was strongly right lateralized and included the TPJ extending into the inferior parietal lobule, MFG, PrCe, and anterior insula. A small region also was detected in the left supramarginal gyrus (SMG). Interestingly, the largely bilateral DAN included a right-lateralized region in the middle and inferior frontal lobe (see arrow in Figure 1B), which overlapped with the VAN, suggesting this region may function as a link between networks (see also Fox et al., 2006Fox M.D. Corbetta M. Snyder A.Z. Vincent J.L. Raichle M.E. Spontaneous neuronal activity distinguishes human dorsal and ventral attention systems.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 10046-10051Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). These two a priori sets of ROIs were then applied to the comparison of FC in patients versus in age-matched controls. Defining the ROIs in a separate group of young adults minimized the possibility of bias in the patient versus control comparison. The selected ROIs were complete in the sense that no other brain region outside the two networks showed robust attention-related BOLD response in patients at either stage (Figure S1). We longitudinally studied eleven patients with spatial neglect following right hemisphere stroke (mean age 59, range 42–73, 2 female). Lesions were centered in the IPL, STG, frontal operculum, insula, as well as subcortical nuclei and white matter (Figure 2A). The distribution of lesions in this group is typical of larger samples (Karnath et al., 2004Karnath H.O. Fruhmann Berger M. Kuker W. Rorden C.

The anatomy of visual neglect.Brain. 2003; 126: 1986-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). All ROIs in the DAN were spared by the lesions, whereas ROIs in the VAN were damaged to various degrees. PrCe, MFG, TPJ, STS, and anterior insula were damaged in zero, two, four, three, and three patients, respectively (Figure 2A). Patients performed the Posner task both in and out of the scanner at both the acute (30 ± 23 [mean ± SD] days poststroke) and the chronic (40 ± 11 weeks poststroke) stages of recovery. A group of twelve age-matched normal subjects (mean age 57.4, range 41–71, 7 female) were scanned while performing the Posner task in the same way as the patients. Three types of behavioral deficits in the Posner task were assessed. A visual field (VF)-independent component of neglect was defined as increased misses and slowed reaction times (RT) across both visual fields as compared to controls. A VF-dependent component was defined as more misses and slower RTs in the contralesional than ipsilesional VF. Finally, a “disengagement deficit,” common in neglect patients, was defined as specific impairment in detecting targets in the left VF following an invalid cue, as this condition requires disengaging attention from the good VF and reorienting to the bad VF (Friedrich et al., 1998Friedrich F.J.

The behavioral performance of the patients was compared to age-matched controls using a three-way ANOVA, with group (control or patient), VF (left or right), and cue validity (valid or invalid) as factors (Figure 2B). Patients had significantly more misses than controls (VF-independent impairment, acute—F1,22 = 19.5, p = 0.0002; chronic—F1,22 = 7.4, p = 0.01), were particularly impaired in the left VF (lateralized impairment [VF × group], acute—hit rates, F1,22 = 13.6, p = 0.001; RT, F1,22 = 17.8, p = 0.0004; chronic—hit rates, F1,22 = 2.45, p = 0.1; RT, F1,22 = 15.1, p = 0.0008), and had a significantly greater disengagement deficit ([group × VF × validity], acute—hit rates, F1,22 = 3.9, p = 0.06; RT, n.s.; chronic—hit rates, n.s.; RT, F1,22 = 4.27, p = 0.05). The improvement of behavioral performance from acute to chronic stage was not significant at the p < 0.05 level using the data from the scanner session, although the trends were in the expected direction (Figure 2B). A significant improvement was observed in separate acute and chronic sessions conducted in a regular testing room. Target detection improved overall in both visual fields ([stage], hit rates, F1,9 = 5.6, p = 0.04; RT, F1,10 = 5.3, p = 0.04) and both rightward bias ([stage × VF], RT, F1,10 = 6.4, p < 0.03) and disengagement deficit ([stage × VF × validity], RT, F1,10 = 8.3, p = 0.016) were significantly reduced. Therefore, behavioral impairment including VF-independent, VF-dependent, and disengagement deficits recovered significantly over the interval between the acute and chronic sessions. We conducted several analyses to determine whether stroke affected basic characteristics of the BOLD signals, specifically, variance and temporal frequency distribution. These observations helped to rule out the possibility that the results presented below were artifact attributable to higher signal variance, more movement or abnormal neural-vascular coupling in patients (see Supplemental Data Note 1 and Figure S3 for methods and results). We measured functional connectivity in the DAN after consistent task-related responses were removed from the time series (see Experimental Procedures and Discussion) and found a specific breakdown of FC between left and right pIPS. Left-right pIPS FC was reduced in acute patients as compared to age-matched controls (Figure 3A, p = 0.04, unpaired t test, two-tailed) but fully recovered at the chronic stage (Figure 3A; acute versus chronic, p < 0.03; chronic versus control, 0.72 ± 0.22 versus 0.70 ± 0.16). The disruption of interhemispheric FC was restricted to pIPS among the four homologous region pairs in the DAN (Figure 3C). As noted above, we have previously shown an interhemispheric imbalance in task-evoked BOLD responses in dorsal posterior parietal cortex at the acute stage of neglect that recovers over time (Corbetta et al., 2005Corbetta M.

This finding was reproduced in the current data set (with two subjects not included in the previous study): the right pIPS was less recruited than left pIPS at the acute stage, but the two sides showed balanced activation at the chronic stage (Figure 3B). Critically, the breakdown of FC in dorsal parietal cortex was behaviorally significant. At the acute stage, there was a strong correlation between the strength of left-right pIPS FC and detection of targets in the left visual field following an invalid cue (Figure 3D, hit rates, r = 0.846, p = 0.0005; RT, r = −0.593, p = 0.05), such that the lower the interhemispheric FC in dorsal parietal cortex, the more impaired patients were in reorienting attention toward the neglected visual field. This correlation remained highly significant after correction for both lesion size and movement (hit rates, r = 0.699, p < 0.05). The data from the other three trial types (left valid, right valid, right invalid) showed a similar trend that failed to reach significance (Table S2). The correlation between behavior and FC was specific to dorsal parietal cortex; no significant correlation with behavioral measures was found for the other three homologous region pairs in the DAN (for correlation with hit rates see Table S2). Given that task-evoked responses are also abnormal in pIPS, an important question concerns whether the impairment of FC makes a difference beyond the abnormal evoked responses. Two analyses suggested that disrupted functional connectivity correlated with poor performance independently of task-evoked responses. First, there was no significant correlation between decreased FC and imbalanced task-evoked responses in pIPS (all p > 0.2, Table S3A). Second, partial correlation analyses demonstrated that controlling for the degree of abnormal task-evoked responses did not decrease and, in some cases, even slightly increased the FC-performance correlation (Table S3B). At the chronic stage, the majority of patients showed improvement in both interhemispheric pIPS FC and performance, but three patients continued to show persistent impairments in both measures, resulting in a significant group correlation between these two measures (hit rates, left VF, valid—r = 0.619, p = 0.04; left VF, invalid—r = 0.587, p = 0.057; right VF, invalid—r = 0.712, p = 0.01). Behavioral relevance remained specific to interhemispheric pIPS FC; neither vIPS, FEF, nor MT FC showed correlation with performance (either hit rates or RTs). Consistent with models of attention that posit feedback interactions from attention-controlling dorsal parietal regions to data-processing visual regions (Corbetta and Shulman, 2002Corbetta M.

Accordingly, we measured temporal correlations between left and right visual cortex, using ROIs in retinotopic occipital cortex defined by functional and anatomical criteria (as in Corbetta et al., 2005Corbetta M.

Less is known regarding the molecular basis of protein synthesis regulated by other inputs, such as agonists of the Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling cascade. Ribosomal protein (rp) S6 is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit that becomes phosphorylated at several serine residues upon mitogen stimulation, but the exact molecular mechanisms regulating its phosphorylation and the function of phosphorylated rpS6 is poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence that activation of the p90 ribosomal S6 kinases (RSKs) by serum, growth factors, tumor promoting phorbol esters, and oncogenic Ras is required for rpS6 phosphorylation downstream of the Ras/ERK signaling cascade. We demonstrate that while ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) phosphorylates rpS6 at all sites, RSK exclusively phosphorylates rpS6 at Ser235/236 in vitro and in vivo using an mTOR-independent mechanism. Mutation of rpS6 at Ser235/236 reveals that phosphorylation of these sites promotes its recruitment to the 7-methylguanosine cap complex, suggesting that Ras/ERK signaling regulates assembly of the translation preinitiation complex.

In eukaryotic cells, the main rate-limiting step of translation is initiation, which is controlled by an array of proteins that respond to signaling cascades activated by extracellular signals (reviewed in Refs. 1Dever T.E.

Proud C.G. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6423-6435Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Under conditions of nutrient and energy sufficiency and insulin or mitogen stimulation, mTOR stimulates two important translational regulators, the ribosomal S6 kinases (S6K1 and S6K2) and the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). eIF4E is crucial for ribosome recruitment as it binds to the 7-methylguanosine cap structure (m7GpppN, where N is any nucleotide) at the 5′-end of nearly all transcribed mRNAs to initiate cap-dependent translation (reviewed in Ref. 7Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 279: 169-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When mTOR is active, eIF4E nucleates the assembly of the translation preinitiation complex through recruitment of numerous initiation factors, resulting in association of the ribosomal subunits to the mRNA. S6K1 and S6K2 are serine/threonine kinases directly stimulated by mTOR which in turn, phosphorylate substrates involved in cell and body size (5Fingar D.C. Blenis J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3151-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar, 6Richardson C.J. Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). S6K1 phosphorylates several substrates located in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, including the ribosomal protein (rp) S6 (reviewed in Ref. 9Ruvinsky I. Meyuhas O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 342-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Ribosomal protein S6 is one of 33 proteins that comprise the 40 S ribosomal subunit and represents the most extensively studied substrate of S6K1 (10Thomas G. Siegmann M. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3952-3956Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Because the initial discovery that liver-derived rpS6 was phosphorylated (11Gressner A.M. Wool I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6917-6925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mitogenic stimulation of cells was found to correlate with phosphorylation of rpS6 on serines, which suggested that rpS6 may control mRNA translation in dividing cells (12Bandi H.R. Ferrari S. Krieg J. Meyer H.E. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4530-4533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). rpS6 phosphorylation sites have been mapped to five clustered residues that are conserved in metazoans, consisting of Ser235, Ser236, Ser240, Ser244, and Ser247, located at the C-terminal part of the protein (13Krieg J. Hofsteenge J. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11473-11477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two classes of protein kinases were found to phosphorylate rpS6 in vitro, the S6K1/2 and the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) family of serine/threonine kinases (reviewed in Refs. 14Roux P.P. Blenis J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 320-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar and 15Hauge C. Frodin M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3021-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies determined that rpS6 phosphorylation was largely sensitive to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, indicating that S6K1/2 were the main physiological rpS6 kinases operating in somatic cells (16Chung J. Kuo C.J. Crabtree G.R. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 17Blenis J. Chung J. Erikson E. Alcorta D.A. Erikson R.L.

The RSK family members, in contrast, are not affected by rapamycin as they are activated via the classical mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. The contribution of S6K1/2 in rpS6 phosphorylation was recently addressed using S6K1/S6K2 double knock-out animals, which were found to display no phosphorylation of rpS6 at Ser240/244, but persistent phosphorylation at Ser235/236 (19Pende M. Um S.H. Mieulet V. Sticker M. Goss V.L. Mestan J. Mueller M. Fumagalli S. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 3112-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser235/236 was found to require extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling, suggesting that RSK or other kinases downstream of ERK, such as the mitogen- and stress-activated kinases (MSK1/2), contribute to rpS6 phosphorylation upon mitogen stimulation. The functional importance of rpS6 in animals was underscored by conditional ablation of rpS6 in the liver (20Volarevic S. Stewart M.J. Ledermann B. Zilberman F. Terracciano L. Montini E. Grompe M. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Science. 2000; 288: 2045-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In these mice, hepatocytes failed to proliferate after partial hepatectomy due to a blockage in ribosome biogenesis and cell cycle progression. In vivo and in vitro studies have suggested that rpS6 phosphorylation exerts an effect on translation at the level of mRNA binding; initial chemical protection studies and cross-linking experiments localized rpS6 to the mRNA/tRNA binding site junction between the small and large ribosomal subunits (21Nygard O. Nilsson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6030-6034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, highly phosphorylated ribosomes were found to bind and utilize both synthetic and natural mRNA more efficiently in vitro than unphosphorylated counterparts (22Burkhard S.J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14003-14008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, the role of rpS6 phosphorylation was addressed through the generation of viable and fertile knock-in mice containing alanine substitutions of all five phosphorylatable serine residues in rpS6 (rpS6P–/–) (23Ruvinsky I. Sharon N. Lerer T. Cohen H. Stolovich-Rain M. Nir T. Dor Y. Zisman P. Meyuhas O. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2199-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). These mice suffer from diminished levels of pancreatic insulin, hypoinsulinemia, and impaired glucose tolerance. Despite displaying an apparent increased rate of protein synthesis and accelerated cell division, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from these animals are significantly smaller than rpS6p+/+ MEFs. Moreover, the size of rpS6P–/– MEFs, unlike wild-type MEFs, was not further decreased upon rapamycin treatment, implying that rpS6 is a critical mTOR effector regulating cell size (23Ruvinsky I. Sharon N. Lerer T. Cohen H. Stolovich-Rain M. Nir T. Dor Y. Zisman P. Meyuhas O. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2199-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to data from S6K1 and S6K2 knockouts, which suggest that neither S6K2 nor rpS6 phosphorylation are involved in the growth of islet or skeletal muscle cells (19Pende M. Um S.H. Mieulet V. Sticker M. Goss V.L. Mestan J. Mueller M. Fumagalli S. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 3112-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 20Volarevic S. Stewart M.J. Ledermann B. Zilberman F. Terracciano L. Montini E. Grompe M. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Science. 2000; 288: 2045-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Thus, it remains unclear whether rpS6 phosphorylation plays a role in cell growth. In addition, the nature of all inputs regulating rpS6 phosphorylation, and how this regulated event contributes to protein synthesis, requires further analysis. In this study, we demonstrate that agonists of the ERK signaling pathway promote rpS6 phosphorylation using an mTOR-independent pathway that requires RSK activity. We found that activation of all four RSK isoforms stimulates cap-dependent translation, indicating that RSK provides an additional oncogene- and mitogen-regulated input linking the ERK signaling pathway to the regulation of translation initiation. Analysis of phosphorylation defective mutants of rpS6 indicates that Ras/ERK signaling promotes translation initiation by facilitating assembly of the preinitiation complex. Plasmid Constructs—The plasmids encoding HA-tagged RSK1–3, Ras61L, Ras17N, MEK-DD, S6K1, kinase-inactive, and myristoylated RSK1 were previously described (24Roux P.P. Ballif B.A. Anjum R. Gygi S.P. Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13489-13494Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Mouse rpS6 was cloned into pKH3 in fusion with a triple HA tag. The bicistronic reporter plasmid pRL-5′-IRES-FL was kindly provided by Martin Kruger (Medizinische Hochschule, Hannover, Germany) and has been described (25Kruger M. Beger C. Welch P.J. Barber J.R.

The human RSK4 cDNA was obtained from ATCC and subcloned into pKH3 in fusion with a triple HA tag. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-rpS6 fusion protein was previously described (26Roux P.P.

The point mutants used in this study were generated using the QuikChange methodology (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293E and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics, and transfected using calcium-phosphate (26Roux P.P. Richards S.A. Blenis J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 4796-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were grown for 24 h following transfection and starved of serum where indicated for 16–18 h. Starved cells were pretreated with wortmannin (100 nm), U0126 (10 μm), rapamycin (100 nm)(Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) or a fluoromethylketone (fmk) inhibitor (2–5 μm) (27Cohen M.S. Zhang C. Shokat K.M. Taunton J. Science. 2005; 308: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), and stimulated with either fetal bovine serum (10%), insulin (50 nm), epidermal growth factor (EGF; 25 ng/ml)(Invitrogen), PMA (50 ng/ml), or anisomycin (25 ng/ml)(Biomol) before harvesting. For the small interfering RNA (siRNA) studies, 21-nucleotide complementary RNA with symmetrical two nucleotide overhangs were obtained from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The DNA sequences against which double-stranded RNAs for S6K1, RSK1, RSK2, and scrambled control were created were described elsewhere (28Anjum R. Roux P.P. Ballif B.A. Gygi S.P. Blenis J. Curr.

Transfection efficiency was determined to be greater than 90% using a fluorescently labeled mock siRNA. Twenty-four hours following transfection, cells were serum-starved for 16–18 h and stimulated with either serum or EGF. The fmk inhibitor was synthesized as previously reported (27Cohen M.S. Zhang C. Shokat K.M. Taunton J. Science. 2005; 308: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cell lysates were prepared using CLB (10 mm K3PO4, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Brij 35, 0.1% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate [Na3VO4], 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml of leupeptin, 10 μg/ml of pepstatin) as described previously (26Roux P.P.

Immunoprecipitations were carried out with the indicated antibody for 2 h followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (GE Healthcare) or protein G beads (Sigma) for 1 h. For cap binding assays, lysates were incubated with 7-methyl-GTP Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 2 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer and along with total cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose as described previously (26Roux P.P.

Anti-HA monoclonal antibodies were kindly provided by Margaret Chou (University of Pennsylvania). Anti-p70S6K antibody was described previously (31Romanelli A. Martin K.A. Toker A. Blenis J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 2921-2928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All anti-RSK isoform specific antibodies were kindly provided by Zymed Laboratories Inc. All phosphospecific antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), with the exception of the RSK phospho-Ser380, which was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Both anti-ERK1/2 and antiavian RSK1 antibodies were described previously (26Roux P.P. Richards S.A. Blenis J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 4796-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, anti-rabbit and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were purchased from GE Healthcare and Chemicon (Temecula, CA), respectively. Protein Kinase Assays—Beads from immunoprecipitations were washed twice in lysis buffer and twice in kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate). Kinase assays were performed with GST-rpS6 as substrate (2 μg per assay), and all samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Incorporation of cold or radioactive phosphate 32P was determined by immunoblotting or quantified using a Bio-Rad PhosphorImager with ImageQuant software, respectively. Bicistronic Luciferase Assays—HEK293E or HeLa cells were transiently transfected with a bicistronic luciferase reporter plasmid, pRL-5′-IRES-FL (25Kruger M. Beger C. Welch P.J. Barber J.R. Manns M.P. Wong-Staal F. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 8357-8364Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), which directs cap-dependent translation of the Renilla luciferase (RL) gene and cap-independent HCV IRES-mediated translation of the firefly (FL) gene. This construct was co-transfected along with the indicated DNA and luciferase light units were measured 48-h post-transfection using a dual luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and a Turner Designs TD-20/20 or BIOORBIT luminometer. Assays were performed in triplicate, and results are expressed as mean ± S.D. from the controls. Polysomal Fractionation—Sucrose density gradient centrifugation was employed to separate the subpolysomal from the polysomal ribosome fractions following stimulation of HEK293E cells. Five minutes before harvest, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide was added to the culture medium. Cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, and harvested in polysome lysis buffer (PLB; 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 250 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 250 mm sucrose, 1% Triton X-100, 1.3% sodium deoxycholate, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, and protease inhibitors). Samples were incubated on ice for 15 min and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was layered on a 20–50% linear sucrose gradient (in PLB) and centrifuged in a SW40 rotor at 34,000 rpm (145,000 × g) for 165 min at 4 °C. Following centrifugation, the A260 was continuously monitored and recorded using a Gradient Station IP (Biocomp, Fredericton, NB) attached to a UV-MII (GE Healthcare) spectrophotometer. Ras/ERK Signaling Regulates rpS6 Phosphorylation on Ser235/236 Using an mTOR-independent but MEK1/2-dependent Pathway—To characterize potential mTOR-independent pathways leading to rpS6 phosphorylation, HEK293E cells were stimulated with serum over a time course (Fig. 1A). Phosphorylation of rpS6 was analyzed using two phosphospecific antibodies that recognize rpS6 when dually phosphorylated on Ser235/236 or Ser240/244. We show that, within 10 min of serum stimulation, rpS6 is robustly phosphorylated at all sites analyzed, reaching maximal phosphorylation at 30 min of stimulation (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–5). The kinetics of rpS6 phosphorylation was slightly different between the sites analyzed, with phosphorylation of Ser235/236 occurring with much faster kinetics than Ser240/244, suggesting that phosphorylation of these sites is regulated by different mitogen-regulated signaling pathways. When cells were pretreated with rapamycin, which completely inhibited S6K1 phosphotransferase activity (Fig. 1B) and phosphorylation at its hydrophobic motif (Thr389), serum did not promote rpS6 phosphorylation at Ser240/244. However, Ser235/236 remained partly phosphorylated in cells treated with rapamycin, indicating the presence of an mTOR-independent pathway leading to rpS6 phosphorylation at these sites. To determine if the ERK signaling pathway was contributing to Ser235/236 phosphorylation, cells were pretreated with the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 before stimulation with serum. Whereas phosphorylation of Ser240/244 was not significantly affected by U0126 at a concentration that efficiently blocked ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Thr202/Tyr204) and RSK phosphotransferase activity (Fig. 1C), we found that Ser235/236 phosphorylation was strongly reduced by the inhibitor. Interestingly, U0126 treatment resulted in a stronger inhibition of the early phase of Ser235/236 phosphorylation (within 10 min), suggesting a possible link between ERK signaling and the initial phase of rpS6 phosphorylation upon serum stimulation. Importantly, when rapamycin and U0126 were combined, rpS6 phosphorylation was completely inhibited, indicating that Ser235/236 phosphorylation occurs through mTOR- and MEK1/2-dependent mechanisms, whereas Ser240/244 phosphorylation is regulated predominantly via an mTOR-dependent mechanism. To determine the role of ERK signaling in rpS6 phosphorylation, we examined the regulation of rpS6 phosphorylation in cells treated with strong inducers of the Ras/ERK signaling cascade. Stimulation of cells with the phorbol ester PMA, which stimulates Ras/ERK but not PI3K/Akt signaling in HEK293E cells, resulted in a strong induction in ERK and RSK activation, and rpS6 phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, Ser235/236 phosphorylation was strongly inhibited by U0126 and only partly inhibited by rapamycin, implying the more important contribution played by the ERK signaling cascade under these conditions. Next, we determined whether oncogenic Ras could promote rpS6 phosphorylation at Ser235/236. We found that oncogenic Ras (61L), but not a dominant negative allele (17N), induced strong rpS6 phosphorylation at Ser235/236 (Fig. 2B). This stimulation was strongly inhibited by U0126 (Fig. 2C), indicating that ERK signaling is required for rpS6 phosphorylation under mTOR-independent conditions. Phorbol Esters, Growth Factors, and Serum Stimulate Ribosomal Protein S6 Phosphorylation via RSK—Our data suggest that a kinase activated by Ras/ERK signaling regulates rpS6 phosphorylation at Ser235/236, and the likely candidate basophilic kinases include members of the RSK and MSK families. To determine the implication of RSK in rpS6 phosphorylation, we used siRNA duplexes directed against RSK1 and RSK2, the predominantly expressed RSK isoforms in HEK293E and HeLa cells. Whereas knockdown of S6K1 reduced serum-stimulated rpS6 phosphorylation at all sites examined upon serum stimulation (Fig. 3A, lane 3), we found that knockdown of either RSK1 or RSK2 also reduced rpS6 phosphorylation at Ser235/236, and to a lesser extent, Ser240/244 (Fig. 3A, lanes 4 and 5). This inhibition was even stronger when both RSK isoforms were simultaneously knocked down (Fig. 3B), indicating that RSK1 and RSK2 are normally involved in rpS6 phosphorylation upon serum and growth factor stimulation. A fluoromethylketone (fmk) inhibitor was recently identified and characterized as an irreversible kinase inhibitor of RSK (27Cohen M.S. Zhang C. Shokat K.M. Taunton J. Science. 2005; 308: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). We confirmed the specificity of this inhibitor and found that fmk treatment of cells specifically inhibited RSK1 and RSK2 activity by about 60%, while leaving S6K1 and MSK1/2 activity unaltered (data not shown). Similar to the data obtained using siRNAs (Fig. 3), inhibition of RSK using fmk significantly reduced rpS6 phosphorylation at Ser235/236, but did not inhibit Ser240/244 phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). RSK inhibition was more effective at early time points of serum stimulation (2–10 min), which correlated with the peak of RSK and ERK1/2 activity as shown by phosphorylation at Ser380 and Thr202/Tyr204, respectively. These results implicate the RSK isoforms in the early phase of rpS6 phosphorylation at Ser235/236, as previously suggested by the use of the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 (Fig. 1A). To determine whether RSK activity is required for rpS6 phosphorylation induced by other mitogenic stimuli, cells were pretreated with fmk before stimulation with serum, PMA, EGF, or insulin (Fig. 4B). Importantly, fmk-mediated inhibition of RSK activity significantly reduced rpS6 phosphorylation at Ser235/236 in response to all Ras/ERK pathway stimuli (Fig. 4B, lanes 7–9). Consistent with the requirement for Ras/ERK signaling, treatment with fmk had no effect on rpS6 phosphorylation induced by insulin, which is not a potent stimulator of RSK activity in these cells (30Tee A.R.

RSK1, RSK2, and S6K1 Phosphorylate rpS6 in Vitro and in Vivo with Different Specificities—The phosphorylation sites on rpS6 are located within a highly basic C-terminal region of the protein (Fig. 5A). The presence of basic residues at the –5 and –3 positions before Ser235 and Ser236 (Lys-Arg-Arg-Arg-Leu-Ser235-Ser236) locates these serines within optimal consensus phosphorylation sequences for both RSK family members and S6K1 (32Leighton I.A. Dalby K.N. Caudwell F.B. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, Ser240 and Ser244 are not preceded by such basic residues (Ser-Ser-Leu-Arg-Ala-Ser240-Thr-Ser-Lys-Ser244) indicating that they are not ideal RSK or S6K1 phosphorylation sites. To determine the specificity of RSK1, RSK2, and S6K1 toward rpS6, endogenous immunoprecipitates of these kinases were subjected to in vitro kinase reactions with a GST fusion protein containing the C-terminal tail of human rpS6 as substrate. Increasing amounts of kinase immunoprecipitates were tested and, as expected, RSK1, RSK2, and S6K1 were equally able to phosphorylate rpS6 on Ser235/236 as detected with phosphospecific antibodies (Fig. 5B). Importantly, we found that S6K1, but not RSK1 or RSK2, was capable of phosphorylating rpS6 on Ser240/244. Indeed, while RSK1 and RSK2 robustly stimulated 32P incorporation in GST-rpS6 to similar levels attained by S6K1, none of this activity was found to be targeted toward Ser240/244. These results indicate that RSK1 and RSK2 have a higher requirement for basic residues at the –5 and –3 positions, and suggest that the RSK isoforms do not directly phosphorylate Ser240/244 in cells. To determine the kinase specificity of RSK toward rpS6 in vivo, cells were transiently transfected with wt, constitutively active (Myr), and kinase inactive (kd) forms of RSK1. Transfected cells were serum-starved for 18 h and assayed for basal rpS6 phosphorylation at Ser235/236 and Ser240/244 (Fig. 5C). As expected, expression of wt RSK1 (lane 6) or a kd RSK1 (lane 10) did not significantly stimulate rpS6 phosphorylation in serum-starved cells. However, expression of Myr RSK1 (lane 8) robustly increased rpS6 phosphorylation at Ser235/236. The level of Ser235/236 phosphorylation was equivalent to that observed in insulin-stimulated cells, but phosphorylation at Ser240/244 was not significantly elevated by Myr RSK1 expression. We have previously found that RSK can modulate mTOR signaling through the phosphorylation and inactivation of TSC2 (24Roux P.P. Ballif B.A. Anjum R. Gygi S.P. Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13489-13494Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). However, we found that constitutively activated RSK1-stimulated rpS6 phosphorylation was insensitive to rapamycin treatment (Fig. 5C, lane 9), indicating that RSK regulates rpS6 phosphorylation using mTOR-independent mechanisms. To determine whether constitutively activated RSK1 stimulated rpS6 phosphorylation directly, cells were pretreated with U0126, wortmannin, or rapamycin for 30 min and analyzed for rpS6 phosphorylation (Fig. 5D). We have previously shown that activation of Myr RSK1 is insensitive to t"
https://openalex.org/W1971846931,"A function is defined for ultraconserved elements (UCEs), extragenic regions of eukaryotic genomes can show high degrees of conservation across species. It is also found that when alternative splicing (mediated by splicing regulator proteins) leads to UCE incorporation into the splicing regulator protein's mRNA, the mRNA is targeted for degradation. Thus, the UCEs help promote negative feedback regulation of the splicing regulator gene expression. The human and mouse genomes share a number of long, perfectly conserved nucleotide sequences, termed ultraconserved elements1. Whereas these regions can act as transcriptional enhancers when upstream of genes, those within genes are less well understood. In particular, the function of ultraconserved elements that overlap alternatively spliced exons of genes encoding RNA-binding proteins is unknown1,2. Here we report that in every member of the human SR family of splicing regulators, highly or ultraconserved elements are alternatively spliced, either as alternative ‘poison cassette exons’ containing early in-frame stop codons, or as alternative introns in the 3′ untranslated region. These alternative splicing events target the resulting messenger RNAs for degradation by means of an RNA surveillance pathway called nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Mouse orthologues of the human SR proteins exhibit the same unproductive splicing patterns. Three SR proteins have been previously shown to direct splicing of their own transcripts, and one of these is known to autoregulate its expression by coupling alternative splicing with decay3,4,5; our results suggest that unproductive splicing is important for regulation of the entire SR family. We find that unproductive splicing associated with conserved regions has arisen independently in different SR genes, suggesting that splicing factors may readily acquire this form of regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2062772815,"Extinction of conditioned fear is an active learning process requiring N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), but the timing, location, and neural mechanisms of NMDAR-mediated processing in extinction are a matter of debate. Here we show that infusion of the NMDAR antagonist CPP into the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) prior to, or immediately after, extinction training impaired 24 hr recall of extinction. These findings indicate that consolidation of extinction requires posttraining activation of NMDARs within the vmPFC. Using multichannel unit recording, we observed that CPP selectively reduced burst firing in vmPFC neurons, suggesting that bursting in vmPFC is necessary for consolidation of extinction. In support of this, we found that the degree of bursting in infralimbic vmPFC neurons shortly after extinction predicted subsequent recall of extinction. We suggest that NMDAR-dependent bursting in the infralimbic vmPFC initiates calcium-dependent molecular cascades that stabilize extinction memory, thereby allowing for successful recall of extinction."
https://openalex.org/W2003781078,"Phenotypic divergences between modern human populations have developed as a result of genetic adaptation to local environments over the past 100,000 years. To identify genes involved in population-specific phenotypes, it is necessary to detect signatures of recent positive selection in the human genome. Although detection of elongated linkage disequilibrium (LD) has been a powerful tool in the field of evolutionary genetics, current LD-based approaches are not applicable to already fixed loci. Here, we report a method of scanning for population-specific strong selective sweeps that have reached fixation. In this method, genome-wide SNP data is used to analyze differences in the haplotype frequency, nucleotide diversity, and LD between populations, using the ratio of haplotype homozygosity between populations. To estimate the detection power of the statistics used in this study, we performed computer simulations and found that these tests are relatively robust against the density of typed SNPs and demographic parameters if the advantageous allele has reached fixation. Therefore, we could determine the threshold for maintaining high detection power, regardless of SNP density and demographic history. When this method was applied to the HapMap data, it was able to identify the candidates of population-specific strong selective sweeps more efficiently than the outlier approach that depends on the empirical distribution. This study, confirming strong positive selection on genes previously reported to be associated with specific phenotypes, also identifies other candidates that are likely to contribute to phenotypic differences between human populations."
https://openalex.org/W2137714739,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common, lethal genetic disorder of children. A number of animal models of muscular dystrophy exist, but the most effective model for characterizing the structural and functional properties of dystrophin and therapeutic interventions has been the mdx mouse. Despite the approximately 20 years of investigations of the mdx mouse, the impact of the disease on the life span of mdx mice and the cause of death remain unresolved. Consequently, a life span study of the mdx mouse was designed that included cohorts of male and female mdx and wild-type C57BL/10 mice housed under specific pathogen-free conditions with deaths restricted to natural causes and with examination of the carcasses for pathology. Compared with wild-type mice, both mdx male and female mice had reduced life spans and displayed a progressively dystrophic muscle histopathology. Surprisingly, old mdx mice were prone to develop muscle tumors that resembled the human form of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, a cancer associated with poor prognosis. Rhabdomyosarcomas have not been observed previously in nontransgenic mice. The results substantiate the mdx mouse as an important model system for studies of the pathogenesis of and potential remedies for DMD."

https://openalex.org/W2079115909,"The biodiversity of ecosystems worldwide is changing because of species loss due to human-caused extinctions and species gain through intentional and accidental introductions. Here we show that the combined effect of these two processes is altering the trophic structure of food webs in coastal marine systems. This is because most extinctions ( approximately 70%) occur at high trophic levels (top predators and other carnivores), while most invasions are by species from lower trophic levels (70% macroplanktivores, deposit feeders, and detritivores). These opposing changes thus alter the shape of marine food webs from a trophic pyramid capped by a diverse array of predators and consumers to a shorter, squatter configuration dominated by filter feeders and scavengers. The consequences of the simultaneous loss of diversity at top trophic levels and gain at lower trophic levels is largely unknown. However, current research suggests that a better understanding of how such simultaneous changes in diversity can impact ecosystem function will be required to manage coastal ecosystems and forecast future changes."
https://openalex.org/W1999556384,"Background Double stranded RNA (dsRNA) is widely accepted as an RNA motif recognized as a danger signal by the cellular sentries. However, the biology of non-segmented negative strand RNA viruses, or Mononegavirales, is hardly compatible with the production of such dsRNA. Methodology and Principal Findings During measles virus infection, the IFN-β gene transcription was found to be paralleled by the virus transcription, but not by the virus replication. Since the expression of every individual viral mRNA failed to activate the IFN-β gene, we postulated the involvement of the leader RNA, which is a small not capped and not polyadenylated RNA firstly transcribed by Mononegavirales. The measles virus leader RNA, synthesized both in vitro and in vivo, was efficient in inducing the IFN-β expression, provided that it was delivered into the cytosol as a 5′-trisphosphate ended RNA. The use of a human cell line expressing a debilitated RIG-I molecule, together with overexpression studies of wild type RIG-I, showed that the IFN-β induction by virus infection or by leader RNA required RIG-I to be functional. RIG-I binds to leader RNA independently from being 5-trisphosphate ended; while a point mutant, Q299A, predicted to establish contacts with the RNA, fails to bind to leader RNA. Since the 5′-triphosphate is required for optimal RIG-I activation but not for leader RNA binding, our data support that RIG-I is activated upon recognition of the 5′-triphosphate RNA end. Conclusions/Significance RIG-I is proposed to recognize Mononegavirales transcription, which occurs in the cytosol, while scanning cytosolic RNAs, and to trigger an IFN response when encountering a free 5′-triphosphate RNA resulting from a mislocated transcription activity, which is therefore considered as the hallmark of a foreign invader."
https://openalex.org/W2056067421,"Standardized Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 exhibits beneficial effects to patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). It was previously demonstrated that EGb 761 inhibits amyloid beta (Abeta) oligomerization in vitro, protects neuronal cells against Abeta toxicity, and improves cognitive defects in a mouse model of AD (Tg 2576). In this study, the neurogenic potential of EGb 761 and its effect on cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) were examined in a double transgenic mouse model (TgAPP/PS1). EGb 761 significantly increases cell proliferation in the hippocampus of both young (6 months) and old (22 months) TgAPP/PS1 mice, and the total number of neuronal precursor cells in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, Abeta oligomers inhibit phosphorylation of CREB and cell proliferation in the hippocampus of TgAPP/PS1 mice. Administration of EGb 761 reduces Abeta oligomers and restores CREB phosphorylation in the hippocampus of these mice. The present findings suggest that 1) enhanced neurogenesis by EGb 761 may be mediated by activation of CREB, 2) stimulation of neurogenesis by EGb 761 may contribute to its beneficial effects in AD patients and improved cognitive functions in the mouse model of AD, and 3) EGb 761 has therapeutic potential for the prevention and improved treatment of AD."

The objectives of this study were (i) to measure adherence to antihypertensive therapy in a representative sample of the hypertensive Pakistani population and (ii) to investigate the factors associated with adherence in the studied population. Methods and Results A cross-sectional study was conducted on a simple random sample of 460 patients at the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) and National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Karachi, from September 2005–May 2006. Adherence was assessed using the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS), with scores ranging from 0 (non-adherent) to 4 (adherent). In addition to MMAS, patient self-reports about the number of pills taken over a prescribed period were used to estimate adherence as a percentage. AKU Anxiety and Depression Scale (AKU-ADS) was incorporated to find any association between depression and adherence. At a cut-off value of 80%, 77% of the cases were adherent. Upon univariate analyses, increasing age, better awareness and increasing number of pills prescribed significantly improved adherence, while depression showed no association. Significant associations, upon multivariate analyses, included number of drugs that a patient was taking (P<0.02) and whether he/she was taking medication regularly or only for symptomatic relief (P<0.00001). Conclusions Similar to what has been reported worldwide, younger age, poor awareness, and symptomatic treatment adversely affected adherence to antihypertensive medication in our population. In contrast, monotherapy reduced adherence, whereas psychosocial factors such as depression showed no association. These findings may be used to identify the subset of population at risk of low adherence who should be targeted for interventions to achieve better blood pressure control and hence prevent complications."

How these diverse connections contribute to critical period onset was investigated by nonstationary fluctuation analysis following laser photo-uncaging of GABA onto discrete sites upon individual pyramidal cells in slices of mouse visual cortex. The GABAA receptor number decreased on the soma-proximal dendrite (SPD), but not at the axon initial segment, with age and sensory deprivation. Benzodiazepine sensitivity was also higher on the immature SPD. Too many or too few SPD receptors in immature or dark-reared mice, respectively, were adjusted to critical period levels by benzodiazepine treatment in vivo, which engages ocular dominance plasticity in these animal models. Combining GAD65 deletion with dark rearing from birth confirmed that an intermediate number of SPD receptors enable plasticity. Site-specific optimization of perisomatic GABA response may thus trigger experience-dependent development in visual cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2005706097,"Cofilin and its closely related protein, actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF), are key regulators of actin cytoskeleton dynamics that have been implicated in growth cone motility and neurite extension. Cofilin/ADF are inactivated by LIM kinase (LIMK)-catalyzed phosphorylation and reactivated by Slingshot (SSH)-catalyzed dephosphorylation. Here we examined the roles of cofilin/ADF, LIMKs (LIMK1 and LIMK2), and SSHs (SSH1 and SSH2) in nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neurite extension. Knockdown of cofilin/ADF by RNA interference almost completely inhibited NGF-induced neurite extension from PC12 cells, and double knockdown of SSH1/SSH2 significantly suppressed both NGF-induced cofilin/ADF dephosphorylation and neurite extension from PC12 cells, thus indicating that cofilin/ADF and their activating phosphatases SSH1/SSH2 are critical for neurite extension. Interestingly, NGF stimulated the activities of both LIMK1 and LIMK2 in PC12 cells, and suppression of LIMK1/LIMK2 expression or activity significantly reduced NGF-induced neurite extension from PC12 cells or chick dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Inhibition of LIMK1/LIMK2 activity reduced actin filament assembly in the peripheral region of the growth cone of chick DRG neurons.

In addition, the growth cone collapse induced by semaphorin-3A (a repulsive guidance molecule) or Nogo-66 (a myelin-associated inhibitor of axon regeneration) requires transient activation of LIMK1 and cofilin phosphorylation in chick DRG neurons (18Aizawa H.

These results suggest that LIMK1 acts as a negative regulator of neurite out-growth by inhibiting cofilin/ADF activity.

Thus, further studies are required to understand the role of LIMK1 in neurite extension. In this study, we examined the roles of cofilin/ADF and its phosphoregulation in neurite extension by knocking down the expression of cofilin/ADF, LIMK1/LIMK2, and SSH1/SSH2 using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Knockdown of cofilin/ADF markedly blocked NGF-induced neurite extension of PC12 cells, and knockdown of SSH1/SSH2 suppressed NGF-induced cofilin/ADF dephosphorylation and neurite extension, indicating that SSH1/SSH2-mediated cofilin/ADF dephosphorylation is crucial for neurite extension. LIMK1 and LIMK2 were also activated after NGF stimulation of PC12 cells, and knockdown of LIMK1/LIMK2 significantly suppressed NGF-induced neurite extension from PC12 cells and chick DRG neurons. Our results indicate that both LIMK1/LIMK2-mediated phosphorylation and SSH1/SSH2-mediated dephosphorylation of cofilin/ADF are important for neurite extension.

S3 and RV peptides were designed and synthesized as described previously (18Aizawa H. Wakatsuki S. Ishii A. Moriyama K. Sasaki Y. Ohashi K. Sekine-Aizawa Y. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Mizuno K. Goshima Y.

Plasmids—The siRNA-targeting constructs were generated using pSUPER or pSUPER.retro.puro vectors (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA), as described previously (26Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3928) Google Scholar). The 19-base targeting sequences were as follows: 5′-GACTTGCGTAGCCTTAAGA-3′ (rat LIMK1), 5′-GGACAAGAAGCTGAATCTG-3′ (rat LIMK2), 5′-GAGGAGCTGTCCCGATGAC-3′ (rat SSH1), 5′-TGCGTCAAACTTAGAGGAC-3′ (rat SSH2), 5′-GCACGAATTACAAGCTAAC-3′ (rat cofilin), 5′-GCACGAGTATCAAGCAAAT-3′ (rat ADF), 5′-GGAGCTGATCCGCTTTGAT-3′ (chick LIMK1), and 5′-CTGCCTAATCAAGTTGGAT-3′ (chick LIMK2). We also used the second siRNA sequences (termed siRNA2) targeting rat and chick LIMKs as follows: 5′-GAAGGACTACTGGGCCCGC-3′ (rat LIMK1), 5′-GTGAAAGAGGTCAACCGGA-3′ (rat LIMK2), 5′-GTTCATCGGAGTGCTTTAC-3′ (chick LIMK1), and 5′-GGACAAGAAGCTCAATCTC-3′ (chick LIMK2). As a control, we used a non-targeting sequence, 5′-TCTTCCCCCAAGAAAGATA-3′, which does not exist in the rat or chick genome. Expression plasmids coding for N-terminally Myc-tagged chick LIMK1 (chLIMK1) and chLIMK2 and C-terminally Myc-tagged chick cofilin and ADF were constructed by inserting their full-length cDNAs into pMyc-C1 or pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(+) mammalian expression vector containing the Myc epitope tag (13Endo M. Ohashi K. Sasaki Y. Goshima Y. Niwa R. Uemura T. Mizuno K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2527-2537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ohashi K. Toshima J. Tajinda K. Nakamura T. Mizuno K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 111: 636-642Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Expression plasmid (pEYFP-C1) coding for yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) was purchased from Clontech. Cell Culture and Electroporation—PC12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum. Cells were plated in poly-l-lysine-coated dishes. For the RNA interference experiments, cells were mixed with pSUPER constructs in Opti-minimum essential medium and electroporated at 320 V and 975 μF using a Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad). After recovery, the cells were selected by incubation with puromycin (3 μg/ml) for 2 days and then used for further analysis. Chick DRG explants were cultured as described previously (13Endo M. Ohashi K. Sasaki Y. Goshima Y. Niwa R. Uemura T. Mizuno K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2527-2537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For siRNA experiments for chick DRG neurons, we used the chick Neuron Nucleofector Kit (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD), according to the manufacture’s instructions. Briefly, chick DRGs were dissected from E7-8 chick embryos and digested with 0.25% trypsin for 10 min at 37 °C. Dissociated cells were centrifuged and resuspended in nucleofection solution, mixed with 3 μg of pSUPER plasmid and 1 μg of YFP plasmid and electroporated using the fixed program (G-13). Electroporated cells were transferred to dishes and incubated for 1 h at 37°C in 5% CO2 to remove non-neuronal cells. Medium containing non-adherent cells was collected, centrifuged, and suspended in Ham’s F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, N2 supplement and 20 ng/ml NGF (Wako, Osaka, Japan), and then plated in poly-l-lysine-coated dishes. After 48 h of incubation, the neurons were resuspended in Ham’s F-12 medium containing 4% bovine serum albumin, N2 supplement, and 20 ng/ml NGF, replated in poly-l-lysine- and laminin-coated glass-bottom culture dishes, and further incubated for 12 h before time-lapse observation. CHO-K1 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium-α supplemented with 9% fetal bovine serum and transfected using Lipofectamine-2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Generation of PC12 Cell Lines—Retrovirus stocks encoding human SSH1 or mouse SSH2 were obtained by transfection of pLNCX plasmids (Clontech) encoding human SSH1 or mouse SSH2 cDNAs with packaging vectors (retrovirus packaging kit Ampho, Takara Bio, Otsu, Japan) into 293T cells and by harvesting conditioned growth medium containing secreted retrovirus. Virus stocks were filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, supplemented with 8 μg/ml polybrene, and incubated with PC12 cells for 48 h. PC12 cells expressing retrovirus-encoding cDNAs were selected for growth in medium containing 800 μg/ml G418. Recombinant Herpes Simplex Virus Preparation and Infection—The recombinant herpes simplex virus stocks were prepared as described previously (13Endo M. Ohashi K. Sasaki Y. Goshima Y. Niwa R. Uemura T. Mizuno K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2527-2537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For infection, freshly dissociated DRG explants were allowed to adhere to dishes for 30 min and then incubated with recombinant viral stocks for 12 h before analysis. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analyses—Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses were performed as described previously (28Ohashi K. Nagata K. Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3577-3582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). In Vitro Kinase Assay—Serum-starved PC12 cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml NGF and lysed in kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). LIMK1 or LIMK2 was immunoprecipitated with anti-LIMK1 or anti-LIMK2 antibodies and subjected to an in vitro kinase assay using His6-tagged cofilin as a substrate, as described (13Endo M. Ohashi K. Sasaki Y. Goshima Y. Niwa R. Uemura T. Mizuno K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2527-2537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures were separated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography, Amido Black staining, and immunoblotting with anti-LIMK1 and anti-LIMK2 antibodies. Neurite Outgrowth Assay—PC12 cells were cotransfected with pSUPER and YFP plasmids (4:1) by electroporation, cultured for 32 h and further serum-starved for 16 h. Then, neurite outgrowth was stimulated with 50 ng/ml NGF and allowed to proceed for 48 h in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The cells with neurites longer than two cell body lengths of YFP-positive cells were scored as the neurite-bearing cells. The mean lengths of the longest neurites were measured for YFP-positive cells with neurites longer than one cell body length. Time-lapse Video Fluorescence Image Analysis and Quantification—Live growth cones of chick DRG neurons were observed using an inverted fluorescence microscope (model DMIRBE, Leica) equipped with a 40× phase-contrast objective lens, as described (13Endo M. Ohashi K. Sasaki Y. Goshima Y. Niwa R. Uemura T. Mizuno K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2527-2537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Time-lapse fluorescence images were captured every 30 s for 15 min with 50-100-ms exposures, using a Coolsnap HQ-cooled CCD camera (Roper Scientific) driven by Q550FW Imaging Software (Leica). For quantification of areas of protrusion, a series of images was digitized. Growth cones were outlined at 30-s intervals, and the outlines were used to calculate areas of new protrusion of the growth cone perimeter by binary segmentation using IPLab image analysis software (Scanalytics, Fairfax, VA). The index of growth cone motility was calculated by dividing the average area of new protrusions of each growth cone measured at 30-s intervals over a total recording time of 3 min by the average growth cone perimeter during 3 min of recording. The rate of neurite extension was defined as the mean distance that the center of the growth cone migrated during 10 min of recording. Statistical analyses were performed using Student’s t test. Immunofluorescence and Quantification of Actin Assembly—DRG explants were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde containing 10% sucrose for 20 min followed by -20 °C methanol for 5 min. The explants were blocked with 2% fetal bovine serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h and then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-P-cofilin antibodies that recognize both P-cofilin and P-ADF (8Toshima J. Toshima J.Y. Amano T. Yang N. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1131-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and a monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (AC-15, Sigma) overnight at 4 °C, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with fluorescein- and rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. To quantify the actin assembly at the leading edge of the growth cone, DRG neurons were stained with anti-β-actin antibody, and noncollapsed growth cones were randomly selected and fluorescence images were acquired using a Coolsnap HQ-cooled CCD camera driven by Q550FW Imaging Software. Growth cones were outlined on the fluorescence image by automatic outline tool and the average fluorescence intensity (mean pixel density) in a region of 5 μm width inside the front edge of the growth cone was measured using NIH image (Version 1.63). The fluorescence intensities were collected from 20-25 different growth cones per each sample group. Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t test. Both SSH1 and SSH2 Are Involved in NGF-induced Cofilin/ADF Dephosphorylation in PC12 Cells—To investigate the effect of cofilin/ADF phosphoregulation on NGF-induced neurite extension, we first analyzed changes in P-cofilin/P-ADF levels in PC12 cells after NGF stimulation. Immunoblot analysis with an anti-P-cofilin antibody, which recognizes both P-cofilin and P-ADF (8Toshima J. Toshima J.Y. Amano T. Yang N. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1131-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), revealed that NGF induced cofilin/ADF dephosphorylation in PC12 cells (Fig. 1A), as previously reported (16Meberg P.J. Ono S. Minamide L.S. Takahashi M. Bamburg J.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 39: 172-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). To examine whether SSHs are responsible for the NGF-induced cofilin/ADF dephosphorylation, we suppressed SSH1 and SSH2 expression with siRNAs, using a pSUPER.retro.puro vector containing the puromycin-resistance gene to allow selection of siRNA-transfected cells. Transfection of siRNA plasmids targeting rat SSH1 and SSH2 substantially reduced the expression of endogenous SSH1 and SSH2, respectively, in PC12 cells (Fig. 1B). Knockdown of SSH1 or SSH2 alone produced no apparent effect on NGF-induced cofilin/ADF dephosphorylation (Fig. 1C). In contrast, knockdown of both SSH1 and SSH2 at the same time notably inhibited NGF-induced dephosphorylation of cofilin/ADF (Fig. 1C), indicating that SSH1 and SSH2 function redundantly for NGF-induced cofilin/ADF dephosphorylation. In PC12 cell lines stably expressing human SSH1-Myc or mouse SSH2-Myc, whose expression was not affected by the siRNA plasmids targeting rat SSH1 or SSH2, double knockdown of rat SSH1/SSH2 had no apparent effect on NGF-induced cofilin/ADF dephosphorylation (Fig. 1D). Thus, the siRNA-resistant human SSH1 and mouse SSH2 restored NGF-induced cofilin/ADF dephosphorylation. NGF-induced cofilin/ADF dephosphorylation was blocked by K252a (an inhibitor of Trk tyrosine kinase receptors), U73122 (an inhibitor of phospholipase C), and latrunculin A (an inhibitor of actin filament assembly) (Fig. 1E), which indicates that NGF-induced cofilin/ADF dephosphorylation requires Trk, phospholipase C, and F-actin. Cofilin and ADF Are Essential for NGF-induced Neurite Extension from PC12 Cells—Cofilin and ADF are closely related proteins and PC12 cells express both (16Meberg P.J. Ono S. Minamide L.S. Takahashi M. Bamburg J.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 39: 172-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). To examine whether cofilin and ADF affect NGF-induced neurite out-growth from PC12 cells, we suppressed the expression of endogenous cofilin and ADF in PC12 cells by transfecting cofilin and ADF siRNA plasmids (Fig. 2A). The PC12 cells were cotransfected with YFP plasmids to permit the transfected cells to be visualized. The transfected cells were cultured for 32 h, serumstarved for 16 h, and then stimulated with NGF for 48 h (Fig. 2B). Transfection of cofilin/ADF siRNAs had no apparent effect on the viablity of PC12 cells (supplemental Fig. S1). To quantitate the effects of cofilin/ADF siRNA on neurite extension, we scored the percentage of neurite-bearing cells with neurites longer than two cell body lengths in YFP-positive cells (Fig. 2C). We also compared the mean lengths of the longest neurites of YFP-positive cells with neurites longer than one cell body (Fig. 2D). Individual knockdown of cofilin or ADF significantly reduced both the number of neurite-bearing cells and the mean neurite length, compared with cells treated with a control siRNA. ADF knockdown suppressed neurite outgrowth more prominently than cofilin knockdown. When both cofilin and ADF were knocked down simultaneously, the percentage of neurite-bearing cells drastically decreased (Fig. 2B, 2C). Cotransfection of chick cofilin or ADF, whose expression was not affected by rat cofilin or ADF siRNA, significantly blocked the inhibitory effects of cofilin/ADF knockdown on neurite extension (Fig. 2E), which indicates that the effects of cofilin/ADF siRNAs are due to the suppression of cofilin/ADF expression. These results suggest that cofilin/ADF are essential for NGF-induced neurite outgrowth from PC12 cells. SSH1 and SSH2 Are Critical for NGF-induced Neurite Extension from PC12 Cells—We next examined whether SSH1 and SSH2 are involved in NGF-induced neurite extension from PC12 cells by knocking down SSH1 and SSH2 with siRNAs (Fig. 3A, see also Fig. 1B). The percentage of neurite-bearing cells was significantly reduced by SSH1 or SSH2 single knockdown or SSH1/SSH2 double knockdown, compared with control siRNA (Fig. 3B). The mean neurite length was also reduced in single and double SSH knockdown cells (Fig. 3C). In PC12 cells stably expressing human SSH1 or mouse SSH2, the number of neurite-bearing cells (Fig. 3D) and the mean neurite length (not shown) were not affected by either single or double knockdown of endogenous rat SSH1/SSH2, which indicates that the effects of SSH1/SSH2 siRNA on neurite extension are attributable to the suppression of SSH1/SSH2 expression and both SSH1 and SSH2 act to promote NGF-induced neurite extension from PC12 cells. NGF Induces LIMK1/LIMK2 Activation in PC12 Cells—NGF induces cofilin/ADF dephosphorylation, raising the possibility that the kinase activity of LIMKs may be negatively regulated by NGF stimulation. However, when we examined the changes in the kinase activities of LIMK1 and LIMK2 in PC12 cells after NGF stimulation, both LIMK1 and LIMK2 were activated rather than repressed. LIMK1 activity increased 1.7-fold at 2 min after NGF treatment and then reverted to the basal level by 30 min (Fig. 4A). In contrast, LIMK2 activity gradually increased, reaching 1.5-fold by 30 min after NGF treatment (Fig. 4B). Pretreatment of PC12 cells with wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, blocked the NGF-induced activation of LIMK1 but not of LIMK2 (Fig. 4C, 4D). In contrast, Y-27632, a specific inhibitor of ROCK, had no apparent effect on NGF-induced LIMK1 or LIMK2 activation (Fig. 4, C and D). LIMK1 and LIMK2 Are Critical for NGF-induced Neurite Extension from PC12 Cells—To examine whether LIMK1 and LIMK2 contribute to NGF-induced neurite extension from PC12 cells, we introduced siRNA plasmids targeting rat LIMK1 and LIMK2 into the cells, which suppressed the expression of endogenous LIMK1 and LIMK2, respectively (Fig. 5A). The kinase activity of LIMK1 and LIMK2 in cells expressing the corresponding siRNA also decreased, according to the decrease in their expression levels (supplemental Fig. S2). Knockdown of LIMK1, LIMK2, or both significantly reduced the number of neurite-bearing cells and the mean neurite length, compared with control cells (Fig. 5, B-D). LIMK2 knockdown suppressed neurite extension more prominently than LIMK1 knockdown. Similar results were obtained by using another set of siRNAs for rat LIMK1 and LIMK2 (supplemental Fig. S3). These results suggest that both LIMK1 and LIMK2 are critical for NGF-induced neurite extension of PC12 cells. We also analyzed the P-cofilin/P-ADF levels in unstimulated PC12 cells expressing LIMK1/LIMK2 siRNAs. The P-cofilin/P-ADF levels reduced in cells expressing LIMK2 or LIMK1/LIMK2 double knockdown cells but not LIMK1 knockdown cells (supplemental Fig. S4), which suggests that LIMK2, but not LIMK1, is mainly involved in maintenance of the P-cofilin/P-ADF levels in unstimulated PC12 cells. LIMK1 and LIMK2 Are Critical for the Growth Cone Extension and Motility of Chick DRG Neurons—To assess the roles of LIMK1 and LIMK2 in the growth cone extension and motility of neurons in primary culture, we used time-lapse fluorescence microscopy to analyze the effects of LIMK1 and LIMK2 knock-down on the growth cone movement of chick DRG neurons. When cotransfected into CHO cells, the siRNA plasmids targeting chLIMK1 and chLIMK2 strongly silenced the expression of Myc-chLIMK1 and Myc-chLIMK2, respectively (Fig. 6A). To analyze the growth cone motility, chick DRG neurons were cotransfected with YFP plasmids and siRNA plasmids for chLIMK1 or chLIMK2 using Nucleofector II, cultured them for 48 h, replated the neurons in laminin-coated dishes, and further cultured them for 12 h before time-lapse observation. NGF was always included in the culture medium. Representative live images of growth cones are shown in Fig. 6B. Time-lapse observations revealed that single knockdown of LIMK1 or LIMK2, or double knockdown of LIMK1/LIMK2, markedly decreased the rate of growth cone extension, compared with the rate in DRG neurons transfected with a control siRNA (Fig. 6B). To quantitate the data, we measured the distance that the center of the growth cone migrated during 10 min of recording. The average rate of neurite extension of the neurons expressing LIMK1, LIMK2, and LIMK1/LIMK2 si"

In this study we have investigated the interaction of HIV-1 integrase (IN) with several host nuclear import factors using co-immunoprecipitation assays. Our results indicate that IN interacts specifically with host importin 7 (Imp7) in vivo, but does not interact with importin 8 (Imp8) or importin α (Rch1). In contrast, another HIV-1 karyophilic protein MAp17, which is capable of binding Rch1, fails to interact with Imp7, suggesting that IN and Map17 may interact with different cellular pathways during HIV-1 replication. Genetic analysis revealed that the C-terminal domain of IN is the region responsible for interaction between IN with Imp7, and an IN mutant (K240A,K244A/R263A,K264A) disrupted the Imp7 binding ability of the protein, indicating that both regions (235WKGPAKLLWKG and 262RRKAK) within the C-terminal domain of IN are required for efficient IN/Imp7 interaction. Using a vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein pseudotyped HIV single-cycle replication system, we showed that the IN/Imp7 interaction-deficient mutant was unable to mediate viral replication and displayed impairment at both viral reverse transcription and nuclear import steps. Moreover, transient knockdown of Imp7 in both HIV-1 producing and target cells resulted in a 2.5–3.5-fold inhibition of HIV infection. Altogether, our results indicate that HIV-1 IN specifically interacts with Imp7, and this viral/cellular protein interaction contributes to efficient HIV-1 infection.

The interaction between cellular proteins and viral components takes place during various steps of the HIV-1 life cycle, including viral DNA nuclear import. The most striking feature of HIV-1 is its ability to replicate in non-dividing cells. This feature depends on the ability of the virus to transport its cDNA, as part of a large preintegration complex (PIC), from the cytoplasm to the nucleus by an active and energy-dependent process (1Weinberg J.B. Matthews T.J. Cullen B.R. Malim M.H. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1477-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 2Vodicka M.A. Somat. Cell Mol.

However, the mechanism by which the PIC translocates across the nuclear membrane into the nucleus of non-dividing cells is still not fully understood. It has been shown that three HIV-1 PIC-associated proteins including MAp17, IN, and Vpr possess karyophilic properties, and contribute to nuclear translocation of viral PICs. This action is accomplished through their interactions with karyophilic cellular proteins, thereby directing the PIC through the nuclear pore complex (4Bukrinsky M. Haggerty S. Dempsey M.P.

In addition, a cis-acting element named the central DNA flap, which is located in the 3′ region of the pol gene sequence, was also shown to contribute to HIV-1 nuclear import in both dividing and non-dividing cells (11Sirven A.

The importin α/β heterodimer meditates nuclear import of proteins harboring a classical nuclear localization signal, which either contains a cluster of basic amino acids or two basic clusters separated by 10–20 amino acids (bipartite nuclear localization signal) (for reviews see Refs. 15Gorlich D.

Similarly, transportin, an Impβ-related receptor, imports its substrates (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins) by directly binding to the glycine-rich M9 domain of the protein (22Pollard V.W.

Cullen B.R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the similarity to Impβ, several other nuclear import factors, including Imp7 and Imp8, have also been identified (24Gorlich D. Dabrowski M. Bischoff F.R. Kutay U. Bork P. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Izaurralde E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 65-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Imp7 is one of several cellular importins that bind to and mediate nuclear import of ribosomal proteins in mammalian cells, and it was also found to translocate other proteins, such as glucocorticoid receptor and histone H1 into the nucleus (18Jakel S. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4491-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 25Bauerle M. Doenecke D. Albig W. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In the case of histone H1, Jakel et al. (27Jakel S. Albig W. Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Schwamborn K. Doenecke D. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that two receptors, Impβ and Imp7, form a heterodimer, and this complex is the functional unit required for nuclear import of histone H1. Imp8 also contributes to the nuclear import of signal recognition particle protein 19 (28Dean K.A. von Ahsen O. Gorlich D. Fried H.M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3479-3485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, whether and how these cellular proteins contribute to the nuclear import of HIV-1 PIC during the early stage of viral replication remains undefined. HIV-1 integrase (IN) is a 32-kDa protein that plays a key role in viral cDNA integration into the host chromosome. In addition, this viral protein has also been shown to contribute to other steps during the early stage of viral replication, including reverse transcription (29Wu X. Liu H. Xiao H. Conway J.A.

Disord. 2001; 1: 133-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the mechanism by which HIV-1 IN contributes to nuclear import of the viral PIC is still not fully understood. Some previous studies have showed that IN is capable of binding to Impα in in vitro binding assays (7Gallay P. Hope T. Chin D. Trono D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9825-9830Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 36Armon-Omer A. Graessmann A. Loyter A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 1117-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 37Hearps A.C. Jans D.A. Biochem. J. 2006; 398: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), but the in vitro nuclear import assay results concerning whether Impα plays a role in the nuclear translocation of IN and/or HIV-1 DNA, is still controversial (33Depienne C.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3675-3685Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). A cellular component, human lens epithelium-derived growth factor/transcription coactivator p75 (LEDGF/p75), was initially implicated in contributing to the nuclear translocation of HIV-1 (39Llano M.

However, the following study came to the conclusion that the interaction of IN with LEDGF/p75 may not be required for IN nuclear localization (41Emiliani S. Mousnier A. Busschots K. Maroun M. Van Maele B. Tempe D. Vandekerckhove L. Moisant F. Ben-Slama L. Witvrouw M. Christ F. Rain J.C. Dargemont C. Debyser Z. Benarous R. J. Biol.

Several studies have further identified that LEDGF/p75 is important for tethering IN as well as the viral PIC to chromosomal DNA, and contributes to controlling the location of HIV DNA integration (41Emiliani S. Mousnier A. Busschots K. Maroun M. Van Maele B. Tempe D. Vandekerckhove L. Moisant F. Ben-Slama L. Witvrouw M. Christ F. Rain J.C. Dargemont C. Debyser Z. Benarous R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 17841-17847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In attempts to search for other cellular factor(s) involved in HIV-1 nuclear import, Fassati et al. (38Fassati A. Gorlich D. Harrison I. Zaytseva L. Mingot J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3675-3685Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) have reported that Imp7 contributes to HIV-1 PIC nuclear import by using in vitro nuclear import assays. Their study also showed that small interfering RNA (siRNA) mediated Imp7-knockdown inhibited HIV-1 replication (38Fassati A. Gorlich D. Harrison I. Zaytseva L. Mingot J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3675-3685Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In addition, their in vitro binding assay showed that recombinant IN could pull down several cellular nuclear import receptors including Impα, Impβ, Imp7, and transportin from HeLa cell lysates, suggesting that the action of Imp7 in HIV-1 PIC nuclear import may be through its binding to HIV-1 IN (supplementary materials in Ref. 38Fassati A. Gorlich D. Harrison I. Zaytseva L. Mingot J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3675-3685Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, a recent study by Zielske and Stevensen (44Zielske S.P. Stevenson M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 11541-11546Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) did not reveal the impact of Imp7 knockdown on HIV-1 and SIV nuclear import in macrophages. Therefore, the functional role of Imp7 during HIV-1 replication remains to be defined. In this study, we have investigated the interaction of HIV-1 IN with several cellular importins by using a cell-based co-immunoprecipitation assay. Our results indicate that HIV-1 IN specifically interacts with Imp7, but not with Impα (Rch1) or Imp8, and this IN/Imp7 interaction takes place in HIV-1-infected T cells. We also showed that another HIV-1 karyophilic protein MAp17, which is capable of binding Rch1, was unable to interact with Imp7. Our mutagenic analysis demonstrated that two regions (235WKGPAKLLWKG and 262RRKAK) in the C-terminal domain of IN are critical for its Imp7 binding ability. To further elucidate the contribution of the IN/Imp7 interaction to HIV-1 replication, we have shown that an Imp7-binding defective IN mutant virus lost infectivity and displayed defects during both reverse transcription and nuclear import. Moreover, our experiments revealed that HIV-1 produced from Imp7-depleted cells, exhibited a 2.5–3.5-fold reduced infection in Imp7-knockdown susceptible cells. Construction of Different Viral and Cellular Protein Expressors—To generate a CMV-YFP-IN fusion expressor, the full-length wild-type HIV-1 IN cDNA was amplified from HIV-1 HxBru provirus (45Yao X.J. Subbramanian R.A. Rougeau N. Boisvert F. Bergeron D. Cohen E.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by PCR using a 5′-BglII primer (5′-GCCAGATCTTTCTTAGATGGAATAGATAAG-3′) and a 3′-BamHI primer (5′-CTAAACGGATCCATGTTCTAA-3′). The amplified HIV-1 IN fragment was cloned in-frame at the 3′ end of the EYFP cDNA in a pEYFP-C1 vector (Clontech). The CMV-IN-YFP and CMV-IN50–288-YFP expressors used in the study were previously described (32Ao Z. Fowke K.R. Cohen E.A. Yao X. Retrovirology. 2005; 2: 62Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To construct different CMV-YFP-IN deletion mutants, cDNA fragments encoding amino acids 1–212 and 1–240 of IN were generated using PCR with 5′-BglII and 3′ primers (5-CAATTCCCGGGTTTGTATGTCTGTTTGC-3; 5-CCAGACCCGGGTTGCTGGTCCTTTCCA-3), and was inserted into the pEYFP-C1 vector at BglII and XmaI sites. Different IN substitution mutants were generated by a two-step PCR-based method (46Yao X.J. Kobinger G. Dandache S. Rougeau N. Cohen E. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 1590-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), using a 5′-BglII primer, 3′-XhoI primer, and complementary primers containing the desired mutations. The amplified IN cDNAs harboring specific mutations were then cloned into pEYFP-C1 vector. To generate HIV-1 provirus NL4.3-BruΔBgl/Luc, the sequence from the ApaI to SalI site (nucleotides 1556–5329, +1 = start of NL4.3 initiation of transcription) in a RT/IN/Env defective HIV-1 provirus NLlucΔBgl/ΔRI (32Ao Z. Fowke K.R. Cohen E.A. Yao X. Retrovirology. 2005; 2: 62Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was replaced by the corresponding sequences of HIV-1 provirus HxBru (45Yao X.J. Subbramanian R.A. Rougeau N. Boisvert F. Bergeron D. Cohen E.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The genotype of this molecular clone is the 5′ long terminal repeat gag+ pol+ vif+ vpr+ tat+ rev+ vpu+ env– nef– 3′ long terminal repeat. To construct provirus HxBru containing a HA tag at the C terminus of IN, a DNA sequence encoding amino acid YPYDVPDYASLG was inserted at the 3′ end of IN encoding sequence by a two-step PCR method, in a natural ApaI/SalI fragment derived from HxBru (13Ao Z. Yao X. Cohen E.A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 3170-3177Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Then, this PCR-generated ApaI/SalI fragment was then inserted back to the provirus HxBru and the constructed provirus was named HxBru-IN-HA. The pGEX-Imp7 and pGEX-Imp8 plasmids encoding for Xenopus Imp7 and human Imp8 cDNAs were generously provided by Dr. Yamamoto (26Freedman N.D. Yamamoto K.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2276-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and used as PCR templates for constructing CMV-T7-Imp7 and CMV-T7-Imp8 plasmids. The cDNA encoding Rch-1 was amplified from pET-21-Rch1. The amplified Imp7, Imp8, and Rch-1 fragments were digested with BamHI and NotI and cloned at the 3′ end of a T7 tag in an SVCMV-T7 vector. The MAp17G2A cDNA was generated by PCR from HIV-1 provirus HxBru using primers (5′ primer, 5-ATAGCTAGCGAGATGGCTGCGAGA-3 and 3′ primer, 5-CTGCGGATCCGGGTAATTTTGGCTGAC-3) with the second amino acid glycine changed to alanine. The CMV-MAG2A-YFP was constructed by inserting HIV-1 MAG2A cDNA in-frame at the 5′ of the YFP cDNA, in the CMV-YFP-N1 plasmid (Clontech). All newly constructed expressing plasmids were subsequently analyzed by DNA sequencing to confirm the sequence, and the presence of mutations and/or deletions. Antibodies and Chemicals—Antibodies used in immunoprecipitation or Western blot are as follows. The purified rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal antibody and mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes Inc. The mouse anti-T7 antibody was obtained from Novagen Inc. (Darmstsdt, Germany). The rabbit anti-human Imp7 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. A. Fassati (38Fassati A. Gorlich D. Harrison I. Zaytseva L. Mingot J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3675-3685Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The rabbit anti-IN antibodies (catalog number 757) and the purified recombinant HIV-1NL4.3 IN protein (catalog number 9420) were obtained through the AIDS Research Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health. The human anti-HIV serum, mouse anti-HA, and anti-Myc antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. Eric A. Cohen. The ECL™ horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG, and the sheep anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The Western blot detection ECL kit was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Science (Boston, MA). CHAPS was purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney 293T cells and HeLa-β-gal-CD4/CCR5 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. The CD4+ C8166 T cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. DNA transfection in 293T cells was performed with a standard calcium phosphate DNA precipitation method. After 48 h of transfection, cells were harvested and ready for different experiments. IN/Imp7 Binding Assays Using Immunoprecipitation (IP) and Western Blot—To test protein expression and the protein/protein interaction in mammalian cells, 293T cells were transfected or co-transfected with corresponding protein expression plasmids. After 48 h of transfection, cells were lysed with CHAPS lysis buffer (199 medium containing 0.5% CHAPS and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche)) on ice for 30 min, and clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Then, the supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation with rabbit anti-GFP or the corresponding antibody. Immunoprecipitants were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot using mouse anti-T7 or mouse anti-GFP antibodies, respectively. Also, the total T7-tagged protein expression in cell lysates was sequentially immunoprecipitated with mouse anti-T7 antibody, followed by Western blot using the same antibody. To test the interaction of HIV-1 IN with endogenous Imp7, 293T cells were mock-transfected, YFP transfected or transfected with IN-YFP expression plasmids, and the same IP and Western blot protocols were used as described above, except using rabbit anti-Imp7 antibody to check the bound endogenous Imp7. Meanwhile, non-transfected 293T cell lysate was loaded directly in SDS-PAGE as a positive control. To test the IN/Imp7 interaction in HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells, the CD4+ C8166 cells were infected with HIV-1 (vIN-HA), which was produced in 293T cells transfected with provirus HxBru-IN-HA. After 48–72 h post-infection, C8166 cells were lysed with 0.5% CHAPS lysis buffer and IP with anti-HA antibody. Immunoprecipitants were then resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot using anti-Imp7 antibody for detecting bound Imp7. In parallel, the normal C8166 T cell lysate was loaded directly in SDS-PAGE as positive control. Meanwhile, the IN-HA expression was detected with rabbit anti-IN antibody. In Vitro Binding Studies—To produce GST and GST-Imp7 proteins, Escherichia coli BL21 cells transformed with pGEX-4T-GST or pGEX-4T-GST-Imp7 plasmids were cultured in LB medium (0.1 mg/ml ampicillin). Protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) for 3 h at 37°C. Bacteria were harvested, and suspended in 35 ml of ice-cold column buffer, and broken by sonication (five 30-s pulses at 100 watts, Sonics & Materials, Inc.). The resulting lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 13,000 × g, and passed through a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences). After being washed by column buffer, the bound GST and GST-Imp7 proteins were eluted by glutathione buffer (100 mm reduced gluthathione (Roche), 120 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5). Finally, the eluted protein was dialyzed in phosphate-buffered saline to remove glutathione. For in vitro binding experiments, equal amounts of recombinant GST or GST-Imp7 protein were incubated with a recombinant HIV-1 IN in 199 medium containing 0.1% CHAPS, for 2 h at 4 °C. Then, 100 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were added and incubated for an additional hour. The beads were washed and the bound proteins were eluted with 50 mm glutathione, and loaded onto a 12.5% SDS-PAGE for Western blot analysis with rabbit anti-IN antibodies. Transient Knockdown of Imp7 in 293T and HeLa-β-Gal-CD4/CCR5 Cells—293T cells and HeLa-β-Gal-CD4/CCR5 cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates, and transfected the next day with 100 pmol of Imp7-specific siRNA duplex (IPO7-HSS116173) with Lipofectamine™ RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen). After 18 h of the first transfection, another Imp7 siRNA duplex (IPO7-HSS116174) was transfected again into the cells. These two Imp7-siRNA duplexes (Stealth RNAi), IPO7-HSS116173 and IPO7-HSS116174, were synthesized by Invitrogen Inc. The targeting sequences correspond to Imp7 mRNA nucleotides 1990–2013 (5′-UAAGCAGAUUCCCUCAAGCUGUUGG-3′), and to Imp7 mRNA nucleotides 610–633 (sense 5′-AAUGCUGCAUUGCUGGCUACCAAUGG-3′). In parallel, transfection of scramble (sc) RNA (purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as control. After 48 and 72 h of transfection, cells were used for different HIV-1 provirus transfection and viral infections, respectively. Virus Production and Infection—To test the effect of the Imp7-binding defective mutant on HIV replication, a vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G) glycoprotein pseudotyped single-cycle replicating virus was produced in 293T cells, as described previously (32Ao Z. Fowke K.R. Cohen E.A. Yao X. Retrovirology. 2005; 2: 62Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells were transfected with an RT/IN/Env-deleted HIV-1 provirus NLlucΔBglΔRI, each CMV-Vpr-RT-IN (wt/mutant) expressor and a VSV-G expressor. Introduction of IN mutations into the CMV-Vpr-RT-IN expressor was done through a PCR-based method as described previously (32Ao Z. Fowke K.R. Cohen E.A. Yao X. Retrovirology. 2005; 2: 62Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To produce viruses from Imp7-siRNA- or scRNA-transfected cells, the same amount of cells were transfected with Imp7 siRNA or scRNA twice (at 0 and 18 h), and after 36 h of the first transfection cells were re-plated. After an additional 12 h, cells were transfected with different HIV-1 proviruses. After 48 h of provirus transfection, virus was collected and concentrated from the supernatant using ultracentrifugation. Virus titers were quantified using HIV-1 p24 Antigen Capture Assay Kit (purchased from the NCI-Frederick AIDS Vaccine Program). To infect CD4+ T cells, equal amounts of virus (adjusted by virion-associated p24 level) were incubated with C8166 T cells at 37 °C for 4 h. At different time points post-infection, 1 × 106 cells from each sample were collected, and lysed with 50 μl of luciferase lysis buffer (Fisher Scientific Inc). 10 μl of cell lysate was subjected to the luciferase assay by using a TopCount®NXT™ Microplate Scintillation & Luminescence Counter (Packard, Meriden), and the luciferase activity is valued as relative luciferase units. Each sample was analyzed in duplicate, and the average deviation was calculated. To test the effect of Imp7 knockdown on HIV-1 infection, at 72 h after being transfected with Imp7-siRNA or scRNA, HeLa-β-Gal-CD4/CCR5 cells were infected with equal amounts of different viruses in the presence of DEAE-dextran (20 μg/ml). At 48 h post-infection, HIV-1 infection was monitored by measurement of the luciferase activity level and/or the amount of β-galactosidase positive cells, as described previously (47Kimpton J. Emerman M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2232-2239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HIV-1 Reverse Transcribed and Nuclear Imported DNA Detection by PCR and Southern Blotting—C8166 T cells were infected with equal amounts of the VSV-G pseudotyped IN wt or mutant viruses for 2 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and cultured in RPMI medium.

https://openalex.org/W1994655859,"A central question about the brain is how information is processed by large populations of neurons embedded in intricate local networks. Answering this question requires not only monitoring functional dynamics of many neurons simultaneously, but also interpreting such activity patterns in the context of neuronal circuitry. Here, we introduce a versatile approach for loading Ca(2+) indicators in vivo by local electroporation. With this method, Ca(2+) imaging can be performed both at neuron population level and with exquisite subcellular resolution down to dendritic spines and axon boutons. This enabled mitral cell odor-evoked ensemble activity to be analyzed simultaneously with revealing their specific connectivity to different glomeruli. Colabeling of Purkinje cell dendrites and intersecting parallel fibers allowed Ca(2+) imaging of both presynaptic boutons and postsynaptic dendrites. This approach thus provides an unprecedented capability for in vivo visualizing active cell ensembles and tracing their underlying local neuronal circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2039321926,"L-glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the human brain, activates a family of ligand-gated ion channels, the major subtypes of which are named AMPA, kainate, and NMDA receptors. In common with many signal transduction proteins, glutamate receptors are modulated by ions and small molecules, including Ca2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, protons, polyamines, and steroids. Strikingly, the activation of kainate receptors by glutamate requires the presence of both Na+ and Cl− in the extracellular solution, and in the absence of these ions, receptor activity is abolished. Here, we identify the site and mechanism of action of anions. Surprisingly, we find that Cl− ions are essential structural components of kainate receptors. Cl− ions bind in a cavity formed at the interface between subunits in a dimer pair. In the absence of Cl−, dimer stability is reduced, the rate of desensitization increases, and the fraction of receptors competent for activation by glutamate drops precipitously."
https://openalex.org/W1980217666,"A recent study has shown that pure neural stem cells can be derived from embryonic stem (ES) cells and primary brain tissue. In the presence of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), this population can be continuously expanded in adherent conditions. In analogy to continuously self-renewing ES cells, these cells were termed 'NS' cells (Conti et al., PLoS Biol 3: e283, 2005). While NS cells have been shown to readily generate neurons and astrocytes, their differentiation into oligodendrocytes has remained enigmatic, raising concerns as to whether they truly represent tripotential neural stem cells.Here we provide evidence that NS cells are indeed tripotent. Upon proliferation with FGF2, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and forskolin, followed by differentiation in the presence of thyroid hormone (T3) and ascorbic acid NS cells efficiently generate oligodendrocytes ( approximately 20%) alongside astrocytes ( approximately 40%) and neurons ( approximately 10%). Mature oligodendroglial differentiation was confirmed by transplantation data showing that NS cell-derived oligodendrocytes ensheath host axons in the brain of myelin-deficient rats.In addition to delineating NS cells as a potential donor source for myelin repair, our data strongly support the view that these adherently expandable cells represent bona fide tripotential neural stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2053449782,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been identified in hematopoietic and solid tumors. However, their precursors-namely, precancerous stem cells (pCSCs) -have not been characterized. Here we experimentally define the pCSCs that have the potential for both benign and malignant differentiation, depending on environmental cues. While clonal pCSCs can develop into various types of tissue cells in immunocompetent mice without developing into cancer, they often develop, however, into leukemic or solid cancers composed of various types of cancer cells in immunodeficient mice. The progress of the pCSCs to cancers is associated with the up-regulation of c-kit and Sca-1, as well as with lineage markers. Mechanistically, the pCSCs are regulated by the PIWI/AGO family gene called piwil2. Our results provide clear evidence that a single clone of pCSCs has the potential for both benign and malignant differentiation, depending on the environmental cues. We anticipate pCSCs to be a novel target for the early detection, prevention, and therapy of cancers."

We expressed both His402 and Tyr402 variants of CCP7, CCP7,8, and CCP6-8. We determined structures of His402 and Tyr402 CCP7 and showed them to be nearly identical. The side chains of His/Tyr402 have similar, solvent-exposed orientations far from interfaces with CCP6 and -8. Tyr402 CCP7 bound significantly more tightly than His402 CCP7 to a heparin affinity column as well as to defined-length sulfated heparin oligosaccharides employed in gel mobility shift assays. This observation is consistent with the position of the 402 side chain on the edge of one of two glycosaminoglycan-binding surface patches on CCP7 that we inferred on the basis of chemical shift perturbation studies with a sulfated heparin tetrasaccharide. According to surface plasmon resonance measurements, Tyr402 CCP6-8 binds significantly more tightly than His402 CCP6-8 to immobilized C-reactive protein. The data support a causal link between H402Y and age-related macular degeneration in which variation at position 402 modulates the response of factor H to age-related changes in the glycosaminoglycan composition and apoptotic activity of the macula.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7053-7054Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The densely packed photoreceptors in the macula are maintained by the underlying retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (2Provis J.M. Penfold P.L. Cornish E.E. Sandercoe T.M. Madigan M.C. Clin. Exp. Optom. 2005; 88: 269-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). A unique pentalaminar extracellular matrix (ECM), the Brüch's membrane, separates the RPE from the fenestrated endothelium of the choroidal vasculature. In early AMD, fatty deposits, called drusen, appear between Brüch's membrane and the RPE (3Johnson L.V. Leitner W.P. Staples M.K. Anderson D.H. Exp. Eye Res. 2001; 73: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Early AMD may progress to severe forms (4Nowak J.Z. Pharmacol. Rep. 2006; 58: 353-363PubMed Google Scholar), characterized by RPE-cell death and atrophy of the photoreceptor layer, or choroidal neovascularization. Drusen are rich in cell breakdown products and proteins of the complement system (5Mullins R.F. Russell S.R. Anderson D.H. Hageman G.S.

A. 2006; 103: 2328-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), strengthening further the evidence for an AMD-complement link. The at-risk allele that has received most attention, in CFH exon 9 (rs1061170; 1277T > C), encodes a His rather than a Tyr at position 402 (residue 384 of the mature fH) and is present in ∼35% of individuals of European descent. Homozygous individuals have a 6-fold increased risk of developing AMD, whereas heterozygotes are 2.5 times more susceptible (14Thakkinstian A. Han P. McEvoy M. Smith W. Hoh J. Magnusson K. Zhang K. Attia J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 2784-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Doubts over a causal link between the H402Y variation and the etiology of AMD have been raised by the identification of 20 synonymous or intronic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a 123-kb region overlapping CFH that are even more strongly associated with AMD (15Li M. Atmaca-Sonmez P. Othman M. Branham K.E. Khanna R. Wade M.S. Li Y. Liang L. Zareparsi S. Swaroop A. Abecasis G.R. Nat.

Genet. 2006; 38: 1055-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Moreover, variations in genes encoding complement factor 2 (C2) and complement factor B (BF) also strongly influence risk, as does an SNP in a gene, LOC387715, of unknown function (16Maller J. George S. Purcell S. Fagerness J. Altshuler D. Daly M.J. Seddon J.M. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 1055-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 17Gold B. Merriam J.E. Zernant J. Hancox L.S.

Hageman J. Stockman H. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 458-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Other risk factors for AMD include smoking, diet, obesity, and underlying vascular disease (18Seddon J.M. George S. Rosner B. Klein M.L. Hum. Hered. 2006; 61: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Detailed investigations of the structural and functional consequences of the Tyr402 variation in fH are thus required to shed light on the putative role of H402Y in the etiology of AMD. Factor H is a plasma glycoprotein (155 kDa, 500-800 μg/ml) (19Sim R.B. DiScipio R.G. Biochem. J. 1982; 205: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) that controls the alternative pathway (AP) of complement activation (20Pangburn M.K. Immunopharmacology. 2000; 49: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The AP operates at “tick over” level on any surface, self or foreign, but is normally amplified exclusively on foreign surfaces, thanks in part to the selective action of fH. Factor H recognizes and binds to self-surfaces via sialic acid and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains of proteogylycans (21Meri S. Pangburn M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3982-3986Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), whereupon its complement-regulating properties are enhanced (20Pangburn M.K. Immunopharmacology. 2000; 49: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Factor H destroys the surface-deposited convertases, which are made up from fragments of C3 and factor B, that drive the amplification loop within the AP. Self-cells carry additional, membrane-bound, regulators of the AP. Consequently, fH is particularly important for protecting self-surfaces not enclosed by a cell membrane. Factor H consists of 20 tandem complement control protein modules (CCPs) (22Ripoche J. Day A.J. Willis A.C. Belt K.T. Campbell R.D. Sim R.B. Biosci. Rep. 1986; 6: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The AMD-linked His/Tyr402 variation is in CCP7, which contributes to one of two putative sites that bind C-reactive protein (CRP) (23Gershov D. Kim S. Brot N. Elkon K.B. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1353-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 24Giannakis E. Male D.A. Ormsby R.J. Mold C. Jokiranta T.S. Ranganathan S. Gordon D.L. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2001; 1: 433-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and to one of at least three GAG-binding modules in fH (25Blackmore T.K. Sadlon T.A. Ward H.M. Lublin D.M. Gordon D.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5422-5427PubMed Google Scholar). Module 7 therefore potentially participates in the ability of fH to selectively act upon convertases formed on self-surfaces. Indeed, a recent report (26Skerka C. Lauer N. Weinberger A.A.W.A. Keilhauser C.N. Sühnel J. Smith R. Schlotzer-Schrehardt U. Fritsche L. Heinen S. Hartmann A. Weber B.H.F. Zipfel P.F. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 509-514Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar) indicated that His402 fH binds less strongly to retinal epithelial cell surfaces than Tyr402 fH. However, the specificities and the relative affinities of the various GAG-binding sites of fH have not yet been established. Each of the three (or four) sites may contribute in a combinatorial fashion to the capacity of factor H to recognize host surfaces (20Pangburn M.K. Immunopharmacology. 2000; 49: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), depending on the tissue context and the circumstances. In vitro assays cannot emulate accurately physiological conditions, making it difficult to test hypotheses concerning differential GAG binding specificities of the His402 and Tyr402 allotypes of factor H. For example, when such studies are performed using intact fH, the GAG recognition sites may compete or cooperate in an artifactual manner, and these problems are compounded by the fact that most GAG preparations are heterogeneous. A recent study (27Clark S.J. Higman V.A. Mulloy B. Perkins S.J. Lea S.M. Sim R.B. Day A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24713-24720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) intriguingly reported differential GAG binding by His402 and Tyr402 versions of a recombinantly expressed fragment of fH consisting of CCPs 6, 7 and 8 (i.e. CCP6-8). In the current atomic resolution study of the H402Y polymorphism, we too chose to focus primarily on CCP7 and its neighboring modules. Adopting a structural approach, we characterized the interaction of this site with chemically defined GAGs. We show that a causal link between His402 fH and disease is feasible. Residue 402 occupies a critical position on a face of CCP7 that recognizes GAGs. Variation at this position will modulate the ability to distinguish between GAGs according to type and density of sulfation. The overlapping binding site for CRP is also affected. Isolation of His402 and Tyr402 Allotypic Variants of Human Factor H—Factor H was purified as described (28Pangburn M.K. Schreiber R.D. Muller-Eberhard H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1977; 146: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) from normal human plasma (Stewart Regional Blood Bank, Tyler, TX) of different individuals homozygous at the 402 position. The His402 and Tyr402 allotypic variants of the pure factor H were confirmed by mass spectrometry following purification. Expression of Protein and NMR—DNA sequences for the following segments of fH (numbered according to full-length protein, i.e. before removal of secretion signal) were cloned into the Pichia pastoris expression vector pPICZα: residues 386-444 (CCP7), 386-507 (CCP7,8), and 321-507 (CCP6-8). In each case, DNA encoding both Tyr and His at position 402 was prepared. Expressed proteins were directed to the secretory pathway by placing the coding sequence behind the Saccharomyces cerevisiae α-factor secretion sequence. Following transformation into P. pastoris strain KM71H, proteins were expressed in a fermentor. Where appropriate, proteins were isotopically labeled in batches of 0.8 liters (initial volume) of cell culture as described (29Herbert A.P. Uhrin D. Lyon M. Pangburn M.K. Barlow P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16512-16520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cation exchange chromatography was used to purify all the proteins. Identity of the purified Tyr402 and His402 CCP7 proteins was confirmed using mass spectrometry. Yields were in the region of 1 mg of pure protein/g of wet cells. NMR spectra were acquired on Bruker AVANCE 600- and 800-MHz spectrometers using 5-mm probes. Data for resonance assignments were acquired at 298 K on a 0.9 mm sample of 13C,15N CCP7 in 20 mm sodium acetate, at pH 5.2. 15N-Edited and 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC experiments were acquired with mixing times of 150 ms.

The His402 CCP7 eluted at a lower salt concentration than Tyr402 CCP7. Subsequently the two variants of the single modules were combined prior to resolving them on the heparin column. Oligosaccharides were prepared from low molecular weight heparin (37Goger B. Halden Y. Rek A. Mosl R. Pye D. Gallagher J. Kungl A.J.

Briefly, 2-aminoacridone-tagged oligosaccharides were combined with either Tyr402 or His402 CCP7 (at concentrations indicated in Figs. 1b and 2, a and c) in a total volume of 10 μl of PBS containing 25% (v/v) glycerol for 15 min (room temperature). Samples were then loaded on a 1% agarose gel in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA. Electrophoresis was performed (200 V, 8-15 min) in a horizontal agarose electrophoresis system, using an electrophoresis buffer comprising 40 mm Tris/acetic acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0.

Ligand preconcentration prior to immobilization was performed using 25 μg·ml-1 CRP in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5. The analysis was performed at 25 °C using 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% surfactant P20, pH 7.4, as running buffer. Surface consistency and regeneration efficiency tests were performed using 32 μm Tyr402 CCP6-8 and indicated that the surface was stable and regeneration was effective (data not shown). Locating the Polyanion Binding Site by Chemical Shift Mapping—Initially, 15N-1H HSQC spectra were acquired (600 MHz, cryogenic probe) on 15N-labeled CCP7 samples (20 μm in 20 mm sodium acetate (deuterated), pH 5.0, 25 °C) in the presence of 0-40 μm fully sulfated, heparin-derived tetrasaccharide (purified from a mixed tetrasaccharide fraction by strong anion-exchange high-pressure liquid chromatography and characterized by disaccharide analysis). The titration was repeated at pH 7.4 (20 mm potassium phosphate) plus 140 mm sodium chloride, and again at pH 7.4 (20 mm potassium phosphate, no additional salt) with 0-160 μm tetrasaccharide (saturation not reached). Spectra of the complex were assignable due to incremental movement of cross-peaks during the titration. The polyanion-binding site was inferred on the basis of amide 15N and 1H resonances that exhibited the largest heparin-induced combined chemical shift perturbation (CSP) (40Sue S.C. Chen J.Y. Lee S.C. Wu W.G. Huang T.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 1365-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Homing in on Module 7—The His and Tyr allotypic variants of factor H show indistinguishable affinity for a heparin column (Fig. 1a). To achieve a comparison of affinities for more structurally defined GAG ligands, we used the GMSA (39Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Lietha D. Gherardi E. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43560-43567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) to explore binding to size-fractionated heparin oligosaccharides. In this assay, the extent of binding of a fluorescently tagged oligosaccharide is judged by the proportional retardation of its normal migration toward the anode. As measured by GMSA, the two variants of full-length human factor H bind equally well to chemically pure, fully sulfated heparin-derived dodecasaccharide (Fig. 1b). A similar result was obtained for a tetrasaccharide (not shown). Because factor H contains multiple GAG-binding sites that may compete or cooperate in such artificial assays, we adopted a dissection approach. We found that P. pastoris-expressed factor H fragments corresponding to modules 6-8 (CCP6-8), with either His or Tyr at position 402, also bound equally well both to a heparin column (not shown) and to a panel of chemically pure, defined-size, fully sulfated heparin fragments (Fig. 2a). We noted, however, that in previous work, Clark et al. (27Clark S.J. Higman V.A. Mulloy B. Perkins S.J. Lea S.M. Sim R.B. Day A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24713-24720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) had shown that E. coli-expressed Tyr402 and His402 CCP6-8 exhibited differential binding to various GAG preparations. To explore this issue further, we tested the His402 and Tyr402 variants of isolated CCP7 (expressed in P. pastoris). Strikingly, the two variants of single-module CCP7 were base line-resolved on a heparin affinity column (pH 7.4) (Fig. 2b). Irrespective of oligosaccharide length, Tyr402 CCP7 retards a higher proportion of heparin than His402 CCP7 according to a GMSA (Fig. 2a). The effect is more pronounced with smaller oligosaccharides and particularly obvious for the di- and tetrasaccharide. A dose-response version of the GMSA, conducted using a fixed amount of the tetrasaccharide (Fig. 2c), reinforced this result. Since the Tyr402 version of CCP7 binds more strongly than the His402 version, this appeared not to be merely a charge-related effect. It also appeared to be GAG-specific, since no such distinction was observed between the variants using a panel of size-fractionated dermatan sulfates in the GMSA (Fig. 2a). Our objective was to focus on the role of disease-linked residue 402. We therefore chose to follow up the clear differences in heparin affinity between variants at the level of the single modules using an atomic resolution structural approach. Module 7 of fH May Be Instructively Studied in Isolation from Its Neighbors—The N and C termini of CCPs lie at opposite ends of their three-dimensional structures, and neighboring CCPs typically adopt an elongated, end-to-end arrangement (41Kirkitadze M.D. Dryden D.T. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Wang X. Krych M. Atkinson J.P. Barlow P.N. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 42Kirkitadze M.D. Barlow P.N. Immunol. Rev. 2001; 180: 146-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Indeed, in fH, just three residues separate CCP6 from CCP7, and steric considerations rule out a side-by-side association. On the other hand, the linker between CCP7 and -8 (five residues) might be long enough to allow CCP8 to fold back alongside CCP7. To assess this possibility, a 1H,15N HSQC spectrum was collected on recombinant Tyr402 CCP7,8 (i.e. the double module) for comparison with the equivalent spectrum of the single module, Tyr402 CCP7 (Fig. 3). Subsequently (following assignment), it was found that the CSPs in CCP7 due to the presence of CCP8 occur only for residues proximal to the CCP7 C terminus. Equivalent results were obtained in the case of His402 CCP7. Thus, the three fH CCPs, CCP6 to -8, must be arranged in an end-to-end, not a side-by-side, fashion, exposing a large surface area of CCP7 for binding to ligands. The structure of CCP7 (see below) further revealed that the Tyr/His402 side chain is located far from either end of the seventh module and is unable to affect intermodular orientations. Therefore, it is reasonable to compare structures of the His/Tyr402 variants of fH by focusing on isolated module CCP7. Structure Determination of Tyr402 and His402 CCP7—The 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the CCP7 variants did not change drastically between pH 5.0 and 7.4 (supplemental Fig. 1), legitimizing structure determination at the experimentally convenient lower pH. There were no significant chemical shift changes in HSQC spectra over the range 20-600 μm CCP7 and no nuclear Overhauser effects symptomatic of nontransient self-association, and line widths were inconsistent with oligomerization in the 600 μm NMR samples. Therefore, CCP7 is predominantly monomeric under the conditions used for structure calculations. Nearly complete assignment of nuclei in Tyr402 and His402 CCP7 (see Table 1 and supplemental Fig. 2) was achieved. The two nearly identical structures (Fig. 4) resemble previously solved CCP structures (43Norman D.G. Barlow P.N. Baron M. Day A.J. Sim R.B. Campbell I.D. J. Mol.

This face also features His417, Tyr398, and Tyr420 side chains. The arrangement of these and nearby residues is conserved between the two variants so that the only difference between them is localized to position 402. The side chains of Arg404, Lys405, and Lys410 contribute to the main patch of positive charge on CCP7 (Fig. 4c); another positive patch near the module's C terminus arises from Arg444 and Lys446. We next opted to map the binding site on CCP7 for a pure, fully sulfated heparin tetrasaccharide. Locating the Heparin-binding Site on CCP7 Tyr402 and His40"

However, the functional relevance of GITR and its ligand (GITRL) for non-T cells has yet to be fully explored. In addition, recent evidence suggests that GITR plays different roles in mice and humans. We studied the role of GITR-GITRL interaction in human tumor immunology and report for the first time that primary gastrointestinal cancers and tumor cell lines of different histological origin express substantial levels of GITRL. Signaling through GITRL down-regulated the expression of the immunostimulatory molecules CD40 and CD54 and the adhesion molecule EpCAM, and induced production of the immunosuppressive cytokine TGF-beta by tumor cells. On NK cells, GITR is constitutively expressed and up-regulated following activation. Blocking GITR-GITRL interaction in cocultures of tumor cells and NK cells substantially increased cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma production of NK cells demonstrating that constitutive expression of GITRL by tumor cells diminishes NK cell antitumor immunity. GITRL-Ig fusion protein or cell surface-expressed GITRL did not induce apoptosis in NK cells, but diminished nuclear localized c-Rel and RelB, indicating that GITR might negatively modulate NK cell NF-kappaB activity. Taken together, our data indicate that tumor-expressed GITRL mediates immunosubversion in humans."

The molecular mechanisms underlying modulation of self-renewal and differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) under such hypoxic conditions remain to be established.

Kaufman M.H. Nature. 1981; 292: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (6429) Google Scholar). In contrast to human ESCs (hESCs), self-renewal of mESCs can be sustained indefinitely in feeder-free conditions if supplemented with LIF (2Smith A.G. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 385-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). mESC lines can be derived directly from embryos in the presence of LIF, indicating that this factor is specifically required for the maintenance of pluripotency. Intracellular signaling cascades initiated by LIF are mediated through the heterodimerization of LIFR and glycoprotein 130 (gp130). This complex activates Janus-associated tyrosine kinase and the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway. Activation of STAT3 by LIF is crucial in mediating self-renewal signals in mESCs (3Niwa H. Burdon T. Chambers I. Smith A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2048-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar, 4Matsuda T. Nakamura T. Nakao K. Arai T. Katsuki M. Heike T. Yokota T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4261-4269Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). During mammalian development, oxygen needed for cellular metabolism in the early embryo is supplied by simple diffusion from fluids within the oviduct and uterus. Thus, the early embryo develops in a relatively hypoxic environment until the onset of vascularization after implantation (5Gassmann M. Fandrey J. Bichet S. Wartenberg M. Marti H.H. Bauer C. Wenger R.H. Acker H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2867-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Actually, oxygen tension in the mammalian reproductive tract is reported to be less than half the atmospheric oxygen tension (6Ficher P. Bavister B.D. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1993; 99: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Low oxygen tension triggers a wide range of cellular events centered on the regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) (7Semenza G.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 551-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar), which consists of a common β subunit (HIF-1β) and an oxygen-sensitive α subunit (HIF-1α). Under normoxia, HIF-1α is rapidly degraded via the von Hippel-Lindau protein-mediated ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (8Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22642-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar). Although the role and biological relevance of HIF-1 during murine embryonic development have been established (9Ramirez-Bergeron D.L. Runge A. Dahl K.D. Fehling H.J. Keller G. Simon M.C.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3005-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar), our understanding of how HIF-1 affects the early differentiation of mESCs at the molecular level is beginning to emerge. Our previous study demonstrated the presence of hypoxic regions during normal mouse development (12Lee Y.M. Jeong C.H. Koo S.Y. Son M.J. Song H.S. Bae S.K. Raleigh J.A. Chung H.Y. Yoo M.A. Kim K.W. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 220: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), which prompted us to study the role of hypoxia in mESC self-renewal or differentiation during in vitro culture. In the present work, we have cultured feeder-free mESCs together with LIF under low O2 tension (1% O2). Our data show that activated HIF-1α under these conditions induces mESC differentiation via suppression of the LIF-STAT3 signaling pathway. Accordingly, our results propose the important roles of HIF-1α in regulating the early differentiation of mESCs. ES Cell Culture—CCE, R1, J1, and E14TG2a mESCs were maintained on gelatin-coated dishes without feeders in knock-out Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% Knock-out SR™ (Invitrogen), 1000 units/ml LIF (ESGRO, Chemicon), 1 mml-glutamine, 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1% non-essential amino acids. For hypoxic conditions, cells were incubated in a hypoxia chamber (Forma Scientific) maintaining low oxygen tension (1% O2, 5%CO2, and balanced with N2) for the indicated times. Cell Proliferation Assay—CCE cells were seeded in gelatincoated 48-well plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells per well and cultured under indicated conditions. The proliferation rates of the cells were then measured using a Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 50 μl of freshly mixed tetrazolium/phenazine methosulfate was added, and the cells were incubated for 2 h to allow color development. The absorbance at 490 nm was measured to indicate the number of viable proliferating cells. AP Staining—Self-renewal of mESCs was determined by morphological assessment and alkaline phosphatase (AP) staining using a diagnostic kit (Sigma). The ratios of AP-positive colonies were scored. RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted form cultured cells using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen), and quantified with a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, Nyxor Biotech). First strand cDNA was synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) with 5 μg of each DNA-free total RNA sample and oligo(dT)15, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA (1 μl) was amplified by PCR using the ExTaq DNA polymerase kit (Takara). Information for specific primers used for RT-PCR analysis is given in supplemental Table S1. FACS Analysis—For cell cycle analysis, cells were detached with trypsin-EDTA and fixed overnight in ice-cold 70% ethanol. Fixed cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 0.1 μg/μl RNase A and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide at 37 °C for 30 min. Quantitative analysis was performed using a BD Biosciences FACS Calibur™ flow cytometer, Cell-Quest Pro software package (BD Biosciences), and ModFit software (Verity Software House). Western Blot Analysis—Immunoblotting was performed with primary antibodies against HIF-1α (Cayman Chemical, BD Bioscience), LIFR, STAT3, c-Myc, caspase-3, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), phosphor-Tyr-705-STAT3 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MD), and α-tubulin (InnoGenex). Anti-mouse/rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased form Pierce Chemical Co. Antibodies were detected using ECL Plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences), developed with LAS-3000 (Fujifilm). Immunofluorescence—Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, washed gently, and blocked with 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% bovine serum albumin, 10% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 30 min. Next, cells were incubated with LIFR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. After three washed in phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated IgG (Pierce). Nuclear counterstaining was performed using Hoechst (Sigma). Fluorescence staining was visualized using a fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared from CCE cells incubated with 1% or 21% O2 for 6 h, and EMSA was performed using each extract. Briefly, a double-stranded oligonucleotide harboring each rHRE was prepared by annealing and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. DNA-protein complexes were resolved by 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel at 200 V for 2 h, followed by autoradiography. The oligonucleotide sequences used to this study were as follows: rHRE1, 5′-TCTTCTCTGCACAAATAA-3′; rHRE2, 5′-TAGGTAATGCACAAAATC-3′; rHRE3, 5′-AGGCTTTGCACCCGCAGG-3′; and their corresponding complementary sequences. ChIP Analysis—ChIP was performed with the ChIP assay kit (Upstate), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The PCR primers, 5′-GAGCTGAGAGGTCCCCTCA-3′ and 5′-GCCAGCCTTGCAAGGTCA-3′, were designed to amplify a region of the LIFR promoter (-806 to -497) harboring at least two rHREs (-739 to -735 and -553 to -549). Luciferase Assay—A partial genomic DNA sequence encompassing the promoter region of LIFR bearing three rHREs was obtained by genomic PCR and cloned into an enhancerless luciferase pGL3 promoter vector (Promega). CCE cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells per well of a 6-well plate and transfected with various combinations of effector plasmids. After transfection, luciferase assays were performed using the Luciferase Assay System kit (Promega) and a luminometer (Turner Design). The relative luciferase activity was normalized to relative light units/β-galactosidase activity. RNA Interference—CCE cells (2 × 107) were electroporated with siRNA specific for HIF-1α (si1: antisense, 5′-UCAAACACACUGUGUCCAG-3′; sense, 5′-CUGGACACGUGUGUUUGA-3′ and si2: antisense, 5′-UUAUUGUCCUUCGUCUCUG-3′; sense, 5′-CAGAGACGAAGGACAAUAA-3′) at a concentration of 100 nm, using the Nucleofector device (Amaxa Biosystems). After electroporation, cells were split and grown for 24 h and exposed to a normoxic or hypoxic conditions for the indicated times. Immunohistochemistry—Tissue sections from mouse embryonic liver and retina were quenched with hydrogen peroxidase, blocked with serum-free protein blocker (DAKO), and incubated overnight at 4 °C with HIF-1α (Novus) and LIFR-specific antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Biotinylated anti-mouse/rabbit IgG (DAKO) was used to label the bound primary antibodies. Immunoreactivity was detected with streptavidin-conjugated peroxidase (DAKO) and diaminobenzidine (DAKO) as a chromogen. Sections were counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin (Sigma). Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as means ± S.D., and analysis was performed using the Student’s t test. Hypoxia Induces Early Differentiation of mESCs—In view of the limited information available on how mESCs respond to low oxygen tension, we analyzed the effect of hypoxia (1% O2) on the proliferation and morphology of mESCs. Proliferation of CCE cells revealed that hypoxia in the presence of LIF inhibited stem cell growth in a time-dependent manner compared with normoxia (Fig. 1A, right panel). It is well known that LIF acts as a distinct factor for enhancing the survival and proliferation of mESCS, thus enabling the long term propagation of undifferentiated cells (13Viswanathan S. Benatar T. Mileikovsky M. Lauffenburger D.A. Nagy A. Zandstra P.W. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2003; 84: 505-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Consistently with this, LIF-withdrawn cells under normoxia showed a more reduced proliferation rate (Fig. 1A, right panel). Furthermore, under normoxia (21% O2) in the presence of LIF, CCE cells displayed typical compact colony morphology, a fundamental characteristic of undifferentiation (Fig. 1A). In contrast, upon LIF withdrawal, cells became largely flattened and sharpen at the end of cells, a phenotype characteristic of differentiation. Interestingly, when cultured under hypoxia, even in the presence of LIF, cells grew as monolayers with fibroblast-like morphology comparable to that of differentiated cells (Fig. 1A). In parallel with these morphological changes, AP staining revealed a significant decrease in the proportion of undifferentiated colonies under hypoxia (Fig. 1B). Based on these results, RT-PCR analysis was conducted to assess the expression of ESC marker genes. Under normoxic condition in the presence of LIF (up to 48 h), there was no difference in expression level of ESC markers. Thus, we selected 48-h normoxic sample as an end-time point control to compare with that of hypoxic samples. Compared with normoxia, downregulation of Oct4, Fgf4, and Rex-1, representing mESC pluripotency, and up-regulation of Fgf5 associated with early differentiation were observed for 24- to 48-h hypoxia in the presence of LIF, consistent with the expression patterns of markers observed in LIF-withdrawn CCE cells (Fig. 1C). This differentiation pattern was confirmed in other mESC lines, such as R1 and E14TG2a (supplemental Fig. S1). The results indicate that mESCs, cultivated under hypoxia in the presence of LIF, are committed to differentiate at the expense of reduced proliferation and self-renewal activity. Apoptosis, a genetic program leading to cell death, is evident in the inner cell mass of late pre-implantation embryos and epiblastic cores of early post-implantation embryos in vivo (14Pampfer S. Donnay I. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Additionally, mESCs are irreversibly committed to differentiation upon LIF with-drawal, and parts of the cells undergo apoptosis during in vitro differentiation (15Duval D. Malaise M. Reinhardt B. Kedinger C. Boeuf H. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To verify that apoptosis is implicated in hypoxia-induced differentiation of mESCs, the cell cycle pattern was assessed by FACS. As shown in Fig. 1D, mESCs cultivated under normoxia displayed a unique cell cycle pattern composed largely of cells in the S-phase. However, the proportion of cells in the G0/G1 phase was elevated under hypoxia for 24 h. Furthermore, an increased proportion of apoptotic cells in the sub G1 phase was detected at 48 h under hypoxia (7.9%), comparable to that of LIF-withdrawn cells (10.9%). Consistently, proteolytic activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of its substrate, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, were elevated under hypoxia, indicating that mESCs respond to low O2 tension through a change in G1 phase arrest and subsequent apoptosis, even in the presence of LIF (Fig. 1E). These results suggest that hypoxia induces early differentiation of mESCs accompanying apoptosis, similar to that frequently observed upon LIF withdrawal. Hypoxia Down-regulates the LIF-STAT3 Signaling in mESCs—STAT3 activation is important for the maintenance of pluripotent mESCs. Notably, phosphorylation at tyrosine 705 is crucial for self-renewal activity of mESCs (4Matsuda T. Nakamura T. Nakao K. Arai T. Katsuki M. Heike T. Yokota T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4261-4269Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). To confirm the inhibitory role of hypoxia in LIF-mediated mESC self-renewal, we initially examined phosphorylated STAT3 (Tyr-705), a target of LIF signaling, after depletion of LIF and serum. Phosphorylation of STAT3 was rapidly induced by LIF under normoxic conditions, whereas hypoxia markedly impaired the ability of LIF to activate STAT3 (Fig. 2A). Thus, hypoxia is likely to be implicated in regulation of the LIF-STAT3 signaling pathway of mESCs. To characterize the mechanism by which hypoxia attenuates the phosphorylated STAT3 level, we investigated whether LIFR, an upstream signaling receptor involved in STAT3 activation, is down-regulated by hypoxia. Western blot analysis revealed a marked time-dependent decrease in LIFR protein expression under hypoxia in CCE cells that had been adapted to grow in serum-containing medium supplemented with LIF. The decrease was consistent with the reduction in phosphorylated STAT3 levels (Fig. 2B). We additionally analyzed c-Myc expression under the same conditions. This oncoprotein was recently identified as a functional target of STAT3 in mESC self-renewal (16Cartwright P. McLean C. Sheppard A. Rivett D. Jones K. Dalton S. Development. 2005; 132: 885-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Upon down-regulation of LIF-STAT3 signaling under hypoxia, there was a concomitant drop in the level of c-Myc (Fig. 2B). The results imply that hypoxia disrupts LIF-STAT3 signaling, which is crucial for the maintenance of mESC self-renewal. Down-regulation of LIFR in hypoxic mESCs was further confirmed by monitoring its expression patterns at the cellular level. Analysis of cell surface expression of LIFR assessed by immunostaining revealed that mESCs formed a compact colony and abundantly expressed LIFR in the cell membrane under normoxia, whereas LIFR expression was diminished under hypoxia (Fig. 2C). This result clearly suggests that hypoxia down-regulates the expression of LIFR, an upstream signaling receptor involved in STAT3 activation. In accordance with the previous report (17Tighe A.P. Gudas L.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 198: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), retinoic acid, a well known differentiation factor, also inhibited LIFR expression in our culture conditions (Fig. 2D), further supporting that hypoxia induces mESC differentiation through down-regulation of LIFR. HIF-1α Decreases LIFR Transcription by Binding to rHREs of LIFR Promoter—To determine the mechanism by which hypoxia down-regulates LIF-STAT3 signaling and whether O2 tension reversibly modulates LIFR expression, we evaluated the effects of hypoxia and reoxygenation on LIFR expression. The levels of LIFR protein and its mRNA transcript were dramatically reduced under hypoxia and gradually restored during reoxygenation (Fig. 3A). In contrast, HIF-1α was stabilized under hypoxia, but rapidly degraded during reoxygenation, as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3A). These results support the possible involvement of HIF-1α in down-regulation of LIFR under hypoxia. We then attempted to elucidate the mechanisms by which HIF-1α could regulate LIFR transcription. HIF-1α is a major transcription factor that activates the transcription of several genes involved in oxygen homeostasis, including vascular endothelial growth factor and erythropoietin (EPO), by binding to specific hypoxia-responsive elements (HREs) in their promoters (18Semenza G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 588-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). An earlier report (19Narravula S. Colgan S.P. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7543-7548Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) shows that HIF-1α acts as a transcriptional repressor of certain genes by direct binding to specific reverse HREs (rHREs), HREs on the antisense strand. Interestingly, the mouse LIFR promoter contains three potential rHREs (DNA consensus 5′-TGCAC-3′ located at positions -894 to -890, -739 to -735, and -553 to -549 from the translation start site) (20Chambers I. Cozens A. Broadbent J. Robertson M. Lee M. Li M. Smith A. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 879-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). In view of this finding, we investigated the possibility of LIFR as a direct transcriptional target of HIF-1α. EMSAs were performed to examine the binding of HIF-1α to the three putative rHREs of the LIFR promoter. EMSA data confirmed that all three potential rHREs act as binding sites for HIF-1α. Notably, HIF-1α binding to rHRE2 was stronger than that to rHRE1 or rHRE3 sites, possibly due to the differences in adjacent sequences (Fig. 3C, left panel). Binding of HIF-1α to rHREs was abrogated or supershifted upon preincubation with the competitor or HIF-1α antibody, respectively, which ensured the specificity of these interactions (Fig. 3C, right panel). We additionally performed the ChIP assay to verify HIF-1α interactions with rHREs in mESCs. Promoter occupancy was investigated using specific primers spanning two rHREs (-806 to -497) of LIFR. In CCE and R1 cells, the specific binding of HIF-1α to the LIFR promoter was observed under hypoxia (Fig. 3D). Next, we determined the effects of HIF-1α on transcriptional activity of the LIFR promoter containing three rHREs (LIFR-rHREs) by luciferase reporter gene assays. Hypoxia induced a significant decrease in the reporter gene activity in cells transfected with LIFR-rHREs. Co-transfection with HIF-1α/1β vectors decreased luciferase activity under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions (Fig. 3E, left panel), supporting the involvement of HIF-1α in suppressing LIFR promoter activity through binding to rHREs. In a parallel experiment performed with a reporter vector containing four HREs of EPO (EPO-HREs), there was a significant increase in the reporter gene activity in cells cotransfected with HIF-1α/1β (Fig. 3E, right panel). Therefore, it appears that HIF-1 decreases LIFR promoter activity by binding to LIFR-rHREs, whereas enhances EPO promoter activity by binding to EPO-HREs. It remains possible that the interaction with other transcriptional cofactors dictated by the promoter architecture allows the opposite transcriptional activity of HIF-1α. HIF-1α Is Involved in Early Differentiation of mESCs by Regulating the LIF-STAT3 Signaling—To confirm the hypoxic responsiveness of LIFR, the experiment was repeated with other mESC lines, including J1, R1, and E14TG2a. LIFR was consistently down-regulated under hypoxia, which was associated with increased stability of HIF-1α (Fig. 4A). We further addressed whether forced expression of HIF-1α triggers early differentiation of mESCs under normoxia. Overexpression of TM-HIF-1α vector, which contains a triple mutation of the hydroxylatable residues (21Baek J.H. Mahon P.C. Oh J. Kelly B. Krishnamachary B. Pearson M. Chan D.A. Giaccia A.J.

Cell. 2005; 17: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), resulted in more stable expression of HIF-1α, and this led to marked decrease in LIFR expression in J1 cells (Fig. 4B, top panel). Also, overexpression of wild-type and TM-HIF-1α into J1 cells induced the appearance of differentiated cells (Fig. 4B, middle panel), and the expression of germ layer marker genes such as brachyury (mesoderm) and GATA-4 (endoderm) (Fig. 4B, bottom panel). In addition, siRNA knockdown of HIF-1α under hypoxia led to a substantial recovery in LIFR and phosphorylated STAT3 relative to the control (Fig. 4C). Although these effects were not very high, knockdown of HIF-1α under hypoxia increased the proportion of undifferentiated colony determined by AP activity, suggesting that HIF-1α is involved in early differentiation of mESCs at least in part (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, treatment with l-mimosine, a prolylhydroxylase inhibitor stabilizing HIF-1α (22Warnecke C. Griethe W. Weidemann A. Jurgensen J.S. Willam C. Bachmann S. Ivashchenko Y. Wagner I. Frei U. Wiesener M. Eckardt K.U. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1186-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), decreased LIFR-rHRE reporter gene activity and LIFR protein expression (supplemental Fig. S2A). Consistently, l-mimosine-treated cells underwent differentiation with characteristic morphological changes and marker gene expression (supplemental Fig. S2B). These results strongly suggest that HIF-1α induces early differentiation of mESCs by down-regulating LIFR expression. To examine whether LIFR expression is affected by an elevated HIF-1α protein level in vivo, we examined the expression patterns of LIFR and HIF-1α in mouse embryonic liver, normal retina, and ischemic retina by immunostaining. Immunoreactivity of HIF-1α was evident in the embryonic liver at E13.5-16.5 stages, however, weak or no expression of LIFR was observed in HIF-1α-expressing regions of embryonic liver (supplemental Fig. S3A). Furthermore, in normal retinal tissues (CL-), LIFR was primarily identified in the retinal ganglion cell layer (GCL) and inner nuclear layer (INL) (supplemental Fig. S3B). After ischemia treatment, LIFR was not detected through all retinal layers at 24-h post-ischemia (supplemental Fig. S3B). However, HIF-1α displayed enhanced expression in tissues surrounding blood vessels of the GCL and upper and lower limits of the INL at 24 h in post-ischemic retina, but not in normal retina (supplemental Fig. S3B). This finding is consistent with the previously reported patterns of HIF-1α expression in ischemic retina (23Ozaki H. Yu A.Y. Della N. Ozaki K. Luna J.D. Yamada H. Hackett S.F. Okamoto N. Zack D.J. Semenza G.L. Campochiaro P.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 182-189PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that HIF-1α and LIFR expression are reciprocally regulated in mouse tissues in vivo, lending support to our proposed model of association between HIF-1α and LIFR. Low oxygen tension is known to induce angiogenesis and glycolysis for cell growth and survival and leads to growth arrest and apoptosis (24Koshiji M. Kageyama Y. Pete A.E. Horikawa I. Barrett J.C. Huang L.E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1949-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Previously, Carmeliet et al. (25Carmeliet P. Dor Y. Herbert J.M. Fukumura D. Brusselmans K. Dewerchin M. Neeman M. Bono F. Abramovitch R. Maxwell P. Koch C.J. Ratcliffe P. Moons L. Jain R.K. Collen D. Keshet E. Nature. 1998; 394: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar) suggested that hypoxia reduces stem cell proliferation and increases apoptosis through HIF-1α. Accordantly, a recent report (26Brusselmans K. Bono F. Collen D. Herbert J.M. Carmeliet P. Dewerchin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3493-3499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) suggested that ESC apoptosis is found to be dependent on the cellular differentiation and on the duration and degree of hypoxia. In this context, it is interesting to note that low O2 tension inhibits differentiation of hESCs (27Ezashi T. Das P. Roberts R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4783-4788Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar) and human marrow stromal cells (28D'Ippolito G. Diabira S. Howard G.A. Ross B.A. Schiller P.C. Bone. 2006; 39: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Notably, LIFR expression is low or absent in hESCs, indicating that the LIF-STAT3 signaling pathway does not appear to be involved in self-renewal of hESCs (29Thomson J.A. Itskovitz-Eldor J. Shapiro S.S. Waknitz M.A. Swiregiel J.J. Marshall V.S. Jones J.M. Science. 1998; 282: 1145-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (12274) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the molecular milieu of mESC differentiation under low oxygen tension involves HIF-1-mediated suppression of the LIF-STAT3 signaling pathway in vitro (Fig. 4E). Under normoxia, mESCs retain self-renewal activity through STAT3 activation in the presence of LIF. However, under hypoxia, stabilized HIF-1α binds to rHREs of the LIFR promoter, represses LIFR expression, and attenuates STAT3 phosphorylation. Consequently, loss of LIF-STAT3 signaling inhibits self-renewal and induces early differentiation of mESCs in our in vitro culture. Consistent with this, it was reported that the number of AP-positive colonies was reduced in lifr-/- mESCs, compared with the wild-type mESCs in vitro (30Chambers I. Smith A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7150-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), supporting the important role of LIF signaling in mESC proliferation and self-renewal. LIF and LIFR mRNAs are expressed in the mouse blastocyst in a reciprocal pattern between the trophectoderm and the inner cell mass (31Nichols J. Davidson D. Taga T. Yoshida K. Chambers I. Smith A. Mech. Dev. 1996; 57: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), suggesting their involvement in regulation of pluripotent cell survival in vivo. Nonetheless, an alternative, intrinsic determinant that is redundant to LIF signaling could be involved in the maintenance of inner cell mass. Recent reports suggest that Nanog maintains mESC self-renewal independently of the LIF-STAT3 pathway (32Chambers I. Colby D. Robertson M. Nichols J. Lee S. Tweedie S. Smith A. Cell. 2003; 113: 643-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2637) Google Scholar, 33Mitsui K. Tokuzawa Y. Itoh H. Segawa K. Murakami M. Takahashi K. Maruyama M. Maeda M. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2003; 113: 631-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar). However, there appears to be cross-talk between Nanog and the LIF-STAT3 pathway to promote maximal self-renewal efficiency of mESCs (32Chambers I. Colby D. Robertson M. Nichols J. Lee S. Tweedie S. Smith A. Cell. 2003; 113: 643-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2637) Google Scholar, 33Mitsui K. Tokuzawa Y. Itoh H. Segawa K. Murakami M. Takahashi K. Maruyama M. Maeda M. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2003; 113: 631-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar). In addition, STAT3 activated by LIF regenerates pluripotent mESCs from early mesoderm-specified progenitor cells via up-regulation of Nanog expression (34Suzuki A. Raya A. Kawakami Y. Morita M. Matsui T. Nakashima K. Gage F.H. Rodriguez-Esteban C. Izpisua Belmonte J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 10294-10299Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that such intrinsic and extrinsic factors responsible for mESC pluripotency could act cooperatively in vivo. Therefore, it will be a crucial task to clarify the functional relevance of these interactions in mouse embryo. At the same time, it remains to be clarified whether such alternative signaling pathways are regulated by O2 tension in vitro and in vivo. In summary, present data collectively provide insights into the mechanisms by which hypoxia inhibits self-renewal and induces early differentiation of mESCs via suppression of the LIF-STAT3 signaling in vitro. Moreover, we provide evidence that HIF-1α acts as a negative regulator of the LIF-STAT3 signaling, thereby establishing a possible link between early differentiation of mESCs and low O2 tension.

This activity is elicited by top-down signals from the frontal lobe and recapitulates the bottom-up pattern normally obtained by the recalled stimulus. To explore the generality and mechanisms of this phenomenon, we recorded motion-sensitive neurons at an early stage of cortical processing. After monkeys learned to associate directions of motion with static shapes, these neurons exhibited unprecedented selectivity for the shapes. This emergent shape selectivity reflects activation of neurons representing the motion stimuli recalled by association, and it suggests that recall-related activity may be a general feature of neurons in visual cortex."
https://openalex.org/W1969290598,"To predict the potential severity of outbreaks of infectious diseases such as SARS, HIV, TB and smallpox, a summary parameter, the basic reproduction number R0, is generally calculated from a population-level model. R0 specifies the average number of secondary infections caused by one infected individual during his/her entire infectious period at the start of an outbreak. R0 is used to assess the severity of the outbreak, as well as the strength of the medical and/or behavioral interventions necessary for control. Conventionally, it is assumed that if R0>1 the outbreak generates an epidemic, and if R0<1 the outbreak becomes extinct. Here, we use computational and analytical methods to calculate the average number of secondary infections and to show that it does not necessarily represent an epidemic threshold parameter (as it has been generally assumed). Previously we have constructed a new type of individual-level model (ILM) and linked it with a population-level model. Our ILM generates the same temporal incidence and prevalence patterns as the population-level model; we use our ILM to directly calculate the average number of secondary infections (i.e., R0). Surprisingly, we find that this value of R0 calculated from the ILM is very different from the epidemic threshold calculated from the population-level model. This occurs because many different individual-level processes can generate the same incidence and prevalence patterns. We show that obtaining R0 from empirical contact tracing data collected by epidemiologists and using this R0 as a threshold parameter for a population-level model could produce extremely misleading estimates of the infectiousness of the pathogen, the severity of an outbreak, and the strength of the medical and/or behavioral interventions necessary for control."

To understand the underlying structures mediating ion channel gating, we investigated the pH-dependent gating of the K+ channel KcsA under near-physiological conditions, using solution-state NMR. In a series of 1H15N-TROSY HSQC (transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy-heteronuclear single quantum coherence) spectra measured at various pH values, significant chemical shift changes were detected between pH 3.9 and 5.2, reflecting a conformational rearrangement associated with the gating. The pH-dependent chemical shift changes were mainly observed for the resonances from the residues near the intracellular helix bundle, which has been considered to form the primary gate in the K+ channel, as well as the intracellular extension of the inner helix. The substitution of His-25 by Ala abolished this pH-dependent conformational rearrangement, indicating that the residue serves as a “pH-sensor” for the channel. Although the electrophysiological open probability of KcsA is less than 10%, the conformations of the intracellular helix bundle between the acidic and neutral conditions seem to be remarkably different. This supports the recently proposed “dual gating” properties of the K+ channel, in which the activation-coupled inactivation at the selectivity filter determines the channel open probability of the channel. Indeed, a pH-dependent chemical shift change was also observed for the signal from the Trp-67 indole, which is involved in a hydrogen bond network related to the activation-coupled inactivation. The slow kinetic parameter obtained for the intracellular bundle seems to fit better into the time scale for burst duration than very fast fluctuations within a burst period, indicating the existence of another gating element with faster kinetic properties.

Ion channels play crucial roles in regulating membrane potential, signal transduction, and various physiological events. Therefore, the opening and closing of an ion channel (gating) is strictly controlled by physiological conditions as well as intra/extracellular ligands. The recent determinations of the crystal structures of K+ channels, including KcsA (a pH-dependent K+ channel) (1Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T.

Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 684-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), have enhanced our understanding of the gating mechanisms of the ion channels. Although the locations and structures of the regulatory regions differ significantly among the K+ channels, depending on their activation mechanisms, all K+ channels harbor a central pore formed by a symmetrical homotetramer and share an overall topology with two transmembrane helices in each subunit. The pore region contains a potassium-selectivity filter on its extracellular side, a region critical for the selective ion permeation, and the extracellular regions, including the selectivity filter, are quite similar among the K+ channels. The second transmembrane helices (or inner helices) of KcsA are straight and form a helix bundle near the membrane/aqueous interface (1Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5688) Google Scholar, 2Zhou Y. Morais-Cabral J.H. Kaufman A. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2001; 414: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1702) Google Scholar). The ion permeation pathway is thus closed at the helix bundle, and this is considered to represent the nonconductive conformation. This is quite reasonable, because the crystal structure was determined at a neutral pH, at which KcsA is expected be closed (11Cortes D.M. Perozo E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10343-10352Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 12Cuello L.G. Romero J.G. Cortes D.M. Perozo E.

In contrast, the inner helices of MthK, crystallized in the Ca2+-bound state, an open condition, are bent near the middle of the inner helices (3Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar, 14Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). As a result, the inner helices splay out toward the intracellular side, thus opening the ion permeation pathway. The other potassium channel structures could be classified as being in either a KcsA-type nonconductive conformation (Kirbac) or an MthK-type conductive conformation (KvAP and Kv1.2) (5Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Ruta V. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2003; 423: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar, 8Long S.B. Campbell E.B. Mackinnon R.

Neuron. 2003; 40: 527-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This observation and other experimental evidence support the idea that the intracellular helix bundle serves as the primary gate of the potassium channel (14Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar, 16Kelly B.L. Gross A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, there are several pieces of evidence suggesting that the gating of K+ channels is not solely determined by the conformational rearrangements within the intracellular helix bundle. In fact, mutations near the selectivity filter are known to affect the gating kinetics of K+ channels (17LeMasurier M. Heginbotham L. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 18Bichet D. Haass F.A. Jan L.Y. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 19Zheng J.

Neurosci. 2001; 4: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Recent detailed analyses of the gating of KcsA also claimed that the selectivity filter controls the electrophysiological open probability of the channel via an activation-coupled inactivation (21Cordero-Morales J.F. Cuello L.G. Zhao Y. Jogini V. Cortes D.M. Roux B. Perozo E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 22Gao L. Mi X. Paajanen V. Wang K. Fan Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 17630-17635Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Under such circumstances, the role of each gating element must be identified for an accurate understanding of potassium channel gating.The large scale conformational rearrangement associated with the gating implies intrinsic flexibility within the corresponding regions of the K+ channels, and thus emphasizes the importance of studying K+ channel structures in motion. Although some electron polarization resonance spectroscopy has been successfully applied to mutated and spin-labeled K+ channels (21Cordero-Morales J.F. Cuello L.G. Zhao Y. Jogini V. Cortes D.M. Roux B. Perozo E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 23Liu Y.S. Sompornpisut P. Perozo E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), NMR spectroscopy would be invaluable to study the structures and dynamics of the unmodified channel at atomic resolution. Here we directly examined the conformational rearrangement associated with the gating by analyzing a pH-dependent K+ channel, KcsA, which is closed at a neutral pH and open at an acidic pH (pH 4) (11Cortes D.M. Perozo E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10343-10352Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 12Cuello L.G. Romero J.G. Cortes D.M. Perozo E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3229-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 13Heginbotham L. Odessey E. Miller C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10335-10342Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), using solution NMR techniques. We found that KcsA adapts distinctly different in conformations between the closed (pH 5.2) and open (pH 3.9) conditions. The conformational rearrangement was mainly observed on the intracellular side, especially for the intracellular gate region, which is consistent with the gate movement suggested by the x-ray crystallographic studies. An Ala substitution of His-25 abolished the conformational rearrangement, showing that the residue serves as a “pH sensor” for KcsA. The higher rate of the conformational rearrangement than the electrophysiological open probability (Po) supports the idea that the activation-coupled inactivation of the selectivity filter, rather than the opening of the intracellular helix bundle, acts as a determining factor for the electrophysiological open probability of the channel. On the basis of these results from NMR experiments and several mutation studies, we will discuss the structural elements that control the gating of K+ channels.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of the KcsA K+ Channel Expression Vector—The C-terminal deletion construct, Δ125-160 KcsA K+ channel, was generated from the wild type KcsA construct reported previously (24Takeuchi K. Yokogawa M. Matsuda T. Sugai M. Kawano S. Kohno T. Nakamura H. Takahashi H. Shimada I. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 1381-1392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The wild type KcsA vector contains the gene encoding the KcsA K+ channel with optimal codon usage for Escherichia coli. An additional sequence, including the decahistidine tag and the PreScission™ protease recognition site, was added immediately before the initial methionine residue. The resultant gene was transferred into the pET24d vector, using the NcoI and SalI restriction sites. To generate the Δ125-160 KcsA K+ channel, a stop codon (TGA) was introduced by PCR mutagenesis, using Pfu DNA polymerase. In all of the constructs, the KcsA K+ channel coding regions were completely sequenced, using the T7 promoter and T7 terminator primers, for verification.Expression and Purification of the KcsA K+ Channel—The KcsA K+ channel was expressed and purified according to the previous report, with minor modifications (24Takeuchi K.

E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) was transformed with the expression construct. The KcsA protein uniformly labeled with 2H and 15N was obtained by growing the E. coli in M9 minimal medium, in 99.8% D2O with 50 μg/ml kanamycin, prepared with 500 mg liter-115NH4Cl (99.9% enriched), 2 g liter-1 [2H6]glucose (97% enriched), and 1g liter-12H (>97% enriched), and 15N (>98% enriched) Celtone® base powder. To obtain the partially deuterated 15N-labeled KcsA protein, M9 minimal medium in H2O, with 50 μg/ml kanamycin, was prepared with 500 mg liter-1 15NH4Cl (99.9% enriched), 1.5 g liter-1 [2H6]glucose (97% enriched), and 2 g liter-12H (>97% enriched), and 15N (>98% enriched) Celtone® base powder was used. To obtain Lys and His selectively labeled KcsA, M9 minimal medium in H2O, supplemented with 19 amino acids other than the targeted amino acid, was prepared with 1 g liter-1 NH4Cl (99.9% enriched), 3 g liter-1 glucose, and 50 μg/ml kanamycin, and then 100 mg liter-1 of 15N-labeled Lys or His was added 15 min prior to the induction of protein expression. The cells were incubated at 37 °C, and after reaching an A600 = 0.6, the expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were harvested after 4-6 h of induction and were resuspended in 60 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 150 mm KCl) with 0.1 mg/ml PefaBloc at 4 °C. The suspended cells were disrupted by sonication. The resultant solution was solubilized with 20 mm of n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DDM) 3The abbreviations used are: DDM, n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside; TROSY, transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence. for 1 h at room temperature, and the insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 15,000 × g. The supernatant was applied to a 5-ml column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose. After washing the resin with 40 ml of buffer A, containing 30-100 mm imidazole and 5 mm DDM, the KcsA K+ channel protein was eluted with 40 ml of buffer A, containing 400 mm imidazole and 1 mm DDM. The elution fraction was concentrated to 20 ml by a 30,000 molecular weight cut-off membrane ultrafiltration. PreScission protease (0.5 units/20 μg of KcsA) and 1 mm dithiothreitol were added to the concentrated elution fraction, and the solution was dialyzed against 1 liter of buffer B (20 mm NaPi (pH 8.0), 150 mm KCl, and 30 mm imidazole), containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 0.25 mm DDM, for 15 h. The digested solution was dialyzed twice against 1 liter of buffer B, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.25 mm DDM, and was continuously applied to a 1.5-ml bed volume of glutathione-Sepharose and a 3-ml bed volume of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, to remove the PreScission protease and the undigested KcsA, respectively. The final yield of the Δ125-160 KcsA K+ channel was 2 mg/liter culture.NMR Spectroscopy—For NMR experiments, the purified KcsA was concentrated to 250 μl by a 30,000 molecular weight cut-off membrane ultrafiltration. The concentration of DDM was controlled by the addition of DDM-containing or DDM-deficient buffer. Experiments were performed on a Bruker Avance 500, 600, or 800 spectrometer equipped with a cryogenic probe. For the spectra, a 200-800 μm concentration of 2H,15N-labeled or amino acid selectively labeled KcsA K+ channel (as the monomer), solubilized with DDM, was prepared in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, containing 150 mm KCl and 90% H2O, 10% D2O. DDM-solubilized KcsA is known to form a stable tetramer, even at an elevated temperature (25Molina M.L. Encinar J.A. Barrera F.N. Fernandez-Ballester G. Riquelme G. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14924-14931Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed all measurements at 323 K. The chemical shifts of the resonances at 323 K were almost identical to those observed at room temperature, whereas the line widths of each resonance were significantly improved (data not shown). The concentration of DDM in the sample was estimated from the standard sample with a known amount of the detergent. Assuming all DDM molecules in the sample form a complex with KcsA, the total molecular mass of the KcsA-DDM complex under the experimental conditions was estimated to be 106-132 kDa, from the DDM concentration in the sample. The molecular weight of the complex is also consistent with gradient diffusion measurements (26Vinogradova O. Sonnichsen F. Sanders II, C.R. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To observe the amide signals resonating from the structured region of such a large protein complex, maximization of the TROSY effect by the almost complete deuteration of the nonexchangeable protons would be essential (27Oxenoid K. Sonnichsen F.D. Sanders C.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5111-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the expression level of Δ125-160 KcsA in D2O-based medium was quite low (less than 100 μg liter-1). Therefore, we produced the protein in H2O-based medium supplemented with a deuterated amino acid mixture, as reported previously (28Fiaux J. Bertelsen E.B. Horwich A.L. Wuthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 29: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 29Lohr F. Katsemi V. Hartleib J. Gunther U. Ruterjans H. J. Biomol. NMR. 2003; 25: 291-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONpH Titration Behavior of KcsA, Monitored by TROSY HSQC—The NMR spectra presented in this paper were acquired using the C-terminal deletion construct of KcsA (Δ125-160 KcsA), which was solubilized in DDM. Fig. 1 shows a comparison of the 1H15N-TROSY HSQC spectra of Δ125-160 KcsA and the full-length KcsA at pH 6 (closed condition). The distributions of the dispersed signals are almost identical for both of the constructs, indicating that the truncation of the C-terminal region does not perturb the overall structure of the protein, and thus we chose Δ125-160 KcsA for further analyses. The observed HSQC spectra showed overall resonance dispersions similar to what is obtained for the SDS-solubilized KcsA (10Chill J.H. Louis J.M. Miller C. Bax A. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 684-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), indicating the similarity in the secondary structure elements. However, the exact chemical shifts of the resonances are not identical, including those from the intracellular gate region, which we will focus on later. Because the SDS-solubilized KcsA could not tolerate lower pH conditions, the use of a strong ionic detergent for the solubilization might induce some structural instability or pH-dependent morphology change in the protein, which would not be the case with the mild nonionic detergent DDM. Although the solubilization in detergent can cause functional deficiency in a membrane protein, this does not seem to be the case for the DDM-solubilized KcsA. In fact, the interaction of KcsA with an inhibitor, agitoxin2, was not different between the DDM-solubilized and membrane-reconstituted conditions (30Yokogawa M. Takeuchi K. Shimada I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 12021-12027Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and the pH-dependent opening of the channel was intact in the DDM-solubilized condition (16Kelly B.L. Gross A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).The pH titration behaviors of Δ125-160 KcsA, monitored by TROSY HSQC spectra, are shown in Fig. 2. The line widths of the signals from Δ125-160 KcsA were reasonably narrow, and out of 123 expected resonances, 110 resonances were observed in the TROSY HSQC spectra. At pH 3.9, the dispersion of the resonances was quite different from that at pH 5.2. The chemical shift changes were predominantly observed in this pH range, because the spectra recorded at pH 3.6 and pH 6.0 were almost identical to the spectra obtained at pH 3.9 and pH 5.2, respectively (data not shown). The apparent pKa value of the spectral transition was estimated to be pH 4.5. Because the pH range of the chemical shift transitions overlapped with that of the open/closed transition, the observed spectral change most likely reflects a conformational rearrangement that is accompanied by the gating of KcsA. About 30 resonances showed apparent shifts in a slow to intermediate exchanging fashion, as typically observed for the cross-peaks indicated in Fig. 2 by the blue dotted circles (slow exchange) and the arrows (intermediate exchange). On the other hand, the total number of resonances was almost identical under both pH conditions. In the spectrum recorded at pH 4.4, two sets of signals were observed, corresponding to both sets of slowly exchanging signals recorded at pH 3.9 and pH 5.2. These facts indicate that only a limited region in the protein undergoes a pH-dependent conformational rearrangement, and that the conformational rearrangement of this region is relatively slow (in the range of second-millisecond motion). Assuming two-site exchange between these signals, then an exchange rate, slower than 150 s-1, can be estimated from the line shapes of these resonances (Fig. 3).FIGURE 21H,15N-TROSY HSQC spectra of Hα partially protonated/2H/15N-labeled Δ125-160 KcsA at various pH values. Counter plots in black, green, and red correspond to the spectra recorded at pH 5.2, pH 4.4, and pH 3.9, respectively.

KcsA has only a small number of these residues (1 for Lys residues and 4 for His residues), and the main chain amide moieties of these residues are known to be less scrambled with the other amino acids; thus, these residues are suitable for obtaining information about the conformational rearrangement of KcsA without ambiguity. As shown in Fig. 3A, these residues are distributed in both the proximal (His-25, Trp-26, and Trp-113) and distal (His-1, His-20, His-67, Trp-68, Trp-87, and His-124) regions relative to the intracellular gate of KcsA. The distributions also make these residues good probes to identify the conformational rearrangement associated with the gating of KcsA. Fig. 4 (B-D) shows close up views of the pH titration behaviors of the Trp indole resonances and the main chain amide signals of Lys and His residues in amino acid selectively labeled Asp-125 to Asp-160 KcsA. Δ125-160 KcsA possesses only one Lys residue, Lys-14, and thus the resonance observed in the Lys-selective spectrum was unambiguously assigned. The assignments of the other resonances were established by comparisons between the wild type and mutant spectra (H1A, H20A, H25A, W26F, W67F, W87Y, W113F, and H124A) under each pH condition. Overall, the spectra of the wild type and mutant KcsA were similar, indicating that these substitutions did not alter the global conformation of the proteins (data not shown). At neutral pH, Trp-26 and Trp-67 showed significantly higher and lower field proton chemical shifts, respectively. The high field shift of Trp-26 is possibly a consequence of the tilted stacking of the residue toward Trp-113 (Fig. 4A), whereas the lower field shift of the Trp-67 resonance might reflect a hydrogen bond network involving the indole proton, a water molecule, and the carboxyl moieties of Glu-71 and Asp-80 (2Zhou Y. Morais-Cabral J.H. Kaufman A. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2001; 414: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1702) Google Scholar).FIGURE 4Distributions of Trp, Lys, and His residues in KcsA (A) and close up views of the Trp indole (B), Lys (C), and His (D) main chain amide resonances in the 1H15N HSQC spectra. A, distributions of Trp, Lys, and His residues are mapped on the crystal structure of KcsA (2Zhou Y. Morais-Cabral J.H. Kaufman A. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2001; 414: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1702) Google Scholar). Δ125-160 KcsA contains five Trp residues per subunit. Two of them are located on the intracellular side near the helix bundle (Trp-26 and Trp-113), and the others (Trp-67, Trp-68, and Trp-113) are on the extracellular side of the protein. Trp-67 forms the pore-inner helix interface, and Trp-68 is located in the protein core between the selectivity filter and the pore helix, and Trp-87 is at the N terminus of the inner helix. Δ125-160 KcsA possesses only one Lys residue, Lys-14, in the N-terminal intracellular region, and this residue was not observed in the crystal structure of KcsA. As for the His residues, Δ125-160 KcsA contains four residues as follows: His-1 is in the N-terminal sequence left after the enzymatic digestion; His-20 is at the end of the N-terminal intracellular region; His-25 is in the outer/inner helix interface near the helix bundle; and His-124 is at the C terminus of the protein. His-1 and His-20 do not exist in the crystal structure of KcsA.

The experimental conditions were the same as in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)With decreasing pH, the signals resonating from the residues near the intracellular helix bundle (His-25, Trp-26, and Trp-113) drastically shifted their positions (change in normalized chemical shift >0.2 ppm) in a slowly exchanging fashion (see chemical shift differences in Table 1). Smaller chemical shift changes were observed for His-20 and His-124, which are located at the N terminus of the outer helix (7 Aå apart from the most significantly shifted His-25 to the cytoplasmic side) and the C terminus of the inner helix (17 Aå apart from His-25 to the cytoplasmic side), respectively. A slowly exchanging pH-dependent chemical shift was also observed for the C-2 position of His-124 (data not shown). No chemical shift perturbation was observed for the N-terminal distal region (His-1 and Lys-14) and the extracellular side (Trp-68 and Trp-87) of KcsA over the pH range recorded in this experiment. These observations show that the pH-dependent structural rearrangement occurs over a rather wide range on the intracellular side, especially around the region close to the helix bundle. This agrees well with the proposed gating model, b"
https://openalex.org/W2093508880,"Conspecific allorecognition, the ability for an organism to discriminate its own cells from those of another individual of the same species, has been developed by many organisms. Allorecognition specificities are determined by highly polymorphic genes. The processes by which this extreme polymorphism is generated remain largely unknown. Fungi are able to form heterokaryons by fusion of somatic cells, and somatic non self-recognition is controlled by heterokaryon incompatibility loci (het loci). Herein, we have analyzed the evolutionary features of the het-d and het-e fungal allorecognition genes. In these het genes, allorecognition specificity is determined by a polymorphic WD-repeat domain. We found that het-d and het-e belong to a large gene family with 10 members that all share the WD-repeat domain and show that repeats of all members of the family undergo concerted evolution. It follows that repeat units are constantly exchanged both within and between members of the gene family. As a consequence, high mutation supply in the repeat domain is ensured due to the high total copy number of repeats. We then show that in each repeat four residues located at the protein/protein interaction surface of the WD-repeat domain are under positive diversifying selection. Diversification of het-d and het-e is thus ensured by high mutation supply, followed by reshuffling of the repeats and positive selection for favourable variants. We also propose that RIP, a fungal specific hypermutation process acting specifically on repeated sequences might further enhance mutation supply. The combination of these evolutionary mechanisms constitutes an original process for generating extensive polymorphism at loci that require rapid diversification."
https://openalex.org/W2080282929,"We reported previously that protein kinase Cα (PKCα), a negative regulator of cell growth in the intestinal epithelium, inhibits cyclin D1 translation by inducing hypophosphorylation/activation of the translational repressor 4E-BP1. The current study explores the molecular mechanisms underlying PKC/PKCα-induced activation of 4E-BP1 in IEC-18 nontransformed rat ileal crypt cells. PKC signaling is shown to promote dephosphorylation of Thr45 and Ser64 on 4E-BP1, residues directly involved in its association with eIF4E. Consistent with the known role of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR pathway in regulation of 4E-BP1, PKC signaling transiently inhibited PI3K activity and Akt phosphorylation in IEC-18 cells. However, PKC/PKCα-induced activation of 4E-BP1 was not prevented by constitutively active mutants of PI3K or Akt, indicating that blockade of PI3K/Akt signaling is not the primary effector of 4E-BP1 activation. This idea is supported by the fact that PKC activation did not alter S6 kinase activity in these cells. Further analysis indicated that PKC-mediated 4E-BP1 hypophosphorylation is dependent on the activity of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). PKC signaling induced an ∼2-fold increase in PP2A activity, and phosphatase inhibition blocked the effects of PKC agonists on 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and cyclin D1 expression. H2O2 and ceramide, two naturally occurring PKCα agonists that promote growth arrest in intestinal cells, activate 4E-BP1 in PKC/PKCα-dependent manner, supporting the physiological significance of the findings.

Previous studies from this laboratory have demonstrated that PKC/PKCα signaling triggers a program of cell cycle withdrawal in intestinal epithelial cells characterized by rapid down-regulation of cyclin D1, increased expression of Cip/Kip cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, and activation of the growth suppressor function of members of the pocket protein family (14Frey M.R.

Downregulation of cyclin D1 precedes various hallmark events of cell cycle exit, pointing to the importance of regulation of this cyclin in PKC-mediated growth arrest in intestinal epithelial cells. Analysis of the mechanisms underlying PKC/PKCα-mediated down-regulation of cyclin D1 identified PKCα as a negative regulator of cyclin D1 translation (7Hizli A.A. Black A.R. Pysz M.A. Black J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14596-14603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). PKC/PKCα signaling activates the translational repressor 4E-BP1, which blocks cap-dependent translation initiation through association with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). eIF4E is a key regulator of translation initiation that binds to the 5′-cap structure (m7GpppN, where N is any nucleotide) found in the majority of eukaryotic mRNAs. At the cap, eIF4E interacts with eIF4G and eIF4A to form eIF4F, the translation initiation complex that recruits the 40 S ribosomal subunit to mRNA (16Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar). eIF4E activity is rate-limiting for translation and has been found to be particularly important for translation of mRNAs with highly structured 5′-untranslated regions, a characteristic of mRNAs of many growth-related genes such as cyclin D1 and c-myc (17De Benedetti A. Graff J.R. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3189-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Thus, eIF4E activity is a primary target for control of gene expression, and its importance in maintenance of tissue homeostasis is highlighted by the fact that it is commonly overexpressed in tumors (17De Benedetti A. Graff J.R. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3189-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). A major mechanism for regulation of eIF4E activity is through its interaction with a family of translational inhibitory proteins, the eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs), the best characterized of which is 4E-BP1 (16Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar). In their active forms, these molecules compete with eIF4G for binding to eIF4E, thereby preventing the assembly of eIF4F and thus inhibiting cap-dependent translation initiation. The activity of 4E-BPs is regulated by hierarchical phosphorylation at multiple sites (18Gingras A.C. Raught B. Gygi S.P. Niedzwiecka A. Miron M. Burley S.K. Polakiewicz R.D. Wyslouch-Cieszynska A. Aebersold R. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2852-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). Although hypophosphorylated 4E-BPs bind with high affinity to eIF4E, hyperphosphorylation of these molecules results in loss of their eIF4E binding activity, thus promoting translation initiation. Importantly, through their inhibitory effects on protein translation, 4E-BPs have been identified as potent negative regulators of cell growth (19Rousseau D. Gingras A.C. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2415-2420PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies have demonstrated that PKC/PKCα-induced activation of 4E-BP1 in intestinal epithelial cells promotes association of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E and sequestration of cyclin D1 message in 4E-BP1-associated complexes (7Hizli A.A. Black A.R. Pysz M.A. Black J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14596-14603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These alterations ensure rapid disappearance of the potent mitogenic factor cyclin D1 and thus play an important role in PKC/PKCα-induced cell cycle withdrawal in intestinal epithelial cells. The phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 is regulated by a variety of extracellular stimuli including mitogens, growth factors, cytokines, hormones, G-protein-coupled receptor agonists, and nutrient availability (16Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar). A large number of studies in different systems point to the mTOR protein kinase as a major regulator of 4E-BP1 (20Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 807-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar, 21Hay N. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1926-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (3203) Google Scholar). Inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin markedly impairs 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and blocks its release from eIF4E (22Beretta L. Gingras A.C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 658-664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 is strongly modulated by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway and by nutrients/amino acids, both upstream regulators of mTOR signaling (20Gingras A.C.

Thus, a complex system of signaling molecules, comprised of scaffold proteins, kinases, and phosphatases, appears to control the phosphorylation/activity of 4E-BP1. In this study, we have explored the mechanism(s) underlying PKC/PKCα-induced hypophosphorylation/activation of 4E-BP1 in IEC-18 nontransformed rat intestinal crypt cells. Our analysis indicates that PP2A activity plays a predominant role in mediating PKC-induced dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in this system and points to a PKC-regulated, PI3K/Akt-independent pathway of 4E-BP1 control in intestinal cells.

PKCα,-δ, and -ɛ were activated in subconfluent cells by treatment with PMA (100 nm), Bryo (100 nm), or DiC8 (20 μg/ml). Control cells were treated with the appropriate vehicle (ethanol or Me2SO). Inhibition of PKCα,-δ, and -ɛ activity, or of PKCα activity alone, was achieved using 5 μm BIM, 10 μm Ro-32-0432 or 1–2 μm Goö6976.

PMA- or vehicle-treated IEC-18 cells were harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with protease/phosphatase inhibitor mixtures (Sigma)), and particulate material was removed by centrifugation. Cell lysates (∼400 μg of protein) were incubated with 50 μl of 7-methyl-GTP-Sepharose 4B slurry (Amersham Biosciences) for 16 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and cap-bound protein was eluted with Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Analysis of 4E-BP1-eIF4E Interaction— 4E-BP1 was immunoprecipitated from extracts of PMA- or vehicle-treated cells using rabbit anti-4E-BP1 antibody (Cell Signaling) and protein A-Dynabeads (Dynal) as we have described (7Hizli A.A.

IEC-18 cells treated with LY294002 (50 μm) or PMA (100 nm) were lysed in buffer A (137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 μm NaVO4, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and sheared by several passes through a 27-gauge needle. The extract was then incubated on ice for 30 min and cleared by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 15 min) at 4 °C. Lysates containing equal amounts of protein (500 μg) were incubated with 5 μlof anti-PI3K p85 antibody overnight at 4 °C followed by the addition of 25 μl of protein A/G plus-agarose slurry (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were then washed twice with wash buffer 1 (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 μm NaVO4), twice with wash buffer 2 (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm LiCl, 100 μm NaVO4), and twice with wash buffer 3 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 100 μm NaVO4). Following the washes, immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 50 μl of kinase assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA); 10 μg of phosphatidylinositol sodium salt was added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Kinase activity was measured by the addition of 2 μlof[32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 20 mm MgCl2 for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by the addition of concentrated HCl and chloroform:methanol mix (0.2: 20:20, v/v). The aqueous and organic phases were separated by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 2 min. The organic phase containing the phosphatidylinositol phosphates was spotted onto a silica gel H TLC plate coated with 1% potassium oxalate and separated in a TLC chamber in developing buffer (chloroform: methanol:ammonium hydroxide: H2O at 129:114:15:21 (v/v)). The TLC plate was exposed to Kodak Biomax XAR film for 2–6 h at room temperature or overnight at –80 °C. Phosphorylated products were visualized, and the intensity of the spots was quantified by scanning densitometry. Adenovirus Expansion and Transfection—Adenoviral vectors directing expression of constitutively membrane-associated Myr-HA-Akt1 (Ad-CMV-Akt1 (Myr)) or green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter adenovirus (Ad-CMV-GFP) were purchased from Vector Biolabs. Constitutively active PI3K adenovirus (Myc-CA-PI3K(p110αCAAX)-AdV) and control adenovirus vectors were generated and characterized as described (32Song K. Wang H. Krebs T.L. Danielpour D. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 58-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Adenoviral vectors expressing full-length human PKCα or LacZ were a kind gift from Drs. Toshio Kuroki (Kobe University, Japan) and Marcelo G. Kazanietz (University of Pennsylvania) (33Fujii T. Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Bernabo J.L. Caamano J. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Li L. Yuspa S.H. Kazanietz M.G.

Subconfluent IEC-18 cells in 6-well plates were infected with GFP or Myr-Akt adenoviruses for 16 h at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 50 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm l-glutamine, and 0.15% insulin. Analysis of cells infected with GFP reporter adenovirus revealed an infection efficiency of near 100%. IEC-18 cells were infected with control or CA-PI3K adenoviruses at an m.o.i. of 140 with >90% infection efficiency as determined by anti-Myc immunofluorescence staining. PKCα and LacZ adenoviruses were added at an m.o.i. of 5, with an infection efficiency of ∼95%. After the virus was removed, cells were incubated in fresh complete culture medium for an additional 48 h. Following treatment with PKC agonists or vehicle, the cells were harvested and analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. Phosphatase Activity Assay—PP2A activity was determined using a PP2A immunoprecipitation phosphatase assay from Upstate that measures free phosphate with a malachite green dye. After the indicated treatments, cells were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm imidazole-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, pH 7.0, with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). To immunoprecipitate PP2A, lysates containing 200 μg of protein were incubated with 4 μg of anti-PP2A-C subunit antibody (clone 1D6) and 40 μl of protein A-agarose slurry for 2 h at 4 °C with constant rocking. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times in Tris-buffered saline and once with Ser/Thr assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 100 μm CaCl2), and resuspended in 20 μl of Ser/Thr assay buffer. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 60 μl of phosphopeptide substrate (750 μm) (KRpTIRR). Following incubation for 10 min at 30 °C in a shaking incubator, the reaction mixture was centrifuged briefly and the supernatant transferred to a 96-well microtiter plate. The reaction was terminated by the addition of malachite green phosphate detection solution for 10–15 min at room temperature, and free phosphate was quantified by measuring the absorbance of the mixture at 650 nm using a microplate reader. PKC Agonists Induce Hypophosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and Down-regulation of Cyclin D1 in IEC-18 Cells—Murine 4E-BP1 is detected as three distinct bands by Western blot analysis: a slow-migrating, hyperphosphorylated γ-form; and two faster migrating, hypophosphorylated forms, designated α and β (22Beretta L. Gingras A.C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 658-664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Pham F.H. Sugden P.H. Clerk A. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1252-1258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The γ-form does not interact with eIF4E and is, therefore, permissive for translation, whereas the α- and β-forms bind to eIF4E with high and moderate affinity, respectively, and are translational repressors. As shown in Fig. 1A (top panel), activation of PKC with a panel of PKC agonists, including the phorbol ester PMA, the diacylglycerol analog DiC8, and the macrocyclic lactone Bryo, leads to a reduction in the translation permissive γ-form of 4E-BP1 and an accumulation of the faster migrating α- and β-forms. The activity of these translation inhibitory forms was confirmed by cap affinity chromatography, which revealed a striking increase in cap-bound 4E-BP1 α/β-phosphoforms in PKC agonist-treated cells (Fig. 1A, middle panel). 4E-BP1 immunoprecipitation assays further confirmed increased association of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E in PMA-treated cells, comparable with that observed in serum-starved cells (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). Hypophosphorylation of 4E-BP1 by PKC agonists is accompanied by down-regulation of cyclin D1 protein (Fig. 1B), which can be seen by 30 min and is maximal by ∼2 h. As we have shown previously for cyclin D1 down-regulation (7Hizli A.A. Black A.R. Pysz M.A. Black J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14596-14603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the effects of PKC agonists on 4E-BP1 are PKC-dependent, as indicated by the ability of the general PKC inhibitors BIM and Ro-32-0432 to block the accumulation of translational repressive forms of the protein (Fig. 2A, left and middle panels). Inhibition of PMA-induced 4E-BP1 activation by the PKCα-selective inhibitor Goö6976 points to a major role of PKCα in promoting translational repression (Fig. 2A; see Ref. 7Hizli A.A. Black A.R. Pysz M.A. Black J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14596-14603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The PKCα-selectivity of Goö6976 in IEC-18 cells was confirmed by its ability to protect PKCα, but not PKCδ or ɛ, from PKC agonist-induced down-regulation (an effect that requires PKC catalytic activity (34Leontieva O.V. Black J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5788-5801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 2A, right panel). The role of PKCα in activation of 4E-BP1 is further supported by PKCα overexpression studies. We have previously demonstrated that PMA-induced 4E-BP1 activation is transient in IEC-18 cells, with reversal of the effect coinciding with down-regulation/desensitization of PKC/PKCα (Fig. 2B; see Ref. 7Hizli A.A. Black A.R. Pysz M.A. Black J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14596-14603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Little 4E-BP1 translational inhibitory activity remains after 6 h of PMA treatment. In contrast, 4E-BP1 hypophosphorylation is sustained in PKCα-overexpressing cells, coincident with sustained activity of the enzyme (Fig. 2B). PKC/PKCα Mediates the Effects of H2O2 and Ceramide on 4E-BP1— To explore the physiological relevance of PKC/PKCα-mediated activation of 4E-BP1, we examined the involvement of PKC signaling in hypophosphorylation/activation of 4E-BP1 by H2O2 and ceramide. These agents were selected based on their participation in growth-inhibitory signaling systems that have been shown to increase diacylglycerol levels and/or activate PKCα in a number of cell types (H2O2 (35Abdala-Valencia H.

As shown in Fig. 3, both H2O2 and ceramide induce hypophosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in IEC-18 cells. Notably, 4E-BP1 activation by these agents can be inhibited by the general PKC inhibitor Ro-32-0432 (data not shown) and the PKCα-selective inhibitor Goö6976 (Fig. 3). The demonstration that PKC/PKCα activity is required for induction of 4E-BP1 activity by two physiological signaling molecules in this system provides support for the biological significance of the effects observed using PKC agonists.

https://openalex.org/W2061154752,"Metallothioneins are ubiquitous small, cysteine-rich, multifunctional proteins which can bind heavy metals.We report the results of phylogenetic and gene expression analyses that include two new Tetrahymena thermophila metallothionein genes (MTT3 and MTT5). Sequence alignments of all known Tetrahymena metallothioneins have allowed us to rationalize the structure of these proteins. We now formally subdivide the known metallothioneins from the ciliate genus Tetrahymena into two well defined subfamilies, 7a and 7b, based on phylogenetic analysis, on the pattern of clustering of Cys residues, and on the pattern of inducibility by the heavy metals Cd and Cu. Sequence alignment also reveals a remarkably regular, conserved and hierarchical modular structure of all five subfamily 7a MTs, which include MTT3 and MTT5. The former has three modules, while the latter has only two. Induction levels of the three T. thermophila genes were determined using quantitative real time RT-PCR. Various stressors (including heavy metals) brought about dramatically different fold-inductions for each gene; MTT5 showed the highest fold-induction. Conserved DNA motifs with potential regulatory significance were identified, in an unbiased way, upstream of the start codons of subfamily 7a MTs. EST evidence for alternative splicing in the 3' UTR of the MTT5 mRNA with potential regulatory activity is reported.The small number and remarkably regular structure of Tetrahymena MTs, coupled with the experimental tractability of this model organism for studies of in vivo function, make it an attractive system for the experimental dissection of the roles, structure/function relationships, regulation of gene expression, and adaptive evolution of these proteins, as well as for the development of biotechnological applications for the environmental monitoring of toxic substances."
https://openalex.org/W2018418014,"E40K and E54K mutations in alpha-tropomyosin cause inherited dilated cardiomyopathy. Previously we showed, using Ala-Ser alpha-tropomyosin (AS-alpha-Tm) expressed in Escherichia coli, that both mutations decrease Ca(2+) sensitivity. E40K also reduces V(max) of actin-Tm-activated S-1 ATPase by 18%. We investigated cooperative allosteric regulation by native Tm, AS-alpha-Tm, and the two dilated cardiomyopathy-causing mutants. AS-alpha-Tm has a lower cooperative unit size (6.5) than native alpha-tropomyosin (10.0). The E40K mutation reduced the size of the cooperative unit to 3.7, whereas E54K increased it to 8.0. For the equilibrium between On and Off states, the K(T) value was the same for all actin-Tm species; however, the K(T) value of actin-Tm-troponin at pCa 5 was 50% less for AS-alpha-Tm E40K than for AS-alpha-Tm and AS-alpha-Tm E54K. K(b), the ""closed"" to ""blocked"" equilibrium constant, was the same for all tropomyosin species. The E40K mutation reduced the affinity of tropomyosin for actin by 1.74-fold, but only when in the On state (in the presence of S-1). In contrast the E54K mutation reduced affinity by 3.5-fold only in the Off state. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements of AS-alpha-Tm showed that domain 3, assigned to the N terminus of tropomyosin, was strongly destabilized by both mutations. Additionally with AS-alpha-Tm E54K, we observed a unique new domain at 55 degrees C accounting for 25% of enthalpy indicating stabilization of part of the tropomyosin. The disease-causing mechanism of the E40K mutation may be accounted for by destabilization of the On state of the thin filaments; however, the E54K mutation has a more complex effect on tropomyosin structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W2088882951,"Various animals naturally switch to considerable periods of around-the-clock activity with no apparent ill effects. Such plasticity in overt circadian rhythms might be observed because the clock is masked by the influence of external factors, is uncoupled from behavioral outputs, or results from genuine plasticity in the clock machinery. We studied honeybees in which plasticity in circadian rhythms is socially modulated and associated with the division of labor. We confirm that ""nurse"" bees care for the brood around-the-clock even when experiencing a light:dark illumination regime. However, nurses transferred from the hive to individual cages in constant conditions have robust circadian rhythms in locomotor activity with an onset of activity at the subjective morning. These data indicate that circadian rhythmicity in nurses depends on their environment, and suggest that some clockwork components were entrained even in nurses active around the clock while in the hive. Brain oscillations in transcript abundance for the putative clock genes Period, Cryptochrome-m, Cycle, and Timeout were attenuated or totally suppressed in nurses as compared to behaviorally rhythmic foragers, irrespective of the illumination regime. These findings provide the first support for the hypothesis that natural plasticity in circadian rhythms is associated with reorganization of the internal clockwork."
https://openalex.org/W1963528850,"Background Increased activity of single ventricular L-type Ca2+-channels (L-VDCC) is a hallmark in human heart failure. Recent findings suggest differential modulation by several auxiliary β-subunits as a possible explanation. Methods and Results By molecular and functional analyses of human and murine ventricles, we find that enhanced L-VDCC activity is accompanied by altered expression pattern of auxiliary L-VDCC β-subunit gene products. In HEK293-cells we show differential modulation of single L-VDCC activity by coexpression of several human cardiac β-subunits: Unlike β1 or β3 isoforms, β2a and β2b induce a high-activity channel behavior typical of failing myocytes. In accordance, β2-subunit mRNA and protein are up-regulated in failing human myocardium. In a model of heart failure we find that mice overexpressing the human cardiac CaV1.2 also reveal increased single-channel activity and sarcolemmal β2 expression when entering into the maladaptive stage of heart failure. Interestingly, these animals, when still young and non-failing (“Adaptive Phase”), reveal the opposite phenotype, viz: reduced single-channel activity accompanied by lowered β2 expression. Additional evidence for the cause-effect relationship between β2-subunit expression and single L-VDCC activity is provided by newly engineered, double-transgenic mice bearing both constitutive CaV1.2 and inducible β2 cardiac overexpression. Here in non-failing hearts induction of β2-subunit overexpression mimicked the increase of single L-VDCC activity observed in murine and human chronic heart failure. Conclusions Our study presents evidence of the pathobiochemical relevance of β2-subunits for the electrophysiological phenotype of cardiac L-VDCC and thus provides an explanation for the single L-VDCC gating observed in human and murine heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2010475622,"Genetic factors are considered to play an important role in drug dependence/addiction including the development of drug dependence and relapse. With the use of a model of drug self-administration in mutant mice, several specific genes and proteins have been identified as potentially important in the development of drug dependence. In contrast, little is known about the role of specific genes in enduring vulnerability to relapse, a clinical hallmark of drug addiction. Using a mouse model of reinstatement, which models relapse of drug-seeking behavior in addicts, we provide evidence that a partial reduction in the expression of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) potentiates methamphetamine (METH) self-administration, enhances motivation to take METH, increases vulnerability to drug-primed reinstatement, and prolongs cue-induced reinstatement of extinguished METH-seeking behavior. In contrast, there was no significant difference in novelty responses, METH-stimulated hyperlocomotion and locomotor sensitization, food-reinforced operant behavior and motivation, or reinstatement of food-seeking behavior between GDNF heterozygous knockout mice and wild-type littermates. These findings suggest that GDNF may be associated with enduring vulnerability to reinstatement of METH-seeking behavior and a potential target in the development of therapies to control relapse."
https://openalex.org/W2024957709,"Biological functions are governed by thermodynamics, and animals regulate their body temperature to optimise cellular performance and to avoid harmful extremes. The capacity to sense environmental and internal temperatures is a prerequisite for the evolution of thermoregulation. However, the mechanisms that enable ectothermic vertebrates to sense heat remain unknown. The recently discovered thermal characteristics of transient receptor potential ion channels (TRP) render these proteins suitable to act as temperature sensors. Here we test the hypothesis that TRPs are present in reptiles and function to control thermoregulatory behaviour. We show that the hot-sensing TRPV1 is expressed in a crocodile (Crocodylus porosus), an agamid (Amphibolurus muricatus) and a scincid (Pseudemoia entrecasteauxii) lizard, as well as in the quail and zebrafinch (Coturnix chinensis and Poephila guttata). The TRPV1 genes from all reptiles form a unique clade that is delineated from the mammalian and the ancestral Xenopus sequences by an insertion of two amino acids. TRPV1 and the cool-sensing TRPM8 are expressed in liver, muscle (transversospinalis complex), and heart tissues of the crocodile, and have the potential to act as internal thermometer and as external temperatures sensors. Inhibition of TRPV1 and TRPM8 in C. porosus abolishes the typically reptilian shuttling behaviour between cooling and heating environments, and leads to significantly altered body temperature patterns. Our results provide the proximate mechanism of thermal selection in terrestrial ectotherms, which heralds a fundamental change in interpretation, because TRPs provide the mechanism for a tissue-specific input into the animals' thermoregulatory response."
https://openalex.org/W2025943806,"Human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type I Rex and p30 are both RNA binding regulatory proteins. Rex is a protein that interacts with a responsive element and stimulates nuclear export of incompletely spliced viral RNAs thereby increasing production of virus particles. In contrast, p30 is involved in the nuclear retention of the tax/rex mRNA leading to inhibition of virus expression and possible establishment of viral latency. How these two proteins, with apparent opposite functions, integrate in the viral replication cycle is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Rex and p30 form ribonucleoprotein ternary complexes onto specific viral mRNA. Our results explain the selective nuclear retention of tax/rex but not other viral mRNAs by p30. Whereas p30 suppresses Rex expression, it did not affect Rex-mediated nuclear export of RNA containing the Rex response element. In contrast, Rex was able to counteract p30-mediated suppression of viral expression and restore cytoplasmic tax/rex mRNA and Tax protein expression. Together, our data demonstrate a complex regulatory mechanism of antagonizing post-transcriptional regulators evolved by human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type I to allow a vigilant control of viral gene expression.

Nature. 1996; 380: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Rex is a RNA-binding post-transcriptional regulator that binds specifically to its cis-acting target sequence, the Rex response element (RxRE), present at the 3′-end of all viral mRNA (10Seiki M. Inoue J. Hidaka M. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7124-7128Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Rex possesses a nuclear export signal, which allows it to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm of the host cells in a CRM1-dependent pathway (11Hakata Y. Umemoto T. Matsushita S. Shida H. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6602-6607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, Rex selectively exports the unspliced (gag/pol) and incompletely spliced (env) viral mRNA from nucleus to the cytoplasm, thereby increasing the expression of structural and enzymatic proteins and formation of progeny virus (12Hidaka M. Inoue J. Yoshida M. Seiki M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Two additional viral proteins, HBZ and p30, are involved in negative regulation of virus expression and replication (13Satou Y. Yasunaga J. Yoshida M. Matsuoka M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 14Gaudray G. Gachon F. Basbous J. Biard-Piechaczyk M. Devaux C. Mesnard J.M. J.

The HTLV basic leucine zipper protein, HBZ, is a naturally encoded antisense, which has been shown to interfere with Tax-mediated viral transcription. Studies have shown that p30 interacts with CREB-binding protein CBP/p300 and differentially modulates cAMP-responsive element (CRE) and the Tax-responsive element-mediated transcription (16Zhang W. Nisbet J.W. Bartoe J.T. Ding W. Lairmore M.D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11270-11277Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). HTLV-I p30 is a nuclear/nucleolar resident protein that is directly or indirectly associated with viral RNA, but unlike Rex, it is a non-shuttling protein (17Ghorbel S. Sinha-Datta U. Dundr M. Brown M. Franchini G. Nicot C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37150-37158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Enforced expression of p30 blocks the export of tax/rex mRNA to the cytoplasm, resulting in down-regulation of the positive regulators Tax and Rex and suppression of virus replication (15Nicot C. Dundr M. Johnson J.M. Fullen J.R. Alonzo N. Fukumoto R. Princler G.L. Derse D. Misteli T. Franchini G. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 31Younis I. Khair L.

Thus, Rex and p30 apparently act in conflicting ways: Rex increases virus expression/production, whereas p30 inhibits viral gene expression and may promote latency. In this study, we demonstrate that p30 specifically forms complexes with Rex in experiments in vivo and in vitro.We found that the region located between amino acids 131 and 164 of p30 encompasses the Rex binding site. We also found p30-Rex interactions are markedly increased by the presence of viral mRNAs and that p30 fails to interact with a Rex mutant unable to interact with the RxRE, suggesting that these proteins form specific RNA-protein complexes. The amounts of Rex and p30 protein complexes considerably decreased when these proteins were co-expressed in the presence of an mRNA containing the RxRE only and not the p30RE. This construct mimics the gag/pol and env viral mRNAs, because we have previously shown that these mRNA do not contain the p30 RE but possess RxRE. Interestingly, the presence of both response elements in a single mRNA vector, similar to the tax/rex viral mRNA, increased p30-Rex protein complex formation. Together our results explain the specificity of p30 for the retention of tax/rex but not other viral mRNAs to the nucleus. Although p30 reduces Rex expression, it has no significant effect on the ability of Rex to shuttle mRNA out of the nucleus. In contrast, we found that Rex partially hampers p30-mediated viral repression by rescuing the cytoplasmic export of tax/rex mRNA and increasing Tax expression to permit a steady low level of virus expression required for T-cell transformation. All together our data shed light on a novel mechanism by which the specificity of p30-mediated retention for the tax/rex mRNA can be achieved and how these two viral proteins, Rex and p30, with opposite functions are integrated in the control of HTLV-I virus expression. Cell Culture—293T and COS-7 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Mediatech Inc., Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Atlas Biologicals, Fort Collins, CO) and of 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100 μg of streptomycin/ml, and 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen). Plasmid Constructs—p30 and its truncated mutants were generated by PCR and cloned into a modified pMH vector (Roche Applied Sciences) to create an in-frame 3xHA tag. p30RE/RxRE was cloned in pcDNA3.1(-) vector (Invitrogen) in between XbaI-EcoRI sites. The p30RE/RxRE was mutated for the Rex ATG and hence does not express Rex. Other constructs pcRex, pcRexlys, HTLV-LTR-Luc, pBST, pHTLV-XMT (wild-type provirus), pHTLV-Rex1L (provirus mutated for Rex), Rex-GST, pCMV-Tax, p30 truncated mutants, RLTK-taxrex, and RLTK-p21rex have been previously reported (15Nicot C.

In Vitro Binding—To determine the in vitro binding between p30 with Rex, fusion protein Rex-GST and in vitro translated p30-HA were used. The Rex-GST was expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta cells (Novagen) with 10 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h. The bacteria were harvested, pelleted, resuspended in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, ruptured by mild sonication, and solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant containing the soluble fusion protein was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose bead slurry (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing in PBS, the Rex-GST was eluted using 10 mm reduced glutathione. HTLV-I p30-HA was in vitro transcribed and translated from the T7 promoter of pMH vector using the TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation kit (Promega, Madison, WI). The in vitro translated p30-HA was mixed with 100 ng of purified Rex-GST or GST control in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6/50 mm NaCl/0.5 mm EDTA/5 mm MgCl2/0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% glycerol) containing 2.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and complete protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics, Germany) and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The Rex-GST and the GST were immunoprecipitated using the anti-GST goat polyclonal antibody (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. After adding 20 μl of protein G-agarose, the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitated complex was washed two times with the binding buffer with protease inhibitors. The components of the complexes were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE and detected by Western immunoblot assay using HRP-conjugated monoclonal antibody 3F10 (Roche Diagnostics, Germany). Co-immunoprecipitation and in Vivo Binding of p30 and Rex—293T cells (2.5 × 106 cells/10-cm dishes) were transfected with 5 μg of each plasmids (p30-HA and pcRex) using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (Invitrogen). 36 h post-transfection cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5; 150 mm NaCl; 1% Nonidet P-40; 0.5% sodium deoxycholate; 0.1% SDS) containing complete protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics). Cell lysates were prepared by centrifuging at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of cell lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μg of anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody 12CA5 (Roche Diagnostics). After adding 20 μl of protein G-agarose, the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The immunoprecipitated complexes were washed three times with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay at 4 °C. The components of the complexes were resolved on 12% or 15% SDS-PAGE and detected by Western immunoblot assay using anti-Rex polyclonal antibody. Western Blot Assays—For Western immunoblot assays, 50 μg of protein lysates were electrophoresed through 12 or 15% SDS-PAGE. Fractionated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, MA). Proteins were detected with the appropriate primary antibody followed by an anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG-HRP-conjugated donkey antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Blots were developed using chemiluminescent detection system (Pierce). Immunofluorescence Assays—COS cells were transfected with 1 μg of green fluorescent protein-fused p30 or its truncated mutants using Effectene transfection reagent. Forty hours post-transfection cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and washed with 1× PBS. The slides were mounted, and images of green fluorescence were captured using a Nikon EFD3 microscope (Boyce Scientific, St Louis, MO) and a Nikon camera with an Eplan 100× (160/0.17) objective. Imaging medium Slowfade used was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Acquisition software, Image-ProExpress version IV, was from Media Cybernetics (Silver Spring, MD). Pictures presented in this study are representative of a large number of cells observed in three or more independent transfection experiments. Luciferase Assays—293T cells were transfected using Effectene (Qiagen) with 0.5 μg of HTLV-LTR-luc, 2.5 μg of the HTLV proviral clone pBST, with or without 0.5 μg of p30-HA or p30 mutants. 36 h post-transfection, cells were washed with 1× PBS and lysed in 1× luciferase lysis buffer. The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the relative luciferase units were measured using the luciferase assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega). CAT Assays—293T (1 × 106 cells/6-cm dishes) were transfected using Effectene (Qiagen) with 1 μg of pCMV-XRE-CAT with or without 0.5 μg of pcRex along with increasing amount (0.1-0.5 μg of plasmid) of p30-HA. 48 h post-transfection, the cells were harvested and lysed, and production of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) proteins was measured by CAR-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Roche Applied Science). Real-time Reverse Transcription-PCR—Cytoplasmic RNAs were extracted from 293T transfected with p30RE-RxRE (1 μg) along with p30 (2 μg) and increasing amounts of pcRex plasmid (0.5, 1.0, and 2 μg). After DNase treatment the RNA was reverse transcribed, and the resulting cDNA was analyzed by real-time PCR using specific primers for tax-rex message (LTR2 and RPX4) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The authenticity of the PCR products was verified by melting curve analysis. Interaction between HTLV-I Post-transcriptional Regulators p30 and Rex—Because HTLV-I p30 and Rex are nuclear/nucleolar-resident proteins, we tested if they interacted. Bacterially expressed GST-Rex fusion protein was purified and incubated with in vitro translated HA-tagged p30. Purified GST was used as a negative control. Antibody to GST efficiently immunoprecipitated p30-HA in the presence of GST-Rex only suggesting interactions between these two viral proteins (Fig. 1A). These data were specific to p30, because in vitro translated c-Myb did not interact with GST-Rex using the same experimental conditions (Fig. 1B). To confirm interactions from transfected cells, Rex and p30-HA expression vectors were co-transfected in 293T cells. Thirty hours later cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-HA 12CA5 antibody and Western blot with an anti-Rex rabbit anti serum. Consistent with our in vitro results, Rex was immunoprecipitated with HA antibody only when co-expressed with p30-HA (Fig. 1C). Similar levels of p30 and Rex protein expression were confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1C). A control mouse IgG did not immunoprecipitate Rex (data not shown). These findings establish interactions between HTLV-I Rex and p30 proteins. Although the Rex-expression vector used here could produce low levels of the p21Rex, the latter was never found to interact with p30 suggesting that p30-Rex interactions may occur at the amino terminus of Rex (data not shown). We next used two truncated mutants corresponding to the amino terminus and the carboxyl terminus of p30 to delineate the region within p30 responsible for binding to Rex (Fig. 2A). Our results showed that p30ΔN280, but not p30ΔC300, efficiently interacted with Rex upon transfection of 293T cells (Fig. 2B). The lack of p30ΔC300 binding to Rex is likely independent from the fact that p30ΔC300 was expressed at lower levels than p30ΔN280, because full-length p30 and p30ΔC300 were expressed at similar levels, yet the former interacted with Rex efficiently and the latter did not. Together these results suggest that the Rex binding site reside in the carboxyl terminus of p30. To further delineate the binding site several additional mutants were constructed and co-expressed along with Rex in 293T cells. Immunoprecipitation assays defined Rex binding site between amino acid 131 (N400) and 164 (N500) of p30 (Fig. 2C). Immunofluorescence assay using green fluorescent protein-fused truncated p30 proteins revealed that p30, p30ΔC300, and p30ΔN280 predominantly localize in the nucleolus, whereas p30ΔN400 and p30ΔN500 are predominantly excluded from the nucleolus (Fig. 2D). The fact that p30ΔN500 does not interact with Rex cannot be attributed to the fact that it is excluded from the nucleolus, because p30ΔN400 having similar localization interacted with rex. Also p30ΔC300 localizes exactly like the full-length p30 but does not interact with rex.FIGURE 2Mapping of p30-Rex interaction domain.

Although interactions between p30 and Rex were detected in the absence of any other viral proteins (Fig. 3A, lane 4); the presence of the pBST significantly increased or stabilized the amounts of p30-Rex complexes (Fig. 3A, lane 8). Levels of p30-HA expressed and immunoprecipitated were comparable (Fig. 3A). The increased amount of Rex immunoprecipitated in the presence of p30 and pBST was specific, because similar levels of Rex were expressed in the absence or the presence of the pBST (Fig. 3A). p30-Rex Complexes Are Stabilized by Viral RNA but Not Tax Expression—The above result suggested that p30-Rex interactions were strengthen by co-expression of another viral protein or by the presence of viral mRNAs. In addition to p30 or Rex, the Tax oncoprotein is also present in the nucleus. However, results indicated that p30-Rex protein complexes were not influenced upon co-transfection of a vector expressing Tax (Fig. 3B), suggesting that Tax does not significantly affect the formation of p30-Rex complexes. Therefore, we investigated potential contribution of viral RNAs. Lysates from cells transfected with p30-HA and Rex were mixed with total RNA extracted from 293T mock transfected control cells or 293T transfected with HTLV-I molecular clone. Addition of viral RNAs isolated from pBST-transfected cells increased/stabilized p30-Rex interactions 3.4-fold over RNA control isolated from mock transfected 293T cells (Fig. 3C). These experiments clearly established that the presence of viral mRNA increases or stabilizes the formation of p30-Rex complexes. To further investigate whether the viral RNA become an integral part of the complex or just facilitate interactions, we treated preformed complexes with RNase. We found that RNase treatment decreased complexes formation by 4.5-fold compare with untreated samples (Fig. 3D). These data demonstrate that the RNA is part of the complex and is required to maintain a strong interaction between p30 and Rex. RNA Binding Domain of Rex Is Required for p30-Rex Interactions—Having established that viral mRNAs increase p30-Rex complex formation and knowing that Rex interacts directly with the viral RxRE mRNA sequence, we asked if Rex RNA binding activity is required for interactions with p30. We used a previously characterized Rex mutant in which six arginines involved in RNA binding have been mutated to lysines. This mutant, known as RexLys, was shown previously to have the same cellular localization as the wild-type Rex but to be selectively defective in RNA binding (19Hamaia S. Casse H. Gazzolo L. Duc D.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8514-8521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although p30-Rex interactions were readily detected in transfected 293T cells, RexLys failed to interact with p30-HA in the absence or in the presence of pBST (Fig. 4, A and B). These results indicate that the Rex RNA binding domain is required for Rex to form a complex with p30 and suggest that either Rex RNA binding is required for interactions with p30 or that p30 interacts within the RNA binding domain of Rex (Fig. 5A). We thought that expression of an RNA carrying the p30 response element but lacking the RxRE would allow us to discriminate between these two hypotheses. We have previously described reporter vectors, RL-TK-tax/rex, carrying the p30 response element and lacking the RxRE (referred to as p30RE hereafter) (15Nicot C. Dundr M. Johnson J.M. Fullen J.R. Alonzo N. Fukumoto R. Princler G.L. Derse D. Misteli T. Franchini G. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and RLTK-p21rex, lacking both the p30RE and RxRE. These vectors do not have any open reading frame for viral proteins. We hypothesized that expression of RL-TK-tax/rex in trans, would indicate whether p30-RNA interactions (direct or indirect) may play a role in the formation of p30-Rex complexes. RL-TK-tax/rex vector was expressed along with p30-HA and Rex (Fig. 5B). Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis revealed a dose-dependent increase in the amounts of p30-Rex complex formation with increasing amounts of p30RE expression vector (Fig. 5B). In contrast, when increasing amounts of RLTK-p21rex was co-expressed in trans along with p30-HA and Rex, immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis revealed no change in the amounts of p30-Rex complex formation (Fig. 5C). These data confirm that the increase in p30-Rex complexes in presence of RLTK-tax/rex is not due to interaction with nonspecific RNAs or plasmid DNA, but specific to the tax/rex mRNA. These data also suggest that p30 bound onto RNA efficiently recruits Rex even in the absence of an Rex response element, RxRE. Thus, Rex RNA binding is not absolutely required and consequently these data suggest that p30 interacts within the Rex RNA binding domain, which explains why RexLys is unable to form complexes with p30. This is also consistent with the fact that p21Rex, which lacks the amino-terminal RNA binding domain of Rex, failed to interact with p30 in our assays.FIGURE 5p30-Rex complex formation is enhanced in presence of p30 responsive element (p30RE). A, models that explain lack of interaction between p30 and rexLys. 293T cells were transfected with 5 μg each of p30-HA and Rex with increasing amounts of RLTK-taxrex (used as p30RE) (B) or RLTKp21rex (used as a negative control, which does not contain p30RE) (C). p30 was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA mouse antibody (12CA5), and immunocomplex containing Rex was detected by immunoblotting using an anti-Rex rabbit polyclonal antibody. The amount of p30 immunoprecipitated with 12CA5 was confirmed with anti-HA rat antibody 3F10-HRP. Equal amounts of Rex expression were confirmed by Western blot analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Rex and p30 Differentially Associate onto Viral mRNA—We have previously demonstrated that p30 specifically retains the tax/rex mRNA in the nucleus without affecting Rex-mediated nuclear export of the gag/pol and env mRNA (15Nicot C. Dundr M. Johnson J.M. Fullen J.R. Alonzo N. Fukumoto R. Princler G.L. Derse D. Misteli T. Franchini G. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To understand at the molecular level whether p30-Rex interactions may regulate viral RNA export we used two constructs expressing chimeric mRNA with either the RxRE only (pCMVXRE-CAT) (22Liu B. Hong S. Tang Z. Yu H. Giam C.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), to mimic gag/pol mRNA, or a construct carrying both the RxRE and the p30RE (p30RE/RxRE see “Experimental Procedures”) to mimic tax/rex mRNA. In the latter, the ATG of Rex was mutated, and we confirmed that p30RE/RxRE did not express Rex upon transfection (see Fig. 8C). These vectors were expressed in increasing amounts in 293T cells along with Rex and p30, and complex formation was analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation assays. The amounts of p30-Rex complexes significantly decreased with the chimera RNA containing the RxRE only (Fig. 6A). These findings can be explained by the fact that Rex has a high affinity for its RxRE, and whenever Rex is bound to RNA its p30 binding domain is no longer accessible preventing p30-Rex protein complex formation. These results are fully consistent with previous reports and explain the absence of the effect of p30 on gag/pol and env viral mRNAs. In clear contrast, we found a dose-dependent increase in the amounts of p30-Rex complexes when the chimera RNA containing both the RxRE and the p30RE were present (Fig. 6B). These results are in agreement with the view that p30-Rex complexes are enhanced when p30 is bound to its responsive element. Together these data offer a rationale explanation for the specificity of the p30-Rex complexes formation on the tax/rex mRNA.FIGURE 6p30-Rex complexes specifically bind mRNAs carrying the p30RE/RxRE. A, 293T cells were transfected with 5 μg each of p30-HA and Rex with increasing amounts of pCMVXRE-CAT (which is known to contain the RxRE). p30 was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA mouse antibody (12CA5), and immunocomplex containing Rex was detected by immunoblotting using an anti-Rex rabbit polyclonal antibody. The amount of p30 immunoprecipitated with 12CA5 was confirmed with anti-HA rat antibody 3F10-HRP. Equal amounts of Rex expression were confirmed by Western blot analysis. B, 293T cells were transfected with 5 μg each of p30-HA and Rex with increasing amounts of p30RE/RxRE. p30 was immunoprecipitated with 12CA5, and immunocomplex containing Rex was detected using anti-Rex rabbit polyclonal antibody. The amount of p30 immunoprecipitated with 12CA5 was confirmed with 3F10-HRP. Equal amounts of Rex expression were confirmed by Western blot analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) p30 Does Not Affect Rex-mediated RNA Export—Because p30 and Rex interacted and Rex is a shuttling protein, whereas p30 is not, we investigated the effect of p30 expression on the ability of Rex to export mRNA. For these experiments we used a previously characterized reporter construct (pCMVXRE-CAT) carrying a CAT gene and the RxRE. In agreement with previous reports, we found that CAT activity was only detected in the presence of Rex. However, in our experimental conditions CAT activity was not significantly influenced by increasing amounts of p30 (Fig. 7). These results indicate that p30 cannot interfere with the ability of Rex to interact with its RxRE and the ability of Rex to export nuclear RNA to the cytoplasm, unless a p30 response element is present as is the case for the tax/rex mRNA. These results are consistent with our previous observations that p30 does not directly influence cytoplasmic expression of the gag-pol mRNA. Rex Partially Inhibits p30 Function and Rescues tax/rex mRNA Cytoplasmic Export—To determine biological relevance of p30-Rex interaction in virus expression, we compared ability of p30 to inhibit HTLV-I molecular clones, pHTLV-XMT (wild-type provirus) and its counterpart pHTLV-REXIL (provirus mutated for Rex). We used a previously established reporter assay in which expression of an HTLV-I-LTR-luciferase is transfected along with an HTLV-I molecular clone. The latter express Tax, which transactivates the LTR-inducing luciferase expression. Expression of p30 efficiently prevents nuclear export of tax/rex RNA thereby resulting in a decrease in luciferase activity, which is monitored as a surrogate marker for p30-mediated post-transcriptional inhibition of HTLV-I replication. Although exogenous p30 suppressed both molecular clones in a dose-dependent manner, our data clearly indicate that p30 has a more potent effect whenever Rex is absent (pHTLV-REXIL, 50% difference, Fig. 8A). This result suggests that Rex somehow opposes p30-mediated viral inhibition. This observation was due to the absence of Rex and not other genetic problems, because exogenous Rex complemented the defect (Fig. 8B). To further understand the inhibitory effect of Rex on p30 we transfected the p30RE/RxRE along with p30 and Rex in 293T cells. Consistent with previous studies real-time quantification of cytoplasmic tax/rex mRNA revealed a decrease when p30 was expressed (Fig. 8C). Under similar experimental conditions Rex partially rescued p30-mediated nuclear retention and increased cytoplasmic tax/rex mRNA (Fig. 8C). In addition Western blot analysis of the Tax revealed that p30 inhibited the expression of Tax from p30RE/RxRE, but addition of Rex was able to partially rescue the inhibitory effect of p30 (Fig. 8D). Together our results demonstrate that HTLV-I has evolved an elegant balanced negative feedback loop whereby Rex limits the p30 inhibitory functions while p30 limits Rex expression. The expression of HTLV-I virus particles is regulated by viral regulatory proteins, which operate at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Post-transcriptional regulators Rex and p30 allow the nucleocytoplasmic export of unspliced and singly spliced mRNAs and the nuclear retention of the tax/rex mRNA, respectively. Hence, these viral proteins, expressed in the nuclear/nucleolar compartments, exert positive and negative regulatory functions, respectively. In the present study, we found that Rex and p30 form specific complexes and further mapped the Rex binding domain to amino acid residues 131-164 of p30. Interestingly, we found that the p30-Rex complexes are considerably increased in the presence of viral mRNAs and demonstrate that the viral RNA is part of the complex and required for stabilization. We then asked whether direct RNA binding activity of Rex was required to form protein complexes with p30. To that end we used a Rex mutant, RexLys, which was previously shown to have the same cellular localization as the wild-type Rex but is defective in RNA binding activity. Although interactions between p30 and wild-type Rex were readily detected, RexLys failed to interact with p30 in the absence or in the presence of viral mRNAs. These results indicated that the Rex-RNA interaction domain is required for Rex to form a complex with p30. These results could be interpreted either that direct Rex RNA binding is required or that p30 interacts within the RNA binding domain of Rex, which is mutated in RexLys (Fig. 5A). To test between these two hypotheses, we co-expressed Rex and p30 along with a chimeric mRNA containing the p30 response element but lacking the Rex response element, RxRE. It is expected that if direct Rex-RNA binding is required no p30-Rex complexes would be found. In contrast, under such experimental conditions p30 efficiently bound to Rex, therefore suggesting that Rex-RNA binding is dispensable and p30 likely interacts within the RNA binding domain of Rex. Furthermore, p30 was unable to impair Rex binding to its response element in experiments using the Rex RxRE-CAT reporter assay. These data further indicated that p30 cannot efficiently interfere with the ability of Rex to bind RNA unless p30 itself is also bound onto its response element. The findings presented here are essential to understand HTLV-I replication cycle and comprehend why gag/pol and env mRNAs are not affected by p30, whereas the tax/rex mRNA is specifically retained in the nucleus. In the case of gag/pol and env mRNAs the absence of the p30 response element in these RNAs precludes p30 from strong interactions with Rex and therefore p30 cannot oppose Rex shuttling activity of these viral RNA. Another intriguing finding of the present study is that p30 and Rex interactions are considerably increased/stabilized when both the p30- and Rex-responsive elements are present in a single RNA. This RNA mimics the viral tax/rex RNA, and our results suggest that Rex is able to partially counteract p30-repressive effects. In turn, such a mechanism of regulation allows a vigilant control of viral genes expression. p30 decreases viral expression enough to prevent immune detection, but Rex guarantees that a low basal expression is maintained to produce little Tax protein essential for early stages of T-cell transformation and sustained expression of p30. Whether or not p30-Rex interactions are regulated through post-transcriptional modifications or involve other cellular factors is currently under investigation. Our experiments consistently showed that only a fraction of tax/rex mRNA retained by p30 can be rescued by Rex. We believe the virus has evolved a strategy to maintain low virus expression and hide from immune recognition to thus establish viral persistence as a key process for HTLV-I survival in the host. How does Rex rescue p30-bound tax/rex RNA? A possible explanation would be that Rex induces conformational changes in p30 or in local RNA structure releasing p30 and allowing export of tax/rex mRNA to the cytoplasm. On the other hand Rex may simply recruit a (or several) limiting cellular factor that antagonizes the strong p30 retention mechanisms (Fig. 9). These hypotheses are currently being investigated. A striking feature of HTLV-I provirus, as opposed to HIV, is the presence of the Rex response element in all viral mRNA, although only two of them, gag/pol and env mRNA, are Rex-dependent for their export to the cytoplasm. Because the doubly spliced tax/rex mRNA can be exported independently of Rex, why then would it retain this export signal? In fact, Rev RRE is absent from HIV tat mRNA. Part of the answer may lie in the fact that in infected cells HIV replicates actively while HTLV-I is mainly latent in vivo. Although it is critical for HTLV-I to reduce its expression to evade immune detection and clearance, complete or “true” latency would not benefit the virus, which needs some Tax expression to alter cell cycle checkpoints (20Neuveut C.

Ubiquitination is a process whereby a small protein called ubiquitin (Ub) conjugates to its target protein. Monoubiquitination occurs through the isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine (Gly-76) residue on Ub and the ɛ-amino group of the lysine (Lys) side chain in the target protein by multisteps that are activated sequentially by E1 (Ub-activating), E2 (Ub-conjugating), and E3 (Ub-ligase) enzymes (19Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar). The addition of one or more Ub moieties to the Ub on the target protein results in di- or polyubiquitination. Ub, one of the major components in LBs, is an essentially required component in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) (20Lowe J. Blanchard A. Morrell K. Lennox G. Reynolds L. Billett M. Landon M. Mayer R.J. J. Pathol. 1988; 155: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 21Sakamoto M. Uchihara T. Hayashi M. Nakamura A. Kikuchi E. Mizutani T. Mizusawa H. Hirai S. Exp. Neurol. 2002; 177: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). UPS is an intracellular proteolytic system that degrades its targeted proteins (22Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar, 23Layfield R. Cavey J.R. Lowe J. Aging Res. Rev. 2003; 2: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To date, many studies suggest that malfunction of protein degradation linked to UPS plays an important role in the pathogenesis of PD (23Layfield R. Cavey J.R. Lowe J. Aging Res. Rev. 2003; 2: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 24Snyder H. Wolozin B. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 425-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A protein tagged by a chain of four or more Ubs, instead of a single Ub, is targeted for proteasomal degradation (25Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). Specifically, Lys48-linked poly-Ub chains instead of Lys63-linked poly-Ub chains are considered to be a proteasomal degradation signal (22Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar, 23Layfield R. Cavey J.R. Lowe J. Aging Res. Rev. 2003; 2: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In vivo, the aggregation of α-syn is enhanced by Lys63-linked ubiquitination (26Liu Y. Fallon L. Lashuel H.A. Liu Z. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Cell. 2002; 111: 209-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Also, both wild type α-syn and mutant α-syn, incubated with rabbit reticulocyte Fraction IIA in vitro, increase Lys63-linked Ub-conjugate formation with the mutants being more effective (27Doss-Pepe E.W. Chen L. Madura K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16619-16624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The increased Ub-conjugates are detectable by anti-Ub antibodies, but not by anti-α-syn antibody, indicating that α-syn may function in regulating assembly of Ub-Lys63 chains (27Doss-Pepe E.W. Chen L. Madura K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16619-16624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigate the possible role of phosphorylation of α-syn at Ser129 in the biogenesis of LBs using a cellular model. Coexpression of S129D α-syn, on which serine 129 was converted to aspartate to mimic phosphorylated α-syn, and Ub resulted in an increase in Ub-conjugates and cytoplasmic ubiquitinated aggregates compared with the coexpression of WT α-syn with Ub. We also observed that coexpression of S129D α-syn and Ub caused the formation of ubiquitinated inclusions in neuro2a cells. Furthermore, in neuro2a cells cotransfected with K63R mutant Ub, S129D α-syn failed to increase the Ub-conjugates or form ubiquitinated inclusions. Compared with WT α-syn, S129D α-syn increased the ubiquitination of itself when coexpressed with Ub. Additionally, S129D α-syn formed more aggregates in neuro2a cells treated with H2O2 and serum deprivation than WT α-syn. Our data may provide insight into a molecular mechanism that links phosphorylation of α-syn and Lys63-linked Ub-conjugates to LB biogenesis.

These products were inserted into the BglII/SalI sites of the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech) and BamHI/XhoI sites of pCDNA3.1/V5-HisB vector (Invitrogen) to construct pEGFPN1-α-SYN (WT) and pCDNA3.1/V5-HisB-α-SYN (WT). Full-length β-SYNUCLEIN cDNA was created by PCR using primers 5′-GAAGATCTGGATGGACGTGTTCATG-3′ and 5′-GCGTCGACAACGCCTCTGGCTCATAC-3′ with a human fetal brain cDNA library (Clontech) as a template and inserted into pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech) via the BglII/SalI sites. UB cDNA was obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR using primers 5′-CTGGATCCACATGCAGATCTTCGTG-3′ and 5′-CATGAATTCTTACCCACCTCTGAGACG-3′ with total RNA extracted from HeLa cells and inserted in-frame into pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences) at BamHI/EcoRI sites. pcDNA4/HisA-UB was created by excising the UB gene at BamHI/EcoRI sites from pGEX-5X-1-UB vector and inserting into pcDNA4-HisA vector (Invitrogen) at BamHI/EcoRI sites. p3XFlag-myc-CMV-24-UB was created by excising the fragments at KpnI/XbaI sites from pcDNA4HisA-UB and inserting into the p3XFlag-myc-CMV-24 vector (Sigma) at KpnI/XbaI sites. The following point mutations of the gene were introduced using site-directed mutagenesis (MutanBEST kit, TAKARA): 1) α-syn phosphomimic mutant (S129D) was created using primers 5′-GATGAGGAAGGGTATCAAGACTAC-3′ and 5′-AGGCATTTCATAAGCCTCATTGTC-3′; 2) α-syn phospho-dead mutant (S129A) was created using primers 5′-GCTGAGGAAGGGTATCAAGACTAC-3′ and 5′-AGGCATTTCATAAGCCTCATTGTC-3′; 3) Ub missense mutation K48R, using primers 5′-AGACAGCTGGAAGATGGACGCACC-3′ and 5′-CCCAGCAAAGATCAACCTCTGCTG-3′; 4) Ub missense mutation K63R, using primers 5′-AGAGAGTCCACCCTGCACCTGGTG-3′ and 5′-CTGGATGTTGTAGTCAGACAGGGT-3′. The fidelity of all constructs was confirmed by sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—Neuro2a cells cultured overnight in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) containing 10% newborn calf serum (Invitrogen) were washed with Opti-MEM and then transiently transfected with expressing plasmids using Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM without serum. The same volume of DMEM containing 10% newborn calf serum was added to the culture media 6 h after transfection. Two days later, the transfected cells were observed by an inverted microscope (Olympus, IX71, Japan) or subjected to fluorescent observation, immunoblot, or coimmunoprecipitation analysis. Immunocytochemistry—Transfected cells grown in chamber slides were washed with PBS, fixed in PBS with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, and then treated with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After blocking in 4% BSA/PBS for 1 h, the cells were incubated with anti-FLAG antibody (1:5000, Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibodies (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature. Then the cells were washed with PBS and incubated with DAPI (Sigma) for 3 min at room temperature. Finally, the cells were observed using an inverted fluorescence microscope. Coimmunoprecipitation—Transfected cells were treated with 10 μm MG132 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) for 12 h, 48 h after transfection. The cells were harvested and sonicated in modified TSPI buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml of aprotinin, 10 μg/ml of leupeptin, 0.5 μm Pefabloc SC, 10 μg/ml of pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 1% Nonidet P-40. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were preincubated with protein G-Sepharose (Roche) for 2 h at 4 °C and then incubated with monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (Roche) for 1 h at 4 °C. After incubation, protein G-Sepharose was used for precipitation. The beads were washed with TSPI buffer four times and then eluted with SDS sample buffer for immunoblot analysis. Immunoblot Analysis—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA). The following primary antibodies were used: monoclonal anti-GFP anti-body (1:5000, Roche), monoclonal anti-V5 antibody (1:500, Invitrogen), monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (1:5000, Sigma), and monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). A sheep anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase antibody (1:5000, Amersham Biosciences) was used as the secondary antibody. The proteins were visualized using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Fractionation Experiments—For Nonidet P-40 soluble or insoluble fractionation experiments, cells were lysed in a modified TSPI buffer. After sonication, cells were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Nonidet P-40-insoluble pellets were dissolved in a buffer containing 1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40. The soluble and insoluble fractions (dissolved by 1% SDS) were subjected to immunoblot analysis using the antibodies previously described. Aggregation Induction—Cells were transfected with various constructs. At 24 h after transfection, the DMEM containing 10% newborn calf serum was replaced with newborn calf serum-free DMEM containing 400 μm H2O2. Cells were cultured for a further 72 h, then washed with PBS, fixed in PBS with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, and then treated with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. After being washed with PBS, cells were incubated with DAPI (Sigma) for 3 min at 4 °C. After incubation, cells were washed with PBS and observed using an inverted fluorescence microscope. Characterization of WT α-Syn, S129D α-Syn, or β-Syn Expressed in Neuro2a Cells—It has been reported that almost 90% of α-syn in LBs is phosphorylated at Ser129 (13Fujiwara H. Hasegawa M. Dohmae N. Kawashima A. Masliah E. Goldberg M.S. Shen J. Takio K. Iwatsubo T. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2002; 4: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To investigate the possible role of Ser129-phosphorylated α-syn in LB biogenesis, we created a mutant form of α-syn in which serine (S) 129 was converted to aspartate (D) to mimic phosphorylated α-syn (S129D) (Fig. 1A). To use enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as a reporter, we generated plasmids expressing EGFP-tagged WT α-syn, S129D α-syn or β-syn (Fig. 1A). To exclude the possible effects of EGFP on the α-syn conformation, we also created plasmids expressing V5-tagged WT α-syn or S129D α-syn (Fig. 1A, bottom). Neuro2a cells were transfected with EGFP, EGFP-tagged WT α-syn, S129D α-syn or β-syn. Cells overexpressing these EGFP-tagged proteins displayed a diffusive distribution in cytoplasm, nuclei, and neurites (Fig. 1, B-E). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested and the total cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-GFP antibody. Expression of all the constructs was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1J). Aggregation of these fusion proteins was not observed in transfected neuro2a cells. Transfection with V5-lacZ, V5-tagged WT, or S129D α-syn was also performed. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested and the soluble and insoluble fractions dissolved with 1% SDS were subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-V5 antibody (Fig. 1K). Aggregation of these fusion proteins was not observed in transfected neuro2a cells. Coexpression of S129D α-Syn and Ub Increases Ub-conjugates and Induces LB-like Structure Formation—To investigate whether the phosphorylation of α-syn at serine 129, which has been linked to the pathogenesis of PD, has effects on UPS, we examined the ubiquitinated proteins in neuro2a cells cotransfected with FLAG-Ub along with EGFP, EGFP-tagged WT α-syn or S129D α-syn. We also examined cells cotransfected with FLAG-Ub along with V5-lacZ, V5-tagged WT α-syn, or S129D α-syn. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were analyzed by immunoblotting or immunofluorescence. Immunoblotting analysis revealed the smear bands of anti-FLAG immunoreactivity that represented the Ub-conjugates. In Nonidet P-40-soluble fractions, coexpression of WT or S129D α-syn with Ub resulted in more Ub-conjugates, especially in the high molecular weight, than coexpression of Ub and EGFP or V5-lacZ (Fig. 2, A and B). In Nonidet P-40-insoluble fractions, S129D α-syn resulted in more Ub-conjugates than WT α-syn (Fig. 2, A and B). As a comparison, the S129A α-syn mutant, where Ser129 was converted to alanine (A) to abolish phosphorylation at this site, was used. Coexpression of S129A α-syn and FLAG-Ub did not contribute to the Ub-conjugate formation compared with coexpression of FLAG-Ub and WT or S129D α-syn (supplemental Fig. S1). However, when using anti-GFP or anti-α-syn antibody, no low migrating bands, compatible with the ubiquitinated α-syn species, were detected in cell lysates (data not shown). The transfected cells were visualized by excitation of EGFP and immunochemistry analysis using the anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 2, C-K, the number of ubiquitinated aggregates per Ub-positive cell was counted and subjected to data analysis. About 50% of Ub-positive cells, in the presence of EGFP and Ub, formed ubiquitinated aggregates. In the presence of WT α-syn and Ub, ubiquitinated aggregates were found in more than 60% of Ub-positive cells. Whereas in the presence of S129D α-syn and Ub, cells with ubiquitinated aggregates increased significantly to ∼80% of Ub-positive cells (Fig. 2L). The quantitative data showed that coexpression of S129D α-syn and Ub significantly increased the number of cells with three or more ubiquitinated aggregates as compared with coexpression of Ub and EGFP or WT α-syn (Fig. 2M). These results are consistent with our immunoblotting results suggesting that phosphorylated α-syn contributes to the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins. Characterization of LB-like Structure Biogenesis Induced by Coexpression of S129D α-Syn and Ub—Neuro2a cells were cotransfected with EGFP-tagged S129D α-syn and FLAG-Ub. Forty-eight hours after transfection, EGFP-tagged S129D α-syn was visualized by excitation of EGFP and FLAG-Ub was visualized by immunocytochemistry analysis using anti-FLAG anti-body. There are different patterns of α-syn intracytoplasmic aggregation in cotransfected cells (Fig. 3, A-T). Some cells contained diffusive or “cloud-like” α-syn fluorescence (Fig. 3, A-D). Occasionally, this diffuse α-syn fluorescence showed a more intense aggregation or a greater tendency to stain an outer rim, whereas Ub was more likely to stain the core (Fig. 3, E-H). Colocalization of α-syn with Ub was found in both large and small aggregates scattered in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, I-L). Two patterns of ubiquitinated inclusions were observed in neuro2a cells: one shows amorphous inclusion with Ub immunoreactivity and α-syn fluorescence (Fig. 3, M-P); another shows well defined colocalization of α-syn with Ub (Fig. 3, Q-T). Effects of S129D α-Syn on Ub-conjugates and LB-like Structure Formation Depend on Lysine 63 on Ub—Ubiquitination of specific proteins that target themselves to proteasomal degradation is believed to be dependent on the conjugation of the poly-Ub chain, which is linked through specific lysines on Ub (22Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). The most prominent sites are the degradation related Lys48 and degradation unrelated Lys63 on Ub. To further investigate whether Lys48 or Lys63 on Ub is involved in the Ub-conjugate formation and why these conjugates escape from proteasomal degradation, we created two mutant forms of Ub on which lysine 48 or 63 was converted to arginine. We examined the ubiquitinated proteins in neuro2a cells cotransfected with K48R or K63R mutant FLAG-Ub together with EGFP, EGFP-tagged WT α-syn, or S129D α-syn for 48 h. Immunoblotting analysis using anti-FLAG antibody showed that coexpression of WT or S129D α-syn with the K48R mutant Ub both resulted in more poly-Ub-conjugates, especially in the high molecular weight, as compared with coexpression of EGFP and K48R mutant Ub (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, in Nonidet P-40 insoluble fractions, S129D α-syn resulted in more Ub-conjugates than WT α-syn. These results are similar to our observations in cells that were cotransfected with WT or S129D α-syn and wild type Ub (Fig. 2A). Coexpression of WT or S129D α-syn with K63R mutant Ub did not contribute to poly-Ub-conjugate formation in either Non-idet P-40-soluble or -insoluble fractions any more than coexpression of EGFP with K63R mutant Ub (Fig. 4B). To further ascertain whether Lys63 on Ub is involved in LB-like structure formation, neuro2a cells were cotransfected with K63R mutant FLAG-Ub along with EGFP, EGFP-tagged WT α-syn, or S129D α-syn. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were visualized by excitation of EGFP and by immunochemistry analysis using anti-FLAG antibody. We found that both WT and S129D α-syn failed to increase the ubiquitinated aggregates or form ubiquitinated inclusions (Fig. 5, A-I). Similar results were observed in neuro2a cells cotransfected with K48R or K63R mutant FLAG-Ub along with V5-lacZ, V5-tagged WT α-syn, or S129D α-syn (Fig. 4, C and D). These results suggest that the contribution of S129D-phosphorylated α-syn to the Ub-conjugates and ubiquitinated inclusions depends on the Lys63 site not the Lys48 site on Ub.FIGURE 5Contribution of S129D α-syn to ubiquitinated inclusions depends upon Lys63 on Ub. A-I, neuro2a cells were cotransfected with K63R mutant FLAG-Ub along with EGFP, EGFP-tagged WT α-syn, or S129D α-syn. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were subjected to fluorescent observation. EGFP and EGFP-tagged proteins (A, D, and G, green) were visualized by excitation of EGFP. Immunocytochemistry analysis for FLAG-Ub (B, E, and H, red) was carried out with anti-FLAG antibody. The nuclei were stained with DAPI (C, F, and I, blue). Bar, 10 μm. These experiments were repeated three times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Phosphorylation of α-Syn at Ser129 Increases Self-modification by Ub—Abundant deposition of α-syn and Ub in LBs may indicate an important role for α-syn-Ub linkage in the pathogenesis of LBs (9Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hasegawa M. Goedert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6469-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (2443) Google Scholar). However, using immunoprecipitation of GFP-tagged proteins followed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody, we did not observe ubiquitinated α-syn in the soluble samples used in Figs. 2A and 4A (data not shown). To further explore a possible role for α-syn-Ub linkage in LB biogenesis, we examined the ubiquitination of α-syn within cells cotransfected with WT FLAG-Ub along with EGFP-tagged WT α-syn or S129D α-syn under the treatment of MG132. Neuro2a cells coexpressing β-syn and Ub were used as a control. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were subsequently treated with MG132 (10 μm) for 12 h. After treatment, cells were harvested and a coimmunoprecipitation assay was performed using anti-GFP antibody. The immunoprecipitants were subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 6, low migrating smeared bands compatible with ubiquitinated α-syn were observed. Smeared bands compatible with ubiquitinated β-syn were not detected (Fig. 6). Based on the apparent molecular mass of α-syn-EGFP (≈47 kDa) and FLAG-Ub (≈18 kDa), the high molecular mass species accounted for as mono-, di-, or tri-FLAG-Ub modified α-syn appear predominantly at the phosphomimic mutant (indicated by arrows in Fig. 6). These results support our earlier findings in this study that α-syn is co-localized with Ub in some of the aggregates. Considering the large amount of Ub-conjugates formed by the expression of S129D α-syn (Fig. 2, A and B), these results also suggest that phosphorylation of α-syn at Ser129 may facilitate the ubiquitination of other proteins as well as itself. Expression of S129D α-Syn Increases α-Syn Aggregate Formation under Oxidative Stress and Serum Deprivation—Lewy neurites, also known as dystrophic neurites, are one of the pathological characteristics of synucleinopathies. We therefore cultured neuro2a cells expressing EGFP, EGFP-tagged WT, or S129D α-syn in serum-free DMEM 24 h after transfection. Seventy-two hours later, the cells were observed using an inverted system microscope (Olympus, IX71, Japan). We observed that some of the surviving intact cells developed long neurites that are similar with the dystrophic neurites in morphous. It has been proposed that oxidative stress is associated with the pathogenesis of PD. A previous study suggests that oxidative stress induces the formation of α-syn inclusions (29Smith W.W. Margolis R.L. Li X. Troncoso J.C. Lee M.K. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Iwatsubo T. Ross C.A. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5544-5552Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To explore whether phosphorylation of α-syn affects self-aggregation under oxidative stress, neuro2a cells were transfected with EGFP, EGFP-tagged WT, or S129D α-syn for 24 h, followed by deprivation of serum and treatment with or without exposure to oxidative stress. Seventy-two hours later, the cells were observed using an inverted system microscope. The surviving cells with intact nuclei were selected for data analysis. We found that neuro2a cells overexpressing EGFP, EGFP-tagged WT, or S129D α-syn formed a few aggregates in the absence of serum (Fig. 7, A-D) with no statistic significance among the cells by quantitative data (Fig. 7J). However, oxidative stress induced the cytoplasmic and neuritic aggregates of α-syn in surviving neuro2a cells (Fig. 7, E-I) with cells overexpressing S129D α-syn forming approximately two times more α-syn aggregates than cells overexpressing WT α-syn (Fig. 7J). These results suggest that Ser129-phosphorylated α-syn may be more prone to aggregation under oxidative stress. Typically, LBs are found in dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, but they are also observed in noradrenergic neurons in other brain regions and the periphe"
https://openalex.org/W2067846353,"l-Histidine decarboxylase (HDC) is the rate-limiting enzyme for histamine synthesis in mammals. Although accumulating evidence has indicated the post-translational processing of HDC, it remains unknown what kinds of proteases are involved. We investigated the processing of HDC in a mouse mastocytoma, P-815, using a lentiviral expression system. HDC was expressed as a 74-kDa precursor form, which is cleaved to yield the 55- and 60-kDa forms upon treatment with butyrate. Alanine-scanning mutations revealed that two tandem aspartate residues (Asp517-Asp518, Asp550-Asp551) are critical for the processing. Treatment with butyrate caused an increase in the enzyme activity of the cells expressing the wild type HDC, but not in the cells expressing the processing-incompetent mutant. An increase in histamine synthesis by butyrate was accompanied by formation of the 55- and 60-kDa form of HDC. In addition, the in vitro translated 74-kDa form of HDC was found to undergo a limited cleavage by purified human caspase-9, whereas the alanine-substituted mutants were not. Processing and enzymatic activation of HDC in P-815 cells was enhanced in the presence of a Zn2+ chelator, TPEN. Although treatment with butyrate and TPEN drastically augmented the protease activity of caspase-3, and -9, no apoptotic cell death was observed. Both enzymatic activation and processing of HDC were completely suppressed by a pan-caspase inhibitor, partially but significantly by a specific inhibitor for caspase-9, but not by a caspase-3 inhibitor. These results suggest that, in P-815 cells, histamine synthesis is augmented through the post-translational cleavage of HDC, which is mediated by caspase-9. l-Histidine decarboxylase (HDC) is the rate-limiting enzyme for histamine synthesis in mammals.

Several groups purified HDC from various sources including a mouse mastocytoma, P-815, indicating that purified HDC is a homodimer consisting of a 53–55-kDa subunit (9Taguchi Y. Watanabe T. Kubota H.

In 1990, Joseph et al. (12Joseph D.R. Sullivan P.M. Wang Y. Kozak C. Fenstermacher D.A. Behrendsen M.E. Zahnow C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 733-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) succeeded in cDNA cloning of rat HDC for the first time, and demonstrated that the HDC cDNA encodes a protein, of which the molecular mass is 74 kDa. Subsequent cDNA cloning from P-815 cells revealed that mouse HDC cDNA also encodes a 74-kDa protein (13Yamamoto J. Yatsunami K. Ohmori E. Sugimoto Y. Fukui T. Katayama T. Ichikawa A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 276: 214-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These results indicate that HDC is initially translated as a 74-kDa form and then converted into the 53–55-kDa form through the post-translational processing. HDC belongs in the fold type I pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme (13Yamamoto J. Yatsunami K. Ohmori E. Sugimoto Y. Fukui T. Katayama T. Ichikawa A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 276: 214-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 14Grishin N.V. Phillips M.A. Goldsmith E.J. Prot. Sci. 1995; 4: 1291-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Although the region around the active lysine residue of HDC shows homology with the other enzymes in this group, such as the aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase and glutamate decarboxylase, the C-terminal 20-kDa region is unique and contains no homologous sequence with any other protein. The role of the post-translational processing was first investigated by comparing the recombinant 53- and 74-kDa form of HDC in various expression systems. In the baculovirus-insect cell expression system, the 74-kDa form with a relatively low activity was recovered in the insoluble fraction, while the 53-kDa form in the soluble fraction (15Yamamoto J. Fukui T. Suzuki K. Tanaka S. Yatsunami K. Ichikawa A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In vitro digestion of the 74-kDa form in the insoluble fraction of the insect cells by porcine pancreatic elastase resulted in liberation of the soluble 53-kDa form, which exhibited a similar characteristics to the purified enzyme (16Tanaka S. Fukui T. Yamamoto J. Shima Y. Kume T. Ohgo M. Ichikawa A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1253: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We also found that the 74-kDa form of HDC is accumulated in the ER in COS-7 cells while the 54-kDa mutant lacking the C-terminal region is in the cytosol (17Suzuki S. Tanaka S. Nemoto K. Ichikawa A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although the 74-kDa form of HDC has neither the N-terminal signal sequence nor hydrophobic membrane anchor, the in vitro translated 74-kDa HDC protein was post-translationally targeted to the microsomal fraction, which was mediated by the C-terminal 20-kDa region (17Suzuki S. Tanaka S. Nemoto K. Ichikawa A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the C-terminal 20-kDa region mediates the ER-targeting of HDC and the membrane-bound 74-kDa form possesses a lower activity than that of the truncated 54-kDa form in the cytosol. Fleming and Wang (18Fleming J.V. Wang T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 686-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) demonstrated that rat 74-kDa form expressed in COS-7 cells is cleaved to multiple forms and that formation of the main 55-kDa form is prevented by mutations at the residues, Ser502, Lys503, and Asp504, whereas these mutations had no effects on the enzyme activity. However, this putative processing site was not found in the primary sequence of mouse and human HDC, and no processed forms were detected in COS-7 cells expressing mouse 74-kDa HDC (17Suzuki S. Tanaka S. Nemoto K. Ichikawa A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The processing site of mouse HDC remains to be clarified, especially in histamine-forming cells. Preparation of specific antibodies against HDC has shed light on the processing patterns of endogenous HDC in various sources. We previously demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of the nascent 35S-labeled HDC that the 74-kDa form is localized in the cytosol and ER while the 53-kDa form in the granule fraction in a rat mast cell line, RBL-2H3 (19Tanaka S. Nemoto K. Yamamura E. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8177-8182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this cell line, histamine synthesis was detected both in the cytosol and in the granule fraction. We have recently found that activated mouse neutrophils have a potential to produce histamine (20Tanaka S. Deai K. Konomi A. Takahashi K. Yamane H. Sugimoto Y. Ichikawa A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 1472-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Post-translational processing of HDC detected by immunoprecipitation of elicited neutrophils was found to be rapid, and only 53-kDa form was detected by immunoblot analysis. The 53-kDa form was co-localized with matrix metalloproteinase-9, which is a granule enzyme of neutrophils. On the other hand, only 74-kDa form was detected in lipopolysaccharide-activated mouse macrophages and monomeric IgE-activated immature bone marrow-derived cultured mast cells, in both of which a large increase in histamine synthesis is observed (21Hirasawa N. Murakami A. Ohuchi K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 418: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 22Tanaka S. Takasu Y. Mikura S. Satoh N. Ichikawa A. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Other variants with intermediate sizes (58∼64-kDa) have also been reported in the stomach, fetal liver, and testis (18Fleming J.V.

These findings have highlighted the complexity in the regulation of enzyme activity and intracellular localization of HDC through the post-translational processing. The purpose of this study is to identify the processing site and the responsible protease(s) for the post-translational processing of mouse HDC in histamine-forming cells. We also investigated whether enzymatical activation of HDC occurs upon its post-translational processing. We performed a series of experiments to address these problems using the lentiviral expression system with the mouse mastocytoma, P-815, because the 53-kDa form of HDC was initially purified from this cell line, indicative of the expression of the processing enzyme.

All other chemicals were commercial products of reagent grade. Construction of Expression Vectors—Plasmid pBSII/3FLAG-HDC-HA was constructed by inserting the oligonucleotide pairs coding 3× tandem repeats of the FLAG epitope following the initiating methionine (MDYKDHDGDYKDHDIDYKDDDDK) at the 5′ terminus of mouse HDC cDNA and the oligonucleotide pairs coding the HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) at the 3′ terminus of mouse HDC. To prepare the pLenti/3FLAG-HDC-HA, the pBSII/3FLAG-HDC-HA was digested and subcloned into the pLenti empty vector.

A mouse mastocytoma cell line, P-815, was grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (complete RPMI medium) at 37 °C in a fully humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. P-815 cells (2.0 × 105 cells/ml) were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in the complete RPMI medium with or without butyrate and TPEN in the indicated concentrations. Lentiviral Expression—The lentiviral vector, pLenti/3FLAG-HDC-HA, and its mutants were introduced using a ViraPower Lentiviral Expression system according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, 293FT cells were co-transfected with pLenti/3FLAG-HDC-HA and ViraPower Packaging Mix using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent to generate the recombinant lentivirus. The medium was replaced 24 h after the initial transfection, and was collected at Day 3 as the medium containing the recombinant lentivirus. P-815 cells were incubated in the presence of the viral solutions containing 6 μg/ml of polybrene for 24 h at 37 °C. The infected cells were selected by 2.5 μg/ml blasticidin S. Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblot analyses were performed as described previously (24Safina F. Tanaka S. Inagaki M. Tsuboi K. Sugimoto Y. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14211-14215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Antibodies raised against the FLAG epitope, the HA epitope, caspase-9, and actin were used as the primary antibodies, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies raised against mouse IgG, rat IgG, and rabbit IgG were used as the secondary antibodies. The membranes were stained using an ECL kit according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Histidine Decarboxylase Assay—P-815 cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and were lysed in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH pH 7.3 containing 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01 mm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, 2% polyethylene glycol 300, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Triton X-100. The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the resultant supernatant was subjected to the enzyme assay for HDC. The assay was performed in 1 ml of reaction mixture (100 mm potassium phosphate pH 6.8, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01 mm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, and 2% polyethylene glycol 300) in the presence of 0.8 mml-histidine for 4 h at 37°C. The histamine formed was extracted and separated on a cation exchange column, WCX-1 (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), by HPLC and then fluorometrically measured by the o-phthalaldehyde method (25Shore P.A. Burkhalter A. Chon V.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1959; 127: 182-186PubMed Google Scholar). In Vitro Translation and Cleavage Assay—Radiolabeled HDC was prepared by in vitro transcription and translation using [35S]methionine. Plasmid pBSHDC was linearized with SalI, and RNA was transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase as described (17Suzuki S. Tanaka S. Nemoto K. Ichikawa A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In vitro translation was performed using Flexi Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate System. Translation reaction mixture, using 1.0 μg of RNA in 100 μl reaction volume, was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The labeled translation product (7.5 μl) was incubated with 15 μl of recombinant human caspases (15 units), granzyme B (90 units) or the P-815 cell lysate (10 mg protein/ml) in 25 mm HEPES-KOH pH 7.4 containing 100 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% CHAPS for 3 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by addition of SDS-sample buffer. Each sample was boiled for 3 min and was subjected to SDS-PAGE. The radiolabeled HDC protein was detected by autoradiography. Measurement of Caspase Activity—Caspase-3- and caspase-9-like activities were measured using the fluorogenic substrates, Ac-DEVD-AMC and Ac-LEHD-AMC, respectively. P-815 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and were lysed in 50 mm HEPES-KOH pH 7.4 containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations of the supernatants were measured and adjusted at 0.2 mg of protein/ml. The assay was performed in 96-well plate by incubating 20 μg of cell lysate in 200 μl of reaction buffer (100 mm HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, and 5 mm dithiothreitol) in the presence of 50 μm of each fluorogenic substrate. Release of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) was measured after 4 h of incubation at 37 °C by microplate reader (Wallac ARVO sx-1420, PerkinElmer) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 nm and 460 nm, respectively. Flow Cytometry—Apoptotic cell death was evaluated by measuring the translocation of phosphatidylserine in the plasma membrane using the FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson) with a FITC-conjugated annexin and propidium iodide. Apoptotic cell death of P-815 cells were confirmed when the cells were incubated for 12 h in the presence of 1 μm staurosporine. Post-translational Cleavage of HDC in P-815 Cells Treated with Butyrate—We previously purified HDC as a homodimer consisting of a 53-kDa subunit from P-815 cells, which were maintained in peritoneal cavity of the BDF1 mouse (11Ohmori E. Fukui T. Imanishi N. Yatsunami K. Ichikawa A. J. Biochem. 1990; 107: 834-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This cavity incubation was found to induce the expression of HDC in P-815 cells at the transcriptional level (26Ohtsu H. Kuramasu A. Suzuki S. Igarashi K. Ohuchi Y. Sato M. Tanaka S. Nakagawa S. Shirato K. Yamamoto M. Ichikawa A. Watanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28439-28444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Because a prolonged culture of P-815 cells resulted in a decrease in the HDC level, we investigated post-translational processing of HDC expressed using a lentiviral expression in these cells. This approach allowed us to evaluate the processing of only exogenously expressed HDC without the contribution of endogenous HDC and histamine synthesis (HDC activity <0.01 pmol/min/mg protein). Lentivirally transduced epitope-tagged HDC was expressed in P-815 cells as a 74-kDa form, which was detected by both antibodies against the N-terminal (FLAG) and the C-terminal (HA) tags (Fig. 1). Because several effects of butyrate on mast cell function have been found, such as histamine and heparin biosynthesis (27Mori Y. Akedo H. Tanaka K. Tanigaki Y. Okada M. Exp. Cell Res. 1979; 118: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 28Mori Y. Akedo H. Tanigaki Y. Tanaka K.M. Okada M. Nakamura N. Exp. Cell Res. 1980; 127: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 29Jacobsson K. Riesenfeld J. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12154-12159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated the effects of butyrate on the molecular mass of HDC. In addition to the 74-kDa form, three forms with smaller molecular masses were detected in the cells treated with butyrate using the N-terminal anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 1). We could detect no smaller fragments using the C-terminal anti-HA antibody. These results suggest that the post-translational processing of HDC yields 46-, 55-, and 60-kDa forms by accompanying a rapid degradation of the C-terminal fragment. Because a series of C-terminal deletion mutants of HDC, HDC1–476, HDC1–460, HDC1–420, and HDC1–380, exhibited no enzyme activity (data not shown), it seems likely that 46-kDa form of HDC has no enzymatic activity. We, therefore, focused on the generation of two major processed forms, 55- and 60-kDa forms. Because transduced HDC contains the epitope tags of about 2 kDa, the 55- and 60-kDa forms should correspond to 53- and 58-kDa forms of the endogenous HDC. Determination of the Cleavage Site by Alanine-scanning Mutagenesis—We performed a study using a series of alanine-substituted mutants to identify the amino acid residues critical for the cleavage of HDC in P-815 cells (Table 1). Generation of the 60-kDa form of HDC was abolished in two triple alanine mutants, DPF547–549 and DDC550–552, and in a double mutant, DD550–551, whereas not in a triple mutant TMP544–546 (Fig. 2A). Mutations of individual amino acids revealed that an alanine substitution of Pro548 or Asp550 partially suppressed the generation of the 60-kDa form upon treatment with butyrate (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, generation of 55-kDa form was completely abolished by a single mutation at the residue, Asp518 or Pro519 (Fig. 2C). A single alanine mutation at the residue Asp517 was also found to suppress the formation of 55-kDa form. Activation of HDC through the Post-translational Processing—Because butyrate was reported to augment histamine synthesis in P-815 cells, we investigated the relationship between the processing and enzyme activity of HDC. The butyrate-induced increase in histamine synthesis was found to be accompanied by formation of 55- and 60-kDa form of HDC (Fig. 3, A and B). The amount of the 74-kDa form was not changed during the treatment, whereas that of the processed forms was increased. Densitometric measurement exhibited a good correlation between the amount of the processed forms and the enzyme activity. Furthermore, the C-terminal deletion mutants, which correspond to the 55- and 60-kDa form of HDC, exhibited higher specific activity when compared with the 74-kDa form (∼8-fold, Fig. 3, C and D). We then constructed an HDC mutant that is resistant to cleavage in P-815 cells treated with butyrate to investigate the effects of the post-translational processing on the enzyme activity. The mutant form, in which aspartate residues at 518, 550, and 551 are substituted to alanine, was found to be completely resistant to the butyrate-induced cleavage (Fig. 3E). The butyrate treatment increased the enzyme activity in P-815 cells expressing the wild type HDC, but not in the cells expressing this mutant (Fig. 3F). These results indicate that enzymatic activation of HDC upon the butyrate treatment requires the post-translational processing. Activation of endogenous HDC was also measurable upon the butyrate treatment in the parental cells, indicating that the increase in the enzyme activity in the cells expressing the recombinant HDC was partially because of the activation of endogenous HDC. However, its contribution was negligible, because the levels of enzyme activation were very small in the parental cells (0.100 ± 0.0211 pmol/min/mg protein, in the presence of 3 mm butyrate, n = 3). Cleavage of in Vitro Translated HDC by Purified Proteases—Investigation of cleavage sites of HDC by alanine-scanning mutagenesis raised a possibility that HDC is post-translationally cleaved at the aspartic residues. Because caspase family and granzyme B have been found to require an aspartate residue at the cleavage site, we then investigated whether purified caspase or granzyme B has a potential to cleave HDC protein in vitro.A band, of which molecular mass is ∼53-kDa, was detected when the 35S-radiolabeled 74-kDa form of HDC was incubated with caspase-9 (Fig. 4). Thus, a single processed form was generated in vitro, whereas two different processed forms were detected in P-815 cells expressing epitope-tagged HDC upon treatment with butyrate. This discrepancy may be attributed to differences of the substrate/protease ratio between in vitro and in cells. Although purified mouse granzyme B also generated three processed species, no processed forms were found in the 50–60-kDa ranges. We then performed the in vitro cleavage analyses with the alanine-mutated HDC to identify the amino acid residues recognized by purified caspase-9. The processing-resistant mutant, HDCD518/550/551, was partially resistant to cleavage by caspase-9 (Fig. 5A). An additional mutation at the aspartate residue 517 of HDC was found to completely abolish this limited cleavage. Because human caspase-9 is highly homologous to mouse caspase-9 and purified human caspase-9 can compensate for the loss of mouse caspase-9 in the cell extracts of the caspase-9-deficient mice (30Kuida K. Haydar T.F. Kuan C.-Y. Gu Y. Taya C. Karasuyama H. Su M.S. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Cell. 1998; 94: 325-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that mouse caspase-9 can also cleave HDC in a similar fashion. As a negative control, no cleavage was found in the presence of caspase-3 (Fig. 5B).FIGURE 5Effects of alanine substitution on in vitro cleavage of HDC by caspase-9. In vitro cleavage assay was performed as described in the legend to Fig. 4. [35S]methionine labeled wild type HDC protein and its mutants (HDCD518/550/551 and HDCD517/518/550/551) were incubated with the indicated concentrations of human purified caspase-3 (B), or -9 (A).

Ruffin R.E. Murgia C. Li L. Krilis S.A. Zalewski P.D. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 7750-7760Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Because Zn2+ has a potential to inhibit cysteine proteases including caspases, we then investigated the effects of TPEN on activation of the caspase cascade and HDC in P-815 cells. Treatment of the cells with TPEN was found to significantly enhance the specific cleavage and enzymatic activation of HDC induced by butyrate (Fig. 6, A and B). Contribution of endogenous HDC to the total activity was negligible, because only a slight increase in the activity was observed in the parental cells (0.157 ± 0.0195 pmol/min/mg protein, in the presence of 3 mm butyrate and 3 μm TPEN, n = 3). Furthermore, treatment with butyrate in combination with TPEN caused a drastic increase in the enzyme activity"
https://openalex.org/W2015538161,"In skeletal muscle, the myosin molecule contains two sets of noncovalently attached low molecular weight proteins, the regulatory (RLC) and essential (ELC) light chains. To assess the functional and developmental significance of the fast skeletal isoform of the RLC (RLC-f), the murine fast skeletal RLC gene (Mylpf) was disrupted by homologous recombination. Heterozygotes containing an intronic neo cassette (RLC-/+) had approximately one-half of the amount of the RLC-f mRNA compared to wild-type (WT) mice but their muscles were histologically normal in both adults and neonates. In contrast, homozygous mice (RLC-/-) had no RLC-f mRNA or protein and completely lacked both fast and slow skeletal muscle. This was likely due to interference with mRNA processing in the presence of the neo cassette. These RLC-f null mice died immediately after birth, presumably due to respiratory failure since their diaphragms lacked skeletal muscle. The body weight of newborn RLC-f null mice was decreased 30% compared to heterozygous or WT newborn mice. The lack of skeletal muscle formation in the null mice did not affect the development of other organs including the heart. In addition, we found that WT mice did not express the ventricular/slow skeletal RLC isoform (RLC-v/s) until after birth, while it was expressed normally in the embryonic heart. The lack of skeletal muscle formation observed in RLC-f null mice indicates the total dependence of skeletal muscle development on the presence of RLC-f during embryogenesis. This observation, along with the normal function of the RLC-v/s in the heart, implicates a coupled, diverse pathway for RLC-v/s and RLC-f during embryogenesis, where RLC-v/s is responsible for heart development and RLC-f is necessary for skeletal muscle formation. In conclusion, in this study we demonstrate that the Mylpf gene is critically important for fast and slow skeletal muscle development."
https://openalex.org/W1994079140,"The role of the axonal membrane compartment in synaptic integration is usually neglected. We show here that in interneurons of the cerebellar molecular layer, where dendrites are so short that the somatodendritic domain can be considered isopotential, the axonal membrane contributes a significant part of the cell input capacitance. We examine the impact of axonal membrane on synaptic integration by cutting the axon with two-photon illumination. We find that the axonal compartment acts as a sink for signals generated at fast conductance synapses, thus increasing the initial decay rate of corresponding synaptic potentials over the value predicted from the resistance-capacitance (RC) product of the cell membrane; signals generated at slower synapses are much less affected. This mechanism sharpens the spike firing precision of fast glutamatergic inputs without resorting to multisynaptic pathways.

This mechanism sharpens the spike firing precision of fast glutamatergic inputs without resorting to multisynaptic pathways. “Synaptic integration” is the process by which the synaptic information coming from individual synaptic sites is combined with the membrane properties of the postsynaptic neuron to determine the firing pattern of this neuron. Current understanding of synaptic integration in the mammalian CNS is rooted in the work by Eccles and collaborators (Coombs et al., 1957Coombs J.S. Curtis D.R. Eccles J.C. The interpretation of spike potentials of motoneurones.J. Physiol. 1957; 139: 198-231PubMed Google Scholar), who established a clear distinction between the role of the somatodendritic compartment (collecting synaptic information) and that of the axon (generating and transmitting the action potential). Recently, analysis of local dendritic recordings has enriched this picture by showing that in certain neurons, dendrites possess voltage-dependent channels and are able to generate and conduct action potentials (Johnston et al., 1996Johnston D.

In addition, the presence of specific voltage-dependent conductances in dendrites alters the shape of local synaptic potentials and may increase the size of somatic synaptic potentials (Johnston et al., 1996Johnston D. Magee J.C. Colbert C.M. Cristie B.R. Active properties of neuronal dendrites.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 165-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, Johnston et al., 2000Johnston D.

Neurobiol. 2005; 64: 75-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). A number of recent results indicate that the passive electrical coupling between the soma and the axon is much more extensive than previously assumed. Somatic hyperpolarization has been shown to influence the inactivation state of axonal K+ channels and thus modify action potential propagation in hippocampal pyramidal cells (Debanne et al., 1997Debanne D. Guérineau N.C. Gähwiler B.H. Thompson S.M. Action-potential propagation gated by an axonal I(A)-like K+ conductance in hippocampus.Nature. 1997; 389: 286-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In retinal bipolar cells, somatic depolarizing voltage steps elicit graded activation of Ca2+ channels located in presynaptic terminals (Protti and Llano, 1998Protti D. Llano I. Calcium currents and calcium signaling in rod bipolar cells of rat retinal slices.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3715-3724PubMed Google Scholar). Subthreshold changes in somatic potentials have been shown to modify neurotransmitter release in cerebellar interneurons (Glitsch and Marty, 1999Glitsch M. Marty A. Presynaptic effects of NMDA in cerebellar Purkinje cells and interneurons.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 511-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), hippocampal granule cells (Alle and Geiger, 2006Alle H. Geiger J.R.P. Combined analog and action potential coding in hippocampal mossy fibers.Science. 2006; 311: 1290-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), and cortical pyramidal cells (Shu et al., 2006Shu Y. Hasenstaub A. Duque A. Yu Y. McCormick D.A. Modulation of intracortical synaptic potentials by presynaptic somatic membrane potential.Nature. 2006; 441: 761-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Finally, several studies (e.g. in hippocampal pyramidal cells [Colbert and Johnston, 1996Colbert C.M. Johnston D. Axonal action-potential initiation and Na+ channel densities in the soma and axon initial segment of subicular pyramidal neurons.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6676-6686PubMed Google Scholar] and in cerebellar Purkinje cells [Clark et al., 2005Clark B.A. Monsivais P. Branco T. London M. Häusser M. The site of action potential initiation in cerebellar Purkinje neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 137-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar]) indicate that the action potential initiation site is not at the axon initial segment, but at some distance away from the soma, at the first node of Ranvier. This implies that subthreshold somatic depolarization influences the axonal membrane over a distance of 50 μm or more. If one accepts the existence of a significant coupling between somatodendritic and axonal compartments in the subthreshold voltage range, it follows that synaptic currents load a substantial part of axonal membrane, and conversely, that loading the axonal capacitance may alter the shape of synaptic potentials. However, to our knowledge, such participation of the axon in synaptic integration has not been considered so far. This is likely due to the fact that the concepts of synaptic integration have been established in large neurons, such as spinal cord motoneurons. In such cells (as documented in CA3 pyramidal cells; see Major et al., 1994Major G. Larkmann A.U. Jonas P. Sakmann B. Jack J.J.B. Detailed passive cable models of whole-cell recorded CA3 pyramidal neurons in rat hippocampal slices.J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4613-4638PubMed Google Scholar), the influence of the somatodendritic compartment on passive cell properties overshadows that of the axon. However, a different situation might prevail for the smaller neurons that abound in the mammalian CNS. In the present study, we use a combination of cellular laser dissection and whole-cell recording, as well as modeling, to show that in small neurons, the coupling between somatodendritic and axonal compartments plays a predominant role in the temporal integration of synaptic signals. We examined cerebellar stellate and basket cells, two closely related cell types (Sultan and Bower, 1998Sultan F. Bower J.M. Quantitative Golgi study of the rat cerebellar molecular layer interneurons using principal component analysis.J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 393: 353-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) that collectively constitute molecular layer interneurons (MLIs). MLIs have short and thick dendrites: typical values for dendrite length and width in juvenile rats (PN 10–14, as used in the present study) are 20–50 μm and 1–2 μm, respectively (Llano et al., 1997Llano I. Tan Y.P. Caputo C. Spatial heterogeneity of intracellular Ca2+ signals in axons of basket cells from rat cerebellar slices.J. Physiol. 1997; 502: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, Pouzat and Hestrin, 1997Pouzat C. Hestrin S. Developmental regulation of basket/stellate cell -> Purkinje cell synapses in the cerebellum.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9104-9112PubMed Google Scholar). Model calculations performed on these neurons (Pouzat and Marty, 1999Pouzat C. Marty A. Somatic recording of GABAergic autoreceptor current in cerebellar stellate and basket cells.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1675-1690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as experimental results (Auger et al., 1998Auger C. Kondo S. Marty A. Multivesicular release at single functional synaptic sites in cerebellar stellate and basket cells.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4532-4547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggest that their dendrites are electrically compact, such that dendritic voltage gradients do not distort synaptic currents significantly. Nevertheless, we found that the passive properties of MLIs deviate strongly from the predictions of a one-compartment model. Under voltage clamp, capacitive currents displayed two distinct exponential components (Figure 1A): a fast component with a time constant of 0.24 ± 0.04 ms and an associated capacitance, Cf, of 6.3 ± 0.6 pF; and a slow component with a time constant of 2.54 ± 0.27 ms and an associated capacitance, Cs, of 10.5 ± 0.9 pF (n = 14; Figures 1B and 1C). While Cf most probably corresponds to the somatodendritic compartment, acting as one unit, the nature of Cs is intriguing. Since MLIs are linked through gap junctions in adult guinea pigs (Mann-Metzer and Yarom, 1999Mann-Metzer P. Yarom Y. Electrotonic coupling interacts with intrinsic properties to generate synchronized activity in cerebellar networks of inhibitory interneurons.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3298-3306PubMed Google Scholar), electrical coupling between MLIs could be responsible for Cs. However, the prevalence of such coupling is low in juvenile rats (Pouzat and Marty, 1999Pouzat C. Marty A. Somatic recording of GABAergic autoreceptor current in cerebellar stellate and basket cells.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1675-1690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which were used in the present work. Furthermore, we tested the gap junction hypothesis by comparing capacitive currents before and after application of the decoupling agent carbenoxonole (100 μM). There was no significant difference between the control and carbenoxonole groups (thus the mean Cs reduction in carbenoxolone was 0.80 ± 0.94 pF, n = 6; p = 0.5; results not shown), suggesting that gap junctions do not play a major role in generating Cs. MLI axons extend over much longer distances than dendrites. We therefore asked whether Cs could have arisen from the axonal membrane. Axons from the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans have been successfully cut by two-photon illumination (Yanik et al., 2004Yanik M.F. Cinar H. Cinar H.N. Chisholm A.D. Jin Y. Ben-Yakar A. Neurosurgery: functional regeneration after laser axotomy.Nature. 2004; 432: 822Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), and axotomized axons were able to regrow. Having filled an interneuron with the Ca-sensitive dye Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1 (OG1), we located the axon using two-photon illumination and recorded its response to somatically applied depolarizations (Llano et al., 1997Llano I. Tan Y.P. Caputo C. Spatial heterogeneity of intracellular Ca2+ signals in axons of basket cells from rat cerebellar slices.J. Physiol. 1997; 502: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, Tan and Llano, 1999Tan Y.P. Llano I. Modulation of K+ channels of action potential-evoked intracellular Ca2+ concentrations rises in rat cerebellar basket cell axons.J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We selected a region of the main axon that was straight and free of collateral branches, and we submitted it to repetitive line scans in the direction orthogonal to the axonal axis using high-power biphotonic illumination while maintaining the soma under voltage clamp. This resulted in axon severing at the point of illumination (Figure 1D). The gap in the cut region was less than 1 μm in width initially (Figure 1D2), and became broader on a time course of minutes (Figure 1D3). Successful cutting was accompanied by local Ca elevation, which however subsided within <1 min on the somatic side of the cut. The distal part of the axon underwent progressive degeneration, as revealed by beading, segregation of axon segments, and persistent elevation of fluorescence levels (Figure 1D3). By contrast, there was no sign of degradation at any time after cutting (within the ∼1 hr duration of the experiment) in the somatodendritic domain or in the part of the axon that remained attached to the soma (Figure 1E). Axon disruption was reflected by a sudden increase in the cell conductance (by 6.0 ± 2.1 nS, n = 6), from 0.63 ± 0.13 nS at rest. The conductance gradually recovered, with a typical recovery time of 10–20 min (example in Figure 1F). Upon cutting, Cf was not altered (mean ratio after cutting over control, 1.03 ± 0.09, n = 14), but Cs was reduced from 10.5 ± 0.9 to 2.6 ± 0.9 pF (24% ± 7% of its initial value), a highly significant change (p < 0.001, n = 14; Figures 1G and 1H). This change was immediately apparent after the cut and remained stable thereafter. These results show that the axon membrane provides the major part of the slow capacitive component. The residual Cs observed after cutting likely reflects the axon length (averaging 38 μm, n = 8) remaining between the cutting site and the soma (Figure 1E). To estimate the possible impact of the axonal membrane on synaptic integration, we examined the responses of MLIs to short current injections under current clamp. In control conditions, the membrane voltage decay could be closely approximated by a double exponential function (Figure 2A). The time constants and the relative amplitudes of the fast and slow components did not depend on the current amplitude, suggesting that they were determined by passive membrane properties (Figure 2A). The decay kinetics became slower as the duration of the pulse was increased (Figure 2B). This effect could largely be ascribed to a decrease of the relative amplitude of the fast component as a function of pulse duration, while both time constants were weakly dependent on this duration (Figure 2C). Given the simple geometry of MLIs (Figure 2D), we modeled current-clamp results based on an assembly of an isopotential somatodendritic compartment and a finite length cable (Rall, 1969Rall W. Time constants and electrotonic length of membrane cylinders and neurons.Biophys. J. 1969; 9: 1483-1508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, Jackson, 1992Jackson M.B. Cable analysis with the whole-cell patch clamp. Theory and experiment.Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 756-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The model predicts current-step-induced voltage relaxations that are an infinite sum of exponentials, with decreasing time constants (Equation 1 of the Modeling section in the Experimental Procedures). In practice, however, only the first few terms of the series make a significant contribution, and the model relaxations (Figure 2B, dashed line), like the corresponding experimental results, were fitted using a biexponential function. Model parameters include the mean cell input resistance (R), the ratio of the axonal access conductance over that of the somatodendritic compartment (ρ), the cable physical length (l), the cable length constant (λ), and the dimensionless cable length L = l/λ. Since the mean cell input resistance (R = 1.70 GΩ) and axon length (l = 300 μm) are known, the model contains only two free parameters, L and ρ. A good fit was obtained with L = 0.55, ρ = 1.5 (Figure 2C). λ can be calculated from these results as 545 μm, close to previous estimates of axon length constants in the pituitary gland (Jackson, 1993Jackson M.B. Passive current flow and morphology in the terminal arborizations of the posterior pituitary.J. Neurophysiol. 1993; 69: 692-702PubMed Google Scholar), as well as in hippocampal or cortical principal neurons (Alle and Geiger, 2006Alle H. Geiger J.R.P. Combined analog and action potential coding in hippocampal mossy fibers.Science. 2006; 311: 1290-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, Shu et al., 2006Shu Y. Hasenstaub A. Duque A. Yu Y. McCormick D.A. Modulation of intracortical synaptic potentials by presynaptic somatic membrane potential.Nature. 2006; 441: 761-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The fact that the model could account for voltage relaxation results for short current pulses is encouraging since the data include three independent parameters (the slow and fast time constants, τv,s and τv,f, and the percentage amplitude of fast relaxation, %F), whereas the model has only two (L and ρ). Furthermore, the model correctly predicted the dependence of %F on pulse duration, but it displayed less dependence of τv,s and τv,f on pulse duration than experimental data (Figures 2B and 2C). The model was chosen to approximate best short pulse duration data, with respective experimental and model values for 2 ms long current pulses: τv,s = 32.2 ± 5.2 ms (experimental) versus 31.7 ms (model); τv,f = 1.9 ± 0.3 ms versus 1.7 ms; %F = 37.9 ± 6.4 versus 39.0. The model assumes, for reasons that will be discussed later, that the somatodendritic and axonal compartments have the same membrane resistivity, and hence the same membrane time constant τm. Since it predicts that τm = τv,s, based on the present results we set τm = 32 ms. The same model predicts an infinite series of exponentials for the decay of the capacitive current (Equation 2 of the Modeling section in the Experimental Procedures). Like above, the first terms predominate, and the relaxation can well be described with a sum of two exponentials (Figure 2E). This gave τs = 3.08 ms (in reasonable agreement with the experimental value of 2.54 ms) and τf = 0.20 ms (also close to the experimental value of 0.24 ms; the latter match is, however, partially fortuitous since the fast component of the experimental curve contained contributions from both the axonal and the somatodendritic membrane; see the Modeling section in the Experimental Procedures). These results show that the biphasic decays of the capacitive current in voltage clamp, and those of the current-driven depolarization in current clamp, can be explained by a simple passive membrane model consisting of one compartment plus a finite length cable. The decay time course of current-driven depolarizations turned from biexponential before axon cutting (11/11 cells) to monoexponential after axon cutting (10/11 cells; Figure 3A). In 8/11 cells, the initial rate of decay (measured as explained in the Experimental Procedures) was reduced after axon cutting (Figure 3A), suggesting that the presence of the axon accelerates the initial phase of membrane repolarization. This result was all the more remarkable since the input resistance (see below) and the input capacitance of the cell (Figure 1) were usually reduced after cutting. Both factors, by themselves, would tend to accelerate the decay of the cut cell compared with that of the control. When normalizing the results with respect to the RC product, a marked reduction of the initial decay rate was found in all experiments (Figure 3B). During axotomy experiments, we were unable to find any axon in five cells that had presumably each lost an axon during the preparation of the slice. We used these “axonless” cells to test whether a side effect of our cutting procedure could be responsible for the kinetic change illustrated in Figure 3A. Axonless cells had a mean input resistance of 3.9 ± 2.2 GΩ, compared with 1.70 ± 0.29 GΩ and 0.75 ± 0.21 GΩ before and after cutting, respectively, in axotomy experiments (n = 14). They displayed monoexponential capacitive currents (Figure 3C1) and monoexponential voltage decays (Figure 3C2) in response to current injection. The time constant of voltage decay of axonless cells (τ = 23.6 ± 4.3 ms; n = 5) was slightly smaller than τm (32 ms), but it was slower than the time constant of axotomized cells (τ = 6.0 ± 0.9 ms; n = 10), in accordance with the higher input resistance of axonless cells compared with axotomized cells. The difference disappeared after dividing by the RC product, showing that cells without axons obeyed the predictions of a simple RC compartment independently of the method used to sever the axon (Figure 3B). Taken together, the results strongly suggest that the axon is responsible for accelerating the first part of the voltage decay after current injection. Having established the effects of the axon membrane on passive membrane properties, we next examined the consequences of these effects for synaptic integration. It was reported that MLIs retain a rather high intracellular Cl− concentration late in life, so that GABAergic postsynaptic currents (GPSCs) are inward below −60 mV, and GABAergic postsynaptic potentials (GPSPs) are often depolarizing and excitatory (Chavas and Marty, 2003Chavas J. Marty A. Coexistence of excitatory and inhibitory GABA synapses in the cerebellar interneuron network.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2019-2031PubMed Google Scholar). [Note however that whereas Chavas and Marty, 2003Chavas J. Marty A. Coexistence of excitatory and inhibitory GABA synapses in the cerebellar interneuron network.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2019-2031PubMed Google Scholar report a Cl− reversal potential of −58 mV, Carter and Regehr, 2002Carter A.G. Regehr W.G. Quantal events shape cerebellar interneuron firing.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 12: 1309-1318Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar report a value of −82 mV; the reason for the discrepancy remains unclear.] Kinetics of spontaneous synaptic currents was determined at 34°C–37°C under physiological ionic conditions (15 mM intracellular Cl−; see Chavas and Marty, 2003Chavas J. Marty A. Coexistence of excitatory and inhibitory GABA synapses in the cerebellar interneuron network.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2019-2031PubMed Google Scholar). We found that excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were entirely due to the activation of AMPA-selective glutamate receptors, confirming earlier studies showing that single EPSCs of MLIs lack any NMDA-sensitive component (Glitsch and Marty, 1999Glitsch M. Marty A. Presynaptic effects of NMDA in cerebellar Purkinje cells and interneurons.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 511-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Clark and Cull-Candy, 2002Clark B.A. Cull-Candy S.G. Activity-dependent recruitment of extrasynaptic NMDA receptor activation at an AMPA receptor-only synapse.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4428-4436PubMed Google Scholar). Also in conformity with previous work (Llano and Gerschenfeld, 1993Llano I. Gerschenfeld H.M. Inhibitory synaptic currents in stellate cells of rat cerebellar slices.J. Physiol. 1993; 468: 177-200PubMed Google Scholar, Carter and Regehr, 2002Carter A.G. Regehr W.G. Quantal events shape cerebellar interneuron firing.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 12: 1309-1318Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar), we found that EPSCs were much faster than GPSCs. At a holding potential of −70 mV, both types of currents were inward, with mean amplitudes of 106 ± 30 pA (n = 4) for EPSCs and 57 ± 11 pA (n = 4) for GPSCs. Distributions of weighted decay time constants were centered around 0.65 ms for EPSCs and 6.6 ms for GPSCs; the distributions did not overlap (Figure 4A). In current clamp, the holding current was adjusted to maintain the mean membrane potential near −70 mV, just below the firing range of MLIs (Chavas and Marty, 2003Chavas J. Marty A. Coexistence of excitatory and inhibitory GABA synapses in the cerebellar interneuron network.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2019-2031PubMed Google Scholar). In these conditions, the largest excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs)/GPSPs occasionally triggered action potentials (as previously reported: Carter and Regehr, 2002Carter A.G. Regehr W.G. Quantal events shape cerebellar interneuron firing.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 12: 1309-1318Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar, Chavas and Marty, 2003Chavas J. Marty A. Coexistence of excitatory and inhibitory GABA synapses in the cerebellar interneuron network.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2019-2031PubMed Google Scholar), while most postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) were subthreshold. EPSPs and GPSPs (mean amplitudes across cells: 6.41 ± 0.45 mV, n = 13, and 6.68 ± 1.48 mV, n = 6, respectively) had strikingly different time courses (Figure 4B). EPSPs had a short rise time (≤2 ms) and a biexponential decay (fast time constant: 4.0 ± 1.0 ms; slow time constant: 38.2 ± 8.4 ms; percentage of fast component: 30% ± 4%; n = 12; Figure 4B). GPSPs had much longer rise times (up to 20 ms), a rounded maximum, and a slow, monophasic decay (Figure 4B), with a time constant of 42.1 ± 9.6 ms, which is not statistically different from that of the slow component of EPSPs. Because PSPs were recorded near the firing range of the cells, we examined whether their decay kinetics could be affected by voltage in two ways. First, if the cell was hyperpolarized down to −80 mV, the biphasic versus monophasic character of EPSPs versus GPSPs was maintained, and none of the kinetic parameters of EPSPs and GPSPs (EPSPs: slow and fast time constant of decay, and proportion of the fast component; GPSPs: half decay time) displayed any significant change (n = 4 for each set of measurements). [However, in agreement with recent results indicating that the MLI input conductance gradually increases with hyperpolarization between −70 and −100 mV (Mejia-Gervacio and Marty, 2006Mejia-Gervacio S. Marty A. Control of interneuron firing pattern by axonal autoreceptors in the juvenile rat cerebellum.J. Physiol. 2006; 571: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we found that hyperpolarizing beyond −80 mV did accelerate GPSPs and EPSPs (results not shown).] Second, to test whether PSP kinetics was related to PSP amplitudes, we separated EPSPs or GPSPs in individual experiments into two groups according to their maximum amplitudes (excluding the few events that triggered spikes). After appropriate scaling, the kinetics of decay for each size class was superimposable (n = 3 for each type of analysis; examples in Figure 4C). Thus, in general, voltage-dependent conductances did not affect the PSP decay kinetics significantly. We conclude that EPSPs and GPSPs have strikingly different decay kinetics, and that the difference is due to a combination of the kinetics of the underlying synaptic currents with the passive properties of the neurons. We next tested the effects of axotomy on the decay kinetics of EPSPs. In 11/13 cells, this decay changed from biexponential before cutting to monoexponential after cutting (example in Figure 5A; in the other two cases, the decay retained a monoexponential or biexponential shape through cutting). Likewise, axonless cells displayed monoexponential EPSP decays with long time constants (mean value of 27.6 ± 5.0 ms, n = 5; versus 6.5 ± 0.9 ms, n = 10 in freshly axotomized cells; Figure 5B). These numbers are not significantly different from the mean time constants for voltage decay following depolarizing current steps (23.6 ± 4.3 ms and 6.0 ± 0.9 ms, respectively; see above). The difference in EPSP decay rates for axotomized cells versus axonless cells (with a ratio of 4.2) is in line with the difference in input resistances for these data sets (with a ratio of 7.2), and thus reflects the fact that membrane healing is not perfect in axon cutting experiments. After RC normalization, a clear decrease was apparent when comparing the initial EPSP decay rates before and after cutting (with a mean ratio of 3.78 ± 0.58, n = 10; p < 0.001; Figure 5C). In both axotomized and axonless cells, normalized initial EPSP decay rates were close to, or smaller than, the inverse of the RC product, whereas in normal cells, the rates were higher than 1/RC (average ratio, 2.92 ± 0.52; Figure 5C). These results all support the view that the presence of the axon accelerates the initial decay rate of EPSPs. To test the impact of the axonal membrane on PSP kinetics, we predicted the shape of EPSPs and GPSPs by calculating the convolution product of the average EPSC and GPSC waveforms, as determined under voltage clamp (yellow curves in Figures 6A and 6B), with the response to an instantaneous current step (blue curves), as derived from the passive membrane model of Figure 2. The results (red curves in Figures 6A and 6B) are very close to the experimental results (black curves). This suggests that the axon membrane is responsible for the marked difference in decay kinetics between EPSPs and depolarizing GPSPs. As expected, applying the same procedure to a one-compartment model resulted in a markedly slower EPSP decay and in smaller differences between simulated EPSP and GPSP decay kinetics (Figures 6C and 6D). PSP kinetics has been repeatedly identified as a key factor influencing the time window for PSP summation (Geiger et al., 1997Geiger J.R.P. Lübke J. Roth A. Frotscher M. Jonas P. Submillisecond AMPA receptor-mediated signaling at a principal neuron-interneuron synapse.Neuron. 1997; 18: 1009-1023Abst"

These interactions represent a novel link between the V1 and V0 domains in man, which is known to be required for H+-ATPase assembly and regulation. The vacuolar-type H+-ATPases are ubiquitous in nature and play an essential part in regulating proton flux at a number of sites, both intra- and extracellular. For example, intracellular acidification of various organelles, such as endosomes and lysosomes, is a prerequisite for their normal function. Although they are evolutionarily and structurally related to the mitochondrial F-ATPases that synthesize ATP, the H+-ATPases found in mammalian systems have lost the capacity to synthesize ATP and instead function solely as rotary motors, using ATP hydrolysis to move protons across membranes (1Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). The general structure of H+-ATPases has been largely modeled from yeast. It is similar across the wide variety of tissues and cell types in which they are found, but there are subtle differences between individual cell types. Each proton pump consists of at least 13 subunits organized into two distinct domains. In the current structural model of the H+-ATPase, the peripheral V1 (hydrolytic) domain contains 3A, 3B, one each of C, D, E, F, and H, and two G subunits. This is loosely linked to the membrane-anchored V0 domain by two stalks; the central stalk consists of the D and F subunits, and the peripheral stalk contains the C, E, G, and H subunits together with the N terminus of the a subunit (1Nishi T.

In higher organisms, it is generally accepted that ubiquitously expressed H+-ATPases found at the membrane of intracellular organelles comprise the A, B2, C1, D1, E1, F, G1, H, a1, c, c″, d1, and e1 forms. These are all encoded by separate genes, and for those designated with a numerical suffix, there are separately encoded homologues that vary in their expression pattern depending on the site and/or tissue in question. Some specialized cell types have a specific requirement for acid flux across the membrane, because acidification or alkalinization of the extracellular milieu is required for their specialized functions. In H+-ATPases found at the plasma membrane of these specialized cell types, some ubiquitously expressed subunits are replaced by tissue-specific forms. Notable examples of this include α-intercalated cells of the distal nephron in the kidney, osteoclasts in bone, the acrosome organelle in sperm, and other specialized epithelia in lung, inner ear, testis, and eye. Dysfunction of any one of the particular proton pumps found at these sites might be expected to cause human disease, which indeed has been demonstrated. There are no known examples of disease-associated mutations in the ubiquitously expressed subunits, suggesting incompatibility with life. We and others have previously identified several human subunit homologues that are highly expressed in the kidney and which thereby contribute to normal urine acidification (7Nelson R.D. Guo X.L.

Preliminary expression studies of the other three subunits showed that, in the major organs in man, G3 subunit mRNA is only found in kidney, d2 is found in kidney, lung, and in osteoclasts in bone, whereas C2 is present in kidney and placenta (9Smith A.N.

Here we have described further characterization of the human G3 subunit, which we have demonstrated is also expressed in the inner ear and which interacts within the pump complex with the a1 and a4 subunits. We have also shown that the ubiquitously expressed G1 subunit is able to interact with a1 and a4. Human Tissues—With ethical approval from Addenbrooke’s Hospital Local Research Ethics Committee, samples of normal human renal tissue were obtained from nephrectomy specimens removed for renal tumors. Testis and epididymis were similarly recovered from the discarded normal portions of resection specimens. Inner ear epithelia were obtained during routine surgical operations where the integrity of the cochlea was not required. Tissues were stored at -80 °C until required. Protein Extraction—Membrane and cytosolic protein fractions were prepared as described previously from human, mouse, and rat kidney and also mouse brain and were stored at -80 °C until use (15Smith A.N.

Generation and Characterization of Anti-G3 Polyclonal Antiserum—A polyclonal antibody was raised against two peptides present in G3, IDQYRMQRDKEFRLKQ (peptide 1, amino acids 44–59), and LGKIQELNGHYNKYMES (peptide 2, amino acids 77–93). The peptides were linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used to immunize a single sheep. The resulting serum was affinity-purified against the immunizing peptides, using a SulfoLink® column (Pierce) according to standard methods. The specificity of both unpurified and affinity-purified antisera were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using standard methods. 40 μg of each protein lysate were loaded on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and Western blot was carried out following standard protocols. Membranes were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 2The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; RT, reverse transcription; SSC, saline-sodium citrate. containing 5% nonfat milk and 0.05% Tween 20 and probed with a 1:200 dilution of affinity-purified anti-G3 antibody followed by a 1:5000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-sheep antibody (Abcam) before incubation with ECL-Plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and visualization. Phage Display Library Screening—The Ph.D.™-7 phage display peptide library (New England Biolabs) was screened using G3 peptide 1 according to the supplied protocol. Following three rounds of panning, clones containing consensus peptide sequences were amplified and tested for interaction with peptide 1 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cloning of G3 into the minipRSETA-mac Bacterial Expression Vector—Full-length human G3 was PCR-amplified from kidney cDNA using primers 5′-AACTGCAGCATGACAAGCCAGTCTCAGGGGATC-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTGTTGAAAACTGTGATGTACATTTAGTTG-3′ to incorporate a 5′ PstI site and 3′ HindIII site, respectively. Full-length human G1 was PCR-amplified from kidney cDNA using primers 5′-CGGGGTACCATATGGCTAGTCAGTCT-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTCTATCCATTTATGCGGTAG-3′, which incorporate a 5′ KpnI site and 3′ HindIII site, respectively. These sites were used to clone gel-purified PCR products into a modified pRSETA-mac vector (gift from Dr. Jane Clark, University of Cambridge). The plasmids were transformed into BL21 electrocompetent Escherichia coli, and clones containing the fusion constructs were identified using colony PCR and restriction enzyme digestion; the correct sequence of the inserts was verified using ABI Prism® BigDye™ Terminator cycle sequencing (Applied Biosciences). Expression, Purification, and Refolding of Full-length G3-RGS(His)6 and G1-RGS(His)6—Following optimization of the expression conditions, 50 ml of LB broth (containing ampicillin at a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml) were inoculated with bacterial cells containing either the RGS(His)6-G3 or RGS(His)6-G1 fusion construct. After initial incubation at 37 °C overnight, this culture was diluted 1:50 in a total volume of 2 liters and incubated at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.5–0.8. Expression of G3 or G1 was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.2 mm, and the cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Bacterial cells were pelleted by centrifugation; the pellets were then lysed in B-per bacterial protein extraction reagent (Pierce) with one complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science) and benzonase nuclease (Novagen) (25 units/ml) for 1 h at room temperature with rotary shaking. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation, and the expressed epitope-tagged G protein was purified under denaturing conditions. To achieve this, RGS(His)6-G1 and RGS(His)6-G3 cell debris was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with PBS containing 8 m urea, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole. Following centrifugation at 35,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant containing the denatured insoluble proteins was removed and incubated with equilibrated nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) beads (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4 °C. Unbound protein was washed away with 200 ml of PBS containing 8 m urea, 300 mm NaCl, and 30 mm imidazole. Immobilized, purified, epitope-tagged G protein was then refolded on the beads by repeatedly washing with 200 ml of PBS containing 300 mm NaCl, 30 mm imidazole, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and decreasing concentrations of urea (8, 6, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, and 0.25 m). Following a final 200-ml wash in PBS with 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, purified G protein was eluted off the beads in PBS containing 500 mm imidazole and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Protein was then dialyzed against PBS containing 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and purity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Soluble G protein was then rebound to Ni-NTA beads to carry out pulldowns. Pulldown of a4 from Human Kidney Using Immobilized G3 and G1—Human kidney membrane protein preparation containing 500 μg of total protein was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in solubilization buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5% n-nonyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, and a protease inhibitor mixture tablet. Following centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, the supernatant containing the solubilized membrane proteins was removed and precleared by incubating with equilibrated Ni-NTA beads for 5 h at 4°C. The precleared lysate was incubated with either equilibrated Ni-NTA-agarose or G1/G3-Ni-NTA overnight at 4 °C. Unbound proteins were washed away with buffer (pH 8) containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole. The Ni-NTA and G1/G3-Ni-NTA-agarose were each removed into 100 ml of Laemmli buffer and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. Boiled samples were centrifuged at 200 × g for 2 min, and the supernatant was removed for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Samples were loaded on 7.5 or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and Western blot was carried out following standard protocols. Membranes were blocked in PBS containing 5% nonfat milk (w/v), 0.05% Tween 20, and probed with either rabbit antiserum against a4 (1:1000) (8Smith A.N. Skaug J. Choate K.A. Nayir A. Bakkaloglu A.

Appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were then used at a dilution of 1:15,000 (Dako) before incubation with ECL-plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and visualization. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from discrete structures within the inner ear and male genital tract using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 2 μg of kidney RNA or the whole aliquot of inner ear RNA was treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase I (Promega) and then reverse-transcribed using Super RT (HT Biotechnology Ltd.) and oligo(dT)18 (New England BioLabs) as the primer according to the manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA was amplified using primers G3F2 (5′-ATGCAGAGAGATAAAGAGTTTCGAC-3′) and G3Ex3R (5′-CAGTGCCGATGTATGAGTTATGTC-3′). These primers lie in exon 2 and the 3′UTR of ATP6V1G3, respectively, and the expected product is 360 bp in size. To confirm successful reverse transcription, a 540-bp fragment of β-actin was amplified in parallel using primers 5′-GTGGGCCGCCCTAGGCAC-3′ and 5′-CTCTTTGATGTCACGCACGATTTC-3′. In each experiment, sterile water was used as a template to provide a negative control. Reverse transcription reactions performed in the absence of enzyme provided a negative control sample for each tissue (data not shown). PCR products were visualized under UV light following electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide at a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. Nephron Segment RT-PCR—To define the cell populations that contain G3, PCR was performed on cDNA isolated from discrete structures within the mouse nephron (gift from Dr. Carsten Wagner, University of Zurich, Switzerland) using primers MmG3F1 (5′-AAGGACAAGCTAGATGAGGCAAAG-3′) and MmG3R1 (5′-TCATACTAAACGCCATCCAGGAG-3′). PCR products were visualized as above. In Situ Hybridization and Immunofluorescence—Oligonucleotide probes corresponding to nucleotides 561–620 on the sense strand and nucleotides 620–561 on the antisense strand of human ATP6V1G3 (GenBank™ accession number NM_133262) were synthesized with a 5′ digoxigenin label (MWG Biotech). Probes were resuspended in RNase-free water, and dot blots were performed to ascertain the appropriate dilution factors. Frozen kidney was cut into 5-μm sections and immersed into PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min. Following two 5-min washes in PBS, the sections were incubated with PBS containing proteinase K (5 μg/ml) for 5 min and then with PBS containing glycine (2 mg/ml) for 5 min. Following 5 min of incubation in 2× saline-sodium citrate (SSC) buffer, sections underwent prehybridization at 37 °C for 1 h in hybridization buffer (1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2× SSC, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% dextran sulfate, 1× Denhardt’s solution, and 50% formamide). Probes were then diluted in this buffer and hybridized to the sections overnight at 37 °C. The sections were washed in the following order: 5 min in 2× SSC at 37 °C; 3 × 5 min in 0.2× SSC, 60% formamide at 37 °C; 2× 5 min in 2× SSC at room temperature; and then 5 min in in situ buffer 1 (0.1 m Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100) at room temperature. Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked using in situ buffer 1 containing 1% bovine serum albumin, and then anti-digoxigenin-AP antibody (Roche Applied Science) was added to the section (diluted 1:200 in in situ buffer 1 containing 1% bovine serum albumin) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Following two 5-min washes in in situ buffer 1 and one 5-min wash in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 0.1 m NaCl, and 50 mm MgCl2, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium liquid substrate system (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the section and incubated in the dark at room temperature to allow the color to develop. The reaction was stopped by immersion in water before counterstaining for the principal cell marker aquaporin 2 was performed. Sections were washed in PBS for 5 min, and then nonspecific antibody binding was blocked using PBS containing 10% fetal calf serum for 45 min at room temperature. Anti-aquaporin-2 antibody (Chemicon) diluted 1:100 in PBS containing 10% fetal calf serum was added to the section and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 1 h. The sections were washed 3 × 5 min in PBS, and then donkey anti-rabbit-Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen) (diluted 1:200 in PBS containing 10% fetal calf serum) was added and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 1 h. Slides were washed three times for 5 min each in PBS, and then nuclear counterstain TO-PRO-3 iodide (Invitrogen) was added, diluted at 1:1000. After 5 min of incubation at room temperature, the sections were washed twice for 5 min each in PBS before being mounted in Glycergel (Dako). Characterization of the Polyclonal G3 Antibody and Detection of G3 Protein in Human and Rodent Kidney—Having previously identified a novel form of the H+-ATPase G subunit, G3 (9Smith A.N. Borthwick K.J. Karet F.E. Gene. 2002; 297: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we first wished to investigate the localization of this protein within the kidney (9Smith A.N. Borthwick K.J. Karet F.E. Gene. 2002; 297: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To do this, we raised a polyclonal anti-G3 antibody using two peptides that are not homologously present within G1 or G2. An initial Western blot of human membrane and cytosolic kidney preparations using affinity-purified antiserum against both immunizing peptides detected a band of the appropriate size (14 kDa) in the membrane and, to a much lesser extent, in cytosol (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2). Competition experiments, performed by incubating antiserum with a 3-fold excess of immunizing peptide prior to probing of the membrane, demonstrated that the immunogenic response was entirely to peptide 1 (Fig. 1, lane 4). Further experiments were therefore performed using affinity-purified antiserum against peptide 1 alone. By Western blot, this antibody specifically detects a 14-kDa protein in human, mouse, and rat kidney membrane fractions and, to a lesser extent, in cytosol (Fig. 2). Importantly, no band was seen from mouse brain preparations, demonstrating that the antibody does not cross-react with either the ubiquitous G1 protein or the brain-specific G2 protein. Although the antibody successfully and specifically labels G3 by Western blotting, positive immunostaining of kidney sections was not achievable using the G3-specific antibody, and epitope masking was suspected.FIGURE 2The antibody raised against G3 peptide 1 detects a 14-kDa protein in human, mouse, and rat membrane fractions (lanes 2, 4, and 6) and to a lesser extent in cytosol (lanes 1, 3, and 5). Importantly, no band was seen from mouse brain preparations (lanes 7 and 8), demonstrating that the antibody does not cross-react with either the ubiquitous G1 protein or the brain-specific G2 protein. Size markers in kDa are indicated at the left of the image, and an arrow indicates the band corresponding to the G3 protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Phage Display Analysis—To investigate this possibility and to identify the interacting moiety, phage display was employed using the immunizing G3 peptide 1 as bait. Following three rounds of panning of the phage display peptide library with G3 peptide 1, the most common phage sequence observed was LPLTPLP. When this sequence was used to search the human genome data base using the “short, nearly exact match” BLAST algorithm, an exact match of phage peptide amino acids 2–7 was found to amino acids 85–90 of the H+-ATPase subunit a4. This sequence is PLTPLP in a4 and PEVPFP in a1. The specific interaction between the a4 7-mer phage peptide and G3 peptide 1 was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (data not shown). We therefore hypothesized that the region of G3 represented by the immunizing peptide 1 directly interacts with the a4 subunit, and hence the epitope for the G3 antibody is masked by a4 in kidney sections. Confirmation of G3-a4 Interaction and Analysis of Possible Interactions between Other a and G Subunits—To confirm the interaction between G3 and a4 and investigate the likelihood that other G and a subunits are also able to interact, full-length human G3 and G1 were separately cloned into a bacterial expression vector-incorporating sequence to create an N-terminal RGS(His)6 epitope tag. Epitope-tagged G proteins were successfully expressed in BL21 E. coli and refolded on Ni-NTA beads against a decreasing gradient of urea prior to elution using PBS containing imidazole and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The soluble G protein was then rebound to Ni-NTA beads. Immobilized G3 was able to pull down the a4 subunit of the H+-ATPase from solubilized human kidney membrane preparations (detected by Western blot), confirming the initial G-a interaction identified by phage display (Fig. 3A). Following confirmation of the interaction between G3 and a4 subunits within the H+-ATPase of human kidney, we wanted to investigate the possibility that the G-a interaction is a general phenomenon among different H+-ATPases. The ubiquitously expressed a1 and G1 subunits are present in the kidney and inner ear, along with a4 and G3, which raises the possibility that they may be able to interact with each other and with the tissue-restricted subunits at these sites. Fig. 3 illustrates that this is the case; G3 was able to pull down the a1 subunit of the H+-ATPase from solubilized human kidney membrane preparations (Fig. 3A). In parallel, immobilized G1 protein was able to pull down both a4 and a1 subunits from solubilized human kidney membrane preparations, confirming for the first time an interaction between V1 and V0 domains previously observed ex vivo only in yeast and Thermus thermophilus (Fig. 3B). We and others 3U. Kornak, personal communication. have noted that all the available antibodies to a1 show a weak signal on Western blot, even in protein lysates where a1 should be present at high concentrations. Consequently, the signal from the pulldowns is less intense. Expression of Human G3 in Inner Ear and Male Genital Tract— In major organs, transcription of G3 has previously been shown to be restricted to kidney (9Smith A.N. Borthwick K.J. Karet F.E. Gene. 2002; 297: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In this study, we assessed several other body tissues. Expression of G3 was additionally detected by RT-PCR in inner ear epithelia but not in the testis or epididymis (Fig. 4). This indicates an important species difference, because in a previous study in rat, both G3 and G1 proteins were detected in narrow and clear cells of the epididymis (16Pietrement C. Sun-Wada G.H. Silva N.D. McKee M. Marshansky V. Brown D. Futai M. Breton S. Biol. Reprod. 2006; 74: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Nephron Segment RT-PCR—To begin to define the cell populations within the mammalian kidney that express G3, RT-PCR was performed on microdissected mouse nephrons (Fig. 5). Expression of murine G3 was detected throughout the post-glomerular tubule, except for the distal convoluted tubule. Localization of G3 in Human Kidney by in Situ Hybridization— Consistent with these RT-PCR findings, in situ hybridization on human kidney sections revealed mRNA from ATP6V1G3 in a subset of tubular structures, but no staining was evident in glomeruli. The strongest signal was observed in a subset of tubules with collecting duct morphology, particularly in medulla. Importantly, no co-localization was seen between G3 and the principal cell marker aquaporin 2, confirming that G3-positive cells in this segment are intercalated cells (Fig. 6). We previously described the cloning of human ATP6V1G3 along with two oth"
https://openalex.org/W2085389001,"Background Symbiotic relationships between leguminous plants (family Fabaceae) and nodule-forming bacteria in Australia native ecosystems remain poorly characterized despite their importance. Most studies have focused on temperate parts of the country, where the use of molecular approaches have already revealed the presence of Bradyrhizobium, Ensifer (formerly Sinorhizobium), Mesorhizobium and Rhizobium genera of legume root-nodule bacteria. We here provide the first molecular characterization of nodulating bacteria from tropical Australia. Methodology/Principal Findings 45 nodule-forming bacterial strains, isolated from eight native legume hosts at eight locations in Kakadu National Park, Northern Territory, Australia, were examined for their genetic diversity and phylogenetic position. Using SSU rDNA PCR-RFLPs and phylogenetic analyses, our survey identified nine genospecies, two of which, Bradyrhizobium genospp. B and P, had been previously identified in south-eastern Australia and one, Mesorhizobium genospecies AA, in southern France. Three of the five newly characterized Bradyrhizobium genospecies were more closely related to B. japonicum USDA110, whereas the other two belonged to the B. elkanii group. All five were each more closely related to strains sampled in various tropical areas outside Australia than to strains known to occur in Australia. We also characterized an entirely novel nodule-forming lineage, phylogenetically distant from any previously described rhizobial and non-rhizobial legume-nodulating lineage within the Rhizobiales. Conclusions/Significance Overall, the present results support the hypothesis of tropical areas being centres of biodiversity and diversification for legume root-nodule bacteria and confirm the widespread occurrence of Bradyrhizobium genosp.

We demonstrate that phosphorylation of serines 353 and 357 by glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) induces a structural change of the hydrophilic loop of PS1 that can also be mimicked by substitution of the phosphorylation sites by negatively charged amino acids in vitro and in cultured cells. The structural change of PS1 reduces the interaction with β-catenin leading to decreased phosphorylation and ubiquitination of β-catenin.

PS1 is also implicated in β-catenin-dependent signaling and directly binds via a large hydrophilic loop domain to β-catenin (18Murayama M. Tanaka S. Palacino J. Murayama O. Honda T. Sun X.

Fuchs E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E101-E108Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). In addition, a cytosolic pool of β-catenin acts in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway (22Logan C.Y. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 781-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (4274) Google Scholar, 23Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2251) Google Scholar). In the absence of Wnt signal, free cytosolic β-catenin undergoes phosphorylation by casein kinase 1α and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) that associate in an axin-dependent multiprotein complex (22Logan C.Y. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 781-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (4274) Google Scholar, 24Amit S. Hatzubai A. Birman Y. Andersen J.S. Ben Shushan E. Mann M. Neriah Y. Ben Alkalay I.

Cell. 2002; 110: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of β-catenin targets it for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. Activation of Wnt receptors leads to an accumulation of β-catenin in the cytosol by inhibition of its phosphorylation (26van Noort M. Meeldijk J. van der Zee R. Destree O. Clevers H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17901-17905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). This pool of β-catenin can translocate to the nucleus where it associates with members of the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor-1 (Tcf/Lef) family and regulates the expression of target genes (23Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2251) Google Scholar, 27Gregorieff A. Clevers H. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 877-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Aberrant Wnt signaling has been shown to be associated with tumorigenesis (22Logan C.Y. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 781-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (4274) Google Scholar, 27Gregorieff A. Clevers H. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 877-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 28Reya T. Clevers H. Nature. 2005; 434: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (3044) Google Scholar). In accordance with this, mutations in β-catenin and other proteins of the Wnt signaling pathway are the major cause of colon carcinomas (27Gregorieff A. Clevers H. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 877-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 28Reya T. Clevers H. Nature. 2005; 434: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (3044) Google Scholar). In these cells aberrantly high levels of β-catenin are observed that lead to increased nuclear signaling and the transcription of downstream genes. Of note, cells from PS1 knock-out mice also show elevated levels of β-catenin and increased expression of β-catenin target genes including CYCLIN D1 (29Soriano S. Kang D.E. Fu M. Pestell R. Chevallier N. Zheng H. Koo E.H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Moreover, PS1 knock-out mice with targeted expression of PS1 in brain neurons develop skin cancer (30Xia X. Qian S. Soriano S. Wu Y. Fletcher A.M. Wang X.J. Koo E.H. Wu X. Zheng H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10863-10868Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). It has been shown that PS1 can act as a scaffold protein, facilitating the phosphorylation of β-catenin by protein kinase A and GSK3β (25Kang D.E. Soriano S. Xia X. Eberhart C.G. de Strooper B. Zheng H. Koo E.H. Cell. 2002; 110: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that GSK3β also phosphorylates PS1 in vitro and it has been proposed that the phosphorylation of PS1 increases binding of β-catenin (31Kirschenbaum F. Hsu S.C. Cordell B. McCarthy J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7366-7375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, a functional role of this phosphorylation has not been demonstrated. In this study we sought to investigate the function of PS1 phosphorylation by GSK3β. We found that phosphorylation of PS1 at the GSK3β phosphorylation sites induces a structural change in the large hydrophilic loop domain of PS1 that could be mimicked by introduction of negatively charged amino acids. This conformational change strongly decreases the association of PS1 with β-catenin leading to reduced phosphorylation and increased stabilization of β-catenin thereby enhancing its signaling to the nucleus. cDNAs and Fusion Proteins—The phosphorylation site mutants of PS1 were generated by PCR techniques using appropriate oligonucleotides (sequences are available upon request). The resulting PCR fragments were subcloned into the EcoRI/XhoI restriction sites of pcDNA3.1 containing a Zeocin resistance gene (Invitrogen). All constructs were verified by sequencing of both strands. The fusion proteins of maltose-binding protein (MBP) and the hydrophilic loop domain of PS1 (amino acids (aa) 263–407) have been described earlier (32Walter J. Grunberg J. Capell A. Pesold B. Schindzielorz A. Citron M. Mendla K. George-Hyslop P.S. Multhaup G. Selkoe D.J. Haass C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5349-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, the coding region was amplified by PCR using the following primers: 5′-CCGAATTCTGTCCGAAAGGTCCA-3′ and 5′-CCGGATCCCTAGGTTGTGTTCCAGTC-3′. The resulting fragment was cloned into the EcoRI/BamHI restriction site of pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs). Shorter versions of the hydrophilic loop domains (aa 298–380) were generated using the following primers: 5′-CCGGAATTCATGGCAGAAGGAG-3′, 5′-ACGCGTCGACCTATTTTACTCCCC-3′. The resulting fragments were cloned into the EcoRI/SalI restriction sites of pMAL-c2. A glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein with β-catenin (aa 134–668) containing the binding region for PS1 was generated using the following primers: 5′-CGCGGATCCACCATGCAGTTGTCAATTTGATTAAC-3′, 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTACTGTGGCTTGTCCTCAGACA-3′. The resulting fragments were cloned into the BamHI/XhoI restriction sites of pGEX-5.1 (GE Healthcare). For the GST control protein the pGEX-5.1 vector was transformed. All fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α. MBP and GST fusion proteins were purified on amylose- or GSH-resin, respectively, according to the supplier’s instructions. Antibodies—Polyclonal antibody 3109 was raised against the hydrophilic loop domain (aa 263–407) of PS1. The MBP fusion proteins were purified as described above and inoculated into rabbits (Eurogentec). The monoclonal antibody against PS1 hydrophilic loop, APS18, has been described previously (6Capell A. Grunberg J. Pesold B. Diehlmann A. Citron M. Nixon R. Beyreuther K. Selkoe D.J. Haass C. J.

Antibodies against β-catenin (C2206) and phospho-specific anti-pSer33,37-β-catenin (C4231) were obtained from Sigma. The anti-ubiquitin (A-100) antibody was obtained from Boston Biochem. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with Glutamax (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). The HEK293 cell line stably overexpressing the β-amyloid precursor protein has been described previously (34Haass C. Schlossmacher M.G. Hung A.Y. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Mellon A. Ostaszewski B.L.

Transfections of cells with PS1 cDNAs were carried out using FuGENE 6 (Roche) according to the supplier’s instructions. Pools of stably expressing cells were generated by selection in 200 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). Cells were treated with the following compounds for the times indicated in the specific experiments: MG132 (5 μm, Sigma), okadaic acid (1 μm, Sigma), and GSK3β inhibitor VIII (Calbiochem, 10 μm, (35Bhat R.

Dephosphorylation experiments were carried out with shrimp alkaline phosphatase as described (32Walter J. Grunberg J. Capell A. Pesold B. Schindzielorz A. Citron M. Mendla K. George-Hyslop P.S.

Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE with the appropriate acrylamide concentrations and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by Western blotting techniques. Typically 25 μg of cell extract was loaded per well for Western immunoblotting. Proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence techniques (GE Healthcare). Immunoprecipitation—Specific proteins were immunoprecipitated with the respective antibodies, typically with 2–3 μl of serum or 1 μg of purified antibody. 20 μl of protein A-agarose (Zytomed) was used to bind the IgG over a 2–3-h shaking period at 4 °C. The bound protein-antibody complex was washed three times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2% Igepal). Pull-down Experiments—Purified recombinant proteins were incubated at a concentration of 1 μg/ml (GST or GST-β-catenin) and 0.5 μg/ml (MBP or MBP-PS1 hydrophilic loop) with 10 μl of GSH-Sepharose in 1 ml of PBS for 2 h at 4 °C. After binding, the Sepharose was washed 4 times with PBS. Samples were subsequently separated by SDS-PAGE and proteins detected by Western immunoblotting. Protein Purification—Chromatography was carried out using theAökta FPLC system and appropriate columns from GE Healthcare. The short versions of the hydrophilic loop were expressed in E. coli as described above and the cleared homogenate was applied to anion exchange chromatography (ResourceQ column; buffer A, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.7; buffer B, 1 m NaCl in buffer A; gradient, 10–35% buffer B over 15 column volumes; flow rate, 6 ml/min). After concentration by ultrafiltration (Amicon Ultra, Millipore), fusion proteins were cleaved by treatment with factor Xa according to the supplier’s instructions (New England Biolabs). The hydrophilic loop was separated from MBP by a second anion exchange chromatography (ResourceQ column, gradient: 7–28% buffer B over 25 column volumes, flow rate, 6 ml/min) and further purified to homogeneity by cation exchange chromatography (MonoS column: buffer A, 20 mm citrate buffer, pH 3.0; buffer B, buffer A with 1 m NaCl, gradient from 40 to 80% buffer B; flow rate, 1 ml/min). Gel filtration was carried out using a Superdex 75 10/300 column. Proteins were applied in PBS (running buffer; flow rate, 0.75 ml/min, 20 μg of purified protein) and the elution monitored by UV absorbance. In Vitro and in Vivo Phosphorylation of PS1—Phosphorylation of PS1 in cultured cells was carried out as described earlier (36Walter J. Grunberg J. Schindzielorz A. Haass C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5961-5967Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, a near confluent cell monolayer in a 21-cm2 culture dish was incubated for 45 min in phosphate-free media (Sigma). The media was aspirated, and phosphate-free media was added, together with 0.125 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate (Hartmann Analytical, Braunschweig, Germany). Cells were incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C. The conditioned media was then aspirated, and cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and immediately lysed on ice with lysis buffer (see below). Cell lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g, and supernatants were immunoprecipitated with specific anti-PS1 antibodies. Radiolabeled proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE as described above and detected by autoradiography/phosphorimaging. In vitro phosphorylation assays with recombinant GSK3β (New England Biolabs) were carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Phosphorylation reactions were started by addition of 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP and allowed to proceed for 20 min at 32 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer. Pulse-Chase Experiments—Cells were starved with methionine-free medium for 1 h and subsequently pulsed for 20 min with [35S]methionine containing medium (100 μCi/21-cm2 dish). After washing the cells with medium containing unlabeled methionine, cells were chased for the indicated times. Cells were subsequently fractionated as described below and proteins were isolated by immunoprecipitation. Cell Lysis and Fractionation—Cells were scraped off the culture dish and lysed for 30 min on ice (lysis buffer, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Igepal, Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche)). The lysate was then cleared by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 4 °C, 30 min) and the supernatant removed. Protein estimations were carried out by bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Perbio). In co-immunoprecipitation experiments cells were lysed in 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.2, containing 100 mm KCl, 100 mm potassium fluoride, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, Complete protease inhibitor, and 1% digitonin. For fractionation, cells were harvested and washed with PBS. Cells were then resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol and Complete protease inhibitor mixture) and left on ice for 15 min. Cells were then disrupted by passing the suspension through a 23-gauge syringe needle for 15 cycles and centrifugation at 200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant contained cytosolic and membrane fraction (see below). The pellet, containing the nuclear fraction, was resuspended in HEPES buffer, pH 7.2, containing 25% glycerol, 400 mm NaCl, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol and Complete protease inhibitor and agitated on ice for 20 min. The homogenate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and the supernatant, i.e. nuclear fraction, collected. Cytosolic and membrane fractions were separated by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 4 °C, 60 min). The supernatant, i.e. cytosolic fraction, was removed and the pellet, i.e. membrane fraction, was lysed in lysis buffer and centrifuged (16,000 × g, 4 °C, 15 min) to yield a debris-free sample. Cell Proliferation—Cell proliferation was assessed by measuring the metabolic activity using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reduction (37Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46864) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at a concentration of 35,000 cells/ml and cultured for 3 days. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and cells were left for 2 h. The precipitated formazan was dissolved overnight by addition of 10% SDS in 1 mm HCl and the absorbance measured at 570 nm. Luciferase Reporter Assay—Luciferase reporter assays were carried out as described (38Killick R. Pollard C.C. Asuni A.A. Mudher A.K. Richardson J.C. Rupniak H.T. Sheppard P.W. Varndell I.M. Brion J.P. Levey A.I. Levy O.A. Vestling M. Cowburn R. Lovestone S. Anderton B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48554-48561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 cells were seeded at 1 × 105/well in six-well plates, cultured for 24 h, and transfected with 300 ng of the pTOPflash or pFOPflash luciferase reporter constructs and 500 ng of β-catenin plus either PS1wt or one of the PS1 mutants. A constant amount of DNA was maintained by the addition of appropriate empty vector plasmid. Twenty-four h post-transfection the media was removed and the cells lysed for 5 min in 300 μl of Bright-Glo lysis buffer (Promega). The lysate was removed, vortexed, and briefly spun in a microcentrifuge. 150 μl of lysate supernatant was then combined with 150 μl of Bright-Glo luciferase assay reagent (Promega, half-life 30 min) and placed into a 24-well reader plate. Remaining lysate was used to check transfection efficiencies and expression levels by Western blotting. Luciferase activity was immediately measured in a Wallac 1450 Microbeta Trilux luminometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Data Analysis and Statistics—In metabolic labeling experiments, band intensities were analyzed with a phosphorimager (Fuji, FLA2000) and the Fuji Image Gauge 3.0 Software. For enhanced chemiluminescence detection, signals were measured and analyzed using an ECL imager (ChemiDoc™ XRS, Bio-Rad) and the Quantity One software package (Bio-Rad). Statistical analysis was carried out using Student’s t test or oneway analysis of variance with a Newman-Keuls multiple comparison post-test (GraphPad Prism, GraphPad Software). Significance values are as noted in the legends for Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6.FIGURE 4PS1 phosphorylation reduces β-catenin degradation.

https://openalex.org/W1964755688,"The muscle glycogen synthase gene (GYS1) has been associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D), the metabolic syndrome (MetS), male myocardial infarction and a defective increase in muscle glycogen synthase protein in response to exercise. We addressed the questions whether polymorphism in GYS1 can predict cardiovascular (CV) mortality in a high-risk population, if this risk is influenced by gender or physical activity, and if the association is independent of genetic variation in nearby apolipoprotein E gene (APOE).Polymorphisms in GYS1 (XbaIC>T) and APOE (-219G>T, epsilon2/epsilon3/epsilon4) were genotyped in 4,654 subjects participating in the Botnia T2D-family study and followed for a median of eight years. Mortality analyses were performed using Cox proportional-hazards regression. During the follow-up period, 749 individuals died, 409 due to CV causes. In males the GYS1 XbaI T-allele (hazard ratio (HR) 1.9 [1.2-2.9]), T2D (2.5 [1.7-3.8]), earlier CV events (1.7 [1.2-2.5]), physical inactivity (1.9 [1.2-2.9]) and smoking (1.5 [1.0-2.3]) predicted CV mortality. The GYS1 XbaI T-allele predicted CV mortality particularly in physically active males (HR 1.7 [1.3-2.0]). Association of GYS1 with CV mortality was independent of APOE (219TT/epsilon4), which by its own exerted an effect on CV mortality risk in females (2.9 [1.9-4.4]). Other independent predictors of CV mortality in females were fasting plasma glucose (1.2 [1.1-1.2]), high body mass index (BMI) (1.0 [1.0-1.1]), hypertension (1.9 [1.2-3.1]), earlier CV events (1.9 [1.3-2.8]) and physical inactivity (1.9 [1.2-2.8]).Polymorphisms in GYS1 and APOE predict CV mortality in T2D families in a gender-specific fashion and independently of each other. Physical exercise seems to unmask the effect associated with the GYS1 polymorphism, rendering carriers of the variant allele less susceptible to the protective effect of exercise on the risk of CV death, which finding could be compatible with a previous demonstration of defective increase in the glycogen synthase protein in carriers of this polymorphism."

This raises the question whether nucleic acids are endowed with other attributes that can contribute to their biological functions. In this work, we present a calculation of thermodynamic stability of DNA/DNA and mRNA/DNA duplexes across the genomes of four species in the genus Saccharomyces by nearest-neighbor method. The results show that coding regions are more thermodynamically stable than introns, 3'-untranslated regions and intergenic sequences. Furthermore, open reading frames have more stable sense mRNA/DNA duplexes than the potential antisense duplexes, a property that can aid gene discovery. The lower stability of the DNA/DNA and mRNA/DNA duplexes of 3'-untranslated regions and the higher stability of genes correlates with increased mRNA level. These results suggest that the thermodynamic stability of DNA/DNA and mRNA/DNA duplexes affects mRNA transcription."

We sought to examine the association of beta-agonist use and the Arg16Gly polymorphism with lung function and mortality among participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study.We genotyped study participants and analyzed the association of the Arg16Gly polymorphism and beta-agonist use with lung function at baseline and clinical examination three years later and with all-cause mortality during 10 years of follow-up. Lung function was characterized by percent-predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second. Associations were examined separately for blacks and whites. Black beta-agonist users with the Arg/Arg genotype had better lung function at baseline and at the second clinical visit than those with Arg/Gly and Gly/Gly genotypes. Adjusted mean percent-predicted FEV(1) was 21% higher in Arg/Arg subjects compared to Gly/Gly at baseline (p = 0.01) and 20% higher than Gly/Gly at visit 2 (p = 0.01). Arg/Gly subjects had adjusted percent-predicted FEV(1) 17% lower than Arg/Arg at baseline but were similar to Arg/Arg subjects at visit 2. Although black beta-agonist users with the Arg/Arg genotype appeared to have better crude survival rates, the association between genotype and all-cause mortality was inconclusive. We found no difference in lung function or mortality by genotype among blacks who did not use beta-agonists or among whites, regardless of beta-agonist use.Black beta-agonist users with the ADRB2 Arg16Arg genotype had better lung function, and, possibly, better overall survival compared to black beta-agonist users with the Gly16Gly genotype. Our findings highlight the need for additional studies of sufficient size and statistical power to allow examination of outcomes among beta-agonist users of different races and genotypes."

By using publicly available reference genotype data from the International HapMap, we show that 93.6% sensitivity at <5% false positive rate can be obtained with only four probes per SNP, compared with 98.3% with the full data set. Removal of this redundancy will allow for more comprehensive whole-genome association studies with increased SNP density and larger sample sizes."
https://openalex.org/W2104710187,"Amyloid fibrils are associated with a range of human disorders. Understanding the conversion of amyloidogenic proteins from their soluble forms to amyloid fibrils is critical for developing effective therapeutics. Previously we showed that T7 endonuclease I forms amyloid-like fibrils. Here we study the mechanism of the amyloidogenic conversion of T7 endonuclease I. We show that T7 endonuclease I forms fibrils at pH 6.8, but not at pH 6.0 or 8.0. The amyloidogenicity at pH 6.8 is not correlated with thermodynamic stability, unfolding cooperativity, or solubility. Thermal melting experiments at various pH values show that the protein has a distinctive thermal transition at pH 6.8. The transition at pH 6.8 has a lower transition temperature than the unfolding transitions observed at pH 6.0 and 8.0 and leads to a β-rich conformation instead of an unfolded state. Electron microscopy shows that the thermal transition at pH 6.8 results in fibril formation. The thermal transition at pH 6.8 leads to a protein state that is not accessible at pH 6.0 or 8.0, showing that the existence of the amyloidogenic conformation of T7 endonuclease I depends sensitively on solution conditions. Therefore, we propose that fibrillizing proteins need to be “prepared” for fibrillization. Preparation may consist of amino acid replacements or changing solution conditions and may require retention of some aspects of native structure.

Deposition of amyloid fibrils is associated with a range of human disorders, including Alzheimer disease, type II diabetes mellitus, and the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. For 25 amyloid diseases, specific proteins have been identified as the major fibril component (1Westermark P. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 5942-5949Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Although amyloid fibrils involved in different diseases share common properties such as fibrillar morphology, affinity to Congo red, and the cross-β x-ray diffraction pattern, their protein components share little similarity in their primary sequences or native structures. An important prerequisite for globular proteins to fibrillize is a conformational change into an amyloidogenic state, a conformation that enables oligomerization and fibrillization through specific intermolecular interactions (2Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1698: 131-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar, 3Rochet J.C. Lansbury P.T. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Despite extensive research, the molecular basis of the conformational conversion to the amyloidogenic state is still not fully understood. Thermodynamic stability has been proposed as a major determinant for the amyloidogenic conversion of globular proteins (5Cohen F.E. Pan K.M. Huang Z. Baldwin M. Fletterick R.J. Prusiner S.B. Science. 1994; 264: 530-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). In fact in vitro conversion of proteins to fibrils often requires conditions that destabilize native structures (6Guijarro J.I. Sunde M. Jones J.A. Campbell I.D. Dobson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

At the same time, there is also evidence that a substantial fraction of amyloidogenic mutations have little or no effect on protein stability. Studies on prion variants associated with familial forms of prion diseases revealed that some variants have the same stability as the wild-type protein (14Liemann S. Glockshuber R.

Polymorphism at residue 129 of the prion protein, which is known to strongly affect the susceptibility to prion disease, does not correlate with the stability of the prion protein (16Hosszu L.L.

Length of polyglutamine expansion in ataxin-3 associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 was shown not to affect protein stability (17Chow M.K.M. Ellisdon A.M. Cabrita L.D. Bottomley S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47643-47651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Similarly, stability of transthyretin variants associated with familial amyloid polyneuropathies is not always correlated with disease severity (18Hammarstroöm P. Jiang X. Hurshman A.R. Powers E.T. Kelly J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16427-16432Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). These results suggest that destabilization of the native structure is not a general mechanism for amyloidogenic conversion. Other protein properties have also been proposed to be the molecular basis of the amyloidogenic conversion. Dumoulin et al. (19Dumoulin M. Canet D. Last A.M. Pardon E. Archer D.B. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. Matagne A. Robinson C.V. Redfield C. Dobson C.M. J. Mol.

Schmittschmitt and Scholtz (20Schmittschmitt J.P. Scholtz J.M.

In this work, we have studied the molecular mechanism of the amyloidogenic conversion of T7 endonuclease I (T7EI), 2The abbreviations used are: T7EI, T7 endonuclease I; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; EM, electron microscopy; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; SH3, Src homology 3; deg, degree. 2The abbreviations used are: T7EI, T7 endonuclease I; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; EM, electron microscopy; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; SH3, Src homology 3; deg, degree. a DNA junction-resolving enzyme from bacteriophage T7. T7EI exists naturally as a domain-swapped dimer as shown from its crystal structure (21Hadden J.M. Convery M.A. Declais A.C. Lilley D.M.J. Phillips S.E.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 62-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Previously we found that T7EI forms fibrils that have amyloid properties, including fibrillar morphology, binding to dyes Congo red and thioflavin T, and cross-β diffraction pattern (22Guo Z. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8042-8047Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Using protein engineering, we showed that T7EI forms fibrils by a runaway domain-swapping mechanism in which each protein molecule swaps a domain into the complementary domain of the adjacent molecule in the fibril (22Guo Z. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8042-8047Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Here we have investigated the dependence of fibril formation on solution pH and compared the stability and thermal melting behavior of T7EI at different pH values. Implications of our findings in terms of the molecular basis of the amyloidogenic conversion are discussed. Protein Expression and Purification—The T7EI proteins containing an E65K mutation were expressed and purified as previously described (22Guo Z. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8042-8047Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and then buffer-exchanged to buffer A (50 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.0, 40 mm NaCl), buffer B (50 mm MOPS, pH 6.8, 40 mm NaCl), or buffer C (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 40 mm NaCl) using a 5-ml HisTrap column (Amersham Biosciences) according to pH requirements. Protein concentration was determined by UV absorption at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 24.75 × 103 m-1 cm-1. Gel Electrophoresis—Gel electrophoresis was performed using PhastSystem (Amersham Biosciences). For native PAGE, native buffer strips for basic proteins (2% agarose, 4.4% β-alanine, and 4% acetic acid) were prepared, and 4–15% gradient PhastGel was used. Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy—CD spectroscopy was performed on a Jasco J-715 spectrometer equipped with a Jasco PTC-348 temperature controller. For equilibrium unfolding, T7EI proteins in buffers A, B, or C were diluted to 10 μm with the same buffer containing increasing concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) and were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. CD signal at 222 nm was recorded at 20 °C in a 0.01-cm cell (Starna Cells) by averaging the signal over 30 s. For thermal melting, the ellipticity was monitored at 222 nm. CD cells with 0.1-cm path lengths (Starna Cells) were used. Temperature was ramped at 2°/min with a range of 4–90 °C. Protein concentrations were adjusted to 20 μm in buffers A, B, or C. The experiments were done in duplicates. For far-UV wavelength scan, CD cells with 0.01-cm path lengths were used, and protein concentrations were adjusted to 85–110 μm in 5× diluted buffers A, B, or C. For the CD analysis of T7EI fibrils, T7EI proteins in buffer B were incubated at 37 °C for 6 days. Then the fibrils were separated from soluble fractions using a 100-kDa cutoff Microcon YM-100 centrifugal filter unit (Millipore) and washed twice with buffer B using the 100-kDa cutoff filter. Estimation of protein secondary structure from CD spectra was performed using the CDSSTR method with the 43-protein reference set included with CDPro software (23Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2445) Google Scholar). Analysis of Equilibrium Unfolding Data—The unfolding data were analyzed with nonlinear least-squares fitting as described in Santoro and Bolen (24Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar) to obtain ΔGu→FH2O, the free energy of unfolding, and the m-value, dependence of the free energy of unfolding in the presence of GdnHCl on the concentrations of GdnHCl. Electron Microscopy (EM)—For EM, fibril samples were applied onto glow discharged 400-mesh copper grids covered with formvar/carbon film (Ted Pella) and stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Samples were examined under a Hitachi H-7000 electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 75 kV. Protein Solubility Analysis—To determine protein solubility, T7EI solutions were concentrated using a 30-kDa cutoff Amicon centrifugal filter unit (Millipore) until visible precipitates were observed. The concentrated protein was filtered through a 100-kDa cutoff filter to remove precipitates. Then protein concentration was determined by UV absorption at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 24.75 × 103 m-1 cm-1. We find that fibril formation of T7EI depends on solution pH. At pH 6.8, T7EI forms aggregates upon incubation at 37 °C, as shown by the high molecular mass band on native PAGE gel (Fig. 1). EM reveals that these aggregates are composed of protein fibrils (Fig. 2b). We have previously shown that these fibrils have amyloid-like properties such as binding to Congo red and thioflavin T and a cross-β x-ray diffraction pattern (22Guo Z. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8042-8047Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). At pH 6.0 or 8.0, however, T7EI remains soluble after incubation at 37 °C for 3 days, as judged by native gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1). No fibrils were observed when the samples at pH 6.0 and 8.0 were viewed under an electron microscope (Fig. 2, a and c). However, we observed some amorphous aggregates for the samples of pH 6.0 and 8.0 (Fig. 2, a and c). These aggregates probably formed during sample preparation for EM because of high protein concentration (6 mg/ml).FIGURE 2Electron micrographs of T7EI incubated at 37 °C for 3 days. a, pH 6.0. b, pH 6.8. c, pH 8.0.

The unfolding of T7EI in the presence of GdnHCl is >95% reversible judged from the recovery of the CD spectrum (data not shown). Under all three pH conditions, the unfolding of T7EI is best characterized by a two-state transition, without any detectable intermediates (Fig. 3). Thermodynamic parameters of unfolding were obtained by fitting the unfolding data to a two-state model (see “Experimental Procedures”), and the results are listed in Table 1. We find that T7EI is most stable at pH 8.0 and least stable at pH 6.0, so the amyloidogenicity of T7EI does not correlate with thermodynamic stability. Cooperativity of unfolding, represented by the m-value, does not correlate with amyloidogenicity either, as the m-value of T7EI at pH 6.8 is higher than that at pH 6.0 but lower than that at pH 8.0. We also find that T7EI is most soluble at pH 6.0 and least soluble at pH 8.0, with solubility of 771 ± 4, 594 ± 6, and 309 ± 5 μm at pH 6.0, 6.8, and 8.0, respectively. Thus, correlation is absent between any of protein stability, cooperativity of unfolding, or solubility and amyloidogenicity of T7EI.TABLE 1Changes in the free energies of unfolding of T7EI Notice that at the amyloidogenic pH of 6.8, the native protein is intermediate in both stability ( ΔGu→FH2O) and cooperativity of unfolding (m-value).

We find that T7EI is denatured at pH 6.0 and 8.0 with a transition region that starts at ∼55 °C (Fig. 4, a and c). The denaturation of T7EI at pH 6.0 and 8.0 is irreversible, as evidenced by visible precipitates in the CD cell and loss of CD signal when temperature is decreased below the transition region. The mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm ([θ]222 nm) of T7EI changes from ∼-7000 deg cm2 dmol-1 to ∼-1000 deg cm2 dmol-1 upon denaturation at both pH 6.0 and 8.0, indicating loss of secondary structure. The melting curve at pH 6.8 has characteristics that are different from those at pH 6.0 or 8.0 (Fig. 4b). Although thermal melting at pH 6.8 also leads to irreversible changes of CD signal, there are no visible aggregates in the CD cell, suggesting that thermal melting at pH 6.8 leads to soluble oligomers. Thermal melting at pH 6.8 changes [θ]222 nm from ∼-7000 deg cm2 dmol-1 to ∼-5000 deg cm2 dmol-1, suggesting that most of the secondary structure remains intact. The transition region at pH 6.8 starts at ∼45 °C, 10 °C lower than that at pH 6.0 or 8.0, suggesting that the transition at pH 6.8 requires smaller free energy change than the transition at pH 6.0 or 8.0. Further studies with far-UV CD show that thermal denaturation at pH 6.0 or 8.0 is accompanied by nearly complete loss of CD signal because of precipitation of the protein (Fig. 5, a and c), whereas thermal transition at pH 6.8 leads to a conformation that is characterized by the existence of significant amount of secondary structure (Fig. 5b). Computational analysis of the secondary structure from far-UV CD spectra shows that, at pH 6.8, thermal transition leads to a β-rich conformation (Fig. 5b, inset). Far-UV CD analysis of the T7EI fibrils show that its CD spectrum is very similar to the CD spectrum of T7EI at 80 °C at pH 6.8, consistent with the idea that the 45 °C transition at pH 6.8 is an amyloidogenic transition (Fig. 6).FIGURE 5Far-UV CD spectra of T7EI at three pH values and two temperatures. a, pH 6.0. b, pH 6.8. c, pH 8.0.

Incubation of T7EI samples (20 μm) at pH 6.0 or 8.0 for 10 min results in the appearance of amorphous aggregates (Fig. 7, a and b), consistent with the CD results (Fig. 5, a and c). Incubation of T7EI samples at pH 6.8 at 80 °C for 1–5 min leads to formation of globular oligomers, and incubation for 10 min results in formation of fibrils (Fig. 7c). These results show that the thermal transition at pH 6.8 is indeed an amyloidogenic transition. The Amyloidogenic Conversion of T7EI Does Not Correlate with Thermodynamic Stability, Unfolding Cooperativity, or Solubility—We find that T7EI forms amyloid-like fibrils at pH 6.8, but changing the solution pH to 6.0 or 8.0 abolishes fibril formation as judged by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1) and EM (Fig. 2). Our finding of a dependence of fibril formation on solution pH provides an opportunity to study the molecular basis of fibrillization by comparing the intrinsic properties of T7EI at different pH values. Previous studies had suggested that the property of adopting an amyloidogenic conformation may be determined by thermodynamic stability (10Hurle M.R. Helms L.R. Li L. Chan W.N. Wetzel R. Proc. Natl.

Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2374-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We find that the amyloidogenicity of T7EI does not correlate with any of these, suggesting that these properties by themselves cannot account for the amyloidogenic conversion of T7EI from a native conformation to an amyloidogenic conformation (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Our results are consistent with the findings of several other studies that amyloidogenicity cannot be attributed simply to thermodynamic stability (14Liemann S. Glockshuber R.

Thermal Melting of T7EI Reveals an Amyloidogenic Transition at pH 6.8, but Not at pH 6.0 or 8.0—In order to investigate the basis of the amyloidogenicity of T7EI at pH 6.8, we studied the thermal melting of T7EI at three pH values. To our surprise, we found that T7EI shows a thermal transition at pH 6.8 distinctly different from those at pH 6.0 and 8.0. At pH 6.0 and 8.0, T7EI displays a normal thermal denaturation curve as monitored by CD. As the temperature increases to ∼55 °C, the CD signal changes abruptly, characteristic of a transition region in which protein cooperatively unfolds to a denatured state (Fig. 4, a and c, and Fig. 5, a and c). Thermal transition at pH 6.8, however, differs from those at pH 6.0 and pH 8.0 in a number of ways. The thermal transition region at pH 6.8 starts around 45 °C, 10 °C lower than that at pH 6.0 or 8.0 (Fig. 4b). More importantly, the thermal transition at pH 6.8 does not lead to a denatured state as seen at pH 6.0 or 8.0. Instead, a β-rich conformation is observed following the thermal transition at pH 6.8 (Fig. 5b). This β-rich conformation is similar to the conformation of T7EI fibrils formed by incubation at 37 °C, as shown by the CD spectrum of T7EI fibrils (Fig. 6). The CD spectrum of this β-rich conformation also shares characteristics with the amyloidogenic intermediates of at least 11 other proteins (2Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1698: 131-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar), including SH3 domain (6Guijarro J.I. Sunde M. Jones J.A. Campbell I.D. Dobson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4224-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar), α-synuclein (25Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10737-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar), and Aβ (26Kirkitadze M.D. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 1103-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The CD spectra of these amyloidogenic intermediates all have an ellipticity of ∼-10,000 deg cm2 dmol-1 at 200 nm and an ellipticity of about -5000 deg cm2 dmol-1 near 222 nm (2Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1698: 131-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). Our EM studies confirmed that the thermal transition at pH 6.8 is an amyloidogenic transition that leads to fibrillization (Fig. 7c). What is the structural basis of the amyloidogenic transition at pH 6.8? Studies of a T7EI double cysteine mutant show that T7EI forms fibrils via a runaway domain-swapping mechanism, in which each protein molecule swaps a domain into the complementary domain of the adjacent molecule in the fibril (22Guo Z. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8042-8047Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The fibril formation of T7EI requires opening of the domain-swapped dimer to form an open-ended dimer, and the open-ended dimer can form higher order oligomers readily. Therefore, we postulate that, as depicted in Fig. 8, the amyloidogenic transition at pH 6.8 corresponds to the formation of the open-ended dimer, whereas the thermal transition at pH 6.0 or 8.0 is a denaturation step. The formation of open-ended dimer requires disruption of only one of the two domain-swapped dimer interfaces, so the energy change for this transition would be smaller than that of complete unfolding. This feature is consistent with the observation that the transition at pH 6.8 starts at ∼10 °C lower than the transition at pH 6.0 or 8.0 (Fig. 4). In addition, the formation of open-ended dimer would not completely disrupt the secondary structure of the protein, consistent with the result of far-UV CD measurement (Fig. 5b). Examination of the crystal structure of T7EI suggests that the pH dependence of fibrillization may be due to the interaction between His-85 of one subunit and Pro-42′ of the other subunit in the domain-swapped dimer (Fig. 9). Because the fibril formation of T7EI is modulated by pH in a range of 6.0 to 8.0, residues that are sensitive to pH changes in this range are presumably histidines. T7EI protein contains four histidines at positions 50, 78, 85, and 116. Histidines 50, 78, and 116 are involved in intramolecular interactions, but His-85 interacts with Pro-42′ of the other subunit in the domain-swapped dimer. The His-85-Pro-42′ interaction stabilizes the domain-swapped dimer and thus prevents the formation of the open-ended dimer. Therefore, changing solution pH could change His-85-Pro-42′ interaction and subsequently fibril formation. The involvement of His-85 in the pH-dependent domain swapping could be tested by measuring the pKa of His-85 by NMR. It is possible that other residues also contribute to this transition. The full atomic details of the pH dependence of fibrillization require further investigation. The amyloidogenic transition at pH 6.8 may not result solely from pH effects. We used citrate, MOPS, and phosphate for buffers at pH 6.0, 6.8, and 8.0, respectively (see “Experimental Procedures”); it is possible that these buffers interact with the protein and contribute to the amyloidogenic conversion or the absence of amyloidogenic conversion. It is known that different ions could have dramatic effects on protein folding and stability, a phenomenon known as Hofmeister ion effects (27Baldwin R.L. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2056-2063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). However, our results show that the amyloidogenic conversion at pH 6.8 does not correlate with protein solubility and stability, which are often indicators of Hofmeister ion effects, suggesting that Hofmeister ion effects may play a limited role in the amyloidogenic conversion at pH 6.8. A complete understanding of the amyloidogenic conversion at pH 6.8 would require an investigation of all possible factors that affect folding, stability, and conformational changes of a protein. Implications for the Molecular Basis of the Amyloidogenic Conversion—The mechanism of the amyloidogenic conversion of globular proteins has been largely attributed to destabilization of the native structure (5Cohen F.E.

A. 2000; 97: 8979-8984Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). One assumption underlying the protein stability hypothesis is that the amyloidogenic state exists in the conformational ensemble of a protein and is in equilibrium with the native state. Therefore, destabilization of the native structure would increase the population of the amyloidogenic conformer. Once the concentration of the amyloidogenic conformer exceeds some critical concentration, stable fibril seeds form and fibrillization occurs (28Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 385-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). Supporting evidence for this hypothesis includes that in vitro fibril formation usually requires partially denaturing conditions and that mutations associated with familial forms of amyloid diseases often decrease protein stability (6Guijarro J.I.

Glockshuber R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3258-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 15Swietnicki W. Petersen R.B. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol.

A. 2002; 99: 16427-16432Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Such an example is the present work, in which we have shown that the amyloidogenicity of T7EI at pH 6.8 does not correlate with protein stability (Table 1). To explain the amyloidogenic conversion of T7EI, we present a “preparation” model as illustrated in Fig. 10. We propose that the conformational ensemble of a protein is modulated by protein sequence and solution conditions and the amyloidogenic state exists only in certain conformational ensembles. We refer to the protein conformational ensemble containing the amyloidogenic conformer as the “prepared” ensemble and the one without the amyloidogenic conformer as the unprepared ensemble. Only proteins of a prepared ensemble can form amyloid fibrils, and once a protein is prepared, destabilization becomes the primary mechanism for fibrillization. The key point of the preparation model is the existence of a protein conformational ensemble that does not contain the amyloidogenic conformer. In the case of T7EI, at pH 6.8, the thermal melting curve shows a 45 °C transition that leads to the accumulation of amyloidogenic conformers and fibril formation (Figs. 4b and 7c). At pH 6.0 and 8.0, the thermal melting experiments show that the 45 °C transition does not exist and only a 55 °C transition leading to amorphous aggregation is observed, suggesting that the amyloidogenic conformer does not exist under these conditions (Figs. 4a and c, and 7, a and b). We conclude that the inability of T7EI to form fibrils at pH 6.0 and 8.0 results from the absence of the amyloidogenic conformer. We also show that, for a prepared conformational ensemble, destabilization of the native structure facilitates fibril formation. At pH 6.8, it takes 3 days for T7EI to form fibrils at 37 °C (Figs. 1 and 2), but it takes only 10 min for T7EI to form fibrils at 80 °C (Fig. 7c). Therefore, the preparation model complements the protein stability hypothesis by providing additional explanations for the effects of amino acid replacements and solution conditions on amyloid fibril formation. The preparation model is consistent with a large body of experimental data. This model can explain why some amyloid-enhancing mutations do not decrease protein stability (14Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3258-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 15Swietnicki W. Petersen R.B. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol.

A. 2002; 99: 16427-16432Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In this case, the mutations prepare the protein for amyloid formation by making the amyloidogenic state accessible without affecting protein stability. Mutations could affect the folding kinetics and the formation of various intermediate states of a nascent polypeptide chain and thus determine the accumulation of aggregation-prone conformers. In addition, fibril formation in vitro often requires specific solution conditions, not just any partially denaturing conditions. For example, it was shown that complete or partial unfolding of human muscle acylphosphatase is not by itself sufficient for fibril formation in the absence of trifluoroethanol (29Calamai M. Chiti F. Dobson C.M. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 4201-4210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Fibrillization of β2-microglobulin in vitro was shown to be critically dependent on the pH and the ionic strength of the solution (30McParland V.J. Kad N.M. Kalverda A.P. Brown A. Kirwin-Jones P. Hunter M.G. Sunde M. Radford S.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8735-8746Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Requirement of specific solution conditions suggests that the amyloidogenic conformation exists only in these conditions, consistent with the preparation model. At a structural level, the preparation model suggests that the amyloidogenic conversion requires specific conformational changes rather than general unfolding. General unfolding only changes the population of various conformers in the conformational ensemble toward the high energy state without creating new conformers. If the amyloidogenic conformer did not exist in the protein conformational ensemble, fibrillization would not occur by simply changing the relative energy level of various conformers. Specific conformational changes may include retention of some native structures, as several studies suggest that amyloid formation can start from native-like state (17Chow M.K.M. Ellisdon A.M.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7808-7815Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In the case of domain-swapped proteins such as T7EI, the dimer interface has to be preserved in order to take advantage of native interactions. We postulate that similar native-like interactions may also be preserved in other systems where fibrillization starts from native-like structures. For example, it was shown that fibril formation of β2-microglobulin is controlled by the cis-trans isomerization of Pro-32 (35Eakin C.M. Berman A.J. Miranker A.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 36Jahn T.R. Parker M.J. Homans S.W. Radford S.E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), and the fibrillization can be catalyzed by binding to Cu2+ (35Eakin C.M. Berman A.J. Miranker A.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Fibrillization of the chicken α-spectrin SH3 domain requires a specific single mutation in the protein sequence (37Morel B. Casares S. Conejero-Lara F. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 453-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These findings support the idea that specific conformational changes and native-like interactions are important for amyloid fibril formation. We thank David M. J.
