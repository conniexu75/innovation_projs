https://openalex.org/W1998489039,"Many studies have been made of ancient Greek topography, some of the more recent ones based on modern techniques. However, most still ignore the subsurface dimension of coastal and other environments and hence fail to fully explain coastal and alluvial-colluvial processes, rates of change of geomorphology, and the effects of coastal change on humans. In this article subsurface geological analyses have been used to elucidate paleogeographic coastal settings of major archaeological sites around the Aegean Sea. Similar approaches could be applied in the Middle and Far East and elsewhere in the Mediterranean."
https://openalex.org/W2022401409,A study of absorption bands in simulated lunar glasses resulted in the discovery of a Ti(4+)-O(2-) charge transfer band at 0.26 micrometer and two Fe(2+)-Ti(4+) bands at 0.34 and 0.42 micrometer. These results indicate that the properties of lunar soil are somewhat affected by the glass content but are controlled by other factors.
https://openalex.org/W2018387986,"Sulfate particles (sulfuric acid and its neutralization products with ammonia) dominate the submicrometer-sized, light-scattering component of the aerosol in more than 90 percent of 2850 pairs of humidographic measurements made over a 3-month period at three rural midwestern and southern sites. The nearly continuous optical dominance by sulfate in the aerosol at these spatially varied locations, particularly in the Ozark Mountains, suggests that sulfate is a component of the submicrometer-sized aerosol that is distributed over a large geographical region and is not due to local sources."

https://openalex.org/W2026636548,The discovery of abundant skeletal remains of Felis trumani from a late Pleistocene deposit in Wyoming shows that it was as highly modified for cursorial locomotion as the cheetah (Acinonyx). Several other Pleistocene felids that have been regarded as pumas seem to be related forms. The late Pleistocene fauna of the Big Horn Basin in Wyoming is dominated by cursorial taxa.

https://openalex.org/W2044774383,Pyrope garnet (Mg(3)Al(2)Si(3)O(12)) has been found to transform to an ilmenite-type phase at a loading pressure between 240 and 250 kilobars and at about 1000 degrees to 1400 degrees C in a diamond-anvil press coupled with laser heating. The lattice parameters for the ilmenite-type phase of (Mg(.75) Al(.25))(Si(.75) Al(.25))O(3) are a(0) = 4.755 +/- 0.002 and c(0) = 13.360 +/- 0.005 angstroms. The zero-pressure volume change associated with the garnet-ilmenite transition is calculated to be -7.1 percent. This result verifies the prediction that pyrope garnet would transform to the ilmenite structure at high pressure first suggested in 1962 by Clark et al. and Ringwood.

https://openalex.org/W2002315389,"Large-scale district heating, using waste heat rejected by electric power plants and other sources, is presented as a means of reducing significantly the amount of fossil fuel consumed for residential and commercial space and water heating in the United States. Analysis of the technical and economic aspects of model district heating systems for nine U.S. urban areas shows that district heat service to residential and commercial consumers would be economically attractive. Projections of national service levels show that up to half of the U.S. population could be served by district heating at costs that are competitive with the present costs of imported oil and also with projected costs of new energy forms. An advantage of district heat over the latter is that it is a proved, simple technology."
