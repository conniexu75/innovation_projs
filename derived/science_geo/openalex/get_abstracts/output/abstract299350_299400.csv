https://openalex.org/W2034690972,"To understand resource partitioning, essentially a community phenomenon, we require a holistic theory that draws upon models at the individual and population level. Yet some investigators are still content mainly to document differences between species, a procedure of only limited interest. Therefore, it may be useful to conclude with a list of questions appropriate for studies of resource partitioning, questions this article has related to the theory in a preliminary way. 1) What is the mechanism of competition? What is the relative importance of predation? Are differences likely to be caused by pressures toward reproductive isolation? 2) Are niches (utilizations) regularly spaced along a single dimension? 3) How many dimensions are important, and is there a tendency for more dimensions to be added as species number increases? 4) Is dimensional separation complementary? 5) Which dimensions are utilized, how do they rank in importance, and why? How do particular dimensions change in rank as species nuimber increases? 6) What is the relation of dimensional separation to difference in phenotypic indicators? To what extent does the functional relation of phenotype to resource characteristics constrain partitioning? 7) What is the distance between mean position of niches, what is the niche standard deviation, and what is the ratio of the two? What is the niche shape?"

Although only one bird at a time could have access to the buttons, the pecks of the group were treated as an aggregate. When they chose between two buttons, each of which could occasionally produce grain, the ratios of pecks at the buttons approximately equaled the ratios of the grain presentations obtained from them. This accords with a relation well substantiated in the laboratory, the matching law. It suggests that the matching law may apply to the behavior of higher organisms in natural environments."
https://openalex.org/W2004256604,"World population and world income can grow at any likely rate for the next 50 to 75 years, probably for longer, and mineral supplies will continue to keep pace with demand. Not, however, without environmental costs, without affecting Third World development, and, perhaps most important, without ignoring critical questions of power. In what might be termed the revisionist form of the limits to growth thesis, Aurelio Peccei and Alexander King, cofounders of the Club of Rome, seem to be saying that the forecasts of doom themselves are unimportant but they symbolize critical problems of the nature and uses of power in the modern world (30): . . . the Club of Rome is questioning the quality of growth and its distribution around the world. . . . We know that the present structure of the world is obsolete. . . . Both private and state capitalism are stale . . . we have to develop something else. Surely, continually increasing rates of mineral production are symptoms of this obsolete power structure, a result of the fact that, ultimately, population growth and monetary income growth lead to demands for natural resources that necessitate their being found and produced regardless of the implications. Since such higher rates of production are geologically and economically sustainable, we should choose among alternative paths of growth, and hence among alternative rates of mineral resource development, according to what we like or dislike about these implications. The key information will not be found in tables comparing reserves and consumption but in preferences and ethics."

The identification of this mineral and previously reported chlorapatite were made by x-ray diffraction; the results do not confirm the postulated existence of meteoritic merrillite. Some other remarks pertaining to the existence of merrillite are presented."

The duration of the accompanying ""light-shock reaction"" daily became longer at times early in the dark period and shorter at times in the later hours of darkness."
https://openalex.org/W2001182118,"The elongating internodes of the axis of a vigorous dicotyledonous plant develop strong curvatures if the tropistic effect of gravity is eliminated on a clinostat. Similar curvatures are produced by unbalancing either the supply of auxin or its transport paths, but only in the absence of unidirectional gravity as a distributive force."

https://openalex.org/W1991461645,"Sensitive clay masses that lie dormant for years but, as the result of a sudden shock, become turbulent, flowing mud, have been called quick clays. Such masses may move in quantity over almost flat terrain, and they exhibit the power to transport buildings and other heavy objects considerable distances. On theoretical grounds it is proposed that one of the elements in the flowage of turbidity currents on the ocean floor may be comparable to quick-clay flowage on land. Both types of flowage cover considerable areas, may move on a comparatively flat base, exhibit fairly rapid motion, involve masses of colloidal-size clay and detritus, exhibit powerful transporting power, involve porous material of high water content, and are initiated by some form of trigger action. While experimental data are inadequate for proof, the parallelism in these two forms of erosional movement warrants the suggestion that the mobile mechanisms responsible for mass transport may be similar in the two cases."
