https://openalex.org/W1904882776,"Apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) is a novel apoptotic effector protein that induces chromatin condensation and large-scale ( approximately 50 kbp) DNA fragmentation when added to purified nuclei in vitro. Confocal and electron microscopy reveal that, in normal cells, AIF is strictly confined to mitochondria and thus colocalizes with heat shock protein 60 (hsp60). On induction of apoptosis by staurosporin, c-Myc, etoposide, or ceramide, AIF (but not hsp60) translocates to the nucleus. This suggests that only the outer mitochondrial membrane (which retains AIF in the intermembrane space) but not the inner membrane (which retains hsp60 in the matrix) becomes protein permeable. The mitochondrio-nuclear redistribution of AIF is prevented by a Bcl-2 protein specifically targeted to mitochondrial membranes. The pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD. fmk does not prevent the staurosporin-induced translocation of AIF, although it does inhibit oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation and arrests chromatin condensation at an early stage. ATP depletion is sufficient to cause AIF translocation to the nucleus, and this phenomenon is accelerated by the apoptosis inducer staurosporin. However, in conditions in which both glycolytic and respiratory ATP generation is inhibited, cells fail to manifest any sign of chromatin condensation and advanced DNA fragmentation, thus manifesting a 'necrotic' phenotype. Both in the presence of Z-VAD. fmk and in conditions of ATP depletion, AIF translocation correlates with the appearance of large-scale DNA fragmentation. Altogether, these data are compatible with the hypothesis that AIF is a caspase-independent mitochondrial death effector responsible for partial chromatinolysis."

The pivotal element of these senses is a mechanically gated ion channel that transduces sound, pressure, or movement into changes in excitability of specialized sensory cells. Despite the prevalence of mechanosensory systems, little is known about the molecular nature of the transduction channels. To identify such a channel, we analyzed Drosophila melanogaster mechanoreceptive mutants for defects in mechanosensory physiology. Loss-of-function mutations in the no mechanoreceptor potential C (nompC) gene virtually abolished mechanosensory signaling. nompC encodes a new ion channel that is essential for mechanosensory transduction. As expected for a transduction channel, D. melanogaster NOMPC and a Caenorhabditis elegans homolog were selectively expressed in mechanosensory organs."

Alfalfa root hair cells were impaled with intracellular microelectrodes to measure a membrane potential depolarizing activity in Rhizobium meliloti cell-free filtrates, a plant response dependent on the bacterial nodulation genes. The depolarization was desensitized by repeated exposure to factors and was not observed in a representative nonlegume. A purified extracellular Nod factor, NodRm-IV(S), caused membrane potential depolarization at nanomolar concentrations. This rapid single-cell assay provides a tool for dissecting the mechanisms of host cell response in early nodulation."

After 4 days, EHTs were subjected to a phasic unidirectional stretch for 6 days in serum-containing medium. Compared to unstretched controls, RNA/DNA and protein/cell ratios increased by 100% and 50%, respectively. ANF mRNA and alpha-sarcomeric actin increased by 98% and 40%, respectively. Morphologically, stretched EHTs exhibited improved organization of cardiac myocytes into parallel arrays of rod-shaped cells, increased cell length and width, longer myofilaments, and increased mitochondrial density. Thus, stretch induced phenotypic changes, generally referred to as hypertrophy. Concomitantly, force of contraction was two- to fourfold higher both under basal conditions and after stimulation with calcium or the beta-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline. Contraction kinetics were accelerated with a 14-44% decrease in twitch duration under all those conditions. In summary, we have developed a new in vitro model that allows morphological, molecular, and functional consequences of stretch to be studied under defined conditions. The main finding was that stretch of EHTs induced cardiac myocyte hypertrophy, which was accompanied by marked improvement of contractile function."
https://openalex.org/W2119021947,"Peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)), a toxic product of the free radicals nitric oxide and superoxide, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of CNS inflammatory diseases, including multiple sclerosis and its animal correlate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In this study we have assessed the mode of action of uric acid (UA), a purine metabolite and ONOO(-) scavenger, in the treatment of EAE. We show that if administered to mice before the onset of clinical EAE, UA interferes with the invasion of inflammatory cells into the CNS and prevents development of the disease. In mice with active EAE, exogenously administered UA penetrates the already compromised blood-CNS barrier, blocks ONOO(-)-mediated tyrosine nitration and apoptotic cell death in areas of inflammation in spinal cord tissues and promotes recovery of the animals. Moreover, UA treatment suppresses the enhanced blood-CNS barrier permeability characteristic of EAE. We postulate that UA acts at two levels in EAE: 1) by protecting the integrity of the blood-CNS barrier from ONOO(-)-induced permeability changes such that cell invasion and the resulting pathology is minimized; and 2) through a compromised blood-CNS barrier, by scavenging the ONOO(-) directly responsible for CNS tissue damage and death."
https://openalex.org/W2006830036,"Myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) plays a pivotal role in smooth muscle contraction by regulating Ca2+ sensitivity of myosin light chain phosphorylation. A smooth muscle phosphoprotein called CPI-17 specifically and potently inhibits MLCP in vitro andin situ and is activated when phosphorylated at Thr-38, which increases its inhibitory potency 1000-fold. We produced a phosphospecific antibody for this site in CPI-17 and used it to studyin situ phosphorylation of endogenous CPI-17 in arterial smooth muscle in response to agonist stimulation. In the intact femoral artery, CPI-17 phosphorylation was negligible at the resting state and was not increased during contraction induced by K+depolarization. The Ca2+-sensitizing agonists histamine and phenylephrine induced nearly equivalent contractions, but histamine generated significantly higher levels of CPI-17 phosphorylation. In α-toxin-permeabilized strips at pCa 6.7, contractile force and CPI-17 phosphorylation were proportional in response to histamine, guanosine 5′-O-(γ-thiotriphosphate), and histamine plus guanyl-5′-yl thiophosphate, implying that histamine increased CPI-17 phosphorylation through activation of G proteins. Inhibitors of Rho-kinase (Y27632) and protein kinase C (PKC; GF109203X) reduced contraction and CPI-17 phosphorylation in parallel, suggesting that CPI-17 functions downstream of Rho kinases and PKC. The results show that agonists such as histamine signal through phosphorylation of CPI-17 to produce Ca2+ sensitization of smooth muscle contraction.

Toxicol. 1985; 25: 593-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although a rise in intracellular Ca2+ triggers the phosphorylation of MLC during smooth muscle contraction, the Ca2+ sensitivity of MLC phosphorylation and contraction is also dynamically modulated (3.Bradley A.B. Morgan K.G. J. Physiol. 1987; 385: 437-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar,4.Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Nature. 1994; 372: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). Excitatory agonists initially increase intracellular Ca2+ levels leading to an activation of MLCK. This action is followed immediately by a decrease in MLCP activity, which increases the Ca2+ sensitivity (4.Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V.

The agonist-induced Ca2+sensitization is mimicked by G protein activation (using GTPγS) and blocked by G protein inhibition (using GDPβS) (8.Kitazawa T. Kobayashi S. Horiuti K. Somlyo A.V.

Commun. 1988; 157: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Multiple second messengers/signaling pathways have been proposed for the Ca2+-sensitizing mechanism. These include the Rho A/Rho-kinase (10.Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J.H. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K.

Physiol. 1999; 520: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and arachidonic acid pathways (13.Gong M.C. Fuglsang A. Alessi D. Kobayashi S. Cohen P. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21492-21498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism for regulating MLCP is not yet fully elucidated. The holoenzyme of MLCP is composed of three subunits (see Ref.14.Hartshorne D.J. Ito M. Erdodi F. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 325-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar): a 38-kDa catalytic subunit (PP1c), a large 110–130-kDa regulatory subunit (M130), and a small 20-kDa subunit. The M130 is the key subunit involved in binding to and activation of PP1c and in targeting myosin. RhoA, a Ras-related monomeric small GTPase, is thought to play a major role in the agonist-induced Ca2+ sensitization of smooth muscle contraction (14.Hartshorne D.J. Ito M. Erdodi F. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 325-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Active but not inactive RhoA produces a Ca2+-sensitizing effect (15.Hirata K. Kikuchi A. Sasaki T. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K.

Inactivation of the endogenous Rho proteins by ADP-ribosylation or glucosylation inhibits the agonist- and/or GTPγS-induced Ca2+ sensitization (7.Lucius C. Arner A. Steusloff A. Troschka M. Hofmann F. Aktories K. Pfitzer G. J. Physiol. 1998; 506: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar,14.Hartshorne D.J. Ito M. Erdodi F. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 325-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Several proteins have been identified as RhoA targets, including Rho-kinase (17.Leung T. Manser E. Tan L. Lim L. J. Biol.

Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 325-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Rho-kinase phosphorylates the M130 subunit, and this leads to an inhibition of the catalytic activity of the MLCP holoenzyme (10.Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J.H. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2434) Google Scholar). Y27632 is a new compound that selectively inhibits Rho-kinase and reduces agonist-induced Ca2+ sensitization of contraction in smooth muscle (11.Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2542) Google Scholar). However, despite the several reports of Rho-kinase activity toward M130 in cultured cells (20.Kawano Y. Fukata Y. Oshiro N. Amano M. Nakamura T. Ito M. Matsumura F. Inagaki M. Kaibuchi K. J.

CPI-17 is a novel phosphoprotein selectively expressed in smooth muscle tissues that specifically inhibits the trimeric MLCP (22.Eto M. Ohmori T. Suzuki M. Furuya K. Morita F. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 1104-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 23.Eto M. Senba S. Morita F. Yazawa M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 24.Senba S. Eto M. Yazawa M J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). PKC phosphorylates CPI-17, enhancing its inhibitory potency 1000-fold, providing an independent pathway for inhibiting MLCP in vitro and in situ without phosphorylation of the M130 subunit (22.Eto M. Ohmori T. Suzuki M. Furuya K. Morita F. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 1104-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 23.Eto M. Senba S. Morita F. Yazawa M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 24.Senba S. Eto M. Yazawa M J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 25.Li L. Eto M. Lee M.R. Morita F. Yazawa M. Kitazawa T. J. Physiol. 1998; 508: 871-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The action of phospho-CPI-17 increases the Ca2+ sensitivity of both MLC phosphorylation and contraction (12.Kitazawa T. Takizawa N. Ikebe M. Eto M. J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 25.Li L. Eto M. Lee M.R. Morita F. Yazawa M. Kitazawa T. J. Physiol. 1998; 508: 871-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Therefore, CPI-17 could participate in Ca2+ sensitization of contraction if it was phosphorylated in response to agonist stimulation. The phosphorylation of CPI-17 at the single site Thr-38 is sufficient to induce inhibition of MLCP and a concurrent increase in the Ca2+ sensitivity of MLC phosphorylation and contraction in smooth muscle (12.Kitazawa T. Takizawa N. Ikebe M. Eto M. J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation at Thr-38 is a useful indicator of CPI-17 activityin vivo. We generated an antibody that specifically recognizes CPI-17 phosphorylated at Thr-38 (p[T38]CPI-17) and used it to analyze the phosphorylation of CPI-17 in intact and α-toxin permeabilized smooth muscle. We measured both phosphorylation of CPI-17 and tension induced by different Ca2+-sensitizing agonists and found significant differences in CPI-17 phosphorylation between agonists that utilize G protein-coupled pathways to enhance contraction. Smooth muscle strips (70 μm thick, 750 μm wide, and 3 mm long) were dissected from rabbit femoral arteries and mounted on a force transducer set up as described previously (26.Masuo M. Reardon S. Ikebe M. Kitazawa T. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 265-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Force levels were monitored throughout the experiments. The compositions of external solutions were described previously (8.Kitazawa T. Kobayashi S. Horiuti K. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5339-5342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For cell permeabilization, strips were treated for 30 min at 30 °C with 20 μg/ml purified Staphylococcus aureus α-toxin (List, Campbell, CA) at pCa 6.7 buffered with 10 mmEGTA and further treated with 10 μmCa2+-ionophore A23187 for 20 min at 25 °C to deplete the sarcoplasmic reticulum of Ca2+ and maintain constant cytoplasmic Ca2+ as described previously (26.Masuo M. Reardon S. Ikebe M. Kitazawa T. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 265-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Details of the solutions used for the permeabilized strips have been described previously (26.Masuo M. Reardon S. Ikebe M. Kitazawa T. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 265-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Recombinant hexahistidine-tagged CPI-17 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity as described previously (23.Eto M. Senba S. Morita F. Yazawa M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the CPI-17 was carried out using porcine brain PKC as detailed previously (25.Li L. Eto M. Lee M.R. Morita F. Yazawa M. Kitazawa T. J. Physiol. 1998; 508: 871-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Different polyclonal antibodies against CPI-17 were prepared. First, polyclonal IgY antibody (anti-CPI) was raised in chicken eggs against the full-length recombinant porcine CPI-17 and purified using column chromatography on CPI-17 conjugated to Affi-Gel-10. Second, polyclonal rabbit IgG antibody (anti-p[T38]CPI-17) was generated against the phosphopeptide ARV(pT)VKYDRREL (Quality Controlled Biochemicals Inc.), which corresponds to the sequence of amino acids 35–46 of porcine CPI-17. Antibodies were absorbed from the antiserum onto unphosphorylated peptide conjugated to resin, prior to affinity purification of phosphospecific antibodies, using phospho-peptide resin. The specific antibody was further purified using phosphorylated CPI-17 by the modified method of Talian et al. (27.Talian J.C. Olmsted J.B. Goldman R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1277-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Nontreated intact or permeabilized femoral artery strips were rapidly frozen and treated as previously described (26.Masuo M. Reardon S. Ikebe M. Kitazawa T. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 265-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Strips were dried and homogenized in the electrophoresis sample buffer. Western blotting experiments were always carried out in duplicate. Equal amounts of the same tissue extracts were loaded onto two 15% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels, and separated proteins were transferred to the same nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline solution containing 0.05% Tween 20, 5% nonfat milk, and 1% bovine serum albumin and then incubated with a primary antibody followed by an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. The immunoblots were developed with an alkaline phosphatase substrate solution (Sigma) to visualize immunoreactive proteins. The bands of alkaline phosphatase products were digitized with a color scanner and analyzed with image processing software (Signal Analytics Co., Vienna, VA). We compared the ratio ofp[T38]CPI-17 from one set of Western blots to the total amount of CPI-17 from the paired set of Western blots. The specificity of phosphorylation-dependent antibodies forp[T38]CPI-17 is demonstrated in Fig.1. Western blotting with affinity-purified chicken anti-CPI-17 antibodies (Fig. 1 A) showed a linear response to the amount of recombinant CPI-17 protein (Fig. 1 C). There was no difference in reactivity between the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of CPI-17. This antibody was used to determine the total CPI-17 recovered from tissues. In contrast, affinity-purified rabbit anti-phosphopeptide antibodies directed against the phosphorylation site at Thr-38 (anti-p[T38]CPI-17) did not react with unphosphorylated recombinant CPI-17 (Fig. 1, B, lower panel, andD) but did give a linear response with phospho-CPI-17 (Fig.1, B, upper panel, and D), with about the same relative sensitivity as the chicken anti-CPI-17 antibodies. CPI-17 is phosphorylated by PKC at two sites, Thr-38 and Ser-12 (22.Eto M. Ohmori T. Suzuki M. Furuya K. Morita F. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 1104-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). However, the anti-p[T38]CPI-17 antibody did not recognize a CPI-17 mutant where Thr at position 38 was replaced with Ala, even after PKC phosphorylation of Ser-12 (not shown). The rabbit antibody was both phosphospecific and site-specific for p[T38]CPI-17 and was used in Western blotting to gauge the level of phosphorylation of Thr-38 in CPI-17 recovered from tissues. We used this phosphospecific antibody to determine thein situ phosphorylation of Thr-38 in CPI-17 during stimulation of intact smooth muscle. Rabbit femoral artery strips were treated with 30 mm and 145 mm K+and with 30 mm K+ plus phenylephrine or histamine. Histamine and the α1-agonist phenylephrine were tested in the presence of 30 mm K+ to avoid oscillatory and/or transient contractions induced by the agonists alone and to maintain consistent levels of contraction. Fig.2 compares relative force development and relative CPI-17 phosphorylation under the conditions tested. Histamine plus 30 mm K+ produced the largest contraction and the highest level of Thr-38 phosphorylation, and therefore the results were normalized to this response. The histamine-induced contraction and CPI-17 phosphorylation were reversed to the resting levels 15 min after the agonist was removed, showing that CPI-17 was rapidly dephosphorylated in intact tissue (data not shown). In Ca2+-free conditions contractile activity was completely depressed, and the phosphorylation of CPI-17 was negligible (4 ± 2%). Depolarization with high K+ produced sub-maximal but sustained contraction, without significant phosphorylation of Thr-38 in CPI-17 (Fig. 2). In comparison, both histamine and phenylephrine produced approximately double the level of contraction elicited by depolarization with 154 mm K+, and both significantly elevated the levels of CPI-17 phosphorylation. There was no significant difference in the contractile force evoked by histamineversus phenylephrine. However, the phosphorylation of CPI-17 in response to histamine (set as 100%) was higher than that in response to phenylephrine (52 ± 17%). These results suggest the possibility that these agonists engage different signaling mechanisms to enhance contraction of smooth muscle. To investigate the signaling mechanisms for CPI-17 phosphorylation, we used α-toxin-permeabilized smooth muscle to control the composition and concentration of low molecular weight soluble components. In contrast to other permeabilization methods (e.g. β-escin and Triton X-100) the endogenous CPI-17 is retained in the α-toxin preparation (12.Kitazawa T. Takizawa N. Ikebe M. Eto M. J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In muscle permeabilized with α-toxin, the Ca2+ concentration was buffered with 10 mmEGTA, and intracellular Ca2+ stores were removed with A23187. As expected, CPI-17 phosphorylation at pCa > 8 in permeabilized muscle was similar to that in quiescent intact muscle. Increasing the Ca2+ concentration to pCa 6.7 produced a detectable contraction that was less than 5% of maximum force, and under these conditions there was a correspondingly low level of CPI-17 phosphorylation (Fig. 3,A and B). Increasing the concentration of Ca2+ to pCa 6 significantly increased contraction to over half-maximum but only increased CPI-17 phosphorylation a minimal amount (Fig. 3). We concluded that physiological [Ca2+] alone was not sufficient to produce phosphorylation of CPI-17. Histamine increased contraction of permeabilized smooth muscle more than 10-fold at pCa 6.7, and in parallel, histamine increased CPI-17 Thr-38 phosphorylation nearly 10-fold (Fig.3). The nonhydrolyzable GTP analog GTPγS, which activates G proteins, produced larger contractions and higher levels of CPI-17 phosphorylation than those elicited by histamine (Fig. 3). On the other hand, the compound GDPβS acts as a G protein inhibitor, and when added to permeabilized smooth muscle it reduced histamine stimulation of contraction and CPI-17 phosphorylation by 80% (Fig.4). Activation by GTPγS and inhibition by GDPβS together strongly implicate G proteins in the histamine-induced increase in CPI-17 phosphorylation. A PKC inhibitor GF109203X inhibited histamine-induced contraction by 50% and reduced CPI-17 phosphorylation by 70% (Fig. 4). A Rho-kinase inhibitor, Y27632, partially blocked histamine-induced contraction and CPI-17 phosphorylation, whereas contraction induced by phenylephrine was more effectively inhibited (from 53 ± 9% to 18 ± 9% of maximum at pCa 4.5; not shown), consistent with the engagement of different signaling pathways for these agonists. Activation of various PKC isoforms with phorbol ester (PDBu) atpCa 6.7 gave high levels of CPI-17 phosphorylation (125 ± 21% versus GTPγS). This phosphorylation was only slightly reduced at pCa > 8, supporting the hypothesis that Ca2+-independent PKC isoforms phosphorylate CPI-17. To maximize CPI-17 phosphorylation we added calyculin A, a potent protein phosphatase-1 and -2A inhibitor, to block dephosphorylation of CPI-17. Calyculin A increased, but not significantly, the PDBu-induced phosphorylation of CPI-17 at pCa 6.7. CPI-17 phosphorylation with GTPγS plus PDBu at high Ca2+ (pCa 4.5) was only slightly higher (by 26 ± 20%) than with PDBu atpCa 6.7. Therefore, G proteins and PKC apparently function in the same or parallel pathways leading to CPI-17 phosphorylation. This is the first demonstration of reversible phosphorylation of CPI-17 in intact arterial smooth muscle. The experiments revealed that CPI-17 phosphorylation was activated by stimulation of G protein-coupled Ca2+-sensitizing agonists but not by an increase in intracellular Ca2+. Overall, the results support a model for a physiological pathway for CPI-17 activation involving receptors, G proteins, and Ca2+-independent PKC isoforms and/or Rho-activated kinases. CPI-17 may provide a point of convergence for PKC and RhoA signaling pathways. Expression of CPI-17 differs among smooth muscle tissues (23.Eto M. Senba S. Morita F. Yazawa M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 28.Li S. Eto M. Kitazawa T. Biophys. J. 1998; 74 (abstr.): A152Google Scholar), and CPI-17 phosphorylation responds to different agonists. Therefore the involvement of CPI-17 in agonist-induced Ca2+ sensitization may depend upon tissue type and agonist, and we predict that the CPI-17 signaling pathway to inhibit MLCP will prove to be dominant in a few selective circumstances.

https://openalex.org/W2156458099,"The regression phase of the hair cycle (catagen) is an apoptosis-driven process accompanied by terminal differentiation, proteolysis, and matrix remodeling. As an inhibitor of keratinocyte proliferation and inductor of keratinocyte apoptosis, transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) has been proposed to play an important role in catagen regulation. This is suggested, for example, by maximal expression of TGF-beta1 and its receptors during late anagen and the onset of catagen of the hair cycle. We examined the potential involvement of TGF-beta1 in catagen control. We compared the first spontaneous entry of hair follicles into catagen between TGF-beta1 null mice and age-matched wild-type littermates, and assessed the effects of TGF-beta1 injection on murine anagen hair follicles in vivo. At day 18 p.p., hair follicles in TGF-beta1 -/- mice were still in early catagen, whereas hair follicles of +/+ littermates had already entered the subsequent resting phase (telogen). TGF-beta1-/- mice displayed more Ki-67-positive cells and fewer apoptotic cells than comparable catagen follicles from +/+ mice. In contrast, injection of TGF-beta1 into the back skin of mice induced premature catagen development. In addition, the number of proliferating follicle keratinocytes was reduced and the number of TUNEL + cells was increased in the TGF-beta1-treated mice compared to controls. Double visualization of TGF-beta type II receptor (TGFRII) and TUNEL reactivity revealed colocalization of apoptotic nuclei and TGFRII in catagen follicles. These data strongly support that TGF-beta1 ranks among the elusive endogenous regulators of catagen induction in vivo, possibly via the inhibition of keratinocyte proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Thus, TGF-betaRII agonists and antagonists may provide useful therapeutic tools for human hair growth disorders based on premature or retarded catagen development (effluvium, alopecia, hirsutism)."

In this study, we report the expression of the NS2B-NS3pro precursor inEscherichia coli as a fusion protein with a histidine tag at the N terminus. The precursor was purified from insoluble inclusion bodies by Ni2+ affinity and gel filtration chromatography under denaturing conditions. The denatured precursor was refolded to yield a purified active protease complex. Biochemical analysis of the protease revealed that its activity toward either a natural substrate, NS4B-NS5 precursor, or the fluorogenic peptide substrates containing two basic residues at P1 and P2, was dependent on the presence of the NS2B domain. The peptide with a highly conserved Gly residue at P3 position was 3-fold more active as a substrate than a Gln residue at this position. The cleavage of a chromogenic substrate with a single Arg residue at P1 was NS2B-independent. These results suggest that heterodimerization of the NS3pro domain with NS2B generates additional specific interactions with the P2 and P3 residues of the substrates.

In this study, we expressed the precursor containing the hydrophilic domain of NS2B linked to the NS3 protease domain (NS2B-NS3pro). The precursor protein was purified under denaturing conditions. During refolding of the precursor protein, an active protease complex was produced by intramolecular cleavage of the 2B-3 site of the precursor (Den2 protease complex). We report the biochemical and kinetic analysis of the Den2 protease complex. The purified Den2 protease complex mediated trans cleavage of a natural substrate, NS4B-NS5 precursor, and several synthetic fluorogenic peptide substratesin vitro. Comparison of the activities of the purified NS3 protease domain alone and the Den2 protease complex revealed that the activity toward a chromogenic substrate containing an l-Arg residue at P1 and a benzoyl moeity in the place of a P2 residue was NS2B-independent. However, the trans cleavage of a natural substrate, or the fluorogenic peptide substrates containing dibasic residues at P1 and P2, was catalyzed optimally only by the Den2 protease complex. This in vitro protease assay with purified proteins will be of use to screen for inhibitors that could block viral polyprotein processing and hence viral replication. The rabbit reticulocyte-coupled transcription-translation system and canine pancreatic microsomal membranes were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI).

The polymerase chain reaction products were digested with BamHI and HindIII and cloned into pQE-30 vector (Qiagen). The plasmid 6xHis-NS2B-NS3pro encoded the precursor protein containing the N-terminal hexahistidine tag fused sequentially to the NS2B hydrophilic domain, 10 amino acid residues upstream of the 2B-3 cleavage site, and the first 185 amino acids of NS3. The plasmid encoding the NS3 protease domain alone (NS3pro) has been previously described (45.Murthy H.M. Clum S. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol.

Competent Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue MRF cultures were transformed with the NS2B-NS3pro or NS2B-NS3*pro expression plasmid and grown in 1 liter of LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C until OD 600 nm reached approximately 0.6. Bacterial cells were induced for protein expression by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranose (0.5 mm) for 2 h, collected by centrifugation, and stored at −70 °C until used. For protein purification, cells were resuspended in buffer A (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl) and lysed by French press. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 27,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet fraction was solubilized by resuspension in 20 ml of buffer B (100 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 6 M urea) followed by sonication (9 × 10-s bursts) on ice at power setting 3 using a cell distruptor (model 185, Branson Sonifier, Danbury, CT), and the lysate was kept on ice for 1 h. The denatured lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant solution was purified by passage through a Ni2+-NTA affinity column. A 2-ml suspension of Ni2+-NTA resin was pre-equilibrated with buffer B, and the supernatant solution was batch-bound to the resin by incubation for 2 h. The resin was centrifuged at 1000 × g, and the unbound fraction was removed. The resin with the bound protein was loaded onto a column (Bio-Rad; 1 × 3 cm). The column was washed extensively with 90 ml of buffer B. Proteins were eluted from the column in buffer C (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 6 M urea) containing 500 mm imidazole. The elution profile was monitored by using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. The peak fractions were then pooled and subjected to Sephadex G-75 gel filtration chromatography using a column of 1 × 48 cm (38-ml bed volume), which was equilibrated with buffer B. The elution profile was monitored by using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit, and aliquots from the peak fractions were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The protein concentration of the pooled fractions was diluted to less than 0.5 mg/ml in buffer B. Refolding of the denatured protein was carried out by dialysis against three changes of buffer D (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mmNaCl) for a total of 48 h at 4 °C. The sample was then centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C and concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation (70% saturation). The ammonium sulfate precipitate was centrifuged at 27,000 ×g for 1 h, and the pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of buffer D and dialyzed overnight against buffer D. The dialysate was clarified by centrifuging briefly, and the protein concentration was determined. The purity of the enzyme preparation was analyzed using SDS-PAGE (46.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), then by Western blot analysis (47.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) using rabbit anti-α-NS3 polyclonal antibody (24.Zhang L. Mohan P.M.

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The 6xHis-NS2B-NS3*pro precursor was expressed and purified in a similar manner except that the gel filtration column chromatography step was omitted. The 6xHis-NS3pro domain alone was expressed and purified as described previously (45.Murthy H.M. Clum S. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5573-5580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The labeled NS4B-NS5 precursor was synthesizedin vitro as described previously (25.Clum S. Ebner K.E. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30715-30723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Microsomal membrane-associated precursor was isolated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of the buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 mg/ml cyclohexamide, 0.5% Triton X-100 and sonicated (4 × 10-s bursts on ice) using a cup-horn sonicator (model 185 F, Heat Systems-Ultrasonics, Inc., Farmingdale, NY) at a power setting of 7. For trans-cleavage assays, the purified Den2 protease complex (40 μm) was incubated with the labeled NS4B-NS5 precursor at 30 °C for 3 h. Reactions were terminated by addition of gel-loading buffer containing SDS. The products were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Assays were carried out using a Perkin-Elmer 204S spectrofluorometer. The standard reaction mixtures (100 μl) contained 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and 200 μm fluorogenic peptide substrate (except for kinetic analysis, indicated amounts were used). After enzyme addition, reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and terminated by addition of 1.9 ml of 125 mm ZnSO4 (49.Brenner C. Fuller R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 922-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The precipitate was removed by centrifugation for 1 min in a microcentrifuge (15,000 × g), and the rate of product (7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin) released into the supernatant solution was determined fluorometrically [λ (excitation) = 385 nm, λ (emission) = 465 nm]. The substrates used were: Boc-Gly-Arg-Arg-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (MCA), Boc-Gln-Arg-Arg-MCA, Z-Arg-Arg-MCA, and pGlu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-MCA. Stock solutions (100 mm) were prepared by dissolving peptides in dimethyl sulfoxide that were then diluted in water to 1 mm working stock before use. Reaction premixes (0.7 ml) were assembled on ice with buffers (200 mm) of different pH and the Den2 protease complex (0.2 μm). A sample of 80 μl was withdrawn from each premix for a control and mixed with 1.9 ml of 125 mmZnSO4 containing 0.2 mm Boc-Gly-Arg-Arg-MCA peptide. The remaining premixes were then incubated at 37 °C. At intervals ranging from 10 to 300 min, 80 μl of each premix was added to a tube containing 0.2 mm Boc-Gly-Arg-Arg-MCA substrate and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to assay the remaining enzyme activity. Reactions were terminated with 1.9 ml of 125 mmZnSO4 (50.Brenner C. Bevan A. Fuller R.S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 152-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Serine protease activity was assayed using the substrate,N-α-benzoyl-l-arginine-p-nitroanilide in a spectrophotometer (Spectronic 3000 Array, Milton Roy Co., SLM-AMINCO, Huntley, IL or in a LKB Biochrom Ultraspec II). The rate of product released was measured at 405 nm. The concentrations of stock enzyme preparations were between 1.2 mg/ml (60 μm) to 1.6 mg/ml (80 μm). The purified proteins were assayed in a reaction containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) and 300 mm NaCl at 23 °C (except when the ionic strengths were varied). To determine the optimum pH for the enzyme activity associated with the NS3pro domain, the pH was varied between 7.0 to 9.5. The substrate concentrations were varied from 0.2 mm to 3.4 mm. The final enzyme concentration in the assay was varied from 90 nm to 8 μm. Triplicate measurements of enzyme activity were recorded for each data point. Previous studies showed that fusion of six histidine residues at the N terminus of NS3 allowed the expression of the protease domain in high levels that could conveniently be purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography. The expressed protein was associated with insoluble inclusion bodies, which required denaturation and refolding to obtain soluble protein. The crystal structure of this soluble protein was determined at 2.1-Å resolution (45.Murthy H.M. Clum S. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5573-5580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To express the Den2 protease complex, we followed a similar strategy. The expression plasmid coding for the NS2B-NS3pro precursor was constructed such that a histidine tag was fused at the N terminus of the NS2B hydrophilic domain. The NS2B-NS3pro precursor was produced at high levels in E. coli. Contrary to our expectation, the precursor did not undergo cleavage in vivo at the 2B-3 site but was associated with insoluble inclusion bodies. Therefore, we sought to purify the precursor protein from the insoluble pellet fraction of the bacterial cell lysates. The pellet fraction was solubilized using a buffer containing urea, and the precursor was purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography followed by Sephadex G-75 gel filtration as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This two-step purification strategy was employed because some smaller proteins, possibly generated from either proteolytic degradation or internal initiation of the mRNA translation, also copurified with the desired precursor protein in the Ni2+affinity column. The peak fractions eluting from the gel filtration column were pooled and refolded by successive dialysis to remove the denaturant as described under “Experimental Procedures.” However, during this renaturation step, the precursor was cleaved into the individual components, NS2B hydrophilic domain (∼8 kDa) and the NS3 protease domain (23 kDa) (Fig.1 A, lane 6). Previous studies using a coupled transcription-translation systemin vitro showed that cotranslational insertion of the NS2B-NS3 protease precursor into microsomal membranes was mediated by the hydrophobic regions of the NS2B and that this association with the membranes was required for cleavage of the 2B-3 site. However, the NS2B-NS3 protease precursor containing only the hydrophilic domain of 40 amino acid residues underwent cleavage readily in the absence of membranes (25.Clum S. Ebner K.E. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30715-30723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, the E. coli-expressed NS2B-NS3 protease precursor also was cleaved during refolding of the precursor (Fig. 1 A). As a negative control, the expression plasmid to produce the mutant precursor protein, NS2B-NS3*pro (*refers to a His→Ala mutation in the catalytic triad of the protease domain) was also constructed. Purification of the mutant precursor was achieved in a similar manner except that the gel filtration chromatography was omitted (Fig. 1 B). The His-tag-NS3pro domain was purified as described previously (45.Murthy H.M. Clum S. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5573-5580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1 C). The identity of the wild type or the mutant precursor protein and the 23-kDa NS3pro domain liberated during refolding was established by Western blot analysis using rabbit polyclonal anti-NS3 antibody (Fig. 1, right panels). The smaller, NS2B polypeptide (8 kDa) was not immunoreactive to the anti-NS2B peptide antibody, although this antibody recognized the precursor protein (data not shown). The mutant precursor, NS2B-NS3*pro precursor, did not undergo cis cleavage as expected due to the catalytic His→Ala mutation, which is shown by both Coomassie Blue-stained gel and by Western blot analysis using the anti-NS3 antibody (Fig. 1 B). Because the NS2B-NS3pro precursor was proteolytically active in cis cleavage of the 2B-3 site during refolding, we sought to determine whether the resultant Den2 protease complex was active in trans cleavage of a natural substrate such as NS4B-NS5 precursor. [35S]Methionine-labeled substrate was synthesized by using the coupled in vitro transcription-translation system (25.Clum S. Ebner K.E. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30715-30723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The labeled substrate was incubated with the purified Den2 protease complex. The results shown in Fig.2 indicated that the cleavage of the labeled substrate occurred with the Den2 protease complex (lane 3) but not with the NS3pro domain alone (lane 2) or with the uncleaved mutant NS2B-NS3*pro precursor containing the His51→Ala mutation within the catalytic triad (lane 4). The band that had a mobility similar to that of NS4B inlane 4 was shown to be a nonspecific band by carrying out the SDS-PAGE analysis under different conditions (Fig. 2, lanes 5–7). These experiments were repeated five times with similar results. These results clearly indicated that the purified Den2 protease complex is active in trans cleavage and that thetrans cleavage of the NS4B-NS5 substrate was dependent on the presence of the 40-amino acid hydrophilic domain of NS2B. To develop a sensitive, rapid, and quantitative assay to determine the biochemical and kinetic parameters of the protease, a number of commercially available fluorogenic peptides were used as substrates. All of these peptides have two basic amino acid residues at P1 and P2. Some peptides contain residues at P3 and longer up to the P5 position. However, none of the peptides contains an amino acid residue at the P1′ position, but rather the P1′ residue is replaced by a fluorogenic moiety. TableI lists the substrates analyzed in this study. The results reveal that substrate 1, Gly-Arg-Arg-MCA, which contains a Gly residue at the P3 position, is the most active of the four substrates tested. Thus we used this substrate for determining the biochemical and kinetic parameters of the protease.Table IKinetic properties of NS2B/NS3(pro) and NS3(pro) proteasesSubstrateNS2B/NS3(pro)NS3(pro)V maxActivityk catK mk cat/K mk catK mk cat/K m%s −1μms −1 m −1s −1μms −1 m −1Boc-Gly-Arg-Arg-MCA0.141000.0311801724.3 × 10−682.30.052Boc-Gln-Arg-Arg-MCA0.046330.01931071.8 × 10−61280.014Z-Arg-Arg-MCA0.042300.009102881.3 × 10−6500.026pGlu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-MCA0.061440.013134972.7 × 10−6850.03The protease activity was assayed in 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5 for 50 min at 37 °C.

https://openalex.org/W1736650634,"Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation induces apoptosis of granule cells in the hippocampus. In contrast, neuroprotection is seen after mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activation. To date there is no in vivo evidence for direct interactions between corticosteroids and any of the key regulatory molecules of programmed cell death. In this report, we show that the opposing actions of MR and GR on neuronal survival result from their ability to differentially influence the expression of members of the bcl-2 gene family; specifically, in the rat hippocampus, activation of GR induces cell death by increasing the ratio of the proapoptotic molecule Bax relative to the antiapoptotic molecules Bcl-2 or Bcl-x(L); the opposite effect is observed after stimulation of MR. The same results were obtained in both young and aged animals; however, older subjects (which were more susceptible to GR-mediated apoptosis) tended to express the antiapoptotic genes more robustly. Using a loss-of-function mouse model, we corroborated the observations made in the rat, demonstrating Bax to be essential in the GR-mediated cell death-signaling cascade. In addition, we show that GR activation increases and MR activation decreases levels of the tumor suppressor protein p53 (a direct transcriptional regulator of bax and bcl-2 genes), thus providing new information on the early genetic events linking corticosteroid receptors with apoptosis in the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2045479594,"A new class of peptide gene delivery agents were developed by inserting multiple cysteine residues into short (dp 20) synthetic peptides. Substitution of one to four cysteine residues for lysine residues in Cys-Trp-Lys18 resulted in low molecular weight DNA condensing peptides that spontaneously oxidize after binding to plasmid DNA to form interpeptide disulfide bonds. The stability of cross-linked peptide DNA condensates increased in proportion to the number of cysteines incorporated into the peptide. Disulfide bond formation led to a decrease in particle size relative to control peptide DNA condensates and prevented dissociation of peptide DNA condensates in concentrated sodium chloride. Cross-linked peptide DNA condensates were 5–60-fold more potent at mediating gene expression in HepG2 and COS 7 cells relative to uncross-linked peptide DNA condensates. The enhanced gene expression was dependent on the number of cysteine residues incorporated, with a peptide containing two cysteines mediating maximal gene expression. Cross-linking peptides caused elevated gene expression without increasing DNA uptake by cells, suggesting a mechanism involving intracellular release of DNA triggered by disulfide bond reduction.

As opposed to the success of these agents in vitro, attempted in vivo use has revealed many complications related to their toxicity (8.Wolfert M.A. Seymor L.W.

Bartholomew R.M. Brostoff S.W. Carlo D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 171-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). These complications relate to the size and charge of DNA carrier complexes and ultimately to the molecular characteristics of the carrier itself. High molecular weight (HMW)1 DNA carriers can be cytotoxic (8.Wolfert M.A. Seymor L.W. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 269-273PubMed Google Scholar), are able to activate the complement system (10.Plank C.K. Mechtler K. Szoka F.C. Wagner E. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1437-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), and can elicit an immune response (9.Stankovics J. Crane A.M. Andrews E. Wu C.H. Wu G.Y. Ledley F.D. Hum. Gene Ther. 1994; 5: 1095-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The size and heterogeneity of these polymers also significantly complicates region-specific derivatization with ligands or polyethylene glycol (14.Wolfert M.A. Schacht E.H. Toncheva V. Ulbrick K. Nazarove O. Seymour L.W. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 2123-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). To circumvent these problems, several low molecular weight (LMW) carrier peptides have been developed that mediate in vitrogene transfer as efficiently as their HMW counterparts (15.Gottschalk S. Sparrow J.T. Hauer J. Mims M.P. Leland F.E. Woo S. Smith L.C. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 448-457PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Wadhwa M.S. Collard W.T. Adami R.C. McKenzie D.L. Rice K.G. Bioconj.

They offer the advantage of controlled synthesis and defined purity that then allows strategic optimization to increase expression levels and eliminate side effects. However, when analyzed for in vivo efficacy, LMW peptide DNA condensates lacked sufficient stability to survive circulation, were not able to significantly protect DNA from metabolism, and could not effect targeting (13.Kwoh D.Y. Coffin C.C. Lollo C.P. Jovenal J. Banaszczyk M.G. Mullen P. Phillips A. Amini A. Fabrycki J. Bartholomew R.M. Brostoff S.W. Carlo D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 171-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 18.Collard, W. T., Yang, Y., Kwok, K. Y., and Rice, K. G. (2000) J. Pharmaceutical Sci., in pressGoogle Scholar). One solution to increase LMW peptide DNA condensate stability is to form intraparticle cross-links to inhibit the dissociation of condensing peptides. Glutaraldehyde was evaluated as one type of cross-linking agent that forms Schiff bases between neighboring peptides and increases the metabolic stability of LMW peptide DNA condensates (19.Adami R.C. Rice K.G. J. Pharmaceutical Sci. 1999; 88: 739-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Glutaraldehyde cross-linked DNA condensates were significantly more metabolically stable both in vitro and in vivo (18.Collard, W. T., Yang, Y., Kwok, K. Y., and Rice, K. G. (2000) J. Pharmaceutical Sci., in pressGoogle Scholar, 19.Adami R.C. Rice K.G. J. Pharmaceutical Sci. 1999; 88: 739-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and were able to facilitate specific receptor targeting in vivo (18.Collard, W. T., Yang, Y., Kwok, K. Y., and Rice, K. G. (2000) J. Pharmaceutical Sci., in pressGoogle Scholar). However, the slow reversal of the Schiff bases resulted in limited in vitroand in vivo gene expression. Other reversible cross-linking agents have also been applied to form caged DNA condensates (20.Trubetskoy V.S. Loomis A. Slattum P.M. Slattum P.M. Hagstrom J.E. Budker V.G. Wolff J.A. Bioconj. Chem. 1999; 10: 624-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) by template polymerization (21.Trubetskoy V.S. Budker V.G. Hanson L.J. Slattum P.M. Wolff J.A. Hagstrom J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4178-4185Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), but thus far they have not been shown to be transfection competent. In an effort to design stabilized LMW peptide DNA condensates that are reversibly cross-linked and that simultaneously enhance gene expression, we incorporated multiple cysteine residues into LMW condensing peptides to determine whether they would oxidize to form interpeptide disulfide bonds while bound to DNA. Once internalized, the reducing environment of the cell (22.Mellman I. Fuchs R. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 663-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) might allow disulfide cross-linked DNA condensates to undergo reduction and release DNA more readily than glutaraldehyde cross-linked DNA condensates. The following describes the synthesis of a panel of novel LMW cross-linking peptides that not only undergo disulfide cross-linking to form small stabilized DNA condensates but also enhance in vitro gene expression. These findings suggest that cross-linking peptides may be promising candidates for further development into LMW DNA carriers that function in vivo.

Peptide synthesis was performed on a computer interfaced model 90 Advanced ChemTech solid phase peptide synthesizer. Peptide purification was performed using a semi-preparative (10 μm) C18RP-HPLC column from Vydac (Hesperia, CA). Preparative HPLC was performed using a computer-interfaced HPLC and fraction collector from ISCO (Lincoln, NE). Electrospray mass spectrometry (ES-MS) was performed using a Finnigan LCQ mass spectrometer (San Jose, CA) interfaced with an analytical HPLC from Hitachi (San Jose, CA). Cys-Trp-Lys18 (CWK18), alkylated (Alk)CWK18, and dimeric (Di)CWK18were synthesized as described previously (16.Wadhwa M.S. Collard W.T. Adami R.C. McKenzie D.L. Rice K.G. Bioconj. Chem. 1997; 8: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). All other peptides were synthesized using standard Fmoc procedures with 9-hydroxybenzotriazole and diisopropylcarbodiimide double couplings followed by N-capping with acetic anhydride after each coupling to avoid deletion sequences. Peptides were cleaved from the resin and side chain protecting groups were removed by reaction with TFA/ethane dithiol/water (95:2.5:2.5 v/v/v) for 1 h. Peptides were purified to homogeneity on RP-HPLC by injecting 2 μmol onto a Vydac C18 semi-preparative column (2 × 25 cm) eluted at 10 ml/min with 0.1% TFA and a gradient of acetonitrile (5–25% over 30 min) while monitoring tryptophan absorbance at 280 nm. The major peak eluting at 23 min was collected and pooled from multiple runs, concentrated by rotary evaporation, lyophilized, and stored dry at −20 °C. Purified peptides were reconstituted in 0.1% TFA (degassed with nitrogen) and quantified by tryptophan absorbance (ε280 = 5600 m−1cm−1) to determine the isolated yield, which was typically 20%. Purified peptides were characterized by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry by injecting 5 nmol onto a Vydac C18analytical column (0.47 × 25 cm) eluted at 1 ml/min with 0.1% v/v acetic acid containing 0.02% v/v TFA and an acetonitrile gradient of 1 to 30% over 30 min. The RP-HPLC eluent was directly infused into the electrospray ionization source of a Finnigan LCQ mass spectrometer, and mass spectral data were obtained in the positive mode (24.Arnott K.

Chem. 1990; 62: 882-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). Peptide DNA condensates were prepared by combining 50 μg of DNA in 500 μl of Hepes-buffered mannitol (HBM) (0.27 m mannitol, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) with 5–75 nmol of peptide in 500 μl of HBM while vortexing to create DNA condensates possessing a calculated charge ratio (NH4+:PO4−) ranging from 0.1 to 2.4. Peptide DNA condensates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature to allow cross-linking. The relative binding affinity of each peptide for DNA was monitored by a fluorophore exclusion assay (16.Wadhwa M.S. Collard W.T. Adami R.C. McKenzie D.L. Rice K.G. Bioconj. Chem. 1997; 8: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Peptide DNA condensates (50 μl) were added to 950 μl of HBM containing 0.1 μm thiazole orange. The fluorescence of the intercalated dye was measured using an LS50B fluorometer (Perkin Elmer) by exciting at 500 nm while monitoring emission at 530 nm with the slit width set at 15 and 20 nm, respectively. Fluorescence blanks were subtracted from all values before data analysis. The particle size of each peptide DNA condensate was determined by quasi-elastic light scattering at a scatter angle of both 15 and 90° on a Brookhaven ZetaPlus particle sizer. Condensates were prepared at a DNA concentration of 50 μg/ml in 400 μl of HBM at a stoichiometry of 0.4 nmol of peptide/μg of DNA corresponding to a charge ratio of approximately 2:1 for each. The mean diameter and population distribution were computed from the diffusion coefficient using a unimodal cummulant analysis supplied by the manufacturer. The particle size and zeta potential of peptide IV DNA condensates were determined by titrating 7.5–37.5 nmol of peptide with 75 μg of DNA in 1.5 ml of HBM to produce 50 μg/ml DNA condensates with charge ratio of 0.5–2.5. The zeta potential was averaged from 10 determinations. The kinetics of disulfide bond formation in solution was monitored by ES-MS. Fully reduced peptide V (80 nmol) (see Table I) was dissolved in 800 μl of 50%:50% v/v methanol:ammonium acetate (1 mm, pH 7.5) and directly infused via a syringe pump into the electrospray ionization source of a Finnigan LCQ mass spectrometer at 3 μl/min. Single ion monitoring scans were taken at 20-s intervals over 2 h while monitoring the disappearance of the M + 2H+ parent ion (1258 atomic mass units) and formation of the M + 2H+ion of the oxidized species (1256 atomic mass units).Table IMass spectral analysis of DNA condensing peptidesNameSequenceMass (observed/calculated)aMasses are calculated as the average mass of the free base.AlkCWK18Alk-S-Cys-Trp-Lys182672.5 /2672.5DiCWK18Lys18-Trp-Cys-S-S-Cys-Trp-Lys185227.8 /5227.9CWK18Cys-Trp-Lys182614.1 /2614.6IICys-Trp-Lys17-Cys2588.9 /2589.6IIICys-Trp-Lys8-Cys-Lys8-Cys2564.3 /2564.6IVCys-Trp-Lys5-Cys-Lys5-Cys-Lys5-Cys2539.2 /2539.6VCys-Trp-Lys4-Cys-Lys3-Cys-Lys3-Cys-Lys4-Cys2514.0 /2514.6Polylysine1007Lys1007NDbThe mass of polylysine1007 was not determined (ND) because of polydispersity./150,000a Masses are calculated as the average mass of the free base.b The mass of polylysine1007 was not determined (ND) because of polydispersity. Open table in a new tab The kinetics of cross-linking within peptide DNA condensates was studied indirectly by monitoring the displacement of SYBR-Gold intercalator dye from DNA condensates as a function of time. Peptide DNA condensates were prepared (200 μl of 50 μg/ml) at a peptide stoichiometry of 0.4 nmol/μg of DNA. Immediately after mixing peptide and DNA, a 10-μl aliquot was combined with 990 μl of SYBR-Gold (1×), and the fluorescence intensity (excitation, 495 nm; emission, 537 nm) was continuously monitored for 30 min. The rate of cross-linking was also examined as a function of peptide concentration. The stoichiometry of peptide IV was increased from 0.4 to 1.2 nmol/μg of DNA, and the rate of declining fluorescence intensity was determined as described above. A synthetic oligonucleotide (TCATGCATCC) (Life Technologies, Inc.) was reconstituted in 10 mm ammonium acetate (pH 7.4) and combined with either AlkCWK18 or peptide Vresulting in an oligonucleotide concentration of 17 μmand a stoichiometry of 0.4 nmol peptide/μg oligonucleotide. Peptides were allowed to react with the oligonucleotide for 2 h at 37 °C, lyophilized, and then reconstituted in 500 μl of 70%:20%:5%:5% v/v acetonitrile:water:triethylamine:acetone to a final DNA concentration of 10 μm. The reaction products were directly infused at 25 μl/min into the electrospray source of a Finnigan LCQ mass spectrometer. The mass of the oligonucleotide and peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates was monitored by acquiring spectra in the negative mode. Peptide DNA condensates (200 μl of 50 μg/ml) were formed and incubated at room temperature for 30 min and then combined with 0–200 μl of 5 m sodium chloride and normalized to 400 μl with HBM to achieve a final sodium chloride concentration of 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 m. Each sample was sonicated for 30 s with a 100 W Microson XL-2000 ultrasonic probe homogenizer (Kontes, Vineland, NJ) with a vibrational amplitude of 6 to fragment uncondensed DNA (26.Adami R.C. Collard W.T. Gupta S. Kwok K.Y. Bonadio J. Rice K.G. J. Pharmaceutical Sci. 1998; 87: 678-683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). DNA condensates were digested with 30 μg of trypsin for 12 h at 37 °C and then electrophoresed on an agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. HepG2 cells (1.5 × 105) were plated on 6 × 35-mm wells and grown to 40–70% confluency in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin, and streptomycin (10,000 units/ml), sodium pyruvate (100 mm), and l-glutamine (200 mm). Transfections were performed in MEM (2 ml/35-mm well) with 2% FBS and 80 μmchloroquine. Peptide DNA condensates (10 μg of DNA in 0.2 ml of HBM) were added dropwise to triplicate wells. After a 5-h incubation at 37 °C, the medium was replaced with MEM supplemented with 10% FBS. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (calcium- and magnesium-free) and then treated with 0.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm Tris chloride, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 8 mm magnesium chloride, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 10 min. The cell lysate was scraped, transferred to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, and centrifuged for 7 min at 13,000 × g at 4 °C to pellet debris. Lysis buffer (300 μl), sodium-ATP (4 μl of a 180 mmsolution, pH 7, 4 °C), and cell lysate (100 μl, 4 °C) were combined in a test tube, briefly mixed, and immediately placed in the luminometer. Luciferase relative light units were recorded on a Lumat LB 9501 (Berthold Systems, Munich, Germany) with 10 s of integration after automatic injection of 100 μl of 0.5 mmd-luciferin (prepared fresh in lysis buffer without dithiothreitol). The relative light units were converted into fmol using a standard curve generated by adding a known amount of luciferase (0.01–100 fmol with specific activity of 2.5 nanounits/fmol) to 35-mm wells containing 40–70% confluent HepG2 cells. The cells were processed as described above resulting in a standard curve with an average slope of 7.8 × 106 relative light units/fmol of enzyme. Protein concentrations were measured by Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard (27.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). The amount of luciferase recovered in each sample was normalized to milligrams of protein and reported as the mean and standard deviation obtained from triplicate transfections. LipofectAceTM (Life Technologies, Inc.; 1:2.5 w/w dimethyl dioctadecylammonium bromide and dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine) was used to mediate gene transfection according to the manufacturer's instructions. The ratio of DNA to LipofectAce was optimized for HepG2 cells. An optimal DNA/LipofectAce ratio was achieved by dissolving 10 μg of DNA in 100 μl of serum-free medium followed by adding 60 μl of LipofectAce prepared in 140 μl of serum-free medium. The LipofectAce DNA complex was then diluted with 1.7 ml of serum-free medium and used to transfect HepG2 cells for 5 h followed by replacing the transfecting medium with medium supplemented with 10% FBS. The cells were incubated for a total of 24 h, harvested, and analyzed for luciferase as described above. COS 7 cells (72,000) were plated in 35-mm wells and grown to 50% confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin (10,000 units/ml),l-glutamine (200 mm), and 10% FBS for 24 h. The cells were transfected as described for HepG2 cells. The number of cells transfected in vitro was examined using a plasmid encoding nuclear targeted β-galactosidase followed by X-gal staining. HepG2 and COS 7 cells were transfected for 5 h as described above with either AlkCWK18 DNA, peptideII DNA condensates, or plasmid DNA and then grown in fresh medium for an additional 43 h. After removing medium, cells were fixed for 5 min in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.3) containing 1.25% v/v glutaraldehyde and then stained by incubation with 0.05 wt/v % X-gal, 1 mm magnesium chloride, 10 mm potassium ferricyanide, and 10 mm potassium ferrocyanide in phosphate-buffered saline. After 4 h at 37 °C, the X-gal solution was removed, and the nuclear-stained blue cells were counted with a light microscope under 10× power magnification by averaging the number of transfectants from nine fields. Values were analyzed for significance by one-way analysis of variance. Iodinated plasmid DNA (pCMVL) was prepared with specific activity of 300 nCi/μg of DNA as described previously (28.Terebesi J. Kwok K.Y. Rice K.G. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 263: 120-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Prior to forming DNA condensates, the specific activity of the 125I DNA was adjusted to 4.5 nCi/μg of DNA by combining with unlabeled plasmid. DNA condensates were prepared using AlkCWK18 or peptide II as described above. Peptide 125I-DNA condensates (10 μg) were used to transfect HepG2 and COS 7 cells for 5 h according to the procedure described above. The radioactive medium was removed, and cells were washed once with 2 ml of 1 m sodium chloride and three times with 2 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested with 1 ml of lysis buffer. The cell-associated radioactivity from triplicate transfections was quantified by γ counting. Substituting cysteine residues into CWK18 produced a panel of cross-linking peptides (II, III,IV, and V) possessing 2–5 cysteine residues, respectively (Table I). Following binding and condensation of plasmid DNA, cross-linking peptides could potentially form interpeptide disulfide bonds that would stabilize the DNA carrier complex (Fig. 1). Hence, the number of cysteine residues would influence the number of disulfide bonds formed and the overall stability and transfection efficiency of the peptide DNA carrier complex. Despite the presence of multiple cysteine residues, each cross-linking peptide released from resin produced essentially a single peak on RP-HPLC, indicating that the cysteines remained in a reduced form during acidic cleavage and work-up. Purified cross-linking peptides each produced molecular ions on ES-MS that matched the anticipated mass of the fully reduced peptide (Table I). The peptides were maintained in their reduced form at low pH by removing oxygen; however, at neutral pH, the cysteine residues became very reactive in forming disulfide bonds. When cross-linking peptide V was adjusted to pH 7.5 and directly infused into ES-MS, the parent ion completely disappeared within 25 min with a t 12 of approximately 10 min resulting in the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bonded peptide as the primary oxidation product (Fig.2). When bound to DNA, cross-linking peptides are less flexible such that intermolecular peptide cross-linking may be the preferred route of oxidation. To determine whether this occurs, the time course of interpeptide disulfide bond formation for peptides bound to DNA was studied using a continuous fluorescence assay. A SYBR-Gold DNA intercalator dye was used because it maintains its fluorescence even with peptide bound to DNA (Fig.3 A). When prepared at a charge ratio of 2:1, both AlkCWK18 and polylysine1007instantly form DNA condensates and produce a constant SYBR-Gold fluorescence intensity over time with magnitude inversely related to the peptide binding affinity for DNA (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, the fluorescence intensity decreased over time when peptidesII–V were used to form DNA condensates at a charge ratio of 2:1 (Fig. 3 A), because of displacement of the intercalator dye as cross-linking proceeds and peptide binding affinity increases. The kinetic decrease in SYBR-Gold fluorescence was interpreted as the approximate time course of disulfide formation for peptides bound to DNA. Interpeptide cross-linking of Voccurred in less than 30 min, similar to that predicted by ES-MS. Increasing the number of cysteine residues in the seriesII–V increased both the time required to achieve complete cross-linking (t 12 = 1–10 min) and the stability of the cross-linked DNA condensates (Fig. 3 A). Likewise, the rate of kinetic decrease in SYBR-Gold fluorescence and the final fluorescence intensity were not significantly influenced by the cross-linking peptide concentration (Fig. 3 B), indicating that the disulfide bonds did not appreciably quench the SYBR-Gold fluorescence. To establish the peptide to DNA stoichiometry needed to achieve maximal condensation, the ability of peptides II–V to displace thiazole orange from DNA were compared. Titration of 5–75 nmols of peptides II–V with 50 μg of DNA, followed by a 2-h incubation to allow cross-linking, resulted in a decrease in the thiazole orange fluorescence (Fig.4). At 0.4 nmol of peptide/μg of DNA or greater, corresponding to a calculated charge ratio of 2:1, each peptide was able to fully condense DNA as determined by a plateau in the residual fluorescence intensity (Fig. 4). The particle size of each cross-linked peptide DNA condensate was evaluated by quasi-elastic light scattering at both 15 and 90° scatter angles to minimize the influence of internal motion that is detected at 90° (29.Lewis R.J. Huang J.H. Pecora R. Macromolecules. 1985; 18: 944-948Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). At a charge ratio of 2:1, CWK18 and peptides II-V each formed essentially a single population of DNA condensates determined by quasi-elastic light scattering at both 15 and 90° to approximate a mean diameter of 40–60 nm (Table II). A slightly larger population of particles with a mean diameter of 70–100 nm resulted when AlkCWK18, DiCWK18, and polylysine1007 were used to condense DNA (Table II).Table IIQELS particle size analysis of peptide DNA condensatesParticle Size Mean Diameter (nm)Peptide DNA condensateaPeptide DNA condensates were prepared at a concentration of 50 μg/ml and at a stoichiometry of 0.4 nmol of peptide/μg of DNA corresponding to charge ratio of 2:1.OxidizedbParticle size measure in HBM after 2 h of incubation.ReducedcParticle size following addition of TCEP (1 mm).SalinedParticle size in HBM with added saline (0.15 m) after 15 min.15°eQuasi-electric ligh"

Detailed inspection of the identified sequence (residues 79,671–109,912 GenBankTM accession no.

Accordingly, we identified the complete genomic organization of this putative phospholipase A2through analyses of previously published expressed sequence tags, PCR of human heart cDNA, and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Polymerase chain reaction and Northern blotting demonstrated a 3.4-kilobase message, which encoded a polypeptide with a maximum calculated molecular weight of 88476.9. This 3.4-kilobase message was present in multiple human parenchymal tissues including heart, skeletal muscle, placenta, brain, liver, and pancreas. Cloning and expression of the protein encoded by this message in Sf9 cells resulted in the production of two proteins of apparent molecular masses of 77 and 63 kDa as assessed by Western analyses utilizing immunoaffinity-purified antibody.

In most cell types, the availability of nonesterified arachidonic acid is the rate-limiting step in the production of biologically active eicosanoid metabolites (1.Samuelsson B. Goldyne M.

Accordingly, substantial attention has focused on the molecular identification of the polypeptides that catalyze phospholipase A2 activity, regulate its kinetic properties, and facilitate its topologic and topographic distribution in normal and stimulated cells. Decades of painstaking research eventually illuminated several distinguishing kinetic and physical characteristics of the families of phospholipases A2 that facilitated their categorization into several broad classes of enzymes based upon their requirement for calcium ion in in vitro activity assays (i.e.millimolar, nanomolar, or no calcium dependence) (e.g. see Refs. 5.Demel R.A.

For example, secretory phospholipases A2 (secretory PLA2)1 were distinguished by their low molecular mass (14–18 kDa), heat stability, and obligatory dependence upon high (millimolar) concentrations of calcium ion for catalytic activity (5.Demel R.A.

Moreover, the cPLA2family is readily distinguished from the iPLA2 family by the presence of a GXSGS consensus lipase motif, while the iPLA2 family utilizes a GXSTG consensus motif. In addition, the iPLA2 (but not the cPLA2) gene family possesses a consensus sequence for nucleotide binding (26.Andrews D.L. Beames B. Summers M.D. Park W.D. Biochem.

These insights have greatly accelerated our progress in the understanding of the molecular identities of the polypeptides responsible for phospholipase A2 catalysis and their mechanisms of regulation in normal and disease states. More recently, global efforts aimed at identifying the complete human genome sequence have yielded a vast array of sequence information that has further delineated the role of individual phospholipases in biologic processes. For example, two recently described phospholipases A2(i.e. cPLA2β and cPLA2γ) were identified from initial insights gleaned from protein and nucleotide data bases (28.Underwood K.W. Song C. Kriz R.W.

During the sequencing of the long arm of chromosome 7 in the Human Genome Sequencing Project, a predicted protein product of 40 kDa was identified, which contained two ∼10-amino acid segments homologous to the ATP and lipase consensus sequences present in the founding members of calcium-independent phospholipases A2 (i.e.iPLA2α (26.Andrews D.L. Beames B. Summers M.D. Park W.D. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and iPLA2β (27.Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar)). However, close inspection of the Human Genome Sequencing Project sequence demonstrated that it represented only the partial sequence of a larger undefined polypeptide product. Herein, we report the entire genomic organization, complete mRNA sequence, cloning, expression, and initial activity analyses of the protein encoded by this gene, which we term iPLA2γ. [α-32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol) and ECL detection reagents were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. A human heart cDNA library was purchased from Stratagene, Inc. Human heart Marathon cDNA, QuickClone human skeletal cDNA, and human MTN multiple tissue Northern blots were purchased fromCLONTECH. For PCR, a Perkin-Elmer Thermocycler was employed, and all PCR reagents were purchased from PE Biosystems. The pGEM-T vector and the TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System were obtained from Promega. Vector pcDNA1.1 was purchased from Invitrogen. Culture media, Cellfectin and LipofectAMINE reagents for transfection of baculovirus vectors, and competent DH110BacEscherichia coli cells were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. and used according to the manufacturer's protocol. QIAfilter plasmid kits and QIAquick gel extraction kits were obtained from Qiagen, Inc. Keyhole limpet hemocyanin was obtained from Pierce.l-α-Dipalmitoyl-2-[1-14C]palmitoyl phosphatidylcholine,l-α-1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]oleoyl phosphatidylcholine,l-α-1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]linoleoyl phosphatidylcholine, andl-α-1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonyl phosphatidylcholine were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. 1-O-(Z)-Hexadec-1′-enyl-2-[9,10-3H]oleoylsn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine was synthesized and purified as described previously (30.Han X. Zupan L.A. Hazen S.L. Gross R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). BEL was obtained from Calbiochem. Most other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Searches of EMBL and NCBI data bases were performed using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) (NCBI). Alignments of all sequences were performed with the MultAlign computer program (31.Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4229) Google Scholar). For typical PCR analysis, a 30-cycle program was employed with steps at 53 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 2 min, and 94 °C for 30 s per cycle. iPLA2γ was amplified utilizing oligonucleotides that flanked the predicted 5′- and 3′-coding region, M444 (5′-TTTTGTCGACATGTCTATTAATCTGACTGTAGATA-3′) and M449 (5′-GCATACTCGAGTCACAATTTTGAAAAGAATGGAAGTCC-3′), respectively. PCR screening was performed utilizing human skeletal muscle cDNA (0.5 ng), human heart Marathon cDNA (0.5 ng), and a human heart cDNA library (∼1 × 109 plaque-forming units) as templates. To directly compare differences between our sequences and those previously reported, PCR amplification of the iPLA2γ sequence present in the original BAC genomic clone RG054 DO4 (Research Genetics) was used as template, and PCR was performed with primers M452 (5′-GTACATACGGTGGACAAGCCTA-3′) and M446 (5′-CATTCCTCTCCCTTTCACTGGATCCACATAGCC-3′). All PCR products were resolved by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Candidate bands were extracted from the agarose gel using a QIAquick Gel extraction kit followed by blunt end ligation into the pGEM-T Vector (Promega) by standard procedures (32.Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Following bacterial transformation and growth of transformants, plasmids were purified using a QIAfilter plasmid kit (CLONTECH) and subjected to automated sequence analysis using either an ABI 373S or 377XL automated DNA sequencer (PE Biosystems). Full-length iPLA2γ amplified by PCR was prepared for use as a probe by radiolabeling with [32P]dCTP for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of Ready-To-Go labeling beads (Amersham Pharmacia) according to instructions provided by the manufacturer. The radiolabeled probe was purified by gel filtration employing a 1-ml Sepharose G-25 spin column. For Northern analysis, an MTN blot (CLONTECH) containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA/lane from human brain, heart, pancreas, liver, lung, and placenta tissue was prehybridized at 68 °C for 30 min in hybridization buffer, hybridized for 1 h at 68 °C with radiolabeled iPLA2γ (2 × 106 cpm/ml), and washed in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS twice for 30 min, followed by two washes with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS for 40 min each at 50 °C as per the manufacturer's instructions. Hybridized sequences were identified by autoradiography for 16 h. For 5′-RACE, a 45-cycle program with steps at 58 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 2 min, and 94 °C for 30 s per cycle was employed. Human heart Marathon-Ready cDNA was used as template (0.5 ng), and primer AP1 (CLONTECH) was paired with M460 (5′-GAAAACCTCTTTGTAGACTGATGTGGCTTATCCTCCAG-3′) to amplify products. Products were analyzed by electrophoresis utilizing a 1% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. PCR products were excised from the gel, purified with a QIAquick gel extraction kit, and subcloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega) for sequencing and alignment with the iPLA2γ sequence. A full-length iPLA2γ construct in pcDNA1.1 (1 μg) was used in a coupled transcription/translation rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) with RNA synthesis from the T7 promoter of pcDNA1.1 using T7 RNA polymerase and translation in the presence of 20 μCi of [35S]methionine for 90 min according to the manufacturer's instructions. Labeled protein products were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by autoradiographic visualization. Anti-iPLA2γ polyclonal antibodies were made by immunizing rabbits with the synthetic peptide CENIPLDESRNEKLDQ. The peptide was conjugated to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin by incubation for 2 h at 22 °C followed by dialysis according to the manufacturer's instructions. After two booster injections of the peptide conjugate spaced 2 weeks apart, serum was collected, and antibodies against the peptide were affinity-purified using a thiopropyl-Sepharose column to which the peptide had been covalently coupled according to the instructions of the manufacturer. PCR amplification with the primer pair m444 (5′-TTTTGTCGACATGCTATTAATCTGACTGTAGATA-3′) and m458 (5′-GCATAGCATGCTCACAATTTTGAAAAGAATGGAAGTCC-3′) was used to engineer appropriate restriction sites onto iPLA2γ for subsequent subcloning into SalI/SphI restriction sites of a pFASTBAC vector (Life Technologies, Inc.). The iPLA2γ and flanking sequences in pFASTBAC were sequenced in their entirety on both strands to verify the integrity of the sequence. Sf9 cells were grown and infected as described previously in detail (33.Wolf M.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30879-30885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In brief, Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells were cultured in 100-ml flasks equipped with a magnetic spinner containing supplemented Grace's medium (34.O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar). Sf9 cells at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml were prepared in 50 ml of growth medium and incubated at 27 °C for 1 h prior to infection with either wild-type virus or recombinant virus containing human iPLA2γ cDNA. After 48 h, cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and repelleted. All subsequent operations were performed at 4 °C. The supernatant was decanted, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of homogenization buffer (25 mmimidazole, pH 8.0, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.34 m sucrose, 20 μmtransepoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino) butane, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin). Cells were lysed at 0 °C by sonication (20 1-s bursts utilizing a Vibra-cell sonicator at a 30% output) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was saved (cytosol), and the membrane pellet was washed with homogenization buffer and resuspended using a Teflon homogenizer in 6 ml of homogenization buffer. After brief sonication (10 1-s bursts), the mixture was subjected to recentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. After removal of the supernatant, the membrane pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of homogenization buffer using a Teflon homogenizer and subsequently sonicated at 0 °C for 5 × 1-s bursts. Sf9 cell cytosol and membrane proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (35.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes by electroelution in 10 mm CAPS, pH 11, containing 10% methanol. Dry powdered milk (5% (w/v) in 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, containing 137 mm NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20) was used to block nonspecific binding sites before incubation with the primary antibody (prepared as described above). Secondary antibody (anti-rabbit F(ab′)2IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate) was incubated with the blot for 1 h, and immunoreactive bands were visualized utilizing an ECL detection system. Calcium-independent phospholipase A2 activity was measured by quantitating the release of radiolabeled fatty acid from various radiolabeled phospholipid substrates in the presence of membrane fractions from Sf9 cells infected with wild-type or recombinant human iPLA2γ containing baculovirus. Reactions (200 μl) were incubated for up to 5 min at 37 °C in reaction buffer (100 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm EGTA) prior to their termination by the addition of 100 μl of 1-butanol and vortexing. Phospholipids and fatty acids extracted into the butanol phase were separated by thin layer chromatography using Whatman Silica 60A prescored plates employing a mobile phase of 70:30:1 petroleum ether/ethyl ether/glacial acetic acid (v/v/v). Radiolabeled fatty acids were identified by staining of an overlaid fatty acid standard by exposure to iodine vapor. Regions corresponding to fatty acids were scraped into scintillation vials and subsequently quantitated by scintillation spectrometry after the addition of fluor. For experiments employing BEL, reactions were preincubated in reaction buffer for 3 min in the presence of selected concentrations of BEL or vehicle (EtOH) prior to the addition of radiolabeled substrate. Inspection of the sequence encoding the putative 40-kDa phospholipase reported by the Human Genome Sequencing Project (BAC clone RG054D04; GenBankTM accession no.AC005058) demonstrated that it did not begin with an initiator methionine codon. Accordingly, we performed a TBLASTN data base search (36.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar) of GenBankTM to find expressed sequence tags (ESTs) that could align with the 5′-end of the putative iPLA2γ sequence. EST clones vz36b01.ri Soares 2NbMT Mus musculus cDNA IMAGE:1328521 and Rattus norvegicus cDNA UI-R-C0-hp-c-06–0-UI (accession nos.AA915561 and AA998901, respectively) were found to overlap with the iPLA2γ sequence, thereby extending the known 5′ sequence an additional 360 nt upstream (Fig. 1). Four other EST clones (Stratagene Homo sapienscolon cDNA clone IMAGE:588479, accession no. AA143503; StratageneH. sapiens cDNA clone IMAGE:647744, accession no.AA205258; normalized rat ovary, Bento Soares Rattus sp. cDNA clone ROVAA46, accession no. AA801084; and NCI_CGAP_GCB1H. sapiens cDNA clone IMAGE:825005, accession numberAA504219) were also present in the data base and are in close spatial proximity with the putative PLA2. However, when aligned with the BAC clone sequence, the 3′-end of the EST AA504219 sequence and the 5′-end of EST AA998901 are separated by a 150-nt gap (Fig. 1). Moreover, when the EST AA998901 sequence is back-translated through this gap and into EST AA504219, a continuous reading frame results. Thus, by overlapping known EST sequences with the 5′-end of iPLA2γ and back-translation through the 150-nt gap, the sequence could be extended approximately 1.2 kb upstream from the predicted GenBankTM protein. The furthest upstream ATG codon that remained in frame with the coding sequence was located 1210 nt upstream from the originally reported sequence. Translation of the reported gene sequence further 5′ from nt 122761 in BAC clone RG054D04 results in stop codons in all three reading frames. We performed PCR analysis using primers corresponding to the most 5′ candidate initiator methionine and the known 3′ stop codon (nt 79,673) in the gene sequence. PCR of human heart cDNA human and skeletal muscle libraries utilizing primers M444 and M949 gave rise to a single band, which was 2.4 kb in length (Fig. 2).Figure 2PCR amplification of human iPLA2 γ. PCR was performed using human heart cDNA (0.5 ng) (lane 1), a cDNA library prepared from human heart (lane 2), human skeletal muscle cDNA (lane 3), and a blank control (lane 4) as templates as described under “Experimental Procedures.” PCR primers M444 and were utilized with M449 positioned at the 5′- and 3′-ends of iPLA2γ coding sequence (respectively) in 30 cycles of amplification (53 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 2 min, and 94 °C for 30 s). PCR products were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Molecular size markers are shown on the left in kb. The arrow indicates the size of the major PCR band (2.4 kb).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The PCR product was subcloned into pGEM-T and sequenced in both directions (Fig.3). Based on amino acid residue 1 being the initiator methionine, the message encoded a 782-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular weight of 88,476.9. Contained within this sequence were an ATP binding motif (amino acid residues 449–454) and a lipase consensus sequence (amino acid residues 481–485) as well as multiple potential cAMP phosphorylation sites, PKC phosphorylation sites, CK2 phosphorylation sites, and a microbody C-terminal targeting sequence as determined by a Prosite pattern search (37.Hofmann K.

https://openalex.org/W1884051840,"Using two specific and sensitive fluorometric/HPLC methods and a GC-MS method, alone and in combination with D-aspartate oxidase, we have demonstrated for the first time that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), in addition to D-aspartate (D-Asp), is endogenously present as a natural molecule in rat nervous system and endocrine glands. Both of these amino acids are mostly concentrated at nmol/g levels in the adenohypophysis, hypothalamus, brain, and testis. The adenohypophysis maximally showed the ability to accumulate D-Asp when the latter is exogenously administered. In vivo experiments, consisting of the i.p. injection of D-Asp, showed that D-Asp induced both growth hormone and luteinizing hormone (LH) release. However, in vitro experiments showed that D-Asp was able to induce LH release from adenohypophysis only when this gland was co-incubated with the hypothalamus. This is because D-Asp also induces the release of GnRH from the hypothalamus, which in turn is directly responsible for the D-Asp-induced LH secretion from the pituitary gland. Compared to D-Asp, NMDA elicits its hormone release action at concentrations approximately 100-fold lower than D-Asp. D-AP5, a specific NMDA receptor antagonist, inhibited D-Asp and NMDA hormonal activity, demonstrating that these actions are mediated by NMDA receptors. NMDA is biosynthesized from D-Asp by an S-adenosylmethionine-dependent enzyme, which we tentatively denominated as NMDA synthase."
https://openalex.org/W2030106646,"We show here that exposure of cardiac cells to simulated ischemia results in apoptosis and is accompanied by phosphorylation and increased expression and transcriptional activity of STAT-1. Similarly, interferon-γ, which is known to induce STAT-1 activation, also induced apoptosis in cardiac cells. STAT-1-transfected cells were more susceptible to ischemia-induced cell death than cells transfected with a control plasmid lacking the STAT-1 coding sequence. Furthermore, an antisense STAT-1 vector reduced both ischemia- and overexpressed STAT-1-induced cell death in cardiac cells. Both STAT-1 overexpression and interferon-γ treatment or exposure to ischemia activated the promoter of the pro-apoptotic caspase-1 gene in cardiomyocytes. Finally, ischemia/reperfusion also induced STAT-1 activation and caspase-1 processing in ventricular myocytes in the intact heart ex vivo. Immunofluorescent staining demonstrated an increase in STAT-1-positive staining in cardiomyocytes in response to ischemia/reperfusion that co-localized with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dVTP nick end-labeling-positive apoptotic cells. These results suggest that STAT-1 plays a critical role in the regulation of ischemia/reperfusion-induced apoptosis in cardiac cells, acting at least in part via a caspase-1 activation-dependent pathway.

Recent studies have indicated that apoptotic death occurs in cardiac cells exposed to a variety of damaging stimuli both in vitro and in the intact heart in vivo (3.Cheng W. Kajstura J. Nitahara J.A.

Cell Death Differ. 1995; 2: 235-241PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, cardiac cells exposed to a hypoxic/ischemic insult followed by reperfusion undergo apoptotic cell death in vitro (3.Cheng W. Kajstura J. Nitahara J.A. Li B. Reiss K. Liu Y. Clark W.A. Krajfwski S. Reed J.C. Olivetti G. Anversa P. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 226: 316-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 6.Umansky S.R. Cuenco G.M. Khutzian S.S. Barr P.J. Tomei L.D. Cell Death Differ. 1995; 2: 235-241PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, apoptotic cell death is also observed in the intact heart following ischemiain vivo (4.Gottlieb R.A. Burleson K.O. Kloner R.A. Babior B.M. Engler R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1621-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar, 5.Narula J. Haider N. Virmani R. DiSalvo T.G. Kolodgie F.D Hajjar R.J. Schmidt U. Semigran M.J. Dec W.G. Khaw B.A. N. Engl. J.

Despite the convincing evidence that apoptosis occurs, the mechanism and signaling pathway that leads to hypoxic/ischemic stimuli resulting in apoptosis in cardiac cells is as yet unknown. However, as in other cell types, caspases have been implicated in apoptotic cell death in cardiomyocytes (7.Black S.C. Huang I. Rezaiefar P. Radinovic S. Eberhart A. Nicholson T.F. Rodger I.W. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1998; 30: 733-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). For example, the infarct size following ischemia/reperfusion of the intact heartin vivo can be reduced by priming animals with the nonspecific caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethyl ketone, directly demonstrating the role of caspases in mediating cell death in cardiac cells (8.Yaotia H. Ogawa A. Maehara K. Maruyama Y. Circulation. 1998; 97: 276-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Cytokines and growth factors are known to modulate growth, differentiation, and death in many cell types. For example, interferons (IFNs)1 have been shown to trigger cell cycle arrest and death in non-cardiac cells (9.Horvath C.M. Darnell J.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 10.Schindler C. Darnell J.E. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar), whereas many interleukins stimulate growth and protect cells from apoptosis (11.Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Taga T. Kishimoto T. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3387-3396Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). These pro- and anti-apoptotic effects are mediated, at least in part, by signaling through a family of transcription factors called STATs. Six STATs have been cloned, some of which exist in different isomeric forms, and all share a high degree of conservation of their structural domains (13.Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar, 14.Ihle J. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). These include a DNA-binding domain, a site for homo- or heterodimer formation, and also conserved residues for tyrosine and serine phosphorylation by Janus protein kinases (JAKs) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), respectively (15.Zhang X. Blenis J. Li H. Schindler C. Chen-Kiang S. Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). STATs phosphorylated by JAK/MAPK dimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where they transactivate STAT-responsive genes. Recent studies have implicated STATs in both pro- and anti-apoptotic signaling. For example, a STAT-1-deficient cell line is resistant to tumor necrosis factor-α-induced apoptosis (16.Kumar A. Commane M. Flickinger T.W. Horvath C.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1630-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), and STAT-1 has been implicated in transcriptional activation of some caspases (17.Chin Y.E. Kitagawa B. Kuida K. Flavell R.A. Fu X.-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5328-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). In contrast, a dominant-negative form of STAT-3 has been shown to prevent interleukin-6-dependent cell growth and to induce apoptosis in a myeloid cell line (18.Minami M. Inoue M. Wei S. Takeda M. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3963-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In addition, the ability of IFN-α/β to rescue T cell clones from apoptosis induced by interleukin-2 withdrawal is dependent on STAT-2 (19.Kaneko S. Suzuki N. Koizumi H. Yamamoto S. Sakane T. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1997; 109: 165-193Google Scholar), and the anti-apoptotic effects of interleukin-9 appear to involve homo/heterodimers of STAT-1, -3, and -5 (20.Bauer J.H. Lui K.D. You Y. Lai S.Y. Goldsmith M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9255-9260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). JAK/STAT signaling pathways have also been implicated in the transduction of extracellular stimuli in the heart. For example, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by cardiotrophin-1 and leukemia inhibitory factor is mediated by JAK/STAT-3 (21.Pennica D. Shaw K.J. Swanson T.A. Moore M.W. Shelton D.L. Zioncheck K.A. Rosenthal A. Taga T. Paoni N.F. Wood W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10915-10919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 22.Pennica D. King K. Shaw K.J. Luis E. Rullamas J. Luoh S.-M. Darbonne W.C. Knutzon D.S. Yen R. Chien K.R. Baker J.B. Wood W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1142-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Moreover, angiotensin II, another cardiomyocyte hypertrophic factor, also signals through a JAK/STAT pathway, although involving different members of the STAT family and with different time kinetics (23.Masareno E. Dhar M. Siddiqui M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5590-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In contrast, there is little information on the role of STATs in mediating pro- and anti-apoptotic signals in the heart. In this study, we have therefore investigated whether STATs are involved in apoptotic cell death induced by simulated ischemia/reperfusion in primary cardiomyocytes in vitro and in the intact heart ex vivo. The data suggest that STAT-1 and STAT-3 play roles in pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic signaling, respectively. Since STAT-1 and STAT-3 can form heterodimers, the molecular constitution of these heterodimers may determine the balance between death and survival of cells in the ischemic myocardium. The STAT-1 expression vector was kindly provided by Koichi Nakajima (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). The STAT-3 expression vector was kindly provided by Shizuo Akira (Hyogo College of Medicine, Hyogo, Japan). The 5′-caspase-1 promoter-luciferase reporter construct was kindly provided by Richard Flavell (Yale University, New Haven, CT). The pST1-GL2 vector, which contains the STAT-1-binding site coupled to the luciferase reporter gene, was constructed by ligating the STAT-1 region of SIEm67 (5′-GATCTGATTACGGGAAATG-3) into the pGL2-luciferase vector (Promega). The antisense STAT-1 vector was constructed by inserting the STAT-1 cDNA in the antisense orientation into the pcDNA3 vector. Transfection of reporter constructs and expression vectors into cardiac cells was performed by the calcium phosphate method. Ventricular myocytes isolated from the hearts of neonatal rats (Harlan Sprague-Dawley) that were less than 2 days old were cultured as described previously (24.Brar B.K. Stephanou A. Wagstaff M.J.D. Coffin R.S. Marber M.S. Englemann G. Latchman D.S. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1999; 31: 135-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. After collagenase digestion, the cells were pre-plated in medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1000 mg/liter glucose, 1 mmol/literl-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (all from Life Technologies, Inc.)) supplemented with 15% (v/v) fetal calf serum on 10-cm tissue culture dishes. Pre-plating of the cell suspension for 30 min allows contaminating fibroblasts to attach, and the myocytes remain free within the culture medium. Subsequent to this incubation, the cardiomyocyte cell suspension was transferred onto six-well (3-cm) gelatin-coated plates (Falcon) at a density of 105 cells/well. This plating system yields cell cultures that are >95% myocytes as determined by indirect staining with a monoclonal mouse antibody to desmin. After 24 h, the medium was were replaced with the above medium containing reduced fetal calf serum at 1% (v/v) (hereafter referred to as growth medium) for an additional 24 h before experimentation Within 3 days, a confluent monolayer of spontaneously beating myocytes was formed. To subject the cells to simulated ischemia, the normal growth medium of the cardiomyocyte cultures was replaced with 1 ml of ischemic buffer (137 mm NaCl, 12 mm KCl, 0.49 mmMgCl2, 0.9 mmCaCl2·H2O, 4 mm HEPES, 20 mm sodium lactate, and 10 mm deoxyglucose (pH 6.2; Sigma)), and the cells were incubated at 37 °C in an ischemic chamber for 4 h in an atmosphere of 0% oxygen, 5% CO2, and balance gas argon. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion and TUNEL, immediately after the stress. For control conditions, untreated cells and those treated with IFN-γ (10 ng/ml; Sigma) or pretreated with the caspase-1-specific inhibitor Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp (BIOMOL Research Labs Inc.) were cultured with 1 ml of modified Esumi control buffer (137 mm CaCl2, 3.8 mm KCl, 0.49 mm MgCl2, 0.9 mm CaCl2, 4 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4)) for 4 h at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 21% O2, and balance N2 (normoxic environment). Subsequent to this period, apoptotic cells were assessed by TUNEL or annexin V (see below). In some experiments, cells exposed to simulated ischemia for 4 h were returned to a normoxic environment for a further 16 h. For the ex vivo studies, hearts were quickly removed and mounted in a Langendorff perfusion apparatus and then perfused with an oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit buffer as described previously (25.Marber M.S. Latchman D.S. Walker J.M. Yellon D.M. Circulation. 1993; 88: 1264-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). For the induction of ischemia and reoxygenation, the left coronary artery was surgically occluded for 35 min by suture ligation, followed by 2 h of reperfusion. After this period, the hearts were infused with 0.5 ml of 0.25% Evans blue solution to delineate the ischemic area at risk within the left ventricular wall; and either tissues were frozen directly for Western blot analysis, or sections were placed in 4% formaldehyde and then embedded in molten paraffin and frozen until immunofluorescent analysis. Cells were exposed to a 4-h non-lethal ischemic insult as described above and harvested immediately or following 24 h of reoxygenation. Approximately 1 × 104 cells were harvested in 100 μl of 2× concentrated SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. Cardiac ventricular tissue (∼0.2 g) was homogenized in 0.2 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm HCl, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After centrifugation, the supernatant was removed, and the cells were transferred into 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. Cells were lysed by three 20-s bursts of sonication in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer cooled on ice between each sonication. Tissue debris was removed by centrifugation (12,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C), and an equal volume of SDS buffer was added to the supernatant, which was boiled for 3 min. Samples were then electrophoresed on a 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and subjected to Western blotting with anti-phosphorylated STAT-1, anti-STAT-1, anti-phosphorylated STAT-3, anti-STAT-3, or anti-caspase-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Immunofluorescent staining was performed as described previously (26.Scarabelli T.M. Stephanou A. Knight R.A. Rayment N.B. Cooper A. Brar B.K. Lawrence K.M. Santilli G. Latchman D.S. Baxter G.F. Yellon D.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 228: 23-28Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, ventricular sections were dewaxed; deparaffined in xylene; and subsequently rehydrated with 100% ethanol, 70% ethanol, and distilled water. Sections were then pretreated in Tris-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml trypsin, washed with Tris-buffered saline, and incubated with anti-STAT-1 antibody (1:50) for 1 h and subsequently with rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody for a further 1 h. Sections were thoroughly washed with Tris-buffered saline, and slides were mounted under glass coverslips using antifade mounting medium and examined by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Slides were also prepared in which sections were stained for STAT-1 and TUNEL labeling for co-localization of STAT-1- and TUNEL-positive cells. TUNEL staining was performed using a commercially available kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For TUNEL staining, cardiomyocytes were plated onto 24-well tissue culture dishes. TUNEL assays were performed after the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 25 °C and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase reaction solution containing 2 mm fluorescein-conjugated dUTP and 10 units of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to the cells for 2 h in a 37 °C humidified incubator. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were then imaged by fluorescence microscopy. The percentage of apoptotic nuclei is expressed as a percentage of total nuclei. Annexin V labeling was performed following the exposure of cells to a 2-h ischemic insult as described previously (24.Brar B.K. Stephanou A. Wagstaff M.J.D. Coffin R.S. Marber M.S. Englemann G. Latchman D.S. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1999; 31: 135-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For assessing the effects of STAT-1, STAT-3, and antisense STAT-1 on ischemia-induced cell death in cardiomyocytes, cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase plus 2 μg of test expression vector. 24 h following transfection, cells were fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde and stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside. Percentage of cell death was determined by calculating the fraction of blue cells rounded and blebbed as a fraction of total blue cells. All assays were evaluated in triplicate, and the means ± S.E. were calculated. Cadiac myocytes were treated with 10 ng/ml IFN-γ for 15 min or exposed to ischemia for 4 h, and cells were harvested in cold phosphate-buffered saline. Nuclear extracts were prepared and used in band shift assays as described previously (27.Dent C.L. Latchman D.S. Latchman D.S. Transcription Factors, a Practical Approach. IRL Press Ltd., Oxford1993: 1-26Google Scholar) with a STAT-1 SIEm67 DNA probe that serves as a binding site for STAT-1. For supershift assays, nuclear extracts were incubated with anti-STAT-1 antibody for 30 min prior to incubation with the DNA probe. Complexes were separated by 4% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and exposed to autoradiography. Initially, we assessed whether cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes undergoing apoptosis induced by ischemia also show modulation of STAT-1. As shown in Fig. 1, cardiomyocytes exposed to ischemia for 4 h showed increased STAT-1 expression. The induction of STAT-1 was increased further in cardiac cells that were exposed to 4 h of ischemia followed by 16 h of reoxygenation. Interestingly, it was observed that STAT-1 basal levels were consistently low in cardiac cells compared with a number of other cell types that we have studied. We also tested whether STAT-1 was activated by phosphorylation in response to ischemia using a specific anti-phosphorylated STAT-1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1, exposure of cardiac cells to ischemia alone or ischemia/reoxygenation also resulted in the phosphorylation of STAT-1. In contrast, STAT-3 expression was not affected by ischemia (Fig. 1). The findings that STAT-1 phosphorylation was detected by 4 h and that this level was sustained for a further 16 h were unexpected since most studies have shown that STAT-1 phosphorylation usually occurs as a transient and immediate response. It is therefore possible that secondary responses during simulated ischemia and followed by the reoxygenation phase may be responsible for sustained STAT-1 activation. In any case, these results indicate that the levels of both non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of STAT-1 are increased after an ischemic stimulus. To demonstrate that the STAT-1 protein induced in cardiomyocyte is able to bind DNA and to modulate gene transcription, we performed band shift assays with a specific STAT-1 oligonucleotide-binding site and also transient transfection experiments using the same STAT-1 DNA element coupled to a luciferase reporter construct. As shown in Fig.1 b, IFN-γ produced a specific retarded band that was increased in the cell extract exposed to ischemia. This retarded band was abolished by an anti-STAT-1 antibody, but not anti-STAT-3 antibody, in nuclear extract from cardiomyocytes exposed to ischemia, thus identifying it as STAT-1. Furthermore, IFN-γ treatment alone or exposure to simulated ischemia/reperfusion resulted in a 5- or 3-fold increase in promoter activity, respectively, thus indicating that exposure of cardiac cells to simulated ischemia/reperfusion results in the activation of STAT-1 able to bind to DNA and to induce gene transcription. As ischemia induced both STAT-1 activation and apoptosis, we wished to determine whether a similar association occurred following exposure to IFN-γ, which is known to activate STAT-1 in non-cardiac cells. As shown in Fig. 2 a, exposure of cardiomyocytes to IFN-γ resulted in activation and phosphorylation of STAT-1. Furthermore, IFN-γ also increased the number of both TUNEL- and annexin V-positive cells, showing that IFN-γ is inducing apoptotic cell death in cardiac cells as assessed by two distinct assays (Fig. 2 b). To determine directly if the increase in STAT-1 expression is linked to stimulation of apoptosis, we transfected a constitutive STAT-1 expression vector into cardiac cells together with a β-galactosidase expression vector to mark the transfected cells and then exposed the cells to ischemia. As a control, cardiac cells were transfected with a expression vector lacking the STAT-1 cDNA insert together with a β-galactosidase vector. Following ischemia, cardiac cells were then stained, and the number of nonviable and viable blue cells (LacZ) was assessed. Stained LacZ cells undergoing cell death are characterized by shrinkage and blebbing after 24 h following an ischemic stimulus. As shown in Fig.3 a, exposure to ischemia resulted in enhanced cell death in cardiac cells overexpressing STAT-1 compared with cells overexpressing the vector lacking the STAT-1 cDNA. In contrast, cardiac cells overexpressing STAT-1 alone without exposure to ischemia did not show enhanced cell death, suggesting that ischemia is necessary for the activation of STAT-1-induced cell death (Fig. 3 a). To confirm a role for functional STAT-1 in ischemia-induced cell death, we repeated the above experiments, but transfected cardiac cells with a antisense STAT-1 vector to inhibit the endogenous expression of STAT-1 and then subjected these cells to ischemia. As shown in Fig.3 b, antisense STAT-1 reduced the level of cell death compared with the control vector following exposure to ischemia. These data strongly suggest that STAT-1 plays a role in ischemia-induced cell death in cardiac cells. Fig. 3 c shows that the antisense STAT-1 vector reduced both the activation (ST1p) and induction (ST1) of STAT-1 in cardiac cells exposed to IFN-γ, demonstrating that the antisense STAT-1 vector is indeed inhibiting the levels of endogenous STAT-1 expression in transfected cardiac cells. To confirm that transfected cells overexpressing STAT-1 stained with β-galactosidase (LacZ) were indeed undergoing apoptosis, we also counterstained with TUNEL labeling. The number of TUNEL-positive cells paralleled the total amount of cell death obtained in Fig. 3 a, with a greater number of apoptotic cardiomyocytes being observed following transfection of STAT-1 and exposure to ischemia/reperfusion compared with the control vector exposed to ischemia/reperfusion (TableI). Thus, STAT-1-overexpressing cardiomyocytes that were exposed to simulated ischemia/reperfusion and that morphologically appeared as condensed and rounded cells were also TUNEL-positive, suggesting that STAT-1 is indeed promoting apoptosis.Table IPercentage of transfected cells (LacZ) that are TUNEL-positiveTreatmentTransfectionTUNEL-stained nuclei%ControlCMVaCMV, cytomegalovirus; I/R, ischemia/reperfusion.11.4 ± 4.1I/RCMV33.9 ± 9.3I/RSTAT-148.6 ± 8.2Cells were transfected with empty cytomegalovirus expression vector or the STAT-1 vector and then either untreated or exposed to simulated ischemia/reperfusion.

Open table in a new tab Cells were transfected with empty cytomegalovirus expression vector or the STAT-1 vector and then either untreated or exposed to simulated ischemia/reperfusion. Values are the mean ± S.E. of three determinations. To determine whether induction of cell death was specific for STAT-1, we repeated these experiments, but transfected cardiac cells with an expression vector for STAT-3. As shown in Fig.4 a, overexpression of STAT-3 reduced the level of ischemia-induced apoptotic cell death. Moreover, STAT-3 also inhibited the effect of STAT-1 overexpression on apoptotic cell death in cardiac cells exposed to ischemia in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4 a). Fig.4 b also demonstrates that STAT-1 transfected cells expressed higher levels of STAT-1 than cells transfected with the control vector containing no STAT-1 cDNA insert. Cells transfected with the STAT-3 vector also expressed higher levels of STAT-3 compared with control cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4 a). These results indicate that the relative levels of STAT-1/STAT-3 may be critical in determining susceptibility to cardiac cell death. The evidence that STAT-1 is involved in ischemia-induced cell death suggests that it may activate specific genes required for this process. Recently, IFN-γ and STAT-1 have been shown to modulate the level of caspase-1 expression in non-cardiac cells (28.Xu X. Fu X.-Y. Chong A.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2832-2837PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed studies to test whether the caspase-1 gene was modulated at the transcription level by transfection experiments using a caspase-1 promoter-luciferase reporter construct in cardiac cells exposed to either IFN-γ or ischemia. As shown in Fig. 5 a, IFN-γ increased the activity of the caspase-1 promoter by 5-fold over untreated cells. In addition, overexpression of STAT-1 together with IFN-γ treatment further enhanced the activity of the caspase-1 promoter. Cardiomyocytes exposed to ischemia also transactivated the caspase-1 promoter (Fig. 5 b). Moreover, transfection of antisense STAT-1 inhibited both the IFN-γ/STAT-1- and ischemia-induced activation of the caspase-1 promoter (Fig. 5). We also observed the active p20 form of caspase-1 in cardiac cells exposed to IFN-γ or ischemia (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that the caspase-1 gene is a target for STAT-1 that could modulate the level of apoptosis in cardiac cells exposed to IFN-γ or ischemia. To examine this further, cardiomyocytes were pretreated with a specific inhibitor for caspase-1 protease (Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp) and then exposed to IFN-γ or ischemia. As shown in Fig. 6, Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp blocked both IFN-γ- and ischemia-induced apoptosis. These results strongly suggest a role for caspase-1 in ischemia- and IFN-γ-induced cell death in cardiac cells that involves the activation of STAT-1. Finally, we examined whether our in vitro data with cardiac cells on ischemia-induced apoptosis by STAT-1 and caspase-1 were also reproducible in the intact heart. Experiments were performed using 35-min coronary occlusion to simulate ischemia in the intact heart ex vivo in a Langendorff perfusion system. After the exposure to 35 min of ischemia, the hearts were reperfused for a further 2 h; then the left ventricles were removed, and Western blotting was performed to assess the levels of STAT-1 and caspase-1. As shown in Fig.7 a, the levels of both STAT-1 and phosphorylated STAT-1 were dramatically increased in ischemic ventricles compared with control ventricles. Moreover, the increased levels of STAT-1 were accompanied by increased cleavage of caspase-1 (Fig. 7 b). The above data (Fig. 5) demonstrated that simulated ischemia/reperfusion increases the levels of the caspase-1 promoter in cardiac cells, but we were unable to observe an increase in the levels of the caspase-1 precursor in vitro and in the intact heartex vivo. It is possible that the balance between the levels of precursor and the activation/cleavage of the active product is a rapid response, which may explain this observation. However, these results do suggest that ischemia-induced cell death is paralleled by the induction of STAT-1 and processing of caspase-1 ex vivo. Furthermore, immunofluorescent staining also demonstrated an increase in STAT-1-positive staining in ventricular tissue sections in response to ischemia/reperfusion that co-localized with TUNEL-positive myocytes (Table II) These results further support a key role for STAT-1 in ischemia/reperfusion-induced cell death in the intact heart.Table IISTAT-1- and TUNEL-positive cardiomyocytes in control or after ischemia/reperfusionSTAT-1 + veave, positive; TUN, TUNEL; ST1, STAT-1; I/R, ischemia/reperfusion.TUNEL + veTUN + veTUN − veST1 − veST1 + veControl1.5 + 0.51.5 + 0.50.10.1I/Rave, positive; TUN, TUNEL; ST1, STAT-1; I/R, ischemia/reperfusion.5 + 113 + 21.5 + 0.513 + 2Shown is the percentage of total cells that are STAT-1- or TUNEL-positive.

Open table in a new tab Shown is the percentage of total cells that are STAT-1- or TUNEL-positive. Note the increase in double positive cells for STAT-1 and TUNEL following ischemia/reperfusion. This study demonstrates that exposure of cardiomyocytes to ischemia in vitro and in the intact heart ex vivoor to IFN-γ results in the rapid induction and activation of STAT-1, but not STAT-3. Overexpression of STAT-1 in vitro together with an ischemic stimulus leads to enhanced cell death in cardiac cells. Furthermore, inhibition of endogenous STAT-1 by a antisense STAT-1 construct greatly reduced the level of ischemia-induced cell death. Similarly, overexpression of STAT-3 reduced apoptosis induced by ischemia and by ischemia plus IFN-γ. Hence, these results indicate that STAT-1 is able to promote apoptosis in cardiac cells exposed to either IFN-γ or ischemia and that STAT-3 antagonizes the STAT-1-mediated cell death pathway. We also show that one such STAT-1 target gene is caspase-1 and demonstrate proteolytic cleavage of the caspase-1 precursor in the perfused heart ex vivoin response to ischemia/reperfusion Several previous studies have identified a role for STAT-1 in the regulation of apoptosis in non-cardiac cells (16.Kumar A. Commane M. Flickinger T.W. Horvath C.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1630-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 17.Chin Y.E. Kitagawa B. Kuida K. Flavell R.A. Fu X.-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5328-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 28.Xu X. Fu X.-Y. Chong A.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2832-2837PubMed Google Scholar). A STAT-1-deficient cell line is resistant to apoptosis by tumor necrosis factor-α (16.Kumar A. Commane M. Flickinger T.W. Horvath C.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1630-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), and we have evidence that these deficient cells are also resistant to ischemia-induced apoptosis (data not shown). IFN-γ, acting through STAT-1, is known to increase the expression of the death receptor Fas and its cognate ligand, FasL, thus promoting autocrine suicide (28.Xu X. Fu X.-Y. Chong A.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2832-2837PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, the present data showing that overexpression of STAT-1 increases ischemia- and IFN-γ-induced apoptosis, whereas the antisense STAT-1 vector reduces it, are fully in accordance with these observations. Involvement of STAT-1 in pro-apoptotic signaling does not, however, preclude a role for other mediators. For example, in similar experiments, overexpression of p53 has also been shown to enhance ischemia-induced apoptosis in primary cultures of cardiomyocytes (29.Lung X. Bouluyt M.O. Hipolito M.L. Lundberg M.S. Zheng J.-S. O'Neil L. Cirielli C. Lakatta E.G. Crow M.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2635-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Moreover, p53 increases the activity of the Bax promoter, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member (30.Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In addition, studies in our laboratory have shown that p53 is also able to inhibit the activity of the Bcl-2 promoter. 2V. Budhram-Mahadeo, P. J. Morris, M. D. Smith, and D. S. Latchman, unpublished data. Since Bcl-2 and Bax can heterodimerize and since the ratio of Bcl-2 and Bax can determine susceptibility to apoptosis (31.Yin X.M. Otival Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 272-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar, 32.Zha H. Aime-Sempe C. Sato T. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7440-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), p53, by enhancing the proportion of Bax in the heterodimer, will deliver a pro-apoptotic signal. Furthermore, other factors such as c-Myc, tumor necrosis factor-α, and Fas have also been implicated in cardiac apoptosis (33.MacLellan W.R. Schneider M.D. Circulation Res. 1997; 81: 137-144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The apoptotic program is executed by activation of a cascade of proteases, the caspases. These have been divided into initiator (such as caspase-8 and -9) and effector (such as caspase-1, -3, and -6) caspases. The STAT-1-deficient cell line has low constitutive levels of caspase family members, consistent with its resistance to apoptosis (16.Kumar A. Commane M. Flickinger T.W. Horvath C.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1630-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Caspase-1-deficient cells are similarly refractory to apoptosis induced by IFN-γ (17.Chin Y.E. Kitagawa B. Kuida K. Flavell R.A. Fu X.-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5328-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Our data showing that apoptosis is reduced by a caspase-1-specific inhibitor and that STAT-1 enhances caspase-1 expression are consistent with caspase-1 playing an important role in ischemia- and IFN-γ-induced apoptosis in the heart. However, the fact that some apoptosis was seen with a caspase-3-specific inhibitor (data not shown) suggests that other effector caspases such as caspase-3 may also be involved. Our finding that induction of STAT-1 co-localizes with TUNEL-positive nuclei is further evidence that STAT-1 plays a role in promoting apoptosis in the intact heart. Our results also demonstrate that overexpression of STAT-3 can antagonize the apoptosis-promoting effects of STAT-1. STAT-1 and STAT-3 share a DNA-binding domain and phosphorylation sites for JAK and MAPK, and both these STATs can form heterodimers. We (36.Stephanou A. Brar B. Heads R. Knight R.A. Marber M.S. Pennica D. Latchman D.S. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1998; 30: 849-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and others (34.Fujio Y. Kunisada K. Hirota H. Yamauchi-Takihara K.

This suggests that MAPK-mediated serine phosphorylation of STAT-3 may, after its heterodimerization, allow it to counteract the pro-apoptotic effects of STAT-1 that has been tyrosine-phosphorylated through a JAK pathway. This is in accordance with previous findings that JAK and MAPK converge to maximally activate STAT signaling (15.Zhang X. Blenis J. Li H. Schindler C. Chen-Kiang S. Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) and that JAK and MAPK may interact to regulate apoptosis. This study shows that STAT-1 and STAT-3 may interact to regulate apoptosis in the heart following an ischemic insult. Further studies are underway to determine other possible target genes for STAT-1 in mediating apoptosis in the heart during ischemia and other stressful stimuli. It is already clear that STAT-1 is likely to play a critical role in the regulation of ischemia-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. A further understanding of the mechanism of STAT-1-induced apoptosis may lead to additional therapeutic approaches against damage to the heart caused by the induction of programmed cell death."

Prominent among these genes were matrix proteins such as fibronectin, genes that regulate mesangial cell matrix production such as connective tissue growth factor, and genes encoding potential modulators of vascular tone and intraglomerular pressure such as actin binding proteins (5.Murphy M.

Two gene products were reported that did not show homology to sequences of known genes and were termed increased in highglucose-1 and -2 (IHG-1 1 andIHG-2) (5.Murphy M. Godson C. Cannon S. Kato S.

Primary cultures of human mesangial cells were propagated as described previously (5.Murphy M. Godson C. Cannon S. Kato S. Mackenzie H.S. Martin F. Brady H.R. J. Biol.

For the application of mechanical cyclic stretch, primary human mesangial cells were seeded on either flexible or rigid based, elastin-coated six-well plates (Flex I and Flex II plates, Flex CellTMInternational, Hillsborough, NH). Cells were grown to 90% confluency and then serum-restricted in CloneticsTM mesangial basal medium supplemented with 0.5% fetal calf serum. Cells cultured on flexible plates were subjected to repeated cycles of computer-controlled, vacuum-driven mechanical stretch and relaxation using the Flexercell Strain Unit. Cells were alternately stretched and relaxed at 0.5-s intervals (60 cycles/min) for either 24 or 48 h. The applied vacuum achieved a 17% elongation of the outer annulus of the culture plates. All experiments were carried out at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Nine Male Munich-Wistar uninephrectomized rats were rendered diabetic with streptozotocin, and the RNA was extracted as described previously (5.Murphy M. Godson C. Cannon S. Kato S. Mackenzie H.S.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5830-5834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). PCR products used to generate probes for Northern analysis were amplified using primers for the open reading frame (ORF) of gremlin (sense, ATGAGCCGCACAGCCTACAC; antisense, TTAATCCAAATCGATGGATATGC) and for IHG-2 (sense, CTCAGCCTCCTAGCCAAGTCC; antisense, gttggagaatgtggacaatac). Fibronectin and GAPDH probes were generated as described previously (5.Murphy M. Godson C. Cannon S. Kato S. Mackenzie H.S. Martin F. Brady H.R. J. Biol.

RT-PCR was carried out as reported previously (5.Murphy M. Godson C. Cannon S. Kato S. Mackenzie H.S. Martin F. Brady H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5830-5834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Data base searching and alignments were performed at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool Algorithm (BLAST) (10.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58724) Google Scholar). The Non Redundant (nr) and the Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) data bases were sourced. Contiguous sequences were generated using Fragment Assembly, a program within the Genetics Computer Group Inc. package. UniBlast (11.Guffanti A. Simon G. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar) was used to identify homologous clusters within the UniGene data base and to verify the consensus sequence derived from ESTs. Chromosomal localization data were obtained from the UniGene and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) data bases. Among the mesangial cell genes we previously identified as being induced by high glucose, was a transcript, IHG-2, whose sequence did not show homology against the cumulative data base of characterized sequences (nr data base at NCBI) using the BLAST algorithm (5.Murphy M. Godson C. Cannon S. Kato S. Mackenzie H.S. Martin F. Brady H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5830-5834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). To further characterize this sequence, the sequence ofIHG-2 was searched against the EST data base where a number of matches were obtained. Each of these matches was, in turn, searched against the nr data base at NCBI. Four ESTs, namely W52686, N28395,H80042, and W47324, showed low homology to the 3′-UT region of a rat gene known as drm. The ORF of the human homologue of this gene, gremlin, was also in the data base. Gremlin, together with DAN and cerberus, are members of the cysteine knot superfamily of proteins that have recently been shown to play important roles in limb development and neural crest cell differentiation (7.Hsu D.R. Economides A.N. Wang X. Eimon P.M. Harland R.M Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 673-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 12.Zuniga A. Haramis A.P. McMahon A.P. Zeller R. Nature. 1999; 401: 598-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In the developing limb bud, gremlin is a key mediator of the sonic hedgehog-fibroblast growth factor-4 (SHH-FGF4) feedback loop and can rescue the limb deformity (ld) phenotype, which is due to a defect in the protein formin (12.Zuniga A. Haramis A.P. McMahon A.P. Zeller R. Nature. 1999; 401: 598-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Of potential interest in the context of diabetic nephropathy, gremlin is a putative inhibitor of BMP-2 in models of neural crest cell differentiation (7.Hsu D.R. Economides A.N. Wang X. Eimon P.M. Harland R.M Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 673-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). BMP-2 has recently been reported to have antiproliferative effects on mesangial cells (13.Ghosh Choudhury G. Kim Y.S. Simon M. Wozney J. Harris S. Ghosh Choudhury N. Abboud H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10897-10902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar,14.Ghosh Choudhury G. Jin D.C. Kim Y.S. Celeste A. Ghosh Choudhury N. Abboud H.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 490-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To generate a link between the ORF of gremlin andIHG-2, successive BLAST searches were used to identify overlapping sequences in the EST data base. In Fig.1 A, the bar of 4 kb represents the final sequence for gremlin, whereas each of the other bars represents individual sequences in the EST data base that were assembled, where possible, into continuous sequences. However, it was not possible to directly linkIHG-2 to the ORF of gremlin with sequences within the EST data base. Therefore, RNA isolated from human mesangial cells was reverse-transcribed with a primer that recognizes IHG-2. PCR analyses were performed spanning the regions shown in Fig.1 A, and the resulting products were sequenced, allowing a contiguous cDNA of 4049 bp to be generated, which included the open reading frame of gremlin and IHG-2. Fig. 1 B shows a graphical representation of an alignment between rat drm and human gremlin using the BLAST algorithm. Sequence homology is high in the coding region of the cDNA; however, there are only small regions of homology within the 3′-UT region. This explains why IHG-2 did not identifydrm in a BLAST search, but a match to drm, and thus gremlin, was obtained by examining EST sequences further in the 3′ direction. The lack of homology between ratdrm and human gremlin probably results from decreased selective pressure on the 3′-UT region of gene homologues to remain the same between species. Fig. 2 shows the final sequence of human mesangial cell gremlin, indicating the ORF and the region corresponding to IHG-2 (GenBank accession no. AF110137). At time of submission, this sequence matched 136 separate EST entries in the EST data base. Of these entries, 23.5% were derived from fibroblast libraries; 30% were from bone tissue libraries; and 34% were derived from tumor-related libraries. This sequence was also searched against the UniGene data base using the UniBlast program. This identified four UniGene clusters, Hs.214148, Hs.40098, Hs.114330, and Hs.239507. Two of these clusters, Hs.40098 and Hs.239507, have been mapped to intervals D15S118–144 and D15S144–165 on chromosome 15, respectively. Secretory granule neuroendocrine protein 1 and the α polypeptide of the nicotinic cholinergic receptor have been mapped to either side of these clusters and have also been mapped more specifically to the 15q11–15 interval. Analysis of the OMIM data base reveals that the formin gene, which was recently shown to induce gremlin expression in developing limb bud (12.Zuniga A. Haramis A.P. McMahon A.P. Zeller R. Nature. 1999; 401: 598-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), is also localized to this interval. Diabetes mellitus with multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, or Wolcott-Rallison syndrome, is localized to the 15q11–12 interval (15.Stewart F.J. Carson D.J. Thomas P.S. Humphreys M. Thornton C. Nevin N.C. Clin. Genet. 1996; 49: 152-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the epiphyseal growth plate, immunohistochemical studies have revealed that BMP-2 and -4 are expressed in proliferating and maturing chondrocytes, suggesting that BMP and its receptors play roles in the multistep cascade of enchondral ossification (16.Yazaki Y. Matsunaga S. Onishi T. Nagamine T. Origuchi N. Yamamoto T. Ishidou Y. Imamura T. Sakou T. Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 2339-2344PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of gremlin expression may have implications in both disease states associated with Wolcott-Rallison syndrome. IHG-2 was originally described as a mesangial cell gene whose expression is enhanced by high ambient glucose (5.Murphy M. Godson C. Cannon S. Kato S. Mackenzie H.S. Martin F. Brady H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5830-5834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed on RNA extracted from mesangial cells grown in either 5 mm(“normal”) or 30 mm (“high”) glucose using the ORF of gremlin and IHG-2 probes. Messenger RNA levels were normalized relative to GAPDH. GAPDH mRNA levels were found not to vary with high glucose treatment using 28 S ribosomal RNA as a gel loading control. Both probes detected a 2-fold increase in gene expression under high glucose conditions (Fig.3 A). All subsequent Northern analysis was performed using the ORF of gremlin as a probe. Glomerular hypertension is an independent risk factor for the development of glomerulosclerosis in diabetes mellitus (17.Riser B.L. Cortes P. Yee J. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2000; 9: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To model the effects of glomerular hypertension on mesangial cellgremlin expression in the present study, mesangial cells were propagated under conditions of cyclic mechanical strain for 24 and 48 h (17.Riser B.L. Cortes P. Yee J. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2000; 9: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18.Riser B.L. Cortes P. Zhao X. Bernstein J. Dumler F. Narins R.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1932-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). This model perturbs mesangial cell matrix production and metabolism in a manner similar to that observed in diabetic glomerulosclerosis in vivo. Mesangial cellgremlin mRNA levels were significantly enhanced under conditions of mechanical strain, in parallel with increased fibronectin mRNA expression (Fig. 3 B). Distortion of cell surface adhesion plaques and cytoskeletal proteins has been reported to activate a variety of signal transduction pathways (19.Yasuda T. Kondo S. Owada S. Ishida M. Harris R.C. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 1999; 14: 58-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rho GTPases regulate the actin cytoskeletal assembly through rapid formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions (20.Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3785) Google Scholar). Formin is a downstream effector of Rho whose actions may, at least in part, be mediated by the glucose-inducible actin-binding protein profilin (21.Frazier J.A. Field C.M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R414-R417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also identified in our initial screen (5.Murphy M. Godson C. Cannon S. Kato S. Mackenzie H.S. Martin F. Brady H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5830-5834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Interestingly, formin induces gremlin expression in the developing limb bud as part of a SHH-FGF4 feedback loop, thus establishing a potential link between mechanical strain and increased gremlin expression (12.Zuniga A. Haramis A.P. McMahon A.P. Zeller R. Nature. 1999; 401: 598-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). To assessgremlin expression in diabetic nephropathy in vivo, gremlin mRNA levels were measured by Northern blot analysis with RNA isolated from the renal cortex of control rats and from diabetic rats 14 weeks after induction of diabetes mellitus by streptozotocin (STZ). In keeping with the in vitroexperiments reported above, gremlin mRNA levels (Fig.3 C) were increased in kidneys from diabetic rats, coincident with proteinuria and histologic evidence of diabetic nephropathy (data not shown). Both high ambient glucose concentrations and cyclic mechanical strain provoke TGF-β1 production by mesangial cells in vitro, and TGF-β1 appears to be a major stimulus for mesangial matrix accumulation in diabetic glomeruliin vivo (1.Parring H.-H.

Electrolyte Metab. 1998; 24: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To probe the mechanism by which high glucose triggers gremlin expression, primary human mesangial cells were propagated in 5 or 30 mm glucose in the presence and absence of anti-TGF-β1 neutralizing antibody (1 μg/ml). The latter reagent blunted glucose-triggered gremlin expression (Fig. 4 A), and therefore the ability of TGF-β1 to alter gremlin expression was investigated in subsequent experiments. The addition of exogenous human recombinant TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml, 24 h) to serum-restricted (24 h) mesangial cells also augmented gremlin mRNA levels (Fig.4 B), suggesting that high glucose enhancesgremlin mRNA expression, at least in part, through its ability to stimulate TGF-β1 expression. In aggregate, these observations suggest the presence of a novel autocrine loop through which TGF-β1 induces gremlin gene expression and may thereby regulate the activity of mesangial-derived BMPs (see below). Gremlin is a putative antagonist of BMP-2 (7.Hsu D.R. Economides A.N. Wang X. Eimon P.M. Harland R.M Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 673-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) and BMP-4 (23.Pearce J.J. Penny G. Rossant J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 98-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Specifically, gremlin has been recently reported to form heterodimers with BMPs and thereby antagonize BMP signaling (7.Hsu D.R. Economides A.N. Wang X. Eimon P.M. Harland R.M Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 673-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Although expression of BMP receptors in human mesangial cells has been reported (13.Ghosh Choudhury G. Kim Y.S. Simon M. Wozney J. Harris S. Ghosh Choudhury N. Abboud H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10897-10902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), expression of the BMP-2 and BMP-4 has not. In the present study, RT-PCR was employed as an initial assessment of mesangial cell BMP expression. Whereas little or noBMP-2 mRNA was detected in mesangial cells propagated in 5 mm glucose, a marked induction of BMP-2expression was observed in cells cultured in 30 mm glucose (Fig. 4 C). In contrast, BMP-4 expression levels were relatively unchanged. Interestingly, whereas BMP-2 does not stimulate fibronectin expression in mesangial cells in vitro, BMP-2 has been recently shown to block mesangial cell proliferation triggered by epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor (13.Ghosh Choudhury G. Kim Y.S. Simon M. Wozney J. Harris S. Ghosh Choudhury N. Abboud H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10897-10902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 14.Ghosh Choudhury G. Jin D.C. Kim Y.S. Celeste A. Ghosh Choudhury N. Abboud H.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 490-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Our results raise the possibility that TGF-β1-stimulated expression of gremlin may contribute to mesangial cell proliferative responses in this setting. The influence of gremlin on cell proliferation appears complex, however, and may vary markedly depending on the cell type and proliferative stimulus. In contrast to the aforementioned potentially pro-proliferative actions, overexpression of the gremlin homologue, drm, causes apoptosis in fibroblasts by an ERK-mediated pathway, whereas cells transformed with oncogenes such as v-mos show suppressed drm expression (6.Topol L.Z. Marx M. Laugier D. Bogdanova N. Boubnov N.V. Clausen P.A. Calothy G. Blair D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4801-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Similarly, overexpression of DAN, another cysteine knot superfamily member with homology to drm/gremlin, retards fibroblast entry into S phase (24.Ozaki T. Nakamura Y. Enomoto H. Hirose M. Sakiyama S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 895-900PubMed Google Scholar). Studies are ongoing to probe the consequences of gremlin-BMP interactions on mesangial cell growth and matrix production. In summary, our results demonstrate that the DAN family membergremlin is induced in diabetic nephropathy in vivo and implicate both metabolic and hemodynamic stress as stimuli for gremlin expression. The findings that high glucose-triggered gremlin expression is mimicked by addition of exogenous TGF-β1, blunted by anti-TGF-β1 neutralizing antibody, and occurs in association with induction of mesangial cellBMP-2 suggests the presence of a novel autocrine loop, which may limit the bioactivity of TGF-β1 superfamily members and modulate mesangial cell proliferation within the diabetic mesangium. The further elucidation of the functional interactions of the DAN family of secreted proteins, such as gremlin, with TGF-β1 superfamily members may shed light on the complex multipronged molecular events that perturb cell proliferation and matrix production in diabetic glomerulosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2041146932,"Pex3p is a peroxisomal membrane protein that is essential for peroxisome biogenesis. Here, we show that a conserved stretch of positively charged amino acids (Arg11-X-Lys-Lys-Lys15) in the N terminus of Hansenula polymorpha Pex3p is involved in incorporation of the protein into its target membrane. Despite the strong conservation, this sequence shows a high degree of redundancy. Substitution of either Arg11, Lys13, Lys14, or Lys15 with uncharged or negatively charged amino acids did not interfere with Pex3p location and function. However, a mutant Pex3p, carrying negatively charged amino acids at position 13 and 15 (K13E/K15E), caused moderate but significant defects in peroxisome assembly and matrix protein import. Additional changes in the N terminus of Pex3p, e.g. replacing three or four of the positively charged amino acids with negatively charged ones, led to a typical pex3 phenotype, i.e. accumulation of peroxisomal matrix proteins in the cytosol and absence of peroxisomal remnants. Also, in these cases, the mutant Pex3p levels were reduced. Remarkably, mutant Pex3p proteins were mislocalized to mitochondria or the cytosol, depending on the nature of the mutation. Furthermore, in case of reduced amounts of Pex3p, the levels of other peroxisomal membrane proteins, e.g. Pex10p and Pex14p, were also diminished, suggesting that Pex3p maybe involved in the recruitment or stabilization of these proteins (in the membrane)."
https://openalex.org/W1556295515,"We have previously demonstrated that bcl-2 overexpression enhances the metastatic potential of the MCF7 ADR human breast cancer cell line resistant to adriamycin by inducing metastasis-associated properties. To further elucidate the relationship between bcl-2 expression and the metastatic potential of the MCF7 ADR line, we evaluated whether bcl-2 could be also involved in the modulation of the angiogenic phenotype. Four bcl-2-overex-pressing clones, a control transfectant clone, and the MCF7 ADR parental line were used for in vitro and in vivo experiments. Bcl-2 overexpression enhanced the synthesis of the hypoxia-stimulated VEGF protein and mRNA. Northern blot analysis demonstrated an increased VEGF mRNA expression in bcl-2-overex-pressing clones, and reverse transcription-polymer-ase chain reaction showed higher levels of the VEGF121 and VEGF165 mRNA isoforms, which are the most active in eliciting angiogenesis. When incorporated into matrigel, supernatants of bcl-2-trans-fected cells cultured under hypoxic conditions induced an increased angiogenic response in C57BL/6 mice compared with that of control clone. Tumors from bcl-2 transfectants demonstrated increased VEGF expression and neovascularization as compared to the parental line, whereas the apoptosis in in vivo xenografts was similar in control and bcl-2 transfectants. The effect of bcl-2 on angiogenesis was not mediated by p53 protein. These results demonstrate that bcl-2 and hypoxia can act synergis-tically to modulate VEGF expression and the in vivo angiogenic response in the MCF7 ADR line.—Biroccio, A., Candiloro, A., Mottolese, M., Sapora, O., Albini, A., Zupi, G., Del Bufalo, D.

https://openalex.org/W1605085650,"Tobacco smoke is a major cause of both cancer and vascular disease. Although its carcinogenic role via induction of DNA damage and mutation is well established, the mechanisms involved in vascular disease remain unclear. One possibility is that DNA damage causes smooth muscle cell proliferation in the intima of arteries, thereby contributing to atherothrombotic processes. The binding of chemicals to DNA is modulated by detoxification enzymes, including glutathione S-transferases (GST) and microsomal epoxide hydrolase (EPXH). We therefore examined whether polymorphisms in these genes influence risk of cardiovascular disease. Blood was obtained from 398 patients admitted for angiographic investigation of chest pain and 196 age- and sex-matched controls. Patients were subdivided into those with and without previous acute myocardial infarction (AMI). DNA was analyzed for deletions in the GSTM1 and T1 genes and for substitutions in EPXH and GSTP1 genes. The GSTM1 null genotype occurred at a significantly lower frequency in the AMI patient group (48%) compared both to patients with no history of AMI (59%) and to the control group (57.2%). When subjects were stratified for smoking status, a significant association was observed only in smokers, suggesting the polymorphism is more important in the presence of tobacco smoke exposure. The association remained significant after adjusting for age, sex, and stenosis (presence or absence). No significant associations were observed between the other genotypes and cardiovascular disease (chi(2) test; P>0.1). The results of this study indicate that the GSTM1 null genotype is protective against AMI, an effect that is more marked in smokers. However, further study is required in order to elucidate the as yet unexplained, mechanisms underlying this association."
https://openalex.org/W1563178899,"The activation of poly (ADP-ribose) synthetase (PARS) subsequent to DNA damage caused by reactive oxygen or nitrogen species has been implicated in several pathophysiological conditions, including ischemia-reperfusion injury and shock. The aim of this study was to investigate whether PARS inhibitors could provide protection against renal ischemia-reperfusion injury in the rat in vivo. Male Wistar rats were subjected to 45 min bilateral clamping of the renal pedicles, followed by 6 h reperfusion (control animals). Animals were administered the PARS inhibitors 3-aminobenzamide, 1, 5-dihydroxyisoquinoline, or nicotinamide during the reperfusion period. Ischemia, followed by reperfusion, produced significant increases in plasma concentrations of urea, creatinine, and fractional excretion of Na(+) (FE(Na)) and produced a significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). However, administration of the PARS inhibitors significantly reduced urea and creatinine concentrations, suggesting improved renal function. The PARS inhibitors also significantly increased GFR and reduced FE(Na), suggesting the recovery of both glomerular and tubular function, respectively, with a more pronounced recovery of tubular function. In kidneys from control animals, histological examination revealed severe renal damage and immunohistochemical localization demonstrated PARS activation in the proximal tubule. Both renal damage and PARS activation were attenuated by administration of PARS inhibitors during reperfusion. Therefore, we propose that PARS activation contributes to renal reperfusion injury and that PARS inhibitors may be beneficial in renal disorders associated with oxidative stress-mediated injury."

Reverse-phase-HPLC resolved the glycan strands to a family of major peaks, which represented oligosaccharides composed of repeating disaccharide units (N-acetylglucosamine-[β-1,4]-N-acetylmuramic acid) with different degrees of polymerization and terminating withN-acetylmuramic acid residues at the reducing ends. The method allowed separation of strands up to 23–26 disaccharide units with a predominant length between 3 and 10 and an average degree of polymerization of ∼6. Glycan strands with a higher degree of polymerization (>26 disaccharide units) represented 10–15% of the total UV absorbing glycan material. A unique feature of the staphylococcal glycan strands was the presence of minor satellite peaks that were present throughout the HPLC elution profile eluting either just prior or shortly after the major oligosaccharide peaks.

In fact, as of now, the only detailed information available concerning the structure and length distribution of cell wall glycan strands comes from Escherichia coli (1.Harz H. Burgdorf K. Holtje J.V. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 120-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar); only estimates of average length of glycan strands are available for Staphylococcus aureus cell walls (2.Ward J.B. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The reasons why most studies on bacterial cell walls have concentrated on the structure and biosynthesis of the peptide network (3.Quintela J.C. Caparros M. de Pedro M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 125: 95-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Garcia-Bustos J.F. Dougherty T.J. Antimicrob.

No antimicrobial agent of comparable therapeutic importance is available for the transglycosylase reaction by which the disaccharide units (composed ofN-acetyl-d-glucosamine-1,4-β linked toN-acetylmuramic acid) are linked together to form the glycan strands of the cell wall peptidoglycan. Yet, in our current view of cell wall biosynthesis, the first reaction by which disaccharide pentapeptide units are added to the preexisting peptidoglycan is transglycosylation catalyzed by two kinds of enzymes described so far: bifunctional class A penicillin-binding proteins, which, in addition to a penicillin-interacting transpeptidase domain at the C terminus, also possess an N-terminal transglycosylase domain (7.Goffin C. Ghuysen J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1079-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Matsuhashi M. Ghuysen J.M. Hackenbeck R. Bacterial Cell Wall. 27. Elsevier Science B. V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands1994: 55-72Google Scholar) and monofunctional glycosyltransferases (monofunctional enzymes insensitive to β-lactams that only catalyze the formation of β-1,4 glycosidic bonds (9.Di Berardino M.

Reynolds P. Courvalin P. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 401-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). We used a combination of enzymatic hydrolysis, HPLC,1 and mass spectrometry to describe the structure and the length distribution of glycan strands of the S. aureus cell walls. Our observations suggest the presence in S. aureus of a hitherto unidentifiedN-acetylglucosaminidase activity that may be involved with processing the peptidoglycan at some stage of cell wall metabolism. S. aureus strains listed in Table I were grown as described before (14.de Jonge B.L. Chang Y.S. Gage D. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11248-11254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Cell wall isolation and peptidoglycan purification was performed as described before (14.de Jonge B.L. Chang Y.S. Gage D. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11248-11254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To minimize the chances of autolysis during harvesting and processing of cells for peptidoglycan preparation, cultures were rapidly chilled to 4 °C in an ice ethanol bath, centrifuged at 4 °C, and immediately added to an equal volume of boiling 8% SDS. Glycan strands were isolated using a method described by Harz et al. (1.Harz H. Burgdorf K. Holtje J.V. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 120-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), modified as follows. Purified peptidoglycan (5 mg/ml) was first hydrolyzed with recombinant lysostaphin (1 μg/ml) (Sigma) in 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, at 37 °C for 18 h with stirring. The solubilized S. aureuspeptidoglycan was diluted with one volume of water. Murein stem peptides were cleaved from the peptidoglycan with purified pneumococcal amidase (N-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine amidase, 50–100 μg/ml) (16.Garcia-Bustos J.F. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 447-453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by incubating samples for another 18 h at 37 °C with stirring. Samples were boiled for 3 min and microcentrifuged, and the pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 2 with phosphoric acid. Glycan strands were separated from stem peptides on a MonoS column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); samples were applied on the column, washed with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 2 (buffer A), at 0.7 ml/min, and eluted with 1 m NaCl in buffer A at the same flow rate. Sample detection was followed at 202 nm. The glycan fraction eluted in the void volume with the sodium phosphate buffer, and stem peptides eluted with the subsequent salt step. The glycan fraction was collected and concentrated to approximately 500 μl. Both lysostaphin and the pneumococcal amidase used to generate the glycan strands free of stem peptides were tested for purity by incubating purified glycan fragments under the same conditions as during peptidoglycan hydrolysis. No digestion of the purified glycans was observed (data not shown). 2Although recombinant lysostaphin at the concentration (1 μg/ml) and under the conditions used had no contaminating glycan strand-hydrolyzing activity, a 1000-fold higher concentration (1 mg/ml) of the enzyme caused partial degradation of purified glycan fragments. This activity detected in the Sigma lot 69H0955 appears to be a lysozyme. Glycan samples were reduced in 0.25m borate buffer, pH 9, with sodium borohydride (Sigma) for 30 min prior to HPLC analysis. The pH of the sample was adjusted to 2 with phosphoric acid. Reduced glycan samples were resolved with a reverse-phase Nucleosil C18 column (4.6 × 25 cm, 5-μm particle size, 300-Å pore size). Prepacked HPLC columns were purchased from Keystone Scientific (Bellefonte, PA). All HPLC grade solvents were from Fisher. A convex gradient from 0 to 10.5% acetonitrile (−4 curve of the Shimadzu CLASS-VP software) in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 2, was used over 90 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Unresolved glycan material was eluted after the convex gradient in a single step with 30% acetonitrile in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 2. Glycan material was detected at 202 nm. Radiolabeled samples were also detected with a flow scintillation analyzer (Packard 150TR, Meriden, CT) using Ultima-flo AP scintillation mixture (Packard, Meriden, CT) at a 3:1 ratio. Counts were read for 6 s and converted to counts per minute (cpm) directly by the instrument. Purified peptidoglycan was hydrolyzed with recombinant lysostaphin and pneumococcal amidase as described above. The pH of the samples was adjusted to 5 with phosphoric acid. Either mutanolysin from Streptomyces globisporus (10 μg/ml)(Sigma) or cellosyl fromStreptomyces coelicolor (10 μg/ml)(Hoechst Marion Roussel, Frankfurt, Germany) was added to the samples, which were incubated for another 18 h at 37 °C with stirring. The samples were boiled and microcentrifuged, and the supernatants containing the hydrolyzed glycans were further purified with a MonoS column as described above. Individual peaks were collected manually during glycan analysis (see above) and when necessary concentrated to 400 μl. Unfractionated glycan and individual peaks were desalted on a reverse-phase Nucleosil C18 column (4.6 × 25 cm, 5-μm particle size, 300-Å pore size) with 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid (Pierce) in water at 0.5 ml/min. After washing for 1 min, the individual peaks of glycan material were eluted from the column with a single step of 25% acetonitrile in 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid. Each sample was lyophilized and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). Glycan fragments that were purified to determine the reducing end by derivatization were collected from HPLC separations of nonreduced glycan samples. Under these conditions, the glycan peaks were only resolved as broad peaks although the pattern of peaks remained essentially the same as that of borohydride reduced samples (data not shown). Major peaks 3 and 4 from strain COL were collected and desalted. Mass spectra were obtained on a Voyager Elite MALDI-time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Perseptive Biosystems, Inc., Farmingham, MA), equipped with a pulsed nitrogen laser (337 nm, 3-ns pulse), using GRAMS software for data collection and analysis. Operating parameters included the accelerating voltage at 22 kV and a grid voltage of 73%. For each spectrum, 128 (or 256) laser shots were averaged. The ions of the α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) dimer and Glu1-fibrinopeptide B were used for external calibration. Matrix solutions were prepared by dissolving 20 μg of CHCA or 6-aza-2-thiothymine (ATT), both available from Aldrich, in 1 μl of acetonitrile-water (9:1, v/v) followed by 200 μl of nitrocellulose (NC, Aldrich, 11.8–12.2%) in 1,2-dimethoxyethane. Methyl esters of glycan samples were prepared as follows. A solution of a 4-μl sample (about 50–100 pmol) in acetonitrile-water (9:1, v/v) was evaporated (Speed Vac) to dryness. To the dried residue, a solution of 30 μl of HCl (dry) in absolute methanol (prepared by dissolving 30 μl of acetyl chloride in 300 μl of absolute methanol (Caution: vigorous reaction! Acetyl chloride has to be added dropwise, under a hood)) was introduced and stirred by vortex for 30 s. The mixture, after standing at room temperature for 2 h, was evaporated to dryness (Speed Vac) and reconstituted in 10 μl of acetonitrile-water (9:1, v/v). A thin layer of matrix embedded in NC was prepared by depositing 0.5 μl of either CHCA/NC or ATT/NC solution on the sample plate. After 30 s, on the top of the dried gray layer was added 0.6 μl of sample (∼5–10 pmol) in acetonitrile-water (9:1, v/v). A cleanly defined spot with white crystals on the top of the matrix-NC layer was formed, which produced very strong and stable signals upon laser irradiation. The glycosylamination reaction was carried as follows: 10 μl of each sample in 10% acetonitrile (around 10–20 pmol/μl) was added to 5 μl of 4% 3-aminoquinoline (3-AQ) in 80% methanol and 500 μl of glacial acetic acid. The solution was incubated at 70 °C for 30 min. Aliquots were directly taken for MALDI-MS analysis without additional treatment. Sample preparation was done by a two-layer application technique: (i) 0.5 μl of 1% ATT in 50% aqueous acetonitrile were deposited on the sample plate and allowed to dry, (ii) 2 μl of the reaction mixture was added to 1 μl of the ATT matrix solution and 0.5 μl of 0.5% aqueous fluorosilicic acid, (iii) 0.8 μl of the sample mixture was deposited on 0.5 μl of dried matrix. The fluorosilicic acid is used to promote the formation of protonated molecules. After drying, the light yellow mass was gently grounded with the sealed end of a melting point capillary tube to induce the viscous mass to crystallize into finely divided crystals for analysis of MALDI-MS. Using the timed ion selector, the precursor ion [M-H]+ at m/z 1579.6 (for peak 3) or [M-Na]+ at m/z 2079.5 (for peak 4) was selected for MALDI PSD analysis. The acceleration voltage was 22 kV. Mass units were ±1.5 of the calculated molecular masses. To analyze quantitatively the glycan moiety of the S. aureus cell wall, it was essential to have complete cleavage of the stem peptides by an amidase. A candidate for this procedure was the pneumococcal amidase, because recent observations indicate that this enzyme can hydrolyze teichoic acid-free peptidoglycans (17.Severin A. Horne D. Tomasz A. Microb. Drug Resist. 1997; 3: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Preliminary tests indicated that whereas the pneumococcal amidase was inert to intact S. aureus cell walls (data not shown), it was able to hydrolyze [3H]GlcNAc-labeled peptidoglycan of S. aureusstrains COL (methicillin-resistant) and 27s (methicillin-susceptible) although about 30% of the labeled material would still remain insoluble after three consecutive digestions. Because the S. aureus peptidoglycan has a much higher degree of cross-linking compared with the pneumococcal peptidoglycan (14.de Jonge B.L. Chang Y.S. Gage D. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11248-11254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Garcia-Bustos J.F. Chait B.T. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15400-15405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was conceivable that the incomplete hydrolysis was because of the secondary structure of S. aureus peptidoglycan, which blocked full access of the amidase to the peptidoglycan substrate. In an attempt to bypass this problem, peptidoglycan preparations were first digested with the endopeptidase lysostaphin to hydrolyze the oligoglycine bridges cross-linking the staphylococcal stem peptides. Sequential digestion of the S. aureus peptidoglycan with lysostaphin followed by the pneumococcal amidase allowed solubilization of >97% of [3H]GlcNAc-labeled peptidoglycan. The same results were obtained when using peptidoglycan labeled withl-[3H]lysine. At low pH (i.e.pH of 2) the N-acetyl-d-glucosamine andN-acetylmuramic acid components of the peptidoglycan are uncharged, whereas stem peptides are charged positively. Based on this principle, Harz et al. (1.Harz H. Burgdorf K. Holtje J.V. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 120-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) used an anion exchange column (MonoS column with SO3− as a functional group) to separate glycan strands from the stem peptides ofE. coli. Before adapting this method as a preparative procedure for the separation of S. aureus glycan strands, it was necessary to exclude the possibility that the amidase hydrolysis used in our procedure was incomplete in cleaving allN-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine bonds. Glycan fragments with attached stem peptides would remain positively charged, causing their loss to the stem peptide fraction, which is retained on the MonoS column. S. aureuspeptidoglycan from strains COL and 27s labeled with [3H]GlcNAc was doubly digested with lysostaphin and the amidase and separated with a MonoS column. 95% of the labeled material was eluted with the dead volume as expected for peptide-free glycan material. This was confirmed by the use of peptidoglycan labeled withl-[3H]lysine: after the double digestion, 99% of the l-[3H]lysine was retained in the MonoS column and eluted with the salt step. The 1% of labeled material unaccounted for would not interfere with the analysis of the glycan fraction. The 5% or less [3H]GlcNAc-labeled material retained on the anion exchange column was eluted with 1 m NaCl and analyzed by HPLC. This material eluted exclusively with the 30% acetonitrile step and was free of peptides as determined by [3H]lysine labeling. In another test, the 5% retained material was digested with mutanolysin to further confirm that no uncleaved muropeptides were present. Only disaccharides (GlcNAc-[β-1,4]-MurNAc), trisaccharides, tetrasaccharides, and free peptides were detected (data not shown), suggesting that this fraction of glycan strands was somehow physically trapped on the column by the stem peptides. The [3H]GlcNAc-labeled glycan material of the methicillin-resistant S. aureus strain COL was separated on a reverse-phase Nucleosil C18 column. Fig.1 illustrates the glycan pattern of COL detected by UV absorption and by flow scintillation analysis. The elution profiles of radioactive and UV absorbing peaks were identical. With the 30% acetonitrile step it was possible to quantitatively recover all glycan material injected into the HPLC system. The elution profile of staphylococcal glycan showed a “hedgehog” pattern composed of major peaks and minor satellite peaks that eluted either just before or shortly after the major glycan peaks from the HPLC column (Fig. 1) and that accompanied the major peaks throughout the entire elution profile. Resolution of peaks required prior reduction of the glycan material with sodium borohydride. Interestingly, the relative proportion of major peaks to the minor satellite peaks was reversed in the laboratory mutant CTX50 (19.Boneca I.G. Xu N. Gage D.A. de Jonge B.L. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29053-29059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 20.Tonin E. Tomasz A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1986; 30: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) selected for resistance to cefotaxime, as compared with their representation in the parental strain 27s (Fig. 2).Figure 2HPLC profiles of the glycan strands of the cefotaxime resistant laboratory mutant CTX50 and the parental strainS. aureus 27s (NCTC 8325).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify the structure of the major and minor components of the glycan spectrum, the complex HPLC elution pattern of the staphylococcal glycan was first simplified by in vitrotreatment of the glycan preparation with a muramidase. Fig.3 illustrates the HPLC analysis of glycan fragments generated from the glycan of strain COL after a short (2 h) as compared with prolonged (overnight) incubation with a muramidasein vitro. After a 2-h muramidase digestion, two major peaks (peak 1 and 2) were detectable with retention times of 11.6 and 22.0 min; two minor peaks were also present (peak 1b and 2a) with retention times of 13.4 and 20.7, respectively. After overnight in vitro digestion with muramidase, peak 2 was drastically reduced with a parallel increase in peak 1, although the amounts of peaks 1b and 2a did not change, indicating that these fragments were poor substrates for the muramidase. The shift in the relative amounts of peak 2 to peak 1 after prolonged digestion with the muramidase and the HPLC retention times of these two components suggest that the structures of peaks 1 and 2 are GlcNAc-(β-1,4)-MurNAc and (GlcNAc-[β-1,4]-MurNAc)2, respectively. The four peaks obtained after overnight digestion of the glycan from strain COL with muramidase were also analyzed by MALDI-MS. Peak 1 and peak 2 (HPLC retention times 11.6 and 22 min) had molecular masses expected for the disaccharide GlcNAc-(β-1,4)-MurNAc and its dimer (Table II), respectively, confirming conclusions already reached on the basis of HPLC analysis. The molecular masses of peaks 1b and 2a corresponded to the trisaccharides GlcNAc-(β-1,4)-MurNAc-(β-1,4)-GlcNAc and MurNAc-(β-1,4)-GlcNAc-(β-1,4)-MurNAc, respectively. The proposed structures of peaks 1b and 2a suggest the activity of a glucosaminidase.Table IIMALDI-MS analysis of the muramidase digestion products of the glycan strands after reductionReduced formsbTaking into account the molecular masses of H, Na, and K (m/z 1, 23, and 39, respectively) all the mass spectrometry signals are consistent with the calculated molecular masses.Methyl ester derivativescMethyl esterification of the glycan material adds a methyl group at the lactyl moiety of each MurNAc residue, increasing the mass by 14 Da/MurNAc present.

Open table in a new tab Matrixes previously used for oligosaccharides have turned out to be unsuccessful for the analysis of glycan material. 3N. Xu, Z.-H. Huang, and D. A. Gage, submitted for publication. However, after derivatization to the corresponding methyl esters, peaks could be obtained with standard CHCA as the matrix. Still better results were obtained using a new matrix ATT embedded in nitrocellulose, which produced strong signals and unambiguous molecular masses for individual peaks. This method was used for obtaining the MALDI-MS spectrum of the complete range of glycan strands of strain COL. Fig.4 shows a series of major peaks with molecular masses that fit the expected molecular mass of GlcNAc-(β-1,4)-MurNAc and its multimers. Consecutive peaks in the spectrum are separated by 492 Da, which represents the molecular mass of the methyl ester of a disaccharide (G-M) unit. MALDI-MS analysis allowed identification of glycan strands with a degree of polymerization of up to 12 disaccharide-repeating units (m/z5945, Table III). The fact that glycan strands with more than 12 disaccharide units were not detected is possibly because of their lower abundance (see Fig. 1) or to their reduced MALDI-MS response.Table IIIMALDI-MS analysis of methyl ester derivatives of individual glycan peaks purified from strains COL and CTX50Glycan peakaSee Fig. 1 for corresponding peaks nomenclature.[M + Na]+Proposed structureCalculated [M + Na]+21026(GlcNAc-(β-1,4)-MurNAc)210252b1228(GlcNAc-(β-1,4)-MurNAc)2-GlcNAc122831517 and 1720(GlcNAc-(β-1,4)-MurNAc)3 and (GlcNAc-(β-1,4)-MurNAc)3-GlcNAc1517 17203b1390 and 1594MurNAc-(GlcNAc-(β-1,4)-MurNAc)2bObserved as +77 adduct. and (MurNAc-(β-1,4)-GlcNAc)3bObserved as +77 adduct.1314 15174a2212(GlcNAc-(β1–4)-MurNAc)4-GlcNAc221242009(GlcNAc-(β1–4)-MurNAc)320094b2087(MurNAc-(β-1,4)-GlcNAc)3bObserved as +77 adduct.20094c1884MurNAc-(GlcNAc-(β-1,4)-MurNAc)3bObserved as +77 adduct.18065a2704(GlcNAc-(β-1,4)-MurNAc)5-GlcNAc270452502 and 2579(GlcNAc-(β-1,4)-MurNAc)5 and (MurNAc-(β-1,4)-GlcNAc)5bObserved as +77 adduct.25015b2374MurNAc-(GlcNAc-(β-1,4)-MurNAc)4bObserved as +77 adduct.229862"
https://openalex.org/W1576424039,"Monocyte influx secondary to ischemia-reperfusion conditions the renal allograft to rejection by presentation of antigens and production of cytokines. Monocyte influx depends on NFkappaB-dependent transcription of genes encoding adhesion molecules and chemokines. Here we demonstrate that cationic liposomes containing phosphorothioated oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) with the kappaB binding site serving as competitive binding decoy, can prevent TNF-alpha-induced NFkappaB activity in endothelial cells in vitro. In an allogenic rat kidney transplantation model (BN to LEW), we show that perfusing the renal allograft with this decoy prior to transplantation abolishes nuclear NFkappaB activity in vivo and inhibits VCAM-1 expression in the donor endothelium (P<0.05). At 24 h postreperfusion, periarterial infiltration of monocytes/macrophages was significantly reduced in decoy ODN-treated allografts compared to control allografts (3.7+/-0.7 vs. 9.2+/-1.2 macrophages/vessel; P<0.01). At 72 h, there was a reduction of tubulointerstitial macrophage infiltration in decoy ODN-treated kidneys compared to controls (75.6+/-13.9 vs. 120.0+/-11.2 macrophages/tubulointerstitial area; P<0.05). In conclusion, perfusion of the renal allograft with NFkappaB decoy ODN prior to transplantation decreases the initial inflammatory response in a stringent, nonimmunosuppressed allogenic transplantation model. Therefore, the NFkappaB decoy approach may be useful to explore the role of endothelium and macrophages in graft rejection and may be developed into a graft-specific immunosuppressive strategy allowing reduction of systemic immunosuppression on organ transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W1915442041,"Many aberrant or unassembled proteins synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are degraded by cytosolic proteasomes. To investigate how soluble glycoproteins destined for degradation are retrotranslocated across the ER membrane, we analyzed the fate of two IgM subunits, mu and J, retained in the ER by myeloma cells that do not synthesize light chains. Degradation of mu and J is prevented by proteasome inhibitors, suggesting that both chains are retrotranslocated to be disposed of by proteasomes. Indeed, when proteasomes are inhibited, some deglycosylated J chains that no longer contain intrachain disulfide bonds accumulate in the cytosol. However, abundant glycosylated J chains are still present in the ER at time points in which degradation would have been almost complete in the absence of proteasome inhibitors, suggesting that retrotranslocation and degradation are coupled events. This was confirmed by protease protection and cell fractionation assays, which revealed that virtually all mu chains are retained in the ER lumen in a glycosylated state when proteasomes are inhibited. Association with calnexin correlated with the failure of mu chains to dislocate to the cytosol. Taken together, these results suggest that active proteasomes are required for the extraction of Ig subunits from the ER, though the requirements for retrotranslocation may differ among individual substrates."

These enzymes are involved in several biological processes in higher animals, including digestion, proenzyme, prohormone, and complement activation, as well as participate in defense mechanisms (1.Neurath H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1986; 32: 35-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). All eukaryotic serine proteinases, most of which are digestive enzymes, are suggested to have originated from a single ancestral gene, and variants associated with other functions are thought to have arisen by gene duplication and mutations through evolution (2.Neurath H. Science. 1984; 224: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Serine proteinases are typically synthesized as zymogens or inactive proenzymes, which are then activated by a specific and limited proteolytic cleavage at a specific peptide bond (3.Furie B. Furie B.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 505-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). Upon activation of many serine proteinases, the noncatalytic N terminus remains linked to the catalytic C terminus via a disulfide bond. The N-terminal domain has been shown to be important in the activation of the protein and may play an essential role for the normal regulation of enzymatic activity (4.Smith C. Giordano H. DeLotto R. Genetics. 1994; 136: 1355-1365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several serine proteinase-inactive homologues have already been identified in vertebrates and invertebrates, and they have been suggested to have different biological functions: such as antimicrobial activities, e.g. human azurocidin (5.Almeida R.P. Melchior M. Campanelli D. Nathan C. Gabay J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 688-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and horseshoe crab factor D (6.Kawabata S. Tokunaga F. Kugi Y. Motoyama S. Miura Y. Hirata M. Iwanaga S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), as a growth factor, e.g. human hepatocyte growth factor (7.Nakamura T. Nishizawa T. Hagiya M. Seki T. Shimonishi M. Sugimura A. Tashiro K. Shimizu S. Nature. 1989; 342: 440-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar), an adhesion molecule, e.g. fruit fly glutactin (8.Barthalay Y. Hipeau-Jacquotte R. de la Escalera S. Jimenez F. Piovant M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3603-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), neurotactin (9.Olson P.F. Fessler L.I. Nelson R.E. Sterne R.E. Campbell A.G. Fessler J.H.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), or as an immune molecule, e.g. mosquito infection-responsive serine protease-like protein (ispl5) (11.Dimopoulos G. Richman A. Muller H.M. Kafatos F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11508-11513Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). These molecules show homology to serine proteinases except for the substitution(s) of the catalytic residues. The prophenoloxidase-activating system (proPO system), which carries out recognition and defense responses in invertebrates, is composed of an enzyme cascade consisting of several serine proteinases and prophenoloxidase, which is converted to an active enzyme following proteolytic cleavage (12.Söderhäll K. Cerenius L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). Several insect serine proteinases have been found to be involved in the activation of the proPO system (12.Söderhäll K. Cerenius L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar), as a trypsin-like serine proteinase in crayfish (13.Aspán A. Sturtevant J. Smith V.J. Söderhäll K. Insect Biochem. 1990; 20: 709-718Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To obtain information about genes encoding crayfish serine proteinases, we have isolated and analyzed putative serine proteinase genes from crayfish hemocytes. Among these we found several trypsin-like enzymes and a mas-like protein. We here describe the cloning, purification, and cell adhesion activity of this mas-like protein from hemocytes of the freshwater crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus. Freshwater crayfish, P. leniusculus, were purchased from Berga Kräftodling, Södermanland, Sweden and were maintained in tanks with aerated running water at 10 °C. Only intermolt crayfish were used in this study. Two degenerate oligonucleotides, 5′-TGGGTIGTIACIGCIGCICAYTG-3′ and 5′-ANIGGICCICCI(G/C)(T/A)NTCICC-3′ (where N is any nucleoside), were designed from the consensus amino acid sequences WVVTAAHC and GDSGGPL in serine proteinases. Either a hemocyte cDNA library (14.Johansson M.W. Keyser P. Söderhäll K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), 1 μl of 107 plaque-forming units/μl, or a hemocyte first-strand cDNA was used as DNA template for PCR in 50 μl of total volume containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 125 μm each dNTP (Perkin-Elmer), 4.6 μm each degenerate primer, and 1.5 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The PCR program was as follows: 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 45 °C, 1 min at 72 °C for 2 cycles; 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, 1 min at 72 °C for 28 cycles; and 7 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were subcloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript II KS(+) (Stratagene). The cDNA library from crayfish hemocytes was screened using the initial PCR products, which had been labeled with 32P by random priming using the Megaprime labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sequencing was performed in both directions by the dideoxy chain termination method using T7 sequencing mixes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cDNA sequence was analyzed with the MacVector 4.1.4 software (Eastman Kodak Co.). The deduced amino acid sequence was analyzed using the BLAST search program (National Center for Biotechnology International, Bethesda, MD). Total RNA was isolated from the hemocytes by the acid guanidinium method (15.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63144) Google Scholar). Poly(A+) mRNA was purified according to the protocol of the Poly(A)Ttract mRNA isolation system (Promega). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from the hemocyte poly(A+) mRNA using the first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA from hemocytes or hepatopancreas was run on a 1% agarose gel in the presence of formaldehyde (16.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning : A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.43-7.45Google Scholar) and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by capillary blotting overnight. For hybridization, 10 μCi of a 32P-labeled gene fragment was used in a hybridization solution containing 5× SSPE (20× SSPE is 3.6m NaCl, 0.2 m sodium phosphate, and 0.02m EDTA, pH 7.7), 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.1% (w/v) Ficoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 0.1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. The samples were hybridized overnight at 65 °C and then washed three times for 20 min with 0.2× SSPE and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. After drying, the filter was subjected to autoradiography. A synthetic peptide CFTPQDLRVRWVSGRSTS corresponding to a part of the “catalytic” domain of crayfish mas-like protein was synthesized and then coupled to ovalbumin (Sigma) using sulfo-MBS (m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide ester) (Calbiochem) as a coupling agent and used for production of a rabbit antiserum. The amount of peptide in each injection was 0.5 mg. Antibody was affinity-purified on a column containing the synthetic peptide coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Affinity-purified rabbit antibodies against peroxinectin have been described (17.Johansson M.W. Söderhäll K. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1795-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). As a control, affinity-purified rabbit antibodies against a human β1 integrin cytoplasmic peptide (18.Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1990; 60: 849-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar) were used. Hemocyte lysate supernatant (HLS) was prepared by collecting crayfish hemolymph (blood) in 10 mmsodium cacodylate, 0.1 m CaCl2, 0.25m sucrose, pH 7.0, followed by a centrifugation at 4 °C and 800 × g, and the cells were homogenized in 10 mm sodium cacodylate, 0.1 m CaCl2, pH 7.0; this preparation was called HLS1. Alternatively, anticoagulant (0.14 m NaCl, 0.1 m glucose, 26 mmcitric acid, 30 mm trisodium citrate, 10 mmEDTA, pH 4.6 (19.Smith V.J. Söderhäll K. Cell Tissue Res. 1983; 233: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar)) was used to collect the blood, and the cells were homogenized in 0.15 m NaCl and 2 mm EDTA to yield HLS2. HLS1 was added to an anti-mas-like protein antibody column (prepared by coupling 1.5 mg of affinity-purified antibodies to 0.5 ml of CNBr-Sepharose; the apparent coupling efficiency was 93%), previously equilibrated with TBS; the column was washed extensively with TBS, and the mas-like protein was eluted with 0.1 mglycine-HCl, pH 2.5, in 0.5-ml fractions, which were immediately neutralized with 0.1 volume of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Peroxinectin was isolated by cation exchange chromatography as described in Johansson and Söderhäll (17.Johansson M.W. Söderhäll K. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1795-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed in 10% polyacrylamide gels. Reduction was achieved by boiling the samples for 3 min in the presence of 5 mg/ml dithiothreitol. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. For immunoblotting, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose at 0.21 A for 70 min in 25 mmTris, 192 mm glycine. The filter was blocked for 1 h in TBS containing 3% BSA, incubated with 10 μg/ml affinity-purified crayfish anti-mas-like protein antibodies in TBS-3% BSA for 1 h, washed 3 × 10 min with TBS-0.1% Tween 20, then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) for 1 h, washed as before, washed for 3 × 10 min with TBS, and finally developed in a mixture of 20 ml of 0.03% H2O2 in TBS and 6 ml of 3 mg/ml 4-chloronaphthol in methanol. Cell adhesion was assayed essentially as described (17.Johansson M.W. Söderhäll K. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1795-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). All glassware was rendered pyrogen-free by incubation at 180 °C for 4 h. Glass coverslips (No 1.5, 22 × 22 mm, Chance Proper, Ltd., Warley, UK) were placed in Falcon 6-well tissue culture plates (Becton Dickinson and Co., Franklin Lakes, NJ) and coated with 100 μl of the sample to be tested at 20 °C for 1 h. After coating, the coverslips were washed with filter-sterilized and autoclaved water three times, dried at 40 °C, blocked with 100 μl of 1% BSA for 5 min, and finally washed and dried again as before. Negative control coverslips received only BSA. An isolated population of crayfish granular hemocytes was obtained by centrifugation in a density gradient of 70% Percoll in 0.15m NaCl as described (19.Smith V.J. Söderhäll K. Cell Tissue Res. 1983; 233: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar); this cell population consisted entirely of granular cells, and at least 90% of the cells were viable as judged by trypan blue exclusion. The cells were diluted 1:2 with 0.15 m NaCl, and the cell density of the diluted suspension was determined to generally be around 1.5 × 104cells/ml. The cells were added to the coverslips together with CaCl2 (final concentration 10 mm). Each coverslip was overlaid with a total volume of 200 μl. After incubation for 1 h at 20 °C, the coverslips were washed with crayfish saline (0.2 m NaCl, 5, 4 mm KCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 2.6 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm NaHCO3, pH 6.8) and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in crayfish saline, pH 6.8. The percentage of attached cells was assessed by counting the cells at 200× magnification in an inverted microscope, covering at least 10% of the area initially covered by the cell suspension. In one set of experiments, one volume of 6 μg/ml mas-like protein or one volume of 2 μg/ml peroxinectin was preincubated with one volume of 50 μg/ml affinity-purified antibody at 20 °C for 1 h, the mixture was clarified by centrifugation, and then the supernatant was used to coat the glass coverslips. The catalytic domain of serine proteinases contains a highly conserved region that has been successfully amplified by the PCR method from a variety of species and tissues. During screening for hemocyte serine proteinases using degenerate primers designed from the signature sequence around the His and Ser active-site region, four independent clones were obtained. The presence of the characteristic catalytic His, Asp, Ser residues in three of these clones (data not shown) suggests that they are members of the serine proteinase superfamily, but in one of the clones derived from a hemocyte first-strand cDNA, the catalytic serine residue was found to be replaced by a glycine. Three of the serine proteinase clones are similar to digestive trypsins, whereas the fourth is similar to Drosophila melanogaster mas (10.Murugasu-Oei B. Rodrigues V. Yang X. Chia W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), a secreted serine proteinase-like protein in which the catalytic serine residue is replaced by a glycine. To obtain a full-length clone, the cDNA clone, which was similar toD. melanogaster mas, was 32P-labeled and used to screen the crayfish hemocyte cDNA library. From several overlapping positive clones, a cDNA encompassing 3277 base pairs, which if the second methionine in the putative open reading frame is assigned as start codon, will give rise to a protein of 978 amino acid residues with a predicted mass of 98.8 kDa. The crayfish mas-like protein has two domains, an N-terminal domain and a catalytic domain. The hydrophobic first 17 amino acids of the N-terminal end of the protein is probably a signal peptide sequence with a putative signal peptidase cleavage site between Ala-17 and Ala-18 (20.Von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3692) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 a). Seven repeats of a putative disulfide-knotted motif and a region of seven repeats of a glycine-rich sequence are present in the N-terminal domain of the protein (Fig. 1 a). The catalytic domain, Ile-714 to Lys-978, is characteristic to the corresponding region in other serine proteinases (Fig. 1 b), and the presence of a glycine residue instead of a serine residue in the catalytic site was confirmed in two partially overlapping clones, indicating that this glycine residue is not a PCR artifact. In the 3′-untranslated region, a putative polyadenylation signal, AATAAA, occurs 13 base pairs upstream of the poly(A) tail. A putative cleavage site for proteolytic activation of this proenzyme occurs between Arg-713 and Ile-714, although this site does not contain the typical Ile-Val-Gly-Gly motif of serine proteinases. The Anopheles gambiae ispl5 (11.Dimopoulos G. Richman A. Muller H.M. Kafatos F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11508-11513Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) andTachypleus tridentatus factor D (6.Kawabata S. Tokunaga F. Kugi Y. Motoyama S. Miura Y. Hirata M. Iwanaga S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) also lack such a motif. The predicted molecular mass of the catalytic domain is 29.8 kDa. The alignment (Fig. 1 b) shows that this putative mas-like protein is similar to A. gambiae ispl5 (11.Dimopoulos G. Richman A. Muller H.M. Kafatos F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11508-11513Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) and factor D, factor B, and the proclotting enzyme of T. tridentatus (6.Kawabata S. Tokunaga F. Kugi Y. Motoyama S. Miura Y.

Chem. 1993; 268: 21384-21388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as D. melanogaster mas (10.Murugasu-Oei B. Rodrigues V. Yang X. Chia W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). If the N-terminal domain of the protein is included in the alignment, there is no significant homology seen. The residues lining the substrate binding pocket, which determines the substrate specificity of active serine proteinases, are present in crayfish mas-like protein and are typical for trypsin-like enzymes. The six cysteine residues, which may form three disulfide bridges in the crayfish mas-like protein, are conserved in most serine proteinases. A. gambiae ispl5, T. tridentatus factor D, and D. melanogaster mas also have amino acid substitutions in the active site of the molecules. A schematic comparison of the main structural features of crayfish mas-like protein with A. gambiae ispl5 and D. melanogaster mas (Fig. 1 c) shows a modified serine proteinase domain, several disulfide-knotted motifs present in the N-terminal domain, and a repeated glycine-rich region only present in crayfish mas-like protein. Northern blot analyses indicated that the crayfish mas-like protein mRNA was expressed in the hemocytes and not in the hepatopancreas, which is the major site for the production of digestive enzymes (data not shown). This mRNA is expressed in adult crayfish in contrast to the mRNA expression of D. melanogastermas, which is only detected during embryonic, larval, and pupal development but not in the adult. Immunoblotting of a hemocyte lysate supernatant with the affinity-purified antibodies against a synthetic peptide made adjacent to a sequence in the C-terminal serine proteinase-like domain showed a single band of 27 kDa (Fig. 2), likely a processed form of the mas-like protein. However, if the blood was collected in a citrate-EDTA anticoagulant and the blood cells were homogenized in the presence of EDTA, only one band of 150 kDa reacted with the antibodies (Fig. 2). This mass is higher than predicted from the open reading frame, i.e. 98.8 kDa, and it is therefore possible that other attached groups such as carbohydrates may contribute to the size as estimated from SDS-PAGE. The open reading frame contains two putative N-glycosylation sites. No mas-like protein was detected in the plasma (data not shown). The 27-kDa protein could be purified by immunoaffinity chromatography (Fig.3) using the anti-mas-like protein antibodies. It had approximately the same apparent molecular mass under both reducing and nonreducing conditions (data not shown). An estimated amount of 3 μg was obtained from 150 crayfish (corresponding to about 0.3 g of HLS). The N-terminal of the 27-kDa protein was determined by amino acid sequencing to be Ile-Lys-Asn-Asn-Asp-Leu-Leu-Tyr-Tyr-Gln-Thr-His-Phe-Ala-Glu corresponding to the amino acids 714–728 (see Fig. 1 b) in the putative open reading frame, indicating that this cDNA clone is authentic and that the 27-kDa protein is the C-terminal part of the mas-like protein. Despite repeated attempts, we could not isolate the 150-kDa protein from HLS2 using the immunoaffinity column.Figure 3SDS-PAGE analysis of immunoaffinity-purified mas-like protein from crayfish blood cells. SDS-PAGE of protein eluted from an anti-mas-like protein affinity column shows a single band of 27 kDa (see “Experimental Procedures”). Molecular mass markers are indicated to the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Granular blood cells from crayfish adhered to the purified 27-kDa mas-like protein at relatively low coating concentrations. Half-maximal adhesion was obtained at about 2 μg/ml (Fig. 4), and specific adhesion over control was achieved above 0.1 μg/ml. Cell adhesion to the mas-like protein was specifically inhibited by affinity-purified anti-mas-like protein antibodies (Fig. 5). The 76-kDa protein peroxinectin is the only protein supporting adhesion described previously from these cells (17.Johansson M.W. Söderhäll K. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1795-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 23.Johansson M.W. Lind M.I. Holmblad T. Thörnqvist P.-O. Söderhäll K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 1079-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar); in a parallel experiment with the same cell preparations, peroxinectin gave half-maximal adhesion at less than 0.3 μg/ml (Fig. 4). Affinity-purified anti-peroxinectin antibodies did not affect cell adhesion to the mas-like protein (Fig.5). Conversely, the anti-mas-like protein antibodies did not influence cell adhesion to peroxinectin (Fig. 6), whereas the anti-peroxinectin antibodies inhibited this adhesion (Fig.6 and Ref. 17.Johansson M.W. Söderhäll K. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1795-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results show that the crayfish mas-like protein and peroxinectin are two distinct adhesive molecules from these cells (and that there was no cross-contamination of the purified proteins). In a crude blood cell homogenate (in the presence of CaCl2 and after preincubation with β-1,3-glucans), both proteins were active, since the adhesion activity of this preparation could be partially inhibited by either the anti-mas-like protein or the anti-peroxinectin antibodies (data not shown). Binding of peroxinectin to cells can be detected by immunofluorescence. This binding was not affected by preincubation with the mas-like protein, indicating that the mas-like protein does not bind to the same cell membrane site as peroxinectin.Figure 5Specific inhibition of cell adhesion to the crayfish mas-like protein by affinity-purified anti-mas-like protein antibodies. Isolated crayfish granular blood cells were added to glass coverslips previously coated with a mixture of the mas-like protein (final concentration 3 μg/ml) and affinity-purified anti-mas-like protein antibodies (ab) (anti-mas), anti-peroxinectin antibodies (anti-pxn), or control antibodies (ctrl ab) (final antibody concentration 25 μg/ml) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The experiment was performed three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Specific inhibition of cell adhesion to peroxinectin by affinity-purified anti-peroxinectin antibodies.Isolated crayfish granular blood cells were added to glass coverslips previously coated with a mixture of peroxinectin (final concentration 1 μg/ml) and affinity-purified anti-mas-like protein antibodies (ab) (anti-mas), anti-peroxinectin antibodies (anti-pxn), or control antibodies (ctrl ab) (final concentration 25 μg/ml) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The experiment was performed three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Crayfish mas-like protein is unlikely to possess enzyme activity because of a substitution of an essential active serine residue, but it shares common structural features with the catalytic domains of serine proteinases, suggesting that the protein can adopt a similar conformation as that of normal serine proteinases.

The modified proteinase domain lacking enzymatic activity has been suggested to mediate protein-protein interactions or to act as an antagonist molecule of serine proteinases to regulate and control their enzymatic activity (10.Murugasu-Oei B. Rodrigues V. Yang X. Chia W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). As suggested to be the case in several arthropod serine proteinases, the disulfide-knotted motif within the N-terminal domain may play a role in regulating the processing of a proenzyme to the active enzyme (26.Gay N.J. Keith F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1132: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus the knot has been suggested as a recognition site for the activation of the proenzyme. Seven repeats of a putative disulfide-knotted motif are present in the N-terminal domain of the crayfish mas-like protein. In these motifs six cysteine residues assigned to form three intramolecular disulfide bonds in the T. tridentatus proclotting enzyme (21.Muta T. Hashimoto R. Miyata T. Nishimura H. Toh Y. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22426-22433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are conserved in crayfish mas-like protein and in other arthropod serine proteinase proproteins including T. tridentatus factor B (22.Muta T. Oda T. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21384-21388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), D. melanogaster easter, stubbled-stubbloid gene, mas (10.Murugasu-Oei B. Rodrigues V. Yang X.

A. 1997; 94: 11508-11513Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) (Fig.7 a). The sequence of the disulfide-knotted motif also shows similarity to that of T. tridentatus big defensin (29.Saito T. Kawabata S. Shigenaga T. Takayenoki Y. Cho J. Nakajima H. Hirata M. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7 a), an antibacterial protein, suggesting that this motif may act as an antimicrobial substance perhaps after being released upon zymogen activation (30.Muta T. Iwanaga S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The biological significance of the presence of several copies of this motif in D. melanogaster mas (5 copies),A. gambiae ispl5 (2 copies), and crayfish mas-like protein (7 copies) is, however, unknown, but they may have an additional role beyond participating in the activation of a zymogen. The repeated region has 7 repeats of a 31-amino acid sequence that contains a high number of glycine residues (Fig. 7 b). No significant similarity to these repeats was found; however, it is worth noticing that repeats of several amino acids, principally serine and threonine, occur in the N-terminal domain of T. tridentatusproclotting protein as well as that of Drosophila mas, easter, and stubbled-stubbloid gene. The role of the repeated glycine-rich region of mas-like protein clearly needs to be studied. The affinity-purified antibodies recognize only one protein in the hemocyte lysate supernatant, indicating that the cloned cDNA corresponds to the protein recognized by antibodies. The presence of a 27-kDa band in HLS1 and a 150-kDa band in HLS2 by immunoblot analyses suggests that the proenzyme is cleaved into a detectable polypeptide of 27 kDa and, as many other serine proteinases, is activated by processing. The proprotein may be protected from proteolytic cleavage in the HLS2 preparation, since components of the proPO system,e.g. proteinases, are active in HLS1 in contrast to those in HLS2 that contains EDTA. The 27-kDa protein, recognized by the affinity-purified antibodies against a synthetic peptide positioned in the C-terminal domain, is similar to the estimated mass of the C-terminal domain, 29.8 kDa, indicating that the serine proteinase domain is released upon cleavage of the proprotein, possibly by a trypsin-like activity produced upon activation of the proPO system. The affinity-purified protein from HLS1 also has a mass of 27 kDa. The purified 27-kDa protein could support adhesion of crayfish granular hemocytes in a dose-dependent manner. This cell adhesion could be specifically inhibited by affinity-purified anti-mas-like protein antibodies but not by anti-peroxinectin antibodies. This shows that these two crayfish cell adhesion molecules, the mas-like protein and peroxinectin, are distinct. Using immunofluorescence, no binding of the 27-kDa mas-like protein to fixed suspended cells could be detected. This may, however, not be entirely surprising, since binding of soluble adhesive ligands to suspended cells via adhesion receptors, is usually of low affinity and difficult to detect, despite the fact that these receptors, by clustering, mediate high avidity adhesion to immobilized substrata (31.Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2923) Google Scholar, 32.Tangemann K. Engel J. Eble J.E. Kühn K. Integrin-Ligand Interaction. R. G.

Biosci. 1997; 2: 126-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In contrast, the other studied cell adhesion protein from crayfish blood cells, peroxinectin (17.Johansson M.W. Söderhäll K. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1795-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 23.Johansson M.W. Lind M.I. Holmblad T. Thörnqvist P.-O. Söderhäll K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 1079-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) can be detected to bind to suspended cells by the use of immunofluorescence (34.Johansson M.W. Holmblad T. Thörnqvist P.-O. Cammarata M. Parrinello N. Söderhäll K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 917-925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The peroxinectin binds to the suspended cells through a cell-surface superoxide dismutase (34.Johansson M.W. Holmblad T. Thörnqvist P.-O. Cammarata M. Parrinello N. Söderhäll K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 917-925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is unlikely that that the mas-like protein interacts with the dismutase since preincubation of the suspended cells with mas-like protein had no effect on the binding of peroxinectin to them. The peroxinectin-mediated adhesion of the blood cells was suggested to involve an integrin receptor that may bind the peroxinectin directly through its putative integrin binding sequence, KGD (23.Johansson M.W. Lind M.I. Holmblad T. Thörnqvist P.-O. Söderhäll K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 1079-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Indirect support for this idea comes from the recent finding that human myeloperoxidase, a homologue of peroxinectin, mediates cell adhesion via the αMβ2 integrin (35.Johansson M.W. Patarroyo M. Oberg F. Siegbahn A. Nilsson K. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1133-1139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, another KGD site present in the dismutase may mediate binding of the peroxinectin-dismutase complex to an integrin receptor of the adhesive blood cell. Recently, an integrin, which is one candidate receptor for binding peroxinectin or the peroxinectin-dismutase complex, was isolated from crayfish blood cells, and its β subunit was identified and cloned (36.Holmblad T. Thörnqvist P.-O. Söderhäll K. Johansson M.W. J. Exp. Zool. 1997; 277: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Catalytically inactive serine proteinase-like domains may function as integrin ligands in both invertebrates and vertebrates. In humans, azurocidin and haptoglobin, in which the catalytic serine is replaced with other amino acids, have been reported to bind the αMβ2 integrin (37.Cai T.-Q. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1213-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 38.El Ghmati S.M. van Hoeyveld E.M. van Strijp J.A.G. Ceuppens J.L. Stevens E.A.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2542-2552PubMed Google Scholar). However, these proteins have not yet been shown to promote cell adhesion. The serine proteinase-like domain in the C-terminal part of masquerade, which has been demonstrated to be present at muscle attachment sites (10.Murugasu-Oei B. Rodrigues V. Yang X. Chia W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), may directly mediate cell adhesion by binding a muscle cell receptor. The mechanism for the interaction between the crayfish mas-like protein and blood cells is unknown; the findings reported here suggest, however, that the modified catalytic domain of this protein mediates cell adhesion.

Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) generates an electrochemical gradient across plant cell plasma membrane that provides the driving force for secondary active transport and for cell turgor maintenance. A number of central physiological processes, such as stomata opening, phloem loading, or root ion uptake, depend on regulation of H+-ATPase activity. Despite a large body of evidence indicating that different stimuli, like hormones or light and stresses regulate these processes by affecting H+-ATPase activity, up to now very little is known about molecular mechanisms controlling H+-ATPase activity. It was demonstrated that the C-terminal region of the enzyme is an autoinhibitory domain. In fact, proteolytic removal of this region (3.Palmgren M.G. Sommarin M. Serrano R. Larsson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20470-20475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or heterologous expression of a C-terminal truncated enzyme results in an increase of H+-ATPase activity (4.Regenberg B. Villalba J.M. Lanfermeijer F.C. Palmgren M.G. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1655-1666PubMed Google Scholar). It was suggested, on the basis of similarity of biochemical parameters of activation, that H+-ATPase stimulators such as lysophosphatidylcholine or the toxin from Fusicoccum amygdali, fusicoccin (FC),1 act through C-terminal domain displacement (5.Rasi-Caldogno S. Pugliarello M.C. Olivari C. De Michelis M.I. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 6.Johansson F. Sommarin M. Larsson C.

Prins H.B.A. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 1277-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), which therefore could represent a common mechanism for different proton pump effectors. It was also originally proposed that FC did not bind directly to the H+-ATPase but rather to receptors located at the plasma membrane. A search for FC receptors led to their identification as members of the 14-3-3 eukaryotic protein family (8.Marra M. Fullone M.R. Fogliano V. Masi S. Mattei M. Pen J. Aducci P.

This discovery shed some light on the FC mechanism of H+-ATPase activation. In fact it was clearly shown by different authors that FC is able to promote the association of 14-3-3 proteins with the C-terminal domain of the H+-ATPase (11.Jahn T. Fuglsang A.T. Olsson A.

Palmgren M.G. Plant J. 1998; 13: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). These lines of evidence indicate that the FC receptor is made up of a complex between 14-3-3 and H+-ATPase and suggest that association of 14-3-3 proteins with the proton pump could represent a mechanism regulating the proton pump under physiological conditions. It is a common property of 14-3-3 proteins that they have the capability to associate with target proteins through binding to consensus motifs containing phosphorylated residues (15.Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar, 16.Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H.

Recently it was shown that a similar mechanism holds true also for plant 14-3-3 association with plant enzymes such as nitrate reductase (17.Bachmann M. Huber J.L. Athwal G.S. Wu K. Ferl R.J. Huber S.C FEBS Lett. 1996; 38: 26-30Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 18.Moorhead G. Douglas P. Morrice N. Scarabel M. Aitken A. MacKintosh C.

Plant J. 1999; 18: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Because it is known that H+-ATPase is a phosphorylated enzyme in vivo(21.Schaller G.E. Sussman M.R. Planta. 1988; 173: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 22.Xing T. Higgings V.J. Blumwald E. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 23.Olsson A. Svennelid F. Ek B. Sommarin M. Larsson C. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanism, by endogenous protein kinases and phosphatases, may regulate the association of 14-3-3 with the H+-ATPase. In the present study in vivo and in vitro data are reported demonstrating that 14-3-3 proteins are able to associate with the H+-ATPase in a FC-independent manner and that the interaction depends on the phosphorylation status of the proton pump. We also demonstrate that a protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) from maize roots affects the association of 14-3-3 proteins with the H+-ATPase. FC was prepared according to Ballio et al. (24.Ballio A. Carilli A. Santurbano B. Tuttobello L. Ann. Ist. Super. Sanità. 1968; 4: 317-332PubMed Google Scholar). Okadaic acid, microcystin-LR, and anti-PP2A antibodies were purchased from Calbiochem, (La Jolla, CA). [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 110 TBq/mmol) and thrombin were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Alkaline phosphatase, from calf intestine, was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Protein kinase A, catalytic subunit, and myelin basic protein (from bovine brain) were from Sigma. Chemicals for gel electrophoresis were from Bio-Rad. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Maize seeds (Zea mays L. cv. Paolo) from Dekalb (Mestre, Italy) were germinated and grown in the dark for 6 days, as already described (25.Marra M. Ballio A. Fullone M.R. Aducci P. Plant Physiol. 1992; 98: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Maize roots (8 g) were cut into small pieces (approximately 5 mm) and incubated in 20 ml of 20 mm Tris-Mes (pH 7.0), containing 300 mm sucrose, for 1 h at room temperature. When indicated, 1 μm okadaic acid (OA) and 10 μm FC were added. Two-phase partitioned plasma membranes were obtained from 200 g of maize roots as described previously (26.Marra M. Fogliano V. Zambardi A. Fullone M.R. Nasta D. Aducci P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). When indicated, plasma membranes were treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 (26.Marra M. Fogliano V. Zambardi A. Fullone M.R. Nasta D. Aducci P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For the purification of H+-ATPase, plasma membrane proteins were solubilized with dodecyl-β-d-maltoside as described by Johansson et al. (27.Johansson F. Sommarin M. Larsson C. Physiol Plant. 1994; 92: 389-396Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and fractionated by anion exchange HPLC (26.Marra M. Fogliano V. Zambardi A. Fullone M.R. Nasta D. Aducci P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). 2 μg of HPLC-purified plasma membrane H+-ATPase were incubated with 4 units of alkaline phosphatase in 100 μl of 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.5) buffer containing 100 μm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μmleupeptin, 5 μm chymostatin, and 5 μmpepstatin, for 30 min at 37 °C. Treated H+-ATPase was then used in the overlay assay (13.Fullone M.R. Visconti S. Marra M. Fogliano V. Aducci P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7698-7702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The cytosolic fraction obtained from the purification of H+-ATPase (supernatant from the 50,000 × gcentrifugation) was used as starting material. Cytosol was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 20 mm Tris-Mes (pH 7.0) and loaded onto a DEAE-biogel (Bio-Rad) column (100 × 20 mm) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-Mes (pH 6.5) containing 1 mm DTT and 1 mm PMSF (buffer A). Elution was performed in 40 min by a linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 mNaCl in buffer A, at a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min. Fractions of 2 ml were collected and tested for the ability to abolish the interaction between HPLC-purified H+-ATPase and 14-3-3 in an in vitro overlay assay (13.Fullone M.R. Visconti S. Marra M. Fogliano V. Aducci P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7698-7702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Active fractions were pooled, dialyzed, and concentrated to 3 ml in a Sartorius collodion bag (cut-off, 12 kDa) and loaded onto a DEAE TSK-5-PW HPLC (Bio-Rad) column (75 × 7.5 mm), equilibrated at 0.5 ml/min with 20 mmhistidine-HCl buffer (pH 6.5) containing 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF. Elution was performed in 40 min, by a linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 m NaCl, in the same buffer. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, active fractions were pooled, and aliquots of 200 μl were loaded onto a Bio-sil TSK-250 (Bio-Rad) HPLC gel filtration column (300 × 7.5 mm), equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-Mes buffer (pH 7.0), containing 150 mmNaCl and 0.5 mm DTT, at 1.0 ml/min flow rate. Active fractions were collected and used for the biochemical characterization of protein phosphatase activity. To identify protein phosphatase activities able to act on H+-ATPase, a functional assay was set up by testing the ability of chromatographic fractions to inhibit H+-ATPase/14-3-3 association. 2 μg of HPLC-purified plasma membrane H+-ATPase were incubated with 1 μg of each fraction in 50 mm Tris-Mes (pH 7.0), containing 10 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm EGTA (free calcium about 100 μm), 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μmleupeptin, 5 μm chymostatin, 5 μmpepstatin, for 30 min at room temperature. Treated H+-ATPase was then used in the overlay assay (13.Fullone M.R. Visconti S. Marra M. Fogliano V. Aducci P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7698-7702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Specificity of protein phosphatase was assessed incubating samples under the same conditions, but in the presence of 2 μm OA and 2 μm microcystin-LR (MC). The cDNA of the 14-3-3 isoform GF14-6 from maize was cloned into pGEX-2TK and expressed in Escherichia coli, as described previously (13.Fullone M.R. Visconti S. Marra M. Fogliano V. Aducci P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7698-7702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The expression system produces a glutathione S-transferase-fused 14-3-3 containing a cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site and a thrombin site between the two polypeptides. The radiolabeled GF14-6 was obtained as described by Fullone et al. (13.Fullone M.R. Visconti S. Marra M. Fogliano V. Aducci P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7698-7702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The specific activity of 32P-labeled 14-3-3 was 3.3 MBq/mg. The overlay assay was carried out according to Fullone et al. (13.Fullone M.R. Visconti S. Marra M. Fogliano V. Aducci P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7698-7702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, two-phase partitioned plasma membranes (10 μg protein) or HPLC-fractionated H+-ATPase (2 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% fatty acid-free milk in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% fatty acid-free milk and the32P-labeled GF14-6 (8.3 kBq/ml) overnight at 4 °C. After incubation, the membrane was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, dried, and subjected to autoradiography at −80 °C. The relative amount of bound 14-3-3 proteins was estimated from overlay assays by densitometry using Scion Image software from Scion Corporation. Protein phosphatase activity was estimated using 32P-labeled myelin basic protein (MBP) as substrate. 32P-MBP was prepared by incubation of 1 mg of MBP in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 12 mm MgCl2 with 10 units of protein kinase A (catalytic subunit) and 80 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 200 μm ATP in a final volume of 250 μl. After 30 min at 30 °C, 250 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid was added, and the mixture was centrifuged for 2 min in a Öle-Dich microcentrifuge at 5000 × g. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was solubilized in 250 μl of H2O and trichloroacetic acid precipitation was repeated eight times. Finally the pellet was dried under reduced pressure and solubilized in 250 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0). The specific activity of the32P-labeled MBP was 1 MBq/mg. The phosphatase assay mixture (50 μl) contained 50 mmTris-Mes (pH 7.0), 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μm leupeptin, 5 μm chymostatin, 5 μm pepstatin, 5 μg of 32P-labeled MBP, and 1 μg of purified protein phosphatase. When indicated, 10 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm EGTA (100 μm free Ca2+) or various concentrations of OA and MC were added. After a 20-min incubation, an equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid was added, and the mixture was centrifuged for 2 min at 5000 ×g. The radioactivity of 50-μl aliquots of the supernatant was measured with a Wallac 1410 β-counter. SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laëmmli (28.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), in a Mini Protean apparatus (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using a semidry LKB apparatus (2 h, 0.8 mA cm−2). Immunodecoration of 14-3-3 and H+-ATPase was performed according to Marra et al. (26.Marra M. Fogliano V. Zambardi A. Fullone M.R. Nasta D. Aducci P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), using the ECL detection system from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, following the manufacturer's instructions. Immunodetection of protein phosphatase was carried out using antibodies recognizing the catalytic subunit of mammalian PP2A (Calbiochem) and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (29.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. H+-ATPase activity was assayed according to Serrano (30.Serrano R. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 157: 533-544Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The H+-ATPase was solubilized and partially purified by anion exchange HPLC from maize roots previously incubated in the presence or in the absence of 10 μm FC (26.Marra M. Fogliano V. Zambardi A. Fullone M.R. Nasta D. Aducci P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The partially purified H+-ATPase (2 μg) from FC-treated and control tissue were run on 10% SDS-PAGE, blotted on nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with 32P-labeled 14-3-3, both in the absence and in the presence of 10 μm FC in the incubation mixture. Results shown in Fig. 1 Ademonstrate that 14-3-3 proteins associate with H+-ATPase in the absence of FC and that in vivo preincubation of the tissue with FC increases the interaction with the proton pump; the extent of the increase was 40%, as estimated by densitometric analysis. In Fig. 1 B, the effect of in vitroincubation of FC on the interaction between 14-3-3 proteins and H+-ATPase from FC-treated and from untreated tissue is shown. It is worth noting that FC in vitro administration strongly enhances the interaction not only between 14-3-3 and H+-ATPase purified from control tissue but remarkably (42%, by densitometric analysis) also with the H+-ATPase purified from FC-treated tissue. These results demonstrate that 14-3-3 proteins are able to interact with the H+-ATPase also in a FC-independent manner and indicate that in vivo FC treatment affects the capability of the proton pump to associate in vitro with 14-3-3 proteins, suggesting that the phosphorylation status of the purified H+-ATPase may be involved. OA, a strong protein phosphatase inhibitor, was administered in vivo to maize roots to ascertain whether the phosphorylation status of H+-ATPase influences the association with 14-3-3 proteins and consequently H+-ATPase phosphohydrolytic activity. Maize roots segments were incubated with 1 μm OA or 10 μm FC or both. After incubation, plasma membranes were isolated, the activity of the H+-ATPase was tested, and the amount of plasma membrane-associated 14-3-3 was estimated by Western blotting analysis. Results are shown in Fig.2. OA induces a slight (about 20%) but reproducible stimulation of H+-ATPase phosphohydrolytic activity (Fig. 2 A); under the same conditions FC brings about a much stronger stimulation (116%), whereas incubation with OA+FC provoked the highest stimulation (245%). The stimulatory effect was much more evident after treatment of isolated plasma membranes with 0.5% Triton X-100. In particular the effect of OA increased to 146%, that of FC to 375%, and that of OA+FC to 884%. Remarkably, Western blot analysis showed that stimulation of H+-ATPase was correlated with amounts of 14-3-3 associated with plasma membranes (Fig. 2 B). As shown in Fig. 2B (panel b), Triton X-100 was able to selectively remove 14-3-3 proteins from plasma membranes. In fact 14-3-3 proteins were almost completely undetectable in control membranes, whereas their levels were progressively less reduced in OA, FC, and OA+FC samples, indicating that a tighter association was induced by in vivo treatment with FC, as expected, and interestingly also by OA. These results indicate that phosphorylation of H+-ATPase is a prerequisite for stimulatory 14-3-3 association in the absence of FC. To verify whether the phosphorylation status of the H+-ATPase modulates the association with 14-3-3 proteins, the proton pump was subjected to a dephosphorylating treatment with alkaline phosphatase and tested for the ability to bind32P-radiolabeled 14-3-3 protein in an overlay assay (13.Fullone M.R. Visconti S. Marra M. Fogliano V. Aducci P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7698-7702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Results showed in Fig. 3 Aclearly demonstrate that dephosphorylated proton pump is almost unable to bind 14-3-3 proteins; addition of FC in vitro partially restored the interaction (Fig. 3 B). Results obtained with alkaline phosphatase prompted us to investigate whether protein phosphatase activities able to modulate binding of 14-3-3 to H+-ATPase were present in maize roots. To this purpose, cytosol from maize roots was fractionated by anion exchange DEAE-biogel chromatography followed by DEAE and gel filtration HPLC purification (Fig.4 A). Fractions were directly tested for their ability to inhibit the association between H+-ATPase and 14-3-3 proteins in the overlay assay. Specificity of the protein phosphatase activity was evaluated by assaying fractions also in the presence of 1 μm OA and 1 μm MC. Relative amounts of bound 14-3-3 were estimated by densitometric analysis. In Fig. 4 B the effect of the HPLC size exclusion-purified fraction on the interaction between H+-ATPase and 14-3-3 proteins in the overlay assay is shown: protein phosphatase treatment of the H+-ATPase nearly completely inhibited binding of 14-3-3 proteins. OA addition (1 μm) in the incubation mixture restored the interaction. Interestingly, protein phosphatase treatment drastically reduced also the FC-dependent interaction between H+-ATPase and 14-3-3 proteins. Biochemical and immunological analysis allowed us to ascertain that a protein phosphatase activity with properties typical of the PP2A family was present in fractions able to inhibit the H+-ATPase/14-3-3 interaction. The characterization of the partially purified protein phosphatase (size exclusion fraction) was carried out using 32P-MBP as substrate. Specific activity and yield of each chromatographic step are shown in TableI.Table IPurification of protein phosphatase from maize rootsFractionProteinTotal activitySpecific activityPurificationmgpmol dephosphorylated MBP · min −1pmol dephosphorylated MBP · min −1 · mg −1foldCytosol320.03040.09.51DEAE-biogel13.2310.223.52.5HPLC DEAE TSK-5-PW0.4237.8594.462.5HPLC Bio-sil TSK 2500.02532.21288.8135.6 Open table in a new tab Protein phosphatase activity was completely independent of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions in concentrations ranging from 1 μm to 1 mm (data not shown), whereas it was drastically affected (Fig.5 A) by OA (IC50 = 0.9 nm) and MC (IC50 = 0.6 nm), in accordance with data reported for PP2A (31.Smith R.D. Walker J., C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 101-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). A further confirmation was provided by Western blotting analysis using antibodies raised against a conserved sequence of the catalytic domain of mammalian PP2A. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the antibodies recognized a single polypeptide of approximately 37 kDa, the same molecular mass reported for the catalytic subunit of plant PP2A (31.Smith R.D. Walker J., C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 101-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Results from recent research have contributed much progress to the understanding of the mechanism of H+-ATPase stimulation by the phytotoxin FC. In fact it was clearly demonstrated by different authors that FC promotes the irreversible association of stimulatory 14-3-3 proteins with the H+-ATPase. Because an ever-increasing body of evidence points to 14-3-3 proteins as general regulators of key enzymes in the plant cell (32.Chung H-J Sehnke P.C. Ferl R.J. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 367-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), results from FC research also suggest that 14-3-3 proteins may be involved in the regulation of H+-ATPase under physiological conditions. In fact, different pieces of evidence (11.Jahn T. Fuglsang A.T. Olsson A. Bruntrup I.M. Collinge D.B. Volkmann D. Sommarin M. Palmgren M.G. Larsson C. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1805-1814PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Fullone M.R. Visconti S. Marra M. Fogliano V. Aducci P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7698-7702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) suggest that 14-3-3 proteins can also interact with the proton pump in a FC-independent manner. Although the molecular basis of the FC-independent interaction between H+-ATPase and 14-3-3 proteins is still unknown, phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events on the H+-ATPase are likely, because a common feature of 14-3-3 association with target proteins involves the interaction with consensus sequences containing a phosphorylated amino acid (15.Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar, 16.Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). This work was aimed at ascertaining whether a similar mechanism can account for the interaction between 14-3-3 proteins and H+-ATPase. To this purpose, the ability of H+-ATPase to associate in vitro with 14-3-3 proteins after in vivo treatments able to alter its phosphorylation status was investigated. Data reported here show thatin vivo incubation of maize roots with OA provoked a significant increase of the plasma membrane-bound 14-3-3 proteins, as well as a strong stimulation of H+-ATPase activity. These results strongly suggest that phosphorylation of H+-ATPase is essential for its binding to 14-3-3 proteins and concomitant stimulation. We also demonstrated that FC in vivo incubation of maize roots, a treatment resulting in an increase of membrane-bound 14-3-3 and stimulation of H+-ATPase activity, was able to increase the in vitro interaction of H+-ATPase with 14-3-3 proteins. Also this finding is suggestive of the occurrence of a post-translational modification on the proton pump, influencing its capability to interact with 14-3-3 proteins. Interestingly, Olssonet al. (23.Olsson A. Svennelid F. Ek B. Sommarin M. Larsson C. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) demonstrated that in vivo FC treatment protects from dephosphorylation a phosphothreonine residue (Thr-948 in the Arabidopsis isoform AHA1) located in the very end of the C-terminal domain of the H+-ATPase. It was hypothesized that the effect is due to direct binding of 14-3-3 to the phosphorylated threonine or alternatively to a 14-3-3-induced conformational change protecting the amino acid from dephosphorylation. Our results indicate that the phosphothreonine residue may be physically involved in the binding of 14-3-3 proteins, being part, as proposed by Olsson at al. (23.Olsson A. Svennelid F. Ek B. Sommarin M. Larsson C. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), of a novel consensus sequence regulating the physiological association of 14-3-3 proteins with the H+-ATPase. Furthermore, in vivo data indicate that the phosphorylation status of the H+-ATPase is relevant also for the FC-dependent binding of 14-3-3 protein; in fact, the H+-ATPase purified from in vivo FC or OA-treated roots bound 14-3-3 protein more efficiently also in the presence of FC. This latter result is also worth noting, because results obtained up to now point instead to different, independent mechanisms for phosphorylation and FC-mediated binding of 14-3-3 proteins to the H+-ATPase (13.Fullone M.R. Visconti S. Marra M. Fogliano V. Aducci P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7698-7702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14.Baunsgaard L. Fuglsang A.T. Jahn T. Korthout H.A.A.J. de Boer A.H. Palmgren M.G. Plant J. 1998; 13: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). A further demonstration of the relevance of phosphorylation as a regulatory mechanism was provided by in vitrodephosphorylation treatments of the proton pump; in fact, incubation of the H+-ATPase with commercially available alkaline phosphatase and more remarkably with a PP2A partially purified from maize roots, completely abolished the interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. Notably, this treatment was also able to impair the FC-dependent association of 14-3-3 proteins. In fact, FCin vitro addition only partially restored the association of 14-3-3 proteins with the proton pump. In conclusion, our data, taken together, unequivocally demonstrate that the interaction between 14-3-3 proteins and H+-ATPase is dependent on the phosphorylation status of the enzyme; moreover, they also indicate that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events, mediated by a still unidentified protein kinase and possibly a PP2A, very likely represent the basis for the physiological 14-3-3-mediated regulation of H+-ATPase. In addition, our data raise the question as to how FC promotes the association of 14-3-3 proteins with the H+-ATPase. In fact, whereas it was proposed that FC can act by a mechanism able to replace the phosphorylation requirements of the H+-ATPase (13.Fullone M.R. Visconti S. Marra M. Fogliano V. Aducci P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7698-7702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14.Baunsgaard L. Fuglsang A.T. Jahn T. Korthout H.A.A.J. de Boer A.H. Palmgren M.G. Plant J. 1998; 13: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), our data indicate that the phosphorylation status of the H+-ATPase can influence also the FC-dependent 14-3-3 association with the proton pump and consequently that FC does not merely mimic the phosphorylation effect but rather acts through a more complex mechanism."

This was demonstrated by inhibiting the loss in clonogenicity of TS− cells by anti-FasL and in enhanced survival of TS− clones selected for resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis, following dThd deprivation. During thymineless stress in TS− cells, Fas ligand (FasL) is expressed, and its promoter (hFasLPr) is activated. Transactivation of hFasLPr, dependent upon dThd deficiency, was inhibited following mutation of the binding sites for NF-κB or AP-1 and by preventing NF-κB or AP-1 activation, which inhibited expression of FasL and enhanced clonogenic survival in stable transformants expressing IκBαM or DN-MEKK, respectively. These results demonstrate the crucial roles for NF-κB and AP-1 in the regulation of FasL in Fas-mediated thymineless death of colon carcinoma cells.

We have selected a human colon carcinoma cell line deficient in thymidylate synthase (TS) that allows events downstream of dTTP depletion and DNA damage to be addressed in an unambiguous manner. In our previous studies we found that inhibition of FasL binding prevented apoptosis and preserved clonogenicity in these cells when deprived of dThd, and we demonstrated the critical role of the Fas (CD95, APO-1) death receptor in the induction of cell death induced by thymineless stress (1.Houghton J.A.

Similarly, in Jurkat T leukemia cells, apoptosis induced by certain chemotherapeutic drugs depends upon the expression of FasL (2.Friesen C. Herr I. Krammer P.H. Debatin K.-M. Nat.

However, signals involved in DNA damage recognition and the ultimate signaling pathway(s) leading to activation of FasL and induction of apoptosis in TS−cells via the Fas death receptor remain to be elucidated. The response of cells to cytotoxic stress and DNA damage may depend upon the cell type, together with the type and extent of DNA damage.

In this study we determined that NF-κB and AP-1 are involved downstream of DNA damage in TS− cells in the transcriptional regulation ofFASL in Fas-mediated thymineless death of colon carcinoma cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that both of these transcription factors were activated following treatment of colon carcinoma cells with FUra/LV, which correlated with up-regulated expression of FasL in these cells. A TS− mutant clone selected from parental GC3/c1 human colon carcinoma cells, which is deficient in TS mRNA and protein and auxotrophic for dThd, has been well characterized (1.Houghton J.A.

The relationship between up-regulated expression of FasL and induction of thymineless death has been described (1.Houghton J.A. Harwood F.G. Tillman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8144-8149Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Furthermore, up-regulated expression of FasL in GC3/c1 cells in response to FUra/LV (1.Houghton J.A. Harwood F.G. Tillman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8144-8149Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and the induction of thymineless death and apoptosis (13.Houghton J.A. Tillman D.M. Harwood F.G. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 723-730PubMed Google Scholar) have also been reported. TS− cells were selected for resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis by treatment with the cytolytic anti-Fas mAb CH-11 (MBL International Corp.). Cells (100 × 106) were mutagenized with EMS (300 μg/ml) in T-175 flasks for 22 h. Cells were cultured for a further 48 h in the absence of EMS and subsequently selected for 72 h in 200 ng/ml CH-11. Following growth for a further 7 days in the absence of CH-11, surviving cells were again mutagenized with EMS and selected in CH-11 (200 ng/ml) for a second time. Surviving colonies were allowed to grow for 2 weeks and were subsequently ring-cloned, placed in T-12.5 flasks in 2 ml of dFBS-containing medium with dThd (20 μm), and the colonies were expanded. Three colonies were selected for further evaluation. TS− cells were plated at a density of 3,000 cells/well in 6-well plates (Falcon). Cells were also treated with anti-FasL (NOK-1 mAb; PharMingen; 100 ng/ml) or a mouse IgG1 isotype-matched control mAb (PharMingen; 100 ng/ml) at the time of plating. Following overnight attachment, cells were washed with 2 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution (at 37 °C) and subsequently deprived of dThd by refeeding with dThd-free medium containing the respective Abs. At various times for up to 7 days, cells were rescued with dThd (20 μm) added to individual wells, and clonogenic survival was determined 11 days after dThd restoration (1.Houghton J.A. Harwood F.G. Tillman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8144-8149Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Alternatively, TS− cells and CH-11-resistant clones were plated as described above and following overnight attachment were treated with CH-11 (200 ng/ml) for 72 h in the presence of dThd (20 μm), followed 11 days later by analysis of clonogenic survival. Production and use of reporter constructs involving the 5′ promoter region for FasL have been reported (3.Kasibhatla S. Brunner T. Genestier L. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Briefly, an approximately 8-kilobase HindIII fragment containing the 5′ promoter region from a genomic clone of humanFASL was subcloned into a eukaryotic expression vector HsLuc carrying a luciferase reporter gene downstream of the cloned fragment to generate the wild-type reporter construct for FasL, hFasLPr. By using PCR, truncations of the FASL promoter region were obtained and subcloned into the HsLuc vector 5′ of the luciferase reporter gene. Mutations were introduced into the binding domains of NF-κB and AP-1 within the FASL promoter region using the Gene Editor kit (Promega) or the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH) and subsequently sequenced, as reported (3.Kasibhatla S.

This generated hFasLPr/NF-κB and hFasLPr/AP-1, respectively. Conditional expression vectors for IκBαM(16.Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 26396-26401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) luciferase reporter constructs were as previously reported. To control for transfection efficiency, pSV-βgal was obtained from Promega. To determine the optimal time for examination of transactivation of the wild-type FasL reporter construct, hFasLPr, following dThd withdrawal, TS− cells were plated, in triplicate, at a density of 5 × 106 cells in T-75 flasks (Costar) in folate-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% dFBS, 80 nm5-methyltetrahydrofolate, and 20 μm dThd. After overnight attachment, cells were washed in 5 ml of serum-free Opti-MEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and transfected simultaneously with hFasLPr (10 μg) and pSV-βgal (5 μg) in the presence of LipofectAMINE (30 μg; Life Technologies, Inc.) in Opti-MEM medium (10 ml) containing 20 μm dThd, for 18 h. After a subsequent wash in Opti-MEM medium (5 ml), cells were returned to folate-free RPMI 1640 containing 10% dFBS and 80 nm 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, either in the absence or in the presence of dThd (20 μm). Cells were harvested by trypsinization at time 0, 48, and 72 h, washed twice in PBS, and subsequently stored at −80 °C prior to assay for luciferase or β-galactosidase activities. To elucidate whether NF-κB or AP-1 were activated under conditions of thymineless stress, 2xκB-luc (10 μg) or TRE-luc (10 μg) were transfected with pSV-βgal (5 μg) for 18 h and subsequently exposed for 48 h to thymineless or dThd-replete conditions prior to harvest. In addition, activation of NF-κB or AP-1 was similarly examined following transient transfection of 2xκB-luc or TRE-luc and pSV-βgal in GC3/c1 cells for 18 h and treatment with FUra (1 μm), LV (1 μm) for 48 h either in the absence or in the presence of dThd (20 μm). To elucidate the influence of mutations within the proven binding domains of either NF-κB or AP-1 on transactivation of hFasLPr, TS− cells were transfected with hFasLPr/NF-κB (10 μg) or hFasLPr/AP-1 (10 μg) simultaneously with pSV-βgal (5 μg) for 18 h, as described above. Cells were harvested at time 0 and at 48 h following exposure to thymineless or dThd-replete conditions. For studies to determine the influence of IκBαM or DN-MEKK on transactivation of hFasLPr, TS− cells were co-transfected for 18 h with hFasLPr (5 μg), pSV-βgalactosidase (5 μg), and varied quantities of IκBαM (0–5 μg) or DN-MEKK (0–5 μg) in the presence of the empty vector HsLucEV (0–5 μg) to standardize the DNA concentration. Following transfection, cells were exposed for 48 h either in the absence or presence of dThd (20 μm) and subsequently harvested as described above. To assay for luciferase activity, cell pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (Promega), and 40 μl was subsequently assayed for luciferase activity using the Promega luciferase assay system, according to the manufacturer's directions. pSV-βgal activity was assayed as reported previously (15.Harwood F.G. Frazier M.W. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Houghton J.A. Oncogene. 1996; 72: 2057-2067Google Scholar). Luciferase/β-galactosidase ratios were subsequently calculated to correct for any differences in transfection efficiencies (15.Harwood F.G. Frazier M.W. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Houghton J.A. Oncogene. 1996; 72: 2057-2067Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared, and DNA binding reactions were carried out for 30 min at room temperature in a buffer containing 80 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm EDTA, 400 mm KCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 45% glycerol, 10 μg of nuclear extract,33P-labeled probe (90,000 cpm), and 1 μg of poly(dI·dC). The probes used were double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides representing NF-κB and AP-1 sites from the human FASL promoter, as described previously (3.Kasibhatla S. Brunner T. Genestier L. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and [γ-33P]ATP (2,500 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Unlabeled radionucleotide was removed from labeled strands using a Qiaquick nucleotide removal kit, and samples were analyzed on a 5% nondenaturing TBE gel in 0.5% TBE. Vectors for the constitutive expression of IκBαM (16.Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2449) Google Scholar) and DN-MEKK (19.Westwick J. Weitzel C. Minden A. Karin M. Brenner B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26396-26401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were as described previously. TS− cells were plated at a density of 10 × 106 cells/T75 flask in NUNC peel-top flasks and transfected overnight (18 h) under serum-free conditions in DMEM with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). IκBαM or DN-MEKK were cotransfected at a concentration of 20 μg of pCIneo (5 μg). Cells were subsequently washed with Hanks' and fed with RPMI 1640 containing 20% dFBS + dThd (20 μm), 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (80 nm). Following 72 h of growth, fresh media containing 75 μg/ml G418 were added. At increments of 72 h, the G418 concentration was increased to 150 μg/ml and then to 300 μg/ml. Surviving colonies were allowed to grow for 2 weeks, ring-cloned, and then placed in T12.5 flasks in 2 ml of media containing 300 μg/ml G418. Two clones were used for subsequent studies. FasL expression was determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR as described previously (1.Houghton J.A. Harwood F.G. Tillman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8144-8149Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). TS− cells and clones stably transfected with IκBαM or DN-MEKK were plated at a density of 400,000 cells/well in 6-well plates. Following overnight attachment, dThd was withdrawn for periods up to 96 h. Both the floating cells and attached cells were pooled following trypsinization, fixed in 70% ethanol, and stored at −20 °C prior to analysis. Apoptotic cells were detected as a sub-G1 fraction following propidium iodide staining and analysis using a Becton Dickinson FACScan. To demonstrate the crucial role of the Fas death receptor in the regulation of thymineless death, TS− cells were treated with anti-FasL (NOK-1 mAb) or an IgG1 isotype-matched control, and the effect on clonogenic survival was determined. By blocking Fas/FasL interactions, 100% clonogenic survival was maintained at 5 days, in contrast to <5% in untreated or IgG1-treated cells (Fig.1). Furthermore, TS− clones selected for resistance to CH-11 and hence Fas-mediated apoptosis were also examined for their sensitivity to the induction of thymineless death following dThd deprivation (Fig. 1). In Fas-resistant clones, >80% survival was maintained under conditions of thymineless stress. Transactivation of the wt reporter constructs for NF-κB (2xκB-luc) or AP-1 (TRE-luc) were determined following their transient transfection simultaneously with pSV-βgal at 48 h in dThd-depleted or dThd-replete conditions (Fig. 2). This time had been predetermined to allow maximal transactivation of hFasLPr under thymineless conditions, when the expression of FasL was first detectable (data not shown). Both 2xκB-luc and TRE-luc reporters were activated, dependent upon thymineless stress, whereas minimal luciferase activity was detected when cells were cultured in the presence of dThd. The dThd dependence of hFasLPr transactivation was examined in TS− cells at 48 h following transfection (Fig.3 A). In the absence of dThd, there was significant activation of hFasLPr, whereas in the presence of dThd, virtually no transactivation was observed. To determine whether NF-κB may play a direct role in the up-regulated expression of FasL, hFasLPr/NF-κB, containing a mutation in the NF-κB-binding site, was co-transfected with pSV-βgal, and the activation of this reporter was examined at 48 h following dThd withdrawal (Fig. 3 B). Under these conditions a significant reduction in luciferase activity and of the luciferase/β-galactosidase ratio was demonstrated, resulting in a >10-fold reduction in transactivation of the reporter. Similarly, following transfection of hFasLPr/AP-1, transactivation of this reporter was inhibited by >16-fold (Fig. 3 C). These data were confirmed by EMSA. As demonstrated in Fig.4 A, the induction of thymineless stress resulted in rapid activation of NF-κB binding activity at 48 h that was competed out by increasing concentrations of unlabeled oligonucleotide. Similarly, withdrawal of dThd significantly enhanced AP-1 binding activity under these conditions (Fig. 4 B). To explore further the role of NF-κB and AP-1 in the direct activation of FasL in TS− cells in response to thymineless stress, cells were transiently co-transfected with IκBαM that effectively blocks activation of NF-κB, or DN-MEKK that effectively inhibits JNK activity and subsequently the activation of AP-1, at different concentrations of DNA, and the influence on transactivation of hFasLPr was examined (Fig.5). Both IκBαM (Fig. 5 A) and DN-MEKK (Fig. 5 B) induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the luciferase/β-galactosidase ratio.Figure 4EMSA demonstrating activation of NF-κB and AP-1 binding activity 48 h after the initiation of thymineless stress.

The influence of IκBαM or DN-MEKK on transactivation of hFasLPr was determined 48 h after culture of the cells either in the absence or presence of dThd (20 μm). Cells were co-transfected for 18 h with HFasLPr, pSV-βgal, and varied quantities of IκBαM, DN-MEKK, or the empty vector HsLucEV as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data represent the mean ± S.D. of three determinations for each condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To elucidate the influence of IκBαM or DN-MEKK on the survival of TS− cells and the expression of FasL under conditions of thymineless stress, stable clones expressing both inhibitors were isolated. Both clones expressing IκBαM demonstrated enhanced clonogenic survival compared with the pCIneo control and TS− cells following dThd deprivation (Fig.6 A). Similarly, under conditions of thymineless stress, inhibition of the activation of AP-1 by DN-MEKK enhanced the clonogenic survival of TS− cells (Fig. 6 B). Furthermore, inhibition of the activation of both NF-κB and AP-1 also delayed the activation of FasL following dThd deprivation (Fig. 7). In these clones, the induction of apoptosis was also reduced by 10–20% determined at 24 and 72 h following dThd deprivation (Fig.8). At 96 h, levels of apoptosis were similar between control and transfected clones, correlating with the delayed but up-regulated expression of FasL at this time.Figure 7Delayed expression of FasL in stable transfectants expressing IκBαM and DN-MEKK. Expression of FasL was determined by RT-PCR (35 cycles) following dThd deprivation in TS−, TS−pCIneo, and two clones each stably expressing IκBαM or DN-MEKK. β-Actin (25 cycles) expression was analyzed as a control. Data were derived according to the procedures described previously (5.Boland M.P. Foster S.J. O'Neill L.A.J. J. Biol.

Harwood F.G. Tillman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8144-8149Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In this study, the effect of FUra/LV treatment of GC3/c1 cells on activation of wt reporter constructs for both NF-κB and AP-1 was also determined following transient transfection. Data demonstrated that 48 h after the initiation of FUra/LV exposure, both wt reporter constructs were activated in response to the induction of thymineless stress (Fig. 9), similar to activation obtained in TS− cells following dThd deprivation. We demonstrated previously in TS− cells that thymineless stress-induced apoptosis correlated with up-regulated expression of FasL, first detected at 48 h after the initiation of dThd withdrawal and further elevated for up to 120 h (1.Houghton J.A. Harwood F.G. Tillman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8144-8149Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The crucial role of the Fas death receptor in the regulation of thymineless death has been demonstrated in two separate experiments. The first, which involved the blocking of Fas/FasL interactions using anti-FasL, completely prevented cell death induced by dThd deprivation, thereby allowing 100% cell survival in contrast to <5% in the absence of the inhibitory Ab. Second, the selection of TS− clones resistant to CH-11-induced and hence Fas-mediated apoptosis were also resistant to the induction of thymineless death under conditions of thymineless stress. If NF-κB and AP-1 are involved in the transcriptional regulation of FasL, then their expression should be up-regulated in response to thymineless stress in TS− cells. This was found to be the case. Furthermore, mutations in the binding sites of NF-κB and AP-1 in hFasLPr, or transient co-transfection of IκBαM or DN-MEKK to inhibit the activation of NF-κB and AP-1, respectively, resulted in inhibition of the transcriptional activation of hFasLPr under conditions of thymineless stress. EMSA analyses further confirmed these data, demonstrating rapid activation of both NF-κB and AP-1 binding activities, dependent upon dThd deprivation. Taken together, the data demonstrated direct transcriptional regulation of FASL by both NF-κB and AP-1 under conditions of thymineless stress and are similar to data derived in Jurkat T cells (3.Kasibhatla S. Brunner T. Genestier L. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Here, Kasibhatlaet al. (3.Kasibhatla S.

In addition, apoptosis induced by these agents was inhibited by the chimeric protein Fas-Fc, demonstrating that transcriptional activation of FasL was involved in the mechanism of apoptosis induction.

Reports have also indicated that activation of NF-κB has an antiapoptotic function with regard to both tumor necrosis factor-α- and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis including VP-16 and CPT-11 (16.Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2449) Google Scholar, 20.Wang C.-Y. Cusack J.C. Liu R. Baldwin A.S. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 21.Wang C.-Y. Guttridge D.C. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5923-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NF-κB can function as both a proapoptotic or antiapoptotic regulatory factor within a single cell type, dependent upon the stimulus (22.Lin B. Williams-Skipp C. Tao Y. Schleicher M.S. Cano L.L. Duke R.C. Scheinman R.I. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 570-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus ionomycin activated NF-κB, which up-regulated FasL expression and induced apoptosis. In contrast, inhibition of NF-κB conferred a 10-fold increase in glucocorticoid-mediated apoptosis. These results may be explained by the function of different genes under the regulation of NF-κB. Thus, DNA-damaging agents or stress stimuli that signal via Fas appear dependent upon transactivation of FASL by NF-κB for the induction of apoptosis. In cells in which NF-κB was inactive, activation of TRAF1, TRAF2, and the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 were all required to suppress tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis, whereas c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 were sufficient to suppress VP-16-induced apoptosis (23.Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2580) Google Scholar). NF-κB has also induced expression of the Bcl-2 homologue A1/Bfl-1 to suppress VP-16-induced apoptosis by inhibiting the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and subsequent caspase-3 activation (21.Wang C.-Y. Guttridge D.C. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5923-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Thus, in signaling thymineless death via Fas, NF-κB has a proapoptotic role in colon carcinoma cells. VP-16 (3.Kasibhatla S. Brunner T. Genestier L. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar), VM-26 (3.Kasibhatla S. Brunner T. Genestier L. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol.

Further implication for the involvement of AP-1 in the induction of apoptosis comes from studies of the involvement of the JNK/SAPK in apoptosis induction. The JNK, members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, phosphorylate the stimulatory sites of c-Jun (11.Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar), and it is well established that AP-1 is induced via activation of the JNK/SAPK pathway (18.Rosette C. Karin M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and that activation of JNK by cytotoxic drugs can lead to apoptosis (24.Faris M. Kokot N. Latinis K. Kasibhatla S. Green D.R. Koretzky G.A. Nel A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 134-144PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Sanchez-Perez I. Murguia J.R. Perona R. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 533-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, the pathways responsible for NF-κB activation are considerably less clear and may or may not involve the JNK/SAPK pathway (3.Kasibhatla S. Brunner T. Genestier L. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 26.Liu Z.-G. Baskaran C. Lee-Choe E.T. Wood L.D. Chen Y. Karin M. Wang J.Y.J. Nature. 1996; 384: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Certain reports have linked these signaling events induced by DNA-damaging drugs to Fas signaling and hence Fas-dependent apoptosis (2.Friesen C. Herr I. Krammer P.H. Debatin K.-M. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 574-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar, 3.Kasibhatla S. Brunner T. Genestier L. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). In other systems, the association is less clear, and NF-κB activation can also act independently of the cytotoxic function of Fas (27.Ponton A. Clement M.-V. Staenkovic I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8991-8995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, in Jurkat T leukemia cells, VP-16- and VM-26-induced apoptosis involved activation of JNK/SAPK, NF-κB, and AP-1, and apoptosis was inhibited by Fas-Fc, suggesting that Fas signaling pathways are involved in the induction of apoptosis by these agents (3.Kasibhatla S. Brunner T. Genestier L. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Also in the Jurkat cell line, expression of DA-MEKK induced apoptosis, prolonged JNK activation, and enhanced FasL mRNA expression and FasL promoter activation, and inhibition of Fas/FasL interactions by Fas-Fc prevented DA-MEKK-induced apoptosis (24.Faris M. Kokot N. Latinis K. Kasibhatla S. Green D.R. Koretzky G.A. Nel A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 134-144PubMed Google Scholar). Of interest was that treatment with ionizing radiation or anisomycin also produced these effects, although inhibition of Fas/FasL interactions inhibited anisomycin- but not radiation-induced apoptosis, suggesting that not all stress stimuli involving DNA damage use the same cell death pathway (24.Faris M. Kokot N. Latinis K. Kasibhatla S. Green D.R. Koretzky G.A. Nel A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 134-144PubMed Google Scholar). However in TS− cells, data demonstrate that NF-κB and AP-1 are both activated in thymineless stress-induced signaling in TS−cells and transcriptionally regulate FasL in Fas-dependent thymineless death of these cells. Furthermore, stable expression of either IκBαM or DN-MEKK delayed the loss in clonogenic survival, reduced the percentages of cells undergoing apoptosis, and up-regulated expression of FasL in response to thymineless stress. We demonstrated previously that activation of FasL occurs during thymineless death induced in wt GC3/c1 human colon carcinoma cells following treatment with FUra combined with LV to induce a thymineless state (1.Houghton J.A. Harwood F.G. Tillman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8144-8149Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), temporally correlating with the induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a Fas-dependent component exists in FUra/LV-induced cell death in colon carcinoma cells (28.Tillman D.M. Petak I. Houghton J.A. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 5: 425-430Google Scholar). We have now demonstrated in this study that transcriptional regulation of FASL by NF-κB and AP-1 also occurs in GC3/c1 cells following treatment with FUra/LV, similar to the regulation that occurs in TS−cells following dThd deprivation. Therefore, when DNA damage-induced apoptosis is mediated via Fas, NF-κB and in addition AP-1 may play important roles in the regulation of FasL and the induction of cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1918267618,"Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) is a universal second messenger that regulates many calcium-related cellular events by releasing calcium from intracellular stores. Since these events include enhanced cell proliferation and since the bone marrow harbors both ectoenzymes that generate cADPR from NAD+ (CD38 and BST-1), we investigated the effects of extracellular cADPR on human hemopoietic progenitors (HP). Exposure of HP to 100 μM cADPR for 24 h induced a significant increase in colony output (P<0.01) and colony size (P<0.003). A horizontal expansion of HP, as demonstrated by a markedly increased replating efficiency in semisolid medium (up to 700 times compared to controls), was also observed, indicating that cADPR priming can affect cell growth for multiple generations over several weeks after exposure. Influx of extracellular cADPR into the cells was demonstrated, and a causal relationship between the functional effects and the increase of intracellular free calcium concentration induced by cADPR on HP was established through the use of specific antagonists. Similar effects on HP were produced by nanomolar concentrations of the nonhydrolyzable cADPR analog 3-deaza-cADPR. These data demonstrate that extracellular cADPR behaves as a cytokine enhancing the proliferation of human HP, a finding that may have biomedical applications for the ex vivo expansion of hemopoietic cells.—Podestà, M., Zocchi, E., Pitto, A., Usai, C., Franco, L., Bruzzone, S., Guida, L., Bacigalupo, A., Scadden, D.

https://openalex.org/W2022712405,"Oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) may be of critical importance in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Recent studies suggest that oxidized phospholipids render LDL atherogenic. However, both the structures and the physiologically relevant pathways for the formation of modified phospholipids in oxidized LDL remain poorly understood. We previously showed that p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (pHA) is the major product of l-tyrosine oxidation by the myeloperoxidase/hydrogen peroxide/chloride system of phagocytes. In the current studies, we demonstrate that this reactive aldehyde targets the aminophospholipids of LDL in vitro and in vivo. Activated human neutrophils generated pHA-ethanolamine, the reduced adduct of pHA with the amino group of phosphatidylethanolamine, on LDL phospholipids by a reaction that required myeloperoxidase, H2O2, andl-tyrosine. The cellular system could be replaced by HOCl and l-tyrosine but not by a wide variety of other oxidation systems, indicating that pHA-ethanolamine is a specific marker for covalent modification of aminophospholipids by myeloperoxidase. To determine whether aldehydes modify aminophospholipids in vivo, we quantified levels ofpHA-ethanolamine in acid hydrolysates of reduced lipid extracts through isotope dilution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Circulating LDL contained undetectable levels ofpHA-modified phospholipid (<0.1 mmol/mol). In contrast, the concentration of pHA-ethanolamine in LDL isolated from human atherosclerotic lesions was strikingly elevated (4.5 mmol/mol). Collectively, these results demonstrate a novel, myeloperoxidase-based mechanism for modifying the amino group of LDL phospholipids. They also offer the first evidence that myeloperoxidase may damage LDL lipidsin vivo, raising the possibility that aldehyde-modified aminophospholipids play a role in inflammation and vascular disease.

Many lines of evidence suggest, however, that LDL must be oxidatively modified to trigger atherosclerotic vascular disease (reviewed in Refs. 2.Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Clin.

One potentially important class of reactions that render LDL atherogenic involves aldehydes, which are generated through decomposition of peroxidized lipids (2.Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Clin.

Unregulated internalization of modified LDL by these receptors may play a key role in foam cell formation, the cellular hallmark of atherosclerosis. Because reactive aldehydes are implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic vascular disease (2.Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Clin.

Model proteins derivatized with arachidonic oxidation products exhibit a marked increase in uptake and degradation by macrophage scavenger receptors (9.Steinbrecher U.P. Lougheed M. Kwan W.C. Dirks M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15216-15223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the protein moiety of oxidized LDL competes effectively for the degradation of oxidized LDL by macrophages (17.Parthasarathy S. Fong L.G. Otero D. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunohistochemical methods have detected malondialdehyde-modified proteins in human and animal atherosclerotic lesions (18.Haberland M.E. Cheng L. Fong D.

The possible role of lipid modification in rendering LDL atherogenic has received much less attention. Oxidized phospholipids derived from arachidonic acid promote monocyte adhesion to endothelium in vitro, and mass spectrometric studies have detected these molecules in atherosclerotic lesions (5.Berliner J.A.

These observations suggest that oxidized phospholipids may play a role in monocyte recruitment into the artery wall.

Chem. 1990; 265: 5226-5231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrate that emulsions of lipids prepared from copper-oxidized LDL exhibit saturable binding to macrophages and compete with oxidized LDL for recognition by macrophage scavenger receptors (22.Terpstra V. Bird D. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1806-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Lipids extracted from oxidized LDL, but not from circulating LDL, also block the binding and phagocytosis of oxidized red blood cells by macrophages (22.Terpstra V. Bird D. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1806-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Moreover, monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to epitopes on oxidized phospholipids block the uptake and degradation of oxidized LDL by mouse peritoneal macrophages (23.Horkko S. Bird D.A.

These observations have led to the proposal that modification of the lipid moieties is involved in recognition of copper-oxidized LDL by scavenger receptors (21.Nishikawa K. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol.

In the current studies, we examine the ability of myeloperoxidase to covalently modify aminophospholipids of LDL. One potential target is the polar head group of phosphatidylethanolamine, NH2CH2CH2OH, which contains a free primary amine. We show that the reduced Schiff base product,pHA-ethanolamine, is an acid-stable, specific marker for the reaction between pHA and phosphatidylethanolamine and that it is abundant in LDL isolated from human atherosclerotic tissue. Our results suggest that myeloperoxidase modifies LDL in vivoand raise the possibility that these novel, aldehyde-modified aminophospholipids play a role in atherogenesis and other inflammatory diseases.

Hanks' balanced salt solution (magnesium-, calcium-, phenol- and bicarbonate-free; Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 100 μm DTPA was used for neutrophil isolation and experiments. Circulating LDL (d 1.019–1.065 g/ml) was isolated by sequential density ultracentrifugation from plasma of healthy male and female subjects supplemented with 10 mmNaBH3CN (40.Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. Gaut J.P. Crowley J.R. Heinecke J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 88-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Lesion LDL was isolated from aortic tissue obtained at autopsy (40.Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. Gaut J.P. Crowley J.R. Heinecke J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 88-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In brief, atherosclerotic intima (∼1 g) from fatty streaks and intermediate lesions prepared from a single aorta were pulverized in liquid N2. Subsequent procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Tissue powder was suspended in antioxidant buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 300 μm EDTA, 100 μm DTPA, 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 100 μm butylated hydroxytoluene, 10 mm 3-aminotriazole, pH 7.4) containing 10 mm NaBH3CN and gently rocked end-over-end overnight. Control experiments demonstrated that this concentration of 3-aminotriazole completely inhibits the generation of pHA by myeloperoxidase, H2O2, andl-tyrosine. The suspension was centrifuged at 5000 ×g for 15 min, and the supernatant was dialyzed against antioxidant buffer. LDL (d 1.019–1.065 g/ml) was isolated by sequential density ultracentrifugation, dialyzed against antioxidant buffer, and stored at −80 °C until analysis. Ethanolamine (10 mm) was incubated with 1.8 mm pHA or [13C6]pHA in 20 mmsodium phosphate (pH 7) for 2 h at 37 °C in a shaking water bath and then reduced by incubation overnight with 10 mmNaBH3CN (41.Hazen S.L. Heller J. Hsu F.-F. d'Avignon A. Heinecke J.W. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). pHA-ethanolamine (4-(2-((2-hydroxyethyl)amino)ethyl)phenol) was isolated by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and its concentration was determined using tyrosine as a standard (41.Hazen S.L. Heller J. Hsu F.-F. d'Avignon A. Heinecke J.W. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Schiff base adducts were reduced by incubation with 10 mm NaBH3CN for 2 h at 37 °C. Total LDL lipids were extracted with CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O or water-washed diethyl ether/CH3OH/H2O (7:4:1, v/v/v) (41.Hazen S.L. Heller J. Hsu F.-F. d'Avignon A. Heinecke J.W. Chem. Res.

Ed., Elsevier, AmsterdamGoogle Scholar). Lipids and internal standards ([13C6]pHA-ethanolamine and [13C2]ethanolamine) were dried under N2 in a 4-ml hydrolysis tube. Following the addition of 1 ml of 2 n HCl supplemented with 0.1% phenol, the samples were hydrolyzed under argon gas by heating at 125 °C for 6 h. The samples were subjected to solid-phase extraction on a C18 column (Supelclean LC-18 SPE, 3 ml; Supelco Co.). Columns were activated with methanol and equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Ethanolamine was eluted by washing the column with 2 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. pHA-ethanolamine was eluted with 2 ml of 10% CH3OH in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Samples were evaporated to dryness under either vacuum or anhydrous N2and stored at −20 °C until derivatization. Recovery of authentic [13C6]ethanolamine and [13C6]pHA-ethanolamine subjected to extraction, hydrolysis, and solid phase column purification was >90% (41.Hazen S.L. Heller J. Hsu F.-F. d'Avignon A. Heinecke J.W. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Heptafluorobutyryl (HFB) derivatives or pentafluoropropionyl derivatives of pHA-ethanolamine were prepared by adding 100 μl of heptafluorobutyric acid anhydride/ethyl acetate (1:3, v/v) or pentafluoropropionic acid anhydride/ethyl acetate (1:3, v/v) and heating at 65 °C for 10 min. An aliquot (2 μl) was then injected into the gas chromatography system with a 20:1 split. DerivatizedpHA-ethanolamine and ethanolamine were quantified by isotope dilution GC/MS using selected ion monitoring in the negative-ion electron capture mode with methane as reagent gas (43.Heinecke J.W. Hsu F.F. Crowley J.R. Hazen S.L. Leeuwenburgh C. Mueller D.M. Rasmussen J.E. Turk J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 124-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The gas chromatograph was a Hewlett Packard 5890 (Palo Alto, CA) equipped with a DB-17 column (30 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter, 0.25 μm phenylmethyl silicone film coating; P. J. Cobert, St. Louis, MO). Both the injector and transfer line temperatures were 250 °C. The gas chromatograph oven was maintained at 100 °C for the first 3 min after the injection and was then increased at a rate of 40 °C/min to a final temperature of 280 °C. Mass spectra were acquired on a Hewlett Packard 5988A mass spectrometer. The emission current was 300 μA, the electron energy was 240 eV, and the source temperature was 150 °C. The HFB derivatives of pHA-ethanolamine and [13C6]pHA-ethanolamine were monitored using the molecular ions (M−) atm/z 769 and 775. The n-propyl, HFB derivatives of ethanolamine and [13C2]ethanolamine were monitored using the ions (M − HF)− at m/z 443 and 445. Quantification was based on an external calibration curve. The limit of detection (signal/noise >5) was <0.1 pmol for both compounds. In vitro studies demonstrate that syntheticpHA covalently modifies the ethanolamine moiety of synthetic glycerophospholipids and red blood cell membranes (41.Hazen S.L. Heller J. Hsu F.-F. d'Avignon A. Heinecke J.W. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The reaction generates a Schiff base between the lipid's primary amino group and the carbonyl group of pHA. The structure of the reduced Schiff base adduct was established through 1H NMR and mass spectrometric analyses (41.Hazen S.L. Heller J. Hsu F.-F. d'Avignon A. Heinecke J.W. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Adduct formation can be quantified by reducing the Schiff base with NaBH3CN, extracting the lipids, releasing the polar head group by acid hydrolysis, and subjecting the HFB derivative of the head group to isotope dilution negative-ion electron capture GC/MS (SchemeFS1). This experimental approach offers an important advantage; because the molecular weight of the head group is independent of the fatty acid composition of the aminophospholipid, we can use mass spectrometry to detect and quantify all molecular species of pHA-phosphatidylethanolamine. We used human neutrophils, a well characterized source of H2O2 and myeloperoxidase, as a model system to explore the role of HOCl andl-tyrosine in modifying the aminophospholipids of LDL.pHA-ethanolamine was abundant in the phospholipids of LDL exposed to activated neutrophils and tyrosine (Fig.1) but was undetectable in plasma LDL. Selected ion monitoring confirmed that both of the major ions expected for pHA-ethanolamine (m/z 769 and 552) co-eluted and exhibited the anticipated abundance. pHA-ethanolamine formation required l-tyrosine and activation of the neutrophils with phorbol ester. Formation of the adduct was inhibited by catalase and cyanide, implicating H2O2 and a peroxidase in the cell-mediated reaction. Addition of superoxide dismutase, which converts superoxide to H2O2, further enhancedpHA-ethanolamine production, perhaps by increasing the availability of peroxide or preventing myeloperoxidase inactivation (44.Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To firmly establish that pHA generated by the myeloperoxidase system of phagocytes was reacting with LDL phospholipids, we incubated the enzyme with LDL and H2O2 in a physiological buffer containing plasma concentrations of chloride ion and l-tyrosine. To inhibit metal-catalyzed reactions, DTPA was included in the reaction mixture. At the end of the incubation period, the amount ofpHA-ethanolamine in the acid hydrolysate of the reduced lipid extract was determined by GC/MS. The complete enzymatic system (myeloperoxidase, H2O2, l-tyrosine, and chloride ion) generated pHA-ethanolamine on the phospholipids of LDL (Fig. 2). Formation of the product required chloride ion and was inhibited by the heme poisons sodium cyanide (10 mm) and sodium azide (10 mm), implicating HOCl generation by myeloperoxidase in the reaction pathway. pHA-ethanolamine was undetectable in acid hydrolysates of lipids extracted from LDL isolated from plasma treated with NaBH3CN. However, when LDL was exposed to synthetically prepared pHA followed by reduction of Schiff base adducts with 10 mm NaBH3CN, pHA-ethanolamine appeared in the aminophospholipids of the lipoprotein. The reaction depended linearly upon the concentration of pHA (Fig.3); at 1 mm pHA, the yield of pHA-ethanolamine was ∼2 mol/mol of LDL. The limit of detection of the GC/MS method was ∼1 μmol ofpHA-ethanolamine/mol of LDL, which corresponded to ∼0.1 μm pHA in the reaction mixture. Collectively, these results indicate that pHA produced by the myeloperoxidase/H2O2 system of human neutrophils reacts with the ethanolamine of LDL phospholipids to yield the pHA-ethanolamine adduct. To establish the specificity ofpHA-phosphatidylethanolamine as a marker for phospholipid modification by myeloperoxidase, we quantified the level ofpHA-ethanolamine in LDL exposed to a variety of model oxidation systems supplemented with plasma levels of chloride andl-tyrosine (Table I). The adduct was readily detectable in LDL exposed to the complete myeloperoxidase system, and reagent HOCl could replace the enzymatic system. Previous studies have suggested that tyrosine bromoamine yields much smaller amounts of pHA than tyrosine chloroamine (34.Hazen S.L. Gaut J.P. Hsu F.F. Crowley J.R. d'Avignon A. Heinecke J.W. J.

This wide range of functions is likely attributable to their membrane topology. In fact, they are asymmetrically located in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane bilayer, with the oligosaccharide moiety exposed toward the external medium and the ceramide portion embedded in the hydrophobic core of the bilayer. Therefore, they are available to interact either with membrane-associated molecules or with external ligands. As a matter of fact, the occurrence of ganglioside-protein interaction has been reported (6.Rebbaa A. Hurh J. Yamamoto H. Kersey D.S. Bremer E.G.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Another peculiar feature of glycolipids is their enrichment—along with sphingomyelin, cholesterol, and a series of functionally related proteins—within discrete plasma membrane domains, the involvement of which in the mechanisms of signal transduction, cell adhesion, and lipid/protein sorting has been postulated (10.Simons K.

In particular, among glycolipids, domains are typically enriched in GM1 ganglioside, which is often utilized as a lipid marker of these membrane structures (11.Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev.

However, despite the reported co-segregation of glycolipids and specific proteins inside domains (14.Kasahara K. Watanabe Y. Yamamoto T. Sanai Y. J. Biol.

In the present investigation, we used this approach in order to identify proteins interacting with gangliosides in neurons, in which these glycosphingolipids are particularly abundant (24.Tettamanti G.

Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For this purpose, cultured rat cerebellar granule cells were utilized, coupled with the use of a new GM1 ganglioside analog, TID-GM1,1 carrying a photoactivable diazirine group and labeled with 125I in the ceramide moiety.RESULTSAfter cell incubation with TID-GM1 for 2 h at 37 °C, 145 ± 2.5 pmol of probe/mg of protein were bound to granule cells. A parallel experiment performed with isotopically labeled [3H]GM1 (45.Schwarzmann G. Sandhoff K. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10865-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) gave very similar figures (138 ± 1.9 pmol/mg of protein), indicating that the association of the two molecules was comparable. After illumination of cells with UV light, inducing cross-linking of TID-GM1 with neighboring molecules, a membrane-enriched fraction was prepared. Autoradiography of the 2D-EF of this fraction (Fig. 1 A) showed the presence of a relatively small number of radiolabeled proteins, compared with those present in a 2D-EF after silver staining (Fig. 1 C). The main radioactive spots corresponded to proteins with masses of about 55 and 30 kDa, with pI values of about 5.The experiment was repeated carrying out the incubation at 4 °C. After 4 h of incubation, 20 ± 0.18 pmol of TID-GM1/mg of protein were bound to granule cells. After photoactivation, the membrane-enriched fraction was prepared, and 2D-EF was carried out. A lesser number of radiolabeled proteins (Fig. 1 B) were detected in comparison with the experiment carried out at 37 °C. The major radioactive spots were again corresponding to proteins of about 55- (from now on called P55) and 30-kDa mass. A nearly identical radiolabeling pattern was observed when cell incubation with TID-GM1 was carried out at 4 °C in the presence of inhibitors of endocytosis, nocodazole, or colchicine (data not shown).In the 2D-EF of the membrane-enriched fraction after silver staining, a major spot, apparently due to at least two proteins partially overlapping and having electrophoretic characteristics similar to P55, was present. This major spot, after transfer to PDVF membrane, elution, and amino acid sequencing, showed its identity with α- and β-tubulin, suggesting that P55 could correspond to the product of cross-linking between TID-GM1 and tubulin.In order to verify this hypothesis, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. For this purpose, the membrane-enriched fraction, prepared after cell incubation with TID-GM1 and photoactivation at 4 °C, was lysed at 37 °C and immunoprecipitation carried out using monoclonal antibodies against α-, β-, or acetyl-tubulin. As shown in Fig. 2, the radioactive protein P55 was present in the immunoprecipitates obtained with any of the three antibodies. Using preimmune serum instead of anti-tubulin antibody and submitting the cells to the immunoprecipitation procedure, P55 was undetectable in the immunoprecipitate under the same conditions.Figure 2Assessment of the presence of tubulin among the proteins cross-linked by the photoactivable radioactive GM1 ganglioside analog TID-GM1.

The pattern of radiolabeled proteins was different from that obtained with TID-GM1 (the autoradiography of the 2D-EF of the membrane-enriched fraction is reported in Fig.3).Figure 3Detection of the proteins cross-linked by the photoactivable radioactive phosphatidylcholine analog TID-PC.

Tetzloff S.U. Bharadwaj M. Neurochem. Res. 1994; 19: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The results, reported in Fig. 5, show that NH2-OH treatment did not cause substantial loss of radioactivity from P55, whereas approximately 90% of radioactivity was released after treatment with KOH. No effect was exerted by a mere treatment with methanol.Figure 5Susceptibility to hydroxylamine or KOH treatment of tubulin cross-linked with the photoactivable radioactive GM1 ganglioside analog, TID-GM1. Cells were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with the photoactivable radioactive GM1 ganglioside analog TID-GM1 and illuminated with UV light, and the membrane-enriched fraction was prepared. The immunoprecipitate obtained from the membrane-enriched fraction using anti-tubulin antibodies was divided into three identical aliquots and subjected to electrophoresis on the same gel. The three lanes were cut from the gel and incubated in 1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0 (control), 1 mhydroxylamine, or 0.2 m KOH in methanol, respectively. After incubation, the gel was reassembled and subjected to autoradiography.

Cells were treated with Triton X-100 at low temperature and spun on a sucrose gradient, and 1.2-ml fractions of the gradient were assayed for radioactivity, protein content, and lipid content. The low density fraction (fraction 4), located at the 5–30% sucrose interface and corresponding to the DRF (40.Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z.-L. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar), displayed the highest GM1 enrichment, almost mirroring the distribution of TID-GM1 associated to the cells (Fig. 6 A). On the contrary, TID-PC was mostly localized outside the DRF, within the HDF.Figure 6Characterization of detergent-resistant fraction prepared from cerebellar granule cells: content of endogenous lipids and distribution of radioactivity in fractions withdrawn from the sucrose gradient. Cells, after incubation with either TID-GM1 or TID-PC and cross-linking induced by illumination with UV light, were treated with 1% Triton X-100-containing buffer for 30 min on ice. The suspension was subjected to discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation. 1.2-ml fractions were withdrawn from the gradient and subjected to GM1 determination and radioactivity counting (A). ■, GM1; ○, TID-GM1; ▵, TID-PC.

Moreover, DRF was also enriched in cholesterol (Fig. 6 C). Western blotting experiments showed that the DRF, always compared with the HDF, was enriched in signal transduction-related molecules such as Fyn, GAP-43, and Gα (Fig.7). The bulk of cytoskeleton markers (tubulin, actin, and Tau) were present in the HDF, as expected. Only faint bands were visible in the DRF, corresponding to the α- and acetyl isoforms of tubulin, and even fainter bands, corresponding to β-tubulin and to actin, whereas Tau was not detected in this fraction (Fig. 7).Figure 7Characterization of proteins in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from cerebellar granule cells. DRF and HDF (fraction 4 and a pool of fractions 8–10 of the gradient described in the label to Fig. 6, respectively), were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7 μg of protein/lane), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with the indicated antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)On the other hand, a comparison of the DRF (Fig.8 A) and the membrane-enriched fraction (Fig. 1 C) showed that the protein pattern, detected by silver staining, was much simpler in the detergent resistant fraction. The presence of tubulin in this fraction was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 8 B). Simple calculations based upon densitometric quantification of the protein bands visible in the two gels indicated that the proportion of tubulin over the total proteins in the DRF (about 18%) was higher than in the membrane-enriched fraction (about 7%). Next, the specific radioactivity of tubulin in the membrane-enriched and in detergent-resistant fraction was assessed, relying on the amount of radioactivity associated and on the amount of tubulin (as protein) in each fraction. Control experiments showed that under the conditions required for tubulin detection by ECL, the film utilized was not sensitized by the low amount of radioactivity associated to the protein. The specific radioactivity of tubulin was 2.1 arbitrary units in the DRF and 0.28 arbitrary units in the membrane-enriched fraction.Figure 8Characterization of proteins in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from cerebellar granule cells.

The main features of these analogs are the ability to form covalent bonds with neighboring proteins upon photoactivation, their extremely high specific radioactivity, and, in the absence of UV light, their remarkable stability under a range of different chemical and physical conditions (32.Weber T. Brunner J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 3084-3095Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). After incubation of cerebellar granule cells with TID-GM1 at 37 °C and photoactivation, a series of proteins become radiolabeled, indicating their proximity to the probe. Clues about the localization of these proteins were obtained performing incubation and successive photoactivation at 4 °C. In fact, at this temperature, ganglioside internalization is prevented (46.Parton R.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 47.Sofer A. Schwarzmann G. Futerman A.H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2111-2119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48.Riboni L. Prinetti A. Bassi R. Tettamanti G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 287: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and therefore TID-GM1/protein cross-linking at the plasma membrane is privileged. A protein (P55) with a mass of about 55 kDa and another of about 30 kDa and a pI of about 5 were radiolabeled under all of the experimental conditions adopted. A further confirmation of their cross-linking at the plasma membrane was obtained by experiments carried out with TID-GM1 in the presence of inhibitors of endocytosis (34.Gundersen G.G. Bulinski J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5946-5950Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 35.Lu S.C. Garcia-Ruiz C. Kuhlenkamp S. Ookhtens M. Salas-Prato M. Kaplowitz N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16088-16905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and at low temperature, excluding the possibility that part of the probe is endocytosed and interacts with intracellular proteins.Our attention was attracted by P55 because it displayed electrophoretic features similar to those of tubulin, present as a major spot and recognized by amino acid sequencing in the endogenous protein pattern of the membrane-enriched fraction.Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting experiments showed that P55 is indeed the product of cross-linking between the photoactivated ganglioside and α-, β-, and acetylated tubulin isoforms. The existence of a covalent bond between the two molecules, typical of photoreagents of this class (32.Weber T. Brunner J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 3084-3095Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar), is further strengthened by the following considerations: (a) 2D electrophoresis and autoradiography were carried out on membrane-enriched fractions after delipidization, removing lipids that are not covalently bound. In addition, under the EF conditions, unbound lipids dissociate from proteins and run at the front (as discussed in Ref. 17.Fra A. Masserini M. Palestini P. Sonnino S. Simons K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). (b) Tubulin immunoprecipitation was carried out on membrane-enriched fractions after lysis in detergent-containing buffer at 37 °C. At this temperature, membrane domains, detergent-resistant only at low temperature (10.Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8015) Google Scholar, 40.Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z.-L. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar, 56.Hakomori S. Handa K. Iwabuchi K. Yamamura S. Prinetti A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: XI-XIXCrossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), are disrupted. Therefore, immunoprecipitation of membrane rafts, containing tubulin along with noncovalently bound TID-GM1 or other cross-linked proteins, is prevented, reducing the possibility of artifacts.Taken together, these results suggest that TID-GM1 cross-links tubulin at the plasma membrane of cerebellar granule cells. Even if microtubules, in which tubulin is the main component, are intracellular structures and gangliosides are typical membrane components, their apparent interaction has an explanation in the long known existence of membrane-associated tubulin (49.Stephens R.E. Biol. Cell. 1986; 57: 95-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 50.Zisapel N. Levi M. Gozes I. J. Neurochem. 1980; 43: 26-32Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 51.Babich J.A. J.

However, the topology of membrane tubulin is not completely understood. For instance, it has been postulated that tubulin-like, trypsin-sensitive proteins can be present at the cell surface in neurons (54.Estrige M. Nature. 1977; 268: 60-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that membrane-associated tubulin is an integral membrane protein (50.Zisapel N. Levi M. Gozes I. J. Neurochem. 1980; 43: 26-32Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 51.Babich J.A. J. Neurochem. 1981; 37: 1394-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Other investigations claim that its hydrophobicity arises from the interaction with other membrane components (52.Nunez-Fernandez M. Beltramo D.M. del C. Alonso A. Barra H.S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 170: 91-98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Caron (53.Caron J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 621-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) showed that tubulin is palmitoylated and ascribed its hydrophobic behavior at least in part to this feature.Experiments with trypsin, to which P55 was resistant, on the one hand ruled out that cross-linking was occurring with tubulin at the plasma membrane surface, and on the other hand gave additional information. In fact, cell-associated exogenous gangliosides that are not removed by trypsin treatment (the so-called trypsin-stable form of ganglioside association with cells) are considered to be correctly inserted with the ceramide moiety in the hydrophobic core of the bilayer (55.Saqr E.H. Pearl D.K. Yates A.J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 395-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Because the ganglioside photoactivable group is located at the end of the ceramide fatty acid moiety, these results indicate that ganglioside-tubulin interaction is taking place within the hydrophobic core of the plasma membrane bilayer.Therefore, we inspected the possibility that TID-GM1 was cross-linked with a lipid anchor of tubulin. In this case, a release of radioactivity from P55 would occur after treatment with hydroxylamine or KOH, which are able to selectively remove different protein lipid anchors (43.Bizzozero"
https://openalex.org/W1921727696,"We investigated the gene expression of the nuclear transcription factors c/EBPalpha, GATA-2, and the silencer Oct-1 in conjunction with the gene expression of all major cytochrome P450 genes and of eNOS in cultures of endothelial cells of the rat. The purity of cultured endothelial cells was also confirmed by flow cytometry measurements of PECAM-1, a surface antigen of endothelial cells. Taken collectively, the gene expression and flow cytometry studies provide strong evidence for c/EBPalpha, GATA-2, and Oct-1 to play a key role in the cellular dedifferentiation of endothelial cells; gene expression of eight individual CYP genes in conjunction with protein activity could be significantly increased upon treatment with Aroclor 1254, a well-documented chemical inducer of a battery of genes. Nevertheless, the gene expression of c/EBPalpha, GATA-2, and most of the CYP genes was dramatically reduced (up to 90%) in cell cultures lacking PECAM-1 expression; in strong contrast, expression of the silencer Oct-1 was massively increased (approximately 14-fold). We thus conclude activation of the silencer Oct-1 to be strongly correlated with loss of PECAM-1 and eNOS gene expression, e.g., loss of cellular differentiation and endothelial function; in conjunction, gene expression of all major P450 isoforms was dramatically reduced in cultures of dedifferentiated endothelial cells. This process of cellular dedifferentiation and endothelial dysfunction was accompanied by down-regulation of endothelial specific transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W1796402873,"Analyses of mutation effects can aid in understanding how large proteins act. The dopamine transporter (DAT) mediates complex actions in recognizing cocaine and in recognizing and translocating dopamine, sodium, and chloride. DAT proline residues, especially those in transmembrane (TM) domains, are good candidates for involvement in these DAT actions. We now report production of mutants substituting alanine and/or glycine residues for 16 prolines located in or near putative DAT TM domains. We examine effects of these modifications on DAT expression, dopamine uptake, and cocaine analog binding. Mutants in prolines located in five DAT TM domains and four connecting loops alter apparent DAT membrane targeting. Five mutations decrease dopamine affinities more than threefold without significantly decreasing cocaine analog affinities. One decreases cocaine analog affinity without decreasing dopamine affinity. Two mutations decrease affinities for both dopamine and cocaine analog. P101 is especially implicated in dopamine uptake. Alanine substitution for this proline yields dopamine V(max) values of less than 3% of wild-type values despite dopamine affinities more than fourfold higher than wild-type and normal Na(+) and Cl(-) dependence. These DAT proline mutants identify DAT regions likely for dopamine translocation and for recognition of dopamine and cocaine."

Understanding the mechanism of ribonuclease cytotoxicity is vital for the further development of ribonucleases as chemotherapeutics. Ribonuclease-mediated cytotoxicity is known to depend on several factors. Ribonucleases must enter the cell and reach the cytosol, where RNA degradation leads ultimately to cell death (9.Kim J.-S.

BS-RNase forms a homodimer, which is stabilized by two intersubunit disulfide bridges. This dimeric form has a much lower affinity for RI than does the free monomer (24.Murthy B.S. Sirdeshmukh R. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). ONC evades RI as a monomer. Only 3 of the 24 RNase A residues that contact RI are conserved in ONC (7.Ardelt W.

Here, we probe for the first time the interplay between ribonucleolytic activity and RI affinity in the cytotoxicity of a ribonuclease. We find that cytotoxicity can be maintained in an RNase A variant with decreased catalytic activity if there is a concomitant decrease in the affinity for RI.

Thus, Lys-41 of RNase A likely plays an important role in both the manifestation of ribonucleolytic activity and its inhibition by RI. To probe the interplay between activity and its inhibition, we chose to create variants of RNase A that have a lysine, arginine, or alanine residue at position 41. These substitutions were all made in G88R RNase A, which is cytotoxic (18.Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.-M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 98: 10407-10412Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Wild-type RNase A, its G88R, G88R/K41R, and G88R/K41A variants, and ONC were produced and purified by methods analogous to those described (18.Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.-M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 98: 10407-10412Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by UV spectroscopy using ε277.5 = 0.72 ml mg−1 cm−1 for RNase A (34.Sela M. Anfinsen C.B. Harrington W.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 26: 502-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and its variants and ε280 = 0.87 ml mg−1 cm−1for ONC (18.Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.-M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 98: 10407-10412Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Data from cytotoxicity assays performed at 37 °C (see below) can be interpreted properly only with knowledge of the conformation of the protein at that temperature. The conformational stability of each RNase A variant was measured by UV spectroscopy as described (18.Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.-M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 98: 10407-10412Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Data were fitted to a two-state model for denaturation, and this fit was used to determine the value of T m, which is the temperature at the midpoint of the thermal transition. The embedded-ribonucleotide substrate 6-FAM∼dArUdAdA∼6-TAMRA exhibits a 200-fold increase in fluorescence upon cleavage by ribonucleases and is ideal for the rapid and accurate determination ofk cat/K m andK i values for RNase A and its homologs and variants (35.Kelemen B.R. Klink T.A. Behlke M.A. Eubanks S.R. Leland P.A. Raines R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3696-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Values of k cat/K m for the RNase A variants were determined by measuring the increase in the fluorescence of 6-FAM∼dArUdAdA∼6-TAMRA (excitation, 490 nm; emission, 515 nm) over time as described (35.Kelemen B.R. Klink T.A. Behlke M.A. Eubanks S.R. Leland P.A. Raines R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3696-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Data were fitted to the equation: k cat/K m = (ΔI/Δt){(I f −I o)[E]}, where ΔI/Δt is the measured activity,I o is the initial fluorescence intensity before addition of enzyme, I f is the fluorescence intensity upon depletion of the substrate following addition of wild-type RNase A, and [E] is the ribonuclease concentration (35.Kelemen B.R. Klink T.A. Behlke M.A. Eubanks S.R. Leland P.A. Raines R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3696-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Knowing the solution concentrations of active RI is necessary for the calculation ofK i values. The buffer of commercial RI contains the viscogen glycerol, which may lessen the accuracy of volumes delivered by pipette. The viscous buffer was exchanged for 20 mmHEPES-HCl buffer (pH 7.6) containing KCl (50 mm) and DTT (8 mm) by using a Microcon concentrator (10,000M r cut-off; Amicon). The glycerol-free solution of RI was diluted 10:1 with 20 mm HEPES-HCl buffer (pH 7.6), and aliquots were stored at −78 °C. The concentration of active RI was determined by titration with RNase A. Specifically, the ribonucleolytic activity was measured in the presence of aliquots of RI. A solution of RNase A (0.42 nm) and RI in 0.10 m MES-NaOH buffer (pH 6.0) containing NaCl (0.10 mm) and DTT (5 mm) was incubated at 25 °C for 5 min. Poly(C) was added (to 0.10 μm), and the increase in absorbance at 250 nm was measured over time. The concentration of active RI was calculated by assuming that the number of moles of RI equals one-half the number of moles of RNase A at 50% activity. Values ofK i were determined by measuring the effect of RI on ribonucleolytic activity. Reaction mixtures (2.0 ml) consisted of 0.10m MES-NaOH buffer (pH 6.0) containing NaCl (0.10m), DTT (5 mm), enzyme (3.4 pm or 6.8 pm G88R RNase A; 60 pm K41R/G88R RNase A; 0.66 nm or 1.1 nm K41A/G88R RNase A), 6-FAM∼dArUdAdA-6∼TAMRA (0.60 μm), and RI (24 pm–3.0 nm for G88R RNase A; 0.24 nm-–30 nm for K41R/G88R RNase A and K41A/G88R RNase A). Eight additions of RI were performed, doubling the concentration of RI with each addition and allowing at least 5 min between additions. The apparent K i values were determined by nonlinear least squares regression analysis of data fitted to the equation: ΔI/Δt = (ΔI/Δt)o{K i/(K i+ [I])}, where (ΔI/Δt)o is the activity before inhibitor addition, ΔI/Δtis the activity after inhibitor addition, and [I] is the concentration of RI, which was corrected for changes in volume (35.Kelemen B.R. Klink T.A. Behlke M.A. Eubanks S.R. Leland P.A. Raines R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3696-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The cytotoxicity of a ribonuclease was assessed by measuring its effect on the incorporation of [methyl-3H]thymidine into DNA newly synthesized by K-562 cells. A ribonuclease in phosphate-buffered saline (KCl (0.20 g/liter), KH2PO4 (0.20 g/liter), NaCl (8.0 g/liter), Na2HPO4·7H2O (2.16 g/liter)) was added to cells growing at 37 °C, and cytotoxicity was evaluated after 44 h as described (18.Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.-M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 98: 10407-10412Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Results were expressed as the percentage of methyl-3H incorporated into the DNA of cells treated with phosphate-buffered saline alone. Data represent the average of three repetitions of each individual assay. K41R/G88R RNase A and K41A/G88R RNase A were found to have T m values of (63 ± 2) °C and (64 ± 2) °C, respectively. TheT m values for wild-type RNase A (63 °C), G88R RNase A (60 °C), and ONC (90 °C) were reported previously (18.Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.-M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 98: 10407-10412Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). All of these ribonucleases are >99% folded at 37 °C. The value ofk cat/K m = 3.6 × 107m−1 s−1 for the cleavage of 6-FAM∼dArUdAdA∼6-TAMRA by wild-type RNase A was reported previously (35.Kelemen B.R. Klink T.A. Behlke M.A. Eubanks S.R. Leland P.A. Raines R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3696-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Here the value ofk cat/K m for G88R RNase A was found to be 1.4 × 107m−1s−1, which is 2-fold lower than that of the wild-type enzyme. Previous measurements of catalytic activity with poly(C) as substrate gave a similar ratio, with thek cat/K m values of RNase A (5.7 × 106m−1s−1) and G88R RNase A (2.9 × 106m−1 s−1) differing by 2-fold (18.Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.-M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 98: 10407-10412Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Substitutions at position 41 in RNase A are known to reduce catalytic activity (29.Messmore J.M. Fuchs D.N. Raines R.T. J. Am. Chem.

The cleavage of poly(C) by the K41R and K41A variants was reported previously to be 102- and 104-fold slower, respectively, than by wild-type RNase A (29.Messmore J.M. Fuchs D.N. Raines R.T. J. Am.

Thek cat/K m value of K41R/G88R RNase A is 5 × 105m−1s−1, which is 70-fold lower than that of the wild-type enzyme. Thek cat/K m value of K41A/G88R RNase A is 6.5 × 103m−1s−1, which is 5,500-fold less than that of RNase A. The complex of RI with wild-type RNase A is extremely tight (K i ≈ 10−14m (21.Lee F.S. Shapiro R. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 22.Vicentini A.M. Kieffer B. Mathies R. Meyhack B. Hemmings B.A. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8827-8834Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar)). The G88R RNase A variant has a weaker affinity for RI. The K i for G88R RNase A measured with the fluorogenic substrate was 0.18 nm, which is similar to that determined previously with poly(C) as substrate (18.Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.-M.

The double variants K41R/G88R and K41A/G88R RNase A have even lower affinities for RI with K i values of 3.0 and 3.2 nm, respectively (TableI).Table IValues of kcat/Km, Ki, (kcat/Km)cytosol, and IC50 for ribonucleasesRibonucleasek cat/K mK i(k cat/K m)cytosolIC5010 7 m −1 s −1nm10 3 m −1 s −1μmRNase A3.6 ± 0.4aRef. 35.0.000044bRef. 21.0.002G88R RNase A1.4 ± 0.10.18 ± 0.0436K41R/G88R RNase A0.05 ± 0.013.0 ± 0.412K41A/G88R RNase A0.00065 ± 0.000043.2 ± 0.50.02ONC0.000077 ± 0.000009≥1 × 103cRef. 23.≥ 0.40.3Values of k cat/K m were determined for catalysis of 6-FAM∼dArUdAdA∼6-TAMRA cleavage at pH 6.0 and 25 °C.

Values of K i were determined for inhibition of catalysis by ribonuclease inhibitor. The parameter (k cat/K m)cytosol is defined in Equation 1. Values of IC50 were determined for the toxicity of K-562 cells (Fig. 2). The toxicity of the RNase A variants to K-562 cells was compared with wild-type RNase A as a negative control and ONC as a positive control. G88R RNase A has an IC50 value of 6 μm, which is comparable to that reported previously (18.Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.-M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 98: 10407-10412Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Wild-type RNase A is not toxic to K-562 cells, even at 50 μm. Like the wild-type enzyme, K41A/G88R RNase A is not cytotoxic. Surprisingly, K41R/G88R RNase A, which has 28-fold less ribonucleolytic activity than G88R RNase A, has an IC50 of 2 μm, which is 3-fold lower than that of G88R RNase A (Fig. 2). Both of the single variants, K41R RNase A and K41A RNase A, were not cytotoxic (data not shown). Lys-31 in ONC is homologous to Lys-41 in RNase A. K31R ONC has an IC50 value of 0.5 μm, which is somewhat higher than the IC50 of ONC (0.3 μm) (data not shown). The ability to evade RI is a necessary attribute for the cytotoxicity of ribonucleases (3.Raines R.T. Frey P.A. Northrop D.B. Enzymatic Mechanisms. IOS Press, Washington, D. C.1999: 235-249Google Scholar). ONC evades RI exceptionally well and is highly cytotoxic, despite its low ribonucleolytic activity relative to RNase A. Wild-type RNase A is 104-fold more active as a catalyst of RNA cleavage than is ONC (Table I). Yet, RNase A is not cytotoxic, even at concentrations that are 102-fold higher than the IC50 of ONC (Fig. 2). The critical biochemical distinction is likely to be the differential affinity for RI. Wild-type RNase A forms an extremely tight complex with RI (K i≈ 10−14m (21.Lee F.S. Shapiro R. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 22.Vicentini A.M. Kieffer B. Mathies R. Meyhack B. Hemmings B.A. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8827-8834Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar)) in comparison to ONC (K i ≥ 10−6m (23.Boix E. Wu Y. Vasandani V.M. Saxena S.K. Ardelt W. Ladner J. Youle R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 992-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar)). In the RI·RNase A complex, the side chain of Lys-41 lies in a cavern that ends at the side chain of Asp-431 (Fig. 1 A). RI has a nearly 20-fold higher K i for both K41R/G88R RNase A and K41A/G88R RNase A than for G88R RNase A (Table I). The larger side chain at position 41 in the K41R/G88R variant may weaken the interaction with RI by steric repulsion or by a less optimal Coulombic interaction with Asp-431. Replacing Lys-41 with the smaller, uncharged alanine residue in K41A/G88R RNase A shows a similar decrease in RI affinity as K41R/G88R RNase A. Removing the Asp-431(RI)-Lys-41(RNase A) Coulombic interaction could contribute to this decrease in affinity. The lower ribonucleolytic activity of K41R/G88R RNase A does not cripple this enzyme as a cytotoxin. Despite having a 30-fold lowerk cat/K m value than G88R RNase A, K41R/G88R RNase A is 3-fold more cytotoxic (Table I). The likely explanation is the 20-fold better ability of the K41R/G88R variant to evade RI. In contrast, K41A/G88R RNase A is not cytotoxic, despite its ability to evade RI to the same extent as does the K41R/G88R variant. The basis for the dramatic difference in the cytotoxicity of K41A/G88R RNase A and K41R/G88R RNase A is likely to reside in the 80-fold lower ribonucleolytic activity of the K41A/G88R variant. Ribonucleolytic activity would be destructive in the cytosol, where RNA is prevalent. Yet RI is also present in the cytosol, and only an uninhibited ribonuclease is able to catalyze RNA cleavage. The cytotoxic ribonucleases herein display decreases ink cat/K m values in the order: G88R RNase A > K41R/G88R RNase A > ONC, but concomitant increases in K i values in the reverse order: ONC > K41R/G88R RNase A > G88R RNase A (Table I). Interestingly, the decreases ink cat/K m values are similar in magnitude to the increases in K i values. This finding suggests that these two parameters,k cat/K m andK i, are related to IC50 in a simple manner. To relate ribonucleolytic activity and its inhibition by RI to cytotoxicity, we define (k cat/K m)cytosolas a measure of the ribonucleolytic activity that is manifested in the presence of cytosolic RI,kcat/Kmcyto=kcatKm1+([RI]/Ki)Equation 1 To use Equation 1, we use the values ofk cat/K m andK i in Table I and assume that [RI] = 1 μm (3.Raines R.T. Frey P.A. Northrop D.B. Enzymatic Mechanisms. IOS Press, Washington, D. C.1999: 235-249Google Scholar, 13.Roth J.S. Methods Cancer Res. 1967; 3: 153-242Google Scholar, 14.Blackburn P. Moore S. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 15. Academic Press, Inc., New York1982: 317-433Google Scholar). Then, the values of (k cat/K m)cytosolfor ONC, K41R/G88R RNase A, and G88R RNase A are >4 × 102m−1 s−1, 3 × 103m−1 s−1, and 1 × 103m−1s−1, respectively (Table I). The similarity of the (k cat/K m)cytosolvalues for the G88R and K41R/G88R variants is in gratifying agreement with the similarity of their IC50 values (Table I). This agreement suggests that the (k cat/K m)cytosolparameter has predictive value for variants of RNase A. The values of (k cat/K m)cytosolfor wild-type RNase A and the K41A/G889 variant, which are not cytotoxic, are 2 m−1 s−1 and 2 × 101m−1s−1, respectively. A threshold of (k cat/K m)cytosol> 2 × 101m−1s−1 may be necessary for an RNase A variant to be cytotoxic. A homolog or variant of RNase A can be made cytotoxic by increasing its ribonucleolytic activity in the presence of RI. Lesser intrinsic catalytic activity can be overcome by greater RI evasion. New chemotherapeutics may arise from homologs or variants of RNase A with low catalytic activity (such as ONC) if the ribonuclease also has a low affinity for RI."
https://openalex.org/W1957149104,"Most existing knowledge about [Ca(2+)](i) signaling in vascular endothelium has been based on studies using endothelial cells cultured in vitro. To examine how endothelial cells behave in situ, we have developed a method to monitor single-cell [Ca(2+)](i) from Fura-2-loaded rat aortic segments. Fluorescence ratio images from large numbers of endothelial cells were acquired by using a flow chamber mounted on a dual-wavelength fluorescence microscope. Our results showed that either acetylcholine or histamine reversibly activated the vascular endothelium by eliciting M(3) or H(1) receptor-mediated [Ca(2+)](i) increases, respectively. The acetylcholine-evoked endothelial [Ca(2+)](i) elevation at the branch site (intercostal orifice) was much more pronounced than that at the non-branch area. However, endothelium at the branch site was relatively insensitive to histamine. Both acetylcholine-sensitive and histamine-sensitive endothelial cells were arranged in belts aligned along flow lines and were intercalated with each other. Data analyzed from 400 endothelial cells located at the non-branch site showed drastically heterogeneous [Ca(2+)](i) responses to a fixed concentration of either acetylcholine or histamine, differing by two orders of magnitude in individual cells. As a conclusion, vascular endothelial cells appear to have their own characteristic [Ca(2+)](i) 'fingerprint' to various agonists and they may function coordinately in situ."

Neuron. 1994; 13: 187-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). TrkA is a tyrosine kinase receptor that transduces NGF signals. The dimeric NGF protein induces TrkA dimerization leading to activation of the kinase (13.Kaplan D.R. Martin-Zanca D. Parada L.F. Nature. 1991; 350: 158-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar), as expected by analogy with other receptor tyrosine kinases (14.Heldin C.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). However, dimeric ligands do not always lead to receptor activation (15.Livnah O. Johnson D.L. Stura E.A. Farrell F.X. Barbone F.P. You Y. Liu K.D. Goldsmith M.A. He W. Krause C.D. Pestka S. Jolliffe L.K. Wilson I.A. Nat. Struct.

Hence, the possibility that monomeric ligands could induce conformational changes leading to receptor dimerization or activation remains an attractive hypothesis (18.Jiang G. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R568-R571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Since no biological studies have been done with defined and genuine monomeric ligands of TrkA or any other tyrosine kinase receptor, this is one aim of the present study. Functional synergy between bivalent Trk ligands and bivalent p75 ligands, leading to enhanced Trk activation and cell survival, have been reported (6.Maliartchouk S. Saragovi H.U. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6031-6037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Bibel M. Hoppe E. Barde Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). However, no functional studies of synergy have been done with defined and genuine monovalent ligands of p75 and TrkA. This is another aim of the present study. To answer both aims, we used defined monovalent and monomeric ligands that bind to the extracellular domain of TrkA and p75 receptors. Specifically, we asked (i) whether monovalent and monomeric ligands of TrkA can act as partial agonists, (ii) whether monomeric ligands of TrkA can synergize with ligands of p75, and (iii) what the valency requirement is for p75 ligands to synergize with TrkA ligands. Three sets of ligands that bind the extracellular domain of NGF receptors were available. Each ligand was used in its bivalent or monovalent state, alone or in combinations, to probe receptor function in biological and biochemical assays. Anti-TrkA mAb 5C3 is an agonist ligand of TrkA (19.LeSauteur L. Maliartchouk S. Jeune H.L. Quirion R. Saragovi H.U. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1308-1316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-p75 mAb MC192 is a p75 ligand that can synergize with TrkA ligands (6.Maliartchouk S. Saragovi H.U. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6031-6037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides termed C(92–96) and C(92–97) bind TrkA in vitro and target TrkA-expressing cells in vivo (20.Debeir T. Saragovi H.U. Cuello A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4067-4072Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21.LeSauteur L. Wei L. Gibbs B. Saragovi H.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6564-6569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 22.LeSauteur L. Cheung N.K.V. Lisbona R. Saragovi H.U. Nat. Biotech. 1996; 14: 1120-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). When TrkA is engaged by these peptide analogs, binding of the natural ligand NGF is antagonized (21.LeSauteur L. Wei L. Gibbs B. Saragovi H.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6564-6569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), but a possible intrinsic activity of the peptide analogs upon binding TrkA had not been studied. Biophysical characterization of C(92–96), described herein, defines it as a genuine monomeric and monovalent TrkA ligand. We report that genuine monovalent TrkA ligands are partial agonists and induce TrkA activation and internalization and cell survival and differentiation. Expectedly, bivalent TrkA ligands afford more robust signals. These data challenge the exclusive notion of ligand bivalency postulated for activation of tyrosine kinase receptors. For p75, only bivalent ligands afford signals that synergize with TrkA-mediated signals. This suggests that TrkA and p75 differ in their requisites for ligand activation. Last, oligomerizing ligands afford the same signals as homodimerizing ligands. The insight that monovalent small molecule ligands can be partial agonists will be useful for screening and designing pharmacological agents, and the approach described can be adapted to the study of other receptors. Rat PC12 cells express low levels of rat TrkA and 40,000–100,000 p75 receptors/cell (TrkA+p75+++). B104 rat neuroblastomas express ∼50,000 p75 receptors/cell but do not express Trks (TrkA−p75+++). The 4-3.6 cells are B104 cells stably transfected with human trkA cDNA and express equal surface levels of p75 and TrkA (TrkA+++ p75+++) (23.Bogenmann E. Torres M. Matsushima H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1915-1925PubMed Google Scholar). The 6–24 cells are PC12 cells stably transfected with human trkAcDNA and overexpressing TrkA (TrkA+++p75+++). Cell surface expression of each of the NGF receptors was routinely controlled in all cells by quantitative FACScan assays (Becton Dickinson) (data not shown). These cells do not express detectable mRNA for neurotrophins (data not shown; Ref. 23.Bogenmann E. Torres M. Matsushima H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1915-1925PubMed Google Scholar) and undergo apoptosis when neurotrophins or serum are withdrawn. Fetal rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) primary cultures were established essentially as described (24.Kimpinski K. Campenot R. Mearow K. J. Neurobiol. 1997; 33: 395-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) from Harlan Sprague-Dawley day 17 rat embryos. All ganglia were dissected and dissociated first enzymatically with trypsin and then mechanically. Dissociated cells were cultured (100,000 cells/well) in 96-well plates precoated with collagen and grown for a total of 8 days in Neuro Basal Medium containing N2 supplement (Life Technologies, Inc.), antibiotics, andl-glutamine. These DRG cultures are ∼85% TrkA-expressing and are heavily dependent on TrkA signals for survival (25.Molliver D. Snider W. J. Comp. Neurol. 1997; 381: 428-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 26.Vogelbaum M. Tong J. Rich K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8928-8935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activities of anti-human TrkA IgG mAb 5C3 and anti-rat p75 IgG mAb MC192 have been described (6.Maliartchouk S. Saragovi H.U. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6031-6037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.LeSauteur L. Maliartchouk S. Jeune H.L. Quirion R. Saragovi H.U. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1308-1316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). mAbs 5C3 and MC192 do not cross-block each other's binding. Purified IgGs were digested with papain (Life Technologies, Inc.) to yield monovalent fragments (Fabs). For further purification, first papain was inactivated; second, the Fc fragments were removed in protein G-Sepharose columns (HiTrap; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); and third, the Fabs containing κ light chains were purified to >98% purity in KappaLock-Sepharose columns (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) and by preparative FPLC with sizing columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). No IgG was detected in Fab preparations. FPLC spectrometry and size exclusion analysis under native conditions did not reveal the presence of aggregates, even at 40 μm Fab concentrations (bioassays use nanomolar concentrations). The conditions used would have detected <0.2% of Fab aggregates. Binding competition assays between 5C3 Fabs and the intact antibody indicated that the affinity of Fabs (K d 10 nm) is within 5-fold of the intact IgG (K d 2 nm). The affinities of the MC192 Fabs were not measured directly. However, FACScan assays demonstrated that MC192 Fabs and MC192 IgG (Fig. 1, A and B) and 5C3 Fabs and 5C3 IgG (Fig. 1, C and D) bound their cellular targets in a specific and saturable fashion indistinguishable from each other (Fig.1). The NGF mimic C(92–96) is an N-acetylated (N-Ac) cyclic peptide with primary sequenceN-Ac-YCTDEKQCY. The NGF mimic C(92–97) isN-Ac-YCTDEKQACY. The C(92–96) and C(92–97) peptides are cyclized by intrachain disulfide bonds (indicated by the underlines) (21.LeSauteur L. Wei L. Gibbs B. Saragovi H.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6564-6569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These peptides are structural mimics of the C-D β-turn of NGF (27.Beglova N. LeSauteur L. Saragovi H. Gehring K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23652-23658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Linear peptides with the same sequences do not bind TrkA and were prepared as controls by substituting Cys with Met (primary sequence YMTDEKQMY). The linear peptides do not cyclize, and NMR spectroscopy indicated a lack of conformation (data not shown). The C(92–97)dimer is a tethered covalently linked dimer of C(92–97). High pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy analysis confirmed the expected retention time and mass for a dimer. N-Ac peptides were synthesized by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. Purification, quality control, and characterization of the peptides were done as described (21.LeSauteur L. Wei L. Gibbs B. Saragovi H.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6564-6569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and by NMR diffusion studies (this report). More convincingly, the full NMR spectra of N-Ac-C(92–96) were analyzed (27.Beglova N. LeSauteur L. Saragovi H. Gehring K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23652-23658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Assignment of all resonances and distances and resolution of the structure showed the peptide to be monomeric. Therefore, it is extremely unlikely that N-Ac-C(92–96) is a noncovalent dimer. With respect to a possible covalent dimer, mass spectroscopy (API III MS System, Sciex, Thornhill, Ontario) by electrospray ionization quadrupole (data points every 0.1 Da) verified the chemical composition and monomeric state ofN-Ac-C(92–96) with 1192.3 ± 0.3 atomic mass units measured, which is the theoretical mass (1192.2) for an oxidized monomer. No trace of a covalent peptide dimer was detected even after prolonged signal averaging, using conditions that would have detected 1% of dimer. Therefore, it is extremely unlikely thatN-Ac-C(92–96) is a covalent dimer. NMR samples contained 5 mm N-Ac-C(92–96) in distilled water at pH 5.7 containing 10% (v/v) of D2O for the deuterium lock. When D2O was used as a solvent, the peptide was twice lyophilized and redissolved in D2O. Spectra were acquired at 500-MHz proton frequency on a three-channel Bruker DRX500 spectrometer equipped with pulsed field gradients. Standard experimental protocols were used for the acquisition of NMR spectra and spectral assignments. Isotropic self-diffusion measurements used NMR pulse field gradients at different peptide concentrations (28.Altieri A. Hinton D. Byrd R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 7566-7567Crossref Scopus (438) Google Scholar,29.Szafer A. Zhong J. Anderson A. Gore J. NMR Biomed. 1995; 8: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Seventeen one-dimensional assays were done at each concentration with gradient strengths from 0.67 to 63.65 G/cm, gradient duration of 3.5 ms, and a diffusion time of 150 ms. Peptide signal decay was measured at nine different frequencies. Data were fit to the equationI =I°exp(−(γδG)2(τ − δ/3)δ), where I is the experimentally measured signal intensity attenuated by diffusion, γ is the 1H gyromagnetic ratio, δ is gradient duration, G is the gradient strength, τ is time between gradient pulses, and δ is diffusion coefficient. Results were averaged. Antibodies are defined as “artificial receptor ligands” because they are specific, they bind with high affinity, with saturable and reversible kinetics, and they are bioactive. Responses to a full dose range (from picomolar to high micromolar) were studied previously for some ligands, and responses for the same dose range for all ligands were studied herein (data not shown). Usually, only optimal concentrations of NGF mimics, mAbs, or Fabs that afford trophic signals are shown for clarity. The NGF mimic C(92–96) is monomeric and monovalent. It is water-soluble and does not aggregate even at 18 mm (this paper). The C(92–97)dimer is a covalent dimer and bivalent analog of the C(92–97) NGF mimic. Intact IgGs are dimeric and bivalent, and Fabs are monomeric and probably monovalent. Where indicated, Fabs were cross-linked with goat anti-mouse Fab antibody (α-Fab; Sigma) at a 2:1 ratio of Fab to α-Fab. This cross-linking ratio affords optimal dimerization (one α-Fab can bind two Fabs). Higher cross-linking of Fabs using Fab/α-Fab ratios of 1:1 or 1:5 (each Fab bound by many α-Fabs), leading to ligand oligomerization, achieved results comparable with dimerizing ratios of 2:1 Fab/α-Fab (data not shown). After a total of 8 days of culture with NGF (Prince Labs, Toronto, Canada) or the indicated test or control ligands, cell survival were studied using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetric assay and by microscopic observation. 5,000 cells/well in protein-free medium (PFHM-II; Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (crystalline fraction V; Sigma) were seeded in 96-well plates (Falcon, Mississauga, Canada). The cultures were untreated or were treated with the indicated test or control ligands. Cell viability was quantitated using the MTT assay after 56–72 h of culture, and apoptotic death was confirmed by analysis of DNA fragmentation patterns. Percentage of protection was standardized from MTT OD readings relative to optimal NGF (1 nm) = 100%. The OD values of untreated cells were subtracted and were <15% for cell lines and <30% for primary cultures. The higher survival of untreated primary cultures is probably due to endogenous production of limiting amounts of growth factors. TrkA tyrosine phosphorylation was assayed after a 15-min treatment of intact cells with the indicated agent(s) and revealed by Western blotting of whole cell lysates as described (6.Maliartchouk S. Saragovi H.U. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6031-6037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-phosphotyrosine (α-Tyr(P)) mAb 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) or antiserum α-Tyr(P)490 against the Tyr(P)490 of TrkA (within the Shc docking site) (30.Segal R. Bhattacharyya A. Rua L.A. Alberta J.A. Stephens R.M. Kaplan D.R. Stiles C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20175-20181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) was used as a primary antibody. Bands in x-ray films were quantified by densitometry, and intensities were standardized relative to 1 nm NGF. Densitometry of four to five independent gels was analyzed statistically by paired Student's t tests with Bonferroni corrections. Live 4-3.6 cells were treated as indicated for 45 min at 4 °C in the presence or absence of 0.25% sodium azide. Cells were maintained at 4 °C or shifted to 37 °C for another 20 min to allow ligand-induced receptor internalization (9.Saragovi H.U. Zheng W. Maliartchouk S. DiGugliemo G.M. Mawal Y.R. Kamen A. Woo S.B. Cuello A.C. Debeir T. Neet K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34933-34940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Then, cells were washed and immunostained with mAb 5C3 at 4 °C (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% sodium azide), for analysis of surface TrkA expression by FACScan immunofluorescence as described (9.Saragovi H.U. Zheng W. Maliartchouk S. DiGugliemo G.M. Mawal Y.R. Kamen A. Woo S.B. Cuello A.C. Debeir T. Neet K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34933-34940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In each assay, 5,000 cells were acquired, and the mean channel fluorescence of bell-shaped histograms was analyzed (LYSIS II, Becton Dickinson, CA). Percentage inhibition of mAb 5C3 binding was calculated as a change in mean channel fluorescence with respect to control untreated cells. Rapid loss of surface TrkA is interpreted as receptor internalization, which is delayed or inhibited by low temperatures or sodium azide (9.Saragovi H.U. Zheng W. Maliartchouk S. DiGugliemo G.M. Mawal Y.R. Kamen A. Woo S.B. Cuello A.C. Debeir T. Neet K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34933-34940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Live 4-3.6 single cell suspensions were bound by the indicated ligand(s) for 45 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline, cross-linked with 1 mmdisuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce) for 15 min at 15 °C as described (31.Saragovi H. Malek T.R. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 476-481PubMed Google Scholar). Unreacted disuccinimidyl suberate was quenched with 5 mm ammonium acetate, and whole cells were lysed directly in SDS sample buffer. Equal amounts of protein for each sample were resolved in a 5–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gradient, transferred to nitrocellulose, and Western blotted with anti-Trk polyclonal antibody 203 (a gift of Dr. David Kaplan, McGill University) that recognizes the intracellular domain of Trk. This antibody was selected because of high specificity toward Trk in Western blots and because its epitopes are not affected by disuccinimidyl suberate cross-linking. Previously, we showed that anti-human TrkA mAb 5C3 significantly protected cells from apoptosis when cultured in serum-free medium (SFM), but anti-p75 mAb MC192 did not promote cell survival. Combinations of anti-TrkA mAb 5C3 and anti-p75 mAb MC192 synergized to protect cells optimally to levels comparable with 1 nm NGF, as did combinations of mAb MC192 and 10 pm NGF (6.Maliartchouk S. Saragovi H.U. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6031-6037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested 4-3.6 cells (human TrkA+++ rat p75+++) (Fig.2 A) or PC12 cels (rat TrkA+ rat p75+++) (Fig. 2 B) in the same paradigm but using putative monovalent ligands. Significant protection was afforded by 5C3 Fabs, in a dose-dependent manner. 5C3 Fabs at 1–10 nmafford protection comparable with 10 pm NGF. More robust protection was afforded by 1–10 nm 5C3 Fab·α-Fab complexes. Negative control α-Fab or mouse IgG did not afford survival. Positive control bivalent mAb 5C3 at the optimal concentration of 0.5 nm protected ∼50% of the cells. Interestingly, 10 nm 5C3 Fab·α-Fab complexes afforded significantly higher protection than 0.5 nm 5C3 IgG, possibly because 5C3 Fab·α-Fab complexes are more flexible than IgG or oligomerize TrkA more efficiently. 1 nm NGF protects PC12 cells (expressing rat TrkA+ rat p75+++) from apoptosis induced by culture in SFM. Low concentrations of NGF (10 pm) as a high affinity ligand afforded ∼30% survival. Monovalent MC192 Fabs failed to synergize with 10 pm NGF, and protection was not significantly different than 10 pm NGF alone. Synergy did occur with MC192 Fab·α-Fab complexes plus 10 pm NGF. The effect was dependent on the concentration of MC192 Fab·α-Fab complexes (data not shown) and was optimal at 1 nmcross-linked MC192 Fab. As positive control, bivalent MC192 synergized with 10 pmNGF increasing protection from ∼30 to ∼90%. Synergy was dependent on the concentration of mAb and was optimal at 0.5 nm MC192 (data not shown). Controls α-Fab, mouse IgG, bivalent MC192, monovalent MC192 Fabs, and MC192 Fab·α-Fab complexes alone did not protect PC12 cells substantially from apoptosis. In all permutations of these experiments, apoptotic cell death was confirmed by analysis of DNA fragmentation patterns (data not shown). To analyze the valency requirement of each NGF receptor, combinations of bivalent and monovalent antibody-based ligands were tested on 4-3.6 cells for synergy in protection of apoptotic cell death (Fig. 3). In these assays, it was encouraging to observe that comparable biological responses by different ligands (e.g. 1 nmcross-linked 5C3 Fabs afford the same protection as 0.5 nm5C3 bivalent IgG) also result in equivalent receptor occupancy (e.g. 1 nm Fabs bind the same number of receptors as 0.5 nm IgG). Positive controls of bivalent 5C3 combined with bivalent MC192 were synergistic and afforded 100% protection. Negative controls α-Fab alone and mouse IgG alone did not afford cell survival in SFM (data not shown). A combination of monovalent 5C3 Fab with either monovalent MC192 Fab or with bivalent MC192 did not result in synergy; the ∼25% protection was not significantly different from that seen with monovalent 5C3 Fab alone. However, 5C3 Fab·α-Fab complexes synergized with bivalent MC192. A combination of monovalent MC192 Fab with bivalent 5C3 did not result in synergy; the ∼50% protection was not significantly different than that afforded by bivalent 5C3 alone. In contrast, MC192 Fabs·α-Fab complexes synergized with bivalent 5C3 and afforded ∼110% protection. One bias in this assay is that α-Fab cross-linking does not occur exclusively at MC192 Fabs but also occurs upon bivalent 5C3, resulting in some multivalent 5C3 oligomers. However, α-Fab cross-linking of bivalent 5C3 IgG does not enhance its activity (data not shown), therefore the biological effect of cross-linking occurs at the MC192 Fabs. Last, α-Fab cross-linking of 1 nm MC192 Fab plus 5C3 Fab afforded ∼65% protection. This activity can be ascribed to four theoretical ligand mixtures: 5C3 dimers (25%), MC192 dimers (25%), and 5C3/MC192 heterodimers (50%). If the 5C3/MC192 heterodimers are indeed formed, they seem to be inactive, because we observed that reducing the concentration of bivalent mAbs 5C3 and MC192 to 0.125 nm (the concentrations in the theoretical mixtures above) results in synergy and ∼65% protection (data not shown). While the date is suggestive that heterodimers are inactive, this is an unclear issue, because we have no evidence that the heterodimers indeed form. The putative heterodimeric ligands cannot be isolated and analyzed because they dissociate and reassociate during purification; nor can they be stabilized, because binding activity is lost upon chemical cross-linking. Additionally, it is noteworthy that more extensive cross-linking with higher ratios of α-Fab did not increase protection, although higher oligomerization of ligands is expected (data not shown). For clarity, only nearly optimal concentrations of ligands are presented, but responses from micromolar to picomolar concentrations were studied (see “Materials and Methods”). Thus, optimal protection is afforded by combinations that result in homodimerizing ligands, and no increased protection is seen with oligomerizing ligands. In all permutations of these experiments, apoptotic cell death was confirmed by analysis of DNA fragmentation patterns (data not shown). Moreover, the ligands mediate trophic effects in a TrkA-dependent manner, because no concentration or combination of NGF and antibody could induce significant protection of B104 cells (TrkA−, p75+++) (data not shown). TrkA tyrosine phosphorylation (TrkA-Tyr(P)) was studied as a biochemical correlate of cell survival in SFM (Fig.4). Analysis was done by Western blotting with mAb 4G10 against phosphotyrosine (total Tyr(P)), or with antibodies against phosphorylated tyrosine 490 of TrkA (Tyr(P)490), which is the Shc binding site of TrkA. A representative Western blot of total Tyr(P) is shown in Fig.4 A. Statistical analysis of densitometry for several blots of total TrkA-Tyr(P) (Fig. 4 B, upper panel), and for several blots of TrkA-Tyr(P)490(Fig. 4 B, lower panel) were used to quantify the TrkA-Tyr(P) data. Western blotting with anti-TrkA antibodies, done in parallel, demonstrated that all lanes contained the same amount of receptor (data not shown). Monovalent 5C3 Fabs induce"
https://openalex.org/W2137375900,"The cyclooxygenases (COX)-1 and COX-2 are key enzymes in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins and other eicosanoids. Whereas COX-1 is expressed ubiquitously, COX-2 is an immediate-early gene often associated with malignant transformation, and a role for the COX enzymes in tumor initiation and promotion is discussed. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin and indomethacin that block COX-1 and -2 have been shown to have beneficial effects for tumor patients. Therefore, these compounds have gained interest also among oncologists. However, the molecular mechanism by which NSAIDs inhibit carcinogenesis is not clearly understood. The prostaglandin-dependent and -independent effect may both account for their antineoplastic action. We show here that tumor cells derived from different tumors regularly produce prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) interfering with the function of monocytes. In particular, PGE(2) inhibits the potential of monocytes to migrate in the direction of a chemotactic stimulus and to adhere to endothelial cell. This inhibition is most probably due to a modulation of the chemokine receptor CCR5 and the beta2-integrin Mac-1. Both down-regulation of CCR5 and reduced expression of Mac-1 may diminish the potential of peripheral blood monocytes to leave blood vessels and invade target tissues. Since both dysfunctions can be restored with NSAIDs, our findings help to explain the molecular chemopreventive action of NSAIDs on tumor formation and progression."
https://openalex.org/W1551259784,"Nitric oxide (NO) reduces the severity of pulmonary vascular disease in rats as do elastase inhibitors. We therefore hypothesized that NO inhibits elastase by suppressing mitogen-activated protein kinases that trans-activate AML1B, a transcription factor for elastase. We used cultured pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells in which serum-treated elastin (STE) induces a > threefold increase in elastase activity as evaluated by solubilization of [3H]-elastin. NO donors (SNAP and DETA NONO-ate) inhibited elastase in a dose-dependent manner as did a cGMP mimetic (8-pCPT-cGMP). SNAP inhibition of elastase was reversed by coadministration of a cGMP-PKG inhibitor (Rp-8-pCPT-cGMP). The STE-induced increase in phospho-ERK was suppressed by NO donors and the cGMP mimetic, and reversed by cGMP-PKG inhibitor, as was expression of AML1B and DNA binding in nuclear extracts. A concomitant increase in p38 phosphorylation was also inhibited by SNAP, but whereas MEK inhibitor (PD98059) suppressed elastase and AML1B-DNA binding, a p38 inhibitor (SB202190) did not.

It is a novel transport system that requires only the thylakoidal ΔpH to power translocation. Several substrates of the Delta pH pathway, including the intermediate precursor form of OE17 (iOE17) and the truncated precursor form of OE17 (tOE17), were shown to bind to the membrane in the absence of the ΔpH and be transported into the lumen when the ΔpH was restored. Binding occurred without energy or soluble factors, and efficient transport from the bound state (∼80–90%) required only the ΔpH. Binding is due to protein-protein interactions because protease pretreatment of thylakoids destroyed their binding capability. Precursors are bound to a specific site on the Delta pH pathway because binding was competed by saturating amounts of Delta pH pathway precursor proteins, but not by a Sec pathway precursor protein. These results suggested that precursor tOE17 binds to components of the Delta pathway translocation machinery. Hcf106 and Tha4 are two components of the Delta pH pathway machinery. Antibodies to Hcf106 or Tha4, when prebound to thylakoids, specifically inhibited precursor transport on the Delta pH pathway. However, only Hcf106 antibodies reduced the level of precursor binding.

OE33, and OE23, the 17-, 33-, and 23-kDa components of the oxygen evolving complex iOE33/OE23/OE17, and tOE23/OE17, precursor, intermediate precursor, and truncated precursor forms of OE33/OE23/OE17 carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis In plants, the photochemical reactions leading to ATP and reducing power take place on the thylakoid membranes within the chloroplast. Thylakoids contain well over 100 polypeptides, most of which are nuclear-encoded and synthesized in the cytosol as precursor proteins with transient amino-terminal transit peptides (see Ref. 1.Keegstra K. Cline K. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 557-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar for review). For a thylakoid lumen protein, its transit peptide consists of two parts: 1) a stroma-targeting domain, and 2) a lumen-targeting domain. The stroma-targeting domain governs import of the precursor across the chloroplast envelope and is cleaved by a processing protease in the stroma, resulting in an intermediate precursor. The exposed lumen-targeting domain directs thylakoid translocation and is cleaved by a lumen-facing processing protease.There appears to be one major pathway for protein import across the chloroplast envelope. However, there are two pathways for protein transport into the thylakoid lumen (1.Keegstra K. Cline K. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 557-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 2.Settles A.M.

Sci. 1999; 24: 17-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). One pathway is called the thylakoid Sec pathway because this pathway uses chloroplast homologues of bacterial SecA, SecY, and SecE proteins (4.Nakai M. Goto A. Nohara T. Sugita D. Endo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31338-31341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Yuan J. Henry R. McCaffery M. Cline K. Science. 1994; 266: 796-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 6.Mori H.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12177-12182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A second pathway is called the Delta pH pathway because, for this pathway, the ΔpH across the thylakoid membrane is the only energy requirement for protein transport. Each pathway is specific for a subset of precursor proteins.The Delta pH pathway was first recognized as a distinct transport pathway when it was found that certain precursors, specifically OE171 and OE23, uniquely require neither soluble protein factors nor NTPs for transport but only the trans-thylakoid ΔpH (8.Cline K. Ettinger W.F. Theg S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2688-2696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A requirement for specific translocation machinery was demonstrated by precursor competition studies (9.Cline K. Henry R. Li C.J. Yuan J.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and by the demonstration that protease treatment of thylakoids destroys their ability to transport Delta pH pathway substrates (10.Robinson D. Karnauchov I. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. Robinson C. Plant J. 1996; 10: 149-155Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Two thylakoid proteins, Hcf106 and Tha4, were recently identified as components involved in transport on the Delta pH pathway (6.Mori H. Summer L. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 11.Settles A.M. Yonetani A. Baron A. Bush D.R. Cline K. Martienssen R.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and several components of a homologous system have been identified in bacteria (13.Bogsch E.G. Sargent F. Stanley N.R.

Cell. 1998; 93: 93-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). However, neither the mechanism of Delta pH pathway transport nor the function of its components is known with any certainty. One limitation has been that intermediate steps of the process have not been identified.In this study, we have identified a bound intermediate on the pathway. Certain truncated Delta pH pathway precursors bound tightly to the thylakoid membrane in the absence of the ΔpH and were transported into the lumen when the ΔpH was restored. The characteristics of precursor binding and the subsequent chase of bound precursor suggest that the precursor is binding to a component of the transport machinery. Antibodies to Hcf106 reduced the extent of binding, whereas antibodies to Tha4 had no effect on binding. These results suggest that precursor binding represents the first committed step of the Delta pH pathway.DISCUSSIONBecause protein transport on the Delta pH pathway requires no stromal components, it has been assumed that recognition and initial interaction with the translocation machinery occur on the membrane. Previous attempts to trap a bound intermediate on the thylakoids were unsuccessful. Such attempts were largely confined to the most commonly studied substrate, iOE23, which displays very little if any stable binding to the thylakoids (Ref. 22.Brock I.W. Mills J.D. Robinson D. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1657-1662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar; Fig. 3). By surveying a range of Delta pH pathway substrates, we identified several substrates, most of them recombinant, that bind strongly to thylakoids when the pH gradient is dissipated.Tight binding occurred between precursor and thylakoids in the absence of the pH gradient, in the absence of stroma, and in the absence of NTPs (Fig. 1). It occurred equally well at low temperature and at 25 °C. Thus, there is no apparent energy requirement for strong interaction with the membrane. This differs from precursor interaction with the chloroplast envelope machinery, in which low affinity binding occurs in the absence of energy (19.Kouranov A. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1677-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and tight binding requires NTPs and involves insertion into the translocon (1.Keegstra K. Cline K. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 557-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that binding of Delta pH pathway precursors involves insertion into the putative translocon because the rate of transport from the bound state was not significantly faster than transport of freshly added precursors. This would suggest that there is an additional slow step on the membrane before the protein begins to appear in the lumen.If bound precursor is to be considered a true intermediate of the targeting pathway, it should exhibit several characteristics. First, it should proceed into the lumen when favorable conditions are restored. tOE17, iOE17, DT23, and DT17 exhibited productive binding (Fig. 3). Secondly, binding should be specific. Although we have not examined the interactions with a range of membranes, we have assayed for the ability of tOE17 to bind to the envelope membrane of intact chloroplast and found that binding to be extremely low. 4X. Ma and K. Cline, unpublished observations. Competition experiments (Fig. 6) indicate that productive binding is to a specific site on the thylakoids, a site associated with the Delta pH pathway (Fig. 6).In our study, the precursors that bound most strongly are not the physiological intermediates that occur in chloroplasts. However, we do not think that the observed binding is nonphysiological. Rather, we believe that binding of tOE17, DT23, and DT17 represents a stronger variation of the physiological process for several reasons. First, these substrates are translocated strictly on the Delta pH pathway (Fig. 1; Ref. 16.Henry R. Carrigan M. McCaffery M. Ma X.Y. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In fact, when DT23 was used as a competitor of thylakoid protein transport, it very effectively competed for substrates of the Delta pH pathway, but it had no effect on the transport of the Sec pathway substrate, iOE33.4 Second, substrates that productively bind are more rapidly and efficiently transported than substrates that exhibit low levels of binding (Fig.2).4 Finally, at least two authentic Delta pH pathway intermediates, iOE17 and iPftf, bind to thylakoids. The physiological intermediate iOE17 binds to thylakoids, is transported from the bound state (Fig. 3), and exhibits all of the characteristics of binding and chase that were shown for tOE17 (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). Also, in a recent study, we showed that integration of the membrane protein Pftf is mediated by the Delta pH pathway. 5E. J. Summer, H. Mori, A. M. Settles, and K. Cline, submitted for publication. When Pftf integration was inhibited by dissipating the ΔpH, the physiological intermediate iPftf specifically bound to thylakoids.5The precise meaning of anti-Hcf106 inhibition of tOE17 binding is not yet clear. The fact that other thylakoid-binding antibodies (6.Mori H. Summer L. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) had no effect says that it is not antibody coating of the membrane surfaceper se that was inhibitory, but rather antibody binding to Hcf106 that was important. Although the lack of effect of anti-Tha4 antibodies does not rule out Tha4 involvement in precursor binding, the reproducible inhibition by anti-Hcf016 argues that the Hcf106 protein plays some role in the binding process. One possibility is that Hcf106 directly binds the precursor. It has been suggested, based on its membrane topology, that Hcf106 functions as a receptor (11.Settles A.M. Yonetani A. Baron A. Bush D.R. Cline K. Martienssen R. Science. 1997; 278: 1467-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Hcf106 and the homologous Tha4 are anchored in the thylakoids by single amino-proximal transmembrane helices, exposing larger carboxyl-terminal domains to the stroma. Indeed, the ability of anti-Hcf106 to inhibit binding and transport of precursors is analogous to the effects of antibodies to the chloroplast import receptor Toc159 (formally Toc86) on precursor binding and import into the chloroplast (23.Hirsch S. Muckel E. Heemeyer F. von Heijne G. Soll J. Science. 1994; 266: 1989-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be determined whether Hcf106 makes direct contact with Delta pH pathway precursors, in particular with their signal peptides.Another possibility is that Hcf106 is a component of a translocation complex and that antibody binding to any member of the complex impairs the ability of the machinery to interact with precursors. In fact, recent studies in our laboratory suggest that Hcf106 plays some role in translocation other than or in addition to signal peptide recognition. Specifically, a form of Pftf that lacks its signal peptide still depends on Hcf106 for its integration.5 If this latter model is correct, it might explain the incomplete inhibition of binding by anti-Hcf106 compared with the complete inhibition of transport (Fig.7). Resolving the precise role of Hcf106 either as a receptor or in some other aspect of the targeting and translocation process can now be addressed as a result of studies reported here. In plants, the photochemical reactions leading to ATP and reducing power take place on the thylakoid membranes within the chloroplast. Thylakoids contain well over 100 polypeptides, most of which are nuclear-encoded and synthesized in the cytosol as precursor proteins with transient amino-terminal transit peptides (see Ref. 1.Keegstra K.

The stroma-targeting domain governs import of the precursor across the chloroplast envelope and is cleaved by a processing protease in the stroma, resulting in an intermediate precursor. The exposed lumen-targeting domain directs thylakoid translocation and is cleaved by a lumen-facing processing protease. There appears to be one major pathway for protein import across the chloroplast envelope. However, there are two pathways for protein transport into the thylakoid lumen (1.Keegstra K. Cline K.

In fact, when DT23 was used as a competitor of thylakoid protein transport, it very effectively competed for substrates of the Delta pH pathway, but it had no effect on the transport of the Sec pathway substrate, iOE33.4 Second, substrates that productively bind are more rapidly and efficiently transported than substrates that exhibit low levels of binding (Fig.2).4 Finally, at least two authentic Delta pH pathway intermediates, iOE17 and iPftf, bind to thylakoids. The physiological intermediate iOE17 binds to thylakoids, is transported from the bound state (Fig. 3), and exhibits all of the characteristics of binding and chase that were shown for tOE17 (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). Also, in a recent study, we showed that integration of the membrane protein Pftf is mediated by the Delta pH pathway. 5E. J. Summer, H. Mori, A. M. Settles, and K. Cline, submitted for publication. When Pftf integration was inhibited by dissipating the ΔpH, the physiological intermediate iPftf specifically bound to thylakoids.5 The precise meaning of anti-Hcf106 inhibition of tOE17 binding is not yet clear. The fact that other thylakoid-binding antibodies (6.Mori H. Summer L. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) had no effect says that it is not antibody coating of the membrane surfaceper se that was inhibitory, but rather antibody binding to Hcf106 that was important. Although the lack of effect of anti-Tha4 antibodies does not rule out Tha4 involvement in precursor binding, the reproducible inhibition by anti-Hcf016 argues that the Hcf106 protein plays some role in the binding process. One possibility is that Hcf106 directly binds the precursor. It has been suggested, based on its membrane topology, that Hcf106 functions as a receptor (11.Settles A.M. Yonetani A. Baron A. Bush D.R. Cline K. Martienssen R. Science. 1997; 278: 1467-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Hcf106 and the homologous Tha4 are anchored in the thylakoids by single amino-proximal transmembrane helices, exposing larger carboxyl-terminal domains to the stroma. Indeed, the ability of anti-Hcf106 to inhibit binding and transport of precursors is analogous to the effects of antibodies to the chloroplast import receptor Toc159 (formally Toc86) on precursor binding and import into the chloroplast (23.Hirsch S. Muckel E. Heemeyer F. von Heijne G. Soll J. Science. 1994; 266: 1989-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be determined whether Hcf106 makes direct contact with Delta pH pathway precursors, in particular with their signal peptides. Another possibility is that Hcf106 is a component of a translocation complex and that antibody binding to any member of the complex impairs the ability of the machinery to interact with precursors. In fact, recent studies in our laboratory suggest that Hcf106 plays some role in translocation other than or in addition to signal peptide recognition. Specifically, a form of Pftf that lacks its signal peptide still depends on Hcf106 for its integration.5 If this latter model is correct, it might explain the incomplete inhibition of binding by anti-Hcf106 compared with the complete inhibition of transport (Fig.7). Resolving the precise role of Hcf106 either as a receptor or in some other aspect of the targeting and translocation process can now be addressed as a result of studies reported here.

The Xer site-specific recombination system uses two related tyrosine recombinases, XerC and XerD, to catalyze resolution of circular dimers at the chromosomal site, dif. A 33-base pair DNA fragment containing the 28-base pair minimal difsite is sufficient for the recombinases to mediate both inter- and intramolecular site-specific recombination in vivo. We show that Xer-mediated intermolecular recombination in vitrobetween nicked linear dif “suicide” substrates and supercoiled plasmid DNA containing dif is initiated by XerC. Furthermore, on the appropriate substrate, the nicked Holliday junction intermediate formed by XerC is converted to a linear product by a subsequent single XerD-mediated strand exchange. We also demonstrate that a XerC homologue from Pseudomonas aeruginosa stimulates strand cleavage by XerD on a nicked linear substrate and promotes initiation of strand exchange by XerD in an intermolecular reaction between linear and supercoiled DNA, thereby reversing the normal order of strand exchanges.

Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 199-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Homologous recombination between replicating or newly replicated circular replicons may produce chromosome dimers that cannot be segregated to daughter cells during cell division. In Escherichia coli, the Xer site-specific recombination system ensures that dimeric chromosomes are converted to monomers prior to cell division (2.Blakely G. Colloms S. May G. Burke M. Sherratt D.

The Xer system consists of a 28-bp1 recombination core site, dif, and two related tyrosine recombinases, XerC and XerD, that share 37% amino acid identity (4.Blakely G. May G. McCulloch R.

The dif site is present in the terminus of replication and consists of two 11-bp half-sites related by dyad symmetry and separated by a 6-bp central region that delineates the positions of strand cleavage and exchange (13.Blakely G.W. Davidson A.O. Sherratt D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 30-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). XerC binds to the left half-site where it cleaves and exchanges the top strand, whereas XerD binds to the right half-site and cleaves the bottom strand; binding of both recombinases is highly cooperative (4.Blakely G. May G. McCulloch R. Arciszewska L.K. Burke M. Lovett S.T. Sherratt D.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 351-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 14.Blakely G. Sherratt D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 762-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). XerC and XerD act incis, with each recombinase cleaving a strand of the DNA site to which it is bound (13.Blakely G.W.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2112-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A 33-bp fragment containing the minimal 28-bp dif site is also sufficient to enable both inter- and intramolecular Xer-mediated site-specific recombination in vivo (2.Blakely G. Colloms S. May G. Burke M. Sherratt D. New Biol. 1991; 3: 789-798PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Tecklenburg M. Naumer A. Nagappan O. Kuempel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Xer recombination at dif sites present in the chromosome or in plasmids, however, is dependent on cell division and requires the septum-specific protein, FtsK (18.Steiner W.W. Kuempel P.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 19.Steiner W.W. Liu G. Donachie W.D. Kuempel P. Mol.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5724-5734Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). FtsK localizes to the invaginating septum during cell division in a FtsZ-dependent manner and appears to have a dual role in chromosome segregation and septal ring constriction (21.Liu G. Draper G.C. Donachie W.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Xer site-specific recombination is also involved in the stability of naturally occurring plasmids, such as ColE1 and pSC101, by ensuring that plasmid multimers are converted to monomers (22.Summers D.K. Sherratt D.J. Cell. 1984; 36: 1097-1103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 23.Cornet F. Mortier I. Patte J. Louarn J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3188-3195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These plasmid-borne recombination sites consist of a core site, to which XerC and XerD bind, and ∼180 bp of adjacent upstream accessory sequences to which additional accessory sequence proteins bind (24.Stirling C.J. Szatmari G. Stewart G. Smith M.C.M. Sherratt D.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4389-4395Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 25.Colloms S.D. Bath J. Sherratt D.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 855-864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Recombination at the pSC101 psi site occurs by sequential strand exchanges by XerC and XerD, respectively, whereas on the ColE1cer site, only XerC-mediated Holliday junction (HJ) intermediate formation has been observed (26.Colloms S.D. McCulloch R. Grant K. Neilson L. Sherratt D.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1172-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Interwrapping of accessory DNA sequences around the accessory proteins leads to a nucleoprotein complex of specific topology that can only assemble on and recombine directly repeated sites present in the same DNA molecule, thereby ensuring that recombination is preferentially intramolecular. This synaptic complex may also dictate in part that XerC-mediated strand exchange occurs first (26.Colloms S.D. McCulloch R. Grant K. Neilson L. Sherratt D.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1172-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Site-specific recombination mediated by λ Int also proceeds by a pair of ordered strand exchanges that lead to the formation of an HJ intermediate and its subsequent resolution to recombinant product (reviewed in Ref. 27.Landy A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The controlling factors that dictate which strand exchange will occur first, during both integrative and excisive recombination, have been ascribed to asymmetry produced by accessory proteins bound at the distal arm sites in the intasome (28.Nunes-Düby S.E. Matsumoto L. Landy A. Cell. 1987; 50: 779-788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 29.Kitts P.A. Nash H.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A preferential order of strand exchanges can also occur on core recombination sites in the absence of accessory proteins. For example, action of Haemophilus influenzae XerC and E. coli XerD on supercoiled molecules containing two dif sites leads to sequential strand exchange by H. influenzae XerC and E. coliXerD (30.Neilson L. Blakely G. Sherratt D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 915-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this report we describe an in vitro assay that has allowed us to determine that strand exchange by E. coli XerC and XerD at dif is also initiated by XerC and that, on the appropriate substrate, the nicked HJ intermediate formed by XerC is converted to linear product by a single XerD-mediated strand exchange. We also demonstrate that a XerC homologue from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaXerC) stimulates strand cleavage by XerD on a nicked linear substrate and promotes initiation of strand exchange by XerD during intermolecular recombination between linear and supercoiled DNA. Binding of recombinases to DNA fragments was performed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml poly(dI-dC) (0.95 to 8 kilobases; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and ∼0.1 pmol of labeled DNA for 10 min at 37 °C, prior to electrophoresis through 6% polyacrylamide in 1× TBE buffer at 4 °C (13.Blakely G.W. Davidson A.O. Sherratt D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 30-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Wild-type XerC, XerD, and PaXerC were purified by metal ion affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) followed by fast protein liquid chromatography on MonoS columns as described previously (26.Colloms S.D. McCulloch R. Grant K. Neilson L. Sherratt D.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1172-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Maltose-binding protein fusions were prepared as suggested by the protocol from New England Biolabs. Synthetic oligonucleotides containing dif were based on the following sequences (13.Blakely G.W. Davidson A.O. Sherratt D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 30-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar): top strand, 5′GGGGATCCTCTAGATTGGTGCGCATAATGTATATTATGTTAAATCAGTCGACCTGCAGGC and bottom strand, 5′GCCTGCAGGTCGACTGATTTAACATAATATACATTATGCGCACCAATCTAGAGGATCCCC. The dif core site is underlined, with the central region sequence given in bold type. Oligonucleotides were 5′-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase with [γ32P]ATP before annealing and purification by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Suicide substrates were constructed by annealing two oligonucleotides, corresponding to left and right halves (30 nt each) of core sites to an oligonucleotide corresponding to the appropriate complete top or bottom strand (60 nt). The resulting substrate contained a nick in either the top or bottom strand of the core site central region. XerC and XerD (final concentrations of ∼400 nm for each) were added to ∼0.1 pmol of labeled substrate in binding buffer (as above) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Reactions were halved; one half was electrophoresed through 6% polyacrylamide under nondenaturing conditions in 1× TBE buffer, and the other half was treated with SDS and EDTA to give final concentrations of 0.1% and 1 mm, respectively. SDS-treated samples were separated by electrophoresis through 6% polyacrylamide + 0.1% SDS in 1× TBE buffer containing 0.1% SDS (13.Blakely G.W. Davidson A.O. Sherratt D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 30-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Standard reactions contained 200 ng of supercoiled pMIN33 (2.Blakely G. Colloms S. May G. Burke M. Sherratt D. New Biol. 1991; 3: 789-798PubMed Google Scholar), 2 pmol of radiolabeled suicide substrate, and recombinases at a concentration of ∼400 nm each in a volume of 40 μl. Reaction buffer contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h before addition of SDS and proteinase K to final concentrations of 0.1% and 0.4 mg ml−1, respectively, followed by electrophoresis through 0.7% agarose in 1× TBE and 0.1% SDS. Gels were subsequently stained with ethidium bromide to visualize plasmid DNA and then dried and exposed to x-ray film. Protein-DNA covalent complexes were precipitated with SDS and KCl as described previously (31.Trask D.K. DiDonato J.A. Muller M.T. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Efficient recombination in vivo between dif sites shows a requirement for the C terminus of the septum-located protein, FtsK (19.Steiner W.W. Liu G. Donachie W.D. Kuempel P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 20.Recchia G.D. Aroya M. Wolf D. Blakely G. Sherratt D.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5724-5734Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Probably as a consequence of this requirement, we have been unable to detect recombinant products resulting from both pairs of strand exchanges between direct repeats of dif when present in a supercoiled plasmid after reaction with E. coli Xer recombinasesin vitro (26.Colloms S.D. McCulloch R. Grant K. Neilson L. Sherratt D.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1172-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To study strand exchange at dif, we modified an in vitro assay developed for λ Int that allows detection of partial and complete recombinant products formed during reactions between linear, nicked dif suicide substrates and dif sites present in supercoiled plasmid DNA (28.Nunes-Düby S.E. Matsumoto L. Landy A. Cell. 1987; 50: 779-788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). For a given linear substrate with a nick in either the top or bottom strand there are several possible outcomes of cleavage and strand exchange with a plasmid-borne dif site. These outcomes depend on which DNA strand contains the nick and which strands are cleaved and exchanged first. Examples of reactions in which XerC initiates top strand exchange on substrates nicked on either top or bottom strands are shown in a schematic (Fig.1). Catalysis by XerC on a top strand nicked suicide substrate (dT3) synapsed with a dif core site in a plasmid (pMIN33) would lead to cleavages of both top strands and the loss of a trinucleotide from the suicide substrate. The presence of an appropriately positioned free 5′ OH in the cleaved plasmid site would allow a single, potentially reversible, non-reciprocal strand exchange from the plasmid to the suicide substrate. The loss of the trinucleotide would ensure that a XerC monomer remains covalently linked to the plasmid DNA, because no adjacent 5′ OH is available for in-line attack on the covalent complex. XerC-mediated exchange of the top strands from the bottom strand nicked suicide substrate (dB3) with the top strand of the plasmid-bornedif site (Fig. 1 B) would generate an HJ-containing molecule in which the bottom strand was nicked. This HJ would then be a substrate for a pair of XerD-mediated cleavages and a subsequent single strand exchange by XerD. The XerD-mediated resolution of the HJ intermediate would produce a linear, nicked product containing a covalently linked XerD monomer. Note that only a single strand exchange occurs because one cleavage will generate a 3-nucleotide product that should diffuse away. This product could, in principle, be converted back to the HJ intermediate by XerD. If XerD-mediated strand exchange had occurred first in any of these reactions, then substrate dB3 would generate a single, non-reciprocal strand exchange, whereas substrate dT3 would produce one pair of XerD-mediated strand exchanges followed by a single XerC-mediated exchange. Reactions containing XerC and XerD, a radiolabeled difsuicide substrate, and supercoiled pMIN33 were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h before treatment with SDS and proteinase K, followed by analysis using agarose gel electrophoresis. The products of a single strand exchange or one pair of strand exchanges are expected to migrate at a position similar to that of open circular plasmid (the presence of covalently bound protein or an HJ should not significantly influence mobility on these agarose gels). Products arising from strand exchange between a nicked substrate and a supercoiled plasmid should have lost their supercoiling because of the strand discontinuity. Products resulting from sequential top and bottom strand exchanges will be linear and migrate similarly to linear plasmid DNA. Mobilities of radiolabeled recombinant products were confirmed by comparison to plasmid DNA stained with ethidium bromide and radiolabeled size markers (Fig. 2 C). Electrophoretic analysis of products from reaction of XerC and XerD with a top strand nicked suicide substrate (dT3; Fig. 2 A) and pMIN33 gave rise to a single product band that migrated in a position similar to open circular plasmid (Fig. 2 B,lane 2), consistent with it having arisen from either a single strand exchange mediated by XerC or one pair of strand exchanges mediated by XerD. This product represented conversion of 12% of the suicide substrate to recombinant product. The relative inefficiency of this reaction is probably related to the in vivo requirement for FtsK bound at the invaginating septum during division, a process that cannot be reconstituted at this time. Because we cannot differentiate between strand exchanges mediated by each recombinase in this reaction, XerD was replaced with XerDR148K, which is defective in bottom strand cleavage on nicked linear substrates as a consequence of substitution of a catalytic arginine, thus allowing us to determine the amount of strand exchange mediated by XerC. A single product migrating as open circular plasmid was detected in the reaction containing XerC and XerDR148K, the amount of which was equivalent to that produced in the presence of wild-type XerD (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). Reactions containing catalytically inactive XerCY275F and wild-type XerD gave no detectable products (data not shown). We conclude that XerC catalyzes a single strand exchange between the plasmid and dT3 to form the covalent complex described in the schematic (Fig.1 A). This conclusion is supported by our ability to affinity purify reaction products containing maltose-binding protein fusions of XerC (data not shown) and to precipitate the radiolabeled reaction products with SDS and KCl (Fig. 2 D; Ref. 31.Trask D.K. DiDonato J.A. Muller M.T. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Precipitation of reactions containing either XerC and XerD or XerC and XerDR148K with substrate dT3 gave two products, one representing the suicide substrate covalently linked to XerC and the other representing the recombinant product (Fig. 2 D, lanes 2 and 3). Precipitation of reactions containing XerC and XerD with dB3 also gave rise to the expected covalent complexes of the suicide substrate with XerD and the recombinant product (Fig. 2 D, lane 5). Note that the smear running above the recombinant product inlane 5 is of unknown origin. The reaction of XerC and XerDR148K with dB3 gave no products that could be precipitated with SDS and KCl, demonstrating that the HJ-containing molecule observed from the recombination reaction did not contain a covalently linked recombinase (Fig. 2 D, lane 6). To confirm that XerC initiates catalysis in this intermolecular assay, reactions of XerC and XerD with a bottom strand nicked suicide substrate (dB3; Fig. 2 A) and pMIN33 were analyzed. Two products were detected from this reaction (Fig. 2 B,lane 5). The major product migrated at a position similar to linear plasmid DNA, consistent with it having arisen from a pair of XerC-mediated strand exchanges followed by a single strand exchange catalyzed by XerD. The minor product migrated at a position similar to open circular DNA and could thus have arisen from either a pair of XerC-mediated strand exchanges or a single strand exchange by XerD. Reaction of XerC and XerDR148K with dB3 and pMIN33 led to normal levels of the circular product but abolished the linear product (Fig.2 B, lane 6), consistent with XerC initiating catalysis to generate an HJ-containing circle that is a substrate for a single XerD-mediated strand exchange. Incubation of XerC or XerD alone with these DNA substrates did not produce any evidence of strand exchange under these reaction conditions (data not shown). To test whether intermolecular recombination could occur between radiolabeled, un-nicked linear dif DNA and supercoiled pMIN33, we performed reactions using XerC and XerD or XerC and XerDR148K. Both reactions generated single bands that correspond to circular products arising from one pair of XerC-mediated strand exchanges (Fig. 2 B, lanes 8 and 9). These presumptive HJ-containing intermediates will have lost their supercoiling as a consequence of branch migration of the HJ to one end of the molecule. Note that in this assay and in those using nicked linear substrates, the majority of the plasmid molecules in a reaction remain supercoiled after 16 h of incubation (Fig.2 C). To confirm that the products detected in these intermolecular assays resulted from strand exchange that rejoins the linear radiolabeled DNA strand to the plasmid-borne dif site and were therefore true products of Xer site-specific recombination, reactions were analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis. Analysis of reactions of XerC and XerD with radiolabeled dT3 substrate demonstrated the presence of a 65-nt fragment after digestion with HindIII. This is the predicted size of the fragment resulting from exchange of dif top strands by XerC (Fig. 3, lane 3). Similarly, HindIII digestion of a bottom strand nicked substrate radiolabeled on its top strand (dT60) produced a 65-nt fragment, consistent with sequential catalysis by XerC and XerD (Fig.3, lane 6). EcoRI digestion of reactions containing bottom strand-labeled dB3 generated a 74-nt fragment. This is the expected size of a fragment resulting from the exchange of a bottom strand by XerD (Fig. 3, lane 9). As expected, no XerD-mediated exchange product was detected for reactions containing a top strand nicked substrate in which the bottom strand was radiolabeled (dB60; Fig. 3, lane 12). These results are the first demonstration of an in vitrointermolecular recombination reaction mediated by E. coliXerC and XerD at dif, albeit with a non-physiological substrate. Products that arise from catalysis by both XerC and XerD are derived exclusively from sequential events in which an initial pair of strand exchanges by XerC are followed by XerD resolution of a nicked HJ intermediate. XerC is able to mediate intermolecular strand exchange in the absence of XerD catalytic activity and can use either nicked or un-nicked top strands as substrates for the reaction. Why does substrate dB3 allow both strand exchanges to occur, whereas the other two substrates only allow XerC-mediated top strand exchange? The products of XerC-catalyzed strand exchange between un-nicked T60 substrate and plasmid should be HJ-containing molecules, which, in principle, could be substrates for catalysis by XerD. The only difference between HJs derived from dB3, which undergo catalysis by XerD, and those from T60, which do not undergo XerD-mediated catalysis, is the presence of the nick on the dB3 bottom strand. We assume that the nick in the bottom strand of the HJ assists the molecule in adopting a conformation that allows XerD catalysis, whereas those without a nick are unable to adopt a conformation suitable for catalysis by XerD. Synthetic HJs derived from linear oligonucleotides are very poor substrates for XerD but are recombined efficiently by XerC, apparently because the top strands adopt a conformation favored for catalysis by XerC (32.Arciszewska L.K. Grainge I. Sherratt D.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3731-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 33.Azaro M.A. Landy A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3744-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The sss gene fromP. aeruginosa was originally isolated as a plasmid-encoded DNA fragment that complemented a mutation in a strain defective for pyoverdin production in the presence of Zn2+ (34.Höfte M. Dong Q. Kourambas S. Krishnapillai V. Sherratt D. Mergeay M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 1011-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Analysis of the predicted protein sequence demonstrated that it is a member of the tyrosine recombinase family with substantial homology to theE. coli proteins XerC (49% identity) and XerD (39% identity) (Fig. 4 A). Hereafter, we refer to this protein as PaXerC. To determine whether PaXerC is a functional homologue of the E. coli XerC (or XerD), we overexpressed and partially purified the protein. Radiolabeled DNA substrates containing the E. coli difsequence were used in gel retardation assays to ascertain whether PaXerC could interact cooperatively with either of the E. coli recombinases (Fig. 4 B). XerC and XerD are able to bind dif in the absence of their respective partner recombinase (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2 and 3), with binding of both recombinases to dif being highly cooperative (Fig. 4 B, lane 4; Ref. 14.Blakely G. Sherratt D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 762-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Incubation of PaXerC alone with dif DNA produced no detectable protein-DNA complex (Fig. 4 B; lane 5), but a mixture of XerD and PaXerC produced a complex corresponding to occupation of both half-sites (Fig. 4 B, lane 6). This interaction is highly cooperative, because >90% of the substrate is bound at a concentration of PaXerC that does not show detectable binding of dif in the absence of XerD. The decreased mobility of the PaXerC-XerD dif complex, compared with the XerC-XerD dif complex, is suggestive of increased bending within the recombinase-DNA complex. PaXerC does not show cooperative interaction with XerC bound to dif (data not shown). We conclude that XerC and PaXerC are homologues that have common functional domains responsible for cooperative interactions with XerD. Recombinases XerC and XerD can cleave nicked, linear difsuicide substrates in vitro to generate recombinase-DNA covalent complexes that can be detected using denaturing gel electrophoresis. In standard reactions containing both recombinases, XerC efficiently cleaves the top strand of dif, converting 60–70% of the substrate to covalent complex after 1 h at 37 °C. Cleavage of dif bottom strands by XerD is considerably less efficient, converting approximately 1% of substrate to covalent complex (13.Blakely G.W. Davidson A.O. Sherratt D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 30-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 14.Blakely G. Sherratt D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 762-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The preference for XerC catalysis may reflect the preferred order of strand exchange. Neither recombinase is able to cleave DNA efficiently in the absence of its partner, demonstrating that protein-protein interactions are important for determining which monomers are catalytically active in a synapse (13.Blakely G.W. Davidson A.O. Sherratt D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 30-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To confirm that PaXerC is a site-specific recombinase capable of cleaving DNA, dif suicide substrates containing nicks either in the top or bottom strands were used. To assist in determining which recombinase was responsible for cleaving either top or bottom strands, we employed mixtures of wild-type proteins and maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusions as differential size markers so that complexes of each protein with DNA could be distinguished during electrophoresis (14.Blakely G. Sherratt D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 762-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). At the protein concentrations used, >95% of the DNA substrate was recombinase-bound (data not shown). Incubation of PaXerC and XerD-MBP with a top strand nicked substrate (dT3) produced a complex that migrated behind the substrate in a position equivalent to one monomer of wild-type PaXerC covalently linked to the DNA (Fig. 5 A,lane 2). The increased retardation of the covalent complex from a reaction containing PaXerC-MBP plus wild-type XerD with dT3 confirmed that PaXerC was responsible for cleaving top strands (Fig.5 A, lane 3). The analogous experiments using a bottom strand nicked substrate (dB3) demonstrated that XerD was competent for bottom strand cleavage in the presence of PaXerC. A dramatic feature of these reactions was that XerD cleavage ofdif was greatly stimulated in the presence of PaXerC and converted 40% of the substrate to covalent complex in 1 h, compared with 1% in the presence of XerC (Fig. 5 B). The amount of PaXerC covalent complex (3% of substrate) was also approximately 20-fold lower in comparison to reactions containing XerC (Fig. 5 B; Ref. 5.Argos P. Landy A. Abremski K. Egan J.B. Haggard-Lundquist E. Hoess R.H. Kahn M.L. Kalionis B. Narayana S.V.L. Pierson L.S. Sternberg N. Leong J.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar and data not shown). Therefore, the combination of PaXerC and XerD on dB3 leads to a reciprocal stimulation of strand cleavage by XerD and impairment of strand cleavage by its (Pa)XerC partner. This stimulation of partner,impairment of self-catalysis (SPIS) phenotype has also been observed to result from other mutations in XerC and XerD and is thought to result from altered XerC-XerD interactions (35.Hallet B. Arciszewska L.K. Sherratt D.J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 949-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The SPIS phenotype of PaXerC is not observed on dT3, implying that DNA conformation and alterations in XerC-XerD interactions can influence which recombinase acts first. Previous work with λ Int, Flp, and Cre, as well as with XerCD, has implicated DNA conformation in the presence of recombinases as being a major influence in determining which particular recombinases are catalytically active (12.Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Nature. 1997; 389: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 32.Arciszewska L.K. Grainge I. Sherratt D.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3731-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 33.Azaro M.A. Landy A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3744-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Having shown that PaXerC stimulates XerD strand cleavage on a nicked linear substrate, we tested the consequences of mixing PaXerC with XerD in the intermolecular recombination assay. Addition of PaXerC-MBP and XerD to dT3 and pMIN33 gave rise to a single product that represented conversion of 1% of suicide substrate to recombinant product (Fig.6, lane 2). The product was confirmed as a single top strand exchange mediated by PaXerC when XerD was replaced with the cleavage-deficient XerDR148K (Fig. 6, lane 3). Reaction of dB3 with PaXerC-MBP and XerD gave only a single detectable product that had the mobility expected from a single strand exchange mediated by XerD on the bottom strand (Fig. 6, lane 5). This product is no longer detected when XerDR148K is used in the reaction, confirming that catalysis is by XerD (Fig. 6, lane 6). A similar level of product migrating at the same position was also detected when un-nicked linear DNA, T60, was reacted with pMIN33 in the presence of PaXerC-MBP and XerD. The electrophoretic mobility of this product corresponded to that expected for the reciprocal exchange of a pair of bottom strands mediated by XerD (Fig. 6, lane 8). The inability to precipitate this product with SDS and KCl indicates that it did not contain covalently linked recombinases (data not shown). The inefficiency of these reactions may reflect an inappropriate recombinase conformation induced by PaXerC that subsequently inhibits formation of a productive synapse. No products resulting from both PaXerC- and XerD-mediated cleavage were detected for any of these reactions even though both top and bottom strand exchanges could occur independently. Therefore, XerD-mediated bottom strand exchange occurs exclusively on dB3 and T60, whereas PaXerC-mediated top strand exchange occurs on dT3, a result that mirrors the cleavage reactions on the linear suicide substrates. We propose that in these intermolecular reactions, the positions of the nick in dT3 directs a protein-DNA conformation appropriate for PaXerC-mediated strand exchange, whereas the absence of a nick or a bottom strand nick directs a complex conformation suitable for catalysis by XerD. The appearance of XerD-mediated bottom strand exchange and the absence of exchange by PaXerC with substrates dB3 and T60 demonstrates that the order of strand exchange at dif has been reversed (cf., Fig. 2 B). This reversal correlates with the change in relative amounts of strand cleavage as determined using suicide substrates (Fig. 5 A). Our previous work has shown that XerC cleaves the top strand of linear dif DNA 60–70-fold more frequently than XerD cleaves the bottom strand; here we show that intermolecular recombination mediated by the E. coli recombinases also display a preference for XerC-mediated top strand exchange first. In the presence of PaXerC, however, the increase in bottom strand cleavages mediated by XerD now leads to a preference for bottom strand exchange during recombination. This demonstrates a correlation between the frequency of strand cleavage on nicked linear duplexes and the order of strand exchange in reactions that support sequential catalysis by XerC and XerD. These results provide experimental support for a model in which recombinase-recombinase interactions play a key role in determining which two of the four recombinase molecules in a recombining tetramer are active at any one time (12.Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Nature. 1997; 389: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of Cre bound to HJ and synapsed duplex DNA (12.Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Nature. 1997; 389: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 36.Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Dyne G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7143-7148Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) suggest a mechanism for the switch that reciprocally activates two of the four recombinase molecules while inactivating the other two. Furthermore, the structures provide a molecular basis for the proposal that a conformational change in a two-fold symmetrical HJ intermediate is required to convert a substrate appropriate for one specific pair of strand exchanges to a substrate suitable for the other pair of strand exchanges (37.Stark W.M. Sherratt D.J. Boocock M.R. Cell. 1989; 58: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Interactions between the C-terminal α-helix (the donor region) of one Cre monomer and an acceptor region close to the active site of an adjacent monomer link all four recombinase molecules into a cyclic network of protein bound to DNA. These interactions position two of the active site tyrosines adjacent to their scissile phosphates as a consequence of the two-fold symmetry of the recombinase-DNA complex. A small change in DNA conformation and in protein-protein interactions can convert this complex from one suitable for top strand exchange to one suitable for bottom strand exchange (12.Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Nature. 1997; 389: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Preference for one of the two alternative conformations will therefore lead to a preferential order of strand exchange. Alteration in recombination site sequence can influence which strands are preferentially exchanged, apparently by determining the preferred DNA conformation (32.Arciszewska L.K. Grainge I. Sherratt D.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3731-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 33.Azaro M.A. Landy A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3744-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The results here also suggest that Xer, like Cre, uses recombinase-recombinase interactions to coordinate catalysis. The use of two recombinases provides an additional level of control that may be involved in determining that XerC normally initiates catalysis on duplex DNA. The observation that the PaXerC-XerD combination not only stimulates catalysis by XerD but leads to impairment of PaXerC-mediated cleavage and strand exchange underlines the reciprocal switch from one activity state to another. The reversal of this switch with PaXerC in cleavage assays on linear nicked substrates demonstrates that coordination of catalysis is mediated at or before recombinase-mediated cleavage and suggests that it only requires interactions between one XerC and one XerD molecule, because there is no evidence for synapsis of two linear DNA molecules in these assays."
https://openalex.org/W2064316596,"The Escherichia coli Fpg protein is a DNA glycosylase/AP lyase. It removes, in DNA, oxidized purine residues, including the highly mutagenic C8-oxo-guanine (8-oxoG). The catalytic mechanism is believed to involve the formation of a transient Schiff base intermediate formed between DNA containing an oxidized residue and the N-terminal proline of the Fpg protein. The importance and the role of this proline upon the various catalytic activities of the Fpg protein was examined by targeted mutagenesis, resulting in the construction of three mutant Fpg proteins: Pro-2 → Gly (FpgP2G), Pro-2 → Thr (FpgP2T), and Pro-2 → Glu (FpgP2E). The formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase activities of FpgP2G and FpgP2T were comparable and accounted for 10% of the wild-type activity. FpgP2G and FpgP2T had barely detectable 8-oxoG-DNA glycosylase activity and produced minute Schiff base complex with 8-oxoG/C DNA. FpgP2G and FpgP2T mutants did not cleave a DNA containing preformed AP site but readily produced Schiff base complex with this substrate. FpgP2E was completely inactive in all the assays. The binding constants of the different mutants when challenged with a duplex DNA containing a tetrahydrofuran residue were comparable. The mutant Fpg proteins barely or did not complement in vivo the spontaneous transitions G/C → T/A in E. coli BH990 (fpg mutY) cells. These results show the mandatory role of N-terminal proline in the 8-oxoG-DNA glycosylase activity of the Fpg protein in vitroand in vivo as well as in its AP lyase activity upon preformed AP site but less in the 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-N-methylformamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase activity."

Patients develop a multisystemic disease with a very severe central nervous system involvement. In contrast, Morquio B patients show no neurologic deterioration or hepatosplenomegaly but do present with skeletal abnormalities later in life. Oligosaccharides carrying terminal β-linked galactose residues derived from either glycoproteins or keratan sulfate are the major storage materials in visceral organs, while GM1 gangliosides and, to a lesser extent, GA1 accumulate in the brains of GM1gangliosidosis patients (1.Suzuki Y.

Early immunoprecipitation studies showed that β-gal is synthesized as an N-glycosylated 85-kDa precursor, which is converted into a 66-kDa intermediate and a 64-kDa mature form (1.Suzuki Y.

In normal human fibroblasts, the intermediate form accumulated when these cells were cultured in the presence of leupeptin, indicating that proteolytic processing could be involved in the conversion of the 66-kDa form to the 64-kDa form (12.d'Azzo A.

Comparison of the chemically determined N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 64-kDa form with the cDNA deduced sequence revealed that only 28 residues (including the signal peptide) are N-terminally removed during maturation of the precursor molecule.

For preparative Western blotting, SDS-polyacrylamide gels were prepared with piperazine diacrylamine (Bio-Rad) as cross-linker. Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Problott polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Blots were briefly stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and individual bands were excised, which were processed for N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis by automated Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems 470 sequenator. Initial yield was ∼35 pmol. Metabolic labeling and harvesting of cultured human fibroblasts and COS-1 cells, immunoprecipitation, and deglycosylation of immunoprecipitated proteins was performed as described (23.Zhou X.-Y. van der Spoel A.

Rabbit antisera against the β-gal precursor, purified from the medium of baculovirus-infected insect cells (α-BV85), against mature β-gal isolated from human placenta (α-n64) (24.Verheijen F. Brossmer R. Galjaard H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 108: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and against a bacterially expressed glutathioneS-transferase-β-gal-(544–677) fusion protein (α-24) were used in immunoprecipitations. The β-gal cDNA (14.Morreau H. Galjart N.J. Gillemans N. Willemsen R. van der Horst G.T.J. d'Azzo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20655-20663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was truncated after nucleotide 1679 (corresponding to codon 543) with two stop codons by adapting the polymerase chain reaction-based in vitro mutagenesis strategy of Higuchi et al. (25.Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar) using sense primer A (5′-GTGGATGGGATCCCCCAGGG-3′, corresponding to β-gal cDNA nucleotides 1389–1407, including theBamHI site at nucleotide 1397) and antisense primer B (5′-CCCCAAGCTTCATCATGAGTTGTGGGCCCAGGCTT-3′, corresponding to β-gal cDNA nucleotides 1679–1660, including an adapter sequence carrying a HindIII site and two stop codons). Using the full-length β-gal cDNA as template and primers A and B, a fragment corresponding to β-gal nucleotides 1389–1679 was amplified, carrying two translation termination signals and a HindIII site at its 3′-end. After BamHI/HindIII digestion, this fragment was linked to the BamHI fragment of normal β-gal cDNA ending at nucleotide 1397, to replace all of the β-gal cDNA located 3′ of the BamHI site at nucleotide 1397. At its 3′-end the polymerase chain reaction product was ligated to aHindIII site in the 3′-flanking vector sequence. To create a cDNA that codes for a β-gal deletion mutant in which the β-gal signal sequence (ending with Tyr28) is linked to Ser544 (coding for β-gal signal peptide in frame with the C-terminal domain of β-gal), nucleotide 134 of the β-gal cDNA was linked to nucleotide 1680. Primers were synthesized that span the fusion site: sense primer A (5′-CGCAATGCCACCTCCAACTACACGCTCCC-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 123–134 and 1680–1696) and antisense primer B (5′-CGTGTAGTTGGAGGTGGCATTGCGCAAGC-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 1691–1680 and 118–134). Using the β-gal cDNA (cloned into pBluescript) as template in separate polymerase chain reactions, primer B was combined with a sense primer that anneals at the 5′-flanking vector sequence, and primer A was combined with an antisense primer that anneals at the 3′-flanking vector sequence. Thus, in the first reaction (primer B), a fragment was generated, of which the terminal 24 nucleotides had the same sequence as the first 24 nucleotides of the product of the second reaction (primer A). These two fragments were annealed at their homologous termini and used as template for a third polymerase chain reaction using the primers that anneal at 3′- and 5′-flanking vector sequences. In this reaction, a fragment was amplified that corresponds to the β-gal cDNA lacking nucleotides 135–1679. The obtained cDNA constructs (B64 and B24, respectively) were verified by sequence analysis and subcloned into mammalian expression vectors pCD-X (16.Galjart N.J. Gillemans N.

Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar) or the Superfect reagent, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Forty eight hours post-transfection, cells were metabolically labeled with l-[4,5-3H]leucine (50 μCi/ml of culture medium) for 16 h and processed for immunoprecipitation; alternatively, for analysis of enzyme activity, cells were harvested by trypsinization 72 h post-transfection. Early infantile GS fibroblasts (16.Galjart N.J. Gillemans N. Harris A. van der Horst G.T.J. Verheijen F.W. Galjaard H. d'Azzo A. Cell. 1988; 54: 755-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) were grown to confluency in 35- and 85-mm dishes. PPCA precursors were prepared and added to the culture medium of these cells, as described earlier (23.Zhou X.-Y. van der Spoel A. Rottier R. Hale G. Willemsen R. Berry G.T. Strisciuglio P. Andria G. d'Azzo A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1977-1987Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 4 days of uptake, fibroblasts in 35-mm dishes were harvested by trypsinization for analysis of enzyme activities. Cells in 85-mm dishes were cultured for 3 days in the presence of exogenous PPCA precursors; culture was then continued in the presence of bothl-[4,5-3H]leucine (50 μCi/ml) and exogenous PPCA precursors for 18–20 h before processing cells for immunoprecipitation (23.Zhou X.-Y. van der Spoel A. Rottier R. Hale G. Willemsen R. Berry G.T. Strisciuglio P. Andria G. d'Azzo A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1977-1987Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During purification of the multienzyme complex containing β-gal, PPCA, and neuraminidase, a lysosomal-mitochondrial fraction was prepared from mouse liver and fractionated by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-200 column (Fig.1 A). All three enzyme activities co-eluted right after the void volume (peak I), while oligomeric forms of β-gal and PPCA eluted independently (i.e. PPCA dimers (∼104 kDa) and β-gal tetramers (∼256 kDa) and dimers (∼128 kDa) (Fig. 1 A)). Surprisingly, in samples displaying β-gal activity (peaks I and II), not only the 64-kDa mature form, but also two bands of apparent molecular mass of ∼24–22 kDa were clearly recognized by anti-β-gal precursor antibodies (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, these low molecular weight proteins copurified with the multienzyme complex (peak I), after purification on a β-gal affinity column (p-aminophenyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-agarose) (Fig. 1 C). It is noteworthy that most of the β-gal eluted from thep-aminophenyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-agarose column was present in fraction 4, followed by a minor peak in fraction 5, which coincided with the pool of cathepsin A and neuraminidase activities (Fig.1 C). This elution pattern may depend on the fact that β-gal in complex with the other two enzymes (fraction 5) has a higher affinity for the substrate than its free form. Apparently, the association of the β-gal C-terminal fragment to the mature 64-kDa domain, although noncovalent, is stable enough to withstand harsh washes with 1 m NaCl solutions during the purification procedure. To verify the identity of the 22/24-kDa form (Fig. 1 B), N-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed. The obtained sequence coincided with that of mouse β-gal residues Ser546–Phe558 (Fig. 1 D,underlined), corresponding to Ser543–Phe555 in the human protein (Fig.1 D). Thus, the 22/24-kDa band represents a C-terminal fragment of the β-gal precursor, generated during its proteolytic processing in lysosomes. To prove that this mechanism of β-gal maturation into a two-subunit enzyme is conserved within other mammalian species, we purified the bovine multienzyme complex from cultured Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells (data not shown). Also in bovine cells, the C-terminal β-gal fragment co-purified with the multienzyme complex. The chemically determined N-terminal amino acid sequence was 69% identical to the mouse sequence (Fig. 1 D,underlined). Although the first amino acid of the bovine fragment did not coincide with that of its murine counterpart, both fragments start with a serine residue (Fig. 1 D), suggesting that the protease cleavage site could be between two serines. The high degree of similarity between the bovine, mouse, and human C-terminal β-gal sequences points to a fully conserved mechanism of proteolytic processing of the enzyme (Fig. 1 D). To verify if the 22/24-kDa fragment is also retained after normal processing of the human precursor, radiolabeled human fibroblasts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-β-gal antibodies that recognize both precursor and mature forms of the protein (α-BV85 and α-n64, respectively). We also constructed a cDNA (B24) that separately encodes the C-terminal domain (Ser544–Val677; B24) and was tagged N-terminally with the β-gal signal sequence to ensure translocation of the polypeptide to the endoplasmic reticulum (see “Experimental Procedures”). This mutagenized cDNA was transfected in COS-1 cells to compare the size of its encoded fragment with that of the C-terminal fragment of β-gal in human fibroblasts. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, only the immunoprecipitated 85-kDa β-gal precursor and the 64-kDa mature form were readily detected in normal fibroblasts (Fig. 2,lane 1). However, deglycosylation withN-glycosidase F allowed the detection of an 18-kDa band (Fig. 2, lane 2) that comigrated with the overexpressed and deglycosylated B24 protein (Fig. 2, lane 6). This result suggests that both the C-terminal domain of human β-gal and the truncated B24 protein are glycosylated at two sites. Apparently, the presence of sugar chains on the C-terminal fragment alters its electrophoretic mobility and renders its detection difficult. Notably, all molecular mass forms of β-gal, including the 18-kDa band, were absent from β-gal mRNA-deficient GM1 gangliosidosis fibroblasts (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4). Thus, the C-terminal fragment is retained in the mature form of β-gal in human fibroblasts. The fact that the ∼60- and 18-kDa deglycosylated bands are not of equal intensity may be due to the 6-fold difference in number of leucine residues between these fragments. To further ascertain if the C-terminal peptide is indeed a component of mature and active β-gal, we cultured PPCA mRNA-negative GS fibroblasts in the presence of exogenous PPCA precursor. It is well established that endocytosis of PPCA precursor by these cells rescues mature β-gal from rapid degradation and restores its enzymatic activity to nearly normal levels (11.van Diggelen O.P.

We used wild-type PPCA (Fig. 3, WT) as well as two PPCA mutants in uptake experiments; PPCA-F412V (FV), originally identified in a mild late infantile case of GS, is only partially transported to lysosomes, where it is unstable (23.Zhou X.-Y. van der Spoel A.

GS cells were treated with these unlabeled PPCA precursors for 3 days and radiolabeled with [3H]leucine for an additional day. The cells were then processed for immunoprecipitation with α-BV85 and α-n64 antibodies. Fig. 3 shows that, while the level of the 85-kDa β-gal precursor was comparable in all cells, restoration of β-gal activity was achieved after uptake of wild-type PPCA or PPCA-S150A but not after uptake of PPCA-F412V. The increase in activity was paralleled by increased amounts of both the 64- and 28/24-kDa forms. Similar results were obtained using an unrelated strain of PPCA mRNA-deficient GS fibroblasts (data not shown). These observations confirm unequivocally that the C-terminal fragment is an integral part of the mature β-gal. To investigate whether the N-terminal domain of the enzyme would be functional without the C-terminal fragment, we constructed a cDNA that encodes only for the N-terminal polypeptide (Met1–Ser543; B64). Transfection of COS-1 cells with either B64 or B24 cDNA constructs did not result in an increase of β-gal activity (Fig.4 A, B24 andB64). However, co-expression of the two cDNAs generated a significant increase in β-gal activity over the COS-1 endogenous values (Fig. 4 A, B24/B64), implying that the interaction between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains is required for the catalytic activity of β-gal. COS-1 cells that were transfected with B64 construct and metabolically labeled expressed a ∼66-kDa immunoprecipitable polypeptide, comparable in size with the endogenous mature β-gal (Fig.4 B, lane 3). As shown previously, transfection with the C-terminal β-gal cDNA (B24) by itself resulted in an ∼28-kDa polypeptide (Figs. 3 and 4 B,lane 4). The 66-kDa form of β-gal was precipitated not only by the anti-mature β-gal antibody (α-n64) but also by an antibody raised against the C-terminal peptide (α-24) (Fig. 4 B, lanes 5 and 6, respectively). Since the latter antibody did not recognize the ∼66-kDa fragment by itself, the co-precipitation data suggest that the two β-gal domains form a two-chain molecule. The association between the two subunits must be strong enough to endure the stringent washing conditions (0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.6) after immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, the 66-kDa fragment was secreted only when co-expressed with the C-terminal portion (Fig. 4 B,lanes 11 and 12). In contrast, the C-terminal peptide was detected in the medium of overexpressing cells, regardless of the presence or absence of co-expressed B64 (Fig. 4 B,lanes 10 and 12). All together, these results pinpoint to an essential role of the C-terminal fragment in the proper folding of the N-terminal part of β-gal and in the intracellular transport of this domain. The 85-kDa precursor of human lysosomal β-gal is proteolytically processed at its C terminus into a 66/64-kDa mature form (12.d'Azzo A. Hoogeveen A. Reuser A.J. Robinson D. Galjaard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4535-4539Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The fate of the ∼24/28-kDa fragment that is generated in this process was until now overlooked. Here we present evidence that this polypeptide is retained after maturation of the precursor and is part of the catalytically active form of β-gal. At present, its specific role in the lysosomal function of mature β-gal is not fully understood. It is well established that correct folding of enzyme precursors is a prerequisite for their intracellular transport and lysosomal localization (reviewed in Refs. 33.Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 34.Gottesman S. Wickner S. Maurizi M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 35.Thomas G.H. Beaudet A.L. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, we can speculate that β-gal depends on its C-terminal domain for acquisition of the proper tertiary structure, both in the precursor and mature state. In addition, the polypeptide may be involved in protein-protein interaction both in the homo-oligomeric or heteromultimeric forms of the enzyme. The significance of the β-gal C-terminal domain is further supported by the identification of several amino acid substitutions in different GM1 gangliosidosis patients that localize in this region: Y591C, Y591N (37.Morrone A. Bardelli T. Donati M. Giorgi M. DiRocco R. Gatti R. Taddeucci G. Ricci R. d'Azzo A. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 61 (abstr.): 1499Google Scholar), R590H, K578R, and E632G (38.Boustany R.-M. Qian W.-H. Suzuki K. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1993; 53: 881-888PubMed Google Scholar). The latter three were shown to be disease-causing mutations, since they abolished enzyme activity when the mutant proteins were expressed in COS-1 cells. Therefore, they may affect either the folding of the precursor and its exit from the endoplasmic reticulum or the lysosomal stability/activity of a correctly routed enzyme. It will still be interesting to analyze the effects of these mutations at the structural level. In addition, the C terminus of mammalian β-gal contains a small domain (residues 577–592) that is conserved in nine β-galactosidases and related proteins from bacterial, fungal, nematode, and plant species (39.Taron C. Benner J. Hornstra L. Guthrie E. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 40.Ito Y. Sasaki T. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1997; 61: 1270-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 41.Gutshall K. Wang K. Brenchley J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3064-3067Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, all of the mutations mentioned above except E632G lie in this area. Specifically, Lys578 and Arg590 are identical in all organisms except in Aspergillus niger, while Tyr591 is maintained in four of these species and is adjacent to the fully conserved Trp592. The fact that the C-terminal fragment isolated from murine liver starts at Ser546 does not exclude the possibility that this peptide may arise from a larger proteolytic product that is subsequently trimmed at its N terminus. However, leupeptin treatment of cultured human fibroblasts results in accumulation of a 66-kDa intermediate (12.d'Azzo A. Hoogeveen A. Reuser A.J. Robinson D. Galjaard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4535-4539Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the human β-gal precursor is initially cleaved at or close to the N-terminal side of Ser543-Ser544, followed by further processing of the large domain at Arg530 by a trypsin-like protease, as predicted earlier (15.Yamamoto Y. Hake C.A. Martin B.M. Kretz K.A. Ahern-Rindell A.J. Naylor S.L. Mudd M. O'Brien J.S. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the precursor, obtained from overexpressing insect cells, can be readily converted to a 64-kDa form by mild trypsin digestion (42.Takiyama N. Itoh K. Oshima A. Sakuraba H. Suzuki Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 526-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Few examples of C-terminal processing of lysosomal enzymes have been described. Lysosomal α-glucosidase undergoes both N- and C-terminal processing; a ∼20-kDa peptide is removed from the C terminus, but it is not known whether it remains associated with the rest of the mature molecule (reviewed in Ref. 43.Hirschhorn R. Scriver C. Beaudet A. Sly W. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 2. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2443-2464Google Scholar). In contrast, the 18 amino acid residues that are removed from the C terminus of human lysosomal β-glucuronidase are required for its binding to the microsomal esterase egasyn, which is a prerequisite for a fraction of the enzyme precursor to be retained in the ER (51.Li H. Takeuchi K.H. Manly K. Chapman V. Swank R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14732-14735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, when synthesized without its C terminus, the enzyme is catalytically impaired, hypophosphorylated, and increasingly secreted (44.Islam M. Grubb J. Sly W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22627-22633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the C-terminal domain of the β-glucuronidase precursor appears to be essential for its folding process and compartmentalization. In contrast to the examples discussed above, many more proteins are known to undergo N-terminal processing (see Refs. 45.Baker D. Shiau A. Agard D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 46.Eder J. Fersht A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 47.Shinde U. Inouye M.

Biochem. 1994; 115: 629-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar for reviews). The N-terminal pro-regions of various prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteases and polypeptide hormones function as intramolecular chaperones; they are known to be required for proper protein folding (and consequentially intracellular transport) by reducing kinetic barriers between unfolded or partially folded forms and mature molecules. They are also powerful inhibitors of the proteolytic enzymes and do not necessarily become superfluous after processing;e.g. the extracellular form of cathepsin B remains in a noncovalent complex with its propeptide, and this conformation accounts for its stability in this environment (49.Mach L. Mort J.S. Glössl J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13036-13040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50.Cygler M. Sivaraman J. Grochulski P. Coulombe R. Storer A. Mort J. Structure. 1996; 4: 405-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In view of the fact that β-gal forms a multienzyme complex with neuraminidase and PPCA, it will be relevant in the future to determine the role played by the C-terminal fragment in complex assembly.

Within minutes of incubation with bFGF, a significant increase in the rate of metabolism of [14C]hexanoyl ceramide to [14C]hexanoyl GlcCer is detected, but there are no changes in the rate of [14C]hexanoyl sphingomyelin synthesis. In vitro analysis of GlcCer synthase activity revealed an approximately 2-fold increase in the rate of [14C]hexanoyl GlcCer synthesis upon incubation with either bFGF or laminin; other growth factors, which did not effect the rate of axon growth, had no effect on the rate of [14C]hexanoyl GlcCer synthesis. The increased rate of [14C]hexanoyl GlcCer synthesis was not affected by preincubation with either cycloheximide or actinomycin, and no elevation of GlcCer synthase mRNA levels was detected, suggesting that GlcCer synthase is up-regulated by a post-translational mechanism.

The activity of GCS is regulated under certain conditions including substrate depletion (8.Meivar-Levy I. Futerman A.H. J. Biol.

In these three cases, regulation of GCS activity occurs by a transcriptional mechanism. Such a mechanism provides a means to regulate GlcCer levels (and as a consequence, levels of down-stream lipids in the glycosphingolipid biosynthetic pathway (8.Meivar-Levy I. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4607-4612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar)) over relatively long periods of time, such as which may occur during differentiation and development, but this mechanism could not be involved in regulating GlcCer levels for processes that require a more rapid response. One example of such a rapid response is the ability of neurons to react to external stimuli by altering the rate of axonal growth (11.Futerman A.H. Banker G.A. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 144-149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). When cultured hippocampal neurons are incubated with either basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) or laminin, axonal growth rates increase between 2- and 4-fold (12.Boldin S. Futerman A.H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 882-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The stimulatory effects of both factors can be completely abolished by co-incubation with inhibitors of GlcCer synthesis (12.Boldin S. Futerman A.H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 882-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Based on this and other studies (13.Harel R. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14476-14481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Schwarz A. Rapaport E. Hirschberg K. Futerman A.H. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2929-2938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we have suggested that GlcCer synthesis may be a rate-limiting step in some facets of axon growth (11.Futerman A.H. Banker G.A. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 144-149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). If this is the case, then it might be predicted that stimulation of axon growth by bFGF or laminin would increase the rate of GlcCer synthesis. In the current study we demonstrate, by both in vivo and in vitroanalyses, that GCS is indeed activated upon treatment of hippocampal neurons with bFGF and that up-regulation occurs by a post-translational and not a transcriptional mechanism. n-Hexanoic acid [1-14C]N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (53.2 or 55 mCi/mmol) was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.

Hippocampal neurons plated at high-density (180,000 cells/24-mm polylysine-coated glass coverslip) were cultured in serum-free medium as described (14.Schwarz A. Rapaport E. Hirschberg K.

Coverslips were placed with the neurons facing downwards and separated from the glia by paraffin “feet” (17.Goslin K. Asmussen H. Banker G. Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts1998: 339-370Google Scholar). For morphological measurements, neurons were plated at low density (12,000 cells/13-mm coverslip) (12.Boldin S. Futerman A.H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 882-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar,15.Schwarz A. Futerman A.H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2929-2938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Six coverslips containing 2-day-old neurons were removed from dishes containing a glial monolayer and placed with the neurons facing upwards in a 100-mm Petri dish that did not contain a glial monolayer; 4 ml of medium, taken from dishes containing glia, were added to each culture dish. [14C]hexanoyl Cer (synthesized by N-acylation of sphingosine using n-hexanoic acid [1-14C]N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (18.Futerman A.H. Pagano R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)) was dissolved in ethanol and added to the culture dishes, which were then returned to the incubator for various times. bFGF (1 ng/ml, dissolved in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS)) or an equivalent volume (10 μl) of HBSS were added to the culture dishes 1 h later. After various times, coverslips were removed from the dishes and washed with HBSS, and neurons were removed by scraping with a rubber policeman into ice-cold water and lyophilized. After resuspension in a small volume of water, lipids were extracted (19.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42673) Google Scholar) and separated by thin layer chromatography using CHCl3/CH3OH/9.8 mm CaCl2 (60:35:8, v/v/v) as the developing solvent. Thin layer chromatography plates were exposed to a14C-sensitive imaging plate (BAS-TR2040S, Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd., Japan), lipids were recovered from the plates by scraping, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Neurons were placed into new culture dishes as above and treated with or without bFGF or other growth factors for various times. Coverslips were subsequently washed three times with HBSS, neurons were removed by scraping with a rubber policeman, and neurons were homogenized in a handheld Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer in 2–3 ml of TK buffer (25 mmKCl and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4). Homogenates were used fresh. GlcCer synthesis was assayed as described (2.Futerman A.H. Pagano R.E. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained 20 μg of protein (determined according to Bradford (20.Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215589) Google Scholar), 5 mm UDP-Glc, 2 μm[14C]hexanoyl Cer, and 10 mmMnCl2 in a total volume of 2–3 ml of TK buffer. The reaction was terminated after 2 h at 37 °C by addition of CHCl3/CH3OH (1:2, v/v). Lipids were extracted (19.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42673) Google Scholar) and separated by thin layer chromatography as described above. mRNA was isolated from 2-day-old hippocampal neurons using an mRNA isolation kit. Partial GlcCer synthase cDNA (∼400 base pairs), based on the sequence of rat GlcCer synthase (5.Ichikawa S. Hirabayashi Y. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 198-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), was obtained by RT-PCR using a TitanTMone-tube RT-PCR system and the following GlcCer synthase primers: 5′-TTGTTCGGCTTCGTGCTCTT-3′ (forward primer), and 5′-GACTCGTATTCCGCTATCAC-3′ (reverse primer). RT-PCR products were resolved on 1.5% agarose-gels. To determine whether bFGF stimulates sphingolipid synthesis, [14C]hexanoyl Cer was added directly to culture dishes containing 2-day-old neurons. After 1 h, bFGF was added, and [14C]hexanoyl GlcCer and [14C]hexanoyl SM synthesis was analyzed for the next 30 min. Immediately prior to addition of bFGF, the rate of [14C]hexanoyl GlcCer synthesis was 35.8 fmol/min, which increased to 274 fmol/min for a 10-min period after addition of bFGF (Fig. 1 A and TableI). In contrast, there was no increase in the rate of [14C]hexanoyl SM synthesis (Fig.1 A, Table I). 2We previously observed little or no metabolism of a short acyl chain fluorescent derivative of Cer (C6-NBD-d-erythro-Cer;N-{6-[(7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]hexanoyl}-d-erythro-sphingosine) to C6-NBD-SM when analyzed in vivo in cultured hippocampal neurons (12.Boldin S. Futerman A.H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 882-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In contrast, [14C]hexanoyl Cer is metabolized to [14C]hexanoyl SM, although the ratio of [14C]hexanoyl SM synthesis to [14C]hexanoyl GlcCer synthesis depends on the initial concentration of [14C]hexanoyl Cer; as the concentration of [14C]hexanoyl Cer increases, more [14C]hexanoyl GlcCer is synthesized compared with [14C]hexanoyl SM (S. A. Boldin and A. H. Futerman, unpublished data). A small increase in the rate of [14C]hexanoyl GlcCer synthesis was also observed in control cultures dishes, to which an equivalent volume of buffer (HBSS) was added. The rate of GlcCer synthesis after addition of buffer was 81.6 fmol/min; this is presumably due to removing the culture dish from the incubator, opening the dish for addition of HBSS, and gentle shaking after addition of the buffer.Table IComparison of the rates of uptake and synthesis of [ 14 C]hexanoyl sphingolipids in control and bFGF-treated neuronsTime after addition of [14C]hexanoyl Cer0–30 min30–60 min60–70 min60–70 minControl neuronsbFGF-treated neuronsRate of [14C]hexanoyl Cer uptake (fmol/min)1292161 (1)636 (3.95)2624 (16.3)Rate of [14C]hexanoyl GlcCer synthesis (fmol/min)89.535.8 (1)81.6 (2.3)274.3 (7.7)Rate of [14C]hexanoyl SM synthesis (fmol/min)64.712.9 (1)40.6 (3.1)49.1 (3.8)Data are taken from Fig. 1.

The difference in the rates of uptake and synthesis between 0–30 min and 30–60 min is due to the rapid initial rate of uptake of [14C]hexanoyl Cer (18.Futerman A.H. Pagano R.E.

Chem. 1990; 265: 8650-8657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by neurons immediately after its addition to the culture dishes. The rate of uptake of [14C]hexanoyl Cer by neurons was also significantly increased after addition of bFGF (Fig. 1 Band Table I). Two possibilities could explain the increase in the rate of [14C]hexanoyl Cer uptake. (i) bFGF could directly affect the rate of [14C]hexanoyl Cer uptake into neurons, and, as a consequence, the rate of [14C]hexanoyl GlcCer synthesis is elevated simply because of increased availability of intracellular [14C]hexanoyl Cer. (ii) bFGF could directly affect the rate of [14C]hexanoyl GlcCer synthesis, and, as a result, more [14C]hexanoyl Cer is taken up by neurons to provide sufficient substrate for increased [14C]hexanoyl GlcCer synthesis. To distinguish between these two possibilities, which are fundamental to explaining the mechanism of action of bFGF, neurons were incubated with a stereoisomer of Cer, [14C]hexanoyl-l-threo-Cer, which is not metabolized to GlcCer (12.Boldin S. Futerman A.H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 882-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Addition of bFGF did not affect the rate of uptake of [14C]hexanoyl-l-threo-Cer (Fig.2 B) or the rate of [14C]hexanoyl-l-threo-SM synthesis (Fig. 2 A), demonstrating that bFGF directly affects the rate of [14C]hexanoyl GlcCer synthesis rather than the rate of [14C]hexanoyl Cer uptake. Although there was an increase in the rate of [14C]hexanoyl GlcCer synthesis immediately after addition of bFGF (Fig. 1 A), reaching a maximum after 20 min, the rate of [14C]hexanoyl GlcCer synthesis decreased after this time (Fig. 1 A). No increase in the amount of [14C]hexanoyl GlcCer was detected in the medium 30 min after addition of bFGF, and no significant metabolism of [14C]hexanoyl GlcCer to [14C]hexanoyl lactosylceramide was detected when cells were incubated either with [14C]hexanoyl Cer or directly with [14C]hexanoyl GlcCer (not shown). In contrast, upon direct incubation with [14C]hexanoyl GlcCer, significant metabolism to [14C]hexanoyl Cer was detected, and it is possible that the decrease in the amount of [14C]hexanoyl GlcCer observed 30 min after addition of bFGF is due to its degradation to [14C]hexanoyl Cer. We next examined the specificity of the effect of bFGF by analyzing GCS activity in vitro. In these experiments, neurons were incubated with bFGF or other growth factors for 10 min in culture dishes, subsequently removed from the coverslips by scraping, homogenized, and assayed for GCS activity using [14C]hexanoyl Cer as substrate (2.Futerman A.H. Pagano R.E. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 18.Futerman A.H. Pagano R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). When measuredin vitro, GCS activity increased from 2.5 to 4.1 pmol of [14C]hexanoyl GlcCer synthesized per μg of protein/h after treatment with bFGF (Table II). A similar increase in the specific activity of GCS was detected when neurons were incubated with laminin, which also stimulates axonal growth in a manner that is dependent on GlcCer synthesis (Ref. 12.Boldin S. Futerman A.H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 882-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar and Table II). In contrast, denatured bFGF had no effect on GCS activity and no effect on the rate of axon growth (Table II), and preincubation of bFGF with a neutralizing anti-bFGF antibody also abolished the ability of bFGF to stimulate GCS activity and the rate of axonal growth. Three other growth factors (epidermal growth factor, nerve growth factor, and neurotrophin 3) had no effect on either GCS activity or on the rate of axonal growth. Thus, a direct correlation exists between elevated GCS activity and increased rates of axonal growth; bFGF and laminin stimulate both, whereas inactivated bFGF and other growth factors do not effect either parameter. 3Note that addition of bFGF directly to the reaction mixture had no effect on GCS activity (not shown).Table IIEffect of growth factors on GCS activity and on the rate of axon growthGrowth factoraThe conditions of incubation for each growth factor were as follows: denatured bFGF, bFGF was heated at 95 °C for 10 min; bFGF + anti-bFGF, bFGF was preincubated with an anti-bFGF antibody for 2 h at 37 °C; EGF, epidermal growth factor; NGF, nerve growth factor; NT3, neurotrophin 3.Axon length at 51 hGCS activityμmpmol [ 14 C]hexanoyl GlcCer synthesized/μg of protein/hControl214 ± 8.42.55 ± 0.62bFGF (1 ng/ml)278 ± 8.1bStatistically different from control cells (p < 0.02).4.10 ± 0.84bStatistically different from control cells (p < 0.02).Denatured bFGF (1 ng/ml)217 ± 9.71.98 ± 0.28bFGF (1 ng/ml) + anti-bFGF (250 ng/ml)210 ± 9.72.20 ± 0.32anti-bFGF (250 ng/ml)220 ± 11.41.93 ± 0.43EGF (50 ng/ml)221 ± 8.42.55 ± 0.70NGF (200 ng/ml)220 ± 9.62.45 ± 0.84NT3 (400 ng/ml)218 ± 12.92.47 ± 0.61Laminin (5 μg/ml)282 ± 12.4bStatistically different from control cells (p < 0.02).4.02 ± 0.58bStatistically different from control cells (p < 0.02).Neurons (plated at a density of 12,000 cells/13-mm coverslip) were incubated with or without growth factors at 48 h in culture, and axon length was measured at 51 h; axon length in control cells at 48 h was 208 ± 6.4 μm.

Values are means ± S.E. of three individual experiments. The activity of GCS at various substrate concentrations was examined in neurons treated with or without bFGF; an approximately 2-fold increase in activity was observed in bFGF-treated compared with control neurons under conditions in which the rate of the reaction was not limited by substrate availability (Fig.3 A). Activity was linear with respect to time of the reaction (Fig. 3 B) and protein concentration (not shown). To examine the time course of the effect of bFGF, neurons were incubated for various times with bFGF prior to assay of GCS activity. GCS activity remained higher in bFGF-treated neurons than in their control counterparts for up to 3 h after addition of bFGF (TableIII). However, when bFGF was added to the incubation medium for 10 min and then removed (by washing the coverslips and replacing the medium with medium that did not contain bFGF), GCS activity decreased compared with neurons in which bFGF remained present throughout the 3-h incubation (Fig.4).Table IIITime course of the effect of bFGF on GCS activityTime after addition of bFGF (min)Control neuronsbFGF-treated neuronsSpecific activity (pmol [ 14 C]hexanoyl GlcCer synthesized/μg of protein/h)53.52 ± 0.765.03 ± 0.48 103.16 ± 0.675.97 ± 1.05 303.21 ± 0.685.08 ± 1.071803.08 ± 0.674.70 ± 1.12Neurons were incubated with or without bFGF for various times and then removed from the coverslips by scraping, homogenized, and assayed for GCS activity (20 μg of protein, 2 μm[14C]hexanoyl Cer, 2-h reaction).

Values are means ± S.E. of four individual experiments. Statistical differences (p < 0.05) were obtained between control and bFGF-treated neurons for 10-, 30-, and 180-min incubations with bFGF. Because GCS activity was elevated within 5–10 min of addition of bFGF, it appears unlikely that GCS activity is regulated via a transcriptional mechanism as was observed, for instance, upon long-term depletion of substrate levels (8.Meivar-Levy I. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4607-4612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This was confirmed by semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis, in which no changes in GCS mRNA levels were detected between control neurons and those treated with bFGF for 10 min or 3 h (Fig. 5). Moreover, preincubation with the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, or the RNA synthesis inhibitor, actinomycin, had no effect on the bFGF-stimulated increase in GCS activity (TableIV).Table IVEffect of inhibition of protein or RNA synthesis on GCS activityPretreatmentControl neuronsbFGF-treated neuronsSpecific activity (pmol [ 14 C]hexanoyl GlcCer synthesized/μg of protein/h)None3.8 ± 0.45.6 ± 0.5Actinomycin3.7 ± 0.56.4 ± 0.1Cycloheximide3.6 ± 0.16.7 ± 0.6Neurons were preincubated with cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) for 10 min or with actinomycin D (1 μm) for 30 min, prior to incubation with or without bFGF for another 10 min, after which neurons were removed from the coverslips and assayed for GCS activity.

Results are means ± S.E. of two independent experiments. The major finding of the current study is that stimulation of axonal growth by bFGF results in an increase in the rate of GlcCer synthesis due to post-translational modification of GCS. In contrast, the rate of SM synthesis is not affected. A role for GlcCer synthesis in regulating the rate of axonal growth in cultured hippocampal neurons has been established (12.Boldin S. Futerman A.H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 882-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 14.Schwarz A. Rapaport E. Hirschberg K. Futerman A.H. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2929-2938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although the precise molecular requirements for which GlcCer synthesis is needed are not known. It has been reported that the rate of SM synthesis increases compared with GlcCer synthesis during neuronal development (22.Ledesma M.D. Brugger B. Bunning C. Wieland F.T. Dotti C.G.

However, careful comparison of the rates of SM and GlcCer synthesis is required before distinct functions can be ascribed to each lipid at different stages of development, particularly as differences in the ratio of SM and GlcCer synthesis can be detected depending on the ceramide analogues used to measure activity and on ceramide concentration.2 Irrespective of the possible distinct roles for SM and GlcCer synthesis at different stages of neuronal development, the data presented in the current study demonstrate that in young neurons (2 days in culture), GlcCer synthesis is activated by bFGF, whereas the rate of SM synthesis is unaffected. This activation occurs within minutes of bFGF treatment and is presumably a prerequisite for accelerated axonal growth, because incubation with inhibitors of GlcCer synthesis blocks axonal growth (12.Boldin S.

Two earlier studies have suggested a similar mode of activation. In the first (24.Bourteele S. Hausser A. Doppler H. Hornmuller J. Ropke C. Schwarzmann G. Pfizenmaier K. Muller G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31245-31251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), a decrease in the activity of GCS was observed upon treatment of Kym-1 rhabdomyasarcoma cells with tumor necrosis factor, presumably to prevent GCS from consuming ceramide generated by the SM cycle (25.Kolesnick R.N. Kronke M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 643-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). In the second study, SM generated by application of endogenous sphingomyelinase to B16 melanoma cells resulted in up-regulation of GCS by both transcriptional and post-translational steps (26.Komori H. Ichikawa S. Hirabayashi Y. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8981-8987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Common to both of these studies is the pathway by which GCS activity is regulated namely as a response to generation of ceramide at the cell surface upon activation of the SM cycle. This appears to be different from the pathway by which GCS is up-regulated in bFGF-treated hippocampal neurons. There is no evidence that the activity of bFGF is mediated by the SM cycle, but rather it appears to be mediated via tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of high affinity bFGF receptors (27.Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Dionne C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). In PC12 cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of the bFGF receptor activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (28.Sano M. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and in hippocampal neurons, bFGF causes a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of a variety of proteins, as yet unidentified (29.Creuzet C. Loeb J. Barbin G. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1541-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Whether activation of one of these pathways is a first step in the rapid up-regulation of GCS minutes after addition of bFGF is not known. However, it should be noted that the active site of GCS is on the cytosolic face of the Golgi apparatus (1.Coste H. Martel M.-B. Got R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 6-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 2.Futerman A.H. Pagano R.E. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 3.Jeckel D. Karrenbauer A.

Because GCS has not been crystalized, little secondary and tertiary structural information is available. In a recent study, a histidine residue was detected in the active site of GCS (30.Wu K. Marks D.L. Watanabe R. Paul P. Rajan N. Pagano R.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 395-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, deletion of the N-terminal domain of GCS (including the transmembrane region) resulted in total loss of activity. As suggested (30.Wu K. Marks D.L. Watanabe R. Paul P. Rajan N. Pagano R.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 395-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this region may be involved in interaction of GCS with ceramide and may be a potential site for post-translational modification. Unraveling the pathways by which binding of bFGF (and laminin) to their respective cell surface receptors leads to post-translational modification of GCS presents a formidable challenge.

https://openalex.org/W1588612694,"A single G1679E mutation in the amino-terminal globular domain N2 of the alpha3 chain of type VI collagen was found in a large family affected with Bethlem myopathy. Recombinant production of N2 ( approximately 200 residues) in transfected mammalian cells has now been used to examine the possibility that the mutation interfered with protein folding. The wild-type form and a G1679A mutant were produced at high levels and shown to fold into a stable globular structure. Only a small amount of secretion was observed for mutants G1679E and G1679Q, which apparently were efficiently degraded within the cells. Homology modeling onto the related von Willebrand factor A1 structure indicated that substitution of G1679 by the bulky E or Q cannot be accommodated without considerable changes in the folding pattern. This suggests protein misfolding as a molecular basis for this particular mutation in Bethlem myopathy, in agreement with radioimmunoassay data showing reduced levels of domain N2 in cultured fibroblasts from two patients."
https://openalex.org/W2094733677,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) exhibits two conductance states, 9 picosiemens (pS) and 3 pS. To investigate the origin of these two distinct conductance states, we measured the single-channel activity of three truncated forms of CFTR. These include: TNR, which contains the first transmembrane domain, the first nucleotide binding domain, and the R domain; RT2N2, which contains the R domain, the second transmembrane domain, and the second nucleotide-binding domain; and T2N2, which contains only the second transmembrane domain and the second nucleotide-binding domain. The results show that TNR exhibits only the large conductance of 9.2 pS, whereas RT2N2 and T2N2 exhibit only the small conductance (3.8–4.0 pS). Co-expression of TNR with T2N2 resulted in a mixed pattern of two conductance states, which is similar to that observed in wild-type CFTR. In further studies, a “dual-R mutant,” R334W and R347P in the transmembrane segment 6 of the first half of CFTR, severely impaired the large conductance channel without affecting the small conductance channel. The ion selectivity and gating behavior of the two conductance channels are different regardless of whether they are measured in wild-type CFTR or in truncated CFTRs. The ion selectivity of the large conductance channel is Br− > Cl− > I−, whereas the ion selectivity of the small conductance channel is Br− = Cl− = I−. The open probability (Po) of the large conductance is about 4-fold higher than that of the small conductance. Transition from closed to open states of the small conductance is not dependent upon the open or closed states of the large conductance. The independent behaviors of the two conductances in CFTR strongly suggest that CFTR may have two distinct pores.

In excised inside-out patches, wild-type CFTR exhibits two conductances, a main conductance of between 9 and 11 pS and a smaller conductance of approximately 4.0 pS. The selectivity of the main conductance is Br− > Cl− > I− > F−. Many investigators have used mutagenesis to create CFTR cDNAs containing both naturally occurring and artificial mutations and truncated forms to CFTR to study the properties of the channel pore region. These studies as well as those using cysteine-scanning mutagenesis have pinpointed amino acid residues in the transmembrane segment 6 of TMD1 as critical to forming the main conductive pore of CFTR (3.Anderson M.P.

We have shown that RT2N2 CFTR (which comprises the R domain, the second transmembrane domain, and the second nucleotide domain) exhibits only a smaller nonselective conductance state of 4.0 pS. T2N2 CFTR (which comprises the second transmembrane domain and the second nucleotide domain) also exhibits a similar nonselective small conductance (13.Devidas S. Yue H. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29373-29380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study is to determine the domains of CFTR responsible for generating the two conductances of CFTR. The mutants TNR and dual-R CFTR were constructed as described previously (9.Morales M.M. Carroll T.P. Morita T. Schwiebert E.M. Devuyst O. Wilson P.D. Lopes A.G. Stanton B.A. Dietz H.C. Cutting G.R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 29373-29380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The cDNA fragments encoding the two second-half constructs were excised from their PBQ vector backbones using the restriction enzymes NotI and SalI. These were then subcloned into a pRSVCFTR vector that had been cut with the same two enzymes to excise out wild-type CFTR, followed by ligation using the Rapid DNA ligation kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) (13.Devidas S. Yue H. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29373-29380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells were used for expression of CFTR proteins. The different CFTR cDNAs were introduced into HEK 293 cells using the LipofecAMINE reagent. Cells were routinely studied 36–72 h after transfection (13.Devidas S. Yue H. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29373-29380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Methods used for excised, inside-out patch clamp recordings were described previously (13.Devidas S. Yue H. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29373-29380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The membrane potential was clamped at −75 to −100 mV, unless otherwise indicated. For excised, inside-out patch clamp experiments, bath solution containing (mm): NMDG-Cl 150, MgCl2 1.1, EGTA 2, TES 10 (pH 7.35 with NMDG); pipette solution containing (mM): NMDG-Cl 150, MgCl2 0.5, TES 10 (pH 7.35 with NMDG). To activate CFTR chloride channel, 75 nm PKA and 1 mm ATP were added to bath (cytoplasmic) solution. CFTR Cl− channels were recorded using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and pClamp data and acquisition and analysis software (version 6.03; Axon Instruments). CFTR Cl− channel currents were initially recorded on digital audiotape using a digital tape recorder at a bandwidth of 5 kHz. In playback mode, records were filtered at a 50–100-Hz corner frequency with a variable eight-pole Bessel filter (902LPF, Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA) and acquired using a Digidata 1200 interface (Axon Instruments, Inc.) and digitized at 2 kHz, open and closed events with duration less than 2–4 ms would not be detected (15.Colquhoun D. Sigworth F.J. Sakmann B. Neher E. Single Channel Recording. 2nd Ed. Plenum Publishing Co., New York1995: 483-587Google Scholar). Single-channel current amplitudes were determined from the fit of Gaussian distributions to all-points current amplitude histogram. A prompt was positioned by eye at each current level representing the closed state, the small conductance state, and the large conductance state. Single-channel open and closed time histograms were plotted with logarithmic x axes with 6 bins/decade, and the maximum likelihood method was used to fit a one or more component exponential to the data. All experiments were done at room temperature (22–25 °C). To assess bromide selectivity, patch pipettes were moved to a small home-made chamber where a complete bath solution change could be accomplished within 2–5 s. In halide selectivity experiments, bath NMDG-Cl was replaced by equimolar NMDG-Br or NMDG-I. In those experiments in which the bathing solution was changed, the ground electrode was connected to the bath solution via an agar salt bridge to minimize electrode junction potentials. Permeability ratios were calculated using the equationPx /P cl = exp(−E rev F/RT), whereE rev is the reversal potential and other terms have their usual meanings. We analyzed data only from patches that contained only a single active channel. We determined that a patch contained only a single channel if the simultaneous opening of two channel was not observed during the course of experiment, and an experiment typically lasted 15–45 min. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. of nobservations. Statistical significance was assessed using a paired or unpaired Student's t test as appropriate. Differences were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. All tests were performed using Origin (version 5.0). Fig.1 (wt-CFTR) shows a representative single-channel recording of wild-type CFTR measured in an excised inside-out patch in the presence of 1 mm ATP and 75 nm PKA. Careful examination of the tracing shows that, when CFTR conducts Cl−, there are two amplitudes of openings: a larger main amplitude and a smaller amplitude. This is clearly evident in the amplitude histogram. The histogram shows three amplitudes corresponding to the larger opening (O1), the smaller opening (O2), and the closed state (C). To ask whether the two open amplitude of CFTR is generated from different parts of CFTR, we have divided CFTR into two parts, TNR CFTR (which comprises the first transmembrane domain, the first nucleotide domain, and the R domain) and RT2N2 CFTR (which comprises the R domain, the second transmembrane domain, and the second nucleotide domain). Although both constructs contain the “R” domain, the two constructs represent the first and second halves of CFTR. Examining the representative recordings and corresponding amplitude histograms in Fig. 1 measured under the same conditions used to analyze wild-type CFTR, shows that the first half construct, TNR, and second half construct T2N2 CFTR generate only one amplitude of opening. Important, however, is that TNR generates an amplitude corresponding to the larger amplitude, whereas T2N2 CFTR generates an amplitude corresponding to the smaller amplitude of opening of wild-type CFTR. Co-expression of TNR CFTR and T2N2 CFTR results in the restoration of a wild-type pattern of single-channel activity, with the two amplitudes of opening. Table I summarizes the single-channel characteristics of these mutant forms of CFTR. The conductance of the large opening of CFTR is not significantly different among all of the mutants that contain TMD1. Likewise, the conductance of the smaller opening is also similar among all of the mutants containing TMD2. The open probability of the large conductance state is also constant among all of the constructs containing TMD1. This probably reflects the presence of an intact R domain in each. Throughout all of the mutants containing TMD2, open probability of the smaller conductance state is consistently 3–4 times less than that of the larger conductance. Although part of the diminished probability of the smaller conductance state may be the result of masking of some of the openings of the small conductance by the larger conductance events, the significant difference in open probability between the large and small conductances is evidence that the two states are independent.Table IThe large and small conductance open state in different CFTR constructsConstructnLarge conductance stateSmall conductance stateConductanceP oSelectivityConductanceP oSelectivitypSpSWild type49.71 ± 0.240.45 ± 0.04Br− > Cl− > I−3.31 ± 0.090.10 ± 0.02Br− = Cl−aIodide selectivity was not determined because the reduction in the amplitude of main conductance state made it difficult to distinguish the main conductance from the subconductance states.TNR39.18 ± 0.250.43 ± 0.03Br− > Cl− > I−T2N253.76 ± 0.500.15 ± 0.03Br− = Cl− = I−RT2N254.0 ± 0.510.18 ± 0.03Br− = Cl− = I−TNR+T2N249.65 ± 0.310.41 ± 0.05Br−> Cl− > I−3.55 ± 0.320.13 ± 0.04Br− = Cl−aIodide selectivity was not determined because the reduction in the amplitude of main conductance state made it difficult to distinguish the main conductance from the subconductance states.Dual-R53.18 ± 0.430.12 ± 0.05Br− = Cl− = I−Values are means ± S.E. of n observations.P o was defined as the ratio of open channel area (A o) to the total area (A o +A c) in the all-points amplitude histogram:P o = A o/A o +A c.a Iodide selectivity was not determined because the reduction in the amplitude of main conductance state made it difficult to distinguish the main conductance from the subconductance states.

We also tested the Cl− conduction mutations, R334W and R347P. Each of these residues was shown to be important in the Cl− conductance of the 9-pS pore of CFTR (16.Sheppard D.N. Rich D.P. Ostedgaard L.S. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1993; 362: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 17.Tabcharani J.A. Rommens J.M. Hou Y.X. Chang X.B. Tsui L.C. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Nature. 1993; 366: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In a previous report (18.Gadsby D.C. Nagel G. Hwang T.C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 387-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), we tested the hypothesis that insertion of arginine point mutations together could severely affect the Cl− conductance within CFTR. As expected the “dual-arginine” mutants, R334W/R347P, in full-length CFTR severely reduced whole cell Cl− currents in airways cells transiently transfected with this mutant. Single-channel studies (Fig.2, Table I) conduced for this study show that introduction of two mutations in critical residues in transmembrane segment 6 that are implicated in forming the pore eliminates larger amplitude events but retains the smaller amplitude openings consistent with those generated by the second half of CFTR. To study further the properties of CFTR, we measured the anion selectivity of the two conductive states. The single-channel recording shown in the upper panel of Fig.3 was measured in the presence of Cl−, 1 mm ATP, and 75 nm PKA. Again, wild type clearly displays two conductance states. The current amplitude of large conductance state is 0.56 ± 0.04 pA, and small conductance state is 0.25 ± 0.06 pA at V m = −60 mV. The single-channel recording depicted in the bottompanel of Fig. 2 shows that, after replacing the bath solution chloride by the same concentration of bromide, the current amplitude of large conductance state significantly increased to 0.85 ± 0.08 pA, but the small conductance state is not changed. The same result could be repeated (n = 4). In order to show that the independence of gating of the large and small conductance pores, we measured Po of both conductances at a relatively low concentration of ATP (Fig.4). The tracing shows the transition from closed to open and from open to closed states of the small conductance channel are independent of the larger state. In the presence of 0.5 mm ATP, the Po of the large conductance state is 0.2 ± 0.03 (n = 4), and that of the small conductance state is 0.08 ± 0.01 (n= 4). Raising the ATP concentration to 1 mm (see Fig. 1,upper tracing) increases thePo of the large conductance state by about 2.2-fold to 0.45 ± 0.04 (n = 4). In contrast, thePo of the small conductance state only increases about 1.2 times to 0.10 ± 0.01 (n = 4). This indicates that the two conductance states gate independently of each other. Fig. 5 A shows that the pattern of gating of wild-type CFTR is characterized by bursts of activity interrupted by brief flickery closures. The bursts of activity are separated by longer closures between bursts. Vanadate, which is a Pi analogue, in the presence of ATP, increased the duration of the long bursts. These data are consistent with that of other laboratories (10.Sheppard D.N. Ostedgaard L.S. Rich D.P. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1091-1098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), which have proposed that hydrolysis of ATP by NBD2 leads to channel closing. The increase of burst duration observed with vanadate is thought to occur by preventing NBD2 from inducing channel closing events (18.Gadsby D.C. Nagel G. Hwang T.C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 387-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 19.Hwang T.C. Nagel G. Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To determine whether the gating of the smaller conductance channel is also affected by ATP, we applied vanadate to the second half construct, RT2N2 CFTR. Fig. 5 B shows that burst duration of the small amplitude channel also increases in the presence of ATP and PKA after addition of 1 mm vanadate. After addition of 1 mm VO4 in the presence of 1 mm ATP and 75 nm PKA, the Po of the large conductance of CFTR increases about 2.1-fold from 0.46 ± 0.01 to 0.96 ± 0.01 (n = 3) and Po of RT2N2 increases about 2.9-fold from 0.18 ± 0.01 to 0.53 ± 0.01 (n = 3). This suggests that vanadate via the action of NBD2 can control the interburst duration of both the larger and smaller amplitude channels of CFTR. Our data immediately raise the question whether the small conductance state is not a part of CFTR but a separate channel regulated by CFTR. We argue that the subconductance state is part of CFTR for three reasons. The data in Fig. 4 show that, although the gating is independent, the open probability of the subconductance state is regulated by ATP and responds to increases in ATP by increasing open probability. The data in Fig. 5 show that both conductance states respond to vanadate. More importantly, the number of subconductance states corresponds to the number of CFTR channels in a patch. As shown in Fig. 1, in recordings with only one CFTR, there is only one large and one subconductance state. In patches with multiple channels, the number of smaller conductances corresponds to the number of channels. This is clearly shown in Fig. 4 B. Shown here is a patch with four large conductance states. Note that in this patch there are four large and four small conductance states. Finally, no small channels sensitive to ATP and PKA are present in nontransfected cells (Fig.4). Like many other channels, the CFTR Cl− channel exhibits a distinct subconductance state, which has been observed in both patch clamp (12.McDonough S. Davidson N. Lester H.A. McCarty N.A. Neuron. 1994; 13: 623-634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 20.Lansdell K.A. Kidd J.F. Delaney S.J. Wainwright B.J. Sheppard D.N. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28084-28091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying the multiple conductance states of CFTR channel is poorly understood. The significance of this report is that we show that CFTR has two opening events, a main opening corresponding to a conductance of 9 pS and a smaller opening corresponding to a conductance of 3 pS. The open probability of the two conductances is not the same. Transitions from closed to open states of the smaller conductance do not depend upon the open or closed state of the larger conductance. Each of the conductances has a different selectivity. All of these characteristics suggest that the two conductances as functional units behave independently. Our data also show that the first half of CFTR contributes to the larger conductance, whereas the smaller conductance depends upon the presence of NBD2, indicating that the two conductances are formed by separate domains of CFTR. McDough observed (12.McDonough S. Davidson N. Lester H.A. McCarty N.A. Neuron. 1994; 13: 623-634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) that wild-type CFTR and T1134F mutant CFTR occasionally showed a long-lived subconductance state with amplitude ∼60% of the full conductance in Xenopus oocytes. Lansdell observed (20.Lansdell K.A. Kidd J.F. Delaney S.J. Wainwright B.J. Sheppard D.N. J. Physiol. 1998; 512: 751-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) that murine CFTR commonly opens to a very small subconductance state. The single-channel conductance of the subconductance state (O1) of murine CFTR is just 10% that of the full open state (O2). Interestingly, open probability,Po , of the subconductance is approximately 7 times greater than that of the larger conductance. Clearly the major opening event in murine CFTR is at the low or subconductance state. This is clearly opposite of what is found in human CFTR where the open probability of the large conductance is about 3 times greater than the smaller conductance. Lansdell and collaborators (20.Lansdell K.A. Kidd J.F. Delaney S.J. Wainwright B.J. Sheppard D.N. J. Physiol. 1998; 512: 751-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have shown that murine and human CFTR are regulated quite differently. For example, neither PKC protein phosphatase inhibitors increase open probability in murine CFTR to levels comparable to human CFTR. The authors interpret their data by suggesting that differences in regulation between human and murine CFTR is caused by differences in the regulation of the subconductance state of murine CFTR. This is further evidence that the main and subconductances of CFTR are separate. Ma and collaborator (22.Tao T. Xia J. Drumm M.L. Zhao J. Davis P.B. Ma J. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 743-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 23.Xie J. Drumm M.L. Ma J. Davis P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28084-28091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) observed three independent open conductance states (high, medium, and low) measured in stable single-channel recordings when CFTR is studied in planar bilayers. The transitions between these conductances are affected by the presence or absence of Mg2+ in the extracellular solution, with millimolar concentrations of Mg2+ stabilizing the high conductance state. They suggest two possibilities to explain their data. One possibility is that a single CFTR molecule can exist in multiple configurations generating different conductance states. Alternately, CFTR channels may comprise multimers of the 170-kDa CFTR protein. It would follow that different conductance states would arise from different aggregations of CFTR protein. It has been suggested that ClC0, the chloride channel from theTorpedo electric organ, functions as a dimer with two conductive pores (24.Ludewig U. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 25.Middleton R.E. Pheasant D.J. Miller C. Nature. 1996; 383: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). At the single-channel level, ClC0 has a dual gating behavior. On one level, the two pores of ClC0 gate individually via a fast voltage- and anion-dependent gating mechanism. The gating pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that permeation and fast gating of individual pores of ClC0 are fully independent of the neighboring pore. On another level, a slower common gating mechanism operates on both pores simultaneously. A dual gating mechanism is also evident in CFTR. Both the small and large conductances of CFTR are activated by PKA and require ATP for activation to occur. Vanadate prolongs the open state of both large and small conductances indicating a common requirement for ATP in the gating mechanism. Once activated, however, the large and small conductances of CFTR gate independently with much different open probabilities. The question arises: is CFTR a double-barreled ion channel, or is there only one pore with at least two subconductances? Taken together, our data support the notion that CFTR, like ClC0, has two pores, one contributed by the first half and another by the second half. We thank Dr. S. Wang and Dr. J. Wright for helpful discussions. We thank Lixian Jin for excellent technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2071105945,"This special section looks at the generation of the Drosophila genome sequence from a variety of perspectives—from the historical to the technical to forecasts of the future. For a more global discussion of our perception of the scientific and political significance of the findings, please see the Editorial on p. [2157][1]; here we present an introductory map to guide you. “How close is the genome sequence to being really complete? How was the assembly done?” Adams et al. (p. [2185][2]) present an overview of the status of the project, including an attempt to define completion. Information about the multiple stages of the assembly process and the methods used to validate the sequence can be found in Myers et al. (p. [2196][3]). See also the Report on the bacterial artificial chromosome-based physical map and clones for chromosomes 2 and 3 of Drosophila that were used in the assembly and validation process (Hoskins et al. , p. [2271][4]).

The initial attempts to annotate the sequence in order to identify genes and begin to predict their function were made in a unique meeting that is described as “a Woodstock for science nerds” in the News story by Elizabeth Pennisi. The fruits of this labor can be found in a foldout summarizing the coding content of Drosophila and in discussions of the gene complement needed for fundamental operations, including DNA replication, transcription, and translation. Comparisons of protein families in Drosophila , Caenorhabditis elegans , and yeast can be found in Rubin et al. (p. [2204][5]) as well as a look at developmental and cellular processes and similarities to human disease genes. The Drosophila genome provides further evidence that evolution to more complex forms of life does not principally depend on the generation of new genes, but on new combinations of protein domains or novel interactions. However, as you will see in these pages, even this initial examination of the genome revealed surprises that could not have been predicted from other organisms and that will open doors to new research.

To help in digesting this mass of information, the three Reviews are accompanied by other short pieces. A historical Viewpoint is presented by Rubin and Lewis (p. [2216][6]), two descendants of the traditions of the Fly Room at Columbia University, where so much of the early history was made. In the Perspectives section, Brenner (p. [2173][7]) uses the sequencing of Drosophila as a starting point to discuss the issues facing pre- and postgenomic genetics. Three Viewpoint pieces focus on directions for the future. The cDNA resource described by Rubin et al. (p. [2222][8]) will be crucial for studies of gene expression and protein function. Benos et al. (p. [2220][9]) give us an advance look at the insights that are being gained by the European Drosophila Genome Project from their analysis of the tip of the X chromosome, including an explanation for a puzzling structural feature. Kornberg and Krasnow (p. [2218][10]) describe how the universal language of DNA will have profound implications for the use of Drosophila as a model system in understanding biological processes and human disease.

The process is known to involve multiple intracellular compartments and associated proteins, many of which are yet to be identified. Recently, we purified three distinct insulin-sensitive intracellular GLUT4 compartments (G4TL, G4H, and G4L) in rat adipocytes and unraveled several new resident proteins in these compartments. Here, we describe one of them, a 62-kDa protein, purified and identified as rat adipose tissue carboxyl esterase (p62/CE) by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectroscopy, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, gene cloning, and immunological and enzymatic activity measurements. p62/CE in rat adipocytes was 80% cytosolic and 20% microsome-associated. It was found in all of the three insulin-sensitive intracellular GLUT4 compartments, and particularly enriched in G4TL, a compartment thought to represent GLUT4 endocytic vesicles. Significantly, an antibody against p62/CE introduced into rat adipocytes completely abolished the insulin-induced GLUT4 recruitment to the plasma membrane in host cells without affecting the basal GLUT4 distribution. Together, these findings suggest that p62/CE plays a key role in insulin-induced GLUT4 recruitment in rat adipocytes, probably by hydrolyzing acylglycerols or acyl-CoA esters to the respective free acids that are required for GLUT4 transport vesicle budding and/or fusion.

Compartment-specific association of these proteins and their role in GLUT4 recycling and recruitment, however, are also unknown. By using hypotonic lysis, differential centrifugation, and glycerol gradient velocity sedimentation, we (19.Lee W. Ryu J. Souto R.P. Pilch P.F. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37755-37762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) have recently separated GLUT4 in rat adipocytes into four distinct fractions, namely, TH , TL , H, and L. Data of endosomal and organelle-specific marker distribution revealed that the fraction TH contains both intracellular and plasma membrane GLUT4 compartments (designated as G4TH and G4PM, respectively), whereas GLUT4 in the fractions TL, H, and L represents exclusively intracellular compartments (designated as G4TL, G4H, and G4L, respectively). Furthermore, GLUT4 compartments in these fractions were distinct in response to insulin; insulin treatment reduced G4H and G4L compartments and increased G4TL compartment. Based on these findings, we suggested that G4H and G4L represent the putative GLUT4 storage endosomes and GLUT4 exocytic vesicles, respectively, while G4TLrepresents GLUT4 endocytic vesicles. G4TL, G4H, and G4L have been purified by immunoadsorption and shown to be distinct in protein composition. In the present study, we describe an association of a 62-kDa protein with these immunopurified GLUT4 compartments. MALDI-TOF MS, RT-PCR, gene cloning, immunoreactivity, and enzyme activity assay identified this protein as a neutral carboxyl esterase expressed in rat adipocytes (20.Tsujita T. Okuda H. Yamasaki N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 715: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Most importantly, the p62/CE antibody selectively abolished the insulin-induced GLUT4 redistribution to the cell surface in semipermeabilized rat adipocytes, without affecting the basal GLUT4 distribution. Based on these findings, we propose a working hypothesis that p62/CE modulates lipid metabolites in GLUT4 compartments and regulates membrane budding and fusion required for the insulin-induced GLUT4 recruitment in rat adipocytes. Collagenase (type I) was obtained from Worthington. 1F8 was purchased from Biogenesis Ltd. (Sandown, NH). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled protein A and anti-mouse IgG were fromZymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Antibody against rat adipose tissue carboxyl esterase (p62/CE) was raised in rabbits using purified rat adipose tissue carboxylesterase (21.Tsujita T. Okuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23489-23494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides primers were from IDT (Lexington, KY). Adipocytes were isolated from epididymal fat pads of male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats and stabilized as described (22.Liu H. Xiong S. Shi Y. Samuel S.J. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7869-7875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Adipocytes were then lysed as described (19.Lee W. Ryu J. Souto R.P. Pilch P.F. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37755-37762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) using hypotonic lysing medium (0.25 mm ATP, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmCaCl2, 0.1 mm NAD, 0.05 mm NADP, and 1 mm KHCO3, pH 7.4) (23.Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5744-5750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The procedures have been described (19.Lee W. Ryu J. Souto R.P. Pilch P.F. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37755-37762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, adipocyte lysates (from 3–5 rats) were centrifuged at 900 × g for 15 min and the resulting pellet (900 × g pellet) was resuspended in 600 μl of NaCl/HEPES buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4). The 900 × g supernatant was centrifuged at 185,000 ×g for 2 h, and the pellet (185,000 × gpellet) was resuspended in 600 μl of NaCl/HEPES buffer. Suspension of 900 × g or 185,000 × g pellet, without or after sonication (in a bath type sonicator, for 2 h at 4 °C), was then layered onto 9 ml of 5–30% glycerol gradient prepared in NaCl/HEPES buffer over 400 μl of 50% (w/v) sucrose pad in 10-cm height. Suspension on gradient was centrifuged in a 40.2SW rotor (Beckman) at 60,000 × g for 1 h, and 13 fractions were collected from the bottom to the top (P and 1–12). This typically separated GLUT4 into two peaks: a sharp, heavy peak (fractions P, 1, and 2) and a broad, light peak (mostly recovered in fractions 8–10). They were separately pooled, and designated as fractions TH and TL for 900 ×g pellet and fractions H and L for 185,000 ×g pellet, respectively. 1F8 or normal mouse IgG was coupled to Tris acrylic beads (Reacti-Gel GF2000; Pierce) at a concentration of 0.7 mg of antibody/ml of resin according to the manufacturer's instructions. The antibody on beads was quenched by 2 mTris (pH 8.0) for 1 h, incubated with 2% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (134 mm NaCl, 2.6 mmKCl, 6.4 mm Na2HPO4, 1.46 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) for 2 h to block nonspecific binding and washed five times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature. Fractions TLand L and sonicated fraction H (100 μg of protein each) were incubated with 30 μl of beads overnight at 4 °C, beads were settled down spontaneously, and unbound supernatants were collected for analysis. Beads were washed five times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C, and then the adsorbed materials were eluted with SDS (2%)-containing Laemmli buffer without β-mercaptoethanol for 1 h at room temperature. Solubilized membrane in Laemmli solution was subjected to SDS-PAGE on 8, 10, 12, or 15% resolving gels as described (24.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad), blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline, and incubated with primary antibodies in TTBS (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20) containing 1% nonfat milk. After overnight incubation, membranes were washed with TTBS and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled protein A (for the detection of polyclonal antibodies) or horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG (for the detection of monoclonal antibodies). Proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescent substrate kit (NEN Life Science Products). Immunoblot intensities were quantitated by densitometry using an analytical scanning system (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Proteins resolved by gel electrophoresis were visualized by silver staining (25.Schoenle E.J. Adams L.D. Sammons D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12112-12119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and rinsed with 1% acetic acid. Selected bands, including the one corresponding to 62 kDa, were excised into Eppendorf tube with a clean scalpel, and 10 μl of 1% acetic acid was added. Protein samples were subjected to protein identification based on MALDI-TOF MS analysis after tryptic digestion at Borealis Biosciences Inc. (Toronto, Canada) as described (26.Yates III, J.R. J. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 33: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA of rat adipose tissue was prepared using the FastTract 2.0 kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. 2.5 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, Tfl DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI), primers and 1.5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA of rat adipose tissue were used for reverse transcription and amplification with DNA Thermal Cycler (Perkin-Elmer Cetus, Warrington, United Kingdom). Primer sets were derived from sequences located in three different conserved sites of rat carboxyl esterase (27.Satoh T. Hosokawa M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 257-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar): CE-S1–5′, GGAGGTGGACTGGTAGTGGGT (469–489); CE-S1–3′, AATGATCCAGCCAAACTCTTG (1102–1122); CE-S2–5′, TGCCTCTACCTGAACGTTTAT (394–414); CE-S2–3′, ACCTCCTGCAGATTCTCC (703–720); CE-S3–5′, GGAGAATCTGCAGGAGGT (703–720); CE-S3–3′, GAAGAGTTCATCACCATG (1444–1461). Membranes preblotted with poly(A)+ RNA from rat adipose tissue were used for detection of carboxyl esterase. The RT-PCR product from rat adipocytes poly(A)+ RNA was labeled with 32P using the Prime-a-Gene labeling kit (Promega) and used as the probe. Hybridization, washing, and stripping of the blots were done according to instructions provided by CLONTECH. The general procedure has been described (22.Liu H. Xiong S. Shi Y. Samuel S.J. Lachaal M.

After incubation at 37 °C for 15 h, the cells were collected from the culture by centrifugation (11,000 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C) and used for double-stranded DNA preparation (Promega Wizard DNA purification kit). p62 full sequence flanked with the SmaI restriction site on both ends was generated by RT-PCR. SmaI-restricted vector DNA and p62/SmaI fragment were ligated at 14 °C and 16 h. The ligation mix was transformed into the competent E. coli DH5α or BL21. From the transformant E. colicolony, we purified double-stranded DNA and carried out DNA sequencing. Seed cultures in 100 ml of LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) were obtained by inoculating one loop of E. coli BL21 containing pGEX-3X/p62 and incubating at 200 rpm and 37 °C for 15 h. 1 liter of LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) was inoculated with the seed cultures and cultivated at 37 °C and 200 rpm for 2.5 h. At that time, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration to 0.2 mm) was added and incubated for another 4 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with phosphate-buffered saline buffer (pH 7.3) on a GS-3 rotor for 10 min at 7700 × g at 4 °C, and were stored at −70 °C until use. The p62 protein was purified by sonication, 1% Triton X-100 treatment, glutathione-agarose bead (Sigma) treatment, and factor Xa digestion, essentially as described (22.Liu H. Xiong S. Shi Y. Samuel S.J. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7869-7875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The degree of purification was determined by using 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Carboxyl esterase activity against the water-soluble substrate para-nitrophenyl butyric acid was determined by spectrophotometric method (28.DiPersio L.P. Fontaine R.N. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4033-4036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this procedure, the samples were diluted with 0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4 or 8.0) or sodium acetate (pH 5.0) in the presence of 6 mmtaurocholate. The assay was initiated by adding a freshly preparedpara-nitrophenyl butyric acid solution (100 μg/ml in sodium acetate, pH 5.0). Carboxyl esterase activity was then monitored and compared with control autohydrolysis of the substrate using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech spectrophotometer set at 405 nm. Adipocytes were permeabilized with SLO as described (29.Martin L.B. Shewan A. Millar C.A. Gould G.W. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1444-1452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Adipocytes were washed with cold intracellular buffer (140 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm NaCl, pH 7.2) and incubated with intracellular buffer containing 200 units/ml of SLO at room temperature for 15 min. Adipocytes were washed twice with intracellular buffer containing 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin and ATP-regenerating system (40 IU/ml creatine phosphokinase, 5 mm creatine phosphate, and 1 mm ATP) and incubated with 0.5 mg/ml anti-carboxyl esterase antibody or normal rabbit IgG for 40 min at 37 °C. When specified, adipocytes were treated with insulin (100 nm) for the last 20 min of the permeabilization protocol above. DNA sequencing was done at the SUNY at Buffalo Sequencing Laboratory. Protein was determined with a BCA kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Adipocyte membrane fractions enriched with plasma membranes (PMs) and low density microsomes (LDMs) were prepared after homogenization as described (3.Jhun B.H Rampal A.L. Liu H. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17710-17715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Particulate fractions TH, TL, H, and L (19.Lee W. Ryu J. Souto R.P. Pilch P.F. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37755-37762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) were prepared from rat adipocytes by hypotonic lysis, differential centrifugation, and glycerol gradient velocity sedimentation (see “Experimental Procedures”). The GLUT4 compartments in fractions TL, H, and L, (G4TL, G4H, and G4L, respectively) (19.Lee W. Ryu J. Souto R.P. Pilch P.F. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37755-37762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) were purified by immunoadsorption using 1F8 (see “Experimental Procedures”). GLUT4 in the fraction TH(G4TH) was not immunoadsorbable by 1F8 and thus was not studied further here. Typical separation of protein species and GLUT4 in fractions TL, H, and L (100 μg of protein each) during immunoadsorption is illustrated in Fig.1. With each of these fractions, very little protein was found in materials bound to nonimmune IgG, while a number of distinct protein bands were visible in materials bound to 1F8. Furthermore, the proteins in immunoadsorbed vesicles to 1F8 differed in species and relative abundance between the fractions. GLUT4 was detected only in 1F8 adsorbates in immunoblot (Fig. 1), clearly indicating that the interaction of some of these proteins with GLUT4 is compartment-specific. A protein with an apparent molecular mass of 120 kDa (band a in Fig. 1) showed differential enrichment between individual GLUT4 compartments, being highest in G4L and lowest in G4TL. A protein with apparent molecular mass of 62 kDa (band b in Fig. 1) was clearly detectable in all of these purified GLUT4 compartments, although it was particularly enriched in G4TL. The immunoadsorption procedure described in Fig. 1 was scaled up to purify proteins in sufficient quantities for sequence identification, using fraction H because of its large protein yield and GLUT4 compartment size. Proteins in 1F8-immunoadsorbed materials were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining as in Fig. 1. Selected protein bands (marked as a and b in Fig.1) in gel were excised and digested with trypsin, and resulting peptide fragments were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS (see “Experimental Procedures”). Such an analysis performed for 62-kDa protein (b in Fig. 1) is shown in TableI. From the linear tryptic spectrum, 19 potent peptide fragments were matched with rat hepatic neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase (nCEH; EC 3.1.1.13) (GenBankTMaccession no. L46791) (30.Ghosh S. Mallonee D.H. Hylemon P.B. Grogan W.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Similarly, MALDI-TOF MS of tryptic fragments of 120-kDa protein (a in Fig. 1) indicated its potential identity with KIAA0339 (GenBankTM accession no.AB002337), a protein containing ATP/GTP binding site motif A, whose function is not known (31.Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Ohira M. Seki N. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1997; 4: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Further characterization of this protein will be considered in a separate report.Table IAnalysis of p62 by MALDI-TOF MSMassMatching sequences with nCEH2845.8Glu106–Lys1291628.5Phe65 –Lys781709.1Leu172 –Arg1863232.6Ala243 –Lys2741375.8Thr275 –Lys2862891.5Thr275 –Lys2991534.7Gln287 –Lys2992662.7Ser378 –Lys4003998.2Ser378 –Lys4121071.7Tyr401 –Lys4102800.0Asp437 –Lys4603918.9Thr461 –Lys496927.5Tyr497 –Arg5032863.0Tyr497 –Lys5121244.8Ile527 –Lys5382604.5Ile527 –Arg5491621.4Leu537 –Arg5491136.7Leu537 –Lys551830.4Glu541 –Arg549 Open table in a new tab To confirm the expression of nCEH in rat adipocytes, we performed RT-PCR in rat adipocytes using three different primer sets (see “Experimental Procedures”) designed from three highly conserved regions of nCEH sequence, CE-S1, -2, and -3 (27.Satoh T. Hosokawa M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 257-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar), using β-actin as a control. RT-PCR using the primer sets for nCEH produced corresponding size of DNA from rat adipose tissue mRNA (Fig.2 A). To further confirm the identity of p62 with nCEH, we sequenced the CE-S1-, CE-S2-, and CE-S3-amplified DNA segments from poly(A)+ RNA of rat adipose tissue obtained above. The sequence was found to be 99.7% identical to that of rat hepatic nCEH mRNA (with five nucleotide differences out of 1695 nucleotides). Next, CE-S1, -2, and -3 above were labeled by random priming with [32P]dATP and used as probes for Northern blot analysis. A typical result of the Northern blot with CE-S1 is illustrated in Fig.2 B, again using β-actin as a control. p62 mRNA was detected in rat adipose tissue at appropriate size (about 1.9 kb), demonstrating that a nCEH-like protein p62 (hereafter referred to as p62/CE) is indeed expressed in rat adipose tissue. We cloned p62/CE (GenBankTM accession number AF171640). Deduced amino acid sequence of cloned p62/CE was identical to that of rat liver carboxyl esterase (ES-10) (32.Robbi M. Beaufay H. Octave J.N. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) with an exception of one residue (Asn instead of Lys at position 265). It was also identical to that of rat hepatic nCEH (30.Ghosh S. Mallonee D.H. Hylemon P.B. Grogan W.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) with an exception of three (Ala, Ser, and Lys instead of Glu, Thr, and Gln, at 420, 491, and 492, respectively) residues. We expressed the clone and purified the recombinant protein. The recombinant p62/CE possessed carboxyl esterase activity; it hydrolyzedpara-nitrophenyl butyric acid in vitro (Fig.3). The esterase activity displayed a simple Michaelis type of kinetics with estimated K mand V max values of 0.76 mm and 1.45 units/mg, respectively. The enzyme activity was approximately 2.5-fold greater at pH 8 than at pH 5 (not illustrated), indicating that p62/CE is a neutral carboxyl esterase (20.Tsujita T. Okuda H. Yamasaki N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 715: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A carboxyl esterase, known as FAEE synthase/CE, has been purified from rat adipose tissue by one of us (20.Tsujita T. Okuda H. Yamasaki N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 715: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and partially characterized. A polyclonal antibody was raised using the purified protein of this carboxyl esterase (21.Tsujita T. Okuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23489-23494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antibody has been shown to be highly specific to the enzyme; it reacted with only one protein in rat adipose tissue extract with no other cross-reactive protein. Furthermore, The antibody inhibited CE activity in rat adipose tissue but not other carboxyl ester-hydrolyzing enzymes in the tissue including lipoprotein lipase, hormone-sensitive lipase, cholesterol esterase, and cholinesterase. This antibody cross-reacted with purified recombinant p62/CE in immunoblot (Fig. 2 C). Although the DNA sequence has not been reported, the N-terminal 27-amino acid sequence of FAEE synthase/CE has been known (21.Tsujita T. Okuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23489-23494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is identical to that of p62/CE, suggesting that the two are the same protein. The antibody inhibited the esterase activity of purified p62/CE recombinant protein in vitro(Fig. 3). The antibody also reacted with the rat liver carboxyl esterase (ES-10) and rat hepatic nCEH (21.Tsujita T. Okuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23489-23494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We refer to this antibody as anti-p62/CE antibody and have used it here for characterization of p62/CE in rat adipocytes. Direct testing of the identity of p62 purified from the GLUT4 compartment with cloned p62/CE was felt to be imperative at this point. To this end, we immunoadsorbed fraction H by 1F8, separated the adsorbed proteins by SDS-PAGE, and dissected the 62-kDa protein band in gel. This is the protein sample that we used for MALDI-TOF MS analysis discussed above. When the protein in gel was microeluted and immunoprecipitated with FAEE synthase/CE antibody (Fig.4), more than 80% of p62 was precipitated as assessed by either immunoblotting or protein staining, while none was precipitated by normal IgG. This clearly establishes the identity of purified p62 with cloned p62/CE, and further justifies the use of the antibody for characterization of p62 or p62/CE in rat adipocytes below. Subcellular fractionation followed by immunoblotting revealed that p62/CE was mostly in the cytosol, and 18–20% was associated with particulate fraction (not illustrated). Relative distribution of p62/CE within particulate fraction was assessed by immunoblotting fractions TH, TL, H, and L in comparison with the respective GLUT4 compartment sizes (Fig.5). Relative abundance of p62/CE was approximately 40, 10, 45, and 5% for TH, TL, H, and L, respectively, for basal adipocytes. Exposure of adipocytes to insulin did not change p62/CE association significantly in these fractions. This is in contrast to the changes in GLUT4 compartment size seen after cellular exposure to insulin, an increase in THand TL, and a decrease in H and L. This would indicate that the association of p62/CE with the GLUT4 compartment represents a relatively minor portion of the p62/CE in each of these particulate fractions. To assess direct association of p62/CE with GLUT4 compartments, we purified GLUT4 compartments in fractions TL, H, and L by immunoadsorption using basal and insulin-treated adipocytes as in Fig.1, and adsorbed materials were eluted and subjected to immunoblotting analysis using p62/CE antibody (Fig. 6). A single band with an apparent molecular mass of 62 kDa was immunolabeled in each of the 1F8 adsorbates but not in any of the nonimmune IgG adsorbates. When normalized against GLUT4 contents, the relative labeling intensities differed significantly between the three purified GLUT4 compartments; it was highest in G4TL and lowest in G4L. The relative immunostaining intensities (Fig. 6) largely paralleled with the p62 band protein staining intensities (Fig. 1). Insulin did not show any significant and reproducible effect on the p62/CE immunoreactive band intensities. The protein staining intensity of p62 in G4H was reduced significantly in some (two out of four independent experiments), but not all, insulin-treated adipocytes, the significance of which is not immediately clear. To investigate the functional significance of the association of p62/CE with GLUT4 compartments in insulin-induced GLUT4 recruitment, we introduced anti-p62/CE antibody into rat adipocytes and studied its effect on the steady-state distribution of endogenous GLUT4 between the PM and the LDM. Basal and insulin-stimulated adipocytes were permeabilized using SLO in the absence and in the presence of normal rabbit IgG or anti-p62/CE antibody (0.5 mg/ml each) (see “Experimental Procedures”), and PM and LDM fractions were isolated and subjected to immunoblot with GLUT4 antibody. In IgG-incorporated adipocytes, insulin increased the PM GLUT4 content 5–6-fold, with a concomitant reduction (by 25–30%) in the LDM GLUT4 level (Fig.7). These are essentially identical to the GLUT4 subcellular distributions observed in intact (nonpermeabilized) adipocytes (3.Jhun B.H Rampal A.L. Liu H. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17710-17715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar insulin effects on PM and LDM GLUT4 levels were observed in SLO-treated adipocytes in the absence of nonimmune IgG or antibody (data not illustrated). In p62/CE antibody-incorporated adipocytes, however, there was no observable difference in GLUT4 levels in PM or LDM between the basal and insulin-stimulated states (Fig. 7), indicating that the p62/CE antibody completely abolished insulin-stimulated GLUT4 redistribution. This occurred without affecting basal GLUT4 level (Fig. 7). GLUT4 recycling and its insulin-induced recruitment to the cell surface in adipocytes are known to involve multiple protein functions in multiple intracellular compartments (5.Pessin J.E. Thurmond D.C. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K.J. Okada S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2593-2596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 6.Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Gigengack S. Lienhard G.E. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Clear identification of the individual intracellular GLUT4 compartments and the associated protein functions involved in these processes has been elusive. Recent success in separation and partial purification of three distinct, intracellular GLUT4 compartments from hypotonically lysed rat adipocytes (19.Lee W. Ryu J. Souto R.P. Pilch P.F. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37755-37762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) allowed us to detect and study novel association of certain proteins with GLUT4 compartments that hitherto escaped from identification. Among these was a 62-kDa protein (Fig. 1), which we have identified here as adipose tissue neutral carboxyl esterase, p62/CE. This identity was first suggested by MALDI-TOF MS tryptic fragmentation spectrum profile analysis (Table I) and subsequently confirmed by RT-PCR (Fig. 2 A), Northern blotting (Fig.2 B), gene cloning (GenBankTM accession no.AF171640), enzyme activity assay (Fig. 3), and immunological cross-reactivity (Figs. 2 C and 4). Adipose tissue carboxyl esterase (FAEE synthase/CE) has been purified and partially characterized (20.Tsujita T. Okuda H. Yamasaki N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 715: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 21.Tsujita T. Okuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23489-23494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is a member of the mammalian carboxyl esterase (CE) superfamily (EC 3.1.1.1) (27.Satoh T. Hosokawa M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 257-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) and hydrolyzes a variety of esters including endogenous substrates such as short- and long-chain acylglycerols and long-chain acyl-CoA esters to the respective free acids with broad substrate specificity. The association of p62/CE with GLUT4 compartments is unequivocal both in protein staining (Fig. 1) and in immunoblotting (Fig. 6). p62/CE, like many other CE isoforms, contains the C-terminal four amino acids capable of conferring retention in the ER (32.Robbi M. Beaufay H. Octave J.N. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). There are exceptions to this ER retention signal rule, however (30.Ghosh S. Mallonee D.H. Hylemon P.B. Grogan W.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar); ES-10 and nCEH, for example, contain the N-terminal cleavable signal sequence and the C-terminal ER retention signal sequence, HVEL, yet ES-10 is exclusively found in ER lumen, whereas nCEH is mostly (about 80%) in the cytosol. It is quite possible that p62/CE may also reside in the ER, and this by itself would not necessarily contradict the presence of p62/CE in cytosol and its association with GLUT4 vesicles. Please also note that GLUT4-containing compartments purified by 1F8 in fractions TL, H, and L were free of ER, yet showed p62/CE immunoreactivity. In preliminary experiments, we have noted that 1m KCl or alkaline wash reduces p62/CE association with GLUT4 vesicles, suggesting cytoplasmic, rather than luminal, interaction of p62/CE with the vesicles. Quantitative assessment of the association of p62/CE with each of the GLUT4-compartments, however, was less than unequivocal, a problem not uncommon in assessment of extrinsic membrane protein binding to membranes. Notably, immunoblot data showed no clear insulin effect on p62/CE association in each GLUT4 compartment (Fig. 6), while an apparent reduction in p62/CE protein staining intensity in G4H was observed in some (19.Lee W. Ryu J. Souto R.P. Pilch P.F. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37755-37762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) but not all insulin-stimulated adipocytes (Fig.1). In protein staining data, p62/CE appeared more abundant in G4TL than in G4H or G4L (Fig. 1), although such a difference was not clearly seen in immunoblots (Fig. 6). However, when normalized against GLUT4 content, p62/CE was significantly more concentrated in G4TL in both assays (Figs. 1 and 6). G4TL is a compartment composed exclusively of small vesicles, free of integrin but enriched in transferrin receptor and Rab5, and thought to represent GLUT4 endocytic vesicles (19.Lee W. Ryu J. Souto R.P. Pilch P.F. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37755-37762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). p62/CE antibody in permeabilized rat adipocytes completely abolishes insulin-induced recruitment of GLUT4 without affecting basal GLUT4 distribution (Fig. 7). This, together with the fact that the antibody inhibits the esterase activity of p62/CE (Fig. 3), strongly suggests the importance of p62/CE or a p62/CE-catalyzed hydrolysis in the insulin-induced GLUT4 recruitment in adipocytes. The role of p62/CE in insulin-induced GLUT4 recruitment, however, is yet to be determined. An interesting possibility is that this neutral esterase hydrolyzes certain lipid component(s) in nonacidic, GLUT4 compartments such as sorting and/or recycling endosomes and regulates GLUT4 transport vesicle sorting, budding, or fusion. The high p62/CE concentration observed in G4TL and G4H, the presumed endocytic vesicles and recycling/storage endosomes, respectively, is consistent with this possibility. Endosomal lipids are known to undergo enzymatic processing (33.Hossain A. Hornick C.A. Horm. Metab. Res. 1994; 26: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of endosomal cholesterol ester by nCEH, for example, was implicated in free cholesterol transport vesicle sorting, budding, or fusion in cholesterol homeostasis (34.Hornick C.A. Hui D.Y. DeLamatre J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1075-C1081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, insulin-sensitive phospholipid signal pathways have been implicated in insulin-induced GLUT4 recruitment in rat adipocytes (35.Karnam P. Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6136-6140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Thus, the activation of phospholipase D-dependent phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis and de novo phosphatidic acid synthesis by insulin result in formation of phosphatidic acid- and phosphatidylinositol (4,5)P2-enriched microdomains in endosomes, which may promote vesicle formation, coat protein release, and/or fusion to target membranes (36.Liscovich M. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 659-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). At least two more enzymes that are involved in lipid metabolism, namely acyl-CoA synthetase-1 (14.Cormont M. Tanti J.F. Zahraoui A. Van Obberghen E.V. Tavitian A. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19491-19497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) andl-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (37.Shi Y.W. Samuel S.J. Lee W., Yu, C.H. Zhang W. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), have been suggested to play a role in GLUT4 regulation. How at the molecular level the endosomal lipid metabolism catalyzed by these enzymes and p62/CE regulates GLUT4 recycling and recruitment is an important question that deserves systematic investigation."

 explains in a lively Perspective, new findings
 (Holdaway and Jacomb) suggest that the moas became extinct within 100 years of the arrival of the Maoris in New Zealand, ten times more quickly than previously thought. Apparently, their slow reproductive rate meant that they were unable to replace their brethren killed by Maori hunters, resulting in their rapid extinction."
