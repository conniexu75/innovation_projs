https://openalex.org/W2781640727,"The type of fat in the diet determinates the characteristics of gut microbiota, exerting a major role in the development of metabolic syndrome. We hypothesize that a diet enriched with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) has a distinctive effect on the intestinal microbiome in comparison with an enriched butter diet (BT) and this effect is related to the physiological benefits exerted by EVOO. Swiss Webster mice were fed standard (SD) or two high fat diets enriched with EVOO or butter. Hormonal, physiological and metabolic parameters were evaluated. At the end of the feeding period, DNA was extracted from faeces and the 16S rRNA genes were pyrosequenced. Among the main significant differences found, BT triggered the highest values of systolic blood pressure, correlating positively with the percentage of Desulfovibrio sequences in faeces, which in turn showed significantly higher values in BT than in EVOO. EVOO had the lowest values of plasmatic insulin, correlating inversely with Desulfovibrio, and had the lowest plasmatic values of leptin which correlated inversely with Sutterellaceae, Marispirillum and Mucilaginibacter dageonensis, the three showing significantly higher percentages in EVOO. The lowest total cholesterol levels in plasma were detected in SD, correlating positively with Prevotella and Fusicatenibacter, both taxa with significantly greater presence in SD. These results may be indicative of a link between specific diets, certain physiological parameters and the prevalence of some taxa, supporting the possibility that in some of the proposed effects of virgin olive oil the modulation of intestinal microbiota could be involved."
https://openalex.org/W2781689834,"The UK is the largest lamb meat producer in Europe. However, the low profitability of sheep farming sector suggests production efficiency could be improved. Although the use of technologies such as Electronic Identification (EID) tools could allow a better use of flock resources, anecdotal evidence suggests they are not widely used. The aim of this study was to assess uptake of EID technology, and explore drivers and barriers of adoption of related tools among English and Welsh farmers. Farm beliefs and management practices associated with adoption of this technology were investigated. A total of 2000 questionnaires were sent, with a response rate of 22%. Among the respondents, 87 had adopted EID tools for recording flock information, 97 intended to adopt it in the future, and 222 neither had adopted it, neither intended to adopt it. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and multivariable logistic regression modelling were used to identify farmer beliefs and management practices significantly associated with adoption of EID technology. EFA identified three factors expressing farmer’s beliefs–external pressure and negative feelings, usefulness and practicality. Our results suggest farmer’s beliefs play a significant role in technology uptake. Non-adopters were more likely than adopters to believe that ‘government pressurise farmers to adopt technology’. In contrast, adopters were significantly more likely than non-adopters to see EID as practical and useful (p≤0.05). Farmers with higher information technologies literacy and intending to intensify production in the future were significantly more likely to adopt EID technology (p≤0.05). Importantly, flocks managed with EID tools had significantly lower farmer- reported flock lameness levels (p≤0.05). These findings bring insights on the dynamics of adoption of EID tools. Communicating evidence of the positive effects EID tools on flock performance and strengthening farmer’s capability in use of technology are likely to enhance the uptake of this technology in sheep farms."
https://openalex.org/W2782500353,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential transmission of HCV strains between HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) and HIV-negative MSM. Since 2000, an ongoing epidemic of HCV infections is observed among HIV-positive MSM in high-income countries. However, HCV infections in HIV-negative MSM are investigated to a lesser extent due to the lack of follow-up in this population and only limited information is available on the risk of HCV transmission between HIV-positive MSM and HIV-negative MSM. We enrolled 49 MSM of which 43 were HIV-positive and 6 HIV-negative, including 4 being enrolled or waiting for enrolment in a preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) program. All patients were diagnosed with acute HCV infection at the Infectious Disease Unit at the Hospices Civils de Lyon from 2014 to 2016. Risk factors for HCV infection were similar in both groups and included IV or nasal drug use, and rough sex practices. Typing and phylogenetic cluster analysis of HCV variants were performed by NS5B sequencing. Several clusters of infections were identified (genotype 1a: 3 clusters and 1 pair; genotype 4d: 1 cluster and 2 pairs), suggesting that several transmission events occurred within the study population. Every HCV strain identified in HIV-negative MSM was included in a cluster with HIV-positive MSM. Chronological analysis of contagiousness suggested the transmission of HCV from HIV-positive to HIV-negative patients. We conclude that recommendations for HCV surveillance should not be confined to HIV-positive MSM but should be extended to HIV-negative MSM with similar risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2781893963,"The cellular localisation of many innate signalling events following viral infection has yet to be elucidated, however there has been a few cases in which membranes of certain cellular organelles have acted as platforms to these events. Of these, lipid droplets (LDs) have recently been identified as signalling platforms for innate TLR7 and 9 signalling. Despite their wide range of similar roles in various metabolic pathways, LDs have been overlooked as potential platforms for antiviral innate signalling events. This study established an in vitro model to evaluate the efficiency of the early innate immune response in cells with reduced LD content to the viral mimics, dsDNA and dsRNA, and Sendai viral infection. Using RT-qPCR, the expression of IFN-β and IFN-λ was quantified following stimulation along with the expression of specific ISGs. Luciferase based assays evaluated the combined expression of ISRE-promoter driven ISGs under IFN-β stimulation. Cellular LD content did not alter the entry of fluorescently labelled viral mimics into cells, but significantly decreased the ability of both Huh-7 and HeLa cells to produce type I and III IFN, as well as downstream ISG expression, indicative of an impeded innate immune response. This observation was also seen during Sendai virus infection of HeLa cells, where both control and LD reduced cells replicated the virus to the same level, but a significantly impaired type I and III IFN response was observed in the LD reduced cells. In addition to altered IFN production, cells with reduced LD content exhibited decreased expression of specific antiviral ISGs: Viperin, IFIT-1 and OAS-1 under IFN-β stimulation; However the overall induction of the ISRE-promoter was not effected. This study implicates a role for LDs in an efficient early innate host response to viral infection and future work will endeavour to determine the precise role these important organelles play in induction of an antiviral response."
https://openalex.org/W2782519807,"There is increasing evidence for frequent turnover in sex chromosomes in vertebrates. Yet experimental systems suitable for tracing the detailed process of turnover are rare. In theory, homologous turnover is possible if the new sex-determining locus is established on the existing sex-chromosome. However, there is no empirical evidence for such an event. The genus Takifugu includes fugu (Takifugu rubripes) and its two closely-related species whose sex is most likely determined by a SNP at the Amhr2 locus. In these species, males are heterozygous, with G and C alleles at the SNP site, while females are homozygous for the C allele. To determine if a shift in the sex-determining locus occurred in another member of this genus, we used genetic mapping to characterize the sex-chromosome systems of Takifugu niphobles. We found that the G allele of Amhr2 is absent in T. niphobles. Nevertheless, our initial mapping suggests a linkage between the phenotypic sex and the chromosome 19, which harbors the Amhr2 locus. Subsequent high-resolution analysis using a sex-reversed fish demonstrated that the sex-determining locus maps to the proximal end of chromosome 19, far from the Amhr2 locus. Thus, it is likely that homologous turnover involving these species has occurred. The data also showed that there is a male-specific reduction of recombination around the sex-determining locus. Nevertheless, no evidence for sex-chromosome differentiation was detected: the reduced recombination depended on phenotypic sex rather than genotypic sex; no X- or Y-specific maker was obtained; the YY individual was viable. Furthermore, fine-scale mapping narrowed down the new sex-determining locus to the interval corresponding to approximately 300-kb of sequence in the fugu genome. Thus, T. niphobles is determined to have a young and small sex-determining region that is suitable for studying an early phase of sex-chromosome evolution and the mechanisms underlying turnover of sex chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W2781834421,"Zika is a re-emerging infection that has been considered a major threat to global public health. Currently at least 100 countries are at risk of Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission. Aedes aegypti is the main mosquito vector in the Americas. This vector is exposed to, and interacts symbiotically with a variety of microorganisms in its environment, which may result in the formation of a lifetime association. Here, the unknown effect that ZIKV exerts on the dynamic bacterial community harbored by this mosquito vector was investigated using a metagenomic analysis of its microbiota. Groups of Ae. aegypti were experimentally fed on sugar, blood and blood mixed with ZIKV, and held for 3 to 7 days after blood meal and eggs development respectively. The infected groups were processed by qPCR to confirm the presence of ZIKV. All groups were analyzed by metagenomics (Illumina Hiseq Sequencing) and 16S rRNA amplicon sequences were obtained to create bacterial taxonomic profiles. A core microbiota and exclusive bacterial taxa were identified that incorporate 50.5% of the predicted reads from the dataset, with 40 Gram-negative and 9 Gram-positive families. To address how ZIKV invasion may disturb the ecological balance of the Ae. aegypti microbiota, a CCA analysis coupled with an explanatory matrix was performed to support the biological interpretation of shifts in bacterial signatures. Two f-OTUs appeared as potential biomarkers of ZIKV infection: Rhodobacteraceae and Desulfuromonadaceae. Coincidentally, both f-OTUs were exclusively present in the ZIKV- infected blood-fed and ZIKV- infected gravid groups. In conclusion, this study shows that bacterial symbionts act as biomarkers of the insect physiological states and how they respond as a community when ZIKV invades Ae. aegypti. Basic knowledge of local haematophagous vectors and their associated microbiota is relevant when addressing transmission of vector-borne infectious diseases in their regional surroundings."
https://openalex.org/W2782220188,"We investigated how do environmental and climatic factors, but also management, affect the carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) stable isotope composition in bone collagen of the two largest contemporary herbivores: European bison (Bison bonasus) and moose (Alces alces) across Europe. We also analysed how different scenarios of population recovery- reintroduction in bison and natural recovery in moose influenced feeding habitats and diet of these two species and compared isotopic signatures of modern populations of bison and moose (living in human-altered landscapes) with those occurring in early Holocene. We found that δ13C of modern bison and moose decreased with increasing forest cover. Decreasing forest cover, increasing mean annual temperature and feeding on farm crops caused an increase in δ15N in bison, while no factor significantly affected δ15N in moose. We showed significant differences in δ13C and δ15N among modern bison populations, in contrast to moose populations. Variation in both isotopes in bison resulted from inter-population differences, while in moose it was mainly an effect of intra-population variation. Almost all modern bison populations differed in δ13C and δ15N from early Holocene bison. Such differences were not observed in moose. It indicates refugee status of European bison. Our results yielded evidence that habitat structure, management and a different history of population recovery have a strong influence on foraging behaviour of large herbivores reflected in stable isotope signatures. Influence of forest structure on carbon isotope signatures of studied herbivores supports the “canopy effect” hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2782153839,"Behavioral and neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that people process preferentially self-related information such as an image of their own face. Furthermore, people rapidly incorporate stimuli into their self-representation even if these stimuli do not have an intrinsic relation to self. In the present study, we investigated the time course of the processes involved in preferential processing of self-related information. In two EEG experiments three unfamiliar faces were identified with verbal labels as either the participant, a friend, or a stranger. Afterwards, participants judged whether two stimuli presented in succession (ISI = 1500ms) matched. In experiment 1, faces were followed by verbal labels and in experiment 2, labels were followed by faces. Both experiments showed the same pattern of behavioral and electrophysiological results. If the first stimulus (face or label) was associated with self, reaction times were faster and the late frontal positivity following the first stimulus was more pronounced. The self-association of the second stimulus (label or face) did not affect response times. However, the central-parietal P3 following presentation of the second stimulus was more pronounced when the second stimulus was preceded by self-related first stimulus. These results indicate that even unfamiliar faces that are associated to self can activate a self-representation. Once the self-representation has been activated the processing of ensuing stimuli is facilitated, irrespective of whether they are associated with the self."
https://openalex.org/W2782407824,"Sleep has been proposed to indicate preserved residual brain functioning in patients suffering from disorders of consciousness (DOC) after awakening from coma. However, a reliable characterization of sleep patterns in this clinical population continues to be challenging given severely altered brain oscillations, frequent and extended artifacts in clinical recordings and the absence of established staging criteria. In the present study, we try to address these issues and investigate the usefulness of a multivariate machine learning technique based on permutation entropy, a complexity measure. Specifically, we used long-term polysomnography (PSG), along with video recordings in day and night periods in a sample of 23 DOC; 12 patients were diagnosed as Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome (UWS) and 11 were diagnosed as Minimally Conscious State (MCS). Eight hour PSG recordings of healthy sleepers (N = 26) were additionally used for training and setting parameters of supervised and unsupervised model, respectively. In DOC, the supervised classification (wake, N1, N2, N3 or REM) was validated using simultaneous videos which identified periods with prolonged eye opening or eye closure.The supervised classification revealed that out of the 23 subjects, 11 patients (5 MCS and 6 UWS) yielded highly accurate classification with an average F1-score of 0.87 representing high overlap between the classifier predicting sleep (i.e. one of the 4 sleep stages) and closed eyes. Furthermore, the unsupervised approach revealed a more complex pattern of sleep-wake stages during the night period in the MCS group, as evidenced by the presence of several distinct clusters. In contrast, in UWS patients no such clustering was found. Altogether, we present a novel data-driven method, based on machine learning that can be used to gain new and unambiguous insights into sleep organization and residual brain functioning of patients with DOC."
https://openalex.org/W2781893750,"Despite of numerous evidences that elevated serum lactate levels were associated with unfavorable outcomes, there have been no study demonstrated an optimal cutoff of serum lactate in unselected patients. This study was aimed to evaluate the prognostic property of lactate, and to identify a cutoff of serum lactate level for predicting 30-day in-hospital mortality among unselected patients presenting to the emergency department (ED).We performed a retrospective observational study from January 2010 to December 2016. 61,151 patients were used for propensity score analysis after exclusion. 14,015 patients who underwent lactate test at ED arrival were enrolled for final analysis.The average treatment effect (ATE) of carrying out a lactate test on 30-day in-hospital mortality was 0.53% (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.013, p = 0.19; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.997-1.013). Adjusted OR of serum lactate calculated from multivariable analysis was 1.09 (p < 0.001; 95% CI, 1.07-1.10). The area under a ROC curve (AUC) of serum lactate was 0.711 (p < 0.001; 95% CI, 0.703-0.718). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for the cutoff > 2.6 mmol/L were 56.7%, 74.3%, 20.8%, and 93.5%, respectively. Mortality of the high-lactate group (> 2.6 mmol/L) was significantly higher than that of the low lactate group (≤ 2.6 mmol/L) (20.8% vs. 6.5%, difference = 14.3%, p < 0.01; 95% CI, 13.0% - 15.7%).A serum lactate level > 2.6 mmol/L predicted 30-day in-hospital mortality in unselected patients who arrived to the ED and were admitted to the hospital. Additionally, serum lactate test in the ED could be an effective screening method for identifying low risk patients."
https://openalex.org/W2782523148,"Regulation of the cytoskeleton is essential for cell migration in health and disease. Lymphocyte cytosolic protein 1 (lcp1, also called L-plastin) is a hematopoietic-specific actin-bundling protein that is highly conserved in zebrafish, mice and humans. In addition, L-plastin expression is documented as both a genetic marker and a cellular mechanism contributing to the invasiveness of tumors and transformed cell lines. Despite L-plastin's role in both immunity and cancer, in zebrafish there are no direct studies of its function, and no mutant, knockout or reporter lines available. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, we generated null alleles of zebrafish lcp1 and examined the phenotypes of these fish throughout the life cycle. Our editing strategy used gRNA to target the second exon of lcp1, producing F0 mosaic fish that were outcrossed to wild types to confirm germline transmission. F1 heterozygotes were then sequenced to identify three unique null alleles, here called 'Charlie', 'Foxtrot' and 'Lima'. In silico, each allele truncates the endogenous protein to less than 5% normal size and removes both essential actin-binding domains (ABD1 and ABD2). Although none of the null lines express detectable LCP1 protein, homozygous mutant zebrafish (-/-) can develop and reproduce normally, a finding consistent with that of the L-plastin null mouse (LPL -/-). However, such mice do have a profound immune defect when challenged by lung bacteria. Interestingly, we observed reduced long-term survival of zebrafish lcp1 -/- homozygotes (~30% below the expected numbers) in all three of our knockout lines, with greatest mortality corresponding to the period (4-6 weeks post-fertilization) when the innate immune system is functional, but the adaptive immune system is not yet mature. This suggests that null zebrafish may have reduced capacity to combat opportunistic infections, which are more easily transmissible in the aquatic environment. Overall, our novel mutant lines establish a sound genetic model and an enhanced platform for further studies of L-plastin gene function in hematopoiesis and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2781809388,"Tests for attention bias potentially offer more rapid assessment of affective state in animals than existing cognitive methods. An attention bias test has previously been developed for sheep and validated as a measure of anxious states. The 3 minute test assessed behavioural responses of sheep in an enclosed arena after brief exposure to the threat of a dog. Experiment 1 of the current study aimed to refine the previously developed method, removing the need for a habituation period and shortening the test duration. Sheep were given either an anxiolytic drug, an anxiogenic drug or a control treatment prior to testing to induce contrasting affective states. Differences in behaviour were found between the treatment groups within the first 45s of the test, indicating the original test duration could be shortened from 180 s. During testing, 36 of 40 animals in the control and anxiolytic groups ate the novel feed offered in the test, indicating it is not necessary to habituate animals to a feed container. Experiment 2 aimed to confirm the responses measured in the test were primarily towards the dog rather than other aspects of the test environment. Sheep exposed to an empty window at the beginning of the test behaved differently to those which were exposed to a dog, indicating sheep behaviour in the test is at least partially a response to the dog. A third group of sheep were also tested with the dog immediately after having small data loggers attached to their necks. Behaviour of these sheep did not differ from the sheep tested without loggers, indicating data logger attachment did not impact their behaviour in the test. In both experiments, treatments did not appear to modify activity (zones crossed), which we propose indicates the test was primarily detecting valence of the affective state rather than arousal."

As a photosynthetic bacterium, Synechococcus has an efficient mechanism to adapt to the changes in salinity and light intensity. The analysis of the distributions and functions of such microorganisms in the ever changing river mouth environment, where freshwater and seawater mix, should help better understand their roles in the ecosystem. Toward this objective, we have collected and sequenced the ocean microbiome in the river mouth of Kwangyang Bay, Korea, as a function of salinity and temperature. In conjunction with comparative genomics approaches using the sequenced genomes of a wide phylogeny of Synechococcus, the ocean microbiome was analyzed in terms of their composition and clade-specific functions. The results showed significant differences in the compositions of Synechococcus sampled in different seasons. The photosynthetic functions in such enhanced Synechococcus strains were also observed in the microbiomes in summer, which is significantly different from those in other seasons."
https://openalex.org/W2782020454,"Introduction Total Laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH) requires an advanced level of operative skills and training. The aim of this study was to develop an objective scale specific for the assessment of technical skills for LH (H-OSATS) and to demonstrate feasibility of use and validity in a virtual reality setting. Material and methods The scale was developed using a hierarchical task analysis and a panel of international experts. A Delphi method obtained consensus among experts on relevant steps that should be included into the H-OSATS scale for assessment of operative performances. Feasibility of use and validity of the scale were evaluated by reviewing video recordings of LH performed on a virtual reality laparoscopic simulator. Three groups of operators of different levels of experience were assessed in a Marseille teaching hospital (10 novices, 8 intermediates and 8 experienced surgeons). Correlations with scores obtained using a recognised generic global rating tool (OSATS) were calculated. Results A total of 76 discrete steps were identified by the hierarchical task analysis. 14 experts completed the two rounds of the Delphi questionnaire. 64 steps reached consensus and were integrated in the scale. During the validation process, median time to rate each video recording was 25 minutes. There was a significant difference between the novice, intermediate and experienced group for total H-OSATS scores (133, 155.9 and 178.25 respectively; p = 0.002). H-OSATS scale demonstrated high inter-rater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.930; p<0.001) and test retest reliability (ICC = 0.877; p<0.001). High correlations were found between total H-OSATS scores and OSATS scores (rho = 0.928; p<0.001). Conclusion The H-OSATS scale displayed evidence of validity for assessment of technical performances for LH performed on a virtual reality simulator. The implementation of this scale is expected to facilitate deliberate practice. Next steps should focus on evaluating the validity of the scale in the operating room."
https://openalex.org/W2781719898,"Animals are subject to various scales of temporal environmental fluctuations, among which daily and seasonal variations are two of the most widespread and significant ones. Many biotic and abiotic factors change temporally, and climatic factors are particularly important because they directly affect the cost of thermoregulation. The purpose of the present study was to determine the activity patterns of wild Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) with a special emphasis on the effect of thermal conditions. We set 30 camera traps in the coniferous forest of Yakushima and monitored them for a total of 8658 camera-days between July 2014 and July 2015. Over the one-year period, temperature had a positive effect, and rainfall had a negative effect on the activity of macaques during the day. Capture rate was significantly higher during the time period of one hour after sunrise and during midday. During winter days, macaques concentrated their activity around noon, and activity shifted from the morning toward the afternoon. This could be interpreted as macaques shifting their activity to warmer time periods within a single day. Japanese macaques decreased their activity during the time before sunrise in seasons with lower temperatures. It was beneficial for macaques to be less active during cooler time periods in a cold season. Even small amounts of rainfall negatively affected the activity of Japanese macaques, with capture rates decreasing significantly even when rainfall was only 0.5-1 mm/min. In conclusion, thermal conditions significantly affected the activity of wild Japanese macaques at various time scales."
https://openalex.org/W2782500421,"Background The early identification of dengue infection is essential for timely and effective quarantine and vector control measures for preventing outbreaks of the disease. Kaohsiung City is responsible for most of the dengue cases in Taiwan. Thus, this study aims to identify major factors involved in the prevalence of dengue fever by analyzing the epidemiological and clinical characteristics, and to establish associations between weather parameters and dengue occurrence in this City. Methods A retrospective study was conducted with 3,322 confirmed dengue cases. Appropriate statistical methods were used to compare differences and correlations between dengue occurrence and demographic, clinical and weather parameters. Results The outbreak of dengue fever was found to be initiated by imported cases of dengue viruses from other endemic countries. Most of the confirmed cases were not reported to the health authority during the first visit to a doctor, and it took a median of 5 days after the appearance of the first syndromes for medical personnel to report suspected dengue cases. Accordingly, Aedes mosquitoes would have enough time to be infected and transmit the dengue virus. The diagnosis and notification criteria should not only include common symptoms of fever, myalgia, headache, skin rash and arthralgia, but should also be adjusted to include the most frequent symptoms of loss of appetite and feeling thirsty to shorten the notification time. Significantly positive correlations were found between the number of confirmed cases and weather parameters (i.e., temperature, rainfall and relative humidity) at a time lag of 1 month and 2 months. The predictive models for dengue occurrence using these three parameters at a 2-month lag time were established. Conclusions The surveillance of imported cases, adjustment of notification criteria and application of climatic predictive models would be helpful in strengthening the dengue early warning surveillance system."

Methods Patients received therapies based on pegylated interferon or direct-acting antiviral agents. The changes in paired patient parameters, including liver stiffness (LS) values, the FIB-4 index, and APRI, from baseline to sustained virologic response (SVR) visit (24 weeks after the end of treatment) were compared. Multiple regression models were used to identify significant factors that explained the correlations with LS, FIB-4, and APRI values and SVR. Results A total of 256 patients were included, of which 219 (85.5%) achieved SVR. The paired LS values declined significantly from baseline to SVR visit in all groups and subgroups except the nonresponder subgroup (n = 10). Body mass index (P = 0.0062) and baseline LS (P < 0.0001) were identified as independent factors that explained the LS declines. Likewise, the baseline FIB-4 (P < 0.0001) and APRI (P < 0.0001) values independently explained the declines in the FIB-4 index and APRI, respectively. Moreover, interleukin-28B polymorphisms, baseline LS, and rapid virologic response were identified as independent correlates with SVR. Conclusions Paired LS measurements in patients treated for CHC exhibited significant declines comparable to those in FIB-4 and APRI values. These declines may have correlated with the resolution of necroinflammation. Baseline LS values predicted SVR."
https://openalex.org/W2781639303,"Bacteria exhibit an optimal growth rate in culture media with sufficient nutrients at an optimal temperature and pH. In addition, the concentration of solutes plays a critical role in bacterial growth and survival. Glutamate is known to be a major anionic solute involved in osmoregulation and the bacterial cell’s response to changes in solute concentration. To determine how glutamate uptake is involved in osmoregulation in the rice bacterial pathogen Burkholderia glumae BGR1, we mutated the gltI gene encoding a periplasmic substrate binding protein of a glutamate transport system to abolish glutamate uptake, and monitored the growth of the gltI null mutant in Luria-Bertani medium. We found that the gltI null mutant showed a slower growth rate than the wild-type strain and experienced hyperosmotic stress resulting in water loss from the cytoplasm in stationary phase. When the incubation time was extended, the mutant population collapsed due to the hyperosmotic stress. The gltI null mutant exhibited loss of adaptability under both hypoosmotic and hyperosmotic stresses. The growth rate of the gltI null mutant was restored to the level of wild-type growth by exogenous addition of glycine betaine to the culture medium, indicating that glycine betaine is a compatible solute in B. glumae. These results indicate that glutamate uptake from the environment plays a key role in osmoregulation in B. glumae."
https://openalex.org/W2781927921,"The existence of a shared classification system is essential to knowledge production, transfer, and sharing. Studies of knowledge classification, however, rarely consider the fact that knowledge categories exist within hierarchical information systems designed to facilitate knowledge search and discovery. This neglect is problematic whenever information about categorical membership is itself used to evaluate the quality of the items that the category contains. The main objective of this paper is to show that the effects of category membership depend on the position that a category occupies in the hierarchical knowledge classification system of Wikipedia—an open knowledge production and sharing platform taking the form of a freely accessible on-line encyclopedia. Using data on all English-language Wikipedia articles, we examine how the position that a category occupies in the classification hierarchy affects the attention that articles in that category attract from Wikipedia editors, and their evaluation of quality of the Wikipedia articles. Specifically, we show that Wikipedia articles assigned to coarse-grained categories (i. e., categories that occupy higher positions in the hierarchical knowledge classification system) garner more attention from Wikipedia editors (i. e., attract a higher volume of text editing activity), but receive lower evaluations (i. e., they are considered to be of lower quality). The negative relation between attention and quality implied by this result is consistent with current theories of social categorization, but it also goes beyond available results by showing that the effects of categorization on evaluation depend on the position that a category occupies in a hierarchical knowledge classification system."
https://openalex.org/W2781993418,"We evaluated the effect of leaves of native and exotic tree species on the feeding activity and performance of the larvae of Triplectides gracilis, a typical caddisfly shredder in Atlantic Forest streams. Leaves of four native species that differ in chemistry and toughness (Hoffmannia dusenii, Miconia chartacea, Myrcia lineata and Styrax pohlii) and the exotic Eucalyptus globulus were used to determine food preferences and rates of consumption, production of fine particulate organic matter (FPOM), growth and survival of shredders. We hypothesized that the consumption rates of leaves of Eucalyptus and their effects on the growth and survival of shredders could be predicted by leaf chemistry and toughness. The larvae preferred to feed on soft leaves (H. dusenii and M. chartacea) independently of the content of nutrients (N and P) and secondary compounds (total phenolics). When such leaves were absent, they preferred E. globulus and did not consume the tough leaves (M. lineata and S. pohlii). In monodietary experiments, leaf consumption and FPOM production differed among the studied leaves, and the values observed for the E. globulus treatments were intermediate between the soft and tough leaves. The larvae that fed on H. dusenii and M. chartacea grew constantly over five weeks, while those that fed on E. globulus lost biomass. Larval survival was higher on leaves of H. dusenii, M. chartacea and S. pohlii than on E. globulus and M. lineata leaves. Although E. globulus was preferred over tougher leaves, long-term consumption of leaves of the exotic species may affect the abundance of T. gracilis in the studied stream. Additionally, our results suggest that leaf toughness can be a determining factor for the behavior of shredders where low-quality leaves are abundant, as in several tropical streams."

Misregulation of MID1 expression is associated with various diseases including midline malformation syndromes, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. While this indicates that MID1 expression must be tightly regulated to prevent disease states specific mechanisms involved have not been identified. We examined miRNAs to determine mechanisms that regulate MID1 expression. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small non-coding RNAs that recognize specific sequences in their target mRNAs. Upon binding, miRNAs typically downregulate expression of these targets. Here, we identified four miRNAs, miR-19, miR-340, miR-374 and miR-542 that bind to the 3’-UTR of the MID1 mRNA. These miRNAs not only regulate MID1 expression but also mTOR signaling and translation of disease associated mRNAs and could therefore serve as potential drugs for future therapy development."

Most methods used in conservation either provide suboptimal solutions or use strong assumptions about the decision-maker’s preferences. Our paper reviews some of the existing approaches to solve multi-objective decision problems and presents new multi-objective linear programming formulations of two multi-objective optimization problems in conservation, allowing the use of a reference point approach. Reference point approaches solve multi-objective optimization problems by interactively representing the preferences of the decision-maker with a point in the criteria (objectives) space, called the reference point. We modelled and solved the following two problems in conservation: a dynamic multi-species management problem under uncertainty and a spatial allocation resource management problem. Results show that the reference point method outperforms classic methods while illustrating the use of an interactive methodology for solving combinatorial problems with multiple objectives. The method is general and can be adapted to a wide range of ecological combinatorial problems."
https://openalex.org/W2781805908,"The WHO HIV Treatment Guidelines suggest routine viral-load monitoring can be used to differentiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) delivery and reduce the frequency of clinic visits for patients stable on ART. This recommendation was informed by economic analysis that showed the approach is very likely to be cost-effective, even in the most resource constrained of settings. The health benefits were shown to be modest but the costs of introducing and scaling up viral load monitoring can be offset by anticipated reductions in the costs of clinic visits, due to these being less frequent for many patients.The cost-effectiveness of introducing viral-load informed differentiated care depends upon whether cost reductions are possible if the number of clinic visits is reduced and/or how freed clinic capacity is used for alternative priorities. Where freed resources, either physical or financial, generate large health gains (e.g. if committed to patients failing ART or to other high value health care interventions), the benefits of differentiated care are expected to be high; if however these freed physical resources are already under-utilized or financial resources are used less efficiently and would not be put to as beneficial an alternative use, the policy may not be cost-effective. The implication is that the use of conventional unit costs to value resources may not well reflect the latter's value in contributing to health improvement. Analyses intended to inform resource allocated decisions in a number of settings may therefore have to be interpreted with due consideration to local context. In this paper we present methods of how economic analyses can reflect the real value of health care resources rather than simply applying their unit costs. The analyses informing the WHO Guidelines are re-estimated by implementing scenarios using this framework, informing how differentiated care can be prioritized to generate greatest gains in population health.The findings have important implications for how economic analyses should be undertaken and reported in HIV and other disease areas. Results provide guidance on conditions under which viral load informed differentiated care will more likely prove to be cost effective when implemented."
https://openalex.org/W2781835569,"Reduced antimicrobial susceptibility due to resistance and tolerance has become a serious threat to human health. An approach to overcome this reduced susceptibility is the use of antibiotic adjuvants, also known as potentiators. These are compounds that have little or no antibacterial effect on their own but increase the susceptibility of bacterial cells towards antimicrobial agents. Baicalin hydrate, previously described as a quorum sensing inhibitor, is such a potentiator that increases the susceptibility of Burkholderia cenocepacia J2315 biofilms towards tobramycin. The goal of the present study is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind the potentiating activity of baicalin hydrate and related flavonoids. We first determined the effect of multiple flavonoids on susceptibility of B. cenocepacia J2315 towards tobramycin. Increased antibiotic susceptibility was most pronounced in combination with apigenin 7-O-glucoside and baicalin hydrate. For baicalin hydrate, also other B. cepacia complex strains and other antibiotics were tested. The potentiating effect was only observed for aminoglycosides and was both strain- and aminoglycoside-dependent. Subsequently, gene expression was compared between baicalin hydrate treated and untreated cells, in the presence and absence of tobramycin. This revealed that baicalin hydrate affected cellular respiration, resulting in increased reactive oxygen species production in the presence of tobramycin. We subsequently showed that baicalin hydrate has an impact on oxidative stress via several pathways including oxidative phosphorylation, glucarate metabolism and by modulating biosynthesis of putrescine. Furthermore, our data strongly suggest that the influence of baicalin hydrate on oxidative stress is unrelated to quorum sensing. Our data indicate that the potentiating effect of baicalin hydrate is due to modulating the oxidative stress response, which in turn leads to increased tobramycin-mediated killing."
https://openalex.org/W2782212584,"Correct segregation of the mitotic chromosomes into daughter cells is a highly regulated process critical to safeguard genome stability. During M phase the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) ensures that all kinetochores are correctly attached before its inactivation allows progression into anaphase. Upon SAC inactivation, the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) E3 ligase ubiquitinates and targets cyclin B and securin for proteasomal degradation. Here, we describe the identification of Ribonucleic Acid Export protein 1 (RAE1), a protein previously shown to be involved in SAC regulation and bipolar spindle formation, as a novel substrate of the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) Ubiquitin Specific Protease 11 (USP11). Lentiviral knock-down of USP11 or RAE1 in U2OS cells drastically reduces cell proliferation and increases multipolar spindle formation. We show that USP11 is associated with the mitotic spindle, does not regulate SAC inactivation, but controls ubiquitination of RAE1 at the mitotic spindle, hereby functionally modulating its interaction with Nuclear Mitotic Apparatus protein (NuMA)."

The analysis is based on the newly recalibrated SCORE Deutschland risk charts and considered other comorbidities for the classification of the high CVD risk group according to the guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology. Methods and results In 3,498 participants (40–69 years) from the German Health Examination Survey for Adults 2008–2011 (DEGS1) without a history of CVD (myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke) we estimated the proportion with a low (SCORE <1%), moderate (SCORE 1-<5%) and high 10-year CVD mortality risk (SCORE ≥5% or diabetes, renal insufficiency, SBP/DPB ≥180/110 mmHg or cholesterol >8 mmol/l). The prevalence of low, moderate and high risk was 42.8%, 38.5% and 18.8% in men and 73.7%, 18.1% and 8.2% in women. The prevalence of high risk was significantly lower in women with a high compared to a low SES (3.3% vs. 11.2%) and in communities with ≥100.000 inhabitants compared to <20.000 inhabitants (5.4% vs.10.9%). There were no significant associations between predicted CVD mortality risk and SES or community size in men and regions in men and women. Among the high risk group, 58.2% of men and 9.8% of women had SCORE ≥5%, leaving the majority of women (60.1%) classified as high risks due to diabetes and SCORE <5%. Conclusion Our results suggest the persistence of socioeconomic disparities in predicted cardiovascular mortality in women and support the need of large-scale prevention efforts beyond individual lifestyle modification or treatment. Furthermore, the importance of additional comorbidities for the high risk group classification is highlighted."

Both numbers and architecture of activating follicular helper T-cells (Tfh) and suppressive Treg in the TME of FL are associated with clinical outcomes. There has been almost no previous work on CD4+ T-cells in MZL. It is now recognised that circulating CD4+CXCR5+ T-cells are the memory compartment of Tfh cells. We determined differences in number of circulating Tfh (cTfh) cells and cTfh subsets between normal subjects and patients with FL or MZL. Lymphoma patients showed increased numbers of cTfh1 and reduced cTfh17 cells due to decreased expression of the subset-defining marker CCR6 in patients. PD1, a surface marker associated with Tfh cells, showed increased expression on cTfh subsets in patients. Focusing on MZL we determined expression of 96 T-cell associated genes by microfluidic qRT-PCR. Analysis of differentially expressed genes showed significant differences between normal subjects and patients both for bulk cTfh (CCL4) and the cTfh1 subset (JAK3). While our findings require confirmation in larger studies we suggest that analysis of number and gene expression of circulating T-cells might be a source of clinically useful information as is the case for T-cells within lymphoma lymph nodes."

It is a sedentary, biotrophic parasites of plants and overwinter in the soil or in diseased roots. This study showed that the cold tolerance for the second-stage juveniles (J2) of M. hapla was moderate with the 50% survival temperature (S50) of -2.22°C and the fatal temperature was -6°C when cooling at 0.5°C min-1. Cryoprotective dehydration significantly enhance cold tolerance of M. hapla J2 with the lowest S50 of -3.28°C after held being at -1°C for 6 h. Moreover, cold shock and cold acclimation had significant effects on the freezing survival of M. hapla J2. The lethal temperature of eggs was -18°C. Therefore, the cold tolerance of M. hapla is sufficiently favorable to withstand winters in cold temperature environments."
https://openalex.org/W2782458915,"Using a theoretical approach grounded in implicit bias and stereotyping theories, this study examines the relationship between observable physical characteristics (skin tone, height, and gender) and earnings, as measured by income. Combining separate streams of research on the influence of these three characteristics, we draw from a sample of 31,356 individual-year observations across 4,340 individuals from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth (NLSY) 1997. We find that skin tone, height, and gender interact such that taller males with darker skin tone attain lower earnings; those educated beyond high school, endowed with higher cognitive ability, and at the higher income level (>75th percentile) had even lower levels of earnings relative to individuals with lighter skin tone. The findings have implications for implicit bias theories, stereotyping, and the human capital literature within the fields of management, applied psychology, and economics."
https://openalex.org/W2781639398,"Biological aging is a complex process dependent on the interplay of cell autonomous and tissue contextual changes which occur in response to cumulative molecular stress and manifest through adaptive transcriptional reprogramming. Here we describe a transcription factor (TF) meta-analysis of gene expression datasets accrued from 18 tissue sites collected at different biological ages and from 7 different in-vitro aging models. In-vitro aging platforms included replicative senescence and an energy restriction model in quiescence (ERiQ), in which ATP was transiently reduced. TF motifs in promoter regions of trimmed sets of target genes were scanned using JASPAR and TRANSFAC. TF signatures established a global mapping of agglomerating motifs with distinct clusters when ranked hierarchically. Remarkably, the ERiQ profile was shared with the majority of in-vivo aged tissues. Fitting motifs in a minimalistic protein-protein network allowed to probe for connectivity to distinct stress sensors. The DNA damage sensors ATM and ATR linked to the subnetwork associated with senescence. By contrast, the energy sensors PTEN and AMPK connected to the nodes in the ERiQ subnetwork. These data suggest that metabolic dysfunction may be linked to transcriptional patterns characteristic of many aged tissues and distinct from cumulative DNA damage associated with senescence."
https://openalex.org/W2781501286,"The embryo-specific Dc3 gene promoter driving the VvMybA1 anthocyanin regulatory gene was used to develop a visual selection system for the genetic transformation of citrus. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of cell suspension cultures resulted in the production of purple transgenic somatic embryos that could be easily separated from the green non-transgenic embryos. The somatic embryos produced phenotypically normal plants devoid of any visual purple coloration. These results were also confirmed using protoplast transformation. There was minimal gene expression in unstressed one-year-old transgenic lines. Cold and drought stress did not have any effect on gene expression, while exogenous ABA and NaCl application resulted in a minor change in gene expression in several transgenic lines. When gas exchange was measured in intact leaves, the transgenic lines were similar to controls under the same environment. Our results provide conclusive evidence for the utilization of a plant-derived, embryo-specific visual reporter system for the genetic transformation of citrus. Such a system could aid in the development of an all-plant, consumer-friendly GM citrus tree."

However, there is no regulation or enforcement of CRS use in Saudi Arabia. This study estimated the prevalence of CRS use and identified patterns of child transportation in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.In this cross-sectional study, a self-administered questionnaire was distributed across Riyadh targeting families who drove with children aged less than 5 years. The questionnaire inquired about CRS availability, patterns of child transportation if a CRS was unavailable, seat belt use by the driver and adult passengers, and the perception of CRS.Of 385 respondents, only 36.6% reported the availability of a CRS (95% CI: 31.8-41.7%), with only half of those reported consistent use 74 (52.2%). Nearly 30% of all children aged less than 5 years were restrained during car journeys. Sitting on the lap of an adult passenger on the front seat was the most common pattern of child transportation (54.5%). Approximately 13.5% of respondents were involved in an MVC while driving with children; 63.5% of these children were unprotected by any safety system. Seat belt use by drivers was low, with only 15.3% reporting constant use.The prevalence of CRS use in Riyadh is low, and safety practices are seldom used by drivers and passengers. In addition to legal enforcement of CRS use, implementation of a child transportation policy with age-appropriate height and weight specifications is imperative."
https://openalex.org/W2782027226,"Nicotine evokes chorda tympani (CT) taste nerve responses and an aversive behavior in Trpm5 knockout (KO) mice. The agonists and antagonists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) modulate neural and behavioral responses to nicotine in wildtype (WT) mice, Trpm5 KO mice and rats. This indicates that nicotine evokes bitter taste by activating a Trpm5-dependent pathway and a Trpm5-independent but nAChR-dependent pathway. Rat CT responses to ethanol are also partially inhibited by nAChR blockers, mecamylamine and dihydro-β-erythroidine. This indicates that a component of the bitter taste of ethanol is also nAChR-dependent. However, at present the expression and localization of nAChR subunits has not been investigated in detail in taste receptor cells (TRCs). To this end, in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry and q-RT-PCR techniques were utilized to localize nAChR subunits in fungiform and circumvallate TRCs in WT mice, Trpm5-GFP transgenic mice, nAChR KO mice, and rats. The expression of mRNAs for α7, β2 and β4 nAChR subunits was observed in a subset of rat and WT mouse circumvallate and fungiform TRCs. Specific α3, α4, α7, β2, and β4 antibodies localized to a subset of WT mouse circumvallate and fungiform TRCs. In Trpm5-GFP mice α3, α4, α7, and β4 antibody binding was observed in a subset of Trpm5-positive circumvallate TRCs. Giving nicotine (100 μg/ml) in drinking water to WT mice for 3 weeks differentially increased the expression of α3, α4, α5, α6, α7, β2 and β4 mRNAs in circumvallate TRCs to varying degrees. Giving ethanol (5%) in drinking water to WT mice induced an increase in the expression of α5 and β4 mRNAs in circumvallate TRCs with a significant decrease in the expression of α3, α6 and β2 mRNAs. We conclude that nAChR subunits are expressed in Trpm5-positive TRCs and their expression levels are differentially altered by chronic oral exposure to nicotine and ethanol."
https://openalex.org/W2781612223,"This study aimed to determine the factors influencing patients’ choice of physician at the first visit through database analysis of a tertiary hospital in South Korea. We collected data on the first treatments performed by physicians who had treated patients for at least 3 consecutive years over 10 years (from 2003 to 2012) from the database of Seoul National University’s affiliated tertiary hospital. Ultimately, we obtained data on 524,012 first treatments of 319,004 patients performed by 115 physicians. Variables including physicians’ age and medical school and patients’ age were evaluated as influencing factors for the number of first treatments performed by each physician in each year using a Poisson regression through generalized estimating equations with a log link. The number of first treatments decreased over the study period. Notably, the relative risk for first treatments was lower among older physicians than among younger physicians (relative risk 0.96; 95% confidence interval 0.95 to 0.98). Physicians graduating from Seoul National University (SNU) also had a higher risk for performing first treatments than did those not from SNU (relative risk 1.58; 95% confidence interval 1.18 to 2.10). Finally, relative risk was also higher among older patients than among younger patients (relative risk 1.03; 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 1.04). This study systematically demonstrated that physicians’ age, whether the physician graduated from the highest-quality university, and patients’ age all related to patients’ choice of physician at the first visit in a tertiary university hospital. These findings might be due to Korean cultural factors."
https://openalex.org/W2781945555,"The karyotype is a basic concept regarding the genome, fundamentally described by the number and morphological features of all chromosomes. Chromosome class, centromeric index, intra- and interchromosomal asymmetry index, and constriction localization are important in clinical, systematic and evolutionary approaches. In spite of the advances in karyotype characterization made over the last years, new data about the chromosomes can be generated from quantitative methods, such as image cytometry. Therefore, using Zea mays L., this study aimed to update the species’ karyotype by supplementing information on chromosome DNA sizing. After adjustment of the procedures, chromosome morphometry and class as well as knob localization enabled describing the Z. mays karyotype. In addition, applying image cytometry, DNA sizing was unprecedentedly measured for the arms and satellite of all chromosomes. This way, unambiguous identification of the chromosome pairs, and hence the assembly of 51 karyograms, were only possible after the DNA sizing of each chromosome, their arms and satellite portions. These accurate, quantitative and reproducible data also enabled determining the distribution and variation of DNA content in each chromosome. From this, a correlation between DNA amount and total chromosome length evidenced that the mean DNA content of chromosome 9 was higher than that of chromosome 8. The chromosomal DNA sizing updated the Z. mays karyotype, providing insights into its dynamic genome with regards to the organization of the ten chromosomes and their respective portions. Considering the results and the relevance of cytogenetics in the current scenario of comparative sequencing and genomics, chromosomal DNA sizing should be incorporated as an additional parameter for karyotype definition. Based on this study, it can be affirmed that cytogenetic approaches go beyond the simple morphological description of chromosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2781969191,"Detrimental changes in the composition and function of rotator cuff (RC) muscles are hallmarks of RC disease progression. Previous studies have demonstrated both atrophic and degenerative muscle loss in advanced RC disease. However, the relationship between gene expression and RC muscle pathology remains poorly defined, in large part due to a lack of studies correlating gene expression to tissue composition. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine how tissue composition relates to gene expression in muscle biopsies from patients undergoing reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA). Gene expression related to myogenesis, atrophy and cell death, adipogenesis and metabolism, inflammation, and fibrosis was measured in 40 RC muscle biopsies, including 31 biopsies from reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) cases that had available histology data and 9 control biopsies from patients with intact RC tendons. After normalization to reference genes, linear regression was used to identify relationships between gene expression and tissue composition. Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) identified unique clusters, and fold-change analysis was used to determine significant differences in expression between clusters. We found that gene expression profiles were largely dependent on muscle presence, with muscle fraction being the only histological parameter that was significantly correlated to gene expression by linear regression. Similarly, samples with histologically-confirmed muscle distinctly segregated from samples without muscle. However, two sub-groups within the muscle-containing RSA biopsies suggest distinct phases of disease, with one group expressing markers of both atrophy and regeneration, and another group not significantly different from either control biopsies or biopsies lacking muscle. In conclusion, this study provides context for the interpretation of gene expression in heterogeneous and degenerating muscle, and provides further evidence for distinct stages of RC disease in humans."

Not only for biological research but also for diagnostic needs, qPCR technique requires capacity to detect multiple genes in recent years. Solid phase PCR (SP-PCR) where one or two directional primers are immobilized on solid substrates could analyze multiplex genetic targets. However, conventional SP-PCR was subjected to restriction of application for lack of PCR efficiency and quantitative resolution. Here we introduce an advanced qPCR with primer-incorporated network (PIN). One directional primers are immobilized in the porous hydrogel particle by covalent bond and the other direction of primers are temporarily immobilized at so-called 'Supplimers'. Supplimers released the primers to aqueous phase in the hydrogel at the thermal cycling of PCR. It induced the high PCR efficiency over 92% with high reliability. It reduced the formation of primer dimers and improved the selectivity of qPCR thanks to the strategy of 'right primers supplied to right place only'.

Despite mandatory traceability requirements for the analysis of feed composition, few reliable and accurate methods are presently available to enforce the legislative frame and allow the authentication of animal feeds. In this study, nine sensitive and species-specific real-time PCR TaqMan MGB assays are described for plant species detection in animal feed samples. The method is based on selective real-time qPCR (RT-qPCR) amplification of target genes belonging to the alternative oxidase (AOX) gene family. The plant species selected for detection in feed samples were wheat, maize, barley, soybean, rice and sunflower as common components of feeds, and cotton, flax and peanut as possible undesirable contaminants. The obtained results were compared with end-point PCR methodology. The applicability of the AOX TaqMan assays was evaluated through the screening of commercial feed samples, and by the analysis of plant mixtures with known composition. The RT-qPCR methodology allowed the detection of the most abundant species in feeds but also the identification of contaminant species present in lower amounts, down to 1% w/w. AOX-based methodology provides a suitable molecular marker approach to ascertain plant species composition of animal feed samples, thus supporting feed control and enforcement of the feed sector and animal production."
https://openalex.org/W2781920217,"Background Youth are engaging in multiple risky behaviours, increasing their risk of overweight, obesity, and related chronic diseases. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of engaging in unique clusters of unhealthy behaviours on youths’ body mass index (BMI) trajectories. Methods This study used a linked-longitudinal sample of Grades 9 and 10 students (13 to 17 years of age) participating in the COMPASS host study. Students reported obesity-related and other risky behaviours at baseline and height and weight (to derive BMI) at baseline (2012/2013) and annually for 2 years post-baseline (2013/14 and 2014/15). Students were grouped into behavioural clusters based on response probabilities. Linear mixed effects models, using BMI as a continuous outcome measure, were used to examine the effect of engaging in clusters of risky behaviours on BMI trajectories. Results There were significant differences in BMI of the four behavioural clusters at baseline that remained consistent over time. Higher BMI values were found among youth classified at baseline to be Typical High School Athletes (β = 0.232 kg/m2, [confidence interval (CI): 0.03–0.50]), Inactive High Screen-User (β = 0.348 kg/m2, CI: 0.11–0.59) and Moderately Active Substance Users (β = 0.759 kg/m2, CI: 0.36–1.15) compared to students classified as Health Conscious. Despite these baseline differences, BMI appeared to increase across all behavioural clusters annually by the same amount (β = 0.6097 kg/m2, (CI) = 0.57–0.64). Conclusions Although annual increases in BMI did not differ by behavioural clusters, membership in a particular behavioural cluster was associated with baseline BMI, and these differences remained consistent over time. Results indicate that intervening and modifying unhealthy behaviours earlier might have a greater impact than during adolescence. Health promotion strategies targeting the highest risk youth as they enter secondary school might be promising means to prevent or delay the onset of obesity."

This study investigated how PEStim contributed to modulation of swallowing function in 15 healthy humans. In the involuntary swallowing test, water was injected onto the pharynx at 0.05 ml/s and the onset latency of the first swallow was measured. In the voluntary swallowing test, subjects swallowed their own saliva as quickly as possible for 30 s and the number of swallows was counted. Voluntary and involuntary swallowing was evaluated before (baseline), immediately after, and every 10 min after 10-min PEStim for 60 min. A voluntary swallowing test with simultaneous 30-s PEStim was also conducted before and 60 min after 10-min PEStim. The number of voluntary swallows with simultaneous PEStim significantly increased over 60 min after 10-min PEStim compared with the baseline. The onset latency of the first swallow in the involuntary swallowing test was not affected by 10-min PEStim. The results suggest that PEStim may have a long-term facilitatory effect on the initiation of voluntary swallowing in healthy humans, but not on peripherally-evoked swallowing. The physiological implications of this modulation are discussed."

Although several mouse models have already been generated to investigate the link between the three identified disease-causing mutations in the ELOVL4 gene, none of these models recapitulates the early-onset cone photoreceptor cell death observed in the macula of STGD3 patients. To address this specifically, we investigated the effect of mutant ELOVL4 in a mouse model with an all-cone retina. Hence, we bred mice carrying the heterozygously mutated Elovl4 gene on the R91W;Nrl-/- all-cone background and analyzed the retinal lipid composition, morphology, and function over the course of 1 year. We observed a reduction of total phosphatidylcholine-containing very long chain-polyunsaturated fatty acids (PC-VLC-PUFAs) by 39% in the R91W;Nrl-/-;Elovl4 mice already at 6 weeks of age with a pronounced decline of the longest forms of PC-VLC-PUFAs. Total levels of shorter-chain fatty acids (< C26) remained unaffected. However, this reduction in PC-VLC-PUFA content in the all-cone retina had no impact on morphology or function and did not accelerate retinal degeneration in the R91W;Nrl-/-;Elovl4 mice. Taken together, mutations in the ELOVL4 gene lead to cone degeneration in humans, whereas mouse models expressing the mutant Elovl4 show predominant rod degeneration. The lack of a phenotype in the all-cone retina expressing the mutant form of the protein supports the view that aberrant function of ELOVL4 is especially detrimental for rods in mice and suggests a more subtle role of VLC-PUFAs for cone maintenance and survival."
https://openalex.org/W2782462794,"LIDAR-based analyses of the first theropod dinosaur trackways known from the state of Arkansas, USA are reported. The trackways were found on a limestone bedding plane in the Albian De Queen Formation in an active gypsum quarry. Because limited access precluded thorough field study, fieldwork focused on preserving the entire site digitally with ground-based LIDAR, and detailed measurements were later taken digitally from point cloud data. The site contains eight tridactyl trackways associated with sauropod trackways and numerous isolated tracks. Although there appear to be two different tridactyl morphotypes, we show that the tracks are all likely from a single species of trackmaker. We apply a simple method of estimating substrate consistency by comparing the differences between true track dimensions and apparent track dimensions. The tridactyl tracks at the southern end of the site are preserved with significantly greater differences in true vs. apparent dimensions and are shallower than the rest of the tridactyl tracks at the site, which we interpret as the result of outward expansion of the soft tissues of the foot upon contact with a firm substrate. We interpret the firm substrate as having high bulk density and high shear strength, which also explain associated manus-only sauropod tracks. We show that the tridactyl tracks are likely from theropod trackmakers and that footprint lengths, trackway paces, stride lengths, and pace angulations of the De Queen trackways are statistically indistinguishable from equivalent measurements of theropod trackways in the Glen Rose Formation. The Glen Rose tracks are attributed to the large-bodied theropod, Acrocanthosaurus and we likewise attribute the De Queen tracks to Acrocanthosaurus, which is known from skeletal remains in temporally equivalent units and from the mine itself."

Several fungal metabolites have anti-insecticidal properties which may yield advantages to the fungus in competition with insects for exploitation of environmental resources. Using the Drosophila melanogaster/Aspergillus nidulans ecological model system to assess secondary metabolite mutant genotypes, we find a major role for the veA allele in insect/fungal confrontations that exceeds the influence of other factors such as LaeA. VeA along with LaeA is a member of a transcriptional complex governing secondary metabolism in A. nidulans. However, historically a mutant veA allele, veA1 reduced in secondary metabolite output, has been used in many studies of this model organism. To test the significance of this allele in our system, Aspergillus nidulans veA wild type, veA1, ΔveA and ΔlaeA were evaluated in confrontation assays to analyze egg laying activity, and the survival rate of larvae. The veA1 genetic background led to a significant increase of larval survival. Adult flies were observed almost exclusively on veA1, ΔveA or ΔlaeA genetic backgrounds, suggesting a role for the velvet complex in insect/fungal interactions. This effect was most profound using the veA1 mutant. Hence, larval survival in confrontations is highly affected by the fungal genotype."

This protein is encoded in an operon, OM001 with two other genes, with previous work implicating this operon as important for pneumococcal virulence. Thus, we set out to investigate the role of the individual genes in the operon during pneumococcal pathogenesis. As LMWPTPs play a major role in capsular polysaccharide (CPS) biosynthesis in many bacteria, we tested the effect of mutating spd1837 and its adjacent genes, spd1836 and spd1838 on CPS levels. Our results suggest that individual deletion of the genes, including the LMWPTP, did not modulate CPS levels, in multiple conditions, and in different strain backgrounds. Following in vivo studies, Spd1836 was identified as a novel virulence factor during pneumococcal invasive disease, in both the lungs and blood, with this protein alone responsible for the effects of operon's role in virulence. We also showed that a deletion in spd1836, spd1838 or the overall OM001 operon reduced survival in human saliva during the conditions that mimic transmission compared to the wildtype strain. With studies suggesting that survival in human saliva may be important for transmission, this study identifies Spd1836 and Spd1838 as transmission factors, potentially facilitating the spread of the pneumococcus from person to person. Overall, this study hopes to further our understanding of the bacterial transmission that precedes disease and outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W2782211049,"Cross-modal spatial cueing can affect performance in a visual search task. For example, search performance improves if a visual target and an auditory cue originate from the same spatial location, and it deteriorates if they originate from different locations. Moreover, it has recently been postulated that multisensory settings, i.e., experimental settings, in which critical stimuli are concurrently presented in different sensory modalities (e.g., visual and auditory), may trigger asymmetries in visuospatial attention. Thereby, a facilitation has been observed for visual stimuli presented in the right compared to the left visual space. However, it remains unclear whether auditory cueing of attention differentially affects search performance in the left and the right hemifields in audio-visual search tasks. The present study investigated whether spatial asymmetries would occur in a search task with cross-modal spatial cueing. Participants completed a visual search task that contained no auditory cues (i.e., unimodal visual condition), spatially congruent, spatially incongruent, and spatially non-informative auditory cues. To further assess participants' accuracy in localising the auditory cues, a unimodal auditory spatial localisation task was also administered. The results demonstrated no left/right asymmetries in the unimodal visual search condition. Both an additional incongruent, as well as a spatially non-informative, auditory cue resulted in lateral asymmetries. Thereby, search times were increased for targets presented in the left compared to the right hemifield. No such spatial asymmetry was observed in the congruent condition. However, participants' performance in the congruent condition was modulated by their tone localisation accuracy. The findings of the present study demonstrate that spatial asymmetries in multisensory processing depend on the validity of the cross-modal cues, and occur under specific attentional conditions, i.e., when visual attention has to be reoriented towards the left hemifield."
https://openalex.org/W2781571054,"Fertilizer with different ratios of nitrogen (N) to phosphorus (P) can influence crop plant performance and defense against herbivores. Spodoptera exigua is an important agricultural pest that has caused serious economic loss, especially in recent decades. In the present study, we explored effects of different intensities and durations of S. exigua herbivory on host plant biomass and on S. exigua enzyme activities in response to five fertilizer treatments with different N: P ratios of 1: 5, 1: 3, 1: 1, 3: 1 and 5: 1. The results showed that fertilizer type can significantly influence interactions between caterpillars and its hosts. Compensatory growth of leaf biomass was detected under fertilizer with N: P = 3: 1. Fertilizer with a higher proportion of N appears to maintain stem biomass in defoliated seedlings similar to controls that are not exposed to herbivory. There was no significant difference in root biomass under most conditions. High proportion of N also enhanced the activity of two antioxidant enzymes, catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in low density of beet armyworm. However, with increased herbivorous intensity, a higher proportion of P played a more important role in increasing the activities of CAT and SOD. Higher P likely enhanced acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activity at lower degrees of defoliation, but a higher N proportion resulted in higher AChE activity at higher degrees of defoliation. Higher N proportion contributed to reduced carboxylesterase (CarE) activity at high intensity, short-term defoliation. However, when defoliation intensity increased, the difference in CarE activity between fertilizer categories was little. The study explored the interaction between the damage of S. exigua and the biomass accumulation of its host plant Brassica rapa, and the influence of the N/P ratio in plant fertilizer on this interaction. Systematic analysis was provided on the biomass of B. rapa and the activity of metabolic enzymes of S. exigua under different treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2781892635,"IL-10-differentiated dendritic cells (DC10) can reverse the asthma phenotype in mice, but how they suppress the asthmatic B cell response is unclear. Herein we assessed the mechanism(s) by which DC10 and DC10-induced Treg affect IgG1 production in asthma. We observed a rapid decline in lung-resident OVA-specific IgG1-secreting B cells on cessation of airway allergen challenge, and intraperitoneal DC10 therapy did not amplify that (p>0.05). It did however increase the loss of IgG1-B cells from the bone marrow (by 45+/-7.2%; p≤0.01) and spleen (by 65+/-17.8%; p≤0.05) over 2 wk. Delivery of OVA-loaded DC10 directly into the airways of asthmatic mice decreased the lung IgG1 B cell response assessed 2 dy later by 33+/-9.7% (p≤0.01), while their co-culture with asthmatic lung cell suspensions reduced the numbers of IgG1-secreting cells by 56.5+/-9.7% (p≤0.01). This effect was dependent on the DC10 carrying intact allergen on their cell surface; DC10 that had phagocytosed and fully processed their allergen were unable to suppress B cell responses, although they did suppress asthmatic Th2 cell responses. We had shown that therapeutic delivery of DC10-induced Treg can effectively suppress asthmatic T and B cell (IgE and IgG1) responses; herein CD4+ cells or Treg from the lungs of DC10-treated OVA-asthmatic mice suppressed in vitro B cell IgG1 production by 52.2+/-8.7% (p≤0.001) or 44.6+/-12.2% (p≤0.05), respectively, but delivery of DC10-induced Treg directly into the airways of asthmatic mice had no discernible impact over 2 dy on the numbers of lung IgG1-secreting cells (p≥0.05). In summary, DC10 treatment down-regulates OVA-specific B cell responses of asthmatic mice. While DC10 that carry intact allergen on their cell surface can dampen this response, DC10-induced Treg are critical for full realization of this outcome. This suggests that infectious tolerance is an essential element in regulatory DC control of the B cell response in allergic asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2781901898,"Dyes like Brilliant Blue have similar adsorptive behaviour as some organic contaminants, e.g., pesticides. Bromide ions, on the other hand, move much like NO3-N (fertilizer) in soil. Consequently, by using these two tracers, it is possible to in a general way mimic how organic contaminants and fertilizers may move through soils. Three plots with sandy soil in semiarid Tunisia were irrigated during three successive hours using a single irrigation dripper and high-saline solution (10.50 dS m-1) containing dye and bromide. Fifteen hours after cease of infiltration, horizontal 5 cm trenches were dug in the soil and dye pattern, bromide concentration, and soil water content were recorded. Preferential flow occurred to some degree, however, it did not dominate the solute transport process. Therefore, drip irrigation can be recommended to improve plant culture for a better water and soil nutrient adsorption. Numerical simulation using HYDRUS-2D/3D was performed to replicate the field experiments. Observed soil water contents before and after infiltration were used to run an inverse parameter estimation procedure to identify soil hydraulic parameters. It was found that for both field experiments and numerical simulations the mobility of bromide is different from the mobility of dye. The dye was retarded approximately twice by volume as compared to bromide. The simulation results support the use of HYDRUS-2D/3D as a rapid and labor saving tool for investigating tracers' mobility in sandy soil under point source irrigation."
