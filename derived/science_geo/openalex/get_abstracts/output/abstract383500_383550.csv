https://openalex.org/W2080732258,"Staphylococcus aureus is a prominent human pathogen and leading cause of bacterial infection in hospitals and the community. Community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) strains such as USA300 are highly virulent and, unlike hospital strains, often cause disease in otherwise healthy individuals. The enhanced virulence of CA-MRSA is based in part on increased ability to produce high levels of secreted molecules that facilitate evasion of the innate immune response. Although progress has been made, the factors that contribute to CA-MRSA virulence are incompletely defined. We analyzed the cell surface proteome (surfome) of USA300 strain LAC to better understand extracellular factors that contribute to the enhanced virulence phenotype. A total of 113 identified proteins were associated with the surface of USA300 during the late-exponential phase of growth in vitro. Protein A was the most abundant surface molecule of USA300, as indicated by combined Mascot score following analysis of peptides by tandem mass spectrometry. Unexpectedly, we identified a previously uncharacterized two-component leukotoxin-herein named LukS-H and LukF-G (LukGH)-as two of the most abundant surface-associated proteins of USA300. Rabbit antibody specific for LukG indicated it was also freely secreted by USA300 into culture media. We used wild-type and isogenic lukGH deletion strains of USA300 in combination with human PMN pore formation and lysis assays to identify this molecule as a leukotoxin. Moreover, LukGH synergized with PVL to enhance lysis of human PMNs in vitro, and contributed to lysis of PMNs after phagocytosis. We conclude LukGH is a novel two-component leukotoxin with cytolytic activity toward neutrophils, and thus potentially contributes to S. aureus virulence."
https://openalex.org/W2074330772,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the predominant cause of blindness in the industrialized world where destruction of the macula, i.e. the central region of the retina, results in loss of vision. AMD is preceded by the formation of deposits in the macula, which accumulate between the Bruch's membrane and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). These deposits are associated with complement-mediated inflammation and perturb retinal function. Recent genetic association studies have demonstrated that a common allele (402H) of the complement factor H (CFH) gene is a major risk factor for the development of AMD; CFH suppresses complement activation on host tissues where it is believed to bind via its interaction with polyanionic structures. We have shown previously that this coding change (Y402H; from a tyrosine to histidine residue) alters the binding of the CFH protein to sulfated polysaccharides. Here we demonstrate that the AMD-associated polymorphism profoundly affects CFH binding to sites within human macula. Notably, the AMD-associated 402H variant binds less well to heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate glycosaminoglycans within Bruch's membrane when compared with the 402Y form; both allotypes exhibit a similar level of binding to the RPE. We propose that the impaired binding of the 402H variant to Bruch's membrane results in an overactivation of the complement pathway leading to local chronic inflammation and thus contributes directly to the development and/or progression of AMD. These studies therefore provide a putative disease mechanism and add weight to the genetic association studies that implicate the 402H allele as an important risk factor in AMD."
https://openalex.org/W2002372399,"The aims of this study are to demonstrate the increased lysis of stem cells but not their differentiated counterparts by the NK cells and to determine whether disturbance in cell differentiation is a cause for increased sensitivity to NK cell mediated cytotoxicity. Increased cytotoxicity and augmented secretion of IFN-gamma were both observed when PBMCs or NK cells were co-incubated with primary UCLA oral squamous carcinoma stem cells (UCLA-OSCSCs) when compared to differentiated UCLA oral squamous carcinoma cells (UCLA-OSCCs). In addition, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) were also lysed greatly by the NK cells. Moreover, NK cells were found to lyse human Mesenchymal Stem Cells (hMSCs), human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) significantly more than their differentiated counterparts or parental lines from which they were derived. It was also found that inhibition of differentiation or reversion of cells to a less-differentiated phenotype by blocking NFkappaB or targeted knock down of COX2 in monocytes significantly augmented NK cell cytotoxicity and secretion of IFN-gamma. Taken together, these results suggest that stem cells are significant targets of the NK cell cytotoxicity. However, to support differentiation of a subset of tumor or healthy untransformed primary stem cells, NK cells may be required to lyse a number of stem cells and/or those which are either defective or incapable of full differentiation in order to lose their cytotoxic function and gain the ability to secrete cytokines (split anergy). Therefore, patients with cancer may benefit from repeated allogeneic NK cell transplantation for specific elimination of cancer stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2147518865,"Background Increasingly, underwater visual censuses (UVC) are used to assess fish populations. Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of protected areas for increasing fish abundance or provided insight into the natural abundance and structure of reef fish communities in remote areas. Recently, high apex predator densities (>100,000 individuals·km−2) and biomasses (>4 tonnes·ha−1) have been reported for some remote islands suggesting the occurrence of inverted trophic biomass pyramids. However, few studies have critically evaluated the methods used for sampling conspicuous and highly mobile fish such as sharks. Ideally, UVC are done instantaneously, however, researchers often count animals that enter the survey area after the survey has started, thus performing non-instantaneous UVC. Methodology/Principal Findings We developed a simulation model to evaluate counts obtained by divers deploying non-instantaneous belt-transect and stationary-point-count techniques. We assessed how fish speed and survey procedure (visibility, diver speed, survey time and dimensions) affect observed fish counts. Results indicate that the bias caused by fish speed alone is huge, while survey procedures had varying effects. Because the fastest fishes tend to be the largest, the bias would have significant implications on their biomass contribution. Therefore, caution is needed when describing abundance, biomass, and community structure based on non-instantaneous UVC, especially for highly mobile species such as sharks. Conclusions/Significance Based on our results, we urge that published literature state explicitly whether instantaneous counts were made and that survey procedures be accounted for when non-instantaneous counts are used. Using published density and biomass values of communities that include sharks we explore the effect of this bias and suggest that further investigation may be needed to determine pristine shark abundances and the existence of inverted biomass pyramids. Because such studies are used to make important management and conservation decisions, incorrect estimates of animal abundance and biomass have serious and significant implications."
https://openalex.org/W2021092016,"Autophagy is a homeostatic mechanism of lysosomal degradation. Defective autophagy has been linked to various disorders such as impaired control of pathogens and neurodegeneration. Autophagy is regulated by a complex array of signaling pathways that act upstream of autophagy proteins. Little is known about the role of altered regulatory signaling in disorders associated with defective autophagy. In particular, it is not known if pathogens inhibit autophagy by modulation of upstream regulatory pathways. Cells infected with HIV-1 blocked rapamycin-induced autophagy and CD40-induced autophagic killing of Toxoplasma gondii in bystander (non-HIV-1 infected) macrophage/monocytic cells. Blockade of autophagy was dependent on Src-Akt and STAT3 triggered by HIV-1 Tat and IL-10. Neutralization of the upstream receptors VEGFR, β-integrin or CXCR4, as well as of HIV-1 Tat or IL-10 restored autophagy in macrophage/monocytic cells exposed to HIV-1-infected cells. Defective autophagic killing of T. gondii was detected in monocyte-derived macrophages from a subset of HIV-1+ patients. This defect was also reverted by neutralization of Tat or IL-10. These studies revealed that a pathogen can impair autophagy in non-infected cells by activating counter-regulatory pathways. The fact that pharmacologic manipulation of cell signaling restored autophagy in cells exposed to HIV-1-infected cells raises the possibility of therapeutic manipulation of cell signaling to restore autophagy in HIV-1 infection."
https://openalex.org/W1975277416,"Background Simultaneous carriage of more than one strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae promotes horizontal gene transfer events and may lead to capsule switch and acquisition of antibiotic resistance. We studied the epidemiology of cocolonization with S. pneumoniae before and after introduction of the seven-valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine (PCV7). Methodology Nasopharyngeal swabs (n 1120) were collected from outpatients between 2004 and 2009 within an ongoing nationwide surveillance program. Cocolonization was detected directly from swabs by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Serotypes were identified by agglutination, multiplex PCR and microarray. Principal Findings Rate of multiple colonization remained stable up to three years after PCV7 introduction. Cocolonization was associated with serotypes of low carriage prevalence in the prevaccine era. Pneumococcal colonization density was higher in cocolonized samples and cocolonizing strains were present in a balanced ratio (median 1.38). Other characteristics of cocolonization were a higher frequency at young age, but no association with recurrent acute otitis media, recent antibiotic exposure, day care usage and PCV7 vaccination status. Conclusions Pneumococcal cocolonization is dominated by serotypes of low carriage prevalence in the prevaccine era, which coexist in the nasopharynx. Emergence of such previously rare serotypes under vaccine selection pressure may promote cocolonization in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2056975373,"Chronic stimulant abuse is associated with both impairment in decision making and structural abnormalities in brain gray and white matter. Recent data suggest these structural abnormalities may be related to functional impairment in important behavioral processes.In 15 cocaine-dependent and 18 control subjects, we examined relationships between decision-making performance on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and white matter integrity as measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Whole brain voxelwise analyses showed that, relative to controls, the cocaine group had lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and higher mean of the second and third eigenvalues (lambda perpendicular) in frontal and parietal white matter regions and the corpus callosum. Cocaine subjects showed worse performance on the IGT, notably over the last 40 trials. Importantly, FA and lambda perpendicular values in these regions showed a significant relationship with IGT performance on the last 40 trials.Compromised white matter integrity in cocaine dependence may be related to functional impairments in decision making."
https://openalex.org/W2047308815,"In the presence of a bacteriophage (a bacteria-attacking virus) resistance is clearly beneficial to the bacteria. As expected in such conditions, resistant bacteria emerge rapidly. However, in the absence of the phage, resistant bacteria often display reduced fitness, compared to their sensitive counterparts. The present study explored the fitness cost associated with phage-resistance as an opportunity to isolate an attenuated strain of S. aureus. The phage-resistant strain A172 was isolated from the phage-sensitive strain A170 in the presence of the M(Sa) phage. Acquisition of phage-resistance altered several properties of A172, causing reduced growth rate, under-expression of numerous genes and production of capsular polysaccharide. In vivo, A172 modulated the transcription of the TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and Il-1beta genes and, given intramuscularly, protected mice from a lethal dose of A170 (18/20). The heat-killed vaccine also afforded protection from heterologous methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (8/10 mice) or vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA) (9/10 mice). The same vaccine was also effective when administered as an aerosol. Anti-A172 mouse antibodies, in the dose of 10 microl/mouse, protected the animals (10/10, in two independent experiments) from a lethal dose of A170. Consisting predominantly of the sugars glucose and galactose, the capsular polysaccharide of A172, given in the dose of 25 microg/mouse, also protected the mice (20/20) from a lethal dose of A170. The above results demonstrate that selection for phage-resistance can facilitate bacterial vaccine preparation."
https://openalex.org/W2080114166,"Although autistic people have shown impairments in various learning and memory tasks, recent studies have reported mixed findings concerning implicit learning in ASD. Implicit skill learning, with its unconscious and statistical properties, underlies not only motor but also cognitive and social skills, and it therefore plays an important role from infancy to old age.We investigated probabilistic implicit sequence learning and its consolidation in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Three groups of children participated: thirteen with high-functioning ASD, 14 age-matched controls, and 13 IQ-matched controls. All were tested on the Alternating Serial Reaction Time Task (ASRT), making it possible to separate general skill learning from sequence-specific learning. The ASRT task was repeated after 16 hours. We found that control and ASD children showed similar sequence-specific and general skill learning in the learning phase. Consolidation of skill learning and sequence-specific learning were also intact in the ASD compared to the control groups.These results suggest that autistic children can use the effects/results of implicit learning not only for a short period, but also for a longer stretch of time. Using these findings, therapists can design more effective educational and rehabilitation programs."
https://openalex.org/W2121457024,"Minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins 2-7 are important in DNA replication licensing. Functional roles beyond licensing are speculated. In addition, significances in medulloblastoma (MB) remain unclear. In this study, we showed the frequent deregulation of MCM2 and MCM3 expression in 7 MB cell lines and 31 clinical samples. Moreover, DAOY and ONS76 and the clinical samples expressed elevated MCM7 transcripts with genomic gain of the gene. Immunopositivity restricted to tumor cells was found in 41, 37 and 53 out of 73 MB cases for MCM2, MCM3 and MCM7, respectively. High-MCM3 expression was associated with poor prognosis. Knockdowns of these MCMs significantly inhibited anchorage-dependent and -independent MB cell growth. The inhibition of MCM3 expression by small interfering RNA knockdown was related to G1 arrest with reduced cyclin A expression, whereas the MCM2- and MCM7-knocked-down cells arrested at G2/M with increased cyclin A expression. Interestingly, we demonstrated the links of these MCMs with cell migration and invasion using wound-healing and Transwell migration/invasion assays. Exogenous overexpression of MCM2, MCM3 and MCM7 increased anchorage-independent cell growth, and also cell migration and invasion capabilities in MB cells. The knockdown reduced the number of filopodial cells and the cells with intense stress fibers by blocking cdc42 and Rho activation. Taken together, deregulation of MCM2, MCM3 and MCM7 expression might be involved in MB tumorigenesis and we revealed undefined roles of these MCMs in control of MB cell migration and invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2160848010,"Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders caused by an aberrant accumulation of the misfolded cellular prion protein (PrPC) conformer, denoted as infectious scrapie isoform or PrPSc. In inherited human prion diseases, mutations in the open reading frame of the PrP gene (PRNP) are hypothesized to favor spontaneous generation of PrPSc in specific brain regions leading to neuronal cell degeneration and death. Here, we describe the NMR solution structure of the truncated recombinant human PrP from residue 90 to 231 carrying the Q212P mutation, which is believed to cause Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker (GSS) syndrome, a familial prion disease. The secondary structure of the Q212P mutant consists of a flexible disordered tail (residues 90–124) and a globular domain (residues 125–231). The substitution of a glutamine by a proline at the position 212 introduces novel structural differences in comparison to the known wild-type PrP structures. The most remarkable differences involve the C-terminal end of the protein and the β2–α2 loop region. This structure might provide new insights into the early events of conformational transition of PrPC into PrPSc. Indeed, the spontaneous formation of prions in familial cases might be due to the disruptions of the hydrophobic core consisting of β2–α2 loop and α3 helix."
https://openalex.org/W2078029457,"Background NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) are major contributors to long-term potentiation (LTP), a form of synaptic plasticity implicated in the process of learning and memory. These receptors consist of calcium-permeating NR1 and multiple regulatory NR2 subunits. A majority of studies show that both NR2A and NR2B-containing NMDARs can contribute to LTP, but their unique contributions to this form of synaptic plasticity remain poorly understood. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we show that NR2A and NR2B-containing receptors promote LTP differently in the CA1 hippocampus of 1-month old mice, with the NR2A receptors functioning through Ras-GRF2 and its downstream effector, Erk Map kinase, and NR2B receptors functioning independently of these signaling molecules. Conclusions/Significance This study demonstrates that NR2A-, but not NR2B, containing NMDA receptors induce LTP in pyramidal neurons of the CA1 hippocamus from 1 month old mice through Ras-GRF2 and Erk. This difference add new significance to the observation that the relative levels of these NMDAR subtypes is regulated in neurons, such that NR2A-containing receptors become more prominent late in postnatal development, after sensory experience and synaptic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2106013632,"Background Several lines of evidence indicate that polyploidy occurred by around 54 million years ago, early in the history of legume evolution, but it has not been known whether this event was confined to the papilionoid subfamily (Papilionoideae; e.g. beans, medics, lupins) or occurred earlier. Determining the timing of the polyploidy event is important for understanding whether polyploidy might have contributed to rapid diversification and radiation of the legumes near the origin of the family; and whether polyploidy might have provided genetic material that enabled the evolution of a novel organ, the nitrogen-fixing nodule. Although symbioses with nitrogen-fixing partners have evolved in several lineages in the rosid I clade, nodules are widespread only in legume taxa, being nearly universal in the papilionoids and in the mimosoid subfamily (e.g., mimosas, acacias) – which diverged from the papilionoid legumes around 58 million years ago, soon after the origin of the legumes. Methodology/Principal Findings Using transcriptome sequence data from Chamaecrista fasciculata, a nodulating member of the mimosoid clade, we tested whether this species underwent polyploidy within the timeframe of legume diversification. Analysis of gene family branching orders and synonymous-site divergence data from C. fasciculata, Glycine max (soybean), Medicago truncatula, and Vitis vinifera (grape; an outgroup to the rosid taxa) establish that the polyploidy event known from soybean and Medicago occurred after the separation of the mimosoid and papilionoid clades, and at or shortly before the Papilionoideae radiation. Conclusions The ancestral legume genome was not fundamentally polyploid. Moreover, because there has not been an independent instance of polyploidy in the Chamaecrista lineage there is no necessary connection between polyploidy and nodulation in legumes. Chamaecrista may serve as a useful model in the legumes that lacks a paleopolyploid history, at least relative to the widely studied papilionoid models."
https://openalex.org/W2044451669,"Salmonella Gallinarum is a pathogen with a host range specific to poultry, while Salmonella Enteritidis is a broad host range pathogen that colonizes poultry sub-clinically but is a leading cause of gastrointestinal salmonellosis in humans and many other species. Despite recent advances in our understanding of the complex interplay between Salmonella and their hosts, the molecular basis of host range restriction and unique pathobiology of Gallinarum remain largely unknown. Type VI Secretion System (T6SS) represents a new paradigm of protein secretion that is critical for the pathogenesis of many gram-negative bacteria. We recently identified a putative T6SS in the Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 19 (SPI-19) of Gallinarum. In Enteritidis, SPI-19 is a degenerate element that has lost most of the T6SS functions encoded in the island. In this work, we studied the contribution of SPI-19 to the colonization of Salmonella Gallinarum strain 287/91 in chickens. Non-polar deletion mutants of SPI-19 and the clpV gene, an essential T6SS component, colonized the ileum, ceca, liver and spleen of White Leghorn chicks poorly compared to the wild-type strain after oral inoculation. Return of SPI-19 to the DeltaSPI-19 mutant, using VEX-Capture, complemented this colonization defect. In contrast, transfer of SPI-19 from Gallinarum to Enteritidis resulted in transient increase in the colonization of the ileum, liver and spleen at day 1 post-infection, but at days 3 and 5 post-infection a strong colonization defect of the gut and internal organs of the experimentally infected chickens was observed. Our data indicate that SPI-19 and the T6SS encoded in this region contribute to the colonization of the gastrointestinal tract and internal organs of chickens by Salmonella Gallinarum and suggest that degradation of SPI-19 T6SS in Salmonella Enteritidis conferred an advantage in colonization of the avian host."
https://openalex.org/W2063460342,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) enters a non-replicating state when exposed to low oxygen tension, a condition the bacillus encounters in granulomas during infection. Determining how mycobacteria enter and maintain this state is a major focus of research. However, from a public health standpoint the importance of latent TB is its ability to reactivate. The mechanism by which mycobacteria return to a replicating state upon re-exposure to favorable conditions is not understood. In this study, we utilized reaeration from a defined hypoxia model to characterize the adaptive response of MTB following a return to favorable growth conditions. Global transcriptional analysis identified the approximately 100 gene Reaeration Response, induced relative to both log-phase and hypoxic MTB. This response includes chaperones and proteases, as well as the transcription factor Rv2745c, which we characterize as a Clp protease gene regulator (ClgR) orthologue. During reaeration, genes repressed during hypoxia are also upregulated in a wave of transcription that includes genes crucial to transcription, translation and oxidative phosphorylation and culminates in bacterial replication. In sum, this study defines a new transcriptional response of MTB with potential relevance to disease, and implicates ClgR as a regulator involved in resumption of replication following hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W1990137260,"Background Patients with multiple serrated polyps are at an increased risk for developing colorectal cancer (CRC). Recent reports have linked cigarette smoking with the subset of CRC that develops from serrated polyps. The aim of this work therefore was to investigate the association between smoking and the risk of CRC in high-risk genetics clinic patients presenting with multiple serrated polyps. Methods and Findings We identified 151 Caucasian individuals with multiple serrated polyps including at least 5 outside the rectum, and classified patients into non-smokers, current or former smokers at the time of initial diagnosis of polyposis. Cases were individuals with multiple serrated polyps who presented with CRC. Controls were individuals with multiple serrated polyps and no CRC. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to estimate associations between smoking and CRC with adjustment for age at first presentation, sex and co-existing traditional adenomas, a feature that has been consistently linked with CRC risk in patients with multiple serrated polyps. CRC was present in 56 (37%) individuals at presentation. Patients with at least one adenoma were 4 times more likely to present with CRC compared with patients without adenomas (OR = 4.09; 95%CI 1.27 to 13.14; P = 0.02). For females, the odds of CRC decreased by 90% in current smokers as compared to never smokers (OR = 0.10; 95%CI 0.02 to 0.47; P = 0.004) after adjusting for age and adenomas. For males, there was no relationship between current smoking and CRC. There was no statistical evidence of an association between former smoking and CRC for both sexes. Conclusion A decreased odds for CRC was identified in females with multiple serrated polyps who currently smoke, independent of age and the presence of a traditional adenoma. Investigations into the biological basis for these observations could lead to non-smoking-related therapies being developed to decrease the risk of CRC and colectomy in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2112873967,"Background Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) pathogenesis has been linked to the prolonged survival and/or apoptotic resistance of leukemic B cells in vivo, and is thought to be due to enhanced survival signaling responses to environmental factors that protect CLL cells from spontaneous and chemotherapy-induced death. Although normally associated with cell migration, the chemokine, CXCL12, is one of the factors known to support the survival of CLL cells. Thus, the signaling pathways activated by CXCL12 and its receptor, CXCR4, were investigated as components of these pathways and may represent targets that if inhibited, could render resistant CLL cells more susceptible to chemotherapy. Methodology/Principal Findings To determine the downstream signaling targets that contribute to the survival effects of CXCL12 in CLL, we took a phosphoproteomics approach to identify and compare phosphopeptides in unstimulated and CXCL12-stimulated primary CLL cells. While some of the survival pathways activated by CXCL12 in CLL are known, including Akt and ERK1/2, this approach enabled the identification of additional signaling targets and novel phosphoproteins that could have implications in CLL disease and therapy. In addition to the phosphoproteomics results, we provide evidence from western blot validation that the tumor suppressor, programmed cell death factor 4 (PDCD4), is a previously unidentified phosphorylation target of CXCL12 signaling in all CLL cells probed. Additionally, heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), which mediates anti-apoptotic signaling and has previously been linked to chemotherapeutic resistance, was detected in a subset (∼25%) of CLL patients cells examined. Conclusions/Significance Since PDCD4 and HSP27 have previously been associated with cancer and regulation of cell growth and apoptosis, these proteins may have novel implications in CLL cell survival and represent potential therapeutic targets. PDCD4 also represents a previously unknown signaling target of chemokine receptors; therefore, these observations increase our understanding of alternative pathways to migration that may be activated or inhibited by chemokines in the context of cancer cell survival."
https://openalex.org/W2042628823,"Background Since activation of the PI3K/(protein kinase B; PKB/akt) pathway has been shown to alter muscle mass and growth, the aim of this study was to determine whether resistance exercise increased insulin like growth factor (IGF) I/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signalling and whether altering PI(3,4,5)P3 metabolism genetically would increase load induced muscle growth. Methodology/Principal Findings Acute and chronic resistance exercise in wild type and muscle specific PTEN knockout mice were used to address the role of PI(3,4,5)P3 regulation in the development of skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Acute resistance exercise did not increase either IGF-1 receptor phosphorylation or IRS1/2 associated p85. Since insulin/IGF signalling to PI3K was unchanged, we next sought to determine whether inactivation of PTEN played a role in load-induced muscle growth. Muscle specific knockout of PTEN resulted in small but significant increases in heart (PTEN+/+ = 5.00±0.02 mg/g, PTEN−/− = 5.50±0.09 mg/g), and TA (PTEN+/+ = 1.74±0.04 mg/g, PTEN−/− = 1.89 ±0.03) muscle mass, while the GTN, SOL, EDL and PLN remain unchanged. Following ablation, hypertrophy of the PLN, SOL or EDL muscles was similar between PTEN−/− and PTEN+/+ animals. Even though there were some changes in overload-induced PKB and S6K1 phosphorylation, 1 hr following acute resistance exercise there was no difference in the phosphorylation state of S6K1 Thr389 between genotypes. Conclusions/Significance These data suggest that physiological loading does not lead to the enhanced activation of the PI3K/PKB/mTORC1 axis and that neither PI3K activation nor PTEN, and by extension PI(3,4,5)P3 levels, play a significant role in adult skeletal muscle growth."
https://openalex.org/W2032486089,"Cellular response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress or unfolded protein response (UPR) is a key defense mechanism associated with many human diseases. Despite its basic and clinical importance, the extent of ER stress inflicted by physiological and pathophysiological conditions remains difficult to quantitate, posing a huge obstacle that has hindered our further understanding of physiological UPR and its future therapeutic potential. Here we have optimized a Phos-tag-based system to detect the activation status of two proximal UPR sensors at the ER membrane. This method allowed for a quantitative assessment of the level of stress in the ER. Our data revealed quantitatively the extent of tissue-specific basal ER stress as well as ER stress caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins and the fasting-refeeding cycle. Our study may pave the foundation for future studies on physiological UPR, aid in the diagnosis of ER-associated diseases and improve and facilitate therapeutic strategies targeting UPR in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1969276724,"Sprouty negatively regulates receptor tyrosine kinase signals by inhibiting Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways. Sprouty is downregulated in breast, prostate and liver cancers and appears to function as a tumor suppressor. The role of sprouty in colonic neoplasia, however, has not been investigated. Sprouty-2 protein and mRNA transcripts were significantly upregulated in human colonic adenocarcinomas. Strikingly, the c-Met receptor was also upregulated in tumors with increased sprouty-2. To delineate a potential causal relationship between sprouty-2 and c-Met, K-ras mutant HCT-116 colon cancer cells were transduced with purified TAT-sprouty-2 protein or stably transfected with full-length human sprouty-2 gene. Sprouty-2 upregulation significantly increased cell proliferation by accelerating cell cycle transition. Sprouty-2 transfectants showed strong upregulation of c-Met protein and mRNA transcripts and hepatocyte growth factor-stimulated ERK and Akt phosphorylation and enhanced cell migration and invasion. In contrast, knockdown of c-Met by small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly decreased cell proliferation, migration and invasion in sprouty-2 transfectants. Further, knockdown of sprouty-2 by siRNA in parental HT-29 and LS-174T colon cancer cells also decreased cell invasion. Sprouty-2 transfectants formed significantly larger tumor xenografts and showed increased proliferation and angiogenesis and suppressed apoptosis. Sprouty-2 tumors metastasized to the liver from cecal orthotopic implants, suggesting that sprouty-2 might also enhance metastatic signals. Thus, in colon cancer sprouty functions as an oncogene and its effects are mediated in part by c-Met upregulation."
https://openalex.org/W1972513815,"Background The evolutionally conserved MAPK Sty1 and bZIP transcriptional activator Atf1 are known to play a pivotal role in response to the reactive oxygen species in S. pombe. However, it is unclear whether all of the H2O2-induced genes are directly regulated by the Sty1-Atf1 pathway and involved in growth fitness under H2O2-induced stress conditions. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we present the study on ChIP-chip mapping of the genomic binding sites for Sty1, Atf1, and the Atf1's binding partner Pcr1; the genome-wide transcriptional profiling of the atf1 and pcr1 strains in response to H2O2; and the phenotypic assessment of ∼90 Atf1/Pcr1-bound or unbound genes for growth fitness under H2O2 conditions. ChIP-chip analysis shows that Atf1 and Pcr1 binding sites are overlapped in the genome and constitutively present before H2O2 stress. On the other hand, Sty1 recruitment primarily occurs at the Atf1/Pcr1 binding sites and is induced by H2O2. We found that Atf1/Pcr1 is clearly responsible for the high-level transcriptional response to H2O2. Furthermore, phenotypic assessment indicates that among the H2O2-induced genes, Atf1/Pcr1-bound genes exhibit a higher likelihood of functional requirement for growth fitness under the stress condition than the Atf1/Pcr1-unbound genes do. Notably, we found that the Atf1/Pcr1-bound genes regardless of their responsiveness to H2O2 show a high probability of requirement for growth fitness. Conclusion/Significance Together, our analyses on global mapping of protein binding sites, genome-wide transcriptional profiling, and phenotypic assessment provide insight into mechanisms for global transcriptional regulation by the Sty1-Atf1 pathway in response to H2O2-induced reactive oxygen species."
https://openalex.org/W2038911675,"Light-activated large ventral lateral clock neurons (large LNv) modulate behavioral arousal and sleep in Drosophila while their counterparts, the small LNv (s-LNv) are important for circadian behavior. Recently, it has been proposed that the pattern of day-night locomotor behavioral activity is mediated by two anatomically distinct oscillators composed of a morning oscillator in the small LNv and an evening oscillator in the lateral dorsal neurons and an undefined number of dorsal pacemaker neurons. This contrasts with a circuit described by network models which are not as anatomically constrained. By selectively ablating the small LNv while sparing the large LNv, we tested the relative importance of the small and large LNv for regulating morning behavior of animals living in standard light/dark cycles. Behavioral anticipation of the onset of morning and the high amplitude morning startle response which coincides with light onset are preserved in small LNv functionally-ablated animals. However, the amplitude of the morning behavioral peak is severely attenuated in these animals during the transition from regular light/dark cycles to constant darkness, providing further support that small LNv are necessary for circadian behavior.

We have previously shown that HIF1α stability is regulated by SUMOylation under the hypoxic condition. However, how HIF1α became SUMOylated during hypoxia is still unknown. In this study we identify PIASy as a specific E3 ligase for hypoxia-induced HIF1α SUMOylation. Hypoxia promotes translocation of HIF1α to the nucleus to facilitate its binding to PIASy, enabling the conjugation of HIF1α by SUMO1. We further show that PIASy negatively regulates hypoxia-induced HIF1α stability and transactivation. Knocking down PIASy increases the angiogenic activity of endothelial cells. Moreover, we show an inverse relationship between expression of PIASy and tumor angiogenesis in colon cancer. Thus, we define an important role of PIASy in hypoxia signaling through promoting HIF1α SUMOylation."
https://openalex.org/W1979908081,"Norovirus GII.4 is the predominant genotype circulating worldwide over the last decade causing 80% of all norovirus outbreaks with new GII.4 variants reported in parallel with periodic epidemic waves of norovirus outbreaks. The circulating new GII.4 variants and the epidemiology of norovirus outbreaks in Alberta, Canada have not been described. Our hypothesis is that the periodic epidemic norovirus outbreak activity in Alberta was driven by new GII.4 variants evolving by genetic drift.The Alberta Provincial Public Health Laboratory performed norovirus testing using RT-PCR for suspected norovirus outbreaks in the province and the northern Territories between 2000 and 2008. At least one norovirus strain from 707 out of 1,057 (66.9%) confirmed norovirus outbreaks were successfully sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using BioNumerics and 617 (91.1%) outbreaks were characterized as caused by GII.4 with 598 assigned as novel variants including: GII.4-1996, GII.4-2002, GII.4-2004, GII.4-2006a, GII.4-2006b, GII.4-2008a and GII.4-2008b. Defining July to June of the following year as the yearly observation period, there was clear biannual pattern of low and high outbreak activity in Alberta. Within this biannual pattern, high outbreak activity followed the emergence of novel GII.4 variants. The two variants that emerged in 2006 had wider geographic distribution and resulted in higher outbreak activity compared to other variants. The outbreak settings were analyzed. Community-based group residence was the most common for both GII.4 variants and non-GII.4 variants. GII.4 variants were more commonly associated with outbreaks in acute care hospitals while outbreaks associated non-GII.4 variants were more commonly seen in school and community social events settings (p<0.01).The emergence of new norovirus GII.4 variants resulted in an increased norovirus outbreak activity in the following season in a unique biannual pattern in Alberta over an eight year period. The association between antigenic drift of GII.4 strains and epidemic norovirus outbreak activity could be due to changes in host immunity, viral receptor binding efficiency or virulence factors in the new variants. Early detection of novel GII.4 variants provides vital information that could be used to forecast the norovirus outbreak burden, enhance public health preparedness and allocate appropriate resources for outbreak management."
https://openalex.org/W2030107745,"Diabetic nephropathy is a complex and poorly understood disease process, and our current treatment options are limited. It remains critical, then, to identify novel therapeutic targets. Recently, a developmental protein and one of the bone morphogenetic protein antagonists, Gremlin, has emerged as a novel modulator of diabetic nephropathy. The high expression and strong co-localization with transforming growth factor- β1 in diabetic kidneys suggests a role for Gremlin in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. We have constructed a gremlin siRNA plasmid and have examined the effect of Gremlin inhibition on the progression of diabetic nephropathy in a mouse model. CD-1 mice underwent uninephrectomy and STZ treatment prior to receiving weekly injections of the plasmid. Inhibition of Gremlin alleviated proteinuria and renal collagen IV accumulation 12 weeks after the STZ injection and inhibited renal cell proliferation and apoptosis. In vitro experiments, using mouse mesangial cells, revealed that the transfect ion of gremlin siRNA plasmid reversed high glucose induced abnormalities, such as increased cell proliferation and apoptosis and increased collagen IV production. The decreased matrix metalloprotease level was partially normalized by transfection with gremlin siRNA plasmid. Additionally, we observed recovery of bone morphogenetic protein-7 signaling activity, evidenced by increases in phosphorylated Smad 5 protein levels. We conclude that inhibition of Gremlin exerts beneficial effects on the diabetic kidney mainly through maintenance of BMP-7 activity and that Gremlin may serve as a novel therapeutic target in the management of diabetic nephropathy."

Using data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, we sought to replicate these findings, examine them in a large population-based sample of African American study participants, and to investigate independent associations with other metabolic traits in order to determine if variation in GKCR contributes to their observed clustering. In addition, we examined the association of rs780094 with incident diabetes, coronary heart disease (CHD), and stroke over up mean follow-up times of 8, 15, and 15 years, respectively.Race-stratified analyses were conducted among 10,929 white and 3,960 black participants aged 45-64 at baseline assuming an additive genetic model and using linear and logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models.Previous findings replicated among white participants in multivariable adjusted models: the T-allele of rs780094 was associated with lower fasting glucose (p = 10(-7)) and insulin levels (p = 10(-6)), lower insulin resistance (HOMA-IR, p = 10(-9)), less prevalent diabetes (p = 10(-6)), and higher CRP (p = 10(-8)), 2-h postprandial glucose (OGTT, p = 10(-6)), and triglyceride levels (p = 10(-31)). Moreover, the T-allele was independently associated with higher HDL cholesterol levels (p = 0.022), metabolic syndrome prevalence (p = 0.043), and lower beta-cell function measured as HOMA-B (p = 0.011). Among black participants, the T-allele was associated only with higher triglyceride levels (p = 0.004) and lower insulin levels (p = 0.002) and HOMA-IR (p = 0.013). Prospectively, the T-allele was associated with reduced incidence of diabetes (p = 10(-4)) among white participants, but not with incidence of CHD or stroke.Our findings indicate rs780094 has independent associations with multiple metabolic traits as well as incident diabetes, but not incident CHD or stroke. The magnitude of association between the SNP and most traits was of lower magnitude among African American compared to white participants."
https://openalex.org/W2166583852,"Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells often show increased activity of the PI3K/Akt pathway. In addition, we have previously shown that EOC ascites induce Akt activation in the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-sensitive EOC cell line, CaOV3, leading to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis inhibition. In this study, we investigated the role of Akt in intrinsic resistance to TRAIL, which is common in EOC cells. We report that Akt activation reduces the sensitivity of EOC cells to TRAIL. TRAIL-resistant SKOV3ip1 and COV2 cells were sensitized to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by PI3K or Akt inhibitors although inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway did not interfere with the recruitment and processing of caspase-8 to the death-inducing signaling complex. Conversely, overexpression of Akt1 in TRAIL-sensitive cells promoted resistance to TRAIL. Although the fact that TRAIL-induced caspase-8 activation was observed in both sensitive and resistant cell lines, Bid cleavage occurred only in sensitive cells or in SKOV3ip1 cells treated with LY294002. Bid expression was low in resistant cells and Akt activation downregulated its expression. Depletion of Bid by siRNA in OVCAR3 cells was associated with a decrease in TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Overexpression of Bid only in SKOV3ip1 cells enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Simultaneous blockade of Akt pathway further increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Thus, Akt acts upstream of mitochondria and inhibits TRAIL-induced apoptosis by decreasing Bid protein levels and possibly inhibiting its cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W2130028615,"Understanding the mechanisms underlying ErbB3 overexpression in breast cancer will facilitate the rational design of therapies to disrupt ErbB2-ErbB3 oncogenic function. Although ErbB3 overexpression is frequently observed in breast cancer, the factors mediating its aberrant expression are poorly understood. In particular, the ErbB3 gene is not significantly amplified, raising the question as to how ErbB3 overexpression is achieved. In this study we showed that the ZNF217 transcription factor, amplified at 20q13 in ∼20% of breast tumors, regulates ErbB3 expression. Analysis of a panel of human breast cancer cell lines (n=50) and primary human breast tumors (n=15) showed a strong positive correlation between ZNF217 and ErbB3 expression. Ectopic expression of ZNF217 in human mammary epithelial cells induced ErbB3 expression, whereas ZNF217 silencing in breast cancer cells resulted in decreased ErbB3 expression. Although ZNF217 has previously been linked with transcriptional repression because of its close association with C-terminal-binding protein (CtBP)1/2 repressor complexes, our results show that ZNF217 also activates gene expression. We showed that ZNF217 recruitment to the ErbB3 promoter is CtBP1/2-independent and that ZNF217 and CtBP1/2 have opposite roles in regulating ErbB3 expression. In addition, we identify ErbB3 as one of the mechanisms by which ZNF217 augments PI-3K/Akt signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1975050281,"The present study demonstrated that murine protein serine/threonine kinase 38 (MPK38) coimmunoprecipitates with Smad proteins (Smad2, -3, -4, and -7) and that this association is mediated by the catalytic kinase domain of MPK38.

IntroductionType I transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptor kinases are serine/threonine kinases with roles in a wide array of cellular processes. Phosphorylation of the C-terminal SXS motif in receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) by these kinases is a crucial step in TGF-β family signaling (1Abdollah S. Macías-Silva M. Tsukazaki T. Hayashi H.

R-Smad phosphorylation results in the formation of heterodimeric complexes with the common Smad, Smad4. In addition, the phosphorylation of serine or threonine residues in the N-terminal or linker region has been observed in endogenous R-Smads (4Xu L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1759: 503-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have demonstrated the existence of kinases responsible for N-terminal or linker region phosphorylation events, including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), Ca2+ and calmodulin-dependent kinase II, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), 3The abbreviations used are: CDKcyclin-dependent kinaseSmadSma- and Mad-related proteinI-Smadinhibitory SmadMHMad homologyTβRtransforming growth factor-β receptorZPR9zinc-finger-like protein 9MPK38murine protein serine/threonine kinase 38PDK13-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1. protein kinase C (PKC), and G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (5Wrighton K.H.

Common Smad, Smad4, is constitutively phosphorylated in cells, although not all of the phosphorylation sites are known. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) has been shown to phosphorylate Smad4 at Thr277, resulting in the prevention of nuclear translocation of Smad4 (6Roelen B.A. Cohen O.S. Raychowdhury M.K.

The inhibitory Smads (I-Smads), Smad6 and Smad7, are phosphorylated by uncharacterized kinases (7Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K.

This provides a mechanism for integration of the Smad pathway with other signaling pathways, in which kinases act as essential mediators, which modulate Smad-mediated signaling. Thus, the identification and characterization of additional cellular kinases responsible for Smad phosphorylation could lead to a better understanding of the regulatory role of Smad phosphorylations, especially in the N-terminal and linker region, in TGF-β signaling.Murine protein serine/threonine kinase 38 (MPK38), also known as pEg3 kinase and maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (Melk), is a member of the AMP-activated protein kinase family of serine-threonine kinases (9Gil M.

Dev. 1997; 47: 148-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression patterns of MPK38 during maturation of oocytes and pre-implantation development were found to be typical of that described for maternally expressed genes, including β-actin and E-cadherin (11Bachvarova R.

This suggested that MPK38 may play a role in transducing signals in embryonic cells during pre-implantation, although its exact roles in development were not revealed. Additionally, MPK38 is also expressed in several other tissues, including embryonic stem cells (13Nakano I. Paucar A.A. Bajpai R. Dougherty J.D. Zewail A. Kelly T.K. Kim K.J. Ou J. Groszer M.

However, the exact biological function of MPK38 remains unclear.In this study, we show that there are direct physical and functional interactions between MPK38 and Smad proteins (Smad2, -3, -4, and -7), and that these interactions may play an important role in the regulation of Smad activities involved in TGF-β signaling.DISCUSSIONWe have previously shown that PDK1 interacts with intracellular signaling mediators of the TGF-β signaling pathway, such as Smad proteins (Smad2, -3, -4, and -7) and serine-threonine kinase receptor-associated protein, and that this interaction is involved in the reciprocal regulation of PI3K/PDK1 and TGF-β signaling (20Seong H.A.

Chem. 2005; 280: 42897-42908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), suggesting a functional link between the PI3K/PDK1 and TGF-β signaling pathways. Furthermore, cross-talk between p53 and TGF-β signaling has been reported (31Cordenonsi M. Dupont S. Maretto S. Insinga A. Imbriano C. Piccolo S. Cell. 2003; 113: 301-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). These data reveal the possibility of cross-talk between cell-survival and death-inducing signals, or between cell death signaling pathways. We have recently found that MPK38 participates in ASK1 activation through direct interaction and phosphorylation, resulting in the stimulation of ASK1-mediated apoptosis (17Jung H. Seong H.A. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 34541-34553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These findings, together with TGF-β-induced stimulation of MPK38 kinase activity (Fig. 1A), raise the possibility that TGF-β signaling may be associated with MPK38-mediated signaling. Based on this, we speculated that the physical interaction between MPK38 and Smad proteins may occur in vivo.In this study, we demonstrated that MPK38 physically interacts with Smad proteins (Smad2, -3, -4, and -7) (Fig. 1). Moreover, our data indicate that the kinase activity of MPK38 is required for its ability to stimulate TGF-β-induced transcription (Fig. 5) and apoptosis (Fig. 9). These findings are similar to those from recent studies showing that PDK1 and its downstream target Akt physically interact with Smad2, -3, -4, and -7, and inhibit TGF-β signaling in a kinase-dependent manner (20Seong H.A. Jung H. Kim K.T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12272-12289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 32Song K. Wang H. Krebs T.L. Danielpour D. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 58-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In addition, in our study, wild-type MPK38 stimulated the normal movement of Smad proteins (Smad3 and -7) in response to TGF-β1, but the kinase-dead MPK38 did not show such an effect (Fig. 8). In this context, our current evidence indicates that MPK38 is a potential positive regulator of the TGF-β signaling pathway. This is in contrast to PDK1, which acts as a negative regulator of TGF-β signaling. However, our present results do not support the possibility that the MPK38-mediated stimulation of TGF-β signaling is due only to the physical interaction between MPK38 and Smad proteins, because the kinase-dead MPK38, which lacks the ability to regulate TGF-β signaling, was shown to associate with Smad proteins at levels similar to those of wild-type MPK38 (data not shown). These data suggest that MPK38-mediated phosphorylation of Smad proteins (Smad2, -3, -4, and -7) through direct interaction plays a crucial role in the positive regulation of TGF-β signaling induced by MPK38.Although C-terminal SXS phosphorylation of R-Smad by the type I TGF-β receptor is an important step in TGF-β signaling, additional phosphorylations by intracellular protein kinases are also involved in the regulation of Smad activities. Recent studies have shown that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase contribute to Smad3 phosphorylation at Ser204/208/213 in the linker region and stimulate its transcriptional activity (33Kamaraju A.K. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1024-1036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Similarly, our results showed that the MPK38-mediated phosphorylation of Smad3 at Ser204 plays a key role in the stimulation of TGF-β signaling (Fig. 6). However, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-mediated phosphorylation of Smad3 at Ser204 and other sites (Ser208 and Thr179), and of Smad2 at Ser245/250/255 and Thr220, showed an inhibitory effect on Smad3 activity (34Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). These findings imply that MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of Smad2 and -3, in contrast to that of MPK38, appears to have a dual role in the regulation of Smad2 and -3. Growing evidence indicates that, in addition to these kinases, a variety of intracellular protein kinases (5Wrighton K.H. Lin X. Feng X.H.

On the other hand, Smad4 is known to be constitutively phosphorylated in cells, although the phosphorylation sites are yet to be discovered (5Wrighton K.H. Lin X. Feng X.H.

In this regard, the discovery of phosphorylation of Smad4 at Ser343 by MPK38 (Fig. 3B), together with a recent result showing that ERK-mediated phosphorylation of Smad4 at Thr277 is involved in the nuclear translocation of Smad4 (6Roelen B.A. Cohen O.S.

Our results showed that MPK38 is also involved in Smad6 phosphorylation at Thr176, and that this phosphorylation is important for the regulation of Smad6-mediated bone morphogenetic protein signaling (supplemental Fig. S3). In addition, Smad7 was found to be phosphorylated at Ser249 (8Pulaski L. Landström M. Heldin C.H. Souchelnytskyi S. J. Biol.

Our results from this study have provided evidence that MPK38 stimulates TGF-β signaling by phosphorylating Smad7 at Thr96 (Fig. 6D), suggesting that MPK38 is a putative intracellular kinase for Smad7 phosphorylation in cells.We previously observed that PDK1-mediated inhibition of TGF-β signaling is accompanied by the modulation of complex formation between the TGF-β receptor and Smad proteins (Smad3 and -7) (20Seong H.A. Jung H. Kim K.T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12272-12289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To explore the mechanism by which MPK38 stimulates TGF-β-induced transcriptional activation, we also investigated whether MPK38 can modulate the association between the TGF-β receptor and Smad proteins (Smad3 and -7). Our results showed that the ability of wild-type MPK38 to stimulate TGF-β-mediated transcriptional activation is dependent on MPK38-induced modulation of Smad(s) binding to the TGF-β receptor (Fig. 7). Wild-type MPK38 increased complex formation between the TGF-β receptor and Smad3, and simultaneously decreased complex formation between the TGF-β receptor and Smad7, leading to stimulation of TGF-β signaling. However, the association of TGF-β receptor with Smad proteins was not affected by the kinase-dead MPK38. These observations imply that the kinase activity of MPK38 is also required for modulation of complex formation between the TGF-β receptor and Smad proteins, in agreement with reporter (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6), localization (Fig. 8), and apoptosis (Fig. 9) studies.In summary, our findings suggest that MPK38 positively regulates TGF-β signaling through direct interaction and phosphorylation of Smad proteins, and also that Smad proteins may function as linkers between TGF-β and MPK38-mediated signaling. The discovery of MPK38-mediated stimulation of TGF-β signaling should allow us to gain insight into how TGF-β signaling is regulated in vivo, since MPK38 directly interacts and phosphorylates all of the Smad proteins (Smad2, -3, -4, and -7) we tested. IntroductionType I transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptor kinases are serine/threonine kinases with roles in a wide array of cellular processes. Phosphorylation of the C-terminal SXS motif in receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) by these kinases is a crucial step in TGF-β family signaling (1Abdollah S. Macías-Silva M. Tsukazaki T. Hayashi H.

R-Smad phosphorylation results in the formation of heterodimeric complexes with the common Smad, Smad4. In addition, the phosphorylation of serine or threonine residues in the N-terminal or linker region has been observed in endogenous R-Smads (4Xu L. Biochim. Biophys.

This provides a mechanism for integration of the Smad pathway with other signaling pathways, in which kinases act as essential mediators, which modulate Smad-mediated signaling. Thus, the identification and characterization of additional cellular kinases responsible for Smad phosphorylation could lead to a better understanding of the regulatory role of Smad phosphorylations, especially in the N-terminal and linker region, in TGF-β signaling.Murine protein serine/threonine kinase 38 (MPK38), also known as pEg3 kinase and maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (Melk), is a member of the AMP-activated protein kinase family of serine-threonine kinases (9Gil M.

In this study, we show that there are direct physical and functional interactions between MPK38 and Smad proteins (Smad2, -3, -4, and -7), and that these interactions may play an important role in the regulation of Smad activities involved in TGF-β signaling. DISCUSSIONWe have previously shown that PDK1 interacts with intracellular signaling mediators of the TGF-β signaling pathway, such as Smad proteins (Smad2, -3, -4, and -7) and serine-threonine kinase receptor-associated protein, and that this interaction is involved in the reciprocal regulation of PI3K/PDK1 and TGF-β signaling (20Seong H.A.

Chem. 2005; 280: 42897-42908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), suggesting a functional link between the PI3K/PDK1 and TGF-β signaling pathways. Furthermore, cross-talk between p53 and TGF-β signaling has been reported (31Cordenonsi M. Dupont S. Maretto S. Insinga A. Imbriano C. Piccolo S. Cell. 2003; 113: 301-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). These data reveal the possibility of cross-talk between cell-survival and death-inducing signals, or between cell death signaling pathways. We have recently found that MPK38 participates in ASK1 activation through direct interaction and phosphorylation, resulting in the stimulation of ASK1-mediated apoptosis (17Jung H. Seong H.A. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 34541-34553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These findings, together with TGF-β-induced stimulation of MPK38 kinase activity (Fig. 1A), raise the possibility that TGF-β signaling may be associated with MPK38-mediated signaling. Based on this, we speculated that the physical interaction between MPK38 and Smad proteins may occur in vivo.In this study, we demonstrated that MPK38 physically interacts with Smad proteins (Smad2, -3, -4, and -7) (Fig. 1). Moreover, our data indicate that the kinase activity of MPK38 is required for its ability to stimulate TGF-β-induced transcription (Fig. 5) and apoptosis (Fig. 9). These findings are similar to those from recent studies showing that PDK1 and its downstream target Akt physically interact with Smad2, -3, -4, and -7, and inhibit TGF-β signaling in a kinase-dependent manner (20Seong H.A. Jung H. Kim K.T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12272-12289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 32Song K. Wang H. Krebs T.L. Danielpour D. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 58-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In addition, in our study, wild-type MPK38 stimulated the normal movement of Smad proteins (Smad3 and -7) in response to TGF-β1, but the kinase-dead MPK38 did not show such an effect (Fig. 8). In this context, our current evidence indicates that MPK38 is a potential positive regulator of the TGF-β signaling pathway. This is in contrast to PDK1, which acts as a negative regulator of TGF-β signaling. However, our present results do not support the possibility that the MPK38-mediated stimulation of TGF-β signaling is due only to the physical interaction between MPK38 and Smad proteins, because the kinase-dead MPK38, which lacks the ability to regulate TGF-β signaling, was shown to associate with Smad proteins at levels similar to those of wild-type MPK38 (data not shown). These data suggest that MPK38-mediated phosphorylation of Smad proteins (Smad2, -3, -4, and -7) through direct interaction plays a crucial role in the positive regulation of TGF-β signaling induced by MPK38.Although C-terminal SXS phosphorylation of R-Smad by the type I TGF-β receptor is an important step in TGF-β signaling, additional phosphorylations by intracellular protein kinases are also involved in the regulation of Smad activities. Recent studies have shown that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase contribute to Smad3 phosphorylation at Ser204/208/213 in the linker region and stimulate its transcriptional activity (33Kamaraju A.K. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1024-1036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Similarly, our results showed that the MPK38-mediated phosphorylation of Smad3 at Ser204 plays a key role in the stimulation of TGF-β signaling (Fig. 6). However, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-mediated phosphorylation of Smad3 at Ser204 and other sites (Ser208 and Thr179), and of Smad2 at Ser245/250/255 and Thr220, showed an inhibitory effect on Smad3 activity (34Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). These findings imply that MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of Smad2 and -3, in contrast to that of MPK38, appears to have a dual role in the regulation of Smad2 and -3. Growing evidence indicates that, in addition to these kinases, a variety of intracellular protein kinases (5Wrighton K.H. Lin X. Feng X.H.

On the other hand, Smad4 is known to be constitutively phosphorylated in cells, although the phosphorylation sites are yet to be discovered (5Wrighton K.H. Lin X. Feng X.H. Cell Res. 2009; 19: 8-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 6Roelen B.A. Cohen O.S. Raychowdhury M.K. Chadee D.N. Zhang Y. Kyriakis J.M. Alessandrini A.A. Lin H.Y. Am. J. Physiol.

In this regard, the discovery of phosphorylation of Smad4 at Ser343 by MPK38 (Fig. 3B), together with a recent result showing that ERK-mediated phosphorylation of Smad4 at Thr277 is involved in the nuclear translocation of Smad4 (6Roelen B.A. Cohen O.S.

The inhibitory Smad proteins, Smad6 and Smad7, are phosphoproteins (7Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K.

Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4086-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Our results showed that MPK38 is also involved in Smad6 phosphorylation at Thr176, and that this phosphorylation is important for the regulation of Smad6-mediated bone morphogenetic protein signaling (supplemental Fig. S3). In addition, Smad7 was found to be phosphorylated at Ser249 (8Pulaski L. Landström M. Heldin C.H. Souchelnytskyi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14344-14349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), although the intracellular kinases responsible for phosphorylating Smad7 have not yet been identified. Our results from this study have provided evidence that MPK38 stimulates TGF-β signaling by phosphorylating Smad7 at Thr96 (Fig. 6D), suggesting that MPK38 is a putative intracellular kinase for Smad7 phosphorylation in cells.We previously observed that PDK1-mediated inhibition of TGF-β signaling is accompanied by the modulation of complex formation between the TGF-β receptor and Smad proteins (Smad3 and -7) (20Seong H.A. Jung H. Kim K.T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12272-12289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To explore the mechanism by which MPK38 stimulates TGF-β-induced transcriptional activation, we also investigated whether MPK38 can modulate the association between the TGF-β receptor and Smad proteins (Smad3 and -7). Our results showed that the ability of wild-type MPK38 to stimulate TGF-β-mediated transcriptional activation is dependent on MPK38-induced modulation of Smad(s) binding to the TGF-β receptor (Fig. 7). Wild-type MPK38 increased complex formation between the TGF-β receptor and Smad3, and simultaneously decreased complex formation between the TGF-β receptor and Smad7, leading to stimulation of TGF-β signaling. However, the association of TGF-β receptor with Smad proteins was not affected by the kinase-dead MPK38. These observations imply that the kinase activity of MPK38 is also required for modulation of complex formation between the TGF-β receptor and Smad proteins, in agreement with reporter (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6), localization (Fig. 8), and apoptosis (Fig. 9) studies.In summary, our findings suggest that MPK38 positively regulates TGF-β signaling through direct interaction and phosphorylation of Smad proteins, and also that Smad proteins may function as linkers between TGF-β and MPK38-mediated signaling. The discovery of MPK38-mediated stimulation of TGF-β signaling should allow us to gain insight into how TGF-β signaling is regulated in vivo, since MPK38 directly interacts and phosphorylates all of the Smad proteins (Smad2, -3, -4, and -7) we tested. We have previously shown that PDK1 interacts with intracellular signaling mediators of the TGF-β signaling pathway, such as Smad proteins (Smad2, -3, -4, and -7) and serine-threonine kinase receptor-associated protein, and that this interaction is involved in the reciprocal regulation of PI3K/PDK1 and TGF-β signaling (20Seong H.A.

Chem. 2005; 280: 42897-42908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), suggesting a functional link between the PI3K/PDK1 and TGF-β signaling pathways. Furthermore, cross-talk between p53 and TGF-β signaling has been reported (31Cordenonsi M. Dupont S. Maretto S. Insinga A. Imbriano C. Piccolo S. Cell. 2003; 113: 301-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). These data reveal the possibility of cross-talk between cell-survival and death-inducing signals, or between cell death signaling pathways. We have recently found that MPK38 participates in ASK1 activation through direct interaction and phosphorylation, resulting in the stimulation of ASK1-mediated apoptosis (17Jung H. Seong H.A. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 34541-34553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These findings, together with TGF-β-induced stimulation of MPK38 kinase activity (Fig. 1A), raise the possibility that TGF-β signaling may be associated with MPK38-mediated signaling. Based on this, we speculated that the physical interaction between MPK38 and Smad proteins may occur in vivo. In this study, we demonstrated that MPK38 physically interacts with Smad proteins (Smad2, -3, -4, and -7) (Fig. 1). Moreover, our data indicate that the kinase activity of MPK38 is required for its ability to stimulate TGF-β-induced transcription (Fig. 5) and apoptosis (Fig. 9). These findings are similar to those from recent studies showing that PDK1 and its downstream target Akt physically interact with Smad2, -3, -4, and -7, and inhibit TGF-β signaling in a kinase-dependent manner (20Seong H.A. Jung H. Kim K.T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12272-12289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 32Song K. Wang H. Krebs T.L. Danielpour D. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 58-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In addition, in our study, wild-type MPK38 stimulated the normal movement of Smad proteins (Smad3 and -7) in response to TGF-β1, but the kinase-dead MPK38 did not show such an effect (Fig. 8). In this context, our current evidence indicates that MPK38 is a potential positive regulator of the TGF-β signaling pathway. This is in contrast to PDK1, which acts as a negative regulator of TGF-β signaling. However, our present results do not support the possibility that the MPK38-mediated stimulation of TGF-β signaling is due only to the physical interaction between MPK38 and Smad proteins, because the kinase-dead MPK38, which lacks the ability to regulate TGF-β signaling, was shown to associate with Smad proteins at levels similar to those of wild-type MPK38 (data not shown). These data suggest that MPK38-mediated phosphorylation of Smad proteins (Smad2, -3, -4, and -7) through direct interaction plays a crucial role in the positive regulation of TGF-β signaling induced by MPK38. Although C-terminal SXS phosphorylation of R-Smad by the type I TGF-β receptor is an important step in TGF-β signaling, additional phosphorylations by intracellular protein kinases are also involved in the regulation of Smad activities. Recent studies have shown that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase contribute to Smad3 phosphorylation at Ser204/208/213 in the linker region and stimulate its transcriptional activity (33Kamaraju A.K. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1024-1036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Similarly, our results showed that the MPK38-mediated phosphorylation of Smad3 at Ser204 plays a key role in the stimulation of TGF-β signaling (Fig. 6). However, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-mediated phosphorylation of Smad3 at Ser204 and other sites (Ser208 and Thr179), and of Smad2 at Ser245/250/255 and Thr220, showed an inhibitory effect on Smad3 activity (34Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). These findings imply that MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of Smad2 and -3, in contrast to that of MPK38, appears to have a dual role in the regulation of Smad2 and -3. Growing evidence indicates that, in addition to these kinases, a variety of intracellular protein kinases (5Wrighton K.H. Lin X. Feng X.H.

On the other hand, Smad4 is known to be constitutively phosphorylated in cells, although the phosphorylation sites are yet to be discovered (5Wrighton K.H. Lin X. Feng X.H. Cell Res. 2009; 19: 8-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 6Roelen B.A. Cohen O.S. Raychowdhury M.K. Chadee D.N. Zhang Y. Kyriakis J.M. Alessandrini A.A. Lin H.Y. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 285: C823-C830Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In this regard, the discovery of phosphorylation of Smad4 at Ser343 by MPK38 (Fig. 3B), together with a recent result showing that ERK-mediated phosphorylation of Smad4 at Thr277 is involved in the nuclear translocation of Smad4 (6Roelen B.A. Cohen O.S. Raychowdhury M.K. Chadee D.N. Zhang Y. Kyriakis J.M. Alessandrini A.A. Lin H.Y. Am. J. Physiol.

The inhibitory Smad proteins, Smad6 and Smad7, are phosphoproteins (7Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K.

It has been shown that protein kinase X, involved in macrophage differentiation, phosphorylates Smad6 at Ser435 (39Glesne D. Huberman E. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4086-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Our results showed that MPK38 is also involved in Smad6 phosphorylation at Thr176, and that this phosphorylation is important for the regulation of Smad6-mediated bone morphogenetic protein signaling (supplemental Fig. S3). In addition, Smad7 was found to be phosphorylated at Ser249 (8Pulaski L. Landström M. Heldin C.H. Souchelnytskyi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14344-14349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), although the intracellular kinases responsible for phosphorylating Smad7 have not yet been identified. Our results from this study have provided evidence that MPK38 stimulates TGF-β signaling by phosphorylating Smad7 at Thr96 (Fig. 6D), suggesting that MPK38 is a putative intracellular kinase for Smad7 phosphorylation in cells. We previously observed that PDK1-mediated inhibition of TGF-β signaling is accompanied by the modulation of complex formation between the TGF-β receptor and Smad proteins (Smad3 and -7) (20Seong H.A. Jung H. Kim K.T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12272-12289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To explore the mechanism by which MPK38 stimulates TGF-β-induced transcriptional activation, we also investigated whether MPK38 can modulate the association between the TGF-β receptor and Smad proteins (Smad3 and -7). Our results showed that the ability of wild-type MPK38 to stimulate TGF-β-mediated transcriptional activation is dependent on MPK38-induced modulation of Smad(s) binding to the TGF-β receptor (Fig. 7). Wild-type MPK38 increased complex formation between the TGF-β receptor and Smad3, and simultaneously decreased complex formation between the TGF-β receptor and Smad7, leading to stimulation of TGF-β signaling. However, the association of TGF-β receptor with Smad proteins was not affected by the kinase-dead MPK38. These observations imply that the kinase activity of MPK38 is also required for modulation of complex formation between the TGF-β receptor and Smad proteins, in agreement with reporter (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6), localization (Fig. 8), and apoptosis (Fig. 9) studies.

https://openalex.org/W1983015752,"Lung adenocarcinoma (AD) represents a predominant type of lung cancer demonstrating significant morphologic and molecular heterogeneity. We sought to understand this heterogeneity by utilizing gene expression analyses of 432 AD samples and examining associations between 27 known cancer-related pathways and the AD subtype, clinical characteristics and patient survival. Unsupervised clustering of AD and gene expression enrichment analysis reveals that cell proliferation is the most important pathway separating tumors into subgroups. Further, AD with increased cell proliferation demonstrate significantly poorer outcome and an increased solid AD subtype component. Additionally, we find that tumors with any solid component have decreased survival as compared to tumors without a solid component. These results lead to the potential to use a relatively simple pathological examination of a tumor in order to determine its aggressiveness and the patient's prognosis. Additional results suggest the ability to use a similar approach to determine a patient's sensitivity to targeted treatment. We then demonstrated the consistency of these findings using two independent AD cohorts from Asia (N = 87) and Europe (N = 89) using the identical analytic procedures."

Here, we investigated whether the ADP-ribose-activated TRPM2 channel is a target for modulation by extracellular acidic pH by patch clamp recording of HEK293 cells expressing hTRPM2 channel. Induced whole cell or single channel currents were rapidly inhibited upon subsequent exposure to acidic pH. The inhibition in the steady state was complete, voltage-independent, and pH-independent in the range of pH 4.0-6.0. The inhibition was irreversible upon returning to pH 7.3, suggesting channel inactivation. In contrast, exposure of closed channels to acidic pH reduced the subsequent channel activation in a pH-dependent manner with an IC(50) for H(+) of 20 μm (pH 4.7) and rendered subsequent current inhibition largely reversible, indicating differential or state-dependent inhibition and inactivation. Alanine substitution of residues in the outer vestibule of the pore including Lys(952) and Asp(1002) significantly slowed down or reduced acidic pH-induced inhibition and prevented inactivation. The results suggest that acidic pH acts as a negative feedback mechanism where protons bind to the outer vestibule of the TRPM2 channel pore and inhibit the TRPM2 channels in a state-dependent manner."

We demonstrated down regulation of a number of key genes involved in proliferation and cell cycle progression including Mcm7, Brca2, Prim1, Cenpo and Aurka in trisomic neurospheres. We found that trisomy did not affect the number of adult neural stem cells but resulted in reduced numbers of neural progenitors and neuroblasts. Analysis of differentiating adult Ts1Cje neural progenitors showed a severe reduction in numbers of neurons produced with a tendency for less elaborate neurites, whilst the numbers of astrocytes was increased.We have shown that trisomy affects a number of elements of adult neurogenesis likely to result in a progressive pathogenesis and consequently providing the potential for the development of therapies to slow progression of, or even ameliorate the neuronal deficits suffered by DS individuals."

A systems biology approach was used to identify regulatory gene networks essential for primordial follicle development. Transcriptional responses to eight different growth factors known to influence primordial follicles were used to construct a bionetwork of regulatory genes involved in rat primordial follicle development. Over 1,500 genes were found to be regulated by the various growth factors and a network analysis identified critical gene modules involved in a number of signaling pathways and cellular processes. A set of 55 genes was identified as potential critical regulators of these gene modules, and a sub-network associated with development was determined. Within the network two previously identified regulatory genes were confirmed (i.e., Pdgfa and Fgfr2) and a new factor was identified, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). CTGF was tested in ovarian organ cultures and found to stimulate primordial follicle development. Therefore, the relevant gene network associated with primordial follicle development was validated and the critical genes and pathways involved in this process were identified. This is one of the first applications of network analysis to a normal developmental process. These observations provide insights into potential therapeutic targets for preventing ovarian disease and promoting female reproduction."
https://openalex.org/W2055582674,"A complex of proteins scaffolded by the PDZ protein, whirlin, reside at the stereocilia tip and are critical for stereocilia development and elongation. We have shown that in outer hair cells (OHCs) whirlin is part of a larger complex involving the MAGUK protein, p55, and protein 4.1R. Whirlin interacts with p55 which is expressed exclusively in outer hair cells (OHC) in both the long stereocilia that make up the stereocilia bundle proper as well as surrounding shorter microvilli that will eventually regress. In erythrocytes, p55 forms a tripartite complex with protein 4.1R and glycophorin C promoting the assembly of actin filaments and the interaction of whirlin with p55 indicates that it plays a similar role in OHC stereocilia. However, the components directly involved in actin filament regulation in stereocilia are unknown. We have investigated additional components of the whirlin interactome by identifying interacting partners to p55. We show that the actin capping and severing protein, gelsolin, is a part of the whirlin complex. Gelsolin is detected in OHC where it localizes to the tips of the shorter rows but not to the longest row of stereocilia and the pattern of localisation at the apical hair cell surface is strikingly similar to p55. Like p55, gelsolin is ablated in the whirler and shaker2 mutants. Moreover, in a gelsolin mutant, stereocilia in the apex of the cochlea become long and straggly indicating defects in the regulation of stereocilia elongation. The identification of gelsolin provides for the first time a link between the whirlin scaffolding protein complex involved in stereocilia elongation and a known actin regulatory molecule."

Our objective was to investigate the effect and mechanism of action of plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) overexpression on Ca2+-regulated apoptosis in clonal β-cells. Clonal β-cells (BRIN-BD11) were examined for the effect of PMCA overexpression on cytosolic and mitochondrial [Ca2+] using a combination of aequorins with different Ca2+ affinities and on the ER and mitochondrial pathways of apoptosis. β-cell stimulation generated microdomains of high [Ca2+] in the cytosol and subcellular heterogeneities in [Ca2+] among mitochondria. Overexpression of PMCA decreased [Ca2+] in the cytosol, the ER, and the mitochondria and activated the IRE1α-XBP1s but inhibited the PRKR-like ER kinase-eIF2α and the ATF6-BiP pathways of the ER-unfolded protein response. Increased Bax/Bcl-2 expression ratio was observed in PMCA overexpressing β-cells. This was followed by Bax translocation to the mitochondria with subsequent cytochrome c release, opening of the permeability transition pore, and apoptosis. In conclusion, clonal β-cell stimulation generates microdomains of high [Ca2+] in the cytosol and subcellular heterogeneities in [Ca2+] among mitochondria. PMCA overexpression depletes intracellular [Ca2+] stores and, despite a decrease in mitochondrial [Ca2+], induces apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway.

These data open the way to new strategies to control cellular Ca2+ homeostasis that could decrease β-cell apoptosis in diabetes. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, plays a major role in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Ca2+, in addition to its contribution to the regulation of cellular processes, may act as a proapoptotic agent, and both intracellular Ca2+ depletion or overload may trigger apoptosis (1Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Nicotera P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 552-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (2416) Google Scholar). Apoptosis can be triggered by three pathways: oligomerization of death receptors, mitochondrial damage, and the ER pathway (2Mehmet H. Nature. 2000; 403: 29-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 3Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar). At the level of the ER, disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis causes ER stress with subsequent activation of cysteine protease 12 (caspase-12) that cleaves executioner caspases. The latter cleave structural components of the cell that complete the apoptosis process (1Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Nicotera P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 552-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (2416) Google Scholar). Before orienting the cell fate to apoptosis, the cell triggers homeostatic mechanisms to preserve ER function, a process known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) 6The abbreviations used are: UPRunfolded protein responsePMCAplasma membrane Ca2+-ATPasePERKPRKR-like ER kinaseCHOPC/EBP homologous proteinOMMouter mitochondrial membraneΔΨmembrane potentialSERCAsarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPaseCPAcyclopiazonic acidBiPimmunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein. . The UPR is mediated by three pathways controlled by transmembrane ER proteins: IRE1α (inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase and endonuclease 1α), PRKR-like ER kinase (PERK), and ATF6 (activation of transcription factor 6). These proteins activate specific transcription factors (such as XBP1s (spliced X- box binding protein 1) and ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4), triggering the expression of UPR-related genes (such as C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP)) (4Ron D.

At the level of the mitochondria, a crucial phenomenon leading to cell death is the mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (6Kroemer G. Galluzzi L. Brenner C. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 99-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (2877) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial membrane permeabilization implies the permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), the inner mitochondrial membrane or both. In the case of OMM permeabilization, the role of proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family (Bax and Bak) appears to be prominent. Upon apoptosis induction, Bax oligomerizes and inserts into the OMM-forming supramolecular openings, allowing the release in the cytoplasm of intermembrane space proteins (including cytochrome c) leading to caspase-9 activation. In contrast, the antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family (e.g. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) prevent the oligomerization of Bax and Bak in OMM and pore formation (6Kroemer G. Galluzzi L. Brenner C. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 99-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (2877) Google Scholar). In the case of inner mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, the principal mechanism involved is the so-called “permeability transition,” due to the opening of a voltage-dependent channel known as the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (7Crompton M. Barksby E. Johnson N. Capano M. Biochimie. 2002; 84: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The permeability transition pore can be activated by high Ca2+ concentrations in the mitochondrial matrix, and a prolonged opening of the permeability transition pore is followed by swelling of the mitochondrial matrix, rupture of the OMM, loss of the membrane potential (ΔΨ), and the release of cytochrome c (8Brenner C. Grimm S. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4744-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Due to the low affinity of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake system (the uniporter), Ca2+ is taken up in mitochondria in restricted zones of the cytosol displaying microdomains of high Ca2+ concentration, e.g. close to the ER Ca2+ release channels and/or to the plasma membrane Ca2+ channels (9Rizzuto R. Pozzan T. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 369-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, 10Montero M. Alonso M.T. Carnicero E. Cuchillo-Ibáñez I. Albillos A. García A.G. García-Sancho J. Alvarez J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The different apoptotic pathways may be interrelated. For instance, in the case of sustained release of Ca2+ from the ER, the cation may be taken up by mitochondria localized in the Ca2+ microdomain, with subsequent mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and cell death (11Pinton P. Rizzuto R. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1409-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In view of the putative proapoptotic role of Ca2+, the control of intracellular Ca2+ may represent a potential approach to prevent or enhance apoptosis and hence to treat diseases characterized by either an increased rate of apoptosis (e.g. type 1 diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, viral infections, etc.) or by a decrease rate of cell death (e.g. cancers), respectively. This could be done by overexpressing or down-regulating key mechanisms responsible for Ca2+ extrusion from cells, namely the Na/Ca exchanger and the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA; 12Blaustein M.P.

In a previous study, we showed that overexpression of Na/Ca exchanger in an insulin-secreting cell line (BRIN-BD11; 22Diaz-Horta O. Kamagate A. Herchuelz A. Van Eylen F. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1815-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) depleted ER Ca2+ stores, leading to ER stress and apoptosis. In the present study, we examined the impact of PMCA2 overexpression on cell death in BRIN-BD11 cells. To clarify the mechanisms involved in β-cell death, we used the luminescent Ca2+ probe aequorin (23Brini M. Methods. 2008; 46: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) to determine [Ca2+] prevailing in the cytoplasm ([Ca2+]i) and the mitochondria ([Ca2+]m). Furthermore, we examined the expression of several proteins implicated in ER stress response and in mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. Our data show that stimulation of insulin-secreting cells generates microdomains of high [Ca2+]i and subcellular heterogeneities in [Ca2+]m among mitochondria. PMCA2 overexpression depletes cytosolic, ER and mitochondrial Ca2+ stores and induces apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway. Media, chemicals, and antibodies were purchased from the sources indicated in the supplemental material. Cells used in this study were BRIN-BD11 cells obtained by electrofusion of RINm5F with rat islet cells (24McClenaghan N.H. Barnett C.R. Ah-Sing E. Abdel-Wahab Y.H. O'Harte F.P. Yoon T.W. Swanston-Flatt S.K. Flatt P.R. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1132-1140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The parental BRIN-BD11 cell line, the two clones overexpressing PMCA2wb, and one clone expressing the vector carrying no insert coding for PMCA2 were characterized previously (25Kamagate A. Herchuelz A. Van Eylen F. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2773-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The PMCA was correctly targeted to the plasma membrane as shown by immunohistochemistry and Western blot, and the clones showed Ca2+ responses to K+-induced membrane depolarization, glucose stimulation, sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) inhibition by thapsigargin, and cyclopiazonic acid (CPA). This and a glucose-induced insulin release comparable with that seen in primary β-cells (25Kamagate A. Herchuelz A. Van Eylen F. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2773-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) indicates that this is a good model for primary β-cells. Cells were grown as described previously (24McClenaghan N.H. Barnett C.R. Ah-Sing E. Abdel-Wahab Y.H. O'Harte F.P. Yoon T.W. Swanston-Flatt S.K. Flatt P.R. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1132-1140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Control cells (nontransfected and vector-only transfected cells) and clones were stably transfected with wild type (26Brini M. Marsault R. Bastianutto C. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Cell Calcium. 1994; 16: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) or mutated (10Montero M. Alonso M.T. Carnicero E. Cuchillo-Ibáñez I. Albillos A. García A.G. García-Sancho J. Alvarez J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) aequorin by the use of Lipofectamine. Positive clones were selected through resistance against ZeocinTM (250 μg/ml, Invitrogen) and verified by RT-PCR. mRNA from Aeq-transfected cells was isolated and reverse transcribed as described previously (25Kamagate A. Herchuelz A. Van Eylen F. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2773-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The primers used in this study are described in supplemental Table S1. To reconstitute aequorin, cells expressing wild type aequorin or mutated aequorin were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 5 μm of either WT, n or h coelenterazine in KRB medium at pH 7.4. Cells were placed in the perfusion chamber of a purpose-built thermostatic luminometer (Cairn Research Ltd.) at 22 or 37 °C. The medium used to perfuse the cells was as described previously (25Kamagate A. Herchuelz A. Van Eylen F. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2773-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). At the end of each experiment, cells were permeabilized using 100 μm digitonin in medium containing 10 mm Ca2+. This leads to total consumption of aequorin and allows the calibration of the luminescent signal. Luminescence values were transformed into [Ca2+] according to Brini et al. (27Brini M. Marsault R. Bastianutto C. Alvarez J. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9896-9903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Cell viability, quantitative RT-PCR, and Western blot were performed as described in the supplemental “Materials and Methods.” Mitochondrial morphology was evaluated using MitoTracker® Green. Cells were incubated with the probe (100 nm) during 30 min at 37 °C and examined using fluorescence microscopy. Mitochondrial activity was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay as described previously (22Diaz-Horta O. Kamagate A. Herchuelz A. Van Eylen F. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1815-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). ΔΨm was determined using the fluorescent probe DePsipherTM, a green monomeric compound (510/527 nm), which aggregates in the mitochondria upon membrane polarization, forming an orange-red fluorescent compound (585/590 nm; 28Salvioli S. Ardizzoni A. Franceschi C. Cossarizza A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Cells were trypsinized, incubated in the presence of DePsipher, washed, and processed by flow cytometry. Photomultiplier settings were adjusted to detect green monomers and red aggregates fluorescence on the FL1 (530 nm) and FL2 (585 nm) detectors, respectively. Cells were fixed in fresh 4% paraformaldehyde, rinsed in PBS, permeabilized for 10 min in PBS-Triton X-100 0.1%. Slides were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of polyclonal rabbit anti-Bax (1/1000) and monoclonal mouse anti-cytochrome c (1/1000) and anti-ATP synthase-β (1/1000). Cells were washed and further exposed for 1 h to anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 546 and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated antibodies (1/1000). After washing, cells stained with Hoechst were mounted and photographed using fluorescence microscopy. A minimum of 400 cells was counted in each experimental condition by two independent observers, one of them unaware of sample identity. Data are presented as means ± S.E. Comparisons were performed using Student's t test or analysis of variance with post test with Bonferroni correction. PMCA2 protein expression as determined by Western blot analysis showed a clear band at the expected molecular range (∼135 kDa) that was similar in BRIN-BD11 cells and in rat islet cells (Fig. 1a). PMCA2-overexpressing cells (clones 2 and 5) showed a markedly increased amount of the 135-kDa protein (p < 0.01; Fig. 1b). Densitometric analyses of Western blots further demonstrated that clone 2 expressed significantly higher levels of PMCA2 than clone 5 (Fig. 1c). Quantitative PCR analysis yielded two bands of 298 bp for aequorin and of 589 bp for β-actin, respectively, for cytosolic (Fig. 1d) and mitochondrial aequorin transfected cells (Fig. 1e). The level of aequorin expression was similar in all preparations, except for mitochondrial aequorin in vector-transfected cells where it was lower. Aequorin was used to measure [Ca2+] in the cytosol ([Ca2+]i) and the mitochondria ([Ca2+]m) of BRIN cells. Fig. 2a shows the effect of 5 short (30 s) stimulations with K+ (50 mm) on [Ca2+]i in cells stably expressing cytosolic aequorin, reconstituded with WT coelenterazine and carried out at 22 °C. The stimulations were followed by exposure of the cells to digitonin to permeabilize the plasma membrane to calibrate the luminescent signal (data not shown) (23Brini M. Methods. 2008; 46: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). K+ induced five consecutive increases in [Ca2+]i with a progressive but limited reduction of the signal with time, indicating limited consumption of the dye (dotted line). A similar phenomenon was observed at 37 °C, except that the value of the peaks were slightly lower (supplemental Fig. S1a). The limited consumption of aequorin indicates that the affinity of the complex is adequate and that the increase in [Ca2+]i measured in response to K+ represents the exact change in [Ca2+]i induced by the stimulus. The recombination of aequorin with a more sensitive coelenterazine (h) led to a more important consumption of the dye during the first exposure to K+ during which a [Ca2+]i of 35 μm was reached. (Fig. 2b). The consumption of aequorin also enables it to be used in detecting subcellular heterogeneities in [Ca2+] (10Montero M. Alonso M.T. Carnicero E. Cuchillo-Ibáñez I. Albillos A. García A.G. García-Sancho J. Alvarez J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Indeed, after aequorin consumption in areas of high [Ca2+], the measurements reflect only the behavior of low [Ca2+] areas. This indicates that [Ca2+] up to 35 μm are reached in limited zones of the cytoplasm during cell stimulation. In agreement with this, a concentration of ∼7.37 ± 1.28 μm was reached during the second peak, reflecting the rise of [Ca2+] in low [Ca2+] areas, a value comparable (p > 0.1) with that measured using WT coelenterazine (Fig. 2a). When aequorin was recombined with a low affinity coelenterazine (n), very small signals were observed (data not shown), indicating that the affinity of the complex was too low to measure [Ca2+]i. To measure [Ca2+]m, the low affinity aequorin targeted to the mitochondria was used and recombined with either n or WT coelenterazine and carried out at 22 °C. In both cases, when the cells were exposed to five short K+ stimulations, a major initial increase in [Ca2+]i was observed (Fig. 2, c and d). For the experiment carried out with coelenterazine n, no further increases in [Ca2+]i were observed on further K+ stimulation, whereas small increases were observed when WT coelenterazine was used. This indicates subcellular heterogeneities in [Ca2+]m among mitochondria. Thus, during the first K+ stimulation, some mitochondria show large (mm range) increases in [Ca2+]m with complete consumption of aequorin. Subsequent stimulations only evoke smaller responses (μm range) from other mitochondria. Supplemental Fig. S1b shows that [Ca2+]i data similar to that obtained in nontransfected cells (Fig. 2a) were obtained in vector-transfected cells for wild type aequorin at 22 °C. The first peak [Ca2+]i value averaged 5.64 ± 0.39 μm at 22 °C, a value similar to that observed in nontransfected cells (Fig. 2a, p > 0.8). In clone 2 of PMCA2-transfected cells, the K+-induced increases in [Ca2+]i were reduced by ∼65% (Fig. 3a) compared with control cells. In clone 5 (Fig. 3b), the increases were reduced by 45%. A similar picture was observed at 37 °C (data not shown, p < 0.001). Similar to [Ca2+]i, supplemental Fig. S1c shows that the data for [Ca2+]m obtained in vector-transfected cells at 22 °C were in a similar range to those obtained in nontransfected cells (Fig. 2c). Compared with control cells, PMCA2-transfected cells (Fig. 3, c and d) showed a 82 and 70% decrease in a K+-induced rise in [Ca2+]m in clones 2 and 5, respectively (p < 0.001). Similar data were obtained at 37 °C (data not shown). To examine the effect of glucose on [Ca2+]i and [Ca2+]m, the experiments were carried out at 37 °C, and the exposure to 11.1 mm of the sugar was continuous from min 2 (supplemental Fig. S2). Glucose (11.1 mm) induced in most cases a succession of brief spikes of [Ca2+]i on a flat basal level in control (supplemental Fig. S2a) or vector-transfected cells (supplemental Fig. S3a). In some cases, there was a modest or more important increase in basal level (supplemental Fig. S3, b and c). A quite similar picture is seen in single (dispersed) β-cells (29Herchuelz A. Pochet R. Pastiels C. Van Praet A. Cell Calcium. 1991; 12: 577-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and BRIN-BD11 cells using fura-2 to measure [Ca2+]i (25Kamagate A. Herchuelz A. Van Eylen F. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2773-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In PMCA2-overexpressing cells, the spikes were reduced in number and size (supplemental Fig. S2, c, and d, Fig. S2, c and e), and there were no increases in basal level. The value of the highest spike was 2.30 ± 0.20 μm in control and 1.30 ± 0.17 μm and 1.52 ± 0.20 μm in PMCA2-overexpressing cells, clones 2 and 5, respectively (p < 0.05). Likewise, the number of spikes measured in control cells averaged 4.54 ± 0.62 for the whole period of exposure to glucose, and 1.89 ± 0.31 and 2.13 ± 0.23 in PMCA2-overexpressing cells, clones 2 and 5, respectively (p < 0.001). With respect to [Ca2+]m, spikes also were observed in response to glucose, but compared with [Ca2+]i, their number was low and no elevation in the baseline value was observed (supplemental Fig. S2b). Again, in PMCA2-overexpressing cells, the spikes were reduced in number and size (supplemental Fig. S2, d and f). In clone 2 of PMCA2-overexpressing cells, there were no spikes in 8 of 12 experiments (supplemental Fig. S2d). Altogether, our data show that insulin-secreting cell stimulation generates microdomains of high [Ca2+]i and subcellular heterogeneities in [Ca2+]m among mitochondria and that PMCA2 overexpression depletes cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ stores. We then examined the effect of PMCA2 on cell viability. PMCA2-overexpressing clones displayed an increased rate of basal apoptosis (Fig. 4a). The SERCA inhibitors CPA (50 μm) and thapsigargin (500 nm) increased apoptosis levels in all clones, but this was more marked in PMCA2-overexpressing cells (Fig. 4a). The rate of apoptosis induced by CPA was significantly higher in clone 2 than in clone 5, in line with the higher expression of PMCA2 in clone 2 (Fig. 1, b and c). PMCA2-overexpressing cells also displayed increased levels of caspase-3 cleavage compared with control cells, in the absence or presence of CPA (Fig. 4b). Under these conditions, the rate of caspase-3 cleavage tended to be higher in clone 2 than in clone 5. We then examined whether PMCA2 overexpression induced apoptosis through the ER or mitochondrial pathway. We first examined the expression of several genes and proteins implicated in the UPR. Under basal conditions, PMCA2 overexpression did not affect CHOP expression (Fig. 5a), decreased BiP expression (Fig. 5b), and increased XBP1s expression (Fig. 5c). A 24-h CPA or thapsigargin treatment resulted in a significant increase in CHOP, BiP, and XBP1s expression in all cells (Fig. 5, a–c). The latter increase in CHOP and BiP expression was reduced by ∼30 and 50% in PMCA2-overexpressing cells (both clones), whereas that of XBP1s showed no difference compared with control cells. The expression of the ER Ca2+ chaperone calreticulin was strongly impaired under both basal and treated conditions (Fig. 5e), whereas calnexin expression, which was significantly increased in response to CPA and thapsigargin in control cells, was less affected by the SERCA inhibitors in PMCA2-overexpressing cells (Fig. 5d). The expression of the cytosolic Ca2+-binding protein calbindin was not significantly modified in PMCA2-overexpressing cells, but there was a trend for lower values than in control cells (Fig. 5f). At the protein level, there was no decrease in basal BiP expression, but the increase in expression induced by CPA was partially lost in clone 5 and fully suppressed in the clone 2 of PMCA2-overexpressing cells (Fig. 5g). The decreased CHOP mRNA response to SERCA inhibitors in PMCA-overexpressing cells suggested a decreased PERK-eIF2α pathway activity, and, indeed, we observed that both PERK and eIF2α phosphorylation were decreased in PMCA2-overexpressing cells when exposed to CPA (Fig. 5, h and i). PMCA2 overexpression failed to increase caspase-12 expression under basal condition and to affect its expression activated by CPA or thapsigargin (supplemental Fig. S4a). As a second step, we examined mitochondrial function and morphology. Using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay to measure mitochondrial activity, we observed that under basal conditions, there was no difference between clone 5 and nontransfected cells (supplemental Fig. S4b), whereas mitochondrial activity of clone 2 was reduced by 40%. CPA and thapsigargin reduced mitochondrial activity in all cell preparations (p < 0.001; supplemental Fig. S4b). In control cells and clone 5, the effect of the SERCA inhibitors was modest (−15 to 20%), whereas in clone 2, the SERCA inhibitors more markedly reduced mitochondrial activity (−50%). Mitochondrial alteration was confirmed morphologically using the mitochondria-specific fluorescent probe Mitotracker Green (Fig. 6a). In control cells, the mitochondria displayed a punctated pattern with clear contours that disappeared in the presence of CPA, with the mitochondria now displaying a diffuse appearance. In the absence of CPA, mitochondria of clone 5 cells displayed a diffuse pattern, a phenomenon that was accentuated in clone 2. In the presence of CPA, a diffuse appearance similar to that seen in control cells was seen in clones 2 and 5 (Fig. 6a). Analysis by flow cytometry of live cells stained with DePsipher further revealed that PMCA2 overexpression or CPA treatment significantly reduced ΔΨm as compared with untreated cells (Fig. 6b and Fig. supplemental Fig. S5). Carbonyl cyanide p-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), a protonophore and uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, was used as a positive control. PMCA2-overexpressing cells displayed increased Bax translocation to the mitochondria and cytochrome c release (Fig. 7, a and b and supplemental Fig. S6). Quantitative assessment of the immunofluorescence experiments showed that under basal conditions, Bax translocation and cytochrome c release were increased in clone 2 and 5 compared with control cells. CPA increased both phenomenon but again to a larger extent in PMCA-overexpressing cells. Western blot analysis of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and proapoptotic protein Bax revealed that in PMCA2-overexpressing cells, basal levels of Bax were increased (p < 0.05), whereas there was a tendency toward a decreased basal Bcl-2 expression (Fig. 7c). This resulted in a drastic increase in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in PMCA2-overexpressing cells (Fig. 7c). CPA further increased this ratio, the effect being of larger magnitude in PMCA2-overexpressing than in control cells. During cell culture, clone 2 of PMCA2-overexpressing cells had a significantly longer doubling time than control cells (p < 0.05, supplemental Table S2).FIGURE 7Effect of PMCA2 overexpression on Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, Bax translocation, and cytochrome c release. a, representative field showing live (L) and apoptotic cells (A) stained using anti-cytochrome c, anti-apoptosis-inducible factor (AIF), anti-ATP synthase β, anti-Bax antibodies, Hoechst, and a merged picture of all channels (red, cytochrome c; green, apoptosis-inducible factor; red, ATP synthase; green, Bax; blue, Hoechst). 100× magnification; the scale bar represents 10 μm.

https://openalex.org/W2089543122,"Apolipoprotein M (apoM) plays an important role in the biogenesis and the metabolism of anti-atherogenic HDL particles in plasma and is expressed primarily in the liver and the kidney. We investigated the role of hormone nuclear receptors in apoM gene regulation in hepatic cells. Overexpression via adenovirus-mediated gene transfer and siRNA-mediated gene silencing established that hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF-4) is an important regulator of apoM gene transcription in hepatic cells. apoM promoter deletion analysis combined with DNA affinity precipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that HNF-4 binds to a hormone-response element (HRE) in the proximal apoM promoter (nucleotides -33 to -21). Mutagenesis of this HRE decreased basal hepatic apoM promoter activity to 10% of control and abolished the HNF4-mediated transactivation of the apoM promoter. In addition to HNF-4, homodimers of retinoid X receptor and heterodimers of retinoid X receptor with receptors for retinoic acid, thyroid hormone, fibrates (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor), and oxysterols (liver X receptor) were shown to bind with different affinities to the proximal HRE in vitro and in vivo. Ligands of these receptors strongly induced human apoM gene transcription and apoM promoter activity in HepG2 cells, whereas mutations in the proximal HRE abolished this induction. These findings provide novel insights into the role of apoM in the regulation of HDL by steroid hormones and into the development of novel HDL-based therapies for diseases such as diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and coronary artery disease that affect a large proportion of the population in Western countries."
https://openalex.org/W2085305468,"Microcephalin (MCPH1/BRIT1) is a potential tumour suppressor that localizes to the centrosome, forms ionizing radiation-induced nuclear foci (IRIF) and is involved in the DNA damage checkpoints that ensure genome stability. Here, we report the impact of Mcph1 disruption in the hyper-recombinogenic DT40 cell line. Mcph1(-/-) cells were viable and proliferated at the same rate as wild-type controls. Mcph1-deficient cells had intact G2-to-M checkpoint responses after ionizing radiation (IR) treatment, but showed moderate radiosensitivity. Light and electron microscopy indicated normal centrosome structures in Mcph1 null cells, but IR induced massive amplification of centrosome numbers in the absence of Mcph1. Mcph1 null cells formed γ-H2AX and Rad51 IRIF, but resolved them more slowly than wild-type cells. Mcph1 deficiency caused sustained Chk1 phosphorylation after IR, dysregulating Cdk2 activity. These findings show that Mcph1 controls centrosome numbers after DNA damage, which may indicate a novel tumour suppressive mechanism for microcephalin."
https://openalex.org/W2001545743,"PA1b (pea albumin 1, subunit b) is a small and compact 37-amino acid protein, isolated from pea seeds (Pisum sativum), that adopts a cystine knot fold. It acts as a potent insecticidal agent against major pests in stored crops and vegetables, making it a promising bioinsecticide. Here, we investigate the influence of individual residues on the structure and bioactivity of PA1b. A collection of 13 PA1b mutants was successfully chemically synthesized in which the residues involved in the definition of PA1b amphiphilic and electrostatic characteristics were individually replaced with an alanine. The three-dimensional structure of PA1b was outstandingly tolerant of modifications. Remarkably, receptor binding and insecticidal activities were both dependent on common well defined clusters of residues located on one single face of the toxin, with Phe-10, Arg-21, Ile-23, and Leu-27 being key residues of the binding interaction. The inactivity of the mutants is clearly due to a change in the nature of the side chain rather than to a side effect, such as misfolding or degradation of the peptide, in the insect digestive tract. We have shown that a hydrophobic patch is the putative site of the interaction of PA1b with its binding site. Overall, the mutagenesis data provide major insights into the functional elements responsible for PA1b entomotoxic properties and give some clues toward a better understanding of the PA1b mode of action."
https://openalex.org/W2067066661,"Background The costs and benefits of controlling nosocomial spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria are unknown. Methods We developed a mathematical algorithm to determine cost-effectiveness of infection control programs and explored the dynamical interactions between different epidemiological variables and cost-effectiveness. The algorithm includes occurrence of nosocomial infections, attributable mortality, costs and efficacy of infection control and how antibiotic-resistant bacteria affect total number of infections: do infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria replace infections caused by susceptible bacteria (replacement scenario) or occur in addition to them (addition scenario). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia was used for illustration using observational data on S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) in our hospital (n = 189 between 2001–2004, all being methicillin-susceptible S. aureus [MSSA]). Results In the replacement scenario, the costs per life year gained range from € 45,912 to € 6590 for attributable mortality rates ranging from 10% to 50%. Using € 20,000 per life year gained as a threshold, completely preventing MRSA would be cost-effective in the replacement scenario if attributable mortality of MRSA is ≥21%. In the addition scenario, infection control would be cost saving along the entire range of estimates for attributable mortality. Conclusions Cost-effectiveness of controlling antibiotic-resistant bacteria is highly sensitive to the interaction between infections caused by resistant and susceptible bacteria (addition or replacement) and attributable mortality. In our setting, controlling MRSA would be cost saving for the addition scenario but would not be cost-effective in the replacement scenario if attributable mortality would be <21%."
https://openalex.org/W2072307289,"Many cell lines derived from tumors as well as transformed cell lines are far more sensitive to V-ATPase inhibitors than normal counterparts. The molecular mechanisms underlying these differences in sensitivity are not known. Using global gene expression data, we show that the most sensitive responses to HeLa cells to low doses of V-ATPase inhibitors involve genes responsive to decreasing intracellular iron or decreasing cholesterol and that sensitivity to iron uptake is an important determinant of V-ATPase sensitivity in several cancer cell lines. One of the most sensitive cell lines, melanoma derived SK-Mel-5, over-expresses the iron efflux transporter ferroportin and has decreased expression of proteins involved in iron uptake, suggesting that it actively suppresses cytoplasmic iron. SK-Mel-5 cells have increased production of reactive oxygen species and may be seeking to limit additional production of ROS by iron."
https://openalex.org/W1966346368,"Background For daily syndromic surveillance to be effective, an efficient and sensible algorithm would be expected to detect aberrations in influenza illness, and alert public health workers prior to any impending epidemic. This detection or alert surely contains uncertainty, and thus should be evaluated with a proper probabilistic measure. However, traditional monitoring mechanisms simply provide a binary alert, failing to adequately address this uncertainty. Methods and Findings Based on the Bayesian posterior probability of influenza-like illness (ILI) visits, the intensity of outbreak can be directly assessed. The numbers of daily emergency room ILI visits at five community hospitals in Taipei City during 2006–2007 were collected and fitted with a Bayesian hierarchical model containing meteorological factors such as temperature and vapor pressure, spatial interaction with conditional autoregressive structure, weekend and holiday effects, seasonality factors, and previous ILI visits. The proposed algorithm recommends an alert for action if the posterior probability is larger than 70%. External data from January to February of 2008 were retained for validation. The decision rule detects successfully the peak in the validation period. When comparing the posterior probability evaluation with the modified Cusum method, results show that the proposed method is able to detect the signals 1–2 days prior to the rise of ILI visits. Conclusions This Bayesian hierarchical model not only constitutes a dynamic surveillance system but also constructs a stochastic evaluation of the need to call for alert. The monitoring mechanism provides earlier detection as well as a complementary tool for current surveillance programs."
https://openalex.org/W2094084374,"Regulated intramembranous proteolysis of the amyloid-beta precursor protein by the gamma-secretase yields amyloid-beta, which is the major component of the amyloid plaques found in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the APP intracellular domain (AID). In vitro studies have involved AID in apoptosis and gene transcription. In vivo studies, which utilize transgenic mice expressing AID in the forebrain, only support a role for AID in apoptosis but not gene transcription.Here, we have further characterized several lines of AID transgenic mice by crossing them with human Tau-bearing mice, to determine whether over-expression of AID in the forebrain provokes AD-like pathologic features in this background. We have found no evidence that AID overexpression induces AD-like characteristics, such as activation of GSK-3beta, hyperphosphorylation of Tau and formation of neurofibrillary pathology.Overall, these data suggest that AID transgenic mice do not represent a model that reproduces the overt biochemical and anatomo-pathologic lesions observed in AD patients. They can still be a valuable tool to understand the role of AID in enhancing the cell sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli, whose pathways still need to be characterized."
https://openalex.org/W2153845245,"Background Studies on political ideology and health have found associations between individual ideology and health as well as between ecological measures of political ideology and health. Individual ideology and aggregate measures such as political regimes, however, were never examined simultaneously. Methodology/Principal Findings Using adjusted logistic multilevel models to analyze data on individuals from 29 European countries and Israel, we found that individual ideology and political regime are independently associated with self-rated health. Individuals with rightwing ideologies report better health than leftwing individuals. Respondents from Eastern Europe and former Soviet republics report poorer health than individuals from social democratic, liberal, Christian conservative, and former Mediterranean dictatorship countries. In contrast to individual ideology and political regimes, country level aggregations of individual ideology are not related to reporting poor health. Conclusions/Significance This study shows that although both individual political ideology and contextual political regime are independently associated with individuals' self-rated health, individual political ideology appears to be more strongly associated with self-rated health than political regime."
https://openalex.org/W2044072791,"Bacterial acyl carrier protein (ACP) is a highly anionic, 9 kDa protein that functions as a cofactor protein in fatty acid biosynthesis. Escherichia coli ACP is folded at neutral pH and in the absence of divalent cations, while Vibrio harveyi ACP, which is very similar at 86% sequence identity, is unfolded under the same conditions. V. harveyi ACP adopts a folded conformation upon the addition of divalent cations such as Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) and a mutant, A75H, was previously identified that restores the folded conformation at pH 7 in the absence of divalent cations. In this study we sought to understand the unique folding behavior of V. harveyi ACP using NMR spectroscopy and biophysical methods. The NMR solution structure of V. harveyi ACP A75H displays the canonical ACP structure with four helices surrounding a hydrophobic core, with a narrow pocket closed off from the solvent to house the acyl chain. His-75, which is charged at neutral pH, participates in a stacking interaction with Tyr-71 in the far C-terminal end of helix IV. pH titrations and the electrostatic profile of ACP suggest that V. harveyi ACP is destabilized by anionic charge repulsion around helix II that can be partially neutralized by His-75 and is further reduced by divalent cation binding. This is supported by differential scanning calorimetry data which indicate that calcium binding further increases the melting temperature of V. harveyi ACP A75H by ∼20 °C. Divalent cation binding does not alter ACP dynamics on the ps-ns timescale as determined by (15)N NMR relaxation experiments, however, it clearly stabilizes the protein fold as observed by hydrogen-deuterium exchange studies. Finally, we demonstrate that the E. coli ACP H75A mutant is similarly unfolded as wild-type V. harveyi ACP, further stressing the importance of this particular residue for proper protein folding."
https://openalex.org/W1965732309,"Background Mixed breeding systems with extended clonal phases and weak sexual recruitment are widespread in nature but often thought to impede the formation of discrete evolutionary clusters. Thus, cyclic parthenogens, such as cladocerans and rotifers, could be predisposed to “species problems” and a lack of discrete species. However, species flocks have been proposed for one cladoceran group, Eubosmina, where putative species are sympatric, and there is a detailed paleolimnological record indicating a Holocene age. These factors make the Eubosmina system suitable for testing the hypotheses that extended clonal phases and weak sexual recruitment inhibit speciation. Although common garden experiments have revealed a genetic component to the morphotypic variation, the evolutionary significance of the morphotypes remains controversial. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study, we tested the hypothesis of a single polymorphic species (i.e., mixing occurs but selection maintains genes for morphology) in four northern European lakes where the morphotypes coexist. Our evidence is based on nuclear DNA sequence, mitochondrial DNA sequence, and morphometric analysis of coexisting morphotypes. We found significant genetic differentiation, genealogical exclusivity, and morphometric differentiation for coexisting morphotypes. Conclusions We conclude that the studied morphotypes represent a group of young species undergoing speciation with apparent reproductive barriers despite coexistence in the freshwater pelagic zone."
https://openalex.org/W2074048238,"The Sno oncogene (Snoo or dSno in Drosophila) is a highly conserved protein and a well-established antagonist of Transforming Growth Factor-β signaling in overexpression assays. However, analyses of Sno mutants in flies and mice have proven enigmatic in revealing developmental roles for Sno proteins. Thus, to identify developmental roles for dSno we first reconciled conflicting data on the lethality of dSno mutations. Then we conducted analyses of wing development in dSno loss of function genotypes. These studies revealed ectopic margin bristles and ectopic campaniform sensilla in the anterior compartment of the wing blade suggesting that dSno functions to antagonize Wingless (Wg) signaling. A subsequent series of gain of function analyses yielded the opposite phenotype (loss of bristles and sensilla) and further suggested that dSno antagonizes Wg signal transduction in target cells. To date Sno family proteins have not been reported to influence the Wg pathway during development in any species. Overall our data suggest that dSno functions as a tissue-specific component of the Wg signaling pathway with modest antagonistic activity under normal conditions but capable of blocking significant levels of extraneous Wg, a role that may be conserved in vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2080803245,"Background Somatic hypermutation introduces base substitutions into the rearranged and expressed immunoglobulin (Ig) variable regions to promote immunity. This pathway requires and is initiated by the Activation Induced Deaminase (AID) protein, which deaminates cytidine to produce uracils and UG mismatches at the Ig genes. Subsequent processing of uracil by mismatch repair and base excision repair factors contributes to mutagenesis. While selective for certain genomic targets, the chromatin modifications which distinguish hypermutating from non-hypermutating loci are not defined. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we show that AID-targeted loci in mammalian B cells contain ubiquitinated chromatin. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis of a constitutively hypermutating Burkitt's B cell line, Ramos, revealed the presence of monoubiquitinated forms of both histone H2A and H2B at two AID-associated loci, but not at control loci which are expressed but not hypermutated. Similar analysis using LPS activated primary murine splenocytes showed enrichment of the expressed VH and Sγ3 switch regions upon ChIP with antibody specific to AID and to monoubiquitinated H2A and H2B. In the mechanism of mammalian hypermutation, AID may interact with ubiquitinated chromatin because confocal immunofluorescence microscopy visualized AID colocalized with monoubiquitinated H2B within discrete nuclear foci. Conclusions/Significance Our results indicate that monoubiquitinated histones accompany active somatic hypermutation, revealing part of the histone code marking AID-targeted loci. This expands the current view of the chromatin state during hypermutation by identifying a specific nucleosome architecture associated with somatic hypermutation."
https://openalex.org/W2021608115,"Pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) assembly is a critical part of the mechanism that controls the initiation of DNA replication, and ATP binding and hydrolysis by multiple pre-RC proteins are essential for pre-RC assembly and activation. Here, we demonstrate that Adk1p (adenylate kinase 1 protein) plays an important role in pre-RC assembly in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Isolated from a genetic screen, adk1(G20S) cells with a mutation within the nucleotide-binding site were defective in replication initiation. adk1Δ cells were viable at 25 °C but not at 37°C. Flow cytometry indicated that both the adk1-td (temperature-inducible degron) and adk1(G20S) mutants were defective in S phase entry. Furthermore, Adk1p bound to chromatin throughout the cell cycle and physically interacted with Orc3p, whereas the Adk1(G20S) protein had a reduced ability to bind chromatin and Orc3p without affecting the cellular ATP level. In addition, Adk1p associated with replication origins by ChIP assay. Finally, Adk1-td protein depletion prevented pre-RC assembly during the M-to-G(1) transition. We suggest that Adk1p regulates ATP metabolism on pre-RC proteins to promote pre-RC assembly and activation."
https://openalex.org/W1999303189,"Background Real-Time quantitative PCR is an important tool in research and clinical settings. Here, we describe two new approaches that broaden the scope of real-time quantitative PCR; namely, run-internal mini standard curves (RIMS) and direct real-time relative quantitative PCR (drqPCR). RIMS are an efficient alternative to traditional standard curves and provide both run-specific and target-specific estimates of PCR parameters. The drqPCR enables direct estimation of target ratios without reference to conventional control samples. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we compared RIMS-based drqPCR with classical quantifications based on external standard curves and the “comparative Ct method”. Specifically, we used a raw real-time PCR dataset as the basis for more than two-and-a-half million simulated quantifications with various user-defined conditions. Compared with classical approaches, we found that RIMS-based drqPCR provided superior precision and comparable accuracy. Conclusions/Significance The obviation of referencing to control samples is attractive whenever unpaired samples are quantified. This may be in clinical and research settings; for instance, studies on chimerism, TREC quantifications, copy number variations etc. Also, lab-to-lab comparability can be greatly simplified."
