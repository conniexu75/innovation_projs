https://openalex.org/W1980168725,"Matthew Stephens and Xiang Zhou report an efficient exact method for accounting for population stratification and relatedness in genome-wide association analyses. Their method, genome-wide efficient mixed-model association (GEMMA) is implemented in freely available software. Linear mixed models have attracted considerable attention recently as a powerful and effective tool for accounting for population stratification and relatedness in genetic association tests. However, existing methods for exact computation of standard test statistics are computationally impractical for even moderate-sized genome-wide association studies. To address this issue, several approximate methods have been proposed. Here, we present an efficient exact method, which we refer to as genome-wide efficient mixed-model association (GEMMA), that makes approximations unnecessary in many contexts. This method is approximately n times faster than the widely used exact method known as efficient mixed-model association (EMMA), where n is the sample size, making exact genome-wide association analysis computationally practical for large numbers of individuals."

The human ESC-derived optic cup is much larger than the mouse ESC-derived one, presumably reflecting the species differences. The neural retina in human ESC culture is thick and spontaneously curves in an apically convex manner, which is not seen in mouse ESC culture. In addition, human ESC-derived neural retina grows into multilayered tissue containing both rods and cones, whereas cone differentiation is rare in mouse ESC culture. The accumulation of photoreceptors in human ESC culture can be greatly accelerated by Notch inhibition. In addition, we show that an optimized vitrification method enables en bloc cryopreservation of stratified neural retina of human origin. This storage method at an intermediate step during the time-consuming differentiation process provides a versatile solution for quality control in large-scale preparation of clinical-grade retinal tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2146374090,"Magnus Nordborg and colleagues report a multi-locus mixed-model method (MLMM) for genome-wide association studies in structured populations. Their simulations show that MLMM offers increased power and a reduced false discovery rate, and applications to both human and Arabidopsis thaliana data sets identify new associations and allelic heterogeneity. Population structure causes genome-wide linkage disequilibrium between unlinked loci, leading to statistical confounding in genome-wide association studies. Mixed models have been shown to handle the confounding effects of a diffuse background of large numbers of loci of small effect well, but they do not always account for loci of larger effect. Here we propose a multi-locus mixed model as a general method for mapping complex traits in structured populations. Simulations suggest that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of power as well as false discovery rate. We apply our method to human and Arabidopsis thaliana data, identifying new associations and evidence for allelic heterogeneity. We also show how a priori knowledge from an A. thaliana linkage mapping study can be integrated into our method using a Bayesian approach. Our implementation is computationally efficient, making the analysis of large data sets (n > 10,000) practicable."

However, there is still debate about whether iPSCs are functionally equivalent to ESCs. This question should be answered only by science, not by politics or business."
https://openalex.org/W2079471807,"Posttranslational histone modifications are important for gene regulation, yet the mode of propagation and the contribution to heritable gene expression states remains controversial. To address these questions, we developed a chromatin in vivo assay (CiA) system employing chemically induced proximity to initiate and terminate chromatin modifications in living cells. We selectively recruited HP1α to induce H3K9me3-dependent gene silencing and describe the kinetics and extent of chromatin modifications at the Oct4 locus in fibroblasts and pluripotent cells. H3K9me3 propagated symmetrically and continuously at average rates of ~0.18 nucleosomes/hr to produce domains of up to 10 kb. After removal of the HP1α stimulus, heterochromatic domains were heritably transmitted, undiminished through multiple cell generations. Our data enabled quantitative modeling of reaction kinetics, which revealed that dynamic competition between histone marking and turnover, determines the boundaries and stability of H3K9me3 domains. This framework predicts the steady-state dynamics and spatial features of the majority of euchromatic H3K9me3 domains over the genome."

In this perspective, we integrate recent anatomical data on the organization of the two main neurogenic niches in the adult brain, the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) and the subgranular zone (SGZ), with signaling pathways that control the behavior of NSCs. NSCs in the adult brain stretch into physiologically distinct compartments of their niche. We propose how adult NSCs' morphology may allow these cells to integrate multiple signaling pathways arising from unique locations of their niche. Major developments in the neural stem cell (NSC) field in recent years provide new insights into the nature of the NSC niche.

NSCs in the adult brain stretch into physiologically distinct compartments of their niche. We propose how adult NSCs' morphology may allow these cells to integrate multiple signaling pathways arising from unique locations of their niche. The fascinating process of developmental tissue growth and morphogenesis is orchestrated by stem cells that contribute to organ maintenance (tissue homeostasis) and repair in the adult organism. For many years, the brain, with its extraordinary structure, connectivity, complexity, and diversity of cell types, was considered an exception; neural stem cells (NSCs) were thought to be present only during development when this amazing organ is put together. This view began to change with the discovery of adult neurogenesis (for historical perspective, see [Altman, 2011Altman J. The Discovery of Adult Mammalian Neurogenesis.in: Seki T. Sawamoto K.

These discoveries led to a shift in concepts, not only about the potential of the postnatal brain to engage in processes only thought possible in development, but also about the nature of NSCs themselves. In the adult mammalian brain, NSCs are retained in two regions, the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) and the subgranular zone (SGZ). The V-SVZ, in the walls of the lateral ventricles (Figure 1), contains a subpopulation of cells with astroglial properties (B1 cells) that function as NSCs, giving rise to intermediate progenitors (IPCs or transient amplifying progenitors, also known as C cells), which in rodents predominantly generate neurons destined for the olfactory bulb (OB) (for review see [Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009Kriegstein A. Alvarez-Buylla A. The glial nature of embryonic and adult neural stem cells.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 32: 149-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar]). In the SGZ at the interface of the hilus and dentate gyrus (Figure 2), NSCs also correspond to astroglial cells, which have a radial process that traverses the granule cell layer. These cells, known by multiple names—radial astrocytes (Seri et al., 2001Seri B. García-Verdugo J.M. McEwen B.S. Alvarez-Buylla A.

In both germinal zones, NSCs and IPCs correspond to the primary and secondary progenitors, respectively. Many studies analyzing proliferation do not distinguish between primary or secondary progenitors, and in these cases we will refer to both collectively as progenitor cells.Figure 2Schematic of the Different Domains of SGZ Radial AstrocytesShow full captionThe upper panel shows a frontal cross-section of the adult mouse brain showing the hippocampal formation (left). The insert shows a higher magnification indicating the location of the dentate gyrus (right).The lower panel shows cellular composition of the adult dentate gyrus and domains of SGZ radial astrocytes. Radial astrocytes (RA, also known as type 1 cells, blue) give rise to IPCs (green), which progressively (via IPC1 and IPC2 [type 2a and type 2b cells]) differentiate into immature granule cells (IGCs [type 3 cells], red). Mature granule cells (GCs, brown) send an axon parallel to the SGZ into the hilus, whereas their dendrites branch into the molecular layer (ML). Radial astrocytes are polarized cells with their cell body in the SGZ, a long main shaft that traverses through the granule cell layer (GCL) and then branches diffusely in the inner molecular layer (IML). Here we subdivide radial astrocytes into three domains. Domain I (proximal, dark blue) faces the hilus, harbors a primary cilium, and contacts with blood vessels (BV, purple) and, through lateral processes, neighboring radial astrocytes. Factors derived from blood, endothelial cells, and neighboring radial astrocytes act on NSCs within this domain. Domain II (intermediate, medium blue) contains the cell body and the main shaft. This part of the cell interacts closely with IPCs and GCs; this domain allow specific cell-cell interactions of NSCs with their progeny and detection of local neural activity and signaling from GCs. Domain III (distal, light blue) contacts other glial cells, axons, and synaptic terminals in the IML; NSCs may detect levels of neural activity from Mossy cells and other neurons within this compartment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The upper panel shows a frontal cross-section of the adult mouse brain showing the hippocampal formation (left).

The adult V-SVZ NSCs in the walls of the lateral ventricles differ significantly in location and structure from those in the adult hippocampal SGZ. Unlike B1 cells in the V-SVZ, which like many embryonic neural stem cells lie next to the ventricle and have processes that contact the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), dentate radial astrocytes are found deeper in the brain parenchyma, away from the walls of the ventricle and surrounded by neurons and other glial cells. Yet, B1 cells and radial astrocytes share some key features. Both express astroglial markers and have ultrastructural characteristics of astrocytes (Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009Kriegstein A. Alvarez-Buylla A. The glial nature of embryonic and adult neural stem cells.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 32: 149-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). Most importantly, they both have long processes that allow them to reach into compartments of the niche far away from where the cell bodies reside (Figures 1 and 2). Through some of these processes, NSCs make contact with the vasculature, which in both germinal regions plays key roles in their regulation. Therefore, NSCs are in contact with unique compartments of their niche, and this may determine whether they remain quiescent or are induced to proliferate. A large number of studies during the last decade provide important new insights about the nature of adult NSCs and IPCs and about the microenvironment that surrounds them. In this perspective, we aim to connect the recent literature providing insights into the anatomy of the adult neurogenic niches with the emerging knowledge of factors that control the behavior of NSCs (Table 1). Organization of adult V-SVZ and SGZ NSCs into distinct domains may ultimately provide an integrative perspective on how adult NSCs are regulated (Figures 1 and 2).Table 1Summary of Factors Involved in the Regulation of Progenitor Cell Behavior and Putative Domains Where They May ActB1 cell domainFactorEffect on progenitor cellsReferencesI.

V-SVZ B1 cells are immersed in a remarkably diverse microenvironment. The highly specialized architecture within this niche implicates both cell-cell interactions and soluble factors as important regulators of NSC behavior. B1 cells retain the basic apical-basal polarity of their predecessors, radial glia. Similar to radial glia and neuroepithelial cells, most, if not all, B1 cells contact the ventricle through small, specialized apical processes that contain a single primary cilium (Mirzadeh et al., 2008Mirzadeh Z.

https://openalex.org/W2126268407,"The encoding and storage of experience by the hippocampus is essential for the formation of episodic memories and the transformation of individual experiences into semantic structures such as maps and schemas. The rodent hippocampus compresses ongoing experience into repeating theta sequences, but the factors determining the content of theta sequences are not understood. Here we first show that the spatial paths represented by theta sequences in rats extend farther in front of the rat during acceleration and higher running speeds and begin farther behind the rat during deceleration. Second, the length of the path is directly related to the length of the theta cycle and the number of gamma cycles in it. Finally, theta sequences represent the environment in segments or 'chunks'. These results imply that information encoded in theta sequences is subject to powerful modulation by behavior and task variables. Furthermore, these findings suggest a potential mechanism for the cognitive 'chunking' of experience."

https://openalex.org/W2075573465,"Cell migration on planar surfaces is driven by cycles of actin protrusion, integrin-mediated adhesion, and myosin-mediated contraction; however, this mechanism may not accurately describe movement in 3-dimensional (3D) space. By subjecting cells to restrictive 3D environments, we demonstrate that physical confinement constitutes a biophysical stimulus that alters cell morphology and suppresses mesenchymal motility in human breast carcinoma (MDA-MB-231). Dorsoventral polarity, stress fibers, and focal adhesions are markedly attenuated by confinement. Inhibitors of myosin, Rho/ROCK, or β1-integrins do not impair migration through 3-μm-wide channels (confinement), even though these treatments repress motility in 50-μm-wide channels (unconfined migration) by ≥50%. Strikingly, confined migration persists even when F-actin is disrupted, but depends largely on microtubule (MT) dynamics. Interfering with MT polymerization/depolymerization causes confined cells to undergo frequent directional changes, thereby reducing the average net displacement by ≥80% relative to vehicle controls. Live-cell EB1-GFP imaging reveals that confinement redirects MT polymerization toward the leading edge, where MTs continuously impact during advancement of the cell front. These results demonstrate that physical confinement can induce cytoskeletal alterations that reduce the dependence of migrating cells on adhesion-contraction force coupling. This mechanism may explain why integrins can exhibit reduced or altered function during migration in 3D environments."
https://openalex.org/W1988932163,"In most adult humans, hepatitis B is a self-limiting disease leading to life-long protective immunity, which is the consequence of a robust adaptive immune response occurring weeks after hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Notably, HBV-specific T cells can be detected shortly after infection, but the mechanisms underlying this early immune priming and its consequences for subsequent control of viral replication are poorly understood. Using primary human and mouse hepatocytes and mouse models of transgenic and adenoviral HBV expression, we show that HBV-expressing hepatocytes produce endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated endogenous antigenic lipids including lysophospholipids that are generated by HBV-induced secretory phospholipases and that lead to activation of natural killer T (NKT) cells. The absence of NKT cells or CD1d or a defect in ER-associated transfer of lipids onto CD1d results in diminished HBV-specific T and B cell responses and delayed viral control in mice. NKT cells may therefore contribute to control of HBV infection through sensing of HBV-induced modified self-lipids."

Although the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) has long been implicated in reward-guided decision making, its exact role in this process has remained an unresolved issue. Here we show that, in accordance with models of decision making, vmPFC concentrations of GABA and glutamate in human volunteers predict both behavioral performance and the dynamics of a neural value comparison signal.

Mammalian IL2RG orthologs are typically located on the X chromosome; in humans, IL2RG mutations result in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID) in which T and NK cells are absent or profoundly reduced in number, while B cells are numerically normal (or increased) but functionally impaired (Noguchi et al., 1993bNoguchi M.

Unfortunately, phenotypic differences exist between XSCID humans and Il2rg null mice, including a pronounced numerical B cell reduction in the latter. Two dog breeds develop SCID caused by Il2rg mutations (Felsburg et al., 1999Felsburg P.J. Hartnett B.J. Henthorn P.S. Moore P.F. Krakowka S. Ochs H.D.

Molecular pathology of severe combined immunodeficiency in mice, horses, and dogs.Vet.

In contrast, the pig more closely resembles humans regarding anatomy, hematology, physiology, size, and longevity. By enabling long-term follow-up, pig models will permit the evaluation of human cancer and stem cell transplantation over clinically relevant time frames. We here describe disruption of the porcine Il2rg gene to generate SCID pigs, their phenotypic characterization, and proof-of-principle transplantation studies. A conventional positive-negative selection Il2rg gene targeting vector (TV) (Figure S1A) enabled the functional inactivation of porcine Il2rg by removing exon 6 (Kanai et al., 1999Kanai N. Yanai F. Hirose S. Nibu K. Izuhara K. Tani T. Kubota T. Mitsudome A. A G to A transition at the last nucleotide of exon 6 of the gamma c gene (868G→A) may result in either a splice or missense mutation in patients with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency.Hum. Genet. 1999; 104: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Following fetal fibroblast transfection, selection, and PCR screening, 1 of 3 TV-targeted cell lines was expanded for nuclear transfer (Table S1). Even after screening, PCR-positive colonies often contain a substantial proportion of nontargeted cells (not shown) that would result in a corresponding proportion of nontargeted cloned pigs following nuclear transfer. To ensure that all clones harbored a targeted Il2rg locus, we adopted a serial cloning strategy. Nine embryonic day 35 (E35) or E39 nuclear transfer embryos were collected and screened by PCR and Southern blotting. PCR (not shown) and Southern blotting (Figure S1B) revealed that six contained the genomic configuration predicted for a single-targeted Il2rg allele. Fibroblasts were cultured from one targeted embryo and used in secondary nuclear transfer to produce 31 cloned F0 piglets; all were females heterozygously targeted at their Il2rg genes as judged by PCR (not shown) and Southern blotting (Figure S1C). Fourteen of the 31 were stillborn and 3 of the 17 live-born died neonatally of unknown cause(s) (Table S1). Ten survivors died from pneumonia and severe arthritis (five were euthanized) between postnatal day 7 (P7) and P70. The remaining four (#5, 9, 15 and 20) survived for >1 year. Stillborn and neonatal fatalities often had spleens with hypoplastic lymphoid aggregations (Figure S1D). Most (24/31, 77%) had undetectable or severely hypoplastic thymi (Figure S1E and Table S2). F0 clones that died within 10 weeks also lacked detectable thymi and had few, if any, T cells either in their spleens or circulating (Figures S1F and S1G). In contrast, levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in four long-lived F0 lines were comparable to those of WT controls. Analysis of peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cell (PBMC) RNA corroborated this: Il2rg, CD4, and CD8 transcript levels were reduced in athymic Il2rg+/− clones that perished relative to respective levels in long-lived clones and WT controls (Figure S1H). Thus, most Il2rg+/− clones exhibited SCID-like phenotypes, albeit that they had one WT allele. We attributed this high proportion to aberrant X-inactivation, a previously observed epigenetic cloning phenotype (Senda et al., 2004Senda S. Wakayama T. Yamazaki Y. Ohgane J. Hattori N. Tanaka S.

Expression of X-linked genes in deceased neonates and surviving cloned female piglets.Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2008; 75: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, epigenetic cloning phenotypes are corrected by germline transmission (Shimozawa et al., 2002Shimozawa N. Ono Y. Kimoto S. Hioki K. Araki Y. Shinkai Y. Kono T. Ito M. Abnormalities in cloned mice are not transmitted to the progeny.Genesis. 2002; 34: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To confirm this and isolate the Il2rg+/− phenotype, we analyzed progeny derived by fertilization from Il2rg+/− cloned female #9. Female Il2rg+/− #9 inseminated with WT sperm produced 19 F1 (12 m, 7 f) offspring, and of these F1 offspring, two Il2rg+/− females produced 21 F2 (13 m, 8 f) when inseminated with WT sperm. Autopsies of representative F1 and F2 progeny revealed that, as expected, all Il2rg−/Y males had undetectable thymi, whereas Il2rg+/− females had thymi of normal size (Figure 1A and Table S3). Hematological parameters in PB exhibited a significantly (p = 0.0041) reduced white blood cell (WBC) count in F1 Il2rg−/Y males (6.4 ± 1.6 × 103/μl, n = 5) compared to WT controls (17.8 ± 2.3 × 103/μl, n = 6), while hemoglobin levels and platelet counts were unaffected (Figure 1B). F1 Il2rg+/− females and WT littermates yielded comparable PB T, NK, and B cell numbers, indicative of intact acquired and innate immunity (Figures 1C, 1E, and 1F). In contrast, Il2rg−/Y males harbored significantly reduced PB T cells (Il2rg−/Y males, 1.5% ± 1.0%; Il2rg+/Y males, 57.3% ± 4.3%; n = 4 each, p < 0.0001) and NK cells (Il2rg−/Y males, 0.1% ± 0.1%; Il2rg+/Y males, 3.6% ± 1.1%; n = 4 each, p = 0.0162) (Figures 1D, 1E, and 1F). In proportion to the PB reductions, Il2rg−/Y spleens exhibited significant numerical reductions of T cells (Il2rg−/Y males, 2.3% ± 1.1%; Il2rg+/Y males, 13.0% ± 1.4%; n = 4 each, p = 0.0011) and NK cells (Il2rg−/Y males, 0.1% ± 0.0%; Il2rg+/Y males, 0.8% ± 0.2%; n = 4 each, p = 0.0162) (Figures 1E and 1F). B cells and myeloid cells accounted for the majority of CD45+ leukocytes in Il2rg−/Y males, indicating that their immune deficiency was limited to T and NK cell lineages. The presence in Il2rg−/Y males of CD33+ myeloid cells with both mononuclear and polynuclear properties suggests the differentiation of both granulocyte lineages and antigen-presenting cells, including monocytes and dendritic cells (Figures 1C and 1D). We next evaluated humoral immune status in Il2rg-targeted pigs (Figure 1G). Serum IgG and IgA levels were high at 1 week (P7) and decreased gradually from 3 to 5 weeks in Il2rg−/Y (males), WT littermates, and Il2rg+/− female controls. After 7 weeks, IgG and IgA levels re-elevated in WT controls, while levels of both remained low in Il2rg−/Y males. Serum IgM was low at 1 week and increased gradually in controls but remained low in Il2rg−/Y males. Because both IgG and IgA at 1 week of age are entirely transferred via the colostrum in pigs, these results indicate that there had been no de novo Ig production in Il2rg−/Y males after weaning at 4 weeks. Impaired antibody production by Il2rg−/Y B cells is likely due to the absence of critical CD4+ T helper cells. Consistent with their impaired immunity, all F1 Il2rg−/Y males became systemically ill in the conventional housing conditions used, while F1 Il2rg+/− females appeared healthy. Collectively, this shows that when produced by conventional breeding, Il2rg−/Y F1 males, but not Il2rg+/− females, present SCID phenotypes. SCID-like phenotypes observed in many Il2rg+/− female clones are attributable to aberrant, nonrandom X-inactivation during somatic cell cloning. Following germline transmission, Il2rg-targeted phenotypes resembled those of X-linked SCID in other species, with greatly reduced T and NK cell development and function (Cao et al., 1995Cao X.

We next performed proof-of-principle allogeneic transplantation experiments using Il2rg-targeted pigs as recipients. Preliminary conditioning with orally administered fludarabine and busulfan produced significantly decreased WBC and platelet counts (not shown), which might promote the engraftment of transplanted cells. However, 2 of 6 Il2rg−/Y males died within 2 weeks postadministration, suggesting that the regimen was lethal for some piglets. Bone marrow (BM) cells from WT siblings were intravenously transplanted to four P11-12 Il2rg−/Y males with (#113, #115) or without (#605, #610) conditioning. Ubiquitously GFP-expressing (#184) BM cells (Watanabe et al., 2005Watanabe S. Iwamoto M. Suzuki S. Fuchimoto D. Honma D. Nagai T. Hashimoto M. Yazaki S. Sato M. Onishi A. A novel method for the production of transgenic cloned pigs: electroporation-mediated gene transfer to non-cultured cells and subsequent selection with puromycin.Biol. Reprod. 2005; 72: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) were transferred to a Il2rg−/Y male (#122) with conditioning. Recipient #115 died 15 days after BM transfer (BMT), possibly due to conditioning toxicity, and recipient #605 died of presumptive pneumonia (not shown) 140 days posttransplantation; nevertheless, it survived longer than Il2rg−/Y controls without BMT, which died within 54 days. The remaining three recipients have survived >516 days (#610) and >321 days (#113 and #122) posttransplantation, with PB T cell populations exhibiting similar dynamics (Figures 2A and 2E ); T cell counts increased ∼6 weeks posttransplantation and remained high. Following early variability, PB B cell counts equilibrated at detectably low levels. The exception was #113, in which B cell counts were clearly higher than those of WT controls until 16 weeks posttransplantation, gradually decreasing thereafter to a level comparable with other recipients (Figures 2B and 2F). Compared to WT controls, recipient #610 PB contained similar T cell counts and a diminished but substantial number of B and NK cells 42 weeks posttransplantation (Figures 2A, 2B, and 2I). Similar profiles were observed in #113 and 122 (Figures 2E and 2F; not shown for NK). Surviving recipients and WT littermates had comparable granulocyte and monocyte numbers (Figures 2C, 2D, 2G, and 2H). The provenance of immune cells in surviving recipients was examined by microsatellite marker analysis of genomic DNA from the ear, whole blood, and sorted T, B, and NK cells. GFP fluorescence of immune cells was also detected in the case of #122 (Figures 2E–2H and 2J). Lymphoid lineages were totally of donor origin in all recipients. Myeloid lineages were mainly of donor origin in #113 and of mixed donor/host origin in #122 and #610. Thus, our conditioning regimen enabled donor-derived myeloid lineage reconstitution in #113, but not #122. All surviving recipient PB contained IgG, IgA, and IgM (Figure 2K), albeit at varying levels, strongly suggesting that humoral immunity had been reconstituted and that donor-derived recipient B cells produced antibodies. Thus, allogeneic BM transplantation to Il2rg−/Y SCID pigs reproducibly resulted in enduring functional donor cell engraftment and reconstituted acquired immunity. Assuming that the allogeneic model reported here reflects the behavior of cells transplanted from different species, SCID pigs promise to become a valuable tool in xenogeneic transplantation studies of human stem cells, such as hematopoietic, embryonic, and induced pluripotent stem cells (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaka T. Tomoda K. Yamanaka S. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from adult human fibroblasts by defined factors.Cell. 2007; 131: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14964) Google Scholar). In particular, they promise to serve as platforms for the evaluation of therapeutic outcomes over several years, possibly after further genetic manipulation such as disruption of recombination activating genes 1 or 2 (Rag1, Rag2), which play critical roles in both cellular and humoral immunity (Shinkai et al., 1992Shinkai Y. Rathbun G. Lam K.P. Oltz E.M. Stewart V. Mendelsohn M. Charron J. Datta M. Young F.

Preliminary xenotransplantation of human BM cells to porcine Il2rg−/Y recipients in the absence of preconditioning permitted limited engraftment, underscoring the importance of further genetic manipulation, and optimized preconditioning (not shown). The porcine SCID model described here therefore represents an essential step toward the translational evaluation of human stem cells for long-term clinical applications.

https://openalex.org/W1995860861,"During Wallerian degeneration of Drosophila axons, Draper and Crk/Mbc/dCed-12 signaling non-redundantly promote clearance of axonal debris. Draper signaling is required early to activate glial responses to axonal injury, whereas Crk/Mbc/dCed-12 are dispensable for glial activation, but are essential at the phagocytic step for internalization and degradation of axonal debris. Glial cells efficiently recognize and clear cellular debris after nervous system injury to maintain brain homeostasis, but pathways governing glial responses to neural injury remain poorly defined. We identify the Drosophila melanogaster guanine nucleotide exchange factor complex Crk/Mbc/dCed-12 and the small GTPase Rac1 as modulators of glial clearance of axonal debris. We found that Crk/Mbc/dCed-12 and Rac1 functioned in a non-redundant fashion with the Draper transmembrane receptor pathway: loss of either pathway fully suppressed clearance of axonal debris. Draper signaling was required early during glial responses, promoting glial activation, which included increased Draper and dCed-6 expression and extension of glial membranes to degenerating axons. In contrast, the Crk/Mbc/dCed-12 complex functioned at later phases, promoting glial phagocytosis of axonal debris. Our work identifies new components of the glial engulfment machinery and shows that glial activation, phagocytosis of axonal debris and termination of responses to injury are genetically separable events mediated by distinct signaling pathways."

More than 50 mutations at the terminal exon of the NPM1 gene have been identified so far in acute myeloid leukemia; the mutated proteins are aberrantly and stably localized in the cytoplasm due to high destabilization of the NPM1 C-terminal domain and the appearance of a new nuclear export signal. We have shown previously that the 70-residue NPM1 C-terminal domain (NPM1-C70) is able to bind with high affinity a specific region at the c-MYC gene promoter characterized by parallel G-quadruplex structure.

These data were used to calculate an experimentally restrained molecular docking model for the complex. The NPM1-C70 terminal three-helix bundle binds the G-quadruplex DNA at the interface between helices H1 and H2 through electrostatic interactions with the G-quadruplex phosphate backbone.

Acute myeloid leukemia with mutated NPM1: diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic perspectives.Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2009; 21: 573-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). NPM1 is a highly mobile protein capable of shuttling between nucleus, nucleoplasm, and cytoplasm, although the bulk of the protein is mainly localized in the nucleoli (3Falini B. Gionfriddo I.

The NPM1 gene, overexpressed in a number of solid tumors, has been proposed as a marker for colon, gastric, ovarian, and prostate carcinomas (1Grisendi S. Mecucci C. Falini B. Pandolfi P.P. Nucleophosmin and cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). NPM1 is also frequently modified in hematopoietic tumors. For instance, in both lymphoid and myeloid disorders, NPM1 chromosomal translocations lead to the production of several oncogenic fusion proteins (1Grisendi S. Mecucci C. Falini B. Pandolfi P.P. Nucleophosmin and cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NPM1 is the most frequently mutated gene in acute myeloid leukemia, accounting for 35% of all cases (2Falini B. Sportoletti P. Martelli M.P.

Mutations involve duplication or insertion of small base sequences at the last exon of the gene and lead to a C-terminal domain that has acquired four additional residues compared with wild type and a completely different sequence in the last seven. The nucleolar localization signal is compromised with the loss of one or both of the two critical tryptophan residues, and a third nuclear export signal appears. Moreover, the mutated domain is largely destabilized or totally unfolded (5Grummitt C.G. Townsley F.M. Johnson C.M. Warren A.J. Bycroft M.

Both the destabilization of NPM1 C-terminal domain and the presence of an additional nuclear export signal contribute to the aberrant and stable localization of the mutated protein in the cytoplasm, which is the salient feature of this type of leukemia (2Falini B. Sportoletti P. Martelli M.P. Acute myeloid leukemia with mutated NPM1: diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic perspectives.Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2009; 21: 573-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The NPM1 C-terminal domain is known to bind both duplex and single-stranded DNA as well as RNA with no sequence specificity and with a preference for single-stranded nucleic acids (8Hingorani K.

This picture was suggestive of a protein playing mainly a chaperone and transport role for preribosomal RNA particles (1Grisendi S. Mecucci C. Falini B. Pandolfi P.P. Nucleophosmin and cancer.Nat.

Int. 2011; 2011: 195209Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Recently, however, it was shown that NPM1 binds a specific G-rich sequence at the superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) gene promoter and participates in the transcriptional activation of this gene (10Xu Y. Fang F. Dhar S.K. St Clair W.H. Kasarskis E.J. St Clair D.K. The role of a single-stranded nucleotide loop in transcriptional regulation of the human sod2 gene.J. Biol.

We also investigated the domain boundaries necessary for DNA binding and demonstrated that a 17-residue segment preceding the C-terminal three-helix bundle (5Grummitt C.G. Townsley F.M. Johnson C.M.

Lo Sterzo C. Di Matteo A. Falini B. Giardina B. Brunori M. Nucleophosmin C-terminal leukemia-associated domain interacts with G-rich quadruplex forming DNA.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 37138-37149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). G-quadruplex DNA is gaining increasing attention because it is highly represented (especially in selected regions of the genome, including telomeres and gene promoters) and is involved in a number of regulatory processes (12Huppert J.L. Balasubramanian S. Prevalence of quadruplexes at the human genome.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2908-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar, 13Huppert J.L. Four-stranded nucleic acids: structure, function and targeting of G-quadruplexes.Chem. Soc. Rev. 2008; 37: 1375-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Interestingly, G-quadruplex regions are frequently found at oncogene promoters, whereas a reduced frequency at tumor suppressor genes is observed (14Qin Y. Hurley L.H. Structures, folding patterns, and functions of intramolecular DNA G-quadruplexes found in eukaryotic promoter regions.Biochimie. 2008; 90: 1149-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). For instance, a well characterized G-quadruplex-forming sequence present at the NHEIII region of the c-MYC oncogene promoter (15Siddiqui-Jain A. Grand C.L. Bearss D.J. Hurley L.H. Direct evidence for a G-quadruplex in a promoter region and its targeting with a small molecule to repress c-MYC transcription.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The interaction with proteins that stabilize the G-quadruplex fold, such as nucleolin, causes a marked down-regulation of the gene (18González V. Guo K. Hurley L. Sun D.

Toxicol. 2010; 50: 111-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), whereas the opposite happens through the interaction with G-quadruplex-unwinding proteins, such as NMR-H2 (20Thakur R.K.

Given its selective localization at oncogene promoters and telomeres, G-quadruplex DNA is an attractive target for tumor treatment, and the structures of several G-quadruplex regions alone and in complex with drugs have been reported (21Neidle S. The structures of quadruplex nucleic acids and their drug complexes.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2009; 19: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Conversely, although the list of proteins that bind G-quadruplex DNA is rapidly increasing and the importance of such interactions for a variety of physiological processes is now clear, very little structural information is available concerning the molecular recognition mechanism of complex formation (22Sissi C. Gatto B. Palumbo M. The evolving world of protein-G-quadruplex recognition: a medicinal chemist's perspective.Biochimie. 2011; 93: 1219-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To the best of our knowledge, only two structures are available: (i) thrombin in complex with a synthetic aptamer that folds as a G-quadruplex (23Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K.P. Ferrara J.D. Sadler J.E. Tulinsky A. The structure of α-thrombin inhibited by a 15-mer single-stranded DNA aptamer.J. Biol.

Here we present the high resolution NMR structure of the NPM1 DNA-binding domain and analyze its interaction with the G-quadruplex DNA from the NHEIII region of the c-MYC promoter. We show (i) that the contact surface involves largely amino acids belonging to helices H1 and H2 of the terminal three-helix bundle and (ii) that a well defined G-quadruplex region is recognized through several electrostatic interactions with the phosphate backbone. The N-terminal lysine-rich region of the NPM1 C-terminal domain, which we show to be unstructured, does not participate directly in the interacting surface although it proved necessary to increase affinity (11Federici L.

The data presented below unveil the interaction surface between G-quadruplex DNA and NPM1 and may inspire the search for small molecules or aptamers aimed at restoring a native-like fold in NPM1 leukemic mutants. The oligonucleotides used in this study are Pu27 of sequence 5′-TGGGGAGGGTGGGGAGGGTGGGGAAGG-3′ and Pu24I of sequence 5′-TGAGGGTGGIGAGGGTGGGGAAGG-3′. Pu27 and Pu24I were purchased from Primm (Milan, Italy) and Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA), respectively, and were both HPLC-purified. Lyophilized oligos were dissolved in 20 mm phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl and annealed. For annealing, oligos were heated to 95 °C for 15 min and then allowed to gently cool down to room temperature overnight. After annealing, the parallel G-quadruplex assembly of both oligos was assessed by inspecting CD spectra collected with a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter. A DNA construct for residues 225–294 of human NPM1 was cloned into pET28+(a) vector and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. For isotope enrichment, cells were grown in a minimal medium with (15NH4)2SO4 and [13C]glucose. Protein expression was induced with 1.0 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 20 °C, and cells were harvested after 16 h. NPM1-C70 was purified as reported previously (11Federici L. Arcovito A. Scaglione G.L. Scaloni F. Lo Sterzo C. Di Matteo A. Falini B. Giardina B. Brunori M. Nucleophosmin C-terminal leukemia-associated domain interacts with G-rich quadruplex forming DNA.J. Biol.

The hexahistidine tag at the N terminus of the protein was thrombin-cleaved and removed by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column. The 1H, 13C, and 15N resonance frequencies of NPM1-C70 were assigned using all classical NMR experiments. NMR experiments used for resonance assignment and structure calculations were performed on 13C,15N-labeled NPM1-C70 sample containing 10% D2O. NMR spectra were collected at 298 K, processed using standard Bruker software (TOPSPIN 2.1), and analyzed with CARA (25Keller R. The Computer Aided Resonance Assignment Tutorial. CANTINA Verlag, Goldau, Switzerland2004Google Scholar). Structure calculations were performed with the software package UNIO using as input the amino acid sequence; the chemical shift lists; and three 1H-1H NOE experiments, two-dimensional NOESY, three-dimensional 13C-edited NOESY, and three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY, recorded at 900 MHz with a mixing time of 100 ms.

https://openalex.org/W1980648455,"Biosynthesis of the mycobacterial cell wall relies on the activities of many enzymes, including several glycosyltransferases (GTs). The polymerizing galactofuranosyltransferase GlfT2 (Rv3808c) synthesizes the bulk of the galactan portion of the mycolyl-arabinogalactan complex, which is the largest component of the mycobacterial cell wall. We used x-ray crystallography to determine the 2.45-Å resolution crystal structure of GlfT2, revealing an unprecedented multidomain structure in which an N-terminal β-barrel domain and two primarily α-helical C-terminal domains flank a central GT-A domain. The kidney-shaped protomers assemble into a C(4)-symmetric homotetramer with an open central core and a surface containing exposed hydrophobic and positively charged residues likely involved with membrane binding. The structure of a 3.1-Å resolution complex of GlfT2 with UDP reveals a distinctive mode of nucleotide recognition. In addition, models for the binding of UDP-galactofuranose and acceptor substrates in combination with site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic studies suggest a mechanism that explains the unique ability of GlfT2 to generate alternating β-(1→5) and β-(1→6) glycosidic linkages using a single active site. The topology imposed by docking a tetrameric assembly onto a membrane bilayer also provides novel insights into aspects of processivity and chain length regulation in this and possibly other polymerizing GTs."
https://openalex.org/W2099092415,"Activation of blood coagulation factor V (FV) is a key reaction of hemostasis. FV circulates in plasma as an inactive procofactor, and proteolytic removal of a large central B-domain converts it to an active cofactor (FVa) for factor Xa (FXa). Here we show that two short evolutionary conserved segments of the B-domain, together termed the procofactor regulatory region, serve an essential autoinhibitory function. This newly identified motif consists of a basic (963-1008) and an acidic (1493-1537) region and defines the minimal sequence requirements to maintain FV as a procofactor. Our data suggest that dismantling this autoinhibitory region via deletion or proteolysis is the driving force to unveil a high affinity binding site(s) for FXa. These findings document an unexpected sequence-specific role for the B-domain by negatively regulating FV function and preventing activity of the procofactor. These new mechanistic insights point to new ways in which the FV procofactor to cofactor transition could be modulated to alter hemostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2140194161,"The sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump (SERCA) and its regulator, phospholamban, are essential components of cardiac contractility. Phospholamban modulates contractility by inhibiting SERCA, and this process is dynamically regulated by β-adrenergic stimulation and phosphorylation of phospholamban. Herein we reveal mechanistic insight into how four hereditary mutants of phospholamban, Arg9 to Cys, Arg9 to Leu, Arg9 to His, and Arg14 deletion, alter regulation of SERCA. Deletion of Arg14 disrupts the protein kinase A recognition motif, which abrogates phospholamban phosphorylation and results in constitutive SERCA inhibition. Mutation of Arg9 causes more complex changes in function, where hydrophobic substitutions such as cysteine and leucine eliminate both SERCA inhibition and phospholamban phosphorylation, whereas an aromatic substitution such as histidine selectively disrupts phosphorylation. We demonstrate that the role of Arg9 in phospholamban function is multifaceted: it is important for inhibition of SERCA, it increases the efficiency of phosphorylation, and it is critical for protein kinase A recognition in the context of the phospholamban pentamer. Given the synergistic consequences on contractility, it is not surprising that the mutants cause lethal, hereditary dilated cardiomyopathy.

Given the synergistic consequences on contractility, it is not surprising that the mutants cause lethal, hereditary dilated cardiomyopathy. In cardiac muscle, β-adrenergic stimulation increases contractility and accelerates relaxation. These effects are due to the activation of PKA, which targets a variety of downstream contractile and calcium-handling systems. One such target is phospholamban (PLN), 3The abbreviations used are: PLNphospholambanSERCAsarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPaseDCMdilated cardiomyopathySRsarcoplasmic reticulumPKA-ccatalytic subunit of PKA. a regulator of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump (SERCA) (1Tada M. Kirchberger M.A. Katz A.M. Regulation of calcium transport in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase.Recent Adv. Stud. Cardiac Struct. Metab. 1976; 9: 225-239PubMed Google Scholar). Following an appropriate physiological cue, PKA phosphorylates PLN and increases calcium reuptake by SERCA into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Although the role of SERCA and PLN in muscle relaxation is clear, evidence from animal models suggests that most of the inotropic effects on contractility also originate from SR calcium handling (2Morgan J.P. Abnormal intracellular modulation of calcium as a major cause of cardiac contractile dysfunction.N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 325: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). This is because dynamic control of myocardial contraction-relaxation involves fine tuning SERCA inhibition and SR calcium levels. SERCA function depends on the available pool of inhibitory PLN, which in turn depends on the cytosolic calcium concentration and the oligomeric and phosphorylation states of PLN (1Tada M.

Two such examples of mutations include R9C and Arg14 deletion (R14del) in the cytoplasmic domain of PLN (9Haghighi K. Kolokathis F. Gramolini A.O. Waggoner J.R. Pater L. Lynch R.A. Fan G.C.

In addition, R9L and R9H are newly identified mutations, although their linkage to heart failure has not been fully established (12Medeiros A. Biagi D.G. Sobreira T.J. de Oliveira P.S. Negrão C.E. Mansur A.J. Krieger J.E. Brum P.C. Pereira A.C. Mutations in the human phospholamban gene in patients with heart failure.Am. Heart J. 2011; 162: 1088-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These hereditary mutations are somewhat surprising because Arg9 and Arg14 were not previously considered essential residues of PLN, and overall the cytoplasmic domain of PLN makes a small contribution to SERCA inhibition (16Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. Phospholamban regulates the Ca2+-ATPase through intramembrane interactions.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21726-21731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, cysteine substitution of Arg9 is thought to result in loss of inhibitory function and trapping of PKA, whereas deletion of Arg14 alters the PKA recognition motif of PLN. The resultant effects on SERCA function and SR calcium stores are causative in the development and progression of DCM. To gain mechanistic insight into R9C, R9L, R9H, and R14del, we created missense and deletion mutants in the cytoplasmic domain of PLN and characterized their effects on phosphorylation by PKA in the absence and presence of SERCA. For the disease-associated mutants, R14del resulted in a slight loss of inhibitory function and a complete loss of phosphorylation, R9H resulted in normal inhibitory function and a complete loss of phosphorylation, and R9L and R9C resulted in a complete loss of both inhibitory function and phosphorylation. Any changes to the PKA recognition motif of PLN (Arg13-Arg14-Ala15-Ser16) (3Simmerman H.K. Collins J.H. Theibert J.L. Wegener A.D. Jones L.R. Sequence analysis of phospholamban.

That is, deletion of Arg14 would be expected to render PLN unresponsive to β-adrenergic stimulation and constitutively active as an inhibitor of SERCA. In contrast, mutagenesis of Arg9 revealed multiple effects on SERCA regulation (18Ceholski D.K. Trieber C.A. Young H.S. Hydrophobic imbalance in the cytoplasmic domain of phospholamban is a determinant for lethal dilated cardiomyopathy.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 16521-16529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). All nonconservative mutations of Arg9 significantly decreased the inhibitory activity of PLN, as well as its ability to be phosphorylated by PKA. Further insight was gained through the mutagenesis of PKA, which revealed that Glu203 and Asp241 were required for efficient phosphorylation of PLN. By virtue of an electrostatic interaction with Arg9 of PLN, these PKA residues increase the efficiency of phosphorylation and allow PKA to recognize PLN in the context of the pentamer. To summarize our findings, Arg9 of PLN plays a multifaceted role in cardiac contractility: it is important for SERCA inhibition, it increases the efficiency of PLN phosphorylation, and it allows PKA to recognize nonphosphorylated PLN monomers in the context of a partially phosphorylated pentamer.

For phosphorylation assays, a “fast” reconstitution was performed to increase the lipid to protein ratio of the co-reconstituted proteoliposomes (25Young H.S. Rigaud J.L. Lacapère J.J. Reddy L.G.

The final molar ratios were 1 SERCA to 4.5 PLN to 900 lipids. For all proteoliposomes used herein, the concentrations of SERCA and PLN were determined by quantitative SDS-PAGE (26Young H.S.

PLN was first phosphorylated in detergent solution by the catalytic subunit of PKA (PKA-c) (Sigma-Aldrich) in the absence of SERCA as previously described (22Trieber C.A. Douglas J.L. Afara M. Young H.S. The effects of mutation on the regulatory properties of phospholamban in co-reconstituted membranes.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3289-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with a molar stoichiometry of 1 PKA-c to 1000 PLN. PLN was phosphorylated with ATP spiked with [γ-32P]ATP (∼0.1 μCi/μl). All other components of the reaction were identical to published protocols (22Trieber C.A. Douglas J.L. Afara M. Young H.S. The effects of mutation on the regulatory properties of phospholamban in co-reconstituted membranes.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3289-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The reactions were stopped by the addition of TCA, incubated on ice for 10 min, washed several times with 10% TCA and water, and counted in 1 ml of liquid scintillant (Perkin-Elmer) for 1 min in a scintillation counter. All of the values were corrected by subtracting background counts per minute from samples containing no PKA. PLN was also phosphorylated by PKA-c in co-reconstituted proteoliposomes in the presence of SERCA (50 μl) as previously described (22Trieber C.A. Douglas J.L. Afara M. Young H.S. The effects of mutation on the regulatory properties of phospholamban in co-reconstituted membranes.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3289-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with a molar stoichiometry of 1 PKA-c to 50 PLN. The ATP was spiked with [γ-32P]ATP (∼0.1 μCi/μl), and the samples were treated as described above. All of the values were corrected for PLN concentration in proteoliposomes as determined by gel quantitation (ImageQuant software; GE Healthcare). The wild-type bovine PKA catalytic subunit cloned into the pET3a vector (EMD Chemicals, San Diego, CA) was purchased from Biomatik (Cambridge, Canada). Codons were optimized for expression in Escherichia coli and a six-histidine tag was added on the N terminus of the PKA gene. The plasmid was transformed into E. coli (DE3) pLysS cells (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA). Cultures were grown at 37 °C in noninducible minimal media (MDAG-135) (27Studier F.W. Protein production by auto-induction in high density shaking cultures.Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4127) Google Scholar) until A600 = 0.6 and then induced with IPTG (0.5 mm) for 6 h at 22 °C. Recombinant PKA was purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) under native conditions according to the protocol provided in the Qiaexpressionist (Qiagen). After elution, recombinant PKA was concentrated (∼1 mg/ml) and dialyzed into 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol, 50% glycerol, and 1 mm EDTA. This protocol was repeated for the E203A and D241A mutants of PKA. The purity and concentration of each mutant was assessed by SDS-PAGE, and all activity values were corrected for it. The kinetic values for the PKA proteins were acquired from a [γ-32P]ATP phosphorylation filter binding assay that has been previously described (28Hastie C.J. McLauchlan H.J. Cohen P. Assay of protein kinases using radiolabeled ATP. A protocol.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 968-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Kemptide was purchased from Promega, and PLN cytoplasmic peptides were synthesized by Biomatik Corporation. Kemptide and wild-type PLN peptide concentrations were varied from 1.0 to 400 μm for wild-type PKA and 1 to 700 μm for E203A and D241A PKA; R9C PLN peptide was only varied from 1 to 300 μm for wild-type and mutant PKAs because of solubility problems. Km and Vmax were obtained by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation (v = Vmax[S]/([S]+Km)), and all of the data were plotted as substrate concentration (μm) versus activity (μm/min). Detergent-solubilized wild-type and R9S PLN (0.15 mm) were phosphorylated for 0, 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min as described above under phosphorylation assays (molar ratio of 1 PKA to 1000 PLN). Although the root cause of DCM can be a single site mutation in PLN, heart failure is an incredibly complex process that impairs many aspects of calcium homeostasis and the cellular proteome, including decreased levels of SERCA (29Meyer M. Schillinger W. Pieske B. Holubarsch C. Heilmann C. Posival H. Kuwajima G. Mikoshiba K. Just H. Hasenfuss G.

Res. 1994; 75: 434-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, it is important to separate initiating events from the complex array of secondary pathological consequences that define heart failure. Hereditary missense mutations, such as those found in PLN, provide valuable insights into disease-associated changes in calcium homeostasis. In the case of PLN mutants (R9C, R9H, R9L, and R14del), SERCA dysregulation accounts for the earliest stages of disease, which ultimately leads to reduced pumping force, cardiovascular remodeling, and heart failure. For this reason, the goal of the present study was to mechanistically define the relationship between PLN mutation and the regulation of SERCA that underlies the development of DCM. To do this, we used reconstituted proteoliposomes containing SERCA and PLN under conditions that mimic native SR membrane (22Trieber C.A. Douglas J.L. Afara M. Young H.S. The effects of mutation on the regulatory properties of phospholamban in co-reconstituted membranes.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3289-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 25Young H.S. Rigaud J.L. Lacapère J.J. Reddy L.G. Stokes D.L. How to make tubular crystals by reconstitution of detergent-solubilized Ca2+-ATPase.Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2545-2558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Functional characterization of the proteoliposomes relied on measurements of the calcium-dependent ATPase activity of SERCA in the presence of wild-type or mutant PLN. R9C and R9L resulted in complete loss of function, R9H was indistinguishable from wild type, and R14del resulted in partial loss of function (Fig. 1, A and B, and Table 1). To mimic heterozygous conditions, mixtures of wild-type and mutant PLN (1:1 ratio) were reconstituted with SERCA. Because of increased hydrophobicity of the cytoplasmic domain of PLN, R9C, R9L, and R14del appeared to have a dominant negative effect on SERCA function (Table 1 and Ref. 18Ceholski D.K. Trieber C.A.

Chem. 2012; 287: 16521-16529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because R9H was a conservative mutation indistinguishable from wild-type PLN, it would not be considered a dominant negative regulator of SERCA.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters from Hill plots and phosphorylation of disease-associated PLN mutationsVmaxKCaPhosphorylationaPercentage of phosphorylation compared with wild-type PLN of detergent-solubilized mutant PLN or wild-type/mutant mixtures of PLN.μmol min−1 mg−1μm%SERCAbThe kinetic data were taken from Ceholski et al.

Open table in a new tab The cytoplasmic domain of PLN is the target of regulation via the β-adrenergic pathway, and disruption of this process would be expected to influence the development and progression of DCM. Although no known mutations affect the site of phosphorylation by PKA (Ser16), Arg14 is part of the PKA recognition motif, and Arg9 is a more peripheral, upstream residue that may also be involved in recognition by PKA (31Moore M.J. Adams J.A. Taylor S.S. Structural basis for peptide binding in protein kinase A. Role of glutamic acid 203 and tyrosine 204 in the peptide-positioning loop.J. Biol.

Contrary to the location of these residues, R14del was initially reported to be phosphorylated, whereas R9C was reported to abrogate phosphorylation (9Haghighi K. Kolokathis F. Gramolini A.O.

Dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure caused by a mutation in phospholamban.Science. 2003; 299: 1410-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Therefore, our goal was to understand the relationship between disease-associated mutations and phosphoregulation of PLN. Under conditions that resulted in efficient phosphorylation of wild-type PLN (data not shown), we observed no detectable PKA-mediated phosphorylation of R9C, R9L, or R14del and minimal phosphorylation of R9H (Fig. 1C). This was confirmed with SERCA ATPase activity measurements, which revealed minimal changes in SERCA inhibition following PKA treatment of the PLN mutants (Table 1). This led us to consider whether the mutation of these particular residues (Arg9 and Arg14) or the nature of the mutations (Cys, Leu, or His substitution or deletion) was the key determinant for the defect in phosphorylation. To address this, we first tested the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of alanine mutants of residues Lys3 to Thr17 in the absence of SERCA (Fig. 2). Under conditions where wild-type PLN rapidly reached complete phosphorylation, most of the alanine substitutions between residues 3 and 17 resembled the native protein. However, three mutants (R9A, R13A, and R14A) exhibited clear defects in phosphorylation with S16A serving as a negative control. The results for Arg13 and Arg14 were anticipated given their placement in the PKA recognition motif and prior characterization by mutagenesis (32Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. Amino acids Glu2 to Ile18 in the cytoplasmic domain of phospholamban are essential for functional association with the Ca2+-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The result for Arg9 of PLN was unexpected, given that it was not previously reported to be a determinant for PKA-mediated phosphorylation (17Fujii J. Maruyama K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. Expression and site-specific mutagenesis of phospholamban. Studies of residues involved in phosphorylation and pentamer formation.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12950-12955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PLN in the absence of SERCA allowed unhindered interaction with PKA for optimal phosphorylation, yet this did not take into account the SERCA-PLN interaction that normally occurs in cardiac SR. To examine this, proteoliposomes containing SERCA in the presence of wild-type or mutant PLN were phosphorylated by PKA. To distinguish between SERCA-specific effects on PLN phosphorylation versus molecular crowding that could limit the accessibility of PKA, the reconstitution method was altered to incorporate a higher lipid to protein ratio in the proteoliposomes (25Young H.S.

Activity of this factor is regulated in large part by control of its subcellular location. In the absence of oxidants, Yap1 is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Upon oxidant challenge, Yap1 accumulates rapidly in the nucleus where it activates expression of genes required for oxidative stress tolerance such as the thioredoxin TRX2. Here, we demonstrate that Yap1 degradation is accelerated in response to oxidative stress. Yap1 is folded differently depending on the oxidant used to induce its nuclear localization but is degraded similarly, irrespective of its folded status.

Degradation requires the ability of the protein to bind DNA and a domain in the amino-terminal region of the factor. Inhibition of the proteasome prevents Yap1 turnover. Screening a variety of mutants involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis demonstrated an important role for the nuclear ubiquitin ligase Not4 in Yap1 degradation. Not4 was found to bind to Yap1 in an oxidant-stimulated fashion. The Candida albicans Yap1 homologue (Cap1) also was degraded after oxidant challenge.

ROS can directly damage macromolecules of biological importance and also trigger loss of a physiologically tolerable intracellular redox environment. Cells have developed a variety of means to sense and respond to threats caused by increases in ROS levels. One of the best studied redox-activated transcription factors is the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Yap1 protein (see Refs. 1Moye-Rowley W.S.

This Yap1-dependent transcriptional network is stimulated in response to several different ROS-generating compounds such as H2O2 and diamide. One of the major routes of Yap1-oxidant regulation occurs at the level of control of the nuclear localization of this transcription factor (6Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A. Regulation of yAP-1 nuclear localization in response to oxidative stress.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1710-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). In the absence of excessive ROS production, Yap1 is found almost exclusively in the cytoplasm. Upon oxidant challenge, Yap1 rapidly moves to and accumulates in the nucleus where it induces its characteristic transcriptional program. This regulated nuclear localization is accomplished by controlling the rate at which Yap1 is exported from the nucleus, a process catalyzed by the nuclear exportin Crm1 (7Kuge S. Toda T. Iizuka N.

Two clusters of cysteine residues, referred to cysteine-rich domains (CRD), are essential for the regulation of Yap1 nuclear export in response to redox challenge. Cysteine residues in the C-terminal CRD can form two pairs of disulfide bonds with cysteine residues in the N-terminal CRD (n-CRD) (9Coleman S.T. Epping E.A. Steggerda S.M. Moye-Rowley W.S.

This dually disulfide-bonded form of Yap1 is only formed upon challenge with the oxidant H2O2. H2O2-specific oxidative folding also requires the presence of the Yap1-binding protein Ybp1 and the glutathione peroxidase homologue Gpx3 (11Delaunay A. Pflieger D. Barrault M.B. Vinh J.

Cell. 2004; 3: 318-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This H2O2-folded form of Yap1 is required to allow recruitment of a specific transcriptional mediator component called Rox3 to key Yap1 target genes such as the thioredoxin TRX2 (14Kuge S. Jones N. YAP1-dependent activation of TRX2 is essential for the response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to oxidative stress by hydroperoxides.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 15Gulshan K.

Only when the properly folded form of Yap1 arrives at TRX2 can the appropriate antioxidant response be induced to detoxify H2O2. Induction of oxidative stress by exposure to oxidants such as diamide or diethylmaleate triggers the same nuclear accumulation of Yap1 but has a number of different molecular features. First, these oxidants seem to act directly on Yap1 to oxidize cysteine residues in the C-terminal CRD that in turn block Crm1 interaction with Yap1 (7Kuge S. Toda T. Iizuka N. Nomoto A. Crm1 (XpoI)-dependent nuclear export of the budding yeast transcription factor yAP-1 is sensitive to oxidative stress.Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 8Yan C. Lee L.H. Davis L.I. Crm1p mediates regulated nuclear export of a yeast AP-1-like transcription factor.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7416-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Second, no disulfide bond formation is required for diamide- or diethylmaleate-induced nuclear localization of Yap1. Finally, no additional protein factors are required for Yap1 nuclear accumulation in response to these oxidants. Loss of cysteines in the C-terminal CRD either by amino acid substitution or deletion leads to Yap1 being constitutively trapped in the nucleus with an accompanying elevation in diamide and diethylmaleate resistance. These same constitutively nuclearly localized Yap1 derivatives fail to support wild-type H2O2 tolerance due to their inability to be properly folded in response to this oxidant. Previous experiments from several laboratories (6Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A.

We determined that this reduction was due to an increase in the degradation of Yap1 mutants that were trapped genetically in the nucleus. Examination of the turnover rate of wild-type Yap1 indicated that this protein was strongly destabilized following oxidative stress onset. In this work, we demonstrate that Yap1 is degraded following recruitment to target gene promoters in a manner dependent on the ubiquitin ligase Not4.

Similarly, low-copy number plasmids expressing either wild-type or C629A mutant forms of Yap1 were produced earlier (9Coleman S.T. Epping E.A. Steggerda S.M. Moye-Rowley W.S. Yap1p activates gene transcription in an oxidant-specific fashion.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8302-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The pNT13 plasmid producing a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged allele of YAP1 was characterized previously (9Coleman S.T. Epping E.A. Steggerda S.M. Moye-Rowley W.S.

Using PCR mutagenesis, a K67A allele of YAP1 was introduced into this same GFP-Yap1-expressing plasmid to ensure that this mutant form of Yap1 was localized to the nucleus in response to oxidative stress. A BY4742 strain containing a not4Δ::kanMX6 allele was rederived by preparing the not4Δ::kanMX6 allele by PCR and transforming this cassette into fresh BY4742 cells. This newly derived not4Δ::kanMX6 behaved no differently from the original BY4742 isolate, reducing any concerns about genetic changes in addition to the loss of NOT4 (data not shown). To generate strains carrying the tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag fusion (21Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Séraphin B.

These cultures (50 ml each) were treated with 1 mm H2O2, 1 mm diethylmaleate, 1 mm diamide, or left untreated. The cultures were incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Cells were quickly washed with water and transferred to fresh media containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide with or without oxidant as appropriate. For the 0-h time point, 10 ml of culture was immediately taken out after the addition of cycloheximide. Cultures were further allowed to incubate at 30 °C with shaking at 250 rpm. Further samples were collected at the indicated time periods and processed by centrifugation, followed by washing the pellets with 20% TCA and frozen until ready for further steps. The pellets from different time periods were then resuspended in 200 μl of 12.5% TCA and lysed with glass beads by vigorous shaking on a Tomy shaker for 20 min. The extracts were collected and another 200 μl of 12.5% TCA was added to glass beads and vortexed for 1 min. Extracts were pooled (total volume ∼ 400 μl) and spun down at full speed for 5 min. Pellets were washed with ice-cold acetone and air-dried. 100 μl of 1× Laemmli buffer (0.0625 m Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.002% bromphenol blue dye), and 50 μl of 1 m Tris base were added to the pellets. Samples (40 μl) were then subjected to Western blot analysis, using anti-Yap1 antibody (1:7000 dilution) (22Wemmie J.A. Steggerda S.M. Moye-Rowley W.S.

For performing co-immunoprecipitation assays to determine the identity of E3 ligase responsible for degradation of Yap1, spheroplasts were prepared and subjected to oxidant exposure. In brief, 100 ml of cells was harvested at an A600 of 1.0 and washed with spheroplast solution I (1 m sorbitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 30 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm K2HPO4), and resuspended in spheroplast solution II (1 m sorbitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 30 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm K2HPO4, 25 mm sodium succinate, pH 5.5) containing oxylyticase, and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h on a shaker at 100 rpm. After chilling on ice, cell suspensions were overlaid on a sucrose cushion (20 mm HEPES, 1.2 m sucrose, 0.02% sodium azide) and pelleted by centrifuging at 4000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. A portion of the resulting spheroplasts was treated with 1 mm H2O2 for 25 min at room temperature, suspended in ICB (lysis) buffer (100 mm potassium acetate, 50 mm KCl, 20 mm PIPES, 200 mm sorbitol, pH 6.8). Protein extracts were clarified by centrifuging lysates at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The lysates were incubated with anti-TAP antibody for 4 h at 4 °C on a rotator. Protein A-agarose beads, washed and resuspended in the same buffer, were then added to the lysate and incubated for 2 h for immunoprecipitation. Finally, the beads were washed and collected by centrifugation, and immunoprecipitated proteins were recovered by adding 2× Laemmli buffer (0.125 m Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.004% bromphenol blue dye). Protein samples were then loaded on 10% polyacrylamide gel and probed with anti-Yap1 antibodies or anti-TAP antibody. Activation of Yap1-dependent transcriptional regulation occurs primarily due to localization of this transcription factor to the nucleus (see Refs. 1Moye-Rowley W.S.

Several mutants exhibiting constitutive nuclear localization also were observed to accumulate at reduced steady-state levels when evaluated by Western blotting (6Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7908-7914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To determine whether the decreased accumulation seen in terms of steady-state levels could be explained by enhanced proteolysis, a cycloheximide chase assay was carried out. A strain lacking the Yap1 protein (yap1Δ) was transformed with an empty vector plasmid or the same plasmid expressing with a wild-type or C629A form of Yap1. Conversion of the cysteine at position 629 to alanine led to the resulting mutant form of Yap1 being constitutively localized to the nucleus, irrespective of oxidant challenge (9Coleman S.T. Epping E.A. Steggerda S.M. Moye-Rowley W.S. Yap1p activates gene transcription in an oxidant-specific fashion.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8302-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These transformants were grown to mid-log phase (0 h), 100 μg/ml cycloheximide was added, and incubation was continued for 4 h. Equal aliquots of cells from these time points were used to prepare whole cell protein extracts that were then analyzed for Yap1 levels using a polyclonal antiserum directed against this transcription factor (22Wemmie J.A. Steggerda S.M. Moye-Rowley W.S. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae AP-1 protein discriminates between oxidative stress elicited by the oxidants H2O2 and diamide.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7908-7914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The C629A form of Yap1 was nearly completely degraded over this time interval (Fig. 1A), whereas wild-type Yap1 did not exhibit significant degradation. A major difference between these two forms of Yap1 occurs at the level of nuclear localization. The wild-type factor resides in the cytoplasm in the absence of oxidative stress but translocates rapidly to the nucleus upon oxidant exposure (6Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A. Regulation of yAP-1 nuclear localization in response to oxidative stress.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1710-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). To determine whether the wild-type Yap1 protein exhibited oxidant-triggered instability, wild-type cells were analyzed by the cycloheximide chase protocol described above, either with no stress or with the addition of H2O2 or diethylmaleate to induce oxidative stress. Time points were collected, and levels of Yap1 assayed by Western blotting. The addition of H2O2 caused Yap1 levels to markedly decline within 120 min after the onset of oxidative stress (Fig. 1B). diethylmaleate-induced oxidative stressed induced an even more rapid decline in Yap1 levels with the majority of this transcription factor being eliminated 60 min after oxidant exposure. Together, these data suggest that localization of Yap1 to the nucleus leads to degradation of the transcription factor. Previous studies have uncovered unique requirements for Yap1 nuclear translocation in the presence of H2O2. The Yap1-binding protein (Ybp1) is an integral component of Yap1 nuclear localization during H2O2 stress but is dispensable during challenge by oxidants such as diethylmaleate or diamide (12Veal E.A. Ross S.J. Malakasi P. Peacock E. Morgan B.A. Ybp1 is required for the hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidation of the Yap1 transcription factor.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30896-30904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 13Gulshan K. Rovinsky S.A. Moye-Rowley W.S. YBP1 and its homologue YBP2/YBH1 influence oxidative-stress tolerance by nonidentical mechanisms in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 318-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Use of a ybp1Δ strain allowed Yap1 to be selectively prevented from entering the nucleus during H2O2 stress but still accumulate in this compartment upon diamide stress. Cycloheximide chase analysis was performed to compare Yap1 degradation in wild-type or isogenic ybp1Δ cells under three different conditions: no stress or H2O2- or diamide-induced oxidative stress (Fig. 2A). Loss of Ybp1 completely prevented Yap1 degradation following H2O2 stress but had no effect on the turnover of Yap1 elicited by diamide shock. This finding argues that the presence of H2O2 is not sufficient to cause Yap1 degradation unless the protein also reaches the nucleus. To further explore the basis of oxidant-triggered degradation of Yap1, low-copy number plasmids expressing either wild-type (WT) or a DNA-binding mutant form (K67A) of Yap1 were introduced into yap1Δ cells. We previously characterized K67A Yap1 as being completely defective in DNA-binding as assessed by an in vitro assay (23Wemmie J.A. Wu A.L. Harshman K.D. Parker C.S. Moye-Rowley W.S. Transcriptional activation mediated by the yeast AP-1 protein is required for normal cadmium tolerance.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14690-14697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Degradation of wild-type and K67A Yap1 under stressed and nonstressed conditions was evaluated as above. K67A Yap1 was not degraded in response to either H2O2 or diamide stress, whereas the wild-type protein was destabilized by both treatments (Fig. 2B). The loss of oxidant-induced instability in the K67A form of Yap1 is consistent with the notion that Yap1 must be able to engage its target promoters to exhibit the characteristic degradation during stress This conclusion was supported by analysis of the regulated nuclear localization of the K67A form of Yap1. This mutant protein was normally imported into the nucleus in response to H2O2 treatment (Fig. 2C), eliminating any concern that defective nuclear import could explain the observed stability of this mutant Yap1 derivative. The primary determinant of the subcellular localization of Yap1 occurs at the level of nuclear export of this protein. The steady-state distribution of Yap1 is cytoplasmic owing to its relatively slow nuclear import (24Isoyama T. Murayama A. Nomoto A. Kuge S. Nuclear import of the yeast AP-1-like transcription factor Yap1p is mediated by transport receptor Pse1p, and this import step is not affected by oxidative stress.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21863-21869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), coupled with the rapid nuclear export via the action of the nuclear exportin Crm1 (7Kuge S. Toda T. Iizuka N. Nomoto A.

Lee L.H. Davis L.I. Crm1p mediates regulated nuclear export of a yeast AP-1-like transcription factor.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7416-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). A strain containing a temperature-sensitive allele of Crm1 was used to determine whether Yap1 was destabilized by trapping the protein in the nucleus. The crm1ts strain was transformed with a low-copy number plasmid expressing GFP-labeled Yap1 to confirm that Yap1 accumulates in the nucleus at the restrictive temperature. In parallel, the crm1ts strain was transformed with a vector plasmid containing or lacking the wild-type CRM1 gene to verify that any effect due to temperature shift in this strain was due to the crm1ts allele. Appropriate transformants were grown to mid-log phase, and then equal fractions were maintained at 30 °C or shifted to the restrictive temperature of 37 °C. After incubation at these temperatures, transformants were analyzed for Yap1 stability by cycloheximide chase or subcellular localization by fluorescence microscopy. Inactivation of Crm1 by growth at the restrictive temperature strongly destabilized Yap1 (Fig. 3A). Introduction of wild-type CRM1 into the temperature-sensitive background restored the stability of Yap1. No oxidants were added to these cultures, which supports the idea that loss of Yap1 nuclear export is sufficient to cause the protein to be susceptible to proteolysis. GFP-Yap1 was seen to accumulate in the nucleus at the restrictive temperature as expected (Fig. 3B). Together, these data suggest that accumulation of a DNA-binding competent form of Yap1 in the nucleus caused by oxidative stress, mutational inactivation of nuclear export (C629A mutation), or by inactivation of Crm1 is sufficient to lead to destabilization of the protein. Analyses of other transcription factors, including the basic region-leucine zipper-containing Gcn4 protein, have demonstrated that the proteasome is the proteolytic system responsible for their degradation (25Kornitzer D.

On the thylakoid lumenal side of PSII, a metal cluster of four Mn ions, one Ca2+ ion, and five oxo ligands (the Mn cluster) catalyzes the oxygen-evolving reaction.

However, the crystallographic information gained from the study of cyanobacterial PSII cannot necessarily be applied in the context of other eukaryotes because of the differences in PSII subunit composition. In particular, the composition of the PSII extrinsic subunits has undergone significant evolutionary changes; green plants, such as higher plants, green algae, and euglena have a set of 3 extrinsic proteins, namely PsbO (33 kDa), PsbP (23 kDa), and PsbQ (17 kDa). Alternatively, cyanobacteria have PsbV and PsbU instead of PsbP and PsbQ (12.Shen J.R. Inoue Y.

Acta. 2012; 1817: 1346-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, the functional role of His-144 has not been elucidated. X-ray crystal structural analyses suggest that the C-terminal domain of the PsbP protein from Nicotiana tabacum (PDB: 1V2B) and the CyanoP protein from Thermosynechococcus elongatus (PDB: 2XB3) have a similar α/β/α structure, which is characteristic of the PsbP superfamily (22.Ifuku K. Nakatsu T. Kato H. Sato F. Crystal structure of the PsbP protein of photosystem II from Nicotiana tabacum.EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 23.Michoux F. Takasaka K. Boehm M. Nixon P.J. Murray J.W. Structure of CyanoP at 2.8 Å: implications for the evolution and function of the PsbP subunit of photosystem II.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 7411-7413Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of spinach PsbP (PDB: 2VU4) has been recently reported (24.Kohoutová J. Kutá Smatanová I. Brynda J. Lapkouski M. Revuelta J.L. Arellano J.B. Ettrich R. Crystallization and preliminary crystallographic characterization of the extrinsic PsbP protein of photosystem II from Spinacia oleracea.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2009; 65: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the structure of spinach PsbP has one Zn2+ ion that is ligated to the Asp-165 and His-144 residues in the C-terminal domain. This Zn2+-binding domain is conserved in the structure of CyanoP. PsbP has been reported to bind Mn2+ ion, and the metal-binding site has been suggested to be around the His-144, Asp-165, and Glu-177 residues (25.Bondarava N. Beyer P. Krieger-Liszkay A. Function of the 23 kDa extrinsic protein of Photosystem II as a manganese binding protein and its role in photoactivation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1708: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 26.Bondarava N. Un S. Krieger-Liszkay A. Manganese binding to the 23 kDa extrinsic protein of Photosystem II.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The structural conservation may indicate the importance of metal binding for the function of PsbP and CyanoP. However, it is also possible that Zn2+ binding to the PsbP protein is an artifact, due to the conditions during the crystallization process. Therefore, further research is required to determine the importance of metal binding for the function of PsbP in PSII. In this study we characterized PsbP mutants to analyze how His-144 is involved in the functions of PsbP. We produced three PsbP mutant proteins: PsbP-H144A (H144A), wherein the conserved His-144 residue was substituted with Ala, PsbP-D165V (D165V), in which the Asp-165 residue was substituted with Val, and a mutant containing both substitutions, PsbP-H144A/D165V (H144A/D165V). The functional properties of the mutated PsbP proteins were studied by conventional release-reconstitution experiments and FTIR analyses. In addition, interaction between PsbP and PSII was investigated using a chemical cross-linker, a water-soluble carbodiimide, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC). The results obtained from these investigations suggest that metal-binding is not required for PsbP function, and that PsbP structure around the His-144 and Asp-165 residues plays a crucial role in maintaining the protein functional interaction with PSII. Finally, cross-linking experiments show that PsbP directly interacts with the cytochrome (Cyt) b559 α subunit (the PsbE protein) via its N terminus, and that this interaction is affected by H144A mutation. The expression plasmids for the mutated PsbP proteins H144A, D165V, and H144A/D165V were constructed using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the designed primers 5′-GGTGATGAGGGTGGAAAAGCCCAAGTAATTGCAGCGACTG-3′, 5′-GCTCAAGCTGGAGTCAAGAGATGGTTC-3′, and their respective complementary primers. The expression plasmid for A186C, in which Ala-186 is substituted with Cys, was constructed with the designed primer pair 5′-GGGAATTCCATATGGCCTATGGAGAAG-3′ and 5′-GGTTAACGAGCTCTTAACAAACACTGAAAGAACTGG-3′. The recombinant WT and mutated PsbP proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) and purified, as previously reported (27.Ifuku K. Sato F. Importance of the N-terminal sequence of the extrinsic 23 kDa polypeptide in photosystem II in ion retention in oxygen evolution.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1546: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A186C was labeled with maleimide-PEG2-biotin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The presence of the desired mutation in each recombinant PsbP and maleimide-PEG2-biotin labeling was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Autoflex III, Bruker). Oxygen-evolving PSII membranes of spinach were prepared as reported previously (28.Berthold D.A. Babcock G.T. Yocum C.F. A highly resolved, oxygen-evolving photosystem II preparation from spinach thylakoid membranes: EPR and electron-transport properties.FEBS Lett. 1981; 134: 231-234Crossref Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). The chlorophyll (Chl) concentration was calculated from the equations described in Ref. 29.Arnon D.I. Copper enzymes in isolated chloroplasts. Polyphenoloxidase in Beta Vulgaris.Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. The activity of isolated PSII membranes was ∼480 μmol O2/mg Chl/h. The reconstitution of PsbP to NaCl-washed PSII membranes and the measurement of O2 evolution were performed according to a procedure reported elsewhere (27.Ifuku K. Sato F.

PsbP was reconstituted with PSII in molecular ratio of 2:1 (PsbP:PSII), unless otherwise noted. To measure the oxygen-evolving activity in the presence of Ca2+ or Cl−, Ca(OH)2, or NaCl was added to the buffer used for activity measurements, respectively. The SDS-PAGE gels were stained using Flamingo (Bio-Rad) and visualized using a fluoro image analyzer FLA-3000 (FUJIFILM). The amount of protein bound to PSII was determined by measuring the fluorescence intensity with the software Multi Gauge Ver 3.0 (FUJIFILM). Preparation of membrane samples and FTIR measurements were performed as reported previously (19.Tomita M. Ifuku K. Sato F. Noguchi T. FTIR evidence that the PsbP extrinsic protein induces protein conformational changes around the oxygen-evolving Mn cluster in photosystem II.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 6318-6325Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), except that S2QA−-minus-S1QA difference spectra (hereafter termed S2QA−/S1QA difference spectra) were analyzed, instead of the S2/S1 difference spectra, as in the previous study. This modification was introduced to avoid the effect of potassium ferricyanide, which can act as an exogenous electron acceptor, on PsbP and PsbQ binding. The PSII samples in the presence of 0.1 mm DCMU were centrifuged, and the resulting pellet was sandwiched between the CaF2 plates. Light-induced S2QA−/S1QA FTIR difference spectra were recorded using a Bruker IFS-66/S spectrophotometer equipped with an MCT detector (Infrared D316/8) at a resolution of 4 cm−1 (31.Noguchi T. Ono T. Inoue Y. Direct detection of a carboxylate bridge between Mn and Ca2+ in the photosynthetic oxygen-evolving center by means of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1228: 189-200Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Illumination was performed using a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (Quanta-Ray GCR-130, 532 nm, ∼7 ns full width at half-maximum, ∼7 mJ pulse−1 cm−2 at the sample surface). Single-beam spectra (150 s scan) were recorded before and after single-flash illumination, providing a difference spectrum via subtraction of the initial spectrum from the spectrum obtained after illumination. The measurements were repeated three to five times for each sample. The samples were warmed to 285 K to relax the S2 state, and then cooled again to 250 K. One to two samples were used for the measurements, and the obtained spectra were averaged. NaCl-washed PSII membranes, at a concentration of 0.5 mg Chl/ml were cross-linked with the recombinant PsbP proteins in the cross-linking buffer (25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.2, 25 mm CaCl2) by using 6.25 mm EDC and 5 mm N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (sulfo-NHS). The solution was incubated for 2 h in darkness, and the reaction was terminated by adding ammonium acetate to a final concentration of 0.2 m. The solution was centrifuged for 5 min at 20,400 × g at 4 °C, and the pellet was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to PVDF membranes and analyzed by immunoblotting using specific antibodies. To cross-link the carboxyl groups on the NaCl-washed PSII and the primary amines on the PsbP, NaCl-washed PSII was treated with 6.25 mm EDC and 5 mm sulfo-NHS in activation buffer (25 mm Mes-NaOH pH 6.0, 500 mm NaCl) for 15 min in darkness, and then centrifuged for 5 min at 20,400 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was washed once with the cross-linking buffer and the activated PSII was subsequently incubated with PsbP in the cross-linking buffer without EDC or sulfo-NHS for 2 h in darkness. Rabbit antibodies against PsbP and D1 were prepared by the authors. Rabbit antibody against PsbO was provided by the late Dr. A. Watanabe of Tokyo University. Anti-CP47 rabbit antibody was provided by Dr. A. Tanaka of Hokkaido University, while rabbit antibody against CP43 was a gift from Dr. Y. Kashino of Hyogo Prefectural University. Rabbit antibodies against D2, PsbR and PsbE were purchased from Agrisera. PSII membrane cross-linked with A186C labeled with maleimide-PEG2-biotin was solubilized in 100 mm Hepes-NaOH pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 2% n-octyl-β-d-glucoside and incubated with Strep-Tactin Sepharose (IBA) at 4 °C for 1 h. The resin was washed three times with 100 mm Hepes-NaOH pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl and 1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min. The proteins bound to the resin were eluted by boiling the resin in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2.5% (w/v) SDS, 2.5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol) at 90 °C for 10 min, and used for subsequent analysis. The purified proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to in-gel digestion with Mass Spec Grade Modified Trypsin (Promega). The peptides were extracted and loaded on a column (100 μm internal diameter, 15 cm length; L-Column, CERI) using a Paradigm MS4 HPLC pump (Michrom BioResources) and an HTC-PAL autosampler (CTC Analytics). Buffers were (A) 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid and 5% (v/v) acetonitrile in water and 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid, and (B) 90% (v/v) acetonitrile in water. A linear gradient of buffer B from 5% to 45% was employed, and peptides eluted for 26 min from the column were introduced directly into an LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a flow rate of 200 nl min−1 and a spray voltage of 2.0 kV. The range of the mass spectrometric scan was a mass-to-charge ratio of 450 to 1,500, and the top three peaks were subjected to tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Thermo RAW files were converted to mzXML files with MM File Conversion Tools (www.massmatrix.net). Cross-linked peptides and cross-liked sites were identified with the MassMatrix Data base Search Engine (32.Xu H. Freitas M.A. MassMatrix: a database search program for rapid characterization of proteins and peptides from tandem mass spectrometry data.Proteomics. 2009; 9: 1548-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The settings were as follows: enzyme, trypsin, no P rule; decoy database, reversed; missed cleavages, 4; variable modifications, oxidation of M, amidation of DE, carbamidomethyl of C; precursor ion tolerance, 10 ppm; product ion tolerance, 0.8 Da; maximum number of PTM per peptide, 2; mass type, monoisotopic; minimum peptide length, 5; maximum peptide length, 40; cross link, EDC; cross link mode, exploratory; cross link site cleavability, non-cleavable by enzyme or not applicable; maximum number of cross links per peptide, 2. Fig. 1 shows the structural models of spinach PsbP (A, PDB ID: 2VU4) and of tobacco PsbP (B, PDB ID: 1V2B). In the spinach PsbP model a Zn2+ ion is ligated through the His-144 and Asp-165 residues, while the tobacco PsbP crystallizes in the absence of Zn2+ ions (22.Ifuku K. Nakatsu T. Kato H. Sato F. Crystal structure of the PsbP protein of photosystem II from Nicotiana tabacum.EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 33.Ifuku K. Nakatsu T. Kato H. Sato F.

Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1462-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The Glu-177 residue was speculated to be a metal-binding residue (26.Bondarava N. Un S. Krieger-Liszkay A. Manganese binding to the 23 kDa extrinsic protein of Photosystem II.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); however, its distance from the Zn2+ ion is relatively far (∼11 Å) in spinach PsbP. In tobacco PsbP, His-144 is likely to form a salt bridge (∼3.6 Å) with the carboxyl group of Asp-165. The spinach and tobacco PsbP structures are very similar, with a low root mean square deviation value (∼1.6 Å), indicating that the binding of Zn2+ does not cause major structural changes to PsbP. Recombinant WT and the mutated PsbP proteins H144A, D165V, and H144A/D165V expressed in Escherichia coli were purified to metal-free forms. The absence of any divalent cations was confirmed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (data not shown). We then performed conventional release-reconstitution experiments to determine whether these PsbP variants could restore the oxygen-evolving activity of the NaCl-washed PSII and bind to PSII. The oxygen-evolving activity was measured in the absence of Ca2+ and Cl− ions. The oxygen-evolving activity of the H144A-reconstituted PSII was about 55% of that of WT-reconstituted PSII (Fig. 2A), while D165V-reconstituted PSII showed activity comparable to that of WT-reconstituted PSII. Intriguingly, H144A/D165V-reconstituted PSII also showed activity comparable to that of WT-reconstituted PSII. Quantification of the PsbP bands in the SDS-PAGE gels showed that similar amounts of PsbP were bound in the WT-, H144A-, D165V-, and H144A/D165V-reconstituted PSII, suggesting that these mutations did not affect the ability of PsbP to bind to PSII (Fig. 2B). We also analyzed the importance of Glu-177 for PsbP function. Both the oxygen-evolving activity and the amount of PsbP bound to the PSII of the E177V-reconstituted PSII were similar to those of the WT-reconstituted PSII, indicating that Glu-177 is not essential for the ion retention and binding ability of PsbP (supplemental Fig. S1). These results suggest that the metal binding around His-144 and Asp-165 is not essential for PsbP function. To compare the binding ability of the WT and H144A PsbP proteins more precisely, reconstitution experiments were performed with various PsbP:PSII ratios. As shown in Fig. 2C, the WT and H144A PsbP proteins bound to PSII in a very similar manner when the reconstitution was performed with PsbP:PSII ratios from 0.25:1 to 2:1, indicating that the specific manner with which PsbP binds to PSII and the affinity of this binding is not affected by H144A mutation. Alternatively, when PsbP was reconstituted with a PsbP:PSII ratio of 4:1, the binding affinity of the H144A protein appeared greater than that of the WT. This may suggest that H144A binds to PSII in a nonspecific manner when an excess amount of H144A is present. To evaluate the effect of the H144A mutation on the Ca2+ and Cl− retention ability of PsbP separately, the oxygen-evolving activity of WT- and H144A-reconstituted PSII was measured under four conditions: in the presence of 10 mm Ca2+, in the presence of 20 mm Cl−, in the presence of 10 mm CaCl2, and in Ca2+- and Cl−-free conditions (Fig. 3A). Addition of 10 mm Ca2+ did not restore the oxygen-evolving activity of H144A-reconstituted PSII when compared with the activity in the absence of Ca2+ and Cl−. In contrast, addition of 20 mm Cl− significantly increased the activity of H144A-reconstituted PSII to about 80% of that of the WT. The activities of WT- and H144A-reconstituted PSII measured in the presence of 10 mm CaCl2 was comparable to the activity measured in the presence of 20 mm Cl−. We then examined the dependence of the oxygen-evolving activity of WT- and H144A-reconstituted PSII on Cl− concentration (Fig. 3B). The maximum activity of WT-reconstituted PSII occurred at 1.25 mm Cl−. Higher concentrations of Cl− gradually decreased the activity. In contrast, the maximum activity of H144A-reconstituted PSII occurred at 10 mm Cl−. These data suggest that the His-144 in PsbP is required to suppress the Cl− requirement of PSII for oxygen-evolving activity. FTIR spectroscopy suggests that the reconstitution of PsbP restored the conformational change around the Mn cluster, and that this conformational recovery is related to the ability of PSII to retain Ca2+ and/or Cl− (19.Tomita M. Ifuku K. Sato F. Noguchi T. FTIR evidence that the PsbP extrinsic protein induces protein conformational changes around the oxygen-evolving Mn cluster in photosystem II.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 6318-6325Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that H144A cannot restore this conformational change (20.Kakiuchi S. Uno C. Ido K. Nishimura T. Noguchi T. Ifuku K. Sato F. The PsbQ protein stabilizes the functional binding of the PsbP protein to photosystem II in higher plants.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1817: 1346-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Because H144A showed a defect in Cl− retention in PSII, the conformational change induced by PsbP would be relevant to Cl− binding in PSII. We then examined whether D165V and H144A/D165V could also restore the conformational change around the Mn cluster. Fig. 4 shows the S2QA−/S1QA difference spectra of the untreated, NaCl-washed, and PsbP WT- or mutant-reconstituted PSII membranes. Only the bands in the 1700–1600 cm−1 region that arise from the amide I vibrations (C=O stretches of backbone amides) of the polypeptide main chain are shown, as the changes in the other spectral regions were marginal as reported previously (19.Tomita M. Ifuku K. Sato F. Noguchi T. FTIR evidence that the PsbP extrinsic protein induces protein conformational changes around the oxygen-evolving Mn cluster in photosystem II.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 6318-6325Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). When PsbP and PsbQ were released from PSII by washing with NaCl, the shape of the amide I bands changed from that of the untreated PSII, indicating that the dissociation of PsbP and PsbQ triggered the conformational change around the Mn cluster (Fig. 4A, curve a). These changes are expressed more clearly in an untreated-minus-NaCl-washed double-difference spectrum (Fig. 4B, curve a). Reconstitution of H144A did not restore the spectral changes, and the spectrum obtained was very similar to that obtained from NaCl-washed PSII (Fig. 4, A and B, curve c), indicating that H144A could not properly restore the conformational change. Alternatively, reconstitution of WT, D165V, and H144A/D165V to NaCl-washed membranes restored the spectra, producing spectra similar to that of untreated PSII (Fig. 4, A and B, curves b, d, and e), indicating that WT, D165V, and H144A/D165V can induce proper conformational recovery during the S1→S2 transition of the Mn cluster. This suggests that H144A/D165V restores functional interaction between PsbP and PSII, which is required for Cl− retention in PSII. Our current data suggest that the C-terminal domain of PsbP, particularly the structure around the His-144 residue, is important for protein functional interaction with PSII. It has been suggested that PsbP associates with PSII via PsbO in higher plants (34.Miyao M. Murata N.

Although the leukocyte adhesion cascade ultimately helps to clear the host of infectious agents and to repair damaged tissues, during disseminated infections or inflammatory disorders the activation of the endothelium at sites remote from the inciting source can lead to the dysregulation of a variety of microvascular functions, causing organ failure and subsequent death (3Hotchkiss R.S.

Vascular ECs are uniquely situated to detect the presence of pathogens within the vasculature as they are in direct and constant contact with the circulating blood.

We previously reported that the TLR2-dependent activation of ECs leads to a variety of outcomes, including altered endothelial permeability, EC apoptosis, a shift in the expression of coagulation pathway factors to reflect a pro-coagulatory state, and up-regulation of proteins necessary for neutrophil recruitment, adherence, and activation at sites of inflammation (16Shin H.S.

Many of the TLR2-dependent outcomes observed in ECs differ from those of mononuclear cells, most notably the lack of TNFα expression, the expression and up-regulation of E-selectin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) activity, and the modulation of endothelial permeability. In fact, the expression of TLR2 itself is regulated differently in human ECs and mononuclear cells; in ECs, TLR2 lipoproteins induce the expression of TLR2, whereas in mononuclear cells they do not (16Shin H.S. Xu F. Bagchi A. Herrup E. Prakash A. Valentine C. Kulkarni H. Wilhelmsen K. Warren S. Hellman J.

Thus we hypothesized that different signaling pathways might be utilized in ECs and monocytes and performed studies to analyze the expression profiles for TLR1, TLR2, and TLR6 and assess the role of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) in TLR2-activated inflammatory pathways in primary human vascular ECs. The NF-κB and the MAPK pathways have been extensively studied downstream of inflammatory stimuli. The NF-κB family of transcription factors consists of RelA (p65), c-Rel, RelB, NF-κB1, and NF-κB2 (22Vallabhapurapu S. Karin M. Regulation and function of NF-κB transcription factors in the immune system.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 693-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2042) Google Scholar). Activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway results in the degradation of bound IκBα, IκBβ, or IκBϵ in the cytoplasm, which leads to the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus to mediate transcriptional events (22Vallabhapurapu S.

IκB kinase complexes. Gateways to NF-κB activation and transcription.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6685-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Proinflammatory stimuli can also induce the transactivation of p65 through phosphorylation, such as occurs after the TLR2-dependent activation of macrophages (24Perkins N.D.

The MAPK family members p38-MAPK, JNK, and ERK1/2 participate in the inflammatory response and are induced by TLR2 activation in macrophages (26Cargnello M. Roux P.P.

There is some indication that another MAPK family member, ERK5, also participates in inflammatory signaling (29Zhu W. Downey J.S. Gu J. Di Padova F. Gram H. Han J.

The MAPKs can induce proinflammatory gene expression by directly activating transcription factors and by regulating proteins involved in transcriptional and translational control; however, ERK1/2 and p38-MAPK have also been reported to negatively regulate inflammatory gene expression (26Cargnello M.

Leukocyte inflammatory signaling cascades have been more extensively studied than those of ECs, but there is evidence suggesting that the signaling pathways utilized by ECs and monocytes overlap considerably (33Collins T.

Guided by known TLR2 signaling pathways in leukocytes and by known inflammation pathways in ECs, in the current report we defined several inflammatory signaling pathways downstream of TLR2 in ECs and tested the hypothesis that TLR2 signaling differs in ECs and monocytes. We observe that the p65 subunit of NF-κB and the MAPK family members p38-MAPK, JNK, and ERK5 are all required for the TLR2-induced up-regulation of inflammatory proteins and PAI-1 in ECs. We also provide evidence that MEK1 negatively regulates TLR2-activated inflammatory responses in ECs, whereas MEK1-positive regulates them in human monocytes. Thus divergent TLR2 signaling pathways exist in human ECs and monocytes. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC, passage 2–6) (Lonza, Walkersville, MD) and human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-L, passage 4–6) (Lonza) were incubated at 37 °C under humidified 5% CO2. HMVEC-L were prepared from both male and female cadaver donors. HUVEC were grown in EGM-2 and HMVEC-L in EGM-2MV (Lonza). Endothelial growth medium was supplemented with 2% FCS. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and the monocytic cell line THP-1 were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, l-glutamine, and antibiotics. THP-1 cells were differentiated into macrophages with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) as described previously (36Daigneault M. Preston J.A. Marriott H.M. Whyte M.K. Dockrell D.H. The identification of markers of macrophage differentiation in PMA-stimulated THP-1 cells and monocyte-derived macrophages.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e8668Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Adherent cells were grown to 100% confluence before treatment, whereas suspension cells were seeded at 2.5 × 105 cells/cm2 and were agonist-treated the next day. Cells were treated with either the TLR2 agonist Pam3Cys-SKKK or FSL-1 (EMC Microcollections, Tubingen, Germany) at 1 or 10 μg/ml, recombinant human TNFα (Peprotech, Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ) at 0.05 or 0.10 μg/ml, recombinant human EGF (Sigma) at 200 ng/ml or hydrogen peroxide at 3 mm unless otherwise noted for the indicated times. Preparations of Pam3Cys, FSL-1, and TNFα contained <5 pg of LPS/μg of protein based on the Limulus-amebocyte lysate assay (Associates of Cape Cod, Inc., East Falmouth, MA). Cells were preincubated with the MAPK inhibitors SB203580 (10 μm) and SP600125 (10 μm) (Calbiochem) and BIRB 796 (10 μm), AEG3482 (10 μm), PD184352 (1 μm), and XMD8–92 (5 μm) (Axon Medchem; Netherlands) for 1 h before and continuously during agonist treatment. Heparinized whole blood was collected by venipuncture from healthy human volunteers. Human PBMCs and neutrophils were isolated by gradient centrifugation using LymphoprepTM and PolymorphprepTM (Axis-Shield, Oslo, Norway), respectively. PBMCs were isolated according to the manufacturer's supplied instructions and neutrophils as described previously (37Nuzzi P.A. Lokuta M.A. Huttenlocher A. Analysis of neutrophil chemotaxis.Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 370: 23-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NF-κB p65 (RELA) (L-003533-00-0005), TLR2 (D-001810-10-05), ERK5 (L-003513-00-0005), and control (L-005120-01-0005) siRNA ON-TARGET plus SMARTPools (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) were used in accordance with the manufacturer's suggested protocol for HUVEC transfections using DharmaFECT 4 transfection reagent. Protein cell lysates (see below) were prepared 72 h post-siRNA transfection, and cell culture supernatants were collected 68 h post-siRNA transfection (48 h + 20 h agonist treatment). Cells lysates were prepared using a nuclear extraction kit (Panomics, Fremont, CA). NF-κB(1) EMSA Probe Set (AY1030P) and NF-κB(1) EMSA kit (AY1030; Panomics) were used to detect the presence of active NF-κB according to the manufacturer's supplied protocol. Protocol specifics were as follows. 10 μg of the nuclear fraction was used per reaction, and samples were run in non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels. Oligos were transferred to Ball Biodyne B nylon membrane using a semidry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad), and oligos were immobilized by placing the membrane in a UV Stratalinker® (Stratagene) for 3 min at 120 mJ and then placed in foil and baked for 1 h. After incubation with substrate detection solution, the membrane was exposed to film for 20–24 h before development. Direct densitometry measurements were performed on all EMSAs using ImageJ. Cells were lysed with PLC lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm sodium chloride, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate) plus protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and protein concentrations of the lysates were estimated using the RCDC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Total proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to PVDF membranes (Pall Corp, Ann Arbor, MI). Membranes were blocked in 3% BSA for 45 min at room temperature (RT) and then incubated with primary antibody solution overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were the washed and then incubated with suitable peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Immunoblots were developed using SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (34076; Thermo Scientific), and the signal was detected using a Gel Logic 2200 Imaging System (Eastman Kodak Co.) run on Carestream Imaging Software (Carestream Health, Rochester, NY). Antibodies were: TLR2 (0.5 μg/ml, AF2616, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), E-selectin (2.5 μg/ml, BBA18, R&D Systems), phospho-JNK (0.5 μg/ml, AF1205, R&D Systems), phospho-p38MAPK (1:1000, 4631, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), phospho-ERK1/2 (1:1000, 9106, Cell Signaling), phospho-ERK5 (1:1000, 3371, Cell Signaling), JNK (1:1000, 9252, Cell Signaling), p38MAPK (1:1000, 9212, Cell Signaling), ERK1/2 (1:2000, 9107, Cell Signaling), ERK5 (1:1000, 3372, Cell Signaling), phospho-p65 Ser-536 (1:1000, 3033, Cell Signaling), NF-κB p65 (1 μg/ml, SC-8008X, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), IκBα (0.1 μg/ml, MAB4299, R&D Systems), IκBβ (1 μg/ml, MAB3425, R&D Systems), IκBϵ (1 μg/ml, MAB4300, R&D Systems), and actin (0.1 μg/ml, A2066, Sigma). HUVEC were grown in 48-well plates. The cells were gently washed once with PBS (w/Ca2+ and Mg2+) and incubated with either 2.5 μg/ml E-selectin (BBA18; R&D Systems), ICAM-1 (BBA3; R&D Systems), goat IgG (NI02; Calbiochem) or mouse IgG1 (MAB002; R&D Systems) diluted in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 1% FBS for 1 h at 37 °C. After 4 washes, the cells were then incubated with either a 1:2000 dilution of bovine anti-goat-HRP or goat anti-mouse-HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 1% FBS for 1 h at 37 °C. After 4 washes, bound HRP substrate was detected using a TMB reagent (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD), and the absorbance was read at 450 nm, and values were corrected at 570 nm. A crystal violet assay was performed to assess the relative cell density in each well (38Yen J. Kramer S.M. A rapid in vitro cytotoxicity assay for the detection of tumor necrosis factor on human BT-20 cells.J. Immunother. 1991; 10: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). If significant differences were observed between treatments, the absorbance values for the particular assay were corrected. Supernatant concentrations of IL-6, CSF-2, and CSF-3 were detected using Human DuoSet kits (R&D Systems). IL-8 levels were detected using a human IL-8 ELISA kit (BD Biosciences). Active human PAI-1 was detected using the PAI-1 functional assay ELISA kit (Molecular Innovations, Novi, MI). All assays were performed according to the manufacturer's supplied protocol. Values were corrected when a significant difference in cell density was observed between treatments based on crystal violet assay. HUVEC were grown on collagen-I-coated coverslips. The cells were washed once with PBS (w/Ca2+ and Mg2+), then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at RT, washed, and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 5 min at RT. HUVEC were then blocked with 3% normal goat serum (TLR2) or 2% BSA (p65) containing 1 μg/ml human IgG (R&D Systems) in PBS-Tween for 30 min at RT. For TLR2, HUVEC were incubated with either FITC-conjugated mouse anti-human TLR2 (5 μg/ml; mab-mtlr2f, Invivogen, San Diego, CA) or FITC-conjugated mouse IgG1 (1:10; 556649, BD Pharmingen) diluted in 4% normal goat serum in PBS-Tween overnight at 4 °C. Coverslips were then washed and stained and mounted to microscope slides with ProLong® Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For P65, HUVEC were preincubated in the presence of 100 ng/ml leptomycin B (Sigma) for 1 h, then incubated with either mouse anti-human p65 (10 μg/ml; SC-8008 X; Santa Cruz) or mouse IgG1 (10 μg/ml; MAB002; R&D Systems) diluted in 2% BSA in PBS for 1 h at RT. The cells were then washed and incubated with goat anti-mouse-FITC (5 μg/ml; AP180F; Millipore; MA) diluted in 2% BSA in PBS for 30 min at RT. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (0.1 μg/ml; VWR) for 10 s before mounting on microscope slides with Vectashield (Fisher). HUVEC were detached using Accutase Cell Detachment Solution (Innovative Cell Technologies, San Diego, CA). HUVEC and THP-1 cells were passed through a 40 μm filter, counted, and aliquoted at 1 × 106 cells per sample. The cells were then washed using flow cytometry staining buffer (R&D Systems) and incubated with 10 μg/ml human IgG (R&D Systems) in flow cytometry staining buffer for 15 min at 4 °C. After washing twice with flow cytometry staining buffer, the cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with either FITC-conjugated mouse anti-human TLR2 (5 μg/ml; mab-mtlr2f, Invivogen), E-selectin (2.5 μg/ml; BBA21; R&D Systems), ICAM-1 (2.5 μg/ml; BBA20; R&D Systems), or mouse IgG1 (1:10; BD Pharmingen). All samples were washed 2 more times with flow cytometry staining buffer and then were analyzed by flow cytometry (BD LSRII Flow Cytometer; BD Biosciences). TaqMan human TOLL-like receptor pathway arrays (4418838), specific gene expression assays (HPRT1 (Hs01003267_m1), TLR1 (Hs00413978_m1), TLR2 (Hs00152932_m1), TLR6 (Hs00271977_s1), TRAF6 (Hs00371512_g1), and the manufacturer suggested assay reagents were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). HUVEC monolayers, HMVEC-L monolayers, and THP-1 cells were lysed, and mRNA was isolated using TRIzol according to the manufacturer's supplied protocol (Invitrogen). mRNA concentrations were determined with a ND-1000 (NanoDrop®/Thermo Fisher Scientific), and mRNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using the High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit using 2 μg of mRNA per reaction (Invitrogen). An input of 2.5 ng of cDNA in 10-μl total reaction volume per well containing TaqMan® Fast Advanced Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) was used in all quantitative real-time PCR experiments, and quantitative real-time PCR was performed using the StepOnePlusTM System (Applied Biosystems). PCR activation at 95 °C for 20 s was followed by 40 cycles of 1 s at 95 °C and 20 s at 60 °C. The average Ct value of two technical replicates was used in all calculations with specific gene expression assays. The average Ct value of the internal controls HPRT1 and 18S were used to calculate ΔCt values for the array samples as this combination of reference genes displayed the lowest standard deviation among groups. HPRT1 alone was used to calculate ΔCt values for specific gene expression assays. For the human Toll-like receptors pathway arrays, the initial data analysis was performed using the 2−ΔΔCt method (39Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Analysis of relative gene expression data using real-time quantitative PCR and the 2−ΔΔCt method.Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (123336) Google Scholar), and the data were corrected using log transformation, mean centering, and auto scaling as described by Willems et al. (40Willems E. Leyns L. Vandesompele J. Standardization of real-time PCR gene expression data from independent biological replicates.Anal. Biochem. 2008; 379: 127-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). For the specific gene expression assays, statistical analyses were calculated from the uncorrected ΔCt values. The methods of calculation utilized assume an amplification efficiency of 100% between successive cycles. The quantitative real-time PCR array data discussed in this publication have been deposited in NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (41Edgar R. Domrachev M. Lash A.E. Gene Expression Omnibus.

https://openalex.org/W2069405524,"Cellulosomes are multienzyme complexes responsible for efficient degradation of plant cell wall polysaccharides. The nonenzymatic scaffoldin subunit provides a platform for cellulolytic enzyme binding that enhances the overall activity of the bound enzymes. Understanding the unique quaternary structural elements responsible for the enzymatic synergy of the cellulosome is hindered by the large size and inherent flexibility of these multiprotein complexes. Herein, we have used x-ray crystallography and small angle x-ray scattering to structurally characterize a ternary protein complex from the Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome that comprises a C-terminal trimodular fragment of the CipA scaffoldin bound to the SdbA type II cohesin module and the type I dockerin module from the Cel9D glycoside hydrolase. This complex represents the largest fragment of the cellulosome solved by x-ray crystallography to date and reveals two rigid domains formed by the type I cohesin·dockerin complex and by the X module-type II cohesin·dockerin complex, which are separated by a 13-residue linker in an extended conformation. The type I dockerin modules of the four structural models found in the asymmetric unit are in an alternate orientation to that previously observed that provides further direct support for the dual mode of binding. Conserved intermolecular contacts between symmetry-related complexes were also observed and may play a role in higher order cellulosome structure. SAXS analysis of the ternary complex revealed that the 13-residue intermodular linker of the scaffoldin subunit is highly dynamic in solution. These studies provide fundamental insights into modular positioning, linker flexibility, and higher order organization of the cellulosome."
https://openalex.org/W2166436673,"It is becoming clear that inflammation plays a significant role in a number of neurological and psychiatric conditions. Post mortem brain samples in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia and most recently autism spectrum condition, all exhibit neuroglial activation and inflammatory markers within the CSF. Many questions remain about the underlying molecular mechanisms. By adding the pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-α, to mouse brain tissue we demonstrated that the frontal lobes and temporal region, areas involved in higher functions such as memory and learning, are most susceptible to cytokine-induced inflammation via the NF-κB signalling pathway. We observed direct correlations between the volumetric increase and molecular expression indicating that therapeutic targets in these lobes may require different approaches when treating conditions with a central neuroinflammatory component."
https://openalex.org/W2035333034,"The immunesuppressive cytokine TGF-β plays crucial regulatory roles in the induction and maintenance of immunologic tolerance and prevention of immunopathologies. However, it remains unclear how circulating T-cells can escape from the quiescent state maintained by TGF-β. Here, we report that the T-cell integrin leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) interaction with its ligand intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) induces a genetic signature associated with reduced TGF-β responsiveness via up-regulation of SKI, E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase SMURF2, and SMAD7 (mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 7) genes and proteins. We confirmed that the expression of these TGF-β inhibitory molecules was dependent on STAT3 and/or JNK activation. Increased expression of SMAD7 and SMURF2 in LFA-1/ICAM-1 cross-linked T-cells resulted in impaired TGF-β-mediated phosphorylation of SMAD2 and suppression of IL-2 secretion. Expression of SKI caused resistance to TGF-β-mediated suppression of IL-2, but SMAD2 phosphorylation was unaffected. Blocking LFA-1 by neutralizing antibody or specific knockdown of TGF-β inhibitory molecules by siRNA substantially restored LFA-1/ICAM-1-mediated alteration in TGF-β signaling. LFA-1/ICAM-1-stimulated human and mouse T-cells were refractory to TGF-β-mediated induction of FOXP3+ (forkhead box P3) and RORγt+ (retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptor γt) Th17 differentiation. These mechanistic data suggest an important role for LFA-1/ICAM-1 interactions in immunoregulation concurrent with lymphocyte migration that may have implications at the level of local inflammatory response and for anti-LFA-1-based therapies. The immunesuppressive cytokine TGF-β plays crucial regulatory roles in the induction and maintenance of immunologic tolerance and prevention of immunopathologies. However, it remains unclear how circulating T-cells can escape from the quiescent state maintained by TGF-β. Here, we report that the T-cell integrin leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) interaction with its ligand intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) induces a genetic signature associated with reduced TGF-β responsiveness via up-regulation of SKI, E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase SMURF2, and SMAD7 (mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 7) genes and proteins. We confirmed that the expression of these TGF-β inhibitory molecules was dependent on STAT3 and/or JNK activation. Increased expression of SMAD7 and SMURF2 in LFA-1/ICAM-1 cross-linked T-cells resulted in impaired TGF-β-mediated phosphorylation of SMAD2 and suppression of IL-2 secretion. Expression of SKI caused resistance to TGF-β-mediated suppression of IL-2, but SMAD2 phosphorylation was unaffected. Blocking LFA-1 by neutralizing antibody or specific knockdown of TGF-β inhibitory molecules by siRNA substantially restored LFA-1/ICAM-1-mediated alteration in TGF-β signaling.

The serine/threonine kinase PknB is of particular relevance to the life cycle of S. aureus as it is involved in the regulation of purine biosynthesis, autolysis, and other central metabolic processes of the bacterium. We have determined the crystal structure of the kinase domain of PknB in complex with a non-hydrolyzable analog of the substrate ATP at 3.0 Å resolution. Although the purified PknB kinase is active in solution, it crystallized in an inactive, autoinhibited state. Comparison with other bacterial kinases provides insights into the determinants of catalysis, interactions of PknB with ligands, and the pathway of activation."
https://openalex.org/W2121935932,"ABCG2 is an ATP-dependent efflux transporter that limits the systemic exposure of its substrates. The preferred substrates of ABCG2 in vivo are largely unknown. We aimed to identify the compounds transported by ABCG2 under physiological conditions. In vitro, ABCG2 transports several sulfate conjugates at high rates. We therefore used targeted metabolomics, specifically detecting compounds conjugated to sulfate, to search in plasma, urine, and bile samples of wild-type and Abcg2–/– mice for differentially present compounds, which are likely to represent in vivo ABCG2 substrates. Levels of many sulfate conjugates were up to 15-fold higher in plasma and urine of Abcg2–/– than of wild-type mice, with the opposite effect seen in bile. These differentially present compounds were identified as the sulfate conjugates of phytoestrogens, compounds with weak pro- or antiestrogenic properties. We confirmed that these sulfate conjugates were ABCG2 substrates using transportomics, a method that uses vesicular transport assays to screen for substrates of ABC transporters in body fluids. In conclusion, our results show that ABCG2 limits the systemic exposure to many different phytoestrogens, a class of compounds to which mammals are exposed on a daily basis via food of plant origin, by directing their sulfate conjugates for excretion via the feces.—Van de Wetering, K., Sapthu, S.

Based on indirect evidence, it was speculated that the cation binding sites bear a negative charge. However, little is known about the electrostatics of the transport process. Valences calculated using the Poisson-Boltzmann equation indicate that negative charge is transferred across the membrane when only one cation is bound. Consistently, transient currents were observed in response to voltage jumps when K+ was the only cation on both sides of the membrane. Furthermore, rapid extracellular K+ application to EAAC1 under single turnover conditions (K+ inside) resulted in outward transient current. We propose a charge compensation mechanism, in which the C-terminal transport domain bears an overall negative charge of −1.23. Charge compensation, together with distribution of charge movement over many steps in the transport cycle, as well as defocusing of the membrane electric field, may be combined strategies used by Na+-coupled transporters to avoid prohibitive activation barriers for charge translocation.

We constructed chimeric proteases and substrates to examine the role of C-terminal domains of ADAMTS13 and ADAMTS5 in the recognition of their physiological cleavage sites in von Willebrand factor (VWF) and aggrecan, respectively. ADAMTS5 cleaves Glu373–Ala374 and Glu1480–Gly1481 bonds in bovine aggrecan but does not cleave VWF. Conversely, ADAMTS13 cleaves the Tyr1605–Met1606 bond of VWF, which is exposed by fluid shear stress but cannot cleave aggrecan. Replacing the thrombospondin-1/cysteine-rich/spacer domains of ADAMTS5 with those of ADAMTS13 conferred the ability to cleave the Glu1615–Ile1616 bond of VWF domain A2 in peptide substrates or VWF multimers that had been sheared; native (unsheared) VWF multimers were resistant. Thus, by recombining exosites, we engineered ADAMTS5 to cleave a new bond in VWF, preserving physiological regulation by fluid shear stress.

After 0.5 h, substrate cleavage was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using peroxidase-conjugated anti-His tag antibody (Tetra-His; Qiagen). After incubation for 5 h, the products were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10–20% gradient gel, transferred onto a PVDF membrane (0.2 μm; Invitrogen), and stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain (Invitrogen). C-terminal product bands (8.8–11 kDa) were excised from the membrane and sequenced by automated Edman degradation (W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory, Yale University). ADAMTS variants were incubated with 750 nm bovine aggrecan (Sigma-Aldrich) in reaction buffer at 37 °C, and the reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 20 mm EDTA.

https://openalex.org/W2139325100,"Recent crystallographic studies revealed that G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) possess a putative cytoplasmic helical domain, termed helix 8, at the proximal region of the C-terminal tail. However, the significance of helix 8 in GPCR functions and signaling is not fully understood. Helix 8 mutants of leukotriene B4 receptor type 1 (BLT1) exhibit prolonged activation after ligand stimulation, suggesting some regulatory roles of helix 8 in GPCR signaling. Here, we report the inhibitory role of BLT1 helix 8 on ligand-dependent internalization using BLT1 and platelet-activating factor receptor as model GPCRs. Mutating the dileucine motif in helix 8 of BLT1 to alanines (BLT1 LLAA) enhanced LTB4-dependent internalization of BLT1, whereas wild-type (WT) BLT1 exhibited minimal internalization. Mutational studies revealed that phosphorylation of 5 serine/threonine residues between amino acids 308 and 319 of BLT1 was responsible for enhanced ligand-dependent internalization of BLT1 LLAA. BLT1 LLAA showed enhanced basal and ligand-dependent phosphorylation compared to WT BLT1. Taken together, helix 8 of BLT1 inhibits receptor internalization by suppressing the excessive phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail."

https://openalex.org/W1984214225,"The roles of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptor endocytosis in signaling have been investigated in numerous studies, mainly through the use of endocytosis inhibitory treatments, yielding conflicting results. Two potential sources for these discrepancies were the pleiotropic effects of a general blockade of specific internalization pathways and the scarce information on the regulation of the endocytosis of the signal-transducing type I TGF-β receptor (TβRI). Here, we employed extracellularly tagged myc-TβRI (wild type, truncation mutants, and a series of endocytosis-defective and endocytosis-enhanced mutants) to directly investigate the relationship between TβRI endocytosis and signaling. Our findings indicate that TβRI is targeted for constitutive clathrin-mediated endocytosis via a di-leucine (Leu(180)-Ile(181)) signal and an acidic cluster motif. Using Smad-dependent transcriptional activation assays and following Smad2/3 nuclear translocation in response to TGF-β stimulation, we show that TβRI endocytosis is dispensable for TGF-β signaling and may play a role in signal termination. Alanine replacement of Leu(180)-Ile(181) led to partial constitutive activation of TβRI, resulting in part from its retention at the plasma membrane and in part from potential alterations of TβRI regulatory interactions in the vicinity of the mutated residues."

Genetic studies have identified additional proteins necessary for repression by Cyc8p-Tup1p, including the Mediator/Srb subunits Med3p, Med21p/Srb7p, and Cdk8p/Srb10p that interact directly with the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme (20Gromöller A.

Cyc8p-Tup1p also directly interacts with class I and II histone deacetylases; the simultaneous mutation of three genes encoding histone deacetylases, RPD3, HOS1, and HOS2, abolishes Cyc8p-Tup1p activity (24Watson A.D. Edmondson D.G. Bone J.R. Mukai Y. Yu Y. Du W. Stillman D.J. Roth S.Y.

TUP1 utilizes histone H3/H2B-specific HDA1 deacetylase to repress gene activity in yeast.Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 117-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Tup1p preferentially interacts with underacetylated histone H3 and H4 isoforms at their N-terminal regions in vitro (26Edmondson D.G. Smith M.M. Roth S.Y. Repression domain of the yeast global repressor Tup1 interacts directly with histones H3 and H4.Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Notably, genes repressed by Tup1p are associated with underacetylated histones in vivo, and mutations in H3 and H4 histones synergistically reduce repression levels (26Edmondson D.G. Smith M.M. Roth S.Y. Repression domain of the yeast global repressor Tup1 interacts directly with histones H3 and H4.Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Recently, Cyc8p-Tup1p has been shown to prevent the recruitment of transcriptional coactivators by DNA-binding proteins (27Wong K.H. Struhl K. The Cyc8-Tup1 complex inhibits transcription primarily by masking the activation domain of the recruiting protein.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 2525-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Repression by Cyc8p, when recruited to a promoter through a bacterial LexA DNA-binding domain, is Tup1p-dependent, whereas repression by Tup1p-LexA can occur in the absence of Cyc8p (28Keleher C.A. Redd M.J. Schultz J. Carlson M. Johnson A.D.

Functional dissection of the yeast Cyc8-Tup1 transcriptional co-repressor complex.Nature. 1994; 369: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Tup1p may therefore be responsible for repressor activity, with Cyc8p possibly serving as a bridge between Tup1p and other proteins. S. cerevisiae CYC8, not TUP1, is required for normal growth (30Schultz J. Carlson M. Molecular analysis of SSN6, a gene functionally related to the SNF1 protein kinase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3637-3645Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and the S. pombe ssn6+ gene has also been shown to be essential for growth (31Fagerström-Billai F. Durand-Dubief M. Ekwall K.

Biol. 2007; 27: 1069-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In vitro protein binding experiments and two-hybrid studies have identified three protein-protein binding domains in Tup1p (713 residues, molecular mass of ∼78 kDa; see Fig. 1A). The N-terminal 72 residues in Tup1p interact with Cyc8p and are required for self-tetramerization, but this region cannot independently repress transcription (29Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Functional dissection of the yeast Cyc8-Tup1 transcriptional co-repressor complex.Nature. 1994; 369: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Residues 73–386 form the repression domain (29Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Functional dissection of the yeast Cyc8-Tup1 transcriptional co-repressor complex.Nature. 1994; 369: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and interact with the N-terminal regions of histones H3 and H4 (26Edmondson D.G.

The C-terminal region of Tup1p (residues 333–706) directly interacts with DNA-binding repressor proteins, e.g. Matα2p (32Komachi K. Johnson A.D.

For the study reported herein, we determined the crystal structure of the Tup1p N-terminal domain (NTD, residues 1–92), which is required for Tup1p tetramerization and association with Cyc8p. NTD forms a novel antiparallel four-helix bundle, which is organized as a dimer of dimers with the protomers of each dimer associated via coiled coil interactions at their N- and C-terminal regions. Nonpolar residues in the coiled coil regions are required for self-association and transcriptional repression of genes targeted by Tup1p. A mutant NTD Tup1p-L62R also forms a dimer of dimers, although it contains interactions between protomers that are markedly unlike those of the wild-type NTD and that may be related to the ability of Cyc8p-Tup1p complexes to oligomerize when associated with chromatin targets. Escherichia coli strains DH5α and JM109 (39Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar), respectively, served as hosts during plasmid construction and GST-tagged protein expression. S. cerevisiae strain YMH427 (MATα tup1::HIS3 ura3-52 trp1 his3 pho3 pho5 leu2-3,112::[LEU2, STE6-PHO5]) was used for complementation assays of TUP1 disruption (9Mukai Y. Matsuo E. Roth S.Y.

The primer sequences used are listed in supplemental Table S1. pGEX-NTD for expression of GST-tagged NTD was constructed by inserting into pGEX-6P-1 (GE Healthcare) the 0.3-kbp EcoRI-SalI fragment encoding residues 1–92 that had been PCR-amplified using the primers TUP1(1–92)f and TUP1(1–92)r. pCDF-TPR1–3 for the expression of His-tagged TPR1–3 was constructed by inserting into pCDF-1b (Novagen) the 0.3-kbp KpnI-SacI fragment encoding TPR1–3 that had been PCR-amplified using the primers CYC8TPR1f and CYC8TPR3r. The YCp50-based plasmid pYMC119, previously referred to as CCC (9Mukai Y. Matsuo E. Roth S.Y. Harashima S.

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit reagents (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primers used for mutagenesis are listed in supplemental Table S1. pGEX-NTD served as the template. The mutated TUP1s were sequenced to verify that the desired mutation(s) were present. Mutated TUP1s, each in a pGEX-6P-1, were PCR-amplified with the primers TUP1(1–72)IFf and TUP1(1–72)IFr and individually cloned into the HindIII-MluI site in a yeast expression vector pYMC119 using In-Fusion Advantage PCR cloning kit reagents (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Random mutagenesis by error-prone PCR was performed using GeneMorph II random mutagenesis kit reagents (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Error-prone PCR was performed with pGEX-NTD as the template and the primers TUP1(1–72)IFf and TUP1(1–72)IFr. The PCR products were individually cloned into pYMC119 as described above, and the resulting plasmid library was screened for TUP1 mutants after insertion into YMH427. When the expression product of a mutated gene did not complement Δtup1, the mutated gene was recovered and sequenced with TUP1pf as a sequencing primer to determine the mutation site(s). Preparation and manipulation of DNA and RNA, and transformation with lithium acetate for the complementation assay were as described (40Amberg D.C. Burke D.J. Strathern J.N. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2005Google Scholar). Acid phosphatase activity in the yeast colonies was detected using the diazo-coupling staining method (41Toh-E A. Oshima Y. Characterization of a dominant, constitutive mutation, PHOO, for the repressible acid phosphatase synthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Bacteriol. 1974; 120: 608-617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR kit reagents (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cultures of E. coli JM109 cells containing pGEX-NTD were incubated in Luria broth, 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C until the A600 values of the cultures were between 0.6 and 1.0. Expression was induced by addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration), and the cultures were then incubated overnight at 20 °C. The harvested cell pellets from 2 liters of culture medium were suspended in 25 ml of 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.47 mm KH2PO4, pH 6.0, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, protease inhibitor complete mixture (one tablet; Roche Applied Science), and sonicated. The lysate was centrifuged at 323,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (GE Healthcare), which was pre-equilibrated with 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.47 mm KH2PO4, pH 6.0. The protein was eluted with 20 mm glutathione in the same buffer. Fractions containing GST-tagged NTD were pooled and concentrated. GST was removed by treatment with PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare). After dialysis against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA-2Na, 1 mm DTT, the protein solution was loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (GE Healthcare) to separate GST from NTD. Recovered NTD was then chromatographed through a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl. The eluted fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and MALDI mass spectrometry. Fractions containing NTD were pooled and concentrated, and the protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay kit reagents with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Cultures of E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pCDF-TPR1–3 were incubated in Luria broth, 20 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C until the A600 values of the cultures were between 0.6 and 1.0. Then expression was induced by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the cultures were incubated overnight at 20 °C. The harvested cell pellets from 2 liters of culture medium were suspended in 23 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 20 mm imidazole, protease inhibitor complete EDTA-free mixture (one tablet; Roche Applied Science) and sonicated. The lysate was centrifuged at 81,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and then the supernatant was loaded onto an nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow cartridge (5 ml, Qiagen), which was pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 20 mm imidazole. The protein was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 500 mm imidazole. The eluted, pooled fractions were chromatographed through a Hiload 26/60 Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.01% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The eluted protein was characterized by SDS-PAGE and MALDI mass spectrometry, and the protein solution was concentrated to 10 mg/ml with centrifugal concentrators (Millipore). Protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay kit reagents with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The purified NTD and SeMet-NTD samples were concentrated to 10 and 12 mg/ml, respectively. The NTD and SeMet-NTD crystals used for x-ray diffraction were each grown in 5-μl solutions that contained 3 μl of MilliQ water, 1 μl of protein solution, and 1 μl of reservoir solution (10% (v/v) 2-propanol, 0.1 m phosphate citrate, pH 4.2, 0.2 m Li2SO4) equilibrated against 1 ml of the reservoir solution using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C. For SeMet-NTD, the crystal that diffracted to the highest resolution was obtained by stirring the crystallization solution (42Matsumura H. Sugiyama S. Hirose M. Kakinouchi K. Maruyama M. Murai R.

Purified NTD-L62R and SeMet-NTD-L62R samples were each concentrated to 10 mg/ml. For crystallization of NTD-L62R, the reservoir solution (300 μl) was 14% (v/v) 1,4-dioxane, 0.1 m MES monohydrate, pH 6.5, 1.6 m ammonium sulfate and was equilibrated against a 2-μl drop that contained 1 μl of protein solution and 1 μl of reservoir solution using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C. The SeMet-NTD-L62R crystal was grown using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. The reservoir solution (300 μl) was 13% (v/v) 1, 4-dioxane, 0.1 m MES monohydrate, pH 6.7, 1.3 m ammonium sulfate and was equilibrated against a drop that contained 1 μl of protein solution and 1 μl of reservoir solution at 20 °C. Crystals were each mounted into a loop and then flash frozen in a stream of nitrogen at 100 K. The diffraction data were collected at 100 K synchrotron radiation at the SPring8 BL44XU and Photon Factory KEK-PF BL17A beamlines (Japan). The diffraction data sets were processed using HKL2000 (43Otwinowski, Z., (1993) in Data Collection and Processing: Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend: Data Collection and Processing (Sawyer, L., Isaacs, N., Bailey, S., eds) pp. 56–62, Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UKGoogle Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1994082182,"Using patterned optogenetic stimulation and chronic in vivo imaging of dendritic spines, this study shows that the precise pattern of neural spiking—rather than total number of spikes—is the major determinant of dendritic spine stability in cortical pyramidal neurons. The stability of dendritic spines in the neocortex is profoundly influenced by sensory experience, which determines the magnitude and pattern of neural firing. By optically manipulating the temporal structure of neural activity in vivo using channelrhodopsin-2 and repeatedly imaging dendritic spines along these stimulated neurons over a period of weeks, we show that the specific pattern, rather than the total amount of activity, determines spine stability in awake mice."

Several x-ray structures of NAP1 dimers are available; however, there are currently no structures of this ubiquitous chaperone in complex with histones. We have characterized NAP1 from Xenopus laevis and reveal that it forms discrete multimers with histones H2A/H2B and H3/H4 at a stoichiometry of one NAP dimer to one histone fold dimer. These complexes have been characterized by size exclusion chromatography, analytical ultracentrifugation, multiangle laser light scattering, and small-angle x-ray scattering to reveal their oligomeric assembly states in solution. By employing single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, we visualized these complexes for the first time and show that they form heterogeneous ring-like structures, potentially acting as large scaffolds for histone assembly and exchange."
https://openalex.org/W2090193095,"Hyaluronan is synthesized within the cytoplasm and exported into the extracellular matrix through the cell membrane of fibroblasts by the MRP5 transporter. In order to meet the law of electroneutrality, a cation is required to neutralize the emerging negative hyaluronan charges. As we previously observed an inhibiting of hyaluronan export by inhibitors of K(+) channels, hyaluronan export was now analysed by simultaneously measuring membrane potential in the presence of drugs. This was done by both hyaluronan import into inside-out vesicles and by inhibition with antisense siRNA. Hyaluronan export from fibroblast was particularly inhibited by glibenclamide, ropivacain and BaCl(2) which all belong to ATP-sensitive inwardly-rectifying K(ir) channel inhibitors. Import of hyaluronan into vesicles was activated by 150 mM KCl and this activation was abolished by ATP. siRNA for the K(+) channels K(ir)3.4 and K(ir)6.2 inhibited hyaluronan export. Collectively, these results indicated that hyaluronan export depends on concurrent K(+) efflux."

Thereby, codon effect on enzyme thermal property needs to be investigated. organism optimal growth temperature coding sequence optimal temperature for activity content of each codon within a CDS content of each nucleotide within a CDS relative synonymous codon usage. Thermophilic index and enzyme data are important for analysis. In the investigation of enzyme thermophilic features, data are often selected from different families and are divided into thermophilic and mesophilic groups according to whether or not the OGT values higher than 50 °C. However, the cutoff value is arbitrarily set to some extent (21Kumar P.R. Eswaramoorthy S. Vithayathil P.J. Viswamitra M.A. The tertiary structure at 1.59 Å resolution and the proposed amino acid sequence of a family-11 xylanase from the thermophilic fungus Paecilomyces varioti bainier.J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Additionally, there is a much weaker correlation between OGT value and enzyme thermostability (22Dehouck Y. Folch B. Rooman M. Revisiting the correlation between proteins' thermoresistance and organisms' thermophilicity.Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2008; 21: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In particular, OGT values are unspecific when used to describe thermal properties of enzymes encoded by lateral transfer genes, which occur very often among organisms (23Nelson K.E. Clayton R.A.

Evidence for different pathways during horizontal gene transfer in competent Bacillus subtilis cells.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000630Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Unlike OGT, an enzyme optimal reaction temperature for activity (Topt) specifically describes its thermal activity, and the Topt is specific to exclude interference of lateral gene transfer. Moreover, the Topt value of an enzyme correlates well with its thermostability (28Lo Leggio L. Kalogiannis S. Bhat M.K. Pickersgill R.W.

Dong H. Wang S. Chen H. Shao W. Computational analysis of dipeptides correlated with the optimal temperature in G/11 xylanase.Process Biochem. 2006; 41: 305-311Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Because different structural proteins employ different strategies for thermostability (30Szilágyi A. Závodszky P.

Scholtz J.M. Lessons in stability from thermophilic proteins.Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 1569-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), enzymes selected from different families interfere with thermal analysis. The interference can be eliminated by selecting homologous enzymes from the same family (22Dehouck Y. Folch B. Rooman M. Revisiting the correlation between proteins' thermoresistance and organisms' thermophilicity.Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2008; 21: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). GH10 xylanase exhibits (α/β)8 structure, and the typical fold forms ∼10% enzymes, including α-amylase, glucanase, β-mannanase, triosephosphate isomerase, etc. (28Lo Leggio L. Kalogiannis S. Bhat M.K. Pickersgill R.W. High resolution structure and sequence of T. aurantiacus xylanase I: implications for the evolution of thermostability in family 10 xylanases and enzymes with (β)α-barrel architecture.Proteins. 1999; 36: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). GH10 xylanase is used as a model to analyze codon effect on enzyme thermal property because (α/β)8 can provide more general information. The dataset is constructed for GH10 xylanase coding sequences (CDSs) and Topt values. Codon content and relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) are calculated within the CDSs and are respectively linearly regressed with the Topt values, which can be used to describe the xylanase thermophilic tendencies without dividing them into two clear-cut groups of thermophile and mesophile. This study can provide more insights into the enzyme thermophilic mechanism. A dataset was constructed by retrieving GH10 xylanase CDSs from GenBankTM (Release 165.0). To eliminate sequence redundancy, the CDSs were categorized and listed according to the xylanase annotations in Swiss-Prot (Release 55.4). From published literature, the Topt values were taken to describe xylanase thermophilic tendencies. Topt values were found for 38 CDSs: O13436, O30427, O30700, O32374, O52373, O52374, O59859, O66065, O69230, O69261, P07528, P07986, P10478, P14768, P23360, P23556, P26223, P26514, P29417, P33559, P36917, P40942, P40943, P40944, P45703, P51584, P56588, P74912, Q00177, Q12603, Q2PGV8, Q5NUI5, Q60037, Q60042, Q60043, Q60044, Q76BV3, and Q8GJ37 (supplemental Table 1). The sequence identities range from 6.0 to 88.7%, and the Topt values range from 40 to 102 °C. The resource organisms include 8 eukaryotes and 30 bacteria (including archaebacteria), covering psychrophiles, mesophiles, thermophiles, and hyperthermophiles. Counts and contents were calculated for the 61 codons and the 4 nucleotides within each CDS with our own designed programs (Compaq Visual FORTRAN 6). Codon content (Ci) was defined as a ratio of each codon relative to the sum of codons within a CDS. Nucleotide content (Ni) was defined as a ratio of each nucleotide relative to sum of nucleotides within a CDS. Ci=Obsi/∑i=161obsi(Eq. 1) where Ci, Obsi, and Σi = 161obsi indicate content, observation frequency of each codon, and sum of codons within a CDS. Ni=ni/∑i=14ni(Eq. 2) where i indicates A, U, C, and G, respectively, and contents of A+G, U+C, A+C, U+G, A+U, and G+C were respectively calculated. Ni and Σi = 14ni indicate the content of each nucleotide and the sum of nucleotides within a CDS). RSCUi was defined as a ratio of each codon relative to expected frequency if all synonymous codons are used equally (32Sharp P.M. Li W.H. The codon Adaptation Index: a measure of directional synonymous codon usage bias, and its potential applications.Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1281-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (2645) Google Scholar). RSCUi=Obsi/Expi(Eq. 3) Expi=∑aai/∑i=159syni(Eq. 4) There are 59 RSCU values because Trp and Met have only one codon. Obsi is the observational frequency of each codon within a CDS, Σaai is the sum of residues within a xylanase, and Σi = 159syni indicates the number of synonymous codon encoding for the same residue. The variables Ci, RSCUi, and Ni were respectively linearly correlated with the Topt values (Origin, Version 6.1). Cutoff of the p value was set for codons as p < 0.15, and for nucleotides, it was set as p < 0.1 because codon content was low. Effects of codons and nucleotides on enzyme thermal property were assessed by their correlation coefficients with Topt. The analysis was based on multiple hypothesis testing that related to 61 codons. Thus, false positive codons found by linear analysis had to be excluded. Bonferroni correction is a standard statistics method in multiple analysis (33Audic S. Claverie J. The significance of digital gene expression profiles.Genome Res. 1997; 7: 986-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar, 34Benjamini Y. Yekutieli D. The control of the false discovery rate in multiple testing under dependency.Ann. Stat. 2001; 29: 1165-1188Crossref Scopus (6849) Google Scholar). Thus, the related codons found above were corrected by the Bonferroni method. According to the method, the codons were ranked based on their p values. The significance was set as p < 0.15 in multiple analysis, and these values were divided by the number of multiple factors to exclude false positive codons. After that, the false positive rate was analyzed. 23,005 codons were analyzed using codon content, and 15 codons were found relating to the Topt value. However, after the Bonferroni correction analysis, five codons were found to reach a significant level, and the others were false positives (supplemental Table 2). The 23,005 codons were also analyzed using RSCU because it was usually used in codon analysis (32Sharp P.M. Li W.H.

Synonymous codon usage influences the local protein structure observed.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 6719-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and 15 codons were found relating to the Topt value. However, four codons were found to reach a significant level after Bonferroni correction analysis, and the others were false positives (supplemental Table 3). RSCU has no connection with codon content, and therefore, no straight connection with the Topt. However, the RSCU found four codons that found by codon content analysis, showing that codon content is fine for finding related codons. Thus, two (CGU and AGC) of the five codons correlated negatively, and three (AUA, AGA, and AGG) of the five codons correlated positively with the xylanase Topt value (Table 1). Among the three codons of arginine, AGA, AGG, and CGU, the first two correlate positively (with a ratio of 1.8:1), and the last one correlates negatively with the Topt value (Fig. 1). One codon of isoleucine (AUA) correlates positively with the Topt value (Table 1). After that, the five codons were respectively counted within the three genes having the lowest Topt values and within the three genes having highest Topt values. The ratios are 15:2, 10:1, and 10:3 for the contents of positive codons, AUA, AGA, and AGG, within thermophilic genes relative to mesophilic genes, respectively. In contrast, the ratios are 0:8 and 1:3 for the contents of negative codons, CGU and AGC, within thermophilic genes relative to mesophilic genes, respectively (Table 2).TABLE 1Codon usage pattern relating to xylanase thermal activityCodonResidues encode forResidue preference for secondary structureNegativeCGUArgiα/iβAGCSerHtPositiveAGAArgiα/iβAGGArgiα/iβAUAIleiα/Hβ Open table in a new tab TABLE 2The five related codon contents within the six selected genesCDSToptCodon content (×103)Positive codonsNegative codonsAUA (Ile)AGA (Arg)AGG (Arg)CGU (Arg)AGC (Ser)°CQ5NUI540570165P2941740008821O5985940000026Average223817Q12603851027500Q6003790181810013Q60042102171415013Average15201009Ratio15:210:110:30:81:3 Open table in a new tab Consistent with our result, prior genome analyses found that thermopiles had decreased GCN and increased AGR (36Basak S.

Garcia-Vallve S. Gaining and losing the thermophilic adaptation in prokaryotes.Trends Genet. 2008; 24: 10-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), although those studies had different purposes from this study. Two codons of arginine (AGA and AGG) and one of isoleucine (ATH) were shown to be the characteristic codon usage pattern of thermophiles. In addition, three codons of arginine, AGA, AGG, and CGU, significantly discriminated thermophiles from mesophiles (19Lobry J.R. Chessel D. Internal correspondence analysis of codon and amino acid usage in thermophilic bacteria.J. Appl. Genet. 2003; 44: 235-261PubMed Google Scholar). To get more general information, the codons were analyzed for nucleotide constituents. The three positive ones are purine-rich, and two of them have A-ends. The two negative codons are pyridine-rich, and one has a C-end. To examine whether or not the C- and A-ends are general features of the codons related to the Topt value, all other A- and C-ending codons were collected and analyzed (supplemental Tables 2 and 3). In general, all the other A- and C-ending codons correlate positively and negatively with the Topt value, although the p values are significantly higher than the set value. The C- and A-ending feature of the codons shows that codon effect concentrates mainly on the 3rd nucleotide. Thus, in addition to keeping translation fidelity (40Shabalina S.A. Ogurtsov A.Y. Spiridonov N.A. A periodic pattern of mRNA secondary structure created by the genetic code.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 2428-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), which is well known to cause the degeneracy of the genetic codon, codons also contain effects of message on xylanase thermal activity. To get complete information about the codons, we further investigated the residues for their preferences for specific secondary structural elements (41Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Empirical predictions of protein conformation.Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 251-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2336) Google Scholar, 42Malkov S.N. Zivković M.V. Beljanski M.V. Stojanović S.D. Zarić S.D. A reexamination of correlations of amino acids with particular secondary structures.Protein J. 2009; 28: 74-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The residues are compatible with the helixes and strands, characteristics of the GH10 xylanase (α/β)8 structure (28Lo Leggio L. Kalogiannis S. Bhat M.K. Pickersgill R.W. High resolution structure and sequence of T. aurantiacus xylanase I: implications for the evolution of thermostability in family 10 xylanases and enzymes with (β)α-barrel architecture.Proteins. 1999; 36: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The two negative codons encode for one Arg and one Ser. Arg is a non-helix- and strand-forming residue, and Ser prefers forming turns (Table 1). The three positive codons encode for two Arg residues and one Ile. These two residues are non-helix- and strand-forming residues (Table 1). In general, the negative and positive codons do not prefer specific secondary structural elements. Thereby, the codon effects depend on the residual propensities for relative secondary structures. Nucleotide contents are calculated within mRNA and analyzed with the Topt value to investigate nucleotide effect on the codons. A% and C% correlate positively and negatively with the Topt value, respectively (Fig. 2). Thereby, AG% and UC% correlate positively and negatively with the Topt value, respectively. Consistent with our data, genome analysis found that A and G were typically involved in thermophilic mRNA (2Paz A. Mester D. Baca I. Nevo E. Korol A. Adaptive role of increased frequency of polypurine tracts in mRNA sequences of thermophilic prokaryotes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 2951-2956Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, the codons relating to the Topt value were selected by thermophilic force at the nucleotide level. The relationship of A% and C% within mRNA with the Topt value is consistent the A- and C-ending feature of positive and negative codons. Thereby, the nucleotides A and C are indicated as having positive and negative effects on the xylanase thermal activity. Among the three codons of Arg, AGA, AGG, and CGU, the first two have positive effects on xylanase Topt value, and the third one has negative effect on xylanase Topt value (Table 1). This result correlates with the low preference of Arg for specific secondary structures. The codons, AGA and AGG, have AG, whereas the CGU has CU at the 1st and 3rd nucleotides. The negative and positive effects of cytosine and adenine are attributed to the small and big size, respectively. Comparable with the three-dimensional structural analysis of the codon, the codon central C is reorganized by tRNA (G in the anti-codons) from the major groove side, whereas the central U is reorganized by tRNA (A in the anti-codons) from the minor groove side (43Rodin S.N. Rodin A.S. On the origin of the genetic code: signatures of its primordial complementarity in tRNAs and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.Heredity. 2008; 100: 341-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Influenced by the Anfinsen protein folding principle (44Anfinsen C.B. Principles that govern the folding of protein chains.Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5138) Google Scholar), enzyme thermal property is mainly investigated at the residual or structural levels. Presently, thermal property is analyzed at the codon level by using the GH10 xylanase as a model, and codons are found to have effects on the xylanase thermal property. Consistent with our data, Adzhubei (45Adzhubei A. Non-random usage of “degenerate” codons is related to protein three-dimensional structure.FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) found the degeneracy of genetic codon to relate to the three-dimensional structure of the protein. Saunders and Deane (37Saunders R. Deane C.M. Synonymous codon usage influences the local protein structure observed.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 6719-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) found that codons had more information than residues, and therefore, gave more insights into the translation role in protein folding. Thereby, synonymous codons might have slightly different functions demanded by protein translation because enzymes exhibited closely balanced free energy profiles for folding and unfolding process, which allowed functional dynamic motions and protein degradations (46Bae E. Phillips Jr., G.N. Structures and analysis of highly homologous psychrophilic, mesophilic, and thermophilic adenylate kinases.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28202-28208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 47Korkegian A. Black M.E. Baker D. Stoddard B.L. Computational thermostabilization of an enzyme.Science. 2005; 308: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Protein evolved for a long time to acquire a pre-existing collective of structure and dynamics (48Eisenmesser E.Z. Millet O. Labeikovsky W. Korzhnev D.M. Wolf-Watz M. Bosco D.A. Skalicky J.J. Kay L.E. Kern D. Intrinsic dynamics of an enzyme underlies catalysis.Nature. 2005; 438: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 49Bernadó P. Blackledge M. Structural biology: proteins in dynamic equilibrium.Nature. 2010; 468: 1046-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This is probably why the residues Arg, Leu, and Ser have six synonymous codons, and most other residues have four or two, except that the Ile has three codons. This distribution pattern of synonymous codons provides each residue of the 61 codons with slightly different functions to form the specific secondary structural elements. Because gene transfer is a common phenomenon among organisms (23Nelson K.E. Clayton R.A. Gill S.R. Gwinn M.L. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Nelson W.C. Ketchum K.A. McDonald L.

There is a big difference between enzyme Topt and OGT value (supplemental Table 1). For example, the Cryptococcus xylanase Topt value is 47.5 °C (50Gomes J. Gomes I. Steiner W. Thermolabile xylanase of the Antarctic yeast Cryptococcus adeliae: production and properties.Extremophiles. 2000; 4: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); however, its OGT value is 4–12 °C, lower than that of Aspergillus aculeatus. However, the A. aculeatus xylanase Topt value is 40 °C (51Dalbøge H. Expression cloning of fungal enzyme genes: a novel approach for efficient isolation of enzyme genes of industrial relevance.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 21: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The Penicillium simplicissimum xylanase Topt value is 67.0 °C (52Gübitz G.M. Haltrich D. Latal B. Steiner W.

The big differences probably indicate that the genes were caused by lateral gene transfer. Data selection is also important for enzyme thermophilic analysis because different structural enzymes employ different strategies for thermostability (30Szilágyi A. Závodszky P. Structural differences between mesophilic, moderately thermophilic, and extremely thermophilic protein subunits: results of a comprehensive survey.Structure. 2000; 8: 493-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 31Razvi A. Scholtz J.M. Lessons in stability from thermophilic proteins.Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 1569-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used the Topt values and CDSs of GH10 xylanases, the homologous enzymes of the same family, to exclude interference from heterologous enzymes and unspecific OGT values. In the present study, codon effect was analyzed on enzyme thermal property by using linear correlation. Normal practice is to use a cutoff value of 0.05. The p value was set as 0.15 to find as many codons as possible because the 61 codon contents are very low within each CDS. Moreover, the analysis was based on multiple hypothesis, and false positives had to be excluded by the Bonferroni correction method (33Audic S. Claverie J. The significance of digital gene expression profiles.Genome Res. 1997; 7: 986-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar, 34Benjamini Y. Yekutieli D. The control of the false discovery rate in multiple testing under dependency.Ann. Stat. 2001; 29: 1165-1188Crossref Scopus (6849) Google Scholar). If the cutoff value was set too low, codons would be hard to find. The false positive rate is 67% in codon content analysis (supplemental Table 2). The false positive rate is 75% in RSCU analysis (supplemental Table 3). The false positive rates in both methods are approximately equal to the Bonferroni correction factor, 61. The RSCU has the drawback of having no relation with codon content. Moreover, the RSCU value is 1 for Met and Trp. However, the RSCU analysis found four shared codons by codon content analysis, showing that the analysis is accurate. Higher p values and lower coefficient values indicate codons having only slight effects on enzyme thermal activity; however, the accumulation of the slight effects is of real importance. We can infer that codons affect enzyme thermal property at different levels. Basically, the rate of amino acid translation differed by a 6-fold order magnitude between common and infrequent synonymous codons (53Varenne S. Buc J. Lloubes R. Lazdunski C. Translation is a non-uniform process: effect of tRNA availability on the rate of elongation of nascent polypeptide chains.J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 549-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 54Sørensen M.A. Kurland C.G. Pedersen S. Codon usage determines translation rate in Escherichia coli.J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 207: 365-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). At the protein expressional level, α-helix is encoded faster than β-strand and irregular coil (8Thanaraj T.A. Argos P. Protein secondary structural types are differentially coded on messenger RNA.Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1973-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Codon bias usage could be used to distinguish different secondary structural elements (55Gupta S.K. Majumdar S. Bhattacharya T.K. Ghosh T.C. Studies on the relationships between the synonymous codon usage and protein secondary structural units.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 692-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) because synonymous codons are not randomly used. At the structural level, α-helix and irregular coil correlated positively and negatively with the xylanase Topt value (56Liu L. Chen H. Jia X. The influence of secondary structure content on thermostability of F/10 xylanase.J. Biotechnol. 2008; 136s (s201): s201Crossref Google Scholar), and we successfully increased the xylanase thermostability by deleting terminal residues that do not form helix and strand (57Liu L. Zhang G. Zhang Z. Wang S. Chen H. Terminal amino acids disturb xylanase thermostability and activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 44710-44715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Protein is translated through a successive translocation-and-pause cycle, with a median pause length of 2.8 s (58Wen J.D. Lancaster L. Hodges C. Zeri A.C. Yoshimura S.H. Noller H.F. Bustamante C. Tinoco I. Following translation by single ribosomes one codon at a time.Nature. 2008; 452: 598-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Thereby, peptide bond is not formed at an even rate, and in this process, protein structure is organized (59Thanaraj T.A. Argos P. Ribosome-mediated translational pause and protein domain organization.Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1594-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Thus, we postulate that codon usage affects protein translational rate, and therefore, affects its folding and hydrogen-bond formation, and ultimately, affects enzyme thermal activity. The resurrected ancestral elongation factor had higher thermostability than the other homologues (3Gaucher E.A. Govindarajan S. Ganesh O.K. Palaeotemperature trend for Precambrian life inferred from resurrected proteins.Nature. 2008; 451: 704-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), demonstrating directly that codons affected protein thermal property. Zhang et al. (60Zhang G. Hubalewska M. Ignatova Z. Transient ribosomal attenuation coordinates protein synthesis and co-translational folding.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) also perturbed the protein folding efficiency by mutating some synonymous codons. Mendez et al. (61Mendez R. Fritsche M. Porto M. Bastolla U. Mutation bias favors protein folding stability in the evolution of small populations.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2010; 6: e1000767Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) found GC bias mutation affecting the protein folding stability, making it less hydrophobic and less stable to unfolding but also less susceptible to misfolding and aggregation. In summary, the GH10 xylanase CDSs and Topt values were used to eliminate the interference of residual bias usage that arose from using different structures and unspecific OGT values as the thermophilic index. The codon effect was analyzed on xylanase thermal property by respectively analyzing codon content and RSCU, and we found five codons, with two (CGU and AGC) showing negative and three (AUA, AGA, and AGG) showing positive correlations with the xylanase Topt value. Thus, in addition to the well known degeneracy, genetic codons also have effects of message on enzyme thermal property. However, the message is lost when the thermal property is analyzed at the residual level.

Induced pluripotent stem cell research has broadened possibilities for regenerative medicine and captured the world's attention in a way that science rarely does. However, clinical applications utilizing cultured stem cells have existed for >30 years and can assist benchers and bedsiders in identifying and expediting promising avenues for future therapies. The stem cell community generally credits Till and McCulloch's transplantation experiments of the 1960s on the hematopoietic system for the demonstration that adult tissues contain stem cells (Till and McCulloch, 1961Till J.E. McCulloch E.A. Radiat. Res. 1961; 14: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (3224) Google Scholar). In those experiments, so-called colony forming units (CFUs) were produced by short-term culture of isolated murine bone marrow cells and then individually transplanted into irradiated recipients to reconstitute the hematopoietic system. From these early in vivo experiments came the concept that stem cells are often rare cells that fuel homeostasis and wound repair through their ability to generate both the proliferating and the differentiating cells of our tissues. The notion that stem cells can do so long term also came from hematopoietic studies as researchers began to perform long-term experiments on hematopoietic stem cells that were isolated and purified directly from the bone marrow and serially transplanted through many generations. Although the hematopoietic system led the way in devising concepts for stem cell biology, the ability to passage stem cells long term in vitro began in the 1970s with the pioneering work of Howard Green on human epithelial stem cells. At the time, most researchers resorted to immortalized, transformed cell lines, which seemed to be the only cells that could proliferate and differentiate and yet easily be passaged long term. Cloned teratocarcinoma cells were particularly interesting to developmental biologists, who were examining the ability of these embryonic-like cells to differentiate along a variety of lineages in vitro. Green noticed that epithelial colonies were among the cell types present within teratocarcinoma cultures and discovered that he could clone and propagate them on a layer of lethally irradiated, diploid mouse 3T3 fibroblasts, a line that he had developed previously. When the strategy of using a fibroblast feeder layer was subsequently applied to human epidermal cells, large colonies of diploid epithelial keratinocytes grew that retained their ability to self renew and terminally differentiate long term (Rheinwald and Green, 1975Rheinwald J.G. Green H. Cell. 1975; 6: 331-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3900) Google Scholar). Green and his colleagues continued to improve upon the culture conditions (reviewed by Green, 1991Green H. Sci. Am. 1991; 265: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). They added epidermal growth factor purified from rat submaxillary glands to the culture conditions, as well as insulin and dexamethasone. They also spiked the media with cholera toxin, a constitutive activator of cyclic AMP, which also aided cell growth substantially. As the keratinocyte's enormous proliferative powers became increasingly exposed, so did the promise to generate sufficiently large sheets of cultured epidermal cells from a small piece of healthy skin to cover the damaged regions of a badly burned patient. These early studies represent the birth of what is now a 30 year successful application of purified human stem cells for regenerative medicine (reviewed by Green, 1991Green H. Sci. Am. 1991; 265: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Therapeutic uses of cultured stem cells are often viewed by the public as futuristic, if not science fiction. We need to work harder to educate our society of the already fulfilled wonders of stem cells for medical applications. The clinical applications for epithelial cells have not ended at epidermal cells. Using very similar culture conditions, other stratified squamous epithelial stem cells, including corneal cells, can be cultured long term in vitro. This ability led to the subsequent application of cultured corneal progenitors to treat patients suffering from corneal blindness, and a 10 year study of successfully treating 100 such patients was recently published by Michele De Luca, Grazia Pellegrini, and colleagues (reviewed by Rama et al., 2010Rama P. Matuska S. Paganoni G. Spinelli A. De Luca M. Pellegrini G. N. Engl. J. Med. 2010; 363: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). These early culture methods did much more than ever imagined at the time. Moreover, they not only paved the way for these impressive clinical applications, but in addition they opened the door for embryonic stem cell (ESC) research as we know it today. The concept of coculturing epithelial cells with a fibroblast feeder layer was quickly adapted to mouse ESCs and worked particularly well when used in conjunction with conditioned medium from teratocarcinoma cells (Evans and Kaufman, 1981Evans M.J. Kaufman M.H. Nature. 1981; 292: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (6427) Google Scholar, Martin, 1981Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1981; 78: 7634-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (4291) Google Scholar). Once the hurdle of culturing primary ESCs was overcome, germline transmission was soon achieved, providing graphic illustration that ESCs are truly pluripotent, able to generate the ∼210 cell types of the mouse (Robertson et al., 1986Robertson E. Bradley A. Kuehn M. Evans M. Nature. 1986; 323: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Although the early mammalian cell culture studies were instrumental in bringing stem cells to a clinical setting, a two decade gap separated those advances from the ones of Yamanaka and colleagues that have captivated the interests of scientists and public alike (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18842) Google Scholar). What accounted for this gap and how can we expedite progress in regenerative medicine in the years to come? Below are a few ideas based upon the history of the field and my own experiences as a stem cell biologist. As a postdoctoral fellow and biochemist in Green's laboratory in the late 1970s, I was far more fascinated by studying how epidermal stem cells balance growth and differentiation at a molecular level than I was in the scientifically more mundane, albeit more immediately relevant, task of optimizing culture conditions for burn therapy. Although placing stem cells into a molecular framework has taken three additional decades to evolve, there are several recent indications that continuing to build upon this foundation will be the engine that drives regenerative medicine in the future. In this regard, it is intriguing that cyclic AMP, one of the culture additives that advanced epithelial regenerative medicine in the 1970s, was recently found to act downstream in the Wnt signaling pathway (Goessling et al., 2011Goessling W. Allen R.S. Guan X. Jin P. Uchida N. Dovey M. Harris J.M. Metzger M.E. Bonifacino A.C. Stroncek D. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8: 445-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), known to have a powerful impact on stem cells and tissue regeneration. This new knowledge has now been translated into an FDA-approved phase 1 clinical trial that could significantly improve human cord blood transplantations (Goessling et al., 2011Goessling W. Allen R.S. Guan X. Jin P. Uchida N. Dovey M. Harris J.M. Metzger M.E. Bonifacino A.C. Stroncek D. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8: 445-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). On a similar note, in converting skin fibroblasts to iPSCs, Yamanaka and coworkers achieved their success by exploiting not only mammalian cell culture technology but also knowledge of the molecular differences between human ESCs and fibroblasts. By employing an amazingly simple screen to weed out nonessential genes in these differential patterns of gene expression, the researchers honed in on the key transcription factors that promote an embryonic-like fate (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18842) Google Scholar). This knowledge, based squarely upon the molecular foundations of ESC biology, is now fueling efforts to identify small molecules that will optimize iPSC derivation and culture. In other words, while the field began with cell culture to fuel molecular insights into stem cell biology (as discussed in, for example, Blanpain and Fuchs, 2009Blanpain C. Fuchs E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar), the molecular insights are now fueling approaches to expand the repertoire and populations of cultured stem cells that can be applied in the clinics. Another relevant lesson stemming from the dawn of epidermal stem cell biology is that keratinocytes alter their program of gene expression in culture. Based upon what we currently understand about the extraordinary complexities of skin stem cell niches (reviewed in Blanpain and Fuchs, 2009Blanpain C. Fuchs E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar), it seems unlikely that this will be fully rectified no matter what we may do to optimize culture conditions. That said, the long-standing success of cultured human keratinocytes for burn therapy and the absence of skin cancers in patients engrafted decades ago suggests that epidermal progenitors do not lose their stemness when passaged in vitro, nor do they become transformed. Analogously, when engrafted onto the backs of hairless mice, murine hair follicle stem cells passaged in vitro can generate epidermis, sebaceous glands, and hair follicles, and they even seem to be able to collaborate with dermal cells in recreating a new stem cell niche (reviewed in Blanpain and Fuchs, 2009Blanpain C. Fuchs E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that as long as their capacity for long-term self-renewal and differentiation can be faithfully maintained in vitro, cultured stem cells should continue to hold promise for regenerative medicine even if they transiently adopt a new molecular program when propagated outside their normal microenvironment. As exciting as this concept is, with few exceptions, stem cell populations are in limited supply, posing significant hurdles even for stem cells such as corneal or hematopoietic stem cells where clinical applications are well established. Taking a page from developmental biology, it would seem that one good way to overcome these barriers would be to funnel our collective research energies into enhancing our knowledge of stem cell activation and self-renewal. Such strategies are ones that are already being actively pursued by a number of stem cell researchers. Indeed, the aim to enhance hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal in vitro was behind the Zon group's efforts to conduct their cleverly devised zebrafish screen for FDA-approved small molecules that could enhance the process in vivo. This in turn resulted in the identification of dimethyl-prostaglandin E2 (dmPGE2), which has not only provided a possible link between cAMP and Wnt stem cell signaling pathways but has also led to the phase 1 clinical trials described above (Goessling et al., 2011Goessling W. Allen R.S. Guan X. Jin P. Uchida N. Dovey M. Harris J.M. Metzger M.E. Bonifacino A.C. Stroncek D. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8: 445-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). And in a recent RNAi screen for self-renewing hair follicle stem cell genes, clues have surfaced that might be exploited to improve epithelial stem cell expansion in vitro (Chen et al., 2012Chen T. Heller E. Beronja S. Oshimori N. Stokes N. Fuchs E. Nature. 2012; (in press)Google Scholar). If so, this could aid current treatments for corneal blindness, where stem cell numbers are often the rate-limiting step to success (reviewed by Rama et al., 2010Rama P. Matuska S. Paganoni G. Spinelli A. De Luca M. Pellegrini G. N. Engl. J. Med. 2010; 363: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). An alternative route to overcoming the limited supplies of cultured stem cells is to transdifferentiate closely related cells that are either in greater supply or which can be propagated more easily in vitro than the desired stem cell. For instance, if we can gain an understanding of the transcriptional differences between corneal and skin stem cells, can we exploit this information to transdifferentiate skin stem cells into corneal stem cells? Given the close relation between these two types of stratified squamous epithelial progenitors, such an approach seems like a baby step relative to Yamanaka's giant step that launched the game of transdifferentiation hopscotch. Although the borders between dreaming and thinking beyond the box can sometimes be quite blurred, the recent successes of Wernig and others (reviewed by Chambers and Studer, 2011Chambers S.M. Studer L. Cell. 2011; 145: 827-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) suggest that this may be the most accessible route to future clinical applications.
