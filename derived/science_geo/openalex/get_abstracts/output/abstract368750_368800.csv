https://openalex.org/W2099163813,"P2X receptors are cation-selective ion channels gated by extracellular ATP, and are implicated in diverse physiological processes, from synaptic transmission to inflammation to the sensing of taste and pain. Because P2X receptors are not related to other ion channel proteins of known structure, there is at present no molecular foundation for mechanisms of ligand-gating, allosteric modulation and ion permeation. Here we present crystal structures of the zebrafish P2X(4) receptor in its closed, resting state. The chalice-shaped, trimeric receptor is knit together by subunit-subunit contacts implicated in ion channel gating and receptor assembly. Extracellular domains, rich in beta-strands, have large acidic patches that may attract cations, through fenestrations, to vestibules near the ion channel. In the transmembrane pore, the 'gate' is defined by an approximately 8 A slab of protein. We define the location of three non-canonical, intersubunit ATP-binding sites, and suggest that ATP binding promotes subunit rearrangement and ion channel opening."
https://openalex.org/W2058131133,"Brown adipose cells are specialized to dissipate chemical energy in the form of heat, as a physiological defence against cold and obesity. PRDM16 (PR domain containing 16) is a 140 kDa zinc finger protein that robustly induces brown fat determination and differentiation. Recent data suggests that brown fat cells arise in vivo from a Myf5-positive, myoblastic lineage by the action of PRDM16 (ref. 3); however, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this developmental switch is unclear. Here we show that PRDM16 forms a transcriptional complex with the active form of C/EBP-beta (also known as LAP), acting as a critical molecular unit that controls the cell fate switch from myoblastic precursors to brown fat cells. Forced expression of PRDM16 and C/EBP-beta is sufficient to induce a fully functional brown fat program in naive fibroblastic cells, including skin fibroblasts from mouse and man. Transplantation of fibroblasts expressing these two factors into mice gives rise to an ectopic fat pad with the morphological and biochemical characteristics of brown fat. Like endogenous brown fat, this synthetic brown fat tissue acts as a sink for glucose uptake, as determined by positron emission tomography with fluorodeoxyglucose. These data indicate that the PRDM16-C/EBP-beta complex initiates brown fat formation from myoblastic precursors, and may provide opportunities for the development of new therapeutics for obesity and type-2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2034352765,"Acid-sensing ion channels are proton-activated, sodium-selective channels composed of three subunits, and are members of the superfamily of epithelial sodium channels, mechanosensitive and FMRF-amide peptide-gated ion channels. These ubiquitous eukaryotic ion channels have essential roles in biological activities as diverse as sodium homeostasis, taste and pain. Despite their crucial roles in biology and their unusual trimeric subunit stoichiometry, there is little knowledge of the structural and chemical principles underlying their ion channel architecture and ion-binding sites. Here we present the structure of a functional acid-sensing ion channel in a desensitized state at 3 A resolution, the location and composition of the approximately 8 A 'thick' desensitization gate, and the trigonal antiprism coordination of caesium ions bound in the extracellular vestibule. Comparison of the acid-sensing ion channel structure with the ATP-gated P2X(4) receptor reveals similarity in pore architecture and aqueous vestibules, suggesting that there are unanticipated yet common structural and mechanistic principles."
https://openalex.org/W2019090872,"Background Tumor-infiltrating T cells are associated with survival in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), but their functional status is poorly understood, especially relative to the different risk categories and histological subtypes of EOC. Methodology/Principal Findings Tissue microarrays containing high-grade serous, endometrioid, mucinous and clear cell tumors were analyzed immunohistochemically for the presence of lymphocytes, dendritic cells, neutrophils, macrophages, MHC class I and II, and various markers of activation and inflammation. In high-grade serous tumors from optimally debulked patients, positive associations were seen between intraepithelial cells expressing CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45RO, CD25, TIA-1, Granzyme B, FoxP3, CD20, and CD68, as well as expression of MHC class I and II by tumor cells. Disease-specific survival was positively associated with the markers CD8, CD3, FoxP3, TIA-1, CD20, MHC class I and class II. In other histological subtypes, immune infiltrates were less prevalent, and the only markers associated with survival were MHC class II (positive association in endometrioid cases) and myeloperoxidase (negative association in clear cell cases). Conclusions/Significance Host immune responses to EOC vary widely according to histological subtype and the extent of residual disease. TIA-1, FoxP3 and CD20 emerge as new positive prognostic factors in high-grade serous EOC from optimally debulked patients."
https://openalex.org/W2050111191,"Mediterranean climate is found on five continents and supports five global biodiversity hotspots. Based on combined downscaled results from 23 atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) for three emissions scenarios, we determined the projected spatial shifts in the mediterranean climate extent (MCE) over the next century. Although most AOGCMs project a moderate expansion in the global MCE, regional impacts are large and uneven. The median AOGCM simulation output for the three emissions scenarios project the MCE at the end of the 21(st) century in Chile will range from 129-153% of its current size, while in Australia, it will contract to only 77-49% of its current size losing an area equivalent to over twice the size of Portugal. Only 4% of the land area within the current MCE worldwide is in protected status (compared to a global average of 12% for all biome types), and, depending on the emissions scenario, only 50-60% of these protected areas are likely to be in the future MCE. To exacerbate the climate impact, nearly one third (29-31%) of the land where the MCE is projected to remain stable has already been converted to human use, limiting the size of the potential climate refuges and diminishing the adaptation potential of native biota. High conversion and low protection in projected stable areas make Australia the highest priority region for investment in climate-adaptation strategies to reduce the threat of climate change to the rich biodiversity of the mediterranean biome."
https://openalex.org/W2137411342,"This paper questions the need for reinforcement learning or control theory when optimising behaviour. We show that it is fairly simple to teach an agent complicated and adaptive behaviours using a free-energy formulation of perception. In this formulation, agents adjust their internal states and sampling of the environment to minimize their free-energy. Such agents learn causal structure in the environment and sample it in an adaptive and self-supervised fashion. This results in behavioural policies that reproduce those optimised by reinforcement learning and dynamic programming. Critically, we do not need to invoke the notion of reward, value or utility. We illustrate these points by solving a benchmark problem in dynamic programming; namely the mountain-car problem, using active perception or inference under the free-energy principle. The ensuing proof-of-concept may be important because the free-energy formulation furnishes a unified account of both action and perception and may speak to a reappraisal of the role of dopamine in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W1969071483,"The presenilin genes have been genetically associated with familial cases of Alzheimer's disease but where they operate and what they do in neurons has been unclear. Zhang et al. demonstrate in mouse models that presinilins act in the presynaptic compartment to control activity-dependent neurotransmitter release, a process essential to neuronal computation, learning and memory. These findings suggest that presynaptic dysfunction might be an early cause of dementia in neurodegenerative disorders. Mutations in the presenilin genes are associated with familial cases of Alzheimer's disease, but the precise site and nature of the synaptic dysfunction remain unknown. Using a genetic approach to selectively inactivate presenilins in a mouse model, it has been possible to demonstrate that they act in the presynaptic compartment to control the activity-dependent efficacy of neurotransmitter release, a process essential for neuronal computation, learning and memory. Mutations in the presenilin genes are the main cause of familial Alzheimer’s disease. Loss of presenilin activity and/or accumulation of amyloid-β peptides have been proposed to mediate the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease by impairing synaptic function1,2,3,4,5. However, the precise site and nature of the synaptic dysfunction remain unknown. Here we use a genetic approach to inactivate presenilins conditionally in either presynaptic (CA3) or postsynaptic (CA1) neurons of the hippocampal Schaeffer-collateral pathway. We show that long-term potentiation induced by theta-burst stimulation is decreased after presynaptic but not postsynaptic deletion of presenilins. Moreover, we found that presynaptic but not postsynaptic inactivation of presenilins alters short-term plasticity and synaptic facilitation. The probability of evoked glutamate release, measured with the open-channel NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptor antagonist MK-801, is reduced by presynaptic inactivation of presenilins. Notably, depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores by thapsigargin, or blockade of Ca2+ release from these stores by ryanodine receptor inhibitors, mimics and occludes the effects of presynaptic presenilin inactivation. Collectively, these results indicate a selective role for presenilins in the activity-dependent regulation of neurotransmitter release and long-term potentiation induction by modulation of intracellular Ca2+ release in presynaptic terminals, and further suggest that presynaptic dysfunction might be an early pathogenic event leading to dementia and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease."

https://openalex.org/W2057891171,"Background Inappropriate taxon definitions may have severe consequences in many areas. For instance, biologically sensible species delimitation of plant pathogens is crucial for measures such as plant protection or biological control and for comparative studies involving model organisms. However, delimiting species is challenging in the case of organisms for which often only molecular data are available, such as prokaryotes, fungi, and many unicellular eukaryotes. Even in the case of organisms with well-established morphological characteristics, molecular taxonomy is often necessary to emend current taxonomic concepts and to analyze DNA sequences directly sampled from the environment. Typically, for this purpose clustering approaches to delineate molecular operational taxonomic units have been applied using arbitrary choices regarding the distance threshold values, and the clustering algorithms. Methodology Here, we report on a clustering optimization method to establish a molecular taxonomy of Peronospora based on ITS nrDNA sequences. Peronospora is the largest genus within the downy mildews, which are obligate parasites of higher plants, and includes various economically important pathogens. The method determines the distance function and clustering setting that result in an optimal agreement with selected reference data. Optimization was based on both taxonomy-based and host-based reference information, yielding the same outcome. Resampling and permutation methods indicate that the method is robust regarding taxon sampling and errors in the reference data. Tests with newly obtained ITS sequences demonstrate the use of the re-classified dataset in molecular identification of downy mildews. Conclusions A corrected taxonomy is provided for all Peronospora ITS sequences contained in public databases. Clustering optimization appears to be broadly applicable in automated, sequence-based taxonomy. The method connects traditional and modern taxonomic disciplines by specifically addressing the issue of how to optimally account for both traditional species concepts and genetic divergence."
https://openalex.org/W2113939000,"Alarm substances are airborne chemical signals, released by an individual into the environment, which communicate emotional stress between conspecifics. Here we tested whether humans, like other mammals, are able to detect emotional stress in others by chemosensory cues. Sweat samples collected from individuals undergoing an acute emotional stressor, with exercise as a control, were pooled and presented to a separate group of participants (blind to condition) during four experiments. In an fMRI experiment and its replication, we showed that scanned participants showed amygdala activation in response to samples obtained from donors undergoing an emotional, but not physical, stressor. An odor-discrimination experiment suggested the effect was primarily due to emotional, and not odor, differences between the two stimuli. A fourth experiment investigated behavioral effects, demonstrating that stress samples sharpened emotion-perception of ambiguous facial stimuli. Together, our findings suggest human chemosensory signaling of emotional stress, with neurobiological and behavioral effects."

https://openalex.org/W2042993576,"Functional absence of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) causes the fragile X syndrome, a hereditary form of mental retardation characterized by a change in dendritic spine morphology. The RNA-binding protein FMRP has been implicated in regulating postsynaptic protein synthesis. Here we have analyzed whether the abundance of scaffold proteins and neurotransmitter receptor subunits in postsynaptic densities (PSDs) is altered in the neocortex and hippocampus of FMRP-deficient mice. Whereas the levels of several PSD components are unchanged, concentrations of Shank1 and SAPAP scaffold proteins and various glutamate receptor subunits are altered in both adult and juvenile knock-out mice. With the exception of slightly increased hippocampal SAPAP2 mRNA levels in adult animals, altered postsynaptic protein concentrations do not correlate with similar changes in total and synaptic levels of corresponding mRNAs. Thus, loss of FMRP in neurons appears to mainly affect the translation and not the abundance of particular brain transcripts. Semi-quantitative analysis of RNA levels in FMRP immunoprecipitates showed that in the mouse brain mRNAs encoding PSD components, such as Shank1, SAPAP1–3, PSD-95, and the glutamate receptor subunits NR1 and NR2B, are associated with FMRP. Luciferase reporter assays performed in primary cortical neurons from knock-out and wild-type mice indicate that FMRP silences translation of Shank1 mRNAs via their 3′-untranslated region. Activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors relieves translational suppression. As Shank1 controls dendritic spine morphology, our data suggest that dysregulation of Shank1 synthesis may significantly contribute to the abnormal spine development and function observed in brains of fragile X syndrome patients.

FMRP is an RNA-binding protein that is thought to act primarily as a repressor of mRNA translation. Among other subcellular regions in neurons, FMRP appears to exercise this control function at postsynaptic sites. It has been hypothesized that in dendrites FMRP locally controls the synthesis of proteins, such as components of the postsynaptic density (PSD), which regulate both dendritic spine morphology and synaptic function (2Bassell G.J.

The PSD is a complex protein network lying underneath the postsynaptic membrane of excitatory synapses (11Gundelfinger E.D. Boeckers T.M. Baron M.K. Bowie J.U. Trends Biochem.

It serves to cluster glutamate receptors and cell adhesion molecules, recruit signaling proteins, and anchor these components to the microfilament-based cytoskeleton in dendritic spines. To combine these functions, the central layers of the PSD consist of several scaffold proteins, such as members of the PSD-95, SAPAP/GKAP, and Shank/ProSAP families. Because of their capacity to directly interact with many different PSD components and to regulate the size and shape of dendritic spines, Shanks in particular are assumed to represent master scaffold proteins of the PSD (11Gundelfinger E.D. Boeckers T.M. Baron M.K. Bowie J.U. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 366-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Activity-dependent changes in the PSD composition are thought to represent a molecular basis for most principal brain functions, including learning and memory. Several of these long term synaptic changes and learning paradigms critically depend on dendritic protein synthesis (14Sutton M.A. Schuman E.M.

As FMRP has been implicated in the local regulation of mRNA translation at synapses, one crucial question is as follows: which postsynaptic proteins are affected by the loss of FMRP in a quantitative manner and may thus contribute to abnormal dendritic spine morphology and impaired synaptic plasticity? To specifically address this question, we took advantage of the possibility to isolate PSDs. In PSD fractions prepared from two major brain areas of wild-type and FMRP-deficient mice, we compared the levels of major scaffold proteins and glutamate receptor subunits. Thereby, we identified a select group of postsynaptic proteins, including the central scaffold protein Shank1, that are enriched in PSDs of FMRP-deficient mice. Functional data further suggest that FMRP represses translation of Shank1 transcripts in neurons via an interaction with its 3′-untranslated region (3′UTR). This translation block is abolished upon the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR). Thus, a deregulated postsynaptic synthesis of Shank1, a master scaffold protein of the PSD, may significantly contribute to the aberrant dendritic spine morphology caused by the absence of FMRP. Fmr1−/− mice (B6.129P2-Fmr1tmlCgr/J strain, The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were maintained on a C57BL/6J background. Tissue was dissected from different brain regions of adult male Fmr1−/− and congenic C57BL/6J wild-type mice raised in the animal facility of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf. Cortical neurons were prepared from mouse embryos (embryonic day 18) and grown in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen).

Results obtained from clustered experiments, such as those using identical PSD or RNA preparations, were analyzed with a linear mixed models application that considers the clustered structure of the experiment (SPSS 15.0.1, SPSS Inc., Chicago, 2006; level of significance α = 0.05). Total RNA from mouse brain cytosolic and synaptosome fractions was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and Northern blots were generated using the formaldehyde method (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). cDNA fragments containing nucleotides 259–408 and 23–1128 of the mouse PSD-95 (GenBankTM accession number NM_001109752) and human β-actin cDNA (DQ890960.2), respectively, were labeled with 32P-containing nucleotides using the Rediprime II labeling system (GE Healthcare) and used to probe blotted RNAs. Labeled bands were visualized using a BAS-1800II PhosphorImager (Fujifilm, Düsseldorf, Germany) and x-ray films (Kodak). Immunoprecipitations from brains of adult Fmr1−/− and wild-type mice with antibodies against FMRP and PABP as well as irrelevant IgG, extraction of RNA from immunoprecipitates, and real time RT-PCR were performed as described (36Iacoangeli A. Rozhdestvensky T.S. Dolzhanskaya N. Tournier B. Schütt J. Brosius J. Denman R.B. Khandjian E.W. Kindler S. Tiedge H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Reverse transcription (50 °C for 50 min) was directly followed by gene-specific amplification (initial strand separation at 94 °C for 15 min; 40 cycles of each at 94 °C for 15 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s). Transcript levels of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase were used for normalization as described (37Kurth I. Thompson D.A. Rüther K. Feathers K.L. Chrispell J.D. Schroth J. McHenry C.L.

Levels of PSD-95, SAP97, SAPAP1, SAPAP2, SAPAP3, Shank1, NR1, and GluR1 mRNAs were quantified using gene-specific primers as follows: PSD-95-fw (5′-GGCACCGACTACCCCACAG-3′) and PSD-95-rev (5′-AACACCATTGACCGACAGGA-3′); SAP97-fw (5′-AGTGACGAAGTCGGAGTGATT-3′) and SAP97-rev (5′-GTCAGGGATCTCCCCTTTATCT-3′); SAPAP1-fw (5′-CGTAAGTGAAGTCTCCATCAAC-3′) and SAPAP1-rev (5′-CTCGCTCACCTGACTTATGG-3′); SAPAP2-fw (5′-GACAGACAGACTGCGGATCG-3′) and SAPAP2-rev (5′-GCAGACATCCTTGGGCTTTC-3′); SAPAP3-fw (5′-ACTATTTGCAGGTGCCGCAAG-3′) and SAPAP3-rev (5′-GGGCTACCATCTGAGTCTCC-3′); Shank1-fw (5′-AGCCTGCAGCAGTGCCCAGCA-3′) and Shank1-rev (5′-ATGCGAGGCCGCCAGGCCCA-3′); NR1-fw (5′-AGCCAGGTCTACGCTATCC-3′) and NR1-rev (5′-TAGGGTGGTACGGTGCGAAG-3′); NR2B-fw (5′-AGAGGTGGTTGACTTCTCTGTGCC-3′) and NR2B-rev (5′-TGAAGTATTCAAAGACAAAGACAGC-3′); and GluR1-fw (5′-ACCACTACATCCTCGCCAAC-3′) and GluR1-rev (5′-TCACTTGTCCTCCACTGCTG-3′), respectively. The concentration of IRSp53 mRNA was quantified using the Mm_Baiap2_1_SG QuantiTect primer assay (QT01061431, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Data analysis was performed using REST-2005 software (38Pfaffl M.W. Horgan G.W. Dempfle L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pFiRe-basic, a derivative of pBicFire (39Pedersen S.K. Christiansen J. Hansen T.O. Larsen M.R. Nielsen F.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), contains two recombinant genes, both of which are controlled by independent cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoters and encode Photinus (PhoLuc) and Renilla luciferase (RenLuc), respectively. To create pFiRe-Shank1, the cDNA sequence in the PhoLuc gene of pFiRe-basic that encodes a short synthetic 3′UTR was exchanged for a cDNA region corresponding to nucleotides 6593–7180 of the rat Shank1 3′UTR (GenBankTM accession number NM_031751). To identify changes in the molecular framework of the PSD occurring in Fmr1−/− (knock-out) mice, we compared the levels of different scaffold proteins in PSD fractions prepared from neocortices and hippocampi of knock-out and wild-type animals. Successful enrichment of PSDs was documented by a strong increase in the levels of the N-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate receptor subunit NR1, a known PSD component, in successive steps of the purification protocol as compared with β-tubulin (a known contaminant of PSD fractions; Fig. 1A). Also, FMRP is clearly detectable in brain homogenates of wild-type but not FMRP knock-out animals (Fig. 1B). For the comparative analysis of PSD fractions, equal protein amounts were analyzed by Western blotting with specific antibodies (Fig. 1, C and E). Relative levels of individual proteins in the PSD of FMRP-deficient versus wild-type mice were determined by densitometric measurement of the respective immunochemical signal normalized to the β-tubulin signal intensity (Fig. 1, D and F). In neocortical and hippocampal PSD fractions obtained from 2-month-old animals, levels of PSD-95 and SAP102 were similar in FMRP-deficient and wild-type mice. The concentration of Shank1, however, was strongly increased in both the neocortex and hippocampus of FMRP-deficient as compared with wild-type animals. In contrast, SAPAP1 and Shank3 levels were only elevated in neocortical PSD preparations, whereas SAPAP2, SAPAP3, and IRSp53 concentrations were selectively increased in hippocampal PSD fractions prepared from knock-out animals. Finally, levels of SAP97 and Chapsyn were significantly decreased in neocortical but not hippocampal PSD preparations obtained from FMRP-deficient mice. In PSD fractions prepared from juvenile mouse brains (2 weeks after birth), some of these changes were already apparent, such as increases in neocortical levels of SAPAP1 and Shank1, an elevated concentration of SAPAP2 in the hippocampus, and a decrease in neocortical SAP97 levels. However, increases in hippocampal SAPAP3, Shank1, and IRSp53 concentrations were only observed in 2-month-old animals. One crucial function of scaffold proteins in the PSD is to anchor neurotransmitter receptors in the postsynaptic membrane. Thus, we also analyzed whether the observed changes in scaffold protein levels affect the abundance of glutamate receptors in the PSD (Fig. 1, C and D). As compared with wild-type mice, glutamate receptor subunits NR2A, GluR2/3, and GluR4 were slightly but not significantly enriched in PSD fractions of FMRP-deficient mice. In contrast, the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit NR1 was increased in both the neocortex and hippocampus of knock-out animals, whereas elevated levels of NR2B and GluR1 were only observed in the hippocampus and neocortex, respectively. Increases in NR1 and GluR1 levels were already apparent in juvenile FMRP-deficient mice, whereas postsynaptic NR2B concentrations appear to rise thereafter. Taken together, the loss of FMRP results in an increased abundance of the scaffold proteins SAPAP1, SAPAP2, SAPAP3, Shank1, and IRSp53 as well as the glutamate receptor subunits NR1, NR2B, and GluR1 at synapses. Although most changes become manifest until the end of the 2nd week after birth, others occur rather late during postnatal development. Moreover, the absence of FMRP affects some PSD components differentially in neocortical and hippocampal neurons, respectively. Next we wanted to determine whether altered levels of individual proteins at synapses of FMRP knock-out mice correlate with changes in the concentration of their corresponding mRNAs. Thus, we first sought to establish a control mRNA whose levels are identical in the brains of FMRP-deficient and wild-type mice. A Northern blot analysis carried out with total RNA extracted from the neocortex showed that PSD-95 mRNA levels are identical in the cortex of FMRP-deficient and wild-type mice (Fig. 2A). This result was confirmed by real time RT-PCR analysis with template RNA extracted from both the neocortex and hippocampus of knock-out and wild-type animals (Fig. 2B) and is consistent with stable postsynaptic PSD-95 levels in both brain regions as described above (Fig. 1, C–F). Real time RT-PCR data further showed that the total levels of SAP97, SAPAP1, SAPAP3, Shank1, IRSp53, NR1, NR2B, and GluR1 mRNAs in both neocortex and hippocampus of 2-week- and 2-month-old animals are essentially identical in FMRP-deficient and wild-type mice (Fig. 2, B and C). Only SAPAP2 transcript levels in the adult hippocampus were significantly increased in knock-out animals (1.69-fold; p = 0.001, mixed models). Adult neocortical and juvenile hippocampal and neocortical SAPAP2 mRNA concentrations were unchanged in FMRP-deficient mice as compared with wild-type mice. Thus, although an increase in hippocampal SAPAP2 transcript levels may contribute to a similar rise in SAPAP2 concentrations in Fmr1−/− mice as compared with wild-type mice, the changes in the levels of other postsynaptic proteins in knock-out animals described herein do not appear to result from an altered abundance of the corresponding mRNAs in the absence of FMRP. To assess whether local mRNA concentrations at synapses may be affected by the loss of FMRP, we used total RNA extracted from both neocortical and hippocampal synaptosome fractions as a template for real time RT-PCR. The observation that well established dendritic transcripts, such as Shank1, SAPAP3, and αCaMKII mRNAs (18Böckers T.M. Segger-Junius M. Iglauer P. Bockmann J. Gundelfinger E.D. Kreutz M.R. Richter D.

Real time RT-PCR analysis further revealed that synaptic levels of PSD-95, SAP97, SAPAP1, SAPAP2, SAPAP3, Shank1, IRSp53, NR1, NR2B, and GluR1 mRNAs in both the neocortex and the hippocampus are essentially identical in FMRP-deficient and wild-type mice (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these data suggest that the loss of FMRP does not primarily alter the total and synaptic abundance of mRNAs encoding postsynaptic scaffold proteins and glutamate receptor subunits, whereas it selectively affects the synaptic levels of particular PSD components in cortical and hippocampal neurons. Over the recent years, consensus has been developed that FMRP most likely acts as a regulator of translation (1Bardoni B. Davidovic L. Bensaid M. Khandjian E.W. Expert Rev. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2026148775,"We have investigated the ability of different regions of the left arm of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome V to participate in the formation of gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs). We found that the 4.2-kilobase HXT13-DSF1 region sharing divergent homology with chromosomes IV, X and XIV, similar to mammalian segmental duplications, was ‘at risk’ for participating in duplication-mediated GCRs generated by homologous recombination. Numerous genes and pathways, including SGS1, TOP3, RMI1, SRS2, RAD6, SLX1, SLX4, SLX5, MSH2, MSH6, RAD10 and the DNA replication stress checkpoint requiring MRC1 and TOF1, were highly specific for suppressing these GCRs compared to GCRs mediated by single-copy sequences. These results indicate that the mechanisms for formation and suppression of rearrangements occurring in regions containing at-risk sequences differ from those occurring in regions of single-copy sequence. This explains how extensive genome instability is prevented in eukaryotic cells whose genomes contain numerous divergent repeated sequences. The human genome contains many types of repeated 'at risk' sequences liable to cause genomic rearrangement and instability, some with the potential to cause cancer and other diseases. The cell utilizes various proteins to ensure that such instability occurs very infrequently. A study of the left arm of chromosome V of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has pinpointed a large number of the genes that can prevent such rearrangements. Surprisingly, there are distinct pathways for suppressing rearrangements mediated by either single copy sequences, or repetitive 'at risk' sequences. The human genome contains numerous types of repeated 'at risk' sequences that can cause genomic rearrangements and instability. Various proteins are used to ensure that this occurs very infrequently. Here, a comprehensive analysis of the factors involved in suppressing gross chromosomal rearrangements in Saccharomyces cerevisiae shows that there are distinct pathways for suppressing rearrangements mediated by single copy sequences versus repetitive 'at risk' sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2016301107,"Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 (AKR1B10) is primarily expressed in the normal human colon and small intestine but overexpressed in liver and lung cancer. Our previous studies have shown that AKR1B10 mediates the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase-alpha. In this study, we demonstrate that AKR1B10 is critical to cell survival. In human colon carcinoma cells (HCT-8) and lung carcinoma cells (NCI-H460), small-interfering RNA-induced AKR1B10 silencing resulted in caspase-3-mediated apoptosis. In these cells, the total and subspecies of cellular lipids, particularly of phospholipids, were decreased by more than 50%, concomitant with 2-3-fold increase in reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial cytochrome c efflux, and caspase-3 cleavage. AKR1B10 silencing also increased the levels of alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyls, leading to the 2-3-fold increase of cellular lipid peroxides. Supplementing the HCT-8 cells with palmitic acid (80 mum), the end product of fatty acid synthesis, partially rescued the apoptosis induced by AKR1B10 silencing, whereas exposing the HCT-8 cells to epalrestat, an AKR1B10 inhibitor, led to more than 2-fold elevation of the intracellular lipid peroxides, resulting in apoptosis. These data suggest that AKR1B10 affects cell survival through modulating lipid synthesis, mitochondrial function, and oxidative status, as well as carbonyl levels, being an important cell survival protein."
https://openalex.org/W1997670777,"Background In-vitro expansion of functional beta cells from adult human islets is an attractive approach for generating an abundant source of cells for beta-cell replacement therapy of diabetes. Using genetic cell-lineage tracing we have recently shown that beta cells cultured from adult human islets undergo rapid dedifferentiation and proliferate for up to 16 population doublings. These cells have raised interest as potential candidates for redifferentiation into functional insulin-producing cells. Previous work has associated dedifferentiation of cultured epithelial cells with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and suggested that EMT generates cells with stem cell properties. Here we investigated the occurrence of EMT in these cultures and assessed their stem cell potential. Methodology/Principal Findings Using cell-lineage tracing we provide direct evidence for occurrence of EMT in cells originating from beta cells in cultures of adult human islet cells. These cells express multiple mesenchymal markers, as well as markers associated with mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). However, we do not find evidence for the ability of such cells, nor of cells in these cultures derived from a non-beta-cell origin, to significantly differentiate into mesodermal cell types. Conclusions/Significance These findings constitute the first demonstration based on genetic lineage-tracing of EMT in cultured adult primary human cells, and show that EMT does not induce multipotency in cells derived from human beta cells."

Plasmodium falciparum dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (PfDHODH) was validated as a new drug target through the identification of potent and selective triazolopyrimidine-based DHODH inhibitors with anti-malarial activity in vivo. Here we report x-ray structure determination of PfDHODH bound to three inhibitors from this series, representing the first of the enzyme bound to malaria specific inhibitors. We demonstrate that conformational flexibility results in an unexpected binding mode identifying a new hydrophobic pocket on the enzyme. Importantly this plasticity allows PfDHODH to bind inhibitors from different chemical classes and to accommodate inhibitor modifications during lead optimization, increasing the value of PfDHODH as a drug target. A second discovery, based on small molecule crystallography, is that the triazolopyrimidines populate a resonance form that promotes charge separation. These intrinsic dipoles allow formation of energetically favorable H-bond interactions with the enzyme. The importance of delocalization to binding affinity was supported by site-directed mutagenesis and the demonstration that triazolopyrimidine analogs that lack this intrinsic dipole are inactive.

Despite intensive efforts to control malaria through combination drug therapy and insect control programs, malaria remains one of the largest global health problems. The most severe form of the disease is caused by Plasmodium falciparum, which kills 1–2 million people yearly, primarily children and pregnant woman. Effective vaccines have not been developed, and chemotherapy remains the mainstay of both treatment and prevention of the disease. Unfortunately widespread drug resistance to almost every known anti-malarial agent has compromised the effectiveness of malaria control programs (3White N.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 1084-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). The introduction of artemisinin combination chemotherapy has provided new treatment options to combat drug-resistant parasites (4Rosenthal P.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 358: 1829-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, recent reports by the World Health Organization suggest that resistance to artemisinin is developing along the Thai-Cambodian border, underscoring the need for a continual pipeline of new drug development to combat this disease.The malaria parasite relies exclusively on de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis to supply precursors for DNA and RNA biosynthesis (5Gutteridge W.E.

In contrast, the human host cells contain the enzymatic machinery for both de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis and for salvage of preformed pyrimidine bases and nucleosides. The lack of a redundant mechanism to acquire pyrimidines in malaria has raised interest in this pathway as a potential source for new therapeutic targets.

These compounds are competitive with CoQ and inhibit the CoQ-dependent oxidation of FMN while not affecting the FMN-dependent oxidation of DHO. Site-directed mutagenesis data supported a model whereby the CoQ-binding site does not overlap with the inhibitor site, but instead inhibitors either block electron transfer between FMN and CoQ or stabilize a conformation that excludes CoQ binding (18Phillips M.A. Gujjar R.

Of the identified inhibitors, one promising series has emerged based on a triazolopyrimidine core structure (see Fig. 1 and Table 1). PfDHODH inhibitors in this class show potent nanomolar activity against P. falciparum in vitro, with excellent correlation observed between inhibition of PfDHODH and activity against the parasite (17Gujjar R.

Phillips M.A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 2466-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), neither explains the ability of PfDHODH to bind the array of identified inhibitors nor provides an understanding of the developing SAR for the triazolopyrimidine-based inhibitor series.Here we report the x-ray structures of PfDHODH bound to three triazolopyrimidine-based inhibitors with different sized substituents bound to the triazolopyrimidine core. In addition, we examined the small molecule x-ray structures of these inhibitors and compared them with the protein-bound ligand structures. Finally, the inhibitor-bound PfDHODH structures were compared with the structures of hDHODH bound to A77 1726 and to brequinar, a potent 4-quinolinecarboxylic acid inhibitor of the human enzyme (25Lakaschus G. Löffler M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 26DeLano W.L. The Pymol Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2000Google Scholar). Together these studies explain both the high affinity binding and species selectivity of this important class of PfDHODH inhibitors, thus laying the foundation for future lead optimization programs for the present anti-malarial agents. More broadly, this study provides new, unexpected insight into why PfDHODH is a highly attractive drug target for a large set of diverse chemical entities with potential for sustainable, robust lead optimization programs.DISCUSSIONMalaria remains one of the most significant global health problems because of wide spread drug resistance compromising current chemotherapies. One of the greatest challenges in developing new anti-malarial agents is the identification of novel targets that will allow the discovery of unexplored chemical scaffolds. Our discovery of the triazolopyrimidine-based inhibitors of PfDHODH has led to the validation of PfDHODH as a target for the development of new anti-malarials and to the identification of a novel chemical class with in vivo anti-malarial activity (17Gujjar R. Marwaha A. El Mazouni F. White J. White K.L. Creason S. Shackleford D.M. Baldwin J. Charman W.N. Buckner F.S. Charman S. Rathod P.K. Phillips M.A. J. Med.

Chem. 2008; 51: 3649-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Here we report the x-ray structures of PfDHODH bound to three triazolopyrimidine-based inhibitors. First, these data show that structural plasticity allows the triazolopyrimidine-based inhibitors to access an unexpected hydrophobic binding pocket that was not observed in previous structures. This structural flexibility allows the target to accommodate a range of inhibitors from different structural classes. A second unexpected insight was gained by comparison of the small molecule x-ray structures of the inhibitors with the protein-bound ligand structures. The intrinsic electronic configuration of the triazolopyrimidine ring favors charge delocalization from N-1 to N-5, providing significant insight into the emerging SAR of the triazolopyrimidine-based series. Finally, the variability in amino acid sequence between the human and malaria DHODH inhibitor-binding sites leads to species-selective inhibitor binding modes that explain the selectivity of the triazolopyrimidine-based inhibitors.The malaria enzyme has the flexibility to form two different inhibitor-binding pockets (Pfnaphthyl pocket and the PfA77 phenyl pocket). This flexibility is likely to underlie the finding that multiple inhibitor series have been reported for PfDHODH that sample diverse chemical space (17Gujjar R. Marwaha A. El Mazouni F. White J.

Although the triazolopyrimidine derivatives interact with the Pfnaphthyl pocket, other identified inhibitors are likely to bind to the PfA77 phenyl pocket, explaining how the enzyme can accommodate these wide ranging scaffolds. Additionally local flexibility within the Pfnaphthyl pocket contributes to the ability of this pocket to bind ligands of variable size. Flexibility in inhibitor binding modes has also been observed in hDHODH associated with conformational changes in the position of hArg136 and hGln47 (42Baumgartner R. Walloschek M. Kralik M. Gotschlich A. Tasler S. Mies J. Leban J. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 1239-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the N-terminal helix (α1) (11Olsen N.J. Stein C.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 2167-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) and a loop (hLeu68–hArg72) postulated to perform a gate keeper function (43Walse B. Dufe V.T. Svensson B. Fritzson I. Dahlberg L. Khairoullina A. Wellmar U. Al-Karadaghi S. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 8929-8936Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus structural plasticity appears to be an inherent property of the DHODH enzyme family, enhancing the suitability of this enzyme as a drug target by creating many design options and reducing the risks or liabilities that would be associated with only a single chemical class. Additionally the ability of the enzyme to adapt to different analogs within a structural class provides sites for modification during lead optimization to improve pharmacological properties. Protein flexibility has been observed in a wide array of known drug targets (44McCammon J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1754: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 45Hornak V. Simmerling C. Drug Discov. Today. 2007; 12: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 46Teague S.J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2003; 2: 527-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), and protein dynamics is increasingly being incorporated into drug design strategies (47Amaro R.E. Baron R. McCammon J.A. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2008; 22: 693-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 48B-Rao C. Subramanian J. Sharma S.D. Drug Discov.

Pharm. 2008; 5: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus structural plasticity leading to binding of diverse inhibitor classes can be appreciated as an important property of high value drug targets guiding future target selection for drug discovery projects.Analysis of drug interactions that are involved in conformational changes in the target protein suggests that hydrophobic inhibitors can induce refolding of local regions of the binding pocket leading to high affinity interactions (46Teague S.J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2003; 2: 527-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). This suggests that the triazolopyrimidine-based inhibitors induce a refolding of the aromatic network by reorienting Phe188 and allowing the naphthyl-functionality to insert into an extended edge-to-face stacking network that runs through the protein. Alternatively the inhibitors may selectively bind and stabilize a pre-existing conformation of the aromatic network that is part of the native state ensemble but that has not previously been observed. Aromatic edge-to-face stacking interactions provide additional binding energy beyond a typical van der Waal's contact (52Burley S.K. Petsko G.A. Science. 1985; 229: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (2219) Google Scholar) as has been observed previously for potent binding of carboxypeptidase inhibitors (53Kim H. Lipscomb W.N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8171-8180Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Our data support a role for these interactions in inhibitor binding to PfDHODH because mutation of residues in this network (Phe227 and Phe188) resulted in a significant reduction in binding affinity.The intrinsic electronic properties of the triazolopyrimidine ring allow it to populate a resonance form that promotes charge separation, which is key to the formation of H-bond interactions with the enzyme. The importance of these ion pair interactions to inhibitor potency is supported both by the site-directed mutagenesis data and by the chemical modification of the inhibitor. When N-1 is replaced with atoms that are unable to delocalize electrons into the triazolopyrimidine ring (S or O), the IC50 increases by >4.4 kcal/mol. Interestingly mutation of His185 or Arg265 each reduced the binding affinity by 2–3 kcal/mol, suggesting that if the contributions of these two residues are additive, the loss in binding energy by replacing the bridging nitrogen with S or O is equivalent to losing both interactions.The x-ray structures of PfDHODH bound to the triazolopyrimidine-based inhibitors represent the first structural studies of the malarial enzyme bound to malaria-specific inhibitors, and as such they provide considerable new insight into species selective binding in this enzyme family. The inhibitor-binding pocket can be divided into site A (the H-bond pocket), which forms H-bonding interactions with the bound inhibitors, and site B, which is entirely hydrophobic (Fig. 4C). Both malaria and human-specific inhibitors interact with site A. Species selectivity of inhibitor binding arises from differences in the orientation of site B relative to site A within the protein structure. These differences have their basis in the species-specific amino acid composition of the inhibitor-binding pockets. For the triazolopyrimidine analogs, specificity for PfDHODH arises from the projection of an aromatic side chain from the N-1 position into the Pfnaphthyl pocket, which is blocked in the human structure. Whereas for brequinar the presence of the biphenyl group on the equivalent position to C-2 of DSM1 allows good interaction with the h_hydrophobic pocket, this orientation cannot be accommodated by either the site B-binding pocket on PfDHODH. The structural basis for differential binding of A77 1726 is similar. The fact that residues that form H-bonds with the triazolopyrimidine ring (PfHis185 and PfArg265) are conserved in the human enzyme suggests inhibitors of hDHODH could also be developed based on this core scaffold.The x-ray structures of PfDHODH bound to the triazolopyrimdine inhibitors provide significant insight into the observed SAR for this series. In addition to explaining the loss of activity upon replacing the bridging nitrogen N-1 with S or O, several other aspects of the SAR (17Gujjar R. Marwaha A. El Mazouni F. White J. White K.L. Creason S. Shackleford D.M. Baldwin J. Charman W.N. Buckner F.S. Charman S. Rathod P.K. Phillips M.A. J. Med.

Chem. 2008; 51: 3649-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) can now be readily understood. First we have observed that when the aromatic group is a phenyl, para substitutions yield good binding potency, whereas ortho substitutions are completely inactive. The PfDHODH-DSM74 structure shows that the ortho carbon atoms are 4.1 Å from the carbonyl oxygen of His185 on one side and 4.0Å from the CD1 of Leu172 on the other. Thus based on the current structures there is not space in the pocket to accommodate ortho substituents, nor apparently is this region of the binding pocket capable of the conformational flexibility that would be needed to accommodate this substitution. Second, the completely hydrophobic nature of the Pfnaphthyl pocket explains why aromatic rings containing heteroatoms show reduced potency. Third, the close interaction between His185 and the bridging nitrogen N-1 explains why a secondary nitrogen is required at this position and why the addition of a third substituent on the nitrogen reduces potency. Finally, the potential for stacking interactions between Phe227 and Phe188, in addition to the hydrophobic nature of the pocket, explains why large aromatic groups are favored.In summary, x-ray structure determination of PfDHODH in complex to three triazolopyrimidine-based inhibitors has provided insight into the structural basis for potent and species-selective binding of this series of inhibitors. It has advanced our understanding of the emerging SAR for this promising lead series. Ongoing efforts to improve the potency and in vivo properties of the triazolopyrimidine-lead series will be greatly aided by these studies. More broadly, the results have provided insight into the structural requirements for designing species-selective inhibitors of either malarial or human DHODH that can be applied to scaffolds beyond the triazolopyrimidine analogs. Finally, the advantages of attacking plastic active sites in lead optimization offer general lessons for prioritizing structure-based protein-ligand interactions for pharmaceutical applications.

The presence of a nuclear pool of glutathione has been demonstrated but its role in cellular proliferation and differentiation is still a matter of debate. Principal Findings We have studied proliferation of 3T3 fibroblasts for a period of 5 days. Cells were treated with two well known depleting agents, diethyl maleate (DEM) and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), and the cellular and nuclear glutathione levels were assessed by analytical and confocal microscopic techniques, respectively. Both agents decreased total cellular glutathione although depletion by BSO was more sustained. However, the nuclear glutathione pool resisted depletion by BSO but not with DEM. Interestingly, cell proliferation was impaired by DEM, but not by BSO. Treating the cells simultaneously with DEM and with glutathione ethyl ester to restore intracellular GSH levels completely prevented the effects of DEM on cell proliferation. Conclusions Our results demonstrate the importance of nuclear glutathione in the control of cell proliferation in 3T3 fibroblasts and suggest that a reduced nuclear environment is necessary for cells to progress in the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2081287349,"D-serine is an endogenous coagonist for the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor and is involved in excitatory neurotransmission in the brain. Mammalian pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent serine racemase, which is localized in the mammalian brain, catalyzes the racemization of L-serine to yield D-serine and vice versa. The enzyme also catalyzes the dehydration of D- and L-serine. Both reactions are enhanced by Mg.ATP in vivo. We have determined the structures of the following three forms of the mammalian enzyme homolog from Schizosaccharomyces pombe: the wild-type enzyme, the wild-type enzyme in the complex with an ATP analog, and the modified enzyme in the complex with serine at 1.7, 1.9, and 2.2 A resolution, respectively. On binding of the substrate, the small domain rotates toward the large domain to close the active site. The ATP binding site was identified at the domain and the subunit interface. Computer graphics models of the wild-type enzyme complexed with L-serine and D-serine provided an insight into the catalytic mechanisms of both reactions. Lys-57 and Ser-82 located on the protein and solvent sides, respectively, with respect to the cofactor plane, are acid-base catalysts that shuttle protons to the substrate. The modified enzyme, which has a unique ""lysino-D-alanyl"" residue at the active site, also exhibits catalytic activities. The crystal-soaking experiment showed that the substrate serine was actually trapped in the active site of the modified enzyme, suggesting that the lysino-D-alanyl residue acts as a catalytic base in the same manner as inherent Lys-57 of the wild-type enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2054506308,"Aged skeletal muscle is characterized by an increased incidence of metabolic and functional disorders, which if allowed to proceed unchecked can lead to increased morbidity and mortality. The mechanism(s) underlying the development of these disorders in aging skeletal muscle are not well understood. Protein kinase B (Akt/PKB) is an important regulator of cellular metabolism and survival, but it is unclear if aged muscle exhibits alterations in Akt function. Here we report a novel dysfunction of Akt in aging muscle, which may relate to S-nitrosylation and can be prevented by acetaminophen intervention.Compared to 6- and 27-month rats, the phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473 and Thr308) was higher in soleus muscles of very aged rats (33-months). Paradoxically, these increases in Akt phosphorylation were associated with diminished mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) phosphorylation, along with decreased levels of insulin receptor beta (IR-beta), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and phosphorylation of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) (Ser241). In vitro Akt kinase measurements and ex vivo muscle incubation experiments demonstrated age-related impairments of Akt kinase activity, which were associated with increases in Akt S-nitrosylation and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Impairments in Akt function occurred parallel to increases in myocyte apoptosis and decreases in myocyte size and the expression of myosin and actin. These age-related disorders were attenuated by treating aged (27-month) animals with acetaminophen (30 mg/kg body weight/day) for 6-months.These data demonstrate that Akt dysfunction and increased S-nitrosylation of Akt may contribute to age-associated disorders in skeletal muscle and that acetaminophen may be efficacious for the treatment of age-related muscle dysfunction."

Because RNase 7 exhibits high activity against Enterococcus faecium the aim of this study was to further explore the role of RNase 7 in the cutaneous innate defense system against E. faecium.Absolute quantification using real-time PCR and ELISA revealed that primary keratinocytes expressed high levels of RNase 7. Immunohistochemistry showed RNase 7 expression in all epidermal layers of the skin with an intensification in the upper more differentiated layers. Furthermore, RNase 7 was secreted by keratinocytes in vitro and in vivo in a site-dependent way. RNase 7 was still active against E. faecium at low pH (5.5) or high NaCl (150 mM) concentration and the bactericidal activity of RNase 7 against E. faecium required no ribonuclease activity as shown by recombinant RNase 7 lacking enzymatic activity. To further explore the role of RNase 7 in cutaneous defense against E. faecium, we investigated whether RNase 7 contributes to the E. faecium killing activity of skin extracts derived from stratum corneum. Treatment of the skin extract with an RNase 7 specific antibody, which neutralizes the antimicrobial activity of RNase 7, diminished its E. faecium killing activity.Our data indicate that RNase 7 contributes to the E. faecium-killing activity of skin extracts and suggest an important role for RNase 7 in the protection of human skin against E. faecium colonization."
https://openalex.org/W1985405072,"Whereas there is increasing evidence that loss of expression and/or function of the thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) could result in a selective advantage for tumor development, the relationship between thyroid hormone levels and human cancer is a controversial issue. It has been reported that hypothyroidism might be a possible risk factor for liver and breast cancer in humans, but a lower incidence of breast carcinoma has been also reported in hypothyroid patientsIn this work we have analyzed the influence of hypothyroidism on tumor progression and metastasis development using xenografts of parental and TRbeta1-expressing human hepatocarcinoma (SK-hep1) and breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-468). In agreement with our previous observations tumor invasiveness and metastasis formation was strongly repressed when TRbeta-expressing cells were injected into euthyroid nude mice. Whereas tumor growth was retarded when cells were inoculated into hypothyroid hosts, tumors had a more mesenchymal phenotype, were more invasive and metastatic growth was enhanced. Increased aggressiveness and tumor growth retardation was also observed with parental cells that do not express TRs.These results show that changes in the stromal cells secondary to host hypothyroidism can modulate tumor progression and metastatic growth independently of the presence of TRs on the tumor cells. On the other hand, the finding that hypothyroidism can affect differentially tumor growth and invasiveness can contribute to the explanation of the confounding reports on the influence of thyroidal status in human cancer."

We explored the function of syndecan-2 in melanoma, one of the most invasive types of cancers, and found that the expression of this protein was elevated in tissue samples from both nevus and malignant human melanomas but not in melanocytes of the normal human skin tissues. Similarly, elevated syndecan-2 expression was observed in various melanoma cell lines. Overexpression of syndecan-2 enhanced migration and invasion of melanoma cells, whereas the opposite was observed when syndecan-2 levels were knocked down using small inhibitory RNAs. Syndecan-2 expression was enhanced by fibroblast growth factor-2, which is known to stimulate melanoma cell migration; however, α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone decreased syndecan-2 expression and melanoma cell migration and invasion in a melanin synthesis-independent manner. Furthermore, syndecan-2 overexpression rescued the migration defects induced by α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone treatment. Together, these data strongly suggest that syndecan-2 plays a crucial role in the migratory potential of melanoma cells.

Together, these data strongly suggest that syndecan-2 plays a crucial role in the migratory potential of melanoma cells. The syndecans, a family of four transmembrane cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, mainly serving as a co-receptor, regulate the adhesion-dependent signal transduction of a variety of cell types, including cancer cells (1Bass M.D. Humphries M.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 2Sebestyén A. Tótth A. Mihalik R. Szakács O. Paku S. Kopper L. Tumour Biol. 2000; 21: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Cell adhesion receptors or co-receptors play a critical role in the neoplastic transformation of normal cells by regulating the induction of cancer-specific cellular behavior and morphology. Thus, cancer cells probably express and utilize a distinct set of syndecans in the regulation of cancer cell growth. Several reports have linked altered syndecan expression to various elements of cancer cell growth. Loss of syndecan-1 correlates with shorter survival times in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head, neck, and lung (3Park H. Kim Y. Lim Y. Han I. Oh E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29730-29736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) as well as multiple myeloma (4Purushothaman A. Chen L. Yang Y. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol.

Previous studies have shown that syndecan-1 regulates tumor activity in pancreatic (7Beauvais D.M. Rapraeger A.C. Reprod. Biol. Endocrinol. 2004; 2: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), gastric (8Kim Y. Park H. Lim Y. Han I. Kwon H.J. Woods A. Oh E.S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 9178-9185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Syndecan-1 may thus play multiple roles in tumorigenic activity and perform various tissue- and/or tumor stage-specific functions (10Kusano Y. Oguri K. Nagayasu Y. Munesue S. Ishihara M. Saiki I. Yonekura H. Yamamoto H. Okayama M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Syndecan-4 expression is reduced in colon carcinoma cells (11Wang H.B. Dembo M.

Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and appears to correlate with increased tumorigenic activity (e.g. cell migration and invasion (13Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J.

Syndecan-2 is also known to play a crucial role in the regulation of cancer activity. Increased levels of syndecan-2 confer an invasive phenotype in lung (14Nackaerts K. Verbeken E. Deneffe G. Vanderschueren B. Demedts M. David G. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 74: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and colon cancer cells (15Agochiya M. Brunton V.G. Owens D.W. Parkinson E.K. Paraskeva C. Keith W.N. Frame M.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5646-5653Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Reduction in syndecan-2 expression induces cells to switch from the transformed phenotype to flattened monolayers (8Kim Y. Park H. Lim Y. Han I. Kwon H.J. Woods A. Oh E.S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 826-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and reduces tumorigenic activity in colon adenocarcinoma and fibrosarcoma cells (8Kim Y. Park H. Lim Y. Han I. Kwon H.J.

Cancer. 1999; 82: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition, syndecan-2 is highly expressed in the microvasculature of mouse gliomas and has been shown to regulate angiogenesis in microvascular endothelial cells (17Fears C.Y. Gladson C.L. Woods A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14533-14536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). On the other hand, an inverse correlation between syndecan-2 expression and metastatic potential has been found in Lewis lung carcinoma cell lines (6Munesue S. Kusano Y. Oguri K. Itano N. Yoshitomi Y. Nakanishi H. Yamashina I. Okayama M. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, changes in syndecan-2 expression may directly or indirectly regulate cancer growth. Melanoma is the most aggressive malignant tumor of melanocytes. Although found predominantly in the skin, primary melanomas are also known to occur in the bowel and eye (18Markovic S.N. Erickson L.A. Rao R.D. Weenig R.H. Pockaj B.A. Bardia A. Vachon C.M.

Tsao H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2008; 128: 2575-2595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Therefore, identifying and understanding molecules that regulate the aggressive melanoma phenotype is essential for predicting the likelihood of metastasis. Interestingly, previous studies have shown that melanoma cells acquire the ability to recognize components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) 2The abbreviations used are: ECMextracellular matrixMSHmelanocyte-stimulating hormone(s)FGFfibroblast growth factorDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFAKfocal adhesion kinaseFBSfetal bovine serumPBSphosphate-buffered salinemAbmonoclonal antibodyBPEbovine pituitary extractsiRNAsmall interfering RNA. 2The abbreviations used are: ECMextracellular matrixMSHmelanocyte-stimulating hormone(s)FGFfibroblast growth factorDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFAKfocal adhesion kinaseFBSfetal bovine serumPBSphosphate-buffered salinemAbmonoclonal antibodyBPEbovine pituitary extractsiRNAsmall interfering RNA. via the ectopic expression of different ECM receptors during invasion of the basement membrane (20Hess A.R. Postovit L.M. Margaryan N.V. Seftor E.A. Schneider G.B. Seftor R.E. Nickoloff B.J. Hendrix M.J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 9851-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Indeed, invadopodia, the dynamic organelle-like structures that form actin-rich protrusions with ECM proteolytic activity, adhere to and digest collagens, laminins, and fibronectin (21Stylli S.S. Kaye A.H. Lock P. J. Clin. Neurosci. 2008; 15: 725-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The adhesive properties of invadopodia are primarily attributed to integrins, a large family of heterodimeric transmembrane receptors composed of α and β subunits (22Linder S. Aepfelbacher M. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 376-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). For example, β1 integrins localize within the invadopodia of melanoma cells (23Nakahara H. Nomizu M. Akiyama S.K. Yamada Y. Yeh Y. Chen W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27221-27224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and the α5β1 integrins are enriched peripherally in invadopodia, where they stabilize invadopodia protrusion (24Mueller S.C. Ghersi G. Akiyama S.K. Sang Q.X. Howard L. Pineiro-Sanchez M. Nakahara H. Yeh Y. Chen W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24947-24952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Ectopic stimulation of α6β1 integrin with laminin peptides or with β1 or α6 integrin stimulatory antibodies increases invadopodia activity and melanoma invasiveness (23Nakahara H. Nomizu M.

The invasive behavior of melanoma cells can be attributed to increased cell motility caused by changes in cytoskeletal organization and altered contacts with the ECM. Thus, cell adhesion receptors may play a crucial role in the acquisition of highly migratory behavior. extracellular matrix melanocyte-stimulating hormone(s) fibroblast growth factor Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium focal adhesion kinase fetal bovine serum phosphate-buffered saline monoclonal antibody bovine pituitary extract small interfering RNA. extracellular matrix melanocyte-stimulating hormone(s) fibroblast growth factor Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium focal adhesion kinase fetal bovine serum phosphate-buffered saline monoclonal antibody bovine pituitary extract small interfering RNA. Syndecan-2 acts as a key regulator of cancer cells, suggesting that syndecan-2 may contribute to the aggressive phenotype and metastatic potential of melanoma. Here, we report that syndecan-2 plays a pivotal role in the migratory activity of melanoma cells. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to vinculin, paxillin, and phosphotyrosine (4G10) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). mAb to focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and polyclonal antibodies to phosphorylation site-specific FAK(Tyr(P)397) and FAK(Tyr(P)861) were purchased from BioSource Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Inc. (Morgan Hill, CA). Monoclonal antibody to human melanosome (clone HMB-45) was purchased from Dako (Denmark). Effectene was from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany), bovine pituitary extract (BPE) was from Lonza (Visp, Switzerland), α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) was from Sigma, and the anti-Ig horseradish peroxidase detection kit was from BD Biosciences. mAb to syndecan-2 was produced by AdipoGen Inc. A portion of rat syndecan-2 cDNA representing the extracellular domain (S2E) was amplified by PCR and cloned upstream of human immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region (Fc) constructed in both pAGCF and pAGPCF2; the former utilized the natural leader sequence, whereas the latter used the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 leader peptide. The Fc fusion constructs were transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. DMEM serum-free medium was used to collect rat syndecan-2-Fc fusion protein from confluent cells for 2 days. The medium was harvested and spun down to remove cells, and the pH was adjusted to 8.0 with 1 m Tris. The medium was then filtered with a 0.4-μm filter and loaded onto a Protein A column, eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 3.0, and was immediately neutralized with one-tenth volume of 1 m Tris, pH 8.0. Both constructs yielded similar amounts of rat syndecan-2-Fc. BALB/c mice were repeatedly immunized with S2E-Fc fusion protein until the polyclonal sera from the immunized mice exhibited strong immune responses. Splenocytes were isolated from the mice and fused to mouse myeloma Sp2/0. Screening and single cell cloning were conformed to the established standard protocol. Ascites were prepared from the immunocompromised BALB/c mice. Immunoglobulin fractions were prepared through Protein G. One stable hybridoma clone (clone 197) secreting mAbs against syndecan-2 were obtained (Fig. 1). Specificity and cross-reactivity of the mAbs were determined by Western blot analysis, slot blot analysis, fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, and immunohistochemistry. Note that antibody 197 recognizes the extracellular domain of both human and rat syndecan-2. Cells were lysed with cold matrix buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 4 m urea, 20 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 4 mm benz-HCl, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% (v/v) Tween 20). After centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 4 °C, 10 min), the supernatant was applied onto DEAE-Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 4 m urea, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, washed with 30 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, containing 4 m urea, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 25 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 4.0, and then eluted with 15 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, containing 4 m guanidine HCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 4.0. Fractions were collected, and absorbance at 280 nm was measured. Protein-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against PBS. To remove glycosaminoglycan chains, samples were incubated with nitrous acid (HNO2) solution at pH 1.5, as previously described (25Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were designed targeting either human syndecan-2 or mouse syndecan-2, containing a 9-bp hairpin loop. Oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned into a pSUPER vector. Sequences of the primers are as follows: human syndecan-2 sense primer, 5′-GATCCCCTGACGATGACTACGCTTCTTTCAAGAGAACTGCTACTGATGCGAAGATTTTTGGAAA-3′; human syndecan-2 antisense primer, 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAATGACGATGACTACGCTTCTTCTCTTGAAACTGCTACTGATGCGAAGAGGG-3′; mouse syndecan-2 sense sequence, 5′-GGAGAAACAUUCAGACAAU-3′; mouse syndecan-2 antisense sequence, 5′-AUUGUCUGAAUGUUUCUCC-3′. Boldface characters indicate syndecan-2 sequences, and italics indicate the hairpin loop. Scrambled small interfering RNA (siGENOME non-targeting siRNA 2) was purchased from Dharmacon, Inc. (Chicago, IL). Total RNA extracted from cultured cells was used as template for reverse transcriptase reaction. Aliquots of cDNA were amplified using the following primers: rat syndecan-2 (forward), 5′-ATGCGGGTACGAGCCACGTC-3′; rat syndecan-2 (reverse) 5′-CGGGAGCAGCACTAGTGAGG-3′; rat β-actin (forward), 5′-TGGAATCCTGTGGCATCCATGAAA-3′; rat β-actin (reverse), 5′-TAAAACGCAGCTCAGTAACAGTCCG-3′. After the initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 60 s were carried out. The reaction products were analyzed in 1.5% agarose gels. The amplified DNA fragments were cloned and sequenced to confirm the PCR products. Human colon adenocarcinoma HT-29 and HCT116, human melanoma A375 and SK-MEL-28, mouse melanoma cells B16 and B16F10, and human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells were purchased from the Korean Cell Line Bank. HT-29 cells were maintained in McCoy's 5A complete medium (Invitrogen); A375, B16, B16F10, and HT1080 cells were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen); and SK-MEL-28 cells were maintained in RPMI (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) with gentamicin (50 μg/ml; Sigma) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Transient transfections were carried out using either Effectene reagent (Qiagen) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the provided manufacturer's instructions. HT29 (3 × 106) cells were trypsinized, harvested, washed twice with cold PBS, and then incubated with syndecan-2 cDNA on ice for 20 min. Transfections were carried out by electroporation using 0.2 kV, one pulse time, and 15 s of length). The G148-resistant clones were selected in 3 weeks. Syndecan-2 expression was assessed by reverse transcription-PCR using syndecan-2-specific primer. The cultures were washed twice with PBS, and the cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, denatured with SDS sample buffer, boiled, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For immunoprecipitations, each sample containing 200–1,000 μg of total protein was incubated with the relevant antibody for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads for 1 h. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation. The proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences) and probed with appropriate antibodies. The signals were detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Cells cultured in 60-mm diameter tissue culture dishes were washed with PBS and released by 1 mm EDTA, followed by the addition of 5% FBS in PBS. After pelleting, cells were resuspended in PBS and counted. Cells (1 × 106/ml) were incubated with anti-syndecan-2 antibody in 10% FBS in PBS for 1 h on 4 °C. After washing three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse antibody in 10% FBS in PBS for 30 min. Syndecan-2 expression was analyzed by flow cytometry. Gelatin (10 μg/ml) was added to each well of a Transwell plate (Costar; 8-μm pore size), and then the membranes were allowed to dry at 25 °C for 1 h. The Transwell plates were assembled in a 24-well plate, and the lower chambers were filled with FGF-2 (100 ng/ml) in fresh media. Cells (5 × 104) were added to each upper chamber, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 12 h. The cells that had migrated to the lower surface of the filters were stained with 0.6% hematoxylin and 0.5% eosin and counted. For in vitro invasion assays, 24-well Transwell plates (Costar; 8-μm pore size) were coated with gelatin (10 μg/ml) on the lower side of the membrane and with Matrigel (30 μg/μl) on the upper side. For in vivo experimental pulmonary metastasis assays, B16F10 melanoma cells (1 × 105 cells/mouse) were injected into a tail vein of C57BL/6 mice (n = 10) on day 0. On day 13, lungs were excised, and metastatic nodules were photographed. Two millimeter punch biopsies were obtained from patients who gave their informed consent in accordance with the policy of the Catholic Research Medical Institutional Review Board. The punch biopsies were taken from the malignant lesions and normal dermis of patients who visited the out-patient clinic. Biopsies were immediately frozen in the liquid nitrogen and kept at −70 °C until used for further analysis. Five sets of biopsies from patients were fixed in 10% neutralized buffered formalin for 24 h, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and deparaffinized for staining. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For immunostaining, the sections were rinsed, and endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide and 10% methanol in PBS, followed by preincubation in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 (PBS-T) and 3% bovine serum albumin for 2 h. The sections were then incubated for 16 h in PBS-T containing either anti-SDC2 antibody (1:1000) or anti-melanosome HMB-45 antibody (1:50). Following a wash with PBS, they were then rinsed and incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody (1:1,000; Dako, Denmark) in PBS-T containing 3% bovine serum albumin for 60 min at room temperature. The sections were subsequently rinsed and incubated with peroxidase-labeled streptavidin (Dako) for 60 min, followed by reaction with diaminobenzidine (0.5 mg/ml) and hydrogen peroxide. After rinsing, the sections were mounted, dehydrated, and covered with coverslips. All images were acquired with a Carl Zeiss Axioskop2. Melanoma cells were plated 60-mm tissue culture plates and incubated overnight. After one streak was made in the middle of the monolayer using a sterile pipette tip, the cells were washed twice with PBS and cultured in fresh media. Pictures of the wound distance were taken at various time points. Melanin contents were measured as reported by Kazuomi et al. (26Sato K. Takahashi H. Iraha R. Toriyama M. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2008; 31: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were treated with either 1.0 μm α-MSH or 200 μm Kojic acid in DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS for 48 h and then detached by incubation with trypsin/EDTA. After pelleting, cells were resuspended in DMEM for cell counting or solubilized into boiling 2 m NaOH for 20 min. After cooling to room temperature, the absorbance of the solution was measured at 405 nm for melanin content determination. Cell proliferation was measured by a colorimetric assay using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide as described (3Park H. Kim Y. Lim Y. Han I. Oh E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29730-29736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of syndecan-2 in the development of human skin melanoma, the expression of syndecan-2 was compared in tissues obtained from cutaneous malignancies and normal skin. Immunohistochemical studies revealed the absence of syndecan-2 expression in normal skin (Fig. 2A, b and c). On the other hand, we found that there was increased syndecan-2 expression in intradermal nevus (Fig. 2A, g and h). Interestingly, syndecan-2 expression was significantly increased in malignant melanomas (Fig. 2A, l and m) stained positively with melanoma marker HMB-45 in the adjacent slide (Fig. 2A, e, i, j, n, and o), whereas preimmune serum showed no staining except for the melanin granules in the malignant melanoma (Fig. 2A, d). Consistent with this observation, elevated cell surface expression of syndecan-2 was observed in human melanoma cell lines (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that syndecan-2 expression is increased in human melanoma cells. Syndecan-2 is known to play a critical role as an adhesion receptor during cell migration. To more directly assess the role of syndecan-2 in the regulation of tumorigenic activity, we examined the effects of syndecan-2 expression on melanoma cell migration. Human melanoma A375 cells were transfected with sdc2 (syndecan-2) cDNA, and a transwell migration assay was performed (Fig. 3A). After transfection with sdc2, both cell migration and invasion were significantly higher in A375 cells than in vector-transfected cells (vec in Fig. 3). In contrast, cell migration/invasion was decreased when syndecan-2 expression was suppressed by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (Fig. 3B). Consistent with the human melanoma cells, elevated cell surface expression of syndecan-2 was also observed in mouse melanoma cell lines (Fig. 4). Interestingly, B16F10 cells expressing higher levels of syndecan-2 migrated faster than B16 cells (Fig. 4A). Syndecan-2 overexpression enhanced the migration of mouse melanoma B16 cells, based on transwell migration (Fig. 4B) and wound healing assays (Fig. 4C), whereas cell migration decreased when syndecan-2 expression was suppressed by siRNAs (Fig. 4D). Similar results were observed using B16F10 cells (data not shown). Consistently, knockdown of syndecan-2 expression by siRNA reduced metastatic potential of B16F10 melanoma cells in mice (Fig. 4E). These findings strongly suggest that syndecan-2 regulates cell migration in melanoma cells.FIGURE 4Syndecan-2 regulates mouse melanoma cell migration. A, either B16 or B16F10 cells were incubated with an anti-syndecan-2 antibody, and the cell surface expression levels of syndecan-2 were analyzed by flow cytometry. IgG was used as a control (top). Cells (5 × 104) were loaded to migrate on Transwell plates, as described in the legend to Fig. 3 (bottom). B, B16 cells were transfected with sdc2 cDNA. Total RNA was extracted, and expression of syndecan-2 was analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was used as the loading control (top). Cells were incubated with an anti-syndecan-2 antibody, and the cell surface expression levels of syndecan-2 were analyzed by flow cytometry. IgG was used as a control (middle). Transwell migration assays were done with B16 cells transfected with 2 μg of the indicated cDNA, as described in the legend to Fig. 3 (bottom). C, B16 cells were transfected with sdc2 cDNA, and 24 h later, wound-healing assays were performed. One streak was made in the middle of the monolayer using a sterile pipette tip and pictures of the wound distance were taken at each time point. D, B16 cells were transfected with syndecan-2 siRNA. Cell surface expression levels of syndecan-2 were analyzed by flow cytometry. IgG was used as a control (top). Cells (5 × 104) were allowed to migrate on Transwell plates as described in the legend to Fig. 3 (bottom). E, B16F10 cells were transfected with syndecan-2 siRNA.

Accordingly, we found that total cellular tyrosine phosphorylation was enhanced in sdc2-overexpressing B16 melanoma cells. In particular, tyrosine phosphorylation of seven different polypeptides (i.e. p200, p125, p90, p64, p54, p44, and p42) was higher in cells transfected with sdc2 than in cells transfected with the control vector (Fig. 5A, left). Since enhanced tyrosyl phosphorylation mediated by FAK often happens in response to stimulation of cell migration (29Park H. Han I. Kwon H.J. Oh E.S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 9899-9905Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the same membrane was stripped and reprobed with antibodies against FAK or paxillin, a well known substrate of FAK (30Schaller M.D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6459-6472Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). FAK was detected at the position of p125, and paxillin was detected at the position of p64 (Fig. 5A, right), suggesting involvement of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation. Indeed, sdc2 expression increased autophosphorylation at tyrosine 397 (i.e. Tyr397), phosphorylation of FAK at tyrosine 861 (known to regulate cell transformation) (Fig. 5B), and tyrosyl phosphorylation of paxillin (Fig. 5C). These data indicate that syndecan-2-induced migration activity is intimately associated with the activation of FAK-mediated signaling. The previous study demonstrated the stimulatory effects of FGF-2 on melanoma cell migration (31Meier F. Caroli U. Satyamoorthy K. Schittek B. Bauer J. Berking C. Möller H. Maczey E. Rassner G. Herlyn M. Garbe C. Exp. Dermatol. 2003; 12: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In parallel with increased cell migration, FGF-2 caused increased cell surface expression of syndecan-2 (Fig. 6A), suggesting that syndecan-2 expression correlates with FGF-2-enhanced cell migration. BPE is routinely used as a mitogenic supplement in growth media for human melanocytes (32Donatien P. Surlève-Bazeille J.E. Thody A.J. Taïeb A. Arch. Dermatol.

https://openalex.org/W2099414457,"Vitiligo is characterized by a patchy loss of inherited skin color affecting ̃0.5% of individuals of all races. Despite the absence of the protecting pigment and the overwhelming evidence for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative stress in the entire epidermis of these patients, there is neither increased photodamage/skin aging nor a higher incidence for sun-induced nonmelanoma skin cancer. Here we demonstrate for the first time increased DNA damage via 8-oxoguanine in the skin and plasma in association with epidermal up-regulated phosphorylated/acetylated p53 and high levels of the p53 antagonist p76MDM2. Shortpatch base-excision repair via hOggl, APE1, and polymeraseβ DNA repair is up-regulated. Overexpression of Bcl-2 and low caspase 3 and cytochrome c levels argue against increased apoptosis in this disease. Moreover, we show the presence of high epidermal peroxynitrite (ONOO−) levels via nitrotyrosine together with high nitrated p53 levels. We demonstrate by EMSA that nitration of p53 by ONOO− (300×10−6 M) abrogates DNA binding, while H2O2-oxidized p53 (10−3 M) enhances DNA binding capacity and prevents ONOO−induced abrogation of DNA binding. Taken together, we add a novel reactive oxygen species to the list of oxidative stress inducers in vitiligo. Moreover, we pro!pose up-regulated wild-type p53 together with p76MDM2 as major players in the control of DNA damage/repair and prevention of photodamage and nonmelanoma skin cancer in vitiligo.—Salem, M.

https://openalex.org/W2146057612,"The mouse intravenous challenge model of Candida albicans infection is widely used to determine aspects of host-fungus interaction. We investigated the production of cytokines in the kidneys and spleen of animals up to 48 h after challenge with virulent and attenuated isolates and related these responses to semi-quantitative estimations of histopathological changes in the kidney.Progression of Candida albicans infection of the kidney in response to highly virulent fungal strains was characterized by higher levels of host cellular infiltrate, higher lesion densities and greater quantities of fungal elements at 24 and 48 h, and by higher kidney concentrations of IL-1beta, MCP-1, KC, IL-6, G-CSF, TNF, MIP-2 and MIP-1beta, among the immune effectors measured. Levels of the chemokine KC as early as 12 h after challenge correlated significantly with all later measurements of lesion severity. Early renal IL-6 and MIP-1beta concentrations also correlated with subsequent damage levels, but less significantly than for KC. All chemokines tested appeared in kidney homogenates, while most of the cytokines were undetectable in kidney and spleen homogenates. GM-CSF and IL-10 showed inverse correlations with measures of lesion severity, suggesting these alone may have exerted a defensive role. Spleen levels of KC at all times showed significant associations with kidney lesion measurements.Elevated chemokine levels, including KC, represent the earliest responses to C. albicans infection in the mouse kidney. Fungal strains of low mouse virulence stimulate a lower innate response and less host infiltrate than more virulent strains. These findings are consistent with immunopathological damage to kidneys in the mouse C. albicans infection model and with growing evidence implicating some TLR pathways as the main point of interaction between fungal surface polysaccharides and leukocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2044375445,"Drosophila has emerged as an excellent model system in which to study cellular and genetic aspects of hematopoiesis. Under normal developmental conditions and in wild-type genetic backgrounds, Drosophila possesses two types of blood cells, crystal cells and plasmatocytes. Upon infestation by a parasitic wasp or in certain altered genetic backgrounds, a third hemocyte class called the lamellocyte becomes apparent. Herein we describe the characterization of a novel transcriptional regulatory module, a lamellocyte-active enhancer of the misshapen gene. This transcriptional control sequence appears to be inactive in all cell types of the wild-type larva, including crystal cells and plasmatocytes. However, in lamellocytes induced by wasp infestation or by particular genetic conditions, the enhancer is activated and it directs reporter GFP or DsRed expression exclusively in lamellocytes. The lamellocyte control region was delimited to a 140-bp intronic sequence that contains an essential DNA recognition element for the AP-1 transcription factor. Additionally, mutation of the kayak gene encoding the dFos subunit of AP-1 led to a strong suppression of lamellocyte production in tumorous larvae. As misshapen encodes a protein kinase within the Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway that functions to form an active AP-1 complex, the lamellocyte-active enhancer likely serves as a transcriptional target within a genetic auto-regulatory circuit that promotes the production of lamellocytes in immune-challenged or genetically-compromised animals."
https://openalex.org/W2038653853,"Neovascular and degenerative diseases of the eye are leading causes of impaired vision and blindness in the world. Hypoxia or reduced oxygen tension is considered central to the pathogenesis of these disorders. Although the CD36 scavenger receptor features prominently in ocular homeostasis and pathology, little is known regarding its modulation by hypoxia. Herein we investigated the role and regulation of CD36 by hypoxia and by the major hypoxia effector, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1. In vivo, hypoxia markedly induced CD36 mRNA in corneal and retinal tissue. Subsequent experiments on human retinal pigment epithelial cells revealed that hypoxia time-dependently increased CD36 mRNA, protein, and surface expression; these responses were reliant upon reactive oxygen species production. As an important novel finding, we demonstrate that hypoxic stimulation of CD36 is mediated by HIF-1; HIF-1α down-regulation abolished CD36 induction by both hypoxia and cobalt chloride. Sequence analysis of the human CD36 promoter region revealed a functional HIF-1 binding site. A luciferase reporter construct containing this promoter fragment was activated by hypoxia, whereas mutation at the HIF-1 consensus site decreased promoter activation. Specific binding of HIF-1 to this putative site in hypoxic cells was detected by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Interestingly, inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway blocked the hypoxia-dependent induction of CD36 expression and promoter activity. Functional ramifications of CD36 hypoxic accumulation were evinced by CD36-dependent increases in scavenging and anti-angiogenic activities.

Despite the multiple roles ascribed to CD36, limited data exists regarding its regulation by hypoxia, albeit several lines of evidence would support this inference. It was recently described that CD36 expression was up-regulated during chronic lung hypoxia, with the identification of a putative hypoxia response element (HRE) in the Cd36 murine gene (28Kwapiszewska G.

Collectively, these studies led us to hypothesize that hypoxia modulates CD36 expression and function, with the objective of characterizing the mechanisms behind its regulation. Indeed our findings describe a novel mechanism in which hypoxia induces CD36 expression and promoter activity by stimulating ROS production in a HIF-1- and PI3K-dependent manner.

Six-week-old male C57BL/6 mice purchased from Charles River (St. Constant, Quebec, Canada) were used according to a protocol approved by the Research Center of CHU Sainte-Justine Animal Care Committee. Mice were exposed to ambient room air or placed in an OxyCycler (BioSpherix, Ltd.) and exposed to hypoxia (8% O2) for 6 h. At the end of the experiments, animals were immediately sacrificed and tissues were processed for quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR). Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells, human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (Cambrex, Walkersville, MD), human retinal pigment epithelial (ARPE-19), and human promyelocytic leukemia (HL60) cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained according to standard procedures. For the majority of experiments, ARPEs were used because of their relevance to our ocular studies. For hypoxia exposure, culture dishes were placed in a hypoxia chamber (Billups Rothenburg Inc.) allowing the establishment of a hypoxic environment of 2% O2, 5% CO2, and 93% N2; unless otherwise stated, this hypoxic level (24 h) was used in all experiments. The airtight incubator was kept at 37 °C for preset time periods, whereas normoxic cells were placed at 37 °C in a 21% O2, 5% CO2, and 74% N2 humidified incubator.

PCR amplification protocol involved 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, primer annealing at 55 °C, and primer extension at 72 °C for 60 s. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate along with RT and no template controls.

ARPEs at 70% confluence were exposed to normoxia or hypoxia followed by analysis of CD36 expression via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (FACScan; BD Biosciences) using an anti-CD36-FITC antibody. A minimum of 10,000 cells/sample were assessed. Data were acquired and analyzed using CellQuest software. ARPEs were pre-exposed to 21 or 2% O2 followed by addition of ActD (4.5 μg/ml) to block transcription and subsequent return to normoxia or hypoxia. Cells were harvested at various time points after ActD treatment and processed for qRT-PCR. CD36 mRNA stability was determined as the percentage of initial mRNA remaining after ActD exposure. To elucidate the contribution of ongoing protein synthesis and protein stability, CHX was added to block translation before (25 μm) or after (100 μm) hypoxia. CD36 protein stability was assessed as the proportion of the initial protein remaining after CHX exposure. Intracellular ROS generation was measured using the fluorescent probe dichlorofluorescein diacetate. ARPEs were cultured in 24-well plates and exposed to hypoxia at the indicated time points or angiotensin II (100 nm) for 45 min. Cells were subsequently incubated with dichlorofluorescein diacetate (10 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C followed by measurements using a multiwell fluorescent plate reader (Wallac 1420 VICTOR Multilabel Counter) set at 485 nm excitation and 535 nm emission wavelengths. 8-Isoprostanes (8-Iso-prostaglandin F2α) were measured in normoxia and hypoxia were exposed ARPEs by enzyme immunoassay (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) as previously described (18Mwaikambo B.R. Sennlaub F. Ong H. Chemtob S. Hardy P. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 4356-4364Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A human bacterial artificial chromosome (clone RP11-542H16 from chromosome 7) carrying the human gene for the CD36 promoter (NCBI accession number DD115563) was obtained from the BACPAC Resources Center (Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute, Oakland, CA). The identity of the DNA clone was verified by restriction digest. A fragment containing the 5′-untranslated region (∼3.5 kbp) of the putative CD36 promoter was generated from the bacterial artificial chromosome by PCR using the following primers: forward, 5′-GCGAGCTCCTGAGGAATACAATTGGGGATTGAG-3′ and reverse, 5′-GCGCTCGAGGCAGTCCTCAGTACATAAATGCGT-3′. This product was cloned into the SacI and XhoI sites of the pGL3-basic and pGL3-promoter vectors (Promega Corp.), and the generated plasmids were designated pCD36-luc1 and pCD36- luc2, respectively. In the pCD36-mutHRE construct, the putative HRE of pCD36-luc1 was replaced from 5′-CGTG-3′ to 5′-AAAG-3′ using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. ARPEs at about 70% confluence in 12-well plates were transiently transfected with reporter plasmid (1 μg) using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's directions. To correct for variable transfection efficiency, cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3.1 LacZ (0.5 μg), which encodes for the β-galactosidase gene. Transfected cells were allowed to recover for 24 h in fresh medium, and then treated with CoCl2 (100 μm) or subjected to normoxia or hypoxia. Cells were lysed and luciferase activity determined using the Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega) via a multiwell luminescence reader (Wallac 1420 VICTOR Multilabel Counter). Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed according to the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit protocol (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Briefly confluent cells were grown on 15-cm dishes and exposed to CoCl2, normoxia, or hypoxia (4% O2, 1 h). Cells were immediately fixed with 1% formaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline, lysed, and sonicated to obtain 500 to 1000-base pair DNA fragments. Chromatin was immunoprecipitated using 5 μg of anti-HIF-1α (overnight, 4 °C) or rabbit IgG as a negative control. Immunoprecipitated DNA complex was amplified by PCR with primers for the CD36 promoter (forward, 5-TGAGTGTGTGAGAATTAAGGTTGA-3; and reverse, 5-GAAATGACCATGTGCAATCTCT-3) flanking the HIF-1 binding site. PCR products (∼239 bp) were separated by electrophoresis through 1.8% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Analysis of DiI-oxLDL uptake was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were pre-treated for 2 h with IgA or aCD36 (oxLDL) (clone JC63.1, 10 μg/ml) prior to normoxia or hypoxia exposure. Next, cells were incubated for 6 h with DiI-oxLDL (20 μg/ml) in serum-free medium at 37 °C, washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pelleted, and resuspended in 400 μl of FACS flow for immediate FACS analysis. HL60 cells were pre-labeled with 5 μm CellTracker Green for 45 min at 37 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were subsequently rendered apoptotic after treatment with 5 μm camptothecin (4 h), washed with media, and cultured for an additional 6 h before use. Apoptosis was confirmed by DNA laddering and annexin V-FITC/PI staining (>50% annexin V positive). POS were isolated on 25–60% sucrose gradients from porcine eyes obtained fresh from the slaughterhouse according to established protocols (24Finnemann S.C. Silverstein R.L. J. Exp.

ARPEs were seeded onto 15-mm glass coverslips and pre-treated for 2 h with IgA or aCD36 (oxLDL) (10 μg/ml) followed by hypoxic exposure. 5 × 105 apoptotic cells or 106 POS were allowed to incubate for 3 h on ARPE monolayers in serum-free medium. After incubation, unbound cells were removed by extensive washing with medium. Cells were fixed in ice-cold methanol (15 min at room temperature), washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1:3000, 5 min). Bound or ingested cells were detected by their green fluorescence and observed using a Nikon eclipse E800 epifluorescent microscope with a Nikon DXM 1200 digital camera. This assay was performed as described previously (18Mwaikambo B.R. Sennlaub F. Ong H. Chemtob S. Hardy P. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 4356-4364Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The aortic ring culture media was changed on day 4 with addition of the following test compounds: aCD36 (TSP-1) (clone FA6-152, 10 μg/ml), a CD36 agonist (clone SMO, 5 μg/ml), and their respective isotype controls IgG1 and IgM. Photographs were taken before (day 4) and after treatment (day 5) using an inverted microscope (Eclipse TE300; Nikon). The area of neovessel formation was determined using Image Pro Plus software. All experiments were repeated at least three times and values are presented as mean ± S.E. Data were analyzed by Student's t test, one-way or two-way analysis of variance followed by post-hoc Bonferroni tests for comparison among means. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Based on previous reports eluding to the hypoxic regulation of CD36 (28Kwapiszewska G. Wilhelm J. Wolff S. Laumanns I. Koenig I.R. Ziegler A. Seeger W. Bohle R.M. Weissmann N. Fink L. Respir.

CD36 mRNA levels were determined in corneal and retinal tissue following mouse subjection to ambient room air or whole body hypoxia (8% O2, 92% N2 for 6 h). We focused our attention on the cornea and retina due to their abundant CD36 expression (18Mwaikambo B.R. Sennlaub F. Ong H. Chemtob S. Hardy P. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.

https://openalex.org/W2142488420,"Background Sepsis is a major healthcare problem and current estimates suggest that the incidence of sepsis is approximately 750,000 annually. Sepsis is caused by an inability of the immune system to eliminate invading pathogens. It was recently proposed that endogenous mediators produced during sepsis can contribute to the immune dysfunction that is observed in sepsis. Endocannabinoids that are produced excessively in sepsis are potential factors leading to immune dysfunction, because they suppress immune cell function by binding to G-protein-coupled CB2 receptors on immune cells. Here we examined the role of CB2 receptors in regulating the host's response to sepsis. Methods and Findings The role of CB2 receptors was studied by subjecting CB2 receptor wild-type and knockout mice to bacterial sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture. We report that CB2 receptor inactivation by knockout decreases sepsis-induced mortality, and bacterial translocation into the bloodstream of septic animals. Furthermore, CB2 receptor inactivation decreases kidney and muscle injury, suppresses splenic nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation, and diminishes the production of IL-10, IL-6 and MIP-2. Finally, CB2 receptor deficiency prevents apoptosis in lymphoid organs and augments the number of CD11b+ and CD19+ cells during CLP. Conclusions Taken together, our results establish for the first time that CB2 receptors are important contributors to septic immune dysfunction and mortality, indicating that CB2 receptors may be therapeutically targeted for the benefit of patients suffering from sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W2020855398,"Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) is a universal calcium messenger molecule that regulates many physiological processes. The production and degradation of cADPR are catalyzed by a family of related enzymes, including the ADP-ribosyl cyclase from Aplysia california (ADPRAC) and CD38 from human. Although ADPRC and CD38 share a common evolutionary ancestor, their enzymatic functions toward NAD and cADPR homeostasis have evolved divergently. Thus, ADPRC can only generate cADPR from NAD (cyclase), whereas CD38, in contrast, has multiple activities, i.e. in cADPR production and degradation, as well as NAD hydrolysis (NADase). In this study, we determined a number of ADPRC and CD38 structures bound with various nucleotides. From these complexes, we elucidated the structural features required for the cyclization (cyclase) reaction of ADPRC and the NADase reaction of CD38. Using the structural approach in combination with site-directed mutagenesis, we identified Phe-174 in ADPRC as a critical residue in directing the folding of the substrate during the cyclization reaction. Thus, a point mutation of Phe-174 to glycine can turn ADPRC from a cyclase toward an NADase. The equivalent residue in CD38, Thr-221, is shown to disfavor the cyclizing folding of the substrate, resulting in NADase being the dominant activity. The comprehensive structural comparison of CD38 and APDRC presented in this study thus provides insights into the structural determinants for the functional evolution from a cyclase to a hydrolase.

The enzymatic production of cADPR from the substrate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) requires first the removal of the nicotinamide moiety followed by a cyclization reaction in which both ends of the remaining nucleotide are annealed (Fig. 1A). ADP-ribosyl cyclase (ADPRC) from Aplysia california was the first enzyme discovered to possess this function (cyclase) (4Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Based on sequence homology (5States D.J. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), two human antigens, CD38 and CD157, were identified to also have the cyclase activity (6Howard M. Grimaldi J.C.

However, different from ADPRC, which produces only cADPR from NAD, CD38/CD157 has evolved more like an NADase, producing mainly ADP-ribose (ADPR) from NAD, with cADPR being a minor product. The acquisition of the NADase and the cADPR hydrolysis activities of CD38 make it an important signaling enzyme in regulating NAD and cADPR homeostasis (9Adebanjo O.A. Anandatheerthavarada H.K.

Genetic analysis, as well as the conservation of sequence and disulfide bonds among these enzymes, establish that they all evolved from a common ancestor (12Ferrero E. Saccucci F. Malavasi F. Immunogenetics. 1999; 49: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Little is known of why this conserved family of enzymes has evolved divergently in their catalytic metabolism of NAD and cADPR. cyclic ADP-ribose adenosine diphosphate ribose ADP-ribosyl cyclases, N(2F-A)D, nicotinamide 2-fluoro-adenine dinucleotide nicotinamide N1-cyclic inosine diphosphate ribose arabinosyl-2′-fluoro-deoxy-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide arabinosyl-2′-fluoro-deoxy-adenosine diphosphate ribose ribosyl-2′-fluoro-deoxy-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ribosyl-2′-fluoro-deoxy-adenosine diphosphate ribose 2F-ADPR intermediate wild type high pressure liquid chromatography 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. ADPRC, however, is not solely a cyclase because it can also catalyze the hydrolysis of NMN into ribose-5-phosphate and nicotinamide (13Cakir-Kiefer C. Muller-Steffner H. Schuber F. Biochem.

The catalytic outcome of this novel enzyme is thus determined not by the enzyme alone but also by the specific interactions between the active site and a particular substrate. Consistently, using an NAD analog, N(2F-A)D, as substrate, Zhang et al. (15Zhang B. Muller-Steffner H. Schuber F. Potter B.V. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4100-4109Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) showed that the hydrolase activity of ADPRC can be dominantly revealed, whereas its cyclase activity is suppressed beyond detection (Fig. 1B). Likewise, human CD38 can be converted to a ADPRC-like enzyme by mutation of a single residue, Glu-146, at the active site (16Graeff R. Munshi C. Aarhus R. Johns M. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12169-12173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this study, we determined the structural determinants critical for the catalytic characteristics of ADPRC and CD38 by comparing the crystal structures of the complexes of ADPRC and CD38 bound with various catalytically revealing substrates and products (Fig. 1, A–C). The results identify residues Phe-174 in the cyclase and Thr-221 in CD38 as the main determinants for the cyclase and hydrolysis activities of the enzymes. All together, these structures provide insights into the structural requirements for functional evolution from a cyclase to a hydrolase. Production of recombinant CD38 and Aplysia ADPRC were as described previously (17Munshi C. Thiel D.J. Mathews I.I. Aarhus R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol.

Crystallization of ADPRC was done by mixing 1 μl of protein sample with 1 μl of precipitants (0.1 m imidazole, pH 7.5, 12–24% polyethylene glycol 4000). Dependent on polyethylene glycol 4000 concentration, wild-type ADPRC crystals can be crystallized in space group P1, P21, or P61, whereas E179GADPRC mutant crystals are always in space group P21. NAD was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. N(2F-A)D, ara-2′F-NAD, and ribo-2′F-NAD were synthesized according to established procedures (15Zhang B. Muller-Steffner H. Schuber F. Potter B.V.

N1-cIDPR was obtained by chemoenzymatic routes as illustrated (20Wagner G.K. Guse A.H. Potter B.V.L. J. Org. Chem. 2005; 70: 4810-4819Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The E179GADPRC·NAD complex was obtained by soaking crystals with NAD (10 mm) in mother liquor containing 25% glycerol for about 2 min. The WTADPRC·2F-ADPRI· Nic complex was obtained by soaking WTADPRC crystals with a solution of N(2F-A)D (33 mm) for 3 min, whereas the E179GADPRC·N1-cIDPR complex was obtained by soaking mutant ADPRC crystals in 12 mm N1-cIDPR solution for 8 min. All soaking experiments were carried out at 4 °C for optimal results. After soaking, crystals were immediately flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen. Wild-type CD38 was crystallized as described previously (21Liu Q. Kriksunov I.A. Graeff R. Munshi C. Lee H.C. Hao Q. Structure. 2005; 13: 1331-1339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The WTCD38·ara-2′F-ADPR and WTCD38·ribo-2′F-ADPR complexes were obtained by soaking crystals in a solution containing either 5.2 mm ara-2′F-NAD or 3 mm ribo-2′F-NAD and 100 mm MES, pH 6.0, 15% polyethylene glycol 4000, and 30% glycerol. For these two NAD analogs, covalent adducts are formed after nicotinamide cleavage, resulting in inhibition of the enzyme activity. The soaking is thus insensitive to time (1 min or several days) and temperature (4 or 24 °C). X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) A1 station. All data sets were processed by using the program HKL2000 suite (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Macromolecular Crystallogr. Pt A. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The crystallographic statistics are listed in Table 1. All complex structures were determined by difference Fourier calculation with the starting phases derived from the WTCD38 model (Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID: 1YH3) for CD38 complexes and WTADPRC (PDB ID: 1BLE) for ADPRC complexes. The models for all ligands were built manually in O (23Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr.

For CD38 complexes, the catalytic residue Glu-226 was modeled as covalently linked to ara-2′F-ADPR and ribo-2′F-ADPR. Structure refinements for these complexes were performed using the program REFMAC5 (24Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The forward primer used during the PCR reaction was 5′-GCTTACAGGCCAGACAGTGGCTTTGGCAAGTACGAACT-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-AGTTCGTACTTGCCAAAGCCACTGTCTGGCCTGTAAGC-3′. The bases in bold represent the changes made to code for glycine. The E179G mutant was prepared as described previously (17Munshi C. Thiel D.J. Mathews I.I. Aarhus R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol.

Hydrolysis of cADPR by ADPRC. The wild-type ADPRC (5 μg/ml) was incubated (10–40 min) at room temperature with 1 mm cADPR buffered by 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. The total volume of the reaction mixture was 0.1 ml, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS (0.15% final concentration). The reaction products were analyzed by HPLC using an AG MP-1 column 10 × 120 mm (Bio-Rad). The elution was performed using a gradient of trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. The results shown are mean ± S.E. of four determinations. Cyclization and hydrolysis of NAD by ADPRC. Wild-type (0.1 μg/ml) or F174G (1 μg/ml) ADPRC was incubated with 0.1 mm NAD in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, for various times, and the products were analyzed by HPLC as described above. The results are the mean ± S.E. of four determinations. Wild-type ADPRC catalyzes the production of cADPR from NAD. A catalytically inactive mutant E179G (E179GADPRC) (17Munshi C. Thiel D.J. Mathews I.I. Aarhus R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30770-30777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was thus used to form a complex with NAD by soaking preformed E179GADPRC crystals with NAD at 4 °C. Due to the greatly reduced catalytic activity in the E179GADPRC mutant (17Munshi C. Thiel D.J. Mathews I.I. Aarhus R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30770-30777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), NAD accumulated in the active site without being hydrolyzed. The E179GADPRC·NAD complex structure was determined at 1.83 Å resolution, and the active site structure is shown in Fig. 2A. The nicotinamide moiety of NAD has H-bonding with both Glu-98 and Asn-107, and it stacks with the hydrophobic indole ring of Trp-140 in a parallel manner, thereby positioning the N-glycosidic bond into the active site for catalytic cleavage. The diphosphate group of NAD forms H-bonds with residues Arg-170, Ser-78, Phe-174, and Phe-175. These four residues, together with the Glu-98-Asn-107-Trp-140 triplet, seemingly compose a docking site for proper recognition and positioning of NAD into the active site for catalysis. Electron densities for nicotinamide, the nicotinamide ribose, and diphosphate are well defined, whereas those of the adenine terminus, however, cannot be seen because of its out-of-pocket location. It is intuitively clear that in order for the cyclization of NAD to occur, the adenine ring must fold back toward and anneal with the nicotinamide ribose. The complex shown in Fig. 2A, with the adenine ring positioned out of the active site pocket in a disordered manner, is thus not poised for the cyclization reaction, probably due to the occupation of uncleaved nicotinamide in the cyclization site. To reveal the underlying mechanism for ADPRC in the cyclization reaction, we tested an NAD analog, N(2F-A)D (Fig. 1B), for its ability to form a complex with WTADPRC. In this analog, the addition of the fluorine atom at the 2-position of the adenine moiety apparently reduces the reactivity of the nitrogen at the 1-position, which is the site of cyclization. Consequently, N(2F-A)D is hydrolyzed by the WTADPRC to 2F-ADPR instead of being cyclized to 2F-cADPR (15Zhang B. Muller-Steffner H. Schuber F. Potter B.V. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4100-4109Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We determined the complex structure and refined it to 2.18 Å resolution. The electron densities clearly show two well separated species in the active site of WTADPRC (Fig. 2B). One is the cleaved nicotinamide, which is close to the Glu-98-Asn-107-Trp-140 triplet, and the other is a 2F-ADPR intermediate (2F-ADPRI). No electron density is between the C1′ atom of the ribose and nicotinamide, indicating that the nicotinamide is completely cleaved from the substrate. ADPRC is thus active even in the crystalline form and able to catalyze the hydrolysis of N(2F-A)D. Although the cleaved nicotinamide is still in the active site, the adenine moiety of 2F-ADPRI in the complex formed with the wild-type cyclase is now able to partially fold back toward the active site pocket. It is unexpected for nicotinamide being trapped in the active site after its cleavage and dissociation from 2F-ADPRI. In fact, the trapped nicotinamide in the active site has close interactions with Asn-107 and Trp-140, impeding the complete folding back of the 2F-adenine for cyclization. This would allow slow hydrolysis of N(2F-A)D to 2F-ADPR, consistent with the fact that in solution, the substrate is hydrolyzed by ADPRC instead of cyclized (15Zhang B. Muller-Steffner H. Schuber F. Potter B.V. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4100-4109Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To find structural factors that contribute to the folding back of the adenine ring, we aligned and compared the E179GADPRC·NAD complex with the WTADPRC·2F-ADPRI·Nic complex (Fig. 2C). The alignment shows that Phe-174 rotates its side chain by 10° to coordinate with the folding of the 2F-adenine moiety. In the WTADPRC· 2F-ADPRI·Nic complex, Phe-174 interacts hydrophobically with the 2F-adenine moiety, whereas no such interactions are apparent in the E179GADPRC·NAD complex in which the adenine terminus is disordered (Fig. 2C). The differences suggest that Phe-174 is likely to be important in guiding the folding of the adenine moiety and thus should contribute to the cyclization preference of ADPRC, as will be described in more detail below. Fig. 2C also shows that after the N-glycosidic bond breaks, the Glu-98-Asn-107-Trp-140 triplet appears to pull the nicotinamide away from the remaining 2F-ADPRI C1′ atom in a dissociative manner, which can contribute to the cleavage of the N-glycosidic bond. On the other hand, the diphosphate of the substrates aligns quite well in both structures, indicating that there is only minimal movement in this portion of the molecule during the reaction. The conformational changes of the Glu-98-Asn-107-Trp-140 triplet result in a slight enlargement of the active site, which can be particularly important for the release of the cleaved nicotinamide and the subsequent entry of the adenine moiety into the active site during cyclization of NAD. The triplet thus has a similar functional role as has been described previously for the corresponding residues in CD38 (28Liu Q. Kriksunov I.A. Moreau C. Graeff R. Potter B.V. Lee H.C. Hao Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24825-24832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). ADPRC cyclizes NAD to produce cADPR, a product that is released from the enzyme. There has been no report that ADPRC can form a complex with cADPR, nor has there been any investigation about whether it can hydrolyze cADPR. The prior effort in obtaining an ADPRC·cADPR complex was not successful (17Munshi C. Thiel D.J. Mathews I.I. Aarhus R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30770-30777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), either because the cyclase has no affinity for cADPR or because the enzyme hydrolyzes it during crystallization. We thus tested whether the cyclase can hydrolyze cADPR. This turns out to be the case, as shown in Fig. 3. Incubation of cADPR with the ADPRC resulted in its progressive hydrolysis to ADPR, as analyzed by HPLC. We therefore used an analog of cADPR, N1-cIDPR (20Wagner G.K. Guse A.H. Potter B.V.L. J. Org. Chem. 2005; 70: 4810-4819Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), for complex formation with the E179GADPRC mutant. This analog has previously been used to obtain the CD38·N1-cIDPR complex (28Liu Q. Kriksunov I.A. Moreau C. Graeff R. Potter B.V. Lee H.C. Hao Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24825-24832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). N1-cIDPR was infused into preformed crystals of E179GADPRC by a soaking procedure similar to that used in obtaining the CD38·N1-cIDPR complex. Fig. 4A shows that N1-cIDPR can indeed bind to ADPRC. The electron density unambiguously defines the entity of N1-cIDPR in a cleft close to the active site. The hypoxanthine moiety of N1-cIDPR interacts hydrophobically with the phenyl ring of Phe-174, whereas the hypoxanthine ribose 3′-OH group forms an H-bond with the carboxylate group of Glu-98. Although both residues (Phe-174 and Glu-98) are part of the pocket, the N1-cIDPR binding site is away from the active site, as shown in Fig. 4B. A number of bound water molecules are observed to be recruited for N1-cIDPR binding. Although N1-cIDPR can bind to the active site ADPRC, the binding is different from that in CD38 shown previously (28Liu Q. Kriksunov I.A. Moreau C. Graeff R. Potter B.V. Lee H.C. Hao Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24825-24832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Fig. 4C compares E179GADPRC·N1-cIDPR and E226QCD38·N1-cIDPR. It can be seen that N1- cIDPR binds to ADPRC in an upside-down and left-right orientation as compared with its position in CD38. In ADPRC, the adenine ribose of N1-cIDPR points to the catalytic residue Glu-179, whereas in CD38, it is the northern ribose that points to the catalytic residue Glu-226. Because of the hydrophobic interaction between Phe-174 and the hypoxanthine moiety, N1-cIDPR does not interact with residues Arg-170, Ser-78, and Phe-175. However, in the E179GADPRC·NAD complex, these residues are involved in substrate recognition and binding (Fig. 2A). We have also determined the WTADPRC·N1-cIDPR complex and observed the same binding of N1-cIDPR as in the E179G mutant (data not shown), indicating that, unlike the linear NAD·ADPRC complex described above, the catalytic residue Glu-179 has minimal ability to recruit N1-cIDPR into the active site. Another notable difference between the N1-cIDPR binding sites in CD38 and ADPRC is that the former is much deeper into the active site pocket (Fig. 4C). This is most likely because of the strong hydrophobic stacking between Phe-174 in ADPRC with the hypoxanthine moiety of N1-cIDPR, preventing the cyclic nucleotide from entering deeper into the pocket. In CD38, the residue corresponding to Phe-174 (in ADPRC) is Thr-221. The absence of the benzyl ring on Thr-221 may greatly reduce the stacking interaction and allows N1-cIDPR to reach deeper into the active site in both the wild-type CD38 and its mutant E226QCD38 (28Liu Q. Kriksunov I.A. Moreau C. Graeff R. Potter B.V. Lee H.C. Hao Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24825-24832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4C). The structural results described above indicate the preference of ADPRC for the cyclization reaction. It is then of interest to determine the structural mechanism of the preference of CD38 in the hydrolyzation reaction. We thus tested two substrate analogs of NAD, ara-2′F-NAD and ribo-2′F-NAD. We have previously shown that ara-2′F-NMN forms a covalent intermediate with CD38 (29Liu Q. Kriksunov I.A. Jiang H. Graeff R. Lin H. Lee H.C. Hao Q. Chem. Biol. 2008; 15: 1068-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This is also true for the ara-2′F-NAD, as shown in Fig. 5A. Soaking CD38 crystals with the substrate resulted in the cleavage of the nicotinamide, and the remaining nucleotide formed a covalent adduct between the nicotinamide ribose C1′ and the carboxylate group of the catalytic residue, Glu-226, as clearly shown by the observed electron densities (Fig. 5A). The formation of the covalent adduct fixes one end at the C1′ position of the nicotinamide ribose and allows structural evaluation of the folding ability of the other end, the adenine terminus, which is observed to fold back and enter the active site (Fig. 5A). This is similar to that described above in the 2F-ADPR·ADPRC complex (Fig. 2B). Two water molecules are close to the C1′ carbon, but neither of them can hydrolyze the covalent adduct, indicating that the linkage is stable and resistant to further hydrolysis by the bound water. The diphosphate group forms a number of H-bonds with Trp-125, Ser-126, Arg-127, and Phe-222. There is an H-bond between the adenine ribose and Thr-221, suggesting a role of this residue in stabilizing and guiding the adenine ring terminus into the active site. Although the adenine ring is folded back into the active site, its conformation does not favor the cyclizing N-1-C1′ linkage. The reason is that, in the conformation shown in Fig. 5A, it is the N-7 atom, not the N-1, on adenine moiety that is close to the C1′ of the terminal ribose. The adenine moiety has hydrophobic interaction with Trp-189 and H-bonds with Glu-146, Asp-155, as well as nearby bound water. The presence of trapped water in the active site shows that water enters the active site more readily than the adenine ring, which needs to fold back to form cADPR. This is consistent with the fact that CD38 produces mostly ADPR from NAD through a hydrolyzation reaction, instead of cADPR through a cyclization reaction. We have also solved the crystal structure of WTCD38 complexed with ribo-2′F-NAD (Fig. 5B), a stereo isomer that is identical to ara-2′F-NAD except that the 2′-position, where fluorine is attached, is in the opposite configuration (Fig. 1C). Like ara-2′F-NAD, it also forms a covalent adduct with the catalytic residue Glu-226. The electron density for the nicotinamide ribose and diphosphate are well defined, but there is no electron density covering the adenine ribose and the adenine terminus, showing them to be disordered. Also seen in this complex, the nicotinamide ribose 3′-OH group forms H-bonds with Glu-226 and the Trp-125 main chain nitrogen atom. The diphosphate group has five H-bonds to residues Thr-221, Phe-222, Ser-126, and Arg-127. Again, water was observed to be trapped in the active site with the closest distance of only 3.6 Å to C1′ atom of the nicotinamide ribose. Superimposition of ara-2′F-ADPR on ribo-2′F-ADPR indicates that no matter which NAD analog was used, the conformation of the adenine terminus does not favor the cyclization reaction (Fig. 5C). In the ara-2′F-ADPR complex, the adenine terminus can fold back into the active site, but the adenine ring is in an improper orientation with the N1-cyclization site pointing away from the C1′ of the ribose. In the ribo-2′F-ADPR complex, the adenine terminus remains disordered out of the active site with only water in the active site. Moreover, it is water, instead of the adenine terminus, closer to C1′ of the covalent adducts. With NAD as substrate, the proposed reaction intermediate will be non-covalent, which is more reactive than the covalent adduct (29Liu Q. Kriksunov I.A. Jiang H. Graeff R. Lin H. Lee H.C. Hao Q. Chem. Biol. 2008; 15: 1068-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Water will then be ready to hydrolyze the intermediate to form ADPR. The catalysis of CD38 thus strongly favors hydrolyzation instead of cyclization with NAD as the substrate. From the above analysis, it is clear that the cyclization ability of either ADPRC or CD38 depends on the correct folding of the adenine terminus of the substrate into the active site after nicotinamide cleavage. It is thus of interest to compare the structural features of the active sites of the two enzymes. In Fig. 6A, the WTADPRC·2F-ADPR·Nic complex is superimposed with the WTCD38·ribo-2′F-ADPR complex. In both complexes, the first step of the reaction, e.g. the N-glycosidic bond cleavage, has finished. The comparison shows structural differences in the positioning of some key resides in their active sites, including Glu-98 (Glu-146 in CD38), Asn-107 (Asp-155 in CD38), Trp-140 (Trp-189 in CD38), and Phe-174 (Thr-221 in CD38). Of particular interest is Phe-174 in ADPRC, which is more bulky than the corresponding residue, Thr-221, in CD38 and appears to have hydrophobic interaction with Trp-140. More importantly, Phe-174 in the WTADPRC·2F-ADPR·Nic complex also shows hydrophobic interaction with the 2F-adenine moiety of 2F-ADPR, which is likely to be important in guiding the folding of adenine ring into the active site. Indeed, when comparing the complexes of unfolded and folded substrates, as shown in Fig. 2C, the phenyl ring of the Phe-174 residue is shown to rotate 10° to promote the folding of the adenine moiety. A corollary of this interpretation is that when changing Phe-174 to a less bulky and/or hydrophobic residue, the cyclization activity of the enzyme would be reduced, whereas its hydrolytic activity should be enhanced. This is the case in CD38, which has a less hydrophobic threonine at the corresponding position and thus high hydrolytic activity. To further confirm the importance of Phe-174 in the cyclization reaction, we removed its hydrophobic character by mutating the residue to a glycine. As shown in Fig. 6B, indeed, the mutation bestows the F174G mutant with high NAD-hydrolyzing activity, producing about 30% of its catalytic products as ADPR, whereas none is observed with the wild-type ADPRC.

https://openalex.org/W2138744193,"A major unanswered question in the evolution of Homo sapiens is when anatomically modern human populations began to expand: was demographic growth associated with the invention of particular technologies or behavioral innovations by hunter-gatherers in the Late Pleistocene, or with the acquisition of farming in the Neolithic?We investigate the timing of human population expansion by performing a multilocus analysis of > or = 20 unlinked autosomal noncoding regions, each consisting of approximately 6 kilobases, resequenced in approximately 184 individuals from 7 human populations. We test the hypothesis that the autosomal polymorphism data fit a simple two-phase growth model, and when the hypothesis is not rejected, we fit parameters of this model to our data using approximate Bayesian computation.The data from the three surveyed non-African populations (French Basque, Chinese Han, and Melanesians) are inconsistent with the simple growth model, presumably because they reflect more complex demographic histories. In contrast, data from all four sub-Saharan African populations fit the two-phase growth model, and a range of onset times and growth rates is inferred for each population. Interestingly, both hunter-gatherers (San and Biaka) and food-producers (Mandenka and Yorubans) best fit models with population growth beginning in the Late Pleistocene. Moreover, our hunter-gatherer populations show a tendency towards slightly older and stronger growth (approximately 41 thousand years ago, approximately 13-fold) than our food-producing populations (approximately 31 thousand years ago, approximately 7-fold). These dates are concurrent with the appearance of the Late Stone Age in Africa, supporting the hypothesis that population growth played a significant role in the evolution of Late Pleistocene human cultures."
https://openalex.org/W2018820860,"We have investigated the role of reactive oxygen species and thiol-oxidizing agents in the induction of cell death and have shown that adenocarcinoma gastric (AGS) cells respond differently to the oxidative challenge according to the signaling pathways activated. In particular, apoptosis in AGS cells is induced via the mitochondrial pathway upon treatment with thiol-oxidizing agents, such as diamide. Apoptosis is associated with persistent oxidative damage, as evidenced by the increase in carbonylated proteins and the expression/activation of DNA damage-sensitive proteins histone H2A.X and DNA-dependent protein kinase. Resistance to hydrogen peroxide is instead associated with Keap1 oxidation and rapid translocation of Nrf2 into the nucleus. Sensitivity to diamide and resistance to hydrogen peroxide are correlated with GSH redox changes, with diamide severely increasing GSSG, and hydrogen peroxide transiently inducing protein-GSH mixed disulfides. We show that p53 is activated in response to diamide treatment by the oxidative induction of the Trx1/p38(MAPK) signaling pathway. Similar results were obtained with another carcinoma cell line, CaCo2, indicating that these findings are not limited to AGS cells. Our data suggest that thiol-oxidizing agents could be exploited as inducers of apoptosis in tumor histotypes resistant to ROS-producing chemotherapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2053143217,"Background Longevity is a multifactorial trait with a genetic contribution, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymorphisms were found to be involved in the phenomenon of longevity. Methodology/Principal Findings To explore the effects of mtDNA haplogroups on the prevalence of extreme longevity (EL), a population based case-control study was conducted in Rugao – a prefecture city in Jiangsu, China. Case subjects include 463 individuals aged ≥95 yr (EL group). Control subjects include 926 individuals aged 60–69 years (elderly group) and 463 individuals aged 40–49 years (middle-aged group) randomly recruited from Rugao. We observed significant reduction of M9 haplogroups in longevity subjects (0.2%) when compared with both elderly subjects (2.2%) and middle-aged subjects (1.7%). Linear-by-linear association test revealed a significant decreasing trend of N9 frequency from middle-aged subjects (8.6%), elderly subjects (7.2%) and longevity subjects (4.8%) (p = 0.018). In subsequent analysis stratified by gender, linear-by-linear association test revealed a significant increasing trend of D4 frequency from middle-aged subjects (15.8%), elderly subjects (16.4%) and longevity subjects (21.7%) in females (p = 0.025). Conversely, a significant decreasing trend of B4a frequency was observed from middle-aged subjects (4.2%), elderly subjects (3.8%) and longevity subjects (1.7%) in females (p = 0.045). Conclusions Our observations support the association of mitochondrial DNA haplogroups with exceptional longevity in a Chinese population."
https://openalex.org/W2061261807,"Genomic instability at loci with tandem arrays of simple repeats is the cause for many neurological, neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases. When located in coding regions, disease-associated expansions of trinucleotide repeats are translated into homopolymeric amino acid stretches of glutamine or alanine. Polyalanine expansions in the poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) gene causes oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD). To gain novel insight into the molecular pathophysiology of OPMD, we studied the interaction of cellular proteins with normal and expanded PABPN1. Pull-down assays show that heat shock proteins including Hsp70, and type I arginine methyl transferases (PRMT1 and PRMT3) associate preferentially with expanded PABPN1. Immunofluorescence microscopy further reveals accumulation of these proteins at intranuclear inclusions in muscle from OPMD patients. Recombinant PABPN1 with expanded polyalanine stretches binds Hsp70 with higher affinity, and data from molecular simulations suggest that expansions of the PABPN1 polyalanine tract result in transition from a disordered, flexible conformation to a stable helical secondary structure. Taken together, our results suggest that the pathological mutation in the PABPN1 gene alters the protein conformation and induces a preferential interaction with type I PRMTs and Hsp70 chaperones. This in turn causes sequestration in intranuclear inclusions, possibly leading to a progressive cellular defect in arginine methylation and chaperone activity."
https://openalex.org/W1966925015,"We conducted a large-scale transcriptomic profiling of selected regions of the central nervous system (CNS) across three species of honey bees, in foragers that were performing dance behavior to communicate to their nestmates the location, direction and profitability of an attractive floral resource. We used microarrays to measure gene expression in bees from Apis mellifera, dorsata and florea, species that share major traits unique to the genus and also show striking differences in biology and dance communication. The goals of this study were to determine the extent of regional specialization in gene expression and to explore the molecular basis of dance communication.This ""snapshot"" of the honey bee CNS during dance behavior provides strong evidence for both species-consistent and species-specific differences in gene expression. Gene expression profiles in the mushroom bodies consistently showed the biggest differences relative to the other CNS regions. There were strong similarities in gene expression between the central brain and the second thoracic ganglion across all three species; many of the genes were related to metabolism and energy production. We also obtained gene expression differences between CNS regions that varied by species: A. mellifera differed the most, while dorsata and florea tended to be more similar.Species differences in gene expression perhaps mirror known differences in nesting habit, ecology and dance behavior between mellifera, florea and dorsata. Species-specific differences in gene expression in selected CNS regions that relate to synaptic activity and motor control provide particularly attractive candidate genes to explain the differences in dance behavior exhibited by these three honey bee species. Similarities between central brain and thoracic ganglion provide a unique perspective on the potential coupling of these two motor-related regions during dance behavior and perhaps provide a snapshot of the energy intensive process of dance output generation. Mushroom body results reflect known roles for this region in the regulation of learning, memory and rhythmic behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1986080997,"Electronic noses, E-Noses, are instruments designed to reproduce the performance of animal noses or antennae but generally they cannot match the discriminating power of the biological original and have, therefore, been of limited utility. The manner in which odorant space is sampled is a critical factor in the performance of all noses but so far it has been described in detail only for the fly antenna.Here we describe how a set of metal oxide (MOx) E-Nose sensors, which is the most commonly used type, samples odorant space and compare it with what is known about fly odorant receptors (ORs).Compared with a fly's odorant receptors, MOx sensors from an electronic nose are on average more narrowly tuned but much more highly correlated with each other. A set of insect ORs can therefore sample broader regions of odorant space independently and redundantly than an equivalent number of MOx sensors. The comparison also highlights some important questions about the molecular nature of fly ORs.The comparative approach generates practical learnings that may be taken up by solid-state physicists or engineers in designing new solid-state electronic nose sensors. It also potentially deepens our understanding of the performance of the biological system."
https://openalex.org/W1977131527,"Background Overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines is a well established factor in the progression of chronic heart failure (CHF). Changes in cellular immunity have not been widely studied, and the impact of standard medication is uncertain. Here we investigate whether a leukocyte redistribution occurs in CHF and whether this effect is influenced by beta-blocker therapy. Methodology We prospectively studied 75 patients with systolic CHF (age: 68±11 years, left ventricular ejection fraction 32±11%, New York Heart Association class 2.5±0.7) and 20 age-matched healthy control subjects (age: 63±10 years). We measured the response of cells to endotoxin exposure in vitro, analysed subsets of lymphocytes using flow cytometry, and assessed plasma levels of the pro-inflammatory markers interleukin 1, 6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors 1 and 2. Principal findings While no differences in the number of leukocytes were noted between patients with CHF and healthy controls, we detected relative lymphopenia in patients with CHF (p<0.001 vs. control), mostly driven by reductions in T helper cells and B cells (both p<0.05). The number of neutrophils was increased (p<0.01). These effects were pronounced in patients who were beta-blocker naïve (32% of all patients with CHF). Increased plasma levels of soluble tumor necrosis receptor-1 correlated with the relative number of lymphocyte subsets. Conclusions In patients with CHF, we detected a redistribution of leukocyte subsets, i.e. an increase in neutrophils with relative lymphopenia. These effects were pronounced in patients who were beta-blocker naïve. The underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W2056112402,"Intravascular-thrombosis and extravascular-lipid-deposit are the two key pathogenic events considered to interrupt intraosseous blood supply during development of steroid-associated osteonecrosis (ON). However, there are no clinically employed agents capable of simultaneously targeting these two key pathogenic events. The present experimental study demonstrated that constitutional flavonoid glycosides derived from herb Epimedium (EF, composed of seven flavonoid compounds with common stem nuclear) exerted dose-dependent effect on inhibition of both thrombosis and lipid-deposition and accordingly reducing incidence of steroid-associated ON in rabbits, which was not via direct action by themselves rather by their common metabolite on potential cellular targets involved in the two pathogenic pathways. The underlying mechanism could be explained by counteracting endothelium injury and excessive adipogenesis. These findings encourage designing clinical trials to investigate potential of EF in prevention of steroid-associated ON."
https://openalex.org/W2146286924,"Background While own-age faces have been reported to be better recognized than other-age faces, the underlying cause of this phenomenon remains unclear. One potential cause is holistic face processing, a special kind of perceptual and cognitive processing reserved for perceiving upright faces. Previous studies have indeed found that adults show stronger holistic processing when looking at adult faces compared to child faces, but whether a similar own-age bias exists in children remains to be shown. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we used the composite face task – a standard test of holistic face processing – to investigate if, for child faces, holistic processing is stronger for children than adults. Results showed child participants (8–13 years) had a larger composite effect than adult participants (22–65 years). Conclusions/Significance Our finding suggests that differences in strength of holistic processing may underlie the own-age bias on recognition memory. We discuss the origin of own-age biases in terms of relative experience, face-space tuning, and social categorization."
https://openalex.org/W2092176935,"Intense interest surrounds the recent expansion of US National Institutes of Health (NIH) budgets as part of economic stimulus legislation. However, the relationship between NIH funding and cardiovascular disease research is poorly understood, making the likely impact of this policy change unclear.The National Library of Medicine's PubMed database was searched for articles published from 1996 to 2006, originating from U.S. institutions, and containing the phrases ""cardiolog,"" ""cardiovascular,"" or ""cardiac,"" in the first author's department. Research methodology, journal of publication, journal impact factor, and receipt of NIH funding were recorded. Differences in means and trends were tested with t-tests and linear regression, respectively, with P < or = 0.05 for significance.Of 117,643 world cardiovascular articles, 36,684 (31.2%) originated from the U.S., of which 10,293 (28.1%) received NIH funding. The NIH funded 40.1% of U.S. basic science articles, 20.3% of overall clinical trials, 18.1% of randomized-controlled, and 12.2% of multicenter clinical trials. NIH-funded and total articles grew significantly (65 articles/year, P < 0.001 and 218 articles/year, P < 0.001, respectively). The proportion of articles receiving NIH funding was stable, but grew significantly for basic science and clinical trials (0.87%/year, P < 0.001 and 0.67%/year, P = 0.029, respectively). NIH-funded articles had greater journal impact factors than non NIH-funded articles (5.76 vs. 3.71, P < 0.001).NIH influence on U.S. cardiovascular research expanded in the past decade, during the period of NIH budget doubling. A substantial fraction of research is now directly funded and thus likely sensitive to budget fluctuations, particularly in basic science research. NIH funding predicts greater journal impact."
https://openalex.org/W2065523560,"Laminaripentaose-producing beta-1,3-glucanase (LPHase), a member of glycoside hydrolase family 64, cleaves a long-chain polysaccharide beta-1,3-glucan into specific pentasaccharide oligomers. The crystal structure of LPHase from Streptomyces matensis DIC-108 was solved to 1.62 A resolution using multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion methods. The LPHase structure reveals a novel crescent-like fold; it consists of a barrel domain and a mixed (alpha/beta) domain, forming a wide-open groove between the two domains. The liganded crystal structure was also solved to 1.80 A, showing limited conformational changes. Within the wide groove, a laminaritetraose molecule is found to sit in an electronegatively charged central region and is proximal to several conserved residues including two carboxylates (Glu(154) and Asp(170)) and four other sugar-binding residues (Thr(156), Asn(158), Trp(163), and Thr(167)). Molecular modeling using a laminarihexaose as a substrate suggests roles for Glu(154) and Asp(170) as acid and base catalysts, respectively, whereas the side chains of Thr(156), Asn(158), and Trp(163) demarcate subsite +5. Site-directed mutagenesis of Glu(154) and Asp(170) confirms that both carboxylates are essential for catalysis. Together, our results suggest that LPHase uses a direct displacement mechanism involving Glu(154) and Asp(170) to cleave a beta-1,3-glucan into specific alpha-pentasaccharide oligomers."
https://openalex.org/W2063259721,"The use of high-throughput techniques to generate large volumes of protein-protein interaction (PPI) data has increased the need for methods that systematically and automatically suggest functional relationships among proteins. In a yeast PPI network, previous work has shown that the local connection topology, particularly for two proteins sharing an unusually large number of neighbors, can predict functional association. In this study we improved the prediction scheme by developing a new algorithm and applied it on a human PPI network to make a genome-wide functional inference. We used the new algorithm to measure and reduce the influence of hub proteins on detecting function-associated protein pairs. We used the annotations of the Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) as benchmarks to compare and evaluate the function relevance. The application of our algorithms to human PPI data yielded 4,233 significant functional associations among 1,754 proteins. Further functional comparisons between them allowed us to assign 466 KEGG pathway annotations to 274 proteins and 123 GO annotations to 114 proteins with estimated false discovery rates of <21% for KEGG and <30% for GO. We clustered 1,729 proteins by their functional associations and made functional inferences from detailed analysis on one subcluster highly enriched in the TGF-beta signaling pathway (P<10(-50)). Analysis of another four subclusters also suggested potential new players in six signaling pathways worthy of further experimental investigations. Our study gives clear insight into the common neighbor-based prediction scheme and provides a reliable method for large-scale functional annotation in this post-genomic era."
https://openalex.org/W1974774221,"Background Childhood Meningitis continues to be an important cause of mortality in many countries. The search for rapid diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis has lead to the further exploration of prognostic factors. This study was scheduled in an attempt to analyze various clinical symptoms as well as rapid laboratory results and provide an algorithm for the prediction of specific bacterial aetiology of childhood bacterial meningitis. Methodology and Principal Findings During the 32 year period, 2477 cases of probable bacterial meningitis (BM) were collected from the Meningitis Registry (MR). Analysis was performed on a total of 1331 confirmed bacterial meningitis cases of patients aged 1 month to 14 years. Data was analysed using EPI INFO (version 3.4.3-CDC-Atlanta) and SPSS (version 15.0 - Chicago) software. Statistically significant (p<0.05) variables were included in a conditional backward logistic regression model. A total of 838 (63.0%) attributed to Neisseria meningitidis, 252 (18.9%) to Haemophilus influenzae, 186 (14.0%) to Streptococcus pneumoniae and 55 (4.1%) due to other bacteria. For the diagnosis of Meningococcal Meningitis, the most significant group of diagnostic criteria identified included haemorrhagic rash (OR 22.36), absence of seizures (OR 2.51), headache (OR 1.83) and negative gram stain result (OR 1.55) with a Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of 96.4% (95%CI 87.7–99.6). For the diagnosis of Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most significant group of diagnostic criteria identified included absence of haemorrhagic rash (OR 13.62), positive gram stain (OR 2.10), coma (OR 3.11), seizures (OR 3.81) and peripheral WBC≥15000/µL (OR 2.19) with a PPV of 77.8% (95%CI 40.0–97.2). For the diagnosis of Haemophilus influenzae, the most significant group of diagnostic criteria included, absence of haemorrhagic rash (OR 13.61), age≥1year (OR 2.04), absence of headache (OR 3.01), CSF Glu<40 mg/dL (OR 3.62) and peripheral WBC<15000/µL (OR 1.74) with a PPV of 58.5% (95%CI 42.1–73.7). Conclusions The use of clinical and laboratory predictors for the assessment of the causative bacterial pathogen rather than just for predicting outcome of mortality seems to be a useful tool in the clinical management and specific treatment of BM. These findings should be further explored and studied."
https://openalex.org/W1995494562,"A number of nuclear events occur during apoptosis, including DNA laddering, nuclear lamina breakdown, phosphorylation of histones H2B and histone H2AX, and the tight binding to chromatin of HMGB1 and CAD, the nuclease responsible for DNA laddering. We have performed an epistasis analysis to investigate whether these events cluster together in pathways. We find that all depend directly or indirectly on caspase-3 activation. CAD activation, H2AX phosphorylation and DNA laddering cluster together into a pathway, but all other events appear to be independent of each other downstream of caspase-3, and likely evolved subject to different functional pressures."
https://openalex.org/W2137332120,"The signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) signaling pathway mediates the biological functions of IFN-γ. We have previously shown that the STAT1 pathway is indispensable for host resistance against Leishmania major infection. In this study, we examined the role of STAT1 in lymphocytes and specifically CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in mediating immunity against L. major by transferring T cells from wild-type (WT) and STAT1−/− C57BL/6 mice into Rag2−/− C57BL/6 mice. Rag2−/− mice reconstituted with unfractionated STAT1−/− splenocytes (B cells and T cells) failed to mount an efficient Th1 response after L. major infection, produced more IL-4, and developed large lesions full of parasites. In contrast, Rag2−/− mice reconstituted with WT (STAT1+/+) splenocytes mounted a Th1 response and developed self-resolving lesions. Studies using Rag2−/− recipients that received a combination of purified CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from WT or STAT1−/− mice revealed that STAT1 deficiency in CD4+ T cells, but not in CD8+ T cells, leads to development of chronic, nonhealing lesions and systemic dissemination of parasites into the spleen after L. major infection. Further studies using Rag2−/− recipients of WT Thy1.1+ and STAT1−/− Thy1.2+ T cells showed that STAT1 in CD4+ T cells was not required for Th1 differentiation during L. major infection. However, it was critical for up-regulation of CXCR3 on CD4+ T cells and their migration to the regional lymph node and the cutaneous site of infection. Together, these studies indicate that the STAT1 pathway in CD4+ T cells plays a critical role in immunity against L. major by controlling the migration of Th1 cells to the site of infection rather than their generation. Further, they reveal an essential role for CD4+ T cell STAT1 in preventing systemic dissemination of L. major infection.—Barbi, J., Snider, H. M., Bhardwaj, N., Lezama-Davila, C. M., Durbin, J.

A DNA library of scFv antibody fragments was constructed for ribosome display, and then mRNA-ribosome-antibody (MRA) complexes were produced by a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. The synthetic sulfadimidine-ovalbumin (SM(2)-OVA) was used as an antigen to pan MRA complexes and putative scFv-encoding genes were recovered by RT-PCR in situ following each panning. After four rounds of ribosome display, the expression vector pCANTAB5E containing the selected specific scFv DNA was constructed and transformed into Escherichia coli HB2151. Three positive clones (SAS14, SAS68 and SAS71) were screened from 100 clones and had higher antibody activity and specificity to SM(2) by indirect ELISA. The three specific soluble scFvs were identified to be the same molecular weight (approximately 30 kDa) by Western-blotting analysis using anti-E tag antibodies, but they had different amino acids sequence by sequence analysis.The selection of anti-SM(2) specific scFv by in vitro ribosome display technology will have an important significance for the development of novel immunodetection strategies for residual veterinary drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2037070198,"The removal of introns from pre-mRNA is performed by the spliceosome that stepwise assembles on the pre-mRNA before performing two catalytic steps. The spliceosome-associated CDC5L-SNEV(Prp19-Pso4) complex is implicated in activation of the second catalytic step of pre-mRNA splicing, and one of its members, SNEV(Prp19-Pso4), is also implicated in spliceosome assembly. To identify interaction partners of SNEVPrp19-Pso4, we have performed yeast two-hybrid screenings. Among the putative binding partners was a so far uncharacterized protein carrying two heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K homology domains that we termed Blom7alpha. Blom7alpha is expressed in all tissues tested, and at least three splice variants exist. After confirming direct and physical interaction of SNEV and Blom7alpha, we investigated if it plays a functional role during pre-mRNA splicing. Indeed, Blom7alpha co-localizes and co-precipitates with splicing factors and pre-mRNA and is present in affinity-purified spliceosomes. More importantly, addition of Blom7alpha to HeLa nuclear extracts increased splicing activity in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, we tested if Blom7alpha influences splice site selection using two different minigene constructs. Indeed, both 5'- as well as 3'-site selection was altered upon Blom7alpha overexpression. Thus we suggest that Blom7alpha is a novel splicing factor of the K homology domain family that might be implicated in alternative splicing by helping to position the CDC5L-SNEV(Prp19-Pso4) complex at the splice sites."
https://openalex.org/W2081797326,"Poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is a multifunctional enzyme that is involved in two major cellular responses to oxidative and nitrosative (O/N) stress: detection and response to DNA damage via formation of protein-bound poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose (PAR), and formation of the soluble 2nd messenger monomeric adenosine diphosphate-ribose (mADPR). Previous studies have delineated specific roles for several of PARP-1′s structural domains in the context of its involvement in a DNA damage response. However, little is known about the relationship between the mechanisms through which PARP-1 participates in DNA damage detection/response and those involved in the generation of monomeric ADPR. To better understand the relationship between these events, we undertook a structure/function analysis of PARP-1 via reconstitution of PARP-1 deficient DT40 cells with PARP-1 variants deficient in catalysis, DNA binding, auto-PARylation, and PARP-1′s BRCT protein interaction domain. Analysis of responses of the respective reconstituted cells to a model O/N stressor indicated that PARP-1 catalytic activity, DNA binding, and auto-PARylation are required for PARP-dependent mADPR formation, but that BRCT-mediated interactions are dispensable. As the BRCT domain is required for PARP-dependent recruitment of XRCC1 to sites of DNA damage, these results suggest that DNA repair and monomeric ADPR 2nd messenger generation are parallel mechanisms through which PARP-1 modulates cellular responses to O/N stress."
https://openalex.org/W1993995933,"Light-induced structural changes at the entrance of the chromophore pocket of Agp1 phytochrome were investigated by using a thiol-reactive fluorescein derivative that is covalently attached to the genuine chromophore binding site (Cys-20) and serves as a polarity probe. In the apoprotein, the absorption spectrum of bound fluorescein is red-shifted with respect to that of the free label suggesting that the probe enters the hydrophobic chromophore pocket. Assembly of this construct with the chromophores phycocyanobilin or biliverdin is associated with a blue-shift of the fluorescein absorption band indicating the displacement of the probe out of the pocket. The probe does not affect the photochromic and kinetic properties of the noncovalent bilin adducts. Upon photoconversion to Pfr, the probe spectrum undergoes again a bathochromic shift and a strong rise in CD indicating a more hydrophobic and asymmetric environment. We propose that the environmental changes of the probe reflect conformational changes at the entrance of the chromophore pocket and are indicative for rearrangements of the chromophore ring A. Flash photolysis measurements showed that the absorption changes of the probe are kinetically coupled to the formation of Meta-R(C) and Pfr. In the biliverdin adduct, an additional component occurs that probably reflects a transition between two Meta-RC substates. Analogous results to that of the noncovalent phycocyanobilin adduct were obtained with the mutant V249C in which probe and chromophore are covalently attached. The conformational changes of the chromophore are correlated to proton transfer to the protein surface."
https://openalex.org/W2085950770,"Background Early secretory antigenic target-6 (ESAT-6) and culture filtrate protein-10 (CFP-10) are co-secreted proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex mycobacteria (includes M. bovis, the zoonotic agent of bovine tuberculosis) involved in phagolysosome escape of the bacillus and, potentially, in the efficient induction of granulomas. Upon tuberculosis infection, multi-nucleate giant cells are elicited, likely as a response aimed at containing mycobacteria. In tissue culture models, signal regulatory protein (SIRP)α (also referred to as macrophage fusion receptor or CD172a) is essential for multi-nucleate giant cell formation. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study, ESAT-6/CFP-10 complex and SIRPα interactions were evaluated with samples obtained from calves experimentally infected with M. bovis. Peripheral blood CD172a+ (SIRPα-expressing) cells from M. bovis-infected calves proliferated upon in vitro stimulation with ESAT-6/CFP-10 (either as a fusion protein or a peptide cocktail), but not with cells from animals receiving M. bovis strains lacking ESAT-6/CFP-10 (i.e, M. bovis BCG or M. bovis ΔRD1). Sorted CD172a+ cells from these cultures had a dendritic cell/macrophage morphology, bound fluorescently-tagged rESAT-6:CFP-10, bound and phagocytosed live M. bovis BCG, and co-expressed CD11c, DEC-205, CD44, MHC II, CD80/86 (a subset also co-expressed CD11b or CD8α). Intradermal administration of rESAT-6:CFP-10 into tuberculous calves elicited a delayed type hypersensitive response consisting of CD11c+, CD172a+, and CD3+ cells, including CD172a-expressing multi-nucleated giant cells. Conclusions/Significance These findings demonstrate the ability of ESAT-6/CFP-10 to specifically expand CD172a+ cells, bind to CD172a+ cells, and induce multi-nucleated giant cells expressing CD172a."
https://openalex.org/W2017727272,"Control of breathing, heart rate, and body temperature are interdependent in infants, where instabilities in thermoregulation can contribute to apneas or even life-threatening events. Identifying abnormalities in thermoregulation is particularly important in the first 6 months of life, where autonomic regulation undergoes critical development. Fluctuations in body temperature have been shown to be sensitive to maturational stage as well as system failure in critically ill patients. We thus aimed to investigate the existence of fractal-like long-range correlations, indicative of temperature control, in night time rectal temperature (T(rec)) patterns in maturing infants.We measured T(rec) fluctuations in infants every 4 weeks from 4 to 20 weeks of age and before and after immunization. Long-range correlations in the temperature series were quantified by the correlation exponent, alpha using detrended fluctuation analysis. The effects of maturation, room temperature, and immunization on the strength of correlation were investigated. We found that T(rec) fluctuations exhibit fractal long-range correlations with a mean (SD) alpha of 1.51 (0.11), indicating that T(rec) is regulated in a highly correlated and hence deterministic manner. A significant increase in alpha with age from 1.42 (0.07) at 4 weeks to 1.58 (0.04) at 20 weeks reflects a change in long-range correlation behavior with maturation towards a smoother and more deterministic temperature regulation, potentially due to the decrease in surface area to body weight ratio in the maturing infant. alpha was not associated with mean room temperature or influenced by immunizationThis study shows that the quantification of long-range correlations using alpha derived from detrended fluctuation analysis is an observer-independent tool which can distinguish developmental stages of night time T(rec) pattern in young infants, reflective of maturation of the autonomic system. Detrended fluctuation analysis may prove useful for characterizing thermoregulation in premature and other infants at risk for life-threatening events."
