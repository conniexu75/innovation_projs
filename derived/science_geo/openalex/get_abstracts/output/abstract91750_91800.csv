https://openalex.org/W1543388250,"Human histidine-rich glycoprotein was found to interact strongly with heparin both in purified systems and in plasma, resulting in neutralization of the anti-coagulant activity of heparin. In purified systems, histidine-rich glycoprotein and heparin react with apparent 1:1 stoichiometry to form a complex with a dissociation constant of 7 nM. Covalent heparin-antithrombin complex still reacts with histidine-rich glycoprotein to form a complex with a dissociation constant of 29 nM. The interaction between a Mr = 4300-heparin fragment and histidine-rich glycoprotein appeared to be more complex. The mechanism of the interaction between histidine-rich glycoprotein and heparin appeared to be different from that between antithrombin III and heparin, since the former is abolished by EDTA and occurs both with heparin molecules having a high affinity or a low affinity for antithrombin III. In plasma, histidine-rich glycoprotein efficiently counteracts the anticoagulant activity of heparin. Both the thrombin times and the activated factor X inhibition following addition of heparin are markedly prolonged in the absence of histidine-rich glycoprotein and shortened by addition of purified histidine-rich glycoprotein. Low affinity heparin was found to efficiently compete with high affinity heparin for binding to histidine-rich glycoprotein but not to antithrombin III. This results in an increased anticoagulant activity of high affinity heparin in the presence of low affinity heparin. Since the effect of histidine-rich glycoprotein on the anticoagulant properties of heparin is clearly demonstrated in normal plasma, it may be of clinical significance."
https://openalex.org/W1565643565,"The kinetic mechanism of the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase has been investigated employing the heptapeptide Kemptide (Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly) as substrate. Initial velocity measurements performed over a wide range of ATP and Kemptide concentrations indicated that the reaction follows a sequential mechanistic pathway. In line with this, the results of product and substrate inhibition studies, the patterns of dead end inhibition obtained employing the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue, AMP X PNP (5'-adenylylimidodiphosphate), and equilibrium binding determinations, taken in conjunction with the patterns of inhibition observed with the inhibitor protein of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase that are reported in the accompanying paper (Whitehouse, S., and Walsh, D.A. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 3682-3692), are best fit by a steady state Ordered Bi-Bi kinetic mechanism. Although the inhibition patterns obtained employing the synthetic peptide analogue in which the phosphorylatable serine was replaced by alanine were apparently incompatible with this mechanism, these inconsistencies appear to be due to some element of the structure of this latter peptide such that it is not an ideal dead end inhibitor substrate analogue. The data presented both here and in the accompanying paper suggest that both this substrate, analogue and the ATP analogue, AMP X PNP, do not fully mimic the binding of Kemptide and ATP, respectively, in their mechanism of interaction with the protein kinase. It is proposed that, as with some other kinase reactions, the configuration of the terminal anhydride bond of ATP assumes a conformation once the nucleotide is bound to the protein kinase that assists in the binding of either Kemptide or the inhibitor protein but not the alanine-substituted peptide and that AMP X PNP, because of its terminal phosphorylimido bond, cannot assume this conformation which favors protein (or peptide) binding."
https://openalex.org/W1525931851,"Solid phase radioimmunoassay and a chromatogram binding assay were used to characterize the binding specificities of five monoclonal antibodies generated from mice immunized with human tumor cell lines when tested against various glycolipids. Four antibodies derived from mice immunized with pancreatic carcinoma cells detected specifically the human blood group B determinant, Gal alpha 1 leads to 3Gal (2 comes from 1 alpha Fuc). These antibodies preferred type 2 (Gal beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc) glycolipids. No reactivity was detected with a rat B determinant based on GalNAc. An antibody derived following immunization with a rectal carcinoma cell line was shown to have binding properties identical with those of an antibody that reacts specifically with the stage-specific embryonic mouse antigen (SSEA-1), bearing the determinant Gal beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc (3 comes from 1 alpha Fuc) (Gooi, H. C., Feizi, T., Kapadia, A., Knowles, B. B., Solter, D., and Evans, M. J. (1981) Nature 292, 156-158). Thin layer chromatography was used to detect the binding of a monoclonal anti-tumor antibody recently shown to react with a sialylated Lea glycolipid (Magnani, J.

https://openalex.org/W1510165319,"The phase behavior of 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DLPE) in excess water has been studied by differential scanning calorimetry and x-ray diffraction. In addition to the usual gel phase L beta of lamellar periodicity 5.07 nm and the fluid bilayer phase L alpha of periodicity 4.5 nm, two distinct crystalline forms may also be spontaneously adopted. The L beta phase is only produced by cooling from L alpha and is metastable, relaxing to one of the crystalline forms on incubation. One crystalline polymorph, designated beta 2, has a lamellar periodicity of 4.55 nm and corresponds to the structure of DLPE crystallized from a variety of organic solvents. The other crystalline polymorph, designated beta 1, has a lamellar periodicity of 3.78 nm, which implies that in this form the hydrocarbon chains are tilted at approximately 40 degrees to the bilayer normal. The beta 2 polymorph is obtained on dispersing crystalline DLPE directly in water at T less than 43 degrees C, on incubation in the L alpha phase at 30 degrees C less than T less than 43 degrees C, or on heating the beta 1 form slowly to T greater than 35 degrees C. The beta 1 polymorph is obtained on incubating the L beta phase at T less than 30 degrees C. By calorimetry, the L beta phase undergoes an endothermic transition (delta H = 15.5 kJ X mol-1 (3.7 kcal X mol-1)) at 30.6 degrees C to the fluid bilayer phase L alpha. The beta 1 phase undergoes an endothermic transition (delta H congruent to 50 kJ X mol-1 (12 kcal X mol-1)) to L alpha at 35 degrees C. The beta 2 phase undergoes an endothermic transition (delta H = 57 kJ X mol-1 (13.7 kcal X mol-1)) to L alpha at 43 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W1505226228,"Gel filtration of male rat liver cytosol preincubated with radiolabeled lithocholic, chenodeoxycholic, and glycochenodeoxycholic acids, and taurocholic acid revealed two major peaks of radioactivity, one co-eluting with the glutathione S-transferases and the other with a separate fraction, respectively. Chromatofocusing of the pooled fractions containing the new bile acid binding activity resulted in a separation of bile acid binding from the previously described organic anion binding activity in this fraction. Two binding peaks for lithocholic acid (pI 5.6, Binder I, and pI 5.5, Binder II) were identified on chromatofocusing and were further purified to apparent homogeneity by hydroxyapatite chromatography. The two Binders were monomers having identical molecular weight (33,000) and similar amino acid compositions. Bile acid binding to purified Binders I and II and glutathione S-transferases A, B, and C was studied by inhibition of the fluorescence of bound 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate (ANS). Confirmatory experiments using equilibrium dialysis produced comparable results. Glutathione S-transferase B had greater affinity for bile acids than transferases A or C. Binder II, which had greater affinity than Binder I for most bile acids, had greater affinity for chenodeoxycholic acid than transferase B but comparable or lower affinities for the other bile acids. All bile acids studied diminished ANS fluorescence with Binder II. Taurocholic and cholic acids increased ANS fluorescence with Binder I without affecting KANS, whereas lithocholic and chenodeoxycholic acids diminished ANS fluorescence with Binder I. In summary, we have identified and isolated two proteins (Binders I and II) which, along with glutathione S-transferase B, are the major hepatic cytosol bile acid binding proteins; these proteins have overlapping but distinct specificities for various bile acids."
https://openalex.org/W1494346945,"The complete amino acid sequence of the major phenobarbital-induced cytochrome P-450 (P-450LM2) from rabbit liver microsomes has been determined. The protein contains 489 amino acid residues in a single polypeptide chain and has Mr = 55,464. The sequence was compared with the amino acid sequence of P-450CAM and the nucleotide sequence of cDNA obtained from phenobarbital-induced rat liver cytochrome P-450 mRNA. These comparisons suggest that, despite functional similarities, the structural homology between microbial and microsomal cytochromes P-450 is limited to a single 8-residue region, and, in contrast, the structure of inducible microsomal cytochrome P-450 isozymes is highly conserved among mammalian species. Furthermore, we propose that the thiolate heme ligand of cytochrome P-450 is contributed by a cysteinyl residue near the COOH terminus, position 434 in the rabbit P-450LM2 sequence, based on the homology in this region with P-450CAM. The NH2 terminus of the protein from residues 1-310 is characterized by 8 hydrophobic segments 18-23 residues long, each of which is terminated by a cluster of charged amino acid residues. Residues 320-443 comprise a hydrophilic region which contains the putative heme binding cysteinyl residue as well as segments of homology with a constitutive rabbit cytochrome P-450 isozyme. The sequence data suggest that cytochrome P-450LM2 contains multiple transmembranous segments as well as a hydrophilic cytoplasmic domain. The hydrophilic domain contains regions of homology with several other cytochromes P-450, and thus appears to have an essential role in the biological function of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1599469009,"Incubation of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells in their own ascites fluid induced a reversible metabolic adaptation to these conditions which was associated with a fragmentation of DNA. Endogenous poly(ADP-ribose) residues also increased, reaching within 1-3 h values 6-10 times higher than in cells taken directly from the mouse peritoneum. The NAD content changed only slightly while dimethyl sulfate-induced accumulation of poly(ADP-ribose) (10-fold within 30 min) was associated with a rapid depletion of NAD (85% lost at 30 min). Nevertheless, turnover of poly(ADP-ribose) as measured by the decay rate of the polymer upon addition of benzamide was dramatically stimulated in both situations, reaching apparently identical half-lives (t 1/2 approximately equal to 1 min) in starved and in alkylated cells. However, since penetration of benzamide into the nucleus may be the rate-limiting factor in these studies, turnover of poly(ADP-ribose) in dimethyl sulfate-treated cells may still be much higher than that in starved cells. In cells treated with dimethyl sulfate, suppression of poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis by benzamide did not interfere with DNA fragmentation or with DNA resealing as determined by the nucleoid procedure. By contrast, starvation induced a type of DNA incision that was prevented by benzamide. It is proposed that starvation-induced scission of DNA occurs at specific (regulatory?) sites requiring poly(ADP-ribose) formation to take place, while fragmentation of DNA at random as seen with alkylating agents is associated with, but not dependent on, increased poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation."
https://openalex.org/W1487213872,"Photoaffinity labeling of small intestinal brush-border membrane vesicles with photolabile bile salt derivatives was performed to identify bile salt-binding polypeptides in these membranes. The derivatives used in this study were the sodium salts of 7,7-azo-3 alpha, 12 alpha-dihydroxy-5 beta-cholan-24-oic acid, 3 beta-azido-7 alpha, 12 alpha-dihydroxy-5 beta-cholan-24-oic acid, their respective taurine conjugates, and (11 xi-azido-12-oxo-3 alpha, 7 alpha-dihydroxy-5 beta-cholan-24-oyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid. With ileal brush-border membrane vesicles, photoaffinity labeling resulted in the identification of 5 polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 125,000, 99,000, 83,000, 67,000, and 43,000. The extent of labeling depended on the photolabile derivative employed. In jejunal brush-border membrane vesicles, polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 125,000, 94,000, 83,000, 67,000, and 43,000 were labeled. The results indicate that the binding polypeptides involved in bile salt transport in ileal brush-border membrane vesicles are 1) similar with one exception to those concerned with bile salt transport in jejunal brush-border membranes, and 2) markedly different from those previously shown to be concerned with bile salt transport in plasma membranes of hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1535864348,"The activation of human prothrombin by the bacterial protein staphylocoagulase proceeds via the formation of a very stable equimolar complex. Unmasking of the active center in the prothrombin moiety of the complex is not caused by limited proteolysis. The kinetics of activation of human prothrombin by staphylocoagulase has been studied. The second order rate constant at pH 7.5, 37 degrees C, is 3.3 X 10(6) M-1 S-1. This reaction rate is close to reported diffusion-controlled rates of protein-protein interaction. The dissociation constant of the complex was too low to be measurable. From the kinetic data it is assumed that the first order rate constant for dissociation is orders of magnitude less than 10(-5) S-1. However, dissociation of the complex did occur in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Equimolar amounts of staphylocoagulase protect human thrombin, but not human factor Xa and bovine thrombin, against inactivation by antithrombin III. From these findings we postulate that tertiary structural changes in the thrombin region of prothrombin caused by a highly specific interaction between staphylocoagulase and that region unmask the active site."

https://openalex.org/W1542213143,"The histone phosphorylations of temperature-sensitive mutant cells (tsBN2) were investigated during the induction of premature chromosome condensation (PCC). At the permissive temperature (33.5 degrees C), the histones of the cells were phosphorylated typically as in any other mammalian cell. However, at the nonpermissive temperature (40.5 degrees C), both histone H1 and H3 were phosphorylated extensively as in mitotic cells, and the increase in these phosphorylations throughout S to G2 phase was closely correlated to the frequency of cells showing PCC. The pattern of H1 subtype phosphorylations was quite similar, and the sites of H1 phosphorylation from PCC were the same as those from mitotic cells. Although the degree of phosphorylation was low, H1 and H3 phosphorylations were observed even in G1 phase at the nonpermissive temperature. The effects of metabolic inhibitors on the induction of PCC were parallel in H1 and H3 phosphorylations; actinomycin D failed to inhibit either PCC induction or these phosphorylations, whereas cyclohexamide did, completely inhibiting H3 phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W151550344,"Radioiodinated hexanoyldiiodo-N-(4-azido-2-nitrophenyl)tyramine (HNT) was employed as a photosensitive membrane-restricted probe to establish whether terminal complement proteins insert into membrane bilayers during cytolysis. The system studied consisted of natural membranes carrying intermediate (C5b-8) or fully assembled (C5b-9) cytolytic complexes of human complement prepared by two different methods. In one method, C5b-8 and C5b-9 were assembled on membranes de novo by incubating rabbit erythrocytes with C9-depleted or whole human serum, respectively. The probe was partitioned into lipid bilayers of the resulting MC5b-8 and MC5b-9 membranes by post-addition of HNT. Membranes were irradiated and photolabeled C5b-8 and C5b-9 were extracted, purified, and analyzed on polyacrylamide gels. Those constituents labeled by HNT within each complex were identified by autoradiography. The second method involved pre-addition of HNT to membranes carrying the precursive C5b-7 complex and subsequent conversion to MC5b-8 and MC5b-9 by addition of exogenous C8 and C9. After irradiation, C5b-8 and C5b-9 were again purified and analyzed for the presence of photolabel. Results from both methods were similar and indicated all constituents of each complex are labeled to a measurable extent. However, the C8 alpha subunit was predominantly labeled in C5b-8 and both C8 alpha and C9 were predominantly labeled in C5b-9. Because labeling by HNT is specific for intramembrane structural domains of proteins, these results provide direct evidence that constituents of terminal complement complexes insert into the lipid bilayer of cell membranes during lysis. Further, we conclude that in these complexes, C8 alpha and C9 are the primary contributors of inserted peptide domains."
https://openalex.org/W1546215102,"When Dictyostellium discoideum actin is synthesized in vitro, it is made as a 43,000-dalton polypeptide with an NH2-terminal N-acetylmethionine. The acetylmethionine is then cleaved post-translationally, and the new NH2-terminal aspartic acid is acetylated to give the mature form of actin. Inhibition of methionine acetylation prevents methionine cleavage (Redman, K., and Rubenstein, P. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 13226-13229). In this paper, we describe the results of experiments designed to discover whether this novel actin processing pathway is peculiar to the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system or whether it is utilized by mammalian cells in vivo as well. We show that in mouse L-929 cells, actin is made as a 43,000-dalton protein with an NH2-terminal N-acylmethionine residue. Experiments using thin layer chromatography and digestion of the acylmethionine residue with hog kidney acylase I demonstrate that the acyl group is an acetyl residue. Pulse-chase experiments show that over the course of 1 h, this precursor is transformed first to an actin with a free NH2-terminal aspartic acid and is subsequently converted to mature L-cell actin with an acetylaspartic acid NH2 terminus. The half-life of the initial actin precursor in the cell appears to be approximately 12-15 min. These studies demonstrate the existence of this novel actin processing pathway in vivo and suggest that it is used for those actins where, in the gene, the initiator methionine codon directly precedes the codon for aspartic or glutamic acids, the residues normally found at the actin NH2 terminus."
https://openalex.org/W2121932851,"Chemotaxis of rabbit neutrophils is most sensitive to inhibition by 3-deazaadenosine, followed by 3-deaza-(+/-)aristeromycin, 3-deaza-(+/-)aristeromycinylhomocysteine, 3-deazaadenosylhomocysteine, and adenosylhomocysteine, in that order. Although adenosine by itself had no effect on the chemotaxis of neutrophils, it essentially abolished the inhibitory effects of 3-deaza-adenosine on chemotaxis and the reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium. Paradoxically, adenosine enhanced the inhibition of chemotaxis by 3-deazaadenosylhomocysteine slightly and that of 3-deaza-(+/-)aristeromycin significantly. Adenosine alone unexpectedly inhibited phospholipid methylation to the same extent as 3-deazaadenosine, and reduced protein carboxymethylation to a lesser degree. The inhibition of these two methylation reactions by 3-deazaadenosine was, however, not substantially altered in the presence of adenosine. Drastic changes in the ratio of adenosylmethionine/nucleosidylhomocysteine were observed in the presence of adenosine, 3-deazaadenosine, 3-deaza-(+/-)aristeromycin, or of adenosine in combination with each of the latter compounds. There was no significant effect on the binding of chemotactic peptide to receptors, or on the ratio of ATP/ADP in cells treated by the analogs. These results suggest that the inhibition of methylation reactions per se is not enough to account for the inhibition of both chemotaxis and the reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium by neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W125407322,"Oxidation of 1-octene by cytochrome P-450 results concurrently in formation of 1,2-oxidooctane and in N-alkylation by the catalytically activated olefin of the prosthetic heme group. The stereochemistry of trans-1-[1-2H]octene is retained during both transformations. This alkylation stereochemistry requires addition of the pyrrole nitrogen and the activated oxygen to the same side of the double bond, a reaction geometry opposite to that expected if the heme were alkylated by the epoxide metabolite. Stereochemical analysis shows that the S enantiomer of the epoxide is formed in slight excess over the R enantiomer by oxidation of the re and si faces, respectively, of the olefin, but that heme alkylation only occurs during oxidation of the re face. The stereochemical specificity of epoxidation and heme alkylation requires that (a) the two processes proceed by independent (probably concerted) mechanisms, or (b) the two processes diverge from a common acyclic intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W2307479577,"Dopamine beta-hydroxylase is present in the bovine adrenal medulla in two forms, soluble and membrane bound. Previous isolation procedures for the membranous hydroxylase have resulted in a form of enzyme identical in subunit structure with the soluble type. We report here the isolation of a membrane-bound form of dopamine beta-hydroxylase which is structurally different from the soluble form. The isolated membranous enzyme has a large apparent molecular weight on gel filtration, is amphiphilic, and contains bound phospholipid which is predominantly phosphatidylserine. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate shows that the membranous hydroxylase contains two nonidentical subunits under both reducing and nonreducing conditions. Under reducing conditions the apparent molecular weights of the two subunits are 70,000 and 75,000 and both contain carbohydrate. The purified membranous hydroxylase binds to phospholipid vesicles and chymotryptic digestion of the bound enzyme suggests that two forms of the membranous hydroxylase exist."
https://openalex.org/W1589864249,"The mechanism of inhibition of pyruvate carboxylase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and carbamyl phosphate synthetase induced by alpha-ketoisovalerate metabolism has been investigated in isolated rat hepatocytes incubated with lactate, pyruvate, ammonia, and ornithine as substrates. Half-maximum inhibitions of flux through each of these enzyme steps were obtained with 0.3 mM alpha-ketoisovalerate. The inhibition of pyruvate carboxylase flux by alpha-ketoisovalerate was largely reversed by oleate addition, but pyruvate dehydrogenase flux was inhibited further. Inhibition of flux through pyruvate carboxylase could be attributed mainly to the fall of its allosteric activator, acetyl-CoA, with some additional effect due to inhibition by methylmalonyl-CoA. Tissue acetyl-CoA levels decrease as a result of an inhibition of the active form of pyruvate dehydrogenase. Kinetic studies with the purified pig heart pyruvate dehydrogenase complex showed that methyl-malonyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and isobutyryl-CoA were inhibitory, the latter noncompetitive with CoASH with an apparent Ki of 90 microM. The observed inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase flux correlated with increases of the acetyl-CoA/CoASH and propionyl-CoA/CoASH ratios and isobutyryl-CoA levels, while increases of the mitochondrial NADH/NAD+ ratio explained differences between the effects of alpha-ketoisovalerate and propionate. Carbamyl phosphate synthetase I purified from rat liver was shown to be inhibited directly by methylmalonyl-CoA (apparent Ki of 5 mM). Inhibition of flux through carbamyl phosphate synthetase during alpha-ketoisovalerate metabolism could be attributed both to a direct inhibitory effect of methyl-malonyl-CoA and to a diminished activation by N-acetylglutamate. Direct effects of various acyl-CoA metabolites on these key enzymes may explain symptoms of hypoglycemia and hyperammonemia observed in patients with inherited disorders of organic acid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1512471722,"The uptake of photolabile bile acid derivative, (7,7-azo-3 alpha, 12 alpha-dihydroxy-5 beta-cholan-24 oyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonate (7,7-azo-TC), was investigated in rat ileal brush-border membrane vesicles. The uptake of 7,7-azo-TC showed a transient vesicle to medium ratio greater than one in the presence of a Na+ gradient. The Na+-dependent uptake of 7,7-azo-TC was inhibited by taurocholate and vice versa. 130 microM 7,7-azo-TC inhibited Na+-dependent taurocholate uptake by 50%. The degree of inhibitory power on taurocholate uptake was taurodeoxycholate greater than cholate greater than 7,7-azo-TC. Photoaffinity labeling of membrane vesicles with 7,7-azo-TC irreversibly inhibited Na+-dependent taurocholate and D-glucose transport but not Na+-dependent L-alanine transport. Kinetic and photoaffinity labeling experiments indicate that this representative photoaffinity probe interacts with the ileal Na+, bile salt cotransporter and may be used to identify polypeptide components of this transport system."
https://openalex.org/W1520695543,"We report a quantitative subcellular localization study of calmodulin and the subcellular distribution of calmodulin-binding proteins in normal and virus-transformed chicken embryo fibroblasts. We developed homogenization conditions for fibroblasts which give maximal cell disruption with minimal organelle destruction, prepared and characterized subcellular fractions, and measured the levels and distribution of calmodulin in the fractions. We found that the majority of calmodulin is present in the soluble fraction, but that a small, reproducible amount of calmodulin is present in each of the particulate fractions. The amount of calmodulin in all subcellular fractions of transformed fibroblasts is greater than or equal to the amount of calmodulin in the corresponding fractions of normal fibroblasts. In contrast to the mostly soluble distribution of calmodulin, many of the calmodulin-binding proteins in fibroblasts are associated with the particulate fractions. Although there are no apparent qualitative differences between normal and transformed fibroblasts with respect to the number, distribution, or apparent molecular weight of the calmodulin-binding proteins, there may be quantitative changes in the levels of some calmodulin-binding proteins after transformation. These data suggest that many of the calmodulin-binding proteins may be particulate proteins rather than soluble proteins, and that several calmodulin-binding proteins in fibroblasts may bind calmodulin in a calcium-independent manner."
https://openalex.org/W1549437780,"A new metabolite of vitamin K, 2(3)-hydroxy-2,3-dihydro-2-methyl,3-phytyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (hydroxyvitamin K), has been identified as a product of vitamin K epoxide metabolism in hepatic microsomes from warfarin-resistant rats, but not in those derived from normal rats. The structure was determined by comparison of the high performance liquid chromatography retention times, UV, IR, CD, and mass spectra of the unknown with chemically synthesized standards. Alterations in the formation of hydroxyvitamin K occur in parallel with alterations in total vitamin K epoxide conversion with respect to reaction time, extent of reaction, detergent stimulation, and inhibition by warfarin. Thus, hydroxyvitamin K appears to be a product of the warfarin-resistant vitamin K epoxide reductase. It is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of epoxide reduction. Hydroxyvitamin K is formed from both enantiomers of racemic vitamin K epoxide with little stereoselectivity for the configuration of either the oxirane ring or the phytyl side chain. The reaction is stereospecific; however, the biologically formed (+)-vitamin K epoxide yields exclusively (+)-3-hydroxyvitamin K. Observation of this product is discussed as a key to understanding the normal reaction mechanism of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1596082068,"The formation of hemoglobin from free CO-heme and apoprotein is, at minimum, a two-step process. The first reaction involves very rapid equilibration of the heme groups with hydrophobic regions of the globin molecule. The spectrum of the resultant heme-globin complex is analogous to that of CO-heme incorporated into phospholipid membranes. The Soret absorbance maximum of this species is at about 413 nm, which suggests strongly that the iron-histidine bond has not been formed. The equilibrium dissociation constant for the formation of the heme-globin complex is 6.2 +/- 2 microM at pH 7.2 and 10 degrees C. This constant increases with increasing pH, with the addition of inositol hexaphosphate, with modification of the protoporphyrin vinyl groups, and with increasing glycerol concentration. The second step in hemoglobin formation is unimolecular and appears to involve a large conformational transition which results in iron-histidine bond formation and the appearance of a native CO-hemoglobin spectrum. The rate of this process is 500 +/- 150 s-1 at pH 7.2 and 10 degrees C and is little affected by changes in pH, the addition of organic phosphates, or heme modification. Increasing the solvent viscosity to about 10 c.p. by the addition of 50% glycerol causes a 10-fold decrease in the rate of this conformational change. This suggests that large protein movements, presumably folding around the heme, are involved in the final stages of hemoglobin formation. Iron-histidine bond formation does not appear to be a rate-limiting step."
https://openalex.org/W1957781043,"When individual enzyme activities of the fatty acid synthetase (FAS) system were assayed in extracts from five different plant tissues, acetyl-CoA:acyl carrier protein (ACP) transacylase and beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthetases I and II had consistently low specific activities in comparison with the other enzymes of the system. However, two of these extracts synthesized significant levels of medium chain fatty acids (rather than C16 and C18 acid) from [14C]malonyl-CoA; these extracts had elevated levels of acetyl-CoA:ACP transacylase. To explore the role of the acetyl transacylase more carefully, this enzyme was purified some 180-fold from spinach leaf extracts. Varying concentrations of the transacylase were then added either to spinach leaf extracts or to a completely reconstituted FAS system consisting of highly purified enzymes. The results suggested that: (a) acetyl-CoA:ACP transacylase was the enzyme catalyzing the rate-limiting step in the plant FAS system; (b) increasing concentration of this enzyme markedly increased the levels of the medium chain fatty acids, whereas increase of the other enzymes of the FAS system led to increased levels of stearic acid synthesis; and (c) beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthetase I was not involved in the rate-limiting step. It is suggested that modulation of the activity of acetyl-CoA:ACP transacylase may have important implications in the type of fatty acid synthesized, as well as the amount of fatty acids formed."
https://openalex.org/W1573453127,"The association of the isolated cytoplasmic fragment of band 3 protein with human hemoglobin was studied by rate zonal centrifugation in sucrose density gradients, by quenching of fragment fluorescence by hemoglobin, and by flash photolysis of carbon monoxidebound hemoglobin as a function of fragment concentration. The centrifugation results showed that both proteins interact and that the interaction is abolished upon addition of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The fractions eluted from the density gradient were analyzed further by spectrophotometric and gel electrophoretic methods. Two types of complexes could be identified, one containing the equivalent of 1 hemoglobin tetramer/dimer of cytoplasmic fragment and another containing 2 tetramers of hemoglobin/dimer of fragment. Flash photolysis and fluorescence-quenching experiments showed that liganded hemoglobin is stabilized as the alpha beta dimer when bound to the fragment, a result almost identical with that seen for membranebound hemoglobin in previous studies. The results further suggest that there are two binding sites for the alpha beta dimer of hemoglobin on one monomer of the cytoplasmic fragment but only one mutually exclusive hemoglobin tetramer binding site, suggesting the possibility of conformational isomerism when the fragment with two dimers bound isomerises to a fragment monomer with one hemoglobin tetramer bound. Finally, despite the stabilization of the dimeric state of liganded hemoglobin when bound to the fragment, estimates of the hemoglobin dimer and tetramer binding constants suggest that the hemoglobin tetramer binds more tightly by about 2 orders of magnitude."

Measurements were made on the cytochrome in both aqueous buffer and phosphatidylcholine vesicles; little difference in the kinetic constants between the two was observed. 22R-Hydroxycholesterol and 20 alpha,22R-dihydroxycholesterol, intermediates in the cytochrome P-450scc-catalyzed conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone, markedly influenced rates and equilibria of O2 and CO binding. Binding of the intermediates greatly decreased the association rate of both O2 (80-160-fold) and CO (30-80-fold) relative to cholesterol-bound cytochrome. They had opposite effects on O2 and CO dissociation rates, causing a 5-fold increase in the CO dissociation rate relative to cholesterol and a 150-900-fold decrease in the O2 dissociation rate. Kd values for CO, determined by titration of the reduced cytochrome with CO, increased from 0.3 microM for substrate-depleted cytochrome to 0.7-1.0 microM, 100 microM, and 213-244 microM, respectively, for cholesterol, 22R-hydroxycholesterol, and 20 alpha,22R-dihydroxycholesterol. Conversely, Kd values for O2, determined from the ratio of dissociation and association rate constants, decreased from 23 microM for cholesterol-bound cytochrome to 12 microM and 5 microM for 22R-hydroxycholesterol and 20 alpha,22R-hydroxycholesterol, respectively, indicating a thermodynamic stabilization of the Fe2+ . O2 complex by these intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W1575657468,"Alkyldihydroxyacetone-P (alkyl-DHAP) synthase catalyzes the exchange of the fatty acid esterified to C-1 of the DHAP portion of acyl-DHAP for a fatty alcohol to form 1-O-alkyl-DHAP, the first ether-linked intermediate in ether lipid biosynthesis. Another characteristic of the reaction is the exchange of the pro-R hydrogen at C-1. We have investigated this hydrogen exchange using palmitoyl-[1-R-3H]DHAP and a 1000-fold purified preparation of alkyl-DHAP synthase. We found a small but significant pro-R hydrogen exchange in the absence of the co-substrate, fatty alcohol. When [14C]hexadecanol was added, the increase in pro-R 3H exchange was equal to the [14C]hexadecyl-DHAP formed. Addition of [14C]palmitic acid resulted in an increase in pro-R 3H exchange that matched the formation of [14C]palmitoyl-DHAP by the acyl exchange activity of alkyl-DHAP synthase. Furthermore, although whole microsomes contain at least two acyl hydrolases for acyl-DHAP, purified preparations of alkyl-DHAP synthase do not form DHAP from acyl-DHAP. These results are discussed with respect to data obtained from other laboratories using whole microsomes and in support of our proposed ping-pong mechanism for alkyl-DHAP synthase."
https://openalex.org/W1538479947,"Tubulin was purified from unfertilized eggs of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus by DEAE-column chromatography and cycles of temperature-dependent assembly and disassembly. Tubulin-containing column fractions self-assemble into intact microtubules in the absence of high molecular weight microtubule-associated proteins. Egg microtubules assembled during the third cycle of assembly following DEAE-chromatography are composed of 2 or 3 alpha tubulins and 2 beta tubulins as assayed by isoelectric focusing and two-dimensional electrophoresis. The critical protein concentrations necessary for assembly of egg tubulin at 37 and 25 degrees C are 0.15-0.24 and 0.24-0.28 mg/ml, respectively. At physiological temperatures, the critical protein concentrations are 0.81 mg/ml at 15 degrees C and 0.70-0.79 mg/ml at 18 degrees C. At 18 degrees C, bovine brain microtubule-associated proteins stoichiometrically stimulate the initial rate and final extent of egg tubulin assembly. These hybrid microtubules assemble at 18 degrees C at a critical protein concentration of 4-20 micrograms/ml."
https://openalex.org/W1534117804,"The cytoplasmic membrane of Methanospirillum hungatei was isolated from osmotic lysates of spheroplasts, with yields of 7-8% of the cell dry weight. Cytoplasmic contamination was negligible, as judged by the removal of soluble enzymes. The cytoplasmic membrane consists of lipid (35-37%), primarily as a biphytanyldiglycerol tetraether glycolipid; protein (45-50%); and carbohydrate (10-12%). Ultra-thin sections showed that the trilaminar membrane formed vesicles with a maximum diameter of 0.4 microns. Protrusions of membrane projecting from the vesicles were seen often in negatively stained preparations. Fractionation of M. hungatei cells grown in the presence of [14C]mevalonic acid revealed that 90% of the phytanyl lipids were present in the cytoplasmic membrane band, with two minor bands accounting for the remainder of the label. Approximately 50% of the galactose, glucose, and mannose present in the cytoplasmic membrane was found in lipid extracts, while the remainder of these sugars and 98% of the rhamnose were present as nonlipid sugars. The cell sheath, isolated with a yield of 13% of the cell dry weight, contained the same sugars as the cytoplasmic membrane, but in very different proportions. Amino acid analysis of the membrane proteins showed that hydrophobic amino acid residues made up 37% of the total, neutral amino acids, 39%, basic, 8%, acidic, 16%, and that half-cysteine was present. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel patterns of solubilized cytoplasmic membrane proteins revealed major bands at 195, 74.5, 44, 32, and 30 KDa. Significant amounts of nickel co-isolated with the cytoplasmic membrane, accounting for 0.16% of the membrane dry weight."

The emission has a peak in the red part of the spectrum and an ultraviolet contribution. The emission count rate correlates with peroxide concentration in a saturating manner under normal breathing conditions. When trapped in a balloon, the breath luminescence count rate has a half-decay time of approximately 20 min and exhibits more than one mode of decay. The photomultiplier pulses generated by breath luminescence arrive in bursts. The chemiluminescence process appears by these criteria to include chain reactions, long-lived emitters, or both."
https://openalex.org/W1545024563,"We studied the mechanism by which tubulin-colchicine complex (TC) inhibits microtubule polymerization in vitro by using the axoneme-directed polymerization system (Bergen, L. G., and Borisy, G. G. (1980) J. Cell Biol. 84, 141-150). With this system, the growth properties of each microtubule end can be determined from the direct visual analysis of changes in lengths of seeded microtubules. The rate of growth at both ends was inhibited equally by TC and the magnitude of the inhibition increased progressively with the molar ratio of TC to tubulin dimer (TC:T). At a TC:T ratio of approximately 0.12, all microtubule polymerization was inhibited at both ends. Therefore, substoichiometric poisoning of microtubule elongation is both a nonpolar and graded phenomenon. We determined the four association and dissociation rate constants in the presence and absence of TC and found that TC inhibits the overall growth of microtubules by reducing the association rate constants at both ends under conditions that do not alter the dissociation rate constants. Therefore, by an independent analytical method, we have confirmed Sternlicht and Ringel's hypothesis of TC action (Sternlicht, H., and Ringel, I. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 10540-10550), and have extended this hypothesis 1) by demonstrating that net growth of both ends are equally inhibited by TC, and 2) by determining which changes in the separate rate constants were responsible for the net inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1561209638,"The chromatin-bound histone deacetylase of HeLa cells has been studied using endogenous [3H]acetyl-labeled polynucleosomes containing the enzyme, prepared in the presence of 40 mM butyrate. Histone deacetylase was assayed upon removal of the butyrate, and it was found that active enzyme is found only in association with a high molecular weight complex. This deacetylase-containing complex is relatively resistant to digestion with micrococcal nuclease. No activity is found on mononucleosomes or oligonucleosomes. Up to 90% of labeled acetyl groups are removed from histone deacetylase complexes incubated in the absence of butyrate. Free histones are a poor substrate under these conditions, but histones in mononucleosomes are deacetylated when they are incubated with histone deacetylase complex. Histone deacetylase remains bound to this complex in 1-2 M NaCl and does not dissociate from it during its reaction with acetylated core histones. Under typical nuclease digestion conditions, the histone deacetylase complex contains DNA with a size distribution of 5-11 kilobase pairs and a variety of nonhistone proteins. Comparison of the protein composition of histone deacetylase complexes with that of nuclear matrix preparations shows some similarities. Taken together, the results on the chromatographic behavior, the DNA fragment sizes, and the protein composition of the deacetylase complex suggest that protein-protein interactions may be important in maintaining its structure and also in the binding of the deacetylase itself to the complex."
https://openalex.org/W1498302083,"Illumination of etiolated maize plants for 80 h brings about a 15-20-fold increase in activity of NADP malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.40). Increases in NADP malic enzyme protein and in the level of translatable mRNA for this protein occur simultaneously with the activity increase. Radiolabeled amino acids are also incorporated into NADP malic enzyme during this time. These results are consistent with the conclusion that an increase in NADP malic enzyme activity during greening results from de novo synthesis of NADP malic enzyme protein. Polyadenylated RNA extracted from greening maize leaves directs the synthesis in vitro of a protein 12,000 daltons larger than NADP malic enzyme purified from corn leaves. This protein is a precursor of NADP malic enzyme because 1) both the precursor and mature NADP malic enzyme are immunoprecipitated by antibody made against NADP malic enzyme purified from corn leaves, 2) both NADP malic enzyme protein and the level of mRNA for the precursor increase during greening, and 3) peptide maps of the precursor and of mature NADP malic enzyme are very similar. Mature NADP malic enzyme and its precursor (synthesized in vitro) both migrate on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gradient gels as doublet bands. Peptide analyses show all bands to be structurally related."
https://openalex.org/W1534576133,"The distribution and properties of cytoplasmic binding sites for the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone and the natural glucocorticoid corticosterone in the brain and the pituitary were studied in detail. Cortisol-17 beta acid, a derivative which does not bind to the glucocorticoid receptor but is a competitor of corticosterone binding to plasma, was used to overcome plasma interference. In vitro competition assays in the presence of excess cortisol acid reveal that dexamethasone is as effective a competitor for [3H]corticosterone binding as corticosterone itself. Scatchard analysis of equilibrium experiments with both steroids, using cytosol from various brain areas and from the pituitary yielded linear plots, suggesting one class of binding sites. The quantitative distribution of the sites follows the pattern: cortex greater than hippocampus greater than or equal to pituitary greater than hypothalamus greater than brain stem white matter. Furthermore, kinetic analysis of corticosterone dissociation showed a first order reaction, thus indicating the presence of one type of receptor in all brain areas examined. Rat brain cytosolic receptors for corticosterone and dexamethasone elute from DEAE-Sephadex A-50 anion exchange columns at 0.3 M NaCl in the presence of stabilizing sodium molybdate and at 0.15 M NaCl and/or in the buffer wash when heat-activated, thus exhibiting the characteristic activation pattern of rat liver cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. The ratio of the buffer wash to the 0.15 M NaCl form is low for dexamethasone and very high for corticosterone. Receptor complexes from various brain parts showed the same activation pattern. In our experiments, brain corticosterone and dexamethasone receptors stabilized by sodium molybdate are indistinguishable by a number of techniques, thus indicating that it is unnecessary to evoke specific binding sites for each glucocorticoid."
https://openalex.org/W1543464058,"Various acetylcholine receptor-rich membrane preparations from Torpedo californica electroplax tissue were examined using the techniques of differential scanning calorimetry coupled with gel electrophoretic analysis of heat-denaturing material and functional assays following passage through discrete transitions. In unfractionated membranes, four irreversible calorimetric transitions were observed, one of which (Td = 59 degrees C) could be assigned to a complete loss of acetylcholine receptor function. A second lower temperature transition apparently corresponds to loss of certain peripheral membrane proteins including the Mr = 43,000 polypeptide and the acetylcholinesterase activity. Membrane preparations highly enriched in acetylcholine receptor polypeptides contained a major transition at 59 degrees C which could be shown to be sensitive to the presence of added ligands of the acetylcholine receptor, supporting its assignment to structural alterations of the receptor protein or its arrangement in the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1608717000,"The kinetics of iodination of tyrosine and monoiodotyrosine was studied with purified hog thyroid peroxidase. The Lineweaver-Burk plots and stopped flow kinetic data both yielded a value of about 2 X 10(7) M-1 S-1 as the rate constant for reaction of Compound I with iodide. From Lineweaver-Burk plots, the rate constants for transfer of an assumed enzyme-bound iodinium cation to tyrosine, monoiodotyrosine, and GSH were estimated at 2.1 X 10(6), 3.3 X 10(6), and 3.9 X 10(7) M-1 S-1, respectively. This iodine-transferring reaction was stimulated by thyroxine, triiodothyronine, and diiodothyronine, and the effect increased with the decrease in the number of iodines in the molecules. Diiodotyrosine, during its coupling reaction, inhibited the iodinating reaction by changing the steady state intermediates of thyroid peroxidase from Compound I to Compound II. The quantitative relationship between iodinating and coupling activities of thyroid peroxidase is shown in a scheme, which suggests preferential formation of thyroxine from tyrosine by this enzyme system."
https://openalex.org/W1932864627,"The effects of four species of denitrifying bacteria on the conversion of [15N]nitrite to trioxodinitrate (HN2O3-) and N2O and of trioxodinitrate to N2O were studied. For all species, the N2O produced in the presence of [15N]nitrite and trioxodinitrate was isotopically randomized throughout the period of incubation and was not composed at the outset predominantly of 14N2O or 14N2O plus 15N2O. The N2O produced was also heavily enriched in 15N at times when the trioxodinitrate pool was only weakly enriched in 15N. By 15N NMR, the N(2) position, but not the N(1) position, of trioxodinitrate was found to become progressively labeled with 15N during incubation with [15N]nitrite. These results argue that (a) the N-N bond of trioxodinitrate is not preserved in its conversion to N2O, (b) trioxodinitrate can be neither a free nor enzyme-bound intermediate in denitrifying bacteria, and (c) the pathways from nitrite and trioxodinitrate involve a common mononitrogen intermediate. The conclusion that this intermediate is probably nitroxyl (HNO), at least with Paracoccus denitrificans and Pseudomonas stutzeri, provides indirect evidence that N-N bond formation in denitrification can occur through the dimerization of nitroxyl."
https://openalex.org/W1604885701,"Rates of p-nitroanisole O-demethylation in perfused livers from control DBA/2J and C57BL/6J, as well as from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated DBA/2J mice, reached maximal values of 15-17 mumol/g/h after 10 min of p-nitroanisole (0.2 mM) infusion. During the subsequent 30 min of p-nitroanisole infusion these rates declined steadily to 50% of the maximal rate. Infusion of 20 mM glucose completely reversed this decline in rate. Phenobarbital treatment of C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice increased rates of p-nitroanisole O-demethylation about 2.5-fold to 44.4 +/- 3.4 and 35.1 +/- 3.4 mumol/g/h, respectively, which also declined during subsequent perfusion. In contrast, the kinetics of p-nitroanisole O-demethylation in perfused livers from 3-methylcholanthrene- and beta-naphthoflavone-treated C57BL/6J were distinctly different. These livers maintained high maximal rates of p-nitroanisole O-demethylation (41.1 +/- 4.7 mumol/g/h) throughout the 40 min of p-nitroanisole infusion. 3-Methylcholanthrene-treated (C57BL/6J)(DBA/2J)F1 perfused livers also maintained high rates of monooxygenation throughout the perfusion. All livers from the 3-methylcholanthrene-treated, Ah locus-responsive F1 X DBA/2J backcross group maintained high rates of p-nitroanisole O-demethylation throughout perfusion; however, 3-methylcholanthrene-treated, Ah locus-nonresponsive perfused livers resembled livers from untreated mice. The NADP+/NADPH ratio in livers from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated C57BL/6J but not DBA/2J mice was significantly higher than controls in the absence of p-nitroanisole. Addition of p-nitroanisole increased this ratio in both groups; however, higher values were observed in livers from C57BL/6J than DBA/2J mice. These data provide genetic evidence that the ability of mouse liver to sustain high rates of monooxygenation following 3-methylcholanthrene treatment is an autosomal dominant trait corresponding with the Ah locus and most likely is due to enhanced NADPH turnover."
https://openalex.org/W1493962666,"Phycobiliproteins are a class of abundant light-harvesting proteins assembled in complex multimeric aggregates located on thylakoid membranes of red algae and cyanobacteria. This study was undertaken to investigate the molecular basis of phycobiliprotein synthesis in the unicellular red alga, Cyanidium caldarium. RNA was isolated and separated into poly(A)-enriched and poly(A)-deficient fractions by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography. Both fractions stimulated incorporation of radiolabeled amino acids into protein in a reticulocyte lysate translation system. The alpha and beta subunit polypeptides of phycocyanin were among the products of poly(A)-deficient (but not poly(A)-enriched) RNA directed translation reactions on the basis of Mr and immunological cross-reactivity with immune serum prepared against native phycocyanin. After chromatography of post-oligo(dT)-cellulose poly(A)-deficient RNA on poly(U) agarose, the messenger RNAs for the alpha and beta subunit polypeptides of phycocyanin were again recovered in the poly(A)-deficient fraction, confirming that these messenger RNAs did not appear to be polyadenylated. Automated radiosequencing of in vitro synthesized alpha and beta subunit polypeptides of phycocyanin labeled with either [35S]methionine, [3H]isoleucine, or [3H]phenylalanine revealed partial amino acid sequences which were the same as the NH2-terminal sequences of native phycocyanin subunits. This demonstrates that a transit peptide, such as that found in several proteins made in the cytosol and transported into chloroplasts, is not present on the subunits of phycocyanin."
https://openalex.org/W1509532054,"Purified calf thymus RNA polymerase II is composed primarily of species IIA and IIB. These enzymes differ in the apparent molecular weight of their largest subunit, designated IIa and IIb for enzyme forms IIA and IIB, respectively. Both enzyme forms contain an additional high molecular weight subunit designated IIc. The structural relationship between subunits IIa, IIb, and IIc, labeled with 125I under both native and denaturing conditions, has been analyzed by two-dimensional peptide mapping. Native RNA polymerase II was iodinated and subunits IIa, IIb, and IIc purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The subunits were then digested with either trypsin or thermolysin and the 125I-labeled peptides resolved by thin layer electrophoresis in the first dimension and chromatography in the second dimension. Similar peptide maps were obtained for each of the three large subunits, suggesting that subunits IIa, IIb, and IIc are related in primary sequence. Alternatively, RNA polymerase subunits IIa, IIb, and IIc were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, eluted from the gel, and then iodinated. The use of denatured subunits as substrate for the iodination eliminates the differential reactivity of specific tyrosine residues imposed by the structure of the native protein. Under these labeling conditions, the tryptic and thermolytic peptide maps of subunits IIa and IIb are nearly identical but bear much less resemblance to the peptide maps of subunit IIc than with the previous labeling procedure. These results suggest that subunits IIa and IIb are closely related in primary sequence but cannot establish whether these subunits are the products of closely related genes or are related by processing at the level of primary transcript or primary translation product. Subunit IIc bears a more distant relationship to subunits IIa and IIb. Possible reasons why this homology is only apparent in peptide maps from subunits labeled in the native enzyme are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1946692509,"Conversion of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to fully developed adipocytes in culture under the influence of dexamethasone, 1-methyl-3-isobutyl xanthine, and insulin offers a unique system to investigate differentiation-related changes in lipid metabolism. Depending on the type of isotopic precursors ([3H2]O, 32Pi, and [1-14C]acetate) used, a 10-170-fold increase in the rate of incorporation into lipid was observed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes which contained 5-10-fold higher amounts of cellular protein/culture than preadipocytes. In preadipocytes and adipocytes, the major lipids synthesized were phospholipids, triglycerides, and fatty acids. The rate of 32Pi incorporation into total lipids was 21-fold higher in adipocytes than that in preadipocytes, and 90% of the total radioactivity in both preadipocytes and adipocytes was contributed by phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylinositol (PI). The content of phospholipids was 7-8-fold higher/culture in adipocytes than that in preadipocytes, and 65 and 80% of the total phospholipids of preadipocytes and adipocytes, respectively, were composed of PC and PE. Based on DNA measurements, there was a 3-fold increase in phospholipids and an approximately 3-fold increase in protein/cell. During 3T3-L1 adipose conversion, a detectable increase in cellular protein, triglycerides, and phospholipids was observed on day 3 after induction and, thereafter, these constituents increased continuously up to day 11. Among the different phospholipids of both preadipocytes and differentiating 3T3-L1 cells, PC, PE, and PI exhibited significant changes in their rate of 32Pi incorporation during adipogenesis. While there was a continuous increase in the incorporation of 32Pi into PI, there was preferential incorporation of 32Pi into PC and PE, the significance of which is not clear. The increase in phospholipids and protein content during adipogenesis suggests that phospholipids are required for membrane biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1499479895,"A human hemoglobin solution partially saturated with carbon monoxide was rapidly quenched at -25 degrees C into a hydro-organic buffer containing ferricyanide. Under the experimental conditions of pH, ionic strength, and buffer composition used in this work, it was found that the deoxy hemes were rapidly transformed into their met form, whereas practically no carbon monoxide-bound hemes were oxidized before the separation of the mixture from the oxidizing agent. As a preliminary step to the analysis of the resulting solution, carbonylhemoglobin solutions partially oxidized with ferricyanide were studied by isoelectric focusing at -25 degrees C under identical conditions. The relative position in the gel of all nine possible valence hybrids was established as follows (going from the anodic to the cathodic side of the gel) alpha CO2 beta CO2, (alpha CO beta +)(alpha CO beta CO) (alpha CO beta CO), (alpha CO2 beta +2), (alpha + beta CO), (alpha + beta +)-(alpha CO beta CO), (alpha + beta +)(alpha CO beta +), (alpha +2 beta CO2), (alpha + beta +)(alpha + beta CO), alpha +2 beta +2. When carbonylhemoglobin and methemoglobin were mixed in equal proportion at -25 degrees C and then analyzed by isoelectric focusing at the same temperature, it was found that the contribution of valence hybrids other than alpha CO2 beta CO2 and alpha +2 beta +2 to the total amount of hemoglobin in the gel was no more than 6%. When carbonylhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin were mixed in the same proportion and incubated at 20 degrees C so to allow the redistribution of the carbon monoxide molecules between all possible binding sites to occur, a substantially higher amount of valence hybrids, derived from the oxidation of intermediate compounds of hemoglobin with carbon monoxide, was found. The isoelectric focusing separation indicated the presence in the original solution of intermediate species other than carbonylhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin at a concentration of about 10% of the total."
https://openalex.org/W10991236,"We studied the degradation and metabolism of radioactive glucosamine-labeled asialo-alpha 1-acid glycoprotein by the perfused rat liver. Removal of 130 micrograms of the protein from the perfusate occurred with a T 1/2 of 10.3 min. Radioactivity associated initially with the microsomal fraction of the tissue homogenate and was then transferred to the lysosomes where hydrolysis of N-acetylglucosamine residues took place. Radioactivity left the lysosomal-rich fraction of the homogenate with a T 1/2 of 50 min. Final accumulation of radioactivity was in the supernatant and greater than 80% of this material was found to be UDP-N-acetylhexosamines. In those studies, 10 mumol of unlabeled glucosamine had been added to the perfusate to expand the intracellular pool of UDP-GlcNAc and prevent further metabolism of any radioactive N-acetylglucosamine released by the lysosomes. When this procedure was not done, greater than one-third of the lysosomally derived N-acetylglucosamine was reused by the liver to form new radioactive glycoproteins secreted into the perfusate. Overall hydrolysis of N-acetylglucosamine from the glycoprotein substrate was greater than 80% during 2 h of perfusion. However, leupeptin, a thiol cathepsin inhibitor, decreased the release of amino sugar by 50%, even though this compound had no effect on the activity of any lysosomal glycosidase in vitro. Large glycopeptides of molecular weight 35,000 accumulated in the lysosomes due to leupeptin. From these studies, we conclude that efficient digestion of the carbohydrate component of this glycoprotein in situ requires the concerted activity of both lysosomal glycosidases and proteases."

The initial reaction has a bimolecular rate constant of approximately 539 M-1 S-1. In the presence of 1 mM sodium deoxycholate, below critical micelle concentration, 0.04 g of sodium deoxycholate was bound per g of LDL, resulting in an increase in particle radius from 102 to 128 +/- 0.3 A and an axial ratio of 5.6 for a prolate ellipsoid. Such increases were also observed using higher sodium deoxycholate concentrations and are apparently due to sodium deoxycholate-induced elongation or distortion of certain portions of LDL."

The kinetics under these conditions was consistent with a two-step binding mechanism consisting of bimolecular association followed by a unimolecular rearrangement step. However, when d-benzphetamine was added to P-450LM2 in the presence of sonicated dilauroylglyceryl-3-phosphorylcholine (0.15 mM) or any of the above detergents, CO binding followed simple second order kinetics with a bimolecular rate constant of approximately 3 x 10 M-1 s-1 at 20 degrees C. P-450LM4-CO binding kinetics was not affected by concurrent addition of phospholipid and d-benzphetamine. These results imply that simultaneous binding of amphiphile and substrate induces a conformation of reduced P-450LM2 which is different from that found when either substance is bound alone."
https://openalex.org/W1507347052,"The interaction of receptor sites in microtriches (brush-border) membranes isolated from the sparganum (larva) of the cestode (tapeworm) Spirometra mansonoides with [57Co]cyanocobalamin (CN-[57Co]Cbl) has been characterized on the basis of the following criteria: time dependence, reversibility, high-affinity binding, finite binding capacity, and ligand specificity. The association of CN-[57Co]Cbl to isolated microtriches membranes at 22 degrees C reached equilibrium in approximately 90 min. The initial rate of association follows second order kinetics with an association rate constant (ka) of 1.1 X 10(6) M-1 S-1. In the presence of an excess of unlabeled CN-Cbl, the receptor CN-[57Co]Cbl complex dissociated according to first order kinetics with a dissociation constant (kd) of 4.4 X 10(-4) S-1. An equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 0.4 nM was calculated on the basis of rate constants (KD = kd/ka). Scatchard analysis of equilibrium-binding data revealed a single class of high affinity binding sites with a KD of 0.3 nM and a maximum binding capacity for CN-Cbl of 221 fmol/mg of membrane protein. The stereo-specificity of CN-Cbl binding to receptor sites in isolated microtriches membranes was determined using various Cbl analogs. Receptor-site binding affinity was lowered by the following modifications: deamination of the b-, d-, and e-propionamide side chains to the corresponding monocarboxylate derivatives; modification of the B pyrrole ring to lactam or lactone; substitution of the benzimidazole moiety by a purine; modification of the benzimidazole; or deletion of the entire nucleotide moiety. On the basis of the action of trypsin and pronase, this CN-Cbl receptor may contain a relatively exposed membrane protein. The physiological role of this CN-Cbl receptor in the binding, internalization, and metabolism of Cbl is discussed in relation to cestodes and their mammalian hosts."
https://openalex.org/W1571400957,"Half-site reactivity in the malate thiokinase reaction was studied by measuring the reaction of enzyme-bound ligands in a series of single turnover experiments. A dimeric (alpha beta)2 enzyme form containing [14C] succinyl-CoA on one alpha beta subunit pair and [3H]succinyl-CoA on the adjacent alpha beta subunit pair was prepared. Reaction of this enzyme species with ATP or inorganic phosphate resulted in the release of half of the bound succinyl-CoA. The succinyl-CoA released comprised a 50-50 mixture of [14C]- and [3H]succinyl-CoA. Likewise, enzyme containing [32P]phosphate on one alpha beta subunit pair and nonradioactive phosphate on the adjacent alpha beta subunit pair reacted with ADP releasing half of the bound phosphate as a 50-50 mixture of radioactive and nonradioactive phosphate. These results serve to exclude an alternating site mechanism for the malate thiokinase reaction and support a random reaction of liganded subunits. In addition, it has been shown that enzyme containing 1 phosphate/(alpha beta)2 dimer is inactive toward phosphate transfer. However, succinyl-CoA served to activate this enzyme species for phosphate transfer. These results can be explained in terms of subunit asymmetry. The simplest model is one in which subunit asymmetry is induced upon ligand binding."
https://openalex.org/W1489844267,"Hemolymph (blood) of an insect, the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, contains a phospholipase A1. The specificity of this enzyme was demonstrated by the use of substrates with labeled fatty acids in specific positions and by conversion of the enzyme product, a lysophospholipid, to 2-acylglycerol by the action of bacterial phospholipase C. The insect phospholipase A1 hydrolyzes phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol, but not phosphatidylcholine or triolein. Divalent cation is required, with calcium ion being most effective, although strontium, barium, and magnesium ions also support activity. Only substrates dispersed in buffer from ethanol are hydrolyzed; ether, Triton X-100, and taurodeoxycholate are inhibitory. The enzyme has been purified 90-fold. At that stage, it is still far from homogeneous, but stability problems have hindered further purification. It has an apparent Mr = 155,000 +/- 11,000, estimated by gel permeation chromatography."
