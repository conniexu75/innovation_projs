Gosselin et al. examined the epigenetics and RNA transcripts from single microglial cells and observed consistent profiles among samples despite differences in age, sex, and diagnosis. Mouse and human microglia demonstrated similar microglia-specific gene expression profiles, as well as a shared environmental response among microglia collected either immediately after surgery (ex vivo) or after culturing (in vitro). Interestingly, those genes exhibiting differences in expression between humans and mice or after culturing were often implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. Science , this issue p. eaal3222"

How immune cells influence the function of SCs is largely unknown. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) in skin preferentially localize to hair follicles (HFs), which house a major subset of skin SCs (HFSCs). Here, we mechanistically dissect the role of Tregs in HF and HFSC biology. Lineage-specific cell depletion revealed that Tregs promote HF regeneration by augmenting HFSC proliferation and differentiation. Transcriptional and phenotypic profiling of Tregs and HFSCs revealed that skin-resident Tregs preferentially express high levels of the Notch ligand family member, Jagged 1 (Jag1). Expression of Jag1 on Tregs facilitated HFSC function and efficient HF regeneration. Taken together, our work demonstrates that Tregs in skin play a major role in HF biology by promoting the function of HFSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2619691134,"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a barrier to anti-tumor immunity. Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) is required to maintain intratumoral Treg stability and function but is dispensable for peripheral immune tolerance. Treg-restricted Nrp1 deletion results in profound tumor resistance due to Treg functional fragility. Thus, identifying the basis for Nrp1 dependency and the key drivers of Treg fragility could help to improve immunotherapy for human cancer. We show that a high percentage of intratumoral NRP1+ Tregs correlates with poor prognosis in melanoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Using a mouse model of melanoma where Nrp1-deficient (Nrp1-/-) and wild-type (Nrp1+/+) Tregs can be assessed in a competitive environment, we find that a high proportion of intratumoral Nrp1-/- Tregs produce interferon-γ (IFNγ), which drives the fragility of surrounding wild-type Tregs, boosts anti-tumor immunity, and facilitates tumor clearance. We also show that IFNγ-induced Treg fragility is required for response to anti-PD1, suggesting that cancer therapies promoting Treg fragility may be efficacious."
https://openalex.org/W2619376211,"Precise timekeeping is critical to metrology, forming the basis by which standards of time, length and fundamental constants are determined. Stable clocks are particularly valuable in spectroscopy as they define the ultimate frequency precision that can be reached. In quantum metrology, where the phase of a qubit is used to detect external fields, the clock stability is defined by the qubit coherence time, which determines the spectral linewidth and frequency precision. Here we demonstrate a quantum sensing protocol where the spectral precision goes beyond the sensor coherence time and is limited by the stability of a classical clock. Using this technique, we observe a precision in frequency estimation scaling in time $T$, as $T^{-3/2}$ for classical oscillating fields. The narrow linewidth magnetometer based on single spins in diamond is used to sense nanoscale magnetic fields with an intrinsic frequency resolution of 607 $\mu$Hz, 8 orders of magnitude narrower than the qubit coherence time."

We analyzed remotely sensed dynamics in leaf area index (LAI) and energy fluxes in order to explore the associated variation in local climate. We show that the increasing trend in LAI contributed to the warming of boreal zones through a reduction of surface albedo and to an evaporation-driven cooling in arid regions. The interplay between LAI and surface biophysics is amplified up to five times under extreme warm-dry and cold-wet years. Altogether, these signals reveal that the recent dynamics in global vegetation have had relevant biophysical impacts on the local climates and should be considered in the design of local mitigation and adaptation plans."

We have implemented a concept for quantum sensing with arbitrary frequency resolution, independent of the qubit probe and limited only by the stability of an external synchronization clock. Our concept makes use of quantum lock-in detection to continuously probe a signal of interest. Using the electronic spin of a single nitrogen vacancy center in diamond, we demonstrate detection of oscillating magnetic fields with a frequency resolution of 70 uHz over a MHz bandwidth. The continuous sampling further guarantees an excellent sensitivity, reaching a signal-to-noise ratio in excess of 10,000:1 for a 170 nT test signal measured during a one-hour interval.

https://openalex.org/W2619102305,"Genetic studies have elucidated critical roles of Piwi proteins in germline development in animals, but whether Piwi is an actual disease gene in human infertility remains unknown. We report germline mutations in human Piwi (Hiwi) in patients with azoospermia that prevent its ubiquitination and degradation. By modeling such mutations in Piwi (Miwi) knockin mice, we demonstrate that the genetic defects are directly responsible for male infertility. Mechanistically, we show that MIWI binds the histone ubiquitin ligase RNF8 in a Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA)-independent manner, and MIWI stabilization sequesters RNF8 in the cytoplasm of late spermatids. The resulting aberrant sperm show histone retention, abnormal morphology, and severely compromised activity, which can be functionally rescued via blocking RNF8-MIWI interaction in spermatids with an RNF8-N peptide. Collectively, our findings identify Piwi as a factor in human infertility and reveal its role in regulating the histone-to-protamine exchange during spermiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2617723761,"We studied the Drosophila circadian neural circuit using whole-brain imaging in vivo. Five major groups of pacemaker neurons display synchronized molecular clocks, yet each exhibits a distinct phase of daily Ca2+ activation. Light and neuropeptide pigment dispersing factor (PDF) from morning cells (s-LNv) together delay the phase of the evening (LNd) group by ∼12 hr; PDF alone delays the phase of the DN3 group by ∼17 hr. Neuropeptide sNPF, released from s-LNv and LNd pacemakers, produces Ca2+ activation in the DN1 group late in the night. The circuit also features negative feedback by PDF to truncate the s-LNv Ca2+ wave and terminate PDF release. Both PDF and sNPF suppress basal Ca2+ levels in target pacemakers with long durations by cell-autonomous actions. Thus, light and neuropeptides act dynamically at distinct hubs of the circuit to produce multiple suppressive events that create the proper tempo and sequence of circadian pacemaker neuronal activities."

Berry phases typically have been accessed through interference experiments. Here, we demonstrate an unusual Berry-phase-induced spectroscopic feature: a sudden and large increase in the energy of angular-momentum states in circular graphene p-n junction resonators when a small critical magnetic field is reached. This behavior results from turning on a $\pi$-Berry phase associated with the topological properties of Dirac fermions in graphene. The Berry phase can be switched on and off with small magnetic field changes on the order of 10 mT, potentially enabling a variety of optoelectronic graphene device applications."

Using two freely propagating surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) interfering on a lossy beam splitter, we show that the presence of loss enables us to modify the reflection and transmission factors of the beam splitter, thus revealing quantum interference paths that do not exist in a lossless configuration. We investigate the two-plasmon interference on beam splitters with different sets of reflection and transmission factors. Through coincidence-detection measurements, we observe either coalescence or anti-coalescence of SPPs. The results show that losses can be viewed as a degree of freedom to control quantum processes."

Hüpers et al. analyzed sediments recovered from the Sumatran megathrust.

https://openalex.org/W2619938809,"Leishmaniasis is one of the leading globally neglected diseases, affecting millions of people worldwide. Leishmania infection depends on the ability of insect-transmitted metacyclic promastigotes to invade mammalian hosts, differentiate into amastigotes, and replicate inside macrophages. To counter the hostile oxidative environment inside macrophages, these protozoans contain anti-oxidant systems that include iron-dependent superoxide dismutases (SODs) in mitochondria and glycosomes. Increasing evidence suggests that in addition to this protective role, Leishmania mitochondrial SOD may also initiate H2O2-mediated redox signaling that regulates gene expression and metabolic changes associated with differentiation into virulent forms. To investigate this hypothesis, we examined the specific role of SODA, the mitochondrial SOD isoform in Leishmania amazonensis. Our inability to generate L. amazonensis SODA null mutants and the lethal phenotype observed following RNAi-mediated silencing of the Trypanosoma brucei SODA ortholog suggests that SODA is essential for trypanosomatid survival. L. amazonensis metacyclic promastigotes lacking one SODA allele failed to replicate in macrophages and were severely attenuated in their ability to generate cutaneous lesions in mice. Reduced expression of SODA also resulted in mitochondrial oxidative damage and failure of SODA/ΔsodA promastigotes to differentiate into axenic amastigotes. SODA expression above a critical threshold was also required for the development of metacyclic promastigotes, as SODA/ΔsodA cultures were strongly depleted in this infective form and more susceptible to reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced stress. Collectively, our data suggest that SODA promotes Leishmania virulence by protecting the parasites against mitochondrion-generated oxidative stress and by initiating ROS-mediated signaling mechanisms required for the differentiation of infective forms.

Leishmaniasis affects an estimated 12 million people worldwide, with an estimated 350 million at risk of infection (1World Health OrganizationControl of the leishmaniases.World Health Organ. Tech. Rep. Ser. 2010; 2010 (1–186): xii-xiiiGoogle Scholar). Depending on the Leishmania species, symptoms vary from self-healing skin lesions to a visceralizing form that can be lethal. The absence of efficacious and cost-effective drugs, combined with the emergence of drug resistance, accentuates the critical need for new therapeutic targets. The life cycle of Leishmania spp. alternates between non-virulent promastigotes inside the insect vectors and virulent amastigotes inside mammalian hosts. Transmission of the parasites to mammals occurs through sand fly bites (2Bates P.A. Leishmania sand fly interaction: progress and challenges.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2008; 11: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Amastigotes are adapted to survive and replicate inside acidic parasitophorous vacuoles of macrophages. After ingestion by sand flies during a blood meal, amastigotes transform into promastigotes, which replicate in the fly's digestive tract. As nutrients become depleted, promastigotes cease to replicate and move up the sand fly gut toward the proboscis, where they mature into infective metacyclic forms. Metacyclics are reintroduced into new hosts during the next feeding cycle and enter host macrophages where they transform into amastigotes. To adapt to the rapidly changing environmental conditions during its life cycle, Leishmania undergoes extensive morphological and metabolic changes orchestrated at the post-transcriptional and post-translational levels (3Rosenzweig D.

Recent evidence indicates that H2O2 generated within mitochondria through the action of SOD plays a central role in regulating differentiation of L. amazonensis promastigotes into infective amastigotes (16Mittra B.

A trypanosomatid iron transporter that regulates mitochondrial function is required for Leishmania amazonensis virulence.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12: e1005340Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Given that SOD enzymes in trypanosomatid protozoa exclusively utilize iron as an essential co-factor (18Taylor M.C. Kelly J.M. Iron metabolism in trypanosomatids, and its crucial role in infection.Parasitology. 2010; 137: 899-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), these enzymes have emerged as important links between iron and ROS-regulated differentiation pathways in L. amazonensis. Notably, the role of H2O2 in triggering promastigote to amastigote differentiation was directly demonstrated during studies of iron uptake in L. amazonensis promastigotes (16Mittra B. Cortez M. Haydock A. Ramasamy G. Myler P.J. Andrews N.W. Iron uptake controls the generation of Leishmania infective forms through regulation of ROS levels.J. Exp. Med. 2013; 210: 401-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies with L. amazonensis lines defective in mitochondrial iron import (LMIT1/Δlmit1) implicated mitochondrial iron-dependent SOD (SODA) and mitochondrion-generated ROS in the generation of virulent forms (17Mittra B. Laranjeira-Silva M.F. Perrone Bezerra de Menezes J. Jensen J. Michailowsky V. Andrews N.W. A trypanosomatid iron transporter that regulates mitochondrial function is required for Leishmania amazonensis virulence.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12: e1005340Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Further supporting a role for SODA and H2O2 in the development of virulence in L. amazonensis, two cues known to trigger in vitro amastigote differentiation, low pH and high temperature (19Zilberstein D. Shapira M. The role of pH and temperature in the development of Leishmania parasites.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 449-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), are also effective triggers of ROS generation (20Wilson M.E. Andersen K.A. Britigan B.E.

Acidic environment leads to ROS-induced MAPK signaling in cancer cells.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e22445Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Exposure to elevated temperature is thought to lead to hyper-polarization of mitochondria, increased respiratory rate, and an ROS surge that is not only tolerated by Leishmania but is actually used as a differentiation signal. Stationary phase promastigotes show increased resistance to oxidative stress and enhanced SOD activity as they differentiate into amastigotes. In contrast, low SOD activity induces logarithmic phase promastigotes to accumulate higher levels of ROS and to undergo apoptosis, a process that can be reversed by overexpression of mitochondrial SODA (21Alzate J.F. Arias A.A. Moreno-Mateos D. Alvarez-Barrientos A. Jiménez-Ruiz A. Mitochondrial superoxide mediates heat-induced apoptotic-like death in Leishmania infantum.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2007; 152: 192-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Here, we confirm the prediction that iron import into mitochondria is required for activity of L. amazonensis SODA. Furthermore, by targeting the SODA gene for allelic knock-out and examining the phenotype of mutant lines, we conclude that SODA expression is required for maintaining mitochondrial redox balance and also for the development of parasite virulent forms. In earlier work, we identified LMIT1, an L. amazonensis mitochondrial iron transporter, and we suggested that the reduced ability of LMIT1/Δlmit1 promastigotes to import iron into mitochondria and activate the iron-dependent SODA might be responsible for their failure to differentiate into amastigotes (17Mittra B. Laranjeira-Silva M.F. Perrone Bezerra de Menezes J. Jensen J. Michailowsky V. Andrews N.W. A trypanosomatid iron transporter that regulates mitochondrial function is required for Leishmania amazonensis virulence.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12: e1005340Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was largely based on the reduced SOD activity observed in total parasite extracts and on morphological evidence for mitochondrial oxidative damage in LMIT1/Δlmit1 parasites subjected to the low pH/high temperature protocol for axenic amastigote differentiation. To directly investigate the specific role of SODA in the signaling process leading to amastigote differentiation, we developed antibodies capable of distinguishing the mitochondrial SODA from glycosomal SODB, and we compared SOD activity in mitochondrial fractions of wild-type and LMIT1/Δlmit1 parasites undergoing low pH/high temperature-induced axenic differentiation. Specific polyclonal antibodies against mitochondrial SODA and SODB were generated using purified recombinant proteins (supplemental Fig. S1). The immunofluorescence localization of anti-SODA antibodies was identical to the staining pattern of MitoTracker Red, a mitochondrion-specific dye (Fig. 1A). This result demonstrates the mitochondrial localization of endogenous SODA, as proposed earlier based on overexpression of GFP-tagged SODA (23Getachew F. Gedamu L.

To obtain mitochondrion-enriched fractions free of glycosomal contaminants, subcellular fractionation of promastigotes expressing a 3×FLAG-tagged form of the LMIT1 mitochondrial iron transporter was carried out with increasing concentrations of digitonin, as described previously (17Mittra B.

Immunoblot with the specific antibodies against SODA or SODB confirmed that >90% of the endogenous SODA co-fractionated with LMIT1 in mitochondrion-enriched fractions, whereas >95% of endogenous SODB was found in the soluble fraction (Fig. 1B). SOD activity was then quantified in mitochondrion-enriched fractions prepared from wild-type (WT) and LMIT1/Δlmit1 promastigotes. These two lines were subjected to the low pH/high temperature conditions previously shown to trigger amastigote differentiation in WT but not in LMIT1/Δlmit1 (17Mittra B. Laranjeira-Silva M.F. Perrone Bezerra de Menezes J. Jensen J. Michailowsky V. Andrews N.W. A trypanosomatid iron transporter that regulates mitochondrial function is required for Leishmania amazonensis virulence.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12: e1005340Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). WT parasites showed a gradual increase in mitochondrion-associated SOD activity and SODA protein levels during differentiation (Fig. 2, A–C), consistent with the SOD activity increase we reported earlier for whole-cell extracts (17Mittra B. Laranjeira-Silva M.F. Perrone Bezerra de Menezes J. Jensen J. Michailowsky V. Andrews N.W. A trypanosomatid iron transporter that regulates mitochondrial function is required for Leishmania amazonensis virulence.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12: e1005340Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contrast, although SOD activity in LMIT1/Δlmit1 cells was slightly higher during early differentiation (6 h), it was ∼2.5-fold lower than WT at the 48-h time point when most WT parasites had already assumed the rounded morphology typical of amastigotes (Fig. 2A). Western blot analysis showed comparable amounts of SODA protein and only trace levels of SODB in both WT and LMIT1/Δlmit1 mitochondrial fractions (Fig. 2, B and C), indicating that the reduced SOD activity in LMIT1/Δlmit1 cells is likely to reflect SODA inactivation as a result of impaired LMIT1-mediated iron import into mitochondria. Importantly, we also observed down-regulation (of about 2-fold) in the expression of ascorbate-dependent peroxidase (APX) in LMIT1/Δlmit1 mitochondrial lysates, when compared with WT (Fig. 2, B and C). Expression of APX, a mitochondrial protein required for the enzymatic breakdown of H2O2 in Leishmania, is known to be up-regulated in response to H2O2 accumulation (26Pal S. Dolai S. Yadav R.K. Adak S. Ascorbate peroxidase from Leishmania major controls the virulence of infective stage of promastigotes by regulating oxidative stress.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e11271Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results demonstrate that differentiation of L. amazonensis promastigotes into infective amastigotes is associated with activation of the mitochondrial iron-dependent SODA and accumulation of H2O2, a ROS previously shown to directly trigger differentiation (16Mittra B. Cortez M. Haydock A. Ramasamy G. Myler P.J. Andrews N.W. Iron uptake controls the generation of Leishmania infective forms through regulation of ROS levels.J. Exp. Med. 2013; 210: 401-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To further understand how mitochondrial SODA regulates the ROS signaling pathway leading to amastigote differentiation, we proceeded to generate SODA null mutants. Knock-out constructs carrying drug resistance gene cassettes flanked by 5′- and 3′-UTR regions of the SODA gene were generated and used for gene replacement through homologous recombination (supplemental Fig. S2A). Replacement of a single SODA allele with HYG or PHLEO drug resistance gene cassettes was possible, and allelic integration into the desired locus was confirmed in each case by PCR and Southern blot analysis (supplemental Fig. S2B). SODA/ΔsodA promastigotes showed ∼53% reduction in SODA protein levels as the parasites reached early stationary growth, when compared with WT (Fig. 3). During the log phase of growth, both SODA and SODB were expressed at lower levels, and no significant difference was observed between WT and SODA/ΔsodA (Fig. 3, A and B). Repeated attempts to generate a SODA null line by replacing the second allele were unsuccessful. Similar to our previous experience with LMIT1, a SODA ORF was consistently detected in lines resistant to both phleomycin and hygromycin, even when the intended in situ integration of the targeting drug resistance markers was confirmed. Thus, SODA appears to be essential for the viability of L. amazonensis promastigotes. Providing further evidence that SODA is an essential gene in trypanosomatid parasites, tetracycline-inducible RNAi-mediated ablation of SODA in T. brucei procyclic forms (supplemental Fig. S3A) markedly impaired the parasites' ability to sustain replication after 72 h in culture (supplemental Fig. S3B). T. brucei procyclics were reported to be partially dependent on mitochondrial metabolism (27van Weelden S.W. Fast B. Vogt A. van der Meer P. Saas J. van Hellemond J.J. Tielens A.G. Boshart M.

Energy metabolism of trypanosomatids: adaptation to available carbon sources.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 149: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), suggesting that the phenotype we observed may be related to gradual mitochondrial damage as accumulated ROS reach toxic levels in the absence of SODA. Given our inability to generate SODA null mutants, we compared the properties of single knock-out SODA/ΔsodA (hyg) and WT promastigotes. When promastigote cultures were shifted to axenic amastigote growth conditions (pH 4.5, 32 °C), after an initial lag period of 48 h WT parasites replicated steadily throughout the monitored period (144 h) (Fig. 4A). In contrast, parasites lacking one SODA allele showed very poor growth and a gradual loss in viability, as indicated by propidium iodide staining (data not shown). Marked differences were also observed in parasite morphology 48 h after the low pH/high temperature shift. About 95% of the WT population showed the expected change into the rounded/aflagellated amastigote form, whereas the majority (∼55%) of the viable SODA/ΔsodA parasites retained long flagella and showed marked morphological abnormalities (Fig. 4, B and C). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed extensive mitochondrial alterations in SODA/ΔsodA parasites (Fig. 4D) that were reminiscent of what we previously observed in LMIT1/Δlmit1 promastigotes (17Mittra B. Laranjeira-Silva M.F. Perrone Bezerra de Menezes J. Jensen J. Michailowsky V. Andrews N.W. A trypanosomatid iron transporter that regulates mitochondrial function is required for Leishmania amazonensis virulence.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12: e1005340Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were enlarged and deformed, with an overall reduction in electron density and accumulation of dense aggregates in the matrix. Normal mitochondrial morphology and a normal ability to differentiate and replicate as amastigotes were restored when SODA/ΔsodA parasites were complemented with episomally expressed SODA (SODA/ΔsodA + SODA) (Fig. 4, A–C). In addition to the low pH/high temperature stimuli, in previous work we showed that up-regulation of the iron uptake machinery in response to iron deprivation also triggers differentiation of L. amazonensis promastigotes into amastigotes in a process dependent on mitochondrial H2O2, the product of SODA (16Mittra B. Cortez M. Haydock A. Ramasamy G. Myler P.J. Andrews N.W. Iron uptake controls the generation of Leishmania infective forms through regulation of ROS levels.J. Exp.

A trypanosomatid iron transporter that regulates mitochondrial function is required for Leishmania amazonensis virulence.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12: e1005340Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, we also examined the effects of iron deprivation on the growth and differentiation of SODA/ΔsodA promastigotes. When cultured in iron-deficient medium, both WT and SODA-deficient parasites were initially able to replicate but reached a maximum cell density (∼3 × 107/ml) that was lower than what is normally observed in complete growth medium (Fig. 5A, compare with WT in Fig. 6A). However, in contrast to WT, the SODA/ΔsodA promastigote count steadily declined after reaching the peak density (Fig. 5A), resembling the “population crash” we previously reported for Δlit1/Δlit1 (lacking the ferrous iron transporter LIT1) and LMIT1/Δlmit1 (partially deficient in the mitochondrial iron importer LMIT1) parasites grown in iron-depleted medium (16Mittra B. Cortez M. Haydock A. Ramasamy G. Myler P.J. Andrews N.W. Iron uptake controls the generation of Leishmania infective forms through regulation of ROS levels.J. Exp.

A trypanosomatid iron transporter that regulates mitochondrial function is required for Leishmania amazonensis virulence.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12: e1005340Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Microscopic analysis of the cultures showed that on day 5 of iron deprivation >55% of WT parasites lacked a visible flagellum and had assumed the rounded amastigote-like morphology, whereas only 20% of viable SODA/ΔsodA cells were able to undergo this transformation (Fig. 5B). Complementation with episomally expressed SODA (SODA/ΔsodA + SODA) partially restored both the growth pattern and the parasite's ability to transform into amastigote-like forms (Fig. 5, A and B). Taken together, the results described in this section show that mitochondrial SODA is important for the differentiation of L. amazonensis promastigotes into amastigotes after both types of stimulation, low pH/high temperature and iron deprivation.Figure 6SODA/ΔsodA promastigotes are more susceptible to ROS stress.

Human RAD52 has been shown to mediate single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and is synthetic lethal with mutations in other key recombination proteins. For this study, we used single-molecule imaging and ssDNA curtains to examine the binding interactions of human RAD52 with replication protein A (RPA)-coated ssDNA, and we monitored the fate of RAD52 during assembly of the presynaptic complex. We show that RAD52 binds tightly to the RPA-ssDNA complex and imparts an inhibitory effect on RPA turnover. We also found that during presynaptic complex assembly, most of the RPA and RAD52 was displaced from the ssDNA, but some RAD52-RPA-ssDNA complexes persisted as interspersed clusters surrounded by RAD51 filaments. Once assembled, the presence of RAD51 restricted formation of new RAD52-binding events, but additional RAD52 could bind once RAD51 dissociated from the ssDNA. Together, these results provide new insights into the behavior and dynamics of human RAD52 during presynaptic complex assembly and disassembly.

During DSB repair, long 3′ ssDNA overhangs are generated by nucleases that resect the newly generated dsDNA end in the 5′ → 3′ direction (23.Cejka P.

These ssDNA overhangs are first bound by replication protein A (RPA), which protects the ssDNA from nucleases and also helps remove secondary structures (26.Chen R. Wold M.S.

Despite the wealth of information available for S. cerevisiae Rad52, the exact role(s) human RAD52 in homologous recombination remains largely unclear. Here, we use two-color single-molecule imaging and ssDNA curtains to begin examining the dynamics of human RAD52, RPA, and RAD51 on ssDNA during presynaptic complex assembly. We show that RAD52 binds very tightly to RPA-ssDNA, and the presence of RAD52 restricts facilitated exchange of RPA, highlighting a potential regulatory role of RAD52 that is conserved from yeast to humans. Although most of the bound RAD52 and RPA is displaced upon addition of RAD51, we find that many small RAD52-RPA clusters remain embedded between longer RAD51 filaments. However, RAD52 appears incapable of directly associating with regions of ssDNA that are coated by RAD51, suggesting that RAD52 cannot bind to internal regions of the RAD51 filaments. Together, these data begin to provide new insights into the behavior of human RAD52 during presynaptic complex assembly. We have previously shown that S. cerevisiae Rad52 binds very tightly to ssDNA coated with yeast RPA (65.Gibb B. Ye L.F. Kwon Y. Niu H. Sung P. Greene E.C. Protein dynamics during presynaptic-complex assembly on individual single-stranded DNA molecules.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21: 893-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Given the high degree of conservation, we hypothesized that human RAD52 should behave similarly. For single molecule visualization, we expressed human RAD52 as fusion construct labeled at the N terminus with GFP. Previous studies have shown that GFP-tagged RAD52 is targeted to repair foci in vivo (66.Lisby M. Rothstein R. Mortensen U.H. Rad52 forms DNA repair and recombination centers during S phase.Proc.

GFP-RAD52 was also able to overcome RPA-mediated inhibition of ssDNA at levels comparable with those of unlabeled RAD52 (Fig. 1, C and D).

When 50 pm GFP-RAD52 was injected into the sample chambers, we were able to readily detect binding of individual GFP-RAD52 complexes to both RFP-tagged RPA-ssDNA (Fig. 2B) and also to unlabeled RPA-ssDNA (Fig. 2C). At the low protein concentrations used in these reactions, the GFP-RAD52 complexes bound as discrete puncta to the RPA-ssDNA. However, when the concentration of the GFP-RAD52 injection was increased to 600 pm, the RAD52 complexes were able to coat the entire RPA-ssDNA molecules (Fig. 2E). Given these findings, subsequent experiments were conducted at 50 pm GFP-RAD52, unless stated otherwise. When viewed in real time, we could detect individual GFP-RAD52-binding events on ssDNA bound by either RPA-RFP (Fig. 3A) or bound by unlabeled RPA (Fig. 3B). In contrast to these results with RPA-ssDNA, we could detect no binding of GFP-RAD52 to a control surface that did not have a tethered ssDNA substrate (Fig. 3C), confirming that the GFP-RAD52-binding events only occurred on the RPA-ssDNA. We saw no evidence of either cooperative binding as would be evidenced by nucleation and spreading of GFP-RAD52 along the RPA-ssDNA. Instead, GFP-RAD52 binding always occurred as discrete events (Fig. 3, A and B). This finding is in contrast to our prior results with S. cerevisiae Rad52, which binds and appears to spread more extensively along the RPA-ssDNA complexes (65.Gibb B. Ye L.F. Kwon Y. Niu H. Sung P.

Astronauts with ophthalmic issues had significantly higher plasma concentrations of metabolites that are associated with the 1-carbon metabolic pathway than those without ophthalmic issues. We hypothesized that genetic differences might explain the metabolite differences. Indeed, genetics and B vitamin status were significant predictors of ophthalmic issues. We now have developed a hypothesis regarding the mechanisms that link 1-carbon pathway genetics and the condition that we suggest calling, ""astronaut ophthalmic syndrome."" We maintain that this condition is genetically predisposed and is associated with endothelial dysfunction that is induced by oxidative stress. Subsequent edema can hinder cerebrospinal fluid efflux and can lead to locally increased pressures in the subarachnoid space within the orbit, which impinges on the optic nerve and/or eye in affected individuals. Confirming this hypothesis will help characterize the genetics of 1-carbon pathway metabolism, homocysteine, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and cardiovascular and potentially other diseases.-Zwart, S.

https://openalex.org/W2619243454,"Ubiquitous polyamine spermidine is not required for normal planktonic growth of Bacillus subtilis but is essential for robust biofilm formation. However, the structural features of spermidine required for B. subtilis biofilm formation are unknown and so are the molecular mechanisms of spermidine-stimulated biofilm development. We report here that in a spermidine-deficient B. subtilis mutant, the structural analogue norspermidine, but not homospermidine, restored biofilm formation. Intracellular biosynthesis of another spermidine analogue, aminopropylcadaverine, from exogenously supplied homoagmatine also restored biofilm formation. The differential ability of C-methylated spermidine analogues to functionally replace spermidine in biofilm formation indicated that the aminopropyl moiety of spermidine is more sensitive to C-methylation, which it is essential for biofilm formation, but that the length and symmetry of the molecule is not critical. Transcriptomic analysis of a spermidine-depleted B. subtilis speD mutant uncovered a nitrogen-, methionine-, and S-adenosylmethionine-sufficiency response, resulting in repression of gene expression related to purine catabolism, methionine and S-adenosylmethionine biosynthesis and methionine salvage, and signs of altered membrane status. Consistent with the spermidine requirement in biofilm formation, single-cell analysis of this mutant indicated reduced expression of the operons for production of the exopolysaccharide and TasA protein biofilm matrix components and SinR antagonist slrR. Deletion of sinR or ectopic expression of slrR in the spermidine-deficient ΔspeD background restored biofilm formation, indicating that spermidine is required for expression of the biofilm regulator slrR. Our results indicate that spermidine functions in biofilm development by activating transcription of the biofilm matrix exopolysaccharide and TasA operons through the regulator slrR."

Down-regulation or mislocalization of nephrin has been observed in diabetic kidney disease (DKD), characterized by albuminuria. Here, we investigate the role of protein kinase C and casein kinase 2 substrate in neurons 2 (PACSIN2), a regulator of endocytosis and recycling, in the trafficking of nephrin and development of DKD. We observe that PACSIN2 is up-regulated and nephrin mislocalized in podocytes of obese Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats that have altered renal function. In cultured podocytes, PACSIN2 and nephrin colocalize and interact. We show that nephrin is endocytosed in PACSIN2-positive membrane regions and that PACSIN2 overexpression increases both nephrin endocytosis and recycling. We identify rabenosyn-5, which is involved in early endosome maturation and endosomal sorting, as a novel interaction partner of PACSIN2. Interestingly, rabenosyn-5 expression is increased in podocytes in obese ZDF rats, and, in vitro, its overexpression enhances the association of PACSIN2 and nephrin. We also show that palmitate, which is elevated in diabetes, enhances this association. Collectively, PACSIN2 is up-regulated and nephrin is abnormally localized in podocytes of diabetic ZDF rats. In vitro, PACSIN2 enhances nephrin turnover apparently via a mechanism involving rabenosyn-5. The data suggest that elevated PACSIN2 expression accelerates nephrin trafficking and associates with albuminuria.—Dumont, V., Tolvanen, T. A., Kuusela, S., Wang, H., Nyman, T.

In this study, we examined the possible role of MKL/SRF in the context of regulation of profilin (Pfn), a major controller of actin dynamics and actin cytoskeletal remodeling in cells. We demonstrated that despite being located on different genomic loci, two major isoforms of Pfn (Pfn1 and Pfn2) are co-regulated by a common mechanism involving the action of MKL that is independent of its SRF-related activity. We found that MKL co-regulates the expression of Pfn isoforms indirectly by modulating signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and utilizing its SAP-domain function. Unexpectedly, our studies revealed that cellular externalization, rather than transcription of Pfn1, is affected by the perturbations of MKL. We further demonstrated that MKL can influence cell migration by modulating Pfn1 expression, indicating a functional connection between MKL and Pfn1 in actin-dependent cellular processes. Finally, we provide initial evidence supporting the ability of Pfn to influence MKL and SRF expression.

NagBb is involved in assimilation of O-glycans on mucin glycoproteins by B. bifidum in the human gastrointestinal tract, but its catalytic mechanism has remained elusive because of a lack of sequence homology around putative catalytic residues and of other structural information. Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of NagBb, representing the first GH129 family structure, solved by the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method based on sulfur atoms of the native protein. We determined ligand-free, GalNAc, and inhibitor complex forms of NagBb and found that Asp-435 and Glu-478 are located in the catalytic domain at appropriate positions for direct nucleophilic attack at the anomeric carbon and proton donation for the glycosidic bond oxygen, respectively. A highly conserved Asp-330 forms a hydrogen bond with the O4 hydroxyl of GalNAc in the −1 subsite, and Trp-398 provides a stacking platform for the GalNAc pyranose ring. Interestingly, a metal ion, presumably Ca2+, is involved in the recognition of the GalNAc N-acetyl group. Mutations at Asp-435, Glu-478, Asp-330, and Trp-398 and residues involved in metal coordination (including an all-Ala quadruple mutant) significantly reduced the activity, indicating that these residues and the metal ion play important roles in substrate recognition and catalysis.

A highly conserved Asp-330 forms a hydrogen bond with the O4 hydroxyl of GalNAc in the −1 subsite, and Trp-398 provides a stacking platform for the GalNAc pyranose ring. Interestingly, a metal ion, presumably Ca2+, is involved in the recognition of the GalNAc N-acetyl group. Mutations at Asp-435, Glu-478, Asp-330, and Trp-398 and residues involved in metal coordination (including an all-Ala quadruple mutant) significantly reduced the activity, indicating that these residues and the metal ion play important roles in substrate recognition and catalysis. Interestingly, NagBb exhibited some structural similarities to the GH101 endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidases, but several critical differences in substrate recognition and reaction mechanism account for the different activities of these two enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2617391709,"Background The atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), which is the logarithmic ratio of triglyceride (TG) to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), had a linear relationship with clinical outcomes in the general population. However, the association of each lipid profile, TG and HDL-C, with survival was not straightforward in dialysis patients. This non-linear association led us to further investigate the prognostic impact of the AIP in these patients. Methods From a nationwide prospective cohort, 1,174 incident dialysis patients were included. Patients were categorized into quintiles according to the AIP. An independent association of the AIP with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality was determined. Results During a mean follow-up duration of 33.2 months, 170 patients (14.5%) died, and cardiovascular death was observed in 55 patients (4.7%). Multivariate Cox analyses revealed that the lowest (quintile 1, hazard ratio [HR] = 1.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02–3.03) and the highest (quintile 5, HR = 2.15, 95% CI = 1.26–3.65) AIP groups were significantly associated with higher all-cause mortality compared to patients in quintile 3 (reference group). In terms of cardiovascular mortality, only the highest AIP group (quintile 5, HR = 2.59, 95% CI = 1.06–6.34) was significantly associated with increased risk of mortality. Sensitivity analyses showed that a U-shaped association between the AIP and all-cause mortality remained significant in non-diabetic and underweight to normal body mass index patients. Conclusions Both the highest and the lowest AIP groups were independently associated with all-cause mortality, showing a U-shaped association. It suggested further studies are needed to identify targets and subgroups that can benefit from intervention of the AIP in incident dialysis patients."

We confirmed that the production of the autoantibodies GFAP and glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) was increased and inversely correlated with the concentration of secreted C peptide in female nonobese diabetic mice (T1DM model). Importantly, the development of T1DM in female nonobese diabetic mice at 30 wk of age was predicted by the positive GFAP autoantibody titer at 17 wk. The production of GFAP and GAD65 autoantibodies was also increased in KK-Ay mice [type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) model]. In patients with diabetes mellitus, GFAP autoantibody levels were increased in patients with either T1DM or T2DM, and were significantly associated with GAD65 autoantibodies but not zinc transporter 8 autoantibodies. Furthermore, we identified a B-cell epitope of GFAP corresponding to the GFAP autoantibody in both mice and patients with diabetes. Thus, these results indicate that autoantibodies against GFAP could serve as a predictive marker for the development of overt autoimmune diabetes.—Pang, Z., Kushiyama, A., Sun, J., Kikuchi, T., Yamazaki, H., Iwamoto, Y., Koriyama, H., Yoshida, S., Shimamura, M., Higuchi, M., Kawano, T., Takami, Y., Rakugi, H., Morishita, R., Nakagumi, H.

https://openalex.org/W2619461336,"Mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are important processes in kidney development. Failure to undergo MET during development leads to the initiation of Wilms tumor, whereas EMT contributes to the development of renal cell carcinomas (RCC). The role of calcium regulators in governing these processes is becoming evident. We demonstrated earlier that Na+/Ca2+ exchanger 1 (NCX1), a major calcium exporter in renal epithelial cells, regulates epithelial cell motility. Here, we show for the first time that NCX1 mRNA and protein expression was down-regulated in Wilms tumor and RCC. Knockdown of NCX1 in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells induced fibroblastic morphology, increased intercellular junctional distance, and induced paracellular permeability, loss of apico-basal polarity in 3D cultures, and anchorage-independent growth, accompanied by expression of mesenchymal markers. We also provide evidence that NCX1 interacts with and anchors E-cadherin to the cell surface independent of NCX1 ion transport activity. Consistent with destabilization of E-cadherin, NCX1 knockdown cells showed an increase in β-catenin nuclear localization, enhanced transcriptional activity, and up-regulation of downstream targets of the β-catenin signaling pathway. Taken together, knockdown of NCX1 in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells alters epithelial morphology and characteristics by destabilization of E-cadherin and induction of β-catenin signaling."

Our aim was to determine the association between cholecystectomy and the CRC risk in IBD.We first obtained the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHRID), which contains information on approximately 24.7 million insured individuals. A cohort study was conducted using the data from the NHIRD, and included cohort patients with IBD who had experienced a cholecystectomy between the years 1998 and 2010. The non-cholecystectomy cohort comprised the remaining IBD patients who had not undergone a cholecystectomy. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to determine the effects cholecystectomy have on the risks of developing CRC, as shown by Hazard Ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).The incidence rate of CRC among IBD patients who had undergone a cholecystectomy (n = 525) was 1.75 per 1,000 person-years, compared to 1.41 per 1,000 person-years among IBD patients who had not had a cholecystectomy (n = 525). The adjusted HRs for CRC was found to be 0.76 (95% CI 0.25-2.32) for IBD patients having received a cholecystectomy, after adjusting for age, gender, and comorbidities. By type of IBD, neither ulcerative colitis nor Crohn's diseases are associated with CRC after a cholecystectomy adjusted HR (2.78 [95% CI 0.54-14.3]) and (0.13 [95% CI 0.01-1.49]).In Taiwan, cholecystectomies are not associated with a risk of CRC in patients with IBD."

Coral reefs serve as natural barriers that protect coastal regions from storms and erosion, but climate change, ocean acidification, and other stressors from human activities are increasingly causing coral reefs to degrade. Yates et al. report evidence of seafloor erosion in five coral reef ecosystems in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Caribbean. Comparison with historical data shows that over the past few decades, seafloor elevation has decreased by 0.09 to 0.8 m at the study sites—far more than expected on the basis of model predictions. Together with sea level rise from climate change, the seafloor erosion at these sites results in deeper water and puts coastal populations at increased risk.

Infection with rhinovirus is a common cause of allergic asthma. Toussaint et al. studied how the virus triggers inflammation and stimulates an asthmatic attack. Rhinovirus infection causes the release of host double-stranded DNA and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs are structures that capture microorganisms and activate immune cells and inflammatory responses. The authors show that rhinovirus-driven NETs promote the infiltration of inflammatory cells to the airways, causing the clinical features of an allergic response. Treatment with a compound blocking NET formation stopped the asthma from becoming worse.

Solid-state convection has operated in the mantle since Earth's formation 4.56 billion years ago. This is difficult to reconcile with evidence for ancient and isolated regions of the mantle, though. Ballmer et al. propose bridgmanite-enriched ancient mantle structures (BEAMS) as a solution to this riddle. BEAMS have a low Mg/Si ratio, and their presence would cause a relative increase in the mantle mineral bridgmanite, along with a 20-fold viscosity increase. BEAMS may square many odd features in the lower mantle with the geochemical signatures of ancient, isolated, and persistent mantle regions.

Hotter summers in the future will make Americans more reluctant to exercise.

Our willingness to be physically active in our free time is influenced by weather; common excuses for not exercising are that it is too hot, too cold, or too wet. Obradovich and Fowler analyzed historical meteorological data and exercise surveillance data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and they developed a model to predict human responses to climate change in the next few decades. The model incorporated variables to compensate for city-specific differences (e.g., infrastructure). It appears that by 2050, climate change might result in physically active person-months increasing by 40, on average, per 1000 individuals. Over the course of this century, Americans could become more physically active in their free time in northern areas of the country, but less active in the summer, especially in southern regions.
