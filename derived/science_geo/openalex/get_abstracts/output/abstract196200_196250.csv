The symptoms of these conditions are ascribed to the release of serotonin to the blood and tissues2. They consist primarily in cutaneous vasomotor signs (flushing), tachycardia, asthma-like dyspnoea and hyperperistalsis. Right-sided heart disease with tricuspid and pulmonal valvular lesions are noted in some but not in all cases. In prolonged cases pulmonary stenosis appears to be a fairly constant sign. Firm connective-tissue masses have been found to envelop the pelvic organs, as well as the iliac and hypogastric arteries. Considerable masses of connective tissue have also been observed deep to the cardiac valves, and microscopic examination has revealed connective tissue proliferation3. Articular swelling has been observed2. Hedinger and Gloor3 mention the possibility that carcinoids and their metastases may secrete a substance stimulating connective-tissue formation."

The inhibition of P/O ratios from the mitochondria was 60 per cent; from kidney, 54 per cent; from heart, 51 per cent; and from skeletal muscle, 87 per cent."

The former method does not take the shape of the cell into consideration, and the latter method is laborious. This communication describes a new method, intermediate in accuracy but sufficiently reliable for many purposes. It depends on the fact that the number of red cells seen on edge, in a preparation in which the cells are randomly oriented, depends on the mean dimensions of the cells, including the diameter. Virtually no cell will be seen exactly on edge; but a number will present themselves in the direction of observation in such a way that their observed thickness will be less than a selected value w—where w is a little larger than t, the true mean thickness. The probability f of such cells being seen in the preparation is an expression for which we are indebted to Dr. R. T. Cox (the proof of this expression is a little too long to be included here; but we shall be glad to communicate it to anyone who is interested), and which treats the cross-section of the red cell as a rectangle with a semicircle at each end."

https://openalex.org/W2005222988,"ANIMALS exposed to ionizing radiations almost invariably have a lowered resistance to bacterial infection. The serum complement system which aids lysis of invading bacteria is known to be readily inactivated by radiomimetic substances such as nitrogen mustard1, and it was considered of interest to examine the effects of X-rays and electrons on this system in vitro. It was hoped that an investigation of the effect of various types of radiations on the relatively labile complement system might yield useful information about the biological effects of these radiations. The 15-MeV. linear accelerator at St. Bartholomew's Hospital has been used as the source of X-rays and electrons in all our experiments, and guinea pig serum has been used as a source of complement."
