https://openalex.org/W2147238112,"The behavioral, cognitive, and electrophysiological effects of a single dose of dextroamphetamine (0.5 milligram per kilogram of body weight) or placebo was examined in 14 normal prepubertal boys (mean age, 10 years 11 months) in a double-blind study. When amphetamine was given, the group showed a marked decrease in motor activity and reaction time and improved performance on cognitive tests. The similarity of the response observed in normal children to that reported in children with ""hyperactivity"" or minimal brain dysfunction casts doubt on pathophysiological models of minimal brain dysfunction which assume that children with this syndrome have a clinically specific or ""paradoxical"" response to stimulants."

https://openalex.org/W1572403368,"Conversion of the viral DNA of phage G4 to the duplex form provided an opportunity to isolate and determine the function of the dnaG protein, the product of a gene known to be essential for replication of the Escherichia coli chromosome. This stage of G4 DNA replication requires action of three proteins: the E. coli DNA-binding protein, the dnaG protein, and the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. The dnaG protein has been purified approximately 25,000-fold to near-homogeneity. The native protein contains a single polypeptide of 60,000 daltons. It has been assayed for its activity on G4 DNA in three ways: (a) RNA synthesis, (b) complementation for replication of an extract of a temperature-sensitive dnaG mutant, and (c) priming of DNA replication by DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. The dnaG protein is highly specific for G4 DNA and synthesizes a unique 29-residue RNA primer to be described in the suceeding paper. Other single-stranded and duplex DNA templates are inactive. RNA primer synthesis by the dnaG protein has an apparent Km for ribonucleoside triphosphates near 10 micrometer, and a narrow optimum for Mg2+. The sharp specificity of the dnaG protein in choice of template and the utilization of either deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides to produce a hybrid piece only a few residues long (as described in a succeeding paper) suggests that the dnaG protein previously named RNA polymerase by renamed primase."

https://openalex.org/W252282098,"Recombination in vitro has been used to place one or more copies of a strong promoter, the lac promoter, at varying distances from the cl (repressor) gene of bacteriophage λ on the E. coli plasmid pMB9. In all constructions, λ repressor synthesis is driven wholly or predominantly by the inserted lac promoter. One of our fusions directs the synthesis of very high levels of λ repressor. In this case, the fused DNA encodes a ribosome binding site which is a “hybrid” of λ and lac sequences. In principle, this method of construction should elicit high levels of expression in E. coli of any gene, whatever its source. We also described strains with different sequence arrangements that, for reasons not completely understood, produce less repressor."

https://openalex.org/W2138090880,"Abstract Fibronectin (LETS protein) is a major cell surface glycoprotein component of a variety of nontransformed, substrate-attached cells in culture. Its presence has been related to increased adhesive properties. Using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method to localize antibodies to fibronectin, we have observed that the distribution of fibronectin on L6 myoblasts varies with the density of the culture and the differentiative state of the cells. Low density, undifferentiated cultures of L6 myoblasts have a sparse accumulation of fibronectin; the antibody-antigen reaction indicates its presence on cell membranes, especially where several cells are in proximity. Undifferentiated cells in high density cultures have two forms of fibronectin localization-a diffuse staining on the membrane and a dense staining on an extracellular filamentous matrix. This matrix is composed of filaments ranging from 20–25 nm in diameter which occur singly or coalesce to form bundles. The filaments in this matrix are also observed to have dense globules scattered along their length. These filaments, which are at least in part composed of fibronectin, also react with concanavalin A, as do certain plasma membrane components. In contrast to the observations seen in undifferentiated cells, differentiated cells or myotubes have a diffuse membrane staining with antifibronectin antibodies, and the filamentous form is usually absent."
https://openalex.org/W2002173862,"An antiserum has been found in a nonimmunized rabbit which reacts strongly with a system of filaments in various fibroblasts, epithelial cells, macrophages and neuroblastoma. These filaments are distinct from the actin microfilament bundles visualized by an antibody against actin, and they are not affected by brief treatment with cytochalasin B. The pattern of these filaments somewhat resembles that described for microtubules, but the filaments could be clearly distinguished from microtubules by a comparison of their respective immunofluorescent patterns during cell division. In response to the drugs colcemid and vinblastine, the filaments reacting with this preimmune serum condense to form a compact perinuclear coil of fibers, a distribution and behavior in agreement with that previously described for the 10 nm or intermediate filaments studied by electron microscopy. Further evidence supporting our conclusion that this antiserum reacts with intermediate filaments is provided by a comparison of electron micrographs and the immunofluorescent patterns from parallel cell cultures. To identify the antigens reacting with this antiserum we have used the new technique of immuno-autoradiography on SDS gels of whole cell extracts. Two reactive polypeptide chains have been identified with apparent molecular weights of 56,000 and 30,000 daltons."

https://openalex.org/W1490163585,"A temperature-sensitive mutant strain was isolated from an RNase III-(rnc) strain of Escherichia coli. At the permissive temperature it behaves like the parental strain, but at the nonpermissive temperature it fails to produce normal levels of 23 S and 5 S rRNA, while instead the 25 S rRNA species becomes very prominent. (The 25 S molecule appears in rnc cells and contains 23 S rRNA sequences). When an rnc+ mutation was introduced to such a strain, or when the rnc mutation was replaced by an rnc+ allele, the strain remained temperature-sensitive. At the permissive temperature such strains synthesized rRNA like any other E. coli strain, but at the nonpermissive temperature they remained unable to synthesize normal levels of 5 S rRNA, and instead a larger molecule was accumulated. The simplest interpretation of theses findings is that the mutant strain contains a temperature-sensitive processing endoribonuclease, RNase E, which normally introduces a cut in the growing rRNA chain somewhere between the 23 S and the 5 S rRNA cistrons. These findings help also to explain the nature and origin of the various rRNA species observed in RNase III- cells and add to our understanding of processing of ribosomal RNA in normal cells of Escherichia coli."
https://openalex.org/W1511109772,"With phage G4 DNA as template, primase (the dnaG protein) synthesizes a 26- to 29-residue RNA transcript at the origin of replication. The sequence starts with ATP and contains a hairpin region of one A-U and seven G-C base pairs. Covalent linkage between the RNA and the newly synthesized complementary DNA chain indicates that the RNA transcript serves as a primer."

https://openalex.org/W1509288090,"The 29-residue ribonucleotide primer formed by primase at the origin of phage G4 DNA replication (Bouche, J.-P, Rowen, L., and Kornberg, A. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 765-769) was shorter in the presence of deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs). At 50 micrometer dNTPs and 20 micrometer rNTPs, RNA trancripts no longer than 6 residues were synthesized and these were still effective in priming replication by the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. Primer synthesis was initiated with ATP; adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (Appp(S)), adenosine 5'-tetraphosphate, adenylyl imidodiphosphate (App(NH)p), and ADP were able to substitute for ATP. dATP and GTP were ineffective in initiating replication. DNA replication was stimulated by GTP, suggesting that incorporation of this nucleotide into the second position of the primer trancript by primase produces a more efficient primer. Each of the dNTPs can be incorporated into a hybrid ribonucleotide-deoxyribonucleotide transcript, indicating that primase is able to add either a ribonucleotide or deoxyribonucleotide to the 3'-OH of either of ribo residue or a deoxy residue of the primer terminus. Incorporation of an individual dNTP was less efficient than that of the corresponding rNTP, and the presence of all four dNTPs profoundly depressed RNA synthesis by primase."
https://openalex.org/W2163188402,"In vitro enzymatic alteration of plasmid phenotype and in vitro construction of recombinant plasmids containing genetic information derived from the plasmid pSC101 have been used to investigate the mechanism of function of tetracycline resistance determined by the plasmid pSC101. The resistance has been shown to be inducible and involves the increased synthesis of membrane-associated polypeptides of 34,000, 26,000 and 14,000 daltons that are encoded for by the plasmid. The 34,000 dalton polypeptide along with another plasmid-encoded polypeptide of 18,000 daltons function in an ATP-independent manner to prevent the accumulation of tetracycline by the cell. These polypeptides are sufficient for resistance: A second component of plasmid-determined resistance involves the 14,000 dalton polypeptide and reduces the initial adsorption of tetracycline by sensitive cells, but is not alone sufficient for the generation of resistance. The role of the 26,000 dalton polypeptide in tetracycline resistance has not been identified."

https://openalex.org/W1998719504,"DURING a survey of agglutinating activity of human saliva against streptococci1 we found that saliva from individuals of blood group 0 agglutinated a particular strain of group G streptococci more often than did serum from those with blood group A or B. When we tested 833 sera we found a dimorphism for antibody-like substances against group G streptococci—sera could be divided into two groups according to their agglutination titre against group G streptococci. The first group had low titres, not rising above 1 : 4 and more usually 1 : 1; the second group had much higher titres ranging from 1 : 200 to 1 : 3,200. There was no overlap between the two groups of sera. We thought that this might be related to a genetic system, probably diallelic. We now report a relationship between the haptoglobin genotype of serum and the streptococcal antigens with which it reacts."
https://openalex.org/W1487383944,"Human skin was sliced with a dermatome, and the ratio of type I to type III collagens at various depths was assayed by comparing the quantities of peptides of each derived from cyanogen bromide digestion of the cut skin. Although immunofluorescent studies have suggested type III collagen is located predominantly beneath the epidermis and around appendages, biochemical determination demonstrates the same ratio of type I to type III collagen at all levels of the dermis even in the absence of cutaneous appendages."
https://openalex.org/W2026573298,"We have previously isolated seven rRNA operons on plasmids or lambda transducing phages and identified various tRNAs encoded by these operons. Each of the seven operons has one of two different spacer tRNA gene arrangements between the genes for 16S and 23S rRNA: either tRNAGlu2 or both tRNAIle1 and tRNAAla1B genes. In addition, various tRNA genes are located at or near the distal ends of rRNA operons. In particular, genes for tRNATrp and tRNAAsp1 are located at the distal end of rrnC at 83 min on the E. coli chromosome. Experiments with various hybrid plasmids, some of which lack the rRNA promoter, have now demonstrated that this promoter is necessary for expression of the distal tRNA genes. Rifampicin run-out experiments have also provided evidence that the tRNATrp gene is located farther from its promoter than the spacer tRNA gene or the 5S RNA gene. These results confirm the localization of genes for tRNATrp and tRNAAsp1 at the distal end of rrnC and strongly suggest that they are co-transcribed with the genes for 16S, tRNAGlu2, 23S and 5S RNA. Other such distal tRNAs have been identified, and it is suggested that they too are part of rRNA operons."
https://openalex.org/W1536874460,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae X2180-1A synthesizes two forms of asparaginase: L-asparaginase I, an internal constitutive enzyme, and asparaginase II, an external enzyme which is secreted in response to nitrogen starvation. The two enzymes are biochemically and genetically distinct. The structural gene for asparaginase I (asp 1) is closely linked to the trp 4 gene on chromosome IV. The gene controlling the synthesis of asparaginase II is not linked to either the trp 4 or asp 1 genes. The rate of biosynthesis of asparaginase II is unaltered in yeast strains carrying the structural gene mutation for asparaginase I. Asparaginase II has been purified approximately 300-fold from crude extracts of Saccharomyces by heat and pH treatment, ethanol fractionation, ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by Sephadex G-25 chromatography, and DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Multiple activity peaks were obtained which, upon gas chromatographic analysis, exhibit varying mannose to protein ratios. Asparaginase I has been purified approximately 100-fold from crude extracts of Saccharomyces by protamine sulfate treatment, ammonium sulfate fractionation, gel permeation chromatography, and DEAE-cellulose chromatography. No carbohydrate component was observed upon gas chromatographic analysis. Comparative kinetic and analytic studies show the two enzymes have little in common except their ability to hydrolyze L-asparagine to L-aspartic acid and ammonia."

https://openalex.org/W2012516893,"Abstract We have isolated and immunochemically characterized a major membrane glycoprotein of mouse 3T3 cells. This GRP (glucose/glycosylation-regulated protein) is labeled by lactoperoxidase-mediated iodination and by 14 C-glucosamine, binds concanavalin A and has an apparent molecular weight in SDS-polyacrylamide gels of 92,000 daltons (or 97,000 daltons in a discontinuous gel system). Glycosylated GRP was isolated from plasma membranes using Triton X-100 extraction, affinity chromatography on concanavalin A-Sepharose and preparative SDS gel electrophoresis. Antibody against this glycosylated GRP stains the external surfaces of mouse cells and induces patches and caps. Immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation studies indicate that this glycoprotein can exist in the membrane in two molecular forms, either as a glycosylated or as a nonglycosylated protein. The nonglycosylated form is induced under conditions of limited glycosylation or glucose deprivation. This nonglycosylated GRP remains accessible to antibodies on the exterior of cells, but becomes inaccessible to lactoperoxidase. The immunoprecipitation of the 92K GRP with its specific antibody is always associated with the precipitation of a small fraction of the other major GRP of molecular weight 75,000 daltons. We suggest that both GRP (92K and 75K) may function in close association in the membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2046919828,"The function of a specific intramembrane particle array, ""the fusion rosette,"" an essential requirement for exocytosis of trichocysts in Paramecium, was probed with a temperature sensitive secretory mutant (nd9). The cells were grown at 27 degrees C, the nonpermissive, nonreleasing temperature at which fusion rosettes do not assemble. Exocytosis could be triggered, nonetheless, by addition of 40 micrometer ionophore A23187 and 15 mM Ca2+ but not Mg+. Rosette function is bypassed by this procedure, suggesting that during normal release, the rosette acts as a Ca2+ channel that allows development of a site-specific increase in Ca2+, which in turn induces fusion and release."
https://openalex.org/W1570241527,"The present paper describes the amino acid sequence analysis of the internal and COOH-terminal cyanogen bromide fragments of yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase (Sterner, R., Noyes, C., and Heinrikson, R.L. (1974) Biochemistry 13, 91-99). This information coupled with that derived from earlier structural studies of the enzyme (Sterner, R., AND Heinrikson, R.L. (1975) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 165, 693-703) provides the complete covalent structure of the pyrophosphatase subunit. The majority of the sequence data was derived from automated Edman degradation of the intact cyanogen bromide fragments and the large tryptic peptides obtained from citraconylated derivates in which cleavages were restricted to arginyl residues. The structural determination was completed by analysis of tryptic and chymotryptic peptides from the decitraconylated fragments. The monomer peptide chain contains 285 amino acid residues and the molecular weight calculated from the sequence analysis is 32,042."

The enzyme system is firmly membrane-bound, but has been solubilized by treatment with nonionic detergent at alkaline pH and partially purified. Both the particulate and partially purified fractions catalyzed formation of a single reaction product containing 2 residues of KDO. Periodate oxidation of the purified product permitted tentative identification of the KDO disaccharide structure as KDO2-4KDO."

https://openalex.org/W1678575870,"Membrane-bound L-lactate dehydrogenase was freed from the detergent used during purification. The detergent-free enzyme had about one-half the specific activity of the enzyme in 1.0% Tween 80, and was only partially sensitive to the specific antibody. This enzyme was activated about 3-fold with phosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin, or a mixture of phospholipids. The phospholipid-activated enzyme had a similar Km value for L-lactate to that of the membrane enzyme and was completely inhibited by the specific antibody. On heat treatment, the phospholipid-activated enzyme was more stable than detergent-free enzyme and was as stable as membrane-bound enzyme. The alpha helical content of the enzyme increased 1.7-fold during preincubation with these lipids and the alpha helix became more stable during heat treatment than that of the detergent-free enzyme. These results suggest that the enzyme showed monomolecular dispersion in the lipid bilayer and that its conformation, including its active site and secondary structure, was different from that of the detergent-free enzyme. Phosphatidylethanolamine, dilauroyl lecithin and lecithin from egg yolk had none of the above effects on the activity or the secondary structure of the enzyme. On the other hand, mixtures of each of these lipids and cholate had essentially similar effects to phosphatidylglycerol."

The enzyme acts poorly on intact tRNA and is inactive with the synthetic polyribonucleotides, poly(A), poly(U), or double-stranded poly(A).poly(U). The enzyme requires Mg2+ for activity and is stimulated by the monovalent cations, K+ and NH4+. The products of the reaction are 5'-mononucleotides. The molecular weight of the protein is about 60,000 as judged by Sephadex G-100 chromatography. The enzyme does not correspond to any known E. coli ribonuclease and may represent an intracellular scavenging mechanism for denatured tRNAs and other inactive RNA molecules."

https://openalex.org/W2978129405,"DNA synthesis after ultraviolet irradiation is low in wild type toluene-treated cells. The level of repair incorporation is greater in strains deficient in DNA polymerase I. The low level of repair synthesis is attributable to the concerted action of DNA polymerase I and polynucleotide ligase. Repair synthesis is stimulated by blocking ligase activity with the addition of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) or the use of a ligase temperature-sensitive mutant. NMN stimulation is specific for DNA polymerase I-mediated repair synthesis, as it is absent in isogenic strains deficient in the polymerase function or the 5' leads to 3' exonuclease function associated with DNA polymerase I. DNA synthesis that is stimulated by NMN is proportional to the ultraviolet exposure at low doses, nonconservative in nature, and is dependent on the uvrA gene product but is independent of the recA gene product. These criteria place this synthesis in the excision repair pathway. The NMN-stimulated repair synthesis requires ATP and is N-ethylmaleimide-resistant. The use of NMN provides a direct means for evaluating the involvement of DNA polymerase I in excision repair."
https://openalex.org/W1538415171,"Infection of Escherichia coli with phage T4 induces a large increase in ribonucleotide reductase activity. We show that hydroxyurea inhibits T4-induced CDP, ADP, UDP, and GDP reductase activities in vitro. Moreover, there are significant differences in the degree of inhibition of each ribonucleotide reductase activity. The reductase activities for CDP and ADP are more sensitive to hydroxyurea than those for UDP and GDP, particularly at high hydroxyurea molarities. As little as 5 x 10(-4)M hydroxyurea lowers CDP and ADP reductase activities to 25 to 30% whereas as much as 0.5 M hydroxyurea is needed to lower UDP and GDP reductase activities to 50%."
https://openalex.org/W1515964127,"Treatment of Escherichia coli K12 C600 with colicin K or E1, but not E3, caused changes in the protein composition of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane and an impairment of the membrane-associated ATP-linked transhydrogenase activity. The major compositional changes were loss and/or reduction in the levels of protein bands 4, 8, 9, 10, 13, and 18 with approximate molecular weights of 122,000, 81,000, 75,000, 73,000, 62,000, and 44,000, respectively. Colicin K or E1 treatment had no significant effect on the protein composition or the ATP-linked transhydrogenase activity of the cytoplasmic membranes of the isogenic tolerant strain E. coli K12 C600 TolII (A592). The cytoplasmic membranes of the untreated tolerant mutant were characteristically devoid of protein bands 4 and 13. It is proposed that protein bands 4 and/or 13 participate in colicin action by acting as receptors for colicins at the cytoplasmic membrane level. Some observations on the structural and functional heterogeneity of the cytoplasmic membrane preparations were made."
