https://openalex.org/W3156416688,"Mask wearing has been advocated by public health officials as a way to reduce the spread of COVID-19. In the United States, policies on mask wearing have varied from state to state over the course of the pandemic. Even as more and more states encourage or even mandate mask wearing, many citizens still resist the notion. Our research examines mask wearing policy and adherence in association with COVID-19 case rates. We used state-level data on mask wearing policy for the general public and on proportion of residents who stated they always wear masks in public. For all 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC), these data were abstracted by month for April ─ September 2020 to measure their impact on COVID-19 rates in the subsequent month (May ─ October 2020). Monthly COVID-19 case rates (number of cases per capita over two weeks) &gt;200 per 100,000 residents were considered high. Fourteen of the 15 states with no mask wearing policy for the general public through September reported a high COVID-19 rate. Of the 8 states with at least 75% mask adherence, none reported a high COVID-19 rate. States with the lowest levels of mask adherence were most likely to have high COVID-19 rates in the subsequent month, independent of mask policy or demographic factors. Mean COVID-19 rates for states with at least 75% mask adherence in the preceding month was 109.26 per 100,000 compared to 249.99 per 100,000 for those with less adherence. Our analysis suggests high adherence to mask wearing could be a key factor in reducing the spread of COVID-19. This association between high mask adherence and reduced COVID-19 rates should influence policy makers and public health officials to focus on ways to improve mask adherence across the population in order to mitigate the spread of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3154193433,"The implementation of large-scale containment measures by governments to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus has resulted in large impacts to the global economy. Here, we derive a new high-frequency indicator of economic activity using empirical vessel tracking data, and use it to estimate the global maritime trade losses during the first eight months of the pandemic. We go on to use this high-frequency dataset to infer the effect of individual non-pharmaceutical interventions on maritime exports, which we use as a proxy of economic activity. Our results show widespread port-level trade losses, with the largest absolute losses found for ports in China, the Middle-East and Western Europe, associated with the collapse of specific supply-chains (e.g. oil, vehicle manufacturing). In total, we estimate that global maritime trade reduced by -7.0% to -9.6% during the first eight months of 2020, which is equal to around 206–286 million tonnes in volume losses and up to 225–412 billion USD in value losses. We find large sectoral and geographical disparities in impacts. Manufacturing sectors are hit hardest, with losses up to 11.8%, whilst some small islands developing states and low-income economies suffered the largest relative trade losses. Moreover, we find a clear negative impact of COVID-19 related school and public transport closures on country-wide exports. Overall, we show how real-time indicators of economic activity can inform policy-makers about the impacts of individual policies on the economy, and can support economic recovery efforts by allocating funds to the hardest hit economies and sectors."
https://openalex.org/W3152501512,"The COVID-19 pandemic led to surprising and unexpected experiences for Saudi university students. Precautionary and preventive measures taken to contain this pandemic impacted the social and educational aspects of these students’ lives. All Umm Al-Qura University (UQU) students were invited to participate in an online survey on 30 impacts, both positive and negative, of the COVID-19 pandemic on their lives. Social impact theory (SIT) was applied to illustrate these impacts. The survey yielded 1,360 responses. The results showed high to moderate levels of agreement regarding students’ perceptions of the positive and negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their lives, with social aspects impacted more than educational ones; and no statistically significant gender differences. Weak correlations were found between the social aspects and the educational aspects of students’ lives in relation to the impact of the pandemic, although all aspects were correlated positively. The SIT framework provided insights into how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted students’ lives."
https://openalex.org/W3152749802,"While the world awaits a widely available COVID-19 vaccine, availability of testing is limited in many regions and can be further compounded by shortages of reagents, prolonged processing time and delayed results. One approach to rapid testing is to leverage the volatile organic compound (VOC) signature of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Detection dogs, a biological sensor of VOCs, were utilized to investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 positive urine and saliva patient samples had a unique odor signature. The virus was inactivated in all training samples with either detergent or heat treatment. Using detergent-inactivated urine samples, dogs were initially trained to find samples collected from hospitalized patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, while ignoring samples collected from controls. Dogs were then tested on their ability to spontaneously recognize heat-treated urine samples as well as heat-treated saliva from hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Dogs successfully discriminated between infected and uninfected urine samples, regardless of the inactivation protocol, as well as heat-treated saliva samples. Generalization to novel samples was limited, particularly after intensive training with a restricted sample set. A unique odor associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection present in human urine as well as saliva, provides impetus for the development of odor-based screening, either by electronic, chemical, or biological sensing methods. The use of dogs for screening in an operational setting will require training with a large number of novel SARS-CoV-2 positive and confirmed negative samples."
https://openalex.org/W3001219871,"A number of spatial statistic measurements such as Moran's I and Geary's C can be used for spatial autocorrelation analysis. Spatial autocorrelation modeling proceeded from the 1-dimension autocorrelation of time series analysis, with time lag replaced by spatial weights so that the autocorrelation functions degenerated to autocorrelation coefficients. This paper develops 2-dimensional spatial autocorrelation functions based on the Moran index using the relative staircase function as a weight function to yield a spatial weight matrix with a displacement parameter. The displacement bears analogy with time lag of time series analysis. Based on the spatial displacement parameter, two types of spatial autocorrelation functions are constructed for 2-dimensional spatial analysis. Then the partial spatial autocorrelation functions are derived by Yule-Walker recursive equation. The spatial autocorrelation functions are generalized to the autocorrelation functions based on Geary's coefficient and Getis' index. As an example, the new analytical framework was applied to the spatial autocorrelation modeling of Chinese cities. A conclusion can be reached that it is an effective method to build an autocorrelation function based on the relative step function. The spatial autocorrelation functions can be employed to reveal deep geographical information and perform spatial dynamic analysis, and lay the foundation for the scaling analysis of spatial correlation."
https://openalex.org/W3153086844,"Background Prediction of the dynamics of new SARS-CoV-2 infections during the current COVID-19 pandemic is critical for public health planning of efficient health care allocation and monitoring the effects of policy interventions. We describe a new approach that forecasts the number of incident cases in the near future given past occurrences using only a small number of assumptions. Methods Our approach to forecasting future COVID-19 cases involves 1) modeling the observed incidence cases using a Poisson distribution for the daily incidence number, and a gamma distribution for the series interval; 2) estimating the effective reproduction number assuming its value stays constant during a short time interval; and 3) drawing future incidence cases from their posterior distributions, assuming that the current transmission rate will stay the same, or change by a certain degree. Results We apply our method to predicting the number of new COVID-19 cases in a single state in the U.S. and for a subset of counties within the state to demonstrate the utility of this method at varying scales of prediction. Our method produces reasonably accurate results when the effective reproduction number is distributed similarly in the future as in the past. Large deviations from the predicted results can imply that a change in policy or some other factors have occurred that have dramatically altered the disease transmission over time. Conclusion We presented a modelling approach that we believe can be easily adopted by others, and immediately useful for local or state planning."
https://openalex.org/W3156958386,"The ability to adjust one’s behavioral strategy in complex environments is at the core of cognition. Doing so efficiently requires monitoring the reliability of the ongoing strategy and, when appropriate, switching away from it to evaluate alternatives. Studies in humans and non-human primates have uncovered signals in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) that reflect the pressure to switch away from the ongoing strategy, whereas other ACC signals relate to the pursuit of alternatives. However, whether these signals underlie computations that actually underpin strategy switching or merely reflect tracking of related variables remains unclear. Here we provide causal evidence that the rodent ACC actively arbitrates between persisting with the ongoing behavioral strategy and temporarily switching away to re-evaluate alternatives. Furthermore, by individually perturbing distinct output pathways, we establish that the two associated computations—determining whether to switch strategy and committing to the pursuit of a specific alternative—are segregated in the ACC microcircuitry."
https://openalex.org/W3152889474,"Objective To examine the outcomes of adult patients with spontaneous intracranial and subarachnoid hemorrhage diagnosed with comorbid COVID-19 infection in a large, geographically diverse cohort. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis using the Vizient Clinical Data Base. We separately compared two cohorts of patients with COVID-19 admitted April 1–October 31, 2020—patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and those with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)—with control patients with ICH or SAH who did not have COVID-19 admitted at the same hospitals in 2019. The primary outcome was in-hospital death. Favorable discharge and length of hospital and intensive-care stay were the secondary outcomes. We fit multivariate mixed-effects logistic regression models to our outcomes. Results There were 559 ICH-COVID patients and 23,378 ICH controls from 194 hospitals. In the ICH-COVID cohort versus controls, there was a significantly higher proportion of Hispanic patients (24.5% vs. 8.9%), Black patients (23.3% vs. 20.9%), nonsmokers (11.5% vs. 3.2%), obesity (31.3% vs. 13.5%), and diabetes (43.4% vs. 28.5%), and patients had a longer hospital stay (21.6 vs. 10.5 days), a longer intensive-care stay (16.5 vs. 6.0 days), and a higher in-hospital death rate (46.5% vs. 18.0%). Patients with ICH-COVID had an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 2.43 [1.96–3.00] for the outcome of death and an aOR of 0.55 [0.44–0.68] for favorable discharge. There were 212 SAH-COVID patients and 5,029 controls from 119 hospitals. The hospital (26.9 vs. 13.4 days) and intensive-care (21.9 vs. 9.6 days) length of stays and in-hospital death rate (42.9% vs. 14.8%) were higher in the SAH-COVID cohort compared with controls. Patients with SAH-COVID had an aOR of 1.81 [1.26–2.59] for an outcome of death and an aOR of 0.54 [0.37–0.78] for favorable discharge. Conclusions Patients with spontaneous ICH or SAH and comorbid COVID infection were more likely to be a racial or ethnic minority, diabetic, and obese and to have higher rates of death and longer hospital length of stay when compared with controls."
https://openalex.org/W3156912123,"Introduction New HIV infection during pre-conception and pregnancy is a significant contributor of mother–to–child transmission of HIV in South Africa. This study estimated HIV incidence (defined as new infection within the last one year from the time of the survey which included both new infections occurred during pregnancy or just before pregnancy) among pregnant women and described the characteristics of recently infected pregnant women at national level. Methods Between 1 October and 15 November 2017, we conducted a national cross–sectional survey among pregnant women aged 15–49 years old attending antenatal care at 1,595 public facilities. Blood specimens were collected from pregnant women and tested for HIV in a centralised laboratory. Plasma viral load and Limiting Antigen Avidity Enzyme Immunosorbent Assay (LAg) tests were further performed on HIV positive specimens to differentiate between recent and long–term infections. Recent infection was defined as infection that occurred within one year from the date of collection of blood specimen for the survey. Data on age, age of partner, and marital status were collected through interviews. Women whose specimens were classified as recent by LAg assay and with viral loads &gt;1,000 copies/mL were considered as recently infected. The calculated proportion of HIV positive women with recent infection was adjusted for assay–specific parameters to estimate annual incidence. Survey multinomial logistic regression was used to examine factors associated with being recently infected using HIV negative women as a reference group. Age–disparate relationship was defined as having a partner 5 or more years older. Results Of 10,049 HIV positive participants with LAg and viral load data, 1.4% (136) were identified as recently infected. The annual HIV incidence was 1.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2–1.7). In multivariable analyses, being single (adjusted odds ratio, aOR: 3.4, 95% CI: 1.8–6.2) or cohabiting (aOR: 3.8, 95% CI: 1.8–7.7), compared to being married as well as being in an age–disparate relationship among young women (aOR: 3.1, 95% CI: 2.0–4.7; reference group: young women (15–24years) whose partners were not 5 years or more older) were associated with higher odds of recent infection. Conclusions Compared to previous studies among pregnant women, the incidence estimated in this study was substantially lower. However, the UNAIDS target to reduce incidence by 75% by 2020 (which is equivalent to reducing incidence to &lt;1%) has not been met. The implementation of HIV prevention and treatment interventions should be intensified, targeting young women engaged in age–disparate relationship and unmarried women to fast track progress towards the UNAIDS target."
https://openalex.org/W3155464837,"Allergic rhino-conjunctivitis with pollen allergy has been prevalent worldwide and Pollen-food allergy syndrome (PFAS) refers to individuals with pollen allergy who develop oral allergy syndrome (OAS) on consuming fruits and vegetables. The prevalence of PFAS varies by region and that in Japanese adolescents remains to be elucidated. In this cross-sectional study, we examined the epidemiological characteristics of PFAS in a general population of Japanese adolescents according to pollen allergy, OAS, and IgE component sensitization. Participants comprised adolescents, at age 13 years, from a prospective birth cohort study in Japan. We administered questionnaires to collect information from parents regarding pollen allergy, PFAS and OAS at each child’s age 13 years. ImmunoCAP ISAC was used to assess IgE component sensitization. Among 506 participants with a complete questionnaire and ISAC measurement results, 56.5% had a history of hay fever, 16.0% had a history of OAS, 51.0% had pollen allergy, and 11.7% had a history of PFAS; additionally, 72.7% were sensitized to one or more tree, grass, and/or weed allergens. The most common sensitization (95.7%) among adolescents with pollen allergy was to Japanese cedar (Cry j 1). The most common causal foods were kiwi and pineapple (both 39.0%). Knowledge levels about PFAS were poor among affected adolescents. We found a high prevalence of PFAS among adolescents in Japan. Although it affects approximately 1/10 adolescents in the general population, public awareness regarding PFAS is poor. Interventional strategies are needed to increase knowledge and to prevent PFAS in the general population."
https://openalex.org/W3155657598,"Analysis of regulatory networks is a powerful framework for identification and quantification of intracellular interactions. We introduce miRGTF-net, a novel tool for construction of miRNA-gene-TF networks. We consider multiple transcriptional and post-transcriptional interaction types, including regulation of gene and miRNA expression by transcription factors, gene silencing by miRNAs, and co-expression of host genes with their intronic miRNAs. The underlying algorithm uses information on experimentally validated interactions as well as integrative miRNA/mRNA expression profiles in a given set of samples. The latter ensures simultaneous tissue-specificity and biological validity of interactions. We applied miRGTF-net to paired miRNA/mRNA-sequencing data of breast cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Together with topological analysis of the constructed network we showed that considered players can form reliable prognostic gene signatures for ER-positive breast cancer. A number of signatures demonstrated remarkably high accuracy on transcriptomic data obtained by both microarrays and RNA sequencing from several independent patient cohorts. Furthermore, an essential part of prognostic genes were identified as direct targets of transcription factor E2F1. The putative interplay between estrogen receptor alpha and E2F1 was suggested as a potential recurrence factor in patients treated with tamoxifen. Source codes of miRGTF-net are available at GitHub ( https://github.com/s-a-nersisyan/miRGTF-net )."
https://openalex.org/W3156130801,"Introduction The living arrangements among the older population form a basic pointer to the care and support of older adults in India, and living with extended kin is clearly differentiated from living separately. This paper attempts to understand the associations between socio-economic and health-related variables with preference for the separate living among older adults in India. Materials and methods Using data from Building Knowledge Base on Population Ageing in India (BKPAI), we employed bivariate and probit regressions on a sample of 9540 older adults to fulfil the study objective. Results Nearly 21% of older adults were living alone/with a spouse. Additionally, those older adults who lived alone/with spouse had specific reasons, i.e. about 14.6% reported that they had no children, 47.3% of older adults had their children away and 15.9% of older adults reported a family conflict. Availability of children is consistently found to be negatively associated with the preference of separate living. Besides, better self-rated health, independence in daily activities, and facing any type of violence were the strongest predictors of preference for separate living. In addition, the background characteristics, including age, sex, education, religion, and ethnicity, were found as significant predictors of living arrangement preference. Preference for co-residential arrangements emerges among older persons who have a feeling of importance within their family. Conclusion Physical proximity to kin and health conditions, in addition to economic conditions, substantially determine the swing towards separate living among older adults in India. This suggests that attention has to be paid to the demand for specialized care and health services among older adults living separately."
https://openalex.org/W3128154373,"The reproducibility of published research has become an important topic in science policy. A number of large-scale replication projects have been conducted to gauge the overall reproducibility in specific academic fields. Here, we present an analysis of data from four studies which sought to forecast the outcomes of replication projects in the social and behavioural sciences, using human experts who participated in prediction markets and answered surveys. Because the number of findings replicated and predicted in each individual study was small, pooling the data offers an opportunity to evaluate hypotheses regarding the performance of prediction markets and surveys at a higher power. In total, peer beliefs were elicited for the replication outcomes of 103 published findings. We find there is information within the scientific community about the replicability of scientific findings, and that both surveys and prediction markets can be used to elicit and aggregate this information. Our results show prediction markets can determine the outcomes of direct replications with 73% accuracy (n=103). Both the prediction market prices and the average survey responses are correlated with outcomes (0.581 and 0.564 respectively, both p < .001). We also found a significant relationship between p-values of the original findings and replication outcomes. The dataset is made available through the R package pooledmaRket and can be used to further study community beliefs towards replications outcomes as elicited in the surveys and prediction markets."
https://openalex.org/W3154768443,"Courses that teach evidence-based interventions to enhance well-being are a public health tool that could be used to improve mental health in the population. We compared the well-being of six cohorts of adult students before and after they completed one of two massive open online courses: The Science of Well-Being ( N = 581; 441; 1,228) and a control course, Introduction to Psychology ( N = 677; 480; 1,480). Baseline well-being levels were equivalent across all six samples. Students in both courses increased in their well-being from baseline to follow-up in all three samples ( p &lt; .001); however, at follow-up, students in The Science of Well-Being course had higher subjective well-being than the control course (sample 1: r = .18, d = .37, p &lt; .001; sample 2: r = .21, d = .43, p &lt; .001; sample 3: r = .19, d = .38, p &lt; .001). Overall, across three samples, we found that students who completed either of these online psychology courses increased in their well-being––but that students in The Science of Well-Being course showed greater improvement. These findings suggest that large free online courses that teach evidence-based approaches to well-being could positively impact mental health at large scales."
https://openalex.org/W3154986779,"The study purpose was to assess, in a U.S. probability sample of women, the specific ways women have discovered to make vaginal penetration more pleasurable. Through qualitative pilot research with women that informed the development of the survey instrument used in this study, we identified four previously unnamed, but distinct, techniques women use to make vaginal penetration more pleasurable: Angling, Rocking, Shallowing and Pairing. This study defines each technique and describes its prevalence among U.S. adult women. Weighted frequencies were drawn from the Second OMGYES Pleasure Report—a cross-sectional, online, national probability survey of 3017 American women’s (age 18–93) sexual experiences and discoveries. Participants were recruited via the Ipsos KnowledgePanel®. Data suggest that 87.5% of women make vaginal penetration more pleasurable using ‘Angling’: rotating, raising, or lowering the pelvis/hips during penetration to adjust where inside the vagina the toy or penis rubs and what it feels like. Approximately 76% of women make vaginal penetration more pleasurable using ‘Rocking’: the base of a penis or sex toy rubbing against the clitoris constantly during penetration, by staying all the way inside the vagina rather than thrusting in and out. About 84% of women make vaginal penetration more pleasurable using ‘Shallowing’: penetrative touch just inside of the entrance of the vagina—not on the outside, but also not deep inside—with a fingertip, sex toy, penis tip, tongue, or lips. Finally, 69.7% of women orgasm more often or make vaginal penetration more pleasurable using ‘Pairing’: when a woman herself (Solo Pairing) or her partner (Partner Pairing) reaches down to stimulate her clitoris with a finger or sex toy at the same time as her vagina is being penetrated. These data provide techniques that are at women’s disposal to make penetration more pleasurable—which can enable women to better identify their own preferences, communicate about them and advocate for their sexual pleasure."
https://openalex.org/W3155292454,"Background Standard apical four-chamber and two-chamber views often maximize the long-axis of the left ventricle, resulting in artifactitious foreshortening of the left atrium (LA), which may overestimate LA longitudinal reservoir strain (LALS). We compared LALS values between 2D echocardiography (2DE) and 3D echocardiography (3DE) in healthy subjects to determine whether 2DE speckle tracking analysis overestimates the reference value of LALS. Methods and results In this study, 4 types of cohorts were included: 1. 105 normal subjects (retrospectively), 2. 53 patients with cardiovascular diseases (retrospectively), 3. 15 patients who received cardiac magnetic resonance (prospectively), and 4. 20 normal subjects (prospectively). LALS and LA length were measured using both 2DE and 3DE in 105 healthy subjects (median age: 42 years). Biplane LALS was measured in apical four- and two-chamber views using 2DE speckle tracking software, and 3DE LALS was measured using new 3DE LA strain software. To determine sensitivity, we also performed the same analysis in 53 patients with cardiovascular disease. The mean value of biplane LALS was 39.6%. LA length at both end-diastole (r = -0.43) and end-systole (r = -0.54) was negatively correlated with biplane LALS. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that both end-diastolic and end-systolic LA length had significant negative relationships with biplane LALS after adjusting for anthropometric and echocardiographic image quality parameters. 3DE LALS (23.7±7.6%) gave significantly lower values than 2DE LALS (39.5±12.0%, p&lt;0.001) with a weak correlation (r = 0.33). LA length measured by 2DE was significantly shorter than that measured by 3DE. The same trend was observed in diseased patients. Conclusions Our results revealed that in 2DE, the LA cavity consistently appears longitudinally foreshortened in apical views, potentially overestimating LALS. 3DE may overcome this limitation."
https://openalex.org/W3152591707,"The environment experienced by individuals during their juvenile stages has an impact on their adult stages. In holometabolous insects like Drosophila melanogaster , most of the resource acquisition for adult stages happens during the larval stages. Larval-crowding is a stressful environment, which exposes the larvae to scarcity of food and accumulation of toxic waste. Since adult traits are contingent upon larval stages, in larval-crowding like conditions, adult traits are prone to get affected. While the effect of resource limited, poor-developmental environment on adult immune response has been widely studied, the effect of adaptation to resource-limited developmental environment has not been studied, therefore in this study we assayed the evolution of ability to survive infection in adult stages as a correlated response to adaptation to larval crowding environments. Using four populations of Drosophila melanogaster adapted to larval crowding for 240 generations and their respective control populations, we show that populations adapted to larval crowding show an improved and evolved post-infection survivorship against a gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas entomophila . Whereas, against a gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis , no difference in post-infection survivorship was observed across control and selected populations. In this study, we report the co-related evolution of pathogen-specific increased survivorship post-infection in populations of Drosophila melanogaster as a result of adaptation to larval crowding environment."
https://openalex.org/W3155007121,"The newly created Kawésqar National Park (KNP) and National Reserve (KNR) in southern Chile consists of diverse terrestrial and marine habitats, which includes the southern terminus of the Andes, the Southern Patagonia Ice Fields, sub-Antarctic rainforests, glaciers, fjords, lakes, wetlands, valleys, channels, and islands. The marine environment is influenced by wide ranging hydrological factors such as glacier melt, large terrigenous inputs, high precipitation, strong currents, and open ocean water masses. Owing to the remoteness, rugged terrain, and harsh environmental conditions, little is known about this vast region, particularly the marine realm. To this end, we conducted an integrated ecological assessment using SCUBA and remote cameras down to 600 m to examine this unique and largely unexplored ecosystem. Kelp forests (primarily Macrocystis pyrifera ) dominate the nearshore ecosystem and provide habitat for myriad benthic organisms. In the fjords, salinity was low and both turbidity and nutrients from terrigenous sources were high, with benthic communities dominated by active suspension feeders (e.g., Bivalvia, Ascidiacea, and Bryozoa). Areas closer to the Pacific Ocean showed more oceanic conditions with higher salinity and lower turbidity, with benthic communities experiencing more open benthic physical space in which predators (e.g., Malacostraca and Asteroidea) and herbivorous browsers (e.g., Echinoidea and Gastropoda) were more conspicuous components of the community compared to the inner fjords. Hagfish ( Myxine sp.) was the most abundant and frequently occurring fish taxa observed on deep-sea cameras (80% of deployments), along with several taxa of sharks (e.g., Squaliformes, Etmopteridae, Somniosidae, Scyliorhinidae), which collectively were also observed on 80% of deep-sea camera deployments. The kelp forests, deep fjords, and other nearshore habitats of the KNR represent a unique ecosystem with minimal human impacts at present. The KNR is part of the ancestral territory of the indigenous Kawésqar people and their traditional knowledge, including the importance of the land-sea connection in structuring the marine communities of this region, is strongly supported by our scientific findings."
https://openalex.org/W3155707828,"The blood–brain barrier (BBB) keeps pathogens and toxins out of the brain but also impedes the entry of pharmaceuticals. Human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMECs) and astrocytes are the main functional cell components of the BBB. Although available commercially as cryopreserved cells in suspension, improvements in their cryopreservation and distribution as cryopreserved monolayers could enhance BBB in vitro studies. Here, we examined the response to slow cooling and storage in liquid nitrogen of immortalized hCMEC/D3 cells and human primary astrocytes in suspension and in monolayers. HCMEC/D3 cells in suspension cryopreserved in 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 95% fetal bovine serum or in 5% DMSO and 6% hydroxyethyl starch (HES) showed post-thaw membrane integrities above 90%, similar to unfrozen control. Cryopreservation did not affect the time-dependent ability of hCMEC/D3 cells to form tubes on Matrigel. Primary astrocytes in suspension cryopreserved in the presence of 5% DMSO and 6% HES had improved viability over those cryopreserved in 10% DMSO. Monolayers of single cultures or co-cultures of hCMEC/D3 cells and astrocytes on fibronectin-coated Rinzl coverslips retained membrane integrities and metabolic function, after freezing in 5% DMSO, 6% HES, and 2% chondroitin sulfate, that were comparable to those of unfrozen controls even after overnight incubation. Rinzl is better than glass or Thermanox as an underlying solid substrate for cryopreserving hCMEC/D3 monolayers. Cryopreserved hCMEC/D3 monolayers expressed the junction proteins ZO-1 and claudin-5 similar to their unfrozen counterparts. Hence, we describe improved cryopreservation protocols for hCMEC/D3 cells and astrocytes in suspension, and a novel protocol for the cryopreservation of monolayers of hCMEC/D3 cells and astrocytes as single cultures or co-cultures that could expand their distribution for research on disease modeling, drug screening, and targeted therapy pertaining to the BBB."
https://openalex.org/W3156286235,"Objective We used nationwide population-based data to identify optimal hospital and surgeon volume thresholds and to discover the effects of these volume thresholds on operative mortality and length of stay (LOS) for coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting General acute care hospitals throughout Taiwan. Participants A total of 12,892 CABG patients admitted between 2011 and 2015 were extracted from Taiwan National Health Insurance claims data. Main Outcome Measures Operative mortality and LOS. Restricted cubic splines were applied to discover the optimal hospital and surgeon volume thresholds needed to reduce operative mortality. Generalized estimating equation regression modeling, Cox proportional-hazards modeling and instrumental variables analysis were employed to examine the effects of hospital and surgeon volume thresholds on the operative mortality and LOS. Results The volume thresholds for hospitals and surgeons were 55 cases and 5 cases per year, respectively. Patients who underwent CABG from hospitals that did not reach the volume threshold had higher operative mortality than those who received CABG from hospitals that did reach the volume threshold. Patients who underwent CABG with surgeons who did not reach the volume threshold had higher operative mortality and LOS than those who underwent CABG with surgeons who did reach the volume threshold. Conclusions This is the first study to identify the optimal hospital and surgeon volume thresholds for reducing operative mortality and LOS. This supports policies regionalizing CABG at high-volume hospitals. Identifying volume thresholds could help patients, providers, and policymakers provide optimal care."
https://openalex.org/W3032895761,"The past decade has witnessed a marked increase in the use of social media by politicians, most notably exemplified by the 45th President of the United States (POTUS), Donald Trump. On Twitter, POTUS messages consistently attract high levels of engagement as measured by likes, retweets, and replies. Here, we quantify the balance of these activities, also known as “ratios”, and study their dynamics as a proxy for collective political engagement in response to presidential communications. We find that raw activity counts increase during the period leading up to the 2016 election, accompanied by a regime change in the ratio of retweets-to-replies connected to the transition between campaigning and governing. For the Trump account, we find words related to fake news and the Mueller inquiry are more common in tweets with a high number of replies relative to retweets. Finally, we find that Barack Obama consistently received a higher retweet-to-reply ratio than Donald Trump.

We present the novel use of stable isotope analysis (SIA) of blow flies to determine human influences on vertebrate communities in a range of human-inhabited environments, from a pristine national park to a dense metropolitan area. The refrain “you are what you eat” applies to the dietary isotope record of all living organisms, and for carrion-breeding blow flies, this translates to the type of carcasses present in an environment. Specifically, we show that carnivore carcasses make up a large proportion of the adult fly’s prior larval diet, which contrasts to what has been reportedly previously for the wild adult fly diet (which consists of mostly herbivore resources). Additionally, we reveal the potential impact of human food on carcasses that were fed on by blow flies, underscoring the human influences on wild animal populations. Our results demonstrate that using SIA in conjunction with other methods (e.g., DNA analysis of flies) can reveal a comprehensive snapshot of the vertebrate community in a terrestrial ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W3156028258,"Background Multidrug- and rifampicin (RMP)-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/RR-TB) requires prolonged and expensive treatment, which is difficult to sustain in the Colombian health system. This requires the joint action of different providers to provide timely health services to people with TB. Identifying factors associated with unfavorable treatment outcomes in patients with MDR/RR-TB who received drug therapy between 2013 and 2015 in Colombia can help guide the strengthening of the national TB control program. Method A retrospective cohort study was conducted with all patients who received treatment for MDR/RR-TB between January 2013 and December 2015 in Colombia who were registered and followed up by the national TB control program. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to estimate the associations between the exposure variables with the response variable (treatment outcome). Results A total of 511 patients with MDR/RR-TB were registered and followed up by the national TB control program in Colombia, of whom 16 (3.1%) had extensive drug resistance, 364 (71.2%) had multidrug resistance, and 131 (25.6%) had RMP monoresistance. The mean age was 39.9 years (95% confidence interval (CI): 38.5–41.3), most patients were male 285 (64.6%), and 299 (67.8%) were eligible for subsidized health services. The rate of unfavorable treatment outcomes in the RR-TB cohort was 50.1%, with rates of 85.7% for patients with extensive drug resistance, 47.6% for patients with multidrug resistance, and 52.6% for patients with RMP monoresistance. The 511 MDR/RR-TB patients were included in bivariate and multivariate analyses, patients age ≥ 60 years (crude odds ratio (ORc) = 2.4, 95% CI 1.1–5.8; adjusted odds ratio (ORa) = 2.7, 95% CI 1.1–6.8) and subsidized health regime affiliation (ORc = 3.6, 95% CI 2.3–5.6; ORa = 3.4, 95% CI 2.0–6.0) were associated with unfavorable treatment outcomes. Conclusion More than 50% of the patients with MDR/RR-TB in Colombia experienced unfavorable treatment outcomes. The patients who were eligible for subsidized care were more likely to experience unfavorable treatment outcomes. Those who were older than 60 years were also more likely to experience unfavorable treatment outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3156426962,"Background Coxiella burnetii is the causative agent of Q fever which is a highly infectious zoonotic disease. C . burnetii has become one of the most important causes of abortion in livestock, which can lead to widespread abortions in these animals. There are very limited studies on the prevalence of C . burnetii infection in cases of animal abortion in Iran. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of C . burnetii in ruminant abortion samples in Iran. Methods Abortion samples from cattle, sheep and goats were collected from different parts of Iran and were tested using Real-time PCR targeting the IS1111 element of C . burnetii . Results In this study, 36 samples (24.7%) of the 146 collected samples were positive for C . burnetii . The prevalence of C . burnetii was 21.3% (20 of 94 samples) in sheep samples. Also, 10 of 46 cattle samples (21.7%) were positive. All six goat abortion samples were positive for C . burnetii . Conclusions The findings of the study demonstrate that C . burnetii plays an important role in domestic ruminant abortions in Iran, suggesting that more attention should be paid to the role of C . burnetii in domestic animal abortions by veterinary organizations. The risk of transmitting the infection to humans due to abortion of animals should also be considered."
https://openalex.org/W3152764907,"With an increasing number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the difficulty of UAV management becomes more challenging, especially for low-altitude airspace due to complicated issues of security, privacy and flexibility. Existing management approaches to UAV flights include implementing registration of flight activity for supervision purposes, limiting the maximum flight height, setting different zones for different flight activities and prohibiting flights. In this research, we proposed a new air traffic management method for UAVs based on global subdivision theory. We designed four types of low-altitude air routes from grids, which correspond to grid sizes of 1.85 km, 128 m, 64 m and 32 m. Utilization of the subdivision grids transforms the complex spatial computation problem into a query process in the spatial database, which provides a new approach to UAV management in the fifth-generation (5G) era. We compared the number and data size of stored track records using longitude and latitude and different grid levels, computed time consumption for air route trafficability and simulated UAV flight to verify the feasibility of constructing this type of air traffic highway system. The amount of data storage and time consumption for air route trafficability can be substantially reduced by subdivision. For example, the data size using traditional expressions of latitude and longitude is approximately 1.5 times that of using a 21-level grid, and the time consumption by coordinates is approximately 1.5 times that of subdivision grids at level 21. The results of the simulated experiments indicate that in the 5G environment, gridded airspace can effectively improve the efficiency of UAV trajectory planning and reduce the size of information storage in the airspace environment. Therefore, given the increasing number of UAVs in the future, gridded highways have the potential to provide a foundation for various UAV applications."
https://openalex.org/W3153948545,"Background Patients with AF often have multimorbidity (the presence of ≥2 concomitant chronic conditions). Objective To describe baseline characteristics, patterns of antithrombotic therapy, and factors associated with oral anticoagulant (OAC) prescription in patients with AF and ≥2 concomitant, chronic, comorbid conditions. Methods Phase III of the GLORIA-AF Registry enrolled consecutive patients from January 2014 through December 2016 with recently diagnosed AF and CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score ≥1 to assess the safety and effectiveness of antithrombotic treatment. Results Of 21,241 eligible patients, 15,119 (71.2%) had ≥2 concomitant, chronic, comorbid conditions. The proportions of patients with multimorbidity receiving non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and vitamin K antagonists (VKA) were 60.2% and 23.6%, respectively. The proportion with paroxysmal AF was 57.0% in the NOAC group and 45.4% in the VKA group. Multivariable log-binomial regression analysis found the following factors were associated with no OAC prescription: pattern of AF (paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent), coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, prior bleeding, smoking status, and region (Asia, North America, or Europe). Factors associated with OAC prescriptions were age, body mass index, renal function, hypertension, history of cerebral ischemic symptoms, and AF ablation. Conclusion Multimorbid AF patients prescribed NOACs have fewer comorbidities than those prescribed VKAs. Age, AF pattern, comorbidities, and renal function are associated with OAC prescription."
https://openalex.org/W3155698484,"Objective Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) represents a heterogeneous group of disorders of the cortical formation and is one of the most common causes of epilepsy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the modality of choice for detecting structural lesions, and the surgical prognosis in patients with MR lesions is favorable. However, the surgical prognosis of patients with MR-negative FCD is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the long-term surgical outcomes and prognostic factors in MR-negative FCD patients through comprehensive presurgical data. Methods We retrospectively reviewed data from 719 drug-resistant epilepsy patients who underwent resective surgery and selected cases in which surgical specimens were pathologically confirmed as FCD Type I or II. If the epileptogenic focus and surgical specimens were obtained from brain areas with a normal MRI appearance, they were classified as MR-negative FCD. Surgical outcomes were evaluated at 2 and 5 years, and clinical, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging data of MR-negative FCD were compared to those of MR-positive FCD. Results Finally, 47 MR-negative and 34 MR-positive FCD patients were enrolled in the study. The seizure-free rate after surgery (Engel classification I) at postoperative 2 year was 59.5% and 64.7% in the MR-negative and positive FCD groups, respectively (p = 0.81). This rate decreased to 57.5% and 44.4% in the MR-negative and positive FCD groups (p = 0.43) at postoperative 5 years. MR-negative FCD showed a higher proportion of FCD type I (87.2% vs. 50.0%, p = 0.001) than MR-positive FCD. Unilobar cerebral perfusion distribution (odds ratio, OR 5.41) and concordance of interictal epileptiform discharges (OR 5.10) were significantly associated with good surgical outcomes in MR-negative FCD. Conclusion In this study, MR-negative and positive FCD patients had a comparable surgical prognosis, suggesting that comprehensive presurgical evaluations, including multimodal neuroimaging studies, are crucial for obtaining excellent surgical outcomes even in epilepsy patients with MR-negative FCD."
https://openalex.org/W3156769076,"Enterococcus faecalis are hospital-associated opportunistic pathogens and also causative agents of post-operative endophthalmitis. Patients with enterococcal endophthalmitis often have poor visual outcomes, despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. Here we investigated the genomic and phenotypic characteristics of E. faecalis isolates collected from 13 patients treated at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Eye Center over 19 years. Comparative genomic analysis indicated that patients were infected with E. faecalis belonging to diverse multi-locus sequence types (STs) and resembled E. faecalis sampled from clinical, commensal, and environmental sources. We identified known E. faecalis virulence factors and antibiotic resistance genes in each genome, including genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides, erythromycin, and tetracyclines. We assessed all isolates for their cytolysin production, biofilm formation, and antibiotic susceptibility, and observed phenotypic differences between isolates. Fluoroquinolone and cephalosporin susceptibilities were particularly variable between isolates, as were biofilm formation and cytolysin production. In addition, we found evidence of E. faecalis adaptation during recurrent endophthalmitis by identifying genetic variants that arose in sequential isolates sampled over eight months from the same patient. We identified a mutation in the DNA mismatch repair gene mutS that was associated with an increased rate of spontaneous mutation in the final isolate from the patient. Overall this study documents the genomic and phenotypic variability among E. faecalis causing endophthalmitis, as well as possible adaptive mechanisms underlying bacterial persistence during recurrent ocular infection."
https://openalex.org/W3153035710,"HASPIN is a serine/threonine kinase that regulates mitosis by phosphorylating histone H3 at threonine 3. The expression levels of HASPIN in various cancers are associated with tumor malignancy and poor survival, suggesting that HASPIN inhibition may suppress cancer growth. As HASPIN mRNA levels are elevated in human breast cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, we examined the growth-suppressive effects of CHR-6494, a potent HASPIN inhibitor, in breast cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo . We found that HASPIN was expressed in breast cancer cells of all molecular subtypes, as well as in immortalized mammary epithelial cells. HASPIN expression levels appeared to be correlated with the cell growth rate but not the molecular subtype of breast cancer. CHR-6494 exhibited potent antiproliferative effects against breast cancer cell lines and immortalized mammary epithelial cells in vitro , but failed to inhibit the growth of MDA-MB-231 xenografted tumors under conditions that have significant effects in a colorectal cancer model. These results imply that CHR-6494 does have antiproliferative effects in some situations, and further drug screening efforts are anticipated to identify more potent and selective HASPIN inhibition for use as an anticancer agent in breast cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W3153603904,"Cells have a regulatory mechanism known as heat shock (HS) response, which induces the expression of HS genes and proteins in response to heat and other cellular stresses. Exposure to moderate HS results in beneficial effects, such as thermotolerance and promotes survival, whereas excessive HS causes cell death. The effect of HS on cells depends on both exogenous factors, including the temperature and duration of heat application, and endogenous factors, such as the degree of cell differentiation. Neural stem cells (NSCs) can self-renew and differentiate into neurons and glial cells, but the changes in the HS response of symmetrically proliferating NSCs in culture are unclear. We evaluated the HS response of homogeneous proliferating NSCs derived from mouse embryonic stem cells during the proliferative phase and its effect on survival and cell death in vitro . The number of adherent cells and the expression ratios of HS protein ( Hsp ) 40 and Hsp70 genes after exposure to HS for 20 min at temperatures above 43°C significantly increased with the extension of the culture period before exposure to HS. In contrast, caspase activity was significantly decreased by extension of the culture period before exposure to HS and suppressed the decrease in cell viability. These results suggest that the culture period before HS remarkably affects the HS response, influencing the expression of HS genes and cell survival of proliferating NSCs in culture."
https://openalex.org/W3153692741,"We investigated changes in gene expression of cervical collagens, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) during pre-gestational uterine cervical excision and/or inflammation-induced preterm labor in mice. Forty sexually mature female mice were uniformly divided into four groups: sham, cervical excision, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection, and cervical excision plus LPS injection. Partial cervical tissue excision was performed at five weeks of age before mating. LPS was injected into the lower right uterine horn near the cervix on gestational day 16. Mice were sacrificed immediately postpartum. Uterine cervices were collected and subjected to quantitative real-time PCR. Col4α1 and Col5α1 expression increased significantly in the cervical excision plus LPS injection group compared to the sham group (p &lt; 0.01 and p = 0.024, respectively). MMP-14 expression levels increased in the cervical excision plus LPS injection group compared to the sham group (p &lt; 0.01). TIMP-1 expression was not significantly decreased in this group. Increased expression levels of Col4α1, Col5α1, and MMP-14 were associated with cervical excision plus inflammation-induced preterm labor. Thus, pre-gestational cervical remodeling through specific collagen metabolism and MMP activation may involve the pathogenesis of spontaneous preterm labor."

https://openalex.org/W3154695885,"Devastating fires in Australia over 2019–20 decimated native fauna and flora, including koalas. The resulting population bottleneck, combined with significant loss of habitat, increases the vulnerability of remaining koala populations to threats which include disease. Chlamydia is one disease which causes significant morbidity and mortality in koalas. The predominant pathogenic species, Chlamydia pecorum , causes severe ocular, urogenital and reproductive tract disease. In marsupials, including the koala, gene expansions of an antimicrobial peptide family known as cathelicidins have enabled protection of immunologically naïve pouch young during early development. We propose that koala cathelicidins are active against Chlamydia and other bacteria and fungi. Here we describe ten koala cathelicidins, five of which contained full length coding sequences that were widely expressed in tissues throughout the body. Focusing on these five, we investigate their antimicrobial activity against two koala C . pecorum isolates from distinct serovars; MarsBar and IPTaLE, as well as other bacteria and fungi. One cathelicidin, PhciCath5, inactivated C . pecorum IPTaLE and MarsBar elementary bodies and significantly reduced the number of inclusions compared to the control (p&lt;0.0001). Despite evidence of cathelicidin expression within tissues known to be infected by Chlamydia , natural PhciCath5 concentrations may be inadequate in vivo to prevent or control C . pecorum infections in koalas. PhciCath5 also displayed antimicrobial activity against fungi and Gram negative and positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Electrostatic interactions likely drive PhciCath5 adherence to the pathogen cell membrane, followed by membrane permeabilisation leading to cell death. Activity against E . coli was reduced in the presence of 10% serum and 20% whole blood. Future modification of the PhciCath5 peptide to enhance activity, including in the presence of serum/blood, may provide a novel solution to Chlamydia infection in koalas and other species."
https://openalex.org/W3156622707,"The US is in the midst of a major drug epidemic fueled in large part by the widespread recreational use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl. Persons with opioid use disorder are at significant risk for transmission of injection-associated infections such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Commonly abused substances may antagonize immune responses and promote viral replication. However, the impact of synthetic opioids on virus replication has not been well explored. Thus, we evaluated the impact of fentanyl and carfentanil using in vitro systems that replicate infectious viruses. Fentanyl was used in cell lines replicating HBV or HCV at concentrations of 1 ng, 100 ng, and 10 ug. Viral protein synthesis was quantified by ELISA, while apoptosis and cell death were measured by M30 or MTT assays, respectively. HCV replicative fitness was evaluated in a luciferase-based system. RNAseq was performed to evaluate cellular gene regulation in the presence of fentanyl. Low dose fentanyl had no impact on HCV replication in Huh7.5JFH1 hepatocytes; however, higher doses significantly enhanced HCV replication. Similarly, a dose-dependent increase in HCV replicative fitness was observed in the presence of fentanyl. In the HepG2.2.15 hepatocyte cell line, fentanyl caused a dose-dependent increase in HBV replication, although only a higher doses than for HCV. Addition of fentanyl resulted in significant apoptosis in both hepatocyte cell lines. Cell death was minimal at low drug concentrations. RNAseq identified a number of hepatocyte genes that were differentially regulated by fentanyl, including those related to apoptosis, the antiviral / interferon response, chemokine signaling, and NFκB signaling. Collectively, these data suggest that synthetic opioids promote viral replication but may have distinct effects depending on the drug dose and the viral target. As higher viral loads are associated with pathogenesis and virus transmission, additional research is essential to an enhanced understanding of opioid-virus pathogenesis and for the development of new and optimized treatment strategies."

The present study investigated changes in hepatic nerve fibers in liver biopsy specimens from patients with normal liver, viral hepatitis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, in relation to clinical background. The areal ratio of nerve fibers to the total portal area was automatically calculated for each sample. The nerve fiber areal ratios (NFAR) for total nerve fibers and sympathetic nerve fibers were significantly lower in liver affected by chronic hepatitis, particularly viral hepatitis, and this was also the case for advanced liver fibrosis. However, the degree of inflammatory activity did not affect NFAR for either whole nerves or sympathetic nerves. Comparison of samples obtained before and after antiviral treatment for HCV demonstrated recovery of NFAR along with improvement of liver fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W3153363482,"Conservation actions such as habitat protection, restoration, and translocations are critical actions in preventing further extinctions of threatened species. We used the 152 threatened species on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s Red List with conservation translocations as a recommended conservation action to access the habitat quality of these species’ ranges. We determined where multi-species conservation translocation and forest restoration efforts can be concentrated. To determine the habitat quality of species’ ranges, we assessed forest cover, forest restoration potential, protected area status, and invasive species concerns. Forty-four percent (67 species) of species with translocations recommended have part of their range in a protected area, existing forest cover, and currently no invasive species risk. However, the majority (85 species) currently need habitat management (63 species), invasive species control (71 species), or protection (34 species). We also identified key differences between species recommended for reintroductions (115 species) and benign introductions (37 species), such as the percentage of a species’ range within a protected area, in which reintroductions (median = 7.4%) had more than benign introductions (median = 0.9%). Mauritius, central Africa, eastern Australia and Himalaya regions each have areas with range overlap of three or more species recommended for translocations and forest restoration potential. For those species with CT programs in place, mean forest cover was 32% and restoration potential was 16%, suggesting potential minimum habitat requirements for initial releases. Results provide a global perspective on reintroduction and translocation needs of threatened species with evidenced-based information on habitat quality, i.e. forest restoration potential, forest cover, protected areas, and invasive species control, to aid conservation translocation scientists and ultimately improve the success of such projects."

The 1-nearest neighbor method predicted tissue-of-origin in 33 samples of a test set, with an accuracy of 93.9% at feature selection p values ranging from 10 −4 to 10 −10 . According to binary decision tree analyses, the overexpression of miR-30a and the underexpression of miR-200 family members (miR-200c and miR-141) differentiated intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas from extrahepatic adenocarcinomas. When binary decision tree analyses were performed using the test set, the prediction accuracy was 84.8%.

https://openalex.org/W3156287920,"Saving money is important but challenging. To spur financial saving intentions, we propose a new strategy—gamification. Specifically, we investigate the effectiveness of competitive leaderboards in increasing individuals’ saving intentions. The results of two studies (total N = 618) show consistently that people’s saving intentions are higher when presented with a leaderboard than when not. Further, as leaderboards elicit social comparison, we explore whether the height of the comparison standard and individuals’ social comparison orientation moderate the effect. We find that the effect of leaderboards on saving intentions is more pronounced when people compare with a higher (as compared to a lower) standard (Study 1), but that the effect is not influenced by individuals’ social comparison orientation (Study 2). Taken together, this research provides a new and simple-to-implement strategy to facilitate saving intentions in order to help improve people’s financial well-being."

The overall aims of this study were to record the proportion of MAD owners who have a dog that alerts to multiple health conditions or to people other than the target person and to determine whether any sociodemographic variables were associated with dogs alerting to multiple conditions, multiple people, or both. MAD owners completed an online survey that contained a series of forced choice questions. Sixty-one participants reported a total of 33 different conditions to which dogs alerted. Eighty-four percent of participants reported that their dog alerted to multiple conditions and 54% reported that their dog alerted to multiple people. This is the first study to document that a large percentage of people report that their MAD alerts to multiple conditions and/or to multiple people. We present a discussion of how these alerting abilities could develop, but questions about the underlying mechanisms remain."
https://openalex.org/W3153290518,"The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have originated in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and has since spread quickly around the world. To date, the virus has infected tens of millions of people worldwide, compelling governments to implement strict policies to counteract community spread. Federal, provincial, and municipal governments have employed various public health policies, including social distancing, mandatory mask wearing, and the closure of schools and businesses. However, the implementation of these policies can be difficult and costly, making it imperative that both policy makers and the citizenry understand their potential benefits and the risks of non-compliance. In this work, a mathematical model is developed to study the impact of social behaviour on the course of the pandemic in the province of Ontario. The approach is based upon a standard SEIRD model with a variable transmission rate that depends on the behaviour of the population. The model parameters, which characterize the disease dynamics, are estimated from Ontario COVID-19 epidemiological data using machine learning techniques. A key result of the model, following from the variable transmission rate, is the prediction of the occurrence of a second wave using the most current infection data and disease-specific traits. The qualitative behaviour of different future transmission-reduction strategies is examined, and the time-varying reproduction number is analyzed using existing epidemiological data and future projections. Importantly, the effective reproduction number, and thus the course of the pandemic, is found to be sensitive to the adherence to public health policies, illustrating the need for vigilance as the economy continues to reopen."

This study evaluates the airflow comfort with subjective assessments and physiological measurements, including skin temperature, electroencephalograms, and electrocardiograms. Nineteen participants entered a test room at 20°C after staying in a room at 32°C for acclimation. They were exposed to indirect and direct airflow conditions to their faces and performed four tasks under each condition: resting, counting to 10 s following time alerts, counting to 10 s in mind, and mental calculation. Subjective assessments showed relatively higher thermal sensation and pleasantness under indirect airflow. The psychological time calculated from counting behaviors was longer under indirect airflow, indicating suppression of negative emotions. The face temperatures significantly declined during experiments under direct airflow. The beta and gamma bands of electroencephalograms were inhibited under the indirect condition, and these amplitudes were negatively correlated with pleasant feelings. Electrocardiogram parameters indicated that sympathetic nervous activity was predominant during counting, following alerts and mental calculation in indirect airflow. This study supports the comfort of indirect airflow based on reliable evidence."
https://openalex.org/W3154100530,"Muskoxen ( Ovibos moschatus) , a taxonomically unique Arctic species, are increasingly exposed to climate and other anthropogenic changes. It is critical to develop and validate reliable tools to monitor their physiological stress response in order to assess the impacts of these changes. Here, we measured fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) levels in response to the administration of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in the winter (1 IU/kg) and summer (2 IU/kg) using two enzyme immunoassays, one targeting primarily cortisol and the other targeting primarily corticosterone. Fecal cortisol levels varied substantially within and among individuals, and none of the animals in either challenge showed an increase in fecal cortisol following the injection of ACTH. By contrast, two of six (winter) and two of five (summer) muskoxen showed a clear response in fecal corticosterone levels (i.e., maximal percentage increase as compared to time 0 levels &gt; 100%). Increases in fecal corticosterone post-ACTH injection occurred earlier and were of shorter duration in the summer than in the winter and fecal corticosterone levels were, in general, lower during the summer. These seasonal differences in FGM responses may be related to the use of different individuals (i.e., influence of sex, age, social status, etc.) and to seasonal variations in the metabolism and excretion of glucocorticoids, intestinal transit time, voluntary food intake, and fecal output and moisture content. Results from this study support using FGMs as a biomarker of hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis activity in muskoxen, advance our understanding of the physiological adaptations of mammals living in highly seasonal and extreme environments such as the Arctic, and emphasize the importance of considering seasonality in other species when interpreting FGM levels."
https://openalex.org/W3154790569,"Background A major earthquake in Israel is inevitable. Individual risk perceptions and preparedness can mitigate harm and save lives. The gap between the public’s concerns and those of experts is reflected in their differential perceptions regarding the components that influence the occurrence of an earthquake in Israel. Whereas the public believes that geographic location is the critical variable, the experts note additional variables that need to be considered. Common knowledge regarding the risks of earthquake occurrence in Israel is based on a distinction between high and low-risk areas, such that the closer a residential area is to the Great Rift Valley, the higher the risk that an earthquake will occur. Objectives To examine the variables affecting public preparedness in Israel (effective communication agent (communicator), high and low earthquake risk areas) and the degree to which experts’ knowledge contradicts respondents’ common knowledge. Methods The study used a mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative research. The first stage included in-depth interviews with earthquake experts (n = 19). The second stage consisted of an experiment conducted among a representative sample of the public (n = 834). Results Most people believe that geographical location constitutes the main risk factor for earthquakes in Israel. Yet experts claim that additional variables affect earthquake intensity and damage: building strength, earthquake magnitude, distance from earthquake epicenter, soil type, and interaction between these four. The study found that knowledge of expert information affects public willingness to prepare. The direction of this influence depends on participants’ risk perceptions regarding residential area and on degree of consistency with common knowledge. In low-risk areas, added knowledge increased willingness to prepare whereas in high-risk areas this knowledge decreased willingness. Conclusion To turn expert information into common knowledge and to increase earthquake preparedness, the authorities must educate the public to generate a new public preparedness norm."
https://openalex.org/W3155239495,"Although it is understood that episodic memories of everyday events involve encoding a wide array of perceptual and non-perceptual information, it is unclear how these distinct types of information are recalled. To address this knowledge gap, we examine how perceptual (visual versus auditory) and non-perceptual details described within a narrative, a proxy for everyday event memories, were retrieved. Based on previous work indicating a bias for visual content, we hypothesized that participants would be most accurate at recalling visually described details and would tend to falsely recall non-visual details with visual descriptors. In Study 1, participants watched videos of a protagonist telling narratives of everyday events under three conditions: with visual, auditory, or audiovisual details. All narratives contained the same non-perceptual content. Participants’ free recall of these narratives under each condition were scored for the type of details recalled (perceptual, non-perceptual) and whether the detail was recalled with gist or verbatim memory. We found that participants were more accurate at gist and verbatim recall for visual perceptual details. This visual bias was also evident when we examined the errors made during recall such that participants tended to incorrectly recall details with visual information, but not with auditory information. Study 2 tested for this pattern of results when the narratives were presented in auditory only format. Results conceptually replicated Study 1 in that there was still a persistent visual bias in what was recollected from the complex narratives. Together, these findings indicate a bias for recruiting visualizable content to construct complex multi-detail memories."
https://openalex.org/W3153999944,"The design of myocontrolled devices faces particular challenges in children with dyskinetic cerebral palsy because the electromyographic signal for control contains both voluntary and involuntary components. We hypothesized that voluntary and involuntary components of movements would be uncorrelated and thus detectable as different synergistic patterns of muscle activity, and that removal of the involuntary components would improve online EMG-based control. Therefore, we performed a synergy-based decomposition of EMG-guided movements, and evaluated which components were most controllable using a Fitts’ Law task. Similarly, we also tested which muscles were most controllable. We then tested whether removing the uncontrollable components or muscles improved overall function in terms of movement time, success rate, and throughput. We found that removal of less controllable components or muscles did not improve EMG control performance, and in many cases worsened performance. These results suggest that abnormal movement in dyskinetic CP is consistent with a pervasive distortion of voluntary movement rather than a superposition of separable voluntary and involuntary components of movement."

Methods The study was a prospective analysis of 37 chEVAR procedures performend in 24 patients with perirenal aortic aneurysm. In all patients the measurement of: distal renal artery pressure (Pd), aortic pressure (Pa), Pd/Pa ratio (Pd/Pa) and mean gradient (MG) between the aorta and the distal renal artery were performed. Measurements were taken with 0.014 inch pressure wire catheter before and after the chEVAR procedure. MG greater than 9 mmHg and Pd/Pa ratio below 0.90 were considered as the measures of a significant decrease in distal pressure that limited flow in renal arteries. The 6 month follow-up computed tomographic angiography (CTA) was performed in all patients to diagnose potential endoleak presence and to verify the patency of the chimney stent-grafts. Results All procedures were successful, and no periprocedural complications were observed in any of the patients. The mean gradient values before and after the chimney implantation did not change significantly (6,2±2,0 mmHg and 6,8±2,2 mmHg, respectively). Similarly, no significant change in Pd/Pa values was noted with the value of 0.9 observed both before and after the procedure. All chimney stents were patent on the control CTA. Type Ia endoleak was found in 4 (10.8%) patients. Conclusions The application of the described technique seems to be a safe method which allows a direct measurement of renal artery flow hemodynamics before and after chimney implantation during the chEVAR technique. The use of covered balloon expandable stents, ensures the proper blood flow in the renal arteries during the chEVAR technique."
https://openalex.org/W3155044571,"Electrical stimulation involving visual areas of the brain produces artificial light percepts called phosphenes. These visual percepts have been extensively investigated in previous studies involving intracortical microsimulation (ICMS) and serve as the basis for developing a visual prosthesis for the blind. Although advances have been achieved, many challenges still remain with implementing a functional ICMS for visual rehabilitation purposes. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the primary occipital lobe offers an alternative method to produce phosphenes non-invasively. A main challenge facing blind individuals involves navigation. Within the scientific community, methods to evaluate the ability of a visual prosthesis to facilitate in navigation has been neglected. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of evoking lateralized phosphenes to navigate a computer simulated virtual environment. More importantly, we demonstrate how virtual environments along with the development of a visual prosthesis share a mutual relationship benefiting both patients and researchers. Using two TMS devices, a pair of 40mm figure-of-eight coils were placed over each occipital hemisphere resulting in lateralized phosphene perception. Participants were tasked with making a series of left and right turns using peripheral devices depending on the visual hemifield in which a phosphene is present. If a participant was able to accurately perceive all ten phosphenes, the simulated target is able to advance and fully exit the virtual environment. Our findings demonstrate that participants can interpret lateralized phosphenes while highlighting the integration of computer based virtual environments to evaluate the capability of a visual prosthesis during navigation."
https://openalex.org/W3155544093,"Background Elder abuse is a growing public health question among policy makers and practitioners in many countries. Research findings usually indicate women as victims, whereas male elder abuse still remains under-detected and under-reported. We aimed to investigate the prevalence, severity and chronicity of abuse (psychological, physical, physical injury, sexual, and financial) against older men, and to scrutinize factors (e.g. demographics) associated with high chronicity of any abuse. Methods Randomly selected older men (n = 1908) aged 60–84 years from seven European cities (Ancona, Athens, Granada, Kaunas, Stuttgart, Porto, Stockholm) were interviewed in 2009 via a cross-sectional study concerning abuse exposure during the past 12 months. Results Findings suggested that prevalence of abuse towards older men varied between 0.3% (sexual) and 20.3% (psychological), with severe acts between 0.2% (sexual) and 8.2% (psychological). On the whole, higher chronicity values were for injury, followed by psychological, financial, physical, and sexual abuse. Being from Sweden, experiencing anxiety and having a spouse/cohabitant/woman as perpetrator were associated with a greater “risk” for high chronicity of any abuse. For men, severity and chronicity of abuse were in some cases relatively high. Conclusions Abuse towards older men, in the light of severe and repeated acts occurring, should be a source of concern for family, caring staff, social work practice and policy makers, in order to develop together adequate prevention and treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3152632943,"Many practitioners as well as researchers explore promoting environmentally conscious behavior in the context of public goods systems. Numerous experimental studies revealed various types of incentives to increase cooperation on public goods. There is ample evidence that monetary and non-monetary incentives, such as donations, have a positive effect on cooperation in public goods games that exceeds fully rational and optimal economic decision making. Despite an accumulation of these studies, in the typical setting of these experiments participants decide on an allocation of resources to a public pool, but they never exert actual effort. However, in reality, we often observe that players’ real effort is required in these public goods game situations. Therefore, more analysis is needed to draw conclusions for a wider set of incentive possibilities in situations similar to yet deviating from resource allocation games. Here we construct a real effort public goods game in an online experiment and statistically analyze the effect different types of incentives have on cooperation. In our experiment, we examine combinations of monetary and social incentives in a setting aimed closer to practical realities, such as financial costs and real effort forming part of the decision to cooperate on a public good. In our real effort public goods game participants cooperate and defect on image-scoring tasks. We find that in our setting economic and social incentives produce an asymmetric effect. Interestingly economic incentives decreased the share of highly uncooperative participants, while social incentives raised the share of highly cooperative participants."
https://openalex.org/W3156674053,"Recurrent neural networks are efficient ways of training language models, and various RNN networks have been proposed to improve performance. However, with the increase of network scales, the overfitting problem becomes more urgent. In this paper, we propose a framework—G2Basy—to speed up the training process and ease the overfitting problem. Instead of using predefined hyperparameters, we devise a gradient increasing and decreasing technique that changes the parameters training batch size and input dropout simultaneously by a user-defined step size. Together with a pretrained word embedding initialization procedure and the introduction of different optimizers at different learning rates, our framework speeds up the training process dramatically and improves performance compared with a benchmark model of the same scale. For the word embedding initialization, we propose the concept of “artificial features” to describe the characteristics of the obtained word embeddings. We experiment on two of the most often used corpora—the Penn Treebank and WikiText-2 datasets—and both outperform the benchmark results and show potential towards further improvement. Furthermore, our framework shows better results with the larger and more complicated WikiText-2 corpus than with the Penn Treebank. Compared with other state-of-the-art results, we achieve comparable results with network scales hundreds of times smaller and within fewer training epochs."
