https://openalex.org/W2119111857,"Human coronavirus-EMC (hCoV-EMC) is a new coronavirus that has killed around half of the few humans infected so far; this study now identifies DPP4 as the receptor that this virus uses to infect cells. The emerging pathogenic coronavirus hCoV-EMC, first identified in September 2012, has been fatal in about half of the few humans infected so far. Bart Haagmans and colleagues have now identified the receptor that this virus uses to infect cells. In contrast to the related virus SARS-CoV, which uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2, the functional receptor for hCoV-EMC is dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, also known as CD26), an exopeptidase found on non-ciliated cells in the lower respiratory tract. This enzyme is highly conserved across different species, and hCoV-EMC can also use bat DPP4 as a functional receptor — a possible clue as to the host range and epidemiological history of this new virus. The findings may also be important for the development of intervention strategies. Most human coronaviruses cause mild upper respiratory tract disease but may be associated with more severe pulmonary disease in immunocompromised individuals1. However, SARS coronavirus caused severe lower respiratory disease with nearly 10% mortality and evidence of systemic spread2. Recently, another coronavirus (human coronavirus-Erasmus Medical Center (hCoV-EMC)) was identified in patients with severe and sometimes lethal lower respiratory tract infection3,4. Viral genome analysis revealed close relatedness to coronaviruses found in bats5. Here we identify dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; also known as CD26) as a functional receptor for hCoV-EMC. DPP4 specifically co-purified with the receptor-binding S1 domain of the hCoV-EMC spike protein from lysates of susceptible Huh-7 cells. Antibodies directed against DPP4 inhibited hCoV-EMC infection of primary human bronchial epithelial cells and Huh-7 cells. Expression of human and bat (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) DPP4 in non-susceptible COS-7 cells enabled infection by hCoV-EMC. The use of the evolutionarily conserved DPP4 protein from different species as a functional receptor provides clues about the host range potential of hCoV-EMC. In addition, it will contribute critically to our understanding of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of this emerging human coronavirus, and may facilitate the development of intervention strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2144288697,"Magnetic resonance is an exceptionally powerful and versatile measurement technique. The basic structure of a magnetic resonance experiment has remained largely unchanged for almost 50 years, being mainly restricted to the qualitative probing of only a limited set of the properties that can in principle be accessed by this technique. Here we introduce an approach to data acquisition, post-processing and visualization--which we term 'magnetic resonance fingerprinting' (MRF)--that permits the simultaneous non-invasive quantification of multiple important properties of a material or tissue. MRF thus provides an alternative way to quantitatively detect and analyse complex changes that can represent physical alterations of a substance or early indicators of disease. MRF can also be used to identify the presence of a specific target material or tissue, which will increase the sensitivity, specificity and speed of a magnetic resonance study, and potentially lead to new diagnostic testing methodologies. When paired with an appropriate pattern-recognition algorithm, MRF inherently suppresses measurement errors and can thus improve measurement accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2136550480,"Tapeworms (Cestoda) cause neglected diseases that can be fatal and are difficult to treat, owing to inefficient drugs. Here we present an analysis of tapeworm genome sequences using the human-infective species Echinococcus multilocularis, E. granulosus, Taenia solium and the laboratory model Hymenolepis microstoma as examples. The 115- to 141-megabase genomes offer insights into the evolution of parasitism. Synteny is maintained with distantly related blood flukes but we find extreme losses of genes and pathways that are ubiquitous in other animals, including 34 homeobox families and several determinants of stem cell fate. Tapeworms have specialized detoxification pathways, metabolism that is finely tuned to rely on nutrients scavenged from their hosts, and species-specific expansions of non-canonical heat shock proteins and families of known antigens. We identify new potential drug targets, including some on which existing pharmaceuticals may act. The genomes provide a rich resource to underpin the development of urgently needed treatments and control. Genome sequences of human-infective tapeworm species reveal extreme losses of genes and pathways that are ubiquitous in other animals, species-specific expansions of non-canonical heat shock proteins and families of known antigens, specialized detoxification pathways, and metabolism that relies on host nutrients; this information is used to identify new potential drug targets. Tapeworms cause echinococcosis and cysticercosis, two of the most severe parasitic diseases found in humans, and both on the World Health Organization's list of neglected tropical diseases. The publication of four tapeworm genome sequences — human-infective tapeworm species Echinococcus multilocularis, E. granulosus, Taenia solium and the laboratory model Hymenolepis microstoma — and identification of potential new drug targets for treating tapeworm infections is therefore a welcome development. Analysis of the sequences provides insights into the evolution of parasitism and reveals extreme losses of genes and pathways ubiquitous in other animals on one hand and species-specific expansions of genes on the other. More than a thousand E. multilocularis proteins emerge as potential targets, and of these, close to 200 with the highest scores may be targeted with existing pharmaceuticals."
https://openalex.org/W2067413882,"Photons are ideal carriers for quantum information as they can have a long coherence time and can be transmitted over long distances. These properties are a consequence of their weak interactions within a nearly linear medium. To create and manipulate nonclassical states of light, however, one requires a strong, nonlinear interaction at the single photon level. One approach to generate suitable interactions is to couple photons to atoms, as in the strong coupling regime of cavity QED systems. In these systems, however, one only indirectly controls the quantum state of the light by manipulating the atoms. A direct photon-photon interaction occurs in so-called Kerr media, which typically induce only weak nonlinearity at the cost of significant loss. So far, it has not been possible to reach the single-photon Kerr regime, where the interaction strength between individual photons exceeds the loss rate. Here, using a 3D circuit QED architecture, we engineer an artificial Kerr medium which enters this regime and allows the observation of new quantum effects. We realize a Gedankenexperiment proposed by Yurke and Stoler, in which the collapse and revival of a coherent state can be observed. This time evolution is a consequence of the quantization of the light field in the cavity and the nonlinear interaction between individual photons. During this evolution non-classical superpositions of coherent states, i.e. multi-component Schroedinger cat states, are formed. We visualize this evolution by measuring the Husimi Q-function and confirm the non-classical properties of these transient states by Wigner tomography. The single-photon Kerr effect could be employed in QND measurement of photons, single photon generation, autonomous quantum feedback schemes and quantum logic operations."
https://openalex.org/W1970813336,"Recently, macroscopic mechanical oscillators have been coaxed into a regime of quantum behavior, by direct refrigeration [1] or a combination of refrigeration and laser-like cooling [2, 3]. This exciting result has encouraged notions that mechanical oscillators may perform useful functions in the processing of quantum information with superconducting circuits [1, 4-7], either by serving as a quantum memory for the ephemeral state of a microwave field or by providing a quantum interface between otherwise incompatible systems [8, 9]. As yet, the transfer of an itinerant state or propagating mode of a microwave field to and from a mechanical oscillator has not been demonstrated owing to the inability to agilely turn on and off the interaction between microwave electricity and mechanical motion. Here we demonstrate that the state of an itinerant microwave field can be coherently transferred into, stored in, and retrieved from a mechanical oscillator with amplitudes at the single quanta level. Crucially, the time to capture and to retrieve the microwave state is shorter than the quantum state lifetime of the mechanical oscillator. In this quantum regime, the mechanical oscillator can both store and transduce quantum information."
https://openalex.org/W2167362732,"Maintenance of body temperature is essential for the survival of homeotherms. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a specialized fat tissue that is dedicated to thermoregulation. Owing to its remarkable capacity to dissipate stored energy and its demonstrated presence in adult humans, BAT holds great promise for the treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Rodent data suggest the existence of two types of brown fat cells: constitutive BAT (cBAT), which is of embryonic origin and anatomically located in the interscapular region of mice; and recruitable BAT (rBAT), which resides within white adipose tissue (WAT) and skeletal muscle, and has alternatively been called beige, brite or inducible BAT. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) regulate the formation and thermogenic activity of BAT. Here we use mouse models to provide evidence for a systemically active regulatory mechanism that controls whole-body BAT activity for thermoregulation and energy homeostasis. Genetic ablation of the type 1A BMP receptor (Bmpr1a) in brown adipogenic progenitor cells leads to a severe paucity of cBAT. This in turn increases sympathetic input to WAT, thereby promoting the formation of rBAT within white fat depots. This previously unknown compensatory mechanism, aimed at restoring total brown-fat-mediated thermogenic capacity in the body, is sufficient to maintain normal temperature homeostasis and resistance to diet-induced obesity. These data suggest an important physiological cross-talk between constitutive and recruitable brown fat cells. This sophisticated regulatory mechanism of body temperature may participate in the control of energy balance and metabolic disease."
https://openalex.org/W2136346050,"The wide diversity of skeletal proportions in mammals is evident upon a survey of any natural history museum's collections and allows us to distinguish between species even when reduced to their calcified components. Similarly, each individual is comprised of a variety of bones of differing lengths. The largest contribution to the lengthening of a skeletal element, and to the differential elongation of elements, comes from a dramatic increase in the volume of hypertrophic chondrocytes in the growth plate as they undergo terminal differentiation. However, the mechanisms of chondrocyte volume enlargement have remained a mystery. Here we use quantitative phase microscopy to show that mammalian chondrocytes undergo three distinct phases of volume increase, including a phase of massive cell swelling in which the cellular dry mass is significantly diluted. In light of the tight fluid regulatory mechanisms known to control volume in many cell types, this is a remarkable mechanism for increasing cell size and regulating growth rate. It is, however, the duration of the final phase of volume enlargement by proportional dry mass increase at low density that varies most between rapidly and slowly elongating growth plates. Moreover, we find that this third phase is locally regulated through a mechanism dependent on insulin-like growth factor. This study provides a framework for understanding how skeletal size is regulated and for exploring how cells sense, modify and establish a volume set point."
https://openalex.org/W2057589371,"A spectroscopic redshift survey of extraordinarily bright millimetre-wave-selected sources of carbon monoxide line emission — originating from star-forming molecular gas — shows that at least ten of these sources lie at redshifts greater than four, indicating that the fraction of dusty starburst galaxies at high redshifts is greater than previously thought. Luminous, dusty, starburst galaxies were abundant in the early Universe, but it has been difficult to measure the complete redshift distribution of these objects, especially at the highest redshifts. The ALMA interferometer in Chile, now coming on-stream, provides high-resolution imaging at the millimetre/submillimetre wavelengths at which star-forming gases are best observed. Using ALMA, Joaquin Vieira and co-workers targeted carbon monoxide line emissions from gravitationally lensed galaxies discovered in a wide-field survey using the South Pole Telescope. The ten z > 4 objects revealed in this work more than double the number of spectroscopically confirmed, ultra-luminous galaxies discovered at extreme redshifts. Two sources at z = 5.7 are among the most distant ultra-luminous starburst galaxies known, seen as they were about a billion years after the Big Bang. In the past decade, our understanding of galaxy evolution has been revolutionized by the discovery that luminous, dusty starburst galaxies were 1,000 times more abundant in the early Universe than at present1,2. It has, however, been difficult to measure the complete redshift distribution of these objects, especially at the highest redshifts (z > 4). Here we report a redshift survey at a wavelength of three millimetres, targeting carbon monoxide line emission from the star-forming molecular gas in the direction of extraordinarily bright millimetre-wave-selected sources. High-resolution imaging demonstrates that these sources are strongly gravitationally lensed by foreground galaxies. We detect spectral lines in 23 out of 26 sources and multiple lines in 12 of those 23 sources, from which we obtain robust, unambiguous redshifts. At least 10 of the sources are found to lie at z > 4, indicating that the fraction of dusty starburst galaxies at high redshifts is greater than previously thought. Models of lens geometries in the sample indicate that the background objects are ultra-luminous infrared galaxies, powered by extreme bursts of star formation."
https://openalex.org/W2025155497,"The crystal structure of the transcriptional regulator HNF-4α bound to its DNA response element and coactivator-derived peptides is described, revealing a multidomain convergence centre that serves as an allosteric transmission system. The nuclear receptor HNF-4α is an important transcriptional regulator of liver and pancreatic genes and its dysfunction has been linked to maturity-onset diabetes of the young, kidney failure and metabolic syndrome. Fraydoon Rastinejad and colleagues describe a crystal structure of the multidomain HNF-4α homodimer bound to its DNA response element and coactivator-derived peptides. The structure reveals a domain convergence centre connecting multiple domains and serving as an allosteric transmission system for propagating signals between the ligand-binding and DNA-binding domains. The architecture of HNF-4α is compared to the only other known structure of a multidomain nuclear receptor complex, that of PPAR-γ–RXR-α. The hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF-4α; also known as NR2A1) is a member of the nuclear receptor (NR) family of transcription factors, which have conserved DNA-binding domains and ligand-binding domains1,2. HNF-4α is the most abundant DNA-binding protein in the liver, where some 40% of the actively transcribed genes have a HNF-4α response element1,3,4. These regulated genes are largely involved in the hepatic gluconeogenic program and lipid metabolism3,5,6. In the pancreas HNF-4α is also a master regulator, controlling an estimated 11% of islet genes7. HNF-4α protein mutations are linked to maturity-onset diabetes of the young, type 1 (MODY1) and hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia8,9,10,11. Previous structural analyses of NRs, although productive in elucidating the structure of individual domains, have lagged behind in revealing the connectivity patterns of NR domains. Here we describe the 2.9 Å crystal structure of the multidomain human HNF-4α homodimer bound to its DNA response element and coactivator-derived peptides. A convergence zone connects multiple receptor domains in an asymmetric fashion, joining distinct elements from each monomer. An arginine target of PRMT1 methylation protrudes directly into this convergence zone and sustains its integrity. A serine target of protein kinase C is also responsible for maintaining domain–domain interactions. These post-translational modifications lead to changes in DNA binding by communicating through the tightly connected surfaces of the quaternary fold. We find that some MODY1 mutations, positioned on the ligand-binding domain and hinge regions of the receptor, compromise DNA binding at a distance by communicating through the interjunctional surfaces of the complex. The overall domain representation of the HNF-4α homodimer is different from that of the PPAR-γ–RXR-α heterodimer, even when both NR complexes are assembled on the same DNA element. Our findings suggest that unique quaternary folds and interdomain connections in NRs could be exploited by small-molecule allosteric modulators that affect distal functions in these polypeptides."
https://openalex.org/W1978282766,"A hallmark of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9)-methylated heterochromatin, conserved from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe to humans, is its ability to spread to adjacent genomic regions. Central to heterochromatin spread is heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), which recognizes H3K9-methylated chromatin, oligomerizes and forms a versatile platform that participates in diverse nuclear functions, ranging from gene silencing to chromosome segregation. How HP1 proteins assemble on methylated nucleosomal templates and how the HP1-nucleosome complex achieves functional versatility remain poorly understood. Here we show that binding of the key S. pombe HP1 protein, Swi6, to methylated nucleosomes drives a switch from an auto-inhibited state to a spreading-competent state. In the auto-inhibited state, a histone-mimic sequence in one Swi6 monomer blocks methyl-mark recognition by the chromodomain of another monomer. Auto-inhibition is relieved by recognition of two template features, the H3K9 methyl mark and nucleosomal DNA. Cryo-electron-microscopy-based reconstruction of the Swi6-nucleosome complex provides the overall architecture of the spreading-competent state in which two unbound chromodomain sticky ends appear exposed. Disruption of the switch between the auto-inhibited and spreading-competent states disrupts heterochromatin assembly and gene silencing in vivo. These findings are reminiscent of other conditionally activated polymerization processes, such as actin nucleation, and open up a new class of regulatory mechanisms that operate on chromatin in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2015788406,"Centrosome duplication is critical for cell division, and genome instability can result if duplication is not restricted to a single round per cell cycle. Centrosome duplication is controlled in part by CP110, a centriolar protein that positively regulates centriole duplication while restricting centriole elongation and ciliogenesis. Maintenance of normal CP110 levels is essential, as excessive CP110 drives centrosome over-duplication and suppresses ciliogenesis, whereas its depletion inhibits centriole amplification and leads to highly elongated centrioles and aberrant assembly of cilia in growing cells. CP110 levels are tightly controlled, partly through ubiquitination by the ubiquitin ligase complex SCF(cyclin F) during G2 and M phases of the cell cycle. Here, using human cells, we report a new mechanism for the regulation of centrosome duplication that requires USP33, a deubiquitinating enzyme that is able to regulate CP110 levels. USP33 interacts with CP110 and localizes to centrioles primarily in S and G2/M phases, the periods during which centrioles duplicate and elongate. USP33 potently and specifically deubiquitinates CP110, but not other cyclin-F substrates. USP33 activity antagonizes SCF(cyclin F)-mediated ubiquitination and promotes the generation of supernumerary centriolar foci, whereas ablation of USP33 destabilizes CP110 and thereby inhibits centrosome amplification and mitotic defects. To our knowledge, we have identified the first centriolar deubiquitinating enzyme whose expression regulates centrosome homeostasis by countering cyclin-F-mediated destruction of a key substrate. Our results point towards potential therapeutic strategies for inhibiting tumorigenesis associated with centrosome amplification."
https://openalex.org/W2171485576,"Endogenous prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a potent regulator of haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) retention in the bone marrow; inhibition of endogenous PGE2 signalling by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs results in enhanced HSC and haematopoietic progenitor cell mobility via E-prostanoid 4 (EP4) receptor antagonism. The haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) microenvironment supports progenitor cells producing new circulating blood cells yet prevents the inappropriate exit of immature cells into the bloodstream. This study identifies endogenous prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as a component in the maintenance of this delicate balance. Louis M. Pelus and colleagues show that inhibition of endogenous PGE2 signalling by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) significantly increases the release of functional haematopoietic stem and progenitors from bone marrow into the peripheral blood, with additive effects when used in conjunction with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Tests in primates and human volunteers suggest a strategy that might be used therapeutically to enhance transplantation survival: administration of NSAIDs (aspirin, ibuprofen and meloxicam) enhances stem-cell mobilization, with faster haematologic recovery and enhanced long-term stem-cell repopulation of haematopoietic grafts. To maintain lifelong production of blood cells, haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are tightly regulated by inherent programs and extrinsic regulatory signals received from their microenvironmental niche. Long-term repopulating HSCs reside in several, perhaps overlapping, niches that produce regulatory molecules and signals necessary for homeostasis and for increased output after stress or injury1,2,3,4,5. Despite considerable advances in the specific cellular or molecular mechanisms governing HSC–niche interactions, little is known about the regulatory function in the intact mammalian haematopoietic niche. Recently, we and others described a positive regulatory role for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on HSC function ex vivo6,7. Here we show that inhibition of endogenous PGE2 by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment in mice results in modest HSC egress from the bone marrow. Surprisingly, this was independent of the SDF-1–CXCR4 axis implicated in stem-cell migration. Stem and progenitor cells were found to have differing mechanisms of egress, with HSC transit to the periphery dependent on niche attenuation and reduction in the retentive molecule osteopontin. Haematopoietic grafts mobilized with NSAIDs had superior repopulating ability and long-term engraftment. Treatment of non-human primates and healthy human volunteers confirmed NSAID-mediated egress in other species. PGE2 receptor knockout mice demonstrated that progenitor expansion and stem/progenitor egress resulted from reduced E-prostanoid 4 (EP4) receptor signalling. These results not only uncover unique regulatory roles for EP4 signalling in HSC retention in the niche, but also define a rapidly translatable strategy to enhance transplantation therapeutically."
https://openalex.org/W2057561668,"In mammals, sex differentiation of primordial germ cells (PGCs) is determined by extrinsic cues from the environment. In mouse female PGCs, expression of stimulated by retinoic acid gene 8 (Stra8) and meiosis are induced in response to retinoic acid provided from the mesonephroi. Given the widespread role of retinoic acid signalling during development, the molecular mechanisms that enable PGCs to express Stra8 and enter meiosis in a timely manner are unknown. Here we identify gene-dosage-dependent roles in PGC development for Ring1 and Rnf2, two central components of the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). Both paralogues are essential for PGC development between days 10.5 and 11.5 of gestation. Rnf2 is subsequently required in female PGCs to maintain high levels of Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1) and Nanog expression, and to prevent premature induction of meiotic gene expression and entry into meiotic prophase. Chemical inhibition of retinoic acid signalling partially suppresses precocious Oct4 downregulation and Stra8 activation in Rnf2-deficient female PGCs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses show that Stra8 is a direct target of PRC1 and PRC2 in PGCs. These data demonstrate the importance of PRC1 gene dosage in PGC development and in coordinating the timing of sex differentiation of female PGCs by antagonizing extrinsic retinoic acid signalling."
https://openalex.org/W1986978265,"Informed consent is the cornerstone of human research subject protection. Many subjects sign consent documents without understanding the study purpose, procedures, risks, benefits, and their rights. Proof of comprehension is not required and rarely obtained. Understanding might improve by using an interactive system with multiple options for hearing, viewing and reading about the study and the consent form at the subject’s own pace with testing and immediate feedback. This prospective randomized study compared the IRB-approved paper ICF for an actual clinical research study with an interactive presentation of the same study and its associated consent form using an iPad device in two populations: clinical research professionals, and patients drawn from a variety of outpatient practice settings. Of the 90 participants, 69 completed the online test and survey questions the day after the session (maximum 36 hours post-session). Among research professionals (n = 14), there was a trend (p = .07) in the direction of iPad subjects testing better on the online test (mean correct = 77%) compared with paper subjects (mean correct = 57%). Among patients (n = 55), iPad subjects had significantly higher test scores than standard paper consent subjects (mean correct = 75% vs 58%, p < .001). For all subjects, the total time spent reviewing the paper consent was 13.2 minutes, significantly less than the average of 22.7 minutes total on the three components to be reviewed using the iPad (introductory video, consent form, interactive quiz). Overall satisfaction and overall enjoyment slightly favored the interactive iPad presentation. This study demonstrates that combining an introductory video, standard consent language, and an interactive quiz on a tablet-based system improves comprehension of research study procedures and risks."
https://openalex.org/W2015734787,"Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) (CD326) is a surface glycoprotein expressed by invasive carcinomas and some epithelia. Herein, we report that EpCAM regulates the composition and function of tight junctions (TJ). EpCAM accumulated on the lateral interfaces of human colon carcinoma and normal intestinal epithelial cells but did not co-localize with TJ. Knockdown of EpCAM in T84 and Caco-2 cells using shRNAs led to changes in morphology and adhesiveness. TJ formed readily after EpCAM knockdown; the acquisition of trans-epithelial electroresistance was enhanced, and TJ showed increased resistance to disruption by calcium chelation. Preparative immunoprecipitation demonstrated that EpCAM bound tightly to claudin-7. Co-immunoprecipitation documented associations of EpCAM with claudin-7 and claudin-1 but not claudin-2 or claudin-4. Claudin-1 associated with claudin-7 in co-transfection experiments, and claudin-7 was required for association of claudin-1 with EpCAM. EpCAM knockdown resulted in decreases in claudin-7 and claudin-1 proteins that were reversed with lysosome inhibitors. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that claudin-7 and claudin-1 continually trafficked into lysosomes. Although EpCAM knockdown decreased claudin-1 and claudin-7 protein levels overall, accumulations of claudin-1 and claudin-7 in TJ increased. Physical interactions between EpCAM and claudins were required for claudin stabilization. These findings suggest that EpCAM modulates adhesion and TJ function by regulating intracellular localization and degradation of selected claudins."

The activity of the mitochondrial fission enzyme dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) is finely tuned by several post-translational modifications.

https://openalex.org/W2033127393,"Colorectal neoplasia is the third most common cancer worldwide. Environmental factors such as diet are known to be involved in the etiology of this cancer. Several epidemiological studies have suggested that specific neo-formed mutagenic compounds related to meat consumption are an underlying factor involved in the association between diet and colorectal cancer. Heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are known mutagens and possible human carcinogens formed at the same time in meat during cooking processes. We studied the genotoxicity of the model PAH benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) and HCA 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), alone or in mixture, using the mouse intestinal cell line Apc(Min/+), mimicking the early step of colorectal carcinogenesis, and control Apc(+/+) cells. The genotoxicity of B(a)P and PhIP was investigated using both cell lines, through the quantification of B(a)P and PhIP derived DNA adducts, as well as the use of a genotoxic assay based on histone H2AX phosphorylation quantification. Our results demonstrate that heterozygous Apc mutated cells are more effective to metabolize B(a)P. We also established in different experiments that PhIP and B(a)P were more genotoxic on Apc (Min/+) cells compared to Apc (+/+) . Moreover when tested in mixture, we observed a combined genotoxicity of B(a)P and PhIP on the two cell lines, with an increase of PhIP derived DNA adducts in the presence of B(a)P. Because of their genotoxic effects observed on heterozygous Apc mutated cells and their possible combined genotoxic effects, both B(a)P and PhIP, taken together, could be implicated in the observed association between meat consumption and colorectal cancer."

Whereas several actin-binding proteins are known to be regulated by changes in intracellular pH, detailed information regarding the effect of pH on the actin dynamics itself is still lacking. Here, we combine bulk assays, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy techniques, and theory to comprehensively characterize the effect of pH on actin polymerization. We show that both nucleation and elongation are strongly enhanced at acidic pH, with a maximum close to the pI of actin. Monomer association rates are similarly affected by pH at both ends, although dissociation rates are differentially affected. This indicates that electrostatics control the diffusional encounter but not the dissociation rate, which is critical for the establishment of actin filament asymmetry. A generic model of protein-protein interaction, including electrostatics, explains the observed pH sensitivity as a consequence of charge repulsion.

Arrays and networks of actin filaments in turn provide cells with a skeleton that determines shape and helps to resist and sense mechanical deformation (4Albiges-Rizo C. Destaing O. Fourcade B.

An essential feature of the actin cytoskeleton is its dynamic nature, known to be regulated by a multitude of signaling pathways. However, one ubiquitous parameter that has been shown to affect actin polymerization (21Wang F. Sampogna R.V. Ware B.R. pH dependence of actin self-assembly.Biophys. J. 1989; 55: 293-298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 22Zimmerle C.T. Frieden C. Effect of pH on the mechanism of actin polymerization.Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7766-7772Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) has been overlooked in most studies, i.e. pH. The physiological role of increasing pH in actin polymerization has already been observed in early studies on fertilization of sea urchin eggs (6Begg D.A. Rebhun L.I. pH regulates the polymerization of actin in the sea urchin egg cortex.J. Cell Biol. 1979; 83: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and on the acrosomal reaction of echinoderm sperms (7Tilney L.G. Kiehart D.P. Sardet C. Tilney M. Polymerization of actin. IV.

More recently, molecular mechanisms contributing to pH regulation of actin turnover (8Frantz C. Barreiro G. Dominguez L. Chen X. Eddy R. Condeelis J. Kelly M.J. Jacobson M.P. Barber D.L.

In this respect, the major actin severing and depolymerizing factor cofilin has been shown to be inhibited by low pH (8Frantz C. Barreiro G. Dominguez L. Chen X. Eddy R. Condeelis J. Kelly M.J.

Similarly, activity of talin, which links actin to integrins in focal adhesion and helps traction force generation, has been shown to be sensitive to local pH (9Srivastava J. Barreiro G. Groscurth S.

Life at the leading edge.Cell. 2011; 145: 1012-1022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). NHE1 has been shown to directly affect cell migration by locally modulating intracellular pHi (11Denker S.P. Barber D.L.

Schwab A. Role of the Na/H exchanger NHE1 in cell migration.Acta Physiol. 2006; 187: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the localization of NHE1 itself is mediated by the actin cytoskeleton (13Denker S.P. Barber D.L. Ion transport proteins anchor and regulate the cytoskeleton.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). pHi is highly regulated to prevent disruption of basic cell functions such as enzyme activity, membrane permeability, cellular metabolism, ATP maintenance, cell proliferation, and apoptotic mechanisms (14Brooks C.

Not surprisingly, dynamic changes in pH are linked to pathogenic conditions, with many cancer cells exhibiting elevated pHi (18Cardone R.A. Casavola V. Reshkin S.J.

Effect of pH on the mechanism of actin polymerization.Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7766-7772Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In general, pH modulates protein electrostatics by altering the protonation state of amino acid side chains, therefore influencing protein-protein interactions (e.g. actin/actin or actin/actin-binding protein). In this way, electrostatics can enhance or retard reaction rates of complex formation that are limited by diffusion (23Qin S. Pang X. Zhou H.X. Automated prediction of protein association rate constants.Structure. 2011; 19: 1744-1751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 24Zhou H.X. Rate theories for biologists.Q. Rev. Biophys. 2010; 43: 219-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), such as barbed-end actin filament elongation (25Drenckhahn D. Pollard T.D. Elongation of actin filaments is a diffusion-limited reaction at the barbed end and is accelerated by inert macromolecules.J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12754-12758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was suggested, using Brownian dynamic simulations, that electrostatics could establish the actin filament asymmetry (26Sept D. Elcock A.H. McCammon J.A. Computer simulations of actin polymerization can explain the barbed-pointed end asymmetry.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), although this prediction has so far not been tested experimentally. Here, we use biochemical assays, TIRF microscopy (TIRFM), and advanced fluorescence fluctuation methods to explore the effects of electrostatics on actin nucleation and elongation. A generic theoretical model provides a framework for our observations. G-actin was purified from rabbit or chicken skeletal muscle (27Spudich J.A. Watt S. The regulation of rabbit skeletal muscle contraction. I. Biochemical studies of the interaction of the tropomyosin-troponin complex with actin and the proteolytic fragments of myosin.J. Biol.

Myosin was purified and chemically inactivated with N-ethylmaleimide according to Ref. 29Breitsprecher D. Kiesewetter A.K. Linkner J. Faix J.

Actin was labeled in random surface lysines with atto488 or atto532, or it was purchased from Hypermol (Bielefeld, Germany). Polymerization of actin was induced by addition of one-tenth of the final volume of 10× KMEI buffer (1× contained the following: 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm imidazole HCl, pH 7.0) and incubation for >1 h at room temperature. For the polymerization assays, 20% pyrene-labeled actin was used (30Cooper J.A. Walker S.B. Pollard T.D. Pyrene actin: documentation of the validity of a sensitive assay for actin polymerization.J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1983; 4: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 31Riedl J. Crevenna A.H. Kessenbrock K. Yu J.H. Neukirchen D. Bista M. Bradke F. Jenne D. Holak T.A. Werb Z.

Ca2+ to Mg2+ exchange was done by adding one-tenth of the final volume of 10× ME buffer (50 μm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA) for 5 min. Polymerization was promoted by addition of one-tenth of the final volume 10× KMEI buffer. The final volume was 100 μl. Pyrene fluorescence was monitored by excitation at 365 nm and emission at 407 nm with a Cary Varian spectrofluorometer. Lag times were extracted as the intercept from the slope at the inflection point of the polymerization curve. Depolymerization was carried out by diluting 1 μm of 100% pyrene-actin (polymerized for 2 h at RT in the desired pH) in F-buffer, pH 7.1, to 10 nm. Data from Zimmerle and Frieden (22Zimmerle C.T. Frieden C. Effect of pH on the mechanism of actin polymerization.Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7766-7772Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) was digitized using the freely available program grabit in MATLAB. CD spectra from 195 to 260 nm were acquired with a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco). A protein concentration of 10 μm in P-buffer at the desired pH value was used. The measurements were performed at a bandwidth of 5 nm, a response time of 2 s, and a scan rate of 0.1 nm·s−1. For electron microscopy, a 3-μl drop of polymerized actin was incubated for 90 s on a copper grid previously plasma-cleaned for 30 s and stained with 3% uracil acetate for 30 s. Photon counting histogram experiments (32Chen Y. Müller J.D. So P.T. Gratton E. The photon counting histogram in fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy.Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 553-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) with pulsed interleaved excitation (33Müller B.K. Zaychikov E. Bräuchle C. Lamb D.C. Pulsed interleaved excitation.Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 3508-3522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) were performed on a homebuilt confocal multiparameter fluorescence detection setup (33Müller B.K. Zaychikov E. Bräuchle C. Lamb D.C. Pulsed interleaved excitation.Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 3508-3522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The multiparameter fluorescence detection setup uses a polarizing beam splitter in the detection path to separate fluorescence photons with respect to their polarization, followed by spectral separation. Hence, multicolors can be detected, and the anisotropy can be determined in addition to the fluorescence lifetime information. The system is built about a Nikon TE2000 microscope. As picosecond excitation sources, we used an amplified frequency-doubled diode laser (PicoTA, PicoQuant, Berlin) at 530 nm and a diode laser at 636 nm (LDH-P-C-635b PicoQuant) for fluorophore excitation. The laser was coupled into a single-mode fiber (AMS Technologies, Martinsried, Germany), collimated (Schäfter & Kirchhoff, Hamburg, Germany), and focused on the sample by a ×60 1.2NA water immersion objective (Plan Apo VC ×60 WI, Nikon, Germany). Average excitation powers of 5–10 microwatts were used and measured before the dichroic mirror (DualLine z532/635, AHF Analysentechnik, Munich, Germany) separating excitation and emission beam paths. The collected fluorescence was focused on a 50-μm pinhole (Thorlabs, Dachau, Germany) via the microscope tube lens. A polarizing beam splitter cube (AHF Analysentechnik) separated the two polarization planes followed by two identical emission filters (BrightLine HC 582/75, AHF Analysetechnik, Tübingen, Germany) for each polarization. Fluorescence was collected by two single-photon-counting avalanche photodiodes (×2 SPQR-16, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and registered by two independent TCSPC data collection cards (SPC-154, Becker&Hickl, Berlin, Germany). The lasers and the data collection cards were synchronized by the laser controller (Sepia, Picoquant, Berlin, Germany). For the measurements, labeled actin was diluted to the designated concentration in G-buffer for nonpolymerizing conditions and F-buffer for polymerizing conditions, respectively, and measured in a Teflon sample holder with a glass coverslip. The photon-counting histogram data (32Chen Y. Müller J.D. So P.T. Gratton E. The photon counting histogram in fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy.Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 553-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 34Müller J.D. Chen Y. Gratton E. Resolving heterogeneity on the single molecular level with the photon-counting histogram.Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 474-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) were analyzed using a bin width of 37.5 μs in a custom program written in MATLAB. For PCH analysis, 60 nm of atto532-labeled actin monomers were measured either in G- or F-buffer for 30 min. The solutions were preincubated for 60 min before the measurements were started to allow equilibration of the sample. Flow cells were made as a sandwich of a coverslip (20 × 20 mm), parafilm, and a cover slide. Flow cells were passivated by incubating them with 10% BSA in PBS for 10 min. Flow cells were washed three times with 90 μl of G-buffer. The tethering protein was then applied for 5 min and washed again three times with 90 μl of G-buffer. Actin was incubated for 5 min on ice with one-tenth volume of 10× ME buffer (MgCl2 and EGTA) to exchange Ca2+ for Mg2+. Actin-containing solution was then mixed with imaging buffer (catalase, β-mercaptoethanol, glucose oxidase, d-glucose, 0.25% (w/v) methylcellulose, and one-tenth 10× KMEI buffer, with a final pH of 7.1) and introduced into the flow cell. TIRF microcopy was performed using a TILL photonics inverted microscope. Kymographs were made using Metamorph, and further analysis was done in MATLAB. For length distribution measurements, actin was polymerized for 30 min, stabilized with Alexa488-phalloidin, and diluted 100× for imaging individual filaments on a poly-l-lysine-coated coverslip using an epifluorescence Zeiss microscope. Length measurements were done manually using ImageJ. In general, protein-protein (e.g. A and B) complex formation (AB) is described by Equation 1, A+B⟶⟵k-DkDA•B⟶⟵k-CkCAB(Eq. 1) where A·B is the transient complex defined with a separation and orientation close to the native complex but where short range interactions still have to be formed. kD and k−D are the diffusion-limited rate constant for transient complex formation and the reverse process, respectively. kC and k−C are the rate constants from the transient complex to tight native complex through conformational changes and the reverse process, respectively. The association rate constant, kon, is then defined as kDkC/k−D + kC. The dissociation rate constant, i.e. the off rate, koff, is given by k−DkC/k−D + kC. If the conformational rearrangement is very fast upon transient complex formation, it is said that the reaction is diffusion-limited or diffusion-controlled (i.e. when kC ≫ k−D). To rationalize the experimental trends in the pH and salt concentration dependence of the rate constants, we make use of a simple generic theory. We assume the reaction is completely diffusion-controlled and isotropic, and the two reactive constituents A and B, say, two actin proteins or one dimer and one actin protein, can be effectively modeled as two spheres with size (diameter) σi = 2Ri, with i = A, B, where R is equal to 2.5 nm. The reaction size is then given by σAB = (σA + σB)/2. We further assume that the two spheres interact with an isotropic pair potential VAB(r) for center-to-center distances r > σAB. The steady-state result for the diffusion-controlled rate constant kD is then given by Equation 2 (35Debye P. Reaction rates in ionic solutions.Trans. Electrochem. Soc. 1942; 82: 265-272Crossref Google Scholar, 36von Smoluchowski M. Drei vorträge über diffusion, brownsche molekularbewegung und koagulation von kolloidteilchen.Phys. Z. 1916; 17 (585–599): 557-571Google Scholar), kD-1=14πD0∫σAB∞drexp(βVAB(r))r2(Eq. 2) where D0 is the mutual diffusion constant between the reactants and is assumed to be given by Stokes relationship shown in Equation 3, D0=∑ikBT/6 πηRi(Eq. 3) in a solvent with viscosity η, and β = kBT. As the proteins carry a (pH-dependent) net charge, the leading order interaction between the spheres can be modeled by the so-called DLVO potential (37Barrat J.-L. Hansen J.-P. Basic Concepts for Simple and Complex Liquids. Cambridge University Press, New York2003Crossref Google Scholar) shown in Equation 4, VAB(r)=VDLVO(r)=Vdisp(r)+Vdl(r)(Eq. 4) which is the sum of attractive dispersion interactions (Vdisp) and the repulsive electrostatic double-layer interaction (Vdl). Higher order multipoles are neglected in our approach but can be included in principle in Equation 2 by resolving angular degrees of freedom in the integral. To a good approximation for short distances (r ≪ σAB), Vdisp=-H24σAσBσAB(r-σAB)(Eq. 5) where H is a material constant called the Hamaker constant and is typically between 3 and 10 kBT values for proteins. We used H = 5 kBT. The double layer interaction between two charged spheres in a solution with salt concentration c is given by Equation 6, βVdl=ZiZjλBexp(κRA)1+κRAexp(κRB)1+κRBexp(-κr)r(Eq. 6) where λB = e2/4πϵ0 kBT = 0.71 nm is the Bjerrum length in water, κ = √ ̄8 πλBc the inverse (Debye-Hückel) screening length, and Zi the valency of reactant i. In our case, Zi = nizi (pH), where ni is the degree of polymerized actin of reactant i, for instance ni = 2 for a dimer. The actin net charge zi (pH) has been estimated by the Scripps APBS software for the actin protein structure (Protein Data Bank code 1J6Z) and is shown in Fig. 5. Actin has an isoelectric point at a pH ≃ 5.4. This analysis is very generic, and the trends with pH and salt should hold for every step during polymerization, i.e. dimerization, trimerization, etc., where the reactive size σAB has to be effectively adjusted. Quantitatively, the analysis ignores a few details such as anisotropic reactivity (the “patchiness”), hydrodynamic corrections to the diffusion constant, and rotational diffusion. These extensions will only slow down the reaction. Other refinements, such as a more accurate approximation of the dispersion interactions (Equation 3) or inclusion of multipoles, will also not change the calculated trends. At higher salt concentrations (above 0.1 m), nontrivial ion-specific effects may occur (38Kang H. Bradley M.J. McCullough B.R. Pierre A. Grintsevich E.E. Reisler E. De La Cruz E.M. Identification of cation-binding sites on actin that drive polymerization and modulate bending stiffness.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 16923-16927Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) as well as a reduction of any favorable electrostatically mediated interactions that stabilize filament formation (39Oda T. Iwasa M. Aihara T. Maéda Y. Narita A. The nature of the globular- to fibrous-actin transition.Nature. 2009; 457: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The observed maximal association rates at a pH of 6.3 (Fig. 5), which are higher than the predicted pI of actin at 5.4, may be due to the anisotropic reactivity of the monomer to a particular filament end. Lentiviral constructs of Lifeact-mEGFP were generated according to the protocol of Untergasser, using the ViraPowerTM II Lentiviral Gateway® expression system (Invitrogen). Cellular pHi was determined using the fluorescent H+-sensitive dye 2,7-biscarboxyethyl-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (Invitrogen) as described previously (40Tominaga T. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S.

Listeria monocytogenes 10403S strain expresses red fluorescent protein (RFP) under the actA promoter (pactA-RFP). Upon entry of the bacteria into the cytosol of the host cell, transcription of RFP is up-regulated 200-fold (42Shetron-Rama L.M. Marquis H. Bouwer H.G. Freitag N.E. Intracellular induction of Listeria monocytogenes actA expression.Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Hence, the expression of RFP in this strain correlates with entry of bacteria into the cytoplasm. Before infection with L. monocytogenes, cells were plated in MatTek dishes containing an inserted coverslip, maintained in growth medium for 24–48 h, then washed three times with PBS, and incubated with DMEM containing 10% FBS without antibiotics. A culture of L. monocytogenes incubated overnight at 30 °C was diluted 1:100 in PBS, and 5 μl of this dilution was added to the MatTek dishes and incubated for 8–14 h to achieve 90% infection. Just before imaging, the cells were washed two times with PBS and maintained in Hepes buffer (25 mm Hepes, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm glucose, 1 mm KPi buffer, 1 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) for 2–3 min during imaging. The pH-dependent motility of L. monocytogenes was tested using PSN and E266I fibroblasts cells. Cells were imaged at 37 °C using a ×100 objective on an inverted microscope system (Nikon Eclipse TE2000 Perfect Focus System; Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY), equipped with a spinning disk confocal scanner unit (CSU10; Yokogawa, Newnan, GA), 488-nm solid-state laser (LMM5; Spectral Applied Research, Richmond Hill, Canada), 561-nm solid state laser (MPB VFL-P-series), multipoint stage (MS-2000; Applied Scientific Instruments, Eugene, OR), a CoolSnap HQ2 cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ), and camera-triggered electronic shutters controlled with NIS-Elements Imaging Software (Nikon). A single confocal plane of cells was imaged for 3 min, 1 image/s, with an exposure time from 50 to 100 ms for both 488 and 561 nm excitation. Forty six L. monocytogenes trajectories per cell line were tracked by the manual tracking command in the NIS elements software. We studied the effect of pH on actin polymerization by measuring the increased fluorescence of pyrene-labeled actin. In agreement with previous reports (21Wang F. Sampogna R.V. Ware B.R. pH dependence of actin self-assembly.Biophys. J. 1989; 55: 293-298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 22Zimmerle C.T. Frieden C. Effect of pH on the mechanism of actin polymerization.Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7766-7772Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we found that polymerization kinetics were sensitive to solution pH for both muscle (Fig. 1A) and non-muscle actin (Fig. 1A, inset). The duration of the lag phase under standard polymerization conditions (i.e. 50 mm KCl and 2 mm MgCl2) exhibited a nonlinear relationship with pH (Fig. 1B), suggesting an effect on nucleation.

https://openalex.org/W1986736640,"The chloroplast CF0-CF1-ATP synthase (ATP synthase) is activated in the light and inactivated in the dark by thioredoxin-mediated redox modulation of a disulfide bridge on its γ subunit. The activity of the ATP synthase is also fine-tuned during steady-state photosynthesis in response to metabolic changes, e.g. altering CO2 levels to adjust the thylakoid proton gradient and thus the regulation of light harvesting and electron transfer. The mechanism of this fine-tuning is unknown. We test here the possibility that it also involves redox modulation. We found that modifying the Arabidopsis thaliana γ subunit by mutating three highly conserved acidic amino acids, D211V, E212L, and E226L, resulted in a mutant, termed mothra, in which ATP synthase which lacked light-dark regulation had relatively small effects on maximal activity in vivo. In situ equilibrium redox titrations and thiol redox-sensitive labeling studies showed that the γ subunit disulfide/sulfhydryl couple in the modified ATP synthase has a more reducing redox potential and thus remains predominantly oxidized under physiological conditions, implying that the highly conserved acidic residues in the γ subunit influence thiol redox potential. In contrast to its altered light-dark regulation, mothra retained wild-type fine-tuning of ATP synthase activity in response to changes in ambient CO2 concentrations, indicating that the light-dark- and metabolic-related regulation occur through different mechanisms, possibly via small molecule allosteric effectors or covalent modification."
https://openalex.org/W2073801120,"Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinases) are intracellular signaling kinases activated by phosphorylation in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli. Mammalian MAP kinase pathways are composed of three major pathways: MEK1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1)/ERK 1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2)/p90 RSK (p90 ribosomal S6 kinase), JNK (c-Jun amino (N)-terminal kinase)/c-Jun, and p38 MAPK pathways. These pathways coordinately mediate physiological processes such as cell survival, protein synthesis, cell proliferation, growth, migration, and apoptosis. The involvement of MAP kinase in noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) has been implicated in the cochlea; however, it is unknown how expression levels of MAP kinase change after the onset of NIHL and whether they are regulated by transient phosphorylation or protein synthesis. CBA/J mice were exposed to 120-dB octave band noise for 2 h. Auditory brainstem response confirmed a component of temporary threshold shift within 0-24 h and significant permanent threshold shift at 14 days after noise exposure. Levels and localizations of phospho- and total- MEK1/ERK1/2/p90 RSK, JNK/c-Jun, and p38 MAPK were comprehensively analyzed by the Bio-Plex® Suspension Array System and immunohistochemistry at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h after noise exposure. The phospho-MEK1/ERK1/2/p90 RSK signaling pathway was activated in the spiral ligament and the sensory and supporting cells of the organ of Corti, with peaks at 3-6 h and independently of regulations of total-MEK1/ERK1/2/p90 RSK. The expression of phospho-JNK and p38 MAPK showed late upregulation in spiral neurons at 48 h, in addition to early upregulations with peaks at 3 h after noise trauma. Phospho-p38 MAPK activation was dependent on upregulation of total-p38 MAPK. At present, comprehensive data on MAP kinase expression provide significant insight into understanding the molecular mechanism of NIHL, and for developing therapeutic models for acute sensorineural hearing loss."

Both diurnal and nocturnal insects use quite similar navigation strategies. This is despite the signal-to-noise ratio of the navigational cues being poor at low light conditions. To better understand the evolution of nocturnal life, we investigated the navigational efficiency of a nocturnal ant, Myrmecia pyriformis, at different light levels. Workers of M. pyriformis leave the nest individually in a narrow light-window in the evening twilight to forage on nest-specific Eucalyptus trees. The majority of foragers return to the nest in the morning twilight, while few attempt to return to the nest throughout the night. We found that as light levels dropped, ants paused for longer, walked more slowly, the success in finding the nest reduced and their paths became less straight. We found that in both bright and dark conditions ants relied predominantly on visual landmark information for navigation and that landmark guidance became less reliable at low light conditions. It is perhaps due to the poor navigational efficiency at low light levels that the majority of foragers restrict navigational tasks to the twilight periods, where sufficient navigational information is still available."
https://openalex.org/W1978782131,"Background Hyaluronan (HA) is a primary component of the extracellular matrix of cells, and it is involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of HA in neointimal formation after vascular injury and determine its tissue-specific role in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) by using a cre-lox conditional transgenic (cTg) strategy. Methods and Results HA was found to be expressed in neointimal lesions in humans with atherosclerosis and after wire-mediated vascular injury in mice. Inhibition of HA synthesis using 4-methylumbelliferone markedly inhibited neointimal formation after injury. In vitro experiments revealed that low-molecular-weight HA (LMW-HA) induced VSMC activation, including migration, proliferation, and production of inflammatory cytokines, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The migration and proliferation of VSMCs were mediated by the CD44/RhoA and CD44/ERK1/2 pathways, respectively. Because HA synthase 2 (HAS2) is predominantly expressed in injured arteries, we generated cTg mice that overexpress the murine HAS2 gene specifically in VSMCs (cHAS2/CreSM22α mice) and showed that HA overexpression markedly enhanced neointimal formation after cuff-mediated vascular injury. Further, HA-overexpressing VSMCs isolated from cHAS2/CreSM22α mice showed augmented migration, proliferation, and production of inflammatory cytokines and ROS. Conclusion VSMC-derived HA promotes neointimal formation after vascular injury, and HA may be a potential therapeutic target for cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2024859759,"The enhanced thermodynamic stability of PNA:DNA and PNA:RNA duplexes compared with DNA:DNA and DNA:RNA duplexes has been attributed in part to the lack of electrostatic repulsion between the uncharged PNA backbone and negatively charged DNA or RNA backbone. However, there are no previously reported studies that systematically evaluate the effect of ionic strength on duplex stability for PNA having a charged backbone. Here we investigate the role of charge repulsion in PNA binding by synthesizing PNA strands having negatively or positively charged side chains, then measuring their duplex stability with DNA or RNA at varying salt concentrations. At low salt concentrations, positively charged PNA binds more strongly to DNA and RNA than does negatively charged PNA. However, at medium to high salt concentrations, this trend is reversed, and negatively charged PNA shows higher affinity for DNA and RNA than does positively charged PNA. These results show that charge screening by counterions in solution enables negatively charged side chains to be incorporated into the PNA backbone without reducing duplex stability with DNA and RNA. This research provides new insight into the role of electrostatics in PNA binding, and demonstrates that introduction of negatively charged side chains is not significantly detrimental to PNA binding affinity at physiological ionic strength. The ability to incorporate negative charge without sacrificing binding affinity is anticipated to enable the development of PNA therapeutics that take advantage of both the inherent benefits of PNA and the multitude of charge-based delivery technologies currently being developed for DNA and RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2077496065,"Interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) secreted by photoreceptors plays a pivotal role in photoreceptor survival and function. Recently, a D1080N mutation in IRBP was found in patients with retinitis pigmentosa, a frequent cause of retinal degeneration. The molecular and cellular bases for pathogenicity of the mutation are unknown. Here, we show that the mutation abolishes secretion of IRBP and results in formation of insoluble high molecular weight complexes via disulfide bonds. Co-expression of protein disulfide isomerase A2 that regulates disulfide bond formation or introduction of double Cys-to-Ala substitutions at positions 304 and 1175 in D1080N IRBP promoted secretion of the mutated IRBP. D1080N IRBP was not transported to the Golgi apparatus, but accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), bound with the ER-resident chaperone proteins such as BiP, protein disulfide isomerase, and heat shock proteins. Splicing of X-box-binding protein-1 mRNA, expression of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), and cleavage of ATF6 were significantly increased in cells expressing D1080N IRBP. Moreover, D1080N IRBP induced up-regulation and nuclear translocation of the C/EBP homologous protein, a proapoptotic transcription factor associated with the unfolded protein response. These results indicate that loss of normal function (nonsecretion) and gain of cytotoxic function (ER stress) are involved in the disease mechanisms of D1080N IRBP. Chemical chaperones and low temperature, which help proper folding of many mutated proteins, significantly rescued secretion of D1080N IRBP, suggesting that misfolding is the molecular basis for pathogenicity of D1080N substitution and that chemical chaperones are therapeutic candidates for the mutation-caused blinding disease."

The Ca2+-coordinated residues were Asp132, Thr133, Asp164, Asp165, and Tyr178. Fluorescence emission spectra were measured with a Hitachi F-7000 spectrofluorometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of wild type LipL32 and its variants was determined at an excitation wavelength of 295 nm, and emission spectra were recorded within the 310–400-nm range. The secondary structures of wild type LipL32 and mutated LipL32 were analyzed at 25 °C on an CD Aviv 202 spectropolarimeter (Aviv Biomedical, Lakewood, NJ) using a 1-mm path length cuvette. The resulting spectra were corrected to remove buffer signal and smoothened using SigmaPlot 10.0. The obtained CD spectra were reported as averages of no less than three scans for each sample. CD spectra were used to determine protein stability by monitoring conformational states over a temperature range (from 30 to 80 °C). Tm values (temperature at which half-denaturation of the protein is observed) were calculated on the basis of changes in the CD signals at 218 nm, which were smoothened by fitting the equation of SigmaPlot 10.0.

The ELISA plates (Nunc-Immuno Plate; Thermo Scientific, Denmark) were primarily coated with 1 μg of TLR2 protein in 100 μl of PBS and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Wells were then washed with PBST (PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20) and blocked with 200 μl of PBS containing 1% (w/v) BSA for 1 h at 37 °C. Plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Protein samples (LipL32, mutants, wild type LipL32 in the presence of EGTA, and wild type LipL32 without the His6 tag; concentration ranges from 0 to 2 μm) in PBS were added to the attached TLR2 protein for 90 min at 37 °C, followed by a wash with PBST. Bound LipL32 protein was allowed to interact with 100 μl of anti-LipL32 antibody (1:5,000 dilution) for 1 h. Wells were then washed with PBST. Subsequently, 100 μl of HRP conjugated to donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:5,000 dilution) was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing with PBST, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) was included for color development for 15 min, and the reaction was then terminated by addition of 50 μl of 2 n H2SO4. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm in a Thermomax ELISA reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The absorbance at each data point was corrected by subtracting the value of the negative control (BSA-coated well) read. The dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated according to a prior protocol (34Pathirana R.D. O'Brien-Simpson N.M. Veith P.D. Riley P.F. Reynolds E.C.

The AFM cantilever made of silicon nitride, PNP-TR (NanoWorld, Neuchâtel, Switzerland), was cleaned sequentially by sonication in a series of solvents: 2-propanol, methanol, and deionized water (5 min each). Tips were functionalized according to a previous method with minor modifications (36Allen S. Chen X. Davies J. Davies M.C. Dawkes A.C. Edwards J.C. Roberts C.J. Sefton J. Tendler S.J. Williams P.M.

At first, probes were transferred to a 0.1% (v/v) solution of 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (Sigma) in toluene for 2 h. Following silanization, tips were sonicated in methanol and deionized water (5 min each), consecutively. For functionalization, AFM tips were incubated in a 1% (v/v) solution of glutaraldehyde (grade II, Sigma) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. For anchoring proteins, the tips were rinsed with PBS to remove the remaining glutaraldehyde and subsequently incubated with proteins, including wild type LipL32, Ca2+-binding variants, wild type LipL32 in the presence of EGTA, denatured wild type LipL32, and BSA, independently, for 1 h at room temperature. The functionalized AFM tips were rinsed three times with PBS to remove unbound proteins (36Allen S. Chen X. Davies J. Davies M.C. Dawkes A.C. Edwards J.C. Roberts C.J. Sefton J. Tendler S.J.

In brief, the mica surface (1 cm2) was functionalized with 0.1% (v/v) 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (Sigma) (AP-mica) followed then by treatment with 1% (v/v) glutaraldehyde (grade II, Sigma). The proteins (1 μg) were deposited covalently on the functionalized mica surface for 2 h at room temperature. Unbound proteins were removed, and the proteins fixed on mica were utilized for later AFM measurements. The functionalized cantilever tips had a spring constant (k) in the range of 0.02–0.08 newton/m, as determined from the amplitude of their thermal vibrations. A commercial AFM (Nanoscope III, Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA) with a J-type scanner was employed throughout this study. The force volume software measures a force curve at each of the 999 points during a two-dimensional scan over a sample surface. The X-Y scan size was 150 μm, and the Z scan distance was 5 μm at a rate of 1 Hz. The force applied to the protein-modified mica surface was kept below 400 pN. The distance force curves and force parameters were obtained according to the methods previously described (39Kim H. Arakawa H. Hatae N. Sugimoto Y. Matsumoto O. Osada T. Ichikawa A. Ikai A. Quantification of the number of EP3 receptors on a living CHO cell surface by the AFM.Ultramicroscopy. 2006; 106: 652-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For antibody neutralization analysis, the protein-modified mica was treated with anti-TLR2 antibodies (diluted 1:1,000 in PBS) for 1 h followed by five washes with PBS to remove unbound antibodies. The antibody against TLR2 (AbTLR2) was purchased from GeneTex (Irvine, CA). For binding studies, force curves from at least 10 areas on each surface were independently selected for analysis. All measurements described above were performed with modified tips and showed repeatedly similar results. The base-line Ca2+ concentration in assay medium was ∼36.2 ± 7.5 nm (n = 7), a value much below LipL32 concentration (10 μm) in the solution, ensuring any effects of carried over Ca2+ negligible in this study.

https://openalex.org/W2002302593,"HA22 is a recombinant immunotoxin that kills CD22-expressing cells by ADP-ribosylating and inactivating elongation factor-2 (EF2). HA22 is composed of an Fv that binds to CD22 fused to a portion of Pseudomonas exotoxin A. HA22 is very active in drug-resistant hairy cell leukemia but is less active in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. To understand why some patients do not respond to HA22, we isolated an HA22-resistant lymphoma cell line and showed that resistance was due to the inability of HA22 to ADP-ribosylate and inactivate EF2. We analyzed the diphthamide synthesis genes and found that the WDR85 gene was deleted. We show that WDR85 knockdown conferred HA22 resistance to sensitive cells and that sensitivity was restored by introduction of a WDR85 cDNA into resistant cells. Analysis of EF2 in the mutant cells revealed a novel form of diphthamide with an additional methyl group that prevented ADP-ribosylation and inactivation of EF2. The abnormal methylation appeared to be catalyzed by DPH5. Inactivation of the WDR85 gene could be a mechanism of immunotoxin resistance in patients undergoing immunotoxin therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2083967396,"The incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the anus, anal canal, and anorectum (SCCA) has increased over time. However, there are still no national guidelines on screening for SCCA among high-risk populations. Providers at University of California, San Francisco have been at the forefront of providing anal dysplasia screening. To determine whether such a screening program allows for earlier detection of abnormalities and consequently, improves patient survival, we conducted an ecological study using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program to compare the San Francisco-Oakland catchment area (SF-O) to other SEER sites where routine screening has not been as accessible. Cox regression models were utilized to assess the impact of residing in the SF-O region, versus other SEER sites, on cause-specific mortality hazard. Logistic regression was used to determine if site was associated with the probability of having an in situ versus invasive tumor among SCCA cases. All analyses were stratified on calendar time (1985–1995 and 1996–2008) to compare differences pre- and post- highly active anti-retroviral therapy. Among SCCA cases, being reported by the SF-O registry was associated with a four fold higher probability of having an in situ tumor (rather than an invasive tumor) [95% CI: 3.48–4.61], compared to sites outside of California, between 1996 and 2008. Cases reported from the SF-O region between 1996 and 2008 had a 39% lower mortality risk than those reported from registries outside California (95% CI: 0.51–0.72). However, there was no decrease in the rate of invasive SCCA over this period. This is the first ecological study to evaluate whether access to anal cancer screening programs may help improve patient survival by allowing for earlier detection of lesions. Our results imply that routine screening programs may help detect SCCA at an earlier stage and thus, potentially impact patient survival."
https://openalex.org/W2053247560,"A key property of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) regarding differentiation from the self-renewing quiescent to the proliferating stage is their adhesion to the bone marrow (BM) niche. An important molecule involved in proliferation and pool size of HSPCs in the BM is the hypoxia-induced urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR). Here, we show that the soluble form (sLR11) of LR11 (also called SorLA or SORL1) modulates the uPAR-mediated attachment of HSPCs under hypoxic conditions. Immunohistochemical and mRNA expression analyses revealed that hypoxia increased LR11 expression in hematological c-Kit(+) Lin(-) cells. In U937 cells, hypoxia induced a transient rise in LR11 transcription, production of cellular protein, and release of sLR11. Attachment to stromal cells of c-Kit(+) Lin(-) cells of lr11(-/-) mice was reduced by hypoxia much more than of lr11(+/+) animals. sLR11 induced the adhesion of U937 and c-Kit(+) Lin(-) cells to stromal cells. Cell attachment was increased by sLR11 and reduced in the presence of anti-uPAR antibodies. Furthermore, the fraction of uPAR co-immunoprecipitated with LR11 in membrane extracts of U937 cells was increased by hypoxia. CoCl2, a chemical inducer of HIF-1α, enhanced the levels of LR11 and sLR11 in U937 cells. The decrease in hypoxia-induced attachment of HIF-1α-knockdown cells was largely prevented by exogenously added sLR11. Finally, hypoxia induced HIF-1α binding to a consensus binding site in the LR11 promoter. Thus, we conclude that sLR11 regulates the hypoxia-enhanced adhesion of HSPCs via an uPAR-mediated pathway that stabilizes the hematological pool size by controlling cell attachment to the BM niche."
https://openalex.org/W1995279942,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a central hub where secreted or membrane-bound proteins are maturated and folded properly in eukaryotes. Maintenance of ER homeostasis is particularly important for human fungal pathogens, such as Cryptococcus neoformans, which encounter a plethora of host-mediated stresses during infection. Our previous study demonstrated that the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, composed of the evolutionarily conserved Ire1 kinase and the unique Hxl1 transcription factor, has pleiotropic roles in ER stress response, thermotolerance, antifungal drug resistance, and virulence in C. neoformans. Here, we functionally characterized an ER-resident molecular chaperone, Kar2/BiP, in C. neoformans. Conditional expression of KAR2 by the copper-regulated promoter revealed that Kar2 is essential for the viability of C. neoformans. Constitutive expression of KAR2 by the strong histone H3 promoter partially restores resistance to ER stress, cell wall stress, thermotolerance, and genotoxic stress in ire1Δ and hxl1Δ mutants, suggesting that Kar2 mainly functions downstream of the UPR pathway. Furthermore, Kar2 appears to control azole resistance in C. neoformans downstream of the UPR pathway without regulation of ERG11 or ERG3. Interestingly, we discovered that azole treatment is sensed as ER-stress and subsequently activates the Ire1-dependent Hxl1 splicing event and induction of KAR2 by the UPR pathway. In contrast, the constitutive expression of Kar2 is not sufficient to restore the Ire1-mediated regulation of capsule production in C. neoformans UPR mutants. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that Kar2 is not only essential for vegetative growth but also required for response and adaptation to the environmental stresses and antifungal drugs downstream of the UPR pathway in C. neoformans."

https://openalex.org/W2026919047,"Inhibitory glycinergic neurotransmission is terminated by sodium and chloride-dependent plasma membrane glycine transporters (GlyTs). The mainly glial glycine transporter GlyT1 is primarily responsible for the completion of inhibitory neurotransmission and the neuronal glycine transporter GlyT2 mediates the reuptake of the neurotransmitter that is used to refill synaptic vesicles in the terminal, a fundamental role in the physiology and pathology of glycinergic neurotransmission. Indeed, inhibitory glycinergic neurotransmission is modulated by the exocytosis and endocytosis of GlyT2. We previously reported that constitutive and Protein Kinase C (PKC)-regulated endocytosis of GlyT2 is mediated by clathrin and that PKC accelerates GlyT2 endocytosis by increasing its ubiquitination. However, the role of ubiquitination in the constitutive endocytosis and turnover of this protein remains unexplored. Here, we show that ubiquitination of a C-terminus four lysine cluster of GlyT2 is required for constitutive endocytosis, sorting into the slow recycling pathway and turnover of the transporter. Ubiquitination negatively modulates the turnover of GlyT2, such that increased ubiquitination driven by PKC activation accelerates transporter degradation rate shortening its half-life while decreased ubiquitination increases transporter stability. Finally, ubiquitination of GlyT2 in neurons is highly responsive to the free pool of ubiquitin, suggesting that the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCHL1), as the major regulator of neuronal ubiquitin homeostasis, indirectly modulates the turnover of GlyT2. Our results contribute to the elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the dynamic trafficking of this important neuronal protein which has pathological relevance since mutations in the GlyT2 gene (SLC6A5) are the second most common cause of human hyperekplexia."
https://openalex.org/W2051247763,"Clostridium difficile toxin B (TcdB) intoxicates target cells by glucosylating Rho GTPases. TcdB (269 kDa) consists of at least 4 functional domains including a glucosyltransferase domain (GTD), a cysteine protease domain (CPD), a translocation domain (TD), and a receptor binding domain (RBD). The function and molecular mode of action of the TD, which is the largest segment of TcdB and comprises nearly 50% of the protein, remain largely unknown. Here we show that a 97-amino-acid segment (AA1756 – 1852, designated as ?97 or D97), located in the C-terminus of the TD and adjacent to the RBD, is essential for the cellular activity of TcdB. Deletion of this segment in TcdB (designated as TxB-D97), did not adversely alter toxin enzymatic activities or its cellular binding and uptake capacity. TxB-D97 bound to and entered cells in a manner similar to TcdB holotoxin. Both wild type and mutant toxins released their GTDs similarly in the presence of inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6), and showed a similar glucosyltransferase activity in a cell-free glucosylating assay. Despite these similarities, the cytotoxic activity of TxB-D97 was reduced by more than 5 logs compared to wild type toxin, supported by the inability of TxB-D97 to glucosylate Rac1 of target cells. Moreover, the mutant toxin failed to elicit tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in macrophages, a process dependent on the glucosyltransferase activity of the toxin. Cellular fractionation of toxin-exposed cells revealed that TxB-D97 was unable to efficiently release the GTD into cytosol. Thereby, we conclude the 97-amino-acid region of the TD C-terminus of TcdB adjacent to the RBD, is essential for the toxicity of TcdB."

Here, we investigated whether this treatment induces modulation of miRNAs in tumor cells and their relevance to chemotherapy response. Array analysis identified 20 differentially expressed miRNAs in human IGROV-1 ovarian tumor cells from CpG-ODN-treated mice versus controls (16 down- and 4 up-regulated). Evaluation of the role of the 3 most differentially expressed miRNAs on sensitivity to cisplatin of IGROV-1 cells revealed significantly increased cisplatin cytotoxicity upon ectopic expression of hsa-miR-302b (up-modulated in our array), but no increased effect upon reduced expression of hsa-miR-424 or hsa-miR-340 (down-modulated in our array). Accordingly, hsa-miR-302b expression was significantly associated with time to relapse or overall survival in two data sets of platinum-treated ovarian cancer patients. Use of bio-informatics tools identified 19 mRNAs potentially targeted by hsa-miR-302b, including HDAC4 gene, which has been reported to mediate cisplatin sensitivity in ovarian cancer. Both HDAC4 mRNA and protein levels were significantly reduced in IGROV-1 cells overexpressing hsa-miR-302b. Altogether, these findings indicate that hsa-miR-302b acts as a ""chemosensitizer"" in human ovarian carcinoma cells and may represent a biomarker able to predict response to cisplatin treatment. Moreover, the identification of miRNAs that improve sensitivity to chemotherapy provides the experimental underpinning for their possible future clinical use."

So far, a clear phenotype of HMPV SH deletion mutants in vitro at the virus and host levels is absent."
https://openalex.org/W1973305063,"Manganese (Mn) is a positive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent that has been used to obtain physiological, biochemical, and molecular biological information. There is great interest to broaden its applications, but a major challenge is to increase detection sensitivity. Another challenge is distinguishing regions of Mn-related signal enhancement from background tissue with inherently similar contrast. To overcome these limitations, this study investigates the use of ultrashort echo time (UTE) and subtraction UTE (SubUTE) imaging for more sensitive and specific determination of Mn accumulation.Simulations were performed to investigate the feasibility of UTE and SubUTE for Mn-enhanced MRI and to optimize imaging parameters. Phantoms containing aqueous Mn solutions were imaged on a MRI scanner to validate simulations predictions. Breast cancer cells that are very aggressive (MDA-MB-231 and a more aggressive variant LM2) and a less aggressive cell line (MCF7) were labeled with Mn and imaged on MRI. All imaging was performed on a 3 Tesla scanner and compared UTE and SubUTE against conventional T1-weighted spoiled gradient echo (SPGR) imaging.Simulations and phantom imaging demonstrated that UTE and SubUTE provided sustained and linearly increasing positive contrast over a wide range of Mn concentrations, whereas conventional SPGR displayed signal plateau and eventual decrease. Higher flip angles are optimal for imaging higher Mn concentrations. Breast cancer cell imaging demonstrated that UTE and SubUTE provided high sensitivity, with SubUTE providing background suppression for improved specificity and eliminating the need for a pre-contrast baseline image. The SubUTE sequence allowed the best distinction of aggressive breast cancer cells.UTE and SubUTE allow more sensitive and specific positive-contrast detection of Mn enhancement. This imaging capability can potentially open many new doors for Mn-enhanced MRI in vascular, cellular, and molecular imaging."

Two-component systems are widely distributed signaling systems found in bacteria, eukaryotic microorganisms, and plants and consist of sensor histidine kinases (HKs) 2The abbreviations used are: HKhistidine kinaseDHpdimerization and histidine phosphor acceptingRRresponse regulatorKCkinase coreABDATP binding domainSeMetselenomethionineNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidPDBProtein Data BankHhighMmiddleLlow. and response regulators (RRs) (3Gao R.

Protein histidine kinases: assembly of active sites and their regulation in signaling pathways.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2010; 13: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A typical bacterial two-component signal transduction system involves sensing of internal or external signals by a HK, leading to its autophosphorylation at a histidine residue, followed by phosphoryl transfer to an aspartate residue in an N-terminal phosphoacceptor (receiver; REC) domain of the cognate RR, which affects the properties of the C-terminal DNA binding domain. Activation of the RR by phosphorylation thereby regulates downstream gene expression and is deactivated by dephosphorylation.

M. tuberculosis has been demonstrated to have 12 two-component systems, involving 13 contributing HK (5Tucker P.A. Nowak E. Morth J.P. Two-component systems of Mycobacterium tuberculosis: structure-based approaches.Methods Enzymol. 2007; 423: 479-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Among these HKs, two, DosS and DosT, function with a single RR, DosR, which functions to up-regulate downstream genes essential for the survival of M. tuberculosis in hypoxic conditions (6Roberts D.M. Liao R.P. Wisedchaisri G. Hol W.G. Sherman D.R. Two sensor kinases contribute to the hypoxic response of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.J. Biol.

Activation of DosR induces a dormant state in the bacterium, allowing it to survive successfully within macrophages. DosS and DosT play roles in the recognition of hypoxic conditions as redox and oxygen sensors, respectively, and are structurally very similar to one another (8Kumar A. Toledo J.C. Patel R.P. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Steyn A.J. Mycobacterium tuberculosis DosS is a redox sensor and DosT is a hypoxia sensor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The architecture of these HKs can be divided into an N-terminal sensor core and a C-terminal kinase core (KC) (see Fig. 1A) (10Sardiwal S. Kendall S.L. Movahedzadeh F. Rison S.C. Stoker N.G. Djordjevic S. A GAF domain in the hypoxia/NO-inducible Mycobacterium tuberculosis DosS protein binds haem.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). There are two GAF domains in the sensor cores; the first of these, GAF-A, has a heme group that functions to sense oxygen or redox status (11Cho H.Y. Cho H.J. Kim Y.M. Oh J.I. Kang B.S.

Cho H.Y. Cho H.J. Ko I.J. Park S.W. Baik H.S. Oh J.H. Eom C.Y. Kim Y.M. Kang B.S. Oh J.I. O2- and NO-sensing mechanism through the DevSR two-component system in Mycobacterium smegmatis.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 6795-6804Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). KCs are responsible for transferring signals to the RR through their autophosphorylation and phosphate transfer to DosR. Full-length DosS and DosT are enzymatically inactive in the absence of a signal; however, the KC alone is sufficient for autophosphorylation and phosphate group transfer and is thought to be constitutively active when the sensor core is removed (8Kumar A. Toledo J.C. Patel R.P. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Steyn A.J. Mycobacterium tuberculosis DosS is a redox sensor and DosT is a hypoxia sensor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

O2- and NO-sensing mechanism through the DevSR two-component system in Mycobacterium smegmatis.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 6795-6804Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). KC consists of an ATP binding domain (ABD) and a dimerization and histidine phospho-accepting (DHp) domain, which contains the phosphate-accepting histidine (10Sardiwal S. Kendall S.L. Movahedzadeh F. Rison S.C. Stoker N.G. Djordjevic S. A GAF domain in the hypoxia/NO-inducible Mycobacterium tuberculosis DosS protein binds haem.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Because the DHp domains of DosS and DosT belong to the HisKA_3 family, they are known as HisKA domains. Based on the structures of other HKs, such as DesK (Bacillus subtilis) and HK853 (Thermotoga maritima) (14Albanesi D. Martín M. Trajtenberg F. Mansilla M.C. Haouz A. Alzari P.M. de Mendoza D.

Structure of the entire cytoplasmic portion of a sensor histidine-kinase protein.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4247-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), it can be predicted that the HisKA domains consist of two long helices and that the KC forms a dimer through four helix bundle-like interactions of the two HisKAs, with two ABDs tethered to the HisKA dimer. During the autophosphorylation reaction of the KC, the ABD transfers a phosphate group from ATP to the histidine in the HisKA. The ABD not only binds ATP but also interacts with the HisKA dimer. A number of ABD structures have been determined revealing that, in general, ABDs of HKs have conserved N box and F box elements and three G boxes for ATP binding (16Nowak E. Panjikar S. Morth J.P.

ABDs also usually have a long characteristic loop, known as an ATP lid, between the F and G2 boxes, which covers the nucleotide; however, this can exhibit a variety of conformations in the absence of nucleotide (16Nowak E. Panjikar S. Morth J.P. Jordanova R. Svergun D.I. Tucker P.A.

The ATP lid is thought to play a role for kinase activity and to function to protect ATP from futile reactions (4Stewart R.C. Protein histidine kinases: assembly of active sites and their regulation in signaling pathways.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2010; 13: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 18Casino P. Rubio V. Marina A. Structural insight into partner specificity and phosphoryl transfer in two-component signal transduction.Cell. 2009; 139: 325-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In this study, the amino acid sequences of DosS and DosT ABDs were analyzed, revealing that they do not contain an F box or a sufficiently large peptide region to form a complete ATP lid motif, as detected in other HKs. To understand how DosS and DosT are able to anchor ATP and guide it to the HisKA in the absence of an ATP lid, we determined the crystal structures of their ABDs and found that they are in a closed state for ATP binding. Structural analyses and autophosphorylation assays of wild-type and mutant DosS KC proteins suggest that an interaction between the HisKA region and ABD is required, not only for autophosphorylation, but also to facilitate opening of the ATP binding site. Ionic interactions between Arg440 and Glu537 residues may be involved in the activation step for ATP binding to DosS. The DosS (Rv3132c) and DosT (Rv2027c) genes were cloned previously from the chromosomal DNA of the M. tuberculosis H37Rv strain (11Cho H.Y. Cho H.J. Kim Y.M. Oh J.I. Kang B.S.

The regions encoding the DosS ABD (residues 454–578) and DosT ABD (residues 451–573) were amplified by PCR using primer sets carrying restriction sites. The PCR products for DosS ABD and DosT ABD digested with the restriction enzymes were cloned into the expression vectors, pHIS-parallel vector (20Sheffield P. Garrard S. Derewenda Z. Overcoming expression and purification problems of RhoGDI using a family of “parallel” expression vectors.Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 15: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) and pET30a, respectively. Two mutations (L534M and V562M) were introduced to this DosS ABD clone for selenomethionine (SeMet) labeling, which was used for structural determination. The regions encoding the KC (residues 386–578) and HisKA (residues 380–446) of DosS were amplified by PCR and cloned into the expression vectors, pHIS-parallel vector and pET30a, respectively. Mutants of the KC, H396Q, C524S, C524S/R440C, C524S/E537C, and C524S/R440C/E537C were generated by QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene). The integrity of the insertion and mutations were verified by direct DNA sequencing. The expression of the SeMet-labeled DosS ABD mutant was induced by 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside in the Escherichia coli strain B834 (Novagen) grown at log phase in M9 medium containing 25 μg/ml SeMet at 37 °C. The cells were then grown for an additional 24 h at 25 °C. For the wild-type protein, the E. coli strain BL21(DE3), carrying the recombinant plasmid, was grown in LB medium. The cells were grown for an additional 21 h at 18 °C after induction. The expressed protein was purified by affinity chromatography using a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen). The recombinant protein was digested using recombinant tobacco etch virus protease at 20 °C in the presence of 0.5 mm EDTA and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After complete digestion, the His6 tag was removed using a Ni-NTA column. Gel filtration was performed with a Superdex G75 column (GE Healthcare), equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 300 mm NaCl, and the fractions containing ABD were collected and concentrated using Centriprep YM10 (Millipore) for crystallization. The purified protein contains an additional four amino acids (GAMV) at the N terminus arising from the cloning procedure. The DosT ABD was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3). Cells grown to mid-log phase in LB broth containing kanamycin were induced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.2 mm) and cultivated overnight at 18 °C. The harvested cells were frozen at −20 °C and then thawed at 4 °C. The expressed protein was purified by affinity chromatography using a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen) and gel filtration chromatography with a Superdex G75 column (GE Healthcare), equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, and the fractions containing ABD were collected and concentrated using Centriprep YM10 (Millipore) for crystallization. The purified protein contains an additional eight (LEHHHHHH) amino acids at the C terminus arising from the cloning procedure. For autophosphorylation and ATP binding assays, the DosS HisKA domain was obtained in a similar manner to the DosT ABD and DosS KC, and its mutants were expressed and purified in the same way as the wild-type DosS ABD. Purified DosS HisKA and KC have the additional amino acids (LEHHHHHH or GAMDP) at the C and N termini, respectively. Crystallization of the purified proteins was initially performed with commercially available sparse matrix screens (Hampton Research and Emerald Biostructures) using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method at 21 °C. After optimization, the best crystals of the SeMet-substituted DosS ABD were obtained under conditions of 0.1 m sodium citrate (pH 6.0) containing 15% (w/v) PEG 1500 and 0.2 m zinc acetate, with a protein concentration of 20 mg/ml. The crystal was transferred to a cryo-protectant solution containing an additional 16% glycerol in the crystallization solution, prior to x-ray data diffraction collection. After a fluorescence scan, a single anomalous x-ray dispersion data for the SeMet crystal was collected at a wavelength corresponding to the selenium absorption peak (0.97908 Å) using a Quantum 210 CCD detector at the 6B beamline of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory. DosT ABD crystals suitable for data collection were obtained in drops where 1.25 μl of 18 mg/ml protein solution in storage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl) was mixed with 1.25 μl of reservoir solution (1.5 m NaCl, 10% ethanol). For data collection, 24% glycerol was added to the reservoir solution, and crystals were immediately placed in a −173 °C nitrogen-gas stream. X-ray diffraction data of native crystals were collected at a resolution of 1.9 Å at the 6B beamline of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory. The detector distance was set to 150 mm, and diffraction data were collected each 1.0° oscillation per frame. The collected data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the HKL-2000 software package (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of x-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38501) Google Scholar). The SeMet crystal of the DosS ABD belongs to the space group P41212, with unit cell parameters of a = 53.2, b = 53.2, and c = 184.6 Å. The crystal of the DosT ABD belongs to the space group P212121, with unit cell parameters of a = 50.9, b = 65.9, and c = 72.7 Å. The structure of the SeMet-substituted DosS ABD was determined by the single anomalous dispersion method, at a resolution of 1.8 Å. Six selenium atoms were identified in the asymmetric unit using SOLVE (22Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Automated MAD and MIR structure solution.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar), and density modification and subsequent automated model building was performed with RESOLVE (23Terwilliger T.C. Maximum-likelihood density modification.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar). The RESOLVE-built partial model was used as a guide to build the remainder of the protein manually into density-modified electron density maps with the program COOT (24Emsley P. Cowtan K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23168) Google Scholar). Refinement with isotropic displacement parameters was performed with Refmac5 (25Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Refinement of macromolecular structures by the maximum-likelihood method.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13839) Google Scholar) in the CCP4 suite (26Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4The CCP4 suite: programs for protein crystallography.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19742) Google Scholar). The Rwork and Rfree values of the refined structure were 0.186 and 0.236, respectively. The structure of the native DosT ABD was determined using the crystal structure of the DosS ABD as the search model and the molecular replacement method with AMoRe software (27Navaza J. AMoRe: an automated package for molecular replacement.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). The asymmetric unit contains two molecules and the Matthews coefficient, Vm, is calculated to be 2.13 Å3/Da, corresponding to a solvent content of 42.2%. Model building and structure refinement were carried out using COOT and Refmac5, respectively. The crystal structure was determined at a resolution of 1.9 Å, with Rwork = 0.194 and Rfree = 0.232. The final models have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (28Berman H. Henrick K. Nakamura H. Announcing the worldwide Protein Data Bank.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 980Crossref PubMed Scopus (1899) Google Scholar) under PDB codes 3ZXO and 3ZXQ for the SeMet-substituted DosS ABD and DosT ABD, respectively. Protein autophosphorylation reactions were carried out using 15 μm protein for 15 min at 30 °C in autophosphorylation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 50 mm KCl and 25 mm MgCl2). The reactions were initiated by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/ml, 3000 Ci/mmol) and unlabeled ATP to a final concentration of 10 μm, terminated by the addition of 2× gel-loading buffer containing 4% SDS and 0.2 m dithiothreitol, and subjected to SDS-PAGE on 15% polyacrylamide gels. For the SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, a protein sample was mixed with the gel-loading buffer without dithiothreitol and incubated for 2 min. To detect bound ATP in proteins, the autophosphorylation reaction mixtures were also subject to native PAGE on 12% polyacrylamide gels. For native PAGE after incubation with [γ-32P]ATP, gel-loading buffer without SDS was used for PAGE. To identify ATPase activity, purified wild-type and H395Q mutant KC and ABD were used in an ADP assay reaction using a colorimetric assay kit (Biovison, Mountain View, CA). The reaction mixture for ATP hydrolysis contains 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 30 nmol ATP, and various amounts of proteins (7.2 nmol, 14.4 nmol, and 21.6 nmol). Mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min, and the ADP colorimetric reaction completed by the addition of the reaction components (ADP assay buffer, ADP probe, ADP converter, and ADP developer) and incubation for 30 min at room temperature. After dilution with 900 μl of DDW, absorbance at 570 nm was measured. For insight into the DosS ABD and DosT ABD, their amino acid sequences were compared with those of conceptually translated ABDs of other known HK genes from M. tuberculosis H37Rv. This sequence alignment revealed that the domain sequences can be divided into two groups, one containing both the conserved F box and the ATP lid, known to be involved in ATP binding, and the other without either of these motifs (Fig. 1B). The former group belongs to the OmpR family and includes the gene products of PrrB, TrcS, TcrY, PhoR, SenX3, MprB, mtrB, KdpD, and Rv0600c, whereas DosS, DosT, NarS, and PdtaS belong to the latter group. Among the HKs of M. tuberculosis, the crystal structure of the PrrB ABD has been determined (16Nowak E. Panjikar S. Morth J.P. Jordanova R. Svergun D.I. Tucker P.A. Structural and functional aspects of the sensor histidine kinase PrrB from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Structure. 2006; 14: 275-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and other OmpR family members also contain a conserved N box, F box, and three G (G1, G2, and G3) boxes involved in ATP binding. ABDs belonging to this group share key residues in each of the conserved boxes. The ATP lid motif, which connects the F and G2 boxes, consists of 11–14 residues and is absent from the second group of ABDs, including those of DosS and DosT. Although the ABDs of these kinases have conserved N and G boxes, they also lack an F box, and their G1 and G2 boxes are directly connected by 8–15 residues. DosS, DosT, and NarS belong to the NarL family, whereas PdtaS is considered to be a member of the AmiR family. DesK, a NarL family HK from B. subtilis, which also lacks the ATP lid motif, has been well characterized structurally (29Trajtenberg F. Graña M. Ruétalo N. Botti H. Buschiazzo A. Structural and enzymatic insights into the ATP binding and autophosphorylation mechanism of a sensor histidine kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 24892-24903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A region connecting its G1 and G2 boxes functions as an ATP lid and contains two phenylalanine residues to retain an ATP molecule in a similar manner to an F box. Compared with the DesK ABD, DosS ABD and DosT ABD are three residues shorter, and DosS has only one phenylalanine, whereas DosT has none in this region of the molecule (Fig. 1B). The observation that DosS and DosT proteins apparently lack the F box and ATP lid regions suggests they may possess a previously undescribed ATP binding mechanism. To explore this possibility, we first determined the crystal structure of the DosS ABD at a resolution of 1.8 Å (Table 1). The crystal of the DosS ABD contained two almost identical ABD molecules in an asymmetric unit. Each DosS ABD molecule consisted of three α helices and a five stranded β-sheet with a strand order of 1-2-3-5-4 (Fig. 2A). The helices are all located on one side of the sheet, resulting in a globular shape revealing an α/β sandwich fold. A search for homologous proteins using DALI revealed structural similarities of the DosS ABD to ABDs of HK, including B. subtilis DesK (PDB code 3GIG), T. maritima CheA (PDB code 1I59), Salmonella enterica PhoQ (PDB code 3CGZ), and M. tuberculosis PrrB (PDB code 1YSR) with Z-scores of 14.7, 12.8, 11.9, and 11.3, respectively. The crystal structure of the DosS ABD clearly showed the absence of an ATP lid motif, as expected from the amino acid sequence alignment, although its overall structure is similar to those of canonical ABDs of HKs.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsDosS ABDDosT ABDData collectionX-ray sourcePAL 6BPAL 6BWavelength (Å)0.979081.1000Space groupP41212P212121Unit cell parameters (Å)53.2 × 53.2 × 184.650.9 × 65.9 × 72.7Resolution limit (Å)50–1.8 (1.83–1.80)aNumbers in parentheses describe the relevant value for the last resolution shell.40–1.9 (1.93–1.90)aNumbers in parentheses describe the relevant value for the last resolution shell.Total reflections571,828125,573Unique reflections25,671 (1,278)19,905 (994)Redundancy22.3 (20.8)6.3 (5.8)Completeness (%)99.9 (99.9)99.9 (100.0)RsymbRsym = Σ|Ii − 〈I〉|/ΣI where Ii is the intensity of the ith observation and 〈I〉 is the mean intensity of the reflections.0.081 (0.459)0.098 (0.434)Average I/σ(I)56.0 (8.3)21.9 (4.2)RefinementSpace groupP41212P212121Resolutions (Å)46–1.932–1.9Reflections (working)20,02518,850Reflections (test)1,0931,016RworkcRwork = Σ‖Fobs| − |Fcalc‖/Σ|Fobs|, crystallographic Rfactor, and Rfree = Σ‖Fobs| − |Fcalc‖/Σ|Fobs| when all reflections belong to a test set of randomly selected data.0.1860.194RfreecRwork = Σ‖Fobs| − |Fcalc‖/Σ|Fobs|, crystallographic Rfactor, and Rfree = Σ‖Fobs| − |Fcalc‖/Σ|Fobs| when all reflections belong to a test set of randomly selected data.0.2360.232Number of water molecules190144r.m.s.d. from ideal geometrydr.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.Bond length (Å)0.0150.012Bond angle1.458°1.353°Average B factors (Å)Molecule A (main/side chain)20.5 (19.2/21.9)17.8 (16.5/19.2)Molecule B (main/side chain)22.8 (21.3/24.4)20.0 (19.3/20.8)Waters31.425.3a Numbers in parentheses describe the relevant value for the last resolution shell.b Rsym = Σ|Ii − 〈I〉|/ΣI where Ii is the intensity of the ith observation and 〈I〉 is the mean intensity of the reflections.c Rwork = Σ‖Fobs| − |Fcalc‖/Σ|Fobs|, crystallographic Rfactor, and Rfree = Σ‖Fobs| − |Fcalc‖/Σ|Fobs| when all reflections belong to a test set of randomly selected data.d r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.

The molecular weight of SmIDH was estimated to be 70 kDa by gel filtration chromatography, suggesting a homodimeric structure. SmIDH was divalent cation-dependent and Mn(2+) was found to be the most effective cation. The optimal pH of SmIDH was 7.8 and the maximum activity was around 45°C. SmIDH was completely NAD(+) dependent and its apparent Km for NAD(+) was 137 μM. In order to evaluate the role of the putative phosphorylation site at Ser102 in catalysis, two ""stably phosphorylated"" mutants were constructed by converting Ser102 into Glu102 or Asp102 in SmIDH to mimick a constitutively phosphorylated state. Meanwhile, the functional roles of another four amino acids (threonine, glycine, alanine and tyrosine) containing variant size of side chains were investigated. The replacement of Asp102 or Glu102 totally inactivated the enzyme, while the S102T, S102G, S102A and S102Y mutants decreased the affinity to isocitrate and only retained 16.0%, 2.8%, 3.3% and 1.1% of the original activity, respectively. These results reveal that Ser102 plays important role in substrate binding and is required for the enzyme function. Also, Ser102 in SmIDH is a potential phosphorylation site, indicating that the ancient NAD-dependent IDHs might be the underlying origin of ""phosphorylation mechanism"" used by their bacterial NADP-dependent homologs."
https://openalex.org/W2010005206,In this work highly localized femtosecond laser ablation is used to dissect single axons within a living Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). We present a multimodal imaging methodology for the assessment of the collateral damage induced by the laser. This relies on the observation of the tissues surrounding the targeted region using a combination of different high resolution microscopy modalities. We present the use of Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) and Polarization Sensitive SHG (PSHG) to determine damage in the neighbor muscle cells. All the above is done using a single instrument: multimodal microscopy setup that allows simultaneous imaging in the linear and non-linear regimes and femtosecond-laser ablation.
https://openalex.org/W2029797840,"Prions, the infectious agent of scrapie, chronic wasting disease and other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, are misfolded proteins that are highly stable and resistant to degradation. Prions are known to associate with clay and other soil components, enhancing their persistence and surprisingly, transmissibility. Currently, few detection and quantification methods exist for prions in soil, hindering an understanding of prion persistence and infectivity in the environment. Variability in apparent infectious titers of prions when bound to soil has complicated attempts to quantify the binding capacity of soil for prion infectivity. Here, we quantify the prion adsorption capacity of whole, sandy loam soil (SLS) typically found in CWD endemic areas in Colorado; and purified montmorillonite clay (Mte), previously shown to bind prions, by BioAssay of Subtracted Infectivity in Complex Solutions (BASICS). We incubated prion positive 10% brain homogenate from terminally sick mice infected with the Rocky Mountain Lab strain of mouse-adapted prions (RML) with 10% SLS or Mte. After 24 hours samples were centrifuged five minutes at 200×g and soil-free supernatant was intracerebrally inoculated into prion susceptible indicator mice. We used the number of days post inoculation to clinical disease to calculate the infectious titer remaining in the supernatant, which we subtracted from the starting titer to determine the infectious prion binding capacity of SLS and Mte. BASICS indicated SLS bound and removed ≥ 95% of infectivity. Mte bound and removed lethal doses (99.98%) of prions from inocula, effectively preventing disease in the mice. Our data reveal significant prion-binding capacity of soil and the utility of BASICS to estimate prion loads and investigate persistence and decomposition in the environment. Additionally, since Mte successfully rescued the mice from prion disease, Mte might be used for remediation and decontamination protocols."

https://openalex.org/W2076464154,"Mast cells play a central role in both innate and acquired immunity. When activated by IgE-dependent FcεRI cross-linking, mast cells rapidly initiate a signaling cascade and undergo an extensive release of their granule contents, including inflammatory mediators. Some SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion factor attachment protein receptor) proteins and SM (Sec1/Munc18) family proteins are involved in mast cell degranulation. However, the function of syntaxin binding protein 1 (STXBP1), a member of SM family, in mast cell degranulation is currently unknown. In this study, we examined the role of STXBP1 in IgE-dependent mast cell activation. Liver-derived mast cells (LMCs) from wild-type and STXBP1-deficient mice were cultured in vitro for the study of mast cell maturation, degranulation, cytokine and chemokine production, as well as MAPK, IκB-NFκB, and NFAT signaling pathways. In addition, in vivo models of passive cutaneous anaphylaxis and late-phase IgE-dependent inflammation were conducted in mast cell deficient W(sh) mice that had been reconstituted with wild-type or STXBP1-deficient mast cells. Our findings indicate that STXBP1 is not required for any of these important functional mechanisms in mast cells both in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrate that STXBP1 is dispensable during IgE-mediated mast cell activation and in IgE-dependent allergic inflammatory reactions."
