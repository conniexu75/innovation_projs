https://openalex.org/W2050076538,"Many foreign countries are as dependent on imports of food as the United States is on imports of oil. As the world's largest exporter of food, the United States needs reliable information on fluctuating foreign crop production. But available information is often inadequate and at best untimely. It is gathered by the foreign governments' often outmoded systems and its release may be delayed out of economic self-interest. Recently three U.S. government agencies put together a crop inventory system using satellite remote sensing and worldwide weather reporting and tested it in the Large Area Crop Inventory Experiment (LACIE). A 1977 real-time forecast of U.S.S.R. wheat production indicates that the approach works and may be expandable to other areas and other crops."
https://openalex.org/W1973994513,Analyses of the mean monthly global distributions of total ozone for the 13-year period from 1957 through 1970 reveal an upward trend of about 7.5 percent per decade in the Northern Hemisphere and about 2.5 percent per decade in the Southern Hemisphere. The increase seems to have started about March 1961 in the Northern Hemisphere and about September 1961 in the Southern Hemisphere. The cause of these trends is at present unknown.
https://openalex.org/W2029267648,"The galactic distributions of the stable isotopic species of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and silicon have been derived from the study of interstellar molecules which contain them. The resulting observational framework appears consistent with our general understanding of stellar evolution and nuclear processing in the galaxy. The greater amount of star formation that has taken place near the center of our galaxy is reflected in an enhanced abundance of processed material, notably carbon-13, in this region. Significant differences between abundances of isotopes in the solar system and corresponding values in interstellar space are also evident. Although some of these differences merely reflect the results of additional stellar processing since the condensation of the presolar nebula some 5 billion years ago, others suggest that a significant amount of atypical nuclear material is associated with the solar system."

When the hand approached and ""pecked"" a small disk to produce grain in a food hopper, the pigeons followed the hand rapidly learned to peck the disk. Birds given operant conditioning training took significantly longer to learn the same response. Under natural conditions, young animals may learn to behave like their parents simply by following parental sources of food."
https://openalex.org/W2085242758,"In situ calcium carbonate saturometry measurements suggest that the intermediate water masses of the central Pacific Ocean are close to saturation with resppect to both calcite and local carbonate sediment. The carbonate compensation depth, located at about 3700 meters in this area, appears to represent a depth above which waters are essentially saturated with respect to calcite and below which waters deviate toward undersaturation with respect to calcite."

The typical quantum yields for the formation of amino acids are 2 x 10(-5) to 4 x 10(-5). Hot hydrogen atoms may be important initiators of reactions in interstellar space and in planetary atmospheres."
https://openalex.org/W1977586224,"Venera 8 measurements of solar illumination within the atmnosphere of Venus are quantitatively analyzed by using a multilayer model atmosphere. The analysis shows that there are at least three different scattering layers it the atmosphere of Venus and the total cloud optical thickness is [unknown] 10. However, because of the nature of the observations it is not possible to determine the vertical distributiont of absorbed solar energy, which would reveal the drive for the atmospheric dynamics and the strength of the greenhouse effect. Future spacecraft observations should be designed to (i) measure both upward and downward solar fluxes, (ii) include measurements of the highest clold lavers. and (iii) employ narrow-band and broad-banzd sensors."

https://openalex.org/W2066000565,"The federal government plans to rely on a policy of ""consultation and concurrence"" with state governments in developing nuclear waste repositories. The weaknesses of the concurrence approach are analyzed, and an alternative institutional framework for locating a waste repository is proposed: a siting jury that provides representation for state and local interests, while maintaining a high level of technical review. The proposal could be tested in the siting of away-from-reactor storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel."
https://openalex.org/W1991665880,"The discovery of a carbonized ear of maize in an Adena burial mound at Athens, Athens County, Ohio, is the first indisputable evidence of Adena maize horticulture. The mound contained typical middle Adena features, including a bark prepared burial, and has yielded charcoal radiocarbon dated at 280 B.C. +/- 140 years."
