https://openalex.org/W1548261149,"Clusterin has been purified from ram rete testis fluid by conventional techniques and by immunoaffinity chromatography. The molecule is characterized as a glycoprotein having a molecular mass of approximately 80,000 Da and an isoelectric point of 3.6. The purified protein retains the capacity to elicit clustering of cells in an in vitro assay. Under reducing conditions in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, clusterin dissociates into subunits of about 40,000 Da. Heterogeneities in apparent molecular mass were eliminated after treatment of clusterin with neuraminidase. Gel filtration chromatography revealed that clusterin exists in dimeric and tetrameric forms under conditions of neutral pH and low salt concentrations. In the presence of 6 M urea, only the monomeric form is evident, with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 85,000 Da. Clusterin, which was found to contain 4.5% glucosamine, binds to concanavalin A-Sepharose and also to wheat germ agglutinin Sepharose. The amino acid composition of clusterin is reported. The possible cellular source of clusterin in rete testis fluid is discussed. It is shown that Sertoli cells in the seminiferous tubule are one potential source, since primary cultures of rat Sertoli cells secrete a protein having the same immunochemical and physical properties as clusterin isolated from ram rete testis fluid. Possible functions of clusterin are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1606168019,"To quantify the extent to which exogenous glucose is used directly or indirectly for hepatic glycogen synthesis, fasted rats were given [U-14C,3-3H] glucose intragastrically, intravenously, or as a component of a solid diet eaten ad libitum. In all cases liver glycogen was deposited at high linear rates over a 3-h period. Portal vein glucose levels seldom exceeded 8 mM. At a time when the specific activities of 3H and 14C in circulating glucose were identical with those in the administered material their values in newly synthesized glycogen were reduced by 72-88% and 50-65%, respectively. An intragastric load of unlabeled glucose sufficient to suppress completely hepatic glucose output greatly stimulated the incorporation of intravenously infused [14C]bicarbonate, [14C]lactate, [14C]alanine, and [14C] glutamine into liver glycogen. Using an improved assay the ability of liver homogenates to phosphorylate glucose at concentrations of 5-10 mM was found to be far short of what would be needed if glucose were used directly to support hepatic glycogen synthesis in vivo. These data support the notion that in the rat a major fraction of liver glycogen deposited in response to exogenous carbohydrate is formed by a pathway involving glucose leads to C3 unit leads to glycogen, although the site of the initial steps in the sequence is not yet known. The limited capacity of the liver to utilize intact glucose for glycogen synthesis might reside in its limited capacity to phosphorylate the sugar at physiological concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1511060530,"Brain spectrin tetramer was purified from pig brain membranes in milligram quantities. The tetramer had subunits of Mr = 265,000 (alpha) and Mr = 260,000 (beta), Rs = 21.4 nM, S20,w = 11 S, V = 0.725 ml/g, frictional ratio of 2.9, and calculated molecular weight of 9.7 x 10(5). The subunits were isolated in greater than 95% purity by chromatography on hydroxylapatite in 7 M urea, as described for erythrocyte spectrin (Calvert, R., Bennett, P., Gratzer, W. (1980) Eur. J. Biochem. 107, 355-361). Peptide maps of the subunits revealed few if any common peptides. The subunits were visualized by rotary shadowing as single-stranded flexible rods 100 nm in length with no homodimers by lateral or end association. When the subunits were renatured together, double-stranded tetramers 200 nm in length were formed, as well as higher oligomers. These results indicate that spectrin tetramers are formed by laterally associated alpha,beta dimers attached by head-to-head linkage of each alpha chain with a beta chain. The reassembled subunits regained the ability to increase the low shear viscosity of actin, although isolated alpha or beta subunits were inactive. Hybrid molecules were formed with brain alpha and pig erythrocyte spectrin beta subunit and were visualized as double-stranded rods 100 nm long with no tetramers. 125I-labeled brain alpha chain that was hybridized with erythrocyte beta subunit acquired the ability to bind to ankyrin sites on erythrocyte membranes. 125I-labeled brain alpha chain bound only to beta subunits of erythrocyte and brain spectrin following transfer of these polypeptides to nitrocellulose paper from sodium dodecyl sulfate gels. Affinity-purified antibodies against brain spectrin cross-reacted with both subunits of erythrocyte spectrin and with polypeptides of a similar molecular weight to brain spectrin in membranes of all tissues examined. Cross-reacting polypeptides were localized exclusively in plasma membranes of subcellular fractions from liver. These studies provide strong additional evidence that brain and mammalian erythrocyte spectrin belong to a closely related family of proteins with conserved functions in both subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1565501131,"The ability of muscarinic cholinergic agonists to interact with muscarinic receptors in nerve ending preparations and elicit an increased labeling of phosphatidate and phosphatidylinositol from 32Pi has been investigated. Two groups of brain muscarinic agonists are distinguished. Addition of acetylcholine, carbamylcholine, methacholine, or muscarine resulted in a 2-fold stimulation of phosphatidate and phosphatidylinositol labeling, while bethanechol, pilocarpine, arecoline, and oxotremorine were less effective. Simultaneous addition of two agonists from the more effective group did not result in any further increase in stimulated labeling, while the addition of agonists from the less effective group antagonized the stimulatory effect of carbamylcholine. All of the agonists could completely displace binding of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate, a muscarinic antagonist. The displacement of the labeled antagonist by the more effective agonists was more complex than that predicted from a simple mass action isotherm and was compatible with the interaction of the agonists with high and low affinity forms of the receptor. Conversely, the displacement data from less effective agonists did not deviate markedly from those predicted for interaction of the agonists with a single affinity form of the receptor. Dose-response curves for stimulated phosphatidate labeling obtained in the presence of acetylcholine, carbamylcholine, and methacholine were predominantly correlated with occupation of the low affinity form of the muscarinic receptor. These results suggest that the enhancement of phosphatidate and phosphatidylinositol turnover in brain is caused by agonist-mediated conformational changes in the muscarinic receptor and that the ability of an agonist to induce this conversion may be predicted by its differential binding to the high and low affinity forms of the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1502371571,"An alpha-mannosidase activity has been identified in a preparation of rat liver endoplasmic reticulum and shown to be distinct from the previously described Golgi alpha-mannosidases I and II and the lysosomal alpha-mannosidase. The enzyme was solubilized with deoxycholate and separated from other alpha-mannosidases by passage over concanavalin A-Sepharose to which it does not bind. The endoplasmic reticulum alpha-mannosidase cleaves alpha-1,2-linked mannoses from high mannose oligosaccharides and, unlike Golgi alpha-mannosidase I, is active against p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-mannoside (Km = 0.17 mM). It has no activity toward GlcNAc-Man5GlcNAc2 peptide, the specific substrate of the Golgi alpha-mannosidase II. The endoplasmic reticulum alpha-mannosidase activity toward p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-mannoside is relatively insensitive to swainsonine, an inhibitor of both the lysosomal alpha-mannosidase and Golgi alpha-mannosidase II. We propose that the endoplasmic reticulum alpha-mannosidase is responsible for the removal of mannose residues from asparagine-linked high mannose type oligosaccharides prior to their entry into the Golgi."
https://openalex.org/W1542137102,"3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl(HMG)-coenzyme A reductase purified from rat liver in the absence of protease inhibitors is composed of two distinct polypeptides of Mr = 51,000 and 52,500. Antibody raised to enzyme purified from rats fed a diet supplemented with cholestyramine and mevinolin inactivated HMG-CoA reductase. The antibody specifically precipitated a polypeptide of Mr = 94,000 from rat liver cells that had been previously incubated with [35S]methionine. The immunoprecipitation of the 35S-labeled polypeptide of Mr = 94,000 was prevented by addition of unlabeled pure HMG-CoA reductase (Mr = 51,000 and 52,500). Incubation of rat liver cells with mevalonolactone resulted in a decreased activity of HMG-CoA reductase and in a 40% decrease in the rate of incorporation of [35S]methionine into the immunoprecipitable reductase polypeptide of Mr = 94,000. In pulse-chase experiments, mevalonolactone enhanced the rate of degradation of the Mr = 94,000 polypeptide 3-fold. We propose that endogenous microsomal HMG-CoA reductase has a subunit of Mr = 94,000 and that the synthesis and degradation of this polypeptide are regulated by either mevalonolactone or, more likely, a product of mevalonolactone metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1538941022,"Isolated peripheral blood monocytes and lymphocytes interact with Factor Va and Factor Xa to form a functional catalytic complex which proteolytically activates prothrombin to thrombin. The kinetics of prothrombin activation were monitored continuously using the fluorescent, reversible thrombin inhibitor, dansylarginine N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide, which displays enhanced fluorescence upon binding to thrombin. Incubation of monocytes or lymphocytes with prothrombin, the cofactor (Factor Va), and the enzyme (Factor Xa) in the presence of Ca2+ generated thrombin at rates/cell exceeding those previously obtained with either bovine or human platelets. The rate of thrombin generation by monocytes exceeded that of lymphocytes and increased as monocytes adhered to a surface. Monocyte prothrombinase activity appears to be mediated through interactions, whereby Factor Va forms a receptor for Factor Xa at the monocyte surface. Monocytes possess approximately 16,100 Factor Va binding sites with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 4 X 10(-11) M. In addition, isolated, well washed monocytes and lymphocytes, respectively, contain approximately 61,400 +/- 9,900 and 24,500 +/- 4,800 molecules of Factor V/cell as determined by radioimmunoassay. Bioassay data of mononuclear cell preparations paralleled the radioimmunoassay data. The Factor V associated with washed mononuclear cells appears to be intracellular and not membrane-associated. The release of Factor V, and perhaps other sequestered coagulation factors, by these immunoreactive cells at an inflammatory site, coupled with the ability of these cells to effect thrombin generation may explain the relationship between extravascular fibrin deposition and mononuclear cell accumulation in the pathogenesis of inflammatory lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2075109763,"DIF is an endogenous extracellular signal that may control differentiation of D. discoideum cells. It is a dialyzable, lipid-like factor that induces stalk cell formation among isolated amebae incubated in vitro with cAMP. To examine the consequences of DIF deprivation, we have isolated several mutant strains that are impaired in DIF accumulation, and whose inability to make stalk cells in vitro and during normal development on agar can be corrected by the addition of exogenous DIF. Little DIF is made by the mutants, and morphological development on agar stops after the cells have aggregated, but before a slug forms. In these DIF-deprived conditions, prespore cells can differentiate, but prestalk cells cannot."
https://openalex.org/W1513604840,"Synthesis of type I procollagen was examined in skin fibroblasts from a proband with a lethal variant of osteogenesis imperfecta. The fibroblasts synthesized shortened pro-alpha 2(I) chains and these shortened chains accounted for all the pro-alpha 2(I) chains synthesized by the cells. In addition, there was a decrease in the relative rate of synthesis of pro-alpha 2(I) chains. Fragmentation of the shortened pro-alpha 2(I) chains with vertebrate collagenase and cyanogen bromide demonstrated that the shortening was in alpha 2(I)-CB3,5A, a fragment from about the middle of the chain containing amino acid residues 361 to 775. Based on the relative mobility in electrophoretic gels, the shortening was about 20 amino acid residues. The decreased synthesis of pro-alpha 2(I) chains was demonstrated by an increase in the ratio for the rates of synthesis of pro-alpha 1(I):pro-alpha 2(I) chains. It was associated with an increase in the ratio of mRNAs for pro-alpha 1(I):pro-alpha 2(I) in the cells. Fibroblasts from the father also demonstrated a decreased synthesis of pro-alpha 2(I) chains as reflected by an increase in the ratio of newly synthesized pro-alpha 1(I):pro-alpha 2(I) chains. No shortened pro-alpha 2(I) chains were seen in fibroblasts from either the father or the mother. The observations suggested that the proband inherited a nonfunctioning pro-alpha 2(I) gene from her father and that the gene for the shortened pro-alpha 2(I) chain probably arose from a sporadic mutation."
https://openalex.org/W1531361307,"Native rat haptoglobin is an heterotetramer consisting of two alpha-subunits (Mr = approximately 9,500) and two glycosylated beta-subunits (Mr = approximately 38,000) joined by interchain disulfide bonds. We previously reported (Haugen, T. H., Hanley, J. M., and Heath, E. C. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 1055-1057) that the synthesis of rat haptoglobin is encoded by a single mRNA, and that the primary in vitro translation product is a single polypeptide, preprohaptoglobin (Mr = approximately 40,000), that contains an NH2-terminal signal sequence as well as an alpha-subunit region and a beta-subunit region. We now report that partial sequence analysis of preprohaptoglobin indicates that the protein possesses an NH2-terminal hydrophobic signal peptide of 18 amino acid residues, followed directly by the alpha-subunit region, with the beta-subunit region located in the carboxyl-terminal portion of the protein. The co-translationally processed translation product consists of a core glycosylated polypeptide, prohaptoglobin (Mr = approximately 45,000), that is devoid of the signal sequence and possesses both the alpha-subunit and beta-subunit regions of haptoglobin. Pulse-chase experiments in cultures of isolated hepatocytes, and analysis of haptoglobin biosynthetic intermediates in the various subcellular organelles of in vivo labeled rat liver indicate that: (a) in the endoplasmic reticulum, core glycosylated prohaptoglobin is dimerized and a portion of the protein is processed to form the individual alpha- and beta-subunits; (b) the carbohydrate side chains of prohaptoglobin and of core glycosylated beta-subunit (Mr = approximately 35,000) are converted to complex, sialylated side chains in the Golgi apparatus, resulting in the formation of fully glycosylated prohaptoglobin (Mr = approximately 48,000) and beta-subunit (Mr = approximately 38,000), and these forms of the protein, as well as the alpha-subunit (Mr = approximately 9,500), are secreted; (c) inhibition of glycosylation with tunicamycin does not significantly affect the rate of synthesis, processing, or secretion of the various haptoglobin polypeptides in isolated hepatocytes; (d) similar experiments conducted in the presence of colchicine also had no effect on the rate of synthesis and processing of the intermediates; and (e) the species of haptoglobin secreted in vivo and from isolated hepatocytes consist of approximately 60-70% in the form of the alpha 2 beta 2 tetramer, and the remainder as dimerized prohaptoglobin. Presumably, secreted prohaptoglobin may be processed to the native subunit structure after secretion, as we demonstrated that incubation of prohaptoglobin with either normal rat serum, rat plasma, or with the sera of other animal species results in its conversion to the corresponding alpha- and beta-subunits of the native protein."
https://openalex.org/W1567864201,"The influence of cations, temperature, and stem length on the supercoil-induced transition from the linear form to the cruciform state at certain inverted repeats of pVH51 and pBR322 was investigated. In general, conditions which stabilize duplex DNA over single-stranded DNA shifted the transition to higher negative superhelical density values due to an increase in the unfavorable free energy of cruciform formation. Specifically, increasing sodium or magnesium ion concentrations brought about a corresponding increase in the negative superhelical density required to cause cruciform formation at the major inverted repeat of both plasmids. A notable exception was the inverted repeat found in both of these plasmids (at position 1009 of pVH51 and 3123 of pBR322) for which Mg(II) concentrations between 1 and 5 mM brought about a lowering of the negative supercoiling required to cause cruciform extrusion at this site, suggesting a specific complex between the cruciform and magnesium. Increasing temperatures from 15 up to 45 degrees C for the pVH51 major inverted repeat and 37 degrees C for that of pBR322 shifted the transition to lower negative superhelical densities. Further increases brought about a shift to higher negative densities. For the two inverted repeats examined within pVH51, various divalent metal ions and spermidine resulted in the following hierarchy: Mn(II) less than Zn(II) less than Mg(II) less than Co(II) less than spermidine, where the transition midpoint was at lowest negative density values for Mn(II) and highest for spermidine. This hierarchy agrees qualitatively with the relative affinity of the cations for DNA-phosphates versus the bases. The influence of stem length on the supercoil-induced transition to the cruciform state was studied by in vitro deletion of portions of the pVH51 major inverted repeat. Decreasing the stem length from 13 to 10 base pairs (bp) had no effect on the ability of this sequence to adopt the cruciform state. However, a further reduction of 3 bp to give a stem length of 7 bp completely abolished the ability of this region of DNA to exist in the cruciform state, at least up to a density of -0.15. Thus, a very sharp dependency on stem length exists for cruciform formation within an inverted repeat region possessing a potential loop of five nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1512440304,"The phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol in subcellular fractions from rat liver has been examined. Fractions enriched in Golgi showed by far the highest specific activity while a plasma membrane fraction depleted in Golgi, as well as rough microsomes, mitochondria, and particle-free supernatant had much lower activity. The product formed from [gamma-32P]ATP and endogenous or exogenously added phosphatidylinositol was predominantly diphosphoinositide with no more than 5% triphosphoinositide. The phosphatidylinositol kinase showed a broad pH optimum with peak activity around pH 7.8. The kinase reaction was not inhibited by the detergent Triton X-100, except at very high concentration, while it was severely inhibited by digitonin. Exogenous phosphatidylinositol did not serve as substrate for the kinase when added in the form of sonicated vesicles, but did so in the presence of Triton. In the latter form it also restored kinase activity after enzymatic depletion of endogenous substrate. The diphosphoinositide formed from endogenous phosphatidylinositol remained fairly stable in the intact membrane, while its degradation was enhanced significantly in the presence of detergent. This study indicates that the phosphatidylinositol kinase in rat liver is highly enriched in the Golgi and suggests that it can be solubilized and assayed by the use of a nonionic detergent."
https://openalex.org/W1561270669,"A form of spontaneous calcium release from purified sarcoplasmic reticulum isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle is described. The conditions utilized for eliciting spontaneous release rely on preloading the vesicles with calcium in the presence of phosphate. Under the conditions of assay, spontaneous release begins only after a time delay following depletion of calcium ions from the extravesicular space. Release rates as high as 10-20 mumol/mg . min have been observed, but only a portion of the calcium accumulated is released. Released calcium is reaccumulated, and successive spontaneous releases of smaller amounts of calcium are observed under some conditions. Release occurs as a consequence primarily of an increase in unidirectional Ca2+ efflux and, secondarily, a decrease in unidirectional Ca2+ influx. Unidirectional efflux is enhanced by calcium preloading, enhanced by low (0.01-0.1 microM) and reduced by moderate (1-10 microM) extravesicular free calcium levels. Spontaneous Ca2+ release is favored by much lower free calcium concentrations than Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. The inhibition of unidirectional efflux by calcium appears to involve active calcium uptake. Release is not mediated by a reversal of the calcium pump. The temperature dependence of the release process is steep, comparable with that of energized Ca2+ uptake. This may reflect a process involved in the gating of a hypothetical calcium channel in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1514158683,"The influence of thyroid hormone on the translational activity of specific cardiac mRNA was determined by in vitro translation of RNA isolated from the heart of normal, hypothyroid, and 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine-injected hypothyroid rats. Proteins synthesized in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and quantitated by a novel scanning procedure using digital matrix photometry. A total of 421 translational products were detected by fluorography and changes in the predominance of 12 of these were influenced by the thyroid state of the animals. The relative predominance of 8 species was increased in euthyroid animals, whereas 4 translational products were increased in hypothyroid animals. The majority of these thyroid hormone-related alterations occurred in spot pairs of similar molecular weights, but slightly different isoelectric points. In contrast, the relative predominance of mRNAs coding for the major contractile proteins, light chain 1, light chain 2, tropomyosin, actin, and myosin heavy chain was not altered by the thyroid status of the animals. The relative levels of these abundant mRNA species remained unaltered in spite of a thyroid hormone-related increase in total RNA levels. In vivo effects of thyroid hormone on cardiac RNA levels are complex. In addition to a general increase in total RNA and mRNA levels, increases or attenuations in the predominance of a small number of specific mRNA species are observed when euthyroid and hypothyroid animals are compared."
https://openalex.org/W1485038793,"Dopamine beta-hydroxylase was present as 2 subunit forms (apparent Mr = 77,000 and 73,000) in the PC12 pheochromocytoma cell line as detected by immunoprecipitation from [35S]methionine-labeled cultures, and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and fluorography. The Mr = 77,000 form was present in a crude membrane fraction, while the Mr = 73,000 form was soluble. Both forms appeared to be present in approximately equal amounts, and both were glycosylated. Treatment of PC12 cells with tunicamycin, a potent inhibitor of core glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum, completely inhibited the appearance of the Mr = 77,000 and Mr = 73,000 forms, and 2 new immunoreactive polypeptides were obtained (apparent Mr = 67,000 and 63,000). Pulse-chase experiments suggested that the Mr = 77,000 form is initially synthesized (by 5 min) and a portion is converted in 15-90 min to the Mr = 73,000 form. Thereafter, the ratio between forms remains relatively constant, at least for several hours. Translation of mRNA from bovine and rat adrenals, and immunoprecipitation, indicated that dopamine beta-hydroxylase is initially synthesized as a single polypeptide (apparent Mr = 67,000). The subcellular site of biosynthesis of dopamine beta-hydroxylase was determined by isolation of mRNA from free and membrane-bound polysomes from bovine adrenal medulla. Translation in a cell free system and immunoprecipitation localized the synthesis of dopamine beta-hydroxylase on membrane-bound polysomes. These experiments suggest that both soluble and membrane-bound forms of dopamine beta-hydroxylase are synthesized and core glycosylated in the endoplasmic reticulum, and that there probably is a precursor-product relationship between the Mr = 77,000 and the Mr = 73,000 subunit forms of dopamine beta-hydroxylase."
https://openalex.org/W1484724766,Dexamethasone treatment of neonatal chicks resulted in a time- and dose-dependent selective decrease of skin collagen synthesis. Total RNA of chick skin was isolated and hybridized to the cloned cDNAs pCg54 for pro-alpha 1 (I) mRNA and pCg45 for pro-alpha 2(I) mRNA. RNA isolated from the total skin of chicks receiving various doses of dexamethasone had dose-related decreases of pro-alpha 1 (I) and pro-alpha 2(I) mRNAs. The decrease of type I procollagen mRNAs for various doses of dexamethasone were similar to the decreases observed for collagen synthesis in vivo. Dexamethasone treatment of chick skin and chick lung fibroblasts resulted in a selective decrease of procollagen synthesis. A dose-related decrease of procollagen synthesis was observed with chick skin fibroblasts. Dexamethasone-treated chick skin and chick lung fibroblasts had decreased levels of pro-alpha 1 (I) and pro-alpha 2(I) mRNAs as determined by solid support hybridization with pCg54 and pCg45. The dexamethasone-mediated decreases of type I procollagen mRNAs in skin fibroblasts and lung fibroblasts were similar to the decreases observed in procollagen synthesis.
https://openalex.org/W2038746556,"Both cholera toxin and heat-labile enterotoxin were made and secreted into culture supernatants by Vibrio cholerae containing the enterotoxin plasmid pCG86. Several regulatory mutations in V. cholerae that increased or decreased the synthesis of cholera toxin did not affect production of heat-labile enterotoxin. In contrast, a mutation in V. cholerae that interfered with the secretion of cholera toxin also decreased the secretion of heat-labile enterotoxin, indicating that they are processed by a common secretory pathway. Vibrio cholerae should be useful as a model system for analyzing the secretion of true extracellular proteins by Gram-negative bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1900952937,"By surveying compounds having isoalloxazine derived from flavins on a high performance liquid chromatogram with fluorescence detection, two new flavin derivatives were found in human urine. These two compounds were purified by partition chromatography on a cellulose column and by paper chromatography with several solvent systems, and their structures were determined to be 7 alpha-hydroxyriboflavin and 8 alpha-hydroxyriboflavin. The relative distributions, measured by high performance liquid chromatography, of 7 alpha- and 8 alpha-hydroxyriboflavin, riboflavin, and hydroxyethylflavin and its derivative were calculated to be 31.1, 5.0, 25.6, 4.9, and 21.9%, respectively, to total flavins in normal human urine obtained in early morning. The excretion of 7 alpha- and 8 alpha-hydroxyriboflavin in human urine indicates the occurrence of a metabolic pathway of the isoalloxazine ring of flavin at its 7 alpha and 8 alpha positions."
https://openalex.org/W1586141058,"Proteoglycans deposited in the basal lamina of [14C] glucosamine-labeled normal and [3H]glucosamine-labeled transformed mouse mammary epithelial cells grown on type I-collagen gels, were extracted in 4 M guanidinium chloride and cofractionated over Sepharose CL 4B. The heparan sulfate chains carried by these proteoglycans were isolated by treatment with alkaline borohydride, protease K, chondroitinase ABC, and cetylpyridinium chloride precipitation. Heparan sulfate isolated from transformed cell cultures consistently eluted from DEAE-cellulose at lower salt concentrations and was of smaller apparent Mr when chromatographed over Sepharose CL 6B, than heparan sulfate of normal cell cultures. Experiments using doubly labeled cultures ([3H]glucosamine and [35S]sulfate) demonstrated an approximately 30% reduction in the sulfate/hexosamine ratio in heparan sulfate derived from transformed cultures. Both N- and O-sulfate were decreased. The decreased Mr and decreased sulfation of heparan sulfate upon transformation appear sufficient to explain the altered heparan sulfate/chondroitin sulfate ratios previously observed in these cells. These changes may have implications for the molecular interactions in which these proteoglycans are normally engaged during basal lamina assembly, and cause the poor basal lamina formation displayed by these transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W1500277662,"In the cultured hepatoma cell HTC, amino acid starvation stimulated both influx and efflux of 2-(methylamino)isobutyric acid (MeAIB) across the plasma membrane with little effect on the ultimate cellular accumulation of this amino acid. In agreement, prior amino acid starvation had little effect on the cellular steady state levels reached for various natural amino acids during subsequent incubation in an amino acid-rich medium containing cycloheximide. Furthermore, efflux of [14C]MeAIB was markedly increased by amino acid starvation. These findings do not mean that adaptive regulation of neutral amino acid transport is pointless. If membrane transport rather than metabolism is the rate-limiting step for net amino acid production or consumption, or becomes so during times of elevated formation or catabolism of an amino acid, then proportionate changes of both the opposed fluxes should enhance its net generation or consumption. Amino acid starvation enhances MeAIB-dependent Na+ influx. Alteration of the external [Na+] changes the Km, not the Vmax, for MeAIB influx when the degree of System A derepression is stabilized with cycloheximide. In both starved and unstarved cells, Km/Vmax for MeAIB entry yields a linear function with the reciprocal of the external [Na+], supporting at least for influx a rapid equilibrium-ordered kinetic model in which Na+ binds to the carrier site before the amino acid. Elevated cellular [Na+] obtained by ouabain treatment increased MeAIB efflux in parallel. Trans-inhibition of MeAIB influx by accumulated MeAIB, and as a related phenomenon by cellular Na+, was as effective in unstarved as in starved cells, showing independence of this kinetic phenomenon from adaptive regulation. The decreased MeAIB accumulation resulting from decreased influx and increased efflux occurring at high internal [Na+] applies both to unstarved and starved cells. We conclude that cellular Na+ accumulations, produced by increasing levels of ouabain, reversibly reduce the ability of MeAIB to repress System A because its interior concentration is prevented from rising, although transport in both directions continues; accordingly, the repressive signal appears to come from the internal amino acid levels rather than from occupation of the carrier site for System A flux."
https://openalex.org/W1550488132,"The hydroperoxide-supported N-demethylation reactions catalyzed by horseradish peroxidase have been characterized in detail. The ethyl hydroperoxide-supported N-demethylation of N,N-dimethylaniline by horseradish peroxidase resulted in the formation of equimolar amounts of N-methylaniline and formaldehyde with no other products detectable by high performance liquid chromatography analysis of the reaction mixture. One molecule of ethyl hydroperoxide was consumed for each molecule of formaldehyde formed in the reaction. Similar results were obtained for the hydrogen peroxide-supported N-demethylation of N,N-dimethylaniline. The horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed N-demethylation reaction could be supported by a variety of hydroperoxides, peroxides, and peracids. The turnover number for the hydrogen peroxide-supported demethylation reaction (7061) was larger than that for the ethyl hydroperoxide-supported reaction (5382) or for chloroperoxidase- or cytochrome P-450-catalyzed dealkylations. The demethylation reaction exhibited normal Michaelis-Menten saturation kinetics with respect to N,N-dimethylaniline (Km = 0.34 mM) and ethyl hydroperoxide (Km = 0.020 mM), as well as hydrogen peroxide (Km = 0.016 mM). The horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed N-demethylation reaction was not significantly inhibited by reagents which react with the superoxide anion, the hydroxyl radical, or singlet oxygen, suggesting that these activated oxygen species are not free intermediates in the reaction. There was no significant inhibition of the reaction by alpha-phenyl-t-butylnitrone, 5,5-dimethylpyrroline-N-oxide, or other free radical trapping agents. Substitution of D2O for H2O resulted in an inhibition of the reaction with a solvent isotope effect (VH2O/VD2O) of 1.6. Horseradish peroxidase did not catalyze the demethylation of N,N-dimethylaniline-N-oxide, indicating that the reaction does not proceed via N-oxidation of the amine. When the concentrations of both N,N-dimethylaniline and ethyl hydroperoxide were varied in a constant ratio a linear double reciprocal plot was obtained, which is consistent with a ping-pong kinetic mechanism for the horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed demethylation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1634908273,"Bovine and lathyritic rat type III collagen preparations were analyzed for the presence and in vitro formation of intermolecular disulfide cross-links. Type III collagen from fetal bovine skin was extracted with the aid of pepsin and purified by differential salt precipitation, guanidine denaturation, and renaturation. Nearly all of the type III collagen was present as reduction-sensitive gamma-components and higher molecular weight aggregates. After cleavage with CNBr, the peptides were analyzed by two-dimensional mapping. The presence of intermolecular disulfide bonds was demonstrated by the existence of a hexamer of the COOH-terminal CNBr peptide, CB9B. This cross-linked peptide was completely converted to the CB9B monomer by reduction. Type III collagen from the skins of beta-aminoproprionitrile-treated rats was used to test for the in vitro formation of intermolecular disulfide cross-links. This was prepared by salt extraction, differential salt precipitation, and pepsin treatment. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis of this partially purified type III collagen before reconstitution into fibers detected primarily gamma-chains. After reconstitution into fibers, the majority of the material was present as higher molecular weight aggregates. Upon reduction, these aggregates generated predominantly alpha-chains. These data demonstrate the existence of intermolecular disulfide bonds in native type III collagen and their formation during in vitro fibrillogenesis."

The essential fatty acids, linoleic (18:2(n - 6)) and linolenic (18:3(n - 3)) acids, were converted to polyunsaturated acids by delta 6 and delta 5 desaturation and chain elongation. The major end products (20:4 from 18:2(n - 6) and 20:5 and 22:5 from 18:3(n - 3)) were preferentially esterified to phospholipids, whereas intermediates were esterified primarily or equally to triacylglycerol. The effects of unlabeled exogenous fatty acids (eg. 40 microM 18:2(n - 6), 18:3(n - 6), 18:3(n - 3), 20:3(n - 6), 20:4(n - 6), trans-18:2(n - 6), 18:1(n - 9), trans-18:1(n - 9), or 16:0) on the conversion of 2 microM [1-(14)C]18:2(n - 6), 18:3(n - 3), 20:3(n - 6), 20:4(n - 6), or 16:0 and on accumulation of products and unaltered substrates in phospholipids and triacylglycerol were examined after incubations of 2-24 h. With [1-(14)C]18:2, formation and esterification of 20:4 to phospholipids was (i) stimulated 4-8-fold by 18:2(n - 6), 20:3(n - 6), or 20:4(n - 6), (ii) inhibited by 18:3(n - 3) or trans-18:2(n - 6), or (iii) unaffected by 18:3(n - 6), 18:1(n - 9), trans-18:1(n - 9), and 16:0. Specific but less marked effects were observed with the other 1-(14)C-substrate acids. Thus, various fatty acids influenced the metabolism of essential fatty acids both at the level of conversion by desaturation and elongation and at esterification to complex lipids by mechanisms specific to individual acids. Product inhibition was not a major feedback mechanism; however, the complement of available fatty acids evidently modulates the acyl chain composition of membrane phospholipids through processes in addition to acyltransferase selectivity. The data support a closely coordinated or concerted enzyme system for directed synthesis of esterified polyunsaturated acyl chains."
https://openalex.org/W2038482224,"We isolated mutants whose vaccinia hemagglutinin (HA) accumulates on nuclear envelopes and the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Mutant HA must be blocked at a pre-Golgi step because it has high-mannose-type carbohydrates but no fucose. Neither N- nor O-glycosidically linked carbohydrates are involved in the transport defect of the mutant HA, because tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-type glycosylation, has no effect, and O-type glycosylation takes place in the Golgi organelle. The unglycosylated form of the mutant HA synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin is 3000 daltons larger than the wild type. This higher molecular weight is related to the transport defect. HAs translated in vitro also show this difference, evidence that it reflects mutation in the HA structural gene. Portions of HAs that project into the cytoplasm seem to account for this weight difference. Thus the cytoplasmic tail of glycoprotein has an important function in transport out of the rough endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1502658743,"The possibility that the large H+ electrochemical potential of chromaffin granules, the secretory granules of adrenal medullary chromaffin cells, plays an important role in exocytosis was investigated in cultures of chromaffin cells from bovine adrenal medulla. Methylamine uptake into the cells, [gamma-31P]phosphate nmr of ATP within intracellular chromaffin granules, O2 consumption of intracellular mitochondria, and MgATP-stimulated catecholamine uptake into chromaffin granules isolated from cultured chromaffin cells were assessed to determine whether various manipulations altered the H+ electrochemical gradients of intracellular chromaffin granules or mitochondria. Catecholamine secretion was not significantly altered by ammonium, methylamine, nigericin, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, or dicyclohexylcarbodiimide under conditions when the pH of intracellular chromaffin granules was reduced or when granular or mitochondrial processes were uncoupled from H+ electrochemical gradients. The data indicate that the H+ electrochemical gradient across the chromaffin granule membrane does not play a role in exocytosis."

https://openalex.org/W1509353528,"We investigated the calf uterine estrogen receptor's interaction with [3H]estriol and [3H]estrone and found that the receptor's cooperative binding is markedly dependent upon temperature and receptor concentration. With increasing temperature, the intensity of the estrogen receptor's cooperativity decreases: at 0 degrees C the Scatchard plot was convex and the Hill coefficient was 1.58 +/- 0.04 (n = 5), while at 30 degrees C the Scatchard plot approached linearity and the Hill coefficient was 1.03 +/- 0.02 (n = 3) for the binding of [3H]estriol with a receptor concentration of 10 to 12 nM. With increasing receptor concentration, the receptor's cooperativity gradually increased. At a receptor concentration of 1 nM, at 25 degrees C, with [3H]estriol the Hill coefficient was low, 1.03 +/- 0.02 (n = 3), while at approximately intracellular receptor concentration (20 nM) the Hill coefficient increased to 1.20 +/- 0.04 (n = 4). Similar results were observed with [3H]estrone. The cooperative interaction of the estrogen receptor with [3H]estriol or [3H]estrone is reversible and dependent upon temperature. The van't Hoff analysis of the apparent dissociation constant of the [3H]estrone- and [3H]estriol-receptor complexes indicates that a transition in the receptor's binding mechanism occurs at 15 degrees C. Therefore, measurements of ligand interactions with the estrogen receptor at 0 to 15 degrees C, may not reflect the binding mechanism of the receptor at more biologically relevant temperatures. The reduced, positively cooperative interactions of [3H]estriol and [3H]estrone with the estrogen receptor at 30 degrees C, in comparison with estradiol, decrease the presence of the activated receptor, which correlates with the partial agonist-antagonist activities of estriol and estrone observed in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1521129684,"Chicken liver P-protein of the multienzyme glycine cleavage system catalyzes the first partial reaction of glycine cleavage. In the partial reaction, glycine and H-protein serve as substrates and the products are CO2 (not bicarbonate) and the decarboxylated portion of glycine attached to H-protein. The reaction exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to both substrates. The optimum pH for the reaction is 7.1, with 6.5 for the reverse reaction. Km values for glycine and H-protein are independent of the concentration of the the co-substrate, and calculated values are 5.8 mM for glycine and 3.4 microM for H-protein. Initial velocity experiments gave intersecting double reciprocal plots that conform to a sequential mechanism. Product inhibition studies revealed that both products inhibited competitively with respect to the varied substrate. Glycine methyl ester was found to be a competitive inhibitor of glycine and noncompetitive inhibitor of H-protein. H-protein whose lipoic acid prosthetic group and cysteinyl residues were modified with N-ethylmaleimide was a noncompetitive inhibitor of glycine and a competitive inhibitor of H-protein. These results are most consistent with a sequential random Bi Bi mechanism in which no abortive dead end complex is formed. This was supported by an isotope exchange experiment."
https://openalex.org/W1514633385,"The effects of pH and ionic strength on the steady state kinetic parameters for reduction of electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) by general acyl-CoA dehydrogenase were determined. The effect of pH on the turnover number (TN) of the reaction indicates the participation of an essential base with a pK alpha of 6.9. The KmETF of the dehydrogenase is invariant between pH 5.4 and 8.5, but increases 40-fold between pH 8.5 and 9.8. The parameter TN/KmETF follows the limiting Bronsted equation (In TN/KmETF = ln ko + 2.34ZAZB I 1/2) at ionic strength values between 0.01 and 0.125 M, indicating complementary charge interactions between the two flavoproteins. Covalent modifications of amino groups of ETF with trinitrobenzene sulfonate and acetic anhydride remove positive charges and result in an increase in KmETF of the dehydrogenase with no change of TN. However, exhaustive acetimidation of ETF amino groups, which maintains cationic charge at modified loci, does not alter the steady state kinetic parameters of the reaction. These results, in conjunction with previous chemical covalent modifications of dehydrogenase carboxyl residues (Frerman, F. E., Mielke, D., and Huhta, K. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 2199-2202), indicate that general acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and ETF interact in an electrostatic manner."
https://openalex.org/W1557501159,"Abstract The physical properties of two types of androgen-binding sites in prostatic nuclei were compared and found to be identical. The first type was released from chromatin by micrococcal nuclease digestion and solution in 0.6 M NaCl; the second resisted such treatment and remained associated with nuclear structures. After in vivo administration of [1,2-3H]testosterone to 24-h castrated rats and sonication of purified nuclei, 90% of the nuclear radioactivity was extracted with nuclease/salt treatment and was found by sucrose density gradient analysis to be associated with a 3 S androgen receptor. If sonication was omitted, 50 to 60% of the nuclear radioactivity was recovered in the nuclease/salt-resistant pellets or bound to nuclear matrices. Mild digestion of either of these particulate fractions with trypsin resulted in the release of a 3 S androgen receptor. After in vitro isotope-exchange labeling with [1,2-3H]dihydrotestosterone, the sedimentation coefficient, steroid specificity, and dissociation constant of the androgen receptors released by trypsin digestion of nuclease/salt-resistant pellets or nuclear matrices were similar to those of the receptors extracted by nuclease/salt treatment. These results indicate first, that all androgen-binding sites in prostatic nuclei can be released, either with nuclease/salt or trypsin digestion procedures to yield a 3 S androgen receptor with uniform binding characteristics, and second, that the androgen receptors are distributed between two intra-nuclear pools--one containing about 10,000 molecules/nucleus sensitive to micrococcal nuclease digestion and salt and the other containing about 8,000 to 13,000 androgen receptors tightly bound to the nuclear matrix."

That both halves of the mirror-symmetric map were derived from only one animal, and from only one side of the head, rules out global markers such as right versus left and histocompatibility differences as causing the formation of these stripes."

Chem. 257, 11540-11545) provides a sensitive method for probing the binding of partial agonists to the estrogen receptor. We studied the effects of estriol and estrone on the positive cooperativity of [3H]estradiol binding to the partially purified, calf uterine estrogen receptor. The receptor was titrated with variable concentrations of [3H]estradiol in combination with estriol or estrone, while maintaining a constant molar ratio of the estriol or estrone to the [3H]estradiol. With either a 4-fold molar excess of estriol or a 25-fold molar excess of estrone above the [3H]estradiol concentrations, the receptor's positive cooperative [3H]estradiol binding was inhibited. The Scatchard plot showed a transition from a convex to a linear curve and a decrease in the Hill coefficient value from 1.61 +/- 0.02 (n = 7) in the absence of estriol or estrone to 1.04 +/- 0.04 (n = 4) in the presence of estriol and 0.99 +/- 0.03 (n = 4) in the presence of estrone. The inhibition of the positive cooperativity of [3H]estradiol binding by estriol or estrone was shown not to be due to isotope dilution of the specifically bound [3H]estradiol by the unlabeled estriol or estrone. These kinetic analyses demonstrate that the positively cooperative equilibrium binding of [3H]estradiol by the receptor, which is characteristic of the receptor's activation process, is eliminated by estriol and estrone and consistent with their partial agonist-antagonist activities observed in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1681135019,"Purified human C9 spontaneously polymerizes upon prolonged incubation at 37 degrees C, and a fraction of these C9 polymers becomes resistant to dissociation by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and reducing agents. We examined possible mechanisms for this spontaneous covalent linking of C9. The following results are consistent with the conclusion that the formation of the covalently linked C9 polymer involves disulfide linking. 1) In addition to the SDS/dithiothreitol (DTT)-resistant C9 polymer (Mr = 950,000), disulfide-linked C9 dimers and trimers were formed upon incubation of C9 at 37 degrees C for 64 h. 2) The C9 polymer formed upon incubation at 37 degrees C for 64 h was resistant to dissociation by 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, 20 mM DTT but was dissociated by 6 M guanidine thiocyanate alone, yielding disulfide-linked C9 oligomers. 3) The formation of the SDS/DTT-resistant C9 polymer was completely inhibited by 1 mM iodoacetamide and 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), while DTNB enhanced the formation of disulfide-linked C9 oligomers. 4) A significant amount of free sulfhydryl group was detected in the polymerized C9 samples with various SH-specific reagents, though native C9 reacted with none of these reagents. In addition, inhibition by 1 mM iodoacetamide of C9 disulfide linking inhibited the self-association of C9 as analyzed by gel filtration on TSK-G4000 SW, whereas enhancement by 1mM DTNB of C9 disulfide linking enhanced C9 self-association. Thus, these results indicate that C9 disulfide linking that occurs upon C9 polymerization is an intrinsic property of C9 which is of importance in the formation of the stable C9 polymer structure."

As a first step in examining this enzyme's biogenesis, we have investigated in vitro the cell-free, rat liver RNA-directed synthesis of the beta subunit, and its post-translational transport and processing by rat liver mitochondria. The beta subunit is synthesized as a precursor approximately 7,500 daltons larger than its mature mitochondrial counterpart. The extension segment, comprising approximately 60 amino acids, is located at the NH2 terminus of the precursor. Intact mitochondria translocate the precursor across both mitochondrial membranes, and a protease localized to the mitochondrial matrix cleaves the precursor to a polypeptide identical in size and peptide composition to the mature beta subunit."

This allows us to estimate the apparent free energy changes for a process between any two of these four conformations."
https://openalex.org/W1513302813,"Experiments were performed to determine the internal pH and membrane potential of platelet alpha-granules. Fluorescence microscopy showed accumulation of weak bases, indicative of an acidic interior, inside secretory vesicles in intact platelets and in isolated alpha-granules. Weak base uptake was pH-dependent and NH+4-sensitive. In isolated alpha-granules suspended in medium buffered at pH 7.2, a delta pH, the difference between internal and external pH, of 1.2 (inside acidic) was measured by [14C]methylamine distribution. Uptake of isotopic or fluorescent amines was reduced by H+/cation exchange via ionophores and by addition of NH+4, but also by increasing the ionic strength suggesting that delta pH is partly due to a Donnan potential. Transmembrane potential measurements by fluorescent or radioactive ion distribution indicated that in the absence of ATP, granules are internally negative. When measured with 86Rb+, this potential could be entirely collapsed by increasing the ionic strength. Addition of ATP X Mg in the absence of permeating anions made the intragranular space more positive, as expected from inward electrogenic H+ pumping. The results are compatible with the coexistence of sealed and leaky subpopulations of alpha-granules. Internal acidity was generated in sealed granules in vivo by a H+-pumping ATPase, whereas in leaky granules acidity is a consequence of an internally negative Donnan potential."
https://openalex.org/W2129327844,"Rat liver S-adenosylhomocysteinase (EC 3.3.1.1) is inactivated by phenylglyoxal following pseudo-first order kinetics. The dependence of the apparent first order rate constant for inactivation on the phenylglyoxal concentration shows that the inactivation is second order in reagent. This fact together with the reversibility of inactivation upon removal of excess reagent and the lack of reaction at residues other than arginine as revealed by amino acid analysis and incorporation of phenylglyoxal into the protein indicate that the inactivation is due to the modification of arginine residue. The substrate adenosine largely but not completely protects the enzyme against inactivation. Although the modification of two arginine residues/subunit is required for complete inactivation, the relationship between loss of enzyme activity and the number of arginine residues modified, and the comparison of the numbers of phenylglyoxal incorporated into the enzyme in the presence and absence of adenosine indicate that one residue which reacts very rapidly with the reagent compared with the other is critical for activity. Although the phenylglyoxal treatment does not result in alteration of the molecular size of the enzyme or dissociation of the bound NAD+, the intrinsic protein fluorescence is largely lost upon modification. The equilibrium binding study shows that the modified enzyme apparently fails to bind adenosine."

Chemical modification of bovine heart submitochondrial particles with the cleavable bifunctional cross-linking reagent, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate), resulted in the formation of three dimeric cross-link isomers of the enzyme, identified by immunoautoradiography, that are characteristic of cross-linked purified transhydrogenase. A limited amount of cross-linking of transhydrogenase monomer to Mr = 25,000 polypeptide was also observed. At high concentration of the cross-linker, a small amount of a higher molecular weight species was formed with both purified and membrane enzyme. Reductive cleavage of the dimeric and higher molecular weight species resulted in the regeneration of transhydrogenase monomer and several other proteolytically derived fragments. It is concluded that transhydrogenase exists in the native membrane primarily as a dimeric species."
https://openalex.org/W1541621206,"A plasma membrane-associated serine esterase (protease) has previously been reported to be required during stimulation of a variety of cell types. In this study we have examined the role of such a protease on membrane potential changes using an optical probe of membrane potential 3,3'-dipropylthiodicarbocyanine iodide. The irreversible chymotrypsin-like protease inhibitor TPCK (tosyl-L-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone) inhibited membrane potential changes in rat neutrophils in response to phorbol myristate acetate, N-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine and the calcium ionophore A23187 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. This inhibition was correlated with the known inhibitory effects on superoxide (O-2) generation and enzyme release (lysozyme and beta-glucuronidase). High external calcium concentrations overcame the inhibitory effects of TPCK on A23187-induced stimulation but had no effect on the inhibition of N-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine stimulation. These results suggest that a TPCK-inhibitable activity is required for the development of the membrane potential changes that are coupled to subsequent secretory events and precede a calcium requiring activity."
https://openalex.org/W1584821183,"A concanavalin A (ConA) derivative of a monovalent monomeric nature, including a monomeric molecular weight at pH 7.4, significantly induces lymphocyte blastoid transformation. The derivative was recently obtained by Tanaka, I., Abe, Y., Hamada, T., Yonemitsu, O., and Ishii, S. ((1981) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 89, 1643-1646) by a novel procedure of photochemically induced alkylation of tryptophan residues of native tetravalent ConA using a high pressure mercury lamp in the presence of chloroacetamide followed by two steps of column chromatography. This monovalent monomeric ConA (Mm-ConA) was demonstrated to be almost equally potent in producing the maximal response of lymphocytes when compared with native tetrameric ConA, although Mm-ConA was required at about 70 times as high as the concentration of native ConA on a weight basis to attain the maximal response of lymphocyte activation. The binding potency of the former to lymphocytes was about two-thirds as potent as that of the latter. Mm-ConA failed to agglutinate sheep erythrocytes at concentrations 1800-fold higher than native tetravalent ConA, but showed a weak but definite agglutinating activity against guinea pig erythrocytes at a relatively high concentration (approximately 80 micrograms/ml). Cell cluster formation was observed in lymphocyte cultures for 24 to 48 h with Mm-ConA where DNA replication in stimulated lymphocytes was observable. No significant difference was observed between sizes of cell clusters formed in the presence of Mm-ConA and of native tetravalent ConA at this phase of lymphocyte activation. The present results suggest that the multivalency of ConA with respect to sugar-binding sites may not be a stringent requirement for lymphocyte activation, and that another binding site for cell membrane, which has been suggested to exist in the ConA protomer and to be hydrophobic (membranophilic), may play a subsidiary but important role in triggering lymphocyte blastoid transformation as well as hemagglutination with Mm-ConA. The biological significance in lymphocyte activation of lectin valency with respect to sugar-binding sites has been discussed, comparing the effects of various ConA derivatives of different valencies, including a monovalent monomer (Mm-ConA), divalent dimers (beta-ConA, sulfomethylamino-ConA, and succinylated ConA), and tetravalent tetramers (alpha-ConA), on the cell surface."

https://openalex.org/W1538241808,"We have isolated mutants defective in the regulation of leucine transport by selecting temperature-resistant revertants from the CHO-tsH1 strain, a temperature-sensitive leucyl-tRNA synthetase mutant of the Chinese hamster ovary cell line. In each revertant, there is a stable 2- to 3-fold enhancement in the activity of transport System L, which serves for the uptake of branched-chain amino acids. This increased transport is reflected by an increase in the Vmax for System L transport without a significant change in the Km value and results in increased intracellular pools of leucine. The thermal stability of the leucyl-tRNA synthetase activity in each of these revertants is not changed significantly from that of the starting strain, CHO-tsH1. We conclude from these studies that the temperature resistance in the revertants arises from alterations in the regulation of transport System L, leading to constitutively high System L transport and increased intracellular pools of leucine, complementing the leucyl-tRNA synthetase defect."
https://openalex.org/W1481189498,"Abstract The ATP analog 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine (FSBA) has been used to study the interaction of MgATP with rat liver carbamyl phosphate synthetase I. Incubation of the enzyme with concentrations of FSBA as low as 0.025 mM produced considerable inactivation (41% at 120 min); identical rates and extents of reaction were produced by 0.5, 1, and 2 mM FSBA. Of the substrates for carbamyl phosphate synthetase I, only MgATP protected against FSBA inactivation. In the presence of a constant concentration of MgATP, increasing the FSBA concentration led to increased inhibition. Conversely, an increase in MgATP concentration led to decreased inhibition from a constant concentration of FSBA. Other nucleotide triphosphates provided no protection against FSBA inactivation. Addition of dithiothreitol to the FSBA-inactivated enzyme led to partial reactivation, suggesting that cysteine residue(s) were involved in the FSBA reaction. 5,5'-Dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) titration of the free sulfhydryl groups on the enzyme confirmed that cysteine residues were involved in reaction with FSBA; titration of the enzyme after incubation in the absence and presence of FSBA yielded values of 21 and 18(+/- 1), respectively. Binding studies with 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl[2-3H]adenosine indicated that: 4 amino acid residues were involved in reaction with FSBA; 2 of these reaction sites were cysteine residues and 2 were noncysteine residues; MgATP protected one of the cysteine residues and one of the noncysteine residues from reaction with FSBA; the MgATP-protected noncysteine residue is essential for fully activity. These data strongly suggest that FSBA is an affinity label for two distinct MgATP sites on carbamyl phosphate synthetase I."

The native enzyme was of the alpha 2-type with a Mr = 120,000 estimated by gel filtration. Its subunits were Mr = 53,000 as determined using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. The enzyme had an isoelectric point of pH 5.4 and pH optimum that varied from pH 7.3 to 8.8 depending on the type of buffer present. The variation in pH optimum was related to a salt effect. All salts tested were inhibitory, with the degree of inhibition dependent on the anion present. Inorganic pyrophosphate was a particularly powerful inhibitor; Km values for aspartate and tRNAAsp were significantly reduced in the presence of inorganic pyrophosphatase. Evidence is presented that the allotropism of the low molecular weight forms is not due to phosphorylation, proteolytic degradation, or stable enzyme-substrate complexes."

This process is independent of pH over the range 4.7-8.8. Examination of vesicles from ion flux mutants showed this slow process to be unrelated to halorhodopsin content and to derive from another photoreactive retinal pigment, possibly the recently described slow cycling pigment s-rhodopsin."
