https://openalex.org/W3121008609,"Understanding immune memory to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is critical for improving diagnostics and vaccines and for assessing the likely future course of the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed multiple compartments of circulating immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 in 254 samples from 188 COVID-19 cases, including 43 samples at ≥6 months after infection. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) to the spike protein was relatively stable over 6+ months. Spike-specific memory B cells were more abundant at 6 months than at 1 month after symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells declined with a half-life of 3 to 5 months. By studying antibody, memory B cell, CD4+ T cell, and CD8+ T cell memory to SARS-CoV-2 in an integrated manner, we observed that each component of SARS-CoV-2 immune memory exhibited distinct kinetics."
https://openalex.org/W3120165331,"With the proliferation of ultrahigh-speed mobile networks and internet-connected devices, along with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI)1, the world is generating exponentially increasing amounts of data that need to be processed in a fast and efficient way. Highly parallelized, fast and scalable hardware is therefore becoming progressively more important2. Here we demonstrate a computationally specific integrated photonic hardware accelerator (tensor core) that is capable of operating at speeds of trillions of multiply-accumulate operations per second (1012 MAC operations per second or tera-MACs per second). The tensor core can be considered as the optical analogue of an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). It achieves parallelized photonic in-memory computing using phase-change-material memory arrays and photonic chip-based optical frequency combs (soliton microcombs3). The computation is reduced to measuring the optical transmission of reconfigurable and non-resonant passive components and can operate at a bandwidth exceeding 14 gigahertz, limited only by the speed of the modulators and photodetectors. Given recent advances in hybrid integration of soliton microcombs at microwave line rates3-5, ultralow-loss silicon nitride waveguides6,7, and high-speed on-chip detectors and modulators, our approach provides a path towards full complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) wafer-scale integration of the photonic tensor core. Although we focus on convolutional processing, more generally our results indicate the potential of integrated photonics for parallel, fast, and efficient computational hardware in data-heavy AI applications such as autonomous driving, live video processing, and next-generation cloud computing services."
https://openalex.org/W3118265437,"Convolutional neural networks, inspired by biological visual cortex systems, are a powerful category of artificial neural networks that can extract the hierarchical features of raw data to provide greatly reduced parametric complexity and to enhance the accuracy of prediction. They are of great interest for machine learning tasks such as computer vision, speech recognition, playing board games and medical diagnosis1–7. Optical neural networks offer the promise of dramatically accelerating computing speed using the broad optical bandwidths available. Here we demonstrate a universal optical vector convolutional accelerator operating at more than ten TOPS (trillions (1012) of operations per second, or tera-ops per second), generating convolutions of images with 250,000 pixels—sufficiently large for facial image recognition. We use the same hardware to sequentially form an optical convolutional neural network with ten output neurons, achieving successful recognition of handwritten digit images at 88 per cent accuracy. Our results are based on simultaneously interleaving temporal, wavelength and spatial dimensions enabled by an integrated microcomb source. This approach is scalable and trainable to much more complex networks for demanding applications such as autonomous vehicles and real-time video recognition. An optical vector convolutional accelerator operating at more than ten trillion operations per second is used to create an optical convolutional neural network that can successfully recognize handwritten digit images with 88 per cent accuracy."

https://openalex.org/W3119813698,"Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS or progeria) is typically caused by a dominant-negative C•G-to-T•A mutation (c.1824 C>T; p.G608G) in LMNA, the gene that encodes nuclear lamin A. This mutation causes RNA mis-splicing that produces progerin, a toxic protein that induces rapid ageing and shortens the lifespan of children with progeria to approximately 14 years1–4. Adenine base editors (ABEs) convert targeted A•T base pairs to G•C base pairs with minimal by-products and without requiring double-strand DNA breaks or donor DNA templates5,6. Here we describe the use of an ABE to directly correct the pathogenic HGPS mutation in cultured fibroblasts derived from children with progeria and in a mouse model of HGPS. Lentiviral delivery of the ABE to fibroblasts from children with HGPS resulted in 87–91% correction of the pathogenic allele, mitigation of RNA mis-splicing, reduced levels of progerin and correction of nuclear abnormalities. Unbiased off-target DNA and RNA editing analysis did not detect off-target editing in treated patient-derived fibroblasts. In transgenic mice that are homozygous for the human LMNA c.1824 C>T allele, a single retro-orbital injection of adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) encoding the ABE resulted in substantial, durable correction of the pathogenic mutation (around 20–60% across various organs six months after injection), restoration of normal RNA splicing and reduction of progerin protein levels. In vivo base editing rescued the vascular pathology of the mice, preserving vascular smooth muscle cell counts and preventing adventitial fibrosis. A single injection of ABE-expressing AAV9 at postnatal day 14 improved vitality and greatly extended the median lifespan of the mice from 215 to 510 days. These findings demonstrate the potential of in vivo base editing as a possible treatment for HGPS and other genetic diseases by directly correcting their root cause. In a mouse model of progeria, an adenine base editor delivered with adeno-associated virus corrects the pathogenic mutation in LMNA, rescues vascular pathology and markedly extends the lifespan of the mice."

Here, we link single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to characterize intestinal morphogenesis through time. We identify 101 cell states including epithelial and mesenchymal progenitor populations and programs linked to key morphogenetic milestones. We describe principles of crypt-villus axis formation; neural, vascular, mesenchymal morphogenesis, and immune population of the developing gut. We identify the differentiation hierarchies of developing fibroblast and myofibroblast subtypes and describe diverse functions for these including as vascular niche cells. We pinpoint the origins of Peyer's patches and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and describe location-specific immune programs. We use our resource to present an unbiased analysis of morphogen gradients that direct sequential waves of cellular differentiation and define cells and locations linked to rare developmental intestinal disorders. We compile a publicly available online resource, spatio-temporal analysis resource of fetal intestinal development (STAR-FINDer), to facilitate further work."

https://openalex.org/W3119697748,"Structurally disordered materials pose fundamental questions1-4, including how different disordered phases ('polyamorphs') can coexist and transform from one phase to another5-9. Amorphous silicon has been extensively studied; it forms a fourfold-coordinated, covalent network at ambient conditions and much-higher-coordinated, metallic phases under pressure10-12. However, a detailed mechanistic understanding of the structural transitions in disordered silicon has been lacking, owing to the intrinsic limitations of even the most advanced experimental and computational techniques, for example, in terms of the system sizes accessible via simulation. Here we show how atomistic machine learning models trained on accurate quantum mechanical computations can help to describe liquid-amorphous and amorphous-amorphous transitions for a system of 100,000 atoms (ten-nanometre length scale), predicting structure, stability and electronic properties. Our simulations reveal a three-step transformation sequence for amorphous silicon under increasing external pressure. First, polyamorphic low- and high-density amorphous regions are found to coexist, rather than appearing sequentially. Then, we observe a structural collapse into a distinct very-high-density amorphous (VHDA) phase. Finally, our simulations indicate the transient nature of this VHDA phase: it rapidly nucleates crystallites, ultimately leading to the formation of a polycrystalline structure, consistent with experiments13-15 but not seen in earlier simulations11,16-18. A machine learning model for the electronic density of states confirms the onset of metallicity during VHDA formation and the subsequent crystallization. These results shed light on the liquid and amorphous states of silicon, and, in a wider context, they exemplify a machine learning-driven approach to predictive materials modelling."
https://openalex.org/W3118771939,"Astrocytes are glial cells that are abundant in the central nervous system (CNS) and that have important homeostatic and disease-promoting functions1. However, little is known about the homeostatic anti-inflammatory activities of astrocytes and their regulation. Here, using high-throughput flow cytometry screening, single-cell RNA sequencing and CRISPR–Cas9-based cell-specific in vivo genetic perturbations in mice, we identify a subset of astrocytes that expresses the lysosomal protein LAMP12 and the death receptor ligand TRAIL3. LAMP1+TRAIL+ astrocytes limit inflammation in the CNS by inducing T cell apoptosis through TRAIL–DR5 signalling. In homeostatic conditions, the expression of TRAIL in astrocytes is driven by interferon-γ (IFNγ) produced by meningeal natural killer (NK) cells, in which IFNγ expression is modulated by the gut microbiome. TRAIL expression in astrocytes is repressed by molecules produced by T cells and microglia in the context of inflammation. Altogether, we show that LAMP1+TRAIL+ astrocytes limit CNS inflammation by inducing T cell apoptosis, and that this astrocyte subset is maintained by meningeal IFNγ+ NK cells that are licensed by the microbiome. A subpopulation of astrocytes characterized by the expression of LAMP1 and TRAIL limits inflammation in the central nervous system through a mechanism involving the microbiota-modulated expression of IFNγ in meningeal natural killer cells."

https://openalex.org/W3121063139,"Regeneration is a complex chain of events that restores a tissue to its original size and shape. The tissue-wide coordination of cellular dynamics that is needed for proper morphogenesis is challenged by the large dimensions of regenerating body parts. Feedback mechanisms in biochemical pathways can provide effective communication across great distances1-5, but how they might regulate growth during tissue regeneration is unresolved6,7. Here we report that rhythmic travelling waves of Erk activity control the growth of bone in time and space in regenerating zebrafish scales, millimetre-sized discs of protective body armour. We find that waves of Erk activity travel across the osteoblast population as expanding concentric rings that are broadcast from a central source, inducing ring-like patterns of tissue growth. Using a combination of theoretical and experimental analyses, we show that Erk activity propagates as excitable trigger waves that are able to traverse the entire scale in approximately two days and that the frequency of wave generation controls the rate of scale regeneration. Furthermore, the periodic induction of synchronous, tissue-wide activation of Erk in place of travelling waves impairs tissue growth, which indicates that wave-distributed Erk activation is key to regeneration. Our findings reveal trigger waves as a regulatory strategy to coordinate cell behaviour and instruct tissue form during regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3120270773,"Adhesion G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a major family of GPCRs, but limited knowledge of their ligand regulation or structure is available1–3. Here we report that glucocorticoid stress hormones activate adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor G3 (ADGRG3; also known as GPR97)4–6, a prototypical adhesion GPCR. The cryo-electron microscopy structures of GPR97–Go complexes bound to the anti-inflammatory drug beclomethasone or the steroid hormone cortisol revealed that glucocorticoids bind to a pocket within the transmembrane domain. The steroidal core of glucocorticoids is packed against the ‘toggle switch’ residue W6.53, which senses the binding of a ligand and induces activation of the receptor. Active GPR97 uses a quaternary core and HLY motif to fasten the seven-transmembrane bundle and to mediate G protein coupling. The cytoplasmic side of GPR97 has an open cavity, where all three intracellular loops interact with the Go protein, contributing to the high basal activity of GRP97. Palmitoylation at the cytosolic tail of the Go protein was found to be essential for efficient engagement with GPR97 but is not observed in other solved GPCR complex structures. Our work provides a structural basis for ligand binding to the seven-transmembrane domain of an adhesion GPCR and subsequent G protein coupling. The authors report on the structure of a glucocorticoid-bound adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor–G protein complex."
https://openalex.org/W3120712987,"Ordered two-dimensional arrays such as S-layers1,2 and designed analogues3-5 have intrigued bioengineers6,7, but with the exception of a single lattice formed with flexible linkers8, they are constituted from just one protein component. Materials composed of two components have considerable potential advantages for modulating assembly dynamics and incorporating more complex functionality9-12. Here we describe a computational method to generate co-assembling binary layers by designing rigid interfaces between pairs of dihedral protein building blocks, and use it to design a p6m lattice. The designed array components are soluble at millimolar concentrations, but when combined at nanomolar concentrations, they rapidly assemble into nearly crystalline micrometre-scale arrays nearly identical to the computational design model in vitro and in cells without the need for a two-dimensional support. Because the material is designed from the ground up, the components can be readily functionalized and their symmetry reconfigured, enabling formation of ligand arrays with distinguishable surfaces, which we demonstrate can drive extensive receptor clustering, downstream protein recruitment and signalling. Using atomic force microscopy on supported bilayers and quantitative microscopy on living cells, we show that arrays assembled on membranes have component stoichiometry and structure similar to arrays formed in vitro, and that our material can therefore impose order onto fundamentally disordered substrates such as cell membranes. In contrast to previously characterized cell surface receptor binding assemblies such as antibodies and nanocages, which are rapidly endocytosed, we find that large arrays assembled at the cell surface suppress endocytosis in a tunable manner, with potential therapeutic relevance for extending receptor engagement and immune evasion. Our work provides a foundation for a synthetic cell biology in which multi-protein macroscale materials are designed to modulate cell responses and reshape synthetic and living systems."
https://openalex.org/W3120532189,"Abstract Egg-laying mammals (monotremes) are the only extant mammalian outgroup to therians (marsupial and eutherian animals) and provide key insights into mammalian evolution 1,2 . Here we generate and analyse reference genomes of the platypus ( Ornithorhynchus anatinus ) and echidna ( Tachyglossus aculeatus ), which represent the only two extant monotreme lineages. The nearly complete platypus genome assembly has anchored almost the entire genome onto chromosomes, markedly improving the genome continuity and gene annotation. Together with our echidna sequence, the genomes of the two species allow us to detect the ancestral and lineage-specific genomic changes that shape both monotreme and mammalian evolution. We provide evidence that the monotreme sex chromosome complex originated from an ancestral chromosome ring configuration. The formation of such a unique chromosome complex may have been facilitated by the unusually extensive interactions between the multi-X and multi-Y chromosomes that are shared by the autosomal homologues in humans. Further comparative genomic analyses unravel marked differences between monotremes and therians in haptoglobin genes, lactation genes and chemosensory receptor genes for smell and taste that underlie the ecological adaptation of monotremes."

https://openalex.org/W3121047187,"The brainstem is a key centre in the control of body movements. Although the precise nature of brainstem cell types and circuits that are central to full-body locomotion are becoming known1-5, efforts to understand the neuronal underpinnings of skilled forelimb movements have focused predominantly on supra-brainstem centres and the spinal cord6-12. Here we define the logic of a functional map for skilled forelimb movements within the lateral rostral medulla (latRM) of the brainstem. Using in vivo electrophysiology in freely moving mice, we reveal a neuronal code with tuning of latRM populations to distinct forelimb actions. These include reaching and food handling, both of which are impaired by perturbation of excitatory latRM neurons. Through the combinatorial use of genetics and viral tracing, we demonstrate that excitatory latRM neurons segregate into distinct populations by axonal target, and act through the differential recruitment of intra-brainstem and spinal circuits. Investigating the behavioural potential of projection-stratified latRM populations, we find that the optogenetic stimulation of these populations can elicit diverse forelimb movements, with each behaviour stably expressed by individual mice. In summary, projection-stratified brainstem populations encode action phases and together serve as putative building blocks for regulating key features of complex forelimb movements, identifying substrates of the brainstem for skilled forelimb behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W3103693710,"Neural mechanisms that mediate the ability to make value-guided decisions have received substantial attention in humans and animals1–6. Experiments in animals typically involve long training periods. By contrast, choices in the real world often need to be made between new options spontaneously. It is therefore possible that the neural mechanisms targeted in animal studies differ from those required for new decisions, which are typical of human imaging studies. Here we show that the primate medial frontal cortex (MFC)7 is involved in making new inferential choices when the options have not been previously experienced. Macaques spontaneously inferred the values of new options via similarities with the component parts of previously encountered options. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) suggested that this ability was mediated by the MFC, which is rarely investigated in monkeys3; MFC activity reflected different processes of comparison for unfamiliar and familiar options. Multidimensional representations of options in the MFC used a coding scheme resembling that of grid cells, which is well known in spatial navigation8,9, to integrate dimensions in this non-physical space10 during novel decision-making. By contrast, the orbitofrontal cortex held specific object-based value representations1,11. In addition, minimally invasive ultrasonic disruption12 of MFC, but not adjacent tissue, altered the estimation of novel choice values. The primate medial frontal cortex has a key role in mediating the ability to choose between new options based on little or no direct experience."
https://openalex.org/W3118558786,"Spontaneous fluctuations in cortical excitability influence sensory processing and behavior. These fluctuations, long thought to reflect global changes in cortical state, were recently found to be modulated locally within a retinotopic map during spatially selective attention. We report that periods of vigorous (On) and faint (Off) spiking activity, the signature of cortical state fluctuations, are coordinated across brain areas with retinotopic precision. Top-down attention enhanced interareal local state coordination, traversing along the reverse cortical hierarchy. The extent of local state coordination between areas was predictive of behavioral performance. Our results show that cortical state dynamics are shared across brain regions, modulated by cognitive demands and relevant for behavior."

https://openalex.org/W3042064545,"It was recently shown that quantum annealing can be used as an effective, fast subroutine in certain types of matrix factorization algorithms. The quantum annealing algorithm performed best for quick, approximate answers, but performance rapidly plateaued. In this paper, we utilize reverse annealing instead of forward annealing in the quantum annealing subroutine for nonnegative/binary matrix factorization problems. After an initial global search with forward annealing, reverse annealing performs a series of local searches that refine existing solutions. The combination of forward and reverse annealing significantly improves performance compared to forward annealing alone for all but the shortest run times."
https://openalex.org/W3119133656,"Introduction The rapid and accurate diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) is important to reduce morbidity and mortality rates and risk of transmission. Therefore, molecular detection methods such as a real-time PCR–based assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) have been commonly used for diagnosis of TB. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was believed to be a simple, quick, and cost-effective isothermal nucleic acid amplification diagnostic test for infectious diseases. In this study, we designed an in-house multiplex LAMP assay for the differential detection of MTB and non-tuberculosis mycobacterium (NTM), and evaluated the assay using clinical samples. Material and methods For the multiplex LAMP assay, two sets of specific primers were designed: the first one was specific for IS6110 genes of MTB, and the second one was universal for rpoB genes of mycobacterium species including NTM. MTB was confirmed with a positive reaction with both primer sets, and NTM was identified with a positive reaction by only the second primer set without a MTB-specific reaction. Total 333 clinical samples were analyzed to evaluate the multiplex LAMP assay. Clinical samples were composed of 195 positive samples (72 MTB and 123NTM) and 138 negative samples. All samples were confirmed positivity or negativity by real-time PCR for MTB and NTM. Analytical sensitivity and specificity were evaluated for the multiplex LAMP assay in comparison with acid fast bacilli staining and the culture method. Results Of 123 NTM samples, 121 were identified as NTM and 72/72 MTB were identified as MTB by the multiplex LAMP assay. False negative reactions were seen only in two NTM positive samples with co-infection of Candida spp. All 138 negative samples were identified as negative for MTB and NTM. Analytical sensitivity of the multiplex LAMP assay was 100% (72/72) for MTB, and 98.4% (121/123) for NTM. And the specificity of assay was 100% (138/138) for all. Conclusions Our newly designed multiplex LAMP assay for MTB and NTM showed relatively good sensitivity in comparison with previously published data to detect isolated MTB. This multiplex LAMP assay is expected to become a useful tool for detecting and differentiating MTB from NTM rapidly at an acceptable sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W3120650989,"Background Burnout has adverse implications in healthcare settings, compromising patient care. Allied health professionals (AHPs) are defined as individuals who work collaboratively to deliver routine and essential healthcare services, excluding physicians and nurses. There is a lack of studies on burnout among AHPs in Singapore. This study explored factors associated with a self-reported burnout level and barriers to seeking psychological help among AHPs in Singapore. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study in a sample of AHPs in a tertiary hospital from October to December 2019. We emailed a four-component survey to 1127 eligible participants. The survey comprised four components: (1) sociodemographic characteristics, (2) Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI-HSS), (3) Areas of Worklife Survey, and (4) Perceived Barriers to Psychological Treatment (PBPT). We performed a multiple logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with burnout. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed. Results In total, 328 participants completed the questionnaire. The self-reported burnout level (emotional exhaustion&gt;27 and/or depersonalization&gt;10) was 67.4%. The majority of the respondents were female (83.9%), Singaporean (73.5%), aged 40 years and below (84.2%), and Chinese ethnicity (79.9%). In the multiple logistic regression model, high burnout level was negatively associated with being in the age groups of 31 to 40 (AOR 0.39, 95% CI 0.16–0.93) and 40 years and older (AOR 0.30, 95% CI 0.10–0.87) and a low self-reported workload (AOR 0.35, 95% CI 0.23–0.52). High burnout level was positively associated with a work experience of three to five years (AOR 5.27, 95% CI 1.44–20.93) and more than five years (AOR 4.24; 95% CI 1.16–16.79. One hundred and ninety participants completed the PBPT component. The most frequently cited barriers to seeking psychological help by participants with burnout ( n = 130) were ‘negative evaluation of therapy’ and ‘time constraints.’ Conclusions This study shows a high self-reported burnout level and identifies its associated factors among AHPs in a tertiary hospital. The findings revealed the urgency of addressing burnout in AHPs and the need for effective interventions to reduce burnout. Concurrently, proper consideration of the barriers to seeking help is warranted to improve AHPs' mental well-being."
https://openalex.org/W3118404085,"Motivation Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are powerful frameworks to model medical time series records. Recent studies showed improved accuracy of predicting future medical events (e.g., readmission, mortality) by leveraging large amount of high-dimensional data. However, very few studies have explored the ability of RNN in predicting long-term trajectories of recurrent events, which is more informative than predicting one single event in directing medical intervention. Methods In this study, we focus on heart failure (HF) which is the leading cause of death among cardiovascular diseases. We present a novel RNN framework named Deep Heart-failure Trajectory Model (DHTM) for modelling the long-term trajectories of recurrent HF. DHTM auto-regressively predicts the future HF onsets of each patient and uses the predicted HF as input to predict the HF event at the next time point. Furthermore, we propose an augmented DHTM named DHTM+C (where “C” stands for co-morbidities), which jointly predicts both the HF and a set of acute co-morbidities diagnoses. To efficiently train the DHTM+C model, we devised a novel RNN architecture to model disease progression implicated in the co-morbidities. Results Our deep learning models confers higher prediction accuracy for both the next-step HF prediction and the HF trajectory prediction compared to the baseline non-neural network models and the baseline RNN model. Compared to DHTM, DHTM+C is able to output higher probability of HF for high-risk patients, even in cases where it is only given less than 2 years of data to predict over 5 years of trajectory. We illustrated multiple non-trivial real patient examples of complex HF trajectories, indicating a promising path for creating highly accurate and scalable longitudinal deep learning models for modeling the chronic disease."
https://openalex.org/W3118519487,"The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis plays a principal role in stress response regulation and has been implicated in the etiology of stress-related disorders. The HPA axis regulates the normal synthesis and release of glucocorticoids; dysregulation of the HPA axis causes abnormal responses to stress. FK506-binding protein 5 (FKBP5), a co-chaperone of heat shock protein 90 in the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) molecular complex, is a key GR sensitivity regulator. FKBP5 single nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with dysregulated HPA axis and increased risk of stress-related disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. In this study, we profiled the microRNAs (miRNAs) in the medial prefrontal cortex of Fkbp5 knockout (Fkbp5−/−) mice and identified the target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs using sequence-based miRNA target prediction. Gene ontology analysis revealed that the differentially expressed miRNAs were involved in nervous system development, regulation of cell migration, and intracellular signal transduction. The validation of the expression of predicted target genes using quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that the expression of axon development-related genes, specifically actin-binding LIM protein 1 (Ablim1), lemur tyrosine kinase 2 (Lmtk2), kinesin family member 5c (Kif5c), neurofascin (Nfasc), and ephrin type-A receptor 4 (Epha4), was significantly decreased, while that of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) was significantly increased in the brain of Fkbp5−/− mice. These results suggest that axonal development-related genes can serve as potential targets in future studies focused on understanding the pathophysiology of PTSD."
https://openalex.org/W3119276788,"We describe a new single-streamline based approach to analyse diffusivity within chronic MS lesions. We used the proposed method to examine diffusivity profiles in 30 patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis and observed a significant increase of both RD and AD within the lesion core (0.38+/-0.09 μm 2 /ms and 0.30+/-0.12 μm 2 /ms respectively, p&lt;0.0001 for both) that gradually and symmetrically diminished away from the lesion. T1-hypointensity derived axonal loss correlated highly with ΔAD (r = 0.82, p&lt;0.0001), but moderately with ΔRD (r = 0.60, p&lt;0.0001). Furthermore, the trendline of the ΔAD vs axonal loss intersected both axes at zero indicating close agreement between two measures in assessing the degree of axonal loss. Conversely, the trendline of the ΔRD function demonstrated a high positive value at the zero level of axonal loss, suggesting that even lesions with preserved axonal content exhibit a significant increase of RD. There was also a significant negative correlation between the level of preferential RD increase (ΔRD-ΔAD) in the lesion core and the degree of axonal damage (r = -0.62, p&lt;0.001), indicating that ΔRD dominates in cases with milder axonal loss. Modelling diffusivity changes in the core of chronic MS lesions based on the direct proportionality of ΔAD with axonal loss and the proposed dual nature of ΔRD yielded results that were strikingly similar to the experimental data. Evaluation of lesions in a sizable cohort of MS patients using the proposed method supports the use of ΔAD as a marker of axonal loss; and the notion that demyelination and axonal loss independently contribute to the increase of RD in chronic MS lesions. The work highlights the importance of selecting appropriate patient cohorts for clinical trials of pro-remyelinating and neuroprotective therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W3119418381,"Objectives This study encompassed fall-related deaths, including those who died prior to medical care, that were admitted to multiple healthcare institutions, regardless of whether they died at home, in long-term care, or in hospice. The common element was that all deaths resulted directly or indirectly from injuries sustained during a fall, regardless of the temporal relationship. This comprehensive approach provides an unusual illustration of the clinical sequence of fall–related deaths. Understanding this pathway lays the groundwork for identification of gaps in healthcare needs. Design This is a retrospective study of 2014 fall-related deaths recorded by one medical examiner’s office (n = 511) within a larger dataset of all trauma related deaths (n = 1848). Decedent demographic characteristics and fall-related variables associated with the deaths were coded and described. Results Of those falling, 483 (94.5%) were from heights less than 10 feet and 394 (77.1%) were aged 65+. The largest proportion of deaths (n = 267, 52.3%) occurred post-discharge from an acute care setting. Of those who had a documented prior fall, 216 (42.3%) had a history of one fall while 31 (6.1%) had ≥2 falls prior to their fatal incident. For the 267 post-acute care deaths, 440 healthcare admissions were involved in their care. Of 267 deaths occurring post-acute care, 129 (48.3%) were readmitted within 30 days. Preventability, defined as opportunities for improvement in care that may have influenced the outcome, was assessed. Of the 1848 trauma deaths, 511 (27.7%) were due to falls of which 361 (70.6%) were determined to be preventable or potentially preventable. Conclusion Our data show that readmissions and repeated falls are frequent events in the clinical sequence of fall fatalities. Efforts to prevent fall-related readmissions should be a top priority for improving fall outcomes and increasing the quality of life among those at risk of falling."
https://openalex.org/W3119256162,"Background Occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (OBI) is a phase of HBV infection characterised by the presence of HBV DNA in the absence of detectable hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). OBI is of concern in the HIV-infected due to high prevalence and risk of HBV reactivation. The prevalence and clinico-demographic characteristics of OBI in anti-retroviral therapy (ART) naïve HIV infected adults in Kenya is unknown. Methods A cross sectional study carried was out at three sites in Kenya. HIV infected ART naïve adults were enrolled and demographic data collected. Blood samples were assayed for HBsAg, HBV DNA, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) and hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). Data on CD4 count, HIV viral load and platelet count were obtained from medical records. Results Of 208 patients, 199 (95.7%) did not report HBV vaccination, 196 (94.2%) were HBsAg negative, 119 (57.2%) had no HBV markers, 58 (27.9%) had previous HBV infection (anti-HBc positive) and 11 (5.3%) had OBI.

There was no difference in clinico-demographic characteristics between the overt HBV, OBI and HBV negative patients. Conclusion This was the first study on OBI in ART naïve HIV infected adults in Kenya. The lower OBI prevalence compared to other sub-Saharan African countries could be attributed to lower HBV exposure. Most patients were HBV unexposed and unimmunized, outlining the need to implement guideline recommended immunization strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3120304825,"The gastrointestinal tract of chickens harbors a highly diverse microbiota contributing not only to nutrition, but also to the physiological development of the gastrointestinal tract. Microbiota composition depends on many factors such as the portion of the intestine as well as the diet, age, genotype, or geographical origin of birds. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the influence of the geographical location over the cecal microbiota from broilers. We used metabarcoding sequencing datasets of the 16S rRNA gene publicly available to compare the composition of the Argentine microbiota against the microbiota of broilers from another seven countries (Germany, Australia, Croatia, Slovenia, United States of America, Hungary, and Malaysia). Geographical location played a dominant role in shaping chicken gut microbiota (Adonis R2 = 0.6325, P = 0.001; Mantel statistic r = 0.1524, P = 4e-04) over any other evaluated factor. The geographical origin particularly affected the relative abundance of the families Bacteroidaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Clostridiaceae. Because of the evident divergence of microbiota among countries we coined the term “local microbiota” as convergent feature that conflates non-genetic factors, in the perspective of human-environmental geography. Local microbiota should be taken into consideration as a native overall threshold value for further appraisals when testing the production performance and performing correlation analysis of gut microbiota modulation against different kind of diet and/or management approaches. In this regard, we described the Argentine poultry cecal microbiota by means of samples both from experimental trials and commercial farms. Likewise, we were able to identify a core microbiota composed of 65 operational taxonomic units assigned to seven phyla and 38 families, with the four most abundant taxa belonging to Bacteroides genus, Rikenellaceae family, Clostridiales order, and Ruminococcaceae family."
https://openalex.org/W3120701518,"Deltochilum Eschscholtz, 1822 is perhaps the most speciose genus of the tribe Deltochilini sensu Tarasov &amp; Dimitrov (2016) (Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) and has been traditionally divided into eight subgenera. Among them, the subgenus Deltohyboma Lane, 1946, is the most speciose with 47 species, five of which are described here ( D . genieri sp. nov. , D . gilli sp. nov. , D . susanae sp. nov. , D . bolivariensis sp. nov. and D . inesae sp. nov. ), and at least 165 species still undescribed. Due to the large number of species, and for practical purposes, the subgenus is here divided into 19 species-groups, with D . inesae sp. nov. left as incertae sedis . This division into species-groups will help in the reliable identification of species and will aid in the completion of the revision of subgenus. This report is the first part of the taxonomic revision of the subgenus Deltohyboma ; it is based on the examination of all type specimens and almost 9,800 specimens of which approximately 1,200, mostly males, had their genitalia studied. The 19 species-groups recognized here are based mainly on characters described for the first time for Deltohyboma , namely, the state of a) the anterior margin of the clypeus (between the clypeal teeth), b) the internal margin of hypomera, c) the ventral face of the protibia, d) the posterior margin of the metafemur, and e) several new characters resulting from the first detailed study of the aedeagus and the endophallus of the group. Diagnosis, description, geographic distribution, composition and identifications keys (for males as well as males and females) for the species-groups are provided."
https://openalex.org/W3121025940,"Background As per national policy, all diagnosed tuberculosis patients in India are to be tested using Xpert ® MTB/RIF assay at the district level to diagnose rifampicin resistance. Regardless of the result, samples are transported to the reference laboratories for further testing: first-line Line Probe Assay (FL-LPA) for rifampicin-sensitive samples and second-line LPA(SL-LPA) for rifampicin-resistant samples. Based on the results, samples undergo culture and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing. We assessed among patients diagnosed with tuberculosis at 13 selected Xpert laboratories of Karnataka state, India, i) the proportion whose samples reached the reference laboratories and among them, proportion who completed the diagnostic algorithm ii) factors associated with non-reaching and non-completion and iii) the delays involved. Methods This was a cohort study involving review of programme records. For each TB patient diagnosed between 1 st July and 31 st August 2018 at the Xpert laboratory, we tracked the laboratory register at the linked reference laboratory until 30 th September (censor date) using Nikshay ID (a unique patient identifier), phone number, name, age and sex. Results Of 1660 TB patients, 1208(73%) samples reached the reference laboratories and among those reached, 1124(93%) completed the algorithm. Of 1590 rifampicin-sensitive samples, 1170(74%) reached and 1104(94%) completed the algorithm. Of 64 rifampicin-resistant samples, only 35(55%) reached and 17(49%) completed the algorithm. Samples from rifampicin-resistant TB, extra-pulmonary TB and two districts were less likely to reach the reference laboratory. Non-completion was more likely among rifampicin-resistant TB and sputum-negative samples. The median time for conducting and reporting results of Xpert® MTB/RIF was one day, of FL-LPA 5 days and of SL-LPA16 days. Conclusion These findings are encouraging given the complexity of the algorithm. High non-reaching and non-completion rates in rifampicin-resistant patients is a major concern. Future research should focus on understanding the reasons for the gaps identified using qualitative research methods."
https://openalex.org/W3118329949,"Background Depression is recognized as a prominent health problem and a growing public health concern in HIV-positive youths. Despite this fact, in Ethiopia, there is a dearth of evidence on the prevalence of depression and its associated factors among HIV-positive youths. Methods A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from March 16 to June 01, 2020, among 331 HIV-positive youths attending antiretroviral therapy clinics in Jimma town. A systematic random sampling technique was used to enroll study participants. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression was done to identify factors associated with depression. Variables with a p-value ≤0.25 on the bivariable analysis were candidates for multivariable analysis. Adjusted odds ratios with the respective 95% CI were calculated and p-value &lt;0.05 were used to set statistically significant variables in the multivariable analysis. Results Out of a total of 331 sampled HIV positive youth, 325 have participated in this study with a response rate of 98.2%. The prevalence of depression was 30.2% (95%CI:25.2%-35.1%). Female sex (AOR = 4.12, 95%CI:2.28–7.47), history of hospital admission (AOR = 2.45, 95%CI:1.28–4.70), discontinued education due to HIV/AIDS illness (AOR = 2.09, 95%CI:1.12–3.90), poor treatment adherence (AOR = 2.23, 95%CI:1.04–4.78), opportunistic infections (AOR = 2.16, 95%CI:1.17–3.97), high baseline viral load (AOR = 3.35, 95%CI:1.82–6.16) and ≤6 months duration of HIV diagnosis (AOR = 3.14, 95%CI: 1.47–5.72) were factors significantly associated with depression. Conclusion This study demonstrated a high prevalence of depression among HIV-positive youths. Factors such as female sex, treatment non-adherence, opportunistic infections, &lt;six months since diagnosed with HIV, hospitalization history, high baseline viral load, and school discontinuation due to HIV/AIDS were significantly associated with depression. Therefore, we recommend regular screening for depression co-morbidity among HIV-positive youths and linkage with mental health service providers."
https://openalex.org/W3118617313,"Multiple national and international trends and drivers are radically changing what biological security means for the United Kingdom (UK). New technologies present novel opportunities and challenges, and globalisation has created new pathways and increased the speed, volume and routes by which organisms can spread. The UK Biological Security Strategy (2018) acknowledges the importance of research on biological security in the UK. Given the breadth of potential research, a targeted agenda identifying the questions most critical to effective and coordinated progress in different disciplines of biological security is required. We used expert elicitation to generate 80 policy-relevant research questions considered by participants to have the greatest impact on UK biological security. Drawing on a collaboratively-developed set of 450 questions, proposed by 41 experts from academia, industry and the UK government (consulting 168 additional experts) we subdivided the final 80 questions into six categories: bioengineering; communication and behaviour; disease threats (including pandemics); governance and policy; invasive alien species; and securing biological materials and securing against misuse. Initially, the questions were ranked through a voting process and then reduced and refined to 80 during a one-day workshop with 35 participants from a variety of disciplines. Consistently emerging themes included: the nature of current and potential biological security threats, the efficacy of existing management actions, and the most appropriate future options. The resulting questions offer a research agenda for biological security in the UK that can assist the targeting of research resources and inform the implementation of the UK Biological Security Strategy . These questions include research that could aid with the mitigation of Covid-19, and preparation for the next pandemic. We hope that our structured and rigorous approach to creating a biological security research agenda will be replicated in other countries and regions. The world, not just the UK, is in need of a thoughtful approach to directing biological security research to tackle the emerging issues."
https://openalex.org/W3119650529,"Under pressure, motor actions, such as those required in public speech, surgery, or musical performance, can be compromised, even when these have been well-trained. The latter is often referred to as 'choking' under pressure. Although multifaceted problems mediate such performance failure in anxiogenic situations, such as compromised motor dexterity and cognitive disruption, the fundamental set of abnormalities characterizing choking under pressure and how these abnormalities are related have not been elucidated. Here, we attempted, first, to classify behavioural, psychological, and physiological abnormalities associated with choking under pressure in musicians and, second, to identify their relationship based on datasets derived from a questionnaire with 258 pianist respondents. Explorative factor analysis demonstrated eight functional abnormalities related to the musicians' choking, such as attention to the audience, erroneous motor actions, perceptual confusion, and failure of memory recall, which however did not include exaggerated attention to the performance. This suggests distraction of attention away from skill execution, which may underlie the spoiled performance under pressure. A structural equation analysis further inferred causal relationships among them. For instance, while failure of memory recall was influenced by passive behaviours manifesting under pressure, erroneous motor actions during performance were influenced by feeling rushed and a loss of body control. In addition, some specific personal traits, such as neuroticism, public self-consciousness, and a lack of confidence, were associated with the extent to which pressure brought about these abnormalities. These findings suggest that distinct psycho-behavioural abnormalities and personal traits underlie the detrimental effects of pressure on musical performance."
https://openalex.org/W3120152396,"Despite a long-documented history of severe harmful algal blooms (HABs) in New England coastal waters, corresponding HAB-associated marine mammal mortality events in this region are far less frequent or severe relative to other regions where HABs are common. This long-term survey of the HAB toxins saxitoxin (STX) and domoic acid (DA) demonstrates significant and widespread exposure of these toxins in New England marine mammals, across multiple geographic, temporal and taxonomic groups. Overall, 19% of the 458 animals tested positive for one or more toxins, with 15% and 7% testing positive for STX and DA, respectively. 74% of the 23 different species analyzed demonstrated evidence of toxin exposure. STX was most prevalent in Maine coastal waters, most frequently detected in common dolphins ( Delphinus delphis ), and most often detected during July and October. DA was most prevalent in animals sampled in offshore locations and in bycaught animals, and most frequently detected in mysticetes, with humpback whales ( Megaptera novaeangliae ) testing positive at the highest rates. Feces and urine appeared to be the sample matrices most useful for determining the presence of toxins in an exposed animal, with feces samples having the highest concentrations of STX or DA. No relationship was found between the bloom season of toxin-producing phytoplankton and toxin detection rates, however STX was more likely to be present in July and October. No relationship between marine mammal dietary preference and frequency of toxin detection was observed. These findings are an important part of a framework for assessing future marine mammal morbidity and mortality events, as well as monitoring ecosystem health using marine mammals as sentinel organisms for predicting coastal ocean changes."
https://openalex.org/W3120756779,"Background Approximately 200 million women and girls were reported to have undergone female genital mutilation worldwide in 2015.UNICEF’s data based on household survey estimates 15% of women from 15–49 years have undergone FGM from year 2004–2015. Despite this, reliable data on trend of prevalence of female genital mutilation and its associated birth outcomes have not been documented in Tanzania. This study aimed at determining the trends of female genital mutilation and associated maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes in northern Tanzania. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted using maternally-linked data from Kilimanjaro Christian Medical birth registry involving 30,286 women who gave birth to singletons from 2004–2014. The prevalence of female genital mutilation was computed as proportion of women with female genital mutilation yearly over 10 years. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for adverse birth outcomes associated with female genital mutilation were estimated using multivariable logistic regression model. Results Over the 10-year period, the prevalence of female genital mutilation averaged 15.4%. Female genital mutilation decreased from 23.6% in 2005 to 10.6% in 2014. Female genital mutilation was associated with increased odds for caesarean section (aOR1.26; 95% CI: 1.18–1.34), post-partum haemorrhage (aOR 1.31; 95% CI: 1.10–1.57) and long hospital stay (aOR 1.21; 95% CI: 1.14–1.29). Female genital mutilation also increased women’s likelihood of delivering an infant with low Apgar score at 5 th minute (aOR 1.60; 95% CI: 1.37–1.89).FGM type III and IV had increased odds of caesarean section, episiotomy and prolonged duration of hospital stay as compared to FGM type I and II, although the association was statistically insignificant. Conclusion Female genital mutilation prevalence has declined over the study period. Our study has demonstrated that postpartum haemorrhage, delivery by caesarean section, long maternal hospital stays and low APGAR score are associated with FGM. Initiatives to mitigate FGM practice should be strengthened further to reduce/eliminate this practice. Moreover, surgical interventions to improve severe form FGM are welcomed to improve the aforementioned aspects of obstetric outcome in this locality."
https://openalex.org/W3120935012,"Behavioral thermoregulation is an important defense against the negative impacts of climate change for ectotherms. In this study we examined the use of burrows by a common intertidal crab, Minuca pugnax , to control body temperature. To understand how body temperatures respond to changes in the surface temperature and explore how efficiently crabs exploit the cooling potential of burrows to thermoregulate, we measured body, surface, and burrow temperatures during low tide on Sapelo Island, GA in March, May, August, and September of 2019. We found that an increase in 1°C in the surface temperature led to a 0.70-0.71°C increase in body temperature for females and an increase in 0.75-0.77°C in body temperature for males. Body temperatures of small females were 0.3°C warmer than large females for the same surface temperature. Female crabs used burrows more efficiently for thermoregulation compared to the males. Specifically, an increase of 1°C in the cooling capacity (the difference between the burrow temperature and the surface temperature) led to an increase of 0.42-0.50°C for females and 0.34-0.35°C for males in the thermoregulation capacity (the difference between body temperature and surface temperature). The body temperature that crabs began to use burrows to thermoregulate was estimated to be around 24°C, which is far below the critical body temperatures that could lead to death. Many crabs experience body temperatures of 24°C early in the reproductive season, several months before the hottest days of the year. Because the use of burrows involves fitness trade-offs, these results suggest that warming temperatures could begin to impact crabs far earlier in the year than expected."
https://openalex.org/W3119285124,"Background Nearly 20% of patients with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt infection develop reinfection. It is unclear whether reinfections are caused by an organism previously present or are independent infection events. Objective We used bacterial culture and high throughput sequencing (HTS) of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes to identify bacteria present in serial CSF samples obtained from children who failed CSF shunt infection treatment. We hypothesized that organisms that persist in CSF despite treatment would be detected upon reinfection. Design/methods Serial CSF samples were obtained from 6 patients, 5 with 2 infections and 1 with 3 infections; the study was limited to those for which CSF samples were available from the end of infection and beginning of reinfection. Amplicons of the 16S rRNA gene V4 region were sequenced. Taxonomic assignments of V4 sequences were compared with bacterial species identified in culture. Results Seven infection dyads averaging 13.5 samples per infection were analyzed. A median of 8 taxa [interquartile range (IQR) 5–10] were observed in the first samples from reinfection using HTS. Conventional culture correlated with high abundance of an organism by HTS in all but 1 infection. In 6 of 7 infection dyads, organisms identified by culture at reinfection were detected by HTS of culture-negative samples at the end of the previous infection. The median Chao-Jaccard abundance-based similarity index for matched infection pairs at end of infection and beginning of reinfection was 0.57 (IQR 0.07–0.87) compared to that for unmatched pairs of 0.40 (IQR 0.10–0.60) [p = 0.46]. Conclusion(s) HTS results were generally consistent with culture-based methods in CSF shunt infection and reinfection, and may detect organisms missed by culture at the end of infection treatment but detected by culture at reinfection. However, the CSF microbiota did not correlate more closely within patients at the end of infection and beginning of reinfection than between any two unrelated infections. We cannot reject the hypothesis that sequential infections were independent."
https://openalex.org/W3120362971,"Surveillance of infectious diseases in livestock is traditionally carried out at the farms, which are the typical units of epidemiological investigations and interventions. In Central and Western Europe, high-quality, long-term time series of animal transports have become available and this opens the possibility to new approaches like sentinel surveillance. By comparing a sentinel surveillance scheme based on markets to one based on farms, the primary aim of this paper is to identify the smallest set of sentinel holdings that would reliably and timely detect emergent disease outbreaks in Swiss cattle. Using a data-driven approach, we simulate the spread of infectious diseases according to the reported or available daily cattle transport data in Switzerland over a four year period. Investigating the efficiency of surveillance at either market or farm level, we find that the most efficient early warning surveillance system [the smallest set of sentinels that timely and reliably detect outbreaks (small outbreaks at detection, short detection delays)] would be based on the former, rather than the latter. We show that a detection probability of 86% can be achieved by monitoring all 137 markets in the network. Additional 250 farm sentinels—selected according to their risk—need to be placed under surveillance so that the probability of first hitting one of these farm sentinels is at least as high as the probability of first hitting a market. Combining all markets and 1000 farms with highest risk of infection, these two levels together will lead to a detection probability of 99%. We conclude that the design of animal surveillance systems greatly benefits from the use of the existing abundant and detailed animal transport data especially in the case of highly dynamic cattle transport networks. Sentinel surveillance approaches can be tailored to complement existing farm risk-based and syndromic surveillance approaches."

In a context of a global trust crisis in the European Union, this paper examines if open government data, a promising governance strategy, may help to boost Millennials’ and Generation Z trust in public institutions and satisfaction with public outcomes. First, results from our preliminary analysis challenge some popular beliefs by revealing that younger generations tend to trust in their institutions notably more than the rest of the European citizens. In addition, our findings show that open government data is a trust-enabler for Millennials and Generation Z, not only through a direct link between both, but also thanks to the mediator role of citizens’ satisfaction. Accordingly, public officers are encouraged to spread the implementation of open data strategies as a way to improve younger generations’ attachment to democratic institutions."

https://openalex.org/W3118370479,"Sleep is intimately linked to cognitive performance and exposure to traumatic stress that leads to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) impairs both sleep and cognitive function. However, the contribution of pre-trauma sleep loss to subsequent trauma-dependent fear-associated memory impairment remains unstudied. We hypothesized that sleep deprivation (SD) prior to trauma exposure may increase the severity of a PTSD-like phenotype in rats exposed to single prolonged stress (SPS), a rodent model of PTSD. Rats were exposed to SPS alone, SD alone, or a combination of SPS+SD and measures of fear-associated memory impairments and vigilance state changes were compared to a group of control animals not exposed to SPS or SD. We found that SPS, and SPS+SD animals showed impaired fear-associated memory processing and that the addition of SD to SPS did not further exaggerate the effect of SPS alone. Additionally, the combination of SPS with SD results in a unique homeostatic sleep duration phenotype when compared to SD, SPS, or control animals. SPS exposure following SD represses homeostatic rebound and eliminates sleep-deprivation-induced increases in NREM sleep delta power. This work identifies a unique time frame where trauma exposure and sleep interact and identifies this window of time as a potential therapeutic treatment window for staving off the negative consequences of trauma exposure."

Applying the quantitative approach using a survey with 596 responses from organizations functioning in 30 economic activities, a multi-layered neural network was trained to examine the relationship between standards and predict whether the organization is ISO 14001 certified in addition to testing the developed network on a group of collected cases. The results demonstrated the ability of the network to classify the organization’s certification status by 94.00% according to the training sample and its ability to predict 91.00% of the test sample, with an overall prediction efficiency of 91.30%. This work provides insights and adds to the environmental performance evaluation literature providing a neural network model based on ISO 14031 guidelines that can be extended to include other international standards such as ISO 9001.

https://openalex.org/W3120189701,"Purpose To assess the preoperative characteristics and surgical outcomes of using micro-incision vitrectomy surgery (MIVS) to treat RRD with posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) in an older and a younger patient group. Methods This retrospective cohort study included 407 eyes from 397 patients with primary RRD with PVD who were consecutively treated in our hospital from February 2016 to February 2020. PVD was diagnosed clinically by the presence of a Weiss ring, or was diagnosed morphologically via optical coherence tomography and subsequently confirmed during surgery. The main outcome measures were preoperative RRD characteristics, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and postoperative complications. Results Data were analysed from 55 eyes in the elderly group (age 70 and older), and 352 eyes in the young group (age 69 and younger). There was no significant inter-group difference in the initial reattachment rate. Preoperative characteristics indicated that elderly patients had a significantly lower rate of phakic eyes, shorter mean axial length, lower lattice incidence, and longer time spans from onset to surgery. There were no significant between-group differences in the incidence of the following complications: fibrin formation, intraocular pressure elevation, epi-retinal membrane on the macula, intraocular lens optic capture, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, and vitreous haemorrhage. While the elderly patients had significant postoperative improvements in BCVA, these improvements were significantly lower than those of the younger patients. Conclusions This study highlighted the characteristics and surgical outcomes of MIVS in elderly patients with RRD. Although the time from onset to surgery was longer, MIVS still can be performed safely to improve older patients’ postoperative BCVA."
https://openalex.org/W3119491245,"The location-based services can provide users with the requested location information. But users also need to disclose their current location to the location-based service provider. Therefore, how to protect user’s location privacy is a major concern. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous deniable authenticated encryption scheme called HDAE for location-based services. The proposed scheme permits a sender in a public key infrastructure environment to transmit a message to a receiver in an identity-based environment. Our design utilizes a hybrid encryption method combing the tag-key encapsulation mechanism (tag-KEM) and the data encapsulation mechanism (DEM), which is well adopted for location-based services applications. We give how to design an HDAE scheme utilizing a heterogeneous deniable authenticated tag-KEM (HDATK) and a DEM. We also construct an HDATK scheme and provide security proof in the random oracle model. Comprehensive analysis shows that our scheme is efficient and secure. In addition, we give an application of the HDAE to a location-based services system."

The survey yielded four new strains of Seinura spp., including two strains of S . caverna , a strain of S . italiensis , and a strain of an undescribed species. Molecularly, the two strains of S . caverna were nearly identical to the type strain but showed some minor variations, particularly in the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene. The small subunit and D2-D3 large subunit sequences of the Japanese strain of S . italiensis were nearly identical and identical to its original description, respectively, and the difference in the small subunit was due to mis-reading of the sequences. The new species, S . shigaensis n. sp., was phylogenetically close to S . caverna and S . persica , although these three species were clearly different phylogenetically. The new species was typologically similar or nearly identical to several other Seinura spp., including S . chertkovi , S . christiei , S . italiensis , S . steineri , and S . tenuicaudata , but it can be distinguished from those species by the morphometric values. Because the new species is phylogenetically very close to S . caverna , it could be a good comparative system for S . caverna as a potential satellite model for the predatory nematode."

https://openalex.org/W3119108163,"This study investigated the effect of active hand movement on the perception of 3-D depth change. In Experiment 1, the 3-D height of an object synchronously changed with the participant’s hand movement, but the 3-D height of the object was incongruent with the distance moved by the hand. The results showed no effect of active hand movement on perceived depth. This was inconsistent with the results of a previous study conducted in a similar setting with passive hand movement. It was speculated that this contradiction appeared because the conflict between the distance moved by the hand and visual depth changes were more easily detected in the active movement situation. Therefore, it was assumed that in a condition where this conflict was hard to detect, active hand movement might affect visual depth perception. To examine this hypothesis, Experiment 2 examined whether information from hand movement would resolve the ambiguity in the depth direction of a shaded visual shape. In this experiment, the distance moved by the hand could (logically) accord with either of two depth directions (concave or convex). Moreover, the discrepancy in the distances between visual and haptic perception could be ambiguous because shading cues are unreliable in estimating absolute depth. The results showed that perceived depth directions were affected by the direction of active hand movement, thus supporting the hypothesis. Based on these results, simulations based on a causal inference model were performed, and it was found that these simulations could replicate the qualitative aspects of the experimental results."
