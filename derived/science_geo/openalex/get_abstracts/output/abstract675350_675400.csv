https://openalex.org/W3172838821,"The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the pronounced vulnerability of the elderly and chronically ill to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced morbidity and mortality. Cellular senescence contributes to inflammation, multiple chronic diseases, and age-related dysfunction, but effects on responses to viral infection are unclear. Here, we demonstrate that senescent cells (SnCs) become hyper-inflammatory in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), including SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-1, increasing expression of viral entry proteins and reducing antiviral gene expression in non-SnCs through a paracrine mechanism. Old mice acutely infected with pathogens that included a SARS-CoV-2-related mouse β-coronavirus experienced increased senescence and inflammation, with nearly 100% mortality. Targeting SnCs by using senolytic drugs before or after pathogen exposure significantly reduced mortality, cellular senescence, and inflammatory markers and increased antiviral antibodies. Thus, reducing the SnC burden in diseased or aged individuals should enhance resilience and reduce mortality after viral infection, including that of SARS-CoV-2."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease that presents with progressive cognitive decline, for which effective treatments have remained elusive (Long and Holtzman, 2019Long J.M.

White matter is composed of axons and myelin, a fatty sheath produced by oligodendrocytes that increases axonal conductance and is critical for neuronal signaling. Whether these white matter abnormalities actively contribute to the symptomology and/or progression of AD, or are simply secondary to neuronal degeneration, is currently unclear. Oligodendrocytes and the myelin sheaths they produce wrap axons to optimize conduction velocity and provide neurons with numerous metabolic and trophic factors required for their survival (Fünfschilling et al., 2012Fünfschilling U.

Mature oligodendrocytes and individual myelin sheaths, once generated, are mostly stable in the adult and aging brain. However, recent studies have shown that new myelin is continuously generated via the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) throughout life (Hill et al., 2018Hill R.A. Li A.M.

Chan J.R. Myelin plasticity: sculpting circuits in learning and memory.Nat. Rev.

Disruption of oligodendrogenesis impairs memory consolidation in adult mice.Neuron. 2020; 105: 150-164.e6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). During aging, myelin generation decreases considerably, which seems to contribute to declining cognitive function in aged mice (Wang et al., 2020Wang F. Ren S.Y. Chen J.F. Liu K. Li R.X. Li Z.F. Hu B. Niu J.Q. Xiao L. Chan J.R. Mei F. Myelin degeneration and diminished myelin renewal contribute to age-related deficits in memory.Nat. Neurosci. 2020; 23: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These findings raise the possibility that altered myelin dynamics may partially underlie the cognitive deficits experienced by patients with AD. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that myelin and oligodendroglia are significantly altered in AD-related pathology. Single-cell transcriptomic analyses have detected significant gene expression changes in oligodendrocyte lineage cells from early-stage AD patient brains (Mathys et al., 2019Mathys H.

Alzheimer Res. 2013; 10: 30-37PubMed Google Scholar). For example, Aβ deposition causes focal demyelination and senescence-like changes in OPCs, while the average rate of OPC proliferation was increased in transgenic AD mouse brains, hinting that both aberrant myelin degeneration and remyelination may be occurring in the AD brains (Kang et al., 2013Kang S.H.

Neurosci. 2019; 22: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Thus, understanding AD-related changes in myelin dynamics may require genetic cell-lineage tracing to track the fate of pre-existing and newly formed myelin over time. Here, we report an accelerated degeneration of pre-existing myelin sheaths that is coincident with a significant increase in oligodendrogenesis and myelination in the APP/PS1 transgenic mouse brains, resulting in net myelin loss. Enhancing myelin renewal by deleting the muscarinic M1 receptor (M1R) in OPCs, or treatment with the pro-myelinating drug clemastine, significantly improved the performance of APP/PS1 mice in memory-related tasks and increased the occurrence and peak frequency of hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SPW-Rs). Together, these results demonstrate the potential of enhancing myelination as a therapeutic strategy to improve AD-related cognitive impairment. Recent studies have shown that new myelin is continuously added in the adult brain, even well into aging (Hill et al., 2018Hill R.A. Li A.M. Grutzendler J. Lifelong cortical myelin plasticity and age-related degeneration in the live mammalian brain.Nat. Neurosci. 2018; 21: 683-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar; Wang et al., 2020Wang F. Ren S.Y. Chen J.F. Liu K. Li R.X. Li Z.F. Hu B. Niu J.Q. Xiao L. Chan J.R. Mei F. Myelin degeneration and diminished myelin renewal contribute to age-related deficits in memory.Nat. Neurosci. 2020; 23: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Enhancing new myelin formation in aged mice improves spatial memory, whereas preventing new myelin formation in middle-aged mice impairs spatial memory (Wang et al., 2020Wang F. Ren S.Y. Chen J.F. Liu K. Li R.X. Li Z.F. Hu B. Niu J.Q. Xiao L. Chan J.R. Mei F. Myelin degeneration and diminished myelin renewal contribute to age-related deficits in memory.Nat. Neurosci. 2020; 23: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that the rate of myelin formation may be decreased in AD. To visualize myelin formation, we used the NG2-CreERT; Tau-mGFP mouse line to label newly formed myelin sheaths (Mei et al., 2016Mei F. Lehmann-Horn K. Shen Y.A. Rankin K.A. Stebbins K.J. Lorrain D.S. Pekarek K. A Sagan S. Xiao L. Teuscher C. et al.Accelerated remyelination during inflammatory demyelination prevents axonal loss and improves functional recovery.eLife. 2016; 5: e18246Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar; Young et al., 2013Young K.M.

Oligodendrocyte dynamics in the healthy adult CNS: evidence for myelin remodeling.Neuron. 2013; 77: 873-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Recombination of the Tau-mGFP allele is induced by tamoxifen in NG2-expressing OPCs, but because Tau is highly expressed by mature oligodendrocytes and very low in OPCs, membrane-bound GFP (mGFP) will be present only in oligodendrocytes and myelin sheaths formed after tamoxifen administration (Young et al., 2013Young K.M. Psachoulia K. Tripathi R.B. Dunn S.J. Cossell L. Attwell D. Tohyama K. Richardson W.D. Oligodendrocyte dynamics in the healthy adult CNS: evidence for myelin remodeling.Neuron. 2013; 77: 873-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). APP/PS1; NG2-CreERT; Tau-mGFP mice and littermate controls were given tamoxifen at 7 months of age, close to when cognitive defects first emerge in APP/PS1 mice (Reiserer et al., 2007Reiserer R.S. Harrison F.E. Syverud D.C. McDonald M.P. Impaired spatial learning in the APPSwe + PSEN1DeltaE9 bigenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease.Genes Brain Behav. 2007; 6: 54-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), then perfused for histology after 3 months (Figure 1A). Unexpectedly, we observed significantly more mGFP-positive (mGFP+) myelin sheaths in the corpus callosum, cortex, and hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice than in controls (Figures 1B–1E). A large increase in myelination typically occurs following a demyelinating injury (Franklin and Ffrench-Constant, 2008Franklin R.J. Ffrench-Constant C. Remyelination in the CNS: from biology to therapy.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 839-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar; Franklin and Goldman, 2015Franklin R.J. Goldman S.A. Glia disease and repair-remyelination.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2015; 7: a020594Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), which suggests that the increased myelin formation in APP/PS1 mice may be an endogenous response to myelin degeneration. To track the fate of pre-existing myelin sheaths, we crossed in the PLP-CreERT; mT/mG alleles to label myelin sheaths that were already formed at the time of tamoxifen administration (Figure 1F). PLP is a myelin-associated protein that is expressed only by mature oligodendrocytes; thus, in PLP-CreERT; mT/mG mice, pre-existing oligodendrocytes and myelin sheaths will express mGFP upon tamoxifen-induced recombination. APP/PS1; PLP-CreERT; mT/mG mice and littermate controls were treated with tamoxifen at 2–4 months of age and perfused for histology at 13 months. Relative to controls, APP/PS1 mice had significantly lower levels of mGFP+ area in cortex and hippocampus, indicating extensive loss of pre-existing myelin sheaths relative to controls (Figures 1G–1I). To examine whether there is a relationship between Aβ plaques, a pathological hallmark of AD that is recapitulated in APP/PS1 mice (Gordon et al., 2001Gordon M.N. King D.L. Diamond D.M. Jantzen P.T. Boyett K.V. Hope C.E. Hatcher J.M. DiCarlo G. Gottschall W.P. Morgan D. Arendash G.W. Correlation between cognitive deficits and Abeta deposits in transgenic APP+PS1 mice.Neurobiol. Aging. 2001; 22: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), we examined the pattern of myelination around Aβ deposits in APP/PS1 mice (Figure S1A). Aβ deposits appeared to induce focal demyelination and inflammation, indicated by the absence of mGFP+ myelin sheaths and the presence of activated Iba1-positive microglia around the plaques (Figure S1B). However, Aβ deposits were present in only approximately 1% of the mGFP+ areas in 8-month-old APP/PS1 brains (Figure S1A), implying that the degeneration of pre-existing myelin also occurred extensively in areas devoid of Aβ deposition. Additionally, upon further examination of myelin renewal, we found the amount of newly formed myelin (i.e., mGFP+ myelin internodes in the NG2-CreERT; Tau-mGFP line) was comparable in regions adjacent to, or further away from, Aβ deposits (Figure S1C). These results indicate that the degeneration of myelin in the APP/PS1 mice is not exclusively attributable to Aβ plaques and that myelin renewal does not tend to occur in these regions. Therefore, the alteration in myelin dynamics in the APP/PS1 mice is likely the result of a different, as of yet unidentified, mechanism. To determine whether the newly generated myelin sheaths are transiently formed or maintained over time, we immunostained for myelin basic protein (MBP) in APP/PS1; PLP-CreERT; mT/mG mice that were treated with tamoxifen at 2–4 months and sacrificed at 13 months (Figures S1D and S1E). In these mice, myelin sheaths that existed at the time of recombination would be double-positive for mGFP and MBP (mGFP+ MBP+, pseudo-colored blue), whereas sheaths that were formed subsequent to tamoxifen treatment would be positive only for MBP (mGFP− MBP+, pseudo-colored red). We observed an almost 2-fold increase in the amount of myelin sheaths generated after 2–4 months of age in APP/PS1 mice, which suggests that the increased rate of myelin formation did result in the stable accumulation of new myelin sheaths (Figures S1F–S1H). As both myelin formation and myelin degeneration were significantly elevated in APP/PS1 mice, we quantified the overall levels of MBP by immunostaining and western blot to determine whether these processes resulted in a net change in myelination. At 4 months of age, MBP expression in the cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice was comparable with that in controls but was decreased by 8 and 13 months of age, whereas the number of OPCs remained unchanged (Figures 2A–2C, S2A, and S2B). Previous studies have shown that APP/PS1 mice begin to display deficits in spatial memory around 8 months (Reiserer et al., 2007Reiserer R.S. Harrison F.E. Syverud D.C. McDonald M.P. Impaired spatial learning in the APPSwe + PSEN1DeltaE9 bigenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease.Genes Brain Behav. 2007; 6: 54-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), and MBP protein was also decreased in the hippocampus of 8-month-old APP/PS1 mice (Figure 2D), indicating a possible correlation between myelin loss and the onset of cognitive deficits. Consistently, the number of Caspr-positive paranodes and MOG expression were also decreased in the cortex of 8-month-old APP/PS1 mice compared with wild-type controls (Figures S2D and S2E). Axon densities, measured by NF200 immunostaining, were not significantly changed (Figure 2E). To confirm the loss of compact myelin, we quantified the number of myelinated axons in the corpus callosum by transmission electron microscopy. APP/PS1 mice had significantly fewer myelinated axons at 17 and 22 months of age, indicating that myelin loss occurs extensively in both gray and white matter regions (Figures 2C and S2C). To further validate that myelin degeneration is a prominent feature in AD, we examined myelin patterns in the cortex (frontal lobe) and hippocampus of AD patients and age-matched controls. MBP+ areas were significantly decreased in AD patients in both cortex and hippocampus, indicating widespread myelin loss in regions that are critical for memory and other cognitive functions (Figure 2F). The incomplete replacement of myelin loss by endogenous repair mechanisms led us to hypothesize that myelin degeneration may contribute to AD-related deficits in cognition. If this were the case, then we would expect that enhancing myelin renewal may improve the performance of APP/PS1 mice in memory-related tasks. We previously identified the muscarinic receptor 1 (M1R) as a negative regulator of OPC differentiation (Mei et al., 2016Mei F. Lehmann-Horn K. Shen Y.A. Rankin K.A. Stebbins K.J. Lorrain D.S.

Teuscher C. et al.Accelerated remyelination during inflammatory demyelination prevents axonal loss and improves functional recovery.eLife. 2016; 5: e18246Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Conditional deletion of M1R from OPCs results in enhanced OPC differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes and increased myelin formation in adult and aged mice (Wang et al., 2020Wang F. Ren S.Y.

To examine whether we could also increase myelin renewal to combat AD-related myelin degeneration, we crossed APP/PS1 mice with NG2-CreERT; M1R fl/fl; Tau-mGFP to simultaneously delete M1R from OPCs and monitor the rate of new myelin formation (Figure 3). Mice were treated with tamoxifen at 7–8 months, when endogenous myelin formation was already increased in APP/PS1 mice and cognitive deficits begin to manifest (Figure 3A) (Reiserer et al., 2007Reiserer R.S. Harrison F.E. Syverud D.C. McDonald M.P. Impaired spatial learning in the APPSwe + PSEN1DeltaE9 bigenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease.Genes Brain Behav. 2007; 6: 54-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). M1R deletion in OPCs was confirmed by immunostaining for M1R and PDGFRα in the M1R conditional knockout (cKO) brain 3 months after recombination (Figure S3A). M1R expression remained undetectable in mGFP+ pre-OLs and myelinating OLs in the APP/PS1; M1R cKO brains (Figure S3B). As expected, mGFP+ areas were exclusively co-localized with MBP-positive myelin and CC1-positive mature OLs (Figure S3C). M1R deletion from OPCs resulted in a significant increase in mGFP+ myelin sheaths in the corpus callosum, cortex, and hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice after 3 and 6 months of recombination without affecting vascular density (CD31 positive) or cerebral blood perfusion (CBP) (Figures 3B–3D, S3D, and S3E). In addition, the newly generated myelin (MBP/mGFP double-positive) and mature OLs (CC1/mGFP double-positive) were dramatically increased in the M1R cKO brains compared with controls from 3 to 6 months after recombination (Figures 3E and S3C). The mGFP+ myelin co-localized with Caspr, a paranodal marker expressed by axons (Figure 3F). Thus, M1R deletion from OPCs can enhance myelin renewal in APP/PS1 mice. To evaluate the longitudinal effects of M1R deletion on myelination, we analyzed the APP/PS1; NG2-CreERT; M1R fl/fl; Tau-mGFP mice that were treated with tamoxifen at 7–8 months after 3, 6, or 9 months (Figure S4A). mGFP+ myelin sheaths were increased by 2- and 3-fold in mice perfused after 6 and 9 months, respectively, relative to mice perfused after 3 months (Figure S4B). Thus, M1R deletion in OPCs resulted in a stable, time-dependent increase in new myelin formation in APP/PS1 mice. Importantly, overall levels of MBP- and CC1-positive cells were increased in the cortex of APP/PS1; M1R cKO cortex 6 months after recombination compared with age-matched APP/PS1 controls (Figure 3G), suggesting that enhanced myelin renewal by M1R deletion alleviates AD-related myelin loss in the APP/PS1 mice.

https://openalex.org/W3168713078,"Scientists from nearly all disciplines face the problem of simultaneously evaluating many hypotheses. Conducting multiple comparisons increases the likelihood that a non-negligible proportion of associations will be false positives, clouding real discoveries. Drawing valid conclusions require taking into account the number of performed statistical tests and adjusting the statistical confidence measures. Several strategies exist to overcome the problem of multiple hypothesis testing. We aim to summarize critical statistical concepts and widely used correction approaches while also draw attention to frequently misinterpreted notions of statistical inference. We provide a step-by-step description of each multiple-testing correction method with clear examples and present an easy-to-follow guide for selecting the most suitable correction technique. To facilitate multiple-testing corrections, we developed a fully automated solution not requiring programming skills or the use of a command line. Our registration free online tool is available at www.multipletesting.com and compiles the five most frequently used adjustment tools, including the Bonferroni, the Holm (step-down), the Hochberg (step-up) corrections, allows to calculate False Discovery Rates (FDR) and q-values. The current summary provides a much needed practical synthesis of basic statistical concepts regarding multiple hypothesis testing in a comprehensible language with well-illustrated examples. The web tool will fill the gap for life science researchers by providing a user-friendly substitute for command-line alternatives."

AI plays an essential role in COVID-19 case classification as we can apply machine learning models on COVID-19 case data to predict infectious cases and recovery rates using chest x-ray. Accessing patient’s private data violates patient privacy and traditional machine learning model requires accessing or transferring whole data to train the model. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in federated machine learning, as it provides an effective solution for data privacy, centralized computation, and high computation power. In this paper, we studied the efficacy of federated learning versus traditional learning by developing two machine learning models (a federated learning model and a traditional machine learning model)using Keras and TensorFlow federated, we used a descriptive dataset and chest x-ray (CXR) images from COVID-19 patients. During the model training stage, we tried to identify which factors affect model prediction accuracy and loss like activation function, model optimizer, learning rate, number of rounds, and data Size, we kept recording and plotting the model loss and prediction accuracy per each training round, to identify which factors affect the model performance, and we found that softmax activation function and SGD optimizer give better prediction accuracy and loss, changing the number of rounds and learning rate has slightly effect on model prediction accuracy and prediction loss but increasing the data size did not have any effect on model prediction accuracy and prediction loss. finally, we build a comparison between the proposed models’ loss, accuracy, and performance speed, the results demonstrate that the federated machine learning model has a better prediction accuracy and loss but higher performance time than the traditional machine learning model."

Here we demonstrate that Lgr6 marks a regionally restricted population of epidermal stem cells that interact with nerves and specialize in wound re-epithelialization. Diphtheria toxin-mediated ablation of Lgr6 stem cells delays wound healing, and skin denervation phenocopies this effect. Using intravital imaging to capture stem cell dynamics after injury, we show that wound re-epithelialization by Lgr6 stem cells is diminished following loss of nerves. This induces recruitment of other stem cell populations, including hair follicle stem cells, which partially compensate to mediate wound closure. Single-cell lineage tracing and gene expression analysis reveal that the fate of Lgr6 stem cells is shifted toward differentiation following loss of their niche. We conclude that Lgr6 epidermal stem cells are primed for injury response and interact with nerves to regulate their fate.

Individuals with minoritized sexual and gender identities are at a higher risk of experiencing such negative changes in their well-being. The objective of this study was to compare levels of well-being among cis-heterosexual individuals and individuals with minoritized sexual and gender identities during the COVID-19 pandemic.Using data obtained in a cross-sectional online survey between April 20 to July 20, 2020 (N = 2332), we compared levels of well-being (WHO-5) across subgroups (cis-individuals with minoritized sexual identities, individuals with minoritized gender identities and cis-heterosexual individuals) applying univariate (two-sample t-test) and multivariate analysis (multivariate linear regression).Results indicate overall lower levels of well-being as well as lower levels of well-being in minoritized sexual or gender identities compared to cis-heterosexual individuals. Further, multivariate analyses revealed that living in urban communities as well as being in a relationship were positively associated with higher levels of well-being. Furthermore, a moderation analysis showed that being in a relationship reduces the difference between groups in terms of well-being.Access to mental healthcare for individuals with minoritized sexual and gender identities as well as access to gender-affirming resources should be strengthened during COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare services with low barriers of access such as telehealth and online peer support groups should be made available, especially for vulnerable groups."

In this study, efforts were made to check the infectivity of a local SARS-CoV-2 isolate in a self-limiting and non-lethal hamster model and evaluate the differential expression of lung proteins during acute infection and convalescence. The findings of this study confirm the infectivity of this isolate in vivo. Analysis of clinical parameters and tissue samples show the pathophysiological manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection similar to that reported earlier in COVID-19 patients and hamsters infected with other isolates. However, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), a common histopathological feature of human COVID-19 was only occasionally noticed. The lung-associated pathological changes were very prominent on the 4th day post-infection (dpi), mostly resolved by 14 dpi. Here, we carried out the quantitative proteomic analysis of the lung tissues from SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters on day 4 and day 14 post-infection. This resulted in the identification of 1585 proteins of which 68 proteins were significantly altered between both the infected groups. Pathway analysis revealed complement and coagulation cascade, platelet activation, ferroptosis, and focal adhesion as the top enriched pathways. In addition, we also identified altered expression of two pulmonary surfactant-associated proteins (Sftpd and Sftpb), known for their protective role in lung function. Together, these findings will aid in understanding the mechanism(s) involved in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and progression of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W3167865419,"Formation of biomolecular condensates through liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) has been described for several pathogenic proteins linked to neurodegenerative diseases and is discussed as an early step in the formation of protein aggregates with neurotoxic properties. In prion diseases, neurodegeneration and formation of infectious prions is caused by aberrant folding of the cellular prion protein (PrPC). PrPC is characterized by a large intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain and a structured C-terminal globular domain. A significant fraction of mature PrPC is proteolytically processed in vivo into an entirely unstructured fragment, designated N1, and the corresponding C-terminal fragment C1 harboring the globular domain. Notably, N1 contains a polybasic motif that serves as a binding site for neurotoxic Aβ oligomers. PrP can undergo LLPS; however, nothing is known how phase separation of PrP is triggered on a molecular scale. Here, we show that the intrinsically disordered N1 domain is necessary and sufficient for LLPS of PrP. Similar to full-length PrP, the N1 fragment formed highly dynamic liquid-like droplets. Remarkably, a slightly shorter unstructured fragment, designated N2, which lacks the Aβ-binding domain and is generated under stress conditions, failed to form liquid-like droplets and instead formed amorphous assemblies of irregular structures. Through a mutational analysis, we identified three positively charged lysines in the postoctarepeat region as essential drivers of condensate formation, presumably largely via cation–π interactions.

In mammals, a conformational transition of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) into the scrapie isoform leads to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies or prion diseases, such as Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease in humans, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, and scrapie in sheep and goat (21Prusiner S.B. Prions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (4936) Google Scholar). PrPC shows an interesting modular structure: an extended intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain and a highly structured C-terminal domain of a similar length (Fig. 1A). Various approaches in transgenic mice and cultured cells, including primary neurons, revealed that the N-terminal domain modulates signaling activity of PrPC. Strikingly, this role is seemingly contradictory because a physiological function of PrPC to promote neuronal homeostasis under diverse stress conditions is linked to this domain as well as a pathophysiological activity of certain PrP mutants (reviewed in (22Beland M.

Macromol. 2021; 173: 34-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar); however, the underlying molecular mechanisms that drive the formation of liquid-like droplets remain unknown. In the present study, we analyzed phase separation of full-length PrP and its major proteolytic fragments N1, N2, C1, and C2. Our experiments revealed that N1 is necessary and sufficient to drive phase separation of full-length PrP. Within N1, positively charged residues located in the Aβ-binding domain are essential for the formation of biomolecular condensates, most likely via cation–π interactions. To study LLPS of PrP in vitro, we used maltose-binding protein (MBP)–PrP–eGFP fusion proteins (Fig. 1B). Phase separation was induced by tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease-mediated liberation of PrP–eGFP from MBP and monitored by laser scanning microscopy. Full-length PrP rapidly formed droplets upon TEV protease cleavage, indicative of LLPS (Fig. 1C, TEV+). A key feature of proteins undergoing condensate formation is the presence of intrinsically disordered and low-complexity regions (6Darling A.L. Liu Y. Oldfield C.J. Uversky V.N. Intrinsically disordered proteome of human membrane-less organelles.Proteomics. 2018; 18e1700193Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which are important drivers of phase separation. To study the role of the unstructured domain of PrP in LLPS, we cloned N1 and N2, the two disordered N-terminal fragments of PrP that are generated in vivo through proteolytic processing by an α- and β-cleavage, respectively (Fig. 1A). Indeed, N1 underwent phase separation similarly to full-length PrP, indicating that the structural elements in the C-terminal domain are not required for the formation of biomolecular condensates. In contrast, N2 formed irregular assemblies instead of liquid-like droplets (Fig. 1C, TEV+), which were not present before TEV cleavage (Fig. 1C, TEV−). These findings raised the question of whether the globular domain can undergo LLPS in the absence of the unstructured domains. Consequently, we analyzed C1 and C2, the C-terminal fragments generated after α- or β-cleavage, in parallel to N1 or N2 (Fig. 1A). Both before and after TEV cleavage, GFP fluorescence was evenly distributed, indicating that neither C1 nor C2 formed biomolecular condensates under these conditions, corroborating recent results (41Tange H. Ishibashi D. Nakagaki T. Taguchi Y. Kamatari Y.O. Ozawa H. Nishida N. Liquid-liquid phase separation of full-length prion protein initiates conformational conversion in vitro.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296: 100367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Of note, the lack of LLPS was not due to inefficient TEV cleavage (Fig. 1C, right panels). To study the droplets/assemblies formed by N1 and N2 in more detail, we performed confocal laser scanning microscopy and recorded Z-stacks with a depth of 10 μm. Representative volumetric three-dimensional reconstructions supported the notion that N1 formed droplets, similarly to full-length PrPs, whereas the N2 assemblies were of irregular structures (Fig. 2A, upper panels). A signature of biomolecular condensates are highly dynamic molecules that rapidly exchange both within the condensate and with the surrounding environment. We recorded fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to test for a dynamic behavior of the PrP droplets. Full-length PrPs as well as N1 molecules in the droplets were highly dynamic, characteristic of a liquid-like state. In contrast, fluorescence recovery of the irregular N2 structures was greatly delayed, indicating formation of a gel-like or aggregated state (Fig. 2A, lower panels). Because we recorded FRAP 1 h after TEV protease-mediated cleavage, we considered the possibility that the N2 assemblies initially had liquid-like properties but then rapidly converted into a gel-like or aggregated state. Consequently, we did the FRAP analysis immediately after addition of TEV protease. Already under this condition, the N2 assemblies turned out to be nondynamic (Fig. S1A). To address the possibility that the GFP tag influences LLPS, we purified MBP-N1 and MBP-N2 fusion proteins without GFP. Images taken by using bright-field microscopy confirmed that after TEV cleavage, MBP-N1 rapidly formed droplets, whereas MBP-N2 formed assemblies of irregular structures (Fig. 2B). Next, we analyzed the conformation of phase-separated N1 after purifying recombinant N1 lacking both the MBP and GFP tag. N1(64 μM in 20 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4) spontaneously formed liquid-like droplets, corroborating our findings with the TEV-induced cleavage of MBP-fusion proteins (Fig. 2C, Fig. S1B). At the same conditions, the CD spectrum of N1 is characterized by a negative CD band below 210 nm, indicating that the protein displays a fully disordered secondary structure at this condition (46Kelly S.M. Jess T.J. Price N.C. How to study proteins by circular dichroism.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1751: 119-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2202) Google Scholar). In the presence of 4 M urea, which prevents phase separation, only minor changes in the CD spectrum of N1 were observed. These findings show that the formation of liquid-like droplets by N1 is not accompanied by a significant conformational change (Fig. 2D). Finally, dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments were carried out to determine the size of the N1 droplets (Fig. 2E). Based on the intensity distribution functions of the hydrodynamic radius, the N1 samples exhibited a largely polydisperse size distribution pattern, indicative of droplet formation of sizes ranging from 40 to several 1000 nm. Large hydrodynamic radius values beyond 1000 nm, that is, sizes in the μm range, indicate droplet formation as detectable by light microscopy. Interestingly, even in the urea-containing buffer, where macroscopic phase separation does not occur, N1 is not only present in its monomeric state but also forms larger oligomeric assemblies. In sum, these experiments revealed that the unstructured domain of PrP is necessary and sufficient for LLPS. Furthermore, the comparative analysis of N1 and N2 has shown that the postoctarepeat region is crucial in driving LLPS of PrPs. To gain insight into mechanisms underlying phase separation of N1, we had a closer look at amino acids that can drive phase separation via intermolecular interactions. The scheme in Figure 3A depicts the amino acid composition of the N-terminal domain of PrPs. The unstructured domain is devoid of any negatively charged amino acids and contains only nine amino acids with positively charged side chains, which are in either an N- or C-terminal cluster (PB1 and PB2; see also Fig. 1A). In the “sticker and spacer” model that is frequently used to describe LLPS by intrinsically disordered domains, glycine is generally considered a spacer (47Wang J. Choi J.M. Holehouse A.S. Lee H.O. Zhang X. Jahnel M. Maharana S. Lemaitre R. Pozniakovsky A. Drechsel D. Poser I. Pappu R.V. Alberti S. Hyman A.A. A molecular grammar governing the driving forces for phase separation of prion-like RNA binding proteins.Cell. 2018; 174: 688-699.e616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Thus, it is interesting that N1 contains numerous glycines. Hydrophobic residues are evenly distributed over the entire domain with all but two of them being prolines. This is worth mentioning based on a possible specific role they are playing in phase separation. The partially positively charged faces of the pyrrolidine ring has been described to mediate intermolecular interactions with the negatively charged π faces of aromatic residues (48Zondlo N.J. Aromatic-proline interactions: Electronically tunable CH/pi interactions.Acc. Chem. Res. 2013; 46: 1039-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The aromatic amino acids are also rather evenly distributed within the N1 domain without obvious cluster formation. The location of the six histidine residues is indicated because copper binding to these histidines seems to influence the structure and physiological function of PrPC as well as the formation of the scrapie isoform of prion protein (49Brown D.R.

Comparing N2 with N1, the most striking difference is the lack of the polybasic cluster in the postoctarepeat domain (PB2), which serves as a binding domain for neurotoxic Aβ oligomers (29Lauren J.

Conceptually, the positively charged lysines may contribute to phase separation via intermolecular cation–π interactions (11Kang J. Lim L. Lu Y. Song J.

To test this hypothesis experimentally, we mutated the three lysines in PB2 to alanines (Fig. 3B) and analyzed phase separation. Indeed, the loss of the three lysine residues in the postoctarepeat region significantly impaired condensate formation of N1•PB2>A. The microscopic analysis revealed the formation of irregular structures, similarly to N2 (Fig. 3C, Figs. S2 and S3). Importantly, the FRAP recording supported the notion that N1•PB2>A lost its liquid-like properties. To support our concept that lysines are effective through their positive charge, we generated N1•PB2>R in which the three lysine residues in PB2 were mutated to positively charged arginines. Indeed, N1•PB2>R underwent LLPS similarly to N1 (Fig. S4A). In contrast, mutation of the aromatic residues (N1•W|Y > G) impaired LLPS, emphasizing the important role of cation–π interactions between positively charged residues and aromatic residues in driving LLPS of N1 (Fig. S4B). Based on these findings, we were wondering whether the other polybasic motif, located at the very N terminus, has a similar function in LLPS. N1•PB1>A did also not undergo LLPS and formed assemblies with irregular structures, indicating a gel-like or aggregated state, as judged by FRAP recordings (Fig. 3C, Figs. S2 and S3). As expected, deleting both the N- and C-terminal polybasic motifs (N1•PB1+2 > A) aggravated this phenotype. Finally, we mutated the four histidines within the octarepeat region. However, phase separation of N1•OR-H>G was not impaired (Fig. 3C, Figs. S2 and S3). In conclusion, our study provided new mechanistic insights into the propensity of the mammalian prion protein to undergo LLPS. Our experiments revealed that the intrinsically disordered N1"

https://openalex.org/W3169520674,"Recurrence of metastatic breast cancer stemming from acquired endocrine and chemotherapy resistance remains a health burden for women with luminal (ER+) breast cancer. Disseminated ER+ tumor cells can remain viable but quiescent for years to decades. Contributing factors to metastatic spread include the maintenance and expansion of breast cancer stem cells (CSCs). Breast CSCs frequently exist as a minority population in therapy resistant tumors. In this study, we show that cytoplasmic complexes composed of steroid receptor (SR) co-activators, PELP1 and SRC-3, modulate breast CSC expansion through upregulation of the HIF-activated metabolic target genes PFKFB3 and PFKFB4. Seahorse metabolic assays demonstrated that cytoplasmic PELP1 influences cellular metabolism by increasing both glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. PELP1 interacts with PFKFB3 and PFKFB4 proteins, and inhibition of PFKFB3 and PFKFB4 kinase activity blocks PELP1-induced tumorspheres and protein–protein interactions with SRC-3. PFKFB4 knockdown inhibited in vivo emergence of circulating tumor cell (CTC) populations in mammary intraductal (MIND) models. Application of PFKFB inhibitors in combination with ER targeted therapies blocked tumorsphere formation in multiple models of advanced breast cancer including tamoxifen (TamR) and paclitaxel (TaxR) resistant models, murine tumor cells, and ER+ patient-derived organoids (PDxO). Together, our data suggest that PELP1, SRC-3, and PFKFBs cooperate to drive ER+ tumor cell populations that include CSCs and CTCs. Identifying non-ER pharmacological targets offers a useful approach to blocking metastatic escape from standard of care ER/estrogen (E2)-targeted strategies to overcome endocrine and chemotherapy resistance."

Dual-energy CT (DECT) can depict pulmonary perfusion by regional assessment of iodine uptake. Objective The purpose of this study was the analysis of pulmonary perfusion using dual-energy CT in a cohort of 27 consecutive patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Method We retrospectively analyzed pulmonary perfusion with DECT in 27 consecutive patients (mean age 57 years, range 21–73; 19 men and 8 women) with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Iodine uptake (IU) in regions-of-interest placed into normally aerated lung, ground-glass opacifications (GGO) and consolidations was measured using a dedicated postprocessing software. Vessel enlargement (VE) within opacifications and presence of pulmonary embolism (PE) was assessed by subjective analysis. Linear mixed models were used for statistical analyses. Results Compared to normally aerated lung 106/151 (70.2%) opacifications without upstream PE demonstrated an increased IU, 9/151 (6.0%) an equal IU and 36/151 (23.8%) a decreased IU. The estimated mean iodine uptake (EMIU) in opacifications without upstream PE (GGO 1.77 mg/mL; 95%-CI: 1.52–2.02; p = 0.011, consolidations 1.82 mg/mL; 95%-CI: 1.56–2.08, p = 0.006) was significantly higher compared to normal lung (1.22 mg/mL; 95%-CI: 0.95–1.49). In case of upstream PE, EMIU of opacifications (combined GGO and consolidations) was significantly decreased compared to normal lung (0.52 mg/mL; 95%-CI: -0.07–1.12; p = 0.043). The presence of VE in opacifications correlated significantly with iodine uptake (p&lt;0.001). Conclusions DECT revealed the opacifications in a subset of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia to be perfused non-uniformly with some being hypo- and others being hyperperfused. Mean iodine uptake in opacifications (both ground-glass and consolidation) was higher compared to normally aerated lung except for areas with upstream pulmonary embolism. Vessel enlargement correlated with iodine uptake: In summary, in a cohort of 27 consecutive patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, dual-energy CT demonstrated a wide range of iodine uptake in pulmonary ground-glass opacifications and consolidations as a surrogate marker for hypo- and hyperperfusion compared to normally aerated lung. Applying DECT to determine which pathophysiology is predominant might help to tailor therapy to the individual patient´s needs."
https://openalex.org/W3169024527,"Introduction In late 2019, a new coronavirus disease known as COVID-19 (novel coronavirus disease 2019) was identified. As there is no any drug to treat this pandemic, the healthcare professionals are disproportionately at higher risk. The mental health outcome is expected to be high. Anxiety is expected to have a significant impact on health professionals, especially among those who work without adequate resources for self-protection. Objectives The objectives of this research was to assess self-reported anxiety symptoms and associated factors among Ethiopian healthcare professionals in the early stages of the pandemic. Methods We have conducted an online cross-sectional study to collect information from healthcare professionals in Ethiopia during the early stage of the outbreak from April 7, 2020 to May 19, 2020. GAD-7 was used for measurement of anxiety. We have used a cut of point of 10 and above to report anxiety symptoms. We have used Google Forms for online data collection and SPSS-22 for analysis. To determine associated factors for anxiety, a binary logistic regression model was used. Variables with p-value &lt; 0.2 during the bivariable binary logistic regression were exported for further analysis in the multivariable binary logistic regression. Finally, variables with p-value &lt;0.05 were considered as significantly associated with the outcomes. Results Three hundred and eighty-eight healthcare professionals filled the online questionnaire; Majority (71.1%) were males. Significant number of respondents (78.9%) reported lack of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) at the work place. The prevalence of anxiety was 26.8%. Being female (AOR: 1.88; 95% C.I:1.11, 3.19), visiting/treating 30–150 patients per day (AOR: 3.44; 95% C.I:1.51, 7.84), those employed at private healthcare institutions (AOR: 2.40; 95% C.I:1.17, 4.90), who do not believe that COVID-19 is preventable (AOR: 2.04; 95% C.I:1.04, 4.03) and those who reported lack of PPE (AOR: 1.98; 95% C.I:1.04, 3.79) were more likely to be anxious. Conclusions The anxiety prevalence among healthcare professionals in Ethiopia during early stage of COVID-19 pandemic was high. This study shows that lack of preventive equipment, being female, contact with many patients, low self-efficacy and working in private health facilities were risk factors for anxiety. Anxiety prevention among health professionals during COVID-19 pandemic requires a holistic approach including provision of sufficient PPE, improving self-efficacy and addressing problems both at public and private institutions and focusing more on female health professionals."
https://openalex.org/W3170189335,"Keloids are fibrotic lesions that grow unceasingly and invasively and are driven by local mechanical stimuli. Unlike other fibrotic diseases and normal wound healing, keloids exhibit little transformation of dermal fibroblasts into α-SMA+ myofibroblasts. This study showed that asporin is the most strongly expressed gene in keloids and its gene-ontology terms relate strongly to ECM metabolism/organization. Experiments with human dermal cells (HDFs) showed that asporin overexpression/treatment abrogated the HDF ability to adopt a perpendicular orientation when subjected to stretching tension. It also induced calcification of the surrounding 3D collagen matrix. Asporin overexpression/treatment also prevented the HDFs from remodeling the surrounding 3D collagen matrix, leading to a disorganized network of thick, wavy collagen fibers that resembled keloid collagen architecture. This in turn impaired the ability of the HDFs to contract the collagen matrix. Asporin treatment also made the fibroblasts impervious to the fibrous collagen contraction of α-SMA+ myofibroblasts, which normally activates fibroblasts. Thus, by calcifying collagen, asporin prevents fibroblasts from linearly rearranging the surrounding collagen; this reduces both their mechanosensitivity and mechanosignaling to each other through the collagen network. This blocks fibroblast activation and differentiation into the mature myofibroblasts that efficiently remodel the extracellular matrix. Consequently, the fibroblasts remain immature, highly proliferative, and continue laying down abundant extracellular matrix, causing keloid growth and invasion. Notably, dermal injection of asporin-overexpressing HDFs into murine wounds recapitulated keloid collagen histopathological characteristics. Thus, disrupted interfibroblast mechanocommunication may promote keloid progression. Asporin may be a new diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for keloids."

The multifunctional enzyme Transglutaminase 2 (TGM2), which harbors transamidation and GTPase activity, has been implicated in the development and progression of different types of human cancers. However, the mechanism and role of TGM2 in colorectal cancer are poorly understood. Here, we present TGM2 as a promising drug target.In primary patient material of CRC patients, we detected an increased expression and enzymatic activity of TGM2 in colon cancer tissue in comparison to matched normal colon mucosa cells. The genetic ablation of TGM2 in CRC cell lines using shRNAs or CRISPR/Cas9 inhibited cell expansion and tumorsphere formation. In vivo, tumor initiation and growth were reduced upon genetic knockdown of TGM2 in xenotransplantations. TGM2 ablation led to the induction of Caspase-3-driven apoptosis in CRC cells. Functional rescue experiments with TGM2 variants revealed that the transamidation activity is critical for the pro-survival function of TGM2. Transcriptomic and protein-protein interaction analyses applying various methods including super-resolution and time-lapse microscopy showed that TGM2 directly binds to the tumor suppressor p53, leading to its inactivation and escape of apoptosis induction.We demonstrate here that TGM2 is an essential survival factor in CRC, highlighting the therapeutic potential of TGM2 inhibitors in CRC patients with high TGM2 expression. The inactivation of p53 by TGM2 binding indicates a general anti-apoptotic function, which may be relevant in cancers beyond CRC."
https://openalex.org/W3034940913,"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) provide state-of-the-art performances in a wide variety of tasks that require memory. These performances can often be achieved thanks to gated recurrent cells such as gated recurrent units (GRU) and long short-term memory (LSTM). Standard gated cells share a layer internal state to store information at the network level, and long term memory is shaped by network-wide recurrent connection weights. Biological neurons on the other hand are capable of holding information at the cellular level for an arbitrary long amount of time through a process called bistability. Through bistability, cells can stabilize to different stable states depending on their own past state and inputs, which permits the durable storing of past information in neuron state. In this work, we take inspiration from biological neuron bistability to embed RNNs with long-lasting memory at the cellular level. This leads to the introduction of a new bistable biologically-inspired recurrent cell that is shown to strongly improves RNN performance on time-series which require very long memory, despite using only cellular connections (all recurrent connections are from neurons to themselves, i.e. a neuron state is not influenced by the state of other neurons). Furthermore, equipping this cell with recurrent neuromodulation permits to link them to standard GRU cells, taking a step towards the biological plausibility of GRU. With this link, this work paves the way for studying more complex and biologically plausible neuromodulation schemes as gating mechanisms in RNNs."

Inadequate coverage of P&O services in the HBP is accordingly one of the leading reasons for this situation in many countries, including Iran.The main objective of this study was to find and prioritize solutions in order to facilitate and promote P&O services in the Iranian HBP.A mixed-methods (qualitative-quantitative) research design was employed in this study.This study was conducted in two phases. First, semi-structured interviews were undertaken to retrieve potential solutions. Then an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) reflecting on seven criteria of acceptability, effectiveness, time, cost, feasibility, burden of disease, and fairness was performed to prioritize them.In total, 26 individuals participated in semi-structured interviews and several policy solutions were proposed. Following the AHP, preventive interventions, infant-specific interventions, inpatient interventions, interventions until 6 years of age, and emergency interventions gained the highest priority to incorporate in the Iranian HBP.A number of policy solutions were explored and prioritized for P&O services in the Iranian HBP. Our findings provide a framework for decision- and policy-makers in Iran and other countries aiming to curb the financial burdens of P&O users, especially in vulnerable groups."

EuroQol-5 dimensions-5 levels (EQ-5D-5L) and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale- 21 items (DASS-21) were used to measure health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and mental health of participants, respectively. Among 712 secondary school students, the 3-month prevalence of physical, social aggression, verbal, and sexual bullying experience were 8.4%; 31.2%; 11.9%, and 2.7%, respectively. Being bullied were negatively associated with levels of classmates and family support, as well as levels of school security. Being overweight or obese was related to a higher likelihood of suffering social aggression compared to normal BMI. Being bullied was significantly associated with the decrement of HRQOL, and the increased risk of depression, anxiety, and stress among adolescents. Findings of this study suggested that holistic approaches involving family, peers, and schools, along with enhancing school security, are potential approaches to reduce the impact of bullying on adolescents' life and well-being."
https://openalex.org/W3171499407,"Sequential treatment with endocrine or chemotherapy is generally used in the treatment of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive recurrent breast cancer. To date, few studies have investigated the effect of long-term endocrine therapy on the response to subsequent chemotherapy in ER-positive breast cancer. We examined whether a preceding endocrine therapy affects the sensitivity to subsequent chemotherapy in ER-positive breast cancer cells. Three ER-positive breast cancer cell lines (T47D, MCF7, BT474) and tamoxifen-resistant sublines (T47D/T, MCF7/T, BT474/T) were analyzed for sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil, paclitaxel, and doxorubicin. The mRNA levels of factors related to drug sensitivity were analyzed by RT-PCR. MCF7/T cells became more sensitive to 5-fluorouracil than wild-type (wt)-MCF7 cells. In addition, the apoptosis induced by 5-fluorouracil was significantly increased in MCF7/T cells. However, no difference in sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents was observed in T47D/T and BT474/T cells compared with their wt cells. Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD) mRNA expression was significantly decreased in MCF7/T cells compared with wt-MCF7 cells. The expression of DPYD mRNA was restored with 5-azacytidine treatment in MCF7/T cells. In addition, DPYD 3'-UTR luciferase activity was significantly reduced in MCF7/T cells. These data indicated that the expression of DPYD mRNA was repressed by methylation of the DPYD promoter region and post-transcriptional regulation by miRNA in MCF7/T cells. In the mouse xenograft model, capecitabine significantly reduced the tumor volume in MCF7/T compared with MCF7. The results of this study indicate that endocrine therapy could alter the sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents in a subset of breast cancers, and 5-fluorouracil may be effective in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancers."
https://openalex.org/W3169732456,"Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF) play a key role in cancer progression and metastasis. Diminished TGFβ response on CAF correlates with poor outcome and recurrence in cancer patients. Mechanisms behind lost TGFβ signaling on CAF are poorly understood, but, utilizing MMTV-PyMT mouse model, we have previously demonstrated that in tumor microenvironment myeloid cells, producing adenosine, contribute to downregulated TGFβ signaling on CAFs. In the current work, we performed serial in vitro studies to investigate the role of adenosine/TGFβ axis in mouse mammary fibroblast functions, i.e., proliferation, protein expression, migration, and contractility. We found that adenosine analog NECA diminished TGFβ-induced CCL5 and MMP9 expression. Additionally, we discovered that NECA completely inhibited effect of TGFβ to upregulate αSMA, key protein of cytoskeletal rearrangements, necessary for migration and contractility of fibroblasts. Our results show that TGFβ increases contractility of mouse mammary fibroblasts and human fibroblast cell lines, and NECA attenuates theses effects. Using pharmacological approach and genetically modified animals, we determined that NECA effects on TGFβ pathway occur via A2A/A2B adenosine receptor-AC-PKA dependent manner. Using isolated CD11b+ cells from tumor tissue of CD73-KO and CD39-KO animals in co-culture experiments with ATP and AMP, we confirmed that myeloid cells can affect functions of mammary fibroblasts through adenosine signaling. Our data suggest a novel mechanism of interaction between adenosine and TGFβ signaling pathways that can impact phenotype of fibroblasts in a tumor microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W3172688856,"Rats ( Rattus norvegicus ) bred for research are typically confined with their litters until weaning, but will spend time away from pups when given the opportunity. We aimed to assess how dam welfare is affected by the ability to escape from their pups. Rat dams (n = 16) were housed in cages either with or without an elevated loft. We measured time dams spent in lofts, time spent nursing, and affective states using elevated plus maze and anticipatory behavior testing. We predicted that 1) dams housed with lofts would use them increasingly as pups aged, 2) dams without a loft would spend more time passively nursing (i.e. initiated by pups rather than the dam) and more total time nursing as pups aged, and 3) dams housed with lofts would show evidence of a more positive affective state. Dams housed with lofts spent more time in the loft with increasing pup age; dams spent on average (mean ± SE) 27 ± 5% of their time in the loft when pups were 1 wk old, increasing to 52 ± 5% of their time at 3 wks. When pups were 3 wks old, dams with lofts spent less time passively nursing (10 ± 2% of total time, compared to 27 ± 4% for dams without a loft) and less time nursing overall (36 ± 4% of time versus 59 ± 2% for dams without a loft). Rats without loft access showed increased anticipatory behavior potentially indicative of negative affective state (24.5±1.8 behaviors per minute in wk 3 compared to 18.8±1.0 in wk 1). These findings indicate that rat dams in laboratories choose to spend time away from their pups when provided the opportunity, particularly later in lactation; an inability to do so is associated with increased passive nursing and negative affect."
https://openalex.org/W3172767368,"Background Active parent participation in neonatal care and collaboration between parents and professionals during infant hospitalization in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is beneficial for infants and their parents. A tool is needed to support parents and to study the effects and implementation of parent-partnered models of neonatal care. Methods We developed and psychometrically evaluated a tool measuring active parent participation and collaboration in neonatal care within six domains: Daily Care , Medical Care , Acquiring Information , Parent Advocacy , Time Spent with Infant and Closeness and Comforting the Infant . Items were generated in focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with professionals and parents. The tool was completed at NICU-discharge by 306 parents (174 mothers and 132 fathers) of preterm infants. Subsequently, we studied structural validity with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), construct validity, using the Average Variance Extracted and Heterotrait-Monotrait ratio of correlations, and hypothesis testing with correlations and univariate linear regression. For internal consistency we calculated composite reliability (CR). We performed multiple imputations by chained equations for missing data. Results A 31 item tool for parent participation and collaboration in neonatal care was developed. CFA revealed high factor loadings of items within each domain. Internal consistency was 0.558 to 0.938. Convergent validity and discriminant validity were strong. Higher scores correlated with less parent depressive symptoms (r = -0.141, 95%CI -0.240; -0.029, p = 0.0141), less impaired parent-infant bonding (r = -0.196, 95%CI -0.302; -0.056, p&lt;0.0001), higher parent self-efficacy (r = 0.228, 95%CI 0.117; 0.332, p&lt;0.0001), and higher parent satisfaction (r = 0.197, 95%CI 0.090; 0.308, p = 0.001). Parents in a family integrated care model had higher scores than in standard care (beta 6.020, 95%CI 4.144; 7.895, p&lt;0.0001) and mothers scored higher than fathers (beta 2.103,95%CI 0.084; 4.121, p = 0.041). Conclusion The CO-PARTNER tool explicitly measures parents’ participation and collaboration with professionals in neonatal care incorporating their unique roles in care provision, leadership, and connection to their infant. The tool consists of 31 items within six domains with good face, content, construct and structural validity."
https://openalex.org/W3165996976,"Histone deacetylases (HDACs), especially HDAC2, play a role in alleviating liver fibrosis; however, the specific upstream regulation mechanism is unknown. Herein, TargetScan was used to predict the potential upstream targets of HDAC2, and the role of miR-455-3p was explored. The dual luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-455-3p binds to the 3ʹ UTR of HDAC2 mRNA. Additionally, miR-455-3p was downregulated in the liver tissues of patients with cirrhosis and mice with liver fibrosis, as well as in primary HSCs isolated from fibrotic mouse livers and TGF-β-treated LX-2 cells. In contrast, it is highly expressed in the reversal stage of hepatic fibrosis and MDI-cultured LX-2 cells. Our functional analyses showed that miR-455-3p overexpression facilitated apoptosis and reduced the expression of pro-fibrotic markers and the proliferation of activated LX-2 cells. On the contrary, miR-455-3p inhibition converted inactivated LX-2 cells into activated, proliferative, fibrogenic cells. Interestingly, restoration of HDAC2 expression partially blocked the function of miR-455-3p. Downregulated miR-455-3p expression can be restored by DNA methyltransferases in activated LX-2 cells. Methylation-specific PCR, bisulfite sequencing PCR, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that the methylation level of miR-455-3p promoter CpG islands was elevated in TGF-β-treated LX-2 cells and that miR-455-3p was downregulated in activated LX-2 cells by DNA hypermethylation, which is mediated by DNMT3b and DNMT1. In conclusion, miR-455-3p acts as a liver fibrosis suppressor by targeting HDAC2, and its deficiency further aggravates the reversal phase of fibrosis. Thus, the epigenetics mediated miR-455-3p/HDAC2 axis may serve as a novel potential therapeutic target for clinical treatment of hepatic fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W3171728965,"Inclusion of women in research on Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) has shown that gender differences contribute to unique profiles of cognitive, emotional, and neuropsychological dysfunction. We employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of abstinent individuals with a history of AUD (21 women [AUDw], 21 men [AUDm]) and demographically similar non-AUD control (NC) participants without AUD (21 women [NCw], 21 men [NCm]) to explore how gender and AUD interact to influence brain responses during emotional processing and memory. Participants completed a delayed match-to-sample emotional face memory fMRI task, and brain activation contrasts between a fixation stimulus and pictures of emotional face elicited a similar overall pattern of activation for all four groups. Significant Group by Gender interactions revealed two activation clusters. A cluster in an anterior portion of the middle and superior temporal gyrus, elicited lower activation to the fixation stimulus than to faces for the AUDw as compared to the NCw; that abnormality was more pronounced than the one observed for men. Another cluster in the medial portion of the superior frontal cortex elicited higher activation to the faces by AUDm than NCm, a difference that was more evident than the one observed for women. Together, these findings have added new evidence of AUD-related gender differences in neural responses to facial expressions of emotion."
https://openalex.org/W3166199659,"Diffuse optical tomography uses near-infrared light spectroscopy to measure changes in cerebral hemoglobin concentration. Anatomical interpretations of the location that generates the hemodynamic signal requires accurate descriptions of diffuse optical tomography sensitivity to the underlying cortical structures. Such information is limited for pediatric populations because they undergo rapid head and brain development. The present study used photon propagation simulation methods to examine diffuse optical tomography sensitivity profiles in realistic head models among infants ranging from 2 weeks to 24 months with narrow age bins, children (4 and 12 years) and adults (20 to 24 years). The sensitivity profiles changed systematically with the source-detector separation distance. The peak of the sensitivity function in the head was largest at the smallest separation distance and decreased as separation distance increased. The fluence value dissipated more quickly with sampling depth at the shorter source-detector separations than the longer separation distances. There were age-related differences in the shape and variance of sensitivity profiles across a wide range of source-detector separation distances. Our findings have important implications in the design of sensor placement and diffuse optical tomography image reconstruction in (functional) near-infrared light spectroscopy research. Age-appropriate realistic head models should be used to provide anatomical guidance for standalone near-infrared light spectroscopy data in infants."
https://openalex.org/W3171303049,"A 2013 article reported two experiments suggesting that the mere presence of a cellphone (vs. a notebook) can impair the relationship quality between strangers. The purpose of the present research is twofold: (1) closely replicate this article's findings, and (2) examine whether there may be an impact of the mere presence of a phone on creativity, whether at a group- or an individual- level. In two experiments (N = 356 participants, 136 groups), we followed the original procedure in the 2013 article. In particular, groups of participants who had never seen each other before the study had a conversation in the mere presence of either a smartphone or a notebook. The participants then carried out creative tasks, in groups (Studies 1 and 2) or alone (Study 1). In both studies, we failed to replicate the original results on relationship quality. We also failed to find any effect of the mere presence of a phone on creativity. We discuss possible reasons which may have caused differences between our results and the original ones. Our main conclusion is an effect of the mere presence of a phone on relationship quality and creativity is at minimum harder to find than what was previously assumed in the literature. More generally, this research contributes to qualify the view that smartphones are harmful."
https://openalex.org/W3166296737,"The circadian rhythm, called Process C, regulates a wide range of biological processes in humans including sleep, metabolism, body temperature, and hormone secretion. Light is the dominant synchronizer of the circadian rhythm-it has been used to regulate the circadian phase to cope with jet-lag, shift work, and sleep disorder. The homeostatic oscillation of the sleep drive is called Process S. Process C and Process S together determine the sleep-wake cycle in what is known as the two-process model. This paper addresses the regulation of both Process C and Process S by scheduling light exposure and sleep based on numerical simulations of circadian rhythm and sleep mathematical models. This is a significant step beyond the existing literature that only considers the entrainment of Process C. Regulation of the two-process model poses several unique features and challenges: 1. Process S is non-smooth, i.e., the homeostatic dynamics are different in the sleep and wake regimes; 2. Light only indirectly affects Process S through Process C; 3. Light does not affect Process C during sleep. We consider two scenarios: optimizing light intensity as the control input with spontaneous (i.e., unscheduled) sleep/wake times and jointly optimizing the light intensity and the sleep/wake times, which allows limited delayed sleep and early waking as part of the decision variables. We solve the time-optimal entrainment problem for the two-process model for both scenarios using an extension of the gradient descent algorithm to non-smooth systems. To illustrate the efficacy of our time-optimal entrainment strategies, we consider two common use cases: transmeridian travelers and shift workers. For transmeridian travelers, joint optimization of the two-process model avoids the unrealistic long wake duration when only Process C is considered. The entrainment time also decreases when both the light input and the sleep schedule are optimized compared to when only the light input is optimized. For shift workers, we show that the entrainment time is significantly shortened by optimizing the night shift working light."
https://openalex.org/W3167011912,"Mixing gestating sows implies hierarchy formation and has detrimental consequences on welfare. The effects of social stress on the most vulnerable individuals may be underestimated and it is therefore important to evaluate welfare between individuals within groups. This study aimed at investigating the impact of social status and previous experience in the group on well-being of sows housed in large semi-static groups. We assessed aggression (d0 (mixing), d2, d27, d29), body lesions (d1, d26, d84) and feeding order on 20 groups of 46-91 animals. Social status was based on the proportion of fights won during a 6-hr observation period between d0 and d2. Dominants (29%) were those who won more fights than they lost, Subdominants (25%) won fewer fights than they lost, Losers (23%) never won any fight in which they were involved while Avoiders (23%) were never involved in fights. Resident sows (70%) were already present in the group in the previous gestation while New sows (30%) were newly introduced at mixing. Subdominants and Dominants were highly involved in fights around mixing but this was more detrimental for Subdominants than Dominants, Losers and Avoiders since they had the highest body lesion scores at mixing. Avoiders received less non-reciprocal agonistic acts than Losers on d2 (P = 0.0001) and had the lowest body lesion scores after mixing. However, Avoiders and Losers were more at risk in the long-term since they had the highest body lesions scores at d26 and d84. They were followed by Subdominants and then Dominants. New sows fought more (P<0.0001), tended to be involved in longer fights (P = 0.075) around mixing and had more body lesions throughout gestation than Resident sows. Feeding order from one-month post-mixing was influenced both by the previous experience in the group and social status (P<0.0001). New sows, especially with a low social status, are more vulnerable throughout gestation and could serve as indicators of non-optimal conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3167061421,"Objective To investigate the association between the nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kB ) gene polymorphism and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in a high-altitude population. Methods Fifty-five patients with AMD and 57 control subjects were recruited from the Qinghai Provincial People’s Hospital, China. Genomic DNA was extracted from the blood sample of each participant. Four NF-kB polymorphisms (rs3774959, rs3774932, rs3774937, and rs230526) were genotyped using a MassARRAY system. The genotype and allele frequencies were compared between the case and control groups using the chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test. Results There was no significant difference in sex, age, hypertension, diabetes, blood lipid level or smoking and drinking status between the AMD and control groups ( P &gt; 0.05). The genotype distributions of four NF-kB polymorphisms were in accordance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the control group ( P &gt; 0.05). The frequencies of genotype AA of rs3774932 and genotype CC of rs3774937 were nominally significantly higher in the AMD group than in the control group ( P = 0.046 and 0.023, respectively), although these associations did not survive the Bonferroni correction (corrected P &gt; 0.05). Genotype distributions of rs3774959 and rs230526 were not significantly different between the two groups ( P = 0.08 and 0.16, respectively). No significant difference in the allele frequencies of the four polymorphisms was found between the AMD and control groups ( P &gt; 0.05). Conclusions Genotype AA of rs3774932 and genotype CC of rs3774937 in NF-kB might be risk factors for AMD."

Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), as a molecular sponge, participates in the regulation of competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA). We aimed to construct a ceRNA network and screened out possible lncRNAs to predict KIRC prognosis.All KIRC data were downloaded from the TCGA database and screened to find the possible target lncRNA; a ceRNA network was designed. Next, GO functional enrichment and KEGG pathway of differentially expressed mRNA related to lncRNA were performed. We used Kaplan-Meier curve analysis to predict the survival of these RNAs. We used Cox regression analysis to construct a model to predict KIRC prognosis.In the KIRC datasets, 1457 lncRNA, 54 miRNA and 2307 mRNA were screened out. The constructed ceRNA network contained 81 lncRNAs, nine miRNAs, and 17 mRNAs differentially expressed in KIRC. Survival analysis of all differentially expressed RNAs showed that 21 lncRNAs, four miRNAs, and two mRNAs were related to the overall survival rate. Cox regression analysis was performed again, and we found that eight lncRNAs were related to prognosis and used to construct predictive models. Three lnRNAs from independent samples were meaningful.The construction of ceRNA network was involved in the process and transfer of KIRC, and three lncRNAs may be potential targets for predicting KIRC prognosis."

Internet of Things (IoT) started to appear in many fields, such as health care and smart cities. A few years later, IoT was supported by industry, leading to what is called Industry 4.0. In this paper, a cloud-assisted fog-networking architecture is implemented in an IoT environment with a three-layer network. An efficient energy and completion time for dependent task computation offloading (ET-DTCO) algorithm is proposed, and it considers two quality-of-service (QoS) parameters: efficient energy and completion time offloading for dependent tasks in Industry 4.0. The proposed solution employs the Firefly algorithm to optimize the process of the selection-offloading computing mode and determine the optimal solution for performing tasks locally or offloaded to a fog or cloud considering the task dependency. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is compared with existing techniques. Simulation results proved that the proposed ET-DTCO algorithm outperforms other offloading algorithms in minimizing energy consumption and completion time while enhancing the overall efficiency of the system."
https://openalex.org/W3166345695,"Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is one of the major complications of diabetes due to an impairment in angiogenesis. Since there is currently no drug with satisfactory efficacy to enhance blood vessel formation, discovering therapies to improve angiogenesis is critical. An imidazolinone metabolite of the metformin-methylglyoxal scavenging reaction, (E)-1,1-dimethyl-2-(5-methyl-4-oxo-4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl) guanidine (IMZ), was recently characterized and identified in the urine of type-2 diabetic patients. Here, we report the pro-angiogenesis effect of IMZ (increased aortic sprouting, cell migration, network formation, and upregulated multiple pro-angiogenic factors) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we showed that IMZ augmented angiogenesis by activating the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)/hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) pathway. Furthermore, IMZ significantly promoted capillary density in the in vivo Matrigel plug angiogenesis model. Finally, the role of IMZ in post-ischemic angiogenesis was examined in a chronic hyperglycemia mouse model subjected to hind limb ischemia. We observed improved blood perfusion, increased capillary density, and reduced tissue necrosis in mice receiving IMZ compared to control mice. Our data demonstrate the pro-angiogenic effects of IMZ, its underlying mechanism, and provides a structural basis for the development of potential pro-angiogenic agents for the treatment of PAD."
https://openalex.org/W3167417009,"Cognitive impairment is a common symptom in individuals with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), but meaningful, reliable biomarkers relating to cognitive decline have been elusive, making evaluation of the impact of therapeutics on cognitive function difficult. Here, we combine pathway-based MRI measures of structural and functional connectivity to construct a metric of functional decline in MS. The Structural and Functional Connectivity Index (SFCI) is proposed as a simple, z-scored metric of structural and functional connectivity, where changes in the metric have a simple statistical interpretation and may be suitable for use in clinical trials. Using data collected at six time points from a 2-year longitudinal study of 20 participants with MS and 9 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, we probe two common symptomatic domains, motor and cognitive function, by measuring structural and functional connectivity in the transcallosal motor pathway and posterior cingulum bundle. The SFCI is significantly lower in participants with MS compared to controls (p = 0.009) and shows a significant decrease over time in MS (p = 0.012). The change in SFCI over two years performed favorably compared to measures of brain parenchymal fraction and lesion volume, relating to follow-up measures of processing speed (r = 0.60, p = 0.005), verbal fluency (r = 0.57, p = 0.009), and score on the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (r = 0.67, p = 0.003).

The aim of this paper is to describe the fruit and vegetables consumption habits of adolescents in Dhaka, Bangladesh as well as to identify the socio-environmental, personal, and behavioral factors that influence these habits.The baseline data from an intervention study involving 823 grade ten students from two randomly selected secondary schools in a semi-urban area of Dhaka were analyzed. The intake of fruit and vegetables was measured in terms of serving size per day. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to assess the ability of socio-environmental factors such as social support, perceived barriers, and living with patient with chronic diseases; personal factors such as knowledge, self-rated practice, behavioral intention, and body mass index; and behavioral factors such as physical activity, sedentary hours, and sleep duration to predict the level of daily fruit and vegetables intake, after controlling the effect of demographic characteristics of adolescents.The average daily consumption of fruit and vegetables was 1.22 and 1.99 servings, respectively. Only one-fifth of the respondents (21%) reported eating five servings of fruit and vegetables a day. Inaccessibility at home was reported as the most perceived barrier for both fruit and vegetables intake. Adolescents' higher fruit and vegetables intake was found to be associated with higher maternal educational attainment, more social support, adequate self-rated practice, positive behavioral intention, higher body mass index, better physical activity, and adequate daily sleeping.The findings revealed insufficient fruit and vegetables intake among adolescents in a semi-urban area of Bangladesh and associated socio-environmental, personal, and behavioral factors that were utilized in developing an intervention program for this transient age group.Trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03975335) https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03975335 on June 01, 2019."
https://openalex.org/W3171767730,"One of the most widely used evaluation methods in miRNA experiments is qRT-PCR. However, selecting suitable internal controls (IC) is crucial for qRT-PCR experiments. Currently, there is no consensus on the ICs for miRNA qRT-PCR experiments in breast cancer. To this end, we tried to identify the most stable (the least expression alteration) and promising miRNAs in normal and tumor breast tissues by employing TCGA miRNA-Seq data and then experimentally validated them on fresh clinical samples.A multi-component scoring system was used which takes into account multiple expression stability criteria as well as correlation with clinical characteristics. Furthermore, we extended the scoring system for more than two biological sub-groups. TCGA BRCA samples were analyzed based on two grouping criteria: Tumor & Normal samples and Tumor subtypes. The top 10 most stable miRNAs were further investigated by differential expression and survival analysis. Then, we examined the expression level of the top scored miRNA (hsa-miR-361-5p) along with two commonly used ICs hsa-miR-16-5p and U48 on 34 pairs of Primary breast tumor and their adjacent normal tissues using qRT-PCR.According to our multi-component scoring system, hsa-miR-361-5p had the highest stability score in both grouping criteria and hsa-miR-16-5p showed significantly lower scores. Based on our qRT-PCR assay, while U48 was the most abundant IC, hsa-miR-361-5p had lower standard deviation and also was the only IC capable of detecting a significant up-regulation of hsa-miR-21-5p in breast tumor tissue.miRNA-Seq data is a great source to discover stable ICs. Our results demonstrated that hsa-miR-361-5p is a highly stable miRNA in tumor and non-tumor breast tissue and we recommend it as a suitable reference gene for miRNA expression studies in breast cancer. Additionally, although hsa-miR-16-5p is a commonly used IC, it's not a suitable one for breast cancer studies."

S. aureus colonization was confirmed using cultures. Participants had specimens taken from nose and throat for S. aureus quantitation using quantitative PCR for the nuc gene and bacterial profiling using 16S rRNA gene sequencing over 12 weeks. After two baseline study visits 4 weeks apart, participants received intranasal mupirocin for 5 days with 3 further visits over a 8 week follow-up period.We found a decrease in the absolute abundance of S. aureus in the nose for 8 weeks after mupirocin (1693 vs 141 fg/ul, p = 0.047). Mupirocin caused a statistically significant disruption in bacterial communities of the nose and throat after 1 week, which was no longer detected after 8 weeks. Bacterial community profiling demonstrated that there was a decrease in the relative abundance of S. aureus (8% vs 0.3%, p<0.01) 8 weeks after mupirocin and a transient decrease in the relative abundance of Staphylococcus epidermidis in the nose (21% vs 5%, p<0.01) 1 week after mupirocin.Decolonization with mupirocin leads to a sustained effect on absolute and relative abundance of S. aureus but not for other bacteria in the nose. This demonstrates that a short course of mupirocin selectively decreases S. aureus in the nose for up to 8 weeks."
https://openalex.org/W3166063135,"To achieve global ambitions in large scale ecological restoration, there is a need for approaches that improve the efficiency of seed-based interventions, particularly in overcoming the bottleneck in the transition from germination to seedling establishment. In this study, we tested a novel seed-based application of the plant stress modulator compound salicylic acid as a means to reduce seedling losses in the seed-to-seedling phase. Seed coating technology (encrusting) was developed as a precursor for optimising field sowing for three grass species commonly used in restoration programs, Austrostipa scabra, Microlaena stipoides, and Rytidosperma geniculatum. Salicylic acid (SA, 0.1mM) was delivered to seeds via imbibition and seed encrusting. The effects of SA on seed germination were examined under controlled water-limited conditions (drought resilience) in laboratory setting and on seed germination, seedling emergence, seedling growth and plant survival in field conditions. Salicylic acid did not impact germination under water stress in controlled laboratory conditions and did not affect seedling emergence in the field. However, seedling survival and growth were improved in plants grown from SA treated seeds (imbibed and encrusted) under field conditions. When SA delivery methods of imbibing and coating were compared, there was no significant difference in survival and growth, showing that seed coating has potential to deliver SA. Effect of intraspecific competition as a result of seedling density was also considered. Seedling survival over the dry summer season was more than double at low seedling density (40 plants/m2) compared to high seedling density (380 plants/m2). Overall, adjustment of seeding rate according to expected emergence combined with the use of salicylic acid via coating could improve seed use efficiency in seed-based restoration."
https://openalex.org/W3166884577,"Ultraviolet irradiation (UV) exposure is the leading factor underlying the development of skin malignancies. D-dopachrome tautomerase (D-DT), a functional homolog of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), has functional similarities to MIF. However, its role, unlike the role of MIF in photocarcinogenesis, is unknown. We therefore explored the role of D-DT in photocarcinogenesis by developing D-DT transgenic (D-DT Tg) mice and provided a research model for future studies targeting D-DT. Chronic UVB exposure accelerated tumor development in D-DT Tg mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice, with a higher incidence of tumors observed in D-DT Tg mice than in WT mice. In D-DT Tg irradiated mouse keratinocytes, the p53, PUMA, and Bax expression was lower than that in WT mice. These results indicate that D-DT Tg overexpression confers prevention against UVB-induced apoptosis in keratinocytes. Taken together, these findings support D-DT as a functionally important cytokine in photocarcinogenesis and potential therapeutic target for the prevention of photocarcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3168060653,"Acetaminophen, aspirin, and ibuprofen are mild analgesics commonly used by pregnant women, the sole current recommendation being to avoid ibuprofen from the fifth month of gestation. The nephrotoxicity of these three analgesics is well documented in adults, as is their interference with prostaglandins biosynthesis. Here we investigated the effect of these analgesics on human first trimester kidneys ex vivo. We first evaluated prostaglandins biosynthesis functionality by performing a wide screening of prostaglandin expression patterns in first trimester human kidneys. We demonstrated that prostaglandins biosynthesis machinery is functional during early nephrogenesis. Human fetal kidney explants aged 7-12 developmental weeks were exposed ex vivo to ibuprofen, aspirin or acetaminophen for 7 days, and analyzed by histology, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry. This study has revealed that these analgesics induced a spectrum of abnormalities within early developing structures, ranging from cell death to a decline in differentiating glomeruli density. These results warrant caution for the use of these medicines during the first trimester of pregnancy."

Overall, HRQoL was good: mean (SD) CHQ-PF50 physical summary score = 50.8 (11.1), psychosocial summary score = 49.3 (9.1) [normative mean 50 (10)]; HUI-2 dead-healthy scale = 0.92 (0.09) [maximum 1.0]. Neurodevelopmental impairment, lower gestational age, and higher socio-economic deprivation were all associated with reduced HRQoL. However, on multivariable analysis, only intelligence quotient and motor function were associated with psychosocial HRQoL, while intelligence quotient was associated with physical HRQoL.Most seven-year-old children born very and extremely preterm have good HRQoL. Further improvements will require reduced neurodevelopmental impairment."
https://openalex.org/W3169274816,"Income polarization is a pressing issue which is increasingly discussed by academics and policymakers. The present research examines income polarization in Canada's eight largest Census Metropolitan Areas (CMAs) using data at the census-tract (CT) level between 1971 and 2016. Generally, there are significant decreasing trends in the middle-income population with simultaneously increasing trends in low-income groups. The high-income groups have been relatively stable with fewer significant increasing population trends. Using conventional mapping and cartograms, patterns of the spatial evolution of income inequality are illustrated. Every CMA examined contains an increasing trend of spatial fragmentation at the patch level within each CMA's landscape mosaic. The results of a spatial autocorrelation analysis at the sub-patch, CT level, exhibit significant spatial clustering of high-income CTs as one process that dominates the increasingly fragmented landscape mosaic."
https://openalex.org/W3170088165,"Background The Eliminate Hepatitis C San Diego County Initiative was established to provide a roadmap to reduce new HCV infections by 80% and HCV-related deaths by 65% by 2030. An estimate of the burden of HCV infections in San Diego County is necessary to inform planning and evaluation efforts. Our analysis was designed to estimate the HCV burden in San Diego County in 2018. Methods We synthesized data from the American Community Survey, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, California Department of Public Health, Public Health Branch of California Correctional Health Care Services, San Diego Blood Bank, and published literature. Burden estimates were stratified by subgroup (people who inject drugs in the community [PWID], men who have sex with men in the community [MSM], general population in the community [stratified by age and sex], and incarcerated individuals). To account for parameter uncertainty, 100,000 parameter sets were sampled from each parameter’s uncertainty distribution, and used to calculate the mean and 95% confidence interval estimates of the number of HCV seropositive adults in San Diego in 2018. Findings We found there were 55,354 (95% CI: 25,411–93,329) adults with a history of HCV infection in San Diego County in 2018, corresponding to an HCV seroprevalence of 2.1% (95% CI: 1.1–3.4%). Over 40% of HCV infections were among the general population aged 55–74 and one-third were among PWID. Conclusion Our study found that the largest share of infections was among adults aged 55–74, indicating the importance of surveillance, prevention, testing, and linkages to care in this group to reduce mortality. Further, programs prioritizing PWID for increased HCV testing and linkage to care are important for reducing new HCV infections."
https://openalex.org/W3171084804,"Caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) or pseudotuberculosis is a chronic zoonotic bacterial disease caused by Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, which affects livestock and humans. This study aimed to describe the pathology, bacteriology and confirm the identity of the pathogen by 16S rRNA gene sequencing in Camelus dromedarius. A total of 12 camels with suspected CLA in three regions of Abu Dhabi Emirate (Abu Dhabi, Al Ain and Al Dhafra), United Arab Emirate (UAE) were subjected to clinical and postmortem examinations from January 2015 to December 2020. Clinically, camels were emaciated and showed the presence of external caseous abscesses suggestive of CLA. Postmortem examination showed multiple abscesses of variable sizes with caseous material encapsulated by fibrous tissue in the liver, lungs, muscle, and lymph nodes. Following clinical and postmortem examination, blood, pus and different tissue samples were collected for subsequent analysis. Histopathological examination of all organs stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) indicated a central caseo-necrotic core that was admixed with bacterial colonies and infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells, surrounded by a pyogenic membrane, and an outer fibrous connective tissue capsule. Bacterial culture identified the isolates of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis biotype ovis strain, and these isolates were shown to be sensitive to all antibiotics tested (penicillin, ampicillin, Co-trimoxazole, enrofloxacin and tetracycline). Moreover, the identity of the isolates was confirmed by partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene which showed a 100% identity to Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence clearly differentiates Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis from other species of Corynebacterium. Briefly, this study provided the basic information for infection of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis in Camels and will help in controlling of this pathogen in the region."
https://openalex.org/W3171990550,"ETV6/RUNX1 gene fusion is the most common chromosomal translocation abnormality occurred in pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Compared with ETV6-RUNX1-negative patients, ETV6-RUNX1-positive patients possess more improved treatment strategies but higher risk to relapse. In this research, the potential gene interaction networks were constructed intending for elucidating the pathogenesis of B-ALL. We performed the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to assess the involvement of lncRNA-mRNA pairs in B-ALL patients consisting of 24 ETV6-RUNX1-positive patients and 18 ETV6-RUNX1-negative patients and found a module that was significantly associated with positive/negative trait. Gene Ontology analysis showed that mRNAs in this module were enriched in the positive regulation of MAPK cascade, positive regulation of JNK cascade, and myeloid cell differentiation pathway. To further investigate the relationship between lncRNAs and mRNAs in this significant module, we constructed the lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network. 3 lncRNAs (RP11-170J3.2, RP11-135F9.1 and RP1-151B14.9) were found at the core of the lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network, which had the most co-expression connections with mRNAs. And several related mRNAs (ACTN1, TNFRSF21 and NLRP3) had a significant correlation with the patient survival prediction. Our findings may explicate the pathogenesis of B-ALL, and the disease-associated genes could provide clues to find novel biomarkers for prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W3166553880,"Assembly of the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin (FN) into insoluble, viscoelastic fibrils is a critical step during embryonic development and wound healing; misregulation of FN fibril assembly has been implicated in many diseases, including fibrotic diseases and cancer. We have previously developed a computational model of FN fibril assembly that recapitulates the morphometry and mechanics of cell-derived FN fibrils. Here we use this model to probe two important questions: how is FN fibril formation affected by the contractile phenotype of the cell, and how is FN fibril formation affected by the stiffness of the surrounding tissue? We show that FN fibril formation depends strongly on the contractile phenotype of the cell, but only weakly on in vitro substrate stiffness, which is an analog for in vivo tissue stiffness. These results are consistent with previous experimental data and provide a better insight into conditions that promote FN fibril assembly. We have also investigated two distinct phenotypes of FN fibrils that we have previously identified; we show that the ratio of the two phenotypes depends on both substrate stiffness and contractile phenotype, with intermediate contractility and high substrate stiffness creating an optimal condition for stably stretched fibrils. Finally, we have investigated how re-stretch of a fibril affects cellular response. We probed how the contractile phenotype of the re-stretching cell affects the mechanics of the fibril; results indicate that the number of myosin motors only weakly affects the cellular response, but increasing actin velocity results in a decrease in the apparent stiffness of the fibril and a decrease in the stably-applied force to the fibril. Taken together, these results give novel insights into the combinatorial effects of substrate stiffness and cell contractility on FN fibril assembly."
https://openalex.org/W3167142912,"The risk factors that contribute to future functional disability after heart failure (HF) are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to determine potential risk factors to future functional disability after HF in the general older adult population in Japan.The subjects who were community-dwelling older adults aged 65 or older without a history of cardiovascular diseases and functional disability were followed in this prospective study for 11 years. Two case groups were determined from the 4,644 subjects: no long-term care insurance (LTCI) after HF (n = 52) and LTCI after HF (n = 44). We selected the controls by randomly matching each case of HF with three of the remaining 4,548 subjects who were event-free during the period: those with no LTCI and no HF with age +/-1 years and of the same sex, control for the no LTCI after HF group (n = 156), and control for the LTCI after HF group (n = 132). HF was diagnosed according to the Framingham diagnostic criteria. Individuals with a functional disability were those who had been newly certified by the LTCI during the observation period. Objective data including blood samples and several socioeconomic items in the baseline survey were assessed using a self-reported questionnaire.Significantly associated risk factors were lower educational levels (odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 3.72 [1.63-8.48]) in the LTCI after HF group and hypertension (2.20 [1.10-4.43]) in no LTCI after HF group. Regular alcohol consumption and unmarried status were marginally significantly associated with LTCI after HF (OR [95% CI]; drinker = 2.69 [0.95-7.66]; P = 0.063; unmarried status = 2.54 [0.91-7.15]; P = 0.076).Preventive measures must be taken to protect older adults with unfavorable social factors from disability after HF via a multidisciplinary approach."
https://openalex.org/W3172814098,"The study compared the prevalence of the Val66Met Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor single nucleotide polymorphism (rs6265) in a sample of musicians (N = 50) to an ethnically matched general population sample from the 1000 Human Genome Project (N = 424). Met-carriers of the polymorphism (Val/Met and Met/Met genotypes) are typically present in 25-30% of the general population and have associated deficits in motor learning and plasticity. Many studies have assessed the benefits of long-term music training for neuroplasticity and motor learning. This study takes a unique genetic approach investigating if the prevalence of the Val66Met BDNF polymorphism, which negatively affects motor learning, is significantly different in musicians from the general population. Our genotype and allele frequency analyses revealed that the distribution of the Val66Met polymorphism was not significantly different in musicians versus the general population (p = 0.6447 for genotype analysis and p = 0.8513 allele analysis). In the Musician sample (N = 50), the prevalence of the Val/Met genotype was 40% and the prevalence of the Met/Met genotype was 2%. In the 1000 Human Genome Project subset (N = 424), the prevalence of Val/Met was 33.25% and the Met/Met genotype prevalence was 4%. Therefore, musicians do exist with the Val66Met polymorphism and the characteristics of long-term music training may compensate for genetic predisposition to motor learning deficits. Since the polymorphism has significant implications for stroke rehabilitation, future studies may consider the implications of the polymorphism in music-based interventions such as Neurologic Music Therapy."
