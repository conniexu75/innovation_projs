https://openalex.org/W1524114372,"Acidic ethanol extracts of human platelets induced non-neoplastic normal rat kidney fibroblasts to undergo anchorage-independent growth. Less than 100 ng/ml of the crude extract elicits 50% of the maximal biological response when assayed in the presence of epidermal growth factor (2.5 ng/ml). In the absence of epidermal growth factor, the potency of the extract decreased 1,000-fold. These results show that platelets contain a type beta transforming growth factor. The specific activity of the platelet extract is 100-fold greater than that of other non-neoplastic tissues. The growth factor was purified to homogeneity by sequential gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-60 columns, first in the absence and then in the presence of urea. As determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, this transforming growth factor-beta is a protein of 25,000 daltons. It is composed of two 12,500-dalton subunits held together by disulfide bonds. These results, as well as its amino acid composition and its lack of strong mitogenic activity, show that this protein is distinct from platelet-derived growth factor. When completely purified, transforming growth factor-beta elicits 50% of its maximal biological response at concentrations less than 5 x 10(-12) M."
https://openalex.org/W2070558900,"Several isolates of a human type-C retrovirus belonging to one group, known as human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV), have previously been obtained from patients with adult T-cell leukemia or lymphoma. The T-cell tropism of HTLV and its prevalence in the Caribbean basin prompted a search for it in patients with the epidemic T-cell immune deficiency disorder known as AIDS. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from one patient in the United States and two in France were cultured with T-cell growth factor (TCGF) an shown to express HTLV antigens. Virus from the U.S. patient was isolated and characterized and shown to be related to HTLV subgroup I. The virus was also transmitted into normal human T cells from umbilical cord blood of a newborn. Whether or not HTLV-I or other retroviruses of this family with T-cell tropism cause AIDS, it is possible that patients from whom the virus can be isolated can also transmit it to others. If the target cell of AIDS is the mature T cell as suspected, the methods used in these studies may prove useful for the long-term growth of these cells and for the identification of antigens specific for the etiological agent of AIDS."

Both soluble and particulate cytoplasmic constituents are required to initiate these processes in vitro. The observed changes resemble processes occurring during fertilization and the mitotic cycle in early amphibian embryos. Therefore, this cell-free system may be useful in biochemical analysis of the interactions of nucleus and cytoplasm that control nuclear behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2038682313,"Nine new isolates of human T-cell leukemia-lymphoma virus (HTLV) were obtained from cells of seven patients with malignancies of mature T cells and from two clinically normal relatives of a T-cell leukemia patient. These people were from the United States, Israel, the West Indies, and Japan. The virus was detected in the fresh T cells and was isolated from the established T-cell lines. Each isolate is closely related to the first HTLV isolate, and all the new HTLV isolates were transmitted into normal human T cells obtained from the umbilical cord blood of newborns."
https://openalex.org/W1583664424,"The effects of the lectins concanavalin A, succinylated concanavalin A, and wheat germ agglutinin on the free cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration in mouse thymocytes were measured using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator (Tsien, R. Y. (1980) Biochemistry 19, 2396-2404) and compared with the metabolic and mitogenic effects of the lectins on the cells. Within 1 min of adding each ligand, there is a dose-dependent increase in the free cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration reported by quin 2. This response is selective for Ca2+, but it does not coincide closely with the subsequent mitogenic stimulation at 48 h by concanavalin A or succinyl concanavalin A. The nonmitogenic lectin wheat germ agglutinin also causes an increase in free cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration and early metabolic stimulation of the cells, but stimulation is self-aborted before DNA synthesis occurs. At the intracellular concentrations of quin 2 required for measurement of the free Ca2+ concentration, the chelator causes early metabolic stimulation of the cells very similar to that produced by concanavalin A and the mitogenic Ca2+ ionophore A23187. Thus, phosphatidylinositol metabolism and lactate production are stimulated in mouse thymocytes and pig lymphocytes within 1 h of loading with quin 2 and significant increases in RNA synthesis occur after 8 h. Quin 2 causes mitogenic stimulation of pig lymphocytes measured as increased [3H]thymidine uptake at 48 h, that is variable but substantial in most experiments (up to 100% of the stimulation by A23187). The chelator itself has no significant activity as a Ca2+ ionophore, but the apparent free Ca2+ concentration in the cells increases both with the concentration of intracellular quin 2 and with the extracellular Ca2+ concentration. These data leave open the possibility that quin 2 itself affects the concentration of free Ca2+ or other cations in the cells."

The mRNA is unexpectedly large, about 4750 nucleotide bases, and predicts the sequence of preproEGF, a protein of 1217 amino acids (133,000 molecular weight). The EGF moiety (53 amino acids) is flanked by polypeptide segments of 976 and 188 amino acids at its amino and carboyxl termini, respectively. The amino terminal segment of the precursor contains seven peptides with sequences that are similar but not identical to EGF."

Human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) is associated with T-cell malignancies and can transform T lymphocytes in vitro. In an attempt to find evidence of HTLV infection in patients with AIDS, DNA from samples of peripheral blood lymphocytes from 33 AIDS patients was analyzed by Southern blot-hybridization with a radiolabeled cloned HTLV DNA probe. Analysis of DNA from both the fresh (uncultured) lymphocytes and from T cells cultured with T-cell growth factor revealed the presence of integrated HTLV proviral sequences in lymphocytes from two of the patients, both of whom had antibody to HTLV. The proviral sequences could not be detected in blood samples obtained from these individuals at a later date, consistent with the possibility that the population of infected cells had become depleted."
https://openalex.org/W2073332524,"Borna virus replicated persistently in the brains of rats, causing frenzied and apathetic behavioral states in sequence but no mortality. The transient frenzied behavior was caused by an immune-mediated, cytolytic, encephalitic response that was unexpectedly self-limiting. Cessation of active pathological processes coincided with the onset of the passive phase of the disease. This study thus demonstrates suppression of virus-specific inflammation despite continuous viral replication and describes a new mechanism by which chronic encephalitis may become established."

https://openalex.org/W2030000344,Centrally administered alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone is much more potent in reducing fever than the widely used antipyretic acetaminophen. This finding supports the hypothesis that the endogenous neuropeptide has a role in the limitation of fever and suggests that it may be clinically useful as an antipyretic.
https://openalex.org/W1503860336,von Willebrand protein subunit is first synthesized by human endothelial cells as a larger precursor of 260-kDa that is slowly cleaved to its 220-kDa form. Both the precursor and the finished product are glycosylated. Small amounts of uncleaved precursor are secreted into the culture media. Disulfide bonded polymers typical for von Willebrand protein are also formed inside the cells. In comparison to fibronectin the biosynthetic processing of von Willebrand protein is longer as a delay in secretion is observed. The presence of a higher cellular pool of von Willebrand protein as compared to fibronectin indicates a storage compartment for von Willebrand protein in the endothelial cells.

https://openalex.org/W1598727792,"The hexapeptides AcSer-Glu-Glu-Glu-Val-Glu and Ser-Glu-Glu-Glu-Glu-Glu, reminiscent of the sites phosphorylated by type-2 casein kinase TS in troponin T and glycogen synthase, respectively, have been synthesized and tested as phosphorylatable substrates for casein kinase TS as well as for other protein kinases. Both peptides are readily phosphorylated by casein kinase TS but not, to any detectable extent, by either cAMP-dependent protein kinase or phosphorylase kinase. Phosphorylation by type-1 casein kinase S was almost negligible. On the other hand the hexapeptide Ser-Glu-Glu-Glu-Ala-Ala is phosphorylated much more slowly and the hexapeptide Ser-Glu-Glu-Ala-Ala-Ala is almost unaffected by casein kinase TS. While the Vmax values of casein kinase TS with the acidic hexapeptides are comparable to those obtained with the corresponding protein substrates, the apparent Km values for the peptides are about two orders of magnitude higher than those for the protein substrates. The heptapeptide Arg-Ser-Glu-Glu-Glu-Val-Glu is a very poor substrate of casein kinase TS in comparison with the corresponding hexapeptide lacking the N-terminal Arg; it is, however, a competitive inhibitor toward the protein substrates, exhibiting a Ki similar to those of Ser-Glu-Glu-Glu-Glu-Glu and (Glu)5 which, in turn, are one order of magnitude higher than that of (Glu)10. It is concluded that the minimum structural requirement of type-2 casein kinases consists of a phosphorylatable residue followed by an acidic cluster, whose length is critical for the binding to the enzyme. Additional residues on the N-terminal side are not required, but their nature can influence the transphosphorylation reaction considerably."
https://openalex.org/W1607854632,"Development of a sensitive radioimmunoassay for the vitamin K-dependent bone protein osteocalcin in avian species has provided new information on the biosynthesis of this protein in bone. Chicken osteocalcin shares many structural features, including the sequence positions of its 3 gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) residues, with osteocalcins of human, monkey, cow, and rat, but is cryptic in the radioimmunoassays for these species. In the chicken assay system, the intact 50-residue (Mr = 5670) protein is required for immunoreactivity. Reduction and alkylation of the disulfide bond (Cys 23-Cys 29) or tryptic removal of the COOH-terminal pentapeptide abolish antibody binding activity. Decarboxylation of the 3 Gla residues enhances the affinity for antibody by 1.5- to 2-fold. Osteocalcin appears coincident with the very earliest detectable perichondral mineralization in developing long bone (tibiotarsus) of the 7- to 8-day-old chick embryo (stages 31-33). However, amino acid analysis demonstrates an excess of Gla in embryonic bone compared to the level of osteocalcin by radioimmunoassay. Two independent experimental approaches have partially resolved this paradox. First, extraction and gel filtration in 4 M guanidine hydrochloride of total bone proteins has revealed high molecular weight species which share antigenic determinants with osteocalcin, namely, 10,000 (+/- 1,000), 15,000 (+/- 2,000), 35,000 (+/- 5,000), and 85,000 (+/- 15,000), in addition to 5,670 osteocalcin. Second, a selective 3H exchange labeling procedure for Gla residues has revealed Gla-containing proteins in bone in the same molecular weight classes. One or more of these may represent precursors in the biosynthetic pathway for osteocalcin."

The leopard frog, Rana pipiens, has a class of neurons in the central auditory system that respond selectively to particular rates of amplitude modulation; these neurons can be characterized by a temporal tuning curve. Such selectivity is absent in the peripheral auditory system. This type of transformation may be fundamental in processing temporal information in the vertebrate sensory nervous system."

Cytological application of molecular probes to three lineages, those responsible for the formation of the skeleton, the gut, and the aboral ectodermal wall of the late embryo, has demonstrated expression of lineage-specific genes long before overt morphological differentiation. These observations lead to useful generalizations regarding the processes of gene regulation that underlie the molecular biology of cell lineage specification in the embryo."
https://openalex.org/W1537737553,"Aldosterone-biosynthesizing adrenal tissue contains an angular methyl oxidase which converts corticosterone to 18-hydroxycorticosterone and aldosterone. Cortisol, when incubated with an active source of this oxidase, the bullfrog interrenal gland, was converted to 18-hydroxycortisol and a new C-18-oxygenated steroid identified as 11 beta, 17 alpha,21-trihydroxy-3,20-diketo-4-pregnene-18-al, or 18-oxocortisol. Proof of structure was based on the evidence that it was an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone biosynthesized from cortisol with an empirical formula of C21H28O6. Low resolution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of its fully derivatized methoxime trimethylsilyl ether confirmed a trioxopregnenetriol structure in which one aldehyde group was partially masked as an internal hemiacetal. That the oxo group had replaced the C-18 angular methyl was shown by oxidative degradation of the side chain with either periodic acid or sodium bismuthate to yield an hydroxy gamma-lactone rather than an etioacid. It is suggested that the corticosterone methyl oxidase system of aldosterone-producing cells has diminished substrate specificity enabling it to accept cortisol as a suboptimal substrate. Angular methyl oxidation of cortisol to its 18-hydroxy and 18-oxoderivative in two hypertensive disorders is attributed to a derangement in adrenocortical functional zonation permitting access of glucocorticoid products into the mineralocorticoid-biosynthesizing system."
https://openalex.org/W1574702655,"Extracellular ATP (1 mM) inhibited the growth of Friend virus-infected murine erythroleukemia cells (MEL cells) but had no effect on dimethyl sulfoxide-induced differentiation. ATP (1 mM) also caused changes in the permeability of MEL cells to ions. There was an increased influx of 45Ca2+ from a basal level of 5 pmol/min to 18 pmol/min/10(6) cells to achieve a 2-fold increase in steady-state Ca2+ as measured at isotopic equilibration. Ca2+ influx was blocked by diisothiocyanostilbene disulfonate (DIDS), an inhibitor of anion transport. ATP also stimulated Cl- uptake, and this flux was inhibited by DIDS. The ratio of ATP stimulated Cl- to Ca2+ uptake was 1.6:1. K+ and Na+ influx were also stimulated by ATP, but phosphate uptake was inhibited; the Na+ influx dissipated the Na+ gradient and thus inhibited nutrient uptake. ATP-stimulated K+ influx was ouabain inhibitable; however, the total cellular K+ decreased due to an ATP-stimulated ouabain-resistant K+ efflux. Na+ influx and Ca2+ influx occurred by separate independent routes, since Na+ influx was not inhibited by DIDS. The effects observed were specific for ATP *K1/2 MgATP = 0.7 mM) since AMP, GTP, adenosine, and the slowly hydrolyzable ATP analogue adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate were without effect. The major ionic changes in the cell were a decrease in K+ and increase in Na+; cytoplasmic pH and free Ca2+ did not change appreciably. These ATP-induced changes in ion flux are considered to be responsible for growth inhibition."

https://openalex.org/W1501449457,"The activity of tyrosine-specific protein kinase was estimated during early embryonic development of the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, using the synthetic peptide Leu-Ile-Glu-Asp-Ala-Glu-Tyr-Ala-Ala-Arg-Arg-Arg-Gly as a probe. The peptide was not phosphorylated by the purified cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, phosphorylase kinase, glycogen synthase kinase 3, or casein kinase 2 but was phosphorylated by the purified epidermal growth factor-receptor kinase from A-431 cells. The sea urchin tyrosine protein kinase activity was determined in a particulate fraction (17,000 x g pellet) and in a membrane fraction obtained after discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation; these fractions contained higher specific activities of the kinase than the cytosolic or nuclear fractions. Unfertilized eggs had very low tyrosine protein kinase activity (0.22 pmol of peptide phosphorylated per mg of protein/min) in the particulate fraction, but the activity increased 2.5-fold by 1 h after fertilization and almost 20-fold by the gastrula stage. The enzyme activity of the membrane fraction increased similarly during this time period. The tyrosine protein kinase had an apparent Km of 8.9 mM for the peptide, and showed one-half-maximal velocity at about 35 microM MgATP. The phosphorylation of membrane fractions in vitro at different stages of embryonic development resulted in nine endogenous protein-staining bands (Mr = 26,000 to greater than 200,000; 10% Na dodecyl SO4 gels) which contained phosphotyrosine; some of the bands incorporated 32P differentially as a function of development. In the unfertilized egg membrane fraction, none of the protein-staining bands were shown to contain detectable 32P-tyrosine. Thus, fertilization results in increases in tyrosine-specific protein kinase(s) activity which continues to increase during early embryonic development; it is suggested that these protein kinases have a functional role during early development and differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W1532212172,"The objective of this work was to isolate cultured mouse cells with amplified adenosine deaminase genes. Such cell lines should be very useful in an effort to obtain the protein and nucleic acid probes required to study adenosine deaminase gene structure and regulation. Since adenosine deaminase expression is not required for growth of cells in culture, the first step necessary to isolate adenosine deaminase gene amplification mutants was to devise selective conditions in which adenosine deaminase activity was required for survival. This was accomplished by developing a new selection system, termed 11AAU, which selected simultaneously for adenosine deaminase and adenosine kinase. The 11AAU selection medium consists of alanosine (0.05 mM) to block de novo AMP biosynthesis, adenosine (1.1 mM) to provide a salvage route for AMP biosynthesis via the adenosine kinase reaction, and uridine (1.0 mM) to alleviate the block in UMP biosynthesis caused by adenosine at the concentration employed. Because adenosine is highly cytotoxic at 1.1 mM, adenosine deaminase expression is required to detoxify excess adenosine by converting it to inosine. We used 11AAU selection in conjunction with stepwise selection for increasing resistance to deoxycoformycin, an adenosine deaminase inhibitor, to obtain highly drug-resistant cells with a 6000-fold increase in adenosine deaminase activity. Adenosine deaminase accounted for approximately 50% of the soluble protein in highly drug-resistant lines and was indistinguishable from that in the parent as judged by isoelectric focusing, electrophoretic mobility on starch gels, and by deoxycoformycin binding studies. Increased adenosine deaminase was also correlated with the presence of numerous double-minutes, cytogenetic structures indicating the presence of amplified DNA. Growth in the absence of selection was accompanied with the loss of double-minutes and a ten-fold decline in adenosine deaminase levels. Based on the stepwise selection protocol employed, the instability of the phenotype, and the presence of double-minutes, we believe that the increased adenosine deaminase is most likely the result of amplification of adenosine deaminase genes."

(1981) Cell 27, 563-572). However, specific cross-linking of these polypeptides can occur in the absence of ATP-Mg2+ when m7I-capped inosine substituted mRNA, which contains less secondary structure than native reovirus mRNA, is used. We also found, using wheat germ extract, that inhibition of initiation complex formation by high salt concentrations is directly related to the degree of secondary structure of the mRNA. Binding of ribosomes to bromouridine-substituted reovirus mRNA is severely inhibited at high K+ concentrations, while binding to inosine-substituted mRNA is only slightly inhibited and binding of native reovirus mRNA is inhibited to an intermediate degree. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that cap recognition factors mediate an ATP-dependent melting of secondary structures involving 5' proximal sequences to the initiation codon in order to facilitate binding of ribosomes during translation initiation."

https://openalex.org/W1572011914,"Control of ferritin synthesis by iron at the level of transcription is potentially hazardous to DNA because of the iron-catalyzed degradation of DNA. The induction of ferritin synthesis in reticulocytes of embryos (bullfrog tadpoles) occurs by two types of translational control i.e. increased availability of stored ferritin mRNA, in response to iron, coupled with a high translational efficiency. Since erythroid cell nuclei have large amounts of heterochromatin and may be relatively inactive genetically, the translational control of ferritin by iron observed in red cells was studied in other tissue by isolating poly (A+) RNA from tadpole liver and analyzing protein synthesis in vitro. Liver ferritin mRNA directed the synthesis of 7.0% of the protein in a wheat germ system, compared to 1.2% in vivo, suggesting that tadpole liver contained a large amount of stored ferritin mRNA. At levels of poly (A+) RNA which were saturating for total protein synthesis, ferritin synthesis was still linearly dependent upon RNA concentration, indicating a high efficiency of translation of ferritin mRNA. The results are analogous to those previously observed in red cells and confirm the storage of ferritin mRNA deduced from studies of the polysomal and nonpolysomal distribution of the mRNA in rat liver. The results indicate that the increased availability for translation of stored ferritin mRNA, in response to iron, and the high translational efficiency of ferritin mRNA are a general characteristic of ferritin synthesis rather than a specific feature of red cell maturation. This novel form of regulation of ferritin gene expression can be attributed to a need to protect DNA from degradation by iron and oxygen. The normal barrier between DNA and iron is apparently breached by the iron-oxygen complex of the drug bleomycin, an antitumor agent thought to act in vivo by iron-catalyzed cleavage of DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1514641332,"Rat mammary epithelium and adenocarcinomas derived from it synthesize type IV collagen, a structural protein of basement membranes. In cultures of cells, net production of collagen is stimulated 2-fold more than total cell protein by epidermal growth factor. Mammary adenocarcinoma cells also respond to epidermal growth factor but to a much reduced extent. This difference in growth factor responsiveness appears to be due to the production of collagen synthesis stimulating factors by the mammary tumor cells. Such factors have been partially purified and shown to differentially stimulate the incorporation of proline into collagenase-sensitive protein by 2.5-10-fold in normal rat mammary epithelium, normal rat kidney, and mouse 3T3 cells. The tumor factors do not stimulate net collagen production in cultures of tumor cells from which the factors are derived, suggesting that tumor cells produce sufficient stimulatory factors for optimal synthesis of collagen. Pulse-chase studies indicate that the tumor factors stimulate collagen synthesis rather than block collagen turnover. The activities in the extract have been partially purified by gel filtration, ion exchange column chromatography, and isoelectric focusing. The major species has a molecular weight of about 68,000 and a pI of 5.9. A smaller peak of activity with a molecular weight of 6,000 is also present. Since collagen synthesis appears to be necessary for the growth of mammary adenocarcinomas in vivo, production of these collagen synthesis stimulating factors may be important for tumor growth."
https://openalex.org/W1591328500,"Assay conditions for the measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-24-hydroxylase activity in rat kidney mitochondria have been worked out. The product, 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was quantitated either by high pressure liquid chromatography or by isotope dilution-mass spectrometry. By these procedures, the enzyme activity could be measured with saturating concentration (greater than 2.5 X 10(-6) M) of substrate. Pretreatment of the animals by aminophylline (Kulkowski, J. A., Chow, T., Martinez, J., and Ghazarian, J. G. (1979) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 90, 50-57) stimulated the 24-hydroxylase activity in vitro at least 2 to 3-fold. The identity of the product was verified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The rates of the reaction varied between 1.5 and 5 pmol/mg of mitochondrial protein.min (at 25 degrees C), and the K'm was determined to be 4.2 X 10(-7) M. Malate, succinate, and isocitrate were all able to support the reaction. Low O2 tension, CO, KCN, and the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone inhibited the reaction, while the respiratory inhibitor rotenone had no effect. Metyrapone inhibited the reaction with 50% inhibition at a concentration of 2.5 mumol/ml. The enzyme was found to be localized inside the inner mitochondrial membrane. The results indicate that in the rat the renal mitochondrial 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-24-hydroxylase is a cytochrome P-450 and that the reducing equivalents are primarily supplied by NADPH via the energy-dependent transhydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1561014963,"Abstract Structural changes in the asparagine-linked sugar chains of plasma membrane glycoproteins during myeloid and monocytoid differentiation were investigated by the use of an in vitro differentiation system for human promyelocytic leukemic cells (HL-60), which can be induced to more mature myeloid cells by exposure to dimethyl sulfoxide and to macrophage-like cells by a phorbol ester. The asparagine-linked sugar chains released from their plasma membranes by hydrazinolysis were separated into a neutral fraction and an acidic fraction composed of over ten components. The content of neutral oligosaccharides, which accounted for 8% of the total asparagine-linked sugar chains in HL-60 cells, increased slightly to 13% in dimethyl sulfoxide-induced cells and markedly to 33% in phorbol ester-induced cells. Structural analyses revealed that the neutral oligosaccharides of HL-60 cells are all of the complex type with a variety of Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----units in their outer chain moieties and the following core structure: (sequence; see text) After myeloid and monocytoid differentiation, the total amount of neutral complex-type sugar chains did not change significantly, but newly found high mannose-type sugar chains contributed up to 3% and 24% of the total sugar chains, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W1535596108,"Two 3'-phosphoadenylylsulfate:keratan sulfate sulfotransferases were purified 600-fold and 340-fold, respectively, from isolated bovine cornea cells. Sulfotransferase I exhibited an apparent Mr = 220,000, whereas an Mr = 140,000 was calculated for sulfotransferase II. The final preparations were both devoid of chondroitin sulfate sulfotransferase activity. The position of sulfation was determined by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Sixty per cent of the sulfate ester groups formed by sulfotransferase I were linked to the C-6 atom of galactosyl residues, the other ones to the C-6 atom of N-acetylglucosamine. Sulfotransferase II showed a different specificity: 23% of the newly formed sulfate ester groups were on galactosyl and 77% on N-acetylglucosaminyl residues. Both sulfotransferase preparations acted in a cooperative manner. In the presence of both sulfotransferases, the incorporation of [35S]sulfate into keratan sulfate was up to 75% higher than could be expected from the sum of individual activities. From the specific radioactivities of the oligosaccharides produced by digestion with endo-beta-galactosidase, it was also concluded that both enzyme species reacted best with keratan sulfate segments exhibiting a relatively high degree of sulfation."
https://openalex.org/W1592852148,"Clathrin-coated vesicles were purified from the cultured human B lymphocyte cell line RPMI 1788.

An association between HLA-A, -B, and -DR antigens and immunoglobulins with coated vesicle fractions was demonstrated by lentil lectin affinity chromatography and by immunoprecipitation using antisera directed against these glycoproteins. [35S]Methionine pulse-chase experiments revealed that there was a kinetic correlation between the expression of newly synthesized glycoproteins and their presence in coated vesicles. These results indicate that coated vesicles may be involved in the transport of cell surface and secreted eukaryotic glycoproteins through the cell to their final destinations at the plasma membrane or in the extra-cellular medium."
https://openalex.org/W1515501573,"The ferric form of L-tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenases from both Pseudomonas acidovorans (ATCC 11299b) and rat liver showed magnetic CD spectra ascribable to a high spin protohemoprotein at neutral pH, whereas the ferric indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase from rabbit intestine exhibited a spectrum due to a mixture of high and low spin states under comparable conditions. Upon addition of L-tryptophan, the spectra of the former enzymes changed to another type of high spin spectra, while the latter showed a marked increase in the low spin component. From these findings and effects of pH on the spectra, it is suggested that the sixth ligand of ferric L-tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenases is water at a neutral pH and that for the ferric indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase is a strong field ligand such as an imidazole nitrogen. The mixed spin state observed for the latter enzyme was ascribable to a thermal equilibrium between high and low spin states as judged by low temperature spectroscopy. With the ferrous form, the Soret magnetic CD spectra of these enzymes were all similar, giving those of a typical high spin ferrous protohemoprotein, whereas visible spectra were different from one another, suggesting differences in the electronic structure of the heme and its vicinity. The natural CD spectra of both ferric and ferrous forms of each enzyme showed negative Cotton effects in the Soret region. Their intensities were different from one another, presumably due to some differences in the interaction of the heme with nearby aromatic amino acid residue(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1592299238,"Weanling rats on a normal diet mobilized bone calcium in response to 11 daily injections of 125 ng of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3)/100 g, body weight. This effect was most evident in the tibial midshaft, where calcium levels were reduced by 38% compared to untreated controls. Calcium levels were reduced by only 13% in the proximal tibial metaphysis, a region formed by longitudinal growth during the 11-day experiment. The concurrent daily administration of the vitamin K antagonist warfarin dramatically increased calcium mobilization from the tibial metaphysis of 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated rats. Compared to rats which received 1,25-(OH)2D3 alone, the calcium content of the tibial metaphysis in rats treated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 plus warfarin was reduced by 40.4% (p less than 0.001) and the total dry weight was reduced by 35.0% (p less than 0.001). There was no effect of warfarin on bone calcium content or dry weight in the absence of 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment. These observations indicate that a component of the steroidal hormone action of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on bone may be mediated by increased synthesis of a vitamin K-dependent protein. The action of this vitamin K-dependent protein would oppose net calcium loss in the tibial metaphysis of 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated rats. This vitamin K-dependent protein may be the bone Gla protein, the only bone specific protein whose synthesis is known to be increased by 1,25-(OH)2D3."
https://openalex.org/W1517393255,"Newly synthesized IgM heavy chains are either expressed as functional IgM or catabolized, depending on the stage of differentiation of the B cell. Heavy chains of the membrane type are rapidly degraded in pre-B cells, but expressed on the cell surface as monomeric IgM in resting and secreting B cells. Secreted-type heavy chains are catabolized in pre-B and resting B cells, but secreted as pentameric IgM by secreting B cells. The differences between the heavy chains that are expressed and those that are catabolized are post-translational. Stable membrane and secreted heavy chains have been covalently assembled with light chains, terminally glycosylated, and removed from intracellular proteases by insertion into the plasma membrane or by secretion. The carboxylic ionophores monensin and nigericin have been used here to determine the relative importance of these post-translational events in stabilizing newly synthesized heavy chains. Monensin and nigericin inhibited both the rates and extents of terminal glycosylation and of intracellular transport of these proteins, without affecting the covalent assembly processes. These ionophores did not affect the rate of catabolism of heavy chains in either a resting or a secreting B cell line. IgM heavy chains thus appear to be stabilized against intracellular proteolysis by full covalent assembly to monomeric membrane IgM and to secreted pentameric IgM. The fully assembled IgM can then be terminally glycosylated and transported to the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1663848757,"Lymph node cell homogenates were fractionated by differential or isopycnic centrifugation and the fractions analyzed for biochemical markers with particular focus on plasma membrane constituents. Markers for the nucleus (DNA), mitochondria (cytochrome oxidase), and lysosomes (acid hydrolases) showed the expected distributions which were different from those of membrane-bound enzymes. 5'-Nucleotidase, alkaline phosphodiesterase, gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, and cholesterol were membrane-bound and distributed identically after isopycnic centrifugation with peaks at 1.15. The distributions of the enzymes were all shifted to higher densities by digitonin treatment, confirming their association with plasma membrane-derived elements. The distribution of galactosyltransferase (ovalbumin acceptor), largely overlapped those of plasma membrane markers but it was only slightly shifted by digitonin, suggesting its localization in Golgi apparatus. The distribution of mannosyltransferase (dolichyl phosphate acceptor) also overlapped those of plasma membrane and Golgi markers but it was centered at higher density (1.18) and was unaffected by digitonin. It is a useful marker for endoplasmic reticulum. 50% of the activity was in low speed sediments where it was associated with the nuclear membrane. A number of other putative and previously used markers for the endoplasmic reticulum of lymphocytes were shown not to be localized in these membranes. In particular, NADH-cytochrome c reductase was only partly associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (56%) and the remainder of the activity was in mitochondria (44%). The results show the heterogeneity in equilibrium density of plasma membrane vesicles and the considerable overlap of their distribution with those of other cellular membranes; they should provide a basis for the more rational design of preparative procedures for the lymphocyte plasma membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2064247236,"The metastasis of B16 melanoma cells differed significantly in obese (ob/ob) and lean (+/?) female mice of strain C57BL/6J. When the mice were inoculated subcutaneously with melanoma cells at 10 to 11 months of age, the primary tumor grew more slowly in obese than in lean littermates and the frequency of lung metastasis was greatly reduced. When the mice were injected with the cells at 4 to 7 months, the primary tumor grew at the same rate in obese and lean mice, but the obese mice again showed a significantly reduced frequency of lung metastasis. That this effect was related to an enhanced immunocompetence in obese mice was supported by the finding that splenic lymphocytes of ob/ob mice showed three times the proliferative response to the T-cell mitogen concanavalin A compared with the proliferative response of lean control mice. The ob/ob mouse may provide a model for the study of enhanced immunocompetence in obese individuals."
https://openalex.org/W1536810992,"The characterization of the major outer membrane protein of Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides is described. Molecular weight estimations using Ferguson plots derived from sodium dodecyl sulfate and urea-polyacrylamide gels were 39,500 and 32,200, respectively, in good agreement with the value of 33,800 obtained from amino acid compositional studies. NH2-terminal amino acid determinations of the major outer membrane protein revealed a blocked NH2 terminus. Gas chromatography of the acid-hydrolyzed protein confirmed the presence of fatty acid covalently associated with the protein presumably through an amino linkage. Peptide mapping of tryptic and chymotryptic digestions of the protein led to the identification of one peptide in each digest containing fatty acid. Digestion of the fatty acid-containing peptide with pronase resulted in the fatty acid together with L-alanine becoming extractable into hexane. We conclude that the major outer membrane protein of R. sphaeroides is a proteolipid containing at least 1 mol of fatty acid/mol of protein in amide linkage to the NH2-terminal L-alanine of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1678548139,"Kinetic studies with platelet AMP deaminase, at pH 7.0 and 100 mM NaC1, gave cooperative initial velocity curves with AMP as substrate, with Mg-ATP2- as an activator, and with Pi as an inhibitor. In the absence of Mg-ATP2-, the s0.5 for AMP was 4.5 mM with a Hill coefficient approaching 2.0. In the presence of saturating Mg-ATP2-, the s0.5 for AMP was reduced to 0.18 mM, the maximum velocity was increased by about 35%, and the Hill coefficient was 1.0. The half-activation constant for Mg-ATP2- varied from 0.7 to 0.07 mM as the concentration of AMP was varied from 0.1 to 5.0 mM and the Hill coefficient for Mg-ATP activation changed from 2.0 to 1.0 over the same range. Phosphate inhibition was competitive with AMP and with Mg-ATP2- (Ki = 2.0 mM) and reversed the activation by Mg-ATP2-. Coformycin inhibited the Mg-ATP-activated enzyme with a Ki less than 0.25 microM. Coformycin inhibition was slow, with a second order rate constant of 6.0 X 10(4) M-1 min-1, suggesting that the compound acts as a transition state analog according to Frieden, C., Kurz, L. C., and Gilbert, H. R. (1980) Biochemistry 19, 5303-5309. The kinetic properties of the enzyme indicate that substantial regulation can occur through changes in AMP concentration acting synergistically to enhance Mg-ATP2- binding and displace Pi from a single type of regulatory site."
https://openalex.org/W1557319770,"Processing of the formyl peptide receptor by differentiated HL-60 cells has been studied using the photoaffinity label N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-125I-Tyr-Lys-N epsilon-6-(4'-azido-2' -nitrophenylamino)-hexanoate. The receptor on live cells has an apparent molecular weight of 60,000 to 80,000 and possesses one predominant papain cleavage site on the cell exterior yielding a 35,000-Da fragment that contains the binding site. The affinity-labeled receptor was internalized with a t1/2 = 3.2 min at 37 degrees C, a t1/2 = 12 min at 24 degrees C, and was not internalized at 15 degrees C. The internalized receptor was localized in two intracellular compartments with buoyant densities less than that of the plasma membrane. The compartment with the lowest buoyant density was coincident with the Golgi marker galactosyltransferase. Intracellular dissociation of noncovalently bound peptide from the receptor occurred with a t1/2 = 25-28 min. Following a 3-h lag period, internalized affinity-labeled receptor was degraded by a first-order process with a t1/2 = 7 h."
https://openalex.org/W1531440490,"The interaction of erythrocyte ghosts and vesicles with chromatographed hemoglobin (Hb) A and Hb S was studied under various conditions. Although no binding of either Hb A or Hb S to inside-out vesicles was detected, under conditions of physiological ionic strength and pH, several properties of white membrane ghosts were effected by the presence of Hb. Addition of Hb A and Hb S (2 g/dl) to membrane ghosts in 6 mM MgATP, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, was found to effect the echinocyte-discocyte transition, the extent of endocytosis, the volume, and the sealing of ghosts. Our observations suggest that the structure of membrane ghosts is influenced by cytosol proteins and that the environment of the red cell membrane plays an important role in the definition and the control of the membrane structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W1608395254,The basis for the increased adenosine deaminase activity in deoxycoformycin-resistant rat hepatoma cells was investigated. Three variant cell lines with different levels of adenosine deaminase activity showed increases in the relative rate of synthesis of the enzyme in vivo. No difference in the rate of degradation of the enzyme was seen between the parental cell line and one variant cell line which exhibits a 180-fold increase in adenosine deaminase activity. Polysomal RNA isolated from this variant exhibited a 175-fold increase in the ability to direct the synthesis of adenosine deaminase in vitro.
