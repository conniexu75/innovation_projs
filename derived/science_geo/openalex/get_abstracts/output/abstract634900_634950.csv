https://openalex.org/W2952025703,"Taxonomic identification of biological materials can be achieved through DNA barcoding, where an unknown “barcode” sequence is compared to a reference database. In many disciplines, obtaining accurate taxonomic identifications can be imperative (e.g., evolutionary biology, food regulatory compliance, forensics). The Barcode of Life DataSystems (BOLD) and GenBank are the main public repositories of DNA barcode sequences. In this study, an assessment of the accuracy and reliability of sequences in these databases was performed. To achieve this, 1) curated reference materials for plants, macro-fungi and insects were obtained from national collections, 2) relevant barcode sequences (rbcL, matK, trnH-psbA, ITS and COI) from these reference samples were generated and used for searching against both databases, and 3) optimal search parameters were determined that ensure the best match to the known species in either database. While GenBank outperformed BOLD for species-level identification of insect taxa (53% and 35%, respectively), both databases performed comparably for plants and macro-fungi (~81% and ~57%, respectively). Results illustrated that using a multi-locus barcode approach increased identification success. This study outlines the utility of the BLAST search tool in GenBank and the BOLD identification engine for taxonomic identifications and identifies some precautions needed when using public sequence repositories in applied scientific disciplines."

https://openalex.org/W2949473372,"Unlike most other tissues, the colon epithelium is exposed to high levels of H2S derived from gut microbial metabolism. H2S is a signaling molecule that modulates various physiological effects. It is also a respiratory toxin that inhibits complex IV in the electron transfer chain (ETC). Colon epithelial cells are adapted to high environmental H2S exposure as they harbor an efficient mitochondrial H2S oxidation pathway, which is dedicated to its disposal. Herein, we report that the sulfide oxidation pathway enzymes are apically localized in human colonic crypts at the host-microbiome interface, but that the normal apical-to-crypt gradient is lost in colorectal cancer epithelium. We found that sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (SQR), which catalyzes the committing step in the mitochondrial sulfide oxidation pathway and couples to complex III, is a critical respiratory shield against H2S poisoning. H2S at concentrations ≤20 μm stimulated the oxygen consumption rate in colon epithelial cells, but, when SQR expression was ablated, H2S concentrations as low as 5 μm poisoned cells. Mitochondrial H2S oxidation altered cellular bioenergetics, inducing a reductive shift in the NAD+/NADH redox couple. The consequent electron acceptor insufficiency caused uridine and aspartate deficiency and enhanced glutamine-dependent reductive carboxylation. The metabolomic signature of this H2S-induced stress response mapped, in part, to redox-sensitive nodes in central carbon metabolism. Colorectal cancer tissues and cell lines appeared to counter the growth-restricting effects of H2S by overexpressing sulfide oxidation pathway enzymes. Our findings reveal an alternative mechanism for H2S signaling, arising from alterations in mitochondrial bioenergetics that drive metabolic reprogramming."
https://openalex.org/W2950573590,"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is known to colonize gastric mucosa, induce inflammation, and alter gastric microbiota resulting in a spectrum of gastric diseases. Likewise, changes in gut microbiota have recently been linked with various metabolic and inflammatory diseases. While extensive number of studies were published examining the relationship between H. pylori and gastric microbiota, little is known about the impact of H. pylori on downstream gut microbiota. In this study, we performed 16 S rRNA and ITS2-based microbial profiling analysis of 60 stool samples from adult individuals. Remarkably, the gut microbiota of H. pylori infected individuals was shown to be increased of members belonging to Succinivibrio, Coriobacteriaceae, Enterococcaceae, and Rikenellaceae. Moreover, gut microbiota of H. pylori infected individuals was shown to have increased abundance of Candida glabrata and other unclassified Fungi. These results links possible role for H. pylori-associated changes in the gut microbiota in intestinal mucosal barrier disruption and early stage colorectal carcinoma deployment. Altogether, the identified differences in bacterial and fungal composition provides important information that may eventually lead to the development of novel biomarkers and more effective management strategies."

As a medicinal and edible plant, Luffa cylindrica (L.) Roem (LC) has abundant nutrients that can effectively reduce obesity risk. However, the interaction between the prevention effects of LC against obesity and the modulating gut microbiota of LC remain obscure. This study demonstrated LC supplementation improved high-fat diet (HFD)–induced gut microbiota dysbiosis and significantly enhanced short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)–producing bacteria (e.g., Blautia) along with SCFA content accumulation in the gut. Meanwhile, LC supplementation substantially restored gut barrier damage in long-term HFD treatment Moreover, LC supplementation improved HFD-induced overweight, hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, and chronic inflammation. Gene expression profiles showed that LC displayed an important impact on hepatic lipid transport and lipid synthesis (sterol regulatory element binding transcriptional factor 1c–peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ signaling pathway). More importantly, an antibiotic treatment experiment demonstrated that the beneficial effects of LC in reducing obesity risk largely depended on the gut microbiota, especially SCFA-producing bacteria (e.g., Blautia). Therefore, LC supplementation improved gut microbiota dysbiosis via enhancing SCFA-producing bacteria (e.g., Blautia), maintained gut barrier integrity, and alleviated the development of obesity. Overall, LC would provide a potential dietary intervention strategy against obesity and enteral homeostasis dysbiosis through modulating the gut microbiota.—Zhang, L., Shi, M., Ji, J., Hu, X., Chen, F.

https://openalex.org/W2950177542,"Publications determine to a large extent the possibility to stay in academia (""publish or perish""). While some pressure to publish may incentivise high quality research, too much publication pressure is likely to have detrimental effects on both the scientific enterprise and on individual researchers. Our research question was: What is the level of perceived publication pressure in the four academic institutions in Amsterdam and does the pressure to publish differ between academic ranks and disciplinary fields? Investigating researchers in Amsterdam with the revised Publication Pressure Questionnaire, we find that a negative attitude towards the current publication climate is present across academic ranks and disciplinary fields. Postdocs and assistant professors (M = 3.42) perceive the greatest publication stress and PhD-students (M = 2.44) perceive a significant lack of resources to relieve publication stress. Results indicate the need for a healthier publication climate where the quality and integrity of research is rewarded."
https://openalex.org/W2952943818,"Dredging in the marine environment to create and maintain safe, navigable shipping channels, and subsequent disposal of the material at sea in dredge material placement sites (spoil grounds) can generate large quantities of suspended sediment that can impact upon epibenthic marine communities. For sensitive taxa such as hard corals, understanding the mechanisms of mortality and the spatial scale over which these occur is critically important for impact prediction purposes, management of dredging using zonation schemes, and also public perception. We describe the sediment deposition field from suspended sediment falling back out of suspension created around a large (7.6 Mm3) 1.5-year capital dredging project on a reef, using data from 2 weekly repeat observations of >500 individually tagged corals at multiple locations from 0.2-25 km from the dredging. The observations were supported by concurrent in situ measurements of proxy suspended sediment concentrations, underwater light, and sediment deposition (using optical backscatter sensors), and before and after surveys of seabed particle size distributions (PSDs). The distance at which 90% of the effect (from maximum to minimum) had dissipated (ED10) was 20 km away from the dredging for suspended sediment concentrations (estimated via nephelometry), and underwater light (measured using PAR sensors) associated with turbid plumes, 14 km for sediment deposition (measured using optical backscatter sensors) and 4.6 km for changes seabed clay and silt content (PSD analysis). The ED10 for smothering of corals (the build-up of pools of loose sediment on the surface that could not be removed by self-cleaning) occurred much closer still at 3-3.3 km or (0.5-0.6 km for an ED50). Smothering was common on encrusting and foliose forms where sediments accumulated in hollows and massive hemispherical forms where surface undulations (bumps) allowed sediments to pool. Smothering was never observed on branching species, even under extreme levels of sedimentation. Sediment smothering resulted in tissue bleaching and partial mortality (lesion formation), but if sediments were removed (by currents) bleached areas regained pigmentation over weeks and there was regrowth/reparation of lesions over weeks and months even before the dredging was completed. Overall sedimentation tolerance was highly related to coral morphology and surface inclination and the ability to avoid smothering by having uninterrupted downhill pathways for sediment transport across the colony."
https://openalex.org/W2944446010,"Objective Lung cancer is the most common type of cancer around the world, and it represents the main cause of death in the USA. Surgical treatment is the optimal therapeutic strategy for resectable non-small cell lung cancer. The principal factor for long-term survival after complete resection is the anatomic extension of the neoplasm. However, other factors also have adverse effects on operative mortality, and influence long-term outcome. In this paper we propose an algorithmic solution for the estimation of 5-years survival rate in lung cancer patients undertaking pulmonary resection. Materials and methods We address the issue of survival analysis through decision-making techniques based on fuzzy and soft set theories. We develop an expert system based on clinical and functional data of lung cancer resections in patients with cancer that can be used to predict the survival of patients. Results The evaluation of surgical risk in patients undertaking pulmonary resection is a primary target for thoracic surgeons. Lung cancer survival is influenced by many factors. The computational performance of our algorithm is critically analyzed by an experimental study. The correct survival classification is achieved with an accuracy of 79.0%. Our novel soft-set based criterion is an effective and precise diagnosis application for the determination of the survival rate."
https://openalex.org/W2951136093,"Rats not only avoid ingesting a substance associated with LiCl toxicosis, but they display rejection reflexes (e.g., gapes) to its taste; this latter response is thought to reflect disgust or taste aversion. Prior work has shown that rats also avoid consuming foods/fluids associated with other adverse gastrointestinal (GI) effects like lactose indigestion but without the concomitant change in oromotor responses (taste reactivity; TR) indicative of aversion. Because of interpretive limitations of the methods used in those studies, we revisited the taste aversion-avoidance distinction with a design that minimized non-treatment differences among groups. Effects on intake and preference (Experiments 1a, 1b, and 2), as well as consummatory (TR, Experiment 1a and 1b) and appetitive (Progressive Ratio, Experiment 2) behaviors to the taste stimulus were assessed after training. In both experiments, rats were trained to associate 0.2% saccharin (CS) with intraduodenal infusions of LiCl, Lactose, or NaCl control. Rats trained with 18% lactose, 0.3 and 1.5 mEq/kg dose of LiCl subsequently avoided the taste CS in post-training single-bottle intake tests and two-bottle choice tests. However, only those trained with 1.5 mEq/kg LiCl displayed post-conditioning increases in taste CS-elicited aversive TR (Experiment 1a and 1b). This dose of LiCl also led to reductions in breakpoint for saccharin. The fact that conditioned avoidance is not always accompanied by changes in other common appetitive and/or consummatory indices of ingestive motivation further supports a functional dissociation between these processes, and highlights the intricacies of visceral influences on taste-guided ingestive motivation."
https://openalex.org/W2951589587,"Background Current laboratory tests are less than 50% accurate in distinguishing between people who have food allergies (FA) and those who are merely sensitized to foods, resulting in the use of expensive and potentially dangerous Oral Food Challenges. This study presents a purely-computational machine learning approach, conducted using DNA Methylation (DNAm) data, to accurately diagnose food allergies and potentially find epigenetic targets for the disease. Methods and results An unbiased feature-selection pipeline was created that narrowed down 405,000+ potential CpG biomarkers to 18. Machine-learning models that utilized subsets of this 18-feature aggregate achieved perfect classification accuracy on completely hidden test cohorts (on an 8-fold hidden dataset). Ensemble classification was also shown to be effective for this High Dimension Low Sample Size (HDLSS) DNA methylation dataset. The efficacy of these machine learning classifiers and the 18 CpGs was further validated by their high accuracy on a large number of hidden data permutations, where the samples in the training, cross-validation, and hidden sets were repeatedly randomly allocated. The 18-CpG signature mapped to 13 genes, on which biological insights were collected. Notably, many of the FA-discriminating genes found in this study were strongly associated with the immune system, and seven of the 13 genes were previously associated with FA. Conclusions Previous studies have also created highly-accurate classifiers for this dataset, using both data-driven and a priori biological insights to construct a 96-CpG signature. This research builds on previous work because it uses a completely computational approach to obtain a perfect classification accuracy while using only 18 highly discriminating CpGs (0.005% of the total available features). In machine learning, simpler models, as used in this study, are generally preferred over more complex ones (other things being equal). Lastly, the completely data-driven methodology presented in this research eliminates the need for a priori biological information and allows for generalizability to other DNAm classification problems."
https://openalex.org/W2951249870,"Based on the high sensitivity and stable fluorescence of CdTe quantum dots (QDs) in conjunction with a specific DNA aptamer, the authors describe an aptamer-based fluorescence assay for the determination of Salmonella Typhimurium. The fluorescence detection and quantification of S. Typhimurium is based on a magnetic separation system, a combination of aptamer-coated Fe3O4 magnetic particles (Apt-MNPs) and QD-labeled ssDNA2 (complementary strand of the aptamer). Apt-MNPs are employed for the specific capture of S. Typhimurium. CdTe QD-labeled ssDNA2 was used as a signaling probe. Simply, the as-prepared CdTe QD-labeled ssDNA2 was first incubated with the Apt-MNPs to form the aptamer-ssDNA2 duplex. After the addition of S. Typhimurium, they could specifically bind the DNA aptamer, leading to cleavage of the aptamer-ssDNA2 duplex, accompanied by the release of CdTe QD-labeled DNA. Thus, an increased fluorescence signal can be achieved after magnetic removal of the Apt-MNPs. The fluorescence of CdTe QDs (λexc/em = 327/612 nm) increases linearly in the concentration range of 10 to 1010 cfu•mL-1, and the limit of detection is determined to be 1 cfu•mL-1. The detection process can be performed within 2 h and is successfully applied to the analysis of spiked food samples with good recoveries from 90% to 105%."

The examined results of asymmetric autoregressive distributed lag model indicate that cointegration exists between the oil prices and the stock returns. Results of asymmetric autoregressive distributed lag model confirm that both in the long run and the short run increase in oil prices have a negative impact on the stock returns of Shanghai stock exchange while decrease in the oil prices has a positive impact on the stock returns. The examined results of this study recommend that oil prices dynamically contribute incompetence in stock prices in such a way that impact the profits of investors in stock market.
https://openalex.org/W2953170157,"The rich Mediterranean imports found in Early Celtic princely sites (7th-5th cent. BC) in Southwestern Germany, Switzerland and Eastern France have long been the focus of archaeological and public interest. Consumption practices, particularly in the context of feasting, played a major role in Early Celtic life and imported ceramic vessels have consequently been interpreted as an attempt by the elite to imitate Mediterranean wine feasting. Here we present the first scientific study carried out to elucidate the use of Mediterranean imports in Early Celtic Central Europe and their local ceramic counterparts through organic residue analyses of 99 vessels from Vix-Mont Lassois, a key Early Celtic site. In the Mediterranean imports we identified imported plant oils and grape wine, and evidence points towards appropriation of these foreign vessels. Both Greek and local wares served for drinking grape wine and other plant-based fermented beverage(s). A wide variety of animal and plant by-products (e.g. fats, oils, waxes, resin) were also identified. Using an integrative approach, we show the importance of beehive products, millet and bacteriohopanoid beverage(s) in Early Celtic drinking practices. We highlight activities related to biomaterial transformation and show intra-site and status-related differences in consumption practices and/or beverage processing."

Screening for periodontitis is important in preventing the progress of this disease. Various types of bacteria have been examined as potential screening targets, but only culturable pathogenic bacteria have been considered candidates. Recently, the various uncultivable bacteria have been identified in microbiome studies, but the value of these bacteria in periodontitis screening remains unknown.The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic use of uncultivable bacteria Fretibacterium sp. HOT 360 and TM7 sp. HOT 356 for periodontitis screening in the Japanese population.Stimulated saliva samples were collected from 217 participants (periodontitis group, n = 157; healthy group, n = 60). The two uncultivable bacterial species selected were: Fretibacterium sp. human oral taxon 360 (Fretibacterium sp. HOT 360) and TM7 sp. human oral taxon 356 (TM7 sp. HOT 356). The levels of these two bacterial species were compared with those of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), a keystone pathogen in periodontitis. These three species of bacteria were then quantified using qualitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with specific primers and Taqman probes. Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS 20.0 software. P value was statistically significant at .05.The populations of uncultivable bacterial species TM7 sp. HOT 356 and Fretibacterium sp. HOT 360 were significantly higher in periodontitis group than in healthy group. Only Fretibacterium sp. HOT 360 showed a significantly positive correlation with such periodontal parameters as probing pocket depth (PPD) and bleeding on probing (BOP).These findings indicate that uncultivable bacteria Fretibacterium sp. HOT 360 can be used as a saliva-based diagnostic bacterial biomarker for periodontitis screening."
https://openalex.org/W2950812259,"Lysine methylation is a common posttranslational modification of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins but is also present in mitochondria. The human protein denoted “family with sequence similarity 173 member B” (FAM173B) was recently uncovered as a mitochondrial lysine (K)-specific methyltransferase (KMT) targeting the c-subunit of mitochondrial ATP synthase (ATPSc), and was therefore renamed ATPSc-KMT. We here set out to investigate the biochemical function of its yet uncharacterized paralogue FAM173A. We demonstrate that FAM173A localizes to mitochondria, mediated by a noncanonical targeting sequence that is partially retained in the mature protein. Immunoblotting analysis using methyllysine-specific antibodies revealed that FAM173A knock-out (KO) abrogates lysine methylation of a single mitochondrial protein in human cells. Mass spectrometry analysis identified this protein as adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT), represented by two highly similar isoforms ANT2 and ANT3. We found that methylation occurs at Lys-52 of ANT, which was previously reported to be trimethylated. Complementation of KO cells with WT or enzyme-dead FAM173A indicated that the enzymatic activity of FAM173A is required for ANT methylation at Lys-52 to occur. Both in human cells and in rat organs, Lys-52 was exclusively trimethylated, indicating that this modification is constitutive, rather than regulatory and dynamic. Moreover, FAM173A-deficient cells displayed increased mitochondrial respiration compared with FAM173A-proficient cells. In summary, we demonstrate that FAM173A is the long-sought KMT responsible for ANT methylation at Lys-52, and point out the functional significance of Lys-52 methylation in ANT. Based on the established naming nomenclature for KMTs, we propose to rename FAM173A to ANT-KMT (gene name ANTKMT).

Two soluble proteins residing in the mitochondrial matrix (the β-subunit of electron transfer flavoprotein (ETFβ) and citrate synthase (CS)) contain methylated lysines, and recently the enzymes responsible for introducing these modifications were identified as mitochondrial 7BS KMTs.

Another prominent example of a lysine-methylated mitochondrial protein is the ATP synthase c-subunit (ATPSc), which resides in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is trimethylated at the matrix-exposed residue Lys-43 (26Chen R.

Very recently, we uncovered the previously uncharacterized protein denoted “family with sequence similarity 173 member B” (FAM173B), as the mitochondrial KMT responsible for this methylation event, and the enzyme was therefore renamed ATPSc-KMT (21Małecki J.M.

FAM173A is a paralogue of ATPSc-KMT that is present only in vertebrates. The two proteins share high degree of homology throughout their entire sequence, including the N-terminal region, which encompasses a predicted transmembrane domain (TMD) and a noncanonical mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) responsible for mitochondrial localization of ATPSc-KMT (21Małecki J.M.

Therefore, based on its strong sequence similarity to ATPSc-KMT, we suggested that also FAM173A is a mitochondrial 7BS-KMT that targets an inner mitochondrial membrane protein on a lysine residue that faces the matrix side (21Małecki J.M.

The mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) (also known as the adenine nucleotide translocator, ADP/ATP translocase, or ADP/ATP carrier), is a highly abundant transmembrane protein residing in the inner mitochondrial membrane, constituting up to 10% of total mitochondrial protein (28Klingenberg M. Riccio P. Aquila H. Isolation of the ADP, ATP carrier as the carboxyatractylate · protein complex from mitochondria.Biochim. Biophys.

The major function of ANT is to mediate the exchange of ADP in the intermembrane space, with ATP synthesized in the mitochondrial matrix, thus facilitating continuous synthesis of ATP by the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex (ATPS) (29Brenner C. Subramaniam K. Pertuiset C. Pervaiz S. Adenine nucleotide translocase family: Four isoforms for apoptosis modulation in cancer.Oncogene. 2011; 30 (21076465): 883-89510.1038/onc.2010.501Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 30Klingenberg M.

Four paralogous genes (SLC25A4, -5, -6, and -31) encode for four different ANT isoforms in humans (ANT1, -2, -3, and -4, respectively), which share high degree of homology at the protein level (80–90% between various isoforms) but differ regarding their tissue-specific expression (29Brenner C.

In the present study we set out to identify the substrate(s) of human FAM173A. We found that FAM173A, similarly to ATPSc-KMT, was localized to mitochondria. Using FAM173A KO cells, we identified Lys-52 in ANT2 and ANT3 as targets of FAM173A. In addition, we found Lys-52 in ANT1 and ANT2 from rat to be present exclusively in the trimethylated form, indicating that this modification is constitutive in vivo. Finally, we observed that mitochondrial respiration was increased in FAM173A-deficient cells, thus pointing out the functional significance of Lys-52 methylation in ANT. Human ATPSc-KMT (also known as FAM173B) is responsible for the methylation of Lys-43 in ATPSc (21Małecki J.M. Willemen H.L.D.M. Pinto R. Ho A.Y.Y. Moen A. Kjønstad I.F. Burgering B.M.T. Zwartkruis F.

The sequence homology between FAM173A and ATPSc-KMT extends to their N-terminal regions, which contain a predicted TMD (21Małecki J.M. Willemen H.L.D.M. Pinto R. Ho A.Y.Y. Moen A. Kjønstad I.F.

The preMT sequence of ATPSc-KMT functions as a noncleavable MTS (21Małecki J.M. Willemen H.L.D.M. Pinto R. Ho A.Y.Y. Moen A. Kjønstad I.F. Burgering B.M.T. Zwartkruis F. Eijkelkamp N. Falnes P.Ø.

To test this, we generated HeLa cells expressing a fusion protein where FAM173A was fused N-terminally to GFP (FAM173A-GFP), and its intracellular localization was followed by fluorescence microscopy of live cells. We found that FAM173A-GFP was efficiently targeted to mitochondria, evidenced by its extensive colocalization with the dye MitoTracker Orange, which stains mitochondria (Fig. 1, B and C). A deletion mutant of FAM173A lacking the first 42 amino acids, including the TMD, was also efficiently targeted to mitochondria, whereas further deletion of the whole N-terminal region (the first 76 amino acids), including the TMD and the preMT sequence, completely abolished mitochondrial localization and resulted in homogenous staining of the entire cell (Fig. 1C). This suggests that the preMT sequence likely is responsible for the mitochondrial localization of FAM173A. Indeed, the isolated preMT sequence (amino acids 43–77 of FAM173A) was able to bring the GFP to mitochondria (Fig. 1, B and C). Western blot analysis of mitoplast extracts from cells expressing FAM173A-FLAG (FLAG fused to the C terminus of FAM173A), revealed the presence of two species of FLAG-tagged protein (Fig. 1D) corresponding in size to the full-length FAM173A-FLAG protein (28.2 kDa), and a truncated version likely consisting of only the MTase domain (19.8 kDa; amino acids 78–235). In summary, microscopy and biochemical analyses demonstrate that FAM173A localizes to mitochondria, targeted by a noncanonical MTS, which together with the predicted TMD is partially retained in the mature protein. To functionally characterize human FAM173A, the corresponding gene was disrupted in the haploid cell line HAP1, using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, with guide RNAs designed to target a sequence located upstream of motif “Post I,” which contains a putatively catalytically important acidic residue (i.e. Glu-105 in FAM173A, see also Fig. 1A) required for catalytic activity of other 7BS KMTs (16Kernstock S.

Through sequencing of genomic DNA, a clone of FAM173A KO cells was found that contained a 1-bp insertion in exon 3, resulting in generation of a truncated version of the FAM173A protein, which is devoid of motif Post I as well as the downstream portion of the MTase domain. The resulting protein is therefore predicted to be enzymatically inactive (for details, see “Experimental procedures”). Based on our recent findings on ATPSc-KMT, one may predict that also FAM173A is a KMT. To test this, we analyzed mitoplast extracts enriched in mitochondrial membranes for the presence of lysine-methylated proteins, using Western blotting and previously characterized anti-methyllysine antibodies (21Małecki J.M.

Melatonin has been proven to be a potential therapeutic candidate for osteoporosis. However, whether it is capable of antagonizing the suppressing effect of inflammatory cytokines on osteogenic precursor cells is so far elusive. In this study, using the cell culture system of human bone marrow stromal cells and MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts, we recorded the following vital observations that provided insights of melatonin-induced bone formation: 1) melatonin induced bone formation in both normal and inflammatory conditions; 2) Wnt4 was essential for melatonin-induced bone formation in inflammatory stimulation; 3) melatonin- and Wnt4-induced bone formation occurred via activation of β-catenin and p38-JNK MAPK pathways by interaction with a distinct frizzled LDL receptor-related protein complex; 4) melatonin suppressed the inhibitory effect of NF-κB on osteogenesis in a Wnt4-dependent manner; and 5) melatonin induced Wnt4 expression through the ERK1/2-Pax2-Egr1 pathway. In summary, we showed a novel mechanism of melatonin-induced bone formation in an inflammatory environment. Melatonin-induced Wnt4 expression is essential for its osteoinductive effect and the inhibitory effect of NF-κB on bone formation.

https://openalex.org/W2950178828,"Objective Segmented deep brain stimulation leads in the subthalamic nucleus have shown to increase therapeutic window using directional stimulation. However, it is not fully understood how these segmented leads with reduced electrode size modify the volume of tissue activated (VTA) and how this in turn relates with clinically observed therapeutic and side effect currents. Here, we investigated the differences between directional and omnidirectional stimulation and associated VTAs with patient-specific therapeutic and side effect currents for the two stimulation modes. Approach Nine patients with Parkinson’s disease underwent DBS implantation in the subthalamic nucleus. Therapeutic and side effect currents were identified intraoperatively with a segmented lead using directional and omnidirectional stimulation (these current thresholds were assessed in a blinded fashion). The electric field around the lead was simulated with a finite-element model for a range of stimulation currents for both stimulation modes. VTAs were estimated from the electric field by numerical differentiation and thresholding. Then for each patient, the VTAs for given therapeutic and side effect currents were projected onto the patient-specific subthalamic nucleus and lead position. Results Stimulation with segmented leads with reduced electrode size was associated with a significant reduction of VTA and a significant increase of radial distance in the best direction of stimulation. While beneficial effects were associated with activation volumes confined within the anatomical boundaries of the subthalamic nucleus at therapeutic currents, side effects were associated with activation volumes spreading beyond the nucleus’ boundaries. Significance The clinical benefits of segmented leads are likely to be obtained by a VTA confined within the subthalamic nucleus and a larger radial distance in the best stimulation direction, while steering the VTA away from unwanted fiber tracts outside the nucleus. Applying the same concepts at a larger scale and in chronically implanted patients may help to predict the best stimulation area."

However, whether it can replace antibiotic growth promoters without the associated risk of the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains is not known, and the effects of lysozyme supplementation on the composition, biodiversity, and function of the chicken gut microbiota remain unclear. Here, we used the 16S rRNA gene and ITS fragment Illumina sequencing combined with transcriptomic analysis to address this issue. A total of 400 1-d-old Di Gao chicks were allocated randomly to five groups, each consisting of four replicates (20 birds/group). The chicks were fed a starter (1–21 d) and a grower (22–42 d) diet supplemented with 0 (control), 40 (LYS40), 100 (LYS100), or 200 ppm (LYS200) lysozyme, or 400 ppm flavomycin as an antibiotic control for 6 weeks. Lysozyme administration did not contribute significantly (P > 0.05) to the growth of the broiler chickens. No significant (P > 0.05) differences in the diversity and composition of the bacterial and fungal communities in the cecal microbiota of chickens in the different diet groups were found. However, lysozyme supplementation led to a significant (P < 0.05) enrichment of genes involved in the synthesis/degradation of bacterial outer membranes and cell walls, cross-cell substrate transport, and carbohydrate metabolic processes, thus possibly promoting the cecal microbiota carbon and energy metabolism. Bacteroides contributed 31.9% of glycoside hydrolase genes (17,681–24,590), 26.1% of polysaccharide lyase genes (479–675), 20.7% of carbohydrate esterase genes (3,509–4,101), 8.8% of auxiliary activity genes (705–1,000), 16.2% of glycosyltransferase genes (5,301–6,844), and 13.9% of carbohydrate-binding module genes (8838–15,172) identified in the cecal samples. Thus, they were the main players in the breakdown of non-starch polysaccharides in the cecum, although Parabacteroides, Alistipes, Prevotella, Clostridium, Blastocystis, Barnesiella, Blautia, Faecalibacterium, Subdoligranulum, Megamonas, Eubacterium, Ruminococcus, Paenibacillus, Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia, and other bacteria also participated."
https://openalex.org/W2951457436,"Patients with nosocomial pneumonia exhibit elevated levels of neurotoxic amyloid and tau proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In vitro studies indicate that pulmonary endothelium infected with clinical isolates of either Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Staphylococcus aureus produces and releases cytotoxic amyloid and tau proteins. However, the effects of the pulmonary endothelium-derived amyloid and tau proteins on brain function have not been elucidated. Here, we show that P. aeruginosa infection elicits accumulation of detergent insoluble tau protein in the mouse brain and inhibits synaptic plasticity. Mice receiving endothelium-derived amyloid and tau proteins via intracerebroventricular injection exhibit a learning and memory deficit in object recognition, fear conditioning, and Morris water maze studies. We compared endothelial supernatants obtained after the endothelia were infected with P. aeruginosa possessing an intact [P. aeruginosa isolated from patient 103 (PA103) supernatant] or defective [mutant strain of P. aeruginosa lacking a functional type 3 secretion system needle tip complex (ΔPcrV) supernatant] type 3 secretion system. Whereas the PA103 supernatant impaired working memory, the ΔPcrV supernatant had no effect. Immunodepleting amyloid or tau proteins from the PA103 supernatant with the A11 or T22 antibodies, respectively, overtly rescued working memory. Recordings from hippocampal slices treated with endothelial supernatants or CSF from patients with or without nosocomial pneumonia indicated that endothelium-derived neurotoxins disrupted the postsynaptic synaptic response. Taken together, these results establish a plausible mechanism for the neurologic sequelae consequent to nosocomial bacterial pneumonia.—Balczon, R., Pittet, J.-F., Wagener, B. M., Moser, S.

https://openalex.org/W2949243266,"The neuropathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (PD) include the appearance of α-synuclein (α-SYN)-positive Lewy bodies (LBs) and the loss of catecholaminergic neurons. Thus, a potential mechanism promoting the uptake of extracellular α-SYN may exist in susceptible neurons. Of the various differentially expressed proteins, we are interested in flotillin (FLOT)-1 because this protein is highly expressed in the brainstem catecholaminergic neurons and is strikingly up-regulated in PD brains. In this study, we found that extracellular monomeric and fibrillar α-SYN can potentiate FLOT1–dopamine transporter (DAT) binding and pre-endocytic clustering of DAT on the cell surface, thereby facilitating DAT endocytosis and down-regulating its transporter activity. Moreover, we demonstrated that α-SYN itself exploited the DAT endocytic process to enter dopaminergic neuron-like cells, and both FLOT1 and DAT were found to be the components of LBs. Altogether, these findings revealed a novel role of extracellular α-SYN on cellular trafficking of DAT and may provide a rationale for the cell type-specific, functional, and pathologic alterations in PD.—Kobayashi, J., Hasegawa, T., Sugeno, N., Yoshida, S., Akiyama, T., Fujimori, K., Hatakeyama, H., Miki, Y., Tomiyama, A., Kawata, Y., Fukuda, M., Kawahata, I., Yamakuni, T., Ezura, M., Kikuchi, A., Baba, T., Takeda, A., Kanzaki, M., Wakabayashi, K., Okano, H., Aoki, M.

https://openalex.org/W2953181548,"Purpose Electron radiotherapy is a labor-intensive treatment option that is complicated by the need for field shaping blocks. These blocks are typically made from casting Cerrobend alloys containing lead and cadmium. This is a highly toxic process with limited precision. This work aims to provide streamlined and more precise electron radiotherapy by 3D using printing techniques. Methods The 3D printed electron cutout consists of plastic shells filled with 2 mm diameter tungsten ball bearings. Five clinical Cerrobend defined field were compared to the planned fields by measuring the light field edge when mounted in the electron applicator on a linear accelerator. The dose transmitted through the 3D printed and Cerrobend cutouts was measured using an IC profiler ion chamber array with 6 MeV and 16 MeV beams. Dose profiles from the treatment planning system were also compared to the measured dose profiles. Centering and full width half maximum (FWHM) metrics were taken directly from the profiler software. Results The transmission of a 16MeV beam through a 12 mm thick layer of tungsten ball bearings agreed within 1% of a 15 mm thick Cerrobend block (measured with an ion chamber array). The radiation fields shaped by ball bearing filled 3D printed cutout were centered within 0.4 mm of the planned outline, whereas the Cerrobend cutout fields had shift errors of 1–3 mm, and shape errors of 0.5–2 mm. The average shift of Cerrobend cutouts was 2.3 mm compared to the planned fields (n = 5). Beam penumbra of the 3D printed cutouts was found to be equivalent to the 15 mm thick Cerrobend cutout. The beam profiles agreed within 1.2% across the whole 30 cm profile widths. Conclusions This study demonstrates that with a proper quality assurance procedure, 3D-printed cutouts can provide more accurate electron radiotherapy with reduced toxicity compared to traditional Cerrobend methods."
https://openalex.org/W2950724928,"Approximately 28% of adults have ≥3 chronic conditions (CCs), accounting for two-thirds of U.S. healthcare costs, and often having suboptimal outcomes. Despite Institute of Medicine recommendations in 2001 to integrate guidelines for multiple CCs, progress is minimal. The vast number of unique combinations of CCs may limit progress.To determine whether major CCs segregate differentially in limited groups, electronic health record and Medicare paid claims data were examined in one accountable care organization with 44,645 Medicare beneficiaries continuously enrolled throughout 2015. CCs predicting clinical outcomes were obtained from diagnostic codes. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering defined 13 groups having similar within group patterns of CCs and named for the most common CC. Two groups, congestive heart failure (CHF) and kidney disease (CKD), included 23% of beneficiaries with a very high CC burden (10.5 and 8.1 CCs/beneficiary, respectively). Five groups with 54% of beneficiaries had a high CC burden ranging from 7.1 to 5.9 (descending order: neurological, diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular, chronic pulmonary). Six groups with 23% of beneficiaries had an intermediate-low CC burden ranging from 4.7 to 0.4 (behavioral health, obesity, osteoarthritis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, 'other'). Hypertension and hyperlipidemia were common across groups, whereas 80% of CHF segregated to the CHF group, 85% of CKD to CKD and CHF groups, 82% of cancer to Cancer, CHF, and CKD groups, and 85% of neurological disorders to Neuro, CHF, and CKD groups. Behavioral health diagnoses were common only in groups with a high CC burden. The number of CCs/beneficiary explained 36% of the variance (R2 = 0.36) in claims paid/beneficiary.Identifying a limited number of groups with high burdens of CCs that disproportionately drive costs may help inform a practical number of integrated guidelines and resources required for comprehensive management. Cluster informed guideline integration may improve care quality and outcomes, while reducing costs."

Pogonias courbina is distinguished by the following characters: the occurrence of characteristic thickening of the dorsal spines VII to XI in all specimens larger than 250 mm SL; all pterygiophores in the dorsal-fin laminar, thin; anal-fin pterygiophores slender excluded those of spines; lateral projections of gas bladder with few finger-like projections; genetic distance between both species 1%; exclusive occurrence of characters in six informative sites of COI (58 G; 214 G; 328 A; 331 A; 553C; 580 G). The method Automatic Barcode gap Discovery detected gaps in nucleotid distance congruent with the NJ, MP, and ML tree analysis. Also, advertisement calls are three times shorter in duration in P. courbina than in P. cromis. In addition, two monophyletic groups for P. cromis and P. courbina appear in trees obtained with different methodologies, emphasizing the absence of shared haplotypes.

https://openalex.org/W2952021886,"Objectives Female sex workers (FSWs) in sub-Saharan Africa are a key population for HIV prevention and treatment interventions, but less attention is given to their family planning needs. We evaluated the prevalence and predictors of unmet contraceptive need in HIV-positive FSWs. Study design This cross-sectional analysis used data from an existing longitudinal study of FSWs in Mombasa, Kenya. This analysis included women who were HIV positive, age ≥18 years, pre-menopausal, not currently pregnant or desiring pregnancy, and reported exchanging sex for cash or in-kind payment at the time of enrollment. Unmet contraceptive need was defined as non-use of modern non-barrier contraceptives and not currently trying to become pregnant. Poisson regression was used to identify factors independently associated with unmet contraceptive need. Results Among 346 HIV-positive FSWs, 125 (36.1%) reported modern non-barrier contraceptive use, leaving 221 (63.9%, 95%CI 58.8–68.9%) with unmet contraceptive need. Condom use was the only form of contraception for 129 (37.3%) participants. In unadjusted analyses, unmet contraceptive need was associated with physical abuse in the past year by someone other than a regular partner (PR 1.2, 95%CI 1.0–1.5), desire for (more) children (PR 1.3, 95%CI 1.1–1.5), and having 2–3 previous pregnancies compared to 0–1 prior pregnancies (PR 0.8, 95%CI 0.6–0.9). In adjusted analyses, lower number of previous pregnancies and having desire for future children remained significantly associated with a higher prevalence of unmet contraceptive need. Conclusions Unmet need for modern non-barrier contraception was found in two-thirds of HIV-positive FSWs who reported that they were not currently trying to become pregnant, and was higher in women with the lowest number of prior pregnancies (0–1 prior pregnancies) and in those reporting desire for (more) children in the future. These findings highlight the need for concerted efforts to identify and eliminate barriers to contraceptive use in FSWs living with HIV."
https://openalex.org/W2952803429,"Single-molecule fluorescence microscopy studies of bacteria provide unique insights into the mechanisms of cellular processes and protein machineries in ways that are unrivalled by any other technique. With the cost of microscopes dropping and the availability of fully automated microscopes, the volume of microscopy data produced has increased tremendously. These developments have moved the bottleneck of throughput from image acquisition and sample preparation to data analysis. Furthermore, requirements for analysis procedures have become more stringent given the demand of various journals to make data and analysis procedures available. To address these issues we have developed a new data analysis package for analysis of fluorescence microscopy data from rod-like cells. Our software ColiCoords structures microscopy data at the single-cell level and implements a coordinate system describing each cell. This allows for the transformation of Cartesian coordinates from transmission light and fluorescence images and single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) data to cellular coordinates. Using this transformation, many cells can be combined to increase the statistical power of fluorescence microscopy datasets of any kind. ColiCoords is open source, implemented in the programming language Python, and is extensively documented. This allows for modifications for specific needs or to inspect and publish data analysis procedures. By providing a format that allows for easy sharing of code and associated data, we intend to promote open and reproducible research. The source code and documentation can be found via the project’s GitHub page."
https://openalex.org/W2953201155,"Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is a peripheral neuropathy associated with gene duplication and point mutations in the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene. However, the role of PMP22 in Schwann cell physiology and the mechanisms by which PMP22 mutations cause CMT are not well-understood. On the basis of homology between PMP22 and proteins associated with modulation of ion channels, we hypothesized that PMP22 alters ion channel activity. Using whole-cell electrophysiology, we show here that heterologous PMP22 expression increases the amplitude of currents similar to those ascribed to store-operated calcium (SOC) channels, particularly those involving transient receptor canonical channel 1 (TrpC1). These channels help replenish Ca2+ in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) following stimulus-induced depletion. Currents with similar properties were recorded in WT but not pmp22−/− mouse Schwann cells. Heterologous expression of the CMT-associated PMP22_L16P variant, which fails to reach the plasma membrane and localizes to the ER, led to larger currents than WT PMP22. Similarly, Schwann cells isolated from Trembler J (TrJ; PMP22_L16P) mice had larger currents than WT littermates. Calcium imaging in live nerves and cultured Schwann cells revealed elevated intracellular Ca2+ in TrJ mice compared with WT. Moreover, we found that PMP22 co-immunoprecipitated with stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), the Ca2+ sensor SOC channel subunit in the ER. These results suggest that in the ER, PMP22 interacts with STIM1 and increases Ca2+ influx through SOC channels. Excess or mutant PMP22 in the ER may elevate intracellular Ca2+ levels, which could contribute to CMT pathology."

Earlier studies indicate that complement activation via the alternative pathway plays a major role in the pathogenesis. In this study we have investigated if ANCA-activation of neutrophils from AAV patients leads to activation of the alternative complement pathway. C5a-primed neutrophils (PMN) from 10 AAV patients and 10 healthy controls (HC) were stimulated with PMA or IgG purified from PR3-ANCA positive patients (ANCA IgG). The supernatants were analyzed for release of complement proteins and markers of different granules by ELISA, and release of microparticles (MP) by flow cytometry. The ability of the supernatants to activate the alternative complement pathway was determined by incubation with normal serum and C3bBbP and C5a were measured by ELISA. MP were analyzed by flow cytometry and removed by centrifugation. The supernatants from the AAV patients' neutrophils produced significantly more C3bBbP compared with HCs (p = 0.0001). C3bBbP levels correlated with the number of MP. After removal of MP from the supernatants, alternative pathway activation was significantly lower. This study shows that primed and ANCA-stimulated neutrophils from AAV patients have a greater ability to activate the alternative complement pathway compared to primed neutrophils from healthy controls. This finding emphasizes the role of complement in the pathogenesis of AAV - underlining the therapeutic potential of C5a and other complement blockade."
https://openalex.org/W2951320620,"Background Across countries, a small group of patients accounts for the majority of health care spending. These patients are more likely than other patients to experience problems with quality and safety in their care, suggesting that efforts targeting efficiency and quality among this population might have significant payoffs for health systems. Better understanding of similarities and differences in patient characteristics and health care use in different countries may ultimately inform further efforts to improve care for HNHC patients in these health systems. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study using one year of patient-level data on high-cost patients in seven high-income OECD member countries. Countries were selected based on availability of detailed information (large enough samples of claims, administrative, and survey data of high-cost patients). We studied concentration of spending among high-cost patients, characteristics of high-cost patients, and per capita spending on high-cost patients. Findings Cost-concentration of the top 5% of patients varied across countries, from 41% in Japan to 60% in Canada, driven primarily by variation in the top 1% of spenders. In general, high-cost patients were more likely to be female (57.7% on average), had a significant number of multi-morbidities (up to on average 10 major diagnostic categories (ICD chapters), and had a lower socioeconomic status. Characteristics of high-cost patients varied as well: median age ranged from 62 in the Netherlands to 75 in Germany and the difference in socioeconomic status is particularly stark in the US. Lastly, utilization, particularly for inpatient care, varied with an average number of inpatient days ranging from 6.6 nights (US) to 97.7 nights in Japan. Interpretation In this descriptive study, there is substantial variation in the cost concentration, characteristics, and per capita spending on high-cost patient populations across high-income countries. Differences in the way that health systems are structured likely explains some of this variation, which suggests the potential of cross-system learning opportunities. Our findings highlight the need for further studies including comparable performance metrics and institutional analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2950188544,"Plant seed exudates are composed of complex mixtures of chemicals with potential for bioactive compounds with antimicrobial properties. This study focused on kochia (Kochia scoparia), one of many weedy plant species considered invasive in many agricultural systems. Extraction of compounds in water yielded an exudate mass equivalent to 7% of the original seed mass used. Water-soluble exudates were tested against 16 known plant pathogens in disk diffusion assays and kochia exudates were found to inhibit Colletotrichum graminicola, the fungal causative agent of anthracnose and stalk rot in maize. The narrow range of fungi found as targets suggested the mechanism of inhibition may be specific rather than broadly antifungal. A decline in viability of cells over four orders of magnitude occurred within six hours of exposure to exudate. The minimum inhibitory concentration was 3.125 mg L-1. Hyphae formation in C. graminicola appeared inhibited following exposure to the exudate. Small molecular weight compounds as determined by GC/MS analysis showed high relative amounts of the sugars fructose, galactopyranose, glucose, and sorbitol, along with moderate proportions of organic acids and amino acids. Protein content averaged 0.7% in the standard concentration (100 mg mL-1) used for inhibition assays. Size fractionation of the exudate and subsequent disk diffusion assays revealed bioactive fractions with compounds in the MW range <5 kDa. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to show promising bioactivity against C. graminicola that was associated with water-extractable compounds from a common weed species. The results suggest that seeds of persistent plant species with long-lived seed banks like kochia may have potential for use in the discovery of compounds active in inhibiting fungal pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2952532224,"The properties and physiological function of pore-forming α-subunits of large conductance calcium- and voltage-activated potassium (BK) channels are potently modified by their functional coupling with regulatory subunits in many tissues. However, mechanisms that might control functional coupling are very poorly understood. Here we show that S-acylation, a dynamic post-translational lipid modification of proteins, of the intracellular S0-S1 loop of the BK channel pore-forming α-subunit controls functional coupling to regulatory β1-subunits. In HEK293 cells, α-subunits that cannot be S-acylated show attenuated cell surface expression, but expression was restored by co-expression with the β1-subunit. However, we also found that nonacylation of the S0-S1 loop reduces functional coupling between α- and β1-subunits by attenuating the β1-subunit-induced left shift in the voltage for half-maximal activation. In mouse vascular smooth muscle cells expressing both α- and β1-subunits, BK channel α-subunits were endogenously S-acylated. We further noted that S-acylation is significantly reduced in mice with a genetic deletion of the palmitoyl acyltransferase (Zdhhc23) that controls S-acylation of the S0-S1 loop. Genetic deletion of Zdhhc23 or broad-spectrum pharmacological inhibition of S-acylation attenuated endogenous BK channel currents independently of changes in cell surface expression of the α-subunit. We conclude that functional effects of S-acylation on BK channels depend on the presence of β1-subunits. In the absence of β1-subunits, S-acylation promotes cell surface expression, whereas in its presence, S-acylation controls functional coupling. S-Acylation thus provides a mechanism that dynamically regulates the functional coupling with β1-subunits, enabling an additional level of conditional, cell-specific control of ion-channel physiology."

However, certain geographic areas, such as the temperate Southwestern Atlantic (SWA, 27° - 56° S), remain understudied in terms of jellyfish ecological data. We analyzed 3,727 plankton samples collected along ~6.7 million km2 over a 31-year period (1983–2014) to determine the occurrence, abundance, and diversity patterns of hydromedusae in the SWA. Analyses were made at both community and species levels. Two abundance hot spots of hydromedusae were identified, where values up to 2,480 ind. m-3 were recorded between 2003 and 2014. Liriope tetraphylla and Obelia spp. were the main responsible for recurrent peaks. Diversity indexes were in the range of those published for temperate areas worldwide, and some coastal zones showed values that can be considered moderate to high for a temperate neritic region. The community analysis yielded 10 groups following previously determined biogeographic schemes throughout the study area. This work enhances the knowledge of hydromedusae in the SWA and provides essential information about the current global warming context and the gelatinous zooplankton data necessity."

However, the biological mechanism of orthodontic relapse is still unclear. This study aimed to establish a mouse model of orthodontic retention to examine how retention affects the rate and the amount of orthodontic relapse. We also sought to examine the role of osteoclastogenesis in relapse using an antibody to block the activity of M-CSF, an essential factor of osteoclast formation. Mice were treated with a nickel-titanium closed-coil spring that was fixed between the upper incisors and the upper-left first molar to move the first molar in a mesial direction over 12 days. Mice were randomly divided into three groups: group 1, no retention (G1); group 2, retention for 2 weeks (G2); and group 3, retention for 4 weeks (G3). In G2 and G3, a light-cured resin was placed in the space between the first and second molars as a model of retention. Orthodontic relapse was assessed by measuring changes in the dimensions of the gap created between the first and second molars. To assess the activity and role of osteoclasts, mice in G3 were injected with anti-c-Fms antibody or PBS, and assessed for changes in relapse distance and rate. Overall, we found that a longer retention period was associated with a slower rate of relapse and a shorter overall amount of relapse. In addition, inhibiting osteoclast formation using the anti-c-Fms antibody also reduced orthodontic relapse. These results suggest that M-CSF and/or its receptor could be potential therapeutic targets in the prevention and treatment of orthodontic relapse."

However the origin of bioflocculation components within RPM is still a pending doubt and impedes its effective exploitation. This study investigated the probability that RPM bioflocculation components originate from its associated microbes. RPM samples from an aquaculture farm in Zhoushan of China were applied to characterize its microbial community structure, screen associated bioflocculant-producing strains, and explore the homology between extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) from bioflocculant-producing isolates and RPM flocculation components. Results showed that RPM exhibited high bacterial biodiversity, with Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria as the most abundant phyla; hgcI_clade, CL500_29_marine_group, Fusibacter, MWH_UniP1_aquatic_group and Arcobacter as the dominant genera. Fourteen highly efficient bioflocculant-producing strains were screened and phylogenetically identified as Pseudoalteromonas sp. (5), Psychrobacter sp. (3), Halomonas sp. (2), Albirhodobacter sp. (1), Celeribacter sp. (1), Kocuria sp. (1) and Bacillus sp. (1), all of which except Bacillus sp. were reported for the first time for their excellent flocculation capability. Furthermore, EPS from the bioflocculant-producing strains exhibited highly similar monosaccharide composition to the reported flocculation-effective RPM polysaccharides. On the other hand, the existence of fungi in RPM was rare and showed no flocculation functionality. Findings from Zhoushan RPM strongly supported that RPM flocculation components were of bacterial origin and make RPM reproduction possible by fermentation approach."

Four natural variants of PFN1 were described as related to ALS, the most common adult-onset motor neuron disorder. However, the pathological mechanism of PFN1 in ALS is not yet completely understood. The goal of this work is to thoroughly analyze the effects of the ALS-related mutations on PFN1 structure and function using computational simulations. Here, PhD-SNP, PMUT, PolyPhen-2, SIFT, SNAP, SNPS&GO, SAAP, nsSNPAnalyzer, SNPeffect4.0 and I-Mutant2.0 were used to predict the functional and stability effects of PFN1 mutations. ConSurf was used for the evolutionary conservation analysis, and GROMACS was used to perform the MD simulations. The mutations C71G, M114T, and G118V, but not E117G, were predicted as deleterious by most of the functional prediction algorithms that were used. The stability prediction indicated that the ALS-related mutations could destabilize PFN1. The ConSurf analysis indicated that the mutation C71G, M114T, E117G, and G118V occur in highly conserved positions. The MD results indicated that the studied mutations could affect the PFN1 flexibility at the actin and PLP-binding domains, and consequently, their intermolecular interactions. It may be therefore related to the functional impairment of PFN1 upon C71G, M114T, E117G and G118V mutations, and their involvement in ALS development. We also developed a database, SNPMOL (http://www.snpmol.org/), containing the results presented on this paper for biologists and clinicians to exploit PFN1 and its natural variants."

We compared the success of UK science graduates who took paid or unpaid work six-months after graduation in obtaining a high salary or working in a STEM (Science, Technology Engineering and Mathematics) field 3.5 years later. Initially taking unpaid work was associated with lower earnings and lower persistence in STEM compared with paid work, but those using personal connections to obtain unpaid positions were as likely to persist in STEM as paid workers. Obtaining a position in STEM six months after graduation was associated with higher rates of persistence in STEM compared with a position outside STEM for both paid and unpaid workers, but the difference is considerably smaller for unpaid workers. Socio-economic inequality in the likelihood of obtaining entry in STEM by taking an unpaid position is a well-founded concern for scientific workforce diversity."

Of the two predominant p38 isoforms, p38α is proinflammatory and p38β is cytoprotective. Here, we analyzed the temperature dependence of p38 MAPK activation, substrate interaction, and tertiary structure. Incubating HeLa cells at 39.5 °C stimulated modest p38 activation, but did not alter tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα)-induced p38 activation. In in vitro kinase assays containing activated p38α and MAPK-activated kinase-2 (MK2), MK2 phosphorylation was 14.5-fold greater at 39.5 °C than at 33 °C. By comparison, we observed only 3.1- and 1.9-fold differences for activating transcription factor-2 (ATF2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription-1α (STAT1α) and a 7.7-fold difference for p38β phosphorylation of MK2. The temperature dependence of p38α:substrate binding affinity, as measured by surface plasmon resonance, paralleled substrate phosphorylation. Hydrogen–deuterium exchange MS (HDX-MS) of p38α performed at 33, 37, and 39.5 °C indicated temperature-dependent conformational changes in an α helix near the common docking and glutamate:aspartate substrate-binding domains at the known binding site for MK2.

Because MK2 participates in the pathogenesis of lung injury, the observed changes in the structure and function of proinflammatory p38α may contribute to the temperature dependence of acute lung injury. Humans usually maintain body temperature within a narrow range, but regulated deviations occur as a result of normal circadian rhythm and in response to exogenous or endogenous pyrogens. Unregulated temperature deviations occur when normal thermoregulation fails or thermoregulatory effector mechanisms are overwhelmed by intentional or accidental environmental exposures.

The p38 MAPKs are classically activated through a canonical three-kinase module that dually phosphorylates p38 on the threonine and tyrosine in the TXY motif common to all MAPKs, but under certain conditions, p38 activation can occur through autophosphorylation of the threonine in the TXY motif (46Ge B. Gram H. Di Padova F. Huang B. New L. Ulevitch R.J. Luo Y. Han J. MAPKK-independent activation of p38α mediated by TAB1-dependent autophosphorylation of p38α.Science. 2002; 295 (11847341): 1291-129410.1126/science.1067289Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 47Mittelstadt P.R.

Once activated, p38 translocates to both the nucleus and the cytoskeleton and can phosphorylate a broad range of substrates that have both pro- and anti-inflammatory actions (48Trempolec N. Dave-Coll N. Nebreda A.R. SnapShot: p38 MAPK substrates.Cell. 2013; 152 (23415236): 924-924.e110.1016/j.cell.2013.01.047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Substrate and function specificity of p38 kinase activity is achieved through selective binding of substrates to specific motifs on p38, including a substrate-docking groove located between the C- and N-terminal lobes and opposite the catalytic site (49Tanoue T. Maeda R. Adachi M. Nishida E. Identification of a docking groove on ERK and p38 MAP kinases that regulates the specificity of docking interactions.EMBO J. 2001; 20 (11157753): 466-47910.1093/emboj/20.3.466Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The nature of substrate-specific interactions with the p38 substrate-docking domains likely determines the phosphorylation efficiency for each substrate and the downstream biological effects. The purpose of this study was to determine how shifts in temperature within a clinically relevant range modify p38 signaling. We show that changing the reaction temperature between 33 and 39.5 °C causes a conformational change within the substrate-binding groove of p38α but not p38β with an associated substrate-specific change in p38α substrate binding and kinase function. Binding affinity and phosphorylation rate of p38α for MK2 relative to ATF2 and STAT1α increased at 39.5 °C and decreased at 33 °C. We previously showed that exposure to FRH (∼39.5 °C) causes a modest increase in levels of activated p38 MAPK in whole-lung tissue homogenates in mice in vivo (11Tulapurkar M.E. Almutairy E.A.

In this study, we found that incubating HeLa cells at 39.5 °C stimulated an increase in phosphorylated p38 that peaked ∼2-fold above baseline after 30–60 min and returned to baseline by 2–4 h (Fig. 1 (A and B) and Fig. S4). THP1 and BEAS2B cell lines and primary cultured HMVECs exhibited a similar transient activation of p38 in response to hyperthermia (Fig. 1C and Fig. S4). Unlike p38, there was no detectable ERK activation in the hyperthermic HeLa cells (Fig. 1A and Fig. S4). In contrast with hyperthermia alone, stimulating HeLa cells with 10 ng/ml TNFα activated a rapid, transient ∼25-fold increase in phosphorylated p38 that was similar at 33, 37, and 39.5 °C (Fig. 1D and Fig. S4). To determine the potential contribution of autophosphorylation to the p38 activation observed in hyperthermia-stimulated cells, we first determined whether p38 catalytic activity was required for p38 activation in HeLa cells incubated at 39.5 °C by pretreating with the p38 catalytic inhibitor, SB203580 (Fig. 1E and Fig. S4).

In our work, we examined the effect of predation risk cues and experience on feeding efforts when a novel food resource was made available. To achieve this, we live-trapped wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus in Monte de Valdelatas (Madrid), where 80 Sherman traps were set in four plots. Traps were subjected to two food-access difficulties in treatments consisting of three consecutive nights: open plastic bottles (easy) and closed bottles (difficult), both using corn as bait. To simulate predation risk, we set fox faeces in half of the traps in each plot. We also considered moonlight (medium/low) as an indirect predation risk cue. We analysed whether bottles had been bitten by mice and the gnawed area of each bottle was measured. Our results indicated that food access difficulty, experience, and predation risk determined mice feeding decisions and efforts. The ability of mice to adapt feeding effort when a new food source is available was demonstrated because a higher proportion of closed bottles exhibited bite marks and the gnawed area was bigger. Moreover, mouse experience was determinant in the use of this new resource since recaptured mice gnawed broader orifices in the bottles and the gnawed area increased each time an individual was recaptured. Additionally, direct predation risk cues prompted mice to bite the bottles whereas the effect of different moon phases varied among the food access treatments. This study provides direct evidence of formidable efficacy of wild mice to exploit a new nutrient resource while considering crucial environmental factors that shape the decision-making procedure."

Existing works mainly focus on designing criteria for screening examples of high value to be labeled in a handcrafted manner. Instead of manually developing strategies of querying the user to access labels for the desired examples, we utilized the reinforcement learning algorithm parameterized with the neural network to automatically explore query strategies in active learning when addressing stream-based one-shot classification problems. With the involvement of cross-entropy in the loss function of Q-learning, an efficient policy to decide when and where to predict or query an instance is learned through the developed framework. Compared with a former influential work, the advantages of our method are demonstrated experimentally with two image classification tasks, and it exhibited better performance, quick convergence, relatively good stability and fewer requests for labels."
https://openalex.org/W2951610851,"In insects, the gustatory system has a critical function not only in selecting food and feeding behaviours but also in growth and metabolism. Gustatory receptors play an irreplaceable role in insect gustatory signalling. Trichogramma chilonis is an effective biocontrol agent against agricultural insect pests. However, the molecular mechanism of gustation in T. chilonis remains elusive. In this study, we found that T. chilonis adults had a preference for D-fructose and that D-fructose contributed to prolong longevity and improve fecundity. Then, We also isolated the full-length cDNA encoding candidate gustatory receptor (TchiGR43a) based on the transcriptome data of T. chilonis, and observed that the candidate gustatory receptor gene was expressed from the larval to adult stages. The expression levels of TchiGR43a were similar between female and male. A Xenopus oocyte expression system and two-electrode voltage-clamp recording further verified the function analysis of TchiGR43a. Electrophysiological results showed that TchiGR43a was exclusively tuned to D-fructose. By the studies of behaviour, molecular biology and electrophysiology in T. chilonis, our results lay a basic fundation of further study on the molecular mechanisms of gustatory reception and provide theoretical basis for the nutritional requirement of T. chilonis in biocontrol."
https://openalex.org/W2949354280,"Introduction Safety climates are perceptions of safety culture shared by staff in organizational units. Measuring staff perceptions of patient safety culture by using safety climate surveys is a possible way of addressing patient safety. Studies have documented that patient safety climates vary significantly between work sites in hospitals. Across-ward variations in the measurements of safety climate factor scores may indicate ward-specific risk of adverse events related to patient care routines, work environment, staff behaviour, and patient results. Variation in patient safety climates has not yet been explored in nursing homes. Objectives To investigate whether the Norwegian translation of the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire—Ambulatory Version is useful to identify significant variation in the patient safety climate factor scores: Teamwork climate, Safety climate, Job satisfaction, Working conditions, Stress recognition, and Perceptions of management, across wards in nursing homes. Methods Four hundred and sixty three employees from 34 wards in five nursing homes were invited to participate. Cronbach alphas were computed based on individual respondents’ scores on the six patient safety climate factor scores. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated by multilevel analysis to measure patient safety climate variance at ward level. Results Two hundred and eighty eight (62.2%) returned the questionnaire. At ward level Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for the factors were 10.2% or higher for the factors Safety climate, Working conditions and Perceptions of management, 2.4% or lower for Teamwork climate, Job satisfaction, and zero for Stress recognition. ICC for variance at nursing home level was zero or less than one per cent for all factor scores. Conclusions Staff perceptions of Safety climate, Working conditions and Perceptions of management varied significantly across wards. These factor scores may, therefore, be used to identify wards in nursing homes with high and low risk of adverse events, and guide improvement resources to where they are most needed."
https://openalex.org/W2951555414,"Traumatic strain injury in skeletal muscle is often associated with fluid accumulation at the site of rupture, but the role of this injury exudate (EX) in cellular responses and healing is unknown. We aimed to characterize the EX sampled from human hamstring or calf muscles following a strain injury (n = 12). The cytokine and growth-factor profile, gene expression, and transcriptome analysis of EX-derived cells were compared with blood taken simultaneously from the same individuals. Cellular responses to the EX were tested in 3-dimensional (3D) culture based on primary human fibroblasts and myoblasts isolated from hamstring muscles. The EX contained a highly proinflammatory profile with a substantial expression of angiogenic factors. The proinflammatory profile was present in samples taken early postinjury and in samples aspirated several weeks postinjury, suggesting persistent inflammation. Cells derived from the EX demonstrated an increased expression of fibrogenic, adipogenic, and angiogenesis-related genes in comparison with blood cells. The injury EX stimulated fibroblast proliferation 2-fold compared with plasma, whereas such an effect was not seen for myoblasts. Finally, in 3D cell culture, the EX induced an up-regulation of connective tissue-related genes. In summary, EX formation following a muscle-strain injury stimulates fibroblast proliferation and the synthesis of connective tissue in fibroblasts. This suggests that the EX promotes an acute tissue-healing response but potentially also contributes to the formation of fibrotic tissue in the later phases of tissue repair.—Bayer, M.

https://openalex.org/W2952342878,"Background Great progress has been made in the understanding of inflammatory processes in psoriasis. However, clarifying the role of genetic variability in processes regulating inflammation, including post-transcriptional regulation by microRNA (miRNA), remains a challenge. Objectives We therefore investigated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a predicted change in the miRNA/mRNA interaction of genes involved in the psoriasis inflammatory processes. Methods Studied SNPs rs2910164 C/G–miR-146a, rs4597342 T/C–ITGAM, rs1368439 G/T–IL12B, rs1468488 C/T–IL17RA were selected using a bioinformatics analysis of psoriasis inflammation-associated genes. These SNPs were then genotyped using a large cohort of women with psoriasis (n = 241) and healthy controls (n = 516). Results No significant association with psoriasis was observed for rs2910164, rs1368439, and rs1468488 genotypes. However, the major allele T of rs4597342 –ITGAM was associated with approximately 28% higher risk for psoriasis in comparison to the patients with the C allele (OR = 1.28, 95% CI 1.01–1.61, p = 0.037). In case of genotypes, the effect of the T allele indicates the dominant model of disease penetrance as the CT and TT genotypes increase the chance of psoriasis up to 42% in comparison to CC homozygotes of rs4597342 (OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.05–1.94, p = 0.025). Conclusion SNP rs4597342 in 3'UTR of ITGAM influencing miR-21 binding may be considered a risk factor for psoriasis development. Upregulated miR-21 in psoriasis is likely to inhibit CD11b production in the case of the rs4597342 T allele which may lead to Mac-1 dysfunction, resulting in an aberrant function of innate immune cells and leading to the production of cytokines involved in psoriasis pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2950114571,"Paper mulberry, Broussonetia papyrifera (L.) L'Hér. ex Vent. (Moraceae), a dioecious species, was transported by humans from Taiwan to the islands of Remote Oceania. Its introduction and cultivation in Remote Oceania was intentional due to its cultural importance as a fiber source for barkcloth textiles. The aim of this study was to explore the genetic diversity and structure of paper mulberry populations within Remote Oceania in order to infer dispersal patterns that may reflect past human interaction among island groups. We present the integrated analysis of 380 samples (313 contemporary and 67 herbarium specimens) collected in Near and Remote Oceania. Genetic characterization was based on a set of ten microsatellites developed for B. papyrifera and complemented with the analysis of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer ITS-1 sequence, a sex marker and the chloroplast ndhF-rpl32 intergenic spacer. Microsatellite data identify a total of 64 genotypes, despite this being a clonally propagated crop, and show three major dispersal hubs within Remote Oceania, centered on the islands of Fiji, Tonga, and Pitcairn. Of 64 genotypes identified, 55 correspond to genotypes associated to female-sexed plants that probably descend from plants introduced by the prehistoric Austronesian-speaking voyagers. The ratio of accessions to genotypes between herbarium and contemporary samples, suggests recent loss of genetic diversity. In addition to the chloroplast haplotypes described previously, we detected two new haplotypes within Remote Oceania both originating in Taiwan. This is the first study of a commensal species to show genetic structuring within Remote Oceania. In spite of the genetic bottleneck, the presence of only one sex, a timespan of less than 5000 years, and asexual propagation of this crop in Remote Oceania, we detect genetic diversity and regional structuring. These observations suggest specific migration routes between island groups within Remote Oceania."
https://openalex.org/W2950946391,"Aiming at serving the interdisciplinary demand in network science, this paper introduces a new concept for complex networks, named network stiffness, which is extracted from structural engineering by assuming that a complex network behaves similarly with a structured framework. This analogy allows interpreting that a complex network can resist against any cause attempting to induce deformation changes to the network's structure, regardless of whether the network is material or not. Within this framework, this paper examines the context of applying the conceptual analogy of stiffness from the field of structural engineering to network science and then it develops computational approaches capturing different aspects of network stiffness so that to be used in complex network analysis. The implementation of these approaches to a real-world network (global inbound tourism network) shows that stiffness can produce interesting insights to complex network analysis about the factors related to changes caused to the structure and the status of a complex network."

This paper reports the first genome-wide analysis of HDL-C in the Lebanese, Middle Eastern, population and supports the importance of genome-wide association studies across different and minor ethnicities to understand better the etiology of complex human diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2950482516,"The topcoat color of motor vehicles offers vital information while investigating vehicular accidents, especially in instance of hit-and-run, since witnesses seldom perceive and retain the plate details. Differences in color perceptions among individuals with normal vision may lead to confusion in determining the color of the car involved. In this way, witnesses of crash accidents could potentially initiate flawed leads in forensic investigation, and thus affect the administration of justice. In this study, the inter-rater reliability of vehicle color determination by different volunteers was explored. Six individuals observed the topcoat colors of 500 stationary and 500 moving vehicles from five locations, employing a common system of color gradation. The outcome was binary: the vehicle color was either a ""match"" or ""non-match"". This was followed by statistical analysis in terms of the colors' frequencies and inter-rater reliability, based on which more suitable color descriptions were determined for subsequent comparisons of stationary and moving vehicles. Higher match frequencies and greater inter-rater reliability were observed when color gradations were disregarded. The frequency of correct matches could have been closely related to their relative on-the-road distribution, regardless of the statuses of observed vehicles. It was also found that black and white were associated with a greater number of matches than were intermediate colors, which should be carefully interpreted during forensic investigation to avoid wrong leads. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated the forensic significance of vehicle topcoat color determination, particularly in cases where witness statements are crucial."

https://openalex.org/W2951520999,"Behavior is characterized by sequences of goal-oriented conducts, such as food uptake, socializing and resting. Classically, one would define for each task a corresponding satisfaction level, with the agent engaging, at a given time, in the activity having the lowest satisfaction level. Alternatively, one may consider that the agent follows the overarching objective to generate sequences of distinct activities. To achieve a balanced distribution of activities would then be the primary goal, and not to master a specific task. In this setting, the agent would show two types of behaviors, task-oriented, and task-searching phases, with the latter interseeding the former. We study the emergence of autonomous task switching for the case of a simulated robot arm. Grasping one of several moving objects corresponds in this setting to a specific activity. Overall, the arm should follow a given object temporarily and then move away, in order to search for a new target and reengage. We show that this behavior can be generated robustly when modeling the arm as an adaptive dynamical system. The dissipation function is in this approach time dependent. The arm is in a dissipative state when searching for a nearby object, dissipating energy on approach. Once close, the dissipation function starts to increase, with the eventual sign change implying that the arm will take up energy and wander off. The resulting explorative state ends when the dissipation function becomes again negative and the arm selects a new target. We believe that our approach may be generalized to generate self-organized sequences of activities in general."
