https://openalex.org/W2171775073,"The human brain is organized into a collection of interacting networks with specialized functions to support various cognitive functions. Recent research has reached a consensus that the brain manifests small-world topology, which implicates both global and local efficiency at minimal wiring costs, and also modular organization, which indicates functional segregation and specialization. However, the important questions of how and when the small-world topology and modular organization come into existence remain largely unanswered. Taking a graph theoretic approach, we attempt to shed light on this matter by an in vivo study, using diffusion tensor imaging based fiber tractography, on 39 healthy pediatric subjects with longitudinal data collected at average ages of 2 weeks, 1 year, and 2 years. Our results indicate that the small-world architecture exists at birth with efficiency that increases in later stages of development. In addition, we found that the networks are broad scale in nature, signifying the existence of pivotal connection hubs and resilience of the brain network to random and targeted attacks. We also observed, with development, that the brain network seems to evolve progressively from a local, predominantly proximity based, connectivity pattern to a more distributed, predominantly functional based, connectivity pattern. These observations suggest that the brain in the early years of life has relatively efficient systems that may solve similar information processing problems, but in divergent ways."
https://openalex.org/W2054096179,"Citation distributions are crucial for the analysis and modeling of the activity of scientists. We investigated bibliometric data of papers published in journals of the American Physical Society, searching for the type of function which best describes the observed citation distributions. We used the goodness of fit with Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics for three classes of functions: log-normal, simple power law and shifted power law. The shifted power law turns out to be the most reliable hypothesis for all citation networks we derived, which correspond to different time spans. We find that citation dynamics is characterized by bursts, usually occurring within a few years since publication of a paper, and the burst size spans several orders of magnitude. We also investigated the microscopic mechanisms for the evolution of citation networks, by proposing a linear preferential attachment with time dependent initial attractiveness. The model successfully reproduces the empirical citation distributions and accounts for the presence of citation bursts as well."
https://openalex.org/W1972405196,"One of the expected effects of global change is increased variability in the abundance and distribution of living organisms, but information at the appropriate temporal and geographical scales is often lacking to observe these patterns. Here we use local knowledge as an alternative information source to study some emerging changes in Mediterranean fish diversity. A pilot study of thirty-two fishermen was conducted in 2009 from four Mediterranean locations along a south-north gradient. Semi-quantitative survey information on changes in species abundance was recorded by year and suggests that 59 fish species belonging to 35 families have experienced changes in their abundance. We distinguished species that increased from species that decreased or fluctuated. Multivariate analysis revealed significant differences between these three groups of species, as well as significant variation between the study locations. A trend for thermophilic taxa to increase was recorded at all the study locations. The Carangidae and the Sphyraenidae families typically were found to increase over time, while Scombridae and Clupeidae were generally identified as decreasing and Fistularidae and Scaridae appeared to fluctuate in abundance. Our initial findings strongly suggest the northward expansion of termophilic species whose occurrence in the northern Mediterranean has only been noted previously by occasional records in the scientific literature."
https://openalex.org/W1991039591,"In this work we analyzed the immune activation properties of different Bifidobacterium strains in order to establish their ability as inductors of specific effector (Th) or regulatory (Treg) responses. First, we determined the cytokine pattern induced by 21 Bifidobacterium strains in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Results showed that four Bifidobacterium bifidum strains showed the highest production of IL-17 as well as a poor secretion of IFNγ and TNFα, suggesting a Th17 profile whereas other Bifidobacterium strains exhibited a Th1-suggestive profile. Given the key role of Th17 subsets in mucosal defence, strains suggestive of Th17 responses and the putative Th1 Bifidobacterium breve BM12/11 were selected to stimulate dendritic cells (DC) to further determine their capability to induce the differentiation of naïve CD4(+) lymphocytes toward different Th or Treg cells. All selected strains were able to induce phenotypic DC maturation, but showed differences in cytokine stimulation, DC treated with the putative Th17 strains displaying high IL-1β/IL-12 and low IL-12/IL-10 index, whereas BM12/11-DC exhibited the highest IL-12/IL-10 ratio. Differentiation of naïve lymphocytes confirmed Th1 polarization by BM12/11. Unexpectedly, any B. bifidum strain showed significant capability for Th17 generation, and they were able to generate functional Treg, thus suggesting differences between in vivo and vitro responses. In fact, activation of memory lymphocytes present in PBMCS with these bacteria, point out the presence in vivo of specific Th17 cells, supporting the plasticity of Treg/Th17 populations and the key role of commensal bacteria in mucosal tolerance and T cell reprogramming when needed."
https://openalex.org/W2039432238,"Background Adipose tissue lipid storage and processing capacity can be a key factor for obesity-related metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and diabetes. Lipid uptake is the first step to adipose tissue lipid storage. The aim of this study was to analyze the gene expression of factors involved in lipid uptake and processing in subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral (VAT) adipose tissue according to body mass index (BMI) and the degree of insulin resistance (IR). Methods and Principal Findings VLDL receptor (VLDLR), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), acylation stimulating protein (ASP), LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) and fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) gene expression was measured in VAT and SAT from 28 morbidly obese patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) or high IR, 10 morbidly obese patients with low IR, 10 obese patients with low IR and 12 lean healthy controls. LPL, FABP4, LRP1 and ASP expression in VAT was higher in lean controls. In SAT, LPL and FABP4 expression were also higher in lean controls. BMI, plasma insulin levels and HOMA-IR correlated negatively with LPL expression in both VAT and SAT as well as with FABP4 expression in VAT. FABP4 gene expression in SAT correlated inversely with BMI and HOMA-IR. However, multiple regression analysis showed that BMI was the main variable contributing to LPL and FABP4 gene expression in both VAT and SAT. Conclusions Morbidly obese patients have a lower gene expression of factors related with lipid uptake and processing in comparison with healthy lean persons."

With the aim of identifying a potent antimicrobial peptide, we tested papiliocin in a variety of biological and biophysical assays, demonstrating that the peptide possesses very low cytotoxicity against mammalian cells and high bacterial cell selectivity, particularly against Gram-negative bacteria as well as high anti-inflammatory activity. Using LPS-stimulated macrophage RAW264.7 cells, we found that papiliocin exerted its anti-inflammatory activities by inhibiting nitric oxide (NO) production and secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2, producing effects comparable with those of the antimicrobial peptide LL-37. We also showed that the innate defense response mechanisms engaged by papiliocin involve Toll-like receptor pathways that culminate in the nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Fluorescent dye leakage experiments showed that papiliocin targets the bacterial cell membrane. To understand structure-activity relationships, we determined the three-dimensional structure of papiliocin in 300 mm dodecylphosphocholine micelles by NMR spectroscopy, showing that papiliocin has an α-helical structure from Lys3 to Lys21 and from Ala25 to Val36, linked by a hinge region. Interactions between the papiliocin and LPS studied using tryptophan blue-shift data, and saturation transfer difference-NMR experiments revealed that Trp2 and Phe5 at the N-terminal helix play an important role in attracting papiliocin to the cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that papiliocin is a potent peptide antibiotic with both anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities, and we have laid the groundwork for future studies of its mechanism of action.

https://openalex.org/W2066559039,"Morbidity studies complement the understanding of hazards to raptors by identifying natural or anthropogenic factors. Descriptive epidemiological studies of wildlife have become an important source of information about hazards to wildlife populations. On the other hand, data referenced to the overall wild population could provide a more accurate assessment of the potential impact of the morbidity/mortality causes in populations of wild birds.The present study described the morbidity causes of hospitalized wild raptors and their incidence in the wild populations, through a long term retrospective study conducted at a wildlife rehabilitation centre of Catalonia (1995-2007). Importantly, Seasonal Cumulative Incidences (SCI) were calculated considering estimations of the wild population in the region and trend analyses were applied among the different years. A total of 7021 birds were analysed: 7 species of Strigiformes (n = 3521) and 23 of Falconiformes (n = 3500). The main causes of morbidity were trauma (49.5%), mostly in the Falconiformes, and orphaned/young birds (32.2%) mainly in the Strigiformes. During wintering periods, the largest morbidity incidence was observed in Accipiter gentillis due to gunshot wounds and in Tyto alba due to vehicle trauma. Within the breeding season, Falco tinnunculus (orphaned/young category) and Bubo bubo (electrocution and metabolic disorders) represented the most affected species. Cases due to orphaned/young, infectious/parasitic diseases, electrocution and unknown trauma tended to increase among years. By contrast, cases by undetermined cause, vehicle trauma and captivity decreased throughout the study period. Interestingly, gunshot injuries remained constant during the study period.Frequencies of morbidity causes calculated as the proportion of each cause referred to the total number of admitted cases, allowed a qualitative assessment of hazards for the studied populations. However, cumulative incidences based on estimated wild raptor population provided a more accurate approach to the potential ecological impact of the morbidity causes in the wild populations."
https://openalex.org/W2166323995,"Background and Aims The hepatitis C virus (HCV) invariably shows wide heterogeneity in infected patients, referred to as a quasispecies population. Massive amounts of genetic information due to the abundance of HCV variants could be an obstacle to evaluate the viral genetic heterogeneity in detail. Methods Using a newly developed massive-parallel ultra-deep sequencing technique, we investigated the viral genetic heterogeneity in 27 chronic hepatitis C patients receiving peg-interferon (IFN) α2b plus ribavirin therapy. Results Ultra-deep sequencing determined a total of more than 10 million nucleotides of the HCV genome, corresponding to a mean of more than 1000 clones in each specimen, and unveiled extremely high genetic heterogeneity in the genotype 1b HCV population. There was no significant difference in the level of viral complexity between immediate virologic responders and non-responders at baseline (p = 0.39). Immediate virologic responders (n = 8) showed a significant reduction in the genetic complexity spanning all the viral genetic regions at the early phase of IFN administration (p = 0.037). In contrast, non-virologic responders (n = 8) showed no significant changes in the level of viral quasispecies (p = 0.12), indicating that very few viral clones are sensitive to IFN treatment. We also demonstrated that clones resistant to direct-acting antivirals for HCV, such as viral protease and polymerase inhibitors, preexist with various abundances in all 27 treatment-naïve patients, suggesting the risk of the development of drug resistance against these agents. Conclusion Use of the ultra-deep sequencing technology revealed massive genetic heterogeneity of HCV, which has important implications regarding the treatment response and outcome of antiviral therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2151109919,"Sixty-five percent of Americans are over-weight. While the neuroendocrine controls of energy homeostasis are well known, how sensory systems respond to and are impacted by obesity is scantily understood. The main accepted function of the olfactory system is to provide an internal depiction of our external chemical environment, starting from the detection of chemosensory cues. We hypothesized that the system additionally functions to encode internal chemistry via the detection of chemicals that are important indicators of metabolic state. We here uncovered that the olfactory bulb (OB) subserves as an internal sensor of metabolism via insulin-induced modulation of the potassium channel Kv1.3. Using an adult slice preparation of the olfactory bulb, we found that evoked neural activity in Kv1.3-expressing mitral cells is enhanced following acute insulin application. Insulin mediated changes in mitral cell excitability are predominantly due to the modulation of Kv1.3 channels as evidenced by the lack of effect in slices from Kv1.3-null mice. Moreover, a selective Kv1.3 peptide blocker (ShK186) inhibits more than 80% of the outward current in parallel voltage-clamp studies, whereby insulin significantly decreases the peak current magnitude without altering the kinetics of inactivation or deactivation. Mice that were chronically administered insulin using intranasal delivery approaches exhibited either an elevation in basal firing frequency or fired a single cluster of action potentials. Following chronic administration of the hormone, mitral cells were inhibited by application of acute insulin rather than excited. Mice made obese through a diet of ∼32% fat exhibited prominent changes in mitral cell action potential shape and clustering behavior, whereby the subsequent response to acute insulin stimulation was either attenuated or completely absent. Our results implicate an inappropriate neural function of olfactory sensors following exposure to chronic levels of the hormone insulin (diabetes) or increased body weight (obesity)."
https://openalex.org/W3148502062,"The aim of this study was to characterize the oncogenic function and mechanism of Cathepsin Z (CTSZ) at 20q13.3, a frequently amplified region in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Real-time PCR were used to compare CTSZ expression between paired HCC tumor and non-tumor specimens. CTSZ gene was stably transfected into HCC line QGY-7703 cells and its role in tumorigenicity and cell motility was characterized by soft agar, wound-healing, transwell invasion and cell adhesion assay, and tumor xenograft mouse model. Western blot analysis was used to study expression of proteins associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).Upregulation of CTSZ was detected in 59/137 (43%) of primary HCCs, which was significantly associated with advanced clinical stage (P = 0.000). Functional study found that CTSZ could increase colony formation in soft agar and promote cell motility. Further study found that the metastatic effect of CTSZ was associated with its role in inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by upregulating mesenchymal markers (fibronectin and vimentin) and downregulating epithelial markers (E-cadherin and α-catenin). In addition, CTSZ could also upregulate proteins associated with extracellular matrix remodeling such as MMP2, MMP3 and MMP9. Taken together, our data suggested that CTSZ was a candidate oncogene within the 20q13 amplicon and it played an important role in HCC metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2043656884,"Neuroglobin protects neurons from hypoxia in vitro and in vivo; however, the underlying mechanisms for this effect remain poorly understood. Most of the neuroglobin is present in a hexacoordinate state with proximal and distal histidines in the heme pocket directly bound to the heme iron. At equilibrium, the concentration of the five-coordinate neuroglobin remains very low (0.1-5%). Recent studies have shown that post-translational redox regulation of neuroglobin surface thiol disulfide formation increases the open probability of the heme pocket and allows nitrite binding and reaction to form NO. We hypothesized that the equilibrium between the six- and five-coordinate states and secondary reactions with nitrite to form NO could be regulated by other hypoxia-dependent post-translational modification(s). Protein sequence models identified candidate sites for both 14-3-3 binding and phosphorylation. In both in vitro experiments and human SH-SY5Y neuronal cells exposed to hypoxia and glucose deprivation, we observed that 1) neuroglobin phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions with 14-3-3 increase during hypoxic and metabolic stress; 2) neuroglobin binding to 14-3-3 stabilizes and increases the half-life of phosphorylation; and 3) phosphorylation increases the open probability of the heme pocket, which increases ligand binding (CO and nitrite) and accelerates the rate of anaerobic nitrite reduction to form NO. These data reveal a series of hypoxia-dependent post-translational modifications to neuroglobin that regulate the six-to-five heme pocket equilibrium and heme access to ligands. Hypoxia-regulated reactions of nitrite and neuroglobin may contribute to the cellular adaptation to hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W2002491606,"Background Current knowledge about incident dementia is mainly derived from studies undertaken in the West, showing that dementia is related to older age, low socio-economic status, lack of social network, depression and cardiovascular disease risk factors. We know little about incidence and predictors of dementia in China, where the prevalence is increasing and the patterns of risk factors are different. Methods Using a standard interview method, we examined 1526 non-demented people aged ≥65 years who had at least minimal educational level in China in a 7.5-year follow up. Incident dementia was diagnosed by GMS-AGECAT algorithms and psychiatrists. Results Age-standardised incidence of dementia was 14.7 per 1000 person-years (95%CI 11.3–18.2 per 1000 person-years). The increased risk was significantly associated with age, female gender (adjusted odds ratio 2.48, 95%CI 1.20–5.13), low educational levels, smoking, angina (2.58, 1.01–6.59) and living with fewer family members. Among participants with low educational level, the increased risk was associated with higher income, and with the highest and lowest occupational classes; adjusted odds ratio 2.74 (95%CI 1.12–6.70) for officers/teachers, 3.11 (1.61–6.01) for manual labourers/peasants. Conclusions Our findings of high incidence of dementia and increased risk among people having low education levels but high income suggest a more potential epidemic and burden of dementia populations in China. Maintaining social network and activities and reducing cardiovascular factors in late life could be integrated into current multi-faceted preventive strategies for curbing the epidemic of dementia."
https://openalex.org/W2090928072,"α-Synuclein (αSN) in human is tightly linked both neuropathologically and genetically to Parkinson's disease (PD) and related disorders. Disease-causing properties in vivo of the wildtype mouse ortholog (mαSN), which carries a threonine at position 53 like the A53T human mutant version that is genetically linked to PD, were never reported. To this end we generated mouse lines that express mαSN in central neurons at levels reaching up to six-fold compared to endogenous mαSN. Unlike transgenic mice expressing human wildtype or mutant forms of αSN, these mαSN transgenic mice showed pronounced ubiquitin immunopathology in spinal cord and brainstem. Isoelectric separation of mαSN species revealed multiple isoforms including two Ser129-phosphorylated species in the most severely affected brain regions. Neuronal Ser129-phosphorylated αSN occured in granular and small fibrillar aggregates and pathological staining patterns in neurites occasionally revealed a striking ladder of small alternating segments staining either for Ser129-phosphorylated αSN or ubiquitin but not both. Axonal degeneration in long white matter tracts of the spinal cord, with breakdown of myelin sheaths and degeneration of neuromuscular junctions with loss of integrity of the presynaptic neurofilament network in mαSN transgenic mice, was similar to what we have reported for mice expressing human αSN wildtype or mutant forms. In hippocampal neurons, the mαSN protein accumulated and was phosphorylated but these neurons showed no ubiquitin immunopathology. In contrast to the early-onset motor abnormalities and muscle weakness observed in mice expressing human αSN, mαSN transgenic mice displayed only end-stage phenotypic alterations that manifested alongside with neuropathology. Altogether these findings show that increased levels of wildtype mαSN does not induce early-onset behavior changes, but drives end-stage pathophysiological changes in murine neurons that are strikingly similar to those evoked by expression of human wildtype or mutant forms."
https://openalex.org/W2058006415,"Chemical insecticides are critical components of malaria control programs. Their ability to eliminate huge numbers of mosquitoes allows them to swiftly interrupt disease transmission, but that lethality also imposes immense selection for insecticide resistance. Targeting control at the small portion of the mosquito population actually responsible for transmitting malaria parasites to humans would reduce selection for resistance, yet maintain effective malaria control. Here, we ask whether simply lowering the concentration of the active ingredient in insecticide formulations could preferentially kill mosquitoes infected with malaria and/or those that are potentially infectious, namely, old mosquitoes. Using modified WHO resistance-monitoring assays, we exposed uninfected Anopheles stephensi females to low concentrations of the pyrethroid permethrin at days 4, 8, 12, and 16 days post-emergence and monitored survival for at least 30 days to evaluate the immediate and long-term effects of repeated exposure as mosquitoes aged. We also exposed Plasmodium chabaudi- and P. yoelii-infected An. stephensi females. Permethrin exposure did not consistently increase mosquito susceptibility to subsequent insecticide exposure, though older mosquitoes were more susceptible. A blood meal slightly improved survival after insecticide exposure; malaria infection did not detectably increase insecticide susceptibility. Exposure to low concentrations over successive feeding cycles substantially altered cohort age-structure. Our data suggest the possibility that, where high insecticide coverage can be achieved, low concentration formulations have the capacity to reduce disease transmission without the massive selection for resistance imposed by current practice."
https://openalex.org/W2002845638,"Background D-Ribose, an important reducing monosaccharide, is highly active in the glycation of proteins, and results in the rapid production of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in vitro. However, whether D-ribose participates in glycation and leads to production of AGEs in vivo still requires investigation. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we treated cultured cells and mice with D-ribose and D-glucose to compare ribosylation and glucosylation for production of AGEs. Treatment with D-ribose decreased cell viability and induced more AGE accumulation in cells. C57BL/6J mice intraperitoneally injected with D-ribose for 30 days showed high blood levels of glycated proteins and AGEs. Administration of high doses D-ribose also accelerated AGE formation in the mouse brain and induced impairment of spatial learning and memory ability according to the performance in Morris water maze test. Conclusions/Significance These data demonstrate that D-ribose but not D-glucose reacts rapidly with proteins and produces significant amounts of AGEs in both cultured cells and the mouse brain, leading to accumulation of AGEs which may impair mouse spatial cognition."
https://openalex.org/W2043396234,"Membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs) are a large family of scaffold proteins that play essential roles in tethering membrane receptors, adhesion molecules, and macromolecular signaling complexes for tissue developments, cell-cell communications, and intracellular signal transductions. The defining feature of the MAGUK family scaffolds is that each member contains a conserved core consisting of a PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain, an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, and a catalytically inactive guanylate kinase (GuK) domain arranged in tandem, although the structural features and functional implications of the PDZ-SH3-GuK tandem arrangement are unclear. The structure of the ZO-1 PDZ3-SH3-GuK tandem solved in this study reveals that the PDZ domain directly interacts with the SH3-GuK module, forming a structural supramodule with distinct target binding properties with respect to the isolated domains. Structure-based sequence analysis suggests that the PDZ-SH3-GuK tandems of other members of the MAGUK family also form supramodules."

In order to study the processes underlying its ability to adapt to the soil environment, whole-genome arrays were used to analyse transcriptome modifications 15 minutes, 30 minutes and 18 h after inoculation of L. monocytogenes EGD-e in soil extracts. Growth was observed within the first day of incubation and large numbers were still detected in soil extract and soil microcosms one year after the start of the experiment. Major transcriptional reprofiling was observed. Nutrient acquisition mechanisms (phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase systems and ABC transporters) and enzymes involved in catabolism of specific carbohydrates (β-glucosidases; chitinases) were prevalent. This is consistent with the overrepresentation of the CodY regulon that suggests that in a nutrient depleted environment, L. monocytogenes recruits its extensive repertoire of transporters to acquire a range of substrates for energy production."

Then, Ba2+ was used as a probe to explore the conformational transition in the selectivity filter of the channel. It was confirmed that collapsed conformations were induced by extracellular K+-free and acidification at the selectivity filters, leading to nonconductive to permeable ions. Further detailed characterization demonstrated that the two conformations presented different properties.

Potassium channels are ubiquitous pore-forming transmembrane proteins that transport K+ ions selectively and rapidly across the biological membranes. The efflux of K+ ions is controlled not only by the electrochemical gradient, but also by the gating mechanism. Along the ion conduction pathway of potassium channels, three structures are arranged from intercellular to extracellular: the lower activation gate, the selectivity filter (SF) 2The abbreviations used are: SFselectivity filterK2Ptwo-pore-domain potassium channelsATIalternative translation initiationKcsApotassium channels from S. lividans. , and the upper inactivation gate (also termed the C-type inactivation gate). Correspondingly, there are mainly two kinds of mechanisms controlling K+ ion passage. Manipulation of the lower activation gate controls the transition between the open and close state of the channel. The upper inactivation gate, which is characterized by slow kinetics, controls the transition between conduction and nonconduction of the pore. The selectivity filter of the K+ channels, formed by the highly conserved sequence TV(I)GY(F)G, plays a pivotal role in both mechanisms. Accumulating evidence shows that the selectivity filter itself has the ability to act as the inactivation gate (1Wang D.T. Hill A.P. Mann S.A. Tan P.S. Vandenberg J.I. Nat. Struct. Mol.

All the members of this family are characterized by a distinguishing topology. That is, each subunit contains four transmembrane domains and two pore-forming domains (P1 and P2). Accordingly, K2P subunits dimerize (in contrast to tetramerization in other potassium subunits) to constitute the functional selectivity filter containing four pore loop domains, a structure common to all known potassium channels (10Kollewe A.

The current produced by these channels is outwardly rectifying and is insensitive to classic potassium channel blockers such as 4-aminopyridine and tetraethylammonium. K2P channels are strongly implicated in the background or leak conductance that regulates the resting membrane potential and excitability of many kinds of cells. TREK-1 (also called K2P2.1), one of the best studied members of K2P family, is expressed at high levels in excitable tissues such as the nervous system (13Fink M. Duprat F. Lesage F. Reyes R. Romey G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6854-6862Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) and heart (14Joon Kim S. Earm Y.E. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 69: 13-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Functionally, the channel is involved in many diverse physiological or pathological processes, including neuroprotection, cerebrovascular vasodilatation, regulation of aldosterone production and secretion, tumorigenesis, depression, chemoreception, and pulmonary vasoconstriction (15Es-Salah-Lamoureux Z. Steele D.F. Fedida D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2010; 31: 587-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 16Enyedi P. Czirják G. Physiol. Rev. 2010; 90: 559-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). The functional versatility of the channel is highly associated with its sensitivity to a large volume of chemical and physical signals. Mechanical stretch, temperature, polyunsaturated fatty acids, intra-and extracellular pH, G-protein coupled receptors, and volatile general anesthetics constitute the large TREK-1 regulatory machine (16Enyedi P. Czirják G. Physiol. Rev. 2010; 90: 559-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Particular efforts have been made to explain the relationship between these regulations and gating mechanism of TREK-1 (17Mathie A. Al-Moubarak E. Veale E.L. J. Physiol. 2010; 588: 3149-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 18Cohen A. Ben-Abu Y. Zilberberg N. Eur. Biophys. J. 2009; 39: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It has been confirmed that the regulation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate to TREK-1 involves alteration of gating patterns (19Chemin J. Patel A.J. Duprat F. Lauritzen I. Lazdunski M. Honoré E. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Extracellular acid could depress the TREK-1 current by facilitating C-type inactivation, in which conformational modification of the pore region could be involved (20Cohen A. Ben-Abu Y. Hen S. Zilberberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 19448-19455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, up to now, no clues have been found about how these signals interact with the SF in TREK-1. As the Ba2+ ion has a similar radius to the K+ ion, the divalent ion is able to bind into the SF of several classes of potassium channels (21Chatelain F.C. Gazzarrini S. Fujiwara Y. Arrigoni C.

Because of its greater charge, Ba2+ tends to dwell a long time on its binding site, leading to a block of the K+ efflux. Thus, Ba2+ has been exploited extensively to decipher the SF properties of potassium channels (24Cheng Y.M. Fedida D. Kehl S.J. Biophys.

Here, we report for the first time that Ba2+ inhibits the TREK-1 current dramatically by binding to the assumed K+ binding site 4 (S4). Then, using Ba2+ as a probe, we demonstrate that the regulation of extracellular potassium ions and protons involves conformational modification in the SF of TREK-1. Particularly, the N terminus truncated isoform of TREK-1 (ΔN41) possesses a constitutively nonconductive SF. cDNA encoding the 411-amino acid isoform of human TREK-1 used in this work was amplified from a TREK-1 plasmid (a generous gift from Dr. Florian Lesage, Institut de Pharmacologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, Valbonne, France) using PCR. To investigate whether the isoform was under the regulation of alternative translation initiation (ATI) mechanism, TREK-1 containing the translation initial sequence (UGA AUA AGA) preceding the first start codon and the N-terminal truncated isoform (ΔN41) were inserted into pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). To get a high expression level in the Xenopus laevis oocyte, TREK-1 was subcloned into the pGH19 vector as follows: the pGH19-HERG (human ether-àgo-go-related gene) plasmid (a generous gift of Dr. Gail Robertson, University of Wisconsin-Madison Medical School, Madison, WI) was first cut with BamHI and HindIII to get rid of its initial inserted HERG, and then TREK-1 was inserted into the matched sites. Mutants were generated using the MutanBEST kit (TaKaRa) according to the manufacturer's manual. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. cRNA was transcribed in vitro using the RiboMAXtm large-scale RNA production systems kit (Promega). HEK 293 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm l-glutamine and held at 37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2. cDNAs encoding the wild-type TREK-1, the mutant M42I, and ΔN41 were transiently transfected into HEK 293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Two days after transfection, the cells were harvested. Protein extracts were prepared by solubilization in buffer X (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 270 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X) for 1 h and clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min. Then the lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% gel and wet-transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The anti-myc (ZSGB-BIO, 1:1000) and anti-actin (ZSGB-BIO, 1:5000) primary antibodies were used in Western blotting. Secondary antibodies were used at 1:5000 dilutions. X. laevis oocytes were isolated and injected with 10 ng of cRNA (46 nl in volume) per cell. Whole-cell currents were measured 1–3 days after injection by the two-electrode voltage clamp technique using an Axoclamp2B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). For two-electrode voltage clamp experiments, the electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had a tip resistance of 0.1–1 MΩ. Recordings were performed under constant perfusion at room temperature. Data were sampled at 2 kHz and filtered at 0.5 kHz with the Clampex 10.0 software (Axon Instruments). K+ currents through the TREK-1 channel were elicited either by the Ramp protocol (voltage ramps from −120 to +60 mV, with 1 s in duration) or by the Pulse protocol (a 100-ms pulse from −80 to +20 mV from a holding potential of −80 mV, with a 2 s interpulse interval). The normalized current was the average recorded current divided by the original control current. The standard physiological extracellular solution contained the following unless noted otherwise: 5 mm KCl, 93 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), adjusted with NaOH (standard solution). HEPES buffer was replaced by Tris in pH 8.5 solutions and MES in pH 6.5 solutions. When required, potassium ions in bath solutions were isotonically replaced by sodium ions. BaCl2 was diluted from a 1 m stock and added to the various solutions as indicated. Concentration-response curves were fitted to the Hill equation according to the following parameters: I = 1/(1+ ([X]o/IC50)h), where I is the measured current, IC50 is the concentration of extracellular ions ([X]o, X represents H+ or Ba2+ in the research) required to achieve 50% inhibition, and h is the Hill coefficient. Time constants were calculated by fitting the data to the following equation: I = Io+A*e-T/τ, where I is the measured current, Io is the blocked current at equilibrium, T is the elapsed time after Ba2+ application, τ is the apparent forward time constant in seconds, and A is a constant. The fitting was separately performed for each experiment using Origin 7.5 software (OriginLab). Values were presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was assessed with Student's t test using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc.) software. Multiple comparisons were performed with one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett post-testing. A significant difference was considered for p < 0.05. It has been reported that the 426 amino acid of TREK-1 (TREK-1426) is subjected to the ATI mechanism because of the suboptimal sequence context flanking the first start codon compared with the second one (34Thompson A.N. Posson D.J. Parsa P.V. Nimigean C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6900-6905Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Therefore, a mixture composed of the full-length TREK-1426 and an N-terminal truncated isoform (termed ΔN41 in this study) will be produced by its mRNA (Fig. 1A). The 411-amino acid of TREK-1 (TREK-1), which may be originated from alternative splicing, displayed a very different sequence context surrounding the start site compared with TREK-1426 (Fig. 1B). To investigate whether TREK-1 was under the control of the ATI mechanism, a mutant containing the second methionine-to-isoleucine mutation (M42I, no ATI function) was constructed. Protein expression analysis revealed that only one specific band was yielded by wild-type TREK-1 and M42I mutant, whereas the product of ΔN41 was a little smaller than anticipated (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that there is very little, if any, ΔN41 variant that was produced by TREK-1. In other words, the currents produced by TREK-1 would exclusively represent functional expression of TREK-1 rather than a mixture containing ΔN41. Thus, TREK-1 was used in the followed experiments to explore the gate mechanism of SF. Currents recorded from a representative Xenopus oocyte expressing TREK-1 were shown in Fig. 2A in the absence and presence of different concentrations of extracellular Ba2+ ([Ba2+]o). When [Ba2+]o was up to 4 mm, a drastic current reduction was observed compared with the control current. For currents recorded at +20 mV, the inhibition was concentration-dependent (Fig. 2B). The fitting to the Hill equation revealed a half block (IC50) at 0.56 ± 0.03 mm with an apparent Hill coefficient of 1.48 ± 0.18 (n = 7). Then the time-dependence of the Ba2+ inhibition was investigated. In the presence of 1 mm Ba2+, the currents evoked by depolarizing from the holding potential of −80 to +20 mV were decreased gradually as the time elapsed until the steady-state blockade was obtained (Fig. 2C). The process was plotted in Fig. 2D, and the current recovery by immediately following Ba2+-free solution exchange was also included. The time courses for the block and complete recovery were well fitted by a single exponential equation, with a τblock of 20.28 ± 1.95 s and a τunblock of 45.68 ± 4.80 s (n = 6), respectively. Ba2+ inhibition of some potassium channels resulted from its docking properties in the SF (21Chatelain F.C. Gazzarrini S. Fujiwara Y. Arrigoni C. Domigan C. Ferrara G. Pantoja C. Thiel G. Moroni A. Minor Jr., D.L. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e7496Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22Chang H.K. Marton L.J. Liang K.K. Shieh R.C. Biochim. Biophys.

Neuron. 2005; 47: 833-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). If that is also the case in TREK-1, competitive binding between Ba2+ and K+ would occur. To demonstrate the situation, the access rate of Ba2+ to the channel was firstly assessed. It was found that the inhibition rate (τblock, s) was accelerated as [Ba2+]o increased. The τ value declined from 54.32 ± 3.00 s at the 0.25 mm level to 13.18 ± 1.12 s at the 4 mm level (Fig. 3, A and B, n = 6). Then the effects of extracellular K+ on Ba2+ access were evaluated. When [K+]o was increased from 0 mm to 10 mm, the block time constant at 1 mm [Ba2+]o was prolonged from 14.63 ± 3.88 s to 68.69 ± 10.34 s (p < 0.001, n = 6). Very little access of Ba2+ was observed in the presence of 20 mm [K+]o (Fig. 3, C and D). Accordingly, the blocking effects of Ba2+ were also alleviated as [K+]o increased. The inhibition was decreased from 93.91 ± 7.41% at the 0 mm [K+]o level to 3.80 ± 0.97% at 20 mm [K+]o level (Fig. 3E, n = 6, p < 0.001). These results reveal the competitive binding between Ba2+ and K+, which may result from closing binding sites within the SF of TREK-1. Structural insight into the Streptomyces lividans K+ channel, KcsA (potassium channels from S. lividans), provided by crystallographic studies has demonstrated that the binding sites of Ba2+ is located in the innermost SF, very close to the K+ S4 (9Lockless S.W. Zhou M. MacKinnon R. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e121Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 35Jiang Y. MacKinnon R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). S4 is composed of four main chain carbonyl oxygen atoms and four threonine side chain hydroxyl oxygen atoms in most potassium channels. The threonine (positions 142 and 251) were conserved in the TREK-1 Pore I and Pore II domains (Fig. 4A). We presumed that Ba2+ might occupy a similar position in TREK-1. To test our hypothesis, mutants containing the threonine-to-serine transition at positions 142 (T142S) and 251 (T251S) were constructed. In the presence of 1 mm [Ba2+]o, the T142S and T251S mutants displayed very little blockade (5.97 ± 0.64% and 11.93 ± 2.46% inhibition, respectively, n = 6), whereas the current of the wild-type TREK-1 was decreased dramatically (72.90 ± 4.63% inhibition, n = 7) (Fig. 4B). As the concentration-response curve shows in Fig. 4C, the IC50 of externally applied Ba2+ to wild-type TREK-1 was 0.56 ± 0.03 mm, whereas to T142S and T251S it was 3.60 ± 0.19 mm and 3.28 ± 1.20 mm, respectively (n = 6). Obviously, the threonine mutants increase the IC50 for Ba2+ by approximately 6 fold, suggesting that Ba2+ depresses the TREK-1 current by occupying the K+ binding site at the SF. The SF of KcsA has two distinct conformations associated with low and high concentrations of K+. In low-K+ solutions, the filter adopts a nonconductive conformation, which is pinched closed at S2 and S3, and K+ binds at the ends of the filter (S1 and S4) (36Zhou Y. Morais-Cabral J.H. Kaufman A. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2001; 414: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar). In high K+ solutions, the existence of four fully dehydrated K+ ion sites endows the filter in a conductive conformation. According to the well established rule, the alteration of coordinated K+ sites would influence the exit of barium from its binding site (35Jiang Y. MacKinnon R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Therefore, the change of the Ba2+ exit pattern would correspond to the conformational alteration of the SF. In our experiments, it was found that the macroscopic currents of TREK-1 were enhanced by increasing [K+]o from 0 to 20 mm (Fig. 5A), implying a conformational transition of the SF from nonconductive to conductive. Then, after the currents were depressed and reached a stable blockade in the presence of 1 mm Ba2+, different levels of [K+]o were used to facilitate the exit of Ba2+ from its binding site. As shown in Fig. 5, B and C, the exit rate of Ba2+ was strongly speeded up as [K+]o increased. The decreased τ values were 45.68 ± 4.80 s, 24.13 ± 1.33 s, and 19.09 ± 5.20 s at 5 mm, 10 mm, and 20 mm [K+]o, respectively (n = 6, p < 0.001). Particularly, the incomplete exit of Ba2+ was observed in the K+-free external solution (Fig. 5B). Therefore, alteration of [K+]o evokes conformational transitions in the SF of TREK-1, and the off rate of Ba2+ is highly associated with the transitions. TREK-1 is very sensitive to external protons, and acidification strongly inhibits the channel via a mechanism resembling C-type inactivation in voltage-dependent potassium channels (20Cohen A. Ben-Abu Y. Hen S. Zilberberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 19448-19455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 37Sandoz G. Douguet D. Chatelain F. Lazdunski M. Lesage F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 14628-14633Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The key property of this mechanism is conformational transition of the SF to the nonconductive state. Because structural transitions of the SF occurred between low-K+ and high-K+ extracellular solution in TREK-1 (Fig. 5), we speculated that the alteration of extracellular pH values (pHo) might also influence the behavior of Ba2+ in response to conformational modifications. In our experiment, the currents of TREK-1 fell quickly after the extracellular solution was switched from pH 8.5 to pH 6.0. Subsequent application of 1 mm Ba2+ at pH 6.0 caused a further decrease. However, the washout with pH 6.0 solution achieved only a limited recover of the current (Fig. 6A). High pHo accelerated Ba2+ dissociation with decreased τunblock values from 45.68 ± 4.80 s at pH 7.4 to 22.59 ± 3.80 s at pH 8.5 (Fig. 6, B and C, n = 6, p < 0.001). H126A, a pH-insensitive mutant containing a histidine-to-alanine transition (20Cohen A. Ben-Abu Y. Hen S. Zilberberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 19448-19455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 37Sandoz G. Douguet D. Chatelain F. Lazdunski M. Lesage F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 14628-14633Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), was used to eliminate the pH sensitivity of TREK-1. External application of 1 mm Ba2+ still blocked the currents quickly, but the currents of H126A recovered completely from Ba2+ blockade in pH 6.0 external solutions (Fig. 6D). These data suggest that the conformational transition in TREK-1 occurs in the course of the pHo switch and that the SF structure evoked by acid tends to trap Ba2+ because of its collapsed state. Most recently, it has been demonstrated that the SF conformation caused by low pH is very similar to that caused by low K+ in KcsA, of which S2 and S3 are lost (5Cuello L.G. Jogini V. Cortes D.M. Perozo E. Nature. 2010; 466: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In TREK-1, incomplete recovery from Ba2+ inhibition was observed in the two conformations evoked by low-pH (acid conformation) and K+-free (K+-free conformation) conditions. We asked whether the SF structures of TREK-1 caused by K+-free and acid conditions are also similar. Our results demonstrate that they are different from each other. Firstly, although the K+-free conformation promoted the access of Ba2+ (Fig. 3, C and D), the acid conformation tended to impede the process (Fig. 7, A and B). The τblock was prolonged from 19.14 ± 4.52 s at pH 8.5 to 25.48 ± 1.69 s at pH 6.0 (n = 6, p < 0.01). Next, the interaction between the two conformations was investigated. As shown in Fig. 7C, currents recorded from a representative Xenopus oocyte expressing TREK-1 were subjected to a pH drop from 8.5 to 6.0 in the absence and in the presence of K+. Unequivocally, the K+-free conformation was more sensitive to the pH drop (I6.0/I8.5 of 0.22 ± 0.11 at 20 mV) than the conformation in standard solution (I6.0/I8.5 of 0.45 ± 0.12 at 20 mV) (Fig. 7E, n = 5, p < 0.01). Furthermore, the pH-insensitive mutant H126A also showed inhibition by acid in K+-free solution (I6.0/I8.5 is 0.44 ± 0.10 at 20 mV), compared with that in standard solution (I6.0/I8.5 is 0.90 ± 0.10 at 20 mV) (Fig. 7, D and E, n = 6, p < 0.001). Therefore, it seems that the K+-free conformation potentiates the formation of acid conformation. ΔN41, the product of ATI, is permeable to sodium under physiological conditions leading to membrane depolarization (34Thompson A.N. Posson D.J. Parsa P.V. Nimigean C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6900-6905Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The decreased macroscopic current, reduced open probability, along with the alteration of permeability of the isoform reminded us that conformational alteration to nonconductive state at its SF may happen. According to our results, Ba2+ ions were trapped in the nonconductive SF induced by low pHo and K+-free conditions in TREK-1. We then employed the blocker to test the possibility. No significant difference was found in the blockade ratio and access rate of Ba2+ to wild-type TREK-1 and ΔN41 (Fig. 8, A and C), but the behavior of Ba2+ exit displayed a big divergence. Ba2+ could not dissociate completely from ΔN41 in standard solution (pH 7.4). In alkali"

Aβ species are potent neurotoxins, however the molecular mechanism responsible for Aβ toxicity is still unknown. Numerous mechanisms of toxicity were proposed, although there is no agreement about their relative importance in disease pathogenesis. Here, the toxicity of Aβ 1-40 and Aβ 1-42 monomers, oligomers or fibrils, was evaluated using the N2a cell line. A structure-function relationship between peptide aggregation state and toxic properties was established. Moreover, we demonstrated that Aβ toxic species cross the plasma membrane, accumulate in cells and bind to a variety of internal proteins, especially on the cytoskeleton and in the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER). Based on these data we suggest that numerous proteins act as Aβ receptors in N2a cells, triggering a multi factorial toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1965719674,"Plexins are cell surface receptors widely studied in the nervous system, where they mediate migration and morphogenesis though the Rho family of small GTPases. More recently, plexins have been implicated in immune processes including cell-cell interaction, immune activation, migration, and cytokine production. Plexin-B2 facilitates ligand induced cell guidance and migration in the nervous system, and induces cytoskeletal changes in overexpression assays through RhoGTPase. The function of Plexin-B2 in the immune system is unknown. This report shows that Plexin-B2 is highly expressed on cells of the innate immune system in the mouse, including macrophages, conventional dendritic cells, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. However, Plexin-B2 does not appear to regulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines, phagocytosis of a variety of targets, or directional migration towards chemoattractants or extracellular matrix in mouse macrophages. Instead, Plxnb2(-/-) macrophages have greater cellular motility than wild type in the unstimulated state that is accompanied by more active, GTP-bound Rac and Cdc42. Additionally, Plxnb2(-/-) macrophages demonstrate faster in vitro wound closure activity. Studies have shown that a closely related family member, Plexin-B1, binds to active Rac and sequesters it from downstream signaling. The interaction of Plexin-B2 with Rac has only been previously confirmed in yeast and bacterial overexpression assays. The data presented here show that Plexin-B2 functions in mouse macrophages as a negative regulator of the GTPases Rac and Cdc42 and as a negative regulator of basal cell motility and wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W2109914062,"A global loss of cytosine methylation in DNA has been implicated in a wide range of diseases. There is growing evidence that modifications in DNA methylation can be brought about by altering the intake of methyl donors such as folate. We examined whether long-term daily supplementation with 0.8 mg of folic acid would increase global DNA methylation compared with placebo in individuals with elevated plasma homocysteine. We also investigated if these effects were modified by MTHFR C677T genotype. Two hundred sixteen participants out of 818 subjects who had participated in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial were selected, pre-stratified on MTHFR C677T genotype and matched on age and smoking status. They were allocated to receive either folic acid (0.8 mg/d; n = 105) or placebo treatment (n = 111) for three years. Peripheral blood leukocyte DNA methylation and serum and erythrocyte folate were assessed. Global DNA methylation was measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and expressed as a percentage of 5-methylcytosines versus the total number of cytosine. There was no difference in global DNA methylation between those randomized to folic acid and those in the placebo group (difference = 0.008, 95%CI = -0.05,0.07, P = 0.79). There was also no difference between treatment groups when we stratified for MTHFR C677T genotype (CC, n = 76; CT, n = 70; TT, n = 70), baseline erythrocyte folate status or baseline DNA methylation levels. In moderately hyperhomocysteinemic men and women, long-term folic acid supplementation does not increase global DNA methylation in peripheral blood leukocytes.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00110604."
https://openalex.org/W2074249282,"Placental infections with Plasmodium falciparum are associated with fetal growth restriction resulting in low birth weight (LBW). The mechanisms that mediate these effects have yet to be completely described; however, they are likely to involve inflammatory processes and dysregulation of angiogenesis. Soluble endoglin (sEng), a soluble receptor of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β previously associated with preeclampsia in pregnant women and with severe malaria in children, regulates the immune system and influences angiogenesis. We hypothesized that sEng may play a role in development of LBW associated with placental malaria (PM). Plasma levels of sEng were measured in women (i) followed prospectively throughout pregnancy in Cameroon (n = 52), and (ii) in a case-control study at delivery in Malawi (n = 479). The relationships between sEng levels and gravidity, peripheral and placental parasitemia, gestational age, and adverse outcomes of PM including maternal anemia and LBW were determined. In the longitudinal cohort from Cameroon, 28 of 52 women (54%) experienced at least one malaria infection during pregnancy. In Malawi we enrolled two aparasitemic gravidity-matched controls for every case with PM. sEng levels varied over the course of gestation and were significantly higher in early and late gestation as compared to delivery (P<0.006 and P<0.0001, respectively). Circulating sEng levels were higher in primigravidae than multigravidae from both Cameroon and Malawi, irrespective of malarial infection status (p<0.046 and p<0.001, respectively). Peripheral parasitemia in Cameroonian women and PM in Malawian women were each associated with elevated sEng levels following correction for gestational age and gravidity (p = 0.006 and p = 0.033, respectively). Increased sEng was also associated with the delivery of LBW infants in primigravid Malawian women (p = 0.017); the association was with fetal growth restriction (p = 0.003) but not pre-term delivery (p = 0.286). Increased circulating maternal sEng levels are associated with P. falciparum infection in pregnancy and with fetal growth restriction in primigravidae with PM."
https://openalex.org/W2142466683,"Background This study aims to investigate the expression and prognostic significance of activator protein 2α (AP-2α) in gastric adenocarcinoma. Methodology/Principal Findings AP-2α expression was analyzed using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), western blotting, and immunohistochemical staining methods on tissue samples from a consecutive series of 481 gastric adenocarcinoma patients who underwent resections between 2003 and 2006. The relationship between AP-2α expression, clinicopathological factors, and patient survival was investigated. RT- qPCR results showed that the expression of AP-2α mRNA was reduced in tumor tissue samples, compared with expression in matched adjacent non-tumor tissue samples (P = 0.009); this finding was confirmed by western blotting analysis (P = 0.012). Immunohistochemical staining data indicated that AP-2α expression was significantly decreased in 196 of 481 (40.7%) gastric adenocarcinoma cases; reduced AP-2α expression was also observed in patients with poorly differentiated tumors (P = 0.001) and total gastric carcinomas (P = 0.002), as well as in patients who underwent palliative tumor resection (P = 0.004). Additionally, reduced expression of AP-2α was more commonly observed in tumors that were staged as T4a/b (P = 0.018), N3 (P = 0.006), and M1 (P = 0.008). Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that reduced expression of AP-2α was associated with poor prognosis in gastric adenocarcinoma patients (P<0.001). Multivariate Cox analysis identified AP-2α expression as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (HR = 1.512, 95% CI = 1.127–2.029, P = 0.006). Conclusions/Significance Our data suggest that AP-2α plays an important role in tumor progression and that reduced AP-2α expression independently predicts an unfavorable prognosis in gastric adenocarcinoma patients."
https://openalex.org/W2038616012,"Neisseria heparin binding antigen (NHBA), also known as GNA2132 (genome-derived Neisseria antigen 2132), is a surface-exposed lipoprotein from Neisseria meningitidis that was originally identified by reverse vaccinology. It is one the three main antigens of a multicomponent vaccine against serogroup B meningitis (4CMenB), which has just completed phase III clinical trials in infants. In contrast to the other two main vaccine components, little is known about the origin of the immunogenicity of this antigen, and about its ability to induce a strong cross-bactericidal response in animals and humans. To characterize NHBA in terms of its structural/immunogenic properties, we have analyzed its sequence and identified a C-terminal region that is highly conserved in all strains. We demonstrate experimentally that this region is independently folded, and solved its three-dimensional structure by nuclear magnetic resonance. Notably, we need detergents to observe a single species in solution. The NHBA domain fold consists of an 8-strand β-barrel that closely resembles the C-terminal domains of N. meningitidis factor H-binding protein and transferrin-binding protein B. This common fold together with more subtle structural similarities suggest a common ancestor for these important antigens and a role of the β-barrel fold in inducing immunogenicity against N. meningitidis. Our data represent the first step toward understanding the relationship between structural, functional, and immunological properties of this important vaccine component."
https://openalex.org/W2135403392,"Internal Jugular Veins (IJVs) are the principle outflow pathway for intracranial blood in clinostatism condition. In the seated position, IJVs collapse, while Vertebral Veins (VVs) increase the venous outflow and partially compensate the venous drainage. Spinal Epidural Veins are an additional drainage pathway in the seated position. Colour- Doppler-Sonography (CDS) examination is able to demonstrate IJVs and VVs outflow in different postural and respiratory conditions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate CDS quantification of the cerebral venous outflow (CVF) in healthy subjects and patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).In a group of 27 healthy adults (13 females and 14 males; mean age 37.8 ± 11.2 years), and 52 patients with MS (32 females and 20 males; mean age 42.6 ± 12.1 years), CVF has been measured in clinostatism and in the seated position as the sum of the flow in IJVs and VVs. The difference between CVF in clinostatism and CVF in the seated position (ΔCVF) has been correlated with patients' status (healthy or MS), and a number of clinical variables in MS patients. Statistical analysis was performed by Fisher's exact test, non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test, ANOVA Kruskal-Wallis test, and correntropy coefficient. The value of ΔCVF was negative in 59.6% of patients with MS and positive in 96.3% of healthy subjects. Negative ΔCVF values were significantly associated with MS (p<0.0001). There was no significant correlation with clinical variables.Negative ΔCVF has a hemodynamic significance, since it reflects an increased venous return in the seated position. This seems to be a pathologic condition. In MS patients, a vascular dysregulation resulting from involvement of the autonomous nervous system may be supposed. ΔCVF value should be included in the quantitative CDS evaluation of the cerebral venous drainage, in order to identify cerebral venous return abnormalities."
https://openalex.org/W1972570030,"We employed second-harmonic generation (SHG) imaging and the zebrafish model to investigate the myopathy caused by statin in vivo with emphasis on the altered microstructures of the muscle sarcomere, the fundamental contractile element of muscles. This approach derives an advantage of SHG imaging to observe the striated skeletal muscle of living zebrafish based on signals produced mainly from the thick myosin filament of sarcomeres without employing exogenous labels, and eliminates concern about the distortion of muscle structures caused by sample preparation in conventional histological examination. The treatment with statin caused a significantly shortened sarcomere relative to an untreated control (1.73±0.09 µm vs 1.91±0.08 µm, P<0.05) while the morphological integrity of the muscle fibers remained largely intact. Mechanistic tests indicated that this microstructural disorder was associated with the biosynthetic pathway of cholesterol, or, specifically, with the impaired production of mevalonate by statins. This microstructural disorder exhibited a strong dependence on both the dosage and the duration of treatment, indicating a possibility to assess the severity of muscle injury according to the altered length of the sarcomeres. In contrast to a conventional assessment of muscle injury using clinical biomarkers in blood, such as creatine kinase that is released from only disrupted myocytes, the ability to determine microstructural modification of sarcomeres allows diagnosis of muscle injury before an onset of conventional clinical symptoms. In light of the increasing prevalence of the incidence of muscle injuries caused by new therapies, our work consolidates the combined use of the zebrafish and SHG imaging as an effective and sensitive means to evaluate the safety profile of new therapeutic targets in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2010560075,"Background Diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis (TB) is difficult in high TB burden settings. Interferon-gamma-induced protein 10 (IP10) has been suggested as a marker of TB infection and disease, but its ability to differentiate the two conditions remains uncertain. Objectives To describe Interferon-gamma (INFγ) and IP10 expression in children with TB infection and disease and controls to assess their potential to differentiate latent and active TB. Methods This was a cross sectional study of 322 1–15 years old children with symptoms of TB (28 confirmed, 136 probable and 131 unlikely TB), 335 children in contact with adults with pulmonary TB and 156 community controls in Southern Ethiopia. The Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) and Quantiferon-In-Tube (QFT-IT) were performed. INFγ and IP10 were measured in plasma supernatants. Results and Interpretation Children with confirmed and probable TB and contacts were more likely to have TST+ (78.6%, 59.3% and 54.1%, respectively) than children with unlikely TB (28.7%) and controls (12.8%) (p<0.001). Children with confirmed TB (59.3%) and contacts (44.7%) were more likely to have INFγ+ than children with probable (37.6%) or unlikely TB (28.1%) and controls (13.1%) (p<0.001). IP10 concentrations were higher in INFγ+ children independently of TST (p<0.001). There was no difference between IP10 concentrations of children with confirmed TB and contacts (p = 0.8) and children with and without HIV (p>0.1). INFγ and IP10 can identify children with TB infection and disease, but cannot differentiate between the two conditions. HIV status did not affect the expression of IP10."
https://openalex.org/W2048300333,"Adenosine inhalation produces immediate bronchoconstriction in asthmatics but not in normal subjects. The bronchospastic effect of adenosine is largely mediated through adenosine-induced mast cell activation, the mechanism of which is poorly understood due to limitations in culturing human primary mast cells. Here, we show that human umbilical cord blood -derived mast cells incubated with the Th2 cytokine IL-4 develop increased sensitivity to adenosine. Potentiation of anti-IgE- induced and calcium ionophore/PMA-induced degranulation was augmented in mast cells cultured with IL-4, and this effect was reduced or abolished by pre-treatment with A2BsiRNA and selective A2B receptor antagonists, respectively. IL-4 incubation resulted in the increased expression of A2B and reduced expression of A2A adenosine receptors on human mast cells. These results suggest that Th2 cytokines in the asthmatic lung may alter adenosine receptor expression on airway mast cells to promote increased responsiveness to adenosine."
https://openalex.org/W1971810971,"Alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), an essential regulator of inflammation, is abundantly expressed in hippocampal neurons, which are vulnerable to bacterial meningitis. However, it is unknown whether α7 nAChR contributes to the regulation of these events. In this report, an aggravating role of α7 nAChR in host defense against meningitic E. coli infection was demonstrated by using α7-deficient (α7(-/-)) mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC) and animal model systems. As shown in our in vitro and in vivo studies, E. coli K1 invasion and polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) transmigration across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) were significantly reduced in α7(-/-) BMEC and α7(-/-) mice. Stimulation by nicotine was abolished in the α7(-/-) cells and animals. The same blocking effect was achieved by methyllycaconitine (α7 antagonist). The tight junction molecules occludin and ZO-1 were significantly reduced in the brain cortex of wildtype mice infected with E. coli and treated with nicotine, compared to α7(-/-) cells and animals. Decreased neuronal injury in the hippocampal dentate gyrus was observed in α7(-/-) mice with meningitis. Proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, MCP-1, MIP-1alpha, and RANTES) and adhesion molecules (CD44 and ICAM-1) were significantly reduced in the cerebrospinal fluids of the α7(-/-) mice with E. coli meningitis. Furthermore, α7 nAChR is the major calcium channel for nicotine- and E. coli K1-increased intracellular calcium concentrations of mouse BMEC. Taken together, our data suggest that α7 nAChR plays a detrimental role in the host defense against meningitic infection by modulation of pathogen invasion, PMN recruitment, calcium signaling and neuronal inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2065965795,"A large number of patients suffering from oesophageal adenocarcinomas do not respond to conventional chemotherapy; therefore, it is necessary to identify new predictive biomarkers and patient signatures to improve patient outcomes and therapy selections. We analysed 87 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) oesophageal adenocarcinoma tissue samples with a reverse phase protein array (RPPA) to examine the expression of 17 cancer-related signalling molecules. Protein expression levels were analysed by unsupervised hierarchical clustering and correlated with clinicopathological parameters and overall patient survival. Proteomic analyses revealed a new, very promising molecular subtype of oesophageal adenocarcinoma patients characterised by low levels of the HSP27 family proteins and high expression of those of the HER family with positive lymph nodes, distant metastases and short overall survival.

We found that 72% of Web sites are still available at the published addresses, only 9% of services are completely unavailable. Older addresses often redirect to new pages. We checked the functionality of all available services: for 33%, we could not test functionality because there was no example data or a related problem; 13% were truly no longer working as expected; we could positively confirm functionality only for 45% of all services. Additionally, we conducted a survey among 872 Web Server Issue corresponding authors; 274 replied. 78% of all respondents indicate their services have been developed solely by students and researchers without a permanent position. Consequently, these services are in danger of falling into disrepair after the original developers move to another institution, and indeed, for 24% of services, there is no plan for maintenance, according to the respondents. We introduce a Web service quality scoring system that correlates with the number of citations: services with a high score are cited 1.8 times more often than low-scoring services. We have identified key characteristics that are predictive of a service's survival, providing reviewers, editors, and Web service developers with the means to assess or improve Web services. A Web service conforming to these criteria receives more citations and provides more reliable service for its users. The most effective way of ensuring continued access to a service is a persistent Web address, offered either by the publishing journal, or created on the authors' own initiative, for example at http://bioweb.me.

https://openalex.org/W2045783522,"The molecular architecture and composition of the outer membrane (OM) of Treponema pallidum (Tp), the noncultivable agent of venereal syphilis, differ considerably from those of typical Gram-negative bacteria. Several years ago we described TP0453, the only lipoprotein associated with the inner leaflet of the Tp OM. Whereas polypeptides of other treponemal lipoproteins are hydrophilic, non-lipidated TP0453 can integrate into membranes, a property attributed to its multiple amphipathic helices (AHs). Furthermore, membrane integration of the TP0453 polypeptide was found to increase membrane permeability, suggesting the molecule functions in a porin-like manner. To better understand the mechanism of membrane integration of TP0453 and its physiological role in Tp OM biogenesis, we solved its crystal structure and used mutagenesis to identify membrane insertion elements. The crystal structure of TP0453 consists of an α/β/α-fold and includes five stably folded AHs. In high concentrations of detergent, TP0453 transitions from a closed to open conformation by lateral movement of two groups of AHs, exposing a large hydrophobic cavity. Triton X-114 phase partitioning, liposome floatation assay, and bis-1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate binding revealed that two adjacent AHs are critical for membrane sensing/integration. Using terbium-dipicolinic acid complex-loaded large unilamellar vesicles, we found that TP0453 increased efflux of fluorophore only at acidic pH. Gel filtration and cross-linking experiments demonstrated that one AH critical for membrane sensing/insertion also forms a dimeric interface. Based on structural dynamics and comparison with Mycobacterium tuberculosis lipoproteins LprG and LppX, we propose that TP0453 functions as a carrier of lipids, glycolipids, and/or derivatives during OM biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1992419663,"Aims The extracellular pH of cancer cells is lower than the intracellular pH. Weakly basic anticancer drugs will be protonated extracellularly and display a decreased intracellular concentration. In this study, we show that copolymeric nanoparticles (NPs) are able to overcome this “pH-induced physiological drug resistance” (PIPDR) by delivering drugs to the cancer cells via endocytosis rather than passive diffussion. Materials and Methods As a model nanoparticle, Tetradrine (Tet, Pka 7.80) was incorporated into mPEG-PCL. The effectiveness of free Tet and Tet-NPs were compared at different extracellular pHs (pH values 6.8 and 7.4, respectively) by MTT assay, morphological observation and apoptotic analysis in vitro and on a murine model by tumor volume measurement, PET-CT scanning and side effect evaluation in vivo. Results The cytotoxicity of free Tet decreased prominently (P<0.05) when the extracellular pH decreased from 7.4 to 6.8. Meanwhile, the cytotoxicity of Tet-NPs was not significantly influenced by reduced pH. In vivo experiment also revealed that Tet-NPs reversed PIPDR more effectively than other existing methods and with much less side effects. Conclusion The reversion of PIPDR is a new discovered mechanism of copolymeric NPs. This study emphasized the importance of cancer microenvironmental factors in anticancer drug resistance and revealed the superiority of nanoscale drug carrier from a different aspect."
https://openalex.org/W2051459589,"The development of fishing efficiency coupled with an increase of fishing effort led to the overexploitation of numerous natural marine resources. In addition to this commercial pressure, the impact of recreational activities on fish assemblages remains barely known. Here we examined the impact of spearfishing limitation on resources in a marine protected area (MPA) and the benefit it provides for the local artisanal fishery through the use of a novel indicator. We analysed trends in the fish assemblage composition using artisanal fisheries data collected in the Bonifacio Strait Natural Reserve (BSNR), a Mediterranean MPA where the spearfishing activity has been forbidden over 15% of its area. Fish species were pooled into three response groups according to their target level by spearfishing. We developed the new flexible ReGS indicator reflecting shifts in species assemblages according to the relative abundance of each response group facing external pressure. The catch per unit effort (CPUE) increased by ca. 60% in the BSNR between 2000 and 2007, while the MPA was established in 1999. The gain of CPUE strongly depended on the considered response group: for the highly targeted group, the CPUE doubled while the CPUE of the untargeted group increased by only 15.5%. The ReGS value significantly increased from 0.31 to 0.45 (on a scale between 0 and 1) in the general perimeter of this MPA while it has reached a threshold of 0.43, considered as a reference point, in the area protected from spearfishing since 1982. Our results demonstrated that limiting recreational fishing by appropriate zoning in multiple-use MPAs represents a real benefit for artisanal fisheries. More generally we showed how our new indicator may reveal a wide range of impacts on coastal ecosystems such as global change or habitat degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2078503423,"Microvascular pericytes are of key importance in neoformation of blood vessels, in stabilization of newly formed vessels as well as maintenance of angiostasis in resting tissues. Furthermore, pericytes are capable of differentiating into pro-fibrotic collagen type I producing fibroblasts. The present study investigates the effects of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) on pericyte proliferation, cell viability, migration and differentiation. The results show that HDAC inhibition through exposure of pericytes to VPA in vitro causes the inhibition of pericyte proliferation and migration with no effect on cell viability. Pericyte exposure to the potent HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin A caused similar effects on pericyte proliferation, migration and cell viability. HDAC inhibition also inhibited pericyte differentiation into collagen type I producing fibroblasts. Given the importance of pericytes in blood vessel biology a qPCR array focusing on the expression of mRNAs coding for proteins that regulate angiogenesis was performed. The results showed that HDAC inhibition promoted transcription of genes involved in vessel stabilization/maturation in human microvascular pericytes. The present in vitro study demonstrates that VPA influences several aspects of microvascular pericyte biology and suggests an alternative mechanism by which HDAC inhibition affects blood vessels. The results raise the possibility that HDAC inhibition inhibits angiogenesis partly through promoting a pericyte phenotype associated with stabilization/maturation of blood vessels."

During TCR- or BCR-induced NF-κB activation, MALT1 serves to mediate the activation of the IKK (IκB kinase) complex, which subsequently regulates the activation of NF-κB. Aggregation of MALT1 is important for E3 ligase activation and NF-κB signaling.Unlike the isolated CARD or paracaspase domains, which behave as monomers, the tandem Ig-like domains of MALT1 exists as a mixture of dimer and tetramer in solution. High-resolution structures reveals a protein-protein interface that is stabilized by a buried surface area of 1256 Å(2) and contains numerous hydrogen and salt bonds. In conjunction with a second interface, these interactions may represent the basis of MALT1 oligomerization.The crystal structure of the tandem Ig-like domains reveals the oligomerization potential of MALT1 and a potential intermediate in the activation of the adaptive inflammatory pathway.This article can also be viewed as an enhanced version in which the text of the article is integrated with interactive 3D representations and animated transitions.

Whole-genome amplification of DNA from these samples could, potentially, overcome these limitations. However, little is known about the artefacts introduced by amplification of FFPE-derived DNA with regard to genotyping, and subsequent copy number and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analyses. Using a ligation adaptor amplification method, we present data from a total of 22 Affymetrix SNP 6.0 experiments, using matched paired amplified and non-amplified DNA from 10 LCM FFPE normal and dysplastic oral epithelial tissues, and an internal method control. An average of 76.5% of SNPs were called in both matched amplified and non-amplified DNA samples, and concordance was a promising 82.4%. Paired analysis for copy number, LOH, and both combined, showed that copy number changes were reduced in amplified DNA, but were 99.5% concordant when detected, amplifications were the changes most likely to be 'missed', only 30% of non-amplified LOH changes were identified in amplified pairs, and when copy number and LOH are combined ∼50% of gene changes detected in the unamplified DNA were also detected in the amplified DNA and within these changes, 86.5% were concordant for both copy number and LOH status. However, there are also changes introduced as ∼20% of changes in the amplified DNA are not detected in the non-amplified DNA. An integrative network biology approach revealed that changes in amplified DNA of dysplastic oral epithelium localize to topologically critical regions of the human protein-protein interaction network, suggesting their functional implication in the pathobiology of this disease. Taken together, our results support the use of amplification of FFPE-derived DNA, provided sufficient samples are used to increase power and compensate for increased error rates."
https://openalex.org/W1965004801,"Background Two pertussis toxin sensitive Gi proteins, Gi2 and Gi3, are expressed in cardiomyocytes and upregulated in heart failure. It has been proposed that the highly homologous Gi isoforms are functionally distinct. To test for isoform-specific functions of Gi proteins, we examined their role in the regulation of cardiac L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (L-VDCC). Methods Ventricular tissues and isolated myocytes were obtained from mice with targeted deletion of either Gαi2 (Gαi2−/−) or Gαi3 (Gαi3−/−). mRNA levels of Gαi/o isoforms and L-VDCC subunits were quantified by real-time PCR. Gαi and Cavα1 protein levels as well as protein kinase B/Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation levels were assessed by immunoblot analysis. L-VDCC function was assessed by whole-cell and single-channel current recordings. Results In cardiac tissue from Gαi2−/− mice, Gαi3 mRNA and protein expression was upregulated to 187±21% and 567±59%, respectively. In Gαi3−/− mouse hearts, Gαi2 mRNA (127±5%) and protein (131±10%) levels were slightly enhanced. Interestingly, L-VDCC current density in cardiomyocytes from Gαi2−/− mice was lowered (−7.9±0.6 pA/pF, n = 11, p<0.05) compared to wild-type cells (−10.7±0.5 pA/pF, n = 22), whereas it was increased in myocytes from Gαi3−/− mice (−14.3±0.8 pA/pF, n = 14, p<0.05). Steady-state inactivation was shifted to negative potentials, and recovery kinetics slowed in the absence of Gαi2 (but not of Gαi3) and following treatment with pertussis toxin in Gαi3−/−. The pore forming Cavα1 protein level was unchanged in all mouse models analyzed, similar to mRNA levels of Cavα1 and Cavβ2 subunits. Interestingly, at the cellular signalling level, phosphorylation assays revealed abolished carbachol-triggered activation of ERK1/2 in mice lacking Gαi2. Conclusion Our data provide novel evidence for an isoform-specific modulation of L-VDCC by Gαi proteins. In particular, loss of Gαi2 is reflected by alterations in channel kinetics and likely involves an impairment of the ERK1/2 signalling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2088616460,"Presynaptic Ca(V)2.1 channels, which conduct P/Q-type Ca(2+) currents, initiate synaptic transmission at most synapses in the central nervous system. Regulation of Ca(V)2.1 channels by CaM contributes significantly to short term facilitation and rapid depression of synaptic transmission. Short term synaptic plasticity is diverse in form and function at different synapses, yet CaM is ubiquitously expressed. Differential regulation of Ca(V)2.1 channels by CaM-like Ca(2+) sensor (CaS) proteins differentially affects short term synaptic facilitation and rapid synaptic depression in transfected sympathetic neuron synapses. Here, we define the molecular determinants for differential regulation of Ca(V)2.1 channels by the CaS protein calcium-binding protein-1 (CaBP1) by analysis of chimeras in which the unique structural domains of CaBP1 are inserted into CaM. Our results show that the N-terminal domain, including its myristoylation site, and the second EF-hand, which is inactive in Ca(2+) binding, are the key molecular determinants of differential regulation of Ca(V)2.1 channels by CaBP1. These findings give insight into the molecular code by which CaS proteins differentially regulate Ca(V)2.1 channel function and provide diversity of form and function of short term synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2097590047,"Based on growing evidence that some adult multipotent cells necessary for tissue regeneration reside in the walls of blood vessels and the clinical success of vein wrapping for functional repair of nerve damage, we hypothesized that the repair of nerves via vein wrapping is mediated by cells migrating from the implanted venous grafts into the nerve bundle.To test the hypothesis, severed femoral nerves of rats were grafted with venous grafts from animals of the opposite sex. Nerve regeneration was impaired when decellularized or irradiated venous grafts were used in comparison to untreated grafts, supporting the involvement of venous graft-derived cells in peripheral nerve repair. Donor cells bearing Y chromosomes integrated into the area of the host injured nerve and participated in remyelination and nerve regeneration. The regenerated nerve exhibited proper axonal myelination, and expressed neuronal and glial cell markers.These novel findings identify the mechanism by which vein wrapping promotes nerve regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2083410706,"Behavioral paradigms applied during human recordings in electro- and magneto- encephalography (EEG and MEG) typically require 1-2 hours of data collection. Over this time scale, the natural fluctuations in brain state or rapid learning effects could impact measured signals, but are seldom analyzed.We investigated within-session dynamics of neocortical alpha (7-14 Hz) rhythms and their allocation with cued-attention using MEG recorded from primary somatosensory neocortex (SI) in humans. We found that there were significant and systematic changes across a single ~1 hour recording session in several dimensions, including increased alpha power, increased differentiation in attention-induced alpha allocation, increased distinction in immediate time-locked post-cue evoked responses in SI to different visual cues, and enhanced power in the immediate cue-locked alpha band frequency response. Further, comparison of two commonly used baseline methods showed that conclusions on the evolution of alpha dynamics across a session were dependent on the normalization method used.These findings are important not only as they relate to studies of oscillations in SI, they also provide a robust example of the type of dynamic changes in brain measures within a single session that are overlooked in most human brain imaging/recording studies."
https://openalex.org/W2089671772,"Synaptic plasticity involves short- and long-term events, although the molecular mechanisms that underlie these processes are not fully understood. The transient A-type K+ current (IA) controls the excitability of the dendrites from CA1 pyramidal neurons by regulating the back-propagation of action potentials and shaping synaptic input. Here, we have studied how decreases in IA affect cognitive processes and synaptic plasticity. Using wild-type mice treated with 4-AP, an IA inhibitor, and mice lacking the DREAM protein, a transcriptional repressor and modulator of the IA, we demonstrate that impairment of IA decreases the stimulation threshold for learning and the induction of early-LTP. Hippocampal electrical recordings in both models revealed alterations in basal electrical oscillatory properties toward low-theta frequencies. In addition, we demonstrated that the facilitated learning induced by decreased IA requires the activation of NMDA receptors containing the NR2B subunit. Together, these findings point to a balance between the IA and the activity of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors in the regulation of learning."
https://openalex.org/W2095833105,"This study reports an alternative approach to achieve vitrification where cells are pre-desiccated prior to cooling to cryogenic temperatures for storage. Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells suspended in a trehalose solution were rapidly and uniformly desiccated to a low moisture content (<0.12 g of water per g of dry weight) using a spin-drying technique. Trehalose was also introduced into the cells using a high-capacity trehalose transporter (TRET1). Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to examine the uniformity of water concentration distribution in the spin-dried samples. 62% of the cells were shown to survive spin-drying in the presence of trehalose following immediate rehydration. The spin-dried samples were stored in liquid nitrogen (LN2) at a vitrified state. It was shown that following re-warming to room temperature and re-hydration with a fully complemented cell culture medium, 51% of the spin-dried and vitrified cells survived and demonstrated normal growth characteristics. Spin-drying is a novel strategy that can be used to improve cryopreservation outcome by promoting rapid vitrification."
https://openalex.org/W1976331200,"Immune responses have the important function of host defense and protection against pathogens. However, the immune response also causes inflammation and host tissue injury, termed immunopathology. For example, hepatitis B and C virus infection in humans cause immunopathological sequel with destruction of liver cells by the host's own immune response. Similarly, after infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in mice, the adaptive immune response causes liver cell damage, choriomeningitis and destruction of lymphoid organ architecture. The immunopathological sequel during LCMV infection has been attributed to cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. However, we now show that during LCMV infection CD4+ T cells selectively induced the destruction of splenic marginal zone and caused liver cell damage with elevated serum alanin-transferase (ALT) levels. The destruction of the splenic marginal zone by CD4+ T cells included the reduction of marginal zone B cells, marginal zone macrophages and marginal zone metallophilic macrophages. Functionally, this resulted in an impaired production of neutralizing antibodies against LCMV. Furthermore, CD4+ T cells reduced B cells with an IgMhighIgDlow phenotype (transitional stage 1 and 2, marginal zone B cells), whereas other B cell subtypes such as follicular type 1 and 2 and germinal center/memory B cells were not affected. Adoptive transfer of CD4+ T cells lacking different important effector cytokines and cytolytic pathways such as IFNγ, TNFα, perforin and Fas-FasL interaction did reveal that these cytolytic pathways are redundant in the induction of immunopathological sequel in spleen. In conclusion, our results define an important role of CD4+ T cells in the induction of immunopathology in liver and spleen. This includes the CD4+ T cell mediated destruction of the splenic marginal zone with consecutively impaired protective neutralizing antibody responses."
https://openalex.org/W1977449533,"Due to its diverse, wondrous plants and unique topography, Western China has drawn great attention from explorers and naturalists from the Western World. Among them, Ernest Henry Wilson (1876 –1930), known as ‘Chinese’ Wilson, travelled to Western China five times from 1899 to 1918. He took more than 1,000 photos during his travels. These valuable photos illustrated the natural and social environment of Western China a century ago. Since 1997, we had collected E.H. Wilson's old pictures, and then since 2004, along the expedition route of E.H. Wilson, we took 7 years to repeat photographing 250 of these old pictures. Comparing Wilson's photos with ours, we found an obvious warming trend over the 100 years, not only in specific areas but throughout the entire Western China. Such warming trend manifested in phenology changes, community shifts and melting snow in alpine mountains. In this study, we also noted remarkable vegetation changes. Out of 62 picture pairs were related to vegetation change, 39 indicated vegetation has changed to the better condition, 17 for degraded vegetation and six for no obvious change. Also in these photos at a century interval, we found not only rapid urbanization in Western China, but also the disappearance of traditional cultures. Through such comparisons, we should not only be amazed about the significant environmental changes through time in Western China, but also consider its implications for protecting environment while meeting the economic development beyond such changes."
https://openalex.org/W2075044339,"The ability to efficiently and economically generate libraries of defined pieces of DNA would have a myriad of applications, not least in the area of defined or directed sequencing and synthetic biology, but also in applications associated with encoding and tagging. In this manuscript DNA microarrays were used to allow the linear amplification of immobilized DNA sequences from the array followed by PCR amplification. Arrays of increasing sophistication (1, 10, 3,875, 10,000 defined sequences) were used to validate the process, with sequences verified by selective hybridization to a complementary DNA microarray and DNA sequencing, which demonstrated a PCR error rate of 9.7×10(-3)/site/duplication. This technique offers an economical and efficient way of producing specific DNA libraries of hundreds to thousands of members with the DNA-arrays being used as ""factories"" allowing specific DNA oligonucleotide pools to be generated. We also found substantial variance observed between the sequence frequencies found via Solexa sequencing and microarray analysis, highlighting the care needed in the interpretation of profiling data."
https://openalex.org/W2044825445,"Free-living nano-sized flagellates are important bacterivores in aquatic habitats. However, some slightly larger forms can also be omnivorous, i.e., forage upon both bacterial and eukaryotic resources. This hitherto largely ignored feeding mode may have pronounced implications for the interpretation of experiments about protistan bacterivory. We followed the response of an uncultured group of omnivorous cercozoan nanoflagellates from the Novel Clade 2 (Cerc_BAL02) to experimental food web manipulation in samples from the Gulf of Gdańsk (Southern Baltic Sea). Seawater was either prefiltered through 5 µm filters to exclude larger predators of nanoflagellates (F-treatment), or prefiltered and subsequently 1∶10 diluted with sterile seawater (F+D-treatment) to stimulate the growth of both, flagellates and bacteria. Initially, Cerc_BAL02 were rapidly enriched under both conditions. They foraged on both, eukaryotic prey and bacteria, and were highly competitive at low concentrations of food. However, these omnivores were later only successful in the F+D treatment, where they eventually represented almost one fifth of all aplastidic nanoflagellates. By contrast, their numbers stagnated in the F-treatment, possibly due to top-down control by a concomitant bloom of other, unidentified flagellates. In analogy with observations about the enrichment of opportunistically growing bacteria in comparable experimental setups we suggest that the low numbers of omnivorous Cerc_Bal02 flagellates in waters of the Gulf of Gdańsk might also be related to their vulnerability to grazing pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2062292584,"Carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) are found in polysaccharide-targeting enzymes and increase catalytic efficiency. Because only a relatively small number of CBM structures have been solved, computational modeling represents an alternative approach in conjunction with experimental assessment of CBM functionality and ligand-binding properties. An accurate target-template sequence alignment is the crucial step during homology modeling. However, low sequence identities between target/template sequences can be a major bottleneck. We therefore incorporated the predicted hydrophilic aromatic residues (HARs) and secondary structure elements into our feature-incorporated alignment (FIA) algorithm to increase CBM alignment accuracy. An alignment performance comparison for FIA and six others was made, and the greatest average sequence identities and similarities were achieved by FIA. In addition, structure models were built for 817 representative CBMs. Our models possessed the smallest average surface-potential z scores. Besides, a large true positive value for liagnd-binding aromatic residue prediction was obtained by HAR identification. Finally, the pre-simulated CBM structures have been deposited in the Database of Simulated CBM structures (DS-CBMs). The web service is publicly available at http://dscbm.life.nthu.edu.tw/ and http://dscbm.cs.ntou.edu.tw/."
https://openalex.org/W2035725901,"Functional mapping has been a powerful tool in mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying dynamic traits of agricultural or biomedical interest. In functional mapping, multivariate normality is often assumed for the underlying data distribution, partially due to the ease of parameter estimation. The normality assumption however could be easily violated in real applications due to various reasons such as heavy tails or extreme observations. Departure from normality has negative effect on testing power and inference for QTL identification. In this work, we relax the normality assumption and propose a robust multivariate -distribution mapping framework for QTL identification in functional mapping. Simulation studies show increased mapping power and precision with the distribution than that of a normal distribution. The utility of the method is demonstrated through a real data analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2076300931,"Aortic arch anomalies (AAA) are rare cardio-vascular anomalies. Right-sided and double-sided aortic arch anomalies (RAAA, DAAA) are distinguished, both may cause airway obstructions. We studied the degree of airway obstruction in infants with AAA by neonatal lung function testing (LFT).17 patients (10 RAAA and 7 DAAA) with prenatal diagnosis of AAA were investigated. The median (range) post conception age at LFT was 40.3 (36.6-44.1) weeks, median body weight 3400 (2320-4665) g. Measurements included tidal breathing flow-volume loops (TBFVL), airway resistance (R(aw)) by bodyplethysmography and the maximal expiratory flow at functional residual capacity (V'(max)FRC) by rapid thoracic-abdominal compression (RTC) technique. V'(max)FRC was also expressed in Z-scores, based on published gender-, age and height-specific reference values.Abnormal lung function tests were seen in both RAAA and DAAA infants. Compared to RAAA infants, infants with DAAA had significantly more expiratory flow limitations in the TBFVL, (86% vs. 30%, p<0.05) and a significantly increased R(aw) (p = 0.015). Despite a significant correlation between R(aw) and the Z-score of V'(max)FRC (r = 0.740, p<0.001), there were no statistically significant differences in V'(max)FRC and it's Z-scores between RAAA and DAAA infants. 4 (24%) infants (2 RAAA, 2 DAAA) were near or below the 10(th) percentile of V'(max)FRC, indicating a high risk for airway obstruction.Both, infants with RAAA and DAAA, are at risk for airway obstruction and early LFT helps to identify and to monitor these infants. This may support the decision for therapeutic interventions before clinical symptoms arise."
