https://openalex.org/W2105796581,"Changes in oceanic primary production, linked to changes in the network of global biogeochemical cycles, have profoundly influenced the geochemistry of Earth for over 3 billion years. In the contemporary ocean, photosynthetic carbon fixation by marine phytoplankton leads to formation of approximately 45 gigatons of organic carbon per annum, of which 16 gigatons are exported to the ocean interior. Changes in the magnitude of total and export production can strongly influence atmospheric CO2 levels (and hence climate) on geological time scales, as well as set upper bounds for sustainable fisheries harvest. The two fluxes are critically dependent on geophysical processes that determine mixed-layer depth, nutrient fluxes to and within the ocean, and food-web structure. Because the average turnover time of phytoplankton carbon in the ocean is on the order of a week or less, total and export production are extremely sensitive to external forcing and consequently are seldom in steady state. Elucidating the biogeochemical controls and feedbacks on primary production is essential to understanding how oceanic biota responded to and affected natural climatic variability in the geological past, and will respond to anthropogenically influenced changes in coming decades. One of the most crucial feedbacks results from changes in radiative forcing on the hydrological cycle, which influences the aeolian iron flux and, in turn, affects nitrogen fixation and primary production in the oceans."

This designed small ligand is membrane-permeant and nonfluorescent until it binds with high affinity and specificity to the tetracysteine domain. Such in situ labeling adds much less mass than does green fluorescent protein and offers greater versatility in attachment sites as well as potential spectroscopic and chemical properties. This system provides a recipe for slightly modifying a target protein so that it can be singled out from the many other proteins inside live cells and fluorescently stained by small nonfluorescent dye molecules added from outside the cells."
https://openalex.org/W2145047965,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been proposed to participate in the induction of cardiac preconditioning. However, their source and mechanism of induction are unclear. We tested whether brief hypoxia induces preconditioning by augmenting mitochondrial generation of ROS in chick cardiomyocytes. Cells were preconditioned with 10 min of hypoxia, followed by 1 h of simulated ischemia and 3 h of reperfusion. Preconditioning decreased cell death from 47 ± 3% to 14 ± 2%. Return of contraction was observed in 3/3 preconditioned versus 0/6 non-preconditioned experiments. During induction, ROS oxidation of the probe dichlorofluorescin (sensitive to H2O2) increased ∼2.5-fold. As a substitute for hypoxia, the addition of H2O2 (15 μmol/liter) during normoxia also induced preconditioning-like protection. Conversely, the ROS signal during hypoxia was attenuated with the thiol reductant 2-mercaptopropionyl glycine, the cytosolic Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase inhibitor diethyldithiocarbamic acid, and the anion channel inhibitor 4,4′-diisothiocyanato-stilbene-2,2′-disulfonate, all of which also abrogated protection. ROS generation during hypoxia was attenuated by myxothiazol, but not by diphenyleneiodonium or the nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor l-nitroarginine. We conclude that hypoxia increases mitochondrial superoxide generation which initiates preconditioning protection. Furthermore, mitochondrial anion channels and cytosolic dismutation to H2O2 may be important steps for oxidant induction of hypoxic preconditioning.

Myocardial preconditioning was initially described as an adaptive response of the heart to brief episodes of ischemia that decreased necrosis during subsequent prolonged ischemia (1Murry C.E.

Goto M. Downey J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 207-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Evidence for this role includes intact heart studies where exposure to superoxide or H2O2caused preconditioning-like protection (2Baines C.P. Goto M. Downey J.M. J. Mol. Cell.

J. 1994; 58: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Few studies have directly measured ROS generation during brief hypoxia or ischemia induction (6Zhou X. Zhai X. Ashraf M. Circulation. 1997; 93: 1177-1184Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Such direct measures are needed to clarify important questions that remain regarding the role of ROS as inducing agents, including their source, where they are metabolized, and the relative contributions of different oxidant species to the induction of preconditioning protection.Within the intact heart, possible sources of ROS include the cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, neutrophils, or the auto-oxidation of catecholamines (7Ferrari R. Ceconi C. Curello S. Alfieri O. Visioli O. Eur. Heart. J. 1993; 14: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 8Hess M.L. Manson N.H. J. Mol. Cell.

Within cardiomyocytes, sources of ROS could include superoxide generation from NAD(P)H or other oxidases such as cytochrome P450 (9Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L. J. Biol.

Although it is likely that superoxide is the initial oxidant generated from these systems, the relative importance of superoxide, or its reduced products H2O2 or hydroxyl radical, in the signal transduction system involved in preconditioning is not known. Some evidence suggests that either superoxide or hydrogen peroxide can initiate preconditioning (2Baines C.P. Goto M. Downey J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 207-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 16Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ischaemia: Preconditioning and Adaptation. 1996: 21-34Google Scholar), so it is conceivable that H2O2 is the active signaling agent in this process.The purpose of our study was to investigate the role of mitochondrial ROS in the induction of hypoxic preconditioning, and to clarify which ROS are required for the preconditioning response. For this study, we used chick cardiomycytes, which have been shown to precondition with brief hypoxia (18Liang B.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H1769-H1777PubMed Google Scholar, 19Strickler J. Jacobson K.A. Liang B.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1773-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Microscope Perfusion SystemCardiac Culture PreparationEmbryonic ventricular cardiac myocytes were prepared as described previously (20Vanden Hoek T.L. Shao Z. Li C. Zak R. Schumacker P.T. Becker L.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H1334-H1341PubMed Google Scholar). Heart ventricles from 10-day-old chick embryos were dissected, minced, enzymatically dispersed with 0.025% trypsin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and centrifuged differentially to yield 5–6 × 105cells/embryo. Cells (0.7 × 106) were pipetted onto coverslips, incubated, and grown into contractile layers. Synchronous contractions were seen by the third day in culture. Cultures were checked for non-muscle cell contamination (greater than 95% of cells stain with anti-myosin heavy chain monoclonal antibodies, CCM-52). Experiments were performed with 3–5-day cardiac cell cultures, at which point viability exceeded 99%.Perfusion ChamberCoverslips with synchronously contracting cells were placed inside a Sykes-Moore chamber (1.2-ml volume, Bellco Glass Inc., Vineland, NJ). The chamber and inflow tubing were maintained at 37 °C. Flow rate (0.25 ml/min), pH, and oxygen tension (PO2) of the perfusate were controlled. Hypoxic conditions were verified with an optical method of phosphorescence quenching (Oxyspot, Medical Systems Inc, Greenvale, NY) (21Lo L.W. Koch C.J. Wilson D.F. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). An extracellular Pd-porphine dye bound to albumin (1–10 μm) was added to the perfusate, and the PO2-dependent phosphorescence decay was recorded in response to pulsed excitation light. Perfusion with hypoxic media resulted in measured PO2 values of 3 torr within the chamber during steady state perfusion. Tubing supplying perfusate to the chamber was of low O2 permeability, constructed of PharMed (Cole-Parmer Instrument Co., Chicago, IL) or stainless steel to minimize O2 leaks.Perfusion Media CompositionStandard perfusion media consisted of oxygenated balanced salt solution (BSS) with a PO2 of 100 torr, PCO2 of 40, pH of 7.4, [K+] of 4.0 mEq/liter, and a glucose of 5.6 mm. Simulated ischemia consisted of BSS containing no glucose, with 2-deoxyglucose (20 mm) added to inhibit glycolysis and a [K+] of 8.0 mEq/liter. This was bubbled with 80% N2 gas and 20% CO2 to produce a PO2 of less than 3 torr, a PCO2 of 144 torr, and a final pH of 6.8. Hypoxic media used for preconditioning consisted of BSS with no glucose, bubbled with 95% N2 gas and 5% CO2. Reperfusion was with standard media unless stated otherwise.Video/Fluorescent MicroscopyCells were imaged with an Olympus IMT-2 inverted phase/epifluorescent microscope equipped with Hoffman Modulation optics to accentuate surface topology of the cells. This facilitated detection of contractile movement in the confluent layer of cells. Phase-contrast images were recorded for contraction analysis with a CCD camera. Fluorescence was measured using a cooled Hamamatsu slow-scanning PC-controlled camera (Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu City, Japan) coupled with Image-One software (Image Pro Plus) for quantification of changes in emission fluorescence. Measurements of propidium iodide (PI) fluorescence to assess membrane integrity were made using an excitation of 540 nm, with 580-nm long pass and 590-nm band pass filters. Dichlorofluorescein (DCF) fluorescence used to assess oxidant generation was measured using excitation light of 480 nm, with 510-nm long pass and 520-nm band pass filters. An additional marker of oxidant generation, dihydroethidium (DHE), which becomes oxidized and bound as the fluorescent complex ethidium-DNA, was measured using the same filter settings used to visualize PI. To prevent interference between PI and DHE oxidation measurements, separate studies were conducted with one or the other of these probes.Viability AssayCell viability was quantified over time using the nuclear stain PI (5 μm, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), an exclusion fluorescent dye that binds to chromatin upon loss of membrane integrity. This method is similar in principle to trypan blue staining, and has been reported to predict the transition from reversible to irreversible cell injury in cultured cardiomyocytes (22Bond J.M. Herman B. Lemasters J.J. Res. Commun. Chem. Pathol. Pharm. 1991; 71: 195-208PubMed Google Scholar). PI is not toxic to cells over a course of 8 h, permitting its addition to the perfusate throughout the experiment. At the end of each experiment using PI, all nuclei in a field of approximately 500 cells were stained by permeabilizing cells with digitonin (300 μm). Percent loss of viability (i.e. cell death) over time was expressed relative to the maximal value seen after digitonin exposure (100%).Measurement of Intracellular ROS GenerationIntracellular oxidant stress was monitored by measuring changes in fluorescence resulting from intracellular probe oxidation. DHE (1–10 μm, Molecular Probes) enters the cell and can be oxidized by ROS including superoxide and/or hydroxyl radical to yield fluorescent ethidium (Eth). Eth binds to DNA (Eth-DNA), further amplifying its fluorescence (23Carter W.O. Narayanan P.K. Robinson J.P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 253-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Eth-DNA fluorescence is generally stable, but can be decreased with severe hydroxyl radical attack (24Prutz W.A. Radiat. Environ. Biophys. 1984; 23: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, increases in DHE oxidation to Eth-DNA (i.e. increases in Eth-DNA fluorescence) are suggestive of superoxide generation (25Vanden Hoek T.L. Li C. Shao Z. Schumacker P.T. Becker L.B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2571-2583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar).The probe 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA, 5 μm, Molecular Probes) enters the cell and the acetate group on DCFH-DA is cleaved by cellular esterases, trapping the nonfluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin (DCFH) inside. Subsequent oxidation by ROS, particularly hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl radical, yields the fluorescent product DCF (23Carter W.O. Narayanan P.K. Robinson J.P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 253-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, increases in DCFH oxidation to DCF (i.e. increases in DCF fluorescence) are suggestive of H2O2 or hydroxyl generation (25Vanden Hoek T.L. Li C. Shao Z. Schumacker P.T. Becker L.B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2571-2583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar).The reported specificities of these two probes for different ROS have been verified in multiple cuvette and chick cardiomyocyte experiments, and have been described previously (25Vanden Hoek T.L. Li C. Shao Z. Schumacker P.T. Becker L.B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2571-2583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar).Cell ContractionCell contractions were observed as described previously (26Vanden Hoek T.L. Shao Z. Li C. Schumacker P.T. Becker L.B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2441-2450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The criteria for a return of contraction was met if observable contractions were seen throughout the field of cells following the 3-h period of reperfusion. A single field of cells was monitored for contractions throughout each experiment.Preconditioning ProtocolsIn the ischemia/reperfusion protocol, cardiomyocytes were exposed to 1 h of simulated ischemia (simultaneous hypoxia, hypercarbic acidosis, hyperkalemia, and substrate deprivation) followed by 3 h of reperfusion. Previous work has shown that this yields significant cell death during reperfusion that appears to result from oxidant injury (20Vanden Hoek T.L. Shao Z. Li C. Zak R. Schumacker P.T. Becker L.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H1334-H1341PubMed Google Scholar, 25Vanden Hoek T.L. Li C. Shao Z. Schumacker P.T. Becker L.B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2571-2583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). To induce preconditioning, cardiomyocytes were exposed to 10 min of hypoxia (PO2 = 3 torr) without glucose, followed by 10 min of normoxic recovery in BSS prior to subsequent ischemia/reperfusion. Cell viability, contraction, and oxidant generation were measured during preconditioning induction and during subsequent ischemia and reperfusion. These results were compared with non-preconditioned cells studied under identical conditions.Data AnalysisData were collected and simple descriptive analyses were performed. An individual experiment (n) was the result of observations of a single field of approximately 500 cells on a coverslip. Replicates were performed on separate coverslips. Results are reported as means plus or minus S.E. For tests of significance, analysis of variance and two-tailed paired t tests were performed, with p < 0.05 considered to be significant.DISCUSSIONOur results show that 10 min of hypoxia in chick cardiomyocytes elicits a transient increase in ROS generation, predominantly H2O2. This ROS signal was attenuated by the mitochondrial site III electron transport inhibitor myxothiazol, but not NAD(P)H oxidase or nitric-oxide synthase inhibitors. These results suggest that the ROS generated during hypoxia originated from the mitochondria. Protection against subsequent ischemia and reperfusion was reversed by agents that attenuated this H2O2 signal. In that regard, the thiol-reducing agent 2-MPG, the cytosolic SOD inhibitor DDC, and the anion channel inhibitor DIDS all abolished preconditioning protection. Finally, transient exogenous H2O2 administration during normoxia induced preconditioning-like protection. We conclude that ROS participate in the signal transduction pathways involved in hypoxic preconditioning in this model. These ROS appear to originate as superoxide from the mitochondrial electron transport chain, which enter the cytosol via anion channels. There, dismutation by Cu,Zn-SOD appears to be necessary for the activation of subsequent steps involved in preconditioning protection.Oxidants as Signaling Molecules for the Induction of PreconditioningDo Oxidants Induce Preconditioning?Our data are consistent with studies that have indirectly implicated ROS as signaling agents that elicit preconditioning. Most previous studies have been done in intact hearts and show that antioxidants given during ischemic preconditioning abrogate its protective effect against ischemia/reperfusion injury (4Tanaka M. Fujiwara H. Yamasaki K. Sasayama S. Cardiovasc. Res. 1994; 28: 980-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 33Murry C.E. Richard V.J. Jennings R.B. Reimer K.A. Circulation. 1988; 78 (abstr.): 77Google Scholar). However, our study extends previous work by identifying mitochondria as the source of ROS responsible for induction, and by showing that these ROS are generated during hypoxic preconditioning rather than at reoxygenation. Some previous studies were not able to abolish preconditioning with antioxidants (5Osada M. Takeda S. Sato T. Komori S. Tamura K. Jpn. Circ. J. 1994; 58: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 34Richard V. Tron C. Thuillez C. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 2016-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the type of antioxidant, its dose, or the timing of administration did not attenuate the oxidant signal responsible for induction. Our measurements of ROS generation indicated that the antioxidant compounds were acting as expected, and more directly support a role for ROS in the induction of hypoxic preconditioning.Which Reactive Oxygen Species Participate in the Initiation of Preconditioning?Our results show that hypoxic preconditioning is associated with significant oxidation of DCFH (sensitive to H2O2), and with significant DHE oxidation (sensitive to superoxide) when Cu,Zn-SOD is inhibited. Thus, a predominant ROS pathway during hypoxic preconditioning appears to involve H2O2 generated from superoxide metabolism. However, the specificity of these fluorescent probes for different reactive species is limited, so the precise delineation of each ROS is not possible. Nevertheless, the suggested role of H2O2 as the ROS trigger for preconditioning is supported by the observations that exogenous H2O2 can induce preconditioning-like protection during normoxia and that SOD inhibition, which increases superoxide (DHE oxidation) generation relative to H2O2formation, abolishes the protective effects of preconditioning.These results are consistent with other studies showing that exogenous superoxide or H2O2 can produce preconditioning-like protection in the intact heart (2Baines C.P. Goto M. Downey J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 207-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 3Tritto I. D'Andrea D. Eramo N. Scognamiglio A. De Simone C. Violante A.

Circulation. 1995; 92 (abstr.): I-717Google Scholar). Both superoxide and H2O2 have been shown to activate putative mediators of preconditioning such as protein kinase C and phospholipase D (16Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6758-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 36Larsson R. Cerutti P. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5627-5632PubMed Google Scholar, 37Natarajan V. Taher M.M. Roehm B. Parinandi N.L. Schmid H.H.O. Kiss Z. Garcia J.G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 930-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As with our study, it is possible that superoxide could have induced preconditioning in those studies via increased intracellular [H2O2]. However, previous studies involving exogenous superoxide did not employ an SOD inhibitor, so it is difficult to know whether superoxide itself or H2O2 was responsible for eliciting preconditioning protection. Generally, H2O2would appear to be a more likely signaling element because it can cross intracellular membranes more readily than superoxide, and has been shown to directly modify the regulatory domain of protein kinase C resulting in its activation (16Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6758-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar).Mitochondria as the Major Source of ROS GenerationMany potential sites of ROS production exist in the intact heart (8Hess M.L.

Nutr. 1991; 53: 215S-222SCrossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition, neutrophils and other humoral inflammatory mediators localized in the microcirculation may release ROS in intact heart (7Ferrari R. Ceconi C. Curello S. Alfieri O. Visioli O. Eur. Heart. J. 1993; 14: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, the chick cardiomyocyte cultures used in the present study do not contain inflammatory or endothelial cells, or significant amounts of xanthine oxidase (39Fisher J.R. Dev. Biol. 1967; 15: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), so the contribution from non-cardiomyocyte systems to ROS generation is unlikely. NAD(P)H and mixed function oxidases also seem unlikely as a source of ROS because DPI, an inhibitor of these flavoproteins (11Mohazzab-H K.M. Kaminski P.M. Wolin M.S. Circulation. 1997; 96: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), did not attenuate ROS generation during hypoxia. Also, superoxide generation by NADH oxidase would be expected to decrease as [O2] decreases (11Mohazzab-H K.M. Kaminski P.M. Wolin M.S. Circulation. 1997; 96: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), whereas our studies revealed an increase in ROS generation during hypoxia. Regarding NOS as a potential oxidant source during induction, our results showed an increase in ROS generation when NOS was inhibited. Thus, it is unlikely that nitric oxide is the oxidant signal responsible for inducing preconditioning. In addition, both N-nitro-l-arginine and DPI have been reported to abolish superoxide generation from NOS (15Xia Y. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. Zweier J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Our data, along with the work of others, implicate the mitochondrial electron transport chain as an important source of free radicals in isolated cells (7Ferrari R. Ceconi C. Curello S. Alfieri O. Visioli O. Eur. Heart. J. 1993; 14: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 40Dawson T.L. Gores G.J. Nieminen A.L. Herman B. Lemasters J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C961-C967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mitchondrial inhibitor myxothiazol decreased the ROS generation during hypoxic preconditioning, suggesting that these ROS originated from the cytochrome b-c 1 segment of complex III in the respiratory chain (41Thierbach G. Reichenbach H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 638: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). This result is consistent with work by others who have found that two segments of the respiratory chain are primarily responsible for superoxide generation: the reduced flavin mononucleotide of NADH dehydrogenase in complex I (42Turrens J.F. Boveris A. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar) and the ubisemiquinone associated with the cytochromeb-c 1 segment of complex III (29Turrens J.F. Alexandre A. Lehninger A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 237: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). Because myxothiazol abolished the ROS generation during hypoxia, and DPI (expected to inhibit the flavoprotein NADH dehydrogenase) had no detectable effect, it is likely that complex III is the predominant source of superoxide.The data also show that the ROS generation and protection associated with preconditioning is abolished with the anion channel inhibitor DIDS. Thus, superoxide would appear to enter the cytosol via mitochondrial anion channels. Anion channels are known to transport superoxide across membranes (32Paky A. Michael J.R. Burke-Wolin T.M. Wolin M.S. Gurtner G.H. J. Appl. Physiol. 1993; 74: 2868-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and have been described on both the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes (43Sampson M.J.

Biomembr. 1996; 28: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). No studies to date have investigated the importance of such channels to the induction of preconditioning, but further studies are needed to clarify their importance.Although previous studies have demonstrated the potentially destructive role of ROS generated during prolonged ischemia/reperfusion (12Ambrosio G. Zweier J.L. Duilio C. Kuppusamy P. Santoro G. Elia P.P. Tritto I. Cirillo P. Condorelli M. Chiarello M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18532-18541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a growing body of data suggests that signaling levels of ROS generated by mitochondria may activate intracellular signaling cascades involved in protective responses. In this regard, recent studies have shown that mitochondrial ROS generated during prolonged, moderate hypoxia appear to participate in the reversible suppression of ATP utilization and contraction in cardiomyocytes (45Duranteau J. Chandel N.S. Kulisz A. Shao Z. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273 (in press)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (572) Google Scholar). The present study extends those findings by revealing that mitochondrial ROS generated during brief anoxia can also activate signaling cascades involved in protecting cardiomyocytes from subsequent ischemia/reperfusion injury. Myocardial preconditioning was initially described as an adaptive response of the heart to brief episodes of ischemia that decreased necrosis during subsequent prolonged ischemia (1Murry C.E. Jennings R.B. Reimer K.A. Circulation. 198"
https://openalex.org/W2145411765,"The role of climatic variation in regulating marine populations and communities is not well understood. To improve our knowledge, the sign, amplitude, and frequency of climatic and biotic variations should be compared as a necessary first step. It is shown that there have been large interannual and interdecadal sea-surface temperature changes off the West Coast of North America during the past 80 years. Interannual anomalies appear and disappear rather suddenly and synchronously along the entire coastline. The frequency of warm events has increased since 1977. Although extensive, serial, biological observations are often incomplete, it is clear that climate-ocean variations have disturbed and changed our coastal ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2064026305,"REVIEW The coastal seas are one of the most valuable and vulnerable of Earth's habitats. Significant inputs of nutrients to the coastal zone arrive via rivers, groundwater, and the atmosphere. Nutrient fluxes through these routes have been increased by human activity. In addition, the N:P:Si ratios of these inputs have been perturbed, and many coastal management practices exacerbate these perturbations. There is evidence of impacts arising from these changes (in phytoplankton numbers and relative species abundance, and deep-water oxygen declines) in areas of restricted water exchange. Elsewhere, the nutrient fluxes through the coastal zone appear to be still dominated by large inputs from the open ocean, and there is little evidence of anthropogenic perturbations."
https://openalex.org/W2011287943,"The Rad53 protein kinase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is required for checkpoints that prevent cell division in cells with damaged or incompletely replicated DNA. The Rad9 protein was phosphorylated in response to DNA damage, and phosphorylated Rad9 interacted with the COOH-terminal forkhead homology–associated (FHA) domain of Rad53. Inactivation of this domain abolished DNA damage–dependent Rad53 phosphorylation, G 2 /M cell cycle phase arrest, and increase of RNR3 transcription but did not affect replication inhibition–dependent Rad53 phosphorylation. Thus, Rad53 integrates DNA damage signals by coupling with phosphorylated Rad9. The hitherto uncharacterized FHA domain appears to be a modular protein-binding domain."

Numerous proteins are transported into the bacterial periplasmic space by means of N-terminal extensions, termed signal peptides, that direct their translocation across the plasma membrane by the Sec apparatus (reviewed in Ref. 1Johnson K. Murphy C.K. Beckwith J. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1992; 3: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The translocation of substrates by this system involves the participation of both cytoplasmic and membrane-bound components; the soluble components, SecB and SecA, serve to prevent folding of the protein until it is directed to the membrane-bound translocase, a complex of SecYEG together with several less well defined ancillary proteins. Translocation of a partially unfolded substrate protein through the SecYEG complex is then driven by the ATPase function of the SecA protein.The Sec apparatus recognizes signal peptides that contain three characteristic domains: an N-terminal charged domain (usually basic), a hydrophobic core domain and a more polar C-terminal domain (reviewed in Ref. 2Izard J.W. Kendall D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Similar signals have been shown to target proteins across the chloroplast thylakoid membrane (3Nakai M. Goto A. Nohara T. Sugita D. Endo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31338-31341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it is now clear that a prokaryotic-like Sec system operates in this membrane, presumably inherited from the cyanobacterial-type progenitor of the chloroplast (4Yuan J.

Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 431-437Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) have pointed to the existence of a parallel pathway that requires neither soluble factors nor ATP but that is instead completely reliant on the thylakoidal ΔpH (7Mould R.M.

Remarkably, the substrates on this pathway are synthesized with signal-type peptides (transfer peptides) that nevertheless direct translocation only by the ΔpH-dependent pathway (11Robinson C. Cai D.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10189-10192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dominant factor in this sorting process is the presence of a twin-arginine motif immediately upstream of the hydrophobic domain that is essential for translocation by the ΔpH-dependent system (13Chaddock A.M. Mant A. Karnauchov I. Brink S. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. Robinson C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2715-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The structure of this Sec-independent system has been unclear for some time, but a recent study on a maize mutant has resulted in the cloning of a gene, hcf106, encoding the first component (14Settles M.A. Yonetani A. Baron A. Bush D.R. Cline K. Martienssen R. Science. 1997; 278: 1467-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The Hcf106 protein is localized in the thylakoid membrane and appears to comprise a single transmembrane span with the bulk of the protein exposed to the stromal phase.There is now clear evidence for the existence of a similar system in prokaryotes. It has been pointed out (15Berks B.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) that a subset of exported proteins are synthesized with twin-Arg-containing presequences, and this applies particularly to proteins that bind any of a range of complex redox cofactors, such as iron-sulfur clusters or molybdopterin cofactors. These cofactors are apparently inserted in the cytoplasm (15Berks B.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), which may well require the folding of substantial sections of the protein and hence preclude translocation by the Sec machinery. Consistent with this idea, one such protein has been found to be exported in a Sec-independent manner in Escherichia coli(16Santini C.-L. Ize B. Chanal A. Müller M. Giordano G. Wu L.-F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Finally, homologues of Hcf106 are encoded by previously unassigned open reading frames in the majority of eubacterial and archaeal genomes, and recent studies on E. coli have shown that these homologues are indeed involved in Sec-independent protein export. However, the precise role of these proteins has been the subject of some confusion. Weiner et al. (17Weiner J.H. Bilous P.T. Shaw G.M. Lubitz S.P. Frost L. Thomas G.H. Cole J.A. Turner R.J.

The product of this gene appeared to be homologous to Hcf106, and the gene was proposed to form an operon with two further genes, mttB and mttC. However, it now transpires that the operon structure is more complex than was at first apparent; we have recently shown that this operon comprises four distinct genes because of the presence of a stop codon in the gene identified as mttA. The first gene in this operon is homologous to hcf106, whereas the gene affected in the Weiner et al. (17Weiner J.H. Bilous P.T. Shaw G.M. Lubitz S.P. Frost L. Thomas G.H. Cole J.A. Turner R.J.

Disruption of the authentichcf106 homologue was found to adversely affect the export of several cofactor-containing proteins, and a complete block in the export of four proteins was observed in a double mutant in which a second, unlinked hcf106 homologue was also disrupted. The four genes in the above operon were designated tatABCD (fortwin-arginine translocation pathway), and the unlinked hcf106 homologue was designatedtatE.The components of the Sec-independent translocase analyzed to date (the Hcf106 homologues TatA and TatE) together with the gene product mutated in the Weiner et al.

Because tatC homologues are present only in those prokaryotic genomes with genes for Hcf106-like proteins and are in many cases linked to such genes, we considered TatC a potential additional component of the Sec-independent protein export system. In this report we show that TatC plays a particularly crucial role in the translocation mechanism, and we show that homologues are present in a wide range of bacteria, plastids, and mitochondria.

We show that, in hamster fibroblasts (CCL39 cells), VEGF mRNAs are expressed at low levels in serum-deprived or exponentially growing cells, whereas it is rapidly induced after stimulation of quiescent cells with serum. CCL39 derivatives, transformed with Polyoma virus or with active members of the p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, Gly/Val point mutant of Ras at position 12 (Ras-Val12), MKK1 in which Ser218 and Ser222 were mutated to Asp (MKK1-SS/DD)), express very high levels of VEGF mRNA. To analyze the contribution of the p42/p44MAP kinase in this induction, we used the CCL39-derived cell line (Raf-1:ER) expressing an estradiol-activable Raf-1. We show a time and an estradiol dose-dependent up-regulation of VEGF mRNA clearly detectable after 2 h of stimulation. The induction of VEGF mRNA in response to conditioned activation of Raf-1 is reverted by an inhibitor of MKK1, PD 098059, highlighting a specific role for the p42/p44 MAP kinase pathway in VEGF expression. Interestingly, hypoxia has an additive effect on VEGF induction in CCL39 cells stimulated by serum or in Raf-1:ER cells stimulated by estradiol. In contrast to VEGF, the isoforms VEGF-B and VEGF-C are poorly regulated by growth and oncogenic factors. We have identified a GC-rich region of the VEGF promoter between −88 and −66 base pairs which contains all the elements responsible of its up-regulation by constitutive active Ras or MKK1-SS/DD. By mutation of the putative binding sites and electrophoretic mobility supershift experiments, we showed that the GC-rich region constitutively binds Sp1 and AP-2 transcription factors. Furthermore, following activation of the p42/p44 MAP kinase module, the binding of Sp1 and AP-2 is increased in the complexes formed in this region of the promoter.

Furthermore, following activation of the p42/p44 MAP kinase module, the binding of Sp1 and AP-2 is increased in the complexes formed in this region of the promoter. Altogether, these data suggest that hypoxia and p42/p44 MAP kinase independently play a key role in the regulation of the VEGF expression. Angiogenesis is a fundamental physiological process by which new blood vessels are formed (1Folkman J. Merler E. Abernathy C. William G. J. Exp.

Many tissues and cell types express VEGF mRNA, especially tissues which are highly vascularized in addition to tumor-derived cell lines (13Berse B. Brown L.F. Van de Water L. Dvorak H.F. Senger D.R.

Stimulation of serum-deprived NIH 3T3 cells by PDGF also results in VEGF induction in a Ras- and Raf-dependent manner (14Grugel S. Finkenzeller G. Weindel K. Barleon B. Marmé D. J. Biol.

Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4891) Google Scholar), it is of primary importance to decipher the growth factor-activated signaling pathways involved in controlling its expression. In the present report, we have compared the expression of VEGF in resting, serum-stimulated, or oncogenically transformed CCL39 fibroblasts (18Seuwen K. Lagarde A. Pouysségur J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 19Brunet A. Pagès G. Pouysségur J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3379-3387PubMed Google Scholar). Exploiting a CCL39-derived cell line in which Raf-1 can be rapidly activated by estradiol (Raf-1:ER) (20Samuels M.L. Weber J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 21Samuels M.L. McMahon M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 14: 7855-7866Crossref Google Scholar, 22Lenormand P. McMahon M. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15762-15768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that the p42/p44 MAP kinase cascade is critical in the control of VEGF expression. To further characterize the effect of constitutively active Ras or MKK1 on the VEGF expression, we have assayed different constructs of the VEGF promoter in order to define cis-active regions sufficient to promote regulation of VEGF transcription by members of the p42/p44 MAP kinase module. By electrophoretic mobility assays (EMSAs) and supershift assays, we also defined transcription factors whose binding on the VEGF promoter is regulated through p42/p44 MAP kinase cascade. The established Chinese hamster lung fibroblast line CCL39 (American Type Culture Collection), their derivatives PS120 and PS200, which lack NHE1 antiporter activity (23Pouysségur J. Sardet C. Franchi A. L'Allemain G. Paris S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4833-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), and corresponding transfected cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 7.5% fetal calf serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin sulfate (50 μg/ml). Growth-arrested cells were obtained by total deprivation of serum for 16–24 h. Raf-1:ER cells (clone 18 or 19) are a derivative of CCL39, and they stably expressed a fusion protein between the catalytic domain of Raf-1 and the hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor (20Samuels M.L. Weber J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 21Samuels M.L. McMahon M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 14: 7855-7866Crossref Google Scholar, 22Lenormand P.

These cells were cultivated in the same medium described above without phenol red to reduce the basal activity of the Raf-1:ER construct. Hypoxia was generated by placing the cells in hermetic jars together with the Gas Pak Plus system from Becton Dickinson. In this system, hydrogen generated from sodium borohydride following the addition of water combines with the oxygen present in the jar in the presence of palladium catalyst to form water. Oxygen deprivation is almost complete after 1 h of incubation. Approximately 4–10% carbon dioxide is generated during this oxygen removal. Thus, cells are cultivated in the same bicarbonate-buffered medium. Restriction and DNA modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs or from Eurogentec, Liège, Belgium. [α-32P]dCTP, [α-33P]dATP were from ICN. Synthetic oligonucleotides were from Eurogentec, Liège, Belgium. First strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of CCL39 poly(A)+ RNA using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase with oligo(dT) primer. This material was used as template for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. The following oligonucleotides derived, respectively, from human VEGF, mouse VEGF-B (24Olofsson B. Pajulosa K. Kaipainen A. Von Euler G. Joukov V. Saksela O. Orpana A. Pettersson R.F. Alitalo K. Eriksson U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2576-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), human VEGF-C (25Joukov V. Pajulosa K. Kaipainen A. Chilov D. Lahtinen I. Kukk E. Saksela O. Kalkinen N. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar) sequences, were synthesized and used as primers for the PCR reaction: 5′-ATGAACTTTCTGCTGTCTTGGG-3′ and 5′-CCGCCTCGGCTTGTCACATCTGC-3′; 5′-ATGAGCCCCCTGCTCCGTCGCCTG-3′ and 5′-CTTTCGCGGCTTCCGGCACC-3′; and 5′-ATGACTGTACTCTACCCAGAATATTG-3′ and 5′-GCTCATTTGTGGTCTTTTC-3′. An aliquot of cDNA was amplified in a 50-μl reaction volume with 200 ng of each primer, 200 μm dNTPs, and 2.5 units of GoldstarTaq DNA polymerase (Eurogentec) or ampli-Taq from Boehringer Mannheim in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.001% gelatin. The PCR amplification was performed in a DNA thermal cycler (Biotechnia) using the following parameters: 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for 30 cycles followed by an extra cycle with a 10-min extension step at 72 °C. Expected fragments of approximately 600 and 550 bp for VEGF, 600 bp for VEGF-B, and 1200 bp for VEGF-C were obtained. These fragments were purified on agarose gels and used as probes for Northern analysis. The fragments were also cloned in the pTAG vector using the manufacturer protocol (R & D Systems Europe Ltd.). The different inserts were sequenced using a Universal or T7 primer or specific oligonucleotides for each sequence. No specific problems related to low abundance of mRNA were encountered during the cloning of VEGF-B and VEGF-C from Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts even though lung is a tissue where they represent poorly abundant mRNA species (24Olofsson B. Pajulosa K. Kaipainen A. Von Euler G. Joukov V. Saksela O. Orpana A. Pettersson R.F. Alitalo K. Eriksson U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S.

The high percentage of homology (98%) with Chinese hamster, mouse, or human homologs has allowed us to use both mouse and hamster VEGF probes for Northern experiments. CCL39 cells in 12-well dishes (105 cells/well) were transiently transfected by CaPO4 precipitation with the indicated plasmids (250 ng/well of the reporter plasmid, 200 ng of expression vector, and 100 ng of CMV β-galactosidase as a control of transfection efficiency). Sixteen hours after addition of DNA, the cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with or without 7.5% fetal calf serum. Two days later, the cells were washed with cold PBS, and luciferase assays were performed as follows (Promega protocols and applications guide). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mm DTT, 2 mm 1, 2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100) for 15 min at room temperature, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation. The assay of luciferase activity was performed in a chemioluminometer in a buffer containing 20 mm Tricine, 1.07 mm(MgCO3)Mg(OH)2, 5H2O, 2.67 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 33.3 mm DTT, 270 mm coenzyme A, 470 mmluciferine, and 530 μm ATP. Protein concentration was measured using the bicinchonic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and lysed in the “RNA Insta-Pure” buffer from Eurogentec. The supernatant was cleared by centrifugation, ethanol precipitated, and resuspended in sterile water. Dr. Werner Risau kindly provided the human VEGF promoter gene construct (−1176/+54) (16Ikeda E. Achen M.G. Breier G. Risau W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19761-19766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar) cloned in the pGL2 basic vector from Promega. Construct −88/+54 was obtained by cutting the above vector bySmaI (one site in the vector and one site at position −88 of the promoter) and re-ligating. Construct −27/+54 was obtained by subcloning a DraI/NheI fragment within theSmaI/NheI sites of pGL2 basic. The −66/+54 and −52/+54 constructs were generated by PCR by using oligo 1, 5′-GCGGGTACC(T)CCCGGCGGGGCGG-3′; and oligo 2, 5′-GCGGGTACC(A)GCCATGCGCCCCC-3′, respectively. Bases shown in bold correspond to positions −66 and −52, respectively. At their 5′ ends, both oligos contain the KpnI restriction site. They were used in a PCR reaction with oligo 3, 5′-CTTTATGTTTTTGGCGTCTTCCA-3′, which corresponds to a sequence within the vector at the 3′ end of the promoter. The amplified fragments were digested with KpnI and NheI and inserted into the pGL2 basic vector (Promega). We mutated the AP-2 site, both Sp1 sites or all three binding sites by the PCR method (26Higushi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2107) Google Scholar, 27Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6861) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were chosen: oligo 4, 5′-TGTATCTTATGGTACTGTAACTG-3′; oligo 5, 5′-GGGGCGGGCC(TA)GGGCGGGG-3′; oligo 6, 5′-CCCCGCCC(TA)GGCCCGCCCC-3′; oligo 7, 5′-GCCCCCCGGG(AA)GGGCCGGGG(AA)GGGGTCCG-3′; oligo 8, 5′-CGGACCCC(TT)CCCCGGCCC(TT)CCCGGGGGGC-3′; oligo 9, 5′-GGG(AA)GGCC(TA)GG(AA)GGGGTC-3′; and oligo 10, 5′-GAACCCC(TT)CC(TA)GGCCC(TT)CCC-3′. Oligo 4 corresponds to a sequence within the vector at the 5′ end of the promoter. For oligos 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, bases shown in bold indicate those modified in relation to the wild type sequence (oligos 5 and 6 for AP-2 mutation; oligos 7 and 8 for mutation of both Sp1 sites; oligos 9 and 10 for mutation of the AP-2 site and both Sp1 sites; see also Fig. 6 a). After obtention of the –1176/+54 mutated constructs, we digested them with SmaI to obtain the corresponding −88/+54 constructs. For the triple mutant, we used the construct −1176/+54 that was mutated for both Sp1 binding sites and oligos 9 and 10 for mutation of the remaining AP-2 binding site before digestion with SmaI to obtain the −88/+54 construct. The presence of the mutations were verified by gel sequencing. Confluent Raf-1:ER cells cultures were serum-starved overnight followed by stimulation with or without estradiol (1 μm) for 3 h. Nuclei were isolated by the isotonic/Nonidet P-40 procedure: cells were resuspended in HNB (0.5m sucrose, 15 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 0.25 mm EDTA, pH 8, 0.125 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm spermidine, 1 mmDTT, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 mmNaF, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 200 mmparanitrophenylphosphate, 0.2 mm orthovanadate) and homogenized in HNB containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40. Nuclei were recovered by centrifugation at 3000 rpm and rinsed in HNB alone. Nuclear extracts were then prepared by the method described by Dignam et al.(28Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9168) Google Scholar). The probe was synthesized to span the region of the human VEGF promoter comprised between the −88 and −66 bp: 5′-TTTCCGGGGCGGGCCGGGGGCGGGGTAT-3′ (random sequences added to the wild type sequence are shown in italic letters). Protruding 5′ ends were filled in with (exo-) Klenow fragment (from Stratagene) and [α-32P]-dCTP and dATP. The DNA binding reaction was performed for 15 min at room temperature in a final volume of 15 μl. A first volume of 7.5 μl was prepared containing 5 μg of nuclear extracts, 0.75 mg/ml poly(dI:dC) (Sigma), dialysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.125 mm EGTA, 1 mmDTT), protease and phosphatase inhibitors) (see HNB). The residual 7.5 μl was comprised of 90 fmol of labeled probe (1–2.105cpm), with or without excess (60–600-fold) of unlabeled probe, and with or without excess (100-fold) of Sp1 or AP-2 consensus oligonucleotides (Promega): Sp1, 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′ and 3′-TAAGCTAGCCCCGCCCCGCTCG-5′; AP-2, 5′-GATCGAACTGACCGCCCGCGGCCCGT-3′ and 3′-CTAGCTTGACTGGCGGGCGCCGGGCA-5′. The competitors were added 15 min before addition of the probe. Supershift assays were performed with 2.5–3 μg of nuclear extracts. The Sp1 (PEP-2) and AP-2α (C-18) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. 0.2 μg of Sp1 antibody was incubated 30 min at 4 °C after addition of the probe, whereas 1 μg of AP-2α antibody was added 30 min before the addition of the probe. Electrophoresis was performed on a 4% polyacrylamide (30 acrylamide, 0.8 bisacrylamide) gel, in 0.5× TBE (44.5 mm Tris, 44.5 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA), for 4–5 h at 280–300 V/10–12 mA. Under normoxic conditions, exponentially growing CCL39 or its derivative PS 200 Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts express barely detectable levels of VEGF mRNA (right lanes of Fig. 1). Serum stimulation of growth-arrested CCL39 (data not shown) or PS 200 cells (left lanes of Fig. 1) triggers the induction of VEGF mRNA. However, this expression is strongly elevated in cells transformed either with Polyoma virus, Ha-Ras (Ras-Val12) (18Seuwen K. Lagarde A. Pouysségur J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) or a constitutive active form of MAP kinase kinase (MKK1-SS/DD) (19Brunet A. Pagès G. Pouysségur J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3379-3387PubMed Google Scholar). At least four isoforms that correspond to the spliced variants described (12Tischer E. Mitchell R. Hartman T. Silva M. Gospodarowicz D. Fiddes J.C. Abraham J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11947-11954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) detectably hybridize to a mouse VEGF probe. Fig. 1 shows that, in the Polyoma virus, Ha-Ras and MKK1-SS/DD transformed cells, the different VEGF mRNA isoforms are expressed at a level approximately 10-fold superior to that of control cells. This overexpression is particularly prominent for the clone 5c that overexpressed Ha-Ras (18Seuwen K. Lagarde A. Pouysségur J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For each of the cell lines tested, FCS was able to increase the amount of VEGF mRNA, although in transformed cells the basal level was extremely elevated. However, this is not the case for cells expressing MKK1-SS/DD and isolated from a tumor produced in nude mice (T.MKK1-SS/DD). Interestingly, these cells were shown to be fully independent of serum growth factors (19Brunet A. Pagès G. Pouysségur J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3379-3387PubMed Google Scholar). This could explain the inability of serum to further modify the elevated level of VEGF mRNA in these tumor cells. In the different cell lines tested, the other members of the VEGF family, VEGF-B and VEGF-C, are constitutively expressed showing that both genes are not tightly regulated via growth or oncogenic factors even if VEGF-C seems to be up-regulated in MKK1-SS/DD transformed cells. To further examine the contribution of the Ras/p42/p44 MAP kinase pathway in VEGF expression, we have chosen a cell line expressing an estradiol-inducible Raf-1 (Raf-1:ER cells) (20Samuels M.L. Weber J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 21Samuels M.L. McMahon M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 14: 7855-7866Crossref Google Scholar, 22Lenormand P. McMahon M. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15762-15768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this case, the p42/p44 MAP kinase activity is rapidly activated by estradiol, eliminating the contribution of SAP kinase cascade (p38MAPK/JNK) (29Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2425) Google Scholar, 30Galcheva-Gargova Z. Derijard B. Wu I.H. Davis R.J.

Biol. 1994; 4: 798-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) that are generally activated by serum or constitutively active Ras. Raf-1:ER-expressing cells (see “Experimental Procedures”) were serum-deprived for 16 h and then stimulated by the addition of estradiol for the times indicated. Fig. 2 a shows that VEGF transcripts are expressed at a detectable level after 2 h and are maximally expressed after 3 h of estradiol stimulation, the expression being sustained for up to 5 h. A longer exposure of the blot shows detectable transcripts after only 30 min of stimulation (data not shown), and the expression of the three other spliced variants are revealed in Fig. 1. This rapid induction is compatible with the kinetics of activation of p42/p44 MAP kinases in these cells (22Lenormand P. McMahon M. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15762-15768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The expression of VEGF-B and VEGF-C mRNA species are not modified by estradiol treatment, confirming that activation of the p42/p44 MAP kinase pathway does not play any role in controlling their expression in these cells. Induction of VEGF mRNA in response to estradiol was dose-dependent, with 70% of the maximal induction obtained after a stimulation with 10 nm estradiol (Fig. 2 b, lane 7), and maximal induction obtained with 100 nm estradiol (Fig. 2 b, lane 9). This dose-response activity reflects the magnitude of activation of p42/p44 MAP kinase in these cells (22Lenormand P. McMahon M. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15762-15768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). If the activity of MKK1, the kinase directly downstream of Raf, is blocked by the specific inhibitor PD 098059 (34Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 c, lane 7), the p42/p44 MAP kinase pathway-dependent induction of VEGF is inhibited by 50% after 4 h of stimulation by estradiol (compare lanes 3 and 7 of Fig. 2 c). This result supports the hypothesis that the p42/p44 MAP kinase cascade plays a key role in VEGF gene induction. The partial inhibition of MKK1 by PD 098059 (60–70% inhibition at this concentration) 2F. R. McKenzie, J. M. Brondello, and A. Brunet, unpublished results. explains the residual VEGF mRNA amount in Fig. 2 c. To test whether induction of VEGF mRNA by hypoxia is dependent or not on the action of growth factors, we submitted quiescent or exponentially growing CCL39 cells to hypoxia for four hours. Fig. 3 shows that oxygen deprivation on its own is able to induce VEGF mRNA induction in quiescent cells to a level that is comparable with the basal level present in exponentially growing cells. When serum is present, VEGF mRNA levels reached a level superior to that present in quiescent cells following hypoxia. There is no discrepancy between the level observed in this experiment and the results presented in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1, the blot was underexposed to compare the high levels of mRNA in transformed cells. We routinely observed a basal level of mRNA in exponentially growing cells. However, the amounts of mRNA obtained after serum stimulation of quiescent cells is at least five times more elevated. Again, to analyze more directly the contribution of p42/p44 MAP kinase, we used the Raf-1:ER cells stimulated by estradiol in the presence or absence of oxygen (see Fig. 2 b). At suboptimal concentrations of estradiol (0.1 and 1 nm), which do not maximally activate p42/p44 MAP kinase (22Lenormand P. McMahon M. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15762-15768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we observed the induction of VEGF by hypoxia. Estradiol and hypoxia exert additive effects on VEGF mRNA induction at a dose of estradiol (10 nm) that induces half of the p42/p44 MAP kinase activity (see lane 8 of Fig. 2 b). This situation is comparable with that observed in Fig. 3 where exponentially growing cells are submitted to hypoxia. When a maximal dose of estradiol is used (100 nm or 1 μm), a small additive effect with hypoxia persists, but it is less detectable than that observed with 10 nm estradiol. In th"

https://openalex.org/W1972299037,"The molecular chaperone hsp90 in the eukaryotic cytosol interacts with a variety of protein cofactors. Several of these cofactors have protein domains containing tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which mediate binding to hsp90. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, the 12-kDa C-terminal domain of human hsp90α (C90) was found to mediate the interaction of hsp90 with TPR-containing sequences from the hsp90 cofactors FKBP51/54 and FKBP52. In addition, the mitochondrial outer membrane protein hTOM34p was identified as a TPR-containing putative partner protein of hsp90. In experiments with purified proteins, the TPR-containing cofactor p60 (Hop) was shown to form stable complexes with hsp90. A deletion mutant of hsp90 lacking the C90 domain was unable to bind p60, whereas deletion of the ∼25-kDa N-terminal domain of hsp90 did not affect complex formation. Both p60 and FKBP52 bound specifically to the C90 domain fused to glutathione <i>S</i>-transferase and competed with each other for binding. In reticulocyte lysate, the C90 fusion protein recognized the TPR proteins p60, FKBP52, and Cyp40. Thus, our results identify the C90 domain as the specific binding site for a set of hsp90 cofactors having TPR domains."

https://openalex.org/W2133608451,"During melanocyte development, the cytokine Steel factor activates its receptor c-Kit, initiating a signal transduction cascade, which is vital for lineage determination via unknown downstream nuclear targets. c-Kit has recently been found to trigger mitogen-activated protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation of Microphthalmia (Mi), a lineage-restricted transcription factor, which, like Steel factor and c-Kit, is essential for melanocyte development. This cascade results in increased Mi-dependent transcriptional reporter activity. Here we examine the mechanism by which Mi is activated by this pathway. Phosphorylation does not significantly alter Mi's nuclear localization, DNA binding, or dimerization. However, the transcriptional coactivator p300/CBP selectively associates with mitogen-activated protein kinase-phosphorylated Mi, even under conditions in which non-MAPK phospho-Mi is more abundant. Moreover, p300/CBP coactivates Mi transcriptional activity in a manner dependent upon this phosphorylation. Mi thus joins CREB as a transcription factor whose signal-responsive phosphorylation regulates coactivator recruitment, in this case modulating lineage development in melanocytes.

This striking phenotypic overlap has led to the suggestion that Sl, c-Kit, and Mi function in a common growth/differentiation pathway (5Dubreuil P. Forrester L. Rottapel R. Reedijk M. Fujita J.

Newton V.E. Read A.P. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Mi has been shown to modulate c-Kit expression levels in mast cells (6Tsujimura T. Morii E. Nozaki M. Hashimoto K. Moriyama Y. Takebayashi K. Kondo T. Kanakura Y. Kitamura Y. Blood. 1996; 88: 1225-1233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have also biochemically linked Mi to the c-Kit signaling pathway (9Hemesath T.J. Price E.R. Takemoto C. Badalian T. Fisher D.E. Nature. 1998; 391: 298-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). In response to Sl stimulation, c-Kit signaling activates MAP kinase (MAPK/Erk), which directly phosphorylates Mi at serine 73 (Ser-73), based on two-dimensional tryptic analyses of in vitro and in vivo phosphorylated Mi protein (9Hemesath T.J. Price E.R. Takemoto C. Badalian T. Fisher D.E. Nature. 1998; 391: 298-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation is associated with increased expression of a reporter driven by the tyrosinase pigmentation gene promoter. Mi is a highly tissue-restricted dimeric transcription factor, which recognizes “E box”-containing promoter/enhancer elements (4Hodgkinson C.A. Moore K.J. Nakayama A. Steingrimsson E. Copeland N.G.

Among its transcriptional targets are the melanocyte-specific tyrosine-metabolizing enzyme genes involved in melanin biosynthesis. In addition to the phenotypic similarity of c-Kit, Sl, and Mi mutant mice, recent clinical use of recombinant Sl in humans has demonstrated both proliferative and pigmentation responses in melanocytes near the injection site (13Costa J. Demetri G. Harrist T. Dvorak A. Hayes D. Merica E. Menchaca D. Gringeri A. Schwartz L. Galli S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2681-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that c-Kit signaling proceeds through regulated activation of Microphthalmia, which in turn initiates the pigmentation program and activates unknown genes conferring survival during development. Phosphorylation can regulate transcription factor activity by a variety of mechanisms. These include altered nuclear localization as with STAT (14Darnell J.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3327) Google Scholar) and NFAT factors (15Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2193) Google Scholar), altered dimerization specificity as with MyoD (16Lenormand J. Benayoun B. Guillier M. Vandromme M. Leibovitch M. Leibovitch S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 584-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), altered DNA binding as with Max (17Berberich S.J. Cole M.D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 166-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), or altered protein stability as with c-Jun (18Musti A.M. Treier M. Bohmann D. Science. 1997; 275: 400-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). To determine the mechanism whereby phosphorylation of Mi alters its transactivation potential, several strategies were employed. Immunostaining and DNA binding assays showed no phospho-regulated difference in subcellular localization or altered DNA binding. Recently, Mi was found to employ the transcriptional coactivator p300/CBP (19Sato S. Roberts K. Gambino G. Cook A. Kouzarides T. Goding C.R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 3083-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Here we further show that p300/CBP selectively associates with and activates MAPK-phosphorylated Mi in both binding and functional assays in vivo. This mechanism explains the recently reported c-Kit dependent up-regulation of Mi function (9Hemesath T.J. Price E.R. Takemoto C. Badalian T. Fisher D.E. Nature. 1998; 391: 298-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), corroborated here in functional assays measuring Mi transactivation in vivo. More generally, these observations link extracellular cytokine stimulation to regulated transcriptional programs on chromatin in melanocytes. 501mel cells, plated on 18-mm glass coverslips, were treated with or without 1 nm Steel factor (Sl) (R & D Systems) for 15 min. The cells were fixed with 3% formaldehyde and incubated with both mouse anti-Mi (D5) and rabbit anti-Erk1/2 (NEB) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Jackson Immunological). Nuclei were stained with 10 ng/ml DAPI (Sigma). All incubations were followed by three washes with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Transfections into BHK cells were performed in 24-well plates using lipofectAMINE according to manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). For each well 0.7 μg of total DNA in 30 μl of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was mixed with an equal volume of 5% lipofectAMINE in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Two days later, cells were harvested and luciferase assays performed using dual luciferase reagents (Promega). Luciferase values were normalized for transfection efficiency using cotransfected sea pansy luciferase plasmid (Promega). 501mel cells were either untreated or treated with 1 nm Sl for 15 min and/or various concentrations of the MEK inhibitor, PD98059 (NEB). BHK cells were transfected with lipofectAMINE. Cells were hypotonically lysed by Dounce homogenization in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mg/ml leupeptin, 3.6 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm NaF. Extracts were brought to 170 mm NaCl and the protein concentration determined by BCA assay (Pierce). Each immunoprecipitation contained 1.3 mg of cell extract and 12 μg of antibody (20Bhattacharya S. Eckner R. Grossman S. Oldread E. Arany Z. D'Andrea A. Livingston D.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 344-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates either were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blotted with anti-Mi monoclonal antibody (D5) or were assayed for HAT activity (21Brownell J.E. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6364-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). When c-Kit-expressing melanoma cells are treated with Sl factor, MAPK is rapidly activated, leading to the S73 phosphorylation and a mobility shift in Mi that is blocked by inhibition of MAPK (Fig. 1 A). The consequences of this modification were examined with respect to Mi's subcellular localization and DNA binding activity. Immunofluorescence demonstrated that although Sl activation stimulates distinct MAPK translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus, Sl stimulation does not alter endogenous Mi's nuclear localization (Fig. 1 B). Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis showed no significant difference in Mi's DNA binding propensity in nuclear extracts from resting or Sl-stimulated cells (Fig. 1 C, lanes 3 and 4). Because a variety of ubiquitous factors are capable of binding the same DNA sequences as Mi, antibody-mediated supershift was employed to identify Mi-specific binding. The absence of a significant change in Mi's DNA binding activity suggests that endogenous protein dimerization is also minimally affected by c-Kit-induced phosphorylation. This signaling pathway stands in contrast to other pathway inducers such as the melanocortins, which may specifically alter Mi DNA binding levels (data not shown and (22Bertolotto C. Bille K. Ortonne J. Ballotti R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar)). Because Mi phosphorylation at S73 does not significantly affect nuclear localization or the assembly of DNA-binding dimers in vivo, it was possible that phosphorylation more directly influenced transactivation potential, perhaps through interactions with transcriptional cofactor(s). The adenovirus E1A protein was previously shown to produce hypopigmentation in melanocytes as a consequence of down-regulating genes encoding pigment synthetic enzymes, such as tyrosinase and TRP-1 (23Yavuzer U. Keenan E. Lowings P. Vachtenheim J. Currie G. Goding C.R. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 123-134PubMed Google Scholar, 24Halaban R. Bohm M. Dotto P. Moellmann G. Cheng E. Zhang Y. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 1266-1272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In cotransfection studies, E1A profoundly repressed Mi-dependent transactivation of the tyrosinase promoter (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3and 4). The Mi-dependent increase in luciferase activity was blocked to basal levels by cotransfection with E1A (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1-4). E1A is known to bind and inactivate both p300 and the retinoblastoma protein, Rb (25Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). E1A's ability to inhibit Mi-dependent transactivation correlated with the ability of mutant E1A to bind and sequester p300 (Fig. 2A, lanes 4-7). This dependence is further supported by the observation that E1A repression can be rescued by overexpression of p300 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 B, lanes 6-8). As with many p300/CBP coactivator systems, transfected CBP has been shown to superactivate Mi-dependent transcription as well (Ref. 19Sato S. Roberts K. Gambino G. Cook A. Kouzarides T. Goding C.R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 3083-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar and see below). Direct evidence for physical interaction of Mi with p300 was assessed by immunoprecipitation/Western analysis of the endogenous proteins in melanoma cells (Fig. 3, A andB). Anti-p300 monoclonal, but not isotype-matched control antibody, immunoprecipitated endogenous Mi in human melanoma (501mel) cell extracts (20Bhattacharya S. Eckner R. Grossman S. Oldread E. Arany Z. D'Andrea A. Livingston D.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 344-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). For cells stimulated by Steel factor, Mi migrates as a single species and approximately 10% of the input Mi protein is associated with p300 (Fig. 3 A). Mi extracted from cells grown in the absence of exogenous Steel factor migrates as a doublet (Fig. 3 B, see also Fig. 1 A). Importantly, however, only the upper species (MAPK-phosphorylated) is coimmunoprecipitated with p300 despite a relative preponderance of the other species in the input lysate (Fig. 3 B). Because the difference between these two Mi forms has been shown by two-dimensional tryptic mapping to be S73 phosphorylation by MAPK (9Hemesath T.J. Price E.R. Takemoto C. Badalian T. Fisher D.E. Nature. 1998; 391: 298-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), these data demonstrate that endogenous Mi and p300 are present within a complex and that S73 phosphorylation selectively enhances the Mi-p300 interaction. To test the functional consequences of this phosphorylation-dependent interaction, p300-mediated superactivation was examined in cells cotransfected with chimeras containing the Gal4 DNA binding domain linked to an N-terminal fragment of Mi which includes S73 as well as the adjacent transactivation domain, but which excludes a C-terminal transactivation domain. p300 significantly superactivated wild type Mi chimeras, but not a serine 73 to alanine (SA) mutant (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 7 and8). The S73A mutation does not discernibly affect expression or stability in these studies (data not shown). Thus p300's biochemical preference for MAPK-phosphorylated Mi at S73 correlates with p300's ability to enhance Mi-dependent transactivation. The protein p300 was initially identified by its ability to bind E1A in E1A-transformed cells and, when cloned, was found to be related to the CREB-binding protein, CBP (26Arany Z. Sellers W.R. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Cell. 1994; 77: 799-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 27Eckner R. Arany Z. Ewen M. Sellers W. Livingston D.M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Both p300 and CBP are transcriptional coactivators, which may contact RNA polymerase holoenzyme (28Nakajima T. Uchida C. Anderson S.F. Parvin J.D. Montminy M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) as well as catalyze histone acetylation by either their own intrinsic activity (29Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar, 30Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2355) Google Scholar) or by recruitment of other histone acetyltransferases (31Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). Because Mi can interact with p300/CBP (Figs. 2and 3 and Ref. 19Sato S. Roberts K. Gambino G. Cook A. Kouzarides T. Goding C.R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 3083-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) in a phospho-specific fashion (Figs. 2 and 3), Mi immunoprecipitates were also tested for the presence of HAT enzymatic activity. Extracts from either melanoma cells or Mi-transfected BHK cells were immunoprecipitated with either anti-p300, anti-Mi, or control antibodies, and the resulting immunoprecipitates were assayed for HAT activity in vitro (Fig. 4 A). Compared with total anti-p300 immunoprecipitable HAT activity, immunoprecipitates of endogenous Mi contained significant HAT activity (∼16% of total) (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1 and 2). Reproducible Mi-associated HAT activity was also observed in Mi-transfected BHK cells, albeit with more modest induction over background. This is presumably related to cell type differences and transfection efficiency (Fig. 4 A, lanes 3-6). Consistent with p300's widespread role as a transcriptional coactivator, the Mi-associated HAT activity represented only a fraction of the total activity measured in direct p300 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4 A). These studies demonstrate that Sl/c-Kit activation triggers a signaling cascade, which leads to a modification of the Mi transcription factor thereby selectively enhancing recruitment of the coactivator p300. Engagement of p300 may induce transcriptional activity by several mechanisms, including cooperativity with promoter-bound factors (scaffolding-like effect), enhanced interactions with RNA polymerase holoenzyme, and chromatin remodeling via alterations in histone acetylation. Future studies, which examine chromatin-based functional assays, may demonstrate larger differences than those seen here, because it is uncertain to what degree plasmid reporters recapitulate p300's in vivo functions. HAT assays of Mi immunoprecipitates have also shown reproducibly enhanced activity in response to c-Kit stimulation (30–100% increase (data not shown)). The magnitude of this difference appears to reflect the presence of significant phospho-Mi in nonstimulated cells (Fig. 1 A and Ref. 9Hemesath T.J. Price E.R. Takemoto C. Badalian T. Fisher D.E. Nature. 1998; 391: 298-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism(s) employed by p300/CBP to transmit Mi's activation signal remain to be fully elucidated, these observations link critical environmental signals to specific transcriptional programs central to lineage survival in development and may be studied using in vitro melanocyte differentiation systems (32Sviderskaya E.V. Wakeling W.F. Bennett D.C. Development ( Camb. ). 1995; 121: 1547-1557PubMed Google Scholar). The exact means by which Mi phosphorylation biochemically stabilizes p300 binding is not yet understood. Separate studies have suggested that p300/CBP can interact separately with a short transactivation motif approximately 40 residues downstream of S73 (data not shown and Ref. 19Sato S. Roberts K. Gambino G. Cook A. Kouzarides T. Goding C.R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 3083-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In the intact protein, phosphorylation could alter the affinity or accessibility (or both) of the activation domain for p300/CBP. Because this activation domain encodes a putative acidic amphipathic α helix (33Beckmann H. Su L.K. Kadesch T. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), repulsion between S73-phosphate and the acidic activation domain could trigger a folding transition, thereby enhancing accessibility of the activation domain to p300/CBP. The striking phenotypic similarity of mice carrying mutations in c-Kit, Sl, and Mi is consistent with evidence that these factors lie within a common signal transduction cascade critical for lineage survival. Genetic studies in mice have repeatedly shown that cell type-specific phenotypes can indeed link loci that encode proteins that interact at the biochemical level. For example, mutations in the tyrosine receptor kinase c-Kit can compensate for mutant alleles at the motheaten locus, which encodes a tyrosine phosphatase (34Lorenz U. Bergemann A.D. Steinberg H.N. Flanagan J.G. Li X. Galli S.J. Neel B.G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1111-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 35Paulson R.F. Vesely S. Siminovitch K.A. Bernstein A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Humans harboring heterozygous germ line mutations of the CBP gene are afflicted with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome manifested by facial abnormalities, broad thumbs, and mental retardation (36Petrij F. Giles R.H. Dauwerse H.G. Saris J.J. Hennekam R.C. Masuno M. Tommerup N. van Ommen G.J. Goodman R.H. Peters D.J. et al.Nature. 1995; 376: 348-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). There are reports of affected individuals with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome displaying piebaldism (37Herranz P. Borbujo J. Martinez W. Vidaurrazaga C. Diaz R. Casado M. Clin. Exp. Dermatol. 1994; 19: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and ocular defects (38Fryns J.P. J. Med. Genet. 1995; 32: 668Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), which are potentially consistent with p300/CBP's role in modulation of Sl/c-Kit and Mi activity in pigment cells of the skin and eye, as schematized in Fig. 4 B. Importantly, the penetrance or variability of such phenotypes could be heavily influenced by the remaining p300 and CBP alleles, as well as factors regulating neural crest migration. Multiple cell lineages clearly utilize p300/CBP to transmit tissue-specific differentiation signals, such as myogenesis via MyoD (39Eckner R. Yao T.P. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 40Yuan W. Condorelli G. Caruso M. Felsani A. Giordano A. J. Biol.

A number of Rac targets have been identified to date, based on their ability to interact preferentially with the GTP-bound form of Rac. These include the p65 Ser/Thr protein kinase PAK, 1The abbreviations used are: PAK, p21-activated kinase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; NBT, nitro blue tetrazolium; DCFDA, 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate; JNK, Jun kinase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; GFP, green fluorescence protein; SOD, superoxide dismutase; DPI, diphenylene iodonium; NAC, N-acetyl cysteine. 1The abbreviations used are: PAK, p21-activated kinase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; NBT, nitro blue tetrazolium; DCFDA, 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate; JNK, Jun kinase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; GFP, green fluorescence protein; SOD, superoxide dismutase; DPI, diphenylene iodonium; NAC, N-acetyl cysteine. the Ser/Thr kinase p160ROCK, a cytoplasmic component of the NADPH oxidase complex p67PHOX, and the Rac-binding protein POR1 (reviewed in Ref. 11Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Using chimeras made between Rac and the related GTPases Rho and Cdc42 as well as site-specific mutations, it has been shown that Rac interacts with its target proteins through multiple effector sites. Rac has an N-terminal effector-binding domain encompassing amino acids 26–40 that is essential for the induction of actin polymerization as well as the interaction with the target enzymes PAK and the NADPH oxidase (12Diekmann D.

In the present study we investigated the role of the insert region in Rac-dependent signaling in fibroblasts. Using a Rac mutant lacking the insert region, we demonstrate that this region is critical for the ability of Rac to promote cell cycle progression. Furthermore, we show that the insert region contributes to Rac-induced mitogenesis specifically by controlling the generation of superoxide. Our findings suggest that Rac-mediated superoxide generation might play an important role in the control of cell growth. For microinjection experiments, COS1 or REF-52 cells were plated onto gridded glass coverslips and cultured in DMEM supplemented with FBS (10%). The cells were grown to confluence and then placed in DMEM with 0.5% FBS for 24 h before microinjection. A plasmid mixture containing indicated plasmids in microinjection buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 100 mm KCl, and 5 mm NaPO4) was microinjected into cell nuclei. For monitoring membrane ruffles and protein expression, cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The coverslips were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with mouse antibody to T7 epitope (Novagen) in PBS containing albumin (2 mg/ml) and then with a mixture of fluorescein-conjugated goat antibody to mouse immunoglobulin G and rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (0.01 mg/ml) (Molecular Probes). The cells were photographed with a Zeiss Axiphot fluorescence microscope. For monitoring DNA synthesis, REF-52 cells were plated on gridded coverslips and serum-starved for 24 h. Cells were injected with 2.5 μg/ml of each of the indicated constructs, and BrdUrd (10 μm) was added to the cell culture medium at a 2 h after injection. After 30 h, cells were fixed in acid alcohol (ethanol:water:acetic acid 90:5:5) for 1 h at −20 °C and immunostained with mouse monoclonal antibody to BrdUrd (Sigma) as described (16Joneson T. White M. Wigler M. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1996; 271: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). At least 100 injected cells were scored in each assay for quantitation. Chemical inhibitors affecting superoxide or other reactive oxidants (300 units/ml superoxide dismutase (Sigma), 20 mm N-acetyl-l-cysteine (Sigma), and 5 μm diphenylene iodonium chloride (Toronto Research)) were added immediately after injection. COS1 cells were plated onto glass coverslips, grown to confluence, and then either microinjected or transfected with the indicated expression vectors. For microinjection, cells were injected with 50 μg/ml of expression plasmids. After 10 h, the cells were incubated with either 300 units/ml SOD or vehicle (DMEM). The medium was then replaced with DMEM containing 0.5% nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma) with or without SOD. The cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C before being fixed and stained with anti-T7 monoclonal antibodies. For quantitation, COS1 cells on coverslips were placed in 10-cm tissue culture dishes and transfected with 10 μg of the indicated expression vector using the CaPO4 method. pCMV-GFP was used as a negative control. After 12 h of incubation with the DNA-CaPO4precipitate, cells were washed three times with PBS and allowed to recover in DMEM containing 5% fetal calf serum for 12 h. The serum containing medium was then replaced with DMEM for an additional 12 h. The coverslips were incubated in 0.5% NBT in DMEM for 1 h. Cells were stained using either anti-Raf (Transduction Laboratories) or T7 monoclonal antibodies, and those that expressed the exogenous protein were then scored for the presence of the reduced form of NBT, blue formazan. Measurement of intracellular reactive oxygen species generation by the DCFDA loading method was carried out as described (17Sundaresan M. Yu Z.-Y. Ferrans V.J. Sulciner D.J. Gutkind J.S. Iranis K. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Finkel T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). For monitoring JNK activation, cells were cotransfected with 10 μg of FLAG-tagged JNK1 and 10 μg of expression vectors containing no insert, RacV12, or RacV12,ΔIns using the CaPO4 method. After a 12-h incubation with the DNA-CaPO4 precipitates, cells were incubated in medium containing FBS (5%) for 6 h and then incubated for 12 h in serum-free medium. JNK1 immunocomplex kinase assay was carried out as described (8Joneson T. McDonough M. Bar-Sagi D. VanAelst L. Science. 1996; 274: 1374-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. Fold activation was determined using the Storm 860 PhosphorImager in combination with Image Quant v1.1 software (Molecular Dynamics). Plasmid pCGT, which is derived from pCGN with a replacement of the HA epitope by the T7 epitope, was used as as a mammalian expression vector to express the various Rac mutants. pCGT RacV12,H40 and pCGT RacV12,L37 were created as described (8Joneson T. McDonough M. Bar-Sagi D. VanAelst L. Science. 1996; 274: 1374-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and ligated into the XbaI-BamHI sites of pCGT. pCGT RacV12,ΔIns was created as described (3Freeman J. Abo A. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19794-19801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) except that the Cys189 to Ser mutation originally made to increase protein stability was not incorporated. The CMV-GFP vector was constructed by fusing the cytomegalovirus promoter to the GFP reporter. To investigate the significance of the insert region for the biological effects of Rac, we examined the signaling activities of a mutant form of activated Rac (RacV12) containing a complete deletion of the insert region between residues 124–135 (RacV12,ΔIns). Earlier microinjection studies have established that Rac-mediated changes in the actin cytoskeleton lead to the formation of membrane ruffles (4Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3041) Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of the insert region in Rac-induced actin polymerization was examined by microinjection of serum-starved COS1 cells with expression plasmids encoding T7 epitope-tagged versions of Rac mutants. We found that RacV12,ΔIns was as effective as RacV12 in inducing actin polymerization and membrane ruffling, as judged by filamentous actin staining with rhodamine phalloidin (Fig. 1 a). Immunofluorescence staining of the injected cells confirmed that both Rac mutants were expressed to the same extent and displayed an overall similar subcellular distribution pattern (not shown). These results indicate that the insert region is not necessary for effector interactions that control actin cytoskeleton rearrangements. It has been shown that Rac can stimulate kinase cascades leading to the activation of the JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (5Coso O. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar, 6Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). This activation is presumably mediated by the activation of the Rac target PAK (18Bagrodia S. Derijard B. Davis R. Cerione R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27995-27998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 19Brown J. Stowers L. Baer M. Trejo J. Coughlin S. Chant J. Curr.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23934-23936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). To test the Rac insert region mutant for its ability to activate the JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, COS1 cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids encoding the Rac mutants and a plasmid encoding FLAG-tagged version of JNK1. JNK activity was assayed by immunocomplex kinase assay using glutathioneS-transferase-c-Jun as a substrate. RacV12,ΔIns and RacV12 stimulated JNK activity to a similar extent, indicating that the insert region is not required for Rac-induced JNK activation (Fig. 1 b). These results are consistent with the observation that Rac-induced PAK activation is not affected by insert region mutations (3Freeman J. Abo A. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19794-19801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We conclude that Rac insert region is dispensable for two major biological activities of Rac described thus far in fibroblasts, induction of membrane ruffling and JNK activation. Rac proteins have been shown to play a critical role in mitogenesis and oncogenesis. In Swiss 3T3 cells, RacV12 stimulates the transition from G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle (2Olson M. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 268: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). In addition, RacV12 promotes focus formation in NIH3T3 cells when coexpressed with a constitutively active form of Raf1 kinase (1Qui R.-G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). To determine whether the insert region of Rac is required for its mitogenic activity, quiescent REF-52 cells were microinjected with expression plasmids encoding the Rac mutants, and cell cycle progression was measured by BrdUrd incorporation. In REF-52 cells, microinjection of RacV12 alone was not sufficient for the induction of DNA synthesis. However, coinjection of RacV12 with the membrane-targeted form of Raf1, Raf-CAAX, resulted in a synergistic stimulation of DNA synthesis. In contrast, RacV12,ΔIns failed to stimulate DNA synthesis when coinjected with Raf-CAAX (Fig. 1 c). These results suggest a role for the Rac insert region in mediating effector interactions that are essential for Rac-induced cell proliferation. This conclusion is further supported by our findings that a Rac mutant containing a single amino acid substitution in the insert region (K130N) was also defective in stimulating DNA synthesis, despite retaining its ability to activate JNK cascade and induce membrane ruffling (data not shown). Because the Rac insert region has been implicated in the activation of NADPH oxidase in phagocytic cells (3Freeman J. Abo A. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19794-19801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 15Gili J. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29079-29082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we investigated the relationship between Rac-mediated superoxide production and mitogenesis in nonphagocytic cells. COS1 cells were transfected with Rac mutants expression plasmids, and superoxide production was examined using the NBT reduction assay (21Maly F.-E. Nakamura M. Gauchat J.-F. Urwyler A. Walker C. Dahinden C. Cross A. Jones O. DeWeck A. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1260-1267PubMed Google Scholar). This assay involves the incubation of cells with NBT, which when reduced forms an insoluble purple precipitate, and has been used to demonstrate a superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase system in fibroblasts (22Meier T. Cross A. Hancock J. Kaup F. Jones O. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Cells expressing RacV12 were positive for NBT staining, as detected by bright field microscopy (Fig. 2 a). The RacV12-dependent NBT reduction was inhibited by the incubation of transfected cell with SOD, indicating that NBT staining is because of Rac-induced superoxide production (Fig. 2 a). This finding is consistent with earlier reports implicating Rac in the regulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species production in nonphagocytic cells (17Sundaresan M. Yu Z.-Y. Ferrans V.J. Sulciner D.J. Gutkind J.S. Iranis K. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Finkel T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 23Sulciner D. Irani K. Yu Z. Ferrans V. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Finkel T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 7115-7121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that the NBT reduction assay was not sufficiently sensitive to detect Rac-mediated superoxide production in REF-52 cells. Another method for the detection of increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species involves the loading of cells with the fluorophore DCFDA, which fluoresces upon interaction with H2O2 (17Sundaresan M. Yu Z.-Y. Ferrans V.J. Sulciner D.J. Gutkind J.S. Iranis K. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Finkel T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Using this method, we were able to detect an increase in DCFDA fluorescence in cells injected with RacV12. In contrast, no increase in DCFDA fluorescence was detected in cells injected with RacV12ΔIns (not shown). Thus the results obtained in REF-52 cells and COS1 cells with respect to the relative abilities of Rac mutants to stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species are qualitatively similar. However, because the DCFDA loading method does not permit a quantitative analysis in which protein expression and production of reactive oxygen species can be correlated on a per cell basis, we have used the NBT reduction assay in the subsequent experiments. As illustrated in Fig. 2 b, virtually all cells expressing RacV12 were positive for NBT staining. The frequency of NBT-stained cells was reduced to nearly background levels in cells expressing RacV12,ΔIns (Fig. 2 b), indicating that this mutant failed to induce superoxide production. Likewise, Raf-CAAX was also deficient in superoxide production. These observations together with the finding that RacV12,ΔIns lacks mitogenic activity suggest a role for superoxide production in mediating the effects of Rac on cell proliferation. To further test this idea, we examined the effects of various agents that interfere with superoxide generation or accumulation on RacV12-induced mitogenesis. Treatment of RacV12 expressing cells with the specific flavoprotein inhibitor diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and SOD had no appreciable effect on Rac-induced membrane ruffling or JNK activation (Fig. 3, a andb). The anti-oxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) had no effect on Rac-induced membrane ruffling but moderately inhibited Rac-induced JNK activation. In addition, these inhibitors had no effect on the levels of expression of Rac or JNK as determined by Western blot analysis (not shown). In contrast, NAC, DPI, and SOD blocked the stimulation of DNA synthesis induced by coinjection of RacV12 and Raf-CAAX (Fig. 3 c). All inhibitors were used at the minimal concentration, which results in the complete inhibition of Rac-induced superoxide production, as determined by DCFDA fluorescence. Furthermore, at these concentrations, DPI and SOD had no effect on serum-induced DNA synthesis (Fig. 3 c). In contrast, NAC induced a 70% inhibition of DNA synthesis, indicating that this agent exerts a more general inhibitory effect on cell growth. We conclude that Rac-mediated superoxide production is specifically required for its growth promoting effects. Significantly, DPI exerted an inhibitory effect on DNA synthesis if added at intervals up to 10 h after injection. Beyond this interval DPI addition had no effect on the ability of RacV12 and Raf-CAAX to stimulate DNA synthesis. In REF-52 cells, the G1 phase of the cell cycle is approximately 18 h long (not shown). Thus it appears that production of reactive oxygen species is required up to mid G1 phase. Using effector-binding loop mutants of Rac, it has been recently demonstrated that the activation of PAK and JNK are not required for Rac-induced mitogenesis (8Joneson T. McDonough M. Bar-Sagi D. VanAelst L. Science. 1996; 274: 1374-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 9Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P. Aspenstrom P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A.

Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a correlation was observed between Rac-induced actin polymerization and cell cycle progression (8Joneson T. McDonough M. Bar-Sagi D. VanAelst L. Science. 1996; 274: 1374-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 9Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P. Aspenstrom P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Our finding that RacV12,ΔIns retained the ability to induce membrane ruffling but was no longer able to stimulate DNA synthesis indicates that Rac-induced actin polymerization is not sufficient for its growth promoting activity. This result is consistent with a recent report suggesting that membrane ruffling is not sufficient for the full transforming activity of Rac (10Westwick J. Lambert Q. Clark G. Semons M. Aelst L.V. Pestell R. Der C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Utilizing the NBT reduction assay, the capacity of the Rac effector-binding loop mutants RacV12,L37 and RacV12,H40 to stimulate superoxide production was tested. The RacV12,L37 mutant activates JNK but is defective in inducing actin polymerization, whereas the RacV12,C40 induces actin polymerization but is defective in JNK activation (Fig. 4 b and Ref. 8Joneson T. McDonough M. Bar-Sagi D. VanAelst L. Science. 1996; 274: 1374-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Both mutants were as effective as RacV12 in inducing superoxide production (Fig. 4 a). However, as shown previously, only the RacV12,H40 is functional in promoting cell proliferation and transformation (8Joneson T. McDonough M. Bar-Sagi D. VanAelst L. Science. 1996; 274: 1374-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Therefore, although necessary, superoxide production is not sufficient for the mitogenic activity of Rac. Together, these observations suggest that both Rac-induced actin polymerization and superoxide production are required for Rac-controlled cell proliferation (Fig. 4 b). It remains to be determined whether additional Rac-mediated signals contribute to its mitogenic activity.

Using the yeast two-hybrid protein-protein interaction assay, we show that FRS2/SNT-1 and a newly isolated SNT-2 protein directly bind to FGF receptor-1 (FGFR-1). A juxtamembrane segment of FGFR-1 and the phosphotyrosine-binding domain of SNTs are both necessary and sufficient for interaction in yeast andin vitro, and FGFR-mediated SNT tyrosine phosphorylationin vivo requires these segments of receptor and SNT. Our findings establish SNTs as direct protein links between FGFR-1 and multiple downstream pathways.

When βARs or other G protein-coupled receptors are activated by agonist, heterotrimeric G proteins dissociate into Gα and Gβγ subunits, and the Gβγ subunit complex, which is membrane anchored by a lipid group (geranylgeranyl), can target βARK1 to the membrane through a direct physical interaction that facilitates phosphorylation of activated receptors (5Pitcher J.A.

Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. Smith B. Bond R.A. Sulik K. Ross Jr., J. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Giros B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12974-12979Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In contrast to the complete knock out, βARK1(+/−) heterozygous animals have no obvious developmental abnormalities despite an approximate 50% reduction in the level of βARK1 protein and GRK activity (9Jaber M. Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. Smith B. Bond R.A. Sulik K. Ross Jr., J. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Giros B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12974-12979Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In a variety of human and experimental conditions, prominent βAR desensitization in response to catecholamine stimulation has recently been shown to be associated with heightened levels of βARK1 (10Ungerer M.

In chronic human heart failure, reduced agonist-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity due to both diminished receptor number and impaired receptor function is a predominant feature (14Brodde O.E. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 60: 405-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In end-stage human heart failure, these changes in βAR function were shown to be associated with elevated mRNA levels and activity for βARK1 (10Ungerer M. Parruti G. Bohm M. Puzicha M. DeBlasi A. Erdmann E. Lohse M.J. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar,15Ungerer M. Bohm M. Elce J.S. Erdmann E. Lohse M.J.

Milano C.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1995; 268: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar,8Rockman H.A. Choi D.J. Rahman N.U. Akhter S.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Furthermore, chronic treatment with either the βAR antagonist bisoprolol in the pig (16Ping P. Gelzer-Bell R. Roth D.A. Kiel D. Insel P.A. Hammond H.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1271-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) or carvedilol in the mouse 2G. Iaccarino, E. D. Tomhave, R. J. Lefkowitz, and W. J. Koch, submitted. 2G. Iaccarino, E. D.

Shusterman N.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 1349-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (4196) Google Scholar), substantially decreased the level of βARK1 activity. The most compelling evidence demonstrating the importance of βARK1 in heart failure comes from a recent study whereby transgenic mice with cardiac-restricted overexpression of the βARKct were mated into a genetic model of murine heart failure achieved through ablation of the MLP gene (19Rockman H.A. Chien K.R. Choi D.J. Iaccarino G. Hunter J.J. Ross Jr., J. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7000-7005Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the βARK1 inhibitor reversed the heightened βAR desensitization in the MLP knockout mice and completely normalized cardiac function. These data strongly implicate abnormal βAR-G protein coupling in the pathogenesis of the failing heart (19Rockman H.A. Chien K.R. Choi D.J. Iaccarino G. Hunter J.J. Ross Jr., J. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7000-7005Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies indicate the potential for a therapeutic strategy that aims to modulate the activity level of myocardial βARK1 in disease states. Decreasing the level of myocardial βARK1 in established heart failure is a novel approach to improving impaired βAR receptor function and potentially alter the pathogenesis in this disease. In the present study, we sought to test the hypothesis that the level of cardiac βARK1 activity regulates myocardial contractile functionin vivo. To test these hypotheses, we used a strategy that utilized mouse genetics to create varying levels of βARK1 activity in the heart, coupled with a physiological assessment of contractile function in the absence and presence of catecholamine stimulation. The gene-targeted mice used for this study were 1) heterozygous for targeted disruption of the βARK1 gene (9Jaber M. Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. Smith B. Bond R.A. Sulik K. Ross Jr., J. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Giros B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12974-12979Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), and 2) offspring generated by cross breeding transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of a βARK1 inhibitor (βARKct, shown previously to have enhanced basal contractility) (7Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. Samama P. Hamilton R.A. Bond R.A. Milano C.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1995; 268: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) with the βARK1(+/−) to yield the double gene-targeted line βARK1(+/−)/βARKct. Offspring were genotyped by Southern blot analysis on DNA extracted from tail biopsies. Mice of either sex, 4–6 months of age were used and compared with wild-type litter mates. The animals in this study were handled according to approved protocols and the animal welfare regulations of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Duke University. Mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (2.5 mg/kg) and analyzed as described previously (8Rockman H.A. Choi D.J. Rahman N.U. Akhter S.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9954-9959Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Briefly, after endotracheal intubation, mice were connected to a rodent ventilator. Following bilateral vagotomy, the chest was opened and a 1.8-French high fidelity micromanometer catheter (Millar Instruments) was inserted into the left atrium, advanced through the mitral valve, and secured in the LV. Hemodynamic measurements were recorded at baseline and 45–60 seconds after injection of incremental doses of isoproterenol. Doses of isoproterenol were specifically chosen to maximize the contractile response but limit the increase in heart rate. Experiments were then terminated, hearts were rapidly excised, with individual chambers separated, weighed, and frozen in liquid N2 for later biochemical analysis. Ten sequential beats were averaged for each measurement. Adult myocytes were isolated as described previously (20Wolska B.M. Solaro R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H1250-H1255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21He H. Giordano F.J. Hilal-Dandan R. Choi D.J. Rockman H.A. McDonough P.M. Sayen M.R. Swanson E. Dillmann W.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Following anesthesia, the heart was excised and the aorta was cannulated with a 20-gauge needle then mounted on the perfusion apparatus. The perfusion solution was composed of Joklik's minimum essential medium containing (in mm) 113 NaCl, 4.7 KCL, 0.6 KH2PO2, 0.6 Na2PO4, 1.2 MgSO4, 0.5 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 20 d-glucose, 30 taurine, 2.0 carnitine, 2.0 creatine, and 20 μm Ca2+ at pH 7.4. The aorta was perfused for 2–3 min, then 150 units/ml of type-II collagenase (Worthington) was added and perfused for 15 min. The temperature of perfusate was maintained at 34 °C and all solutions were continuously bubbled with 95% 02, 5% CO2. LV tissue was separated from the great vessels, atria and right ventricle, minced, and allowed to digest in perfusate for 15 min. The digested heart was filtered through 200 μm nylon mesh, placed in a conical tube, and spun at 100 rpm to allow viable myocytes to settle. Serial washes were used to remove nonviable myocytes and digestive enzymes until the concentration of Ca2+ was gradually increased to 1.8 mm in Joklik's minimal essential medium. The operator was blinded to the genotype of the animals. Myocytes were placed in a 0.5-ml chamber with 1.8 mm Ca2+ Tyrode's solution at room temperature. Myocytes were visualized with a Nikon inverted microscope with a solid state CCD camera attached and displayed on a video monitor. Two platinum electrodes placed in the bathing fluid were connected to a stimulator to field stimulate the myocytes with a pulse duration of 5 ms and a frequency of 0.5 Hz. Myocyte cell edges were enhanced and processed with a video edge motion detection system (Crescent Electronics) at a sampling rate of 240 Hz. Recordings were performed under basal conditions and then 1–2 min after isoproterenol (10−7m) administration. Calibrated myocyte lengths were converted from analog to digital on-line (MacLab) and stored on computer. All myocytes were studied within 1–2 h after myocyte isolation. Data from 5–8 consecutive contractions were averaged. Contractile parameters measured were: percent cell shortening (%CS) (calculated as percent change in myocyte length from rest (L max) to minimum length (L min)), rate of shortening (−dL/dt) and rate of relengthening (+dL/dt). 7–15 myocytes from each heart were studied. Myocardial extracts were prepared by homogenization of excised hearts in ice-cold lysis buffer (2 ml) (25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants that contain soluble kinases were concentrated using a Centricon-10 (Amicon) microconcentrator. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method. Concentrated cytosolic extracts (200 μg of protein) were incubated with rhodopsin-enriched rod outer segment membranes in reaction buffer (75 μl) containing 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris-Cl, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm ATP (containing [γ-32P]ATP) as described (9Jaber M. Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. Smith B. Bond R.A. Sulik K. Ross Jr., J. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Giros B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12974-12979Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out in the absence and presence of purified Gβγ (≈20 pmol) to maximally activate βARK (9Jaber M. Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. Smith B. Bond R.A. Sulik K. Ross Jr., J. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Giros B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12974-12979Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). After incubating in white light for 15 min at room temperature, reactions were quenched with ice-cold lysis buffer (300 μl) and centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 × g. Sedimented proteins were resuspended in 20 μl of protein-gel loading dye and electrophoresed through 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Phosphorylated rhodopsin was visualized by autoradiography of dried polyacrylamide gels and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Results are expressed as mean value ± S.E. To examine the effect of isoproterenol on changes in hemodynamic parameters between wild-type controls and the two gene-targeted groups (βARK1(+/−) and βARK1(+/−)/βARKct), a 3 × 4 repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used. To test for statistical difference in isolated cell contractile parameters and adenylyl cyclase activity, a one factor ANOVA was used. Post hoc analysis with regard to differences in mean values between groups was conducted with either a Newman-Keuls or Duncan test. A Student's t test with Bonferroni correction for 3 comparisons was used to test for statistical difference in the chamber weight parameters.p < 0.05 was considered significant. To determine whether altered levels of βARK1 influence myocardial growth in the adult mouse, left ventricular weight normalized for body weight (LV/BW) and tibia length was compared in wild type (n = 26), βARK1(+/−) (n = 19), and βARK1(+/−)/βARKct (n = 9) gene-targeted mice. No significant difference was observed for any of the measured variables between the three groups (LV/BW; wild type 3.5 ± 0.1, βARK1(+/−) 3.7 ± 0.1, βARK1(+/−)/βARKct 3.6 ± 0.2, mg/g, p = not significant). In contrast to the embryonic lethal phenotype of the homozygous βARK1 knockout, the heterozygote mice developed normally and attained a similar body weight as wild-type adults. Similarly, we previously had not observed any differences in heart weight in the animals overexpressing the βARKct alone compared with wild type controls (7Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. Samama P. Hamilton R.A. Bond R.A. Milano C.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1995; 268: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). To assess the levels of myocardial βARK activity in the different gene-targeted mice, we prepared soluble myocardial extracts and carried out in vitro GRK phosphorylation assays using rhodopsin as a G protein-coupled receptor substrate. To address whether the βARKct is functional, we added purified Gβγ to the reactions. As shown in Fig. 1, Gβγ-stimulated βARK activity is decreased in a stepwise fashion with the βARK1(+/−)/βARKct animals having only ≈25% of the wild-type myocardial βARK activity. Myocardial extracts from the βARK1(+/−) animals had 50% of the wild-type activity, which correlates to the 50% decrease in βARK1 protein we have previously described (9Jaber M. Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. Smith B. Bond R.A. Sulik K. Ross Jr., J. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Giros B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12974-12979Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). This significant decrease in myocardial βARK1 activity in the double gene-targeted mice could also be demonstrated when expressing the data as fold-stimulation of Gβγ over basal rhodopsin phosphorylation activity (−Gβγ). In βARK1(±)/βARKct animals, Gβγ only stimulated activity by 2.24 ± 0.30-fold (n = 5) compared with 4.48 ± 0.93-fold (n = 6) for the wild-type animals (p < 0.05). Extracts from βARK1(+/−) hearts had similar values to wild-type (3.75 ± 0.88-fold, n = 6). Because of the dependence of the βARKct activity on Gβγ, as expected, in vitro βARK activity in the absence of Gβγ was equivalent between βARK1(+/−) extracts and βARK1(+/−)/βARKct extracts, which was ≈50% of wild-type activity (data not shown). We have previously reported that overexpression of the βARKct in transgenic mice leads to a significant enhancement of myocardial βAR signaling and myocardial contractility in vivo under basal conditions and in response to catecholamine infusion (7Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. Samama P. Hamilton R.A. Bond R.A. Milano C.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1995; 268: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). To determine whether the level of βARK1 modulates catecholamine responsivenessin vivo, cardiac catheterization was performed in intact anesthetized mice before and after infusion of isoproterenol (Fig. 2). Although the isovolumic phase measure of myocardial contractility, LV dP/dt max, was not increased in the βARK1(+/−) at baseline compared to wild type, it was significantly enhanced in the βARK1(+/−)/βARKct mice. Contractile function was further and significantly augmented in the two gene-targeted groups in response to isoproterenol with the greatest level observed in the βARK1(+/−)/βARKct (Fig. 2 A). Enhanced myocardial relaxation, as assessed by LV dP/dt min was particularly evident in the βARK1(+/−)/βARKct animals but not in the βARK1(+/−) at baseline (Fig. 2 B). As shown in Fig. 2, C andD, LV systolic pressure and heart rate were increased in the gene-targeted animals at baseline, which was further potentiated with isoproterenol stimulation. This is particularly apparent for changes in heart rate (Fig. 2 D). Heart rate is a powerful determinant of myocardial contractility and can have important influences on LV dP/dt max (22Palakodeti V. Oh S. Oh B.H. Mao L. Hongo M. Ross Jr., J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1283-H1290PubMed Google Scholar). To illustrate this point, the data has been plotted for the three groups showing the relationship between LV dP/dt max and heart rate at baseline (Fig. 3 A) and with maximal isoproterenol (Fig. 3 B). In general, the animals with the highest heart rate also had the greatest LV dP/dt max. Taken together these data demonstrate that the level of βARK1 activity exerts tight control over the inotropic and chronotropic response to catecholamine stimulation in the heart in vivo. Since both loading conditions (LV end-diastolic pressure) and heart rate influence the in vivo measurement of myocardial contractility as measured by LV dP/dt max (22Palakodeti V. Oh S. Oh B.H. Mao L. Hongo M. Ross Jr., J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1283-H1290PubMed Google Scholar, 23Little W.C. Circ. Res. 1985; 56: 808-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), studies were performed on adult myocardial cells isolated from both of the gene-targeted mouse strains. To determine whether a decrease in the level of βARK1 would affect myocyte contractility in the absence of potential confounding influences such as heart rate and mechanical loading, freshly isolated single adult myocytes were obtained from normal, βARK1(+/−), and βARK1(+/−)/βARKct) gene-targeted mice followed by an assessment of the contractile properties. Measurements of contractile parameters in unloaded isolated adult cells were made in the absence and presence of isoproterenol (10−7m) at a constant paced stimulation of 0.5 Hz. Adult myocytes isolated from wild-type hearts responded to isoproterenol stimulation with a 12% increase from baseline in %CS and the rate of shortening (−dL/dt) without a change in diastolic cell length (Fig. 4and Table I). In contrast, adult myocytes isolated from βARK1(+/−) heterozygote animals showed an 18% increase in −dL/dt, whereas myocytes from βARK1(+/−)/βARKct hearts showed an even greater increase in −dL/dt (29%) following isoproterenol administration (Table I and Fig. 4). Similarly, %CS under baseline and isoproterenol conditions was progressively higher in myocytes isolated from the two gene-targeted mouse lines compared with wild-type cells (Table I). Overall cells isolated from βARK1(+/−) and βARK1(+/−)/βARKct mice had a significantly greater, and stepwise, increase in contractile parameters with isoproterenol compared with wild-type litter mates (Table I). These data complement thein vivo assessment of contractile function and show that intrinsic myocyte contractility can be directly influenced by the level of βARK1.Table IContractile parameters in adult myocytes isolated from gene-targeted miceWild type (n = 5)βARK1(+/−) (n = 6)βARK1(+/−)/βARKct (n = 5)BasalIso (10−7m)BasalIso (10−7m)BasalIso (10−7m)−dL/dt(μm/s)−330.1 ± 13.0−369.3 ± 13.5−373.8 ± 20.8−439.2 ± 21.2ap < 0.03 βARK1(+/−) or βARK1(+/−)/βARKct vs. wild type.−392.4 ± 31.5−506.7 ± 24.6ap < 0.03 βARK1(+/−) or βARK1(+/−)/βARKct vs. wild type.,bp < 0.05 βARK1(+/−)/βARKctvs. βARK1(+/−).+dL/dt(μm/s)212.0 ± 16.3240.2 ± 19.2269.8 ± 22.9320.1 ± 19.6ap < 0.03 βARK1(+/−) or βARK1(+/−)/βARKct vs. wild type.206.2 ± 11.8233.5 ± 17.1bp < 0.05 βARK1(+/−)/βARKctvs. βARK1(+/−).Maximum length (μm)124.1 ± 2.7124.4 ± 2.6121.7 ± 2.7122.3 ± 2.5113.1 ± 0.9cp < 0.05 βARK1(+/−) or βARK1(+/−)/βARKct vs. wild type.,dp < 0.03 βARK1(+/−)/βARKctvs. βARK1(+/−).114.9 ± 2.2ap < 0.03 βARK1(+/−) or βARK1(+/−)/βARKct vs. wild type.,bp < 0.05 βARK1(+/−)/βARKctvs. βARK1(+/−).Minimum length (μm)103.2 ± 3.0100.8 ± 3.197.9 ± 2.695.5 ± 2.787.4 ± 1.7cp < 0.05 βARK1(+/−) or βARK1(+/−)/βARKct vs. wild type.,dp < 0.03 βARK1(+/−)/βARKctvs. βARK1(+/−).87.7 ± 2.0ap < 0.03 βARK1(+/−) or βARK1(+/−)/βARKct vs. wild type.,bp < 0.05 βARK1(+/−)/βARKctvs. βARK1(+/−).% CS17.1 ± 0.719.2 ± 0.919.7 ± 0.8cp < 0.05 βARK1(+/−) or βARK1(+/−)/βARKct vs. wild type.22.1 ± 0.9ap < 0.03 βARK1(+/−) or βARK1(+/−)/βARKct vs. wild type.22.8 ± 1.4cp < 0.05 βARK1(+/−) or βARK1(+/−)/βARKct vs. wild type.,dp < 0.03 βARK1(+/−)/βARKctvs. βARK1(+/−).23.7 ± 0.7ap < 0.03 βARK1(+/−) or βARK1(+/−)/βARKct vs. wild type.a p < 0.03 βARK1(+/−) or βARK1(+/−)/βARKct vs. wild type.b p < 0.05 βARK1(+/−)/βARKctvs. βARK1(+/−).c p < 0.05 βARK1(+/−) or βARK1(+/−)/βARKct vs. wild type.d p < 0.03 βARK1(+/−)/βARKctvs. βARK1(+/−). Open table in a new tab The present study demonstrates that 1) βARK1(+/−) mice that are heterozygote for ablation of the βARK1 gene and have a 50% reduction in the level of βARK1 in the heart develop normally, 2) the level of chronotropy and inotropy in vivo can be modulated by the level of βARK1 expression, and 3) contractile function can be further enhanced through in vivo βARK1 inhibition by competing for Gβγ binding and endogenous βARK1 translocation and activation. Complete disruption of the βARK1 gene in mice leads to a lethal phenotype with no βARK1(−/−) embryos surviving beyond gestational day 15.5 (9Jaber M. Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. Smith B. Bond R.A. Sulik K. Ross Jr., J. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Giros B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12974-12979Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The finding that mice that are heterozygous for the βARK1 deletion have no developmental abnormalities and develop into normal adults, suggests that there is a threshold level for βARK1 that allows for normal cardiac development. Although the βARK1(+/−) mice grow into normal adults, the functional consequence of reduced βARK1 levels is a phenotype of decreased desensitization in the heart as shown by the enhanced contractile response to isoproterenol stimulation (Fig. 2). βARK1 requires a membrane-targeting event prior to receptor phosphorylation that occurs through the interaction of membrane anchored Gβγ subunits and the carboxyl terminus of βARK1 (5Pitcher J.A. Inglese J. Higgins J.B. Arriza J.L. Casey P.J. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Kwatra M.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1264-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Preventing βARK1 translocation by competing for Gβγ binding in transgenic mice overexpressing a peptide inhibitor (βARKct) results in an in vivo phenotype of enhanced basal and agonist-stimulated contractility due to decreased receptor desensitization (7Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. Samama P. Hamilton R.A. Bond R.A. Milano C.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1995; 268: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). The mating of these two gene-targeted mice (βARK1(+/−) and βARKct overexpression) results in a further enhancement of contractility and relaxation (Fig. 2). These data suggest that both the level of βARK1 expression and the active process of translocation and activation of βARK1, determine the degree of βAR desensitization and subsequent receptor-G protein coupling. The isovolumic phase index (LV dP/dt max) is a sensitive measure of contractility. However, the level of contractility is significantly influenced by heart rate and loading conditions in particular, preload (23Little W.C. Circ. Res. 1985; 56: 808-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In this regard, it has recently been shown that there is a linear relationship between heart rate and LV dP/dt max (22Palakodeti V. Oh S. Oh B.H. Mao L. Hongo M. Ross Jr., J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1283-H1290PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we show that the significantly enhanced contractile performance of mice with altered levels of βARK1, as measured by LV dP/dt max, is also associated with a modest increase in heart rate. To address this issue, we specifically assessed contractile parameters in single adult ventricular myocytes isolated from both the βARK1(+/−) and βARK1(+/−)/βARKct gene-targeted mice to determine whether the in vivophenotype in these animals can be attributed to an intrinsic increase in myocyte contractility. The effect of heart rate on contractile function was eliminated by pacing cells at 0.5 Hz. As shown in Table I, a significant augmentation of contractile parameters occurred following βAR stimulation in the βARK1(+/−) cells, which was further enhanced in the βARK1(+/−)/βARKct cells. Although as a group the cells isolated from the βARK1(+/−)/βARKct hearts were smaller than the other cells it did not seem to affect indices of contraction, but may have had some influence on the rate of relengthening (+dL/dt). These data show that βARK1 can directly influence contractility at a cellular level and confirm thein vivo data showing that reduced βARK1 levels leads to enhanced catecholamine responsiveness. These results are also consistent with a recent study on contractile function in single adult myocytes isolated from transgenic mice that overexpress either βARK1 or the βARKct, which showed that the presence of the βARKct resulted in an enhanced contractile response to βAR stimulation compared with control cells (24Korzick D.H. Xiao R.P. Ziman B.D. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Lakatta E.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H590-H596PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that adenoviral-mediated gene transfer of the βARKct can restore βAR signaling in failing myocytes isolated from chronically paced rabbits (25Akhter S.A. Skaer C.A. Kypson A.P. McDonald P.H. Peppel K.C. Glower D.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12100-12105Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In that in vitro study we showed that the biochemical defects in βAR signaling in isolated failing myocytes could be reversed by gene transfer of the βARKct (25Akhter S.A. Skaer C.A. Kypson A.P. McDonald P.H. Peppel K.C. Glower D.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12100-12105Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In this study, we extend those findings by showing that in vivo contractile function and isoproterenol responsiveness in the intact animal is related to the level of βARK1. Furthermore, we not only demonstrate that an inhibitor of βARK1 (βARKct) can affect cellular contractility but also that the contractile state of the myocyte can be directly influenced by the level of βARK1 expression. There is increasing evidence that elevated levels of βARK1 contribute to impaired catecholamine responsiveness observed in disease states of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure (26Rockman H.A. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H1553-H1559PubMed Google Scholar). Elevated levels of βARK1 have been shown to be present in heart extracts from human end-stage heart failure (15Ungerer M. Bohm M. Elce J.S. Erdmann E. Lohse M.J. Circulation. 1993; 87: 454-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar) and in circulating lymphocytes from patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (11Gros R. Benovic J.L. Tan C.M. Feldman R.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2087-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). An essential role for βARK1 leading to impaired catecholamine responsiveness has been shown in various animal models of cardiac disease including cardiac hypertrophy (12Choi D.J. Koch W.J. Hunter J.J. Rockman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17223-17229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and myocardial ischemia (13Ungerer M. Kessebohm K. Kronsbein K. Lohse M.J. Richardt G. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In this regard it is worthwhile to note that the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (17Anzai T. Gao M. Ping P. Hammond H.K. Circulation. 1996; 94 (abstsr.): I-643PubMed Google Scholar) in experimental heart failure was associated with a reduction in myocardial βARK1 activity. Furthermore in a mouse model of pressure overload hypertrophy, impaired βAR signaling that occurs with the development of modest myocardial hypertrophy, could be completely reversed in the presence of the βARK inhibitor (βARKct) (12Choi D.J. Koch W.J. Hunter J.J. Rockman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17223-17229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that not only is βARK1 a critical modulator of in vivo cardiac function (7Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. Samama P. Hamilton R.A. Bond R.A. Milano C.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1995; 268: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), but the level of βARK1 activity is important and can directly influence the degree to which the βAR-signaling pathway is activated. This has important implications in disease states of increased βARK activity when considering βARK1 as a therapeutic target, since even partial inhibition of βARK1 function will effectively enhance βAR signaling leading to improved catecholamine responsiveness. This study is of particular significance given our recent data showing the dramatic beneficial effect of overexpression of a βARK inhibitor in a mouse model of heart failure (19Rockman H.A. Chien K.R. Choi D.J. Iaccarino G. Hunter J.J. Ross Jr., J. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7000-7005Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2000961724,"Activation of fatty acids to their coenzyme A derivatives is necessary for subsequent metabolism. Very long-chain fatty acids, which accumulate in tissues of patients with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, are activated by very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (VLCS) normally found in peroxisomes and microsomes. We identified a candidate yeast VLCS gene (FAT1), previously identified as encoding afatty acid transport protein, by its homology to rat liver peroxisomal VLCS. Disruption of this gene decreased, but did not abolish, cellular VLCS activity. Fractionation studies showed that VLCS activity, but not long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase activity, was reduced to about 40% of wild-type level in both 27,000 × g supernatant and pellet fractions. Separation of organelles in the pellet fraction by density gradient centrifugation revealed that VLCS activity was associated with peroxisomes and microsomes but not mitochondria. FAT1deletion strains exhibited decreased growth on medium containing dextrose, oleic acid, and cerulenin, an inhibitor of fatty acid synthesis. FAT1 deletion strains grown on either dextrose or oleic acid medium accumulated very long-chain fatty acids. Compared with wild-type yeast, C22:0, C24:0, and C26:0 levels were increased approximately 20-, 18-, and 3-fold in deletion strains grown on dextrose, and 2-, 7-, and 5-fold in deletion strains grown on oleate. Long-chain fatty acid levels in wild-type and deletion strains were not significantly different. All biochemical defects in FAT1deletion strains were restored to normal after functional complementation with the FAT1 gene. The level of VLCS activity measured in both wild-type and deletion yeast strains transformed with FAT1 cDNA paralleled the level of expression of the transgene. The extent of both the decrease in peroxisomal VLCS activity and the very long-chain fatty acid accumulation in the yeast FAT1 deletion model resembles that observed in cells from X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy patients. These studies suggest that the FAT1 gene product has VLCS activity that is essential for normal cellular very long-chain fatty acid homeostasis.

Metabolism of fatty acids by either catabolic or anabolic pathways requires initial activation to their coenzyme A (CoA) 1The abbreviations used are: CoA, coenzyme A; VLCFA, very long-chain fatty acid; VLCS, very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase; rVLCS, rat VLCS; mFATP, mouse fatty acid transport protein; LCS, long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase; FAT1 and Fat1p,S. cerevisiae fatty acid transporter/VLCS gene and protein, respectively; FAA and Faap, S. cerevisiae fatty acid activation gene and protein, respectively; XALD, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy; ALDP, adrenoleukodystrophy protein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s); MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. thioesters, a reaction catalyzed by acyl-CoA synthetase (1Watkins P.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 55-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Differences in substrate chain length specificity and subcellular localization distinguish the various acyl-CoA synthetases present in cells from all species examined, including animals, yeast, bacteria, and plants (1Watkins P.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 55-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Long-chain fatty acids (C12–C20) are activated by long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (LCSs) found in mitochondria, peroxisomes, and microsomes (1Watkins P.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 55-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), reflecting the primary roles of these organelles in fatty acid β-oxidation (mitochondria and peroxisomes) and complex lipid synthesis (microsomes). In contrast, activation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA; C22 or longer) by very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (VLCS) takes place only in peroxisomal and microsomal subcellular fractions of rat (2Singh H. Poulos A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 266: 486-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), human (3Lazo O. Contreras M. Hashmi M. Stanley W. Irazu C. Singh I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Commun. 1995; 206: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) cells. Lack of mitochondrial VLCS prevents this organelle from catabolizing VLCFA via β-oxidation, thus relegating this function to the peroxisome. VLCFA β-oxidation is impaired in cells from patients with the progressive neurodegenerative disease X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (XALD), resulting in elevated plasma and tissue concentrations of saturated VLCFA (5Moser H.W.

Biochemical studies revealed that VLCS activity was decreased in peroxisomal, but not microsomal, subcellular fractions of fibroblasts from XALD patients (3Lazo O. Contreras M. Hashmi M. Stanley W. Irazu C. Singh I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7647-7651Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 6Wanders R.J.A. van Roermund C.W.T. van Wijland M.J.A.

However, further investigation of the molecular defect in XALD revealed that key steps in peroxisomal VLCFA metabolism are still poorly understood. The product of the gene defective in XALD (ALDP) is not VLCS, but rather is a peroxisomal membrane protein whose existence was previously unknown (7Mosser J. Douar A.M. Sarde C.O. Kioschis P. Feil R. Moser H. Poustka A.M. Mandel J.L. Aubourg P. Nature. 1993; 361: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). Studies in many laboratories, including our own (8Kok F. Neumann S. Sarde C.O. Zheng S. Wu K.H. Wei H.M. Bergin J. Watkins P.A. Gould S.J. Moser H.W. Mandel J.L. Smith K.D. Hum. Mutat. 1995; 6: 104-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), clearly demonstrated that XALD patients have mutations in the ALD gene, and complementation studies confirmed that transfection of XALD cells with the ALD gene restores their ability to catabolize VLCFA (9Braiterman L.T.

While studies of XALD suggest that ALDP is required for VLCFA activation, the biochemical relationship between ALDP and VLCS has not yet been elucidated. Thus, to further our understanding of peroxisomal VLCFA activation, we are investigating this process in yeast. Yeasts are unique model organisms for the study of peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation, since they lack the mitochondrial β-oxidation pathway found in higher animals. They have been valuable for identification of proteins subsequently shown to be defective in human disorders of peroxisome biogenesis (11Shimozawa N. Tsukamoto T. Suzuki Y. Orii T. Shirayoshi Y.

Chen C.I. Gould S.J. Watkins P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used by Gordon and co-workers to identify and characterize four fattyacid activation (FAA1–4) genes that encode acyl-CoA synthetases (17Knoll L.J. Johnson D.R. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16348-16356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Johnson D.R. Knoll L.J. Levin D.E. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). They examined the fatty acid substrate specificity of the protein products of three of theseFAA genes (Faa1p, Faa2p, and Faa3p) in detail; while Faa3p weakly activated VLCFA, Faa1p and Faa2p had no detectable activity with these substrates (17Knoll L.J. Johnson D.R. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16348-16356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Faa4p was reported to be functionally interchangeable with Faa1p and thus is not likely to be a VLCS (18Johnson D.R. Knoll L.J. Levin D.E. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Based on growth studies of yeast mutants in which all fourFAA genes were disrupted, Gordon and colleagues concluded that at least one other FAA gene exists in S. cerevisiae (18Johnson D.R. Knoll L.J. Levin D.E. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Recently, Hashimoto and co-workers purified an enzyme with VLCS activity from rat liver peroxisomes (rVLCS) (19Uchida Y. Kondo N. Orii T. Hashimoto T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and subsequently cloned and sequenced its cDNA (20Uchiyama A. Aoyama T. Kamijo K. Uchida Y. Kondo M. Orii T. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30360-30365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We identified an open reading frame on S. cerevisiae chromosome II (YBR041W; locus FAT1) with homology to the rVLCS amino acid sequence. Both rVLCS and theFAT1 gene product, Fat1p, are homologous to mouse fatty acid transport protein (mFATP), described by Schaffer and Lodish (21Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Faergeman et al. (22Faergeman N.J. DiRusso C.C. Elberger A. Knudsen J. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8531-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) independently identified theFAT1 (fatty acidtransporter 1) gene by virtue of the homology of Fat1p to mFATP. These investigators found that deletion ofFAT1 resulted in decreased rates of cellular uptake of labeled long-chain fatty acid, decreased cellular uptake of fluorescent fatty acids, and decreased uptake and incorporation of labeled oleic acid into cellular phospholipids (22Faergeman N.J. DiRusso C.C. Elberger A. Knudsen J. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8531-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Although they noted amino acid sequence similarities between Fat1p and acyl-CoA synthetases, these investigators found that deletion of the FAT1 gene did not affect LCS activity (22Faergeman N.J. DiRusso C.C. Elberger A. Knudsen J. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8531-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, they did not investigate either the role of Fat1p in VLCFA metabolism or the subcellular localization of this protein. In this report, we present evidence that Fat1p has VLCS activity and is present in both peroxisomes and a 27,000 ×g supernatant fraction of S. cerevisiae. Furthermore, deletion of the FAT1 gene resulted in accumulation of VLCFA in yeast cells similar to that observed in plasma and tissues of XALD patients. These findings support the hypothesis that Fat1p is a VLCS whose activity is critical for normal cellular VLCFA homeostasis. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers (5′-GGYTCRTCYTTYTCNACRTC-3′ and 5′-ACNGGNACNCCRTANACRTT-3′) corresponding to two peptide fragments (referred to as internal sequences 1 and 2) of the rVLCS (19Uchida Y. Kondo N. Orii T. Hashimoto T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) were used to amplify by PCR a 348-base pair product using a liver cDNA library from a Gemfibrozil-treated rat as the template. Treatment of rats with the peroxisome proliferator Gemfibrozil was previously found to increase peroxisomal rVLCS activity by about 2-fold. 2P. A. Watkins, unpublished observations. The PCR product, containing an open reading frame with 45% amino acid identity to mFATP (21Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), was labeled with [32P]dCTP and used as a probe to screen the rat liver cDNA library. One clone (0.7 kb) containing an open reading frame of 220 amino acids was obtained; the nucleotide sequence of this clone was subsequently found to be identical to the carboxyl terminus of the rVLCS cDNA sequence later published (20Uchiyama A. Aoyama T. Kamijo K. Uchida Y. Kondo M. Orii T. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30360-30365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The 220-amino acid open reading frame was compared with all open reading frames of the complete S. cerevisiae genome (Saccharomyces Genome Data Base) using the BLAST algorithm (23Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). Only one likely candidate for a homologous yeast protein was identified (smallest sum probability = 9e-24). This gene (open reading frame YBR041W; locus FAT1) is found on chromosome II and is identical to that subsequently described by Faergeman et al. (22Faergeman N.J. DiRusso C.C. Elberger A. Knudsen J. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8531-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The SWISS-PROT Data base entry for the protein (Fat1p) encoded by the FAT1 gene noted similarity to enzymes that act via an ATP-dependent covalent binding of AMP to their substrate. S. cerevisiae strain YPH680 (MATα his3Δ200 leu2Δ1 lys2Δ202 trp1Δ1 ura3–52) isogenic to YPH681 (MATa), a derivative of S288C (24Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2646) Google Scholar), was the strain used for PCR-mediated disruption of the FAT1 gene. Cells were grown at 30 °C in rich medium containing dextrose as primary carbon source (YPD, consisting of 10 g/liter yeast extract (Life Technologies, Inc.), 20 g/liter Bacto-peptone (Difco), and 20 g/liter dextrose (Sigma)). For induction of peroxisomes, yeasts were grown in YPD to an A 600 of 1. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min, resuspended to an A 600 of 0.5 in medium containing oleic acid as primary carbon source (YPOLT, where 0.2% (w/v) oleic acid (Sigma) solubilized with 0.02% (w/v) Tween 40 (Sigma) replaced dextrose), and grown for 12–14 h at 30 °C (25Crane D.I. Kalish J.E. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21835-21844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast growth characteristics were assessed on YPD/agar plates supplemented with 500 μmoleic acid and 0.033% (w/v) Tween 40, with or without 25 μm cerulenin (Sigma); 5 μl of cells diluted to anA 600 of 0.01 were applied to plates and incubated for 16 h at 24 and 30 °C. S. cerevisiae genomic DNA was isolated (26Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1979Google Scholar) and used as a template for PCR amplification of the FAT1 gene. PCR amplification was performed using the Expand Long Template PCR System (Boehringer Mannheim) with forward primer 5′-TACTGTCACCTTGATGAGCGAC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TCGATGGCTTCCCAATCAG-3′. Thirty-five cycles of 94 °C (20 s), 57 °C (60 s), and 68 °C (150 s) were performed. The resulting 2.2-kb amplicon containing the FAT1 gene (from −196 to +1990, where +1 is the first nucleotide of the translation initiation codon) was TA-cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) to produce pJFL3301. AHindIII/XbaI fragment from pJFL3301 was then cloned into the low copy number (CEN) vector pRS416 (27Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), producing pJFL3302. DNA sequencing of pJFL3302 was performed at the Johns Hopkins University Genetics Core Facility using the fluorescent dideoxy terminator method of cycle sequencing on an Applied Biosystems Inc. 373a automated DNA sequencer, following ABI protocols. Comparison of the sequence of pJFL3302 with that of FAT1 as contained in the Saccharomyces Genome Data base revealed that the data base sequence contained a CpC dinucleotide insertion at bp 1857–1858. Four subsequent attempts to amplify an 896-bp fragment containing this region using forward primer 5′-GGTGAAGGTTGCTTATGGTAACGG-3′ and the reverse primer described above and PCR kits from three different manufacturers (Boehringer Mannheim, Promega, and Life Technologies, Inc.) yielded products with sequence identical to that contained in pJFL3302, ruling out random PCR-generated error. These findings suggested that the data base sequence may be in error. To verify this possibility, reverse transcription-PCR of wild-type yeast RNA was carried out as described below. RNA was treated with DNase I prior to cDNA synthesis. A 595-bp fragment of the FAT1 gene containing the putative CpC deletion region was amplified using the forward primer 5′-TTTCCTTGATAGAATGGGTG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CCTTTCCATATGTTATTAGG-3′. Sequencing of this fragment confirmed that the FAT1 transcript also lacked the CpC dinucleotide. Thus, we concluded that the data base sequence was in error, and this has been communicated to the curator of the Saccharomyces Genome Data base. Computer-assisted translation of our correctedFAT1 sequence yielded an open reading frame of 669 amino acids ending in -IKL, a yeast peroxisome targeting signal (28Elgersma Y. Vos A. van den Berg M. van Roermund C.W. van der Sluijs P. Distel B. Tabak H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26375-26382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The correct nucleotide sequence of FAT1 and the predicted amino acid sequence of Fat1p are shown in Fig. 1. Computer-assisted translation of the coding sequence of pJFL3302 revealed that this plasmid encodes amino acids 1–662 of Fat1p plus 11 amino acids (EAEFQHTGGRY-COOH) derived from vector sequence. Since this construct did not contain the entire open reading frame ofFAT1, we amplified by PCR a fragment containing the true 3′-end of the gene from genomic DNA. A 1-kb fragment was amplified using forward primer 5′-GGTGGAGGTTGCTTATGGTAACGG-3′, reverse primer 5′-CCTTTCCATATGTTATTAGG-3′, and Taq polymerase (Promega). Amplicons were TA-cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) to produce pJFL3305. A 223-bp Eco47III/SalI fragment of pJFL3305 was introduced into pJFL3302 to generate pJFL3307, which contains full-length FAT1 cDNA in the pRS416 (CEN) vector. The nucleotide sequence of pJFL3307 was correct with the exception of a silent mutation in amino acid Ser595. In complementation experiments, FAT1 deletion strains were transformed with pJFL3302 or pJFL3307 (26Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1979Google Scholar). For overexpression studies, the complete FAT1 sequence was transferred to a high copy 2μ vector. A 2.2-kbEco47III/ApaI fragment was transferred from pJFL3301 to pJFL3305 to form pJFL3306; the complete FAT1open reading frame was excised from pJFL3306 with SpeI andXhoI and transferred to the 2μ vector pRS426 (27Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to form pSJW981. Here, we refer to the sequence contained in pJFL3302 asFAT1–1 and that contained in pJFL3307 and pSJW981 asFAT1. PCR-mediated gene disruption of the FAT1 gene was performed by the method of Lorenz et al. (29Lorenz M.C. Muir R.S. Lim E. McElver J. Weber S.C. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 158: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). A forward primer consisting of 40 nucleotides of FAT1 sequence upstream of the initiation ATG and 20 left primer sequence-specific nucleotides for pRS plasmids (5′-TCTATATCGTTGAACTTTTAATAGGCTGCGAATACCGACTCTGTGCGGTATTTCACACCG-3′) and a reverse primer consisting of 40 nucleotides of FAT1sequence downstream of the stop codon (as contained in theSaccharomyces Genome Data base; nucleotides 1871–1910) plus 20 right primer sequence-specific nucleotides for pRS plasmids (5′-TCCAAACCCTTTGGTAATTTTTGCTCTCTATAAACCTTCTAGATTGTACTGAGAGTGCAC-3′) were used to amplify pRS303 using a two-step program (24Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2646) Google Scholar). SevenHIS prototrophs were selected following transformation of YPH680 with this PCR product (26Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1979Google Scholar). PCR using the forward and reverse primers used to clone FAT1 (described above) and genomic DNA prepared from wild-type and candidate gene disruption strains was performed to confirm disruption of FAT1. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels. Four of the seven strains contained a PCR product of the expected size (1231 bp) forFAT1 disruption. The expected 2186-bp PCR product was observed in wild-type strains. Peroxisomes were induced in wild-type and gene deletion yeast strains by growth in YPOLT medium as described above. Spheroplasts were prepared, homogenized, and fractionated into 27,000 × g supernatant and organelle pellet as described by Crane et al. (25Crane D.I. Kalish J.E. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21835-21844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, the organelle pellet was further fractionated by centrifugation on linear Nycodenz (sold as Accudenz by Accurate Chemical and Scientific) gradients (30Erdmann R. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 509-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). 0.5 ml of Maxidens (sold as Purdenz by Accurate Chemical and Scientific) was placed at the bottom of a 13-ml Beckman Quickseal tube, followed by a 10.5-ml linear gradient of 15% Nycodenz and 0.25 m sucrose (top) to 42.5% Nycodenz and 0.125m sucrose (bottom) in 5 mm MES, pH 6.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm KCl, 0.1% ethanol. The organelle pellet in homogenization buffer (5 mm MES, pH 6.0, 0.6m sorbitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm KCl, 0.1% ethanol) was layered on top of the Nycodenz, and tubes were centrifuged for 75 min at 174,000 × g in a vertical ultracentrifuge rotor. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected from the bottom of the tube and assayed for acyl-CoA synthetase activity (below) and marker enzyme activity as described previously (4Kalish J.E. Chen C.I. Gould S.J. Watkins P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Because protein cannot be quantitated accurately in Nycodenz solutions, and because this compound had been shown to inhibit other fatty acid metabolic pathways (31Singh I. Pahan K. Dhaunsi G.S. Lazo O. Ozand P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9972-9979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in some experiments, peak peroxisomal and mitochondrial fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mm MES, pH 7.0, prior to assay. Acyl-CoA synthetase activity was measured essentially as described previously (32Watkins P.A. Ferrell Jr., E.V. Pedersen J.I. Hoefler G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 289: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Labeled fatty acids, [1-14C]lignoceric acid (C24:0; American Radiolabeled Chemicals) and [1-14C]palmitic acid (C16:0; NEN Life Science Products) were solubilized in α-cyclodextrin (Sigma) and incubated with enzyme for 20 min at 30 °C in 40 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm ATP, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm CoA, and 0.2 mmdithiothreitol. Labeled acyl-CoAs were extracted from the reaction mixture by the method of Dole (33Dole V.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1956; 35: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar) and quantitated in a Beckman LS 3801 liquid scintillation counter. Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (34Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from spheroplasts prepared from yeast, grown in either YPD or YPOLT medium, using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). cDNA synthesis was from 1.0 μg of RNA (pretreated with DNase I; Boehringer Mannheim) from yeast grown under each condition and utilized 20 ng of (dT)15 (Boehringer Mannheim) and 100 ng of hexanucleotides (Sigma) as primers. The reaction was carried out at 42 °C for 1 h with 20 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Boehringer Mannheim), buffer supplied with the enzyme, 20 units of RNasin (Promega), and 125 μm each dNTP. After treatment at 95 °C for 3 min, an equal aliquot of each reverse transcription reaction was used as PCR template with forward primer 5′-TTTCCTTGATAGAATGGGTG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CCAATCAGCAGCGGTCAAGA-3′ designed to amplify a 424-bp fragment ofFAT1 cDNA. An additional PCR was carried out using forward primer 5′-CCCAGATCTATGAGCAGTCGTGTGTGCTAC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CCCGAGCTCAGTTGTGAAGCACTTTAGTTAC-3′ (kindly provided by Dr. M. Geraghty) designed to amplify a 1116-bp fragment containing YOR180C (locus EDH2), a peroxisomal enoyl-CoA hydratase gene with a consensus upstream oleate response element. Thirty-five cycles of 94 °C (45 s), 55 °C (45 s), and 72 °C (60 s) were performed using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Boehringer Mannheim). Yeast grown in either YPD (250A 600) or YPOLT (60 A 600) were harvested by centrifugation, washed three times with deionized water, suspended in 0.5 ml water, and subjected to sonic disruption. After determination of the protein concentration by the method of Miller (35Miller G.L. Anal. Chem. 1959; 31: 964Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar), total lipids were extracted by a modification of the method of Folch et al. (36Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 457-509Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), and total fatty acids were quantitated by gas chromatography as their methyl esters using the method of Moser and Moser (37Moser H.W. Moser A.B. Hommes F.A. Techniques in Diagnostic Human Biochemical Genetics. Wiley-Liss, New York1991: 177-191Google Scholar). A cDNA library from the liver of a rat treated with the peroxisome proliferator Gemfibrozil was screened, and a 660-bp fragment containing a 220-amino acid open reading frame thought to be the carboxyl terminus of rat VLCS was cloned as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The sequence of this fragment was 100% identical to that of authentic rat liver VLCS, which was subsequently published by Uchiyama et al.

Different size fragments of the Wiskott Aldrich syndrome protein, W4, W7 and W13, were expressed in Escherichia coli or obtained from proteolysis. All contain the GTPase binding domain (GBD), also called Cdc42/Rac interactive binding region (CRIB), found in many putative downstream effectors of Rac and Cdc42. We have developed assays to measure the binding interaction between these fragments and Cdc42 employing fluorescentN-methylanthraniloyl-guanine nucleotide analogues. The fragments bind with submicromolar affinities in a GTP-dependent manner, with the largest fragment having the highest affinity, showing that the GBD/CRIB motif is necessary but not sufficient for tight binding. Rate constants for the interaction with W13 have been determined via surface plasmon resonance, and the equilibrium dissociation constant obtained from their ratio agrees with the value obtained by fluorescence measurements. Far UV circular dichroism spectra show significant secondary structure only for W13, supported by fluorescence studies using intrinsic protein fluorescence and quenching by acrylamide. Proton and 15N NMR measurements show that the GBD/CRIB motif has no apparent secondary structure and that the region C-terminal to the GBD/CRIB region is α-helical. The binding of Cdc42 induces a structural rearrangement of residues in the GBD/CRIB motif, or alternatively, the Wiskott Aldrich syndrome protein fragments have an ensemble of conformations, one of which is stabilized by Cdc42 binding. Thus, in contrast to Ras effectors, which have no conserved sequence elements but a defined domain structure with ubiquitin topology, Rac/Cdc42 effectors have a highly conserved binding region but no defined domain structure in the absence of the GTP-binding protein. Deviating from common belief GBD/CRIB is neither a structural domain nor sufficient for tight binding as regions outside this motif are necessary for structure formation and tight interaction with Rho/Rac proteins.

Members of the Rho subfamily of GTP-binding proteins, namely Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, are involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. They cycle between a biologically inactive GDP-bound and an active GTP-bound state. The ratio of these states is regulated by GEFs, 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factors; Cdc42V12, G12V mutant of Cdc42; Cdc42wt, wild type human Cdc42, placental isoform; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy; ROESY, rotating frame enhancement spectroscopy; TOCSY, total correlated spectroscopy; Clean-TOCSY, TOCSY with suppression of ROESY-type cross-peaks; CRIB, Cdc42/Rac interactive binding; DQF-COSY, double quantum filtered correlated spectroscopy; GAP, GTPase-activating proteins; GBD, GTPase binding domain; GDI, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor; Gpp(NH)p, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate; gsHSQC, gradient-selected HSQC; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HMQC, hetero multiple quantum coherence; HSQC, hetero single quantum coherence; mant, -O-(N-methylanthraniloyl); NOEs, nuclear Overhauser effects; Wn, WASP fragment of approximate kDa mass; WASP, Wiskott Aldrich syndrome protein. 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factors; Cdc42V12, G12V mutant of Cdc42; Cdc42wt, wild type human Cdc42, placental isoform; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy; ROESY, rotating frame enhancement spectroscopy; TOCSY, total correlated spectroscopy; Clean-TOCSY, TOCSY with suppression of ROESY-type cross-peaks; CRIB, Cdc42/Rac interactive binding; DQF-COSY, double quantum filtered correlated spectroscopy; GAP, GTPase-activating proteins; GBD, GTPase binding domain; GDI, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor; Gpp(NH)p, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate; gsHSQC, gradient-selected HSQC; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HMQC, hetero multiple quantum coherence; HSQC, hetero single quantum coherence; mant, -O-(N-methylanthraniloyl); NOEs, nuclear Overhauser effects; Wn, WASP fragment of approximate kDa mass; WASP, Wiskott Aldrich syndrome protein. guanine nucleotide exchange factors, and GAPs, GTPase-activating proteins. In the GTP-bound state they interact with so-called effectors or downstream targets that are defined as molecules that have a high affinity to the GTP-bound state as opposed to a low affinity to the GDP-bound state. The Wiskott Aldrich syndrome is a genetically determined, X-linked recessive disorder that affects cells of the hematopoietic lineage and fibroblasts. Molecular symptoms include cytoskeletal abnormalities in T-cells and platelets as well as deficient chemotaxis in neutrophils. The three major phenotypic appearances are thrombocytopenia, eczema, and recurrent infections due to defects in the immune response toward polysaccharide antigens. The gene is allelic to X-linked thrombocytopenia, a rare recessive disorder with other clinical symptoms than WAS (1Villa A. Notarangelo L. Macchi P. Mantuano E. Cavagni G. Brugnoni D. Strina D. Patrosso M. Ramenghi U. Sacco M.G. Ugazio A. Vezzoni P. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Cloning of the gene (2Derry J.M. Ochs H.D. Francke U. Cell. 1994; 78: 635-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) showed that the responsible protein WASP harbors several domains involved in signal transduction such as a proline-rich region binding to SH3 domains of adaptor proteins like Nck- and Src-type kinases. Other domains termed WH1 and WH2 (for WASP homology) are also found in other signaling molecules. A homologue called N-WASP has been cloned which shows 50% homology to WASP over the entire length (3Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). WASP and N-WASP contain a sequence motif of approximately 14 residues, the GBD, or CRIB motif (for Cdc42/Racinteractive binding) which has been shown to specifically bind the GTP-bound form of Cdc42 or Rac, with a preference for Cdc42 (4Symons M.

It has also been shown by x-ray structural analysis that Ras/Rap interact with RafRBD by forming an intermolecular β-sheet close to the effector region of Ras (19Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 375: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). To study the interaction between Cdc42 and proteins containing the CRIB motif and as a first step toward understanding the molecular defects of WAS, we have investigated their interaction using biophysical techniques such as circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence spectroscopy, surface plasmon resonance, and NMR. The plasmid pFusion3 (4Symons M. Derry J.M.J. Karlak B. Jiang S. Lemahieu V. McCormick F. Francke U. Abo A. Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar) coding for residues 48–321 of the human WASP was used as a template for polymerase chain reaction subcloning of fragments corresponding to residues 221–257 (W4) and 201–321 (W13). The oligonucleotides 5′-CGCGGATCCCCAGCTGATAAGAAACGCTCAGGG-3′ and 5′-CAGAATTCATCCATTCTGGGGGTC-3′ were used to amplify a 126-base pair DNA fragment coding for the 4-kDa peptide and the oligonucleotides 5′-CGCGGATCCGACATCCAGAACCCTGACATCACG-3′ and 5′-GTGAATTCATCGAGATGGCGGTG-3′ to amplify a 380-base pair DNA fragment coding for the 13-kDa peptide. After hydrolysis with BamHI and EcoRI, the fragments were cloned into the glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the identity of the constructs was verified by sequencing using the cycle sequencing procedure. Plasmids were transformed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (22Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4830) Google Scholar) for production of the protein. An overnight culture of BL21(DE3) cells containing the appropriate plasmid was diluted 100-fold into LB medium supplemented with 200 μg/ml ampicillin. At an A 600 = 0.8 synthesis of the GST fusion protein was induced by addition of 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. After further incubation at 37 °C for 4 h cells were harvested by centrifugation. The bacterial pellet was resuspended at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl (buffer A), 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. A MicrofluidizerTM (Microfluids Corp., Newton, MA) operating at 600 bar was used to disrupt the cells, and the 30,000 ×g supernatant was applied to a glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column preequilibrated in buffer A. Unspecifically bound proteins were eluted by washing with buffer A containing 500 mm NaCl. Incubation of the bound protein with buffer A including 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm ATP removed most of the contaminating E. coli DnaK protein. 2J. Reinstein, personal communication. The fusion protein was either eluted with 20 mm glutathione in buffer A or cleaved overnight with 10 units/ml thrombin. The 4-kDa WASP fragment was chromatographed over 10 ml of Source 30S (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, using a 0–1 m NaCl gradient in 200 ml and concentrated over a 3-kDa molecular weight cut-off membrane (Centricon-3, Amicon). Prolonged incubation of the GST-W13 protein with thrombin resulted in specific degradation of the 13-kDa WASP fragment to peptides encompassing residues 201–268 (W7) and 269–321 (W6), respectively. The 7-kDa WASP fragment was purified as described for the 4-kDa fragment. The 6-kDa WASP fragment strongly bound to the 13-kDa fragment and could only be removed by gel filtration on a G-75 Sephadex (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 3.0. Fractions containing the 13-kDa fragment were pooled, dialyzed twice against 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, and concentrated over a 10-kDa molecular weight cut-off membrane (Centricon-10, Amicon). Protein concentrations of the 4-, 7-, and 13-kDa WASP fragments were determined spectrophotometrically with calculated absorption coefficients of ε280 = 5690m−1 cm−1, 6970m−1 cm−1, and 8250m−1 cm−1, respectively, according to Gill and von Hippel (23Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (5052) Google Scholar). The plasmids coding for the GST fusions of the wild type (Cdc42wt) and G12V mutant (Cdc42V12) of the human Cdc42 protein were kindly provided by George Martin (Onyx Pharmaceuticals). After cleavage of the fusion proteins with thrombin, seven additional amino acid residues (GSKIISA) preceded the starting methionine at the N terminus of Cdc42wt, whereas the CdcV12 protein had only three additional amino acid residues (GSP) attached to its N terminus as determined by protein sequencing. Synthesis and initial steps of purification of Cdc42 were the same as described above for the WASP fragments except that the buffer used was buffer A with 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm1,4-dithioerythritol. The cleaved Cdc42 was in the GDP state as determined by high pressure liquid chromatography (see below). Exchange for both the fluorescent and non-fluorescent GTP analogue was achieved as described by John et al. (24John J. Frech M. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11792-11799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Complexation of Cdc42 with mGDP was possible by incubation with a 50-fold excess of mGDP in the presence of 10 mm EDTA for 2 h at ambient temperature. For all complexes further purification involved gel filtration on a G-75 Sephadex (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column in 20 mmHEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2. Cdc42 concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216033) Google Scholar) or spectrophotometrically according to Hiratsuka (26Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) when complexed with mant nucleotides. Cdc42·nucleotide complexes were analyzed by isocratic high pressure liquid chromatography (27Tucker J. Sczakiel G. Feuerstein J. John J. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1351-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) on a C18 reversed phase column (Bischoff, Leonberg, Germany). Because of its higher stability in dilute solutions all measurements were done with the G12V mutant of Cdc42 (Cdc42V12), whereas for the NMR studies wild type Cdc42 (Cdc42wt) was used. Control experiments showed that the interactions between WASP fragments and Cdc42 are not influenced by the G12V mutation. However, due to the high intrinsic GTPase rate of Cdc42, it was assumed that the wild type protein might even hydrolyze Gpp-(NH)p to GppNH2 in long term measurements and that the G12V mutation would prevent this. Protein identities and purity were checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Edman sequencing. Electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy on a Finnigan LCQ mass spectrometer was used to verify the molecular masses of the proteins and to determine the isotopic enrichment of 15N-labeled proteins. Fluorescence measurements were done on a FluoromaxTM spectrofluorimeter (Spex Industries) equipped with a thermostat set to 25 °C using cuvettes with a 0.5 × 1-cm2 section. Proteins were diluted into 40 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl (standard buffer). In case of Cdc42, 5 mm MgCl2 was added. Emission spectra were recorded after excitation at 280, 295, or 366 nm (1-nm bandwidth) with time constants of 0.1 or 1 s and 2-nm bandwidth. All spectra were corrected for buffer contributions. Titrations of Cdc42·mGpp(NH)p with WASP fragments were performed with an automatic titrator using a Hamilton syringe as reservoir for the ligand. The decrease in fluorescence at 435 nm was followed. Equilibrium dissociation constants were obtained by fitting the solution of a quadratic equation describing a bimolecular association model assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry to the data. For measurement of the dissociation of fluorescent nucleotides from Cdc42 and its complexes with WASP fragments a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled nucleotide was added, and the decrease in fluorescence at 435 nm (8 nm bandwidth) was followed. Single exponentials were fitted to the data using the program Grafit (Erithacus Software). Fluorescence quenching measurements using acrylamide as the quenching agent were carried out as follows. To 1.2-ml sample normalized to 5 μm tryptophan residues, aliquots of a 6 macrylamide stock solution were added. After excitation at 295 nm (0.5-nm bandwidth) the fluorescence signal at 357 nm (2-nm bandwidth) was followed for 2 min and averaged. Buffer contributions and dilution effects were accounted for and the inner filter effect due to the absorption of acrylamide at 295 nm was corrected by multiplying the fluorescence intensity by 10−A/2, where A is the absorption of the solution at 295 nm measured in a 1-cm cuvette. The results were analyzed on the basis of the Stern-Volmer equation (28Birks J.B. Photophysics of Aromatic Molecules. Wiley Interscience, New York1970: 443-447Google Scholar). Far UV CD spectra were recorded in 1-mm quartz cuvettes on a J710 spectropolarimeter (Jasco) at room temperature. Measurements were done at a protein concentration 10 μm in 20 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 6.5, with a sensitivity of 20 mdeg, a time constant of 1 s, and a bandwidth of 1 nm. Each spectrum was accumulated 10-fold. All spectra were corrected for buffer contributions and converted to mean residue ellipticities according to Schmid (29Schmid F.X. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1989: 251-285Google Scholar). For NMR measurements the samples were prepared by adding 50 μl of2H2O (99.9%) to 450 μl of a 1–2 mm solution of WASP fragment in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5. Homogeneity of the sample was tested before and after recording of NMR spectra by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrospray mass spectroscopy. Spectra were recorded at 300 K on a Bruker DRX-500 spectrometer equipped with shielded z gradients. For assignment of resonances in the free WASP fragments the following spectra were recorded: DQF-COSY, NOESY, and Clean-TOCSY for W4, W7, and W13, ROESY for W4 and W7,15N-gsHSQC for W4, W7, and W13, 15N TOCSY-HMQC for W4 and W7, and 15N NOESY-HMQC for W7. Spectra of WASP fragments complexed to Cdc42 were measured with 15N-gsHSQC (W4 and W7), 15N TOCSY-HMQC (W7), and 15N NOESY-HMQC (W7). Sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate was used as internal standard for calibration of proton resonances. For15N calibration the procedure of Wishart et al.(30Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar) was applied. Processing and analysis of the two- and three-dimensional spectra were done using the NDEE program package (Biosymbiose Inc., Bayreuth, Germany). With exception of the DQF-COSY, spectra were recorded in the phase-sensitive absorption mode with the time proportional phase incrementation method for quadrature detection in f 1. The time domain data for 1H and 15N frequencies were zero-filled once or twice prior to Fourier transformation. Two-dimensional spectra were acquired with 2 to 8K data points in f 2 dimension and 512 to 1K data points in f 1 dimension. The water resonance was suppressed by applying the WATERGATE sequence (31Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3525) Google Scholar) or by presaturation. Gradient-selected HSQC spectra were processed using a Blackman filter with a frequency cutoff at the water resonance and a down-sampling rate of 2. Prior to Fourier transformation all spectra were multiplied with a sine bell square window function shifted by π/4. Definition of secondary structure was done by calculation of the chemical shift indexes according to Wishart et al. (32Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Holm A. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). Characterization of α-helical secondary structure was done using angle and distance constraints, namely NH-Hαi,i+ 3 and NH-Hαi,i+ 4 NOEs. Additionally, dihedral angles were included to analyze the structural elements. Association and dissociation reactions involving Cdc42·Gpp(NH)p and Cdc42·GDP without a fluorescence label were studied by surface plasmon resonance in a BIAcoreTM system (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Since reaction of essential lysine residues can lead to partial inactivation of chemically coupled proteins, a sandwich assay (33Kuhlmann J. Macara I. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12027-12035Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) with anti-GST antibodies was used. These were coupled to the matrix following the protocol of the manufacturer (34O'Shannessy D.J. Brigham-Burke M. Peck K. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 205: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were incubated with the antibodies at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml for 7 min, followed by incubation with free ligand. Regeneration with 20 mmglycine, pH 2.0, and 0.005% SDS resulted in complete dissociation of all noncovalently bound ligands, leaving the immobilized immunoglobulin at essentially full activity. Binding of Cdc42 to binary complexes of antibody and GST-WASP fragments was analyzed in a concentration-dependent manner. To eliminate the contribution of nonspecific binding, equivalent controls with Cdc42·GDP were used to calculate specific signal changes. Experiments were performed at 20 °C in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.0005% (w/v) Igepal CA-630 (Sigma), a buffer system stabilizing the immobilized anti-GST antibodies. Binding and dissociation curves were fitted to the sum of a single exponential and a linear function to take into account the association and dissociation of GST complexes. It has been shown previously that small fragments of Rac/Cdc42 effectors containing the CRIB motif, also called the GTPase binding domain, GBD, fused to GST are able to bind to Cdc42 in an overlay assay and that the binding is dependent on Rac/Cdc42 being loaded with GTP (4Symons M. Derry J.M.J. Karlak B. Jiang S. Lemahieu V. McCormick F. Francke U. Abo A. Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 5Aspenström P. Lindberg U. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 70-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In the case of human WASP the smallest fragment that retained this property is a peptide of 34 amino acids comprising residues 235–268 (4Symons M. Derry J.M.J. Karlak B. Jiang S. Lemahieu V. McCormick F. Francke U. Abo A. Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Binding of an 81-residue human WASP fragment (amino acids 215–295) to Cdc42 has also been investigated by the ability of the fragment to inhibit the interaction of Cdc42-GTP and Cdc42GAP (35Zhang B. Wang Z.-X. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21999-22007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In order to define a Cdc42 binding domain for structural studies, to see whether any such fragments are necessary and sufficient for high affinity binding and to develop methods for the direct measurement of these interactions, we have produced various fragments from the human WASP in E. coli as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 1 A). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the purified fragments (Fig. 1 B) and mass spectroscopy show that the WASP fragments of 4 kDa (residues 221–257), 7 kDa (201–268), and 13 kDa (201–321) molecular mass, termed W4, W7, and W13, respectively, can be isolated as soluble non-GST fusion proteins without degradation and in reasonable quantities. The different fragments were tested for their ability to bind to Cdc42 in a nucleotide-dependent fashion. We have shown previously (36Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar,37Herrmann C. Horn G. Spaargaren M. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6794-6800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) that the Ras binding domains of c-Raf1 and Ral-GEF act as a GDI protein by inhibiting nucleotide dissociation from Ras in a saturable manner and that this effect can be used to measure the dissociation constant in solution for this interaction. When Cdc42 is loaded with the fluorescent non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue mGpp(NH)p, the dissociation of the fluorescent analogue, as measured by the decrease in fluorescence in the presence of excess unlabeled Gpp(NH)p, is 0.4·10−3 s−1, 2.6-fold slower than the dissociation of unlabeled Gpp(NH)p (not shown), similar to what has been found for the dissociation of mGDP versus GDP for Cdc42 (38Leonard D.A. Evans T. Hart M. Cerione R.A. Manor D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12323-12328Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the presence of increasing amounts of W13, the dissociation of nucleotide is inhibited (Fig. 2). With different WASP fragments different degrees of guanine nucleotide inhibition can be achieved, and it appears that the dissociation rate of mGpp(NH)p from the different Cdc42·mGpp(NH)p·WASP complexes is different (Table I). This indicates that in principle the affinity between the WASP fragment and Cdc42 can be measured by the GDI assay and that WASP affects nucleotide binding of Cdc42 in a similar manner as Ras effectors have an effect on nucleotide binding on Ras (36Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 37Herrmann C. Horn G. Spaargaren M. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol.

In mammalian cells, activation of a Golgi-associated phospholipase D activity by ADP-ribosylation factor results in hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidic acid (PA). This reaction has been proposed to stimulate nascent secretory vesicle budding from the trans-Golgi network. It is unclear whether PA itself or diacylglycerol (DAG), a metabolite implicated in yeast secretory vesicle formation, regulates budding. To distinguish between these possibilities we have used a permeabilized cell system supplemented with phospholipid-modifying enzymes that generate either DAG or PA. The data demonstrate that in mammalian cells accumulation of PA rather than DAG is a key step in regulating budding of secretory vesicles from the trans-Golgi network.

Recent observations from several laboratories have shown that phospholipid metabolism regulates intracellular vesicle transport, particularly in distal steps of the secretory pathway (1De Camilli P. Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P. Science. 1996; 271: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Studies from Emr and colleagues (2Stack J.H. Herman P.K. Schu P.V. Emr S.D.

Recently, a novel PI 3-kinase, thought to be complexed with the trans-Golgi network marker TGN38, was shown to stimulate release of poly(IgA)-receptor-containing constitutive secretory vesicles from liver Golgi membranes (3Jones S.M. Howell K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Two enzymes, phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase and phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PI-TP), respectively (4Hay J.C. Fisette P.L. Jenkins G.H. Fukami K. Takenawa T. Anderson R.A. Martin T.F.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), required for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), also regulate exocytosis of synaptic vesicles (5Martin T.F.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 271-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Although it is unclear how PI metabolism modulates vesicle traffic, several proteins involved in synaptic vesicle endocytosis interact with PIP2, e.g.dynamin, a GTPase involved in fission of endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane (6Salim K. Bottomley M.J. Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I. Scaife R. Margolis R.L. Gigg R. Smith C.I.E. Driscoll P.C. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6241-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Members of the phospholipase D (PLD) family of phospholipid-modifying enzymes have also been implicated in vesicle trafficking (7Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). PLD, which hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidic acid (PA), is a downstream effector of the small GTP-binding protein ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF-1) (8Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar, 9Cockcroft S. Thomas G.M.H. Fensome A. Geny B. Cunningham E. Gout I. Hiles I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Science. 1994; 263: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) and is present on Golgi membranes (10Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Roth M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4952-4956Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mammalian PLDs also require PIP2 as an essential cofactor for enzymatic activity (11Pertile P. Liscovitch M. Chalifa V. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5130-5135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Activation of PLD by ARF-1 potentiates coatomer (COP-I) binding to Golgi membranes in vitro (12Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Waters M.G. Sternweis P.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that ARF promotes release of nascent secretory vesicles from the TGN and that this occurs via enhancement of PLD activity in the Golgi apparatus (13Chen Y.-G. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5297-5300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar,14Chen Y.G. Siddhanta A. Austin C.D. Hammond S.M. Sung T.C. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Because PA promotes a variety of physiological responses (7Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), it might enhance vesicle budding either by activating a signal transduction pathway or by altering the local charge distribution on the membrane. Another class of enzymes that regulate phosphoinositide synthesis, PI-TPs, also function in the formation and release of secretory vesicles (1De Camilli P. Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P. Science. 1996; 271: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Elegant studies from Bankaitis et al. (15Bankaitis V.A. Malehorn D.E. Emr S.D. Greene R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1271-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) showed that the yeast SEC14 gene, which is essential for viability, encodes a PI-TP that modulates phosphatidylcholine levels in the Golgi apparatus and is required for secretory vesicle formation (16McGee T.P. Skinner H.B. Whitters E.A. Henry S.A. Bankaitis V.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Significantly, a mammalian homologue of Sec14p, as well as the yeast enzyme, promotes the budding of nascent secretory vesicles from the TGN in vitro (17Ohashi M. De Vries K.J. Frank R. Snoek G. Bankaitis V. Wirtz K. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1995; 377: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Recent evidence has shown that defects in sec14 can be bypassed by mutations in the SAC1 gene (18Kearns B.G. McGee T.P. Mayinger P. Gedvilaite A. Phillips S.E. Kagiwada S. Bankaitis V.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Sac1-22 mutants appear to rescue sec14p defects by increasing the levels of DAG in the Golgi apparatus (18Kearns B.G. McGee T.P. Mayinger P. Gedvilaite A. Phillips S.E. Kagiwada S. Bankaitis V.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). To determine whether the production of PA or DAG in the TGN is required for budding of nascent secretory vesicles, we added phospholipid-modifying enzymes (PI-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) and diacylglycerol kinase (DAG K)) to permeabilized rat anterior pituitary GH3 cells. Here we show that in endocrine cells the production of PA rather than DAG enhances vesicle release from the TGN. PI-PLC from Bacillus cereus (∼118 units/ml),Escherichia coli recombinantsn-1,2-diacylglycerol kinase (∼61 units/ml), and the class II diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor (R 59949) were purchased from Calbiochem. Octyl β-glucoside was purchased from Pierce. [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity: 3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Rabbit anti-growth hormone and anti-prolactin sera have been described previously (19Xu H. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1169-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 20Austin C.D. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1471-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Rat anterior pituitary GH3 cells were grown as described previously (19Xu H. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1169-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cells were pulse-labeled with Tran35S-label for 10 min at 37 °C, chased for 2 h at 20 °C, and permeabilized as described (14Chen Y.G. Siddhanta A. Austin C.D. Hammond S.M. Sung T.C. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 19Xu H. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1169-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Control incubations contained ∼5 × 105 permeabilized cells, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 125 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 200 μm GTP, 10 mm creatinine phosphate, 160 μg/ml creatinine phosphate kinase, and 5 μg/ml Trasylol. Incubation for 2 h at 37 °C under these conditions reconstitutes both prohormone processing and nascent secretory vesicle release from the TGN (19Xu H. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1169-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To determine the effects of phospholipid modification on vesicle budding, permeabilized cells were pretreated for 10 min at 4 °C with or without the indicated concentration of PI-PLC and/or DAG kinase and then incubated under vesicle budding conditions. It should be noted that the in vitro reaction conditions for vesicle budding are suboptimal for PI-PLC and DAG kinase activities. The assay for nascent secretory vesicle budding was based on quantitating the release of radiolabeled growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) into a 15,000 × g supernatant following an in vitro incubation (19Xu H. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1169-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 20Austin C.D. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1471-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Following the incubation, permeabilized cells were pelleted and lysed, and the lysates and supernatants containing nascent secretory vesicles were treated sequentially with anti-PRL and anti-GH (20Austin C.D. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1471-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive material was resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by fluorography. Band intensities were quantitated using a computing densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Model 300A) and Image Quant 3.3 software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Non-radioactive permeabilized GH3 cells were incubated under vesicle budding conditions with 30 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP in the presence or absence of PI-PLC, DAG kinase, and the DAG kinase Inhibitor II as indicated. Following incubation, samples were placed on ice, and the lipids were extracted with methanol:chloroform:water (1:1:0.8). After vortex mixing, the organic phase containing phospholipids was separated by centrifugation and dried under vacuum. The dried samples were resuspended in chloroform:methanol (19:1), and the phospholipids were resolved on oxalic acid-impregnated Whatman LK5DF TLC plates (Whatman, Clifton, NJ) by developing with an organic phase consisting of chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water (55:43:3:4) (21Henderson R.J. Tocher D.R. Hamilton R.J. Hamilton S. Lipid Analysis, A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1992: 65-111Google Scholar). Radiolabeled phosphatidic acid was detected by autoradiography, and its identity was confirmed by comparison of its RF value with a phosphatidic acid standard chromatographed on the same plate. Band intensities were quantitated by a computing densitometer, as above. Permeabilized GH3 cells were incubated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP as described above. Following incubation, samples were centrifuged in a Microfuge for 20 s. The pellets were homogenized using a ball bearing homogenizer, and the entire homogenate was loaded on an equilibrium sucrose density gradient designed to separate Golgi membranes from microsomes (19Xu H. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1169-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 20Austin C.D. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1471-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Gradients were centrifuged in a SW41.Ti rotor (Beckman) for 4 h at 39,000 rpm, after which 1-ml fractions were collected. The lipids were extracted from each gradient fraction and analyzed by TLC as described above. In parallel, an aliquot of each gradient fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-TGN38 antibody to identify Golgi membrane fractions enriched in the trans-Golgi network (20Austin C.D. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1471-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Data from several laboratories have demonstrated that ARF-1 stimulates endogenous phospholipase D-1 activity in Golgi membranes (8Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar,10Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Roth M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Most recently, we have shown that addition of exogenous human PLD-1a to a permeabilized cell system derived from growth hormone and prolactin-secreting rat anterior pituitary GH3 cells stimulated release of nascent secretory vesicles from the TGN (14Chen Y.G. Siddhanta A. Austin C.D. Hammond S.M. Sung T.C. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). We postulated that either accumulation of PA in the TGN or metabolites implicated in signal transduction pathways, e.g. DAG, would enhance vesicle release. To determine whether PA or DAG might promote vesicle release, we added phospholipid-hydrolyzing enzymes to permeabilized GH3 cells directly to generate either DAG or PA independently of PLD activity and then analyzed their effects on the budding of nascent secretory vesicles (Fig. 1). As previously demonstrated (14Chen Y.G. Siddhanta A. Austin C.D. Hammond S.M. Sung T.C. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), in the presence of an energy-generating system, vesicle release from the TGN was 25–30% efficient (lanes 3 and 4). Addition of PI-PLC, an enzyme which hydrolyzes PI to DAG, enhanced release of GH- and PRL-containing vesicles from 28% to 40% (compare lanes 3 and 4with 7 and 8) suggesting that accumulation of DAG modulates vesicle budding. However, addition of bacterial DAG kinase, which phosphorylates DAG to generate PA, stimulated vesicle budding to approximately 45% (lanes 11 and 12). Most significantly, addition of PI-PLC together with DAG kinase, an enzyme combination expected to generate significant levels of PA (Fig. 2), stimulated release of nascent secretory vesicles by 100% over the control (Fig. 1 B; compare lanes 5 and 6 with 13 and14). This suggested that production of PA rather than DAG was the significant determinant for vesicle budding. Consistent with a requirement for PA accumulation, addition of a DAG kinase inhibitor reduced this stimulated vesicle budding (Fig. 1 B). Vesicle budding in the presence of PI-PLC and DAG kinase was itself energy-dependent since in the absence of ATP and GTP budding was minimal (compare lanes 1 and 2 with15 and 16). We interpret these results to suggest that the generation of PA in the TGN results in stimulation of nascent secretory vesicle release.Figure 2PA is generated under conditions that promote vesicle budding. Panel A, permeabilized GH3 cells were incubated with 30 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP for 2 h at 37 °C and with the indicated components under vesicle budding conditions. Following incubation, total phospholipids were extracted and the radiolabeled phospholipids were separated by TLC followed by autoradiography. PI-PLC and DAG kinase were each used at a final concentration of 10−2 units/ml. Panel B, quantitation of phosphatidic acid levels during vesicle budding from the TGN.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To test that the combined activities of PI-PLC and DAG kinase increased PA levels, permeabilized cells were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and PI-PLC in the absence or presence of DAG kinase to measure formation of radiolabeled PA (Fig. 2). Addition of either PI-PLC or DAG kinase alone increased the level of PA but only slightly above that of control permeabilized cells (Fig. 2 B). Most significantly, when both enzymes were present at concentrations that resulted in maximal vesicle budding (Fig. 1), PA levels were approximately 4-fold above controls (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 5). It is noteworthy that the level of PA accumulation that correlated with enhanced vesicle budding was similar to that observed for ARF stimulation of Golgi PLD activity (approximately 3-fold (14Chen Y.G. Siddhanta A. Austin C.D. Hammond S.M. Sung T.C. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar)) which also promoted maximal vesicle budding. It was possible that PA accumulated in all membranes possessing PI and would not be enriched in the TGN, the site of vesicle budding. To test this possibility, permeabilized cells were incubated under budding conditions with both enzymes and [γ-32P]ATP. Following incubation, the Golgi membranes were separated from total microsomes by flotation on a sucrose density gradient (19Xu H. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1169-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), total phospholipids were extracted from each fraction, and the level of radiolabeled PA was determined (Fig. 3). As expected, PA was present in the gradient load zone and in the rough microsomes (Fractions 7–10 (Ref. 20Austin C.D. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1471-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)); however significant levels were evident at the top of the gradient where Golgi membranes are enriched (Fractions 2 and 3; Fig. 3, A and C). In the absence of PI-PLC and DAG kinase, there was minimal PA accumulation (Fig. 3 B). These data suggest that the accumulation of PA in Golgi membranes results in enhanced vesicle release from the TGN. We reasoned that the PI concentration in the TGN was likely to be relatively low since PI constitutes only a small fraction of total cellular phospholipids. Consequently, it should be possible to demonstrate a dose-response relationship between PI-PLC and DAG kinase and the extent of vesicle budding (Fig. 4). At low concentrations of both enzymes, there was a linear increase in the level of vesicle budding (Fig. 4 A, compare lanes 1 and 2 with9-12) that reached a plateau at approximately 2-fold enhancement of vesicle release (Fig. 4 B). Consistent with the idea that PI levels might be limiting, addition of increasing enzyme concentrations had no significant effect on vesicle budding from the TGN. In agreement with the data of Fig. 1, addition of maximal concentrations of either PI-PLC or DAG kinase alone stimulated vesicle release but only approximately 30% (Fig. 4 B). Together with the data of Fig. 1, these results suggested that the phosphorylation of DAG by exogenously added DAG kinase promoted vesicle release, presumably as a result of elevated PA levels in the TGN. Previous work from our laboratory showed that PLD-mediated PC hydrolysis increased PA levels and stimulated vesicle release from the TGN (14Chen Y.G. Siddhanta A. Austin C.D. Hammond S.M. Sung T.C. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). However, the observation that S. cerevisiae sac1-22 mutants, which bypass sec14 PI-TP, were found to accumulate DAG in the Golgi apparatus (18Kearns B.G. McGee T.P. Mayinger P. Gedvilaite A. Phillips S.E. Kagiwada S. Bankaitis V.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) prompted us to test whether PA or DAG levels regulate vesicle budding from the TGN. The data presented here suggest that in mammalian endocrine cells accumulation of PA rather than DAG is required for secretory vesicle release from the TGN. A possible explanation for the difference between our results and those of Kearns et al. (18Kearns B.G. McGee T.P. Mayinger P. Gedvilaite A. Phillips S.E. Kagiwada S. Bankaitis V.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) might be related to the amount of DAG in sac1-22 mutant yeast, which is 3- to 6-fold above wild type levels. A small fraction of this pool could be converted to PA via endogenous DAG kinase, thereby restoring vesicle formation. The observation that overexpression of bacterial DAG kinase in the sac1-22 background exacerbated the sec14 phenotype (18Kearns B.G. McGee T.P. Mayinger P. Gedvilaite A. Phillips S.E. Kagiwada S. Bankaitis V.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) could result from highly elevated PA levels in all organelles, presumably this would be toxic to the cell. It is also possible that yeast and mammalian cells may utilize different phospholipids to generate secretory vesicles. Several hypotheses might explain how PA accumulation enhances vesicle budding. As suggested originally (22Herman P.K. Stack J.H. Emr S.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 363-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) to explain the requirement for VPS34p activity in vesicle transport from the late Golgi apparatus to the yeast vacuole, the accumulation of transient, local, high concentrations of negatively charged lipids in the outer lipid bilayer could either promote specific coat protein recruitment or itself induce changes in the curvature of the membrane leading to vesicle formation. Similarly the accumulation of negatively charged PA in the outer leaflet of the membrane bilayer could cause vesicle budding by a similar mechanism. In support of the former idea, Ktistakis et al. (12Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Waters M.G. Sternweis P.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the β-COP subunit of coatomer binds to PA-containing liposomes about 5- to 7-fold more efficiently than to those lacking this phospholipid; interestingly, when PIP2 was also present, coat binding was even more efficient. An alternate possibility is that, since PA has been shown to stimulate the activity of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase, a soluble enzyme (23Jenkins G.H. Fisette P.L. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11547-11554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the final step of the PIP2 biosynthetic pathway, PIP2 production could promote coat binding to the membrane. Consistent with this possibility, recent data from Tüscher et al.(24Tüscher O. Lorra C. Bouma B. Wirtz K.W.A. Huttner W.B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) showed that PI-TP and bacterial PLD synergize in promoting vesicle budding; however, addition of geneticin, an aminoglycoside that binds PIP2, inhibited the stimulation of vesicle budding. Because the bacterial PLD is resistant to geneticin and unlike mammalian enzymes does not require PIP2 for activity, this suggests that PIP2 might be essential for vesicle budding. Several enzymes, some of which possess pleckstrin homology domains, bind PIP2 and are involved in vesicle trafficking. For example, PIP2 is an essential cofactor for PLD activity (11Pertile P. Liscovitch M. Chalifa V. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5130-5135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), it enhances the GDP-GTP exchange activity of the ARF-guanine exchange factor (ARNO) (25Chardin P. Paris S. Antonny B. Robineau S. Beraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L. Chabre M. Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), plays a key step in the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane (5Martin T.F.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 271-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and regulates dynamin recruitment to membranes and dynamin GTPase activity via interaction with its pleckstrin homology domain (6Salim K. Bottomley M.J. Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I. Scaife R. Margolis R.L. Gigg R. Smith C.I.E. Driscoll P.C. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6241-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The recent demonstration that dynamin-II is Golgi-associated and is required for constitutive secretory vesicle budding (26Jones S.M. Howell K.E. Henley J.R. Cao H. McNiven M.A. Science. 1998; 279: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) is consistent with this idea and may indicate that PIP2 is a key regulator of the exocytic vesicle budding machinery. We speculate that both PA and PIP2 synthesis are part of a feedback mechanism to regulate the recruitment of proteins involved in Golgi vesicle budding. We thank Dr. Sharon Milgram for anti-TGN38 serum and Dr. Duncan Wilson for very helpful suggestions and discussions."
https://openalex.org/W1999843107,"Due to its potent effect on fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) seems to play an important role in the pathogenesis of fibrotic disease. Since glucocorticoids are frequently used for the therapy of these disorders, we determined a potential effect of these steroids on CTGF expression. In cultured fibroblasts, a striking induction of CTGF expression was observed after dexamethasone treatment and occurred in a time- and dose-dependent manner. This effect was obviously not mediated by the CTGF inducer transforming growth factor-beta1, since expression of this factor was down-regulated by the glucocorticoid. Most importantly, CTGF expression levels also increased substantially in various tissues and organs by systemic glucocorticoid treatment of mice. After cutaneous injury, a strong induction of CTGF expression was seen in the wounds of nontreated mice. However, no further increase in the levels of CTGF mRNA occurred in wounded skin compared with unwounded skin of glucocorticoid-treated animals, suggesting the presence of other factors in the wound that might compensate for the effect of the steroids. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha was identified as a possible mediator of this effect because this factor suppressed CTGF expression in cultured fibroblasts and also blocked the glucocorticoid-induced CTGF production by these cells. These findings indicate that glucocorticoids stimulate CTGF expression in normal tissues and organs but not in highly inflamed areas."

Recently, two novel phosphoinositides, phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns-3,5-P2) and phosphatidylinositol- 5-phosphate (PtdIns-5-P), have been shown to exist in cells. PtdIns-3,5-P2, which is regulated by osmotic stress, appears to be synthesized by phosphorylation of PtdIns-3-P at the D-5 position. No evidence yet exists for how PtdIns-5-P is produced in cells. Understanding the regulation of synthesis of these molecules will be important for identifying their function in cellular signaling. To determine the pathway by which PtdIns-3,5-P2 and Ptd-Ins-5-P might be synthesized, we tested the ability of the recently cloned type I PtdIns-4-P 5-kinases (PIP5Ks) α and β to phosphorylate PtdIns-3-P and PtdIns at the D-5 position of the inositol ring. We found that the type I PIP5Ks phosphorylate PtdIns-3-P to form PtdIns-3,5-P2. The identity of the PtdIns-3,5-P2 product was determined by anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography analysis and periodate treatment. PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 were also produced from PtdIns-3-P phosphorylation by both isoforms. When expressed in mammalian cells, PIP5K Iα and PIP5K Iβ differed in their ability to synthesize PtdIns-3,5-P2 relative to PtdIns-3,4-P2. We also found that the type I PIP5Ks phosphorylate PtdIns to produce PtdIns-5-P and phosphorylate PtdIns-3,4-P2 to produce PtdIns-3,4,5-P3. Our findings suggest that type I PIP5Ks synthesize the novel phospholipids PtdIns-3,5-P2 and PtdIns-5-P.

Although this work also provided evidence for the existence of PtdIns-5-P in cells, it remains unclear how this lipid is synthesized. The D-3 phosphoinositides, PtdIns-3-P, PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 also have distinct roles in cellular signaling. PtdIns-3-P, which is present constitutively in cells, plays a role in Golgi to vacuole trafficking in yeast (17Schu P.V. Takegawa K. Fry M.J. Stack J.H. Waterfield M.D. Emr S.D.

Brearley C.A. Ulug E.T. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 32Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Douglas M.R. Sayers L.G. Parker P.J. Michell R.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The specific activity data and the fact that PtdInsP3 is absent in cells under conditions where PtdIns-3,5-P2 is found argue that a phosphatase is unlikely to be involved in PtdIns-3,5-P2 synthesis. The only known kinases that phosphorylate the D-5 position of the inositol ring are the type I PIP5Ks. As mentioned previously, the type II PIPKs have recently been demonstrated to phosphorylate the D-4 position of the inositol ring (16Rameh L.E. Tolias K.T. Duckworth B. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). While the function of PtdIns-3,5-P2 in the cell is unknown, we were interested in the pathway by which it is synthesized and tested whether type I PIP5Ks can phosphorylate the D-5 position of PtdIns-3-P to form PtdIns-3,5-P2. We find that type I PIP5Ks do phosphorylate PtdIns-3-P at the D-5 position. We also find that these kinases can produce PtdIns-5-P from PtdIns and can synthesize PtdInsP3from either PtdIns-3-P or PtdIns-3,4-P2. PtdIns and PtdIns-4-P were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. and Sigma, respectively. Synthetic dipalmitoyl PtdIns-3-P, PtdIns-3,4-P2, and PtdIns-3,5-P2were synthesized as described (34Thum O. Chen J. Prestwich G.D. Tetrahedron Lett. 1996; 37: 9017-9020Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). 2J. Chen, L. Feng, and G. D. Prestwich, manuscript in preparation. [3H]PtdIns-4-P, [3H]PtdIns-4,5-P2, [3H]Ins-1,3,4-P3, [3H]Ins-1,4,5-P3, and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. LipofectAMINE and Opti-MEM were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. All other chemicals were from Sigma. N-terminal HA-tagged murine cDNAs of type I PIP5K α and β in pBluescript were generated as described previously (5Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Kizuki N. Katagiri H. Yazaki Y. Asano T. Oka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23611-23614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The cDNAs of the PIP5Ks lacking the HA-tag were subcloned into the SalI and NotI sites of the bacterial expression vector pGEX4T. HA-tagged type I PIP5K cDNAs were also subcloned into the ClaI and NotI sites of the mammalian expression vector pEBB (provided by B. J. Mayer). The mutations PIPKIα D227A and PIPKIβ D268A were generated using theCLONTECH Transformer Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit. Glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins of the type I PIP5Ks were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads as described previously (15Tolias K.F. Couvillon A.D. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 762-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Proteins were eluted from glutathione-Sepharose beads with 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 20 mmreduced glutathione and then concentrated in a Centricon filter after several washes with buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol). Glycerol was added to the proteins before storing at −80 °C. 293 E1A cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified medium containing 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE using 4 μg of HA-tagged PIP5Ks per 10-cm plate. Cells were harvested 18 h after transfection. Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in 600 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 μg/ml each leupeptin and pepstatin, and 200 μm AEBSF). The clarified lysates were incubated with 1.5 μg of an anti-HA antibody (12CA5 from Boehringer Mannheim) and protein A-Sepharose beads for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with TNM (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2). PIP5Ks were assayed in 50-μl reactions containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 30 mm NaCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 67 μm lipid substrate, 133 μm phosphoserine, and 50 μm[γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi/assay). When PtdIns was used as the lipid substrate, no carrier lipid was used, and when [32P]PtdIns-3-P was used as substrate, unlabeled ATP was used in place of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were stopped after 10 min by adding 80 μl of 1 n HCl and then 160 μl of CHCl3:MeOH (1:1). Lipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using 1-propanol, 2 m acetic acid (65:35, v/v). Phosphorylated lipids were visualized by autoradiography and quantified using a Bio-Rad Molecular Analyst. The PtdIns used in all experiments was separated from contaminating phosphoinositides by TLC purification using CHCl3:MeOH:H2O:NH4OH (60:47:11:1.6). After identification using an iodine-stained Ptd-Ins standard, the PtdIns was scraped from the TLC plate and eluted in the same solvent solution. Following lyophilization, PtdIns was resuspended in chloroform and then extracted once with MeOH, 1n HCl (1:1) and once with MeOH, 0.1 m EDTA (1:0.9). [32P]PtdIns-3-P and [32P]PtdInsP3 were generated by incubating recombinant Sf9 cell-expressed PI3K with 500 μm[γ-32P]ATP (50 μCi/assay), 10 mmMgCl2, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, and 1 mm PtdIns or PtdIns-4,5-P2, respectively, for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with 1 mm EDTA and 50 μl of 3 n HCl, and the lipids were extracted with 200 μl of CHCl3:MeOH (1:1). Kinetic analysis of the bacterially expressed PIP5K enzymes was performed using 1–100 μm of the phospholipid substrates and 0.64 μg of PIP5K Iα or 0.08 μg of PIP5K Iβ in reactions allowed to proceed for 1 or 4 min, respectively. Deacylated lipids were mixed with3H-labeled standards and analyzed by anion-exchange high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Partisphere SAX column (Whatman) as described previously (35Serunian L.A. Auger K.R. Cantley L.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To separate PtdIns-4-P from PtdIns-5-P and PtdIns-3,4-P2 from PtdIns-3,5-P2, a modified ammonium phosphate gradient was used. The compounds were eluted with 1 m(NH4)2HPO4, pH 3.8, and water using the following gradient: 0% 1 m(NH4)2HPO4 for 5 ml, 0 to 1% 1m (NH4)2HPO4 over 5 ml, 1 to 3% 1 m (NH4)2HPO4over 40 ml, 3 to 10% 1 m(NH4)2HPO4 over 10 ml, 10 to 13% 1m (NH4)2HPO4 over 25 ml, and 13 to 65% 1 m(NH4)2HPO4 over 25 ml. Eluate from the HPLC column flowed into an on-line continuous flow scintillation detector (Radiomatic Instruments, FL) for isotope detection. Periodate oxidation was performed as described with the following modifications (36Stephens L. Hawkins P.T. Carter N. Chahwala S.B. Morris A.J. Whetton A.D. Downes P.C. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Deacylated lipids were incubated in the dark at 25 °C with 10 or 100 mmperiodic acid, pH 4.5, for 30 min or 36 h, respectively. The remaining oxidizing reagent was removed by adding 500 mmethylene glycol and incubating the reaction in the dark for 30 min. 2% 1,1-dimethylhydrazine, pH 4.5, was then added to a final concentration of 1% and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 4 h at 25 °C. The mixture was then purified by ion exchange using a Dowex 50W-X8 cation-exchange resin (20–50 mesh, acidic form), dried, and applied to an HPLC column. PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 controls used in this experiment were prepared using recombinant Sf9 cell-expressed PI3K. The recent description of the presence of PtdIns-3,5-P2 in fibroblasts rekindled our interest in this phosphoinositide and how it is produced. Since it was recently shown that type II PIPK phosphorylates the D-4 position of PtdIns-5-P (16Rameh L.E. Tolias K.T. Duckworth B. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), the synthesis of PtdIns-3,5-P2 must either be catalyzed by a type I PIP5K, a phosphatase, or a new enzyme. To further define the substrates and products of the type I PIP5Ks, we provided PtdIns, PtdIns-3-P, PtdIns-4-P, PtdIns-3,4-P2, and PtdIns-3,5-P2 as substrates and analyzed the products. As our enzyme source, we used recombinant PIP5Ks Iα and PIP5K Iβ (according to the nomenclature proposed by Ishihara et al.(5Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Kizuki N. Katagiri H. Yazaki Y. Asano T. Oka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23611-23614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar)) that were produced as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in bacteria. The products of the phosphorylation reactions were analyzed by TLC using a system that separates PtdInsP, Ptd-InsP2, and PtdInsP3, and visualized using a Molecular Analyst. As expected, the type I PIP5Ks converted PtdIns-4-P to PtdInsP2 (Fig. 1) (4Loijens J.C. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32937-32943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 5Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Kizuki N. Katagiri H. Yazaki Y. Asano T. Oka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23611-23614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the enzymes were also capable of synthesizing other lipid products. Both PIP5K Iα and PIP5K Iβ phosphorylated PtdIns-3,4-P2 to produce Ptd-InsP3 and phosphorylated PtdIns-3-P to produce PtdInsP2 and PtdInsP3 (Fig. 1). PtdIns was also converted to PtdInsP and PtdInsP2 by the type I PIP5Ks (although bacterially expressed PIP5K Iβ was more active than PIP5K Iα at phosphorylating PtdIns). In contrast, PtdIns-3,5-P2 was a poor substrate for both enzymes (1/5 as good as PtdIns-3,4-P2). The PtdInsP2 produced in the reactions using PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,5-P2 as substrate most likely resulted from a contaminant in either the synthetic lipid substrates (which were judged to be greater than 99% pure based on 1H and31P NMR) or in the carrier lipid phosphoserine. The kinase-dead PIP5K mutants, PIP5K Iα D227A and PIP5K Iβ D268A, did not catalyze the phosphorylation of any lipids, as expected (data not shown). To determine the identity of the products, they were deacylated and analyzed by anion exchange chromatography using HPLC. As expected from previous studies (4Loijens J.C. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32937-32943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 5Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Kizuki N. Katagiri H. Yazaki Y. Asano T. Oka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23611-23614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), the PtdInsP2 produced using PtdIns-4-P as a substrate for either enzyme was exclusively PtdIns-4,5-P2(not shown). The product of PtdIns-3,4-P2 phosphorylation by either enzyme was confirmed to be PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, in agreement with a recent study by Zhang et al. (Fig. 2 B) (33Zhang X. Loijens J.C. Boronenkov I.V. Parker G.J. Norris F.A. Chen J. Thum O. Prestwich G.D. Majerus P.W. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17756-17761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the findings of Zhang et al. (33Zhang X. Loijens J.C. Boronenkov I.V. Parker G.J. Norris F.A. Chen J. Thum O. Prestwich G.D. Majerus P.W. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17756-17761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), the deacylated PtdInsP2 produced by phosphorylation of synthetic PtdIns-3-P with either type I isoenzyme was resolved into two peaks by HPLC analysis (75.5 and 77 min, Fig. 2 A). The peak at 77 min comigrated with the glycerophosphorylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (GroPIns-3,4-P2) standard while the peak at 75.5 min migrated at the position expected for GroPIns-3,5-P2 (31Whiteford C.C. Brearley C.A. Ulug E.T. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar,32Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Douglas M.R. Sayers L.G. Parker P.J. Michell R.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Zhang et al. (33Zhang X. Loijens J.C. Boronenkov I.V. Parker G.J. Norris F.A. Chen J. Thum O. Prestwich G.D. Majerus P.W. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17756-17761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) did not detect a second peak corresponding to GroPIns-3,5-P2 when analyzing the reaction products of the phosphorylation of PtdIns-3-P by type I PIP5Ks. The best explanation for this discrepancy is that the anion exchange HPLC analysis done by Zhang et al. (33Zhang X. Loijens J.C. Boronenkov I.V. Parker G.J. Norris F.A. Chen J. Thum O. Prestwich G.D. Majerus P.W. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17756-17761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) did not separate GroPIns-3,4-P2 from GroPIns-3,5-P2. We also detected two additional peaks in the reaction products of PtdIns-3-P phosphorylation by type I PIP5Ks (Fig. 2 A). The peak at 98 min eluted at the known position for GroPIns-3,4,5-P3 (Fig. 2 A). The peak at 95 min (×) was not identified. To demonstrate that the PIP5K Iβ products shown in Fig. 2 Awere synthesized from the phosphorylation of PtdIns-3-P and not a contaminating lipid, we analyzed the ability of the type I PIP5Ks to phosphorylate [32P]PtdIns-3-P which was enzymaticaly produced by PI3K. Bacterially expressed PIP5K Iβ was incubated with [32P]PtdIns-3-P and unlabeled ATP for 10 min at room temperature. The lipid products were then extracted and analyzed. We found that PIP5K Iβ converted [32P]PtdIns-3-P to [32P]PtdIns-3,5-P2, [32P]PtdIns-3,4-P2, and [32P]PtdInsP3 (Fig. 3). Although the major PtdInsP2product from the phosphorylation of PtdIns-3-P by type I PIP5Ks appeared to be PtdIns-3,5-P2 based on its migration position, we further investigated its identity using periodate. Since this lipid was not PtdIns-3,4-P2 or PtdIns-4,5-P2, it could only be PtdIns-3,5-P2, PtdIns-2,3-P2, or PtdIns-3,6-P2. The latter two products have never been described as existing in vivo, but can be distinguished from PtdIns-3,5-P2 by their sensitivity to periodate treatment. Of this group, only PtdIns-3,5-P2 lacks a viscinal diol for periodate attack of the inositol ring and is therefore resistant to cleavage. We treated the products of PtdIns-3-P phosphorylation with periodate. GroPIns-3,4-P2 (which is sensitive to periodate) and GroPIns-3,4,5-P3 (which is resistant to periodate) were also treated as controls. The reaction products were analyzed by anion exchange chromatography using an HPLC. Short periodate treatment (30 min) resulted in the conversion of the GroPIns-3,4-P2 and GroPIns-3,5-P2 products to InsP3 and the GroPInsP3 product to InsP4 due to cleavage of the glycerol moiety (Fig. 4 A). Since PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 lacks a viscinal diol and is therefore resistant to periodate cleavage (Fig. 4, E andF), we used the InsP4 derived from the PtdInsP3 present in our sample as an internal control for yield after prolonged periodate treatment (36 h). Prolonged periodate treatment resulted in the loss of 50% of InsP4 (Fig. 4 B). Similar treatment of Ins-1,3,4-P3 resulted in almost complete loss of radiolabeled material (3% remaining) at the position of Ins-1,3,4-P3 (Fig. 4, C andD). However, under the same conditions, approximately 30% of the GroPInsP2 product of the type I PIP5K β was recovered at the position expected for Ins-1,3,5-P3 (Fig. 4 B). When corrected for the reaction yield based on the treatment of PtdInsP3, 60% of the InsP3product was resistant to periodate. Similar results were obtained with the PtdIns-3-P phosphorylation products of PIP5K Iα. These results, in agreement with those in Figs. 2 A and 3, indicate that the majority of the PtdInsP2 produced by the Type I PIP5Ks is PtdIns-3,5-P2. Synthesis of either PtdIns-3,4-P2 or PtdIns-3,5-P2 in our in vitro assays could have resulted from the dephosphorylation of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 by a contaminating phosphatase. To investigate this possibility we provided [32P]PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 labeled at the D-3 position by PI3K to both the α- and β-isoforms of type I PIP5K and analyzed the products. We found no [32P]PtdInsP2 produced when the type I PIP5Ks were incubated with [32P]PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (not shown). These results suggest that the type I PIP5Ks can phosphorylate the D-4 or the D-5 position of PtdIns-3-P, and that with relatively high frequency both sites become phosphorylated in a concerted fashion. The product of the reaction using PtdIns as substrate was also identified by deacylation and HPLC chromatography. As shown in Fig. 5, deacylated PtdInsP produced using TLC purified PtdIns as the substrate for the E. coli-expressed PIP5K Iβ enzyme migrates distinctly from GroPIns-3-P or GroPIns-4-P at the position of GroPIns-5-P (16Rameh L.E. Tolias K.T. Duckworth B. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained using bacterially expressed PIP5K Iα as the enzyme source (data not shown). PtdIns-5-P has been found in cells (16Rameh L.E. Tolias K.T. Duckworth B. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), and this result suggests that it could be synthesized by type I PIP5Ks. A small amount of PtdInsP2, which was identified as PtdIns-4,5-P2, was also produced using PtdIns as substrate (not shown). Since the PtdIns used in this experiment was TLC purified to eliminate the possibility that PtdIns-4-P was present as a contaminant, this result suggests that type I PIP5Ks can phosphorylate both the D-4 and D-5 positions of the inositol ring. However, given that PtdIns-5-P is a poor substrate for type I PIP5Ks (16Rameh L.E. Tolias K.T. Duckworth B. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), it is likely that the type I PIP5Ks only synthesize PtdIns-4,5-P2 from PtdIns in a concerted reaction at a low rate. To investigate the relative substrate preferences, we determined the apparentKm, V max andV max/Km ratio for the various substrates of the bacterially expressed type I PIP5Ks. As expected, PtdIns-4-P was the favored substrate of both the α- and β-isoforms. Bacterially expressed PIP5K Iα, which was significantly less active than PIP5K Iβ, did not efficiently phosphorylate the other phosphoinositides tested. In contrast, PIP5K Iβ phosphorylated PtdIns-3-P about one-sixth as well as PtdIns-4,5-P2(V max/Km ratio of 92 pmol/min/mg compared with 564 pmol/min/mg). Given the high ratio of PtdIns-4-P to PtdIns-3-P in mammalian cells (approximately 20:1), it is likely that PtdIns-4-P is the major in vivo substrate. However, it is certainly possible that the type I PIP5Ks account for the small amount of PtdIns-3,5-P2 observed in vivo (approximately 1% of PtdIns-4,5-P2) via phosphorylation of PtdIns-3-P at the D-5 position. The experiments presented above were performed using enzymes that were expressed in bacteria. To determine whether type I PIP5Ks expressed in mammalian cells have the same properties, we repeated experiments with HA-tagged PIP5K Iα and PIP5K Iβ produced in 293 E1A cells. Proteins were immunoprecipitated and then assayed for their ability to phosphorylate PtdIns-3-P, PtdIns-3,4-P2, and PtdIns. The products of the reactions were deacylated and analyzed by HPLC. The PIP5Ks expressed in 293 cells were both quite active, in contrast to the bacterially produced enzymes where PIP5K Iβ was significantly more active than PIP5K Iα. Both mammalian expressed type I PIP5K isoforms were able to phosphorylate PtdIns-3-P to produce PtdIns-3,5-P2, PtdIns-3,4-P2, and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (Fig. 6, A and D). They were also able to phosphorylate PtdIns-3,4-P2 to produce PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (Fig. 6, B and E), and PtdIns to produce PtdIns-5-P (Fig. 6, C andF). In contrast to the bacterially expressed enzymes, however, the mammalian expressed PIP5Ks differed in their ability to synthesize PtdIns-3,5-P2 relative to PtdIns-3,4-P2. When PIP5K Iα phosphorylated Ptd-Ins-3-P, it produced more PtdIns-3,5-P2 than PtdIns-3,4-P2 (Fig. 6 B), whereas PIP5K Iβ produced equal or more PtdIns-3,4-P2 than PtdIns-3,5-P2 (Fig. 6 E). It is unclear whether this difference between PIP5K Iα and PIP5K Iβ is the result of PIP5K Iα being more efficient at synthesizing PtdIns-3,5-P2 or less efficient at producing PtdIns-3,4-P2. We have found that the type I PIP5Ks can synthesize the novel phospholipids PtdIns-3,5-P2 and PtdIns-5-P by phosphorylating PtdIns-3-P and PtdIns, respectively. Our results suggest a potential pathway for PtdIns-3,5-P2 and PtdIns-5-P synthesis in vivo. We also find, in agreement with a recent report from Zhang et al. (33Zhang X. Loijens J.C. Boronenkov I.V. Parker G.J. Norris F.A. Chen J. Thum O. Prestwich G.D. Majerus P.W. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17756-17761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), that the type I PIP5Ks can phosphorylate PtdIns-3-P and PtdIns-3,4-P2 to produce the important signaling molecules PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3. Taken together, our results demonstrate that in addition to their well established role of synthesizing PtdIns-4,5-P2, the type I PIP5Ks have the in vivo potential to synthesize the following four phosphoinositides: PtdIns-3,5-P2, PtdIns-3,4-P2, PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, and PtdIns-5-P. Since each of these phospholipids is likely to have distinct roles in signaling, the type I PIP5Ks may participate in a variety of cellular processes. The existence of PtdIns-3,5-P2 has only recently been verified in yeast, mammalian, and plant cells (31Whiteford C.C. Brearley C.A. Ulug E.T. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 32Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Douglas M.R. Sayers L.G. Parker P.J. Michell R.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Although present in resting cells, the level of this lipid appears to be regulated by osmotic strength changes (32Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Douglas M.R. Sayers L.G. Parker P.J. Michell R.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Since PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 is absent in the cells in which PtdIns-3,5-P2 is found, PtdIns-3,5-P2 is unlikely to be produced by a phosphatase. Analysis of the specific activity of the D-3 and D-5 phosphates indicates that PtdIns-3,5-P2 is synthesized primarily by phosphorylation of PtdIns-3-P at the D-5 position (31Whiteford C.C. Brearley C.A. Ulug E.T. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 32Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Douglas M.R. Sayers L.G. Parker P.J. Michell R.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). We propose that the type I PIP5Ks are the kinases responsible for catalyzing this reactionin vivo. Given that the level of PtdIns-3,5-P2is regulated by osmotic strength, it will be interesting to determine whether the activity of the type I PIP5Ks is altered upon changes in osmotic pressure. PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 is primarily thought to be synthesized by the phosphorylation of PtdIns-4,5-P2 on the D-3 position of the inositol ring by PI3K. Our results suggest an alternative synthetic pathway in which PI3K provides the initial substrate PtdIns-3-P by phosphorylating PtdIns on the D-3 position. Ptd-Ins-3-P is then phosphorylated by the type I PIP5Ks on the D-4 position to produce PtdIns-3,4-P2 and then the D-5 position to produce PtdIns-3,4,5-P3. PtdIns-3,5-P2 is less likely to be an intermediate in the synthesis of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3since it is a rather poor substrate for type I PIP5Ks. Evidence for this pathway is provided by studies in platelets which demonstrated that PtdIns is first phosphorylated on the D-3 position to produce PtdIns-3-P, followed by the phosphorylation of the D-4 position to form PtdIns-3,4-P2 (27Yamamoto K. Graziani A. Carpenter C. Cantley L.C. Lapetina E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22086-22089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Cunningham T.W. Lips D.L. Bansal V.S. Caldwell K.K.

Chem. 1990; 265: 5345-5348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The type I PIP5Ks appear to be dual specificity kinases since they phosphorylate both the D-4 and D-5 positions of the inositol ring. However, while PtdIns-5-P is produced when PtdIns is used as a substrate for type I PIP5Ks, no PtdIns-4-P is detected. Similarly, PtdIns-3,5-P2 is a poor substrate compared with PtdIns-3,4-P2 for type I PIP5Ks. Therefore, the ability of type I PIP5Ks to phosphorylate the D-4 position of the inositol ring is primarily restricted to the substrate PtdIns-3-P. In general, the type I PIP5Ks favor phosphorylating the D-5 position of the inositol ring, whereas the type II PIPKs favor the D-4 position (16Rameh L.E. Tolias K.T. Duckworth B. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The proof of the existence of PtdIns-3,5-P2 and PtdIns-5-P in cells and the finding that the type I PIP5Ks can synthesize these products in vitro increases the complexity of phosphoinositide signaling. The challenge remains to understand the function of the various phosphoinositides and the regulation of their synthesis and degradation. It will be interesting to determine whether extracellular signals that activate growth factor receptors and/or proteins known to interact with type I PIP5Ks such as Rho family small GTP-binding proteins (13Tolias K.F.

Cotransfection of SFV replicon and helper vectors generated viral titers of around 106 infectious particles/ml. A single electroporation, plated on one 10-cm plate, generated enough virus (107particles) to produce >500 μg of protein.

The new SFV vectors significantly enhance the utility of this expression system. A fundamental technique in both basic and applied molecular biology is the production of heterologous proteins. Bacterial systems are widely utilized, but are hampered by the inability to modify eukaryotic proteins appropriately. In addition, eukaryotic cells have evolved specific mechanisms, which are lacking in bacteria, to fold multidomain proteins (1Netzer W.J. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1997; 388: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Bacterial hosts, therefore, are considerably less efficient at producing well folded, soluble, biochemically active protein than mammalian cells. Gene expression in mammalian culture is impeded by poor transfection efficiency, limited host cell range, and the complexity of the expression system. Recombinant viruses are the most efficient tools for protein production in higher eukaryotic cells. Baculovirus vectors can produce large amounts of heterologous protein, but utilize insect host cells, which have been shown to glycosylate proteins differently than mammalian cells. The baculovirus and vaccinia systems require screening of viruses generated by homologous recombination (2Jones I. Morikawa Y. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1996; 7: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 3Moss B. Science. 1991; 252: 1662-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), which can be time-consuming, especially if large numbers of genetic mutants are required. To overcome these obstacles, alphavirus vectors have emerged as useful tools in heterologous protein production. The Sindbis virus and Semliki Forest virus (SFV), 1The abbreviations used are: SFV, Semliki Forest virus; nsP, non-structural protein; sP, structural protein; re-RNA, replicon RNA; RPV, replication proficient virus; CMV IE, cytomegalovirus immediate early; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside; PAM, plaque assay medium; PFU, plaque-forming unit; RSV LTR, Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; BHK, baby hamster kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FBS, fetal bovine serum; F, farad(s); kb, kilobase pair(s); IMDM, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium; ONPG,O-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. 1The abbreviations used are: SFV, Semliki Forest virus; nsP, non-structural protein; sP, structural protein; re-RNA, replicon RNA; RPV, replication proficient virus; CMV IE, cytomegalovirus immediate early; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside; PAM, plaque assay medium; PFU, plaque-forming unit; RSV LTR, Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; BHK, baby hamster kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FBS, fetal bovine serum; F, farad(s); kb, kilobase pair(s); IMDM, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium; ONPG,O-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. members of the Togaviridae family, are the best studied alphaviruses (4Strauss J.H. Strauss E.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 491-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both have been harnessed into gene expression systems because of their self-amplifying genomes that require only the host translational machinery to replicate (5Liljestrom P. Garoff H. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.D. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Boston1994: 16.20.1-16.20.16Google Scholar, 6Frolov I. Schlesinger S. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 8111-8117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In its normal replication cycle, SFV infects the cell and replication commences with translation of the 5′ two-thirds of the positive-sense genomic RNA into a polyprotein, with subsequent autoproteolytic cleavage into four non-structural proteins (nsPs), nsP1 to nsP4, forming an RNA replicase (Fig. 1 A). This complex targets a replication sequence at the 3′ end of the RNA genome, and replicates full-length (−)-strand RNA from (+)-strand genomic RNA and vice versa. The structural proteins (sPs) required for a mature virion are encoded by the last one-third of the SFV genome (Fig. 1 A). This region is transcribed into a sub-genomic message by the SFV replicase, and translated into a polyprotein that is autoproteolytically cleaved, producing the capsid protein and two envelope glycoproteins (Fig. 1 A). The capsid protein recognizes a packaging signal buried in the coding region for nsP2 and, together with the full-length RNA, forms a nucleocapsid (7Jalanko A. Soderlund H. Virology. 1985; 141: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 8Thomson M. Dimmock N.J. Virology. 1994; 199: 354-365Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 9Frolova E. Frolov I. Schlesinger S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 248-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This structure interacts with the envelope proteins' cytoplasmic domains and buds from the plasma membrane to form a mature, infectious virus. The original SFV expression system employs a plasmid in which the SP6 RNA polymerase promoter lies upstream of the cDNA version of the SFV genome, modified such that the sP coding region has been replaced by the gene of interest (lacZ in Fig. 1, B andC). “Replicon” RNA (re-RNA) is transcribed and cappedin vitro, and transfected into mammalian cells where it is amplified. Large amounts of target protein are generated from the subgenomic message. Infectious particles carrying re-RNA can be generated in vivo by cotransfection of “helper RNA” (5Liljestrom P. Garoff H. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.D. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Boston1994: 16.20.1-16.20.16Google Scholar,10Liljestrom P. Garoff H. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Helper RNA encodes the viral structural proteins found in the wild type SFV, but lacks the packaging signal (Ψ) found in the nsP2 open reading frame. As a result, only re-RNA is packaged within a wild type viral coat, generating a recombinant virus that is capable of one round of infection. Several features of the SFV have made it a useful vector for the expression of foreign genes. First, and in contrast to baculovirus, SFV will infect almost any mammalian cell. Second, it is possible to generate reasonable amounts of protein simply by transfecting re-RNA (10Liljestrom P. Garoff H. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). This approach avoids generating any virus; however, it is limited by transfection efficiency and requires large amounts of RNA. Third, virus can be produced quickly and efficiently in 2 days (10Liljestrom P. Garoff H. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar), which makes it the fastest system available. Fourth, amplification by SFV replicase is so efficient that the level of target protein can reach up to 25% of total cellular protein (10Liljestrom P. Garoff H. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Finally, mutations within the glycoprotein gene p62 (Fig. 1 A) prevent infection unless the virus is proteolytically treated with α-chymotrypsin (11Berglund P. Sjoberg M. Garoff H. Atkins G.J. Sheahan B.J. Liljestrom P. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 916-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). This safeguard feature significantly decreases the likelihood of generating replication proficient virus (RPV) since two events would be required; recombination between re-RNA and helper RNA, and reversion or suppression of the conditional mutation. SFV vectors have been used to generate several recombinant proteins (see, for example, Refs. 10Liljestrom P. Garoff H. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 12Cook D.G. Sung J.C. Golde T.E. Felsenstein K.M. Wojczyk B.S. Tanzi R.E. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Doms R.W. Proc.

Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), to produce hybrid viruses (15Rolls M.M. Webster P. Balba N.H. Rose J.K. Cell. 1994; 79: 497-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 16Li K.J. Garoff H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11658-11663Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and to study aspects of the SFV life cycle. The original SFV expression system (Fig. 1 B) is hampered by the necessity to generate capped RNA transcripts in vitroand requires specialized conditions for RNA handling. To overcome these obstacles, we constructed a DNA-based self-amplifying SFV vector by replacing the SP6 promoter used in the original system with the RNA polymerase II-dependent cytomegalovirus immediate early (CMV IE) enhancer/promoter, which drives transcription in vivo (Fig. 1 B). Transfection of this vector into BHK cells generated high levels of protein (20–30 pg/cell), production of which was dependent on a functional SFV polymerase. To complete the DNA-based expression system, a helper plasmid was constructed that encodes SFV sPs. Cotransfection of replicon and helper plasmids generated conditionally infectious virus capable of producing protein at the same high yield as virus generated by the RNA approach. No RPV was detected in several recombinant SFV virus preparations, a distinct advantage over a DNA-based Sindbis system reported previously (17Dubensky T.W.J. Driver D.A. Polo J.M. Belli B.A. Latham E.M. Ibanez C.E. Chada S. Brumm D. Banks T.A. Mento S.J. Jolly D.J. Chang S.M.W. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 508-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pSCAβ was built in three stages. (i) The SV40 polyadenylation signal was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using SVhRB (18Bremner R. Cohen B.L. Sopta M. Hamel P.A. Ingles C.J. Gallie B.L. Philips R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3256-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) as a template, Vent DNA polymerase, and the following primers: O-SV1 (SpeI): 5′-gccgactagtgatcataatcagccata-3′ and O-SV2 (XbaI): 5′-gccgtctagatccagacatgata-3′. The 0.25-kb product was cut with SpeI and XbaI, and ligated into SpeI-cut pSFV1 (10Liljestrom P. Garoff H. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, pSFVpoly(A), contains a poly(A) signal downstream of the multiple cloning site. (ii) The SP6 promoter and the first 513 base pairs of the 5′ end of the SFV genome were removed from pSFVpoly(A) by digestion with SphI and BsiWI (Fig. 1 C). The 10.3-kb fragment was ligated with a 0.7-kbSphI-EcoRI CMV-T7 fragment (generated by amplification and digestion of base pairs 1570–2186 of pcDNA/NEO (Invitrogen) with the primers O-CMV1 (SphI): 5′-ccgccggcatgcgtaatcaattacggggtc-3′ and O-CMV2 (EcoRI): 5′-gccggaattcaagcttccggtctcccta-3′), and a 0.57-kb EcoRI-BsiWI fragment containing the first part of the SFV genome (generated by amplification and digestion of base pairs 1–517 in pSFV1 with the primers O-SFV3(EcoRI): 5′-gccggaattcatggcggatgtgtgacat-3′ and reverse primer, O-SFV2: 5′-gtacagcgatgttggtgc-3′). The resulting plasmid, pSCA1, contains the CMV IE/T7 promoters upstream of the SFV replicon and poly(A) region. (iii) pSCAβ was built by ligating a 4.6-kbBglII-SpeI fragment from pSFV3-lacZ (5Liljestrom P. Garoff H. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.D. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

This places thelacZ gene immediately downstream of the nsP4 coding region, under the control of the SFV subgenomic promoter (Fig. 1 C). ΔpSCAβ was built by deleting a 2.7-kb SacII fragment from pSCAβ. pSCAHelper (Fig. 6 A), was constructed by inserting the 3.6-kb SpeI/AccI fragment from pSCA1 into the 5.1-kb AccI/SpeI fragment from pSFVHelper2 (5Liljestrom P. Garoff H. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.D. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2.

Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 916-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). BHK-21 baby hamster kidney cells and COS-1 cells (SV40 transformed Green monkey kidney) were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 25 mm HEPES buffer, andl-glutamine. Cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. BHK-21 and COS-1 cells were grown to 50% confluence, trypsinized, washed once with IMDM plus FBS, once with PBS and resuspended at 107 cells/ml in a sterile medium comprising IMDM with 10 mm glucose and 0.1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. At room temperature, cells (0.8 ml) were transferred to a 0.4-cm cuvette (Bio-Rad), DNA added, and electroporation carried out using the Bio-Rad Gene Pulser. Cells from one cuvette were plated on five 6-cm plates. To optimize the transfection efficiency, variations in capacitance (25–960 mF), voltage (0.1–0.4 kV), number of pulses (1 or 2), and delay between pulses (0 or 30 s) were carried out in 80 combinations. In initial experiments, two 30-s delayed pulses at 0.4 kV and 960 mF yielded the maximum lacZ expression. However, re-optimization was required, and in more recent experiments cells received one pulse at 0.4 kV and 960 μF. Each data point represents the average of three electroporations. β-Galactosidase activity was measured by an ONPG (O-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, Ampresco) assay as described previously (19Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.in: Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1987Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase standards (Boehringer Mannheim) were used to convert the readings ofA 420 nm for the ONPG assay results into nanograms of protein. Transfected BHK-21 and COS-1 cells were stained by the X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside, Chemica Alta Ltd.) method (20Couffinhal T. Kearney M. Sullivan A. Silver M. Tsurumi Y. Isner J.M. Hum. Gene Ther. 1997; 8: 929-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). BHK-21 cells (8 × 106), electroporated with 2 μg of plasmid, were split into five 6-cm dishes (i.e. 0.4 μg of DNA/plate). Total DNA from one plate was isolated by phenol-chloroform extraction (19Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.in: Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1987Google Scholar), and 15% of the sample was digested and run on a 0.8% agarose gel, and transferred to a Gene Screen Plus membrane (NEN Life Science Products) as described previously (21Bremner R. Balmain A. Cell. 1990; 61: 407-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The 3.1-kb BamHI fragment of pSCAβ, corresponding to the lacZ gene, was random-prime labeled (22Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16646) Google Scholar) with [α-32P]dCTP and used as a probe for hybridization. Hybridization was performed as described (21Bremner R. Balmain A. Cell. 1990; 61: 407-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Blots were washed twice in 2× SSC and 1% SDS, then twice again in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Signal was visualized and quantitated using a Molecular Diagnostics PhosphorImager. The transfected amount of pSCAβ and pSCAHelper DNA was optimized to generate the highest viral titer. In duplicate experiments, pSCAβ (2 μg) and pSCAHelper were added in molar ratios of 1:0.5, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:4, respectively, to electroporation media containing 8 × 106 BHK-21 cells. Cells were electroporated and the contents of each cuvette plated on a 10-cm tissue culture plate. After 4 h, the medium was aspirated, cells washed with PBS, and 8 ml of IMDM (plus 10% FBS) was added. Medium containing the SFV particles was collected 24 and 36 h after electroporation and clarified by centrifugation at 2000 rpm (Sorvall RT 6000 D) for 15 min at 4 °C. Virus was activated with 0.5 mg/ml α-chymotrypsin at room temperature for 45 min, and aprotinin (0.38 mg/ml) added to stop protease activity (11Berglund P. Sjoberg M. Garoff H. Atkins G.J. Sheahan B.J. Liljestrom P. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 916-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). 0.2 ml of activated virus stock was added to 106BHK-21 cells on 6-cm tissue culture plates, and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. The infectious medium was aspirated, cells washed with PBS, and IMDM/10% FBS was added. ONPG and X-gal assays were performed 18 h after infection. X-gal-positive and -negative cells were counted in 10 fields viewed under 400× magnification. Total number of cells on the dish was obtained by trypsinizing a duplicate plate of infected cells. Viral titer was estimated by multiplying the total number of cells by both the fraction of X-gal-positive cells and a factor to correct for the volume of virus-containing supernatant used in the assay. A total of 8 × 106 BHK-21 cells were transfected with a 1:1 molar ratio of pSCAβ (2 μg) and pSCAHelper (1.2 μg) in 10 separate reactions. At 24 h after transfection, 0.5 ml of the growth medium from each 10-cm tissue culture plate was collected and viral titer determined (see above). Without α-chymotrypsin treatment, the remaining 6 ml were divided among six tissue culture plates (6 cm) containing 1 × 106 BHK cells and incubated for 45 min. The virus-containing medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed in PBS and then overlaid with a plaque assay medium (PAM) containing 0.6% low melt agarose (Bio Shop, Canada) in IMDM (plus 2% FBS, 10% tryptose phosphate (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 20 mm MgCl2). The cells were incubated for 5 days and checked for plaques daily. Cells infected with activated recombinant virus were tested for production of RPVs. A total of 3 × 107α-chymotrypsin activated infectious units, derived from three independent cotransfections of pSCAβ and pSCAHelper DNA, were used to infect 2 × 107 BHK cells. After 45 min of infection, cells were washed with PBS, overlaid with PAM, and checked for plaque-forming units (PFUs) daily over 5 days. To determine the incidence of RPV in growth media of cells infected with activated virus, 1 × 107 BHK cells were divided among 10 6-cm plates and infected, in total, with 4.4 × 106 infectious units of α-chymotrypsin activated recombinant virus. After 18 h, the growth medium was clarified, divided into 10 samples, and applied to 10 tissue culture plates (6 cm) containing a total of 2 × 107 BHK cells. After 45 min of incubation, PAM was overlaid onto cells and examined for PFUs daily for 5 days. The current expression system based on SFV requires transfection of RNA that contains the viral replicase genes and the inserted gene of interest (Fig. 1 B). RNA is obtained by SP6-driven in vitro transcription of an SFV cDNA-geneX cassette. Our goal was to simplify this system by circumventing the need for in vitro transcription and RNA handling. Thus, two major modifications were made to the parent vector pSFV1 (5Liljestrom P. Garoff H. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.D. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Boston1994: 16.20.1-16.20.16Google Scholar, 10Liljestrom P. Garoff H. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). First, the SV40 termination/polyadenylation signal was added immediately downstream of the 69 A residues at the 3′ end of the SFV cDNA (23Liljestrom P. Lusa S. Huylebroeck D. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4107-4113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The message expressed from the final vector is expected to have two poly(A) stretches separated by a short SV40 sequence. Second, the SP6 promoter in pSFV1 was replaced by a hybrid CMV IE/T7 promoter derived from the pcDNA vector (Invitrogen). The final vector, pSCAβ, was completed by insertion of the reporter gene,lacZ, into the multiple cloning site (Fig. 1). This bifunctional vector can be transcribed in vivo or in vitro using either the CMV IE or T7 promoter, respectively. To determine if pSCAβ was functional, the plasmid was transfected into BHK-21 cells and β-galactosidase activity measured in cell lysates. To optimize the amount of β-galactosidase produced, pSCAβ was transfected in 5-fold increments, from 0.08 μg up to 10 μg. β-galactosidase was detected in every case (Fig. 2), indicating that a DNA-based SFV expression system is viable. Maximum expression was obtained following transfection of 2 μg of DNA (Fig. 2), and this amount was used in all subsequent transfection experiments. The amount of β-galactosidase obtained per plate ranged from 100 ng (Fig. 2) to 900 ng in more recent experiments (data not shown), depending on transfection efficiency. The number of transfected cells was determined in several experiments by X-gal staining, and, coupled with determination of enzyme activity, consistently showed that pSCAβ generates around 20–30 pg of β-galactosidase/cell, which is similar to the 80 pg/cell obtained following transfection of in vitro generated re-RNA (10Liljestrom P. Garoff H. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). The levels of β-galactosidase obtained with the pSCAβ vector should be much higher than those obtained from a comparable vector that lacks the SFV nsPs. Message levels from CMVβGal (CLONTECH) are dependent on CMV IE promoter activity alone. Thus, BHK-21 cells were transfected with pSCAβ and CMVβGal and β-galactosidase activity measured over 5 days after transfection (Fig. 3 A). The amount of β-galactosidase produced by pSCAβ reached a maximum on day 2, and on day 1 for the CMVβGal vector. In several replicate experiments, the expression levels obtained with pSCAβ were, on average, 20–30-fold greater than CMVβGal. Similar data were obtained using COS-1 cells (data not shown). The elevated levels of expression observed with pSCAβversus CMVβGal plasmid is most likely due to the amplification of the message encoded by the SFV-based vector. However, it was also possible that this plasmid-based SFV vector transfected more efficiently. Against this possibility, we found that similar numbers of cells were stained blue in an X-gal assay whether pSCAβ or CMVβGal was transfected (data not shown). As a more quantitative measure of transfection efficiency, DNA was extracted from the same lysates that were used to measure the day 1 β-galactosidase activities shown in Fig. 3 A. DNA was digested, and transfected plasmid detected on a Southern blot by use of alacZ probe, and quantified on a PhosphorImager. Equal amounts of pSCAβ and CMVβGal were transfected (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, the higher expression observed with pSCAβ was due to the effects of the SFV polymerase (Fig. 1 A). To confirm that the SFV nsPs were indeed essential to the activity of pSCAβ, we tested whether a derivative with a large deletion in nsP2–3 could direct β-galactosidase expression. This plasmid (ΔpSCAβ, Fig. 1 C) was transfected into BHK-21 cells and β-galactosidase activity measured over a 5-day period. pSCAβ expressed an average of 220 ng of β-galactosidase/6-cm plate, but there was no β-galactosidase activity in cells transfected with ΔpSCAβ (Fig. 4 A). Similarly, when BHK-21 cells were stained for β-galactosidase using X-gal, only pSCAβ-transfected cells were positive (Fig. 4 B). Southern analysis performed on cells taken from 2, 3, and 4 days after transfection confirmed that both pSCAβ and ΔpSCAβ plasmids had been taken up (Fig. 4 C). The DNA from each transfection was quantitated on a PhosphorImager and the data used to base-line correct the β-galactosidase levels (Fig. 4 A). Thus, β-galactosidase expression from pSCAβ is not due to read-through translation of the full-length message, but is dependent on the SFV polymerase, which carries out both amplification and synthesis of the subgenomic lacZ transcript (Fig. 1 A). Sindbis, another alphavirus, was engineered by Wolff and co-workers (24Herweijer H. Latendresse J.S. Williams P. Zhang G. Danko I. Schlesinger S. Wolff J.A. Hum. Gene Ther. 1995; 6: 1161-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) into a plasmid-based vector. In this system, in vivo transcription of the Sindbis RNA was achieved by placing viral cDNA under transcriptional control of the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat (RSV LTR). The Sindbis vector, pSin-nlLacZ, also utilized lacZ as a reporter gene. To compare expression from the SFV (pSCAβ) and Sindbis (pSin-nlLacZ) DNA-based vectors, pSCAβ and pSin-nlLacZ were transfected into BHK-21 cells and β-galactosidase activity was measured over a 5-day period (Fig. 5 A). β-Galactosidase expression peaked on day 2 for both pSCAβ and pSin-nlLacZ. In several replicate experiments, β-galactosidase expression in BHK-21 cells was 10–20-fold higher for pSCAβ than for pSin-nlLacZ. Transfection efficiency of both plasmids, as assessed by Southern analysis, was similar (data not shown). Thus, higher levels of β-galactosidase were obtained using the SFV vector. To generate infectious virus particles using DNA-based SFV vectors, we constructed pSCAHelper, in which expression of helper RNA is driven by the CMV IE promoter (Fig. 6 A). This RNA contains the sequences at each end of the SFV genome that mediate amplification by the nsPs, but lacks the packaging signal located in the nsP2 gene (Fig. 1 A). Thus, cotransfection with the replicon vector will result in amplification of the helper message, transcription of the subgenomic message, and translation of the sPs. The sPs will package re-RNA, but not helper RNA. pSCAHelper carries mutations in the p62 sP gene that alter three amino acids so that generation of E2 and E3 glycoproteins from the p62 precursor and activation of the virus requires α-chymotrypsin treatment (11Berglund P. Sjoberg M. Garoff H. Atkins G.J. Sheahan B.J. Liljestrom P. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 916-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). BHK-21 cells were transfected with pSCAβ and pSCA-Helper plasmids in four molar ratios. After 24 h, 0.2 ml of the growth medium from the transfected cells was activated with α-chymotrypsin, applied to fresh BHK-21 cells, and titer determined. The highest viral yield was obtained with a 1:1 molar ratio, followed by 1:2, 1:0.5, and 1:4 (Fig. 6 B). To optimize the postinfection recovery time, BHK-21 cells were transfected with equimolar amounts of pSCAβ and pSCAHelper. Medium harvested 24 h after electroporation contained 2.05 × 106 infectious particles/ml, while medium harvested at 36 h after electroporation contained 0.80 × 106infectious particles/ml (Fig. 6 B). The amount of β-galactosidase generated after infection was similar to the amounts reported previously (10Liljestrom P. Garoff H. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). From a single transfection, plated on one 10-cm plate, approximately 107 infectious particles of virus was obtained. Infection of 1.1 × 106 BHK-21 cells with 3.2 × 105 particles generated 16 μg of β-galactosidase, so the total virus produced from this transfection was enough to generate >500 μg of β-galactosidase. One of the problems associated with any viral expression system is the generation of wild type virus through recombination between the separated components of the viral genome. In alphavirus systems, replication proficient virus (RPV) particles have been detected following cotransfection of replicon and helper RNAs (11Berglund P. Sjoberg M. Garoff H. Atkins G.J. Sheahan B.J. Liljestrom P. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 916-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 25Weiss B.G. Schlesinger S. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4017-4025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombination occurs when the polymerase switches templates during amplification (26Raju R. Subramaniam S.V. Hajjou M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7391-7401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a DNA-based system, homologous recombination between plasmids provides another level at which a complete virus genome could be generated. However, with the SFV system described here, recombination alone would not generate fully infectious virus since reversion or suppression of the conditional mutation that inhibits p62 cleavage would also be required (11Berglund P. Sjoberg M. Garoff H. Atkins G.J. Sheahan B.J. Liljestrom P. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 916-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). We performed three assays to estimate the frequency of RPV generation with the DNA-based SFV system (Fig. 7). To determine whether the growth media from BHK-21 cells transfected with pSCAβ and pSCAHelper DNA contained any RPV, BHK-21 cells were cotransfected with pSCAβ (2 μg) and pSCAHelper (1.2 μg) in 10 separate experiments. After 24 h, 0.5 ml of growth medium was removed from each transfection and used to determine viral titer. The remaining growth medium, which contained over 5 × 107recombinant virus particles, was added to 6 × 107fresh BHK-21 cells without α-chymotrypsin treatment. The cells were overlaid with agarose and examined for the appearance of PFUs over 5 days (Fig. 7 A). No PFUs were detected. Additionally, no RPV particles were found when plaque assays were performed on 2 × 107 BHK cells infected with 3 × 107 α-chymotrypsin-activated recombinant viral particles (Fig. 7 B). Further experiments were performed to analyze if the culture medium from cells infected with activated recombinant virus contained any RPV. BHK-21 cells were infected with activated recombinant virus over various multiplicities of infection (m.o.i.). A total of 4.4 × 106 particles were used in these experiments. The medium was collected 18 h after infection, applied to new BHK-21 cells, and tested for the presence of RPV (Fig. 7 C). No PFUs were detected. In summary, a total of 8.7 × 107 virus particles obtained by transfection of pSCAβ and pSCAHelper were negative in three tests for RPVs, indicating that generation of wild type virus is extremely rare. Alphavirus expression systems have been used to express a wide range of heterologous proteins (reviewed in Refs. 14Liljestrom P. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar and 27Frolov I. Hoffman T.A. Pragai B.M. Dryga S.A. Huang H.V. Schlesinger S. Rice C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11371-11377Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Although the approach is simpler and much faster than vectors such as baculovirus, neither SFV nor the related Sindbis vectors have superceded baculovirus as the expression system of choice. One technical drawback of the original alphavirus systems is that they require production and manipulation of recombinant RNA in vitro. Therefore, the design of DNA-based alphavirus vectors, both for SFV (this work) and Sindbis (17Dubensky T.W.J. Driver D.A. Polo J.M. Belli B.A. Latham E.M. Ibanez C.E. Chada S. Brumm D. Banks T.A. Mento S.J. Jolly D.J. Chang S.M.W. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 508-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Herweijer H. Latendresse J.S. Williams P. Zhang G. Danko I. Schlesinger S. Wolff J.A. Hum. Gene Ther. 1995; 6: 1161-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), significantly improves the utility of these expression systems. These developments also simplify the use of alphaviruses as in vivo gene delivery systems, for example, in the delivery of vaccines (28Tubulekas I. Berglund P. Fleeton M. Liljestrom P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1997; 190: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Our observations, and those of others using DNA-based Sindbis vectors (17Dubensky T.W.J. Driver D.A. Polo J.M. Belli B.A. Latham E.M. Ibanez C.E. Chada S. Brumm D. Banks T.A. Mento S.J. Jolly D.J. Chang S.M.W. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 508-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Herweijer H. Latendresse J.S. Williams P. Zhang G. Danko I. Schlesinger S. Wolff J.A. Hum. Gene Ther. 1995; 6: 1161-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), show that at least a portion of full-length re-RNA generated in the nucleus must reach the cytoplasm. Indeed, the amount of protein produced per cell with the DNA-based SFV vector was similar to that obtained previously following infection of cells with a recombinant virus (10Liljestrom P. Garoff H. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Expression was optimal with 2 μg of pSCAβ and peaked 48 h after transfection. With these parameters, approximately 20–30 pg of β-galactosidase was obtained per cell. Protein expression with the DNA-based SFV vector was 20–30-fold higher than with a simple CMV IE-based vector. This difference can be attributed to the effect of the SFV polymerase, since a large deletion in the nsP gene region completely abolished protein expression. Two groups have developed DNA-based Sindbis expression vectors (17Dubensky T.W.J. Driver D.A. Polo J.M. Belli B.A. Latham E.M. Ibanez C.E. Chada S. Brumm D. Banks T.A. Mento S.J. Jolly D.J. Chang S.M.W. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 508-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,24Herweijer H. Latendresse J.S. Williams P. Zhang G. Danko I. Schlesinger S. Wolff J.A. Hum. Gene Ther. 1995; 6: 1161-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We compared the performance of the Sindbis vector pSin-nlLacZ (24Herweijer H. Latendresse J.S. Williams P. Zhang G. Danko I. Schlesinger S. Wolff J.A. Hum. Gene Ther. 1995; 6: 1161-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) against the SFV vector, pSCAβ. pSCAβ generated 10–20-fold more β-galactosidase than the Sindbis-derived vector. This result is not due to a difference in the efficiency of SFV and Sindbis polymerases, since transfection of SFV or Sindbis re-RNAs yields similar levels of protein (10Liljestrom P. Garoff H. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 27Frolov I. Hoffman T.A. Pragai B.M. Dryga S.A. Huang H.V. Schlesinger S. Rice C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11371-11377Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Thus, other components of pSCAβ and pSin-nlLacZ must be responsible. pSin-nlLacZ encodes β-galactosidase that is targeted to the nucleus, whereas the protein encoded by pSCAβ lacks a nuclear localization signal, but it seems unlikely that this would explain the large difference in expression levels. An important element required for maximal expression is the viral poly(A) tract placed downstream of the reporter gene (17Dubensky T.W.J. Driver D.A. Polo J.M. Belli B.A. Latham E.M. Ibanez C.E. Chada S. Brumm D. Banks T.A. Mento S.J. Jolly D.J. Chang S.M.W. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 508-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, both pSCAβ and pSin-nlLacZ contain such a motif. pSCAβ contains an additional termination/polyadenylation signal downstream of this tract, whereas pSin-nlLacZ lacks this element. However, this motif inhibited expression of another DNA-based Sindbis vector (24Herweijer H. Latendresse J.S. Williams P. Zhang G. Danko I. Schlesinger S. Wolff J.A. Hum. Gene Ther. 1995; 6: 1161-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Other factors that could influence protein expression include the promoters (CMV IE or RSV LTR in pSCAβ and pSin-nlLacZ, respectively), the positioning oflacZ relative to the subgenomic promoter, and the efficiency of translation. We suspect that promoter-strength is the major factor, but additional experiments are required to test this idea. Studies with other DNA-based Sindbis vectors also suggest that promoter-strength influences vector efficiency (17Dubensky T.W.J. Driver D.A. Polo J.M. Belli B.A. Latham E.M. Ibanez C.E. Chada S. Brumm D. Banks T.A. Mento S.J. Jolly D.J. Chang S.M.W. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 508-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also utilized the CMV IE promoter to generate a helper plasmid (pSCAHelper) in which expression of viral sPs is RNA polymerase II-dependent. Cotransfection of pSCAβ and pSCAHelper generated virus at a titer of around 106 infectious particles/ml (which could be artificially low, since X-gal staining was used to determine titer, and this method has recently been shown to underestimate the number of β-galactosidase-positive cells (20Couffinhal T. Kearney M. Sullivan A. Silver M. Tsurumi Y. Isner J.M. Hum. Gene Ther. 1997; 8: 929-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar)). Virus generated using the new DNA vectors gives the same high yield of protein as virus generated by the original RNA-based approach (50 μg of β-galactosidase/106 particles of recombinant virus). Virus stocks generated using pSCAHelper are conditionally infectious due to amino acid changes within sP p62 at the junction between the E2 and E3 spike proteins (11Berglund P. Sjoberg M. Garoff H. Atkins G.J. Sheahan B.J. Liljestrom P. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 916-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). This modification reduces the chance of obtaining wild-type virus, which would require recombination between re-RNA and helper RNA, and reversion or suppression of the conditional mutation. Empirical measurements show that the chance of generating RPV, following transfection of re-RNA and helper RNA that encodes α-chymotrypsin-activated p62, is less than 10−10, and has never been observed (11Berglund P. Sjoberg M. Garoff H. Atkins G.J. Sheahan B.J. Liljestrom P. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 916-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). A disadvantage of DNA vectors is that they provide another opportunity for recombination. The level of RPVs obtained following transfection of Sindbis DNA-based replicon and helper vectors was 1000-fold higher (∼107 PFU/ml) than that obtained after transfection of in vitro generated re-RNA and helper RNA (∼104 PFU/ml) (17Dubensky T.W.J. Driver D.A. Polo J.M. Belli B.A. Latham E.M. Ibanez C.E. Chada S. Brumm D. Banks T.A. Mento S.J. Jolly D.J. Chang S.M.W. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 508-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, a similar number of RPVs and recombinant particles were generated using the DNA-based system Sindbis vectors. In contrast, no RPVs were detected in a population of nearly 108 recombinant particles generated using the DNA-based SFV system described here. These statistics highlight an important advantage of the SFV vectors. We thank Shi-Yen Mak for help in building pSCAβ and ΔpSCAβ, and Irina Burcescu for help in building pSCAHelper. We are also very grateful to P. Liljeström for providing pSFV1, pSFVHelper, and pSFV3-lacZ, and H. Herweijer and J. A. Wolff for providing pSin-nlLacZ."

However, recognition that in humans P450c27 is a widely or ubiquitously expressed mitochondrial P450, and that there are alternative pathways of bile acid synthesis which begin with 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol catalyzed by P450c27, suggests the need to reevaluate the role of this enzyme and its catalytic properties. 27-Hydroxycholesterol was thought to be the only product formed upon reaction of P450c27 with cholesterol.

The major pathway for the metabolism and excretion of cholesterol in mammals is the formation of the bile acids in liver. Cholesterol can be degraded to bile acids in mammalian liver via two different routes, one starting with 7α-hydroxylation, catalyzed by the microsomal cytochrome P450 cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (P450c7), 1The abbreviations used are: P450c7, cytochrome P450 catalyzing 7α-hydroxylation of cholesterol, the product of CYP7 gene; P450c27, cytochrome P450 catalyzing the multiple oxidation reactions at the C-27 atom of steroids, the product of the CYP27 gene; P450scc, cholesterol side-chain cleavage cytochrome P450, the product of the CYP11A gene (55Nelson D.R.

The route that begins with 7α-hydroxylation (the classical pathway) is well described and is believed to be quantitatively most important, whereas the sequence of reactions leading to bile acids after 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol (alternative pathways) are only now being investigated (2Swell L.

Investigation of the quantitative importance of this pathway in extrahepatic tissues in relation to high density lipoproteins (HDL)-mediated reverse cholesterol transport, the most important mechanism for cholesterol removal from extrahepatic cells, also indicates that the 27-hydroxylation pathway is an alternative and/or a complement to HDL-mediated reverse cholesterol transport (11Diczfalusy U.

Although P450c27 appears to be the only enzyme responsible for the conversion of cholesterol into 27-hydroxycholesterol (18Björkhem I. Gustafsson J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 36: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 19Gustafsson J. Sjöstedt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 199-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Oftebro H.

One hypothesis is that this reaction may be catalyzed by alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases (22Dahlbäck H. Danielsson H. Gustafsson M. Sjövall J. Wikvall K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 153: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Moreover, even though comparable amounts of 27-hydroxycholesterol and 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid are formed upon incubation of human macrophages with cholesterol, purified rabbit liver P450c27 has been found only to produce 27-hydroxycholesterol from cholesterol with no detectable 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid (23Holmberg-Betsholtz I. Wikvall K. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 55: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Recently, we overexpressed human P450c27 in Escherichia coli yielding the highly purified enzyme and in initial experiments we also did not observe the formation of 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid (24Pikuleva I.A. Björkhem I. Waterman M.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Herein, we describe the conditions under which 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid is formed from cholesterol in a reconstituted system demonstrating for the first time that P450c27 is able to catalyze multiple oxidation reactions at the C-27 atom of cholesterol. We also show that under identical in vitro conditions 27-hydroxycholesterol and 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenal are more efficiently converted into 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid by P450c27 than is cholesterol into 27-hydroxycholesterol. Because 27-hydroxycholesterol has a number of potent biological activities that relate to regulation of cholesterol synthesis (25Javitt N.B. J.

Res. 1996; 83: 449-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), discovery of factors influencing the level of 27-hydroxycholesterol is important. Because a single enzyme catalyzes both the formation and the degradation of 27-hydroxycholesterol, studies identifying factors influencing the rates of both the oxidation of cholesterol into 27-hydroxycholesterol, and the conversion of 27-hydroxycholesterol into 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid by P450c27, provide insight as to how the level of these two oxygenated cholesterol metabolites and the ratio between them may differ within extrahepatic tissues. These studies establish the initial sequence of reactions in alternative bile acid biosynthetic pathways and expand our knowledge of the diversity of the substrates utilized by this enzyme. Reagents for bacterial growth were from Difco. [4-14C]Cholesterol was from DuPont; tritium-labeled and unlabeled 27-hydroxycholesterol were synthesized as described previously (32Björkhem I. Nyberg B. Einarsson K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1128: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). 3β-Hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid was synthesized via standard Wittig-Horner reaction of 3β-tert-butyldimethylsilyloxocholest-24-al (33Lund E. Breuer O. Björkhem I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25092-25097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tritium-labeled 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid was obtained by oxidizing the unlabeled free acid with commercial 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (obtained from Boehringer Mannheim) under the conditions previously described (34Aringer L. Eneroth P. Steroids. 1971; 18: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) to yield the 3-oxo-4-unsaturated analogue of cholestenoic acid. This compound was methylated and converted into the corresponding enol trimethylsilyl ether (34Aringer L. Eneroth P. Steroids. 1971; 18: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The crude enol ether was immediately reduced with NaB[3H]4 (obtained from Amersham International, UK) in isopropanol. The resultant methyl ester of 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid was hydrolyzed by alkaline saponification and extracted with ether from acidified water phase. The ether extract was washed with water until neutral, and the ether was evaporated. The material was pure as judged by radio thin layer chromatography with the use of toluene/ethyl acetate 3:7 (v:v) as a moving phase, and the identity was confirmed by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of the trimethylsilyl ether-methyl ester. The specific radioactivity was 5 × 109 cpm/μg, and it was diluted with unlabeled 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid to a specific radioactivity of 600,000 cpm/μg prior to incubation. Cholesten-27-al was prepared from unlabeled and labeled 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid by methylation and acetylation followed by reduction with diisobutyluminium hydride (35Holmberg-Betsholtz I. Lund E. Björkhem I. Wikvall K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11079-11085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The aldehyde was purified by preparative thin-layer chromatography, using toluene/ethyl acetate 3:7 (v:v) as a moving phase. The identity of the compound was confirmed by GC-MS of the trimethylsilyl ether-methyl ester derivative. There was a continuous degradation of the aldehyde into the corresponding acid and alcohol due to non-enzymatic dismutation. As a consequence, only newly synthesized and newly purified material could be used in the experiments, and in general the purified aldehyde used contained a minimum of 4% of the corresponding acid and 4% of the corresponding alcohol. Recombinant human P450c27, recombinant bovine adrenodoxin (Adx), and recombinant adrenodoxin reductase (Adr) were expressed and purified as described previously (24Pikuleva I.A. Björkhem I. Waterman M.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). P450c27 with a heme content of 17.6 nmol/mg protein showing a single band upon silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used in this study. Prior to enzymatic assays P450c27 was dialyzed overnight against 100 volumes of 40 mmphosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 20% glycerol to remove 1m NaCl and 0.5% sodium cholate present in the elution buffer used during the last purification step, and concentrated to 70 μm using ultrafiltration membrane cones (Amicon). Spectral purity indexes of recombinant Adx (A 414/A 276) and recombinant Adr (A 278/A 450) were 0.95 and 7.5, respectively. Adx and Adr are considered to be pure with the spectral purity indexes beginning from 0.86 for Adx and 7.5 for Adr (36Kimura T. Parcells J.H. Wang H.-P. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). P450c27 activities using either cholesterol, 27-hydroxycholesterol or 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenal as a substrate were assayed in 40 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), containing 0.1% Tween 20 (24Pikuleva I.A. Björkhem I. Waterman M.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). When 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid was used as a substrate, the buffer did not contain detergent. Reaction mixtures (1 ml) contained variable amounts of P450c27, Adx, Adr, and substrate. Enzymatic assays were initiated by addition of NADPH (final 1 mm), carried out at 37 °C for different times, and terminated by adding 2 ml of CH2Cl2. Steroids, after extraction with CH2Cl2, were evaporated, dissolved in methanol and analyzed by HPLC. The conditions used for separation of cholesterol from 27-hydoxycholesterol and 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid were the same as described previously (37Pikuleva I.A. Björkhem I. Waterman M.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The retention times for 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid, 27-hydroxycholesterol, and cholesterol were 9.25, 10.95, and 18.6 min, respectively. Under these conditions, however, 27-hydroxycholesterol and 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenal were not separated, and the two products appeared as one homogenous peak. To separate 27-hydroxycholesterol and 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenal, another HPLC system was developed. Steroids were separated using a YMC-PACK-ODS-A (4.6 × 250 mm) (YMC Co., Ltd.) column and isocratic elution with methanol/water/acetic acid 85:15:0.01 (v/v/v). The flow rate was 1 ml/min. The retention times for 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid, 27-hydroxycholesterol, and 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenal were 40, 46, and 51 min, respectively. The products obtained after the incubation of P450c27 with different substrates were identified using GC-MS. Previous studies of enzymatic activities showed no formation of 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid upon incubation of purified P450c27 with cholesterol (23Holmberg-Betsholtz I. Wikvall K. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 55: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 24Pikuleva I.A. Björkhem I. Waterman M.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In these experiments, relatively low (0.1–0.2 nmol) amounts of P450c27 were used in reconstituted systems. Results using cultured human macrophages (9Björkhem I. Andersson O. Diczfalusy U. Sevastik B. Xiu R.-G. Duan C. Lund E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8592-8596Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) and human aortic endothelial cells (17Reiss A.B. Martin K.O. Rojer D.E. Iyer S. Grossi E.A. Galloway C. Javitt N.B. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1254-1260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrating conversion of cholesterol into 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid led us to further investigate metabolism of cholesterol by P450c27 using greater (up to 3 nmol) amounts of enzyme. These experiments were carried out in the presence of 0.1% Tween 20 because addition of non-ionic detergents substantially increases solubility of cholesterol in aqueous solutions (38Haberland M.E. Reynolds J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2313-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 39Pal S. Moulik S.P. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 1281-1290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To be able to compare catalytic properties of P450c27 toward different substrates under similar conditions, 0.1% Tween 20 was also included in the reaction mixture when 27-hydroxycholesterol and 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenal were used as substrates. As judged by HPLC separation (Fig. 1 C), two major products are formed from cholesterol when 1.5 μm P450c27 is used in a reconstituted system in the presence of 0.1% Tween 20. No products were formed when either Adx or NADPH were omitted (data not shown). GC-MS analysis performed after preliminary HPLC separation showed that the first peak is 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid, the second peak besides 27-hydroxycholesterol may contain small amounts of 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenal, and the third peak is cholesterol. Finding that second peak is not homogeneous was surprising because 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenal was not detected when lower concentrations of P450c27 (0.04 μm or 0.2 μm) were used (Fig. 1 A). To check whether 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenal is really not separated from 27-hydroxycholesterol under the chromatographic conditions used and to develop an HPLC system allowing separation of all three reaction products, 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenal was synthesized (see “Experimental Procedures”). Analysis of the chromatographic behavior of chemically synthesized 27-hydroxycholesterol and 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenal revealed that these two products are indeed not separated from each other under the conditions described in Fig. 1. The new chromatographic system (see “Experimental Procedures”) separates 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid, 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenal, and 27-hydroxycholesterol (Fig. 2). The retention time of the chemically synthesized 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenal was virtually identical to that of one of the biologically generated products. However, the amounts of this product after preliminary HPLC separation were too small to allow clear identification by GC-MS. The final proof that 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenal is indeed the intermediate in the conversion of cholesterol into 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid catalyzed by P450c27 was obtained from the incubations with 27-hydroxycholesterol described below. Because the new chromatographic system does not allow quantitation of unmetabolized cholesterol, the patterns of product formation (Fig. 1 B) were generated by first determining the total conversion of cholesterol into 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid and (27-hydroxycholesterol+3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenal) using the initial chromatographic system, and then the ratio between the three products was determined using the second chromatographic system.Figure 2HPLC separation of products formed after 10 min of reaction of 1.5 nmol of human recombinant P450c27 with 50 nmol of 27-hydroxycholesterol. Reaction conditions and steroid separation are described under “Experimental Procedures.” Thearrow indicates a minor polar product which is a monohydroxylated cholestenoic acid. The inset shows the kinetics of formation of 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenal (27-CHO, •) and 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid (27-COOH, ▾).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Kinetic analysis of the reaction using 1.5 μm P450c27 and 50 μm cholesterol reveals that there is a lag phase in the formation of 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid (Fig. 1 B), indicating that a certain amount of 27-hydroxycholesterol should be accumulated before it can be further metabolized. The presence of the lag phase and the fact that the ratio between 27-hydroxycholesterol and 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid is not constant but changes during time course of the reaction (Fig. 1 B) indicates that after 27-hydroxycholesterol is formed from cholesterol, it is released from the P450c27, and then competes with cholesterol to reenter the enzyme active site for further oxidation. The more 27-hydroxycholesterol formed, the more efficiently it competes with cholesterol, changing a ratio between 27-hydroxycholesterol and 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid from 10.96 after 10 min of reaction to 1.51 after 40 min under the conditions used in Fig. 1 B. If 27-hydroxycholesterol were not released from the P450c27 active site, the formation of 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid would parallel the formation of 27-hydroxycholesterol. In the reconstituted system containing 1.5 μm P450c27 and 50 μm 27-hydroxycholesterol as initial substrate, the major product formed was 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid (Fig. 2). The amount of 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid was increased with reaction time (Fig. 2, inset), no 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid was detected when NADPH was omitted from the reaction mixture, and formation of 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid was substantially reduced in the presence of ketoconazole, which is an inhibitor of many P450 s including P450c27 (data not shown). The amounts of 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenal formed in incubations with 27-hydroxycholesterol were 2–3 times higher than in the incubations with cholesterol. The mass spectrum of the trimethylsilyl ether of this metabolite (Fig. 3 B) was identical to that of synthetic 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenal (Fig. 3 A). Identification of the aldehyde as an intermediate establishes the expected reaction sequence in the overall conversion of cholesterol into 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid by P450c27. Due to the instability, only small amount of 3β-hydroxy-5-hydroxycholestenal was synthesized. This amount, however, was enough to show that synthetic 3β-hydroxy-5-hydroxycholestenal can be efficiently converted by P450c27 into 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid and to compare under identical conditions the rates of conversion of 3β-hydroxy-5-hydroxycholestenal into 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid and cholesterol into 27-hydroxycholesterol (TableI). Because 3β-hydroxy-5-hydroxycholestenal can dismutate nonenzymatically, the formation of 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid was also determined in the absence of NADPH. As is seen from Table I, the capacity of P450c27 to convert 3β-hydroxy-5-hydroxycholestenal into 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid is at least 5 times higher than that to convert cholesterol into 27-hydroxycholesterol. The fact that 79% of 3β-hydroxy-5-hydroxycholestenal was converted into 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid within 10 min of reaction also indicates that experimental conditions using this substrate were not optimal for kinetic analysis and the concentration of the substrate could be rate-limiting. The rate of conversion of 3β-hydroxy-5-hydroxycholestenal into 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid may be even higher than in Table I if optimal conditions are used.Table IComparison of the rates of metabolism of 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenal and cholesterol catalyzed by P450c27Reaction catalyzedConversion into productaThe reactions with both substrates were carried out simultaneously and under identical conditions using 12.5 μm substrate and 1.5 μm P450c27.10 min20 min%3β-Hydroxy-5-cholestenal → 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid Full system7378 −NADPH411Cholesterol → 27-hydroxycholesterol Full system1328 −NADPHNDbND, not detectable.NDa The reactions with both substrates were carried out simultaneously and under identical conditions using 12.5 μm substrate and 1.5 μm P450c27.b ND, not detectable. Open table in a new tab As is seen from Fig. 2, there is a minor polar product eluting from the column earlier than 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid which is formed upon incubation of P450c27 with 27-hydroxycholesterol. To check the origin of this product, 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid was used as substrate at very low concentrations to maximize conversion. Fig. 4 shows that 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid can be metabolized by P450c27. The formation of the product is time-dependent and requires the complete reconstituted system consisting of P450c27, Adx, Adr, and NADPH (data not shown). Isolation of the polar product fraction by HPLC and analysis of the trimethylsilylated methyl ester showed that it consists of one major and one minor monohydroxylated metabolites (Fig. 5, A and B). The mass spectrum of both products was similar to the mass spectrum of the corresponding derivative of 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid with prominent peaks at m/z 79,m/z 129 (3β-hydroxy-5-unsaturated steroid), andm/z 213. The ions at m/z255 (nucleus − trimethylsilyl ether), m/z345 (M − side chain), m/z 373 (M − 129), m/z 412 (M − 90), andm/z 502 (M) in the mass spectrum of cholestenoic acid derivative were shifted in the two products by two mass units tom/z 253, m/z 343,m/z 371, m/z 410, andm/z 500 as shown in Fig. 5. This is consistent with loss of one trimethylsilyl ether group from the steroid nucleus in both products. Although it was not possible to define the specific location of the hydroxyl group introduced in the steroid nucleus by P450c27 in each product from the fragmentation pattern, it is possible to exclude certain positions due to the absence of characteristic peaks obtained with standards.

https://openalex.org/W2158263698,"The ZFM1 protein is both a transcriptional repressor and identical to the splicing factor SF1. ZFM1 was shown to interact with and repress transcription from the glycine, glutamine, serine, and threonine-rich transcription activation domain of the sea urchin transcription factor, stage-specific activator protein (SSAP). EWS, a human protein involved in cellular transformation in Ewing's sarcoma tumors, contains an NH2-terminal transcriptional activation domain (NTD) which resembles that of SSAP in both amino acid composition and the ability to drive transcription to levels higher than VP16 in most cell types. Here we report that ZFM1 also interacts with EWS in both two-hybrid assays and glutathioneS-transferase pull-down experiments. The region on EWS which interacts with ZFM1 maps to 37 amino acids within its NTD. Overexpression of ZFM1 in HepG2 cells represses the transactivation of reporter gene expression driven by Gal4-EWS-NTD fusion protein and this repression correlates with ZFM1 binding to EWS. Furthermore, two proteins, TLS and hTAFII68, which have extensive homology to EWS, also interact with ZFM1. Recently, it was discovered that EWS/TLS/hTAFII68 are each present in distinct TFIID populations and EWS and hTAFII68 were also found to be associated with the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme. The association of ZFM1 with these proteins implies that one normal cellular function for ZFM1 may be to negatively modulate transcription of target genes coordinated by these cofactors."

We present evidence that phosphorylation of PLCβ3 by PKA results in inhibition of Gαq-stimulated PLCβ3 activity, and we identify the site of phosphorylation. Two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis of in vitro phosphorylated PLCβ3revealed a single phosphoserine as the putative PKA site, and peptide mapping yielded one phosphopeptide.

Overexpression of Gαq with PLCβ3 or PLCβ3 (Ser1105 → Ala) mutant in COSM6 cells resulted in a 5-fold increase in [3H]phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation compared with expression of Gαq, PLCβ3, or PLCβ3 (Ser1105 → Ala) mutant alone. Whereas Gαq-stimulated PLCβ3 activity was inhibited by 58–71% by overexpression of PKA catalytic subunit, Gαq-stimulated PLCβ3 (Ser1105→ Ala) mutant activity was not affected.

This notion is further supported by studies with the G protein activators GTPγS and AlF4−. These two compounds nonselectively activate all heterotrimeric G proteins and generate free Gα and Gβγ subunits that can stimulate PLCβs. PKA inhibition of PI turnover initiated by GTPγS or AlF4− (5Tachado S.D. Akhtar R.A. Zhou C. Abdel-Latif A.A. Cell. Signalling. 1992; 4: 61-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 8McAtee P.

In addition, this phenomenon also suggests that the PKA effect is distal to receptors. Recently, the mechanism for PKA inhibition of Gβγ-stimulated PI turnover has been elucidated. Phosphorylation of PLCβ2 by PKA resulted in inhibition of Gβγ-stimulated PI turnover (10Liu M. Simon M.I. Nature. 1996; 382: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, in the same study, PKA apparently did not inhibit Gα15- and Gα16-stimulated endogenous PLCβ (β1 and β3) activity. More recently, Aliet al. (11Ali H. Fisher I. Haribabu B. Richardson R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11706-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) have reported phosphorylation of PLCβ3 in response to CPT-cAMP treatment in RBL-2H3 cells expressing only PLCβ3. CPT-cAMP inhibited Gβγ-stimulated PLCβ3 activated by the Gαi-coupled formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine receptor but had no effect on PAF-stimulated PLCβ3 activity, presumably mediated by Gαq. These studies led to the conclusions that phosphorylation of PLCβ2 and PLCβ3 by PKA could explain the inhibition of Gβγ-stimulated PI turnover by cAMP (10Liu M. Simon M.I. Nature. 1996; 382: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 11Ali H. Fisher I. Haribabu B. Richardson R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11706-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, a biochemical mechanism for the inhibition by PKA of Gαq-stimulated PLCβ activity observed in several systems remains to be clarified. In this study, we present evidence that phosphorylation of PLCβ3 Ser1105 by PKA results in direct inhibition of Gαq-stimulated PLCβ3activity. PLCβ3 antibody, immunoblotting, and immunoprecipitation reagents were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Lys-C was obtained from Wako Bioproducts (Richmond, VA). PKA catalytic subunit and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. LipofectAMINE, DMEM, and all other cell culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. [3H]Inositol (22 Ci/mmol), [32P]orthophosphate, and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Relaxin was purified from pregnant sow ovaries (16Rao M.R. Sanborn B.M. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 435-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The RBL-2H3 cell line was generously provided by Dr. H. Ali (Duke University). Gαqwas a gift from J. Hepler (Emory University), and the PLCβ1 clone in baculovirus was obtained from Dr. P. Sternweis (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). PKA catalytic subunit plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. S. McKnight (University of Washington), and Gαq plasmid by Dr. M. Simon (California Institute of Technology). PLCβ3 and PLCβ3(His)6 in pCR3.1 vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and PLCβ3(His)6 in baculovirus (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) were constructed from the PLCβ3 cDNA plasmid (17Lagercrantz J. Carson E. Phelan C. Grimmond S. Rosen A. Dare E. Nordenskjold M. Hayward N.K. Larsson C. Weber G. Genomics. 1995; 26: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutation of Ser1105 to Ala was achieved with the mutagenic primer (5′-AGCGCCATAACGCCATCTCGGAGG-3′) using the GeneEditor kit (Promega, Madison, WI). All plasmid sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. PLCβ3(His)6 was purified essentially as described for PLCβ1 (18Meij J.T. Ross E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) from the membrane fraction from Sf9 cells and was 99% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE. 0.5, 1.5, or 2.5 μmpurified recombinant PLCβ3(His)6 was incubated with PKA catalytic subunit at molar ratios of 20:1 or 50:1 in the presence of 1–10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 100 μm ATP in a total volume of 10 μl of PKA buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2) for 10 min at 30 °C. For the time course study, 1.3 μmPLCβ3(His)6 was incubated with PKA at a ratio of 10:1. Reactions were terminated by addition of an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer (15Wen Y. Anwer K. Singh S.P. Sanborn B.M. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 1377-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and boiling for 5 min. Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE gels, and the phosphorylated band was localized by autoradiography. Two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis and peptide mapping ofin vitro32P-labeled PLCβ3(His)6 bound to PVDF membranes were carried out with a Hunter thin layer electrophoresis system (CBS Scientific Company, Del Mar, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For two-dimensional peptide mapping, the membrane bound samples were digested with Lys-C (3 μg) for 24 h at 35 °C. For peptide sequencing, 150 pmol of [32P]PLCβ3(His)6 was digested with Lys-C (1 μg). The phosphopeptide separated by reverse-phase HPLC was sequenced at the microsequencing facility at Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, TX). Nearly confluent PHM1–41 immortalized myometrial cells (10-cm dish) were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (0.33 mCi/ml) in phosphate-free DMEM containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum for 4 h. After the treatments indicated in the figure legends, cells were lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (11Ali H. Fisher I. Haribabu B. Richardson R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11706-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Phosphorylated proteins immunoprecipitated with 4 μg of anti-PLCβ3 antibody were separated on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and analyzed by autoradiography. PLCβ3 was visualized by Western blot using anti-PLCβ3 antibody (1:1000) to normalize for sample loading. COSM6 and RBL-2H3 cells were cultured and transfected as described (4Dodge K.L. Sanborn B.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2265-2271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ali H. Fisher I. Haribabu B. Richardson R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11706-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. COSM6 cells were transfected with a total of 1.25 (see Fig. 4 A) or 1.5 μg (see Fig. 4 B) of plasmid DNA (using empty vector rcCMV as necessary) and 6 μl of LipofectAMINE in 0.75 ml of DMEM/well in 6-well plates, whereas 1.0 μg of total plasmid DNA and 5 μl of LipofectAMINE in 0.5 ml of DMEM were used to transfect RBL-2H3 cells. An equal volume of culture medium (4Dodge K.L. Sanborn B.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2265-2271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing 16% fetal calf serum was added 5 h later. The following day, cells were labeled with 6 μCi/well [3H]inositol in 1 ml of culture medium for 24 h at 37 °C. ZnSO4 (60 μm) was also included in the labeling medium to stimulate PKA catalytic subunit expression in COSM6 cells. After incubating with 10 mm LiCl for 10 (RBL-2H3) or 45 (COSM6) min, cells were treated as indicated in the figure legends and lysed by addition of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. The accumulation of [3H]IP3 was determined as described elsewhere (4Dodge K.L. Sanborn B.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2265-2271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have determined previously that the PKA inhibitory effect is distal to receptor and most likely affects the coupling between Gαq and PLCβ1 or PLCβ3isoforms in pregnant human myometrial (PHM1–41) and COSM6 cell lines (4Dodge K.L. Sanborn B.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2265-2271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, when incubated with PKA, C-terminal (His)6-tagged PLCβ3 (PLCβ3(His)6) purified from Sf9 cells was clearly a substrate for PKA in vitro. Similar results were also obtained with immunoprecipitation-purified recombinant PLCβ3 (data not shown). The phosphorylation of PLCβ3 was quite specific; neither highly purified recombinant Gαq nor recombinant PLCβ1 was phosphorylated by PKA under similar conditions (data not shown), confirming previous observations (19Lounsbury K.M. Schlegel B.S. Poncz M. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3494-3498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Jhon D. Lee H. Park D. Lee C. Lee K. Yoo O.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6654-6661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) To quantify PKA-stimulated 32P incorporation from [γ-32P]ATP, PLCβ3(His)6 was phosphorylated by PKA in vitro. Fig. 1 C shows that the time course of 32P incorporation approached a plateau after 15 min. A maximum ratio of 0.65 mol phosphate/mol PLCβ3 was determined by filter binding assay at the 60-min incubation point. This is consistent with a single PKA phosphorylation site in PLCβ3. To examine whether PLCβ3 could be phosphorylated in vivo, PHM1–41 myometrial cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, and PKA was activated with the cell-permeable cAMP analogue CPT-cAMP or relaxin, a hormone that increases myometrial cell cAMP (21Hsu C.J. McCormack S.M. Sanborn B.M. Endocrinology. 1985; 116: 2029-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 B shows that PLCβ3 immunoprecipitated from cells exposed to CPT-cAMP or relaxin exhibited increased phosphorylation. After normalizing for the amount of PLCβ3 loaded, the treatments resulted in a 2-fold increase in PLCβ3 phosphorylation. A similar fold increase in PLCβ3 phosphorylation was recently reported in RBL-2H3 cells treated with CPT-cAMP (22Richardson R.M. Ali H. Pridgen B.C. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10690-10695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These data indicate that endogenous PLCβ3 can be phosphorylated in cells in response to elevated cAMP. Two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis with in vitro phosphorylated PLCβ3(His)6revealed that only serine was phosphorylated by PKA (Fig. 2 A). A similar result was also obtained with non-His-tagged recombinant PLCβ3phosphorylated by PKA in COSM6 cells (data not shown). Peptide mapping of in vitro phosphorylated PLCβ3(His)6 digested with Lys-C revealed one major phosphorylated peptide (Fig. 2 B). Importantly, an increase in phosphorylation of the same peptide (indicated by thearrow) was also detected in endogenous PLCβ3in PHM1 (Fig. 2, D versus C) and COSM6 cells (Fig. 2, F versus E) treated with CPT-cAMP as well as in overexpressed PLCβ3 in COSM6 cells coexpressing PKA catalytic subunit (Fig. 2, H versus G). In the case of overexpressed PLC and PKA (Panels G, H), there appears to be phosphorylation of another site in the basal state that decreases when the PKA site is phosphorylated. We are in the process of determining the residue phosphorylated and the functional significance of this site. Importantly, in all three cases, activation of PKA increases phosphorylation on the site that is phosphorylatedin vitro by PKA. To identify the sequence of the phosphopeptide, PLCβ3(His)6 was phosphorylated in vitro and subjected to Lys-C digestion. A fraction containing more than 60% of the incorporated 32P was isolated by reverse-phase HPLC and sequenced. The 32P-labeled peptide was identified as RHNS1105ISEAK (Fig. 3 A), in which more than 80% of Ser1105 was labeled, and no label was present in Ser1107. ∼30% of the 32P found in the HPLC flow-through appeared to be free phosphate, as judged by phosphoamino acid analysis (data not shown). To confirm the phosphorylation site and avoid contamination with endogenous PLCβ3, His-tagged PLCβ3(Ser1105 → Ala) mutant was constructed. This mutant was overexpressed in COSM6 cells, purified on a Ni-NTA column and phosphorylated by PKA in vitro. As shown in Fig. 3 B, mutation of Ser1105 to Ala reduced PKA phosphorylation of PLCβ3 by ∼90%. The small residual phosphorylation probably represents background, because it was also seen in extracts from cells transfected with empty vector and processed similarly (data not shown). We conclude from these studies that PKA phosphorylates PLCβ3 Ser1105 both in vivo and in vitro. Notably, this PKA phosphorylation site is not present in the corresponding sequences (20Jhon D. Lee H. Park D. Lee C. Lee K. Yoo O.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6654-6661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of PLCβ1 or PLCβ2 (Fig. 3 A). The C terminus of PLCβ1 is critical for activation by Gαq (23Kim C.G. Sue D.P. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21187-21192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Deletion studies have identified a P-box (Thr903 to Gln1030) and a G-box (Lys1031 to Leu1142) in this region. The P-box is essential for both PLCβ1 association with the cell membrane and its activation by Gαq, whereas the G-box is involved in association with Gαq subunit (24Wu D. Jiang H. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3704-3709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ser1105 of PLCβ3 falls in a region analogous to the G-box of PLCβ1. We therefore hypothesized that phosphorylation of Ser1105 by PKA might cause interference with Gαq-PLCβ3 association and thereby inhibit Gαq-stimulated PLCβ3 activity. To test this, PI turnover was studied in COSM6 cells transfected with Gαq and PLCβ3 or PLCβ3(Ser1105 → Ala) mutant in the absence and presence of PKA. As shown in Fig. 4 A, transfection of empty vector (rcCMV), Gαq, PLCβ3, or PLCβ3 (Ser1105 → Ala) mutant alone had no effect on basal PI turnover, suggesting that the proteins are primarily in their inactive forms under these conditions (25Wu D. Lee C.H. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1811-1817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cotransfection of Gαq with PLCβ3 produced a 5-fold increase in [3H]IP3, presumably because of the increased activation of PLCβ3 by Gαq as reported previously (26Jiang H. Kuang Y. Wu Y. Smrcka A. Simon M.I. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13430-13434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Notably, the PLCβ3 (Ser1105→ Ala) mutant was as effective as wild type at stimulating PI turnover. This indicates that the substitution of Ala for Ser1105 did not have a major effect on catalytic activity or G protein coupling. Importantly, when PKA catalytic subunit was also coexpressed, Gαq-stimulated [3H]IP3 formation associated with wild type PLCβ3 was inhibited by ∼58%, whereas no inhibition was observed with the PLCβ3 (Ser1105 → Ala) mutant. Increasing the amount of PKA catalytic subunit plasmid (0.5, 0.65, and 0.75 μg) resulted in a trend toward greater inhibition (58, 62, and 71%, respectively), although these values were not statistically different from each other (Fig. 4 B). These data demonstrate both that PKA indeed inhibits Gαq-stimulated PLCβ3 activity and that this effect requires the phosphorylation of Ser1105. More evidence in support of this contention was obtained in the RBL-2H3 cell line expressing only PLCβ3 (11Ali H. Fisher I. Haribabu B. Richardson R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11706-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). RBL-2H3 cells were transfected with the M1 muscarinic and oxytocin receptors shown to couple in other cell types to PLCβ through Gαq proteins (26Jiang H. Kuang Y. Wu Y. Smrcka A. Simon M.I. Wu D. J.

Kuang Y. Wu Y. Jiang H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16008-16010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Stimulation with the respective ligands resulted in a 4-fold increase in [3H]IP3, presumably through the coupling of the receptors to endogenous Gαq and PLCβ3. Importantly, pretreating cells with CPT-cAMP, previously shown to activate endogenous PKA and result in PLCβ3 phosphorylation (11Ali H. Fisher I. Haribabu B. Richardson R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11706-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), completely inhibited M1 and oxytocin receptor-stimulated PI turnover (Fig. 4 C). These data are consistent with our previous data in COSM6 and PHM1–41 cells (4Dodge K.L. Sanborn B.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2265-2271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In myometrial membranes, oxytocin-stimulated PI turnover was determined to be essentially completely Gαq-mediated (28Ku C.Y. Qian A. Wen Y. Anwer K. Sanborn B.M. Endocrinology. 1995; 124: 1509-1515Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Based on the position of Ser1105 in the enzyme, we hypothesize that its phosphorylation by PKA may perturb the association of PLCβ3 with Gαq. However, we do not know at present how Ser1105 phosphorylation affects the kinetic properties of Gαq/PLCβ3 coupling. It is also not yet clear what relationship this phosphorylation has to the reported inhibition of Gβγ-stimulated PLCβ3 activity by PKA (11Ali H. Fisher I. Haribabu B. Richardson R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11706-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These questions are under study. Interestingly, Ser954, one of the two putative PKA phosphorylation sites in PLCβ2, is located in the P-box. It has been suggested that PKA phosphorylation of that site may interfere with the membrane association of PLCβ2 (10Liu M. Simon M.I. Nature. 1996; 382: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The close proximity of Ser1105 to the P-box may allow PKA to affect the membrane association of PLCβ3 as well. Based on the ubiquitous expression of PLCβ3 (20Jhon D. Lee H. Park D. Lee C. Lee K. Yoo O.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6654-6661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), our observations could explain the inhibition of Gαq-stimulated PI turnover by PKA observed in a variety of cells and tissues (4Dodge K.L.

Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2265-2271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wen Y. Anwer K. Singh S.P. Sanborn B.M. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 1377-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) cannot be adequately addressed without knowing the cellular localization and relative contributions of these two isoenzymes to total PI turnover. Our data apparently contradict the reported inability of PKA to inhibit Gαq-coupled PAF receptor-stimulated PLCβ3 activity in RBL-2H3 cells (11Ali H. Fisher I. Haribabu B. Richardson R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11706-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The reason for this discrepancy is unknown at present but may reflect differences in the nature of specific receptor/G protein coupling in that cell line, differences in experimental design, or some other as yet unknown factor. Consistent with the findings reported here, we have found that coexpression of PKA catalytic subunit inhibits carbachol-stimulated PI turnover in COSM6 cells cotransfected with M1 muscarinic receptor and Gαq (4Dodge K.L. Sanborn B.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2265-2271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Gα15- and Gα16-stimulated endogenous PLCβ (β1 and β3) activity was not inhibited by PKA in COS7 cells (10Liu M. Simon M.I. Nature. 1996; 382: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). It is unclear how effectively the various G proteins stimulated PLCβ3 versusPLCβ1 in these cells. In reconstitution assays, Gα16 appears to be as effective as Gαq in stimulating PLCβ1 but less effective than Gαq in stimulating PLCβ3 (30Kozasa T. Hepler J.R. Smrcka A.V. Simon M.I. Rhee S.G. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9176-9180Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The relative contribution of PLCβ3 versusPLCβ1 to PI turnover and possible preferential coupling of Gαq subfamily isoforms to PLCβ3 may account for some of the observed differences. In summary, the data presented here establish a direct relationship between PKA-stimulated phosphorylation of Ser1105 and inhibition of PLCβ3 activity. This can at least partially explain the inhibitory effect of PKA on Gαq-coupled receptor-stimulated PI turnover observed in a variety of cells and tissues. We thank Drs. S. McKnight, M. Simon, J.

https://openalex.org/W1979495245,"Nociceptin and nociceptin receptor, which show structural similarities to opioid peptides and opioid receptors, respectively, have been recently found to constitute a novel neuromodulatory system. In the brain, however, the physiological role of the modulation via the nociceptin receptor is still unclear. Administered nociceptin produces hyperalgesia and hypolocomotion, whereas the nociceptin receptor-knockout mice show no significant abnormalities in nociceptive thresholds and locomotion. To clarify possible involvement of the nociceptin receptor in the regulation of nociception and locomotion, we made use of the knockout mice and naloxone benzoylhydrazone (NalBzoH) identified originally as a ligand for opioid receptors. Experiments on the cultured cells transfected with the nociceptin receptor cDNA showed that NalBzoH competed with [3H]nociceptin binding and attenuated the nociceptin-induced inhibition of cAMP accumulation. Furthermore, behavioral studies demonstrated that NalBzoH completely inhibited nociceptin-induced hyperalgesia and hypolocomotion. It is therefore likely that NalBzoH can act as a potent antagonist for the nociceptin receptor in vivo. In wild-type mice, NalBzoH induced antinociception but did not affect locomotor activity. In contrast, in the knockout mice, no significant changes in nociception and locomotion were induced by NalBzoH. These results clearly suggest that the nociceptin system takes part in the physiological regulation of nociceptive thresholds but not in the basal modulation of locomotion."
https://openalex.org/W1994792016,"Aerolysin is a pore-forming toxin that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Aeromonas hydrophilainfections. In this study, we have analyzed the effect of aerolysin on human granulocytes (HL-60 cells). Proaerolysin could bind to these cells, was processed into active aerolysin, and led to membrane depolarization, indicating that granulocytes are potential targets for this toxin. Fura-2 measurements were used to analyze the effect of aerolysin on cytosolic [Ca2+] homeostasis. As expected for a pore-forming toxin, aerolysin addition led to Ca2+influx across the plasma membrane. In addition, the toxin triggered Ca2+ release from agonist and thapsigargin-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores. This Ca2+ release was independent of the aerolysin-induced Ca2+ influx and occurred in two kinetically distinct phases: an initial rapid and transient phase and a second, more sustained, phase. The first, but not the second phase was sensitive to pertussis toxin. Activation of pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins appeared to be a consequence of pore formation, rather than receptor activation through aerolysin-binding, as it: (i) was not observed with a binding competent, insertion-incompetent aerolysin mutant, (ii) had a marked lag time, and (iii) was also observed in response to other bacterial pore-forming toxins (staphylococcal α-toxin, streptolysin O) which are thought to bind to different receptors. G-protein activation through pore-forming toxins stimulated cellular functions, as evidenced by pertussis toxin-sensitive chemotaxis. Our results demonstrate that granulocytes are potential target cells for aerolysin and that in these cells, Ca2+ signaling in response to a pore-forming toxin involves G-protein-dependent cell activation and Ca2+ release from intracellular stores.

However, different receptors were found on different cells types and a given cell type was found to have more then one receptor.

Binding to the cell surface presumably leads to a local increase in toxin concentration thereby enabling aerolysin to polymerize into a heptameric complex that inserts into the membrane and forms a water-filled channel (6Howard S.P.

In nucleated mammalian cells, the mechanisms leading to cell death appear to be more complex. We have indeed recently found that subnanomolar doses of aerolysin do not induce lysis of baby hamster kidney cells (14Abrami L. Fivaz M. Buckley J.T. Parton R.G. van der Goot F.G. J. Cell. Biol. 1998; 140: 525-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Permeabilization but not disruption of the plasma membrane was observed followed by selective vacuolation of the endoplasmic reticulum (14Abrami L. Fivaz M. Buckley J.T. Parton R.G. van der Goot F.G. J. Cell. Biol. 1998; 140: 525-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Only several hours later could a loss of plasma membrane integrity be observed. It is at present not clear whether the pores formed by the toxin at the plasma membrane are the sole cause of the observed effects. These findings, however, do suggest that aerolysin may trigger a cascade of events from the plasma membrane. In this study, we have analyzed the effects of aerolysin on human granulocytes. We show that, in addition to formation of pores in the plasma membrane, aerolysin triggered, through activation of a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein, chemotaxis, and release of Ca2+from intracellular stores. Cell culture media were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Paisley, Scotland), U73122 from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA), and DiSC3(5), PBFI, and fura-2/AM from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma or Fluka. The “Ca2+-free medium” contained: 143 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1 mmMgSO4, 5.6 mm glucose (0.1%), 20 mm HEPES pH 7.4, and 0.1 mm EGTA. The “Ca2+ medium” consisted of Ca2+-free medium supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2. HL-60 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), andl-glutamine (2 mm) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. Granulocytic differentiation was initiated by addition of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) (final concentration 1.3% for 3 days, then 0.65% for 1 or 2 days). Wild type and variant proaerolysins were purified as described previously (19Buckley J.T. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Concentrations were determined by measuring the optical density (O.D.) at 280 nm, considering that a 1 mg/ml sample has an O.D. of 2.5 (20van der Goot F.G. Hardie K.R. Parker M.W. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30496-30501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proaerolysin was labeled with 125I using IODO-GEN reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturers recommendations.125I-Proaerolysin was separated from the free iodine by gel filtration on a PD10-G25 column (Pharmacia, Sweden) equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline. We consistently obtained a specific activity of about 2 × 106 cpm/μg of proaerolysin.125I-Proaerolysin ran as a single band on an SDS gel. Aerolysin was obtained by treating proaerolysin with trypsin at a protein to enzyme ratio of 1/20 (mol:mol) for 10 min at room temperature. After which a 10-fold excess of trypsin inhibitor was added. HL-60 granulocytes at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml in Ca2+medium were incubated with 125I-proaerolysin for 25 min at 4 °C, spun down in a table top cell centrifuge for 8 min at 1600 rpm, resuspended in the same volume of buffer. The last washing step was performed twice. In competition experiments,125I-proaerolysin and the unlabeled wild type or mutant toxin were added to the cells simultaneously. For SDS-PAGE analysis, cells were briefly sonicated with a tip sonicator in sample buffer. SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). HL-60 granulocytes were washed once and resuspended in buffer containing 20 mmHEPES pH 7.4, 143 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, to a final density of 3 × 106 cells/ml. DiS-C3(5) (100 μmin Me2SO) was added to a final concentration of 200 nm. Membrane incorporation of the dye was monitored spectrofluorimetrically using a Photon Technology International fluorometer equipped with a thermostated cuvette holder (excitation 625 nm; emission 670 nm; 10 nm slits). After reaching a steady state fluorescence, the toxin was added. Maximal depolarization was obtained at the end of each experiment by adding pre-mixed valinomycin and nigericin to final concentrations of 2 and 5 μm, respectively (22Kasner S.E. Ganz M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F462-F467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Single fluorescent traces were expressed as the ratio I(t)/I max,i.e. fluorescence intensity at a given time over maximal fluorescence intensity. HL-60 granulocytes were washed once and resuspended in loading medium, containing 20 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 5.6 mm glucose, 143 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 0.25 mm sulfinpyrazone, to a final density of 20 × 106 cells/ml (22Kasner S.E. Ganz M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F462-F467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with the cell-permeant form of the K+-binding benzofuran isophtalate dye PBFI-AM (stock solution in Me2SO in presence of pluronic acid F-127, final concentrations of 5 μm PBFI and 0.02% F-127) for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by 30 min at room temperature, washed once and resuspended in the same buffer, in the absence of bovine serum albumin, to a final density of 2 × 106 cells/ml. Fluorescence measurements were performed using a Photon Technology International fluorometer. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 343 and 460 nm, respectively (37 °C). Variations of intracellular K+contents were expressed as a fraction of PBFI maximal intensity. HL-60 granulocytes were washed once and resuspended in 20 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 5.6 mm glucose, 143 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1 mmMgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, to a final density of 20 × 106 cells/ml. Ethidium homodimer-1 (stock solution 2 mm in Me2SO/water, 1:4) or ethidium bromide (stock solution 10 mg/ml in water) were added to a final concentration of 6 nm and 100 μm, respectively. Aerolysin-induced ethidium homodimer-1 or ethidium bromide entry was monitored by measuring the increase of fluorescence intensity at 600 nm, upon excitation at 500 or 340 nm, respectively. Single fluorescent traces were normalized to maximal fluorescence obtained by the addition of 1% Triton X-100. [Ca2+]c was measured with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fura-2. Cells (2 × 107/ml) suspended in Ca2+ medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin were loaded for 45 min at 37 °C with 2 μm fura-2/AM, then diluted to 107/ml and kept on ice. Just before use, a sample of loaded cells (2 × 106/ml) was centrifuged and resuspended in the desired medium. Fluorescence measurements were performed on a Perkin-Elmer fluorometer (LS3, Perkin-Elmer), thermostated at 37 °C. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 340 and 505 nm, respectively. Calibration was performed for each cuvette by sequential addition of 2 mm Ca2+ (for Ca2+-free medium), 1 μm ionomycin to measure Ca2+ saturated fura-2 (F max), followed by 24 mm EGTA, 75 mm Tris, pH 9.3, and 0.1% Triton X-100 to measure Ca2+ free fura-2 (F min). A relatively small leakage of fura-2 occurred in cells exposed to aerolysin (see “Results”). Results are shown as relative fura-2 fluorescence, normalized with respect to the maximal fluorescence (=100%) and minimal fluorescence (=0%) values obtained through the calibration procedure. At an excitation wavelength of 360 nm, fura-2 fluorescence is Ca2+ independent, the fluorescence of the probe is, however, quenched by several divalent cations. In this study, we used this feature of the probe to study entry of Mn2+ and Ni2+ in response to aerolysin independently from changes in [Ca2+]c. Cell-associated fluorescence before addition of the respective divalent cation was defined as 100% fluorescence. For the quantitation of the Mn2+ influx at different times after aerolysin addition, we proceeded as described previously (23Demaurex N. Monod A. Lew D. Krause K.-H. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, the percentage of fluorescence quenching that occurred within 1 min after Mn2+ addition was determined. The relatively small fraction of the fluorescence quenching that was due to the presence of extracellular fura (see below) was subtracted. The emission wavelength was 505 nm. To determine the amount of extracellular fura-2, we exposed fura-2-loaded cells for various times to aerolysin, followed by the addition of 25 μm Mn2+ and, 1 min later, 100 μm of the heavy metal chelator diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid. Under these conditions, the fraction of the Mn2+-induced fluorescence quenching that is immediately reversible after addition diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid is a direct measure of extracellular fura-2 (23Demaurex N. Monod A. Lew D. Krause K.-H. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For the chemotaxis assay, a Transwell® chemotaxis chamber (6.5 mm diameter, 3 μm pore size, Corning Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) was used. In this system, the cell reservoir (=upper chamber) is separated from the target chamber (=lower chamber) by a microporous membrane. The cell reservoir contained 106cells in 100 μl of Ca2+ buffer with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The target chamber contained the indicated concentration of chemoattractant or the appropriate solvent control in 500 μl of Ca2+ buffer with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Chemotaxis was allowed to occur over a period of 90 min in an CO2 (5%) and temperature (37 °C)-controlled incubator. Cells in the target chamber were counted. Results are expressed as cells recovered in the target chamber (% of cells that were initially added in the cell reservoir). As a first step in the characterization of the interaction of proaerolysin with myeloid cells, we have investigated whether proaerolysin was able to bind to HL-60 promyelocytes and HL-60 granulocytes. Cells were incubated with 1 nm proaerolysin at 4 °C for 10 min, washed, sedimented, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis for the presence of the toxin. Both wild type proaerolysin as well as a double cysteine mutant, G202C/I445C (see below), were able to bind to both types of HL-60 cells (not shown). To investigate whether binding of proaerolysin was specific, we have analyzed whether radiolabeled and unlabeled proaerolysin could compete for binding to HL-60 cells. Binding of radiolabeled proaerolysin (4 nm) to both promyelocytic and granulocytic HL-60 could be inhibited by more than 80% by the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled toxin (0.4 μm), indicating the presence of a limited number of binding sites. Binding of radiolabeled wild type toxin could also be inhibited, to the same extend, by unlabeled G202C/I445C mutant toxin, indicating that both forms of the toxin bind to the same sites. These observations suggest that aerolysin binds to a limited number of sites on HL-60 cells. Using a previously described proaerolysin overlay assay (14Abrami L. Fivaz M. Buckley J.T. Parton R.G. van der Goot F.G. J. Cell. Biol. 1998; 140: 525-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), we could identify 4 proaerolysin-binding proteins (not shown). Binding to these proteins could be inhibited by 70% by treating the cells with the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C indicating that these putative receptors were GPI anchored (not shown). These four proteins remain to be identified. We could, however, exclude that binding occurred via Thy-1, which was shown to be a receptor for aerolysin on T-lymphocytes (11Nelson K.L. Raja S.M. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12170-12174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), since HL-60 do not express this protein to any significant extent (24Schlossman S.F. Boumsel L. Gilks W. Harlan J.M. Kishimoto T. Morimoto C. Ritz J. Shaw S. Silverstein R. Springer T. Tedder T.F. Todd R.F. Leukcocyte Typing V. White Cell Differentiation Antigens. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 154Google Scholar). The presence of multiple receptors on HL-60 granulocytes is reminiscent of what was observed in rat brain, were at least two receptors were found, Thy-1 and contactin (13Diep D.B. Nelson K.L. Raja S.M. Pleshak E.N. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2355-2360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and on baby hamster kidney cells were three putative GPI-anchored receptors were seen of, respectively, 140, 80, and 30 kDa, the 80-kDa protein being the major proaerolysin-binding protein (14Abrami L. Fivaz M. Buckley J.T. Parton R.G. van der Goot F.G. J. Cell. Biol. 1998; 140: 525-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To investigate whether HL-60 granulocytes are sensitive to aerolysin, we have analyzed the effect of the toxin on membrane potential using the fluorescent probe DiSC3(5) which has been widely used for this purpose (25Papini E. Sandona D. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3353-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, proaerolysin led to depolarization of the granulocytes with kinetics that were dose-dependent. As suspected, a marked increase in the rate of depolarization was observed when activating the protoxin prior to the addition to the cells (Fig. 1 B). As shown in Fig. 1 C, depolarization was in part due to the efflux of K+. As a control, we tested the hemolytically inactive mutant of aerolysin, G202C/I445C. This mutant contains two engineered cystein residues that form a disulfide bridge between the propeptide and the mature toxin (20van der Goot F.G. Hardie K.R. Parker M.W. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30496-30501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Even after trypsin activation, this mutant is unable to lyse erythrocytes presumably because it cannot oligomerize. Also G202C/I445C did not induce K+ efflux from HL-60 granulocytes. Surprisingly, depolarization of HL-60 granulocytes as well as K+ efflux followed two-step kinetics for reasons that remain to be established. In contrast, kinetics of membrane depolarization induced by the thiol-activated toxin streptolysin O were monophasic (not shown). The observed K+ efflux and membrane depolarization were not due to lysis of the cells as illustrated by the fact that most cells still exclude ethidium homodimer-1 after 10 min (Fig. 1 D). Faster kinetics of entry were observed with the smaller dye ethidium bromide indicating that a sieving mechanism was taking place. This observation suggests that the dye enters the cells through the aerolysin pore and not through a breach in the plasma membrane since in the latter case no discrimination in size would be expected. We can therefore conclude that aerolysin led to selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane and not to cell lysis within the time frame of the present experiments. Aerolysin was also able to induce membrane depolarization and K+ efflux in HL-60 promyelocytes, although the kinetics were dramatically slower then those observed for granulocytes (not shown). Since membrane depolarization could be observed not only when treating the cells with aerolysin but also with proaerolysin, albeit at far slower rate, we investigated whether HL-60 granulocytes expressed proteases able to process the protoxin. As shown in Fig. 2, although the protoxin added to the cells showed no sign of contamination by aerolysin (lane a), a lower molecular weight form corresponding to aerolysin could be observed upon interaction with the granulocytes. A higher molecular weight band could also be observed upon incubation at 37 °C corresponding to the aerolysin heptamer (Fig. 2). These results agree well with our previous observations that proaerolysin can be converted into aerolysin by proteases provided by the host cell (14Abrami L. Fivaz M. Buckley J.T. Parton R.G. van der Goot F.G. J. Cell. Biol. 1998; 140: 525-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). 2▪. Abrami, M. Fivaz, and F. G. van der Goot, unpublished data. These observations show that proaerolysin and aerolysin are able to bind to HL-60 cells and that the cells express proteases that can process the protoxin to its mature form. This allows heptamerization of the toxin and channel formation thereby leading to efflux of intracellular potassium, presumably to concomitant sodium entry, and membrane depolarization. To investigate whether the interaction of aerolysin with myeloid cells led to changes in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c), we exposed fura-2 loaded HL-60 promyelocytes and HL-60 granulocytes to either proaerolysin or trypsin-activated aerolysin (Fig. 3). Both, the protoxin and the mature toxin induced elevation of [Ca2+]c in a dose-dependent manner and this in both cell types. The kinetics of the [Ca2+]c increase were, however, markedly faster when the mature toxin was added rather than its precursor as previously observed for membrane depolarization (Fig. 3,A and C versus B and D). Also, the effects of both the pro and the mature toxin were more pronounced on the differentiated granulocytic HL-60 cells then on the immature promyelocytic cells. No changes in [Ca2+]c could be observed upon addition of the hemolytically inactive G202C/I445C mutant when added either in the pro or the mature form (Fig. 3 D). A striking feature of the aerolysin-induced [Ca2+]c elevations was their complex kinetics. Rather than presenting a monophasic increase, as might be expected for the insertion of a pore into the membrane, the kinetics were multiphasic: an initial, relatively rapid phase of [Ca2+]c change was followed by a more sustained phase. Thus, the toxin-induced Ca2+ response in myeloid cells was dose-dependent, accelerated by preactivation of the toxin, and depended on the state of differentiation of the cells. As the responses were most pronounced in HL-60 granulocytes stimulated with the mature toxin, these conditions were used to further analyze the mechanisms underlying the complex [Ca2+]cresponse to aerolysin. To investigate the source of the aerolysin-induced [Ca2+]c elevations, we exposed HL-60 granulocytes to aerolysin in a Ca2+-free medium. Under these conditions only Ca2+ release from intracellular stores can be detected, but not Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane. As shown in Fig. 4 A, aerolysin (100 ng/ml) was able to induce [Ca2+]c elevations in a Ca2+-free medium, demonstrating that the toxin triggered Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. The observed [Ca2+]c elevations had complex kinetics. An initial phase peaked and decayed after approximately 40–60 s. A prolonged phase which increased toward a plateau could be observed 1–3 min after toxin addition. The binding competent, insertion-incompetent mutant G202C/I445C did not induce Ca2+-release (Fig. 4 A). However, when added in excess, the mutant was able to preclude Ca2+ release in response to wild type aerolysin (Fig. 4 B) confirming that the two variants of the toxin have the same acceptor sites on the cell and that they are limited in number. Many agonists induce Ca2+ release from intracellular stores through phospholipase C (PLC)-mediated Ins(1,4,5)P3generation and Ins(1,4,5)P3-induced Ca2+release from intracellular stores. To test whether PLC activation is involved in the aerolysin-induced Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, we have used the PLC inhibitor U73122. As shown in Fig. 4 C, this compound inhibited the initial phase of the aerolysin-induced Ca2+ release, however, neither the late phase of the Ca2+ release, nor the Ca2+ influx observed after Ca2+ readdition were affected. For many granulocyte agonists, Ca2+ release from intracellular stores is due to a G-protein-mediated activation of phospholipase C. In contrast to what is observed on many other cellular systems, agonist-PLC coupling in leukocytes is generally mediated by pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins (26Krause K.H. Schlegel W. Wollheim C.B. Andersson T. Waldvogel F.A. Lew P.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1348-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the effect of pertussis toxin pretreatment on aerolysin-induced Ca2+release in the HL-60 granulocytes. As shown in Fig. 5, pertussis toxin pretreatment inhibited the initial, rapid phase of aerolysin-induced Ca2+ release (Fig. 5 D), but not the second, slower, phase (Fig. 5 E), nor the calcium entry across the plasma membrane. These results demonstrate an activation of pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins through aerolysin. The results obtained with pertussis toxin (Fig. 5) and the PLC inhibitor (Fig. 4), however, also demonstrate that there is a second phase of Ca2+ release which does not involve the G-protein/PLC/Ins("

A., Ren, J.-M., Marshall, B. A., Gao, J., Hansen, P. A., Holloszy, J. O., and Mueckler, M. (1994)J. Biol. Chem. 269, 18366–18370). This study examined the relationship between glucose transport and cell-surface glucose transporter content in isolated skeletal muscle from wild-type and GLUT1-overexpressing mice using 2-deoxyglucose, 3-O-methylglucose, and the 2-N-[4-(1-azi-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)benzoyl]-1,3-bis(d-mannos-4-yloxy)-2-propylamine exofacial photolabeling technique. Insulin (2 milliunits/ml) stimulated a 3-fold increase in 2-deoxyglucose uptake in extensor digitorum longus muscles of control mice (0.47 ± 0.07 μmol/ml/20 min in basal muscle versus 1.44 μmol/ml/20 min in insulin-stimulated muscle; mean ± S.E.). Insulin failed to increase 2-deoxyglucose uptake above basal rates in muscles overexpressing GLUT1 (4.00 ± 0.40 μmol/ml/20 min in basal muscle versus 3.96 ± 0.37 μmol/ml/20 min in insulin-stimulated muscle). A similar lack of insulin stimulation in muscles overexpressing GLUT1 was observed using 3-O-methylglucose. However, the magnitude of the insulin-stimulated increase in cell-surface GLUT4 photolabeling was nearly identical (∼3-fold) in wild-type and GLUT1-overexpressing muscles. This apparently normal insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 in GLUT1-overexpressing muscle was confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy. Our findings suggest that GLUT4 activity at the plasma membrane can be dissociated from the plasma membrane content of GLUT4 molecules and thus suggest that the intrinsic activity of GLUT4 is subject to regulation.

A line of transgenic mice that overexpress human GLUT1 in skeletal muscle has been described (8Marshall B.A. Ren J.-M. Johnson D.W. Gibbs E.M. Lillquist J.S. Soeller W.C. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M. J.

These mice exhibit reduced fasting and fed plasma glucose concentrations in the absence of altered levels of pancreatic hormones and a marked increase in the rate of glucose clearance following an oral glucose load (8Marshall B.A. Ren J.-M.

The enhanced glucose clearance can be explained by a large increase in basal glucose transport activity that is accompanied by an increase in muscle glucose metabolism (9Ren J.-M.

In addition, skeletal muscles from these transgenic mice exhibit a loss of insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity (8Marshall B.A. Ren J.-M. Johnson D.W. Gibbs E.M. Lillquist J.S. Soeller W.C.

This defect is not a generalized resistance to insulin action, as stimulation of System A amino acid transport activity by insulin in muscles overexpressing GLUT1 is normal (10Gulve E.A. Ren J.-M.

In addition, the impaired activation of glucose transport in GLUT1-overexpressing muscle is not limited to the effects of insulin, as the response to hypoxia and contractions, two stimuli that activate muscle glucose transport by an insulin-independent mechanism (17Lund S.

The muscles of the GLUT1 transgenic mice express a normal complement of total cellular GLUT4 protein, but the functional status of the GLUT4 has not been determined. GLUT4 translocation is a common step in the activation of glucose transport by all these stimuli (12Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Wardzala L.J. Horton E.D. Horton E.S. J. Biol.

It therefore seemed likely that a defect in translocation of GLUT4 could be the mechanism responsible for the impaired stimulation of glucose transport in GLUT1-overexpressing muscle. The purpose of this study was to examine glucose transport and glucose transporter localization under basal and insulin-stimulated conditions in skeletal muscle to determine if GLUT4 translocation is impaired in the GLUT1 transgenic mice. We found that GLUT4 translocates to plasma membrane domains in a normal fashion in muscles of the GLUT1 transgenic mice, despite the absence of any stimulation of glucose transport by insulin. These data indicate that GLUT4 activity at the plasma membrane can be dissociated from the plasma membrane content of GLUT4 molecules and thus suggest that the intrinsic activity of GLUT4 is subject to regulation.

The minigene in this construct contains a 2.47-kilobase cDNA fragment encoding the human GLUT1 glucose transporter under the regulation of the 1.2-kilobase rat myosin light chain-2 promoter. Expression of the transgene is restricted to skeletal muscle and does not affect expression of the GLUT4 isoform. Animals were housed in a room maintained at 23 °C with a fixed 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.) and given free access to Purina chow and water. All sugar transport and photolabeling experiments were performed using fed mice. Animals were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (5 mg/100 g of body weight), and epitrochlearis and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles were excised for incubation. Muscles were incubated for 30 min at 35 °C in 2 ml of oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer (KHB) supplemented with 8 mm glucose, 32 mm mannitol, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin in the absence or presence of a maximally effective concentration of insulin (2 milliunits/ml). Muscles were then transferred to KHB containing 40 mm mannitol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and insulin (if it was present in the previous incubation medium) for 10 min at 30 °C to remove glucose from the extracellular space. The gas phase throughout the incubation was 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Glucose transport activity was measured as described previously (24Hansen P.A. Gulve E.A. Marshall B.A. Gao J. Pessin J.E. Holloszy J.O.

Following the wash, muscles were incubated for 20 min in 1.0 ml of KHB containing 1 mm 2-deoxy-d-[1,2-3H]glucose (1.5 μCi/ml), 39 mm [U-14C]mannitol (0.2 μCi/ml), 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and insulin at the same concentration used in the previous incubations. The gas phase was 95% O2 and 5% CO2, and the temperature was maintained at 30 °C. In other experiments, glucose transport activity was measured at 20 °C using 8 mm3-O-[3H]methyl-d-glucose (2.2 μCi/ml), 32 mm [U-14C]mannitol (0.2 μCi/ml), and 0.1% bovine serum albumin in the presence or absence of insulin. The extracellular space and intracellular 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) and 3-O-methyl-d-glucose (3-MG) concentrations (μmol/ml of intracellular water) were determined as described previously (25Young D.A Uhl J.J.

Cell-surface GLUT1 and GLUT4 were assessed using the ATB-[3H]BMPA exofacial photolabeling technique as described previously (13Lund S. Holman G.D. Schmitz O. Pedersen O.

EDL muscles were incubated as described above for the transport experiments in the presence or absence of 2 milliunits/ml insulin and then further incubated in the dark at 18 °C for 8 min in KHB containing 750 μCi/ml ATB-[3H]BMPA. Muscles were irradiated for 1 min using a mercury vapor lamp (450 watts; Conrad Hanovia) and then manually turned and irradiated for another 1 min. Following irradiation, muscles were immediately blotted and clamp-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Preparation and solubilization of total crude membranes were carried out as described by Lund et al.

Solubilized membrane protein was incubated with rotation for 2 h at room temperature with a GLUT1-specific polyclonal antibody (G1 674A) coupled to protein A-Sepharose. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was subjected to overnight incubation (4 °C) with protein A-Sepharose coupled to a GLUT4-specific polyclonal antibody (G4 829). All immune pellets were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 0.14m NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, and 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) containing 0.2% C12E9 (nonaethylene glycol mono-n-dodecyl ether) and twice with PBS. The precipitated proteins were eluted from the Sepharose with sample buffer (10% SDS, 6m urea, and 10% β-mercaptoethanol) and subjected to SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were briefly fixed in methanol/water/acetic acid (50:40:10, v/v/v) and then sliced by lane into 8-mm slices. The gel slices were dried, dissolved in 30% H2O2 and 2% NH4OH, and subjected to liquid scintillation counting. Transporter labeling, expressed as dpm/g of muscle (wet weight), was determined by summing the radioactivity in all slices comprising the peak and subtracting the average radioactivity of the slices adjacent to the peak (background). Mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (5 mg/100 g of body weight). The right soleus muscle was removed (basal) and fixed by incubation in 3% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 2 h. Mice were then given glucose (2 g/kg of body weight) and insulin (6 units) by intraperitoneal injection. After 30 min, the left soleus muscle (insulin) was dissected and fixed as described above. After fixation, the tissues were rinsed with PBS and distilled water and stained en bloc with 0.5% uranyl acetate for 30 min at 4 °C. The tissues were dehydrated through graded ethanol: 30% for 10 min at 4 °C, 50% for 1 h at −20 °C, 70% for 1 h, 95% for 1 h, and 100% for 2 h with three changes, all at −45 °C. The tissues were embedded in Lowricryl HM-20 and polymerized under 360-nm UV light for 1 day at −45 °C, 1 day at −35 °C, and 1 day at room temperature under sunlight. The cut thin sections were picked on nickel grids coated with polyvinyl formal film. The nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubating sections with 5% goat serum for 15 min and 2% gelatin for 10 min. The sections were washed with PBS and then incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by six washes in PBS and then incubation with colloidal gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 30 min at room temperature. To determine levels of nonspecific labeling, preimmune IgG was substituted for the primary antibody, or the primary antibody was saturated with a 10-fold molar excess of the peptide used to raise the antibody. The grids were then stained with 4% uranyl acetate for 20 min and Reynold's lead solution for 50 s and examined in a Zeiss 902 electron microscope. Immunogold labeling density was determined in micrographs of longitudinal sections, with each sarcomere defined as the basic quantification unit. Quantification of labeling in the region of the sarcolemma was based on the number of gold particles observed per 2-μm length. Nonspecific background labeling either using preimmune IgG or by competition with excess immune peptide was extremely low under the optimal conditions described above (<1% of the specific labeling for either GLUT1 or GLUT4). Rates of basal and insulin-stimulated 2-DG uptake in EDL muscles isolated from wild-type and GLUT1 transgenic mice are shown in Fig. 1. In agreement with previous findings (8Marshall B.A. Ren J.-M. Johnson D.W. Gibbs E.M. Lillquist J.S. Soeller W.C. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18442-18445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Ren J.-M. Marshall B.A. Gulve E.A.

Insulin caused a 2.7-fold increase in 2-DG uptake in EDL muscles from nontransgenic mice; however, 2-DG uptake was not increased in response to insulin in EDL muscles overexpressing GLUT1 (4.0 ± 0.4 μmol of 2-DG/ml/20 min in basal muscle versus 3.9 ± 0.4 μmol of 2-DG/ml/20 min in insulin-stimulated muscle). We have previously demonstrated in GLUT1-overexpressing muscle that (a) 2-DG uptake is linear for at least 30 min under the experimental conditions used in this experiment (10Gulve E.A. Ren J.-M. Marshall B.A. Gao J. Hansen P.A. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18366-18370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and (b) when the total intracellular concentration of 2-DG is <20 mm, <2% of the total intracellular 2-DG is present in the unphosphorylated form (26Hansen P. Gulve E. Gao J. Schluter J. Mueckler M. Holloszy J.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C30-C35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).1 Thus, even in the muscles of the GLUT1 transgenic mice, the rate of 2-DG uptake should accurately reflect glucose transport activity (27Hansen P.A. Gulve E.A. Holloszy J.O. J. Appl. Physiol. 1994; 76: 979-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). However, to confirm our findings with 2-DG, additional skeletal muscle glucose transport activity measurements were performed using the nonmetabolizable glucose analog 3-MG. As shown in Fig. 2, basal rates of 3-MG transport in the GLUT1 transgenic animals were increased ∼7-fold in the epitrochlearis muscle and ∼9-fold in EDL muscle. Insulin increased 3-MG transport 2.5–2.6-fold in the epitrochlearis and EDL muscles from nontransgenic mice; the 2.6-fold increase in 3-MG transport in the EDL muscle is in close agreement with the 2.7-fold increase measured using 2-DG in this same muscle (see Fig. 1). Insulin had no effect on the rate of 3-MG transport in either the epitrochlearis muscle or the EDL from the GLUT1 transgenic mice. Intracellular 3-MG concentrations under basal and insulin-stimulated conditions were ∼2.0–2.3 μmol/ml of intracellular water in both muscle types following a 12-min incubation with 8 mm 3-MG. Since the rate of 3-MG uptake ordinarily becomes nonlinear when the intracellular concentration of 3-MG attains ∼25% of the extracellular concentration (25Young D.A Uhl J.J. Cartee G.D. Holloszy J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16049-16053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was possible that the linear phase of 3-MG uptake was exceeded during the 12-min assay period. Therefore, we performed an additional experiment in which basal and insulin-stimulated 3-MG transports were measured in GLUT1-overexpressing muscles using a shorter measurement period (4 min). Under these conditions, the intracellular 3-MG concentration remained well below 25% of the equilibrium value. As shown in Fig. 3, initial rates of 3-MG transport following treatment with insulin were not significantly different from basal rates of transport in either the epitrochlearis or EDL muscles overexpressing GLUT1.Figure 3Basal and insulin-stimulated 3-methylglucose uptake in isolated skeletal muscles from GLUT1 transgenic mice.Epitrochlearis and EDL muscles were treated exactly as described in the legend to Fig. 2, except that muscles were incubated with 3-MG for 4 min.

Chem. 1994; 269: 29956-29961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and there is a normal level of total GLUT4 protein expressed in the muscles of the GLUT1 transgenic mice, we examined the possibility that GLUT4 translocation in insulin-stimulated muscle is defective in the GLUT1 mice. To test this hypothesis, we assessed basal and insulin-stimulated cell-surface glucose transporter content in EDL muscles from the GLUT1-overexpressing mice and nontransgenic littermates using the exofacial photoaffinity label ATB-[3H]BMPA. GLUT1 labeling in the basal state was ∼40-fold higher in EDL muscles from transgenic animals compared with control littermates (Fig. 4, upper panel). GLUT1 labeling was not increased by insulin in muscles from either GLUT1 transgenic mice or nontransgenic controls. Insulin stimulated a 3.2-fold increase in GLUT4 labeling in EDL muscles from the wild-type mice (Fig. 4, lower panel). Surprisingly, an insulin-stimulated increase in labeled GLUT4 was also observed in muscles from the GLUT1-overexpressing mice. Absolute labeling (dpm/g (wet weight)) following insulin treatment was slightly higher in muscles from the transgenic mice compared with the wild-type mice, but because GLUT4 labeling in the basal state was also slightly higher in muscles from these mice, the fold increase in cell-surface GLUT4 induced by insulin was similar in the transgenic mice and nontransgenic controls. A second experimental approach was used to assess the subcellular distribution of GLUT4 following insulin treatment of muscle from wild-type and GLUT1-overexpressing mice. Ultrathin sections prepared from soleus muscles isolated prior to (basal) or 30 min following intraperitoneal administration of insulin were stained with an antibody specific for the COOH terminus of GLUT4 followed by a 12-nm colloidal gold-conjugated secondary antibody. The distribution of GLUT4 protein in muscle of the wild-type mice is nearly identical to that reported previously in skeletal muscle of the GLUT4-overexpressing mice (11Wang W. Hansen P.A. Marshall B.A. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 415-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In wild-type muscle, most of the GLUT4 labeling in the basal state was located in the vicinity of the muscle triads, especially in the terminal cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Table I). Lesser labeling was observed in vesicles beneath the sarcolemma. Following insulin treatment, the number of gold particles at the cell surface in wild-type muscle was nearly doubled; an increase in GLUT4 labeling was observed both in the sarcolemma (2-fold) and in the T-tubule membranes (∼60%) (Table I). The distribution of GLUT4 in unstimulated muscle overexpressing the GLUT1 isoform did not appear different from that seen in wild-type muscle. Insulin-stimulated changes in the GLUT4 labeling pattern in muscles overexpressing GLUT1 were nearly identical to those seen in wild-type muscle. GLUT4 labeling was increased ∼2-fold in both the sarcolemma (Fig. 5and Table I) and T-tubule membranes (Fig. 6 and Table I). Thus, the results of the immunogold labeling studies are consistent with the findings of the ATB-[3H]BMPA labeling experiments, i.e. the magnitude of the insulin-stimulated increase in GLUT4 at the cell surface in muscle overexpressing the GLUT1 isoform was not different from that observed in wild-type muscle.Table ISubcellular distribution of GLUT4 in soleus muscle of GLUT1 transgenic miceGroup"

These include atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), β-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC), and skeletal muscle (SkM)-α-actin. By using luciferase reporter plasmids, we examined whether oncogenes that activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase cascade (srcF527, Ha-rasV12, and v-raf) increased expression of “fetal” genes. Transfection of myocytes withsrcF527 stimulated expression of ANF, SkM-α-actin, and β-MHC by 62-, 6.7-, and 50-fold, respectively, but did not induce DNA synthesis. Stimulation of ANF expression bysrcF527 was greater than by Ha-rasV12, which in turn was greater than by v-raf. General gene expression was also increased but to a lesser extent. The response to srcF527 was inhibited by dominant-negative Ha-rasN17. Myocyte area was increased by srcF527, Ha-rasV12, and v-raf, and although it altered myocyte morphology by causing a pseudopodial appearance,srcF527 did not detectably increase myofibrillogenesis either alone or in combination with Ha-rasV12. A kinase-dead src mutant increased myocyte size to a much lesser extent thansrcF527 and also did not inhibit ANF-luciferase expression in response to phenylephrine. We conclude that members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases may be important in mediating the transcriptional changes occurring during cardiac myocyte hypertrophy and that Ras and Raf may be downstream effectors.

We conclude that members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases may be important in mediating the transcriptional changes occurring during cardiac myocyte hypertrophy and that Ras and Raf may be downstream effectors. The cardiac myocyte is a terminally differentiated cell that withdraws from cell division at around birth in mammals. In these cells, adaptive hypertrophic growth in response to an increased requirement for contractile power involves increases in cell size, protein content, and myofibrillar organization (reviewed in Ref. 1Chien K.R. Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). There are also changes in gene transcription that distinguish hypertrophy from maturational growth (eutrophy). In response to hypertrophic stimuli, cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes initiate a rapid and transient increase in expression of immediate early genes (c-jun, c-fos, and Egr-1), followed by the re-expression of so-called “fetal” genes including atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), 1The abbreviations used are: ANF, atrial natriuretic factor; β-gal, β-galactosidase; β-MHC, β-myosin heavy chain; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; DN, dominant-negative; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; LUX, luciferase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK (or ERK) kinase; PBS, Dulbecco's Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline; SkM-α-actin, skeletal muscle α-actin; SRE, serum responsive element; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; PE, phenylephrine. 1The abbreviations used are: ANF, atrial natriuretic factor; β-gal, β-galactosidase; β-MHC, β-myosin heavy chain; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; DN, dominant-negative; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; LUX, luciferase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK (or ERK) kinase; PBS, Dulbecco's Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline; SkM-α-actin, skeletal muscle α-actin; SRE, serum responsive element; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; PE, phenylephrine. β-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC), and skeletal muscle (SkM) α-actin. More chronic exposure to hypertrophic agonists also elicits an increase in the expression of constitutively expressed contractile protein genes such as ventricular myosin light chain-2 and cardiac muscle α-actin. Many of these changes are seen during hypertrophy of the rat heart in vivo, providing a justification for the use of this model system (reviewed in Ref. 1Chien K.R. Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S.

Recent evidence shows that A-Raf is also activated synergistically by oncogenic ras and oncogenicsrc, whereas oncogenic ras alone is sufficient for maximal activation of B-Raf (44Marais R. Light Y.

In terms of the hypertrophic response, there is good evidence for a role for activated Ras. Thus, angiotensin II activates Ras in myocytes (45Sadoshima J. Izumo S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar); injection of oncogenic RasV12 initiates hypertrophic changes in myocytes (46Thorburn A. Thorburn J. Chen S.Y. Powers S.

Recent work has suggested that protein tyrosine kinases of the Src family (Src, Fyn, Lyn, etc.) may participate in the coupling of both receptor protein tyrosine kinases and G protein-coupled receptors to ERK activation (reviewed in Refs. 47Cooper J.A.

Indeed, a role for Fyn has been proposed in angiotensin II-induced hypertrophy of the cardiac myocyte (45Sadoshima J. Izumo S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Here we have examined the effect of overexpression ofsrcF527, an oncogenic variant of the c-src protooncogene, on the transcriptional and morphological characteristics associated with the hypertrophic phenotype in cardiac myocytes. We show thatsrcF527 expression potently activates genes that are up-regulated in response to hypertrophic stimuli, a response in which it may act in concert with Ras and Raf. Our results suggest that non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases such as c-Src may play a role in some of the altered growth responses of myocytes exposed to hypertrophic stimuli. Sprague-Dawley rats were bred within the National Heart and Lung Institute. Culture medium and other reagents were from Sigma, Life Technologies, Inc., or Merck. The plasmids encoding constitutively active v-Raf and Ha-RasV12 and dominant-negative (DN) Ha-RasN17 and DNRaf were from Professor C. J. Marshall, and those encoding chicken SrcF527 and kinase-dead mutants of c-Src (srcK−) and SrcF527(srcF527K−) were from Dr. R. M. Marais (both at the Chester Beatty Laboratories, Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK). In SrcF527 the tyrosine residue at position 527 is mutated to phenylalanine rendering it insensitive to phosphorylation and inactivation by the tyrosine kinase Csk.

The LUX reporter plasmids have been described in detail previously (57Gillespie-Brown J. Fuller S.J. Bogoyevitch M.A. Cowley S. Sugden P.H. J. Biol.

Ventricular myocytes were isolated from the hearts of 1–2-day-old rats by a modification of the method of Iwaki et al. (60Iwaki K. Sukhatme V.P. Shubeita H.E. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13809-13817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as detailed previously (57Gillespie-Brown J. Fuller S.J. Bogoyevitch M.A. Cowley S. Sugden P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28092-28096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Transfections (by the calcium phosphate method) involved the addition of 5 or 15 μg of LUX reporter plasmid, 2 or 4 μg of pON249, and a total of up to 10 μg of test plasmids to 60-mm cell culture dishes containing 1 million cells. For sarcomeric staining, transfections involved the addition of 6 μg of ANF-LUX reporter plasmid, 1.6 μg of pNG1, and 2 μg each of test plasmids to 100,000 cells per well of a 2-well chamber slide. Phenylephrine (PE), when present, was added to a concentration of 10–100 μm (as stated in individual experiments) approximately 20 h after the transfection. After a further 48 h, myocytes were extracted and assayed for LUX and β-gal as detailed previously (57Gillespie-Brown J. Fuller S.J. Bogoyevitch M.A. Cowley S. Sugden P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28092-28096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. of experiments on at least four separate preparations of myocytes. To assess the area of transfected myocytes, cells were washed three times with ice-cold Dulbecco's Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, re-washed three times with PBS, and then stained with 0.2 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, 5 mm K4Fe(CN)6, 5 mmK3Fe(CN)6, 2 mm MgCl2in PBS. Transfected (blue) cells were randomly selected from all areas of the dishes and imaged using a video hardcopier from which the cell area was determined by planimetry. Myocytes were cultured in Permanox 2-well chamber slides pretreated with gelatin (1%) and laminin (20 μg/ml). After fixing as for cell sizing, cells were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS (10 min, room temperature), and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 10% horse serum in 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS (10 min, room temperature). Antibodies were diluted in 10% horse serum in 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS, and myocytes were washed three times in PBS between all stages of the immunofluorescence procedure. Nuclearly localized β-gal was detected using a mouse polyclonal anti-β-gal primary antibody (Sigma, 1/200 dilution, 1 h at 37 °C), a biotinylated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 1/200 dilution, 30 min at 37 °C) and streptavidin-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid (Boehringer Mannheim, 1/400 dilution, 15 min at 37 °C). β-MHC was subsequently detected by staining with a mouse monoclonal anti-β-MHC primary antibody (Novacastra, 1/50 dilution, 1 h at 37 °C) and a Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 1/100 dilution, 30 min at 37 °C). To assess DNA synthesis, myocytes were treated with 0.1 mm bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) for 24 h prior to fixing and permeabilizing as above. All subsequent blocking and antibody incubation steps were carried out in 1% bovine serum albumin in 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS. BrdUrd was detected with a mouse monoclonal anti-BrdUrd antibody (clone BU-33, Sigma, 1/500 dilution), followed by a biotinylated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody and streptavidin-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid as above. β-Gal was detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Organon Teknika, 1/200 dilution) and a Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 1/100 dilution). The absolute values of chemiluminescence differs considerably between the various reporter constructs. Thus, in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, results are expressed as the ratio of reporter gene expression in the presence ofsrcF527, v-raf, and Ha-rasV12 expression plasmids relative to empty vector controls. This facilitates comparison of the relative potencies of the expression plasmids. Results are presented as means ± S.E. For statistical analysis, absolute values of chemiluminescence were used, and significance was assessed by using an unpaired or paired Student's t test as appropriate with a significant difference taken as being established at p < 0.05.Figure 2Stimulation of SkM-α-actin-, c-fos-SRE-, and β-MHC promoter activity by v-raf, Ha-rasV12, andsrcF527. Neonatal cardiac myocytes were transfected with LUX reporter plasmids for SkM-α-actin, c-fos-SRE, and β-MHC (15 μg/dish), pON249 (4 μg/dish), and 5 μg each of v-raf (in a pEXV3 vector), Ha-rasV12 (in a pEXV3 vector),srcF527 (in a pEF vector), or their backbone vector control as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After a further 48 h the cells were extracted and assayed for LUX and β-gal expression. The results are the means ± S.E. from four separate myocyte preparations and are expressed as LUX activities (panels A, C, and E) or LUX/β-gal activity ratios (panels B, D, and F), relative to transfections with control vectors. Absolute values of LUX (in counts per 4 s) in controls for v-raf and Ha-rasV12 (pEXV3) were 9437 ± 1193 (panel A), 2023 ± 458 (panel C), and 320 ± 66 (panel E). Absolute values for LUX in controls for srcF527 (pEF) were 21,361 ± 1003 (panel A), 4629 ± 605 (panel C), and 2314 ± 319 (panel E).

The results are the means ± S.E. from four separate myocyte preparations and are expressed as LUX/β-gal activity relative to controls (CON). Statistical significance is as follows: a, p < 0.02 versuscontrol; b, p < 0.05; c, p < 0.01versus srcF527.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The proximal 638 base pairs of the ANF promoter are sufficient to confer tissue specificity and inducible expression on the LUX reporter (7Knowlton K.U. Baracchini E. Ross R.S. Harris A.N. Henderson S.A. Evans S.M. Glembotski C.C. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7759-7768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection withsrcF527, a constitutively active oncogenic mutant of c-src, stimulated expression of this construct by 62.3 ± 10.3-fold (Fig. 1,panel A). This was significantly greater (p < 0.01) than the stimulation of ANF-LUX by oncogenic Ha-rasV12 (18.0 ± 2.7-fold). Co-transfection with srcF527 and Ha-rasV12 stimulated ANF-LUX expression by 106.1 ± 21.0-fold which was significantly greater than transfection with Ha-rasV12 alone (p < 0.01) but was not significantly greater than transfection with srcF527 alone (Fig. 1,panel A). When LUX expression was normalized for β-gal expression (Fig. 1, panel B), the effect ofsrcF527 (7.2 ± 0.8-fold) was still significantly greater (p < 0.02) than activation by Ha-rasV12 (3.7 ± 0.7-fold). Again, the combined effect of srcF527 and Ha-rasV12 (8.3 ± 1.3-fold) was significantly greater than that of Ha-rasV12alone (p < 0.025) but was not significantly greater than that of srcF527 alone. Since transfection efficiency using the calcium phosphate method is routinely about 2% and independent of the plasmids transfected (57Gillespie-Brown J. Fuller S.J. Bogoyevitch M.A. Cowley S. Sugden P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28092-28096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), the reduction in the magnitude of the responses when normalized to β-gal is a consequence of a global stimulation of gene expression. This is manifest by the activation of β-gal expression despite it being driven by the constitutive cytomegalovirus promoter. Thus, the fold induction of β-gal was 4.7 ± 1.1, 7.7 ± 1.7, and 11.6 ± 3.0 for Ha-rasV12, srcF527, and Ha-rasV12 plussrcF527-transfected cells, respectively.srcF527 is therefore a more potent activator of ANF expression than is Ha-rasV12 and, like oncogenic ras (53Abdellatif M. MacLellan W.R. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15423-15426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), srcF527 also has a powerful effect on gene expression in general. Similar conclusions can be drawn from experiments using a LUX reporter responsive to the activation of the AP-1 transcription factor complex (Fig. 1,panels C and D). This reporter has very low basal activity in cardiac myocytes compared with the ANF-LUX transgene, accounting for the greater variability in stimulation when expressed as fold induction by srcF527 and Ha-rasV12. The specific activation of the ANF and AP-1 reporter genes bysrcF527 and Ha-rasV12shown here contrasts with the reported (53Abdellatif M. MacLellan W.R. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15423-15426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) lack of a specific effect of rasR12 on other reporter genes (SkM-α-actin, cardiac-α-actin, and β-MHC) whose up-regulation is also associated with the hypertrophic phenotype. To determine whether this was a peculiarity of the ANF and AP-1 transgenes, the effects ofsrcF527 and Ha-rasV12were extended to include some of these alternative marker genes of hypertrophy (Fig. 2). The SkM-α-actin-LUX transgene was up-regulated 7.8-fold by Ha-rasV12 and 6.7-fold bysrcF527 (Fig. 2, panel A). However, there was only a slight (1.9-fold) activation of the SkM-α-actin-LUX/β-gal ratio (Fig. 2, panel B) indicating that SkM-α-actin transcription was not dramatically activated above the general increase in transcription. By using a c-fos-SRE transgene, a similar conclusion was reached for the effect of Ha-rasV12 (2.3-f"

Like Cdc6p, MCM (mini chromosomemaintenance) family of proteins are also implicated in the regulation of initiation of DNA replication. There are six polypeptides in this family (MCM2–7) and homologs identified in human,Drosophila, Xenopus, and S. pombe (5Dutta A. Bell S.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

CDC45 protein in yeast is present at a constant level throughout the cell cycle and localized in nucleus (18Hopwood B. Dalton S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12309-12314Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). CDC45, MCM, and CDC6 proteins together form a complex necessary for the initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. CDC45 protein is homologous to Tsd2, a protein that is required for DNA replication inUstilago maydis (22Onel K. Holloman W.K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 253: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We have identified and cloned a human homolog of yeast CDC45and Tsd2 genes. The CDC45L mRNA level increases during G1-S transition, but the amount of protein is unchanged throughout the cell cycle. Consistent with a role of the protein in the initiation of DNA replication, it is physically associated with human ORC2L protein, and its affinity for a nuclear structure diminishes as DNA replication proceeds during S phase. The gene is located in chromosome 22q11.2 in the minimal region that is deleted in DiGeorge syndrome. DiGeorge syndrome is associated with congenital cardiac abnormalities, hypocalcemia arising from parathyroid hypoplasia, and primary immunodeficiency arising from thymic aplasia. The phenotype may arise from defects in the development of the pharyngeal arches and pouches during embryogenesis (23Morrow B. Goldberg R. Carlson C. Dasgupta R. Sirotkin H. Collins J. Dunham I.

Kucherlapati R. Genomics. 1997; 42: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Several genes have been identified in the minimal region (2 megabases) commonly deleted. These include a putative transcription factor TUPLE1 (TUP-like enhancer of split gene 1), a potential adhesion receptor protein, a serine threonine kinase DGS-G, and a few genes of unknown function. CDC45L is the first gene consistently deleted in DiGeorge syndrome that may be directly involved in cell proliferation. The EST data base was searched withS. cerevisiae CDC45 nucleotide sequence to look for homologous sequence in human. Two human EST clones had significant matches (T34235 and T31599). The EST clones were obtained from Research Genetics, Inc. Sequencing of the two clones were performed, and the sequences of both clones were the same. The sequence has been deposited in GenBankTM (accession number AF053074) and is the same as another sequence submitted while this manuscript was under review (GenBankTM accession number AJ223728). CDC45L cDNA was cloned into pRSET-C plasmid (Invitrogen) between BamHI and XhoI sites, and the protein was expressed as His6tag in E. coli. The overexpressed protein was purified over nickel-agarose affinity column and used for raising polyclonal antiserum in rabbit (Cocalico Biologicals Inc.). For expressing GST-tagged CDC45L in mammalian cells, pEBG-CDC45L was created by cloning the cDNA into BamHI and KpnI sites of pEBG plasmid (26Saha P. Eichbaum Q. Silberman E.D. Mayer B.J. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4338-4345Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Fluorescence in situhybridization (FISH) was carried out as described (27Ney P.A. Andrews N.C. Jane S.M. Safer B. Purucker M.E. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Goff S.C. Orkin S.H. Nienhuis A.W. Mol. Cell.

HeLa cells were synchronized at mitosis with 50 ng/ml nocodazole (Aldrich) for 24 h. For synchronization in G1-S HeLa cells were blocked with 2 mm thymidine for 12–14 h, released into thymidine-free medium for 12 h, and blocked again with 1 mmhydroxyurea for 12–14 h. The subcellular fractionation was done as described before (28Krude T. Jackman M. Pines J. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1997; 88: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). A PstI and XhoI fragment of CDC45L was used to probe the Northern blots. The sequences of the two clones are identical. The 1.86-kilobase cDNA has one long open reading frame, which encodes a protein of 566 amino acids having a theoretical molecular mass of 64 kDa. The polypeptide is highly homologous to CDC45p of S. cerevisiae (27.6% identical and 52% similar) and Tsd2p of U. maydis (26.8% identical and 49.5% similar). As shown in Fig. 1, there is significant homology over the entire length of the human protein with CDC45 and Tsd2. Like the fungal proteins, the human contains a stretch of acidic amino acids (136–166) and a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal (156–172) (Fig. 1). The newly identified protein has no significant sequence homology with any other protein in the data base. Considering its high homology with the yeast CDC45 and Tsd2, we identify the protein as human homolog of the yeast CDC45 (CDC45L). Northern blot analysis of the mRNA from HeLa cells synchronously released from a mitotic block shows that the level of CDC45L mRNA appears at G1-S phase transition (indicated by the increased cyclin E expression and diminished cyclin B expression (29Lew D.J. Dulic V. Reed S.I. Cell. 1991; 66: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 30Pines J. Hunter T. Nature. 1990; 346: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar)) and decreases in mitosis (indicated by the increased expression of cyclin B message) (Fig. 2 A). GAPDH mRNA serves as the loading control. The polyclonal antiserum produced against bacterially expressed His6-tagged CDC45Lp specifically recognizes the bacterially expressed antigen and recombinant CDC45Lp expressed in Hi5 insect cells by baculovirus infection (Fig. 2 B). In mammalian cell extract the antiserum recognizes a 60-kDa protein band close to the theoretical size of CDC45L. Western blot analysis of the protein extracts of HeLa cells at various stages of cell cycle shows that although the cells cycle normally (as indicated by the cyclins A and B), the total level of CDC45Lp is unchanged throughout the cell cycle (Fig. 2 C). RPA1 protein is used as a loading control. Subcellular fractionation of asynchronously growing human osteosarcoma U2OS cells indicated that CDC45L protein is present in both the cytosolic and nuclear fractions. Blocking of cells at G1-S phase by aphidicolin (Fig. 2 D, lanes 2 and5) or hydroxyurea (Fig. 2 E, 0 h lane) showed that a significant fraction of the protein was associated with the nuclear fraction. However, blocking of cells in mitosis with nocodazole reveals that the CDC45L protein is now mostly absent from the nuclear fraction (Fig. 2 D, lanes 3 and6). MCM7 protein follows a similar pattern. Thus, like MCM proteins, the affinity of CDC45L protein to a nuclear tether is significantly diminished as DNA replication proceeds. To follow the decrease in nuclear affinity of CDC45Lp during S phase in greater detail, HeLa cells were released from a hydroxyurea block and fractionated at various time points (Fig. 2 E). Pulse labeling with [3H]thymidine indicates that S phase ends at 8 h after release from hydroxyurea block (not shown). Both MCM7p and CDC45Lp are progressively lost from the nuclear fraction as S phase proceeds. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen present in the nuclear fraction was relatively constant at the various time points and serves as a loading and fractionation control. The MCM7p appears to be lost from the nuclear fraction earlier than CDC45Lp, suggesting that the two proteins are released from the nuclear fraction by different mechanisms. The earlier release of human MCMp relative to CDC45Lp agrees well with the recently reported time of release of S. cerevisiae MCM and CDC45 proteins from chromatin (31Zou L. Stillman B. Science. 1998; 280: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Genetic and physical interactions of yeast CDC45 with yeast ORC2 led us to examine whether the human homologs were physically associated with each other. Because of the co-migration of untagged CDC45L protein with the immunoglobulin heavy chain, evidence for co-precipitation was sought with CDC45L protein tagged at the N terminus with a GST protein. GST-CDC45L (85 kDa) was expressed in 293T cells by transient transfection of EBG-CDC45L. Immunoprecipitation of cell extracts with anti-Orc2 antibody specifically co-precipitated the GST-CDC45L protein (as detected by immunoblotting with anti-GST) (Fig. 2 F, lanes 1 and 2). Conversely, affinity purification of GST-CDC45L from human cell extracts with glutathione agarose beads co-purified human ORC2L protein (lane 4). That this co-purification was because of the CDC45L protein was evidenced by the absence of ORC2L protein in precipitates of GST alone expressed from the EBG vector alone (lane 3). Using the cDNA probe of CDC45L for FISH on metaphase spreads, we mapped the CDC45Lgene at chromosome 22q11.2 and showed that one copy of the gene is deleted in patients with DiGeorge syndrome (Fig. 3). This region is frequently deleted in DiGeorge syndrome, Velocardiofacial syndrome, and related disorders and known as DGCR. Recently the entire 2 megabases of sequence in this DGCR was deposited in GenBankTM. By comparing the cDNA sequence of CDC45L with the genomic sequence of 22q11.2, we confirm that the gene is indeed within the DGCR and have generated the intron-exon boundaries ofCDC45L gene (Table I). The mRNA is transcribed from 19 exons spanned over a 30-kilobase region in the gene.Table ISequences of the exon-intron (HSA) CDC45LSequences of the introns are given in lowercase and those of exons are in uppercase. The numbers in the parentheses are nucleotide coordinates of the exon sequences assuming that the A of ATG is nucleotide 1. Open table in a new tab Sequences of the introns are given in lowercase and those of exons are in uppercase. The numbers in the parentheses are nucleotide coordinates of the exon sequences assuming that the A of ATG is nucleotide 1. In budding yeast CDC45 is an essential gene. The genetic and physical interactions of CDC45 protein with several ORC and MCM proteins suggest its involvement in the initiation of DNA replication. In cdc45-1 cells chromosome origins are fired less frequently at nonpermissive temperature. The overall model for initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication is that ORC is bound to replicator origins constitutively. In G1 phase other initiation factors like CDC6, MCM proteins, and CDC45 associate with the ORC at origins to form the licensed prereplicative complex. The S phase-promoting factors cyclin-Cdk and CDC7 kinase activate the prereplicative complex to initiate DNA replication and also induce the disassembly of initiation complex so that origins cannot be fired for a second time in the same S phase. The homologs of MCM proteins and four of the ORC proteins have been identified in human and other higher eukaryotes. We and others have identified human CDC6L (13Williams R.S. Shohet R.V. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar,14Saha P. Chen J. Thome K.C. Lawlis S.J. Hou Z.H. Hendricks M. Parvin J.D. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2758-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). So far no homolog of CDC45 in higher eukaryotes has been reported. In this report, we identified the human homolog of budding yeast CDC45. The high homology of the cloned cDNA with budding yeast CDC45 and a related protein Tsd2 inU. maydis justifies its identification as human CDC45L. The mRNA of CDC45L is highest at G1-S transition, consistent with the observation in yeast where message level decreases as cell population becomes budded from unbudded state (20Hardy C. Gene ( Amst. ). 1997; 187: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Like the yeast protein, the total protein level remains unchanged during the cell cycle. The selective decrease in affinity of CDC45L protein for a nuclear tether as S phase proceeds and the physical association with human ORC2L support a possible role of the protein in the initiation of DNA replication. Another intriguing observation is that CDC45L is located at Chromosome 22q11.2, which is frequently deleted in DiGeorge syndrome (DGS). In fact, one copy of CDC45L is deleted in DGS patients (Fig. 3). DGS is a developmental anomaly of the derivatives of third and fourth pharyngeal pouches in the embryo. It is associated with aplasia or hypoplasia of thymus and parathyroid glands and with conotruncal cardiac abnormalities. The majority of patients with DGS have deletion in 22q11. Other syndromes with a similar cytogenetic lesion include Shprintzen syndrome, which is marked by the craniofacial and palatal abnormalities, and Takao syndrome, which has mostly cardiac anomalies. Several genes have been identified in the DGCR, including a putative transcription factor, a receptor for adhesion molecule, a serine-threonine kinase, and several proteins with unknown functions (25Sirotkin H. Morrow B. Saint J.B. Puech A. Das G.R. Patanjali S.R. Skoultchi A. Weissman S.M. Kucherlapati R. Genomics. 1997; 42: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The presence of a number of genes in the common deleted region and variability in the phenotypes raised the possibility that the phenotype may be attributed to more than one gene encompassed by a deletion. CDC45L is the first gene identified in the DGCR that is directly required for cell division. The loss of one copy ofCDC45L may selectively impair cell proliferation in specific tissues during specific developmental stages. Alternatively, mutations, polymorphisms, or changes in methylation status of the remaining allele of CDC45L may result in limiting quantities of the protein being produced in specific tissues resulting in hypoproliferation and the observed developmental anomalies. At this point we cannot rule out the alternative possibility that CDC45L is a bystander gene, which is deleted because of its close proximity to some other gene whose loss is primarily responsible for the DGS phenotype and that deletion of one copy of CDC45L has no effect on cell proliferation or on development. Future experiments will examine the status of the intact allele of CDC45L in DGS patients and will also be directed at determining the phenotype of mice with only one copy of CDC45L selectively deleted by homologous recombination. In summary, we have identified a human homolog of budding yeast CDC45p and U. maydis Tsd2p, which are involved in DNA replication initiation. The RNA level of CDC45L increases at G1-S transition point, but protein level remains constant throughout the cell cycle. However, association of the protein with ORC2L and diminished association with a nuclear tether as S phase proceeds support a role of the protein in the initiation of mammalian DNA replication. The gene is located in DGCR, and one copy ofCDC45L is deleted in DGS, raising the possibility that this loss may contribute to the phenotype of DGS."

In this study, we investigated the role of NF-κB for TNF-α-triggered cell death in the widely used mouse cell line L929 by various approaches. Inhibition of the mitochondrial permeability transition by bongkrekic acid impaired TNF-α-induced cell death without affecting the activity of NF-κB. The reduction of NF-κB-mediated gene expression by the synthetic steroid dexamethasone was associated with a decrease in TNF-α-mediated cell killing, suggesting that NF-κB does not protect L929 cells from TNF-α-induced cell death. This concept was reinforced by experiments employing L929 cell lines stably overexpressing a transdominant negative form of IκB-α. These cell lines were unable to activate NF-κB and to inducibly express the IL-6 gene, but they showed the same susceptibility toward TNF-α-mediated cell death as L929 wild-type cells.

The cytokine TNF-α 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; BA, bongkrekic acid; DEX, dexamethasone; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide. plays a pivotal role in a variety of inflammatory, immunological, and pathological processes. Two well-studied receptors for TNF-α are TNF-R55 and TNF-R75. These receptors belong to the rapidly growing family of TNF receptors, including the recently discovered LT-β receptor, DR3/WSL-1/TRAMP, RANK, and TRAIL (for reviews, see Refs. 1Wallach D. Boldin M. Varfolomeev E. Beyaert R. Vandenabeele P. Fiers W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholarand 2Baker S.J. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of the extracellular ligand leads to trimerization of the receptors and association of numerous cytoplasmic proteins to the intracellular receptor domain. This binding is induced by ligation of the TNF-R55 or clustering of the intracellular C-terminal domains, which are sufficient for the induction of cell death, which coincides with the activation of transcription factor NF-κB (3Vandevoorde V. Haegeman G. Fiers W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1627-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). NF-κB is normally retained in its inactive state in the cytoplasm of cells by interaction with an inhibitory IκB molecule (for review, see Ref. 4Sha W.C. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Triggering of cells with a variety of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, induces phosphorylation, ubiquitinylation, and degradation of IκB (for reviews, see Refs. 5Stancovski I. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 91: 299-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar and 6Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11758-11760Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This allows the DNA-binding dimer to enter the nucleus, to bind to its cognate DNA, and to induce the transcription of its target genes (for a review, see Ref. 7Siebenlist U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: 7-13PubMed Google Scholar). The target genes encode a variety of proteins involved in immune responses, cell growth, and apoptosis. Among those are the anti-apoptotic proteins Mn-superoxide dismutase, the zinc finger protein A20, and c-IAP2 (8Chu Z.L. McKinsey T.A. Liu L. Gentry J.J. Malim M.H. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10057-10062Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that the activation of NF-κB can counteract TNF-α-induced cell death (for a review, see Ref. 9Baichwal V.R. Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R94-R96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fibroblasts from mice lacking the transactivating p65 subunit are more sensitive against the cytopathic effect of TNF-α than fibroblasts from p65+/+ mice (10Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). The inhibition of NF-κB in various cell types by stable overexpression of a transdominant negative form of IκB-α renders those cells more susceptible to cell killing by TNF-α (11Liu Z.-G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar, 12Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S.

Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2449) Google Scholar). However, NF-κB has also apoptosis-promoting activities. Expression of high levels of the NF-κB subunit c-Rel in bone marrow cells leads to apoptosis and autophagocytic cell death (14Abbadie C. Kabrun N. Bouali F. Smardova J. Stehelin D. Vandenbunder B. Enrietto P.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 899-912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the overexpression of the viral and cellular anti-apoptotic proteins E1B 19K and Bcl-2 impairs NF-κB-dependent transactivation (15Grimm S. Bauer M.K. Baeuerle P.A. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 16Schmitz M.L. Indorf A. Limbourg F.P. Staedtler H. Traenckner E.B. Baeuerle P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4052-4063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the impact of NF-κB activation on TNF-α-mediated cell killing in murine L929 fibrosarcoma cells. This widely used cell line is of particular interest because TNF-α-induced cell death occurs without co-apoptotic stimuli, such as cycloheximide or actinomycin D. Using several different strategies, we demonstrated that TNF-α-triggered cell killing and activation of transcription factor NF-κB are uncoupled in L929 cells. Murine L929sA fibrosarcoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin. All cells were grown in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The plasmid RSV-IκB-α S32/36A was obtained by inserting theHindIII fragment from the plasmid CMV-IκB-α S32/36A (17Traenckner E.B. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar) into the HindIII site of a eukaryotic RSV expression vector. The NF-κB-dependent reporter gene construct p(IL6κB)350hu.IL6 was described previously (18Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Boone E. De Bosscher K. Schmitz M.L. Fiers W. Haegeman G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3285-3290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). The plasmids were purified on CsCl gradients, and the L929 cells were transfected with CaCl2 as described (16Schmitz M.L. Indorf A. Limbourg F.P. Staedtler H. Traenckner E.B. Baeuerle P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4052-4063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stably transfected cells were selected in 200 μg/ml G418 for several weeks. Murine L929sA cells were stimulated with recombinant TNF-α (Boehringer Mannheim) for 20 min at the indicated concentrations, washed twice with cold TBS buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm MgCl2), and scraped off with a rubber policeman. After centrifugation for 3 min at 3000 rpm, the total cellular proteins were extracted from the pellet by resuspension in TOTEX buffer (20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.9, 0.35 mNaCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The tubes were incubated on ice for 30 min, and equal amounts of the protein contained in the supernatant were tested for NF-κB DNA binding activity as described (19Hehner S.P. Heinrich M. Bork P.M. Vogt M. Ratter F. Lehmann V. Schulze-Osthoff K. Dröge W. Schmitz M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1288-1297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, the proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) using a semidry blot apparatus (Bio-Rad). The detection of IκB-α proteins was done as described (19Hehner S.P. Heinrich M. Bork P.M. Vogt M. Ratter F. Lehmann V. Schulze-Osthoff K. Dröge W. Schmitz M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1288-1297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). For the determination of luciferase activity, the cells were washed with isotonic buffer and lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (Tropix, Bedford, MA). The luciferase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) and quantified in a Duo Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (Berthold, Wildbad, Germany). The cytotoxic activity of TNF-α was determined by the colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay essentially as described (20Mosmann T. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46517) Google Scholar). L929sA cells were grown at a density of 1 × 104 cells per well in 96-well microtiter plates. Following the addition of TNF-α (2000 units/ml) and/or the indicated substances, 20 μl of a MTT solution (5 mg/ml PBS) was added to all wells at the times given in the figure legends. After another 3-h incubation, supernatants were removed, followed by the addition of 100 μl of a 24:1 (v/v) isopropyl alcohol-HCl solution for 15 min. The absorbance of each well was determined with an automated plate reader (Digiscan, Asys Hitech, Eugendorf, Austria) at 550 nm. The IL-6 concentrations were determined with an anti-human IL-6 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To study the linkage between TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation and cell death in L929 cells, we investigated the effect of BA, which prevents the generation of mitochondrial permeability transition pores during the apoptotic process (21Marchetti P. Castedo M. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Hirsch T. Macho A. Haeffner A. Hirsch F. Geuskens M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1155-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). The addition of 50 μm BA clearly decreased the cytotoxic effects of various concentrations of TNF-α on L929 cells (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, the TNF-α-induced DNA binding activity of NF-κB was not influenced by BA at various concentrations (Fig. 1 B). The influence of BA on TNF-α-stimulated NF-κB-dependent transcription was tested by adding BA, TNF-α, or a combination of both to a pool of L929 cells stably transfected with a NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter gene. BA was unable to influence the basal or TNF-α-induced transactivation by NF-κB (Fig. 1 C). These results suggest that it is possible to reduce cytotoxicity without affecting NF-κB activation in L929 cells. A protective role of NF-κB for TNF-α-induced cell killing would imply that the inhibition of this transcription factor should result in enhanced cell killing. Therefore, we investigated the effects of DEX on cell death and NF-κB-dependent gene expression induced by TNF-α. L929 cells stably transfected with a NF-κB-dependent reporter gene were treated with different combinations of TNF-α and DEX as indicated (Fig. 2 A). The TNF-α-induced gene expression was significantly impaired by DEX, a known inhibitor of NF-κB gene expression (22Ray A. Prefontaine K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Previous reports attributed the inhibitory effect of glucocorticoids to the increased production of the inhibitory IκB-α molecule, which then would dissociate NF-κB from its cognate DNA (23Auphan N. DiDonato J.A. Rosette C. Helmberg A. Karin M. Science. 1995; 270: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2163) Google Scholar, 24Scheinmann R.I. Cogswell P.S. Lofquist A.K. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1995; 270: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar). To test whether this proposed mechanism also applies to L929 cells, the influence of DEX on TNF-α-activated NF-κB was tested by EMSAs. As seen in Fig. 2 B, DEX had no effect on the DNA binding activity of NF-κB. The same extracts were assayed for the relative levels of IκB-α in Western blot experiments. Short-time treatment of cells with TNF-α resulted in the induced degradation of IκB-α, which was resynthesized after 2 h (Fig. 2 B). Treatment of cells with DEX had no impact on the relative levels of IκB-α at any time point, suggesting that DEX interferes in L929 cells with NF-κB-mediated transactivation rather than detectably influencing the IκB-α levels. The effect of DEX on TNF-α-induced cell death was tested by adding DEX, TNF-α, or a combination of both to the cells. When cell viability was measured after various incubation times (Fig. 2 C), it was found that DEX significantly protected the L929 cells from cell death, indicating that NF-κB activation does not protect this cell line from TNF-α-induced cell death. In order to inhibit NF-κB in a highly specific way, L929 cells were stably transfected with the plasmid RSV-IκB-α S32A/S36A, an expression vector encoding a transdominant negative human IκB-α mutant. Because serines 32 and 36 in this mutant were changed to alanines, the inducible phosphorylation and subsequent degradation was prevented, thus conferring an increased half-life to this IκB-α form (17Traenckner E.B. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Several L929 cell clones were tested for the expression of IκB-α protein in Western blot experiments (Fig. 3 A). Three of the cell clones (2D1, 3A6, and 3B1) were found to constitutively express the transdominant negative form of human IκB-α, which migrates slightly slower than the endogenous murine IκB-α protein from L929 cells. L929 control cells that were stably transfected with the empty expression vector did not contain this slower migrating IκB-α band (Fig. 3 A). These IκB-α-overexpressing cell clones were further characterized by testing the TNF-α-induced DNA binding activity of NF-κB by EMSAs. The induced DNA binding capacity of all IκB-α-overexpressing clones was strongly impaired when compared with L929 control cells (Fig. 3 B and data not shown). The effect of IκB-α overexpression on the transcription of the endogenous NF-κB target gene IL-6 was tested by measuring the TNF-α-triggered production of this cytokine. In contrast to the L929 control cells, treatment of the three IκB-α-overexpressing cell clones with TNF-α did not result in strongly elevated IL-6 levels (Fig. 4 A). In summary, these results demonstrate that the L929 cell clones 2D1, 3A6, and 3B1 are unable to significantly activate the transcriptional activity of NF-κB. However, TNF-α killed these cell clones with the same efficiency and kinetics as the L929 control cells (Fig. 4 B), indicating that NF-κB activation neither activates nor represses TNF-α-mediated cell killing, thus establishing that both events are unrelated and uncoupled in L929 cells.Figure 4TNF-α-induced IL-6 production and cell killing of IκB-α-overexpressing cell clones.

A representative experiment is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The role of NF-κB in the regulation of apoptosis does not yield a homogeneous picture yet. There are numerous examples showing apoptosis-promoting as well as apoptosis-antagonizing effects of NF-κB activation (for a review, see Ref. 9Baichwal V.R. Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R94-R96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some inducers of cell death, such as TNF-α, directly activate NF-κB; others may influence κB-dependent gene expression by alternative pathways. In this respect, it was shown that an activated form of Caspase-3 can cleave the unphosphorylated IκB-α protein, which leads to the generation of a constitutive inhibitor of κB-dependent gene expression (25Barkett M. Xue D. Horvitz H.R. Gilmore T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29419-29422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The events leading to TNF-α-triggered cell death and NF-κB activation are initiated by the trimerization of the TNF receptor. This leads to the induced association of the intracellular TRADD protein and subsequent recruitment of further proteins, including TRAF-2 and MORT1/FADD. The molecular events leading to NF-κB activation and cell killing diverge relatively early in this signal cascade. The expression of a transdominant negative form of FADD inhibits TNF-R55-mediated cell death but not κB-dependent transcription (26Wajant H. Johannes F.-J. Haas E. Siemienski K. Schwenzer R. Schubert G. Weiss T. Grell M. Scheurich P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 113-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). TRAF-2-deficient mice display a functional NF-κB activation and an increased sensitivity to TNF-α, suggesting an additional NF-κB-independent pathway of cell protection that is mediated by TRAF-2 (27Yeh W.-C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F. Wakeham A. de la Pompa J.L. Ferrick D. Hum B. Iscove N. Ohashi P. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Immunity. 1997; 7: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that the TNF-α-triggered activation of NF-κB and the induction of cell death are uncoupled events in L929 cells. A protective role of NF-κB would imply that the inhibition of this transcription factor would lead to enhanced cell death. However, even the partial inhibition of NF-κB transactivation by DEX was accompanied by a decrease in cell killing. In the case of L929 cells, the DEX-mediated repression of NF-κB seems to be independent from up-regulation of IκB-α and can probably be attributed to the recently proposed repression of transactivation (28De Bosscher K. Schmitz M.L. Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Fiers W. Haegeman G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13504-13509Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Conversely, the activation of NF-κB does not promote killing of L929 cells, because BA allowed the full activation of NF-κB while reducing the cytotoxic effects of TNF-α. Evidence for the uncoupling of NF-κB activation and cytotoxicity in L929 cells was obtained by the unchanged susceptibilities to cell death in cell lines stably overexpressing a transdominant negative variant of IκB-α. The role of NF-κB as a promoter or attenuator of cell killing may therefore depend on the nature of the apoptosis-inducing stimulus as well as on the cell type. Accordingly, the inhibition of NF-κB activation by IκB-α overexpression did not alter the sensitivity of the human breast cancer cell line MCF7 toward TNF-α (29Cai Z. Körner M. Tarantino N. Chouaib S. J. Biol Chem. 1997; 272: 96-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), whereas the HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells and Jurkat T-cells were more susceptible to the detrimental effects of TNF-α (12Wang C.Y.

https://openalex.org/W2021853164,"Bm3R1 is a helix-turn-helix transcriptional repressor from Bacillus megaterium whose binding to DNA is inhibited by fatty acids and a wide range of compounds that modulate lipid metabolism. The inactivation of Bm3R1/DNA binding activity results in the activation of transcription of the operon encoding a fatty acid hydroxylase, cytochrome P450 102. The metabolic role of this operon is unknown. It is possible that it is involved in the synthesis of modified fatty acids as part of normal cellular metabolism or may represent a protective mechanism by which B. megateriumdetoxifies harmful foreign lipids. In this report we demonstrate that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) activate the transcription of the CYP102 operon. These PUFA are the most potent activators of the CYP102 operon observed to date, and we show that their effects are due to binding directly to Bm3R1. In addition, cultures that have been treated with the CYP102 inducer, nafenopin, are protected against PUFA toxicity. Resistance to PUFA toxicity is also seen in a Bm3R1-deficient strain that constitutively expresses CYP102. The resistant phenotype of this Bm3R1 mutant strain is reversed by specific chemical inactivation of CYP102. These data demonstrate that Bm3R1 can act as a direct sensor of toxic fatty acids and, in addition, provide the first direct evidence of fatty acids binding to a prokaryotic transcription factor."

The N-terminal domain has the characteristic fold of the class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. The unfolding of the N-terminal domain by urea at 25 °C under equilibrium conditions was monitored by its intensities of light emission at 330 and 350 nm, the ratio of these intensities, its ellipticity at 229 nm, and its partition coefficient, in spectrofluorometry, circular dichroism, and size-exclusion chromatography experiments, respectively. These experiments showed the existence of an equilibrium between the native dimeric state of the N-terminal domain, a monomeric intermediate state, and the unfolded state. The intermediate was compact and had secondary structure, and its tryptophan residues were partially buried. These properties of the intermediate and its inability to bind 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate showed that it was not in a molten globular state. The variation of free energy ΔG(H2O) and its coefficient m of dependence on the concentration of urea were, respectively, 13.8 ± 0.2 kcal·mol−1 and 0.9 ± 0.1 kcal·mol−1·m−1 for the dissociation of the native dimer and 13.9 ± 0.6 kcal·mol−1 and 2.5 ± 0.1 kcal·mol−1·m−1 for the unfolding of the monomeric intermediate.

The unfolding of proteins by denaturing agents under thermodynamic equilibrium conditions is useful to characterize their unfolding mechanism and to quantify their conformational stability. Most quantitative studies of unfolding have been performed on soluble monomeric proteins or on dimeric proteins that unfold according to a two-state mechanism, i.e. without an intermediate state between the native protein and the unfolded polypeptide (1Neet K.E. Timm D.E. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2167-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Very few quantitative studies have dealt with dimeric proteins that unfold through an intermediate, whether monomeric (2Cheng X. Gonzalez M.L. Lee J.C.

Moreover, many proteins of therapeutic interest are dimeric, and it is important to be able to compare their stability with those of engineered mutants. The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are divided into two classes. The 10 enzymes of class I are characterized by the common fold of their catalytic domain and the existence of two conserved sequence motifs, involved in the binding of ATP. All of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases of class I are monomeric, except for the tyrosyl- and tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetases, which are dimeric and structurally very homologous (6Cusack S. Nat. Struct.

Tyrosine is first activated with ATP to form tyrosyladenylate, and then this intermediate is attacked by tRNATyr to form tyrosyl-tRNATyr and AMP. TyrRS shows half-of-the-sites reactivity since it binds only one molecule of tyrosine and one molecule of tRNATyr per molecule of dimer (9Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8031-8037Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 10Avis J.M. Day A.G. Garcia G.A. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5312-5320Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The structure of TyrRS from Bacillus stearothermophilus has been determined at high resolution (11Brick P. Bhat T.N. Blow D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 83-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Each subunit of TyrRS comprises two structural domains in the crystal structure, an N-terminal domain (residues 1–319) and a C-terminal domain (residues 320–419). The N-terminal domain contains the interface of dimerization and the binding sites for tyrosine, tyrosyladenylate, and the acceptor arm of tRNATyr. Its isolated form (i.e. unlinked to the other domain) is dimeric, forms tyrosyladenylate normally, but does not bind tRNATyr (12Waye M.M. Winter G. Wilkinson A.J. Fersht A.R. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1827-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The integrated form and the isolated form of the N-terminal domain have the same crystal structure (11Brick P. Bhat T.N. Blow D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 83-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 13Brick P. Blow D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 194: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain is disordered in the crystals of full-length TyrRS. It is essential for the binding of tRNATyr to TyrRS (12Waye M.M. Winter G. Wilkinson A.J. Fersht A.R. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1827-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 14Bedouelle H. Winter G. Nature. 1986; 320: 371-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We have chosen to study the N- and C-terminal domains of TyrRS separately to characterize its unfolding mechanism and its stability. In a previous study, we have shown that the isolated form of the C-terminal domain, TyrRS(Δ3), has secondary structure, is compact, and unfolds through a cooperative transition (15Guez-Ivanier V. Bedouelle H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In the present work, we studied the unfolding of the isolated N-terminal domain, TyrRS(Δ1), by urea under equilibrium conditions. We detected a monomeric intermediate between the native dimeric state of the N-terminal domain and its unfolded state and quantified the variation of free energy and its dependence on the concentration of urea for each of the corresponding conformational transitions. This work opens new prospects for the study of TyrRS by a mutational approach. For example, it will be possible to analyze the recognition between the subunits, the transmission of information between the active sites across the subunit interface, or the molecular bases for the hyperstability of TyrRS from B. stearothermophilus. Moreover, the quantitative thermodynamic analysis developed in this work should be applicable to other dimeric or oligomeric proteins. TyrRS(Δ1) was overexpressed from phage M13-BY(Δ1) and purified as described (15Guez-Ivanier V. Bedouelle H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar,16Vidal-Cros A. Bedouelle H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The purified TyrRS(Δ1) was >95% pure as judged by gel electrophoresis. It was stored at −70 °C in 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.78) and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The concentration of protein in the purified samples of TyrRS(Δ1) was measured with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The molecular mass of TyrRS(Δ1) was taken as 36,324 Da/subunit (12Waye M.M. Winter G. Wilkinson A.J. Fersht A.R. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1827-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Ultrapure urea was purchased from ICN and used directly as provided. All the experiments were performed at 25 °C. The reactions of unfolding and refolding of TyrRS(Δ1) in the presence of urea were performed and brought to equilibrium as described (15Guez-Ivanier V. Bedouelle H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In particular, all the measurements were done after a prolonged incubation of the reaction mixtures at 25 °C, between 12 and 16 h, a time after which the equilibrium between the different conformational states of TyrRS(Δ1) is reached (15Guez-Ivanier V. Bedouelle H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The concentration of urea in the reaction mixtures was measured with a refractometer and a precision of 0.01 m after the completion of each experiment. The samples were excited at 278 nm; the slit width was equal to 2.5 nm for the excitation light and 5 nm for the emission. The spectra of fluorescence intensity were recorded between 310 and 380 nm with a Quanta Master spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International). The signal was acquired for 1 s at each wavelength, and the increment of wavelength was equal to 1 nm. The intensities of fluorescence at 330 nm were measured with a Perkin-Elmer LS-5B spectrofluorometer. The signal was averaged during 17 s. The fluorescence signal for the protein was corrected by substraction of the signal for the solvent alone. Far-UV CD experiments were performed with a Jobin-Yvon CD6 apparatus. The spectra were recorded between 210 and 250 nm with a 0.2-cm path length cell when the concentration of TyrRS(Δ1) was equal to 100 μg/ml and between 225 and 250 nm with a 1.0-cm path length cell when its concentration was 20 μg/ml. The signal was acquired for 1 s at each wavelength, and the increment of wavelength was equal to 1 nm. The signal for the protein was corrected by substraction of the signal for the solvent alone. The hydrodynamic properties of TyrRS(Δ1) and their variations with the concentration of urea were measured by size-exclusion chromatography through a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The effluent was continuously monitored at A 280 nm. Before each chromatographic run, the column was equilibrated with more than 4 column volumes of elution buffer. An aliquot (100 μl) of either an unfolding reaction or a refolding reaction, containing 100 μg/ml TyrRS(Δ1), was injected at the top of the column. The column was eluted with the same buffer that was used in the unfolding or refolding reaction. The measures were expressed using the partition coefficient K av = (Ve −VO)/(Vt −V 0), where Ve is the elution volume corresponding to the maximum of the protein elution peak andVt and V 0 are the total volume and the void volume of the column, respectively. The relation between the Stokes radius (RS) and the rate of elution (1000/Ve) was established with the proteins in the calibration kits from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Blue dextran 200 and acetone were used to measure V 0 andVt, respectively. All the chromatographic runs were performed at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min and at room temperature (22–26 °C). The active-site titration and the pyrophosphate exchange assay were performed essentially as described (16Vidal-Cros A. Bedouelle H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 17Wilkinson A.J. Fersht A.R. Blow D.M. Winter G. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3581-3586Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. TyrRS(Δ1) (0.40 μm active sites) was first unfolded by different concentrations of urea as described above. The pyrophosphate exchange reaction was then started by diluting four times the unfolded enzyme in a reaction mixture containing the various substrates ([32P]pyrophosphate, ATP, and tyrosine) and the same concentration of urea as in the unfolding reaction. A stock solution of ANS (either 28 or 280 mm in methanol) was prepared, and its concentration was determined using a molar extinction coefficient equal to 6.8 × 103m−1·cm−1 at 370 nm in methanol (18Haugland R.P. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals. Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR1991Google Scholar). ANS (0.5 μl, either 14 or 140 μmfinal concentration) was added to a pre-equilibrated unfolding reaction of TyrRS(Δ1) (1 ml, 100 μg/ml = 0.1 μm protein) or to a control reaction without protein. The mixture was incubated for 1 h, and then the fluorescence spectrum of ANS was recorded between 400 and 600 nm, with excitation at 380 nm. The profiles of unfolding of TyrRS(Δ1) by urea, monitored by its fluorescence intensity or its CD ellipticity, were analyzed with the thermodynamic models described in Table I. Equation 13 was fitted to the unfolding profiles with the software pro Fit 5.0 for Macintosh (Cherwell Scientific Publishing Ltd., Oxford, United Kingdom) and 106iterations of the Monte Carlo algorithm, followed by the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The error on the concentration of urea (x) was set up to zero, and the error on the signal (Y) was set up to unknown for both algorithms. The fitting range for the Monte Carlo algorithm was set up to the default one,i.e. ±10% of the starting values of the parameters. However, the autosearch option was activated so that the limits of the parameters were adapted during the fit. Care was taken to reset these limits to ±10% of the starting values before each new fit. The values of the molar fractions fn, fi, and fu (Equations 10–12) and of their roots were calculated with the same software.Table IEquations for the equilibrium unfolding of dimeric proteins, as monitored by spectrometryWithout intermediateMonomeric intermediateDimeric intermediateEq.Equilibrium N 2 ↔ 2UN 2↔ 2I ↔ 2UN 2↔ J 2 ↔ 2U1Law of mass action K = [U]2/[N 2]K 1= [I]2/[N 2]K 1= [J 2]/[N 2]2K 2 = [U]/[I]K2 = [U]2/[J 2]3Conservation of mass [N 2] + [U]/2 = C[N 2] + [I]/2 + [U]/2 =C[N 2] + [J 2] + [U]/2 = C4Additivity of the signals (x = [urea]) Y′ =Yn[N 2] +Yu[U] +YdxY′ =Yn[N 2] +Yi[I] +Yu[U] +YdxY′ =Yn[N 2] +Yj[J 2] +Yu[U] + Ydx5 Y = Y′ −YdxY = Y′ −YdxY = Y′ −Ydx6Variations of the signals withx = [urea] Yn =yn + mnx; Yu =yu + muxYi= constantYj = constant7Variation of ΔG with x = [urea] ΔG = ΔG(H2O) − mx = −RTln(K)Similar laws for ΔG 1 and ΔG 2Similar laws for ΔG 1 and ΔG 28Definition of the molar fractions fn = [N 2]/C; fu = [U]/2Cfi = [I]/2Cfj = [J 2]/C9Solving equations 4Cfu2 + Kfu −K = 04Cfi2 +K 1(1 + K 2)fi− K 1 = 04C(1 +K 1)fu2 +K 1 K 2 fu −K 1 K 2 = 010 fn = 1 −fufn = 1 − (1 +K 2)fifn = (1 − fu)/(1 + K 1)11fu =K 2 fifj = (1 − fu)K 1/(1 +K 1)12 Y =C(Yn + (2Yu −Yn)fu)Y =C(Yn + (2Yi −Yn + K 2(2Yu −Yn))fi)Y =C(2Yu + (Yn − 2Yu + K 1(Yj − 2Yu))fn)13Total equilibrium constant and ΔG K; ΔGK =K 1 K 22; ΔG = ΔG 1 + 2ΔG 2K =K 1 K 2; ΔG = ΔG 1 + ΔG 214Numbers of equations and parameters(C and Y(0) =Yn(0) = yn are known) 5 equations, 5 parameters8 equations, 8 parameters8 equations, 8 parametersThe abbreviations used are: N 2, native dimeric state; J 2, dimeric intermediate state; I, monomeric intermediate state; U, unfolded state;C, total concentration of protein (m), expressed as dimer equivalent; x, concentration of denaturant (m); Y′, measured global signal; Y, corrected signal; Yn, Yi,Yj, and Yu, molar signals of the various protein states; Yd, molar signal of the denaturant; T, temperature (K); R, gas constant.

The sequence of TyrRS(Δ1) contains six tryptophan residues (at positions 9, 97, 126, 196, 240, and 255) and 11 tyrosine residues. Several tryptophan residues are buried inside the protein, according to its crystal structure (13Brick P. Blow D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 194: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We recorded the fluorescence emission spectra of TyrRS(Δ1) in 0 and 8 m urea at an excitation wavelength of 278 nm. The spectrum of unfolded TyrRS(Δ1) had a λmax at 349 nm, a value similar to that of tryptophan as a free amino acid. The λmax of native TyrRS(Δ1) was blue-shifted to 341 nm, and this shift was accompanied by an increase in intensity. The blue shift and the increase in intensity confirmed that some of the tryptophan side chains were buried in the hydrophobic interior of the native protein. The difference in fluorescence intensity between the native and unfolded states of TyrRS(Δ1) was maximal at an emission wavelength of 330 nm. This difference was larger when the excitation wavelength was equal to 278 nm than when it was 295 nm, as expected since both tyrosine and tryptophan are excited at 278 nm, whereas only tryptophan is excited at 295 nm. We therefore used the intensity of fluorescence emission at 330 nm, upon excitation at 278 nm, to monitor the unfolding of TyrRS(Δ1) by urea under equilibrium conditions. Fig. 1 shows the unfolding profile of TyrRS(Δ1) at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. The fluorescence intensity remained roughly constant at low concentrations of urea, decreased non-linearly between 2 and 6 m urea, and then increased linearly at high concentrations of urea. The molar fractions of the different conformational states depend on the total concentration of protein for a dimer (TableI). In contrast, the equilibrium constants K, K 1, andK 2 between these states and the associated free energies ΔG, ΔG 1, and ΔG 2 do not depend on this concentration and should remain constant when it varies. We used this invariability of the thermodynamic parameters as a criterion to characterize the mechanism through which TyrRS(Δ1) unfolds. We recorded its profile of unfolding by urea, monitored by its intensity of fluorescence, at different concentrations of protein, 10 μg/ml (138 nm), 5 μg/ml (69 nm), and 2.5 μg/ml (34 nm). Each profile was recorded three times in independent experiments. We fitted Equation 13, which links the global intensity of fluorescence and the concentration of urea, to the unfolding profiles for each of the three mechanisms in Table I, i.e. without an intermediate state between the native and unfolded states, with a monomeric intermediate, or with a dimeric intermediate. The thermodynamic parameters corresponding to these fittings varied with the total concentration of protein for the unfolding mechanism without an intermediate state or with a dimeric intermediate. In contrast, they remained constant, within experimental error, for the mechanism with a monomeric intermediate (Table II). Thus, the values of the thermodynamic parameters and their comparison at different protein concentrations showed that TyrRS(Δ1) unfolded through a monomeric intermediate.Table IIComparison of different mechanisms for the unfolding of TyrRS(Δ1)TyrRS(Δ1) concentration10.0 μg/ml5.0 μg/ml2.5 μg/mlWithout intermediate m (kcal · mol−1 ·m−1)2.5 ± 0.42.7 ± 1.11.4 ± 0.2 ΔG(H2O) (kcal · mol−1)22.4 ± 2.223.5 ± 6.015.9 ± 1.3Dimeric intermediate m 1 (kcal · mol−1 · m−1)2.5 ± 1.01.0 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.3 m 2 (kcal · mol−1 ·m−1)3.4 ± 0.65.8 ± 0.29.8 ± 1.9 ΔG 1(H2O) (kcal · mol−1)7.5 ± 3.43.5 ± 0.24.1 ± 0.9 ΔG 2(H2O) (kcal · mol−1)27.7 ± 3.140.6 ± 1.162.9 ± 9.8Monomeric intermediate m 1 (kcal · mol−1 · m−1)0.88 ± 0.060.76 ± 0.031.07 ± 0.12 m 2 (kcal · mol−1 ·m−1)2.57 ± 0.162.61 ± 0.032.25 ± 0.15 ΔG 1(H2O) (kcal · mol−1)13.8 ± 0.413.6 ± 0.413.87 ± 0.04 ΔG 2(H2O) (kcal · mol−1)14.9 ± 1.014.5 ± 0.412.3 ± 1.0The notations are the same as described for Table I.

The thermodynamic parameters listed in the first column were obtained by fitting equation 13 in Table I to the experimental data. Each entry corresponds to the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. We recorded the statistical parameter χ2, which measures the agreement between the function and the experimental values, for each experimental unfolding profile and each mechanism in Table I. We found that the relative values of χ2 were equal to 2.4 ± 0.3, 1.3 ± 0.1, and 1.0 (mean ± S.E. in nine independent experiments) for the mechanisms without an intermediate, with a monomeric intermediate, and with a dimeric intermediate, respectively. Thus, the equation corresponding to the mechanism with a dimeric intermediate gave the best formal fit to the experimental data, even though it did not satisfy the thermodynamic criteria described above. To reconcile the conclusions obtained with the thermodynamic and fitting criteria, we established the equation describing the mechanism with both a dimeric intermediate and a monomeric intermediate. This equation (not shown) comprised a total of 11 fitting parameters. The S.D. values that were associated with these parameters during the fitting process were very large, which indicated that the parameters were too numerous to be accurately determined by the fitting process. We calculated the molar fractionsfn, fi, and fuof the different conformational states of TyrRS(Δ1) from the thermodynamic parameters for an unfolding mechanism with a monomeric intermediate. We deduced several characteristic concentrations of urea from these molar fractions: fn−1(0.5), at which half of the TyrRS(Δ1) molecules were dissociated;fi−1(max fi), at which the concentration of monomeric intermediate was maximal; andfu−1(0.5), at which half of the molecules were unfolded. Table III gives the average values of these characteristic concentrations for the experiments performed at 10, 5, and 2.5 μg/ml. These values showed an effect of the total concentration of protein on the molar fractions of the different conformational states, as expected for the unfolding of a dimeric protein.Table IIICharacteristic concentrations of urea for the unfolding of TyrRS(Δ1), as monitored by its fluorescence intensityTyrRs(Δ1) concentration10.0 μg/ml5.0 μg/ml2.5 μg/mlmaxfi0.47 ± 0.030.43 ± 0.120.72 ± 0.08fi−1(max fi) (m)5.52 ± 0.155.27 ± 0.024.86 ± 0.20fn−1(0.5) (m)5.3 ± 0.15.0 ± 0.23.9 ± 0.4fu−1(0.5) (m)5.88 ± 0.165.65 ± 0.055.47 ± 0.11The notations are the same as described for Table I.

Table IV gives the global average values of the thermodynamic parameters, calculated from the results of nine experiments performed at three different protein concentrations. The unfolding reaction is characterized by four thermodynamic parameters: the free energies for the dissociation of the native dimer and for the unfolding of the monomeric intermediate in the absence of urea (ΔG 1(H2O) and ΔG 2(H2O), respectively) and their coefficients of dependence on the concentration of urea (m 1 and m 2, respectively). The values of the equilibrium constantsK 1(H2O) andK 2(H2O), calculated from them by Equation 8 in Table I, were 84 pm and 68 × 10−12, respectively.

Table IV gives the average values of these molar signals, calculated from the results of the same nine independent experiments. The molar fluorescence of the monomeric intermediate in 0 murea was equal to 9.8% of its value for the dimeric protein and therefore to 19.6% of its value for one subunit of the native protein. The molar fluorescence of the unfolded monomer in 0 m urea was equal to 15.2% of its value for one subunit of the native protein and to 78% of its value for the monomeric intermediate.

Despite this importance, the specific enzyme-DNA interactions that drive topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage and religation are poorly understood. Therefore, to dissect interactions between the enzyme and its cleavage site, abasic DNA lesions were incorporated into a bilaterally symmetrical and identical cleavage site. Results indicate that topoisomerase II has unique interactions with each position of the 4-base overhang generated by enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage. Lesions located 2 bases 3′ to the point of scission stimulated cleavage the most, whereas those 3 bases from the point of scission stimulated cleavage the least. Moreover, an additive and in some cases synergistic cleavage enhancement was observed in oligonucleotides that contained multiple DNA lesions, with levels reaching >60-fold higher than the wild-type substrate. Finally, topoisomerase II efficiently cleaved and religated a DNA substrate in which apyrimidinic sites were simultaneously incorporated at every position on one strand of the 4-base overhang.

Eukaryotic topoisomerase II is an enzyme that is required for a number of indispensable nuclear processes, including DNA replication, recombination, and chromosome segregation (1Cozzarelli N.R.

However, in order for topoisomerase II to fulfill its pivotal role in any of these processes, it must create double-stranded breaks in the genetic material. Topoisomerase II generates these breaks by the concerted actions of two active site tyrosyl residues, each of which induces a transient, single-stranded nick in opposite strands of the DNA helix, such that a 4-base 5′-overhang is generated (10Liu L.F. Rowe T.C. Yang L. Tewey K.M. Chen G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15365-15370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The integrity of the genetic material is preserved during the cleavage reaction by the formation of covalent phosphotyrosyl bonds between these residues and the newly generated 5′ termini (12Rowe T.C. Chen G.L. Hsiang Y.H. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2021-2026PubMed Google Scholar). Following ATP binding, a second helix is translocated through the topoisomerase II-associated double-stranded DNA break, and the cleaved DNA is religated (13Osheroff N. Shelton E.R. Brutlag D.L. J.

Despite the importance of the DNA cleavage/religation reaction to the functions of topoisomerase II, relatively little is known regarding the specific enzyme-DNA interactions that drive this reaction. Although consensus DNA cleavage sequences have been reported for the eukaryotic enzyme, they are relatively weak and show little similarity to one another (8Pommier Y. Fesen M.R. Goldwasser F. Chabner B.A. Longo D.L. Cancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy: Principles and Practice. 2nd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA1996: 435-461Google Scholar, 16Capranico G. Zunino F. Eur. J. Cancer. 1992; 12: 2055-2060Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, the molecular interactions that underlie the site specificity of topoisomerase II remain an enigma. Previous attempts to dissect interactions between the enzyme and its cleavage site characterized the effects of DNA lesions (apurinic sites, apyrimidinic sites, or base mismatches) incorporated at specific positions in a topoisomerase II cleavage site (17Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7488-7493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All of these lesions displayed a strict positional specificity. When they were located within the 4-base overhang generated by cleavage, levels of DNA scission increased ∼3–18-fold. Conversely, lesions located immediately outside the 4-base overhang inhibited DNA cleavage. Although position-specific variations in stimulatory DNA lesions were observed, conclusions regarding nucleotide positions within the 4-base overhang were limited because the relative effects of position (e.g. removal of a base at the point of scissionversus one base away) as opposed to sequence (e.g. removal of a guanine versus an adenine) could not be distinguished. To bypass these limitations and more fully define interactions between the enzyme and specific positions within its DNA cleavage site, abasic sites were incorporated into a topoisomerase II cleavage site in which the central bases were bilaterally symmetrical and identical (see Fig. 1). Because abasic lesions contained within a given strand of this cleavage site differed only by location rather than the type of base removed, this site allowed a systematic analysis of the 4-base overhang in topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage/religation. Results indicate that topoisomerase II displays a positional preference, such that the efficacy of DNA lesions is dependent on their location within the cleavage site. In addition, the enzyme efficiently cleaves and religates a DNA substrate in which apyrimidinic sites are simultaneously incorporated at every position on one strand of the 4-base overhang, demonstrating that base pairing within the cleavage site is not required either for formation or closure of the DNA break. A 40-base single-stranded oligonucleotide that corresponds to residues 1072–1111 of theMLL oncogene (21Felix C.A. Lange B.J. Hosler M.R. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.

The sequences of the top and bottom oligonucleotides were 5′-GCCTGGGTGACAAAGC↓AAAACACTGTCTCCAAAAAAAATT-3′ and 5′-AATTTTTTTTGGAGACAGTG↓TTTTGCTTTGTCACCCAGGC-3′, respectively. The points of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage are denoted by the arrows. Single-stranded oligonucleotides containing a tetrahydrofuran abasic site analogue were prepared in a similar manner utilizing a tetrahydrofuran phosphoramidite. Single-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled on their 5′ termini with [32P]phosphate, purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and annealed as described previously (18Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1148-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage reactions were carried out by a protocol similar to that of Kingma et al. (19Kingma P.S. Greider C.A. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5934-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Reactions contained 100 nm oligonucleotide in 19 μl of cleavage buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, and 2.5% glycerol) that contained 5 mmMgCl2 and were initiated by the addition of 1 μl of human topoisomerase IIα (final concentration, 150 nm). (Human topoisomerase IIα was purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae as described previously (19Kingma P.S. Greider C.A. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5934-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).) Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C and stopped with 2 μl of 10% SDS followed by 1.5 μl of 250 mm EDTA. When appropriate, cleavage reactions were reversed by the addition of 1.5 μl of 250 mm EDTA for 5 min at 37 °C prior to the detergent. Cleavage products were digested with proteinase K, precipitated twice with ethanol, and resolved by electrophoresis in denaturing 7m urea, 14% polyacrylamide gels as described previously (18Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1148-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Reaction products were visualized and quantified using a PhosphorImager system. In all cases (other than those that incorporated an abasic site on both strands), cleavage was monitored on the complementary wild-type strand. Levels of DNA cleavage were calculated either relative to that obtained with the wild-type substrate or from the percentage of total substrate that was cleaved. DNA religation assays were carried out by a modification of the procedure of Osheroff and Zechiedrich (23Osheroff N. Zechiedrich E.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4303-4309Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Cleavage/religation equilibria were established as described above in cleavage buffer that contained 5 mm CaCl2. Kinetically competent topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complexes were trapped by the addition of EDTA (final concentration, 6 mm). NaCl was added (final concentration, 500 mm) to prevent recleavage. Religation was initiated by the addition of MgCl2 (final concentration, 0.1 mm) and terminated by the addition of 2 μl of 10% SDS at various times up to 60 s. Samples were prepared and analyzed as described above. The apparent first order rate of DNA religation was determined by quantifying the loss of the cleavage product. To dissect the recognition of the DNA cleavage site by topoisomerase II and the role of base pairing in the cleavage/religation reaction of the enzyme, abasic lesions were incorporated into a 40-base pair oligonucleotide that corresponds to residues 1072–1111 of the MLL gene and includes a topoisomerase II cleavage site at nucleotide position 1087 (21Felix C.A. Lange B.J. Hosler M.R. Fertala J. Bjornsti M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4287-4292PubMed Google Scholar, 22Gu Y. Alder H. Nakamura T. Schichman S.A. Prasad R. Canaani O. Saito H. Croce C.M. Canaani E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2326-2330Google Scholar). This bilaterally symmetrical site was utilized because it contains identical bases along each strand of the 4-base overhang (i.e. all adenine residues on the top strand and thymine residues on the bottom) (Fig. 1). The positions of DNA lesions are designated relative to the point of cleavage with the points of scission on both the top and bottom strands located 5′ to the +1 base. Cleavage of the top and bottom strands of this 5′-labeled oligonucleotide by human topoisomerase IIα results in the formation of radioactive 16- and 20-base products, respectively, such that a 4-base 5′-cleavage overhang is generated. The sensitivity of human topoisomerase IIα toward alterations at specific positions in the 4-base cleavage overhang was characterized by incorporating abasic DNA lesions at each position within the top and bottom strands (Fig. 1). Consistent with our previous work (17Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7488-7493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 19Kingma P.S. Greider C.A. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5934-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), each individual lesion stimulated enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage, and greater levels of cleavage were observed with apurinic sites (top strand) than with apyrimidinic sites (bottom strand). However, levels of cleavage stimulation for either type of lesion were not uniform across the cleavage site. Consistently, lesions at the +2 position stimulated DNA scission the most, ∼9–11-fold above the wild-type substrate. In contrast to the strong preference for the +2 position, only a weak preference (∼2–3-fold above wild-type) for the +3 position was detected on both strands. The preference for lesions placed at the +1 versus+4 positions was irregular. When comparing these two positions, a slight preference for the +1 position was observed on the top strand, whereas on the bottom strand the +4 position was preferred. As discussed below, these findings suggest a predisposition of the enzyme for the “left side” of the cleavage site. Although the cleavage site utilized in this study permits a unique analysis of the positional preferences of the enzyme, the generality of these conclusions must be tempered by the fact that only a single site was examined. However, these preferences are supported by results obtained with at least two other DNA cleavage sites (19Kingma P.S. Greider C.A. Osheroff N.

Even with the above caveat, it is clear that topoisomerase II does not have uniform interactions with each base of the overhang; rather the enzyme appears to have a positional preference for DNA lesions and displays specific responses to alterations at each position. Several clinically relevant anticancer drugs exert their chemotherapeutic actions by increasing levels of covalent topoisomerase II-cleaved DNA complexes (6Chen A.Y. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 34: 191-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 7Froelich-Ammon S.J. Osheroff N. J. Biol.

As a result of their actions, drugs that “poison” topoisomerase II (i.e. shift the cleavage/religation equilibrium toward the cleaved state) increase levels of protein-associated DNA breaks and are lethal to rapidly dividing cancer cells. The original models proposed for the actions of these poisons generally placed a drug molecule at the point of scission on each strand of the double helix with two molecules acting in concert to stimulate double-stranded DNA cleavage (6Chen A.Y. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 34: 191-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 8Pommier Y. Fesen M.R. Goldwasser F. Chabner B.A. Longo D.L.

A. 1994; 91: 11007-11011Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Based on the results of previous studies with DNA lesions, an alternative model known as the “positional poison model” was proposed that encompassed the actions of both anticancer drugs and DNA lesions (18Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1148-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Unlike previous drug models, the positional poison model suggested that two drug molecules were not required to stimulate double-stranded DNA cleavage, because a single, strand-specific DNA lesion was capable of enhancing enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage at both points of scission. Therefore, to extend our use of DNA lesions as a probe of drug mechanism, a series of oligonucleotides containing two abasic sites was analyzed to determine whether multiple lesions might also display a positional preference. In most cases, the stimulatory effects of multiple DNA lesions appeared to be at least additive (i.e. levels of cleavage with two DNA lesions were as high as the theoretical sum of cleavage levels observed with the individual abasic sites) (Fig. 2, compare closed andopen bars). This additive effect was observed when abasic sites were positioned adjacent to each other (17Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7488-7493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), separated by a gap, or located at both points of scission in either the +1 top/+1 bottom or the +4 top/+4 bottom positions (the postulated locations of drugs (6Chen A.Y. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 34: 191-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar,8Pommier Y. Fesen M.R. Goldwasser F. Chabner B.A. Longo D.L.

A. 1994; 91: 11007-11011Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)). Therefore, although only one topoisomerase II poison is required to induce double-stranded DNA cleavage, two appear to produce greater levels of cleavage enhancement. Remarkably, in some cases a synergistic effect was observed. When lesions were incorporated at the +1/+2 or the +2/+3 positions on the top strand or the +2/+3 or the +3/+4 positions on the bottom strand levels of cleavage stimulation reached >60-fold and were ∼2–3-fold greater than the predicted additive effects of the individual DNA lesions. Because this superadditive effect was only observed with abasic lesions at these positions, it appears that synergism within this cleavage site is dependent on two primary factors. First, the abasic sites must be located adjacent to each other. Second, lesions must be positioned on the left side of the cleavage site, such that the +1 or +2 positions on the top strand or the +3 or +4 positions on the bottom strand are included. Previous work by Westergaard and co-workers examined the importance of base pairing in ligation reactions between a topoisomerase II-cleaved DNA complex and external, acceptor fragments of DNA (27Schmidt V.K. Sorensen B.S. Sorensen H.V. Alsner J. Westergaard O. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In this intermolecular ligation reaction, base pairing of the external fragment to the cleaved DNA was important for the positioning of the incoming termini and enhanced rates of ligation as much as 8-fold. In contrast, studies that incorporated single abasic sites or base mismatches within a topoisomerase II cleavage site indicated that intramolecular DNA religation mediated by the enzyme (i.e. resealing the original DNA break covalently linked to topoisomerase II) was not inhibited by disruption of one of the 4 base pairs within the overhang (17Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7488-7493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1148-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Therefore, to further define the importance of base pairing within the 4-base overhang, enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage and intramolecular religation were examined in the presence of multiple abasic sites. As seen in Fig. 3, topoisomerase II tolerated the removal of all four pyrimidines on the bottom strand (apyrimidinic sites were used because they are less disruptive to the structure of the double helix than apurinic sites (28Raap J. Dreef C.E. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Hilbers C.W. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1987; 5: 219-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 29Singh M.P. Hill G.C. Peoc'h D. Rayner B. Imbach J.L. Lown J.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10271-10285Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 30Vesnaver G. Chang C.N. Eisenberg M. Grollman A.P. Breslauer K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3614-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar)). In fact, cleavage increased significantly with the removal of each successive base and reached levels >60-fold above the wild-type substrate when all 4 bases on the bottom strand were removed. Despite these dramatic increases in DNA scission, ≥90% of the cleavage was reversed by the addition of EDTA, even when all the base pairing was removed from the 4-base overhang (Fig. 3). In addition, under conditions in which the enzyme was capable of carrying out DNA strand passage (i.e. in the presence of ATP), cleavage was still reversible in the absence of base pairing. Therefore, base pairing within the overhang is not required for either DNA cleavage or religation mediated by topoisomerase II. Although not necessary for religation, the potential contributions of base pairing to the rate of this reaction are unknown. Therefore, the kinetics of religation were examined using a series of apyrimidinic substrates (Fig. 4). Removal of one (+1 position) or two bases (either at the +1/+2 or +3/+4 positions) from the bottom strand did not inhibit rates of religation. In fact, rates appeared to increase slightly, which is consistent with earlier findings with single DNA lesions (17Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7488-7493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Removal of 3 or 4 bases decreased rates of religation ∼2–3-fold, a relatively minor effect when compared with the >60-fold stimulation of cleavage induced by four apyrimidinic sites. It is unclear whether this small decrease in the rate of religation reflects a minor contribution of base pairing to this reaction or whether it reflects a lesion-induced structural distortion of the cleavage site in addition to the potential effects of base pairing. This notwithstanding, it is clear that under the conditions used in this system, base pairing is not the driving force behind topoisomerase II-mediated DNA religation. Determining the specific molecular interactions that govern the topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage/religation reaction is vital to our understanding of this essential enzyme. In this study, abasic DNA lesions were used to reveal some of the critical features of this reaction. Results indicate that topoisomerase II has a positional preference for DNA lesions located within the 4-base cleavage overhang. Although every DNA lesion introduced within this region stimulated DNA scission, levels of cleavage with abasic sites at the +2 position were consistently the highest, and those at the +3 position were the lowest. Moreover, an additive and in some cases synergistic effect was observed in oligonucleotides that contained more than one abasic site. Considering the dramatic cleavage stimulation (>60-fold above wild-type) observed with certain combinations of DNA lesions, it is tempting to speculate that the efficacy of anticancer drugs might be substantially improved if they were capable of distorting multiple base pairs within the 4-base overhang. Finally, two lines of evidence suggest that the interactions between topoisomerase II and this DNA cleavage sequence are biased toward the left side of this site. First, cleavage levels observed with single DNA lesions at the +1 top or +4 bottom positions on the left side of the cleavage site were ∼2-fold higher than levels observed with lesions at the +4 top or +1 bottom positions, respectively, on the right side. Second, the synergistic effects of multiple abasic sites were only detected with adjacent DNA lesions that included at least one of the two positions on the left side of the cleavage site. Because the leftward bias was observed in independent experiments that examined either apurinic or apyrimidinic sites, it does not appear to be specific to the type of lesion utilized. Beyond this observation, the specific molecular interactions that underlie the leftward bias of this cleavage site are unclear. However, the homodimeric structure of the enzyme and the symmetrical nature of the central bases of this site suggest that this bias must originate from the nonsymmetrical region immediately outside the 4-base overhang. Although removing the bases from the cleavage overhang significantly stimulates the DNA scission reaction of topoisomerase II, base pairing in this region is not required for religation of the break and in relative terms has only a minor effect on the reaction rate. This is in marked contrast to most classical DNA ligases, which are dramatically inhibited by the loss of base pairing within their substrate. How does topoisomerase II religate a cleaved DNA substrate in the absence of base pairing? The defining property that distinguishes topoisomerase II from DNA ligases is its covalent linkage to the DNA strands containing the unpaired bases. This may explain why DNA termini covalently linked to topoisomerase II can be positioned and religated correctly by the enzyme without the assistance of base pairing. Thus, the driving force behind topoisomerase II-mediated DNA religation appears to be conformational changes within the enzyme rather than complementarity between the cohesive ends. Finally, this work may address how some topoisomerase II poisons can stimulate DNA cleavage without inhibiting DNA religation (5Corbett A.H. Osheroff N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 7Froelich-Ammon S.J. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21429-21432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Although topoisomerase II preferentially recognizes and cleaves the double helix when it is distorted by a drug molecule or DNA lesion (as suggested in the positional poison model (18Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1148-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar)), religation of the single-stranded DNA termini apparently is orchestrated primarily by the enzyme independent of the DNA structure. Thus, the same distortion of the double helix that alters the forward DNA cleavage reaction would have no effect on the reversal of this process. In summary, the interaction of topoisomerase II with its DNA cleavage site is critical to the physiological and therapeutic functions of the enzyme. DNA lesions are rapidly becoming a powerful tool for understanding the factors that dictate these interactions. We are grateful to P. B. Kingma, Dr. D. Andrew Burden, S. D. Cline, J. M. Fortune, and M. Sabourin for critical reading of the manuscript."

Chloroflexus aurantiacus is considered as the most basal branch of a photosynthetic organism in eubacterial phylogeny which has been described hitherto (1Gibson J. Ludwig W. Stackebrandt E. Woese C.R. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1985; 6: 152-156Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 2Woese C.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 227-271Crossref Google Scholar, 3Oyaizu H. Debrunner-Vossbrinck B.

The fixation of CO2 occurs via a novel cyclic pathway discovered recently (4Holo H. Arch. Microbiol. 1989; 151: 252-256Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 5Eisenreich W. Strauß G. Werz U. Fuchs G. Bacher A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The primary step of this pathway is the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA. The resulting malonyl-CoA yields hydroxypropionate, which is converted to propionyl-CoA by a sequence of dehydration and reduction reactions. A further carboxylation reaction of propionyl-CoA leads to dicarboxylic acids, which may be metabolized further to acetyl-CoA and glyoxylate (5Eisenreich W. Strauß G. Werz U. Fuchs G. Bacher A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The cell wall and membrane composition of C. aurantiacus are exceptional among procaryotic organisms. Membrane phospholipids are characterized by the predominance of saturated and unsaturated C18 and C20 fatty acids besides unusual fatty acid residues with a chain length of 17 (6Knudsen E. Jantzen E. Bryn K. Ormevod J.G. Sirevag R. Arch. Microbiol. 1982; 132: 149-154Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Monogalactosyldiglyceride, sulfoquinovosyldiglyceride, and most notably, phosphatidylinositol and diglycosyldiglycerides are found beside phosphatidylglycerol. The glycolipids contain equimolar amounts of glucose and galactose (6Knudsen E. Jantzen E. Bryn K. Ormevod J.G. Sirevag R. Arch. Microbiol. 1982; 132: 149-154Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 7Kenyon C.N. Gray A.M. J. Bact. 1974; 120: 131-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the lack of lipopolysaccharides is characteristic for the unusual cell membrane composition (8Meissner J. Krauss J.H. Jürgens U.J. Weckesser J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3213-3216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). l-Ornithine is the only diamino acid of the peptidoglycan. Instead of protein, a complex polysaccharide is bound to the peptidoglycan (9Jürgens U.J. Meißner J. Fischer U. König W.A. Weckesser J. Arch. Microbiol. 1987; 148: 72-76Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The carotinoid composition is also different from that of other procaryotes (10Halfen L.N. Pierson B.K. Francis G.W. Arch.

Michaelis W. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2757-2761Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) from the membrane fraction of C. aurantiacus in yields of 1–2 mg from a 1-g cell mass (dry weight). Previously, this rare diterpene with an unusual 3,6,6,5-tetracyclic ring system had been described only in marine sponges (12Tanaka J. Nurrachmi I. Higa T. Chem.

Hopanoids and steroids have not been found in the membrane of C. aurantiacus. Despite its different molecular dimensions, it has been proposed that verrucosan-2β-ol can act as a modulator of membrane fluidity in analogy to hopanoids and steroids in other microorganisms (11Hefter J. Richnow H.H. Fischer U. Trendel J.M. Michaelis W. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2757-2761Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Current evidence suggests that isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) 1The abbreviations used are: IPP, isopentenyl pyrophosphate; DMAPP, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect. and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) act as the universal precursors of terpenoid biosynthesis. The two precursors can be interconverted by isopentenyl pyrophosphate isomerase. The biosynthesis of cholesterol from acetate via mevalonate has been studied in detail by Bloch, Lynen, and their co-workers (22Bloch K. Science. 1965; 150: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). More recently, a second pathway via 1-deoxy-d-xylulose or its 5-phosphate has been discovered in plants and in certain eubacteria by independent work of the groups of Arigoni and Rohmer. More specifically, Arigoni and co-workers reported that 1-deoxyxylulose can serve as precursor for quinoid coenzymes in Escherichia coli and for ginkgolides inGinkgo biloba. On the other hand, these authors found that sterols are formed in Ginkgo via mevalonate (23Cartayrade A. Schwarz M. Jaun B. Arigoni D.

Tetrahedron Lett. 1997; 38: 3889-3892Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The pathway of terpenoid biosynthesis in C. aurantiacus is unknown. Moreover, the biosynthesis of verrucosan type compounds has not been studied in any species to the best of our knowledge. In order to study the biosynthesis of verrucosan-2β-ol, we applied singly and doubly 13C-labeled acetates to growing cultures of C. aurantiacus. The 13C enrichments and the13C-13C coupling patterns were determined by one- and two-dimensional 13C and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The labeling pattern of cellular amino acids and nucleosides served as a basis for the reconstruction of central metabolic pools by retrobiosynthetic analysis (5Eisenreich W. Strauß G. Werz U. Fuchs G. Bacher A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These data clearly show that IPP and DMAPP are formed by the mevalonate pathway inC. aurantiacus. A specific cyclization mechanism for the formation of verrucosan type diterpenes is proposed. [1-13C]Acetate and [2-13C]acetate were purchased from MSD-Isotopes (IC-Chemikalien, München, Germany) and [1,2-13C2]acetate from Isotec (Miamisburg, OH). Gases were purchased from Linde AG (Höllriegelskreuth, Germany). C. aurantiacus (DSM 636) was obtained from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen(Braunschweig, Germany). Growth conditions and culture media have been described earlier (34Strauß G. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 853-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). C. aurantiacus was grown phototrophically under anaerobic conditions as described earlier (34Strauß G. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 853-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The feeding experiments with [1-13C]acetate or [2-13C]acetate (99% 13C) have been described (5Eisenreich W. Strauß G. Werz U. Fuchs G. Bacher A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, the sodium salt of the respective 13C-labeled acetate was added as a sterile solution to a final concentration of 10 mm when the culture had reached a value of 30–100 mg of cell protein per liter. An experiment with [1,2-13C2]acetate was performed with continuous feeding. A sterile solution (32 ml) containing 3.44 mmol of sodium [1, 2-13C2]acetate, 18.6 mmol of unlabeled sodium acetate, and 2.4 μCi of [1,2-14C]acetate was added to the growing culture (2 liters) during a period of 100 h using a peristaltic pump (Braun, Melsungen, Germany). Aliquots were retrieved at intervals, and cell protein was determined by a modified Lowry method (35Markwell M.A.K. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5347) Google Scholar). The feeding rate was adjusted proportional to the growth rate. The radioactivity of cells and the supernatant culture medium was monitored by liquid scintillation counting with external standardization. Cells were harvested aerobically when the solution of labeled acetate was consumed. Bacterial cell mass (0.9 g dry weight) from the growth experiments with [1-13C]acetate or [2-13C]acetate was freeze-dried and suspended in a mixture of ethanol/diethylether (3:1, v/v, 200 ml). The suspension was boiled under reflux for 90 min. Solids were removed by filtration, and the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in 20 ml of a hexane/dichloromethane mixture (1:1, v/v). The solution was placed on a column of Merck Silica Gel 40 (4 × 30 cm). The column was developed with 1000 ml of hexane followed by 1200 ml of dichloromethane and by a mixture (300 ml) of methanol/dichloromethane/water (6:3:1, v/v). Fractions of 30 ml were collected. Verrucosan-2β-ol (1.1 mg) was eluted after 500 ml of dichloromethane and was identified by1H NMR spectroscopy. Cells grown with [1,2-13C]acetate (1.4 g dry weight) were suspended in a mixture of methanol/dichloromethane (1:1, v/v, 200 ml). The mixture was ultrasonically treated for 15 min until the supernatant was colorless. Chromatography on silica gel was performed as described above. The fractions from the experiment with [1,2-13C2]acetate containing verrucosan-2β-ol were subjected to solid phase extraction using a cartridge of C18 reversed phase material (Accu Bond, 5 ml) and methanol as eluent. The eluate was further purified by preparative thin layer chromatography using a Silica Gel 60 TLC plate (Merck) and a mixture of hexane/dichloromethane (6:4, v/v) as solvent. Verrucosan-2β-ol had an RF value of 0.78. The band containing the diterpene was scraped off. The solid was extracted with 30 ml of dichloromethane for 30 min. Evaporation of dichloromethane under reduced pressure yielded 1.3 mg of verrucosan-2β-ol. The isolation of amino acids and nucleosides has been described earlier (5Eisenreich W. Strauß G. Werz U. Fuchs G. Bacher A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 36Eisenreich W. Schwarzkopf B. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9622-9631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 500 and 125 MHz, respectively, using a Bruker DRX 500 NMR spectrometer. One-dimensional and two-dimensional experiments (COSY, NOESY, INADEQUATE, HMQC, and HMBC) were performed at 8 °C using standard Bruker software (XWINNMR). Absolute 13C abundance was determined for each carbon atom of verrucosan-2β-ol obtained from the feeding experiments by quantitative NMR spectroscopy (34Strauß G. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 853-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly,1H decoupled 13C NMR spectra of biosynthetic samples and of samples with natural 13C abundance (1.1%13C) were measured under identical conditions. Relative13C abundance of individual carbon atoms was then calculated from the integrals of biosynthetic samples by comparison with the natural abundance samples. In order to obtain absolute13C enrichments, the 13C satellites in the1H NMR of each metabolite were analyzed yielding absolute13C-enrichment values for selected carbon atoms. On the basis of these data, the relative 13C abundances were then referenced to absolute values. The fraction of multiply labeled isotopomers was calculated from 1H-decoupled 13C NMR spectra as the fraction of 13C-13C coupled satellites relative to the integral of the entire 13C signal of the respective carbon atom. 13C-Coupling patterns were simulated with NMRSIM software (Bruker). Build-up rates of NOEs were determined by two-dimensional NOESY experiments using mixing times of 20 ms to 3 s. Interproton distances were calculated by standardization on the distance of the geminal protons at C-6 and C-12 estimated as 1.78 Å. Molecular dynamic simulation of verrucosan-2β-ol was performed using interproton distances from NOESY experiments and a simulated annealing protocol. Energy minimization was performed using the MM+force field and the software package DISCOVER (Biosym Inc.). A prerequisite for the interpretation of biosynthetic tracer studies by quantitative NMR spectroscopy is the unequivocal assignment of all NMR signals of the target molecule. A 1H and13C NMR analysis of verrucosan-2β-ol with CD2Cl2 as solvent has been reported by Hefteret al. (11Hefter J. Richnow H.H. Fischer U. Trendel J.M. Michaelis W. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2757-2761Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our initial NMR analysis using CDCl3 as solvent gave some ambiguities with respect to the published assignments. It was therefore in order to assign all1H and 13C NMR signals of verrucosan-2β-ol in CDCl3 by two-dimensional NMR techniques. The 1H NMR signals were analyzed by two-dimensional COSY and NOESY type experiments (Table I, Fig. 2). The 13C NMR signals were assigned on the basis of DEPT and two-dimensional HMQC and HMBC experiments (Table I). Additional information was gleaned from two-dimensional INADEQUATE experiments using 13C-labeled samples isolated from the growth experiments with13C-labeled acetate (see below). With the exception of C-3 and C-16 which had to be interchanged, the data were in line with those obtained in CD2Cl2 by Hefter et al.(11Hefter J. Richnow H.H. Fischer U. Trendel J.M. Michaelis W. J.

Open table in a new tab Interproton distances were calculated from the initial rate of NOE build-up measurements as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Table II). The conformation of verrucosan-2β-ol was analyzed by molecular dynamics simulation. The preferred conformation is shown in Fig. 3. The Re-methyl group (C-17) is projected between C-14 and C-12 of the five-membered ring. Both the observed upfield shift of C-17 caused by two γ effects and the coupling constant of 2.6 Hz between H-13 and H-15 are in keeping with the conformation shown in Fig. 3.

Biochem. 1993; 215: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, 820 mg (10 mmol) of 13C-labeled acetate and a tracer amount of 14C-labeled acetate (100 kBq) were added as a bolus to a bacterial culture (1 liter) growing phototrophically on a mixture of H2/CO2 (80:20, v/v). The cell mass was extracted with ethanol/ether, and verrucosan-2β-ol was isolated from the supernatant as described under “Experimental Procedures.” From the solvent-extracted biomass, amino acids and ribonucleosides were obtained after hydrolysis of protein and RNA, and their13C-labeling patterns were determined by NMR spectroscopy. These data were used to reconstruct the labeling patterns of intermediary metabolites such as acetyl-CoA (compound 3, Fig. 1) and pyruvate (compound 4, Fig. 1). Results are shown in Fig. 4 and TableIII. Some of these data have been reported earlier (5Eisenreich W. Strauß G. Werz U. Fuchs G. Bacher A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The labeling pattern of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (compound 5, Fig. 1) was deduced from C-3 to C-5 of ribose as determined from isolated nucleosides. We have shown repeatedly that C-3 to C-5 of the pentose pool reflect the labeling pattern of C-1 to C-3 of the triose phosphate pool in a variety of organisms (5Eisenreich W. Strauß G. Werz U.

Biochem. 1993; 215: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab It should be noted that coupling cannot be predicted from enrichment in this study. For example, in pyruvate derived from [1-13C]acetate, the coupling contributions are low despite the enrichment values of 19–28% of the carbon atoms. This reflects the fact that the biosynthetic material is an isotopomeric mixture of [1-13C]-, [2-13C]-, and [3-13C]pyruvate. The formation of the single-labeled isotopomers by the carbon fixation cycle (as opposed to a stochastic distribution of 13C atoms which would be conducive to the formation of a substantial fraction of double-labeled isotopomers) has been discussed earlier (5Eisenreich W. Strauß G. Werz U. Fuchs G. Bacher A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The bolus addition of [1-13C]- and [2-13C]acetate shifted the growth pattern of the culture to a heterotrophic mode with efficient acetate utilization (5Eisenreich W. Strauß G. Werz U. Fuchs G. Bacher A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The resulting high 13C enrichment of central intermediary metabolites such as acetyl CoA and pyruvate was favorable for the analysis of the terpene cyclization (for details see below). On the other hand, flooding of the acetyl-CoA pool with [1,2-13C2]acetate would have been conducive to the formation of totally labeled verrucosan-2β-ol devoid of meaningful biosynthetic information. A growth experiment was therefore performed with slow, continuous addition of [1,2-13C2]acetate to the growing culture over a period of 100 h. Experimental details are described under “Experimental Procedures.” Under these conditions, the proffered acetate is diluted by material obtained from phototrophic CO2 fixation. Absolute 13C abundance data for verrucosan-2β-ol from growth experiments with 13C-labeled acetates were determined by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Parts of NMR spectra are shown in Fig. 5. 13C enrichments are summarized in Table IVand Fig. 6.Table IV13C Enrichments in verrucosan-2β-ol isolated from cells of C aurantiacus grown for several generations with CO2 (natural13C abundance) in the presence of 13C-labeled acetateCarbon positionGrowth with[1-13C]Acetate[2-13C]Acetate[1,2-13C2]Acetate13CCoupling13CCoupling13CCoupling%18.538.861.482.215.663.4233.764.03.149.912.090.0334.456.22.9NDaND, not determined due to signal overlapping.11.187.4410.443.357.885.018.022.258.731.060.3ND17.071.8635.863.43.148.013.880.4739.167.53.1ND9.471.389.140.661.15.618.322.4936.972.12.867.213.925.21046.877.53.1ND9.359.1119.242.456.97.417.223.31237.014.83.1ND14.281.71310.337.267.985.318.567.6148.441.762.881.315.330.71540.221.93.1ND12.877.31610.941.365.4ND18.114.4179.910.163.13.417.066.41811.210.771.02.918.767.4199.611.463.13.117.067.6208.97.958.63.014.667.8[1-13C]Acetate (99% enrichment) or [2-13C]acetate (99% enrichment) were added as bolus to a concentration of 10 mm.

The purification method involved two sequential steps using the same gel that takes advantage of the differential affinity of urease to the heparinoid at two levels of hydrogen ion concentration. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of affinity-purified urease revealed two major protein bands with about 62- and 30-kDa molecular mass. When whole cell lysates of clinical and laboratory strains of H. pylori were probed by Western blot, anti-urease hyperimmune serum produced by affinity-purified urease in rabbit recognized only the two bands corresponding to the urease A and B subunits. To probe the molecular relevance of affinity gel adherence to mucin adherence, the purified urease was derivatized withN-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin and used in adherence assays. Competitive inhibition tests revealed commonality of urease receptors among gastric mucin, heparin, and heparinoid. Composite data on adherence kinetics modulated by pH, salt, incubation time, and concentration of urease or mucin were indicative of conformation-dependent ligand-receptor interaction.

To date, urease is the first vaccine candidate to be tested in human clinical trials (7Haas R. Meyer T.F. Biologicals. 1997; 25: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Although urease is biosynthesized and localized within the cytosolic compartment of H. pylori, it ultimately accumulates on the bacterial surface through a proposed fourth mechanism of protein export to a subcellular compartment (8Phadnis S.H. Parlow M.H. Levy M. Ilver D. Caulkins C.M. Connors J.B. Dunn B.E. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 905-912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Dunn B.E. Vakil N.B. Scheinder B.G. Miller M.M. Zitzer J.B. Peutz T. Phadnis S.H. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1181-1188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). According to this model, H. pylori cells undergo spontaneous autolysis, presumably driven by a yet unidentified autolysin gene. The subsequent release of cellular debris brings the urease enzyme to the surface of other bacterial cells with which it gets in contact in vivo or in vitro. A separate study, however, has suggested that autolysis may only be a minor event compared with active secretion of the enzyme (10Vanet A. Labigne A. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1023-1027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regardless, the surface localization of urease protein potentially confers a central pathogenic role for this cytosolic protein. Urease may influence H. pylori nutrition via utilization of urea-derived ammonia for protein synthesis (11Williams C.L. Preston T. Hossack M. Slater C. McColl K.E.L. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1996; 13: 87-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and induction of proinflammatory cytokines (12Harris P.R. Mobley H.L.T. Perez-Perez G.I. Blaser M.J. Smith P.D. Gastroenterology. 1996; 111: 419-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and promote bacterial survival in acidic medium by generating ammonia within its immediate mucinous pericellular space. Urease is one of the most abundant proteins of H. pylori; therefore, understanding the host-urease interactive events may yet hold the key to a rational and efficacious mode of treatment and prevention of colonization. To date, however, the fundamental mechanism underlying the essential role of urease in the colonization of the gastric mucosa remains unknown (13Labigne A. de Reuse H. Infectious Agents and Disease. 5. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 191-202Google Scholar). A major deterrent in elucidating this essential role is the lack of a simple, reliable, and high yield method of purification of this enzyme. Easy access to highly purified urease proteins by investigators should therefore facilitate advances in therapeutic or preventive approaches based on the abrogation of known or yet undetermined biological activity of thisHelicobacter protein. Previous purification methods of native or recombinant urease invariably required two or several steps involving conventional size exclusion and cation exchange (14Evans Jr., D.J. Evans D.G. Kirkpatrick S.S. Graham D.Y. Microb. Pathog. 1991; 10: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) or fast performance liquid chromatography (FPLC) 1The abbreviations used are: FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; BHI, brain heart infusion; FBS, fetal bovine serum; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. combining cation exchange, size exclusion chromatography, and sometimes the conventional hydrophobic interaction gel (4Lee C.K. Weltzin R. Thomas Jr., W.D. Kleanthous H. Ermak T.H. Soman G. Hill J.E. Ackerman S.K. Monath T.P. J. Infect. Dis. 1995; 172: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 15Dunn B.E. Campbell G.P. Perez-Perez G.I. Blaser M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9464-9469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hu L.-T. Mobley L.T. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 992-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FPLC requires sophisticated instrumentation and expensive columns usually inaccessible to small research laboratories, and the multiplicity of chromatographic steps tends to compromise the recovery rate in terms of both protein and catalytically active enzyme. Immunoaffinity purification has been performed using monoclonal antibody (7Haas R. Meyer T.F. Biologicals. 1997; 25: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) that requires a time-consuming antibody-coupling step to the support matrix and with the column so designed not usable over an extended period of time. The simplest method used so far was the procedure involving conventional agarose gel filtration and DEAE-cellulose ion exchange (14Evans Jr., D.J. Evans D.G. Kirkpatrick S.S. Graham D.Y. Microb. Pathog. 1991; 10: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). As a first step to facilitate further studies on the pathogenic mechanism of urease, we developed a simpler method of purifying the native enzyme from crude bacterial extract. In this study, we took a step further by using a single type of gel for a two-stage conventional affinity chromatography. The gel, a heparinoid consisting of cellulose matrix with sulfate esters as functional groups, has been shown to be useful for purification of a wide range of viruses, enzymes, and other biomolecules that interact with a heparinoid ligand. Lipopolysaccharide does not bind to the sulfated polymer, making this material suitable for detoxification of biological substances (Amicon product manual). Binding to the heparinoid gel prompted us to use the urease protein thus purified in adherence assays, using other sulfoconjugates as receptor substrate. The observed high affinity binding to heparin and mucin was discussed in relation to the possible adhesin function byH. pylori urease. Fresh clinicalH. pylori strains 130, 132, and 135, isolated as described previously (17Kabir A.M.A. Aiba Y. Takagi A. Kamiya S. Miwa T. Koga Y. Gut. 1997; 41: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), and NCTC 11637 were used for urease purification experiments (number 130) and for Western blot analysis (all strains). The strains were obtained from Dr. Yuji Aiba (Department of Internal Medicine IV, School of Medicine, Tokai University, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan). Stock culture of each strain was prepared by initial passage in brain heart infusion (BHI, Difco) agar plate containing 5% defibrinated horse blood (4 days, 37 °C) and then passaged to 20-mlBrucella broth (Difco) in 100-ml bottle (plus 0.2% β-cyclodextrin and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)). Bottles were incubated overnight with gyratory shaking at 37 °C. The gas phase inside the bottle for all broth cultures in this study was replaced with a mixture of 80% nitrogen, 10% hydrogen, and 10% carbon dioxide prior to incubation. Bacterial cell pellets were collected and stored as stock culture at −80 °C in 20% glycerol or 10% skim milk containing 2% sodium glutamate. For mass urease production, a stock culture of strain 130 was thawed, passaged to 20-ml Brucellabroth, and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with gyratory shaking. Five ml of the resulting bacterial broth suspension were inoculated to 1-liter bottles containing 200-ml Brucella broth medium with 5% FBS. After overnight incubation with gyratory shaking, 5 ml of the suspension was again passaged to 1-liter bottles containingBrucella broth with 2–5% FBS. The bottles were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C using a bidirectional shaker at 75 rpm (Takasaki Scientific Instruments Corp.). The cell biomass was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min. To compare urease yield according to cultivation medium composition, BHI broth instead of Brucella broth was used under exactly the same cultivation conditions. H. pylori whole cells used in adherence assays were propagated once from stock culture by inoculation of Brucella broth with 2% FBS and harvested 24 h later. The whole cells were immediately biotinylated as described previously (18Ofek I. Courtney H. Schifferli D.M. Beachey E.H. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1986; 24: 512-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cell biomass pelleted during harvest was collected by scraping with a sterile metal spatula and directly transferring the cell pellet to 10-ml polypropylene tubes. About 1 g or less ofH. pylori cells (wet weight) was transferred to each tube, and the material was spread as thinly as possible on the tube wall and stocked at −80 °C until use. To extract urease, the cell pellet was thawed at room temperature and then vortexed with about 6.5 ml of sterile distilled water per tube for a total of 20 s with brief stops every 5 s. Cells from the mixture were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was filtered using a 0.22 Millex GV Millipore filter. The filtered sample or crude urease extract was added with a 10× concentration of 20 mm phosphate, 1 mm EDTA buffer, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (pH 6.5) at a volume ratio of 1:10 to the total crude urease extract volume. The resulting buffered extract was adjusted to pH 6.5. The enzymatic activity of urease was quantified using a previously described method based on jackbean urease standard (19Nagata K. Mizuda T. Tonokatu Y. Fukuda Y. Okamura H. Hayashi T. Shimoyama T. Tamura T. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 4826-4831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Results were expressed in units, with 1 enzyme unit equivalent to 1 μmol of ammonia liberated from urea per min per mg of protein. For preliminary optimization experiments, Cellufine sulfate (Amicon) and heparin-agarose (Sigma) were tested for urease affinity adherence at different pH. Equal volumes of 0.8 ml Cellufine sulfate, cellulose, heparin-agarose, or beaded agarose preadjusted to desired pH in duplicate into glass tubes were equilibrated with the adhesion medium (20 mm phosphate, 0.05% Tween 20). One ml of crude urease extract prediluted 10 times with phosphate buffer at different pH was dispensed to each tube containing gel that had been pre-equilibrated to the same pH as the urease sample. To determine the effect of physiological salt concentration on binding affinity, another set of tubes similarly prepared contained 0.15 m NaCl in the adhesion medium. The tubes were then shaken in slanted position at room temperature for 15 min using a bidirectional shaker. The gels were centrifuged at low speed and were washed three times with 10 gel volumes of PE buffer (20 mm phosphate, 1 mm EDTA) with pH similar to the gel pH. After aspirating the last wash buffer, bound urease was eluted with 2 ml/tube of 2 m NaCl in PE buffer, pH 7.0. After pelleting the gels, urease enzyme activity in the bound and unbound fractions was measured as described above. Cellufine sulfate was subsequently selected over heparin-agarose based on its generally higher affinity and higher pH optimum. In a typical experiment, the step A gel column (14 mm diameter) containing 155 mm of Cellufine sulfate bed height was equilibrated with PE buffer, pH 6.5 (PE65). About 5.5 ml of crude urease extract was then applied to the step A column at a flow rate of 9 ml/min. Elution was done with PE65, and the eluate was fractionated with an automatic fraction collector (Atto) (1.25 ml/fraction). Protein concentration in the void volume was measured continuously with a UV monitor (280 nm). Urease eluting with the void volume as the first peak was confirmed by enzyme measurement as described above. For analytical purposes, the whole sample input was fractionated, resulting in a total of three major peaks with the urease enzyme fraction coincident with the first peak. For routine urease production purposes, elution was terminated after the first peak and the tail of the second peak were eluted. Fractions were immediately analyzed quantitatively for enzyme activity. Urease-containing fractions were then selected, pooled, adjusted to pH 5.5, and adsorbed to the step B column (14-mm diameter) with about 63 mm of Cellufine sulfate bed height that had been preequilibrated with PE buffer, pH 5.5. The same flow rate as in step A was maintained followed by an extensive wash. For biotin labeling of urease and for immunizations, 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 5.5, was used (PO55) for washing the step B column. In all experiments, gel-bound urease was eluted using 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl (PO74). Eluted fractions collected in 2.5-ml volumes were quantitatively analyzed for enzyme activity and protein content before storage at −80 or −135 °C. In some experiments, the peak fractions were immediately labeled with biotin (see procedure below). Some affinity-purified urease samples were quantitatively checked for remaining enzymatic activity before and after a single freeze-thaw cycle. To determine whether a single step method will result in selective binding of urease to the Cellufine sulfate gel, the crude urease extract was adjusted to pH 5.5, immediately adsorbed to the step B gel, and eluted as above. Quantitative protein analysis was performed using the Bradford test reagent (Bio-Rad). The percentage urease content of crude extract or partially purified samples (step A pooled eluate) was determined by analyzing the integrated densities of protein bands in SDS-PAGE gels using an image analyzer (Aspect, Mitani Corporation, Fukui-ken, Japan) system with software installed on a NEC PC-9801RX personal computer. The total urease content was calculated by adding the urease A and B subunit percentage integrated densities. The percentage obtained was used to calculate the total urease protein contained in a crude or partially purified test sample based on the total sample protein obtained by the Bradford test (mg/ml). Step A protein recoveries were based on the urease protein (about 29.5–32%) contained in the original crude extract, while step B recoveries (final product) were based on both the urease protein contained in the crude extract and the total protein content of the crude extract. Percentage enzyme recovery calculation was based on the sum total of enzyme activity (units/ml) recovered in all positive fractions just after elution from the step A or B column compared with the original enzyme activity just before purification. Anti-urease rabbit serum was produced using 100 mg of affinity-purified urease as antigen mixed with an equal volume of a block copolymer adjuvant CRL89–41 (TiterMax Classic, Cytrx Corp.). The resulting emulsion was administered subcutaneously to a 2.5-kg Japanese White rabbit at four different sites. At 3, 4, and 5 weeks after primer immunization, the same amount of urease protein with the same adjuvant was administered via the same route. The rabbit was exsanguinated 3 weeks after the last booster, and total serum was collected followed by antibody titration (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)) and storage at −30 °C. Anti-whole cell serum was prepared by immunizing a rabbit using whole cell homogenate of H. pylori number 130. The antigen was prepared by disrupting broth cultivated H. pylori number 130 cells using a glass bead homogenizer (MSK, B. Braun Flexible Biotechnology). A sample of whole cell homogenate was plated onto BHI blood agar plates to confirm cell disruption. The antigen was dispensed in aliquots and stored at −80 °C until use. For primer immunization, about 3 mg of the lysed cell suspension was mixed with an equal volume of complete Freund adjuvant. The emulsified antigen was injected subcutaneously at weeks 2, 3, and 4 postprimer. In the fifth week, the same amount of antigen was injected intravenously via ear vein without adjuvant. The rabbit was exsanguinated 2 weeks after the last booster. Serum was collected for ELISA titration and stored as hyperimmune anti-whole cell serum at −30 °C until use. The antigenicity of affinity-purified urease was assessed by checking the antibody response of immunized rabbit using the whole cell lysate or purified urease as antigen coating for ELISA antibody titration. Assay plates were prepared by coating 96-well Immulon 2 plates (Dynatech Laboratories, Inc.) with either whole cell lysate of strain 130 H. pylori or affinity-purified urease. The whole cell lysate was prepared by dissolving whole H. pylori cells in 1% SDS, and unsolubilized cells were removed by centrifugation. For the assay, the solubilized whole cell antigen or affinity-purified urease was diluted to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml using carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6, as diluent. About 100 μl of this preparation was dispensed per well, and plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The plates were washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween (PBS-Tween) and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin, fraction V (Sigma) for a 1-h incubation at 37 °C. Plates were washed three times with PBS-Tween, and 100 μl of the test rabbit serum prediluted 100 times with PBS-Tween was dispensed to each well. After 1 h at 37 °C, wells were washed three times with PBS-Tween and 100 μl of horseradish peroxidase-goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugate (Cappel) in suitable dilution was dispensed to each well. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, plates were washed five times with PBS-Tween. Color reaction was developed withortho-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride and was stopped with 3 n H2SO4. Absorbance was read at 490 nm. Two wells/plate not coated with the antigen but treated similarly as the test wells were used as the blank whose OD was subtracted from all test well readings. Titers of test sera were determined based on the regression of a standard calibration curve co-processed with test samples. To verify the mechanism of adherence by urease to the affinity gels, affinity-purified urease was biotinylated just after elution from the step B column for use in an adherence assay. The purified urease was labeled via amino groups with N-hydroxysuccinimide biotin (Sigma) for 180 min (room temperature) at different (1:1 to 128:1) biotin:protein molar ratio based on the monomeric mass of urease. The labeled urease samples were monitored for enzyme activity at different incubation time points for up to 180 min. Labeling was quenched by 20-fold dilution of the sample with PO55 buffer, and the solution was readjusted to pH 5.5 and readsorbed to and eluted from the step B affinity gel as described above. To detect, quantify, and determine the lower detection limit for biotin-labeled urease fractions, samples were coated on ELISA plates and detected using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Zymed). Urease labeled at a 1:32 biotin:protein molar ratio was found to have a lower limit of detection at about 10 ng/ml. In another instance, biotinylated urease was blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane after SDS-PAGE, and the urease A and B subunits were detected with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate as outlined below to confirm specificity of labeling as well as detection of both subunits A and B at the biotin:protein molar ratio used. Peak fractions of labeled urease eluted from the step B column were stored at −135 °C. SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide gel) (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207460) Google Scholar) under reducing conditions was used to analyze the purification process. To confirm the purity of affinity-purified urease protein, two approaches were followed. First, Western blot was conducted with whole cell lysates of H. pylori strains NCTC 11637, numbers 130, 132, and 135 as antigens probed by anti-urease rabbit serum. Second, crude urease extract of H. pyloristrain 130 was probed in a Western blot with rabbit anti-whole cell serum. In this step, an unfixed duplicate gel was used to transfer the electrophoresed protein to nitrocellulose membrane by the standard procedure of Towbin (21Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44931) Google Scholar). The blotted proteins were then probed with the appropriate rabbit serum in a suitable dilution, and the rabbit IgG complexed with specific antigen was probed with anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Cappel). Blots were developed with 4-chloro-1-naphthol, and the reaction was stopped with distilled water. Crude gastric mucus was obtained from the stomach of a 2-month-old weanling pig. To prepare crude mucus, the lumen of isolated stomach was perfused with PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.1m phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm EDTA. After exposing the luminal wall through a greater curvature incision, the mucosal surface was scraped using a metal spatula with a minimum amount of the perfusion buffer. The scraped material was homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematica Gmbh, Switzerland) at 12,000 rpm for 5 min. The sample was centrifuged sequentially at 15,000 × g and 25,000 × g, both at 4 °C, with the supernatant collected in both instances followed by dialysis in distilled water and freeze-drying. Preparation of purified mucin from crude gastric or duodenal mucus followed a previously described procedure (22Davies J. Carlstedt I. Nilsson A.-K. Hakansson A. Sabharwal H. van Alphen L. van Ham M. Svanborg C. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2485-2492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) involving two cycles of equilibrium density gradient centrifugation for 48 h. Periodic acid-Schiff-positive fractions from the resulting cesium chloride gradient were pooled and freeze-dried. The sample was then diluted in an appropriate volume of 0.1 m phosphate buffer, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 6.8, and passed through a Sepharose CL-4B column preequilibrated in the same buffer. Fractions showing a single band of glycoprotein (∼66 kDa) as revealed in Coomassie Brilliant Blue- and periodic acid-Schiff-stained duplicate SDS-PAGE gels (run under reducing conditions) were pooled, dialyzed in PBS, pH 6.8, and stored in aliquots at −80 °C until use in an adherence assay. Purified swine gastric mucin was labeled withN-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin (734:1 biotin:protein molar ratio based on a mucin molecular weight of 2 × 106) with the reaction carried out at room temperature for 1 h. Unbound biotin was removed using a 15-ml capacity Centricon-10 concentrator (Amicon) and stocked at −80 °C until use. Duodenal mucin was purified from the duodenum of the same weanling pig using the same procedure as above but was not labeled. For adherence and competitive inhibition assays, the ELISA format was used. Unless specified, gastric mucin was used for all procedures involving mucin. The adhesion medium consisted of 20 mm phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 preadjusted to the desired pH. All tests were done in duplicate with two wells/sample/test. Wells were coated with substrate or ligand using 50 μl/well. Two blank wells in each plate not coated with receptor substrate but treated similarly as test wells were used to normalize optical density readings to base line. All quantitative analyses of test sample urease concentration that remained bound to the wells were based on the regression of a calibration curve generated by a known standard co-processed with the test samples. For all adherence assays, Immulon 2 ELISA plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 250 μg/ml substrate (unless stated otherwise) consisting of either mucin or crude mucus in neutral PBS or of heparin (Eastman Kodak Co.) or melted agarose (Seakem) in pH 9.6 carbonate-bicarbonate buffer. Plates were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h and washed three times with PBS-Tween before all assay procedures. To confirm the effect of pH on adherence, about 2.5 μg/ml biotinylated urease (32:1 biotin:protein molar ratio) in adhesion medium with a pH of 2.0–8.0 was incubated in wells precoated with mucin, heparin, crude gastric mucus, duodenal mucin, or melted agarose for 1 h at 37 °C. Unbound urease was removed by washing five times with 200 μl of the adhesion medium having the same pH as the test well. The remaining bound urease was heat-fixed for 10 min at 65 °C (water bath). Wells were washed three times with PBS-Tween, pH 7.4, probed with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase, and processed as in ELISA. To determine saturability of receptors, a 2-fold dilution of labeled urease was allowed to adhere to mucin-coated wells for 1 h at 37 °C (at pH 4.0, since labeled urease exhibited peak adherence at around this pH), and bound urease was probed by ELISA. In another experiment, ELISA wells were precoated overnight with a constant amount (5 μg/ml) of native urease (using pH 9.6 carbonate-bicarbonate coating buffer), and a 2-fold dilution of labeled mucin was allowed to adhere at pH 4.0 for 1 h at 37 °C followed by ELISA as described above. To determine the kinetics of adherence to mucin and heparin over time, biotinylated urease was prediluted at pH 4.0 and 7.0 (control) adhesion medium and incubated in mucin- or heparin-coated wells over a 5-h period. At several time points within this period, wells were washed five times with the adhesion medium having the same pH as the test well. Adherent urease was probed and quantified by ELISA as above. To probe the molecular make-up of urease receptor, a competitive inhibition assay was performed essentially following the same receptor-based ELISA using plate-immobilized heparin (250 μg/ml). Urease was mixed with 2-fold decreasing concentration of mucin, heparin-agarose, beaded agarose (Sepharose CL-4B, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), Cellufine sulfate, or cellulose (Takara) at pH 4.0 and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with gentle shaking. The mixtures were transferred to the heparin-coated wells and incubated with gentle shaking at 37 °C for only 30 min to avoid nonspecific adherence by heparinoid gel. The unbound urease with inhibitor was removed from each well by washing five times with pH 4.0 adhesion medium while the remaining urease was heat-fixed, and plates were processed by ELISA. To determine whether urease can prevent adherence of whole H. pylori cells, heparin or mucin was used as substrate (both precoated at 125 μg/ml) in an ELISA-based assay. A 2-fold dilution series of native urease at pH 4.0 with an initial concentration of about 380 mg/ml was allowed to adsorb to immobilized heparin or mucin for 1 h at 37 °C. A constant amount of biotinylated whole bacterial cells (10-fold dilution of 0.7 OD at 550 nm or about 1.43 × 107 colony-forming units/well) was dispensed to each well and incubated for anoth"
https://openalex.org/W2077921376,"We have recently described a novel mRNA denominated ScRG-1, the level of which is increased in the brains of Scrapie-infected mice (Dandoy-Dron, F., Guillo, F., Benboudjema, L., Deslys, J.-P., Lasmézas, C., Dormont, D., Tovey, M. G., and Dron, M. (1998) J. Biol. Chem.273, 7691–7697). The increase in ScRG-1 mRNA in the brain follows the accumulation of PrPSc, the proteinase K-resistant form of the prion protein (PrP), and precedes the widespread neuronal death that occurs in late stage disease. In the present study, we have isolated a cDNA encoding the human counterpart of ScRG-1. Comparison of the human and mouse transcripts firmly established that both sequences encode a highly conserved protein of 98 amino acids that contains a signal peptide, suggesting that the protein may be secreted. Examination of the distribution of human ScRG-1 mRNA in adult and fetal tissues revealed that the gene was expressed primarily in the central nervous system as a 0.7-kilobase message and was under strict developmental control. We have recently described a novel mRNA denominated ScRG-1, the level of which is increased in the brains of Scrapie-infected mice (Dandoy-Dron, F., Guillo, F., Benboudjema, L., Deslys, J.-P., Lasmézas, C., Dormont, D., Tovey, M.

The transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) 1The abbreviations used are: TSE, transmissible spongiform encephalopathies; CJD, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; PrP, prion protein; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; ORF, open reading frame; kb, kilobase(s); contig, group of overlapping clones; bp, base pair(s). are in a group of progressive neurodegenerative diseases that includes human pathologies such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Gerstman-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome and Kuru, and animal diseases such as scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (1Prusiner S.B. Science. 1997; 278: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). To identify the genes the altered expression of which is associated with or may even be responsible for the neurodegenerative changes observed in TSE, we have systematically analyzed modifications of gene expression in scrapie-infected mouse brain using “mRNA differential display” (2Dandoy-Dron F. Guillo F. Benboudjema L. Deslys J.-P. Lasmézas C. Dormont D. Tovey M.G. Dron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7691-7697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This approach has led to the detection of an increased level of expression of eight cellular genes. One of these genes, denominated scrapie-responsive gene 1 (ScRG-1), previously unrecognized, is expressed principally in the brain. Enhanced expression of ScRG-1 in the brain of scrapie-infected mice occurs concomitantly with increased expression of GFAP mRNA, a marker of astrocytosis (3Gomi H. Yokoyama T. Fujimoto K. Ikeda T. Katoh A. Itoh T. Itohara S. Neuron. 1995; 14: 29-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Moreover,ScRG-1 mRNA was found to be preferentially expressed in cells of glial origin and to encode a protein with a putative signal peptide (2Dandoy-Dron F. Guillo F. Benboudjema L. Deslys J.-P.

These observations suggest that ScRG-1 may play a role in the host response to prion-associated infections. Previous reports have suggested that certain molecules enhanced in TSE may be detrimental to neurone survival (4Brown D.R. Schmidt B. Kretzschmar H.A.

We report herein the nucleotide sequence, size characterization, and tissue distribution of human ScRG-1 mRNA. RNA was extracted from the brains of either mock infected C57Bl/6 mice or mice infected with the C506M3 strain of scrapie, as described previously (2Dandoy-Dron F. Guillo F. Benboudjema L.

Total RNA was extracted by the method of Chirgwin et al. (10Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar) from the frontal cortex obtained at autopsy from a patient free from any neurological disease (patient 941005, 46 years old) and from a patient with typical neuropathological findings of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (patient 93005, 59 years old). The diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of the proteinase K-resistant form of PrP in the sample (data not shown). Samples of normal human brain and of the brain from a patient diagnosed with CJD were obtained by informed consent, under the auspices of the Program de Recherche sur les Encéphalopathies Spongiformes Sub-aigües Transmissibles et les Prions (CNRS, France). Human poly(A)+ mRNA was obtained as described previously (2Dandoy-Dron F. Guillo F. Benboudjema L. Deslys J.-P. Lasmézas C. Dormont D. Tovey M.G. Dron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7691-7697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Northern blots were performed using glyoxal denaturation, and the blotted membranes were hybridized using probes radiolabeled to a specific activity of at least 1 × 109 cpm/mg, as described previously (2Dandoy-Dron F. Guillo F. Benboudjema L. Deslys J.-P. Lasmézas C. Dormont D. Tovey M.G. Dron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7691-7697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The blots were first exposed to autoradiography and then quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The multiple human tissue Northern blot and the membrane containing the RNA dots from different human tissues were from CLONTECH laboratories. 1 μg of poly(A)+ mRNA from the human control sample was primed with oligo(dT) and converted into double strand cDNA using standard procedures. One-twentieth of the cDNA synthesized was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using specific forward (5′-TAAGGGAAAATCACGCTGTG-3′) and reverse (5′-CTTTTATTACTACTTGTTTAACAC-3′) primers and Taq DNA polymerase. The amplified product was purified, sequenced using the Thermo Sequenase cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and further cloned in the pCR2.1 Topo plasmid vector from Invitrogen. MouseScRG-1 cDNA was isolated by screening a library of whole BALB/c adult brain cDNA cloned in λgt11, with the ScRG-1 cDNA clone 24 previously isolated by RACE (2Dandoy-Dron F. Guillo F. Benboudjema L. Deslys J.-P. Lasmézas C. Dormont D. Tovey M.G. Dron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7691-7697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) used as a probe. The cDNA inserted in the selected lambda (clone 1) was isolated and further sequenced. To isolate the human counterpart of the mouse ScRG-1 cDNA, the murine sequence (2Dandoy-Dron F. Guillo F. Benboudjema L. Deslys J.-P. Lasmézas C. Dormont D. Tovey M.G. Dron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7691-7697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) was compared with the randomly isolated human cDNA sequences reported as expressed sequence tags. The sequences potentially related to the mouse cDNA were combined in a contig and used to establish a human consensus sequence corresponding to a putative 902-bp cDNA. To ascertain the existence of the human ScRG-1 mRNA, primers derived from the 5′ and 3′ ends of the consensus sequence were used to synthesize cDNA from human brain mRNA by specific reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction amplification. An unique cDNA fragment of the predicted size was obtained, cloned, and sequenced (Fig. 1 A). Mapping using expressed sequence tag cDNA related to ScRG-1 indicated that the human gene was located on the long arm of chromosome four (4q31–4q32). The sequence of the human cDNA was compared with the 700-bp murineScRG-1 cDNA. The two sequences were found to be very similar with an homology of 75.8% in an overlap of 720 nucleotides (Fig. 1 A). The human cDNA contained an open reading frame (ORF) at positions 414–710 encoding a protein exhibiting strong homology with the protein predicted from the murine ScRG-1cDNA (Fig. 1 B). The human ORF was found to encode a protein of 98 amino acids, which is 51 amino acids more than previously predicted for the murine protein (2Dandoy-Dron F. Guillo F. Benboudjema L. Deslys J.-P. Lasmézas C. Dormont D. Tovey M.G. Dron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7691-7697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Comparison of human and murine cDNA sequences indicated that introduction of a one-nucleotide gap in the murine ORF would generate an open reading frame corresponding to a protein of 98 amino acids the sequence of which would be almost identical to that encoded by the human ScRG-1 cDNA. This prompted us to clone a new mouse brain ScRG-1 cDNA from a lambda library, using as a probe the ScRG-1 cDNA clone 24 previously isolated by RACE (2Dandoy-Dron F. Guillo F. Benboudjema L. Deslys J.-P. Lasmézas C. Dormont D. Tovey M.G. Dron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7691-7697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The sequence of clone 1 obtained from the library was then determined (Fig. 1 A). The nucleotide sequences of the different cDNAs previously obtained by RACE (2Dandoy-Dron F. Guillo F. Benboudjema L. Deslys J.-P. Lasmézas C. Dormont D. Tovey M.G. Dron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7691-7697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) were also re-examined. The mouse ORF, which was reported to contain two guanosines at positions 345 and 346, was found in fact to contain three guanosines at positions 345, 346, and 347, immediately following a sequence consisting of a succession of nucleotides repeated twice, thereby constructing an imperfect palindrome. The additional guanosine signal (position 345) was very weak in intensity and abnormally close to the following nucleotide. The presence of the “missing G” was confirmed by sequencing a recently isolated murine genomic DNA clone ofScRG-1 (data not shown). The corrected nucleotide sequence of the mouse brain ScRG-1 cDNA and derived amino acid sequence (Fig. 1, A and B) have been reported in the data bases. Comparison of the human and mouse ScRG-1 coding sequences showed that 82.5% of the amino acids of the two predicted proteins are identical, with a stretch of 40 identical contiguous amino acids in the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein (Fig. 1 B). TheScRG-1 proteins exhibit no apparent homology with other known proteins. Both the human and murine proteins contain a cleavable signal peptide of 20 amino acids in length. Furthermore, the probability that ScRG-1 is external to the plasma membrane is 56% for the murine protein and 48% for human protein according to the PSORT II program of protein localization site prediction. The predicted molecular mass of the mature protein for the two species is approximately 9 kDa, which is in the range of the molecular weight of most cytokines and neurotransmitters. A N-glycosylation site was detected at positions 72–75 of the protein for both species so that the molecular weight of the ScRG-1 protein could be substantially higher in vivo. A tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site was also detected at positions 63–70 in both proteins. Northern blot analysis was carried out using RNA from both human and mouse brain to determine the size of the transcripts in the two species. 14 individual RNA species were used as molecular weight markers. The blot was split in two parts to separate the mouse and human samples, and each part was hybridized under stringent conditions with a radiolabeled probe derived from murine and human ScRG-1 cDNA, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B). One band corresponding to 0.7 kb in size was detected in the human samples and as expected, two bands of 2.6 and 0.7 kb were detected in the murine samples. A very faint band of 2.6 kb was also revealed upon overexposure of the autoradiograms of the human blot (data not shown). The faster migrating band was relatively broad, with an estimated size of between 0.66 and 0.82 kb (mean size of 0.74 kb) in both species. Quantification by PhosphorImager indicated that the 0.7-kb message represented at least 75–80% of the ScRG-1 transcripts in murine brain and about 98% of the transcripts in human brain. The relative abundance of the ScRG-1 mRNA in this organ was about 40 times less than the level of β-actin mRNA in both species. We have reported previously that the 0.7-kb ScRG-1transcript is overexpressed 2–3-fold in scrapie-infected mouse brain (Ref. 2Dandoy-Dron F. Guillo F. Benboudjema L. Deslys J.-P. Lasmézas C. Dormont D. Tovey M.G. Dron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7691-7697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar and Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2 B, the level of the 2.6-kb transcript is also increased 2–3-fold in this experimental model of TSE disease. It was of interest to determine whether the level of human ScRG-1 mRNA is increased in samples of brain from patients with CJD. Poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated from normal human brain and from the brain (frontal cortex) of a patient diagnosed with CJD. The expression of ScRG-1 mRNA was examined by Northern blot analysis using human ScRG-1cDNA as a probe (Fig. 2 A). ScRG-1 mRNA was found to be 3-fold more abundant in the brain of a patient with CJD than in the brain of a normal individual. In contrast, β-actin mRNA levels were similar in both samples (Fig. 2 A). As expected an increased expression of GFAP transcripts was also detected in the CJD mRNA, indicating that a glial reaction had occurred in the brain tissue examined (Fig. 2 A), and the presence of proteinase K-resistant PrP was also clearly detected in this sample (data not shown). Although these results are highly suggestive, only two individuals have been compared and any definitive conclusion concerning the expression of the ScRG-1 gene will have to await more extensive studies, particularly those employing the techniques of in situ hybridization and/or immunocytochemistry in addition to Northern blot analysis. It is quite possible that the increased expression observed results from the activation of a particular subset of cells in the brain. Thus, the increase in ScRG-1 mRNA detected using Northern blot analysis may underestimate an increased expression in a particular cell population, because all brain cells contribute to the mRNA analyzed by this method. Interestingly, the level of cathepsin S transcripts was also found to be higher in the CJD RNA sample examined (Fig. 2 A) in agreement with the 3–8-fold increase in the cathepsin S mRNA, which has been reported in scrapie-infected mouse brain (2Dandoy-Dron F. Guillo F. Benboudjema L. Deslys J.-P. Lasmézas C. Dormont D. Tovey M.G. Dron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7691-7697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The gliosis that precedes the spongiosis and neuronal death in TSE consists of both an astrocytosis and a microglial activation. The increased expression of ScRG-1 and cathepsin S transcripts that we observed in CJD brain tissue may result from this double cellular activation. In Alzeihmer's disease an increased expression of cathepsin S has been reported to reflect the activation of microglial cells (11Lemere C.A. Munger J.S. Shi G.P. Natkin L. Haass C. Chapman H.A. Selkoe D.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 848-860PubMed Google Scholar). The laminin receptor, which has recently been shown to interact with PrP, may constitute a receptor for this protein (12Rigier R. Edenhoffer F. Lasmezas C.I. Weiss S. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The laminin receptor is increased 2-fold in extracts of brain from scrapie-infected mice (12Rigier R. Edenhoffer F. Lasmezas C.I. Weiss S. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), indicating that even a modest increase in the level of expression of a gene may be of considerable biological importance in such disorders. Although mouse ScRG-1 mRNA was found to be expressed preferentially in brain tissue (2Dandoy-Dron F. Guillo F. Benboudjema L. Deslys J.-P. Lasmézas C. Dormont D. Tovey M.G. Dron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7691-7697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), the expressed sequence tags related to ScRG-1 and used to define primers to isolate the human cDNA (see above) were recovered from various tissues including brain, testis, aorta, and pregnant uterus. It was of interest therefore to determine the specificity of expression of the gene in different tissues, using a membrane to which poly(A)+ RNA from 50 human tissues have been immobilized in separate dots (Fig. 3). ScRG-1 is abundantly expressed in the central nervous system of the adult, in all the areas of brain investigated, and in spinal cord but is poorly or not expressed at all in fetal brain, indicating marked developmental regulation of the gene. A high level of ScRG-1 transcripts was also observed in testis and aorta, organs with low specificity of expression, which is in agreement with the report of expressed sequence tags from these tissues. We also analyzed, by Northern blotting, mRNA from various human tissues, heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas for the presence ofScRG-1 mRNA (Fig. 2 C). The ScRG-1message was highly expressed in the brain as expected and also to a 6-fold lesser extent in the heart. A faint signal was also detected upon overexposure of the blot in almost all the organs examined, indicating that the low level of hybridization observed in most of the human organs and shown in Fig. 3 corresponds to a real albeit low level of expression (data not shown). The increased level of expression ofScRG-1 transcripts in scrapie-infected mouse brain (2Dandoy-Dron F. Guillo F. Benboudjema L. Deslys J.-P. Lasmézas C. Dormont D. Tovey M.G. Dron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7691-7697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and probably also in the brain of CJD-infected individuals suggests thatScRG-1 may be involved in the neurodegenerative process in TSE. Indeed, the ScRG-1 protein may play an important physiological role in the central nervous system, as indicated by the high degree of conservation of its amino acid sequence in both man and mouse, the presence of a cleavable signal peptide indicating that the ScRG-1 protein is secreted outside the cell, and its high level of expression in the central nervous system. The potential importance of the gene is also emphasized by the observation that its expression is under developmental regulation."

The functional domains responsible for its suppressive activity are defined, including the DNA-binding domain and the ligand-binding domain. The C-terminal 30 amino acid residues can be deleted without compromising its suppressive activity, whereas a deletion for 40 amino acids completely abolishes the suppressive activity and receptor dimerization, and reduces the DNA-binding affinity. Point mutation at three conserved leucine residues located on the predicted dimer interface abolishes the suppressive activity, receptor dimerization and its DNA binding property. However, mutation at two consecutive glutamate residues located within the hinge between the last two helices of the ligand-binding domain (helix 10 and helix 11 according to the human retinoid receptor X α structure) drastically reduces its DNA-binding affinity and abrogates the suppressive activity without compromising its ability to dimerize, indicating that receptor dimerization property can be functionally uncoupled from its suppressive activity. A transferable, active silencing activity is encoded within the DEF segment of the receptor molecule, as evidenced by the suppression of a GAL4 reporter by a chimeric protein containing the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 and the DEF segment of TR2-11. Moreover, the C-terminal 49 amino acid sequence is required for this trans-suppressive activity.

Nuclear receptors constitute a large family of transcription factors that play key roles in gene regulation. Many of these receptors are transcription regulators that modulate target gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences in its promoter region (1Wahli W. Martinez E. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2243-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 2Glass C.K. Endocrine Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar, 3Zhang X. Pfahl M. Trends Endocrinol.

These include the receptors for glucocorticoid, estrogen, progesterone, vitamin D, thyroid hormone, and retinoic acid, as well as a large number of orphan members that have no known ligands. The nuclear receptors share a common modular structure consisting of a variable N terminus, a DNA-binding domain (DBD) 1The abbreviations used are: DBD, DNA-binding domain; DR, direct repeat; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; LBD, ligand-binding domain; N-CoR, nuclear receptor corepressor; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RA, retinoic acid; RAR, retinoic acid receptor, RXR, retinoid receptor X; RARE, retinoic acid response element; SMRT, silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor; TBP, TATA box-binding protein; tk; thymidine kinase. in the middle of the receptor molecule, and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) (1Wahli W.

The LBD determines the ligand specificity by formation of a highly specified binding pocket and mediates receptor dimerization by interacting at the dimerization interface located on the LBD surface. In their apo-forms, nuclear receptors function as repressors by interacting with corepressors, such as the nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR) (7Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar). These corepressors interact with the apo-receptors at their hinge regions between the DBD and LBD. Ligand binding induces a conformational change of the receptor, resulting in the release of the corepressor and recruiting of the co-activator, which binds to the activation function-2 (AF-2) domain located at the C terminus of the receptor molecule (9Joyeux A.

Direct interaction with the components of the basal transcription machinery such as transcription factor IIB and TATA box-binding protein (TBP) has also been implicated in the ligand-independent silencing activity of some of these receptors (15Fondell J.D.

The mouse TR2-11 is a member of the orphan receptors and is expressed mainly in the developing germ cells in the testis (17Lee C.-H. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Wei L.-N.

Chang L. Wei L.-N. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 152: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have shown that the full-length receptor strongly suppresses reporters containing either a direct repeat-5 (DR5) (18Lee C.-H. Chang L. Wei L.-N. Mol. Reprod.

In contrast, the truncated receptor exerts no consistent biological activities in similar transient transfection experiments, despite the presence of an intact DBD. By comparing the primary structures of the nuclear receptors, the full-length TR2-11 receptor is much larger than most other nuclear receptors due to the extraordinary large DEF segment of its coding region (approximately 435 amino acid residues for TR2-11, as compared with approximately 200–300 amino acids for most other receptors) (24Wurtz J.-M. Bourguet W. Renaud J.-P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). In order to understand how TR2-11 suppresses gene expression as demonstrated by many previous studies (18Lee C.-H. Chang L. Wei L.-N. Mol. Reprod.

Chem. 1995; 271: 10405-10412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we have set up to dissect the functional domains responsible for its biological activity and to determine whether TR2-11 employs any unique pathway or adopts similar mechanisms employed by other receptors for a strongly suppressive activity. In this study, the molecular mechanisms underlying the suppressive activity of TR2-11 were dissected in the established DR5 reporter system (18Lee C.-H. Chang L. Wei L.-N. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1996; 44: 305-314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this system, it has been shown that RA induction of the reporter was dramatically suppressed by the full-length TR2-11 receptor, but not by the truncated variant. Here, we first examined the mutant receptors made by deletion and point mutagenesis, in their dimerizing ability and DNA binding property, and compared these properties to their suppressive activities in the DR5 reporter system. We then examined the role of the predicted ninth heptad repeat within the LBD in receptor dimerization, DNA binding, and suppressive activity. We further identified one conserved glutamate residue located between helices 10 and 11, which was critical for the suppressive activity and DNA-binding affinity, but not for receptor dimerization. We went on to determine whether its suppressive activity is transferable by using the GAL4 fusion protein system. Finally, we explored the possibility of its interaction with the common corepressor N-CoR as well as heterodimerization with RAR/RXR family. The reporter, RARE-tk-luc, containing a DR5 was made as described previously (18Lee C.-H. Chang L. Wei L.-N. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1996; 44: 305-314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RAR-luc reporter was constructed by fusion of a promoter fragment between positions −99 and −11 of the hRARβ gene (27de The H. Vivanca-Ruiz M. Tiollais P. Stunnenberg H. Dejean A.

The cytomegalovirus vector containing the full-length TR2-11 (590 amino acid residues) for mammalian expression was as described previously (22Chinpaisal C. Chang L. Hu X. Lee C.-H. Wen W.-N. Wei L.-N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14088-14095Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The amino acid numbering system was according to our previous study (18Lee C.-H. Chang L. Wei L.-N. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1996; 44: 305-314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To construct the C-terminal deletions of TR2-11, fragments deleted in various sizes from the C terminus were generated by polymerase chain reactions (PCRs), flanked by HindIII and XbaI sites and used to replace the HindIII/XbaI fragment of the wild type expression vector. TR2ΔC49, TR2ΔC40, TR2ΔC30, TR2ΔC20, and TR2ΔC10 were each deleted for 49, 40, 30, 20, and 10 amino acids, respectively, from the C terminus. TR2ΔN1 was deleted in the N-terminal amino acid residues 1–99 (the N-terminal variable region), and TR2ΔN2 was deleted in the N-terminal 166 amino acids (the N-terminal variable region and the DBD). Point mutations were generated using a two-step PCR protocol (28Wu R Recombinant DNA Methodology II. Academeic Press, 1995: 323-332Crossref Google Scholar). The mutated fragment flanked byHindIII and XbaI sites were used to replace theHindIII/XbaI fragment in the wild type vector. The LLL(537–539)YPP mutant was mutated at the consecutive three leucine residues (positions 537–539) by replacing the wild type sequence TTACTTCTC with a mutant sequence TATCCTCCC. The EE(553,554)RG mutant was mutated at the two glutamate residues at positions 553 and 554 by replacing the wild type sequence GAAGAG with a mutant sequence CGAGGG. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion of TR2-11-f and all mutants were constructed by ligating the in-frame cDNA cassettes from the cytomegalovirus expression vectors using the 5′BglII site in front of the ATG start codon and the 3′SmaI sites into predigested BglII/SmaI pEGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH) downstream of the GFP coding region. The double stranded DNA fragments containing the DR5 of the human RARβ promoter were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow fragment (Boehringer Mannheim). TR2-11 and its mutants were synthesized using a T7-coupled transcription/translation reticulocyte lysate system (TNT system, Promega, Madison, WI). The reactions were conducted as described (22Chinpaisal C. Chang L. Hu X. Lee C.-H. Wen W.-N. Wei L.-N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14088-14095Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, the in vitro translated products were incubated with 32P-labeled probes (1 ng) for 20 min at room temperature in the presence of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 10% glycerol. Protein-DNA complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis in 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, followed by autoradiography. To determine the Kd values of receptor binding to the DR5, the signals of specifically shifted bands were quantified using a phosphorimager and used to construct Scatchard plots as described (22Chinpaisal C. Chang L. Hu X. Lee C.-H. Wen W.-N. Wei L.-N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14088-14095Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum treated with charcoal. To determine the suppressive activity of TR2-11 and its mutants, the reporters (RARE-tk-luc or RAR-luc), the receptor expression vector, and an internal control vector (SV40-lacZ) were co-transfected into COS cells by calcium phosphate coprecipitation (22Chinpaisal C. Chang L. Hu X. Lee C.-H. Wen W.-N. Wei L.-N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14088-14095Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Typically, 0.1 μg of each expression vector, 0.3 μg of the reporter, and 0.05 μg of the internal control plasmid were used. Cells were plated at the density of 5 × 104/well in 24-well plates overnight before transfection. For RA induction, RA (5 × 10−7m) was added into the medium 20–24 h following transfection and incubated for another 20–24 h before collection of the samples. Luciferase and lacZ activities were determined as described previously (22Chinpaisal C. Chang L. Hu X. Lee C.-H. Wen W.-N. Wei L.-N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14088-14095Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The specific reporter activity was represented as relative luciferase units by normalizing to the internal control lacZ activity. Each experiment was carried out in duplicate cultures, and three to four independent experiments were conducted to obtain the means and the standard error of the mean (S.E.). To determine the trans-suppressive activity of TR2-11, GAL4 fusion proteins were generated and tested on a luciferase reporter containing five copies of the GAL4-binding site at the 5′ of a thymidine kinase promoter, designated as (GAL)5-tk-luc. The mammalian expression vectors of fusion proteins were generated using the mammalian MATCHMAKER two-hybrid assay kit (CLONTECH). Transfection procedure and determination of reporter activities were as described above. To generate GAL4 fusion, i.e. pBD-TR2ΔN2, pBD-TR2ΔN2ΔC49, and pBD-TR2(518–590), the GAL4-binding domain (amino acids 1–147) was fused, in frame, to the entire DEF segment, the DEF deleted in the C-terminal 49 amino acids, and the amino acid residue 518–590, respectively. Yeast strain YRG-2 containing a lacZ reporter controlled by three copies of GAL4 binding sites, the bait plasmid expressing the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain (pBD), and the prey plasmid expressing the yeast activation domain of yeast GAL4 (pAD) were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). A series of bait and prey constructs were made by fusing various fragments of the LBD of TR2-11 into the pBD and the pAD vectors. The fragments were synthesized by PCR or retrieved from the existing cDNA vectors. The mRARα prey and bait each contains the full-length receptor. The mRXRβ bait and prey each contains amino acids 148–410 (29Schulman I.G. Chakravarti D. Juguilon H. Romo A. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8288-8292Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The N-CoR prey contains amino acids 1843–2453 (7Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar) fused to the pAD vector. The TR2-11 baits include the full-length (TR2), the DEF segment (TR2ΔN2), the DEF deleted in the C-terminal 49 amino acids (TR2ΔN2ΔC49), and the two point mutants (TR2ΔN2-LLL/YPP and TR2ΔN2-EE/RG). The TR2-11 preys include the DEF segment (TR2ΔN2), a smaller DEF segment (amino acids 238–590) deleted at its N-terminal portion, TR2-LBD (22Chinpaisal C. Chang L. Hu X. Lee C.-H. Wen W.-N. Wei L.-N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14088-14095Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), as well as the four C-terminal deletions of the DEF segment (TR2ΔN2ΔC10, TR2ΔN2ΔC20, TR2ΔN2ΔC30, TR2ΔN2ΔC40). The positive controls p53 and pSV40 were purchased from Stratagene. The yeast culture, transformation procedures, and determination of lacZ activity were as described previously (22Chinpaisal C. Chang L. Hu X. Lee C.-H. Wen W.-N. Wei L.-N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14088-14095Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The full-length TR2-11 cDNA was cloned into the pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for the production of GST fusion protein. For in vitro interactions, a total of 5 μg of fusion protein produced in bacteria, GST-TR2 or GST alone, was bound to a glutathione-agarose column and incubated with35S-labeled TR2-11 protein made in TNT reactions. The binding buffer contains 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm Mg Cl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, and a protease inhibitor mixture. Incubation was conducted for 60 min at 4 C. The unbound protein was removed by five washes with a solution of the binding buffer without bovine serum albumin and protease inhibitors. The specifically bound protein was eluted with 50 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mmTris, pH 8.0, and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In our previous studies, we have demonstrated that TR2-11 exerted a strongly suppressive activity on the reporters containing either a DR5 type RARE (from the human RARβ promoter) (18Lee C.-H. Chang L. Wei L.-N. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1996; 44: 305-314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or a DR4 type hormone response element (from the mouse CRABP-I promoter) (22Chinpaisal C. Chang L. Hu X. Lee C.-H. Wen W.-N. Wei L.-N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14088-14095Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this study, we have utilized two reporter systems to dissect the mechanisms of the suppressive activity of TR2-11. The first was a DR5 artificial reporter (RARE-tk-luc) that had been widely used to study RA induction mediated by a DR5 element. In order to confirm the fidelity of responses observed in this artificial reporter, we also included a natural promoter from which this DR5 was derived, the RARβ promoter, a well established gene directly responding to RA induction (27de The H. Vivanca-Ruiz M. Tiollais P. Stunnenberg H. Dejean A. Nature. 1990; 343: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). To first define the functional domains of TR2-11 that were required for its suppressive activity, we began by systematic deletions from the N and C termini of the wild type receptor, and followed by making specific point mutations in the LBD of TR2-11. Fig. 1 A shows the maps of two N-terminal deletions, five C-terminal deletions, and four point mutations used in these studies. The suppressive activity of each receptor on RA induction of the RARE-tk-luc and the RAR-luc reporters was assessed in transient transfection assays and the results are shown in Fig. 1 (B and C, respectively). As compared with the transfection with a control expression vector (lane CMV), expression of the wild type TR2-11 (TR2-11-f) or three small C-terminal deletions (lanes TR2ΔC10, TR2ΔC20, TR2ΔC30, and data not shown), resulted in 50–60% inhibition of RA induction on RARE-tk-luc activity and 75–80% inhibition on RAR-luc activity. In contrast, deletion of 49 amino acids from the C terminus (TR2ΔC49) completely abolished the suppressive effect of TR2-11 on both reporters. Interestingly, the 40-amino acid deletion (TR2ΔC40) only partially abolished the receptor function in the RAR-luc reporter (Fig. 1 C), yet it affected the receptor function in the RARE-tk-luc reporter more dramatically (Fig. 1 B). As expected, further truncations (94 amino acids or larger) also resulted in the complete loss of the suppressive activity (data not shown). The N-terminal deletion mutant which retained the intact DBD remained suppressive (lane TR2ΔN1), whereas a further deletion into the DBD completely abolished the suppressive activity (lane TR2ΔN2). Collectively, these data demonstrate that both the N-terminal variable region and the C-terminal 30 amino acid sequence are not required for the suppressive activity of TR2-11 on either reporter, the region between the 30th and the 40th amino acid from the C terminus exerts slightly different effects between the two reporter systems, whereas the DBD and the LBD are important for the suppressive biological activity in both reporter systems. Amino acid comparison of TR2-11 and other receptors revealed a striking sequence homology in the region containing the heptad repeats 7–9, which corresponded to helices 9–11 according to the x-ray structure data (30Baurguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). Within this region, a contiguous LLL sequence located in the ninth heptad repeat is most highly conserved. The LLL sequence was mutated into YPP, designated as LLL(537–539)YPP. As shown in Fig. 1(B and C), the mutated receptor failed to exert the suppressive activity in both reporter systems. This result demonstrates a critical function of these conserved leucine residues in the suppressive activity of TR2-11. The observation that deletion of 40 amino acids, but not 30 amino acids, from the C terminus of TR2-11 resulted in a loss of the suppressive activity suggested an important role of the 10 amino acids (between the 30th and the 40th residues from the C terminus) in this receptor activity. Sequence comparison among various nuclear receptors revealed that this 10-amino acid sequence constituted the hinge region between helices 10 and 11, as well as the N-terminal portion of helix 11. Most interestingly, a glutamate residue (Glu-553) in the hinge region was conserved among TR2-11, RXRα, RARα, and RARγ. We then asked whether the hinge region between helices 10 and 11 was important for the suppressive activity. The two consecutive glutamate residues were first mutated to arginine and glycine, designated as EE(553,554)RG, and tested in transient transfection experiments. As shown in Fig. 1 (B and C), this mutation completely abolished the suppressive activity in both reporter systems. To determine which glutamate residue was important, single mutation was generated, designated as EE(553–554)RE (mutated at Glu-553) and EE(553–554)EG (mutated at Glu-554). We found that mutation at Glu-553 (EE/RE), but not Glu-554 (EE/EG), abolished the suppressive activity. Therefore, it is concluded that the conserved glutamate residue (Glu-553) plays an important role in TR2-11-mediated suppression. The failure of the mutant receptors to exert an effect on these reporters raised a concern about the possibility of altered mutant protein stability or defect in protein trafficking; we then examined whether these mutant receptors were made inside the cells and properly transported into the nuclei, by using a GFP-tag strategy as shown in Fig. 1 D. The wild type receptor tagged with GFP showed a distinct nuclear localization pattern (Fig 1 D,a), which was also observed for the receptors of C-terminal deletions (b) and point mutations (c). In contrast, the receptor deleted in the N terminus and the DBD, ΔN2, which was deleted in the putative nuclear localization signal, exhibited a completely cytosolic distribution (d). The N-terminal deletion (ΔN1) also showed a nuclear retention pattern identical to the wild type pattern (data not shown). In addition, protein stability of all these mutant proteins remained relatively constant, as evidenced by the fact that all the nuclear fluorescent signal could be followed for the same duration. We also tested the biological activity of the receptors tagged with GFP in the reporter systems, and a similar pattern of biological activity as that shown in Fig. 1 (B and C) was observed for these GFP-tagged receptors (data not shown). From these results, it is concluded that all the mutant receptors, except ΔN2, which is deleted in both the N terminus and the DBD, are made, folded properly and transported into the nuclei. Dimerization is essential for the function of most nuclear receptors. Two dimerization interfaces have been defined, one within the second zinc finger of the DBD and the other within the LBD (31Perlmann T. Umesono K. Rangarajan P.N. Forman B.M. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 958-966PubMed Google Scholar). We first would like to confirm whether dimerization of TR2-11 occurred in vivo and if dimerization was also required for the suppressive activity of TR2-11. The ability of TR2-11 and its deletion mutants to form homodimers was examined in the yeast two-hybrid interaction assay. Various portions of TR2-11were cloned in the yeast expression vectors and tested by co-transfection of the bait and the prey vectors into the yeast. As shown in Fig. 2 A, receptors containing the DEF segment remained capable of dimerization (column 2), whereas deleting the C-terminal 49 amino acids rendered receptors unable to dimerize (column 3). Moreover, the interaction between the wild type receptors (column 4) is much stronger than the positive control, between p53 and SV40 large T-antigen (column 1), suggesting a rather strong interaction between the dimer partners. To further dissect the sequence required for this interaction, small deletions from the C terminus were cloned into the prey vector and tested in similar interaction assays as shown in Fig. 2 B. In consistence with the results of their suppressive activities (Fig. 1, B and C), receptors deleted for up to 30 amino acids from the C terminus (columns 3–5) remained capable of interacting with the wild type receptor, while further deletion to 40 amino acids (column 6) drastically affected the interaction between the dimer partners. Therefore, it is concluded that deletion from the C-terminal 40 amino acids of TR2-11 abolishes both receptor dimerization property and its ability to suppress target gene expression. In transfection experiments as shown in Fig. 1,"

S., and Borchardt, R. T. (1992) <i>Antivir. Res.</i> 19, 247–265). In this study, we describe the effects of a mechanism-based inhibitor, 6′-bromo-5′,6′-didehydro-6′-deoxy-6′-fluorohomoadenosine (BDDFHA), which functions as a substrate for the ""6′-hydrolytic activity"" of the enzyme with subsequent formation of a covalent linkage with the enzyme. Incubation of human placental AdoHcy hydrolase with BDDFHA results in a maximum inactivation of 83% with the remaining enzyme activity exhibiting one-third of the <i>k</i> <sub>cat</sub> value of the native enzyme. This partial inactivation is concomitant with the release of both Br<sup>−</sup> and F<sup>−</sup> ions and the formation of adenine (Ade). The enzyme can be covalently labeled with [8-<sup>3</sup>H]BDDFHA, resulting in a stoichiometry of 2 mol of BDDFHA/mol of the tetrameric enzyme. The <sup>3</sup>H-labeled enzyme retains its original NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH content. Tryptic digestion and subsequent protein sequencing of the [8-<sup>3</sup>H]BDDFHA-labeled enzyme revealed that Arg<sup>196</sup> is the residue that is associated with the radiolabeled inhibitor. The partition ratio of the Ade formation (nonlethal event) to covalent acylation (lethal event) is approximately 1:1. From these experimental results, a possible mechanism by which BDDFHA inactivates AdoHcy hdyrolase is proposed: enzyme-mediated water addition at the C-6′ position of BDDFHA followed by elimination of Br<sup>−</sup> ion results in the formation of homoAdo 6′-carboxyl fluoride (HACF). HACF then partitions in two ways: (<i>a</i>) attack by a proximal nucleophile (Arg<sup>196</sup>) to form an amide bond after expulsion of F<sup>−</sup> ion (lethal event) or (<i>b</i>) depurination to form Ade and hexose-derived 6-carboxyl fluoride (HDCF), which is further hydrolyzed to hexose-derived 6-carboxylic acid (HDCA) and F<sup>−</sup> ion (nonlethal event)."

Here, we demonstrate that STAT activation by EGF treatment is conditional. EGF activates STAT1 and STAT3 in A431 but not in HeLa and PC12 cells. Using a reconstituted in vitro STAT activation system, we have identified and partially purified a potential inhibitor (s) that is membrane-associated and can block STAT activation induced by EGF in vitro. However, this inhibitor has no effect on STAT complexes after they are formed. We have further shown that this inhibitor(s) also exists in many other cancer cell lines, suggesting that blocking the STAT activation during growth factor signal transduction may play a significant role in the development of many kinds of cancers."

They activate their amino acid substrates in a two-step process involving aminoacyl adenylate formation and subsequent thioesterification at specific thiol groups (thiotemplates).

Their arrangement along the multifunctional polypeptide chain is usually colinear to the sequence of the amino acid components in the peptide product. Such modules can be subdivided into three main domains responsible (a) for amino acid recognition, binding, and the primary activation as aminoacyl adenylates, (b) for the thiolation of the amino acid substrates, and (c) for peptide elongation, in some cases in concert with amino acid epimerization.Recently we demonstrated by affinity labeling of gramicidin S synthetase at its thiolation centers and analysis of isolated active site peptides that each module of this multienzyme is equipped with its own 4′-phosphopantetheine (4′-PPan) 1The abbreviations used are: PPan, phosphopantetheine; GS1, phenylalanine racemase, EC 5.1.1.11(gramicidin S synthetase 1); GS2, gramicidin S synthetase 2; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization. 1The abbreviations used are: PPan, phosphopantetheine; GS1, phenylalanine racemase, EC 5.1.1.11(gramicidin S synthetase 1); GS2, gramicidin S synthetase 2; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization. cofactor (5Stein T.

The sulfhydryl group of the cofactors cysteamine component functions as the thiotemplate site for the specific amino acid substrate. Each of these mobile 4′-PPan carriers is connected in a phosphodiester linkage with a specific serine that is part of a strictly conserved consensus motif LGG(H/D)S(L/I). On the basis of these results we developed a multiple carrier model of nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis (5Stein T. Vater J. Kruft V. Otto A. Wittmann-Liebold B. Franke P. Panico M. McDowell R. Morris H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15426-15435Google Scholar). This new concept replaces the old version of the thiotemplate mechanism, which was proposed by several groups in the early seventies (1Lipmann F. Acc. Chem. Res. 1973; 6: 361-367Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 2Laland S.G. Zimmer T.-L. Essays Biochem. 1973; 9: 31-57PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kurahashi K. Annu. Rev.

The old model postulated a single central 4′-PPan carrier for peptide elongation that was assumed to interact during the elongation cycle with peripheral thiols charged with the amino acid substrates in thioester linkage.According to our new concept the growing peptide chain is assembled in a series of transpeptidation reactions by successive unidirectional interaction of the individual 4′-PPan carriers thioesterified with substrates or peptide intermediates. After transpeptidation the elongated peptide chain should be attached to the 4′-PPan cofactor specific for the binding of the C-terminal amino acid. This means that in the case of gramicidin S synthetase, for example, the di-, tri-, and tetrapeptide intermediate would be bound as thioesters to the 4′-PPan cofactor at the proline, valine, and ornithine reaction centers, respectively. Unfortunately, thed-Phe-Pro-dipeptide and thed-Phe-Pro-Val-Orn-tetrapeptide complexes of gramicidin S synthetase 2 (GS2) are unstable because of internal cyclization reactions (10von Döhren H.

In this communication we have identified the d-Phe-Pro-Val-attachment site of gramicidin S synthetase 2. This research is of general interest to understand the mechanism of nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis on the molecular level.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAs demonstrated in our previous studies each amino acid activating module of a peptide synthetase using the thiotemplate mechanism is equipped with its own 4′-PPan cofactor that functions as the thiolation site for the cognate amino acids substrate (5Stein T.

Franke P. Panico Maria Mc Dowell R. Morris H.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). On the basis of these results a multiple carrier model was proposed that claims that the growing peptide chain is assembled during the elongation cycle in a series of transpeptidation steps. Each peptide intermediate should be bound to the 4′-PPan carrier of that module, which is responsible for the thiolation of the C-terminal amino acid component. To verify these predictions we investigated the binding site of GS2 for the tripeptided-phenylalanyl-prolyl-valine. This intermediate is well suited for such experiments, because of the high stability of its thioester bond with the corresponding reaction center of GS2 (13Gadow A. Vater J. Schlumbohm W. Palacz Z. Salnikow J. Kleinkauf H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 132: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For this purpose we labeled gramicidin S synthetase with the radioactive tripeptide as outlined under “Experimental Procedures” using eitherl-[14C]phenylalanine orl-[14C]valine as tracer.Tripeptide formation was monitored by TLC on silica gel DC 60 plates atR f = 0.72 with butanol:acetic acid:water (4:1:1) as the mobile phase (Fig. 1). Control samples contained the same reaction mixture from whichl-proline was omitted. Under these conditions phenylalanine and valine were incorporated into GS as thioesters. After cleavage with alkali, they were detected in free form on the TLC plates instead of the tripeptide at R f = 0.62 andR f = 0.52, respectively. In the case of [14C]phenylalanine as tracer free phenylalanine was detected in addition to the tripeptide, which was released from GS1 by hydrolysis.To investigate the binding site of the tripeptide intermediate to gramicidin S synthetase 2, the GS2-d-Phe-Pro-Val-thioester complex was digested with CNBr and after fractionation of the CNBr peptides subsequently by S. aureus V8 protease. The active site peptide bearing the radiolabeled tripeptide was isolated in pure form by a three-step reversed phase HPLC purification protocol as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Because the thioester bond is unstable at neutral and alkaline pH, all cleavage and purification steps had to be performed in acidic medium (Fig. 2).Figure 2Purification of an active site peptide of GS2 bearing the tripeptide intermediate d-Phe-Pro-Val by reversed phase HPLC. The GS2-d-Phe-Pro-Val-tripeptide complex was digested chemically and enzymatically as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” The labeled active site peptide was isolated in pure form by successive reversed phase HPLC steps. CNBr fragments were loaded onto a BioSil 304-10 column and separated with a linear gradient of acetonitrile from 0 to 70% in 150 min (A). The peptide fraction containing the labeled fragment was digested with endoproteinase GluC from S. aureus V8. The resulting fragments were loaded onto a BioSil 318-10 column and separated with a linear gradient of acetonitrile from 6 to 48% in 150 min (B). Fractions containing the radioactivity were rechromatographed on a μRPC SC 2.1/10 column using a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Smart System and fractionated in the same way as under A (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)By liquid phase sequencing of the purified radiolabeled active site peptides containing eitherl-[14C]phenylalanine orl-[14C]valine as tracer we obtained the following result. 1LF2GP3G4H5ΔS6L7R8A9XSEQUENCE I The sequence shown in the upper row corresponds to the active site peptide of the thiolation center of GS2 for valine, which can be discriminated from the other thioester binding sites of gramicidin S synthetase by its arginine in position 7 instead of a lysine. This site was previously characterized by affinity labeling and analysis of the isolated peptide fragment (5Stein T. Vater J. Kruft V. Otto A. Wittmann-Liebold B. Franke P. Panico M. McDowell R.

Krause M. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 529-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In previous experiments it has been demonstrated that this modification originates from an elimination reaction at the active site serine because of the alkaline conditions during Edman degradation (5Stein T.

Franke P. Panico Maria Mc Dowell R. Morris H.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Furthermore we would expect to find a methionine in position 9 of this peptide, which we could not detect. This is probably because of its conversion to the homoserine lactone during CNBr fragmentation.In the first two Edman degradation steps, in addition to L and G, F and P were detected, indicating that the FPV tripeptide was in fact attached to our active site peptide. Ifl-[14C]phenylalanine was used, the tracer quantitatively eluted in the first Edman degradation step. In the case of l-[14C]valine the radiolabel appeared in the third step. However, the degradation product was not identical with the phenylthiohydantoin derivative of valine. Presumably valine was linked to a 4′-PPan carrier via a thioester bond.To identify the mode of attachment of the phenylalanyl-prolyl-valine intermediate at the thiolation site of GS2 for l-valine, we investigated the isolated active site peptide by MALDI mass spectrometry (Fig. 3 A). In the linear mode we found an intensive signal atm/z = 1587.0 for the quasi-molecular ion [M+H]+ of this peptide containingl-[14C]valine as tracer. Its mass is consistent with the sum of the masses calculated (a) for the active site peptide comprising Leu-2037 to Met-2045 (m/z = 941.1) as derived from the gene sequence with a homoserine lactone instead of methionine in position 2045, (b) for a 4′-PPan cofactor (m/z = 340.3), and (c) for the tripeptide intermediate phenylalanyl-prolyl-valine (m/z = 352.4 withl-[14C]valine as the label). A second signal appeared at m/z = 876.4 that corresponds to the mass of a valine active site peptide of GS2 from which the 4′-PPan-tripeptide adduct was eliminated, converting the serine at position 2041 to a dehydroalanine.Figure 3Analysis of the active site peptide of GS2 bearing the tripeptide intermediate d-Phe-Pro-Val by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. A, the post source decay spectrum of this species shows the quasi-molecular ion [M+H]+ atm/z = 1587.0 together with the fragment ions. Representative signals were found atm/z = 974.1 and 875.9, which could be attributed to the phosphorylated and the dephosphorylated, dehydrated active site peptide.

Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 455-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The fragmentation pattern of the parent ion atm/z = 1587.0 comprised a few series of N- and C-terminal (A, B, C, X, Y, and Z ions) as well as histidine-directed internal sequence ions (A*, B*, and C* ions), resulting in the amino acid sequence shown in Fig. 3 B. The dominant fragments are found at m/z ratios of 974.1 and 875.9. They correspond to the mass values of the phosphorylated and the dephosphorylated, dehydrated form of the active site peptide, respectively, with a dehydroalanine in position 5. The mass at m/z = 893.8 can be assigned to the dephosphorylated form of the active site peptide with serine in position 5. Furthermore the mass at m/z = 120.6 was attributed to the immonium ions of phenylalanine. The B ion of the dipeptide phenylalanyl-proline was detected at anm/z ratio of 245.8. The mass atm/z = 612.9 can be assigned to the dephosphorylated Pan-valyl-prolyl-phenylalanine adduct.We also analyzed the fragment pattern of the ion atm/z = 876.4. It is remarkably similar to that of the parent ion at m/z = 1587.0 and yields the same amino acid sequence (Fig. 3).The results obtained by amino acid analysis agree well with our sequence data. The active site peptide contained 1 mol each of β-alanine and taurine, the latter being an oxidation product of cysteamine corroborating the presence of an attached 4′-PPan substituent.In conclusion, evidence was obtained by sequence analysis, MALDI mass spectrometry, and amino acid analysis that the tripeptided-Phe-Pro-Val in the biosynthesis of gramicidin S is attached to the 4′-phosphopantetheine cofactor of the thiotemplate site for l-valine. In this way we identified the binding site of a peptide synthetase for one of its peptide intermediates for the first time. Our results are in full agreement with the prediction of the multiple carrier model that the growing peptide chain in the elongation process is attached to the thiotemplate site of its C-terminal amino acid component. This work represents a fundamental contribution to the understanding of the mechanism of nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis. Multifunctional peptide synthetases like gramicidin S synthetase from Bacillus brevis ATCC 9999 catalyze the biosynthesis of their peptide products by a thiotemplate mechanism (1Lipmann F. Acc. Chem.

They activate their amino acid substrates in a two-step process involving aminoacyl adenylate formation and subsequent thioesterification at specific thiol groups (thiotemplates). Such multienzymes show a modular organization (6Kleinkauf H. von Döhren H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 335-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 7Marahiel M.A. Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D.

Their arrangement along the multifunctional polypeptide chain is usually colinear to the sequence of the amino acid components in the peptide product. Such modules can be subdivided into three main domains responsible (a) for amino acid recognition, binding, and the primary activation as aminoacyl adenylates, (b) for the thiolation of the amino acid substrates, and (c) for peptide elongation, in some cases in concert with amino acid epimerization. Recently we demonstrated by affinity labeling of gramicidin S synthetase at its thiolation centers and analysis of isolated active site peptides that each module of this multienzyme is equipped with its own 4′-phosphopantetheine (4′-PPan) 1The abbreviations used are: PPan, phosphopantetheine; GS1, phenylalanine racemase, EC 5.1.1.11(gramicidin S synthetase 1); GS2, gramicidin S synthetase 2; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization. 1The abbreviations used are: PPan, phosphopantetheine; GS1, phenylalanine racemase, EC 5.1.1.11(gramicidin S synthetase 1); GS2, gramicidin S synthetase 2; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization. cofactor (5Stein T.

The sulfhydryl group of the cofactors cysteamine component functions as the thiotemplate site for the specific amino acid substrate. Each of these mobile 4′-PPan carriers is connected in a phosphodiester linkage with a specific serine that is part of a strictly conserved consensus motif LGG(H/D)S(L/I). On the basis of these results we developed a multiple carrier model of nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis (5Stein T. Vater J. Kruft V. Otto A. Wittmann-Liebold B. Franke P. Panico M. McDowell R. Morris H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15426-15435Google Scholar). This new concept replaces the old version of the thiotemplate mechanism, which was proposed by several groups in the early seventies (1Lipmann F. Acc. Chem. Res. 1973; 6: 361-367Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 2Laland S.G. Zimmer T.-L. Essays Biochem. 1973; 9: 31-57PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kurahashi K. Annu. Rev.

The old model postulated a single central 4′-PPan carrier for peptide elongation that was assumed to interact during the elongation cycle with peripheral thiols charged with the amino acid substrates in thioester linkage. According to our new concept the growing peptide chain is assembled in a series of transpeptidation reactions by successive unidirectional interaction of the individual 4′-PPan carriers thioesterified with substrates or peptide intermediates. After transpeptidation the elongated peptide chain should be attached to the 4′-PPan cofactor specific for the binding of the C-terminal amino acid. This means that in the case of gramicidin S synthetase, for example, the di-, tri-, and tetrapeptide intermediate would be bound as thioesters to the 4′-PPan cofactor at the proline, valine, and ornithine reaction centers, respectively. Unfortunately, thed-Phe-Pro-dipeptide and thed-Phe-Pro-Val-Orn-tetrapeptide complexes of gramicidin S synthetase 2 (GS2) are unstable because of internal cyclization reactions (10von Döhren H.

In the case of [14C]phenylalanine as tracer free phenylalanine was detected in addition to the tripeptide, which was released from GS1 by hydrolysis. To investigate the binding site of the tripeptide intermediate to gramicidin S synthetase 2, the GS2-d-Phe-Pro-Val-thioester complex was digested with CNBr and after fractionation of the CNBr peptides subsequently by S. aureus V8 protease. The active site peptide bearing the radiolabeled tripeptide was isolated in pure form by a three-step reversed phase HPLC purification protocol as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Because the thioester bond is unstable at neutral and alkaline pH, all cleavage and purification steps had to be performed in acidic medium (Fig. 2). By liquid phase sequencing of the purified radiolabeled active site peptides containing eitherl-[14C]phenylalanine orl-[14C]valine as tracer we obtained the following result. 1LF2GP3G4H5ΔS6L7R8A9XSEQUENCE I The sequence shown in the upper row corresponds to the active site peptide of the thiolation center of GS2 for valine, which can be discriminated from the other thioester binding sites of gramicidin S synthetase by its arginine in position 7 instead of a lysine. This site was previously characterized by affinity labeling and analysis of the isolated peptide fragment (5Stein T. Vater J. Kruft V. Otto A. Wittmann-Liebold B. Franke P. Panico M. McDowell R. Morris H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15426-15435Google Scholar, 19Stein T. Vater J. Kruft V. Wittmann-Liebold B. Franke P. Panico Maria Mc Dowell R. Morris H.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) with the exception that in position 5 a dehydroalanine was found instead of a serine as derived from the gene sequence (21Turgay K. Krause M. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 529-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In previous experiments it has been demonstrated that this modification originates from an elimination reaction at the active site serine because of the alkaline conditions during Edman degradation (5Stein T. Vater J. Kruft V. Otto A. Wittmann-Liebold B. Franke P. Panico M. McDowell R. Morris H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15426-15435Google Scholar, 19Stein T. Vater J. Kruft V. Wittmann-Liebold B. Franke P. Panico Maria Mc Dowell R. Morris H.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Furthermore we would expect to find a methionine in position 9 of this peptide, which we could not detect. This is probably because of its conversion to the homoserine lactone during CNBr fragmentation. In the first two Edman degradation steps, in addition to L and G, F and P were detected, indicating that the FPV tripeptide was in fact attached to our active site peptide. Ifl-[14C]phenylalanine was used, the tracer quantitatively eluted in the first Edman degradation step. In the case of l-[14C]valine the radiolabel appeared in the third step. However, the degradation product was not identical with the phenylthiohydantoin derivative of valine. Presumably valine was linked to a 4′-PPan carrier via a thioester bond. To identify the mode of attachment of the phenylalanyl-prolyl-valine intermediate at the thiolation site of GS2 for l-valine, we investigated the isolated active site peptide by MALDI mass spectrometry (Fig. 3 A). In the linear mode we found an intensive signal atm/z = 1587.0 for the quasi-molecular ion [M+H]+ of this peptide containingl-[14C]valine as tracer. Its mass is consistent with the sum of the masses calculated (a) for the active site peptide comprising Leu-2037 to Met-2045 (m/z = 941.1) as derived from the gene sequence with a homoserine lactone instead of methionine in position 2045, (b) for a 4′-PPan cofactor (m/z = 340.3), and (c) for the tripeptide intermediate phenylalanyl-prolyl-valine (m/z = 352.4 withl-[14C]valine as the label). A second signal appeared at m/z = 876.4 that corresponds to the mass of a valine active site peptide of GS2 from which the 4′-PPan-tripeptide adduct was eliminated, converting the serine at position 2041 to a dehydroalanine. The structure of the active site peptide was determined by interpretation of the fragmentation data (Fig. 3) according to rules defined by Morris et al. (22Morris H.R. Panico M. Barber M. Bordoli R.S. Sedgwick R.D. Tyler A.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 101: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 23Morris H.R. Panico M. Karplus A. Lloyd P.E. Riniker B. Nature. 1982; 300: 643-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and Biemann (24Biemann K. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 455-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The fragmentation pattern of the parent ion atm/z = 1587.0 comprised a few series of N- and C-terminal (A, B, C, X, Y, and Z ions) as well as histidine-directed internal sequence ions (A*, B*, and C* ions), resulting in the amino acid sequence shown in Fig. 3 B. The dominant fragments are found at m/z ratios of 974.1 and 875.9. They correspond to the mass values of the phosphorylated and the dephosphorylated, dehydrated form of the active site peptide, respectively, with a dehydroalanine in position 5. The mass at m/z = 893.8 can be assigned to the dephosphorylated form of the active site peptide with serine in position 5. Furthermore the mass at m/z = 120.6 was attributed to the immonium ions of phenylalanine. The B ion of the dipeptide phenylalanyl-proline was detected at anm/z ratio of 245.8. The mass atm/z = 612.9 can be assigned to the dephosphorylated Pan-valyl-prolyl-phenylalanine adduct. We also analyzed the fragment pattern of the ion atm/z = 876.4. It is remarkably similar to that of the parent ion at m/z = 1587.0 and yields the same amino acid sequence (Fig. 3). The results obtained by amino acid analysis agree well with our sequence data. The active site peptide contained 1 mol each of β-alanine and taurine, the latter being an oxidation product of cysteamine corroborating the presence of an attached 4′-PPan substituent. In conclusion, evidence was obtained by sequence analysis, MALDI mass spectrometry, and amino acid analysis that the tripeptided-Phe-Pro-Val in the biosynthesis of gramicidin S is attached to the 4′-phosphopantetheine cofactor of the thiotemplate site for l-valine. In this way we identified the binding site of a peptide synthetase for one of its peptide intermediates for the first time. Our results are in full agreement with the prediction of the multiple carrier model that the growing peptide chain in the elongation process is attached to the thiotemplate site of its C-terminal amino acid component. This work represents a fundamental contribution to the understanding of the mechanism of nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis. We are indebted to Prof. R. M. Kamp, who made an amino acid analysis system available for our investigations. We thank G. Haeselbarth for peptide sequence analysis."

The system efficiently reconstitutes chromatin templates by associating DNA, core histones, and H1. The polynucleosomal complexes show physiological spacing of repeat length 190 ± 5 base pairs, and the internucleosomal distances are modulated by energy-using activities that contribute to the dynamics of chromatin conformation. The assembly extract was used to reconstitute tandemly repeated AluI-113 sequences. The establishment of preferred histone octamer/satellite DNA interactions was observed. In vitro, AluI-113 elements dictated the same nucleosome translational localizations as foundin vivo. Specific rotational constraints seem to be the central structural requirement for nucleosome association. Satellite dinucleosomes showed decreased translational mobility compared with mononucleosomes. This could be the consequence of interactions between rotationally positioned nucleosomes separated by linker DNA of uniform length. AluI-113 DNA led to weak cooperativity of nucleosome association in the proximal flanking regions, which decreased with distance. Moreover, the structural properties of satellite chromatin can spread, thus leading to a specific organization of adjacent nucleosomes.

Most higher eukaryotic DNA is folded into a dynamic nucleoprotein structure, which is subject to progressive and reversible modifications of its condensation state during transitions between interphasic and metaphasic chromatin. However, there are chromosomal regions that maintain cytological properties comparable with those of the metaphase chromosome throughout the cell cycle (1Heitz E. Jahrb. Wiss. Bot. 1928; 69: 726-818Google Scholar). Termed heterochromatin, these highly condensed regions consist of simple DNA sequences repeated in long tandem arrays and are typically localized around centromeres and telomeres (reviewed in Refs. 2Pardue M.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar and 3Lohe A.R. Hilliker A.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 746-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Heterochromatic regions are replicated late during S phase (4Lima de Faria A. Jaworska H. Nature. 1968; 217: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 5Holmquist G.P. Am. J. Hum.

Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). These regions can influence the expression of juxtaposed genes in a manner dependent on their distance from the point of juxtaposition, a phenomenon called “position effect variegation” (7Lewis E.B.

Position effect variegation is thought to take place either by compartmentalization within transcriptionally inactive nuclear regions or by virtue of the spread of the heterochromatic structure (reviewed in Refs. 10Locke J. Kotarski M.A. Tartof K.D. Genetics. 1988; 120: 181-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 11Orlando V. Paro R. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Paro R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Genetic and molecular studies have shown that the process of heterochromatinization involves the spread of particular chromatin structures in the cases of pericentric insertions of euchromatic genes in Drosophila (12Wallrath L.L. Elgin S.C.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1263-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), centromeric insertion of theura4 gene in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (13Allshire R.C. Javerzat J.P. Redhead N.J.

Science. 1994; 264: 1768-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Analysis of the silencing processes in the yeast mating type loci indicates a fundamental role for histones H3 and H4 in the stabilization of the repressed state of yeast telomeric heterochromatin (15Johnson L.M.

Nucleosome arrangement therefore appears to be an important structural element that allows specific silencing proteins to assemble packed, repressive chromatin structures.The study of the role of heterochromatic DNA on chromatin structure may help to clarify how specific heterochromatic structures are maintained. To this end, we reconstituted and characterized the chromatin features of chromosomal regions that are cytologically distinguishable asArtemia franciscana (Crustacea Phyllopoda) heterochromatin. These regions are mainly composed of satellite DNA with a repeat unit length of 113 bp 1The abbreviation used is: bp, base pair(s). 1The abbreviation used is: bp, base pair(s).(AluI-113).
