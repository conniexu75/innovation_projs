https://openalex.org/W2090614372,"Klebsiella pneumoniae is found in the environment and as a harmless commensal, but is also a frequent nosocomial pathogen (causing urinary, respiratory and blood infections) and the agent of specific human infections including Friedländer's pneumonia, rhinoscleroma and the emerging disease pyogenic liver abscess (PLA). The identification and precise definition of virulent clones, i.e. groups of strains with a single ancestor that are associated with particular infections, is critical to understand the evolution of pathogenicity from commensalism and for a better control of infections. We analyzed 235 K. pneumoniae isolates of diverse environmental and clinical origins by multilocus sequence typing, virulence gene content, biochemical and capsular profiling and virulence to mice. Phylogenetic analysis of housekeeping genes clearly defined clones that differ sharply by their clinical source and biological features. First, two clones comprising isolates of capsular type K1, clone CC23K1 and clone CC82K1, were strongly associated with PLA and respiratory infection, respectively. Second, only one of the two major disclosed K2 clones was highly virulent to mice. Third, strains associated with the human infections ozena and rhinoscleroma each corresponded to one monomorphic clone. Therefore, K. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae and K. pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis should be regarded as virulent clones derived from K. pneumoniae. The lack of strict association of virulent capsular types with clones was explained by horizontal transfer of the cps operon, responsible for the synthesis of the capsular polysaccharide. Finally, the reduction of metabolic versatility observed in clones Rhinoscleromatis, Ozaenae and CC82K1 indicates an evolutionary process of specialization to a pathogenic lifestyle. In contrast, clone CC23K1 remains metabolically versatile, suggesting recent acquisition of invasive potential. In conclusion, our results reveal the existence of important virulent clones associated with specific infections and provide an evolutionary framework for research into the links between clones, virulence and other genomic features in K. pneumoniae."
https://openalex.org/W2006350053,"Dendritic cell (DC) derived-exosomes (Dex) are nanomeric vesicles harboring functional MHC/peptide complexes promoting T cell-dependent tumor rejection. In the first Phase I trial using peptide-pulsed Dex, the observation of clinical regressions in the absence of T cell responses prompted the search for alternate effector mechanisms. Mouse studies unraveled the bioactivity of Dex on NK cells. Indeed, Dex promoted an IL-15Rα- and NKG2D-dependent NK cell proliferation and activation respectively, resulting in anti-metastatic effects mediated by NK1.1+ cells. In humans, Dex express functional IL-15Rα which allow proliferation and IFNγ secretion by NK cells. In contrast to immature DC, human Dex harbor NKG2D ligands on their surface leading to a direct engagement of NKG2D and NK cell activation ex vivo. In our phase I clinical trial, we highlight the capacity of Dex based-vaccines to restore the number and NKG2D-dependent function of NK cells in 7/14 patients. Altogether, these data provide a mechanistic explanation on how Dex may stimulate non MHC restricted-anti-tumor effectors and induce tumor regression in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1999636129,"Through negative regulation of gene expression, microRNAs (miRNAs) can function in cancers as oncosuppressors, and they can show altered expression in various tumor types. Here we have investigated medulloblastoma tumors (MBs), which arise from an early impairment of developmental processes in the cerebellum, where Notch signaling is involved in many cell-fate-determining stages. MBs occur bimodally, with the peak incidence seen between 3-4 years and 8-9 years of age, although it can also occur in adults. Notch regulates a subset of the MB cells that have stem-cell-like properties and can promote tumor growth. On the basis of this evidence, we hypothesized that miRNAs targeting the Notch pathway can regulated these phenomena, and can be used in anti-cancer therapies.In a screening of MB cell lines, the miRNA miR-199b-5p was seen to be a regulator of the Notch pathway through its targeting of the transcription factor HES1. Down-regulation of HES1 expression by miR-199b-5p negatively regulates the proliferation rate and anchorage-independent growth of MB cells. MiR-199b-5p over-expression blocks expression of several cancer stem-cell genes, impairs the engrafting potential of MB cells in the cerebellum of athymic/nude mice, and of particular interest, decreases the MB stem-cell-like (CD133+) subpopulation of cells. In our analysis of 61 patients with MB, the expression of miR-199b-5p in the non-metastatic cases was significantly higher than in the metastatic cases (P = 0.001). Correlation with survival for these patients with high levels of miR-199b expression showed a positive trend to better overall survival than for the low-expressing patients. These data showing the down-regulation of miR-199b-5p in metastatic MBs suggest a potential silencing mechanism through epigenetic or genetic alterations. Upon induction of de-methylation using 5-aza-deoxycytidine, lower miR-199b-5p expression was seen in a panel of MB cell lines, supported an epigenetic mechanism of regulation. Furthermore, two cell lines (Med8a and UW228) showed significant up-regulation of miR-199b-5p upon treatment. Infection with MB cells in an induced xenograft model in the mouse cerebellum and the use of an adenovirus carrying miR-199b-5p indicate a clinical benefit through this negative influence of miR-199b-5p on tumor growth and on the subset of MB stem-cell-like cells, providing further proof of concept.Despite advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of MB, one-third of these patients remain incurable and current treatments can significantly damage long-term survivors. Here we show that miR-199b-5p expression correlates with metastasis spread, identifying a new molecular marker for a poor-risk class in patients with MB. We further show that in a xenograft model, MB tumor burden can be reduced, indicating the use of miR199b-5p as an adjuvant therapy after surgery, in combination with radiation and chemotherapy, for the improvement of anti-cancer MB therapies and patient quality of life. To date, this is the first report that expression of a miRNA can deplete the tumor stem cells, indicating an interesting therapeutic approach for the targeting of these cells in brain tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1974706622,"Ubiquitin ligase Atrogin1/Muscle Atrophy F-box (MAFbx) up-regulation is required for skeletal muscle atrophy but substrates and function during the atrophic process are poorly known. The transcription factor MyoD controls myogenic stem cell function and differentiation, and seems necessary to maintain the differentiated phenotype of adult fast skeletal muscle fibres. We previously showed that MAFbx mediates MyoD proteolysis in vitro. Here we present evidence that MAFbx targets MyoD for degradation in several models of skeletal muscle atrophy. In cultured myotubes undergoing atrophy, MAFbx expression increases, leading to a cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of MAFbx and a selective suppression of MyoD. Conversely, transfection of myotubes with sh-RNA-mediated MAFbx gene silencing (shRNAi) inhibited MyoD proteolysis linked to atrophy. Furthermore, overexpression of a mutant MyoDK133R lacking MAFbx-mediated ubiquitination prevents atrophy of mouse primary myotubes and skeletal muscle fibres in vivo. Regarding the complex role of MyoD in adult skeletal muscle plasticity and homeostasis, its rapid suppression by MAFbx seems to be a major event leading to skeletal muscle wasting. Our results point out MyoD as the second MAFbx skeletal muscle target by which powerful therapies could be developed."
https://openalex.org/W2047884499,"Members of the FOXO (forkhead O) class of transcription factors are tumor suppressors that also control aging and organismal life span. Mammalian FOXO degradation is proteasome-mediated, although the ubiquitin E3 ligase for FOXO factors remains to be defined. We show that MDM2 binds to FOXO1 and FOXO3A and promotes their ubiquitination and degradation, a process apparently dependent on FOXO phosphorylation at AKT sites and the E3 ligase activity of MDM2. Binding of MDM2 to FOXO occurs through the region of MDM2 that directs its cellular trafficking and the forkhead box of FOXO1. MDM2 promotes the ubiquitination of FOXO1 in a cell-free system, and its knockdown by small interfering RNA causes accumulation of endogenous FOXO3A protein in cells and enhances the expression of FOXO target genes. In cells stably expressing a temperature-sensitive p53 mutant, activation of p53 by shifting to permissive temperatures leads to MDM2 induction and degradation of endogenous FOXO3A. These data suggest that MDM2 acts as an ubiquitin E3 ligase, downstream of p53, to regulate the degradation of mammalian FOXO factors.

MDM2 is an oncogene that is transcriptionally induced by the p53 tumor suppressor. In turn, MDM2 serves as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for p53, promoting its ubiquitination and degradation (30Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3722) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis shows that the lethality of MDM2 null mice is rescued by simultaneous deletion of the p53, suggesting that the p53 is the major substrate for MDM2 in normal mouse development (31Montes de Oca Luna R. Wagner D.S. Lozano G. Nature. 1995; 378: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). However, MDM2 has been reported to exert p53-independent functions in various cellular processes and to contribute to the transformed phenotype in the absence of wild type p53 (32Ganguli G. Wasylyk B. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 1027-1035PubMed Google Scholar). Consistently, MDM2 controls the ubiquitination and degradation of numerous proteins with essential roles in tumorigenesis (33Lin H.K. Wang L. Hu Y.C. Altuwaijri S. Chang C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4037-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report that MDM2 acts downstream of p53 as an E3 ligase for mammalian FOXO factors, which promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of FOXO1 and FOXO3A. The findings implicate a cross-talk between p53 and FOXO factors in regulating cellular responses to genotoxic stress and in tumorigenesis.

Transfections and Immunological Assays—For co-precipitation analyses, 1 × 106 cells were plated in 100-mm dishes in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. One day after plating, cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids by Lipofectamine Plus following the protocol from Invitrogen. Cellular extracts were prepared in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After preclearance by incubating with protein A-agarose for 1 h, followed by brief centrifugation, the extracts were incubated sequentially with 1–3 μg of antibody and protein G-agarose beads for 4 h at 4 °C. After four washes with the lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitates were eluted from the beads by boiling in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. For immunoblotting, cellular extracts or immunoprecipitates were separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, probed with the cognate antibody, and visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence with the ECL kit from Amersham Biosciences. For immunofluorescence analyses, H1299 cells, MEFs, or transfected cells on coverslips were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 16 h, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were permeabilized at room temperature for 30 min in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated in PBS containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1% bovine serum albumin, and primary antibody for 1 h. After washing three times in PBS, cells were incubated for 45 min with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated (red) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated (green) anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes), followed by three washes with PBS. The slides were dried and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium containing 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for nuclear staining. Regular fluorescent microscopic images were obtained with a Nikon Diaphot microscope and a Photometrix PXL cooled CCD camera. The microscope was equipped with filters for three-color imaging and a motorized stage for obtaining z-series images. Digital image files were processed and deconvolved using Oncor Image software (Oncor Inc.). High resolution images of the deconvolved and three-dimensional reconstructed image z-series stacks were processed for presentation with Adobe Photoshop. For confocal analyses, samples were viewed with a Leica DMI6000 inverted microscope with TCS SP5 confocal scanner and a ×100, numerical aperture 1.40 plan apochromat oil immersion objective (Leica Microsystems). 405-Diode and HeNe 594 laser lines were used for excitation and tunable filters to minimize interference between fluorochromes. Differential interference contrast imaging was performed using an argon laser line. Scale bars were created with the LAS AF software version 1.6.0 build 1016 (Leica Microsystems). Ni2+-Nitrilotriacetic Acid (NTA) Pull-down Assay—H1299 cells or MEFs were plated in 100-mm dishes and transfected with 4 μg of His6-ubiquitin plasmid, 4 μg of FOXO vectors, and 4 μg of MDM2 vectors using Lipofectamine Plus. 24 h posttransfection, cells were harvested and separated into two aliquots: one aliquot (10%) for immunoblotting of transfected proteins and the other (90%) for purification by Ni2+-NTA beads. Cell pellets were lysed in buffer containing 0.01 m Tris-Cl (pH 8), 6 m guanidinium HCl, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 5 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol and were incubated with Ni2+-NTA beads (Qiagen) overnight at room temperature. The beads were washed sequentially with the lysis buffer, a buffer containing 0.01 m Tris-Cl (pH 8), 8 m urea, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and a buffer containing 0.01 m Tris-Cl (pH 6.3), 8 m urea, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were eluted with a buffer containing 0.15 m Tris-Cl (pH 6.7), 5% SDS, 200 mm imidazole, 30% glycerol, 0.72 m β-mercaptoethanol and immunoblotted for ubiquitin-conjugated FOXO proteins. In Vitro Transcription-coupled Translations and Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Pull-down Assays—FOXO1 protein was produced with pcDNA3-FLAG-FOXO1 as a template using the T7 polymerase-based in vitro transcription-coupled translations (Promega, Madison, WI). GST-MDM2 plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli and cultured at 37 °C until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.6. Then 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added, and incubations were carried out for another 5 h at 30 °C. Bacterial cultures were lysed by sonication in buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. GST pull-down analyses were performed using the MagneGST pull-down system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the vendor's protocol. In Vitro Ubiquitination Assays—Full-length GST-MDM2 and GST-MDM2-NT-(1–150) were expressed in E. coli and bound to glutathione-agarose beads. The substrate FOXO1 was produced by in vitro transcription-coupled translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate using the TNT system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. 4 μg of GST fusion proteins and 8 μl of the FOXO1 in vitro translation product were incubated together to allow the enzyme-substrate interaction to occur. After three washes with PBS containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40, the bead-bound enzyme-substrate complex was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 250 ng of GST-Ubc5Hb (Boston Biochem), 250 ng of purified rabbit ubiquitin E1 (Boston Biochem), and 2 μg of His6-ubiquitin (Boston Biochem) in 20 μl of reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 15 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Triton X-100, 1% glycerol, 8 mm ATP. The reactions were terminated by boiling in SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried, and the ubiquitin-conjugated FOXO1 proteins were detected by autoradiography. Apoptotic Analyses and Flow Cytometry—The determination of the survival and apoptotic index of GFP-transfected cells has been described (42Li P. Nicosia S.V. Bai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20444-20450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In brief, transfected cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% formaldehyde, and stained with DAPI. Representative micrographs were captured by a charge-coupled device camera with a Smart Capture Program (Vysis, Downers Grove, IL) attached to a Leitz Orthoplan 2 fluorescence microscope. The viability of transfected cells in each well was determined by counting the total number of green cells in each well. The apoptotic index of GFP-positive cells was determined by scoring 300 GFP-positive cells for chromatin condensation and apoptotic body formation. To measure the apoptotic index induced by FOXO1, H1299 cells in 100-mm dishes were transfected with GFP and FOXO1 with or without MDM2. Transfected cells were collected in PBS containing 2.5 mm EDTA; washed twice with cold PBS; resuspended in 1× binding buffer containing 0.01 m Hepes (pH 7.4), 0.14 m NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2 at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml; and stained with Annexin-V allophycocyanin and 7-aminoactinomycin D. Cell sorting and flow cytometry analysis were performed on a FACScan (BD Biosciences). MDM2 Promotes the Degradation of FOXO Factors—While investigating the functional cross-talk between p53 and FOXO signaling pathways, we noticed an inverse correlation between the expression of FOXO3A and the p53 target gene MDM2 among a panel of human cancer cell lines, including osteosarcoma (Saos2), prostate (LNCaP, PC3, DU145, and JCA1), breast (MCF-7), cervical (HeLa), and lung (H1299, H1299/V138) cancer cells (Fig. 1A). To determine whether the inverse correlation among cancer cells reflects a negative effect of MDM2 on FOXO protein, the level of FOXO3A and FOXO1 protein expression in p53 null and p53/MDM2 double null MEFs was measured by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1B, knocking out MDM2 in MEFs increased the expression of endogenous FOXO1 and FOXO3A proteins. Consistent with the data from MEFs, the stable expression of MDM2 in H1299 cells reduced (Fig. 1C) whereas the knockdown of endogenous MDM2 increased (Fig. 1D) the expression of endogenous FOXO3A. Unlike MEFs, H1299/V138 cells express low levels of endogenous FOXO1, which are difficult to detect. Thus, we tested the effect of MDM2 silencing on the expression of ectopic FOXO1. As shown in Fig. 1E, the knockdown of MDM2 increased the level of ectopic FLAG-FOXO1 expression. Since MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that promotes the proteasome mediated degradation of p53 (43Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar) and of other proteins (33Lin H.K. Wang L. Hu Y.C. Altuwaijri S. Chang C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4037-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), it is likely that MDM2 decreases the expression of FOXO factors through a similar mechanism. In transient transfection studies, we found that co-expression of MDM2 reduced the expression of FLAG-FOXO1 in DU145 prostate cancer cells, a process that was prevented by co-treatment with proteasome inhibitor MG132 at two different concentrations (Fig. 1F). To test whether the decreased FOXO protein expression by MDM2 is due to protein degradation, the half-life of FLAG-FOXO1 was measured in H1299 cells cotransfected with control vector, full-length MDM2, or MDM2 mutant (residues 1–361) that lacks the C-terminal ring domain important for its E3 ligase activity. As shown in Fig. 1G, the half-life of FOXO1 was decreased by full-length MDM2 from 6 to 3 h relative to the control vector. Moreover, cotransfection with MDM2-(1–361) caused a significant increase in the half-life of the FLAG-FOXO1, possibly due to a dominant negative effect. Overall, these data raise the possibility that MDM2 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for mammalian FOXO factors. MDM2 Interacts with FOXO Factors in Vivo and in Vitro—Ubiquitin E3 ligases are known to make direct contact with their substrates. Therefore, we investigated whether MDM2 and FOXO factors form a complex in cells. Deconvolution imaging analyses detected ectopic MDM2 and FOXO1 proteins in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of p53 and MDM2 double null MEFs, but co-localization was detected predominantly in the nucleus (Fig. 2A). Similarly, confocal imaging gave the same result for endogenous MDM2 and FOXO3A in H1299 cells (Fig. 2B). To determine whether MDM2 and FOXO1 interact in mammalian cells, they were ectopically expressed in H1299 cells, and reciprocal co-immunoprecipitations were performed. As shown in Fig. 2C, MDM2 and FOXO1 were co-precipitated in cells that express both proteins. In cells that express either MDM2 or FOXO1, little or no co-precipitation occurred, showing that the co-precipitations were not due to cross-reactivity of the antibodies. Similar analysis showed that MDM2 and GFP-FOXO3A were specifically co-precipitated (Fig. 2D). To test further whether endogenous MDM2 and FOXO1 proteins in mammalian cells interact, H1299/V138 cells expressing a temperature-sensitive p53 mutant (34Pochampally R. Fodera B. Chen L. Lu W. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15271-15277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) were shifted to a permissive temperature for 16 h to induce MDM2 expression and treated with MG132. Cellular extracts were subjected to co-immunoprecipitations with anti-MDM2 antibody or anti-HA antibody as control. As shown in Fig. 2E, FOXO1 was precipitated by anti-MDM2 antibody but not by the control antibody, showing that the co-precipitations were not due to antibody cross-reactivity. MG132 treatment increased the level of MDM2 and FOXO expression as well as their co-precipitations. Similar co-precipitation analyses in HEK293T cells treated with MG132 showed that the FOXO3A protein was co-precipitated with MDM2 by anti-MDM2 but not anti-HA antibody and that treatment with MG132 increased the level of MDM2 and FOXO3A expression as well as their co-precipitations (Fig. 2F). These studies show that the co-precipitations occur with both endogenous and ectopically expressed proteins. To determine whether MDM2 and FOXO1 interact in vitro, GST and GST-MDM2 fusion proteins were produced in bacteria, bound to glutathione beads, and incubated with FOXO1 proteins produced by in vitro transcription-coupled translations. In these GST pull-down assays, wild type FOXO1 was precipitated with GST-MDM2 but not with GST (Fig. 2G). A mutant form of FOXO1, FOXO1 (AAA), in which all three AKT phosphorylation sites were mutated to alanine, was also precipitated with GST-MDM2 but not with GST (Fig. 2G). This experiment shows that FOXO1 and MDM2 form a complex in vitro, and the complex formation occurs independently of the phosphorylation of FOXO1 by AKT. The Interaction between MDM2 and FOXO1 Is Mediated by the Forkhead Box of FOXO1 and the Region of MDM2 That Controls Nuclear-Cytoplasmic Shuttling—To define the region in FOXO1 necessary for binding to MDM2, H1299 cells were transfected with MDM2 together with full-length FOXO1 or its deletion constructs fused to the HA tag (Fig. 3A), and cellular extracts were then co-immunoprecipitated with an anti-MDM2 antibody. As shown in Fig. 3B, the full-length FOXO1 protein was co-precipitated with MDM2. Deletion of the C-terminal region of FOXO1 did not alter the co-precipitations. However, further deletion into the forkhead box abolished the interaction, suggesting that the forkhead box is necessary for the interaction. Consistent with this interpretation, the expression of FOXO1 protein deleted of the forkhead box was no longer decreased by MDM2 (Fig. 3C). The FOXO(ΔFK) expressed at a much higher level than wild type, presumably due to increased protein stability. It remains to be determined whether the forkhead box alone is sufficient for the interaction, since in our cell system, the construct that contains only the forkhead box of FOXO1 did not express adequate amounts of the protein, presumably due to its instability. To define the MDM2 region responsible for FOXO1 binding, different MDM2 constructs (Fig. 4A) were transfected with FLAG-FOXO1 into H1299 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2024629474,"Angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) and angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) are secreted proteins that regulate triglyceride (TG) metabolism in part by inhibiting lipoprotein lipase (LPL). Recently, we showed that treatment of wild-type mice with monoclonal antibody (mAb) 14D12, specific for ANGPTL4, recapitulated the Angptl4 knock-out (-/-) mouse phenotype of reduced serum TG levels. In the present study, we mapped the region of mouse ANGPTL4 recognized by mAb 14D12 to amino acids Gln(29)-His(53), which we designate as specific epitope 1 (SE1). The 14D12 mAb prevented binding of ANGPTL4 with LPL, consistent with its ability to neutralize the LPL-inhibitory activity of ANGPTL4. Alignment of all angiopoietin family members revealed that a sequence similar to ANGPTL4 SE1 was present only in ANGPTL3, corresponding to amino acids Glu(32)-His(55). We produced a mouse mAb against this SE1-like region in ANGPTL3. This mAb, designated 5.50.3, inhibited the binding of ANGPTL3 to LPL and neutralized ANGPTL3-mediated inhibition of LPL activity in vitro. Treatment of wild-type as well as hyperlipidemic mice with mAb 5.50.3 resulted in reduced serum TG levels, recapitulating the lipid phenotype found in Angptl3(-/-) mice. These results show that the SE1 region of ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 functions as a domain important for binding LPL and inhibiting its activity in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, these results demonstrate that therapeutic antibodies that neutralize ANGPTL4 and ANGPTL3 may be useful for treatment of some forms of hyperlipidemia."
https://openalex.org/W2051787267,"Background Actin stress fibers (SFs) are mechanosensitive structural elements that respond to forces to affect cell morphology, migration, signal transduction and cell function. Cells are internally stressed so that SFs are extended beyond their unloaded lengths, and SFs tend to self-adjust to an equilibrium level of extension. While there is much evidence that cells reorganize their SFs in response to matrix deformations, it is unclear how cells and their SFs determine their specific response to particular spatiotemporal changes in the matrix. Methodology/Principal Findings Bovine aortic endothelial cells were subjected to cyclic uniaxial stretch over a range of frequencies to quantify the rate and extent of stress fiber alignment. At a frequency of 1 Hz, SFs predominantly oriented perpendicular to stretch, while at 0.1 Hz the extent of SF alignment was markedly reduced and at 0.01 Hz there was no alignment at all. The results were interpreted using a simple kinematic model of SF networks in which the dynamic response depended on the rates of matrix stretching, SF turnover, and SF self-adjustment of extension. For these cells, the model predicted a threshold frequency of 0.01 Hz below which SFs no longer respond to matrix stretch, and a saturation frequency of 1 Hz above which no additional SF alignment would occur. The model also accurately described the dependence of SF alignment on matrix stretch magnitude. Conclusions The dynamic stochastic model was capable of describing SF reorganization in response to diverse temporal and spatial patterns of stretch. The model predicted that at high frequencies, SFs preferentially disassembled in the direction of stretch and achieved a new equilibrium by accumulating in the direction of lowest stretch. At low stretch frequencies, SFs self-adjusted to dissipate the effects of matrix stretch. Thus, SF turnover and self-adjustment are each important mechanisms that cells use to maintain mechanical homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2052847951,"Background Huntington's disease (HD) is a severe inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterized, in addition to neurological impairment, by weight loss suggesting endocrine disturbances. The aims of this study were to look for neuroendocrine disturbances in patients with Huntington's disease (HD) and to determine the relationship with weight loss seen in HD Methods and Finding We compared plasma levels of hormones from the five pituitary axes in 219 patients with genetically documented HD and in 71 sex- and age-matched controls. Relationships between hormone levels and disease severity, including weight-loss severity, were evaluated. Growth hormone (GH) and standard deviation score of insulin-like growth factor 1 (SDS IGF-1) were significantly higher in patients than in controls (0.25 (0.01–5.89) vs. 0.15 (0.005–4.89) ng/ml, p = 0.013 and 0.16±1.02 vs. 0.06±0.91, p = 0.039; respectively). Cortisol was higher (p = 0.002) in patients (399.14±160.5 nmol/L vs. 279.8±130.1 nmol/L), whereas no differences were found for other hormone axes. In patients, elevations in GH and IGF-1 and decreases in thyroid-stimulating hormone, free triiodothyronine and testosterone (in men) were associated with severity of impairments (Independence scale, Functional score, Total Functional Capacity, Total Motor score, Behavioral score). Only GH was independently associated with body mass index (β = −0.26, p = 0.001). Conclusion Our data suggest that the thyrotropic and in men gonadotropic axes are altered in HD according to the severity of the disease. The somatotropic axis is overactive even in patients with early disease, and could be related to the weight loss seen in HD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2049027654,"Gram-negative bacterial endotoxin (i.e. lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) is one of the most potent stimulants of the innate immune system, recognized by the TLR4.MD-2 complex. Direct binding to MD-2 of LPS and LPS analogues that act as TLR4 agonists or antagonists is well established, but the role of MD-2 and TLR4 in receptor activation is much less clear. We have identified residues within the hairpin of MD-2 between strands five and six that, although not contacting acyl chains of tetraacylated lipid IVa (a TLR4 antagonist), influence activation of TLR4 by hexaacylated lipid A. We show that hydrophobic residues at positions 82, 85, and 87 of MD-2 are essential both for transfer of endotoxin from CD14 to monomeric MD-2 and for TLR4 activation. We also identified a pair of conserved hydrophobic residues (Phe-440 and Phe-463) in leucine-rich repeats 16 and 17 of the TLR4 ectodomain, which are essential for activation of TLR4 by LPS. F440A or F463A mutants of TLR4 were inactive, whereas the F440W mutant retained full activity. Charge reversal of neighboring cationic groups in the TLR4 ectodomain (Lys-388 and Lys-435), in contrast, did not affect cell activation. Our mutagenesis studies are consistent with a molecular model in which Val-82, Met-85, and Leu-87 in MD-2 and distal portions of a secondary acyl chain of hexaacylated lipid A that do not fit into the hydrophobic binding pocket of MD-2 form a hydrophobic surface that interacts with Phe-440 and Phe-463 on a neighboring TLR4.MD-2.LPS complex, driving TLR4 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2088464857,"The present study was undertaken to examine multifaceted therapeutic effects of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in a rat spinal cord injury (SCI) model, focusing on its capability to stimulate proliferation of endogenous glial progenitor cells. Neural stem cells (NSCs) can be genetically modified to efficiently transfer therapeutic genes to diseased CNS. We adopted an ex vivo approach using immortalized human NSC line (F3 cells) to achieve stable and robust expression of VEGF in the injured spinal cord. Transplantation of NSCs retrovirally transduced to overexpress VEGF (F3.VEGF cells) at 7 days after contusive SCI markedly elevated the amount of VEGF in the injured spinal cord tissue compared to injection of PBS or F3 cells without VEGF. Concomitantly, phosphorylation of VEGF receptor flk-1 increased in F3.VEGF group. Stereological counting of BrdU+ cells revealed that transplantation of F3.VEGF significantly enhanced cellular proliferation at 2 weeks after SCI. The number of proliferating NG2+ glial progenitor cells (NG2+/BrdU+) was also increased by F3.VEGF. Furthermore, transplantation of F3.VEGF increased the number of early proliferating cells that differentiated into mature oligodendrocytes, but not astrocytes, at 6 weeks after SCI. F3.VEGF treatment also increased the density of blood vessels in the injured spinal cord and enhanced tissue sparing. These anatomical results were accompanied by improved BBB locomotor scores. The multifaceted effects of VEGF on endogenous gliogenesis, angiogenesis, and tissue sparing could be utilized to improve functional outcomes following SCI."
https://openalex.org/W2133475014,"A recent study found that false memories were reduced by 36% when low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was applied to the left anterior temporal lobe after the encoding (study) phase. Here we were interested in the consequences on a false memory task of brain stimulation throughout the encoding and retrieval task phases. We used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) because it has been shown to be a useful tool to enhance cognition. Specifically, we examined whether tDCS can induce changes in a task assessing false memories. Based on our preliminary results, three conditions of stimulation were chosen: anodal left/cathodal right anterior temporal lobe (ATL) stimulation (""bilateral stimulation""); anodal left ATL stimulation (with a large contralateral cathodal electrode--referred as ""unilateral stimulation"") and sham stimulation. Our results showed that false memories were reduced significantly after the two active conditions (unilateral and bilateral stimulation) as compared with sham stimulation. There were no significant changes in veridical memories. Our findings show that false memories are reduced by 73% when anodal tDCS is applied to the anterior temporal lobes throughout the encoding and retrieval stages, suggesting a possible strategy for improving certain aspects of learning."
https://openalex.org/W2142965311,"Background Financial advice from experts is commonly sought during times of uncertainty. While the field of neuroeconomics has made considerable progress in understanding the neurobiological basis of risky decision-making, the neural mechanisms through which external information, such as advice, is integrated during decision-making are poorly understood. In the current experiment, we investigated the neurobiological basis of the influence of expert advice on financial decisions under risk. Methodology/Principal Findings While undergoing fMRI scanning, participants made a series of financial choices between a certain payment and a lottery. Choices were made in two conditions: 1) advice from a financial expert about which choice to make was displayed (MES condition); and 2) no advice was displayed (NOM condition). Behavioral results showed a significant effect of expert advice. Specifically, probability weighting functions changed in the direction of the expert's advice. This was paralleled by neural activation patterns. Brain activations showing significant correlations with valuation (parametric modulation by value of lottery/sure win) were obtained in the absence of the expert's advice (NOM) in intraparietal sulcus, posterior cingulate cortex, cuneus, precuneus, inferior frontal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus. Notably, no significant correlations with value were obtained in the presence of advice (MES). These findings were corroborated by region of interest analyses. Neural equivalents of probability weighting functions showed significant flattening in the MES compared to the NOM condition in regions associated with probability weighting, including anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral PFC, thalamus, medial occipital gyrus and anterior insula. Finally, during the MES condition, significant activations in temporoparietal junction and medial PFC were obtained. Conclusions/Significance These results support the hypothesis that one effect of expert advice is to “offload” the calculation of value of decision options from the individual's brain."
https://openalex.org/W2063426382,"The V-ATPase d2 protein constitutes an important subunit of the V-ATPase proton pump, which regulates bone homeostasis; however, currently little is known about its transcriptional regulation. Here, in an attempt to understand regulation of the V-ATPase d2 promoter, we identified the presence of NFATc1, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF)- and myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2)-binding sites within the V-ATPase d2 promoter using complementary bioinformatic analyses, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and electromobility shift assay. Intriguingly, activation of the V-ATPase d2 promoter by NFATc1 was enhanced by either MEF2 or MITF overexpression. By comparison, coexpression of MITF and MEF2 did not further enhance V-ATPase d2 promoter activity above that of expression of MITF alone. Consistent with a role in transcriptional regulation, both NFATc1 and MITF proteins translocated from the cytosol to the nucleus during RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis, whereas MEF2 persisted in the nucleus of both osteoclasts and their mononuclear precursors. Targeted mutation of the putative NFATc1-, MITF-, or MEF2-binding sites in the V-ATPase d2 promoter impaired its transcriptional activation. Additionally retroviral overexpression of MITF or MEF2 in RAW264.7 cells potentiated RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and V-ATPase d2 gene expression. Based on these data, we propose that MEF2 and MITF function cooperatively with NFATc1 to transactivate the V-ATPase d2 promoter during RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1971798751,"Background The prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3/DD3) gene is a highly specific biomarker upregulated in prostate cancer (PCa). In order to understand the importance of PCA3 in PCa we investigated the organization and evolution of the PCA3 gene locus. Methods/Principal Findings We have employed cDNA synthesis, RTPCR and DNA sequencing to identify 4 new transcription start sites, 4 polyadenylation sites and 2 new differentially spliced exons in an extended form of PCA3. Primers designed from these novel PCA3 exons greatly improve RT-PCR based discrimination between PCa, PCa metastases and BPH specimens. Comparative genomic analyses demonstrated that PCA3 has only recently evolved in an anti-sense orientation within a second gene, BMCC1/PRUNE2. BMCC1 has been shown previously to interact with RhoA and RhoC, determinants of cellular transformation and metastasis, respectively. Using RT-PCR we demonstrated that the longer BMCC1-1 isoform - like PCA3 – is upregulated in PCa tissues and metastases and in PCa cell lines. Furthermore PCA3 and BMCC1-1 levels are responsive to dihydrotestosterone treatment. Conclusions/Significance Upregulation of two new PCA3 isoforms in PCa tissues improves discrimination between PCa and BPH. The functional relevance of this specificity is now of particular interest given PCA3's overlapping association with a second gene BMCC1, a regulator of Rho signalling. Upregulation of PCA3 and BMCC1 in PCa has potential for improved diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2004447705,"Background Extravagant ornaments used as social signals evolved to advertise their bearers' quality. The Immunocompetence Handicap Hypothesis proposes that testosterone-dependent ornaments reliably signal health and parasite resistance; however, empirical studies have shown mixed support. Alternatively, immune function and parasite resistance may be indirectly or directly related to glucocorticoid stress hormones. We propose that an understanding of the interplay between the individual and its environment, particularly how they cope with stressors, is crucial for understanding the honesty of social signals. Methodology/Principal Findings We analyzed corticosterone deposited in growing feathers as an integrated measure of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity in a wild territorial bird, the red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus. We manipulated two key, interrelated components, parasites and testosterone, which influence both ornamentation and fitness. Birds were initially purged of parasites, and later challenged with parasites or not, while at the same time being given testosterone or control implants, using a factorial experimental design. At the treatment level, testosterone enhanced ornamentation, while parasites reduced it, but only in males not implanted with testosterone. Among individuals, the degree to which both parasites and testosterone had an effect was strongly dependent on the amount of corticosterone in the feather grown during the experiment. The more stressors birds had experienced (i.e., higher corticosterone), the more parasites developed, and the less testosterone enhanced ornamentation. Conclusions/Significance With this unique focus on the individual, and a novel, integrative, measure of response to stressors, we show that ornamentation is ultimately a product of the cumulative physiological response to environmental challenges. These findings lead toward a more realistic concept of honesty in signaling as well as a broader discussion of the concept of stress."

Accordingly, we investigated cardiac and blood glutathione levels in patients of different functional classes and with different structural heart diseases.Glutathione was measured using standard enzymatic recycling method in venous blood samples obtained from 91 individuals, including 15 healthy volunteers and 76 patients of New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I to IV, undergoing cardiac surgery for coronary artery disease, aortic stenosis or terminal cardiomyopathy. Glutathione was also quantified in right atrial appendages obtained at the time of surgery.In atrial tissue, glutathione was severely depleted (-58%) in NYHA class IV patients compared to NYHA class I patients (P = 0.002). In patients with coronary artery disease, this depletion was related to the severity of left ventricular dysfunction (P = 0.006). Compared to healthy controls, blood glutathione was decreased by 21% in NYHA class I patients with structural cardiac disease (P<0.01), and by 40% in symptomatic patients of NYHA class II to IV (P<0.0001). According to the functional NYHA class, significant depletion in blood glutathione occurred before detectable elevation in blood sTNFR1, a marker of symptomatic heart failure severity, as shown by the exponential relationship between these two parameters in the whole cohort of patients (r = 0.88).This study provides evidence that cardiac and systemic glutathione deficiency is related to the functional status and structural cardiac abnormalities of patients with cardiac diseases. These data also suggest that blood glutathione test may be an interesting new biomarker to detect asymptomatic patients with structural cardiac abnormalities."
https://openalex.org/W2065240196,"Mutation of CCM2 predisposes individuals to cerebral cavernous malformations, vascular abnormalities that cause seizures and hemorrhagic stroke. CCM2 has been proposed to regulate the activity of RhoA for maintenance of vascular integrity. Herein, we define a novel mechanism where the CCM2 phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain binds the ubiquitin ligase (E3) Smurf1, controlling RhoA degradation. Brain endothelial cells with knockdown of CCM2 have increased RhoA protein and display impaired directed cell migration. CCM2 binding of Smurf1 increases Smurf1-mediated degradation of RhoA. CCM2 does not significantly alter the catalytic activity of Smurf1, nor is CCM2 a Smurf1 substrate. Rather the CCM2-Smurf1 interaction functions to localize Smurf1 for RhoA degradation. These findings provide a molecular mechanism for the pathogenesis of cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) resulting from loss of CCM2-mediated localization of Smurf1, which controls RhoA degradation required for maintenance of normal endothelial cell physiology."
https://openalex.org/W1983160228,"Background Adiponectin is an adipokine possessing beneficial effects on obesity-related medical complications. A negative association of adiponectin levels with breast cancer development has been demonstrated. However, the precise role of adiponectin deficiency in mammary carcinogenesis remains elusive. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study, MMTV-polyomavirus middle T antigen (MMTV-PyVT) transgenic mice with reduced adiponectin expressions were established and the stromal effects of adiponectin haploinsufficiency on mammary tumor development evaluated. In mice from both FVB/N and C57BL/6J backgrounds, insufficient adiponectin production promoted mammary tumor onset and development. A distinctive basal-like subtype of tumors, with a more aggressive phenotype, was derived from adiponectin haplodeficient MMTV-PyVT mice. Comparing with those from control MMTV-PyVT mice, the isolated mammary tumor cells showed enhanced tumor progression in re-implanted nude mice, accelerated proliferation in primary cultures, and hyperactivated phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/beta-catenin signaling, which at least partly attributed to the decreased phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) activities. Further analysis revealed that PTEN was inactivated by a redox-regulated mechanism. Increased association of PTEN-thioredoxin complexes was detected in tumors derived from mice with reduced adiponectin levels. The activities of thioredoxin (Trx1) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR1) were significantly elevated, whereas treatment with either curcumin, an irreversible inhibitor of TrxR1, or adiponectin largely attenuated their activities and resulted in the re-activation of PTEN in these tumor cells. Moreover, adiponectin could inhibit TrxR1 promoter-mediated transcription and restore the mRNA expressions of TrxR1. Conclusion Adiponectin haploinsufficiency facilitated mammary tumorigenesis by down-regulation of PTEN activity and activation of PI3K/Akt signalling pathway through a mechanism involving Trx1/TrxR1 redox regulations."
https://openalex.org/W2093397595,"Inflamed cystic fibrosis (CF) human bronchial epithelia (HBE), or normal HBE exposed to supernatant from mucopurulent material (SMM) from CF airways, exhibit endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Ca2+ store expansion and amplified Ca2+-mediated inflammation. HBE inflammation triggers an unfolded protein response (UPR) coupled to mRNA splicing of X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1). Because spliced XBP-1 (XBP-1s) promotes ER expansion in other cellular models, we hypothesized that XBP-1s is responsible for the ER/Ca2+ store expansion in inflamed HBE. XBP-1s was increased in freshly isolated infected/inflamed CF in comparison with normal HBE. The link between airway epithelial inflammation, XBP-1s, and ER/Ca2+ store expansion was then addressed in murine airways challenged with phosphate-buffered saline or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa-challenged mice exhibited airway epithelial ER/Ca2+ store expansion, which correlated with airway inflammation. P. aeruginosa-induced airway inflammation triggered XBP-1s in ER stress-activated indicator (ERAI) mice. To evaluate the functional role of XBP-1s in airway inflammation linked to ER/Ca2+ store expansion, control, XBP-1s, or dominant negative XBP-1 (DN-XBP-1) stably expressing 16HBE14o- cell lines were used. Studies with cells transfected with an unfolded protein response element (UPRE) luciferase reporter plasmid confirmed that the UPRE was activated or inhibited by expression of XBP-1s or DN-XBP-1, respectively. Expression of XBP-1s induced ER/Ca2+ store expansion and potentiated bradykinin-increased interleukin (IL)-8 secretion, whereas expression of DN-XBP-1 inhibited bradykinin-dependent IL-8 secretion. In addition, expression of DN-XBP-1 blunted SMM-induced ER/Ca2+ store expansion and SMM-induced IL-8 secretion. These findings suggest that, in inflamed HBE, XBP-1s is responsible for the ER/Ca2+ store expansion that confers amplification of Ca2+-dependent inflammatory responses.

The altered airway environment resulting from infection and inflammation can, in turn, impact on the innate defense responses of the epithelia lining the airways. In accord with this notion, we have reported that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and its Ca2+ stores are expanded in native CF human airway epithelia. The ER expansion can be recapitulated in normal human bronchial epithelia (HBE) by exposing the cells to supernatant from mucopurulent material (SMM) from human CF airways (1Ribeiro C.M.P.

The up-regulation of the ER Ca2+ stores is functionally relevant, because it provides a mechanism for amplification of intracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+i)-dependent secretion of inflammatory mediators in inflamed HBE (2Ribeiro C.M.P.

These previous studies illustrated that the ER Ca2+ stores expand when the demand to up-regulate the innate response is imposed upon the secretory pathway. However, the mechanism responsible for the ER Ca2+ storage expansion in inflamed airway epithelial cells remains elusive. Because total protein synthesis is increased in inflamed HBE (2Ribeiro C.M.P.

Eukaryotic cells exhibit three major UPR pathways, namely 1) inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), 2) activating transcription factor 6, and 3) PKR-like ER kinase/pancreatic eIF2α kinase. The present studies focused on the IRE1 branch of the UPR (for a recent review of UPR pathways, see Ref. 10Ron D. Walter P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4851) Google Scholar). IRE1 is a transmembrane ER stress sensor, which exists in two isoforms, α and β. Activation of IRE1 by ER stress due to increases in unfolded proteins results in dissociation of the lumenal ER chaperone immunoglobulin-binding protein (BIP/GRP78) from a BIP/IRE1 complex (10Ron D. Walter P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4851) Google Scholar) to facilitate the folding of the newly synthesized proteins. Dissociation of BIP from the lumenal domain of IRE1 results in IRE1 dimerization, transautophosphorylation, and activation of its C-terminal endoribonuclease activity (5Patil C. Walter P. Curr. Opin.

The IRE1 endoribonuclease activity splices the leucine zipper transcription factor X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1) mRNA via removal of a 26-nucleotide intron (11Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A.

Data from several laboratories provide compelling evidence that activation of the UPR pathway mediated by XBP-1s couples to ER expansion. Studies with B lymphocytes and plasma cell differentiation have established a link between increased protein synthesis, UPR activation, and ER expansion. Differentiated plasma cells are programmed to secrete large quantities of immunoglobulins, a function accomplished by the acquisition of a highly developed ER, the development of which is dependent upon XBP-1 mRNA splicing (14Wiest D.L.

Studies demonstrating a direct link between XBP-1s, phospholipid biosynthesis, and ER expansion further supported a functional role for this UPR pathway regarding ER proliferation (17Shaffer A.L. Shapiro-Shelef M. Iwakoshi N.N. Lee A.H. Qian S.B. Zhao H. Yu X. Yang L. Tan B.K. Rosenwald A. Hurt E.M. Petroulakis E. Sonenberg N. Yewdell J.W. Calame K. Glimcher L.H. Staudt L.M.

In these studies, overexpression of XBP-1s was sufficient to increase cellular phospholipids and expand the ER compartment. Finally, deletion of XBP-1 in mouse models revealed its functional role in secretory organs such as the embryonic liver, pancreas, and salivary glands (20Lee A.H. Chu G.C. Iwakoshi N.N. Glimcher L.H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4368-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The role of XBP-1s in coordinating structural and functional features characteristic of secretory cells is likely relevant for inflammatory responses of airway epithelia. We have previously shown, utilizing the SMM model, that inflammation-triggered ER Ca2+ store expansion correlated with a 2.5-fold induction of the mRNA levels of XBP-1s in HBE (2Ribeiro C.M.P.

Based on these previous observations and the studies aforementioned, we hypothesized that inflammation-induced XBP-1s is the mechanism for the ER Ca2+ store expansion responsible for the amplification of Ca2+i-dependent inflammatory responses in inflamed HBE. The present studies utilized overexpression of XBP-1s or a dominant negative XBP-1 to evaluate the functional role of XBP-1s in airway epithelial inflammation coupled to ER Ca2+ store expansion. The relevance of XBP-1s in airway inflammation was further investigated in native airway epithelia from ER stress-activated indicator (ERAI) mice exposed to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and freshly isolated normal versus CF human bronchial epithelia. Our findings are consistent with a functional role for XBP-1s in airway inflammatory responses. Human bronchial airway epithelial cells were obtained under the auspices of protocols approved by the Institutional Committee on the Protection of the Rights of Human Subjects. Bronchial epithelial cells were isolated from main stem or lobar bronchi from 3 normal and 3 CF human lungs as previously described (1Ribeiro C.M.P. Paradiso A.M. Carew M.A. Shears S.B. Boucher R.C.

All mouse studies were performed according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of North Carolina. P. aeruginosa strain PAK was grown as previously described (21Smith R.S. Wolfgang M.C. Lory S. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 1677-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and used in the acute challenge studies. 5–6-Week-old wild type (C57BL/6 strain) or ERAI mice (RIKEN, Japan) were anesthetized and intratracheally instilled with 40 μl of P. aeruginosa suspension (2.5 × 107 colony forming units/ml for 1 × 106 colony forming units/40 μl; A600 = 0.060) or sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as control as previously reported (22Mall M. Grubb B.R. Harkema J.R. O'Neal W.K. Boucher R.C. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). At 24 h post-exposure, the animals were euthanized and histological specimens obtained by gently perfusing the lungs with 10% neutral-buffered formalin via tracheal cannulation, and embedding the fixed tissue in paraffin. Sections were obtained for hematoxylin and eosin stain, immunofluorescence assessment of calreticulin, and Venus fluorescence. Immunofluorescence of calreticulin was performed in lung sections from 5–6-week-old wild type mice (C57BL/6 strain) utilizing a primary rabbit anti-calreticulin antibody (Affinity Bioreagents) and a secondary goat anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Calreticulin fluorescence was assessed with a Leica 4D inverted laser scanning confocal microscope according to our method (1Ribeiro C.M.P. Paradiso A.M. Carew M.A. Shears S.B. Boucher R.C. J. Biol.

Frozen sections (10 μm thick) were obtained and differential interference contrast images and Venus fluorescence assessed with a Nikon TE2000 inverted fluorescent/differential interference contrast/phase microscope with dual cameras and rapidly switchable excitation and emission filters. The airway epithelial Venus fluorescence intensity was quantified with the Metamorph software and expressed per surface epithelial area. Wild type 16HBE14o- cells and 16HBE14o- cells stably expressing retroviral vectors were grown according to standard procedures and plated on 12-mm Transwell permeable supports (500,000 cells/well) for interleukin (IL)-8 secretion and ER Ca2+ store expansion studies. At this density, cultures become confluent, achieve air-liquid interface, and polarize within 24 h. For the retroviral expressing cell lines, cultures were maintained in antibiotic-selecting media (Geneticin® G418; Invitrogen). 50 μg of the control, pQCXIN retroviral vector (Clontech), or the pQCXIN retroviral vector containing XBP-1s (gi: 18148381) or a previously described DN-XBP-1 (23Lee A.H.

Mewshaw J.P. Ni H. Friedmann T. Boucher R.C. Olsen J.C. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8861-8872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 16HBE14o- cells were infected with retroviruses in the presence of Polybrene and positive cells were selected with neomycin G418 (Invitrogen). Mucopurulent material was harvested from the lumens of excised human CF lungs infected with P. aeruginosa at the North Carolina Cystic Fibrosis Center as previously described (1Ribeiro C.M.P.

SMM from several patients was pooled to assure homogeneous stimulus throughout the experiments. 30 μl of SMM or PBS (a control for SMM) were applied to the mucosal surface of the wild type and each stably expressing 16HBE14o- cell line to induce ER Ca2+ store expansion and an inflammatory response. Serosal media were collected following exposure of polarized 16HBE14o- cultures to either mucosal PBS or SMM or mucosal exposure to PBS or 5 μm bradykinin (BK). IL-8 was measured by ELISA (R&D Systems) in duplicate as previously reported (2Ribeiro C.M.P. Paradiso A.M. Schwab U. Perez-Vilar J. Jones L. O'Neal W. Boucher R.C. J. Biol.

Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy (Qiagen kit) and 200 ng of RNA was reverse transcribed using SuperScript II RNase H+ (Invitrogen) using 250 ng of random primers. PCR primers (forward: GGA GTT AGG ACA GCG CTT GG; reverse: GGA AGG GCA TTT GAA GAA CA) were designed to amplify a 270-base pair (bp) region of XBP-1 (NM_005080) and PCR products were column purified using a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) and digested with PstI. PstI-digested products were run in a 2% agarose gel, transferred, and cross-linked to a membrane and probed (Megaprime DNA labeling kit from Amersham Biosciences with the 270-bp PCR product from PBS-treated samples). Data were quantified with a Storm phosphorimaging system (GE Healthcare). 16HBE14o- cells stably expressing XBP-1s, DN-XBP-1, or control vector were transfected with a previously described reporter plasmid containing a luciferase reporter UPR element (UPRE-luciferase; a gift from Dr. Laurie Glimcher, Harvard University) (23Lee A.H.

Cells were challenged with vehicle or 5 μg/ml tunicamycin (a pharmacological ER stress inducer) at 48 h and luciferase activity was assayed 24 h later. Morphological—ER density, studied by confocal immunofluorescence analyses of calreticulin expression in 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed polarized 16HBE14o- cultures and quantification of the calreticulin fluorescence intensity were performed as previously reported (1Ribeiro C.M.P.

To visualize the nuclei, cultures were also stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Functional—Polarized 16HBE14o- cultures were luminally exposed for 48 h to 30 μl of mucosal PBS or SMM. Cultures were subsequently loaded with fura-2/AM and 100 μm mucosal UTP-dependent ER-derived Ca2+i mobilization was measured by microfluorimetry as we have previously described (1Ribeiro C.M.P.

ER-derived Ca2+i signals were quantified by subtracting the peak value from the UTP-dependent Ca2+i response (in the presence of nominally Ca2+ free conditions) from the baseline Ca2+i value prior to UTP. The resulting value represents an index of agonist-dependent ER Ca2+ release as previously reported (1Ribeiro C.M.P. Paradiso A.M. Carew M.A. Shears S.B. Boucher R.C. J. Biol.

Protein-disulfide Isomerase (PDI) Western Blotting—Polarized 16HBE14o- cultures expressing control, XBP-1s, or DN-XBP-1 vectors were luminally exposed for 48 h to 30 μl of mucosal PBS or SMM. Cultures were lysed, subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were blotted to nitrocellulose membranes as previously reported (1Ribeiro C.M.P. Paradiso A.M. Carew M.A. Shears S.B. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10202-10209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). PDI was probed with a mouse anti-PDI monoclonal antibody (1:1,000 dilution; Stressgen) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection. The PDI signal was quantified with the Metamorph software. Southern blots are representative of 3 individual normal and 3 CF human donors (for native HBE studies) or 3 experiments with 16HBE14o- cultures. Morphological studies with mouse airways exposed to PBS or P. aeruginosa are representative of several sections from two experiments. Data from bar graphs represent the mean ± S.E. from at least three to four experiments and were analyzed by unpaired t test or two-way analysis of variance. Statistical significance was defined with p < 0.05. Airway Inflammation Activates the UPR in Vivo—We have reported that ER Ca2+ stores are expanded in native HBE harvested directly from infected/inflamed CF airways as compared with HBE harvested from uninfected/non-inflamed donors (1Ribeiro C.M.P. Paradiso A.M. Carew M.A. Shears S.B. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10202-10209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To address whether the up-regulation of ER Ca2+ stores in CF airways was associated with an increased XBP-1 mRNA splicing, we measured the levels of XBP-1s in freshly isolated normal and infected/inflamed CF HBE. Fig. 1A depicts a representative Southern blot illustrating that XBP-1s is increased in CF as compared with normal airway epithelia. The data compiled from XBP-1 mRNA splicing from normal and CF epithelia are shown in Fig. 1B. These findings suggest that the IRE1-dependent XBP-1 UPR pathway is activated in native infected/inflamed CF airway epithelia. Stronger data linking inflammation with airway epithelial ER expansion in vivo were provided by findings from wild type mouse airways exposed to 40 μl of PBS or PBS containing 1 × 106 colony forming units of P. aeruginosa strain PAK (21Smith R.S. Wolfgang M.C. Lory S. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 1677-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Although this is a model of acute pneumonia (21Smith R.S. Wolfgang M.C. Lory S. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 1677-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), it also induces airway inflammation 24 h after infection, regardless of whether the bacteria have been cleared from the airways. Histological analyses of P. aeruginosa-challenged lungs at 24 h revealed areas that were clearly inflamed (Fig. 2B) and areas that showed no evidence of inflammation (Fig. 2C). Inflamed areas were characterized by an increased thickness of the airway wall and an increased number of nuclei (Fig. 2B) corresponding to infiltration of inflammatory cells seen with hematoxylin and eosin staining (Fig. 2E). Illustrative hematoxylin and eosin staining from non-inflamed airways challenged with PBS or P. aeruginosa is shown in Fig. 2, D and F, respectively. As visualized by calreticulin staining, ER expansion was only observed in epithelia from airways that were inflamed 24 h post-inoculation with P. aeruginosa (Fig. 2B). ER expansion was not observed in airway sites that were not inflamed post-inoculation with P. aeruginosa (Fig. 2C). The epithelial calreticulin staining in these airways was similar to that of PBS-exposed airways (Fig. 2A). Together with the findings from Fig. 1, these data suggest that epithelial ER expansion and UPR activation are a feature of inflamed airways. These findings are particularly significant to CF airways disease, because P. aeruginosa is the dominant pathogen in CF. To test this association further, studies were conducted with ERAI mice, which exhibit ER stress-dependent XBP-1 mRNA splicing coupled to expression of the fluorescent protein Venus, a variant of green fluorescent protein (25Iwawaki T. Akai R. Kohno K. Miura M. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The same protocol used for the experiments illustrated in Fig. 2 was utilized in these studies. XBP-1 splicing, as reflected by increased Venus fluorescence, was increased 24 h post P. aeruginosa infection in airway epithelia from inflamed airways that showed increased thickness of the airway wall, as evidenced by an increased number of cells (Fig. 3, C and D) and parenchyma destruction (data not shown). In contrast, XBP-1 splicing/Venus expression was low in non-inflamed airway sites exhibiting thin airway walls and a healthy parenchyma in both PBS- and P. aeruginosa-challenged airways (Fig. 3, A, B, E, and F). Quantification of Venus fluorescence intensity, expressed per surface airway epithelial area, strengthened the notion that XBP-1 splicing was increased in airway epithelia from inflamed airways (Fig. 3G). Together with the findings from Fig. 2, these data suggest that airway inflammatory responses up-regulate the levels of XBP-1s, which are associated with ER expansion in airway epithelia. Inflammation of Polarized 16HBE14o- Cultures Triggers a UPR Coupled to XBP-1 mRNA Splicing—We have previously shown that XBP-1s induced by luminal exposure of primary cultures of HBE to an inflammatory stimulus (SMM) is associated with a hyperinflammatory phenotype dependent on ER Ca2+ store expansion (2Ribeiro C.M.P.

Chem. 2005; 280: 17798-17806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), a notion further reinforced by the data presented in Figs. 1, 2, 3. However, the UPR acts through a variety of mechanisms and the functional link between XBP-1s and ER Ca2+ store expansion has not been established. Hence, the present study was designed to address the hypothesis that XBP-1s induced by airway inflammati"
https://openalex.org/W1995541462,"Insulin is a hormone vital for glucose homeostasis, and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) plays a key role in its clearance. IDE exhibits a remarkable specificity to degrade insulin without breaking the disulfide bonds that hold the insulin A and B chains together. Using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometry to obtain high mass accuracy, and electron capture dissociation (ECD) to selectively break the disulfide bonds in gas phase fragmentation, we determined the cleavage sites and composition of human insulin fragments generated by human IDE. Our time-dependent analysis of IDE-digested insulin fragments reveals that IDE is highly processive in its initial cleavage at the middle of both the insulin A and B chains. This ensures that IDE effectively splits insulin into inactive N- and C-terminal halves without breaking the disulfide bonds. To understand the molecular basis of the recognition and unfolding of insulin by IDE, we determined a 2.6-A resolution insulin-bound IDE structure. Our structure reveals that IDE forms an enclosed catalytic chamber that completely engulfs and intimately interacts with a partially unfolded insulin molecule. This structure also highlights how the unique size, shape, charge distribution, and exosite of the IDE catalytic chamber contribute to its high affinity ( approximately 100 nm) for insulin. In addition, this structure shows how IDE utilizes the interaction of its exosite with the N terminus of the insulin A chain as well as other properties of the catalytic chamber to guide the unfolding of insulin and allowing for the processive cleavages."
https://openalex.org/W2002561997,"Background Placental malaria (PM) is a leading cause of maternal and infant mortality. Although the accumulation of parasitized erythrocytes (PEs) and monocytes within the placenta is thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of PM, the molecular mechanisms underlying PM remain unclear. Based on the hypothesis that excessive complement activation may contribute to PM, in particular generation of the potent inflammatory peptide C5a, we investigated the role of C5a in the pathogenesis of PM in vitro and in vivo. Methodology and Principal Findings Using primary human monocytes, the interaction between C5a and malaria in vitro was assessed. CSA- and CD36-binding PEs induced activation of C5 in the presence of human serum. Plasmodium falciparum GPI (pfGPI) enhanced C5a receptor expression (CD88) on monocytes, and the co-incubation of monocytes with C5a and pfGPI resulted in the synergistic induction of cytokines (IL-6, TNF, IL-1β, and IL-10), chemokines (IL-8, MCP-1, MIP1α, MIP1β) and the anti-angiogenic factor sFlt-1 in a time and dose-dependent manner. This dysregulated response was abrogated by C5a receptor blockade. To assess the potential role of C5a in PM, C5a plasma levels were measured in malaria-exposed primigravid women in western Kenya. Compared to pregnant women without malaria, C5a levels were significantly elevated in women with PM. Conclusions and Significance These results suggest that C5a may contribute to the pathogenesis of PM by inducing dysregulated inflammatory and angiogenic responses that impair placental function."
https://openalex.org/W2156085254,"The gene that encodes the ATM protein kinase is mutated in ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). One of the prominent features of A-T is progressive neurodegeneration. We have previously reported that primary astrocytes isolated from Atm-/- mice grow slowly and die earlier than control cells in culture. However, the mechanisms for this remain unclear. We show here that intrinsic elevated intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are associated with the senescence-like growth defect of Atm-/- astrocytes. This condition is accompanied by constitutively higher levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and p16Ink4a in Atm-/- astrocytes. We also observe that ROS-induced up-regulation of p16Ink4a occurs correlatively with ERK1/2-dependent down-regulation and subsequent dissociation from chromatin of Bmi-1. Furthermore, both mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK inhibitor PD98059 and antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine restored normal proliferation of Atm-/- astrocytes. These results suggest that ATM is required for normal astrocyte growth through its ability to stabilize intracellular redox status and that the inability to control ROS is the molecular basis of limited cell growth of Atm-/- astrocytes.

Within the central nervous system (CNS), proper responses to ROS are required to prevent neurodegeneration (6Lucius R. Sievers J.

DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 1109-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Although increased oxidative stress has been shown to characterize ATM deficiency in the CNS, the mechanisms by which oxidative stress promotes neuronal cell loss in A-T remain unclear.A-T neurodegeneration is primarily due to a loss of cerebella Purkinje neurons and to malfunction of other neuronal cells as well (3Crawford T.O. Semin. Pediatr. Neurol. 1998; 5: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Neurons in the CNS depend upon astrocytes for structural, functional, and thiol support (17Wong P.K.Y. Lynn W.S. J. Immunol. Immunophamacol. 1997; 17: 30-35Google Scholar, 18Wang X.F. Cynader M.S. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1434-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). For example, Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum rely heavily on their supporting Bergmann astrocytes (19Takuma K. Baba A. Matsuda T. Prog. Neurobiol. 2004; 72: 111-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). We have shown that Bergmann astrocytes of Atm-/- mice are under oxidative stress (20Liu N. Stoica G. Yan M. Scofield V.L. Qiang W. Lynn W.S. Wong P.K.Y. Lab. Investig. 2005; 85: 1471-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), implying that oxidative stress resulting from a loss of ATM may promote astrocyte dysfunction. Others have also shown that cultured astrocytes from Atm-/- mice have cell cycle and growth defects (21Gosink E.C. Chong M.J. McKinnon P.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5294-5298PubMed Google Scholar) and that astrocytes isolated from Atm-/- mouse embryos grow poorly in culture and readily undergo senescence (15Watters D.J. Redox Rep. 2003; 8: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 20Liu N. Stoica G. Yan M. Scofield V.L. Qiang W. Lynn W.S. Wong P.K.Y. Lab. Investig. 2005; 85: 1471-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These observations imply that ATM is essential for normal astrocyte growth and maturation. In light of the importance of astrocytes in supporting neurons against oxidative stress, we hypothesize that aberrant growth and function of Atm-/- astrocytes may contribute to neuron loss in A-T.We show here that Atm-/- astrocytes exhibit senescence-like growth arrest, compared with the growth characteristics of their wild type (Atm+/+) counterparts. We also show that elevated ROS levels are one of the causes of proliferation defects in Atm-/- astrocytes. This conclusion is based on the observation that defective cell growth of Atm-/- astrocytes is restored to normal by the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC). This in turn implies that the role of ATM in normal astrocytic proliferation involves stabilization of redox status in the cell. We also observe that growth arrest of Atm-/- astrocytes is associated with chronic maintenance of high levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 under conditions in which intracellular ROS levels are elevated. In addition, we identify an intermediate player, Bmi-1, that links ERK1/2 to up-regulation of p16Ink4a. Bmi-1, apolycomb group protein, has been implicated in proliferation of several cell types, through its transcriptional repression of p16Ink4a (22Molofsky A.V. He S. Bydon M. Morrison S.J. Pardal R. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 23Pardal R. Molofsky A.V. He S. Morrison S.J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 2005; 70: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We observe that ROS-induced Bmi-1 down-regulation and dissociation from chromatin are both ERK1/2-dependent. This suggests that the up-regulation of p16Ink4a is mediated by a mechanism involving ERK1/2 activation and Bmi-1 loss-of-function as transcription repressor of p16Ink4a. Finally, we show that the MEK inhibitor PD98059 reverses p16Ink4a up-regulation and chromatin dissociation of Bmi-1. Furthermore, knockdown of p16Ink4a greatly corrected the cell growth defect in Atm-/- astrocytes. These studies identify a role of ATM in controlling normal astrocyte growth and maturation. This is carried out by suppression of oxidative stress-dependent signaling pathways.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMice—Atm-/- mice were originally generated by C. Barlow (24Barlow C. Hirotsune S. Paylor R. Liyanage M. Eckhaus M. Collins F. Shiloh Y. Crawley J.N. Ried T. Tagle D. Wynshaw-Boris A. Cell. 1996; 86: 159-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). For this study, they were purchased from the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). We genotyped offspring (Atm+/+, Atm+/-, or Atm-/-) by real time polymerase chain reaction-based assays of mouse tail DNA. Littermates were used as controls in all of the experiments. Animal care was in accordance with the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center guidelines for animal experiments.Cells and Cell Culture—Immortalized murine C1 astrocytes were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) (25Lin Y.C. Chow C.W. Yuen P.H. Wong P.K.Y. J. Neurovirol. 1997; 3: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The cells were passaged biweekly and used for experiments while in the exponential growth phase. Primary astrocytes were isolated from 1–2-day-old newborn mouse pups by a method described previously (20Liu N. Stoica G. Yan M. Scofield V.L. Qiang W. Lynn W.S. Wong P.K.Y. Lab. Investig. 2005; 85: 1471-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 26Lee Y. Chong M.J. McKinnon P.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6687-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whole brain of each newborn mouse was removed and minced separately in ice-cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium. A single-cell suspension was obtained by passing the minced tissue through a 70-m nylon mesh cell strainer. The cells were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated 10-mm flasks and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 units/ml penicillin, 5 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2.5 g/ml Fungizone. The cells were cultured for 4 days in an incubator with 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C until reaching confluence. They were passaged by trypsinization. Cells from passage 4 or 5 were used for all experiments. Astrocytes by the fourth or fifth passage were >99% glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive (27Shikova E. Lin Y.C. Saha K. Brooks B.R. Wong P.K.Y. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Chemical Reagents—ATM inhibitor KU55933 (10 μm) was purchased from Sigma. MEK inhibitor PD98059 (50 μm) was purchased from BD Biosciences, and antioxidant NAC (1 mm) was kindly provided by M. Yan (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center) (28Yan M. Zhu C. Liu N. Jiang Y. Scofield V.L. Riggs P.K.Y. Qiang W. Lynn W.S. Wong P.K.Y. Free. Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 41: 640-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).Analysis of Cell Senescence—SA β-galactosidase assay kit (Cell Signaling) was used to visualize senescent cells. Astrocytes were cultured in 6-well plates for 2 days and then fixed after being washed twice with PBS. The cells were further incubated for 24 h in the presence of staining solution-containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal). Senescent cells were distinguished from viable cells using β-galactosidase, which is blue under the microscope.Analysis of Intracellular ROS—Intracellular ROS accumulation was monitored by using 2′-7′-dichlorofluorescene diacetate (H2DCFDA), which forms a fluorescent compound, dichlorofluorescein, upon oxidation with ROS. After 30 min of incubation in 10 μm H2DCFDA, the cells were rinsed twice with PBS. Fluorescence was monitored by scanning the whole well using a NucleoCounter (New Brunswick Scientific Co., Ltd.) set at excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 535 nm.Protein Analysis—The cells (1–5 × 106) were seeded into 10-cm dishes, grown to 70% confluence, and treated with H2O2 at different concentrations. At 1, 4, or 16 h after H2O2 treatment, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then scraped directly into lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% w/v SDS, 0.5% v/v Nonidet P-40, 0.5% w/v sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete Mini tablets; Roche Applied Science). Protein concentrations were determined using a Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). The protein lysates (30 μg) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 12% gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Antibodies used for Western blotting analysis were anti-ERK1/2, anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), anti-phospho-Rb (Ser807/811), anti-PCNA, and anti-p27kip1 (Cell Signaling Technology); anti-Bmi-1 (Upstate Biotechnology); anti-p21cip1, anti-p16Ink4a, and anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).siRNA-mediated Knockdown—For siRNA knockdown of Atm, the cells were transfected for 48 h with 20 nm siRNA (mouse-specific Atm) in medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol for cells. Validated siRNA (SMARTpool) was obtained from Dharmacon. The negative control siRNA used was siCONTROL, which contains at least four mismatches to all known human, mouse, and rat genes. For mock transfection, we used siRNA suspension buffer and Lipofectamine containing no siRNA. For siRNA knockdown of p16Ink4a, mouse-specific p16Ink4a siRNA was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.Immunofluorescence—The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min. For staining with antibodies, the cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS. Primary antibodies were added, and the cells were incubated at 4 °C overnight. The cells were then washed three times in PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min each, and fluorescent secondary antibodies were added for 1 h at 37 °C. The nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and the slides were mounted in Slowfade (Molecular Probes). The cells were imaged under an Olympus IX2-SL microscope equipped with a ×400 objective and an Olympus DP 70 digital camera connected to a PC computer.Statistics—For each experiment, the data are presented as the means ± S.D. of values. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Statistical comparisons of values for Atm+/+ versus Atm-/- mice and for untreated control versus treated samples were made using the Mann-Whitney U test. The differences were considered significant when p < 0.05.RESULTSLoss of ATM Impairs Proliferation in Astrocytes—We have reported previously that ATM-deficient primary astrocytes grow slowly, become senescent, and die in culture (20Liu N. Stoica G. Yan M. Scofield V.L. Qiang W. Lynn W.S. Wong P.K.Y. Lab. Investig. 2005; 85: 1471-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with those reported by Gosink et al. (21Gosink E.C. Chong M.J. McKinnon P.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5294-5298PubMed Google Scholar). To compare the rate of proliferation of Atm+/+ and Atm-/- astrocytes, we analyzed their cell growth curves. As shown in Fig. 1A, Atm-/- astrocytes proliferated much more slowly than Atm+/+ astrocytes. In particular, Atm+/+ astrocytes show 2.5–3 times higher rates of proliferation than Atm-/- astrocytes at 4 and 5 days after subculturing. When monolayer of Atm+/+ and Atm-/- astrocytes were observed under the microscope following further incubation for 4 days, Atm-/- astrocytes showed lower densities than wild type control cells with a decrease of ∼50% in cell number (Fig. 1B, left panel). This is consistent with our findings for C1 astrocytes, a murine immortalized astrocyte cell line (25Lin Y.C. Chow C.W. Yuen P.H. Wong P.K.Y. J. Neurovirol. 1997; 3: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although the ATM inhibitor KU55933 slightly decreases astrocytes proliferation, the loss of ATM by ATM siRNA reduced cell proliferation by ∼40% (Fig. 1B, right panel). To obtain direct evidence that ATM deficiency causes cell senescence, a specific SA β-galactosidase assay was performed after 2 days of culture. Fig. 1C shows that senescent cells are present two times more in Atm-/- astrocyte cultures than Atm+/+ cultures. These data indicate that ATM deficiency causes the senescent-like cell growth defect in Atm-/- astrocytes.Decreased Proliferation in Atm-/- Astrocytes Is Caused by Elevated ROS Levels—ATM monitors cellular redox status in addition to its monitoring of DNA damage and genomic instability (26Lee Y. Chong M.J. McKinnon P.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6687-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and cells lacking ATM show ROS accumulation (16Barzilai A. Yamamoto K. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 1109-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Although we have previously shown that a loss of Atm results in oxidative damage in the brain (20Liu N. Stoica G. Yan M. Scofield V.L. Qiang W. Lynn W.S. Wong P.K.Y. Lab. Investig. 2005; 85: 1471-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the involvement of oxidative stress in defective astrocyte growth in the ATM-deficient mouse has not been tested. To address this issue, we compared intracellular ROS levels in Atm+/+ and Atm-/- astrocytes by H2DCFDA staining of intracellular H2O2. The data show that the intracellular levels of ROS are significantly higher in Atm-/- astrocytes than in Atm+/+ astrocytes and that antioxidant NAC reduces the elevated ROS levels of Atm-/- astrocytes to normal levels (Fig. 2A). This result suggests that elevated ROS levels are intrinsic characteristics of cells lacking ATM. This is consistent with our results from C1 astrocytes treated with ATM-specific inhibitor, KU55933, which show higher levels of intracellular ROS compared with untreated control cells (data not shown). For direct evidence that defective proliferation of Atm-/- astrocytes is due to elevated ROS levels, we treated Atm-/- astrocytes with NAC and compared their proliferation rates to those of untreated cells. Fig. 2B shows that proliferation rates for Atm-/- astrocytes were increased by treatment with NAC, showing nearly 2–2.5 times higher rates than untreated Atm-/- counterpart at 3 and 4 days after subculturing. This effect of NAC was confirmed by photomicrograph, which disclosed increased cell density by NAC (Fig. 2C). This is consistent with our findings that NAC decreases the proportion of senescent cells in Atm-/- astrocyte cultures (Fig. 2D). These results provide strong evidence linking defective growth of Atm-/- astrocytes to elevated intracellular ROS.FIGURE 2Decreased proliferation in Atm-/- astrocytes is caused by elevated ROS levels. A, Atm+/+ and Atm-/- astrocytes were either left untreated or pretreated with NAC (1 mm) for 2 h. Fluorescent H2DCFDA levels were determined for these cells. The means ± S.D. of three independent experiments are shown. *, p < 0.05 when untreated Atm-/- culture were compared with untreated Atm+/+ astrocytes or when NAC-treated Atm-/- astrocytes were compared with untreated Atm-/- astrocytes.

Fig. 3A shows that H2O2 elevated intracellular ROS levels in Atm+/+ astrocytes and that treatment of Atm+/+ astrocytes with NAC reduced their intracellular ROS to normal levels. Atm+/+ astrocytes also showed significantly decreased proliferation 2 days after H2O2 treatment, but H2O2-induced defective proliferation was partially restored by NAC (Fig. 3B). Treatment with H2O2 for 2 days followed by 1 day of incubation in H2O2-free medium induced SA β-galactosidase expression in ∼40% of Atm+/+ astrocytes, but NAC significantly prevented H2O2-induced senescence (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that H2O2 inhibits astrocytes proliferation through elevating intracellular ROS, regardless of their ATM status.FIGURE 3H2O2-treated Atm+/+ astrocytes show reduced proliferation and up-regulated levels of CDK inhibitors.

The inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) are considered to play an important role in cell cycle arrest and premature senescence (30Collado M. Blasco M.A. Serrano M. Cell. 2007; 130: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). Others have shown that the CDK inhibitor p21cip1 is up-regulated in Atm-/- astrocytes (26Lee Y. Chong M.J. McKinnon P.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6687-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the effects of ROS on levels of CDK inhibitors, including p16Ink4a, p19Arf, p21cip1, and p27kip1 in Atm+/+ astrocytes. H2O2 treatment of Atm+/+ astrocytes stimulated expression of p21cip1 and p16Ink4a, but not p27kip1 in Atm+/+ astrocytes (Fig. 3D, upper and lower panels). However, no p19Arf band was present in the lysates from those cells. These alterations indicate that activation of the p16Ink4a and/or p19Arf-p21cip1 senescence pathway(s) may be involved in ROS-mediated senescence in astrocytes. Furthermore, activation of p16Ink4a was attenuated by NAC (Fig. 3E). These findings suggest that intracellular ROS-mediated oxidative stress induces senescence in astrocytes via activation of the p16Ink4a pathway.In Atm-/- Astrocytes, ERK1/2 Is Constitutively Activated, and CDK Inhibitors Are Up-regulated—We have previously reported that ERK1/2 is activated in both Atm-/- astrocytes in culture and in Bergmann glia in the cerebella of Atm-/- mice (20Liu N. Stoica G. Yan M. Scofield V.L. Qiang W. Lynn W.S. Wong P.K.Y. Lab. Investig. 2005; 85: 1471-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We consistently observed higher level of phospho-ERK1/2 in Atm-/- astrocytes than in Atm+/+ astrocytes. In addition, Bmi-1, a polycomb ring finger oncogene product, is down-regulated in Atm-/- cells (Fig. 4A), which is consistent with the fact that Bmi-1 promotes cell proliferation via repression of CDK inhibitors. In Fig. 3D, we have shown that intracellular ROS levels increased in Atm-/- astrocytes, and H2O2 up-regulated CDK inhibitors. We therefore reasoned that CDK inhibitors might be up-regulated to decrease proliferation in Atm-/- astrocytes. We thus compared the basal levels of CDK inhibitors in Atm-/- astrocytes with those in wild type control cells. Fig. 4B shows that the basal expression levels of p53, p21cip1, and p16Inka were higher in Atm-/- cells than in the wild type cells. p16Ink4a was up-regulated Atm-/- cerebella tissues. Not surprisingly, Atm-/- astrocytes show lower levels of retinoblastoma (Rb) phosphorylation than do wild type control cells. Moreover, Bmi-1 levels were significantly down-regulated in the Atm-/- tissues (Fig. 4C, left and right panels).FIGURE 4In Atm-/- astrocytes, ERK1/2 is constitutively activated and CDK inhibitors are up-regulated. A and B, for Atm+/+ and Atm-/- astrocytes, levels of phospho-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, and Bmi-1 (A) and levels of p53, p21cip1, and p16Ink4a (B) were assessed by direct Western blotting analysis. C, levels of Bmi-1, p53, p21cip1, p16Ink4a, and phospho-Rb were compared for Atm+/+ and Atm-/- cerebella tissues by direct Western blotting analysis. The means ± S.D. of three different mice tissues are shown. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 when Atm-/- tissues was compared with Atm+/+ tissues. D, Atm+/+ and Atm-/- astrocytes were treated with 100 μm H2O2. The cells were then harvested to access levels of Bmi-1 and p16Ink4a at the indicated times after H2O2 treatment. E, Atm+/+ and Atm-/- astrocytes were either left untreated or treated with 100 μm H2O2. Levels of phospho-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, p16Ink4a, and phospho-Rb were determined by direct Western blotting analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next compared p16Ink4a levels in Atm-/- astrocytes and Atm+/+ astrocytes, to which exogenous H2O2 had been added. Interestingly, the addition of H2O2 caused a brief up-regulation of p16Inka at 4 h in wild type control cells but then reversed itself down to the untreated basal level at 16 h post-treatment. However, when Atm-/- astrocytes were exposed to H2O2, the level of p16Ink4a expression was further elevated, and this up-regulation persisted from 4 to 16 h post-H2O2 treatment. This means that oxidative stress caused by elevated ROS is reversible to normal levels when ATM kinase is present. In both Atm+/+ and Atm-/- astrocytes, Bmi-1 was down-regulated in response to H2O2, but its level was lower in Atm-/- astrocytes than in Atm+/+ astrocytes (Fig. 4D). In Atm+/+ astrocytes, the brief expression of p16Ink4a may shut down cell cycling, allowing time for the cells to repair any damage. Once the job is done, their levels return to normal, as a result of the redox balancing action of ATM.Fig. 4E shows that in both Atm+/+ and Atm-/- astrocytes, H"
https://openalex.org/W2075571246,"Background Endocrine disrupting chemicals are widely distributed in the environment and derive from many different human activities or can also be natural products synthesized by plants or microorganisms. The phytoestrogen, genistein (4′, 5, 7-trihydroxy-isoflavone), is a naturally occurring compound found in soy products. Genistein has been the subject of numerous studies because of its known estrogenic activity. Methodology/Principal Findings We report that genistein exposure of zebrafish embryos induces apoptosis, mainly in the hindbrain and the anterior spinal cord. Timing experiments demonstrate that apoptosis is induced during a precise developmental window. Since adding ICI 182,780, an ER antagonist, does not rescue the genistein-induced apoptosis and since there is no synergistic effect between genistein and estradiol, we conclude that this apoptotic effect elicited by genistein is estrogen-receptors independent. However, we show in vitro, that genistein binds and activates the three zebrafish estrogen receptors ERα, ERβ-A and ERβ-B. Furthermore using transgenic ERE-Luciferase fish we show that genistein is able to activate the estrogen pathway in vivo during larval stages. Finally we show that genistein is able to induce ectopic expression of the aromatase-B gene in an ER-dependent manner in the anterior brain in pattern highly similar to the one resulting from estrogen treatment at low concentration. Conclusion/Significance Taken together these results indicate that genistein acts through at least two different pathways in zebrafish embryos: (i) it induces apoptosis in an ER-independent manner and (ii) it regulates aromatase-B expression in the brain in an ER-dependent manner. Our results thus highlight the multiplicity of possible actions of phytoestrogens, such as genistein. This suggests that the use of standardized endpoints to study the effect of a given compound, even when this compound has well known targets, may carry the risk of overlooking interesting effects of this compound."

The authors sought to determine prevalence of obesity and malnutrition in school-going children, from grades 6th to 8th of different schools of Karachi and assess associations that affect the weight of the children. Methodology/Principal Findings A cross sectional study design with children studying in grades 6th to 8th grade, in different schools of Karachi. We visited 10 schools of which 4 consented; two subsidized government schools and two private schools. A questionnaire was developed in consultation with a qualified nutritionist. Height and weight were measured on calibrated scales. A modified BMI criterion for Asian populations was used. Data was collected from 284 students. Of our sample, 52% were found to be underweight whereas 34% of all the children were normal. Of the population, 6% was obese and 8% overweight. Of all obese children, 70% belonged to the higher socio-economic status (SES) group, while of the underweight children, 63.3% were in the lower SES. Amongst obese children in our study, 65% ate meat every day, compared to 33% of normal kids. Conclusion Obesity and undernutrition co-exist in Pakistani school-children. Our study shows that socio-economic factors are important since obesity and overweight increase with SES. Higher SES groups should be targeted for overweight while underweight is a problem of lower SES. Meat intake and lack of physical activity are some of the other factors that have been highlighted in our study."

Following OGD, synaptic AMPAR currents in hippocampal neurons show marked inward rectification and increased sensitivity to channel blockers selective for GluR2-lacking AMPARs. This occurs via two mechanisms: a delayed down-regulation of GluR2 mRNA expression and a rapid internalization of GluR2-containing AMPARs during the OGD insult, which are replaced by GluR2-lacking receptors.

TIF1β, also known as KAP-1 (KRAB domain-associated protein) or KRIP-1, acts as a transcriptional corepressor for many transcription factors, in particular for the Krüppel-associated box domain-containing zinc finger transcription factors. TIF1β is also an intrinsic component of two chromatin remodeling and histone deacetylase complexes, the N-CoR1 and nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation complexes. In contrast to these activities, we report that TIF1β is a coactivator of NGFI-B and that it is as potent as the SRC coactivators in this context. Using pull-down assays and immunoprecipitation, we showed that TIF1β interacts directly with NGFI-B and with other Nur family members. NGFI-B is an important mediator of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) activation of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) transcription, and TIF1β enhances transcription mediated through the NGFI-B target, the Nur response element (NurRE). The NurRE binds Nur factor dimers and is responsive to signaling pathways. In keeping with the role of NGFI-B as mediator of CRH signaling, we found that TIF1β is recruited to the POMC promoter following CRH stimulation and that TIF1β potentiates CRH and protein kinase A signaling through the NurRE; it acts synergistically with the SRC2 coactivator.

NGFI-B is closely related to Nurr1 (Nur-related factor 1) (RNR-1, TINUR, and HZF-3) and NOR-1 (neuron-derived orphan receptor 1) (MINOR) (1Law S.W. Conneely O.M. DeMayo F.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol.

NGFI-B and NOR-1 are constitutively expressed in some regions of the brain as well as in peripheral tissues (3Ohkura N. Hijikuro M. Yamamoto A. Miki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The Nur factors are immediate early response genes that share a well conserved DNA binding domain and ligand binding domain but a poorly conserved N-terminal A/B region (6Enmark E. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Nur subfamily members are important physiological regulators implicated at multiple levels of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. This axis mediates the stress response via secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and induction of adrenal glucocorticoid synthesis. ACTH is derived from the processing of the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) precursor, and it is under the control of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). At the hypothalamic level, CRH-producing neurons exhibit induced Nur factors after stress (7Honkaniemi J. Kononen J. Kainu T. Pyykonen I. Pelto-Huikko M.

Bonventre J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Looman C. Hellman L. Chambon P. Losson R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1422-1426PubMed Google Scholar). For transcriptional repression, TIF1β recruits different enzymatic activities through direct protein-protein interactions, including 1) the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation complex (NuRD/Mi-2α) (35Schultz D.C. Friedman J.R. Rauscher III, F.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 428-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) and 2) the histone methyltransferase SETDB1, which specifically methylates Lys9 of histone H3 (36Schultz D.C. Ayyanathan K. Negorev D. Maul G.G. Rauscher III, F.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 919-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). TIF1β is also an intrinsic component of the N-CoR-1 complex containing both histone deacetylase and ATP-dependent SWI/SNF activities (37Underhill C. Qutob M.S. Yee S.P. Torchia J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40463-40470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Finally, TIF1β interacts directly with endogenous members of the HP1 (heterochromatin protein 1) family (27Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 38Nielsen A.L. Ortiz J.A. You J. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Khechumian R. Gansmuller A. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6385-6395Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 39Ryan R.F. Schultz D.C. Ayyanathan K. Singh P.B. Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4366-4378Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). These data support a role for TIF1β in the epigenetic regulation of transcription via the initiation and maintenance of heterochromatin structures. In agreement with this general repressor function, TIF1β was shown to be localized in heterochromatin; however, it was also observed in euchromatin (38Nielsen A.L. Ortiz J.A. You J. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Khechumian R. Gansmuller A. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6385-6395Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Consistent with this presence in active euchromatin, TIF1β was found to be a coactivator of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β and GR for the induction of the α1-acid glycoprotein gene (40Chang C.J. Chen Y.L. Lee S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5880-5887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we show that TIF1β enhances POMC gene transcription through Nur orphan NRs. In particular, TIF1β is recruited to the POMC promoter under CRH stimulation, and it enhances Nur-dependent CRH and PKA responses. We further show that the action of TIF1β on NGFI-B-dependent transcription may involve synergistic activation with SRC2, a coactivator of a different structural class that has been implicated in the action of many NRs. Plasmids—The reporter plasmids were constructed in pXP1-luc (41Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-456PubMed Google Scholar) containing the minimal POMC promoter (–34 to +63 bp). The –480 POMC promoter with mutations of the NurRE and NBRE regulatory elements were described previously (42Therrien M. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3492-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The luciferase reporter plasmid containing three copies of the NurRE, the NBRE, or the Tpit/PitxRE regulatory elements was described (16Maira M.H. Martens C. Philips A. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7549-7557Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 43Lamonerie T. Tremblay J.J. Lanctôt C. Therrien M. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1284-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). CMX-NGFI-B, CMX-Nurr1, CMX-NOR-1, and CMX-SRC2 expression vectors have been previously generated (18Maira M.H. Martens C. Batsche E. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 763-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 44Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). Several deletions (ΔC3, ΔN1, ΔN3, and ΔN5) of CMX-NGFI-B expression vectors were described previously and shown to be expressed at similar levels (18Maira M.H. Martens C. Batsche E. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 763-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The NGFI-B N-terminal mutant ΔN7 was deleted between amino acids 74 and 174; it is expressed at similar levels as wild-type NGFI-B (supplemental Fig. 1). The plasmids pCGN-TIF1β, pcDNA3-FLAG-HA-TIF1β, and pCDNA3-FLAG-HA-TIF1β 6KR are generous gifts from Dr. Muriel Aubry (45Mascle X.H. Germain-Desprez D. Huynh P. Estephan P. Aubry M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10190-10202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To generate the 3× FLAG-NGFI-B-V5-His expression plasmid, we modified the pLNCX2 (BD Biosciences) plasmid by insertion of an oligonucleotide containing the 3× FLAG and the restriction sites BglII and HindIII in each end (AGATCTCCACCATGGACTACAAAGACCATGACGGTGATTATAAAGATCATGACATCGACTACAAGGATGACGATGACAAG) and an oligonucleotide containing the V5-His (GGATCCGGTAAGCCTATCCCTAACCCTCTCCTCGGTCTCGATTCTACGCGTACCGGTCATCATCACCATCACCATTGAAAGCTT). This insertion included a BamHI site for subsequent cloning of NGFI-B coding sequence (NM_010444). The NGFI-B-V5-His expression plasmid was produced as described above but without the 5′ 3× FLAG sequence. The expression plasmids for FLAG-tagged TIF1β (NM_011588), Pelp1 (NM_029231), and Mybbp1a (NM_016776) were generated as described above but without the 3′ V5-His sequence. We generated expression plasmids for 3× FLAG-tagged Mta2 (NM_011842), p66β (NM_139304), SRC2 (46Benecke A. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and E47 (AF352579) with a 3× FLAG insertion (GGATCCGACTACAAAGACCATGACGGTGATTATAAAGATCATGACATCGACTACAAGGATGACGATGACAAGTGAAAGCTT). Cell Culture and Transfection—AtT-20 and HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. AtT-20 cells were transfected by lipofection with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), as previously described (17Philips A. Lesage S. Gingras R. Maira M.H. Gauthier Y. Hugo P. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5946-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Each transfection (in duplicates) was repeated at least three times. Generation of Retrovirus-infected AtT-20 Cells—The Eco-Pack-2 293 cells (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) were plated (5 × 106) in a 10-cm plate and transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method with 10 μg of expression plasmid pLNCX2-3×FLAG-NGFI-B-V5-His for 8 h. 16 h later, the medium containing the retrovirus was filtered with a 0.22-μm filter; diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum with penicillin/streptomycin and 1 μg/ml Poly-brene (Sigma); and added to AtT-20 cells. This infection procedure was repeated three times/day for 2 days, and infected AtT-20 cells were cultured with 400 μg/ml neomycin. The growing neomycin-resistant colonies were pooled together to generate a retrovirus-infected population of about 5,000 independent colonies. Nuclear Extract Preparation and FLAG Purification Procedure—Nuclear extracts used for affinity FLAG purification of flagged proteins were prepared with 4 × 109 cells AtT-20 cells. The cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and collected in a 50-ml tube. The cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in 10 volumes of buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mm DTT, and the protease inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin (10 μg/ml each)) and centrifuged immediately. The cytoplasmic extract was prepared by resuspending the cell pellet in 2 volumes of buffer A and leaving it at 4 °C for 10 min with gentle mixing. The nuclei were collected by centrifugation, washed once with 1 volume of buffer A, and extracted with the addition of 1 volume of buffer HS (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 500 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, and the protease inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin (10 μg/ml each)). The nuclei were allowed to extract for 30 min at 4 °C with continuous gentle mixing. The extract was centrifuged, and the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). The nuclear extracts were precleared at 4 °C using IgG-Sepharose 6 fast flow beads (Amersham Biosciences), A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and agarose IgG beads (Sigma) for 1 h. The extracts were then diluted with 1 volume of IP 2× buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 0.2% Tween 20, and the protease inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin (10 μg/ml each)), and the supernatant was immunoprecipitated for 3 h at 4 °C with α-FLAG M2 or nonimmune IgG cross-linked to agarose beads (Sigma). Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with IP buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 125 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Tween 20) and twice with IP buffer containing 300 mm KCl instead of 125 mm KCl. The eluate was obtained by incubating the bead with 500 μg/ml of 3× FLAG peptide. Mass Spectrometry Analysis—The eluate was resolved on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the gel was silver-stained. The protein bands were excised from the gel and subjected to reduction, alkylation, and in-gel tryptic digestion, as previously described (47Krogan N.J. Kim M. Ahn S.H. Zhong G. Kobor M.S. Cagney G. Emili A. Shilatifard A. Buratowski S. Greenblatt J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6979-6992Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The resulting tryptic peptides were purified and identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. For the proteins indicated in Fig. 2, different peptides were identified, as indicated in supplemental Table 1. Coimmunoprecipitation Assays and Western Blot Analysis—HEK293T cells (3 × 106) were plated in a 10-cm plate and transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method with 5 μg of expression plasmids for tagged polypeptides for 48 h. The cells were then washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then centrifuged and resuspended in 5 volumes of buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, and the protease inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin (10 μg/ml each)) and centrifuged immediately. The cell pellet was resuspend in 2 volumes of buffer A, and cells were allowed to swell on ice for 10 min before the addition of 3 volumes of buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 500 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, and the protease inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin (10 μg/ml each)). Nuclei were allowed to extract for 30 min at 4 °C with continuous gentle mixing. The extract was centrifuged, and the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). The extracts were precleared at 4 °C using IgG Sepharose 6 fast flow beads (Amersham Biosciences), A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and agarose IgG beads (Sigma), and the supernatant was immunoprecipitated for 2 h at 4 °C with α-FLAG M2 cross-linked to agarose beads (Sigma). Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 125 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Tween 20) and twice with buffer D (buffer C with 300 mm KCl). After SDS-PAGE, Western blots were revealed with antibodies against V5 (R960-25; Invitrogen), FLAG M2 (Sigma), hemagglutinin 12CA5 (ab16918; Abcam). Immunodetection was done with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit (or mouse) IgG (Sigma), and revelation was performed with the ECL+ reagent (Amersham Biosciences) as described by the manufacturer. Superose 6 Gel Filtration—Size fractionation of protein complexes was carried out on an AKTA fast protein liquid chromatography apparatus with a Superose 6 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences). Nuclear extracts as previously described (2 mg) were submitted to gel filtration fractionation, and fractions of 500 μl were collected. 80 μl of each fraction were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western immunoblotting with specific antibodies. Molecular size standards were apoferritin (443 kDa) and thyroglobulin (669 kDa) (Amersham Biosciences). After SDS-PAGE, Western blots were revealed with antibodies against Nurr1 (N83220; BD Biosciences), NGFI-B (18Maira M.H. Martens C. Batsche E. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Mol. Cell.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation and Quantitative PCR—AtT-20 cells were treated for 30 min with 10–7 m CRH and/or 10–7 m dexamethasone (Dex) and prepared for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) as described (19Batsche E. Desroches J. Bilodeau S. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19746-19756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) with 5 μg of antibodies against TIF1β (mouse monoclonal 1Tb3 (38Nielsen A.L. Ortiz J.A. You J.

Similar enrichments were obtained with rabbit polyclonal antibody against TIF1β (PF64) (25Cammas F. Mark M. Dolle P. Dierich A. Chambon P. Losson R. Development. 2000; 127: 2955-2963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). siRNA and Reverse Transcription-Quantitative PCR—AtT-20 cells (6 × 105) were plated in 6-well plates and transfected with 50 nmol of siRNA against TIF1β (ON-TARGET plus SMART pool or ON-TARGET plus set of four siRNAs; Dharmacon) or with a nontarget siRNA (Dharmacon) using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Two days after transfection, total RNA and whole cell extracts from AtT-20 cells were performed for reverse transcription-quantitative PCR analysis and protein expression analysis, respectively. Total RNA was prepared with the RNAeasy columns (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was performed with 1 μg of this RNA using oligo(dT)12–18 (Invitrogen) and SuperScript II RT (Invitrogen). The cDNA was then used for quantitative real time PCR (MX 3005; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the SYBR Green kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The primers used were as follows: TIF1β sense, GGATGTTCCAGGGGAGGAATGGAG; TIF1β antisense, CCAGGCTGCTCCATGGAGAATG; POMC sense, TGGAAGATGCCGAGATTCTGCTACAGT; POMC antisense, GATGCAAGCCAGCAGGTTGCTCTC; β-actin sense, TGAACCCTAAGGCCAACCGTGAAA; β-actin antisense, GTCCATCACAATGCCTGTGGTA. For the whole cell extracts, AtT-20 cells were harvested in cold phosphate-buffered saline and extracted at 4 °C for 30 min in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors. After centrifugation, 25 μg of protein extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with antibodies against TIF1β (ab10483; Abcam) and DM1a α-tubulin (sc-32293; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Recombinant Protein Production and Pull-down Assays—The TIF1β-GST and empty-GST was provided by M. Aubry. Recombinant protein production and pull-down assays were done as previously described (19Batsche E. Desroches J. Bilodeau S. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1966821405,"Ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OTC) is a key enzyme in the urea cycle to detoxify ammonium produced from amino acid catabolism. OTC deficiency is an X-linked genetic disorder ranging from fatal in newborns to hyperammonemia and anorexia in adults. Through affinity purification of acetylated peptides and mass spectrometry, we identified that OTC is acetylated on lysine residues, including Lys88, which is also mutated in OTC-deficient patients. OTC acetylation was confirmed to occur under physiological conditions. Biochemical characterizations revealed that OTC Lys88 acetylation decreases the affinity for carbamoyl phosphate, one of the two OTC substrates, and the maximum velocity, whereas the Km for ornithine, the other OTC substrate, is not affected. Furthermore, Lys88 acetylation is regulated by both extracellular glucose and amino acid availability, indicating that OTC activity may be regulated by cellular metabolic status. Our results provide an example of the novel mechanism of regulating metabolic enzyme activity through protein acetylation.

Ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OTC) 3The abbreviations used are: OTC, ornithine carbamoyltransferase; NAM, nicotinamide; TSA, trichostatin A; IP, immunoprecipitation; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. is an X-linked mitochondrial enzyme mainly expressed in hepatocytes and enterocytes. OTC is synthesized as a precursor, and the mitochondrial import is accompanied by removal of the N-terminal signal peptide to produce a 36-kDa mature enzyme. As a key urea cycle enzyme, OTC catalyzes the reaction that converts ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate into citrulline. Ornithine is the deamination product of arginine, whereas carbamoyl phosphate is the condensation product of ammonium generated by amino acid deamination and carbon dioxide. Thus, OTC is of crucial importance for cellular ammonium secretion (as a form of urea) and amino acid catabolism (1Scaglia F. Brunetti-Pierri N. Kleppe S. Marini J. Carter S. Garlick P. Jahoor F. O'Brien W. Lee B. J. Nutr. 2004; 134: 2775S-2782SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because there is no alternative way of urea synthesis, blockade in the urea cycle results in devastating health consequences. OTC mutation is a relative common genetic disorder in human. A deficiency of OTC usually results in central nervous system dysfunction, which may cause irreversible brain damage or may be fatal in newborn infants (2Hauser E.R. Finkelstein J.E. Valle D. Brusilow S.W. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 322: 1641-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). OTC deficiency in adults has milder symptoms but still causes health problems such as hyperammonemia (3Arn P.H. Hauser E.R. Thomas G.H. Herman G. Hess D. Brusilow S.W. N. Engl. J.

Because the gene is on the X chromosome, OTC deficiency is much more prevalent in males. There are >340 OTC mutations identified so far with clinical symptoms (6Yamaguchi S. Brailey L.L. Morizono H. Bale A.E. Tuchman M. Hum. Mutat. 2006; 27: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). No obvious hot spot for OTC mutations has been found. All null mutations are associated with severe neonatal phenotypes, and none survived beyond 5 days of life without treatment. Most disease-associated OTC mutants are missense mutations (7McCullough B.A. Yudkoff M. Batshaw M.L. Wilson J.R. Raper S.E. Tuchman M. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2000; 93: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These observations suggest an indispensable role for OTC activity in human physiology. Addition of acetyl moiety to the ϵ-amino group of a lysine residue is a common mechanism of post-translational modification. Protein acetylation regulates various aspects of protein functions, such as regulating protein-protein interaction (8Waltzer L. Bienz M. Nature. 1998; 395: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The role of acetylation in regulating nuclear proteins and transcriptional factors has been well established after more than a decade of intense research. Histone acetylation affects chromatin structure and gene expression (9Brownell J.E. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6364-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 10Brownell J.E. Zhou J.X. Ranalli T. Kobayashi R. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D.

Cell. 2008; 133: 612-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). The regulatory role of acetylation in enzyme activity was first reported in acetyl-CoA synthetase (14Starai V.J. Celic I. Cole R.N. Boeke J.D. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Science. 2002; 298: 2390-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), in which the active site lysine residue in the Salmonella enterica enzyme is acetylated, and therefore, acetylation inhibits acetyl-CoA synthetase activity. Acetyl-CoA synthetase in other species has also been reported to be regulated by acetylation of the active site lysine residue (15Schwer B. Bunkenborg J. Verdin R.O. Andersen J.S. Verdin E. Proc.

We performed a proteomic analysis of protein acetylation in human liver. Our studies have identified that lysine 88 in OTC is acetylated. Interestingly, the OTC three-dimensional structure (17Shi D.S. Morizono H. Ha Y. Aoyagi I. Tuchman M. Allewell N.M. J. Biol.

Furthermore, mutation of Lys88 is found in human OTC-deficient patients (20Reish O. Plante R.J. Tuchman M. Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1993; 50: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These two lines of evidence suggest that acetylation on Lys88 may play a key role in the regulation of OTC activity. In this study, we have characterized the OTC acetylation and found that Lys88 acetylation inhibits OTC activity. Furthermore, the Lys88 acetylation is affected by cellular metabolic status, indicating a possible role of acetylation in physiological regulation. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293T and Chang liver cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone), 100 units/ml penicillin, and streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cell transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or calcium phosphate methods. Polyclonal Antibody Generation—Pan-acetyllysine polyclonal antibodies were generated using chemically modified acetylated chicken ovalbumin as antigen. Polyclonal antibodies against acetylated OTC Lys88 were generated in rabbits using an acetylated peptide (GMIFEK(Ac)RSTRT) as antigen. Deacetylase Inhibitors Treatment—Deacetylase inhibitor treatments were carried out by adding trichostatin A (TSA; 0.5 μm) and/or nicotinamide (NAM; 5 mm) into culture medium 16 h before harvesting; both concentrations are final concentrations in the culture medium. Glucose/Amino Acid Treatment—Cells or transfected cells were kept in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h before treatment. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and continued culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (without glucose but with essential amino acids; Sigma, D5030) with the desired supplementation of glucose or amino acids. Amino acid concentrations were the total concentrations of equimolar glutamate and aspartate. Cells were harvested after 12 h of treatment. Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 1.5 mm Na3VO4, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation (IP), 500 μl of cell lysate was incubated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose for 4 h at 4 °C; for OTC antibody IP, lysate was incubated with anti-OTC antibody (Aviva Systems Biology; 1:500) overnight and then protein A/G beads were added, and incubation was continued for another 2 h. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and the FLAG-tagged proteins were eluted by FLAG peptides (Gilson Biochemical). His-tagged Protein Expression and Purification—His-tagged wild-type OTC, K88Q, and K88R proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). After reaching a middle exponential growing stage, 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the bacterial culture to induce protein overexpression. Induction was carried out at 20 °C for 4 h. Expressed proteins were purified with nickel beads (GE Healthcare) as recommended by the manufacturer. Purified proteins were stored at -80 °C in 10% glycerol. OTC Assay—The OTC enzyme assay was adapted from a published method (21Ye X.H. Robinson M.B. Batshaw M.L. Furth E.E. Smith I. Wilson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3639-3646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μl of FLAG peptide-eluted ectopic OTC-FLAG solution or 10 μl of OTC antibody-immunoprecipitated beads was added to a solution containing ornithine and triethanolamine to a final volume of 675 μl. OTC reactions were started by adding 75 μl of 150 mm carbamoyl phosphate. Final concentrations in assay of each reagent were 5 mm ornithine, 15 mm carbamoyl phosphate, and 270 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.7. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, reactions were stopped by adding 375 μl of phosphoric acid/sulfuric acid (3:1, v/v). Citrulline production was determined by adding 47 μl of 3% 2,3-butanedionemonoxime, boiling in the dark for 15 min, and reading absorbance at 490 nm. OTC Is Acetylated at Lys88—Most reported acetylation studies are with nuclear proteins, whereas few cytoplasmic protein acetylation studies have been documented. To investigate non-nuclear protein acetylation, human liver tissue was fractionated into nuclear, cytosolic, mitochondrial, and membrane fractions. The subcellular fractions were digested with trypsin, and acetylated peptides were purified by anti-acetyllysine antibody followed by tandem liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Among many acetylated peptides identified, the peptide SLGMIFEK*R was identified in both mitochondrial and membrane fractions from liver samples (Fig. 1A). A Sequest Technologies search indicated that this peptide matches human OTC protein and that the acetylated lysine is Lys88. This acetylation peptide was identified in multiple independent experiments. Interestingly, an independent proteomic survey by Kim et al. (22Kim S.C. Sprung R. Chen Y. Xu Y.D. Ball H. Pei J.M. Cheng T.L. Kho Y. Xiao H. Xiao L. Grishin N.V. White M. Yang X.J. Zhao Y.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 607-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar) also reported that the same peptide is acetylated in mouse OTC. Lys88 in OTC is highly conserved in different species from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to human (Fig. 1B), indicating a critical role in OTC function. We are aware of the possibility that lysine acetylation may come from the in vitro manipulation during sample preparation. For example, formic acid used in solubilizing peptides during mass spectrometry assay could be contaminated by trace amounts of acetate anhydrate, and this contamination could cause acetylation of peptides during sample preparation. TSA is a potent inhibitor toward both class I and II deacetylase, whereas NAM can inhibit class III deacetylase (23Yoshida M. Kijima M. Akita M. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17174-17179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Bouras T. Fu M.F. Sauve A.A. Wang F. Quong A.A. Perkins N.D. Hay R.T. Gu W. Pestell R.G. J. Biol.

Cell. 2004; 116: 551-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). To confirm that OTC Lys88 is acetylated in vivo, human OTC gene with a FLAG tag at the C terminus was cloned into pcDNA3 and expressed in HEK293T cells, and the transfected cells were treated with deacetylase inhibitors. p53, a well known acetylated protein, was included as a positive control. OTC and p53 proteins were immunoprecipitated from transfected cells followed by Western blotting for lysine acetylation. Interestingly, like p53, TSA and NAM treatment also significantly enhanced OTC acetylation (Fig. 1C). These results confirmed that OTC is acetylated in vivo. To further examine whether endogenous OTC is acetylated, Chang liver cells were treated with or without TSA plus NAM. Endogenous OTC protein was precipitated with an anti-OTC antibody, and the acetylation level of OTC was probed by antiacetyllysine antibody. We found that the endogenous OTC acetylation level was significantly increased by treatment with TSA and NAM (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that OTC is acetylated under physiological conditions, and the acetylation of OTC is negatively regulated by deacetylases. Our mass spectrometry data showed that OTC is possibly acetylated on two additional lysine residues, Lys46 and Lys231.A rise in total acetylation detected by anti-acetyllysine antibody is not sufficient to conclude that OTC Lys88 is acetylated. To directly detect OTC Lys88 acetylation, we raised antibody against an acetylated Lys88 OTC peptide. As shown in Fig. 1E, the site-specific antibody recognized the overexpressed wild-type OTC Lys88 acetylation, and the acetylation level of OTC Lys88 increased upon TSA plus NAM treatment. The antibody, however, could not recognize the OTC K88Q mutant, indicating that the antibody is specific for acetylated Lys88 in OTC. The above data demonstrate that Lys88 in OTC is indeed acetylated. Inhibition of Deacetylase Activity Reduces OTC Activity—Lysine 88 has been implicated to be important for OTC catalysis (26Valentini G. De Gregorio A. Di Salvo C. Grimm R. Bellocco E. Cuzzocrea G. Iadarola P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Therefore, acetylation of Lys88 will likely affect its enzymatic activity. We hypothesize that if OTC Lys88 acetylation regulates its enzyme activity, inhibiting deacetylases could increase the acetylation level of Lys88 and in turn, affect OTC activity. Both endogenous and overexpressed OTC activities were examined to test this hypothesis. We first examined OTC activity regulation by deacetylase inhibitors in transfected HEK293 cells. OTC was transfected into HEK293T cells, and the cells were treated with NAM or TSA. OTC protein was immunopurified, and the activity was measured. We observed that the immunoprecipitated OTC activity was inhibited in cells treated with TSA and NAM (Fig. 2A). An inverse correlation between OTC acetylation and activity strongly indicates that OTC activity is negatively regulated by acetylation. Furthermore, Chang liver cells were cultured in the absence or presence of deacetylase inhibitors, TSA and NAM. Endogenous OTC was immunoprecipitated by OTC antibody-conjugated protein A/G beads, and OTC activity was measured on beads. We found that either TSA or NAM treatment decreased endogenous OTC activity (Fig. 2B). The reduction of OTC activity by TSA and NAM indicates that endogenous OTC activity is inhibited by acetylation. Lys88 Acetylation Inhibits OTC Activity—The human disease associated with the K88N mutation causes OTC deficiency, although this mutant OTC has residual activity (27Arranz J.A. Riudor E. Marco-Marin C. Rubio V. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2007; 30: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our finding that inhibition of deacetylases decreases OTC activity. To test the importance of Lys88 acetylation in OTC regulation, we generated the K88R and K88Q mutants. The K88R mutation retains a positive charge and is thus considered as a conserved substitution. K88Q, on the other hand, abolishes the positive charge, and therefore, may mimic the effect of acetylation. Both mutants were expressed in HEK293T cells, and OTC activities were determined from immunoprecipitated protein. The K88R mutant retains substantial enzymatic activity, although it is reduced (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the K88Q mutant is essentially inactive, with <1% of the wild-type OTC activity. These results indicate that a positive charge at position 88 is critical for OTC catalytic activity. Substitution of Lys88 by a glutamine effectively abolishes OTC activity, consistent with our notion that acetylation inhibits OTC activity. We also mutated Lys46 and Lys231, the other two acetylated lysine residues identified in our mass spectrometry data, to glutamines and found that mutation of these two lysine residues had little effect on OTC activity. These results indicate that acetylation of Lys46 and Lys231 is not directly involved in enzyme activity regulation. It is thus of interest to determine whether Lys88 is the primary regulatory acetylation site for OTC activity. We took advantage of the fact that the K88R mutant retains substantial activity. We compared the enzymatic activity of the wild type and the K88R mutant in response to deacetylase inhibitors. As expected, treatment with TSA and NAM decreased OTC enzymatic activity with a concomitant increase in overall OTC acetylation and Lys88 acetylation (Fig. 3B). In contrast, TSA and NAM failed to inhibit the OTC K88R mutant, although overall acetylation was still increased by the deacetylase inhibitors (Fig. 3B). The increase in OTC K88R acetylation is likely due to acetylation of other lysine residues in OTC. Our data strongly indicate that acetylation of Lys88 is responsible for OTC activity inhibition in response to deacetylase inhibitors. The three-dimensional structure of OTC suggests that a modification at Lys88 may affect OTC substrate binding and thus affect OTC activity. To further investigate the mechanism by which Lys88 acetylation reduces OTC activity, we expressed and purified wild-type OTC and the K88R and K88Q mutants from E. coli. Kinetic studies of the purified OTC show that substitution of Lys88 by either arginine or glutamine does not significantly alter the Km for ornithine, suggesting that Lys88 is not directly involved in ornithine binding (Table 1). In contrast, the K88Q mutant increased the Km of carbamoyl phosphate by 10-fold compared with the wild-type protein, whereas the K88R mutant did not significantly increase the Km. These data suggest that the positive charge residue at position 88 is important for carbamoyl phosphate binding. The above observations indicate that acetylation of Lys88 in OTC may decrease its substrate binding toward carbamoyl phosphate by neutralizing the positive charge of Lys88. Given that the physiological concentration of carbamoyl phosphate is ∼0.1 mm in liver cells (28Hayase K. Yonekawa G. Yoshida A. J. Nutr. 1992; 122: 1143-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 29Pausch J. Rasenack J. Haussinger D. Gerok W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 150: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the acetylated OTC would have very low activity. It is worth noting that the K88Q mutant not only altered OTC substrate binding but also dramatically decreased the maximum velocity. The OTC K88R mutant also shows a decreased Vmax, although it is much less severe than the K88Q mutant. Our results support a model that OTC activity is negatively regulated by Lys88 acetylation.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters for OTC K88R and K88Q mutantsEnzymeVmaxKmCarbamoyl phosphateOrnithineμmol·mg–1·min–1mmWild type OTC90.9 ± 3.50.13 ± 0.010.36 ± 0.13OTC K88Q0.6 ± 0.11.24 ± 0.200.55 ± 0.08OTC K88R16.7 ± 1.90.15 ± 0.030.42 ± 0.09 Open table in a new tab Lys88 Acetylation Is Influenced by Glucose and Amino Acid Availability—OTC functions in urea cycle and amino acid catabolism, which may be affected by the availability of cellular fuel. We therefore tested the effect of glucose and amino acids on OTC acetylation. We found that lowering the glucose levels led to a decrease in Lys88 acetylation, as determined by the Lys88 acetylation-specific antibody (Fig. 4A). At the same time, OTC activity was increased by lowering glucose levels in cell culture medium (Fig. 4A), consistent with an inhibitory effect of Lys88 acetylation on OTC activity. This result suggests that an increase in Lys88 acetylation may contribute to OTC inhibition by high glucose. We also tested the effect of amino acids (glutamate and aspartate) on OTC acetylation. Surprisingly, higher amino acid concentrations also increased OTC Lys88 acetylation and decreased OTC activity (Fig. 4B). These observations established a direct link between OTC Lys88 acetylation and the availability of extracellular fuels/nutrients, consistent with the notion that OTC acetylation plays a role in cellular metabolic regulation. The regulatory role of protein acetylation in gene expression has been well established (30Allfrey V.G. Faulkner R. Mirsky A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 51: 786-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). Interestingly, many metabolic enzymes are also found to be acetylated by proteomic survey in multiple species, ranging from bacteria (31Zhang J. Sprung R. Pei J. Tan X. Kim S. Zhu H. Liu C.F. Grishin N.V. Zhao Y. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2009; 8: 215-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) to human. 4W. Yu, Y. Lin, J. Yao, W. Huang, Q. Lei, Y. Xiong, S. Zhao, and K.-L. Guan, unpublished data. However, the functional significance of acetylation in metabolic enzymes is largely unknown. Besides the mass spectrometry data of identifying acetylation, few metabolic enzymes have been functionally characterized regarding the role of acetylation in physiological regulation. One example is the acetyl-CoA synthetase, which is inhibited by lysine acetylation (15Schwer B. Bunkenborg J. Verdin R.O. Andersen J.S. Verdin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 10224-10229Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). This report on OTC provides another example that acetylation inhibits the urea cycle enzyme OTC activity by modifying a critical lysine residue in substrate binding and catalysis. Moreover, our data indicate that OTC acetylation is regulated by cellular nutrient signals, as OTC acetylation is enhanced by high glucose or amino acids. Lysine 88 is the key acetylation site responsible for OTC inactivation. Lys88 locates in a position important for substrate binding/catalysis. Consistently, K88Q has a much weaker affinity toward the substrate carbamoyl phosphate and is almost completely inactive (less than 1% of the wild-type activity). These observations confirm that acetylation may inhibit OTC activity. On the other hand, the K88R mutant had no effect on substrate binding and still retained ∼20% catalytic activity. The moderate reduction in OTC activity of the K88R mutation could be due to the size change in the side chain upon arginine substitution, although the arginine retains the positive charge. On the basis of the mutation analysis and acetylation study, we conclude that acetylation of Lys88 inhibits OTC catalytic activity. It is worth noting that mutation of Lys88 has been found in human OTC deficiency disease, further supporting an important role of Lys88 acetylation in physiological regulation. Cells utilize glucose as the preferred energy source. When glucose is not abundant, cells shift to alternative energy sources, such as fatty acids and amino acids. Utilization of amino acids as an energy source brings two problems to the cell. First, amino acids are important building blocks for proteins, and biosynthesis of amino acids is energy-expensive; thus, amino acids would not be the preferred energy source. Second, amino acid catabolism produces ammonium, which is toxic to the body. Therefore, cells must adapt to metabolic pathways to get rid of ammonium. The urea cycle is a key pathway for ammonium metabolism. For these reasons, urea cycle enzyme activities need to adapt to different extracellular fuel availability. We found that when glucose concentration is high, OTC Lys88 acetylation is increased, and the OTC activity is turned down (Fig. 4A). Therefore, the urea cycle activity is repressed in the abundance of glucose. This makes physiological sense because cells do not need to catabolize amino acids for energy in the presence of glucose. When glucose concentration is decreased, the increase of OTC activity is possibly due to Lys88 deacetylation. This can be explained by the fact that when cells experience glucose shortage, they need to find an alternative energy source such as amino acids. The detoxification of ammonium generated from amino acid catabolism requires high urea cycle activity. We also observed that inhibition of glycolysis by 2-deoxyglucose inhibited OTC acetylation and concomitantly increased OTC activity (data not shown). Therefore, OTC activity may be regulated by cellular energy status. OTC Lys88 acetylation is also enhanced by amino acids (Fig. 4B). Consistently, OTC activity is inhibited by high amino acid levels. However, one might expect that high amino acid levels should increase OTC activity due to an elevated demand for the urea cycle. Further studies are needed to clarify the physiological regulation of OTC acetylation in response to amino acids. Important future questions also include how glucose regulates OTC acetylation. We speculate that glucose may regulate OTC acetylation by affecting the Sirt family deacetylase. It is possible that high glucose decreases the cellular concentration of NAD, which is a cofactor for Sirt, and therefore results in a lower Sirt activity and increased OTC acetylation. In summary, our study shows that Lys88 acetylation inhibits OTC enzymatic activity and that this acetylation is regulated by cellular metabolic status and availability of nutrients.

The essential role of PPARγ in adipocyte gene expression and differentiation has been firmly established by a number of observations, including the high level of PPARγ expression in adipose tissue and the onset of its expression coincident with early stages of adipogenesis in culture (15Chawla A.

Coordinated expression and actions of PPARγ with other factors, such as C/EBPα and C/EBPβ, during fat cell differentiation has been extensively documented (16Farmer S.R. Int. J.

Overall, these observations are consistent with the notion that PPARγ is an essential transcriptional regulator of adipogenesis and is required for maintenance of adipocyte functions including FFA storage and lipid metabolism. Furthermore, the discovery that the insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinediones are high affinity ligands for PPARγ (25Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J.

In fact, amelioration of insulin resistance in obese mice treated with rosiglitazone is coincident with changes in adipocyte gene expression including up-regulation of many genes important for lipid metabolism and storage of triglycerides, as well as glucose disposal (26Wilson-Fritch L. Nicoloro S. Chouinard M. Lazar M.A. Chui P.C. Leszyk J. Straubhaar J. Czech M.P. Corvera S. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 1281-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Most of these genes are similarly affected by thiazolidinedione treatment of adipocytes in culture (26Wilson-Fritch L. Nicoloro S. Chouinard M. Lazar M.A. Chui P.C. Leszyk J. Straubhaar J. Czech M.P. Corvera S. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 1281-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 27Wilson-Fritch L. Burkart A. Bell G. Mendelson K. Leszyk J. Nicoloro S. Czech M. Corvera S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1085-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), suggesting that they reflect direct effects of PPARγ-dependent gene regulation in adipocytes. Thus, modulators of PPARγ functions in adipocytes are highly likely to play roles in regulation of adipocyte metabolism and in determining responses to insulin sensitizers, such as thiazolidinediones. Regulation of PPARγ expression and function in fat cells also needs to be identified and characterized to fully understand adipocyte biology and its role in whole body glucose and lipid homeostasis. Development of obesity coincides with substantial infiltration of macrophages into adipose tissue, which is associated with increased expression of inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). Large amounts of TNFα are secreted by adipocytes and macrophages within adipose tissue of obese subjects (28Wellen K.E. Hotamisligil G.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1785-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar). These agents, in turn, up-regulate adipocyte lipolysis and down-regulate triglyceride storage and insulin signaling, contributing to the metabolic complications of obesity such as impaired glucose tolerance and peripheral insulin resistance. Interestingly, TNFα is known to be a potent negative regulator of adipogenesis and PPARγ function (29Stephens J.M. Lee J. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 971-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 30Zhang B. Berger J. Hu E. Szalkowski D. White-Carrington S. Spiegelman B.M. Moller D.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1457-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). A marked down-regulation of PPARγ transcription in fat cells treated with TNFα has been demonstrated (29Stephens J.M. Lee J. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 971-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 30Zhang B. Berger J. Hu E. Szalkowski D. White-Carrington S. Spiegelman B.M. Moller D.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1457-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and NFκB signaling was proposed to mediate the TNFα inhibition of PPARγ expression in cultured cell systems (31Ruan H. Hacohen N. Golub T.R. Van Parijs L. Lodish H.F. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1319-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Other signaling pathways triggered by TNFα may also influence PPARγ levels at the post-transcriptional level, as TNFα-activated protein kinases may also directly target PPARγ protein, influencing PPARγ activity and/or stability by phosphorylation. For instance, it has been proposed that phosphorylation of PPARγ promotes its degradation via a ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent pathway (32Hauser S. Adelmant G. Sarraf P. Wright H.M. Mueller E. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18527-18533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Moreover, PPARγ phosphorylation has been claimed to decrease ligand-binding affinity, controlling interaction with its co-regulators (33Shao D. Rangwala S.M. Bailey S.T. Krakow S.L. Reginato M.J. Lazar M.A. Nature. 1998; 396: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Together, these observations suggest that regulation of PPARγ activity and stability also appears to be negatively regulated by kinase-mediated phosphorylation (34Diradourian C. Girard J. Pegorier J.P. Biochimie. 2005; 87: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and ubiquitination (32Hauser S. Adelmant G. Sarraf P. Wright H.M. Mueller E. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18527-18533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) followed by PPARγ protein degradation via a ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent pathway (32Hauser S. Adelmant G. Sarraf P. Wright H.M. Mueller E. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18527-18533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Combined, these pathways might be used by TNFα receptor signaling to decrease PPARγ protein levels in adipocytes from chronically inflamed adipose tissue in obese subjects (1Guilherme A. Virbasius J.V. Puri V. Czech M.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar). Additional pathways elicited by TNFα signaling could also be operating to down-regulate PPARγ function in fat cells (reviewed in Ref. 1Guilherme A. Virbasius J.V. Puri V. Czech M.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar). For instance, it has been demonstrated that TNFα-induced cleavage of insulin-signaling molecules, such as AKT, is mediated by a caspase-dependent pathway in adipocytes and seems to contribute to insulin resistance trigged by TNFα (35Medina E.A. Afsari R.R. Ravid T. Castillo S.S. Erickson K.L. Goldkorn T. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 2726-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). More recently, He and colleagues (36He F. Doucet J.A. Stephens J.M. Obesity. 2008; 16: 1735-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) demonstrated that caspase-1 mediates degradation of PPARγ proteins in adipocytes. The authors suggested that PPARγ levels could be modulated by TNFα-stimulated caspase-1 activity in adipose cells (36He F. Doucet J.A. Stephens J.M. Obesity. 2008; 16: 1735-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to extend these observations and to determine whether activation of the caspase cascade by TNFα plays a role in the reductions of PPARγ protein levels induced by this cytokine, similar to its role in the degradation of other signaling molecules in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Here, we present evidence that TNFα triggers a caspase-dependent cleavage of PPARγ proteins in cultured adipocytes, which disrupts its nuclear localization. Caspase-3, -6, and -8, but not caspase-1, -2, -5, -7, or -9, are required for TNFα-elicited PPARγ cleavage in these cells. Based on these results, we postulate that a caspase-3/caspase-6-dependent pathway contributes to the mechanisms whereby TNFα suppresses PPARγ protein levels and its function in adipose cells. Mouse anti-PPARγ monoclonal antibody (clone E-8, catalog number sc-7273) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

The 3T3-L1 adipocytes were cultured in complete Dubecco's modified Eagle's medium (10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin). For TNFα stimulation, 7 days post-differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with the indicated concentration of TNFα for the appropriate time intervals. Cells were then washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline lysed in 1% SDS-containing lysing buffer on ice. Nuclear and cytosolic cell extracts were prepared from 3T3-L1 adipocytes by a modification (38Swick A.G. Blake M.C. Kahn J.W. Azizkhan J.C.

Briefly, cell monolayers were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and once in hypotonic lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. Cells were then harvested in hypotonic lysis buffer, incubated on ice for 5 min and homogenized with 16 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer by adding 0.1% Nonidet P-40 detergent. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 3500 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, and the supernatant was saved as cytosolic extract. The nuclear pellet was once resuspended in 0.5 volume of a hypotonic lysis buffer and centrifuged as before. The nuclear pellet was then resuspended in an extraction buffer containing 17.5 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 330 mm NaCl, 1.1 m urea, 1.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. Nuclei were extracted for 30 min on ice. Finally, the sample was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting nuclear extract and the previously obtained cytosolic extract were analyzed for protein content by BCA analysis (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions and stored at 80 °C. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated without or with the indicated TNFα or inhibitor concentrations for the indicated time, and then harvested with lysis buffer containing 1% SDS. Equal amounts of protein from total cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were incubated with the indicated antibodies overnight at 4 °C and then with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies for 45 min at room temperature. Proteins were then detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit. Aliquots of 40 μg of nuclear fractions isolated from 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated for 12 h at 37 °C in 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline in the presence of 10 units of the indicated recombinant caspase. The reaction was stopped by the addition of electrophoresis sample buffer and samples were subsequently blotted for PPARγ protein. 3T3-L1 adipocytes at day 7 were treated or not with TNFα, washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and immediately fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 12 min at room temperature. Fixed adipocytes were permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 and 0.05% Tween 20 and then stained with mouse monoclonal anti-PPARγ (clone E-8) and rabbit polyclonal anti-cleaved (Asp175)-caspase-3 antibodies for 12 h, followed by labeling with Hoechst 33342 for nuclear staining, Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) for 30 min. The cells were preserved in Vectashield mounting medium for fluorescence (Vector Laboratories Inc.). The Images were obtained using a Nikon TE2000-E2 microscope with a Yokogawa CSU10b spinning disk confocal scan head and custom laser launch, NEOS AOTF and relay optics (Solamere Technology Group, Salt Lake City, UT). Multi-wavelength confocal z-series were acquired with a Nikon 40X Plan Apo oil objective (NA = 1.0) and a QImaging Rolera MGi camera using the standard digitizer. The final pixel size was 0.27 μm/pixel, the z step was 0.3 μm, and the exposure time was 1-s per image. Metamorph Software controlled the microscope hardware and image acquisition. It has been previously shown that TNFα treatment of cultured adipocytes reduced PPARγ protein levels, presumably through suppression of Pparγ gene transcription via the NFκB signaling pathway (30Zhang B.

Straubhaar J. Czech M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2087-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, it is not fully understood whether the decrease in PPARγ protein levels induced by TNFα is also mediated by other TNFα-stimulated pathways in fat cells. Therefore, we conducted experiments to determine whether activation of TNFα receptors in 3T3-L1 adipocytes could lead to PPARγ protein degradation. Treatment of fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (days 7–9) with TNFα for 16 h induced a dose-dependent decrease in PPARγ protein, with half-maximal and maximal effects occurring at 5 and ≈25–50 ng/ml, respectively (Fig. 1B). These concentrations of TNFα correspond to previously reported concentrations of TNFα that elicited maximal impairment of insulin signaling and inhibit PPARγ expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (42Hotamisligil G.S. Murray D.L. Choy L.N. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4854-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Additionally, as depicted in Fig. 1A, treatment of cultured adipocytes with 50 ng/ml TNFα for 6 h caused a time-dependent 60% decrease in PPARγ protein. Immunoblotting with a monoclonal anti-PPARγ antibody raised against an epitope located at the C-terminal region of PPARγ protein also revealed a lower molecular mass band that migrated at ∼45 kDa in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, A and B). Incubation with TNFα increased the level of this 45-kDa PPARγ fragment in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A and B). Thus, whereas TNFα treatment of cultured adipocytes reduces total PPARγ protein levels, it simultaneously induces the formation of a lower molecular weight fragment of PPARγ protein. A Pparγ mRNA, γORF4, which is generated by alternative splicing has been reported recently by Sabatino and colleagues (43Sabatino L. Casamassimi A. Peluso G. Barone M.V. Capaccio D. Migliore C. Bonelli P. Pedicini A. Febbraro A. Ciccodicola A. Colantuoni V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26517-26525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The γORF4 transcript results in the synthesis of a truncated PPARγ protein containing the first 273 amino acids of the mature PPARγ but lacking the entire ligand-binding domain. Thus, one possibility is that the 45-kDa PPARγ immunoreactive band is a translation product of an alternatively spliced Pparγ mRNA expressed upon TNFα stimulation. To test this possibility 3T3-L1 adipocytes were preincubated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (5 μg/ml) and then treated for 6 h with 50 ng/ml TNFα. Cells were then harvested and cell lysate samples immunoblotted for PPARγ protein. Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide did not significantly block the ability of TNFα to induce the production of the 45-kDa PPARγ fragment (data not shown) suggesting that this product is a result of post-translational truncation of existing PPARγ protein. We and other groups have shown that PPARγ degradation rates are remarkably rapid as measured in the presence of cycloheximide (t½ = 2 h) (44Floyd Z.E. Stephens J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4062-4068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 45Christianson J.L. Nicoloro S. Straubhaar J. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 2906-2916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Furthermore, treatment of cultured adipocytes with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 increases the protein levels, suggesting that the proteasome degradation pathway regulates PPARγ protein levels in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (32Hauser S. Adelmant G. Sarraf P. Wright H.M. Mueller E. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18527-18533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). To test whether the 45-kDa fragment seen in cells stimulated with TNFα is a product of proteasomal degradation of PPARγ in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we treated cells with TNFα plus proteasome inhibitors. As depicted in Fig. 2, a marked enhancement of PPARγ protein levels was observed in the presence of the proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin. Moreover, addition of the proteasome inhibitors partially prevented PPARγ protein degradation mediated by TNFα treatment of adipocytes for 3 h (Fig. 2). However, the formation of the 45-kDa PPARγ fragment was not prevented by these proteasome inhibitors, rather, accumulation of the fragment seemed to be enhanced by inhibition of proteasome function. Thus, these results suggest that suppression of the PPARγ protein level through TNFα may also involve proteasome-mediated protein degradation of this nuclear receptor. Generation of the 45-kDa fragment does not require activity of the proteasomal pathway, but ultimate degradation of the fragment may involve the proteasome. TNFα signaling leads to activation of caspase cascades in adipocytes and cleavage of several signaling molecules (35Medina E.A. Afsari R.R. Ravid T. Castillo S.S. Erickson K.L. Goldkorn T. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 2726-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To identify potential caspase cleavage sites in the PPARγ protein sequence, we utilized the web-based tool GraBCas (46Backes C. Kuentzer J. Lenhof H.P. Comtesse N. Meese E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W208-W213Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Several putative caspase consensus cleavage sites in the PPARγ protein sequence were identified as shown in Table 1. These observations prompted us to examine whether caspase activities are involved in PPARγ cleavage elicited by TNFα treatment of cultured adipocytes. To determine whether PPARγ was cleaved by caspases, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were preincubated with the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Boc-d-FMK and then stimulated with TNFα for up to 6 h (Fig. 3). Lysates from the harvested cells were then immunoblotted with anti-PPARγ monoclonal antibody. Consistent with the results depicted in FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, treatment with TNFα for 6 h reduced full-length PPARγ protein levels and induced formation of a 45-kDa fragment. However, the TNFα-mediated decrease in PPARγ protein and appearance of the 45-kDa fragment was abrogated by this broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor (Fig. 3, right panels). This result strongly indicates that TNFα receptor signaling in fat cells induces cleavage of PPARγ by caspases and/or caspase-like proteases. They also suggest that caspase-mediated PPARγ proteolysis may be part of the mechanism whereby TNFα suppresses PPARγ expression levels in adipocytes.TABLE 1Putative caspase cleavage sites in PPARγ proteinAmino acidAmino acid sequenceCaspase49SSVD↓L3, 769TTVD↓F3, 6, 7, 8228ISSD↓I2230SDID↓Q6, 7, 8238ESAD↓L2, 3, 4341DLND↓Q2408LELD↓D1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9411DDSD↓L2, 8490TETD↓M1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 Open table in a new tab Because a general caspase inhibitor prevented the TNFα-induced degradation and cleavage of PPARγ protein (Fig. 3), we next examined the involvement of particular caspases in this process. Thus, a similar experiment was performed with inhibitors of specific caspases. Adipocytes were treated with a panel of caspase inhibitors, then exposed to TNFα for 6 h and lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-PPARγ antibody. Consistent with the results depicted in Fig. 3, the general caspase inhibitor Boc-d-FMK completely inhibited the decline of PPARγ protein and appearance of the 45-kDa PPARγ fragment (Fig. 4, upper panel). The caspase-8 inhibitor (Z-IETD-FMK) blocked both TNFα-induced PPARγ degradation and 45-kDa PPARγ fragment formation to nearly the same extent as the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Boc-d-FMK (Fig. 4)."
https://openalex.org/W2000867593,"IQGAP1 is a 190-kDa molecular scaffold containing several domains required for interaction with numerous proteins. One domain is homologous to Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domains. However, instead of accelerating hydrolysis of bound GTP on Ras IQGAP1, using its GAP-related domain (GRD) binds to Cdc42 and Rac1 and stabilizes their GTP-bound states. We report here the crystal structure of the isolated IQGAP1 GRD. Despite low sequence conservation, the overall structure of the GRD is very similar to the GAP domains from p120 RasGAP, neurofibromin, and SynGAP. However, instead of the catalytic ""arginine finger"" seen in functional Ras GAPs, the GRD has a conserved threonine residue. GRD residues 1099–1129 have no structural equivalent in RasGAP and are seen to form an extension at one end of the molecule. Because the sequence of these residues is highly conserved, this region likely confers a functionality particular to IQGAP family GRDs. We have used isothermal titration calorimetry to demonstrate that the isolated GRD binds to active Cdc42. Assuming a mode of interaction similar to that displayed in the Ras-RasGAP complex, we created an energy-minimized model of Cdc42·GTP bound to the GRD. Residues of the GRD that contact Cdc42 map to the surface of the GRD that displays the highest level of sequence conservation. The model indicates that steric clash between threonine 1046 with the phosphate-binding loop and other subtle changes would likely disrupt the proper geometry required for GTP hydrolysis."

The molecular mechanisms that underlie this phenotype have yet to be elucidated but may be due to indirect effects and the availability of lipid ligands for peroxisome proliferator receptor γ or direct effects on AFABP/aP2 interaction with cellular proteins (9Jenkins-Kruchten A.E.

AFABP/aP2 is a member of the cytoplasmic fatty acid-binding protein multigene family (12Hertzel A.V. Bernlohr D.A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 175-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). FABPs are low molecular mass 15-kDa cytoplasmic proteins that bind fatty acids with high affinity in a 1:1 complex within an interior ligand binding domain (12Hertzel A.V. Bernlohr D.A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 175-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). They function to solubilize and traffic fatty acids throughout the aqueous cellular environment, thereby increasing the diffusion of molecules between cellular compartments. The family members have 20–70% sequence identity yet maintain super-imposable crystal structures and similar fatty acid affinity and specificity. Fatty acid binding leads to defined, but subtle changes in the protein structure including alterations in the side chain of Phe57 and the orientation of the helix-turn-helix domain (including amino acids Asp-Tyr-Met-Lys21) that caps the lipid binding pocket. The divergent sequence among members confers subtle differences in ligand binding properties between the family members but may also define different protein-protein interaction partners depending upon the cellular context. Indeed, it has been shown that the adipocyte, epithelial, and heart type fatty acid-binding proteins interact with hormone-sensitive lipase, whereas the intestinal and liver isoforms do not (9Jenkins-Kruchten A.E.

AFABP/aP2 is highly expressed in adipocytes and macrophages and has a role in lipid metabolism in both cell types.

The complex nature of the biological effects revealed by the knock-out models suggests a role for AFABP/aP2 in cellular processes other than lipid transport. To that end, yeast two-hybrid analysis followed by a combination of studies including titration microcalorimetry, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays have revealed that AFABP/aP2 interacts with a domain on hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) defined by amino acid residues 190–200 containing the core sequence motif EXYK (9Jenkins-Kruchten A.E.

In addition, AFABP/aP2 has a similar sequence in the helix-turn-helix domain, Asp-Tyr-Met-Lys21, that is necessary for the interaction with HSL (10Smith A.J. Sanders M.A. Juhlmann B.E. Hertzel A.V. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 33536-33543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We describe here a novel protein-protein interaction between AFABP/aP2 and JAK2. JAK2 is part of a family of nonreceptor-tyrosine kinases which play a critical role in signal transduction from ligands that bind to members of the cytokine receptor superfamily. Upon ligand binding, one or more of the JAK kinases is activated through transphosphorylation and subsequently phosphorylates the receptor and downstream signaling molecules such as the signal transducers and activators of transcription family or STAT proteins (21Herrington J. Smit L.S. Schwartz J. Carter-Su C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2585-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 22Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). JAK2 has 49 potential tyrosyl phosphorylation sites, at least 10 of which have been identified as phosphorylated, and 2 of these sites (Tyr1007 and Tyr1008) are critical for full activation of JAK2 (23Argetsinger L.S.

Commun. 2004; 325: 586-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In light of this, we have characterized the interaction of JAK2 and AFABP/aP2. Data presented here indicate that the Asp-Tyr-Met-Lys21 region in AFABP/aP2 is critical for this interaction and may represent a common protein-protein interaction domain for FABPs. Materials—Zeocin, Geneticin, Lipofectamine 2000, and tissue culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. Pure oleic acid was from NuChek Prep (Elysian, MN). Antibodies for STAT3 (79D7), phospho-STAT3 Tyr(P)705 (3E2), and JAK2 (D2E12) were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Antibodies for total phosphotyrosine (pY99) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Secondary antibodies, goat anti-mouse IRDye 800CW and goat anti-rabbit IRDye 680, and Blocking Buffer were from Li-cor Biosciences (Lincoln, NE). IL-6 and IL-10 were from PeproTech (Rock Hill, NJ). DNA for pRK5-JAK2 and pRK5-JAK2-Y1007F/Y1008F were kind gifts from Dr. Bruce Witthuhn (University of Minnesota). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The University of Minnesota Microchemical Facility carried out DNA sequencing and synthesis of oligonucleotides used for PCR. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutations in the proposed AFABP/aP2 JAK2 binding site were made in the template of pCDNA3.0-AFABP/aP2 or pRK5-JAK2 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis technique of Stratagene Cloning Systems (La Jolla, CA). The mutational primers were as follows: E1006A JAK2, 5′-c ttg ccg cag gac aaa gca tac tac aaa gta aag gag c-3′; K1009A JAK2, 5′-g gac aaa gaa tac tac gca gta aag gag cca ggg-3′; K1009D JAK2, 5′-g gac aaa gaa tac tac gac gta aag gag cca ggg g-3′; K21A AFABP/aP2, 5′-c ttc gat gat tac atg gca gaa gtg gga gtg ggc ttt gcc-3′; D18K AFABP/aP2, 5′-cc agt gaa aac ttc gat aag tac atg aaa gaa gtg gga gtg ggc-3′. Yeast Two-hybrid—The yeast two-hybrid screening with JAK2 was done as previously described (26Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6633-6644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, pEG202-JAK2 was used as bait with a rat adipose cDNA library as the prey. C8PA Cross-linking—Transient transfection of C8PA cells, HEK-293 cells stably expressing fatty acid transport protein 1 and perilipin A were used and described previously (19Smith A.J. Sanders M.A. Thompson B.R. Londos C. Kraemer F.B. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52399-52405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4 μg of pCDNA3.0-AFABP/aP2, 4 μg of pRK5-JAK2, and 30 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 were used for each 10-cm plate. Transfected plates were fat-loaded 16 h after initial transfection with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum containing 300 μm oleate, 100 μm BSA. Twenty hours after fat loading, cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and cross-linked. Cross-linking was done with 0.5% formaldehyde in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 10 min. The reaction was stopped with 1 ml of 1.25 mm glycine for 5 min. The cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 50 μm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors. The cell suspension was sonicated twice for 10 s at 4 °C. The cell extract was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min to pellet cellular debris. The supernatant was used for subsequent Western blotting and immunoprecipitation experiments. Western Blotting and Co-immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation (IP) of JAK2 was done using rabbit anti-JAK2 antibody at 1:100 overnight at 4 C. Rabbit pre-immune serum was used as the control antibody at the same concentration as the JAK2 antibody, 600 ng/ml. Immunoprecipitations were incubated with protein A-agarose beads, a 12.5-μl bead volume, for 2 h. Beads were washed four times in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and on the last wash transferred to a new tube. Ten μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and 10 μl of loading buffer were used to resuspend the beads, and this mixture was boiled for 20 min. Total immunoprecipitations were loaded on SDS-PAGE gels. Gels were transferred to Immobilon-F polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) and blocked in Li-cor blocking buffer for 1 h. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C in 5% BSA, Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST). After washing in TBST, secondary IRDye antibodies were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 5% BSA in TBST. Blots were washed in TBST and then rinsed and stored in phosphate-buffered saline. Li-Cor Odyssey was used for detection and quantification. For immunoprecipitation, JAK2, AFABP/aP2, and total phosphotyrosine (pY99) were blotted simultaneously on the same membrane. For signaling, peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with the appropriate cytokine for the indicated times and concentrations in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum. AFABP/aP2, STAT3, and Tyr705 phospho-STAT3 were blotted simultaneously on the same membrane. Macrophage—Macrophage cell lines were established by J2 retroviral transformation of bone marrow isolated from wild type and AFABP/aP2-EFABP/mal1 double knock-out mice (27Reynolds J.M. Liu Q.

Immunobiology. 2000; 202: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Expression of mRNAs was measured by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from macrophages using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocol. RNA was treated with DNase I to digest any genomic contamination, and cDNA was synthesized using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). iQ SYBRgreen Supermix and MyiQ detection system (Bio-Rad) were used to monitor amplification. Primers used to amplify and detect mRNA are as follows and were designed using MacVector: SOCS3, forward, 5′-GGGTTCTGCTTTGTCTCTCCTATG-3′, and reverse, 5′-TGGCTGTGTTTGGCTCCTTGTG-3′; IL-6 receptor, forward, 5′-GCGACACTGGGGACTATTTATGC-3′, and reverse, 5′-AAACAGCACAGCCTTCGTGGTTGG-3′. Previous studies using a yeast two-hybrid approach identified AFABP/aP2 as an interaction partner with the HSL (18Shen W.J. Sridhar K. Bernlohr D.A. Kraemer F.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5528-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Using a similar strategy in the course of investigating JAK2-interacting proteins, we identified AFABP/aP2 as an interaction partner (data not shown). To confirm this interaction in endogenous systems, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation experiments. When JAK2 was immunoprecipitated from adipose tissue of C57Bl/6J mice or from differentiated day 8 3T3-L1 adipocytes and then blotted for AFABP/aP2, specific association was detected (Fig. 1). Immunoprecipitation with control antibodies did not reveal any nonspecific complex formation. AFABP/aP2 interacts with a domain on HSL containing the core sequence EHYKRNE199 (17Shen W.J. Liang Y.

Analysis of JAK2 and AFABP/aP2 amino acid sequences revealed a similar sequence present in both proteins (Fig. 2). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis has indicated that Asp18 of AFABP/aP2 likely forms a salt bond with Lys196 of HSL as a key component of the interaction domain (10Smith A.J. Sanders M.A. Juhlmann B.E. Hertzel A.V. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 33536-33543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this context, JAK2 may interact with AFABP/aP2 involving ionic interactions between amino acids of the EXYK domain. Previous studies showed that the interaction of AFABP/aP2 with HSL is fatty acid-dependent (9Jenkins-Kruchten A.E. Bennaars-Eiden A. Ross J.R. Shen W.J. Kraemer F.B. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47636-47643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 20Smith A.J. Thompson B.R. Sanders M.A. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32424-32432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and that the orientation of the side chain of Asp18 is altered upon ligand binding (30LiCata V.J. Bernlohr D.A. Proteins. 1998; 33: 577-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 31Xu Z. Bernlohr D.A. Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7874-7884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Considering that most in vitro protein-protein interaction assays utilize one or more chaotropic agents (e.g. high salts, detergents) to reduce nonspecific interactions and that these agents strip fatty acids from the binding pocket of AFABP/aP2, we cannot use conventional immunoprecipitation analysis to evaluate protein-protein interactions. As such, we adopted a cross-linking protocol analogous to chromatin immunoprecipitation to investigate the AFABP/aP2-JAK2 interactions. To evaluate the AFABP/aP2 interaction with JAK2, we utilized C8PA cells. C8PA cells are HEK-293 cells stably expressing fatty acid transport protein 1 and perilipin A and have the advantage of increased fatty acid uptake and storage and, thus, allow us to probe the JAK2-AFABP/aP2 interaction in an adipocyte-like cell system in the absence of endogenous AFABP/aP2 (19Smith A.J. Sanders M.A. Thompson B.R. Londos C. Kraemer F.B. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52399-52405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cells overexpressing AFABP/aP2 and JAK2 were cross-linked in formaldehyde and lysed, and cell extracts were used for subsequent immunoprecipitation experiments. As shown in Fig. 3, wild type AFABP/aP2 co-immunoprecipitated with JAK2, whereas control IgG does not show any nonspecific interaction. To determine whether the interaction is ligand-dependent, we tested the fatty acid binding mutant R126L/Y128F AFABP/aP2 for interaction with JAK2. In AFABP/aP2, Arg126 and Tyr128 for H-bonds with the fatty acid carboxylate and are required for high affinity lipid association (31Xu Z. Bernlohr D.A. Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7874-7884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Sha R.S. Kane C.D. Xu Z. Banaszak L.J. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7885-7892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows that R126L/Y128F AFABP/aP2 does not associate with JAK2, indicating that ligand binding to AFABP/aP2 is necessary for this interaction. The sequence similarity between HSL and JAK2 suggests that the EXYK domain may be important for the JAK2 interaction. Within JAK2, EYYK1009 is located on the activation loop of the kinase, and phosphorylation of the two tyrosines is critical to full activation (24Feng J. Witthuhn B.A. Matsuda T. Kohlhuber F. Kerr I.M. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2497-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). To test the importance of phosphorylation and activity of JAK2 on the interaction, we mutated both tyrosines to phenylalanine. As expected, Y1007F/Y1008F JAK2 exhibited decreased tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting that JAK2 is less active. As shown in Fig. 3A, AFABP/aP2 co-immunoprecipitates more efficiently with Y1007F/Y1008F JAK2 than with wild type JAK2, suggesting that AFABP/aP2 interacts with JAK2 in the basal, unphosphorylated state. To extend the analysis of the EYYK1009 region, we mutated Glu1006 and Lys1009 of JAK2, individually to alanine residues. Analysis of E1006A and K1009A JAK2 revealed decreased total phosphotyrosine levels, suggesting that these mutations affect JAK2 activity in a similar manner as the Y1007F/Y1008F mutant (Fig. 3B). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments show that E1006A and K1009A JAK2 interact more avidly with AFABP/aP2 than does wild type JAK2. The sum of the mutations in the EYYK1009 region suggests that AFABP/aP2 interacts with JAK2 in the basal state and that the EYYK1009 is central to the interaction. Recent studies have revealed that Asp17, Asp18, Lys21, and Arg30 of AFABP/aP2 found on the helix-turn-helix domain were necessary for the interaction with HSL and that mutation of these residues rendered AFABP/aP2 either unable to interact or attenuated association with HSL (10Smith A.J. Sanders M.A. Juhlmann B.E. Hertzel A.V. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 33536-33543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Importantly, mutations at these sites do not affect the AFABP/aP2 ability to bind fatty acid ligand, functionally separating the ligand binding function of AFABP/aP2 from its protein-protein interaction domains (10Smith A.J. Sanders M.A. Juhlmann B.E. Hertzel A.V. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 33536-33543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Moreover, the loss of HSL association in the D18K AFABP/aP2 mutant can be rescued by corresponding mutation of HSL (K196E). The helix-turn-helix domain also has been shown to undergo main chain and side chain alterations upon ligand binding, suggesting a structural change that coincides with ligand association (31Xu Z. Bernlohr D.A. Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7874-7884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further investigate the helix-turn-helix domain of AFABP/aP2, we performed a charge reversal experiment whereby we mutated Asp18 to Lys in AFABP and Lys1009 to Asp in JAK2. As shown in Fig. 4A, expression of D18K AFABP/aP2 with wild type JAK2 into C8PA cells followed by cross-linking and immunoprecipitation revealed decreased interaction between the two proteins, suggesting that Asp18 and the helix-turn-helix domain of AFABP/aP2 are important for association. Interestingly, K1009D of JAK2 (like K1009A) exhibited decreased total phosphotyrosine of JAK2 and, consistent with the results in Fig. 3B, increased association. When D18K of AFABP/aP2 was co-expressed with K1009D of JAK2, association was returned to basal levels, suggesting that the interaction is ionically based and that the activation loop of JAK2 is the likely site of interaction. However, the site of interaction on AFABP/aP2 with JAK2 is not identical in all respects to the interaction of AFABP/aP2 with HSL. Fig. 4B shows that mutation of Lys21 to Ala (a mutation that blocks AFABP/aP2 interaction with HSL) had no effect on interaction with JAK2. These experiments demonstrate that the requirements for the interaction of AFABP/aP2 with JAK2 clearly overlap but are not identical to those for HSL. Analysis of the phosphorylation-deficient JAK2 mutants, Y1007F/Y1008F, E1006A, K1009A, and K1009D (Fig. 3), indicates that AFABP/aP2 interacts with JAK2 in the basal state. To understand the physiological implications of this interaction, we made use of macrophages from AFABP/aP2-EFABP/mal1 double knock-out (DKO) mice. DKO mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance, and atherosclerosis (15Boord J.B. Maeda K. Makowski L. Babaev V.R. Fazio S. Linton M.F. Hotamisligil G.S.

Interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 signaling has been implicated in atherosclerosis development, and a balance between signaling of these two cytokines is necessary for the prevention of atherosclerosis as IL-6 knock-out models in an apolipoprotein E null background have increased atherosclerosis (33Schieffer B.

https://openalex.org/W2048788153,"Background Regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins have been well-described as accelerators of Gα-mediated GTP hydrolysis (“GTPase-accelerating proteins” or GAPs). However, RGS proteins with complex domain architectures are now known to regulate much more than Gα GTPase activity. RGS14 contains tandem Ras-binding domains that have been reported to bind to Rap- but not Ras GTPases in vitro, leading to the suggestion that RGS14 is a Rap-specific effector. However, more recent data from mammals and Drosophila imply that, in vivo, RGS14 may instead be an effector of Ras. Methodology/Principal Findings Full-length and truncated forms of purified RGS14 protein were found to bind indiscriminately in vitro to both Rap- and Ras-family GTPases, consistent with prior literature reports. In stark contrast, however, we found that in a cellular context RGS14 selectively binds to activated H-Ras and not to Rap isoforms. Co-transfection / co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated the ability of full-length RGS14 to assemble a multiprotein complex with components of the ERK MAPK pathway in a manner dependent on activated H-Ras. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of RGS14 inhibited both nerve growth factor- and basic fibrobast growth factor-mediated neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells, a process which is known to be dependent on Ras-ERK signaling. Conclusions/Significance In cells, RGS14 facilitates the formation of a selective Ras·GTP-Raf-MEK-ERK multiprotein complex to promote sustained ERK activation and regulate H-Ras-dependent neuritogenesis. This cellular function for RGS14 is similar but distinct from that recently described for its closely-related paralogue, RGS12, which shares the tandem Ras-binding domain architecture with RGS14."
https://openalex.org/W2070406305,"A central tenet of molecular biology holds that the function of a protein is mediated by its structure. An inactive ground-state conformation may nonetheless be enjoined by the interplay of competing biological constraints. A model is provided by insulin, well characterized at atomic resolution by x-ray crystallography. Here, we demonstrate that the activity of the hormone is enhanced by stereospecific unfolding of a conserved structural element. A bifunctional beta-strand mediates both self-assembly (within beta-cell storage vesicles) and receptor binding (in the bloodstream). This strand is anchored by an invariant side chain (Phe(B24)); its substitution by Ala leads to an unstable but native-like analog of low activity. Substitution by d-Ala is equally destabilizing, and yet the protein diastereomer exhibits enhanced activity with segmental unfolding of the beta-strand. Corresponding photoactivable derivatives (containing l- or d-para-azido-Phe) cross-link to the insulin receptor with higher d-specific efficiency. Aberrant exposure of hydrophobic surfaces in the analogs is associated with accelerated fibrillation, a form of aggregation-coupled misfolding associated with cellular toxicity. Conservation of Phe(B24), enforced by its dual role in native self-assembly and induced fit, thus highlights the implicit role of misfolding as an evolutionary constraint. Whereas classical crystal structures of insulin depict its storage form, signaling requires engagement of a detachable arm at an extended receptor interface. Because this active conformation resembles an amyloidogenic intermediate, we envisage that induced fit and self-assembly represent complementary molecular adaptations to potential proteotoxicity. The cryptic threat of misfolding poses a universal constraint in the evolution of polypeptide sequences."

IntroductionThe tripeptide glutathione (GSH) 2The abbreviations used are: GSH, reduced glutathione; GPx, glutathione-dependent peroxidase; GRX, glutathione-dependent reductase or glutaredoxin; DHA, dehydroascorbic acid; DHAR, dehydroascorbic acid reductase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HEDS, 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide; Ure2-CTD, Ure2 C-terminal domain (residues 105–354); DTTox, trans-4,5-dihydroxy-1,2-dithiane; TRX, E. coli thioredoxin; yGRX1, yeast glutaredoxin 1; EGST, E. coli GST; DTT, dithiothreitol. is abundant in the cell. It plays an important role as a reducing agent in vivo, such as in endogenous free radical scavenging, reversible protein S-glutathionylation, and the reduction of the active sites of enzymes. One major class of enzyme that uses GSH as a reductant is glutaredoxin (GRX), which is a small protein involved in reduction of ribonucleotide reductase for the formation of deoxyribonucleotides for DNA synthesis (1Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), reduction of 3′-phosphoadenylylsulfate reductase (2Lillig C.H. Potamitou A. Schwenn J.D.

Holmgren A. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2004; 6: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). GRXs are ubiquitous thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases that belong to the thioredoxin superfamily (4Martin J.L. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 245-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). GRXs also show dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) reductase (DHAR) activity (5Wells W.W. Xu D.P. Yang Y.F. Rocque P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15361-15364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has at least seven GRXs, which can be divided into two classes according to the number of cysteines in their active site motif: dithiol GRXs with the active site motif CXXC and monothiol GRXs with the motif CXXS (6Herrero E. de la Torre-Ruiz M.A. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 1518-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 7Lillig C.H. Berndt C. Holmgren A. Biochim. Biophys.

The dithiol GRXs catalyze protein disulfide reduction using a dithiol mechanism for which both the active site cysteines are essential. On the other hand, both the dithiol and monothiol GRXs can catalyze the reduction of GSH-protein mixed disulfides using a monothiol mechanism that only requires the N-terminal active site cysteine. This reaction and mechanism is important for reversible protein glutathionylation in redox signaling and oxidative stress (10Gallogly M.M. Mieyal J.J. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2007; 7: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar).Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a large versatile family of enzymes with multiple functions, particularly associated with cellular detoxification (11Sheehan D. Meade G. Foley V.M. Dowd C.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar). In terms of overall structure, they belong to the thioredoxin superfamily, like GRX (4Martin J.L. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 245-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). In general, GSTs catalyze the conjugation of reduced GSH to hydrophobic substrates containing an electrophilic atom. In addition, GSTs bind a broad spectrum of ligands and show many other functions. For example, some GSTs show overlapping functions with glutathione-dependent peroxidases (GPxs), which use GSH to reduce hydrogen peroxide and/or organic hydroperoxides and thus are responsible for protection against both endogenous and exogenous oxidant toxicity (11Sheehan D. Meade G. Foley V.M. Dowd C.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar). Interestingly Omega class and Beta class GSTs (such as Escherichia coli GST (EGST)) possess typical GRX activity toward widely used substrates, such as 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide (HEDS) (12Board P.G.

These GSTs have an active site cysteine, which is indispensable for GRX activity but not GST activity.The yeast prion protein Ure2 is composed of a disordered protease-sensitive N-terminal prion domain and a compact globular C-terminal domain, which shows high structural similarity to EGST (17Bousset L. Belrhali H. Janin J. Melki R. Morera S. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 39-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of Ure2 can be further structurally divided into two subdomains, the all-α-helix subdomain and the thioredoxin fold subdomain, which shows high structural homology to GRX. Ure2 is involved in the regulation of nitrogen metabolism and resistance to heavy metal ion toxicity (especially cadmium) and oxidative stress in S. cerevisiae (18Rai R. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12826-12833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Rai R. Cooper T.G. Yeast. 2005; 22: 343-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, Ure2 shows GPx activity toward both hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides such as cumene hydroperoxide and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (20Bai M. Zhou J.M. Perrett S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50025-50030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The discovery of the GPx activity of Ure2 (20Bai M. Zhou J.M. Perrett S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50025-50030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) provides an explanation for its ability to protect yeast cells from oxidant toxicity (18Rai R. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12826-12833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the reason that ure2Δ yeast cells are hypersensitive to cadmium remains unclear. In general, cadmium ions have a drastic effect on yeast cell growth, and the reasons are complicated. One possible reason for cadmium ion toxicity is that thioltransferases or GRXs can be inhibited by direct binding of cadmium to the two essential cysteine residues present in the thioltransferase active site (21Chrestensen C.A. Starke D.W. Mieyal J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26556-26565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The inhibition of GRXs leads to complex effects on cell growth. Therefore, we used an in vitro assay to provide a system that allows detailed analysis of the activity of Ure2 and its relationship to that of GRX enzymes. Characterization of the allosteric behavior of the GRX activity of Ure2 revealed that Ure2 forms an active dimer within fibrils. In addition to providing information about the molecular structure of Ure2 fibrils, this also has implications for the molecular mechanism of Ure2 prion formation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification—Ure2 and mutants (42Ure2, 90Ure2, or Ure2-CTD with and without point mutations) were produced in E. coli with an N-terminal His6 tag and purified by nickel chromatography as described previously (22Perrett S. Freeman S.J. Butler P.J. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 331-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 23Zhang Z.R. Bai M. Wang X.Y. Zhou J.M. Perrett S. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 384: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 42Ure2 and 90Ure2 lack the N-terminal 1–41 and 1–89 residues, respectively. Ure2-CTD lacks the entire N-terminal unstructured region (residues 1–104) and contains only the C-terminal domain of Ure2 (residues 105–354). Each protein was judged by SDS-PAGE to be at least 98% pure and was stored at –80 °C. All proteins were defrosted in a 25 °C water bath immediately prior to use. The concentration of the protein was determined by the absorbance at 280 nm using a calculated extinction coefficient of 48,200 m–1 cm–1 (22Perrett S. Freeman S.J. Butler P.J. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 331-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 24Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5022) Google Scholar), and all protein concentrations are expressed in terms of monomer. EGST (16Wang X.Y. Zhang Z.R. Perrett S. Biochem. J. 2009; 417: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), S. cerevisiae yeast GRX1 (yGRX1) (25Yu J. Zhang N.N. Yin P.D. Cui P.X. Zhou C.Z. Proteins. 2008; 72: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and E. coli thioredoxin (TRX) (26Zhao Z. Peng Y. Hao S.F. Zeng Z.H. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43292-43298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) were expressed and purified as described previously.Hydrogen Peroxide Treatment of yGRX1 and Ure2—Typically 300 μm yGRX1 or 80 μm Ure2-CTD was incubated with ∼10 mm H2O2 at 4 °C for 2 h. The incubation mixture was then dialyzed thoroughly against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4. The number of free thiol groups in each molecule of yGRX1 was determined using 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) as described previously (27Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21069) Google Scholar).Assay of GRX Activity—GSH-dependent disulfide reductase activity of Ure2 and its mutants was measured at 25 °C using GSH and HEDS as substrates in a spectrometric coupled assay as described previously (28Holmgren A. Aslund F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Typically a 1-ml reaction volume in a cuvette containing 100 mm Tris-HCl or sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 0.2–5 mm GSH, 0.2–5 mm HEDS or 5 mm trans-4,5-dihydroxy-1,2-dithiane (DTTox), 0.25–0.8 units/ml glutathione reductase, 0.2 mm NADPH, and 1 mm EDTA was preincubated at 25 °C for 2 min. The enzyme was then added to the cuvette to trigger the reaction. (The final enzyme concentration was 0.1–1.0 μm when using HEDS as a substrate and 4.0–7.0 μm when using DTTox as a substrate.) The activity was measured from the continuous decrease of NADPH absorption at 340 nm for 3 min. All initial velocities were corrected by subtraction of the non-enzymatic reaction measured using an equivalent volume of buffer in place of the protein solution.To examine the effect of substrate concentration, the initial velocity was measured over a wide range of concentrations of one substrate and a fixed concentration of the other substrate. When the concentration of GSH was fixed, the data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten and Lineweaver-Burk equations. Values obtained from these plots were the same within experimental error. When the concentration of HEDS was fixed, the kinetic behavior of Ure2 and its mutants followed a sigmoidal curve. Therefore, the data were fitted to the Hill equations (Equations 1 and 2) describing the kinetic behavior of an allosteric enzyme, v=Vmax1+([GSH]0.5[GSH])nH(Eq. 1) logY1−Y=nH⋅log[GSH]−logK′(Eq. 2) where nH is the Hill coefficient and Y is the ratio of the initial rate to the maximum rate. The nH values obtained from fitting to the two equations were the same within error. The steadystate kinetic mechanism for Ure2-CTD was determined from a family of double reciprocal plots, which was obtained by varying both HEDS and GSH concentrations.Assay of Dehydroascorbic Acid Reductase Activity—GSH-dependent dehydroascorbic acid reductase activity was determined as described previously (29Wells W.W. Xu D.P. Washburn M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly a 1-ml reaction volume in a cuvette containing 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 1 mm GSH, 1 mm DHA, 0.4 units/ml glutathione reductase, 0.2 mm NADPH, 1 mm EDTA, and 4–5 μm Ure2 protein or mutants was incubated at 25 °C. The decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was recorded spectrophotometrically. DHAR activity was measured after subtracting the spontaneous reaction rate between DHA and GSH in the absence of Ure2. DHA was used within 2 h of preparation.Turbidimetric Assay of Insulin Disulfide Reductase Activity—The reduction of insulin by Ure2 was assayed by monitoring turbidity as described previously (30Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly a 0.5-ml cuvette containing 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 1 μm enzyme, 1 mm EDTA, and reductant (0.8 mm DTT or 8 mm GSH) was incubated at 25 °C. Then 80 μm bovine insulin was added to start the reaction. Increasing turbidity from the precipitation of the insulin B chain was monitored by the absorbance at 650 nm. TRX and yGRX1 were used as controls. The nonenzymatic reduction of insulin by DTT or GSH was also monitored.GRX Activity within Amyloid-like Fibrils of Ure2—Assay of GRX activity during the time course of Ure2 fibril formation was performed essentially in the same way as for GPx activity (20Bai M. Zhou J.M. Perrett S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50025-50030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly the 50-μl total reaction mixture (30 μm Ure2 in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.4, and 0.2 m NaCl), 50-μl supernatant, and 50-μl resuspended pellet were assayed with 1.5 mm GSH, 3 mm HEDS, 0.25 units/ml glutathione reductase, and 0.2 mm NADPH in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA at 25 °C.Once the plateau phase of the time course of Ure2 fibril formation had been reached, the total reaction mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min after which the pellet was resuspended using the same volume of distilled deionized water and stored at 4 °C. The resuspended pellet was visualized using electron microscopy. Aliquots of resuspended pellet were assayed with 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 0.1–5 mm GSH when the HEDS concentration was fixed at 3 mm, and 0.3–5 mm HEDS when the GSH concentration was fixed at 1 mm at 25 °C.Steady-state Kinetic Analysis of the GRX Activity of Ure2, Its Prion Domain Mutants, and Its Fibrils—Given the relatively low affinity of Ure2 for GSH (20Bai M. Zhou J.M. Perrett S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50025-50030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 23Zhang Z.R. Bai M. Wang X.Y. Zhou J.M. Perrett S. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 384: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 31Bousset L. Belrhali H. Melki R. Morera S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13564-13573Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), it is therefore reasonable to assume that rapid equilibrium conditions apply to this reaction. Given this condition and the fact that the crystal structure of Ure2 shows that there is only one binding site for GSH within each Ure2 monomer (31Bousset L. Belrhali H. Melki R. Morera S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13564-13573Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we can therefore apply the graphical method of Wang and Srivastava (32Wang Z.X. Srivastava D.K. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) to determine the number of essential sites within the Ure2 homodimer in solution and also the number of active sites in each catalytic unit within fibrils of Ure2. The data were analyzed according to this method (32Wang Z.X. Srivastava D.K. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) as follows. The initial velocity for an enzyme bearing n binding sites for the substrate GSH of which k sites are essential for catalytic activity is given as Equation 3. v=Bk[GSH]k+Bk+1[GSH]k+1+⋯+Bn[GSH]nA0+A1[GSH]1+A2[GSH]2+⋯+An[GSH]n(Eq. 3) Ai and Bi are constants if the change in reactant concentration is negligible (i.e. less than 5%) as is the case here. Ai[GSH]i in the denominator is related to the total enzyme species bound to i GSH molecules, and Bi[GSH]i in the numerator is associated with functional enzyme species bound to i GSH molecules. If 1/[GSH] = x, Equation 3 can be rearranged to give Equation 4. 1v=A0xn+A1xn−1+⋯+An−1x+AnBkxn−k+Bk+1xn−k−1+⋯+Bn−1x+Bn(Eq. 4) After multiplying both sides by 1/xp or [GSH]p (where p is an integer 0, 1, 2, 3,...), Equation 4 can be further rearranged to Equation 5, the limits of which are described by Equation 6. [GSH]pv=1vxp=f(x)=A0xn+A1xn−1+⋯+An−1x+AnBkxn−k+p+⋯+Bn−1xp+1+Bnxp(Eq. 5) limx→∞f(x)={∞,p<kA0/Bk,p=k0,p>k(Eq. 6) By plotting [GSH]p/v0 versus 1/[GSH] at different values of p (0, 1, 2, 3,... etc.), the appearance of a horizontal asymptote therefore identifies the condition where p = k (i.e. the number of essential binding sites in the catalytic unit) and the appearance of a zero asymptote for p = k + 1 confirms the validity of the result. In this case we found that k = 2 for both soluble dimer and fibrils of Ure2 (see “Results”). Given the presence of one GSH binding site per subunit (17Bousset L. Belrhali H. Janin J. Melki R. Morera S. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 39-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 31Bousset L. Belrhali H. Melki R. Morera S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13564-13573Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), this means that n = 2 for the soluble dimer. For the fibrils, given that k = 2 and the Hill coefficient approaches 2, then n must be ≥2. When n = 2 and k = 2, Equation 3 becomes Equation 7. v=B2[GSH]2A0+A1[GSH]+[GSH]2(Eq. 7) The initial velocity data were fit to Equation 7 to obtain the parameters Ai and Bi, which were then used to calculate the theoretical curves according to Equation 5 at different p values (p = 0, 1, 2, 3,...). We also attempted to fit the fibril data using values of n > 2, including 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, but no reasonable fit could be obtained, whereas using n = 2 gave excellent agreement between the experimental data and theoretical curves (see “Results”). This implies that the functional catalytic unit within fibrils is indeed a dimer rather than a higher order oligomer.RESULTSUre2 Shows GRX Activity—The ability of Ure2 and its mutants to reduce the disulfide of HEDS was monitored by recording the continuous decrease in absorbance at 340 nm due to the oxidization of NADPH by the product GSSG (oxidized glutathione) under steady-state conditions. When Ure2 protein was added to the cuvette containing preincubated GSH and HEDS, a significant decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was observed. This indicates that Ure2 has GSH-dependent disulfide reductase activity toward the disulfide substrate HEDS (Fig. 1). The initial velocity for reaction of HEDS was found to be proportional to the concentration of Ure2 protein. The effect of the prion domain on the GRX activity of Ure2 was examined by comparing a series of mutants with increasing truncation in the prion domain. The truncated mutants 42Ure2, 90Ure2, and Ure2-CTD showed increasing levels of enzyme activity correlating with the increasing extent of the truncation of the prion domain (Fig. 1).Effect of Hydrogen Peroxide and Cadmium Chloride on the GRX Activity of Yeast GRX1 and Ure2—It is reported that Ure2 protects yeast cells from oxidant and heavy metal ion toxicity, such as against hydrogen peroxide and cadmium (18Rai R. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12826-12833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We therefore measured the effect of hydrogen peroxide and cadmium on the enzyme activity of yGRX1 and Ure2.After H2O2 treatment (and subsequent removal of residual H2O2; see “Experimental Procedures”), the GRX activity of yGRX1 decreased significantly, whereas Ure2 retained the same level of activity (Fig. 2A). The number of free thiol groups determined using 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (see “Experimental Procedures”) was 1.8 per yGRX1 molecule before H2O2 treatment and 0.0 after treatment. (Ure2 contains no free thiol groups.) The sensitivity of yGRX1 to H2O2 treatment is consistent with the fact that yGRX1 has two active site cysteines, which become oxidized after treatment with H2O2, whereas Ure2 has no cysteine residues and remains fully active after treatment with H2O2.FIGURE 2Effect of oxidation and cadmium ions on the GRX activity of yGRX1 and Ure2. The GRX activity of yGRX1 (filled bars) and Ure2-CTD (empty bars) are shown. The GRX activity determined before hydrogen peroxide treatment or in the absence of cadmium ions was set as 100% for each protein (shown as “Control”). The reaction conditions were as described in the legend to Fig. 1 unless otherwise indicated. The concentration of yGRX1 was 0.1 μm. The error bars shown represent the S.E. of at least three independent measurements. A, effect of treatment with 10 mm hydrogen peroxide prior to assay of GRX activity. The concentration of Ure2-CTD was 0.5 μm. B, effect of the presence of 10 μm cadmium chloride on GRX activity. The concentration of HEDS was 2 mm, and the concentration of Ure2-CTD was 0.4 μm. In the presence of cadmium ions, 10 units/ml glutathione reductase was used.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To measure the effects of cadmium ions, we had to make an adjustment to the coupled assay system: because the activity of glutathione reductase (which is part of the coupled enzyme assay system) can also be inhibited up to 5-fold by 10 μm cadmium chloride (data not shown), we used 5–10-fold more glutathione reductase in the assay in the presence of 10 μm cadmium chloride under which conditions the total glutathione reductase activity was at least as high as in the conditions without cadmium. As reported for human GRX previously (21Chrestensen C.A. Starke D.W. Mieyal J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26556-26565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), the activity of yGRX1 was impaired by cadmium (Fig. 2B). Interestingly Ure2 shows slightly higher sensitivity to cadmium than yGRX1. A possible reason is that binding of metal ions within the Ure2 active site may inhibit catalysis. These results indicate that Ure2 may play a complementary or backup role to yGRX1 in protection of yeast cells against oxidant and heavy metal toxicity.Comparison of GRX Activity of Ure2 and Its Mutants—The observation of disulfide reductase or thioltransferase activity for a protein without any cysteine residues is extremely unexpected. Therefore, to investigate the catalytic mechanism, we examined the thioltransferase activity of active site mutants of Ure2. Given the higher activity of Ure2 when the N-terminal 104 residues are truncated (Ure2-CTD; Fig. 1), we used the active site mutants of Ure2-CTD here. The widely used substrate HEDS as well as DTTox were adopted as substrates. The bacterial thioltransferase EGST (16Wang X.Y. Zhang Z.R. Perrett S. Biochem. J. 2009; 417: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), which contains one active cysteine, was used as a positive control. Interestingly Ure2 mutants N124A and N124V showed negligible activity with either substrate, indicating the importance of Asn-124 for GRX activity (Fig. 3, A and B). A122S showed lower activity than Ure2-CTD toward both HEDS and DTTox, suggesting impairment of the active site by the introduction of a hydroxyl group to the side chain of residue 122. However, the level of GRX activity toward HEDS for A122C was even lower than A122S, whereas A122C showed similar or even higher activity than Ure2-CTD toward DTTox. This may be because the cysteine in A122C can be covalently modified by the disulfide substrate HEDS, whereas DTTox, an extremely weak oxidant, cannot oxidize free thiols.FIGURE 3Comparison of GSH-dependent disulfide reductase activity for Ure2 and mutants. Each protein contains only the C-terminal domain of Ure2 (Ure2-CTD) with or without point mutations (as indicated). The reaction conditions were 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at 25 °C. The error bars shown represent the S.E. of at least three independent measurements. A, GRX activity assayed with 1 mm GSH and 5 mm HEDS. The structure of HEDS is shown. The activity of EGST is shown as a control. B, GRX activity assayed with 5 mm GSH and 5 mm DTTox. The structure of DTTox is shown. EGST and bovine serum albumin (BSA) are shown as controls.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Steady-state Kinetic Analysis of Ure2 and Its Mutants—To further investigate the GRX activity of Ure2, we obtained apparent steady-state kinetic parameters for the enzymatic reaction. The results for the GRX activity of Ure2 and its mutants toward HEDS and GSH are shown in Fig. 4 and Table 1. When the GSH concentration was fixed at 1.0 mm, GRX activity was hyperbolic over a certain range of HEDS concentrations (Fig. 4A). However, at HEDS concentrations greater than 3 mm, inhibition of GRX activity was observed. When the HEDS concentration was fixed at 3.0 mm, GRX activity was sigmoidal with respect to GSH concentration (Fig. 4B). The sigmoidal kinetic behavior toward GSH remained when the HEDS concentration was varied from 0.3 to 3.0 mm, and the shape of the sigmoidal curve was independent of the Ure2 concentration (data not shown). In general, the observation of a sigmoidal curve for the GRX activity of Ure2 means that it shows positive cooperativity toward the binding of GSH, indicating that there is an allosteric interaction between the two GSH binding sites within the dimer. The Hill coefficients (nH) are shown in Table 1. All four soluble proteins show a similar nH value of around 2, consistent with the presence of two active sites within the Ure2 homodimer and indicating a high degree of cooperativity. The binding of GSH to the G-site in one of the subunits of the Ure2 dimer may result in a change in overall dimer conformation and thus may help the subsequent binding of GSH to the G-site in the other subunit of the dimer. The positive cooperative behavior of Ure2 GRX activity toward the substrate GSH is consistent with the behavior of yeast Omega GST (15Garcera A. Barreto L. Piedrafita L. Tamarit J. Herrero E.

https://openalex.org/W2007322452,"Measles is a highly contagious childhood disease associated with an immunological paradox: although a strong virus-specific immune response results in virus clearance and the establishment of a life-long immunity, measles infection is followed by an acute and profound immunosuppression leading to an increased susceptibility to secondary infections and high infant mortality. In certain cases, measles is followed by fatal neurological complications. To elucidate measles immunopathology, we have analyzed the immune response to measles virus in mice transgenic for the measles virus receptor, human CD150. These animals are highly susceptible to intranasal infection with wild-type measles strains. Similarly to what has been observed in children with measles, infection of suckling transgenic mice leads to a robust activation of both T and B lymphocytes, generation of virus-specific cytotoxic T cells and antibody responses. Interestingly, Foxp3+CD25+CD4+ regulatory T cells are highly enriched following infection, both in the periphery and in the brain, where the virus intensively replicates. Although specific anti-viral responses develop in spite of increased frequency of regulatory T cells, the capability of T lymphocytes to respond to virus-unrelated antigens was strongly suppressed. Infected adult CD150 transgenic mice crossed in an interferon receptor type I-deficient background develop generalized immunosuppression with an increased frequency of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells and strong reduction of the hypersensitivity response. These results show that measles virus affects regulatory T-cell homeostasis and suggest that an interplay between virus-specific effector responses and regulatory T cells plays an important role in measles immunopathogenesis. A better understanding of the balance between measles-induced effector and regulatory T cells, both in the periphery and in the brain, may be of critical importance in the design of novel approaches for the prevention and treatment of measles pathology."
https://openalex.org/W1983960401,"Although the human genome project has been completed for some time, the issue of the number of transcribed genes with identifiable biological functions remains unresolved. We used zebrafish as a model organism to study the functions of Ka/Ks-predicted novel human exons, which were identified from a comparative evolutionary genomics analysis. In this study, a novel gene, designated as puf-A, was cloned and functionally characterized, and its homologs in zebrafish, mouse, and human were identified as one of the three homolog clusters which were consisted of 14 related proteins with Puf repeats. Computer modeling of human Puf-A structure and a pull-down assay for interactions with RNA targets predicted that it was a RNA-binding protein. Specifically, Puf-A contained a special six Puf-repeat domain, which constituted a unique superhelix half doughnut-shaped Puf domain with a topology similar to, but different from the conventional eight-repeat Pumilio domain. Puf-A transcripts were uniformly distributed in early embryos, but became restricted primarily to eyes and ovaries at a later stage of development. In mice, puf-A expression was detected primarily in retinal ganglion and pigmented cells. Knockdown of puf-A in zebrafish embryos resulted in microphthalmia, a small head, and abnormal primordial germ-cell (PGC) migration. The latter was confirmed by microinjecting into embryos puf-A siRNA containing nanos 3′ UTR that expressed in PGC only. The importance of Puf-A in the maturation of germline stem cells was also implicated by its unique expression in the most primitive follicles (stage I) in adult ovaries, followed by a sharp decline of expression in later stages of folliculogenesis. Taken together, our study shows that puf-A plays an important role not only in eye development, but also in PGC migration and the specification of germ cell lineage. These studies represent an exemplary implementation of a unique platform to uncover unknown function(s) of human genes and their roles in development regulation."

This possibility was first introduced based on the observation that MCM2-7 proteins are highly abundant in the cell and that the amount of these proteins exceeds the number of replication origins in yeast (1Donovan S.

Members of the MCM2-7 family have been shown to interact with components of the transcription machinery including RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and some transcription factors. Our previous studies showed that the MCM2-7 proteins are recruited by Stat1 for transcription activation in response to IFN-γ and that MCM5 is essential for Stat1-mediated transcription (20Zhang J.J.

The MCM2-7 proteins interact with the promoters of Stat1 target genes in response to IFN-γ, and they move along these genes with RNA Pol II during transcription (22Snyder M. He W. Zhang J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14539-14544Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), similar to their ability to move along with the DNA replication fork (8Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M.

RNA interference techniques were utilized to knock down MCM2 and MCM5 followed by tritiated uridine incorporation assay and nuclear run-on assays to show that they are required for RNA Pol II-mediated transcription. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, we demonstrate that members of the MCM2-7 proteins are present on the chromatins of constitutively transcribing genes along with RNA Pol II and that MCM5 is required for transcription elongation of RNA Pol II. Furthermore, using MCM5 mutants that are specifically deficient in the formation of MCM2-7 hexamer complex or DNA helicase domain, we demonstrate that the integrity of the MCM2-7 hexamer complex and the helicase domain of MCM5 are essential for the process of transcription.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Antibodies—2fTGH cells (I.

Primers for the ChIP assay were as follows: center of the GAPDH gene, 5′-GTATTCCCCCAGGTTTACAT-3′ and 5′-TTCTGTCTTCCACTCACTCC-3′; 5′ region of GAPDH, 5′-TCGTGTTCCCTAATCCCATC-3′ and 5′-ATAGCTCACGCCCTCTGC-3′; center of the E2F4 gene, 5′-AGATACCCTCTTGGCCATCC-3′ and 5′-GGATGCCCATCCTCCTAGAT-3′; center of the β-actin gene, 5′-AAGATGACCCAGGTGAGTGG-3′ and 5′-CCTGCAGAGTTCCAAAGGAG-3′; center of the β-tubulin gene, 5′-CTGGACCGCATCTCTGTGTA-3′ and 5′-GTTCACGAAAGGGGACAAAA-3′; 5′ region of β-actin, 5′-GTCTCTTGGCCAGCTGAATG-3′ and 5′-TCTTGCTGCCTGTTGATGAG-3′; 5′ region of EF4, 5′-TGCTAGACTTGGCCTCAACC-3′ and 5′-ACCACACCCCTCTTCACAAG-3′; 5′ region of β-tubulin, 5′-TCAAAACAATGGCTCGAAAA-3′ and 5′-AGCGAAAAATGGGGAGAAGT-3′; and GAPDH promoter region, 5′-ACGTAGCTCAGGCCTCAAGA-3′ and 5′-AAGAAGATGCGGCTGACTGT-3′.RNAi—RNAi knockdown of MCM2 and MCM5 were performed with the RNAi human/mouse control kit from Qiagen. Two sets of MCM5 siRNAs were described previously (22Snyder M. He W. Zhang J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14539-14544Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and MCM2 were from Qiagen (catalog number SI02653525). 293T cells were transfected with 0.25 μg of each MCM5 siRNA or 0.5 μg of MCM2 or negative control siRNA according to the manufacturer's instructions.Tritium Incorporation Assay—Transcription efficiency was measured by tritium incorporation as described previously (26Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 18.7.14-18.7.15Google Scholar). A total of 1 × 106 cells were treated with 50 μm [5,6-H-3]uridine 40–50 Ci/mmol for 0, 20, and 120 min. Cells were washed once with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 500 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid. Precipitated nucleotides were collected with glass microfiber filters, and counts per minute (cpm) were determined using a scintillation counter.Nuclear Run-on Assay—A total of 1 × 106 cells were suspended in 4 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCL, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and incubated on ice for 5 min. Cells were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Cells were again resuspended in 4 ml of lysis buffer and centrifuged. Cells were then resuspended in 200 μl of storage buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 40% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA) and added to 200 μl of reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.3 m KCl with 10 μl each of 100 mm ATP, CTP, GTP, 5 μl of 1 m dithiothreitol, 10 μl of [α-32P]UTP). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and RNA was resuspended in 500 μl of diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) treated water. RNA was incubated at 65 °C for 10 min and incubated with slot-blot membranes in 25 ml of Church's buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 0.5 m NaHPO4, 0.5 m NaH2PO4, 0.001 m EDTA, 7% SDS) at 65 °C overnight. Membranes contained 5 μg of the indicated plasmids and poly(A) RNA. Poly(A) RNA was isolated with the Promega poly(A) tract kit.PI Staining and FACS—Cells were cultured as described in 10-cm dishes to 80–90% confluence and stained with PI (10 μg/ml PI in 38 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0) as described previously (27Crissman H.A. Steinkamp J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 59: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Cells were analyzed using FACSCalibur and CellQuest analysis software.Transfections—Transient transfections of 293T cells were performed with the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen).Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed with the indicated antibodies on whole cell extracts separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Plasmids—The plasmids pMCM5WT, pMCM5KMD, and pMCM5RK were constructed as described previously (21DaFonseca C.J. Shu F. Zhang J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3034-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The plasmid pMCM5WT contains the wild-type hemagglutinin A (HA)-tagged MCM5 gene. The plasmid pMCM5KMD contains mutations in the ATP-binding site domain and the conserved helicase domain of MCM5 (described as KMDA4 in Ref. 21DaFonseca C.J. Shu F. Zhang J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3034-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The pMCM5RK construct contains mutations at residues Arg-732 and Lys-734 (described as R732D/K734D in Ref. 21DaFonseca C.J. Shu F. Zhang J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3034-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). All MCM5 constructs were subcloned into RcCMV (Invitrogen) as described previously (21DaFonseca C.J. Shu F. Zhang J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3034-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).RESULTSMCM5 and MCM2 Are Required for General Transcription—To determine whether MCM5 plays a role in general transcription, we utilized the RNAi knockdown technique that we have used in previous studies of Stat1 (22Snyder M. He W. Zhang J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14539-14544Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) to significantly reduce the amount of MCM5 in the cell but not eliminate it completely. 293T cells were transfected with a negative control siRNA or MCM5 siRNA for 4 days. Transfection with the MCM5 siRNA in 293T cells greatly reduced the level of MCM5 when compared with untransfected cells or those transfected with a negative control siRNA (Fig. 1A). MCM3 levels were unaffected by either siRNA; Stat1 and Stat3 are shown as loading controls (Fig. 1A). Cells containing the MCM5 siRNA, a negative control siRNA, and untransfected cells were analyzed by tritium incorporation assay for general transcription activity. Four days after siRNA transfection, tritiated uridine was added to the medium for 5, 20, and 120 min, and its incorporation into RNA was measured. There was an ∼50% decrease in tritium incorporation for the cells transfected with MCM5 siRNA when compared with untransfected cells or cells with the control siRNA (Fig. 1B).To test whether other members of the MCM2-7 hexamer complex are necessary for general transcription, we analyzed the effect of knockdown of MCM2 on transcription because MCM2 was co-purified with the RNA Pol II holoenzyme and has been shown to specifically interact with the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA Pol II (23Yankulov K. Todorov I. Romanowski P. Licatalosi D. Cilli K. McCracken S. Laskey R. Bentley D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6154-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 24Holland L. Gauthier L. Bell-Rogers P. Yankulov K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5192-5202Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). 293T cells were transiently transfected with an siRNA against MCM2 or a control siRNA. The MCM2 siRNA efficiently decreased levels of MCM2 protein when compared with untransfected (293T) cells and cells with a control siRNA (Fig. 1C, lane 3). The cellular levels of MCM5 and Stat3 were not significantly affected (Fig. 1C). Transcriptional activities in these cells were measured by incorporation of tritiated uridine. There was >50% decrease in tritium incorporation in cells containing the MCM2 siRNA when compared with untransfected cells (293T) and cells with negative control siRNA cells (Fig. 1D). All together, these results suggest that the MCM2-7 family plays an important role for transcription.To ensure that the loss of transcription activity in the MCM5 knockdown cells is not due to cell death or cell cycle arrest, the cells were stained with PI and analyzed by FACS. Cells were growing normally and looked healthy at day four after siRNA transfection (data not shown), and FACS analyses of PI-stained cells showed that there was only a slight change in the distribution of cell population in the different phases of the cell cycle when compared with untransfected cells and cells transfected with a control siRNA (Fig. 2). These results indicate that a decrease in MCM5 protein levels resulted in a loss of general transcription activity and that the observed effect on transcription is not due to a disruption in DNA replication.FIGURE 2Cell cycle analyses of cells with MCM5 knockdown by siRNA. 293T cells were transfected as described in the legend for Fig. 1. Cells were cultured for 4 days, and 1 × 106 cells were stained with propidium iodide (PI) and analyzed by FACs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)MCM5 Is Essential for RNA Pol II-mediated Transcription—The results obtained using tritiated uridine incorporation experiments suggest that MCM2 and MCM5 are required for general transcription. This assay does not distinguish RNA Pol II function from that of RNA Pol I and Pol III. To further demonstrate that MCM5 plays a role in RNA Pol II-dependent transcription and has a direct impact on transcription rate, nuclear run-on assays were performed on RNA Pol II genes. Plasmid DNA encoding RNA Pol II-dependent and constitutively expressed genes GAPDH, MCM5, MCM3, Stat1, Stat6, CREB-binding protein (CBP), and purified poly(A) mRNA were used to measure the mRNA transcription rate (Fig. 3). In cells transfected with the MCM5 siRNA, transcription for all these genes and the poly(A) mRNA was decreased when compared with the cells transfected with the control siRNA (Fig. 3, A and B). The IRF1 gene was used as a negative control because it is not constitutively expressed. Two plasmid vectors were also used as negative controls, and no signals were detected on these controls. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the MCM5 protein is required for RNA Pol II-dependent transcription of constitutively expressed genes.FIGURE 3MCM5 is essential for RNA Pol II-mediated transcription. A, 293T cells transfected as in Fig. 1A were grown for 4 days, scraped, and washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Nuclear run-on assays were performed with slot-blot membranes containing 5 μg of plasmid DNA or poly(A) RNA. CBP, CREB-binding protein. B, results from A were quantitated with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Results represent one of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Members of the MCM2-7 Complex Specifically Co-localize with RNA Pol II in the Centers of Constitutively Transcribed Genes—We have previously demonstrated that members of the MCM2-7 family bound to the promoters of Stat1 target genes in response to IFN-γ and further move along with RNA Pol II for ligand-induced transcription (22Snyder M. He W. Zhang J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14539-14544Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To further analyze the role of the MCM2-7 proteins for RNA Pol II-dependent transcription of constitutively expressed genes, we used ChIP assays to determine whether the MCM2-7 complex interacts with constitutively transcribed genes on the chromosome. Using PCR primers specific for the center or the 5′ intergenic region of the GAPDH gene (Fig. 4A), ChIP assays were performed with antibodies against MCM3, MCM5, and RNA Pol II. Both MCM3 and MCM5 were present at high levels in the center of the GAPDH gene (Fig. 4, B, lanes 2 and 4, and C) but at very low levels in the 5′ intergenic region (Fig. 4, B, lanes 1 and 3, and C). RNA Pol II was also present in the center of the GAPDH gene (Fig. 4, B, lane 6, and C), and a low level of RNA Pol II was also detected in the 5′ intergenic region (Fig. 4, B, lane 5, and C). These data demonstrate that there is a specific co-localization of MCM3 and MCM5 with RNA Pol II in the center of a constitutively transcribing gene on the chromosome.FIGURE 4Members of the MCM2-7 family co-localize with RNA Pol II at the loci of constitutively transcribed genes. A, map of the GAPDH gene and primers used for ChIP analysis against the 5′ region and the center (C) of the gene. B and C, 2fTGH cells were grown in 15-cm dishes to about 80–90% confluence. ChIP assays were performed using anti-MCM3, anti-MCM5, and anti-RNA Pol II antibodies. PCR reactions used primers against the 5′ region or the center of the GAPDH gene. C, results were quantitated using a PhosphorImager and expressed as ChIP/Input. D, ChIP assays were performed for 2fTGH cells with anti-Stat1, anti-MCM2, anti-MCM3, anti-MCM5, and anti-RNA Pol II antibodies. One 15-cm dish was used for the Stat1, MCM2, and MCM3 ChIP (lanes 1–3), and a second dish was used for the MCM5, RNA Pol II (lanes 4 and 5), and Stat1 ChIP. The result of one Stat1 IP (lane 1) is shown. Input A (lane 6) corresponds to the Stat1, MCM2, and MCM3 ChIP (lanes 1–3), and Input B (lane 7) corresponds to Mcm5 and RNA Pol II (lanes 4 and 5). Primers correspond to the centers of the β-actin, E2F4, and β-tubulin genes. E, signals in D were quantitated with a PhosphorImager, and values are expressed as ChIP/Input. Results represent at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further demonstrate that the MCM2-7 complex interacts with other constitutively expressed genes in addition to GAPDH, ChIP assays were performed with antibodies against MCM2, MCM3, MCM5, and RNA Pol II, and primers were designed for the centers of the β-actin, E2F4, and β-tubulin genes. Stat1 was used as a negative control because it does not interact with constitutively expressed genes and only interacts with the promoters of specific target genes in response to IFN-γ stimulation (22Snyder M. He W. Zhang J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14539-14544Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). MCM2, MCM3, MCM5, and RNA Pol II were all detected in the center of these genes, whereas Stat1 was not (Fig. 4, D and E). These results further indicate that the MCM2-7 complex is involved in RNA Pol II-mediated transcription.MCM5 Is Required for Transcription Elongation of RNA Pol II—To determine whether the MCM2-7 proteins are required for the presence of RNA Pol II in the centers of constitutively expressed genes, ChIP analysis was performed with antibodies against RNA Pol II in the MCM5 RNAi knockdown cells. RNA Pol II was present in the promoter region and center of the GAPDH gene in cells transfected with a negative control siRNA (Fig. 5, A, lanes 3 and 5, and B). In contrast, RNA Pol II was only detected in the promoter region in the MCM5 knockdown cells (Fig. 5, A, lane 4, and B), and there was almost no RNA Pol II in the center of the gene (Fig. 5, A, lane 6, and B). Very low levels of RNA Pol II were detected in the 5′ intergenic region in both cell types (Fig. 5, A, lanes 1 and 2, and B). Together, these results indicate that MCM5 is required for transcription elongation of RNA Pol II but not required for the recruitment of RNA Pol II to the promoter.FIGURE 5MCM5 is required for transcription elongation of RNA Pol II. RNAi-mediated MCM5 knockdown was performed in 293T cells as described in the legend for Fig. 1, and ChIP analysis was performed with RNA Pol II antibody as described in the legend for Fig. 4. A, primers against the 5′ intergenic region (5′), promoter region (P), and center (C) of the GAPDH gene were used for ChIP analysis in both control (Ctl) and MCM5 siRNA-transfected (M5) cells. C, ChIP was performed with primers against the 5′ regions (5′) and centers (C) of E2F4, β-actin, and β-tubulin.

https://openalex.org/W2049804931,"Focal adhesions are specialized sites of cell attachment to the extracellular matrix where integrin receptors link extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton, and they are constantly remodeled during cell migration. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is an important regulator of focal adhesion remodeling. AGAP2 is an Arf GTPase-activating protein that regulates endosomal trafficking and is overexpressed in different human cancers. Here we examined the regulation of the FAK activity and the focal adhesion remodeling by AGAP2. Our results show that FAK binds the pleckstrin homology domain of AGAP2, and the binding is independent of FAK activation following epidermal growth factor receptor stimulation. Overexpression of AGAP2 augments the activity of FAK, and concordantly, the knockdown of AGAP2 expression with RNA interference attenuates the FAK activity stimulated by epidermal growth factor or platelet-derived growth factor receptors. AGAP2 is localized to the focal adhesions, and its overexpression results in dissolution of the focal adhesions, whereas knockdown of its expression stabilizes them. The AGAP2-induced dissolution of the focal adhesions is independent of its GTPase-activating protein activity but may involve its N-terminal G protein-like domain. Our results indicate that AGAP2 regulates the FAK activity and the focal adhesion disassembly during cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2011795033,"Expression of p21(Sdi1) downstream of p53 is essential for induction of cellular senescence, although cancer cell senescence can also occur in the p53 null condition. We report herein that senescence-associated phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (SA-pErk1/2) enhanced p21(Sdi1) transcription by phosphorylating Sp1 on Ser(59) downstream of protein kinase C (PKC) alpha. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), which was increased in cellular senescence, significantly activated both PKCalpha and PKCbetaI. However, PKCalpha, but not PKCbetaI, regulated ROS generation and cell proliferation in senescent cells along with activation of cdk2, proven by siRNAs. PKCalpha-siRNA also reduced SA-pErk1/2 expression in old human diploid fibroblast cells, accompanied with changes of senescence phenotypes to young cell-like. Regulation of SA-pErk1/2 was also confirmed by using catalytically active PKCalpha and its DN-mutant construct. These findings strongly suggest a new pathway to regulate senescence phenotypes by ROS via Sp1 phosphorylation between PKCalpha and SA-pErk1/2: employing GST-Sp1 mutants and MEK inhibitor analyses, we found that SA-pErk1/2 regulated Sp1 phosphorylation on the Ser(59) residue in vivo, but not threonine, in cellular senescence, which regulated transcription of p21(Sdi1) expression. In summary, PKCalpha, which was activated in senescent cells by ROS strongly activated Erk1/2, and the SA-pErk1/2 in turn phosphorylated Sp1 on Ser(59). Sp1-enhanced transcription of p21(Sdi1) resulted in regulation of cellular senescence in primary human diploid fibroblast cells."
https://openalex.org/W2038769472,"Retinal ganglion cells that express the photopigment melanopsin are intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGCs) and exhibit robust synaptically driven ON-responses to light, yet they will continue to depolarize in response to light when all synaptic input from rod and cone photoreceptors is removed. The light-evoked increase in firing of classical ganglion cells is determined by synaptic input from ON-bipolar cells in the proximal sublamina of the inner plexiform layer. OFF-bipolar cells synapse with ganglion cell dendrites in the distal sublamina of the inner plexiform layer. Of the several types of ipRGC that have been described, M1 ipRGCs send dendrites exclusively into the OFF region of the inner plexiform layer where they stratify near the border of the inner nuclear layer. We tested whether M1 ipRGCs with dendrites restricted to the OFF sublamina of the inner plexiform layer receive synaptic ON-bipolar input by examining light-induced gene expression in vivo using melanopsin knockout mice. Mice in which both copies of the melanopsin gene (opn4) have been replaced with the tau-lacZ gene (homozygous tau-lacZ+/+ knockin mice) are melanopsin knockouts (opn4−/−) but M1 ipRGCs are specifically identified by their expression of β-galactosidase. Approximately 60% of M1 ipRGCs in Opn4−/− mice exposed to 3 hrs of light expressed c-Fos; no β-galactosidase-positive RGCs expressed c-Fos in the dark. Intraocular application of L-AP4, a compound which blocks transmission of visual signals between photoreceptors and ON-bipolar cells significantly reduced light-evoked c-Fos expression in M1 ipRGCs compared to saline injected eyes (66% saline vs 27% L-AP4). The results are the first description of a light-evoked response in an ipRGC lacking melanopsin and provide in vivo confirmation of previous in vitro observations illustrating an unusual circuit in the retina in which ganglion cells sending dendrites to the OFF sublamina of the inner plexiform layer receive excitatory synaptic input from ON-bipolar cells."
https://openalex.org/W1969716365,"Proper activation of checkpoint during mitotic stress is an important mechanism to prevent genomic instability. Chfr (Check point protein with FHA (Forkhead-associated domain) and RING domains) is a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) that is important for the control of an early mitotic checkpoint, which delays entry into metaphase in response to mitotic stress. Because several lines of evidence indicate that Chfr is a potential tumor suppressor, it is critically important for us to identify Chfr substrates and understand how Chfr may regulate these substrates, control mitotic transitions, and thus, act as a tumor suppressor in vivo. Here, we report the discovery of a new Chfr-associated protein Kif22, a chromokinesin that binds to both DNA and microtubules. We demonstrated that Kif22 is a novel substrate of Chfr. We showed that Chfr-mediated Kif22 down-regulation is critical for the maintenance of chromosome stability.

The exact role of FHA domain in Chfr function is largely unknown. Chfr via its RING domain transfers both lysine 48-linked and lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin chains to its target proteins, which either promotes the degradation of target proteins or alters their function (3Kang D. Chen J. Wong J. Fang G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 4Bothos J. Summers M.K. Venere M. Scolnick D.M. Halazonetis T.D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7101-7107Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Recently, a PAR-binding zinc finger motif, which binds directly to polyADP-ribosylated substrates catalyzed by PARP1, was identified at the C-terminal region of Chfr (5Ahel I. Ahel D. Matsusaka T. Clark A.J. Pines J. Boulton S.J. West S.C. Nature. 2008; 451: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). This PAR-binding zinc finger motif was reported to be required for Chfr function in antephase checkpoint (2Matsusaka T. Pines J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 5Ahel I. Ahel D. Matsusaka T. Clark A.J. Pines J. Boulton S.J. West S.C.

Chfr delays the cell cycle progression at mitosis by inactivating cyclin B1-bound Cdc2 and then exporting them from nucleus (6Summers M.K. Bothos J. Halazonetis T.D. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2589-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Further, mechanistic studies have suggested that the inactivation of Cdc2 may be due to a negative regulation of Plk1 by Chfr (3Kang D. Chen J. Wong J. Fang G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Polyubiquitination of Plk1 by Chfr negatively regulates the Plk1 protein levels, which delay the inactivation of Cdc2 inhibitory Wee1 kinase and the activation of Cdc25 phosphatase and thus maintain Cdc2 at its inactive state. Several lines of evidence indicate that Chfr is a potential tumor suppressor. Loss or down-regulation of Chfr has been reported in several types of cancers including primary breast, lung, esophagus, colon, and gastric carcinomas (1Scolnick D.M. Halazonetis T.D. Nature. 2000; 406: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 7Privette L.M. Petty E.M. Translational Oncol. 2008; 1: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 8Toyota M. Sasaki Y.

A. 2003; 100: 7818-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). To investigate directly whether Chfr loss contributes to tumorigenesis, our laboratory has generated Chfr knock-out mice, which were cancer-prone and developed spontaneous tumors (9Yu X. Minter-Dykhouse K. Malureanu L. Zhao W.M. Zhang D. Merkle C.J. Ward I.M. Saya H. Fang G. van Deursen J. Chen J. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The increased tumor incidence in Chfr null mice is likely due to a failure in maintaining chromosomal stability, which occurs at least partially due to the overexpression of a key mitotic kinase Aurora A (9Yu X. Minter-Dykhouse K. Malureanu L. Zhao W.M. Zhang D. Merkle C.J. Ward I.M. Saya H. Fang G. van Deursen J. Chen J. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Chfr physically interacts with Aurora A and promotes its ubiquitination and degradation; thus, higher protein levels of Aurora A in Chfr null mice may contribute to chromosomal instability and eventually tumorigenesis. Therefore, our current hypothesis is that Chfr may regulate the stability of several of its substrates including Aurora A, and thus, control mitotic progression and prevent chromosomal instability. In this study, we reported the identification of another Chfr substrate as chromokinesin protein Kif22 and revealed that Kif22 overexpression also contributes to chromosomal instability observed in Chfr-deficient cells. Plasmids—Full-length Chfr and Kif22 were cloned into an S-protein/FLAG/SBP (streptavidin-binding protein) triple-tagged destination vector using the Gateway cloning system (Invitrogen). Various Kif22 deletions (D1–D8), Chfr deletions (ΔFHA, ΔRING, and ΔCys), and point mutations were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis and verified by DNA sequencing. Full-length Chfr and Kif22 were also cloned to Myc-tagged mammalian expression destination vector and GST-tagged and MBP-tagged bacterial expression vector. An HA-tagged ubiquitin construct was used in in vivo ubiquitination assays. Cell Culture—HeLa and 293T cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. Human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) were maintained in MEGM complete medium supplemented with bovine pituitary extract. 293T-Chfr, 293T-Kif22, MCF7-control shRNA, MCF7-Chfr shRNA, T47D-control shRNA, and T47D-Chfr shRNA stable cell lines were maintained in complete RPMI medium supplemented with 2 μg/ml puromycin. HeLa-Myc Chfr stable cell lines were maintained in RPMI medium with G418. All the cell lines described were maintained in humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Antibodies—Anti-Kif22 (Cytoskeleton Inc.), anti-HA (Covance), anti-GST, anti-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), anti-FLAG, anti-MBP, anti-actin, anti-α tubulin, anti-γ tubulin (all from Sigma), anti-CENPA (AbCam), and anti-phospho histone H3 serine 10 antibodies were used in this study. Mouse monoclonal anti-Chfr antibodies were produced by hybridoma fusions. Rabbit anti-Aurora B antibodies were raised previously in the laboratory by immunizing rabbits with GST-Aurora B fusion protein. Antisera were affinity-purified using AminoLink plus immobilization and purification kit (Pierce). Tandem Affinity Purification— 293T cells were transfected with plasmid encoding triple-tagged Chfr, and 3 weeks later, puromycin-resistant colonies were selected and screened for Chfr expression. Chfr stable cells were lysed with NETN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Non-idet P-40) containing 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml of pepstatin A and aprotinin (10 μg/ml) on ice for 20 min. Cell lysates were incubated with streptavidin-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. The bound proteins were washed three times with NETN and then eluted twice with 2 mg/ml biotin (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. The eluates were incubated with S-protein-agarose (Novagen) for 1 h at 4 °C and then washed three times with NETN. The proteins bound to S-protein-agarose beads were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The identities of eluted proteins were revealed by mass spectrometry analysis performed by the Taplin Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility at Harvard. Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—293T cells and HeLa cells were transfected with various plasmids using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For immunoprecipitation assays, whole cell lysates were incubated with 2 μg of specified antibody bound to either protein A-Sepharose beads or protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were then washed with NETN buffer four times and applied to SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed following standard protocols. In Vivo Ubiquitination Assay—HeLa Cells were transfected with various combinations of plasmids as shown in Fig. 3, A and B, along with HA-tagged ubiquitin. At 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with MG132 (4 μm) for 6 h, and whole cell extracts prepared by NETN lysis were used to immunoprecipitate the substrate protein. The analysis of ubiquitination was performed by immunoblotting using anti-HA antibodies. GST Pulldown Assays—GST-tagged Chfr or control GST bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were incubated with 293T cell lysates expressing FLAG-tagged Kif22 or a bacterially expressed recombinant MBP-Kif22 for 1 h at 4 °C, and the washed complexes were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and the interactions were analyzed by Western blotting. RNA Interference—Control small interfering RNA (siRNA) and the smart pool siRNAs against Kif22 and Chfr were purchased from Dharmacon Inc. Transfection was performed twice 30 h apart with 200 nm siRNA using Oligofectamine reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen), and the protein expression was analyzed by immunoblotting 72 h after transfection. Control shRNA and Chfr shRNA target sets were purchased from Open Biosystems, and stable clones of MCF-7 and T47D cells were made by transfecting with Lipofectamine followed by puromycin selection for 3 weeks. Immunoflouroscence Staining—Cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde solution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 50 mm sucrose at room temperature for 15 min. After permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 300 mm sucrose at room temperature for 5 min, cells were incubated with a primary antibody (α-tubulin, CENPA, γ-tubulin, Chfr, and Kif22) at 37 °C for 20 min. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with either fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody at 37 °C for 20 min. Nuclei were counterstained with 4′6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. After a final wash with PBS, coverslips were mounted with glycerin containing paraphenylenediamine. Images were acquired by using a Nikon ECLIPSE E800 microscope. Cell Cycle Analysis—T24 cells were arrested in G0 phase by contact inhibition and were released into fresh medium. At the indicated time points, cells were lysed, and the levels of Chfr and Kif22 during different phases of the cell cycle were analyzed by Western blotting. Cell cycle progression was monitored by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Metaphase Spreads—Metaphase chromosome spreads were performed as described before (9Yu X. Minter-Dykhouse K. Malureanu L. Zhao W.M. Zhang D. Merkle C.J. Ward I.M. Saya H. Fang G. van Deursen J. Chen J. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells treated with colcemid for 8 h were collected, washed with PBS, and treated with 75 mm KCl at room temperature for 15 min. The treated cells were then fixed in fresh methanol:acetonic acid (3:1) solution and dropped onto glass slides. Cells were allowed to air dry and were stained with Giemsa (5%) and visualized under the microscope. Kif22 Is a Chfr-associated Protein—In an attempt to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the tumor suppressor function of Chfr, we established a 293T derivative cell line stably expressing a triple epitope (S-protein, FLAG, and streptavidin-binding peptide)-tagged version of Chfr (SFB-Chfr). A two-step affinity purification using streptavidin-Sepharose beads and S-protein-agarose beads followed by mass spectrometry analysis allowed us to identify several Chfr-interacting proteins (Fig. 1A and supplemental Table 1). Among them, we repeatedly isolated Kif22 as a major associated protein in the purified Chfr complex. Kif22 (also known as hKid) is a mitotic motor protein with both DNA and microtubule binding activities and thus plays a positive role during spindle assembly and proper chromosome segregation in mitosis (10Tokai N.

Yamamoto T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5455-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 12Levesque A.A. Compton D.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1135-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We first confirmed that endogenous Kif22 but not Kif11 specifically associates with Chfr (Fig. 1, B and C). Co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1, D and E) and GST pulldown assays (Fig. 1, F and G) further confirmed a direct interaction between these two proteins. Further, immunostaining of Chfr and Kif22 revealed overlapping localization of both proteins during interphase and early mitotic phases, but they appear to localize differently during late mitotic phases (supplemental Fig. S1). To further understand how these two proteins may function together, we examined whether Chfr and Kif22 expression would be coordinately regulated during cell cycle. T24 cells were arrested in G0 phase by contact inhibition, and the synchronized cells were allowed to reenter the cell cycle by releasing them into fresh medium at the appropriate density. As shown in Fig. 1H, the levels of Kif22 and Chfr were tightly regulated and inversely correlated during different phases of the cell cycle, suggesting a potential functional link between these two proteins. Chfr contains N-terminal FHA, a middle RING, and C-terminal cysteine-rich domains (1Scolnick D.M. Halazonetis T.D. Nature. 2000; 406: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The FHA domain, known to be a phospho-peptide-binding motif, is important for Chfr checkpoint function in response to mitotic stress (1Scolnick D.M. Halazonetis T.D. Nature. 2000; 406: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 13Durocher D. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. Jackson S.P. Mol.

Biol. 2004; 11: 1114-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), but the identities of the proteins interacting with Chfr FHA domain are still unknown. The RING finger domain, a characteristic domain of ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3), also plays a crucial role in Chfr function via its ability to ubiquitinate substrates such as Aurora A and Plk1 (3Kang D. Chen J. Wong J. Fang G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 9Yu X. Minter-Dykhouse K. Malureanu L. Zhao W.M. Zhang D. Merkle C.J. Ward I.M. Saya H.

Zhu Y. Yen T.J. Zhou B.B. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1797-1801PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal cysteine-rich domain of Chfr is required for its binding to substrates and therefore targeting its substrates for degradation (9Yu X. Minter-Dykhouse K. Malureanu L. Zhao W.M. Zhang D. Merkle C.J. Ward I.M. Saya H. Fang G. van Deursen J. Chen J. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). To map the Kif22-binding region on Chfr, we used Myc epitope-tagged wild-type and a series of Chfr deletion mutants (Fig. 2A). Immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody revealed that endogenous Kif22 interacted with full-length Chfr, ΔFHA, and ΔRING Chfr mutants but not with the Δcysteine-rich domain mutant of Chfr (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the C-terminal cysteine-rich domain of Chfr is essential for mediating its interaction with Kif22. On the other hand, Kif22 also has several functional domains that are critically important for its mitotic function during spindle assembly and proper chromosome alignment in metaphase (11Tokai-Nishizumi N. Ohsugi M. Suzuki E. Yamamoto T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5455-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 16Yajima J. Edamatsu M. Watai-Nishii J. Tokai-Nishizumi N. Yamamoto T. Toyoshima Y.Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We generated expression constructs for FLAG-tagged Kif22 and a series of N-terminal or C-terminal deletion mutants that lack different Kif22 functional domains (Fig. 2C). To map the Chfr-binding region on Kif22, we co-expressed these constructs along with full-length Myc-tagged Chfr. The immunoprecipitation results suggest that Chfr interacts with Kif22 through both the N termini and the C termini because only a deletion mutant (D4) that lacks both termini of Kif22 failed to bind to Chfr (Fig. 2D). The interaction of Chfr with the N terminus of Kif22 appears to be weaker than its binding to the C terminus of Kif22 (Fig. 2D). Kif22 Is a Novel Substrate of Chfr—At least in the case of Aurora A, we know that Chfr uses its C-terminal cysteine-rich domain as a substrate recognition domain, which recruits substrates for ubiquitination and degradation (9Yu X. Minter-Dykhouse K. Malureanu L. Zhao W.M. Zhang D. Merkle C.J. Ward I.M. Saya H. Fang G. van Deursen J. Chen J. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Because Kif22 interacts with Chfr via its cysteine-rich domain, we reasoned that Kif22 might be a Chfr substrate. Kif22 was polyubiquitinated in the presence of the full-length Chfr but not ΔRING or Δcysteine-rich domain deletion mutants, indicating that Kif22 is a substrate of Chfr, and both the intact Chfr E3 ligase activity and its substrate recognition domain are required for efficient Chfr-mediated Kif22 ubiquitination (Fig. 3A). Conversely, full-length Kif22, a Kif22 mutant (Fig. 2C, D2) with intact N-terminal Chfr interaction region but devoid of the C-terminal Chfr-interacting region, and a Kif22 mutant (Fig. 2C, D5) with intact C-terminal Chfr interaction region but devoid of the N-terminal Chfr-interacting region were efficiently ubiquitinated by Chfr (Fig. 3B). Another Kif22 mutant (Fig. 2C, D4), which lacks both the N-terminal and the C-terminal Chfr-binding regions, could not be ubiquitinated by Chfr (Fig. 3B), again supporting the notion that a specific interaction of Chfr with Kif22 is essential for Chfr-dependent Kif22 polyubiquitination. Polyubiquitination of Kif22 by the Chfr is likely to be required for Kif22 degradation as the stable knockdown of Chfr in T47D and MCF-7 cells results in up-regulation of Kif22 (Fig. 3C). In addition, the protein levels of Kif22 were down-regulated by stable expression of Myc-tagged Chfr in HeLa cells that lack endogenous Chfr expression. This difference in Kif22 protein levels in cells with or without Chfr expression may not be due to changes in cell cycle distribution in those cells because the levels of a control mitotic protein Aurora B were unaltered (Fig. 3C), and also, no significant differences in cell cycle distributions were observed in these cells (data not shown). These results indicate that Kif22 protein levels are tightly regulated by Chfr in vivo. To further confirm the Chfr-mediated Kif22 down-regulation and its dependence on the proteasome pathway, we performed a co-transfection experiment with Chfr and Kif22 in the presence or absence of a proteasome inhibitor MG132. Co-transfection of Kif22 but not Chfr binding-deficient mutant of Kif22 (D4) along with Chfr reduced the steady-state levels of Kif22 protein (Fig. 3D). Pretreatment with MG132 prevents Chfr-mediated Kif22 down-regulation, suggesting the involvement of the proteasome-dependent pathway during Chfr-mediated Kif22 degradation. Taken together, these data suggest that Kif22 is a bona fide in vivo substrate of Chfr. Aberrant Expression of Kif22 Results in Abnormal Mitotic Spindles and Promotes Genomic Instability—Kif22 is known to be required for proper mitotic spindle organization and normal chromosomal alignment on the metaphase spindle (17Antonio C. Ferby I. Wilhelm H. Jones M. Karsenti E. Nebreda A.R. Vernos I. Cell. 2000; 102: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In addition, our laboratory has previously reported that the loss of Chfr leads to multiple mitotic defects (9Yu X. Minter-Dykhouse K. Malureanu L. Zhao W.M. Zhang D. Merkle C.J. Ward I.M. Saya H. Fang G. van Deursen J. Chen J. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested whether the Chfr-mediated Kif22 regulation would play a role in controlling mitotic progressions, especially during mitotic spindle assembly. HMECs expressing control shRNA displayed normal bipolar mitotic spindles, whereas some of the cells with Chfr knockdown exhibited abnormal mitotic spindles with multiple poles and disorganized array of microtubules that failed to organize a proper metaphase plate (Fig. 4, A and B). Similar to Chfr shRNA, transient overexpression of wild-type Kif22 but not DNA-binding domain-deleted (ΔDBD) Kif22 mutant (Fig. 4E) also resulted in cells with abnormal mitotic spindles (Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting that Chfr loss may lead to Kif22 overexpression and thus cause spindle disorganization. Upon knocking down of Chfr or Kif22 overexpression, we also observed aberrant arrangement of kinetochores (Fig. 4C) and the presence of abnormal number of centrosomes (Fig. 4D). A partial knock down of Kif22 (Fig. 4E) alleviated mitotic spindle defects observed in Chfr knockdown cells (Fig. 4, A–D). Previously, our laboratory has also reported chromosomal instability in cells derived from Chfr knock-out mice (9Yu X. Minter-Dykhouse K. Malureanu L. Zhao W.M. Zhang D. Merkle C.J. Ward I.M. Saya H. Fang G. van Deursen J. Chen J. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Similar to our previous findings using Chfr null mouse embryonic fibroblasts, the analysis of metaphase spreads revealed that Chfr down-regulation in HMECs results in abnormal chromosome numbers when compared with cells transfected with control shRNA (Fig. 4, F and G). Interestingly, Kif22 overexpression also results in chromosomal instability, analogous to cells with Chfr knockdown. These results suggest that at least one mechanism for Chfr functions in the maintenance of chromosomal stability and that tumor suppression could be through its regulation of Kif22 protein levels because both Chfr down-regulation and Kif22 overexpression result in chromosomal instability, which is a hallmark of tumorigenesis. In this study, we have shown that Kif22 physically interacts with Chfr and is a newly identified Chfr substrate. Kif22 is a plus-end-directed microtubule-based motor protein that plays a role in bipolar organization of spindle microtubules and chromosome movement (11Tokai-Nishizumi N. Ohsugi M. Suzuki E. Yamamoto T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5455-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Funabiki H. Murray A.W. Cell. 2000; 102: 411-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), which are important for chromosome segregation during mitosis. We speculate that the spindle disorganization and abnormal metaphase chromosomal alignment observed in Chfr-deficient cells could be at least partially explained by the up-regulation of Kif22 in these cells. Importantly, analogous to Chfr expression, proper control of Kif22 expression is also important for the maintenance of chromosomal stability. Thus, we propose that in addition to previously identified Chfr substrates (Plk1 and Aurora A), Kif22 also plays a role in the maintenance of chromosomal stability. Moreover, chromosomal instability observed in primary cells with Kif22 overexpression may suggest a potential previously unidentified involvement of Kif22 in tumorigenesis that warrants further investigation.

https://openalex.org/W1993146308,"Histatins, a family of salivary proteins, have antimicrobial activity. Candida albicans, which is killed by histatins, induces oral candidiasis in individuals with compromised immune systems. Although the functional significance of histatins has been documented, their biological and physiological functions against host cells have not been clarified. In this study, we found that histatin 3, a member of the histatin family, binds to heat shock cognate protein 70 (HSC70). These proteins were co-localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus in human gingival fibroblasts following non-heat and heat shock. Histatin 3 induced stimulation of DNA synthesis and cell survival in human gingival fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner. This DNA synthesis was found to be dependent on HSC70 by knockdown experiments. The effect of heat shock on DNA synthesis induced by histatin 3 was ∼2-fold higher than that of non-heat shock. When the histatin 3 uptake into cells was inhibited by monodansylcadaverine or when histatin 3 binding to HSC70 was precluded by 15-deoxyspergualin, DNA synthesis by histatin 3 was ∼2-fold less than that without monodansylcadaverine or 15-deoxyspergualin. Although HSC70 directly bound to p27Kip1 (a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor), histatin 3 increased the binding between those proteins but not with a peptide capable of binding to HSC70. Moreover histatin 3 prevented ATP-dependent dissociation of HSC70-p27Kip1. ATP was unable to form a histatin 3-HSC70(D10N)-p27Kip1 complex (HSC70(D10N) is a mutant attenuating ATPase activity). These findings suggest that histatin 3 may be involved in cell proliferation through the regulation of HSC70 and p27Kip1 in oral cells."
https://openalex.org/W2006530136,"Survival motor neuron (SMN) complex is essential for the biogenesis of the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, although the complete role of each SMN complex component for the snRNP synthesis is largely unclear. We have identified an interaction between the two components Gemin2-Gemin7 using the mammalian two-hybrid system. In vitro stability assay revealed that the known SMN-Gemin7 interaction becomes stable in the presence of Gemin2 possibly via the identified Gemin2-Gemin7 interaction. Gemin7 knockdown revealed a decrease in snRNP assembly activity and a decrease in SmE protein, a component of snRNP, in the SMN complex, which was consistent with a previous discussion that the Gemin6-Gemin7 heterodimer may serve as a surrogate for the SmD3-SmB particle in forming a subcore, the intermediate complex for snRNP. Interestingly, we found that Unrip, but not Gemin8, can remove Gemin7 from the stable SMN-Gemin2-Gemin7 ternary complex. In an in vitro snRNP assembly assay using the Unrip knockdown and the untreated cell lysates, we revealed that there was a decrease in Gemin7 and increase in SmB/B' in the SMN complex observed in untreated cells during the assay, suggesting that the Gemin6-Gemin7 heterodimer in the subcore is exchanged by the SmD3-SmB particle to form snRNP. Surprisingly, these changes were not observed in the assay using the Unrip knockdown cell extracts, indicating the importance of Unrip in the formation of snRNP likely via removal of the Gemin6-Gemin7 from the SMN complex. Taken together, these results indicate that snRNP is synthesized by harmonization of the SMN complex components."

These are the crucial tasks in transcription elongation as the newly synthesized RNA must be immediately available for further processing. Moreover overextended (>9-bp) or abnormally short (<7-bp) RNA-DNA hybrids result in complexes with a compromised stability and termination of transcription (1Kireeva M.L. Komissarova N. Kashlev M. J.

Although RNA displacement is controlled by reannealing of the DNA template and non-template strands at the trailing edge of the transcription bubble, a number of reports suggest an active role of prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNAP in strand separation as well as in maintenance of the length of RNA-DNA hybrid (6Westover K.D.

Structural and biochemical studies of multisubunit RNAPs have implicated structurally conserved motifs located at the upstream end of the RNA-DNA duplex that serve as a steric barrier for the growing heteroduplex. In both yeast and bacterial RNAPs a “lid” element that contains conserved aromatic residues (yeast RNAP) or aliphatic residues (bacterial RNAP) stacks upon the last base pair of the RNA-DNA hybrid and is thought to serve as a wedge in displacing the RNA from the heteroduplex (6Westover K.D. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2004; 303: 1014-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 9Vassylyev D.G. Vassylyeva M.N. Perederina A. Tahirov T.H. Artsimovitch I. Nature. 2007; 448: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The role of this structural element was investigated before high resolution structures of the bacterial elongation complex (EC) became available (7Toulokhonov I. Landick R. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 361: 644-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 8Naryshkina T. Kuznedelov K. Severinov K. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 361: 634-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It was found that lid deletion mutants did not exhibit defects in most transcription assays (including termination) and showed a clear phenotype only when transcribing single-stranded DNA templates. In this case, lid deletion mutants, in contrast to the wild type (WT) RNAP that was able to extend a transcript only by 5–7 nt, could complete runoff transcription by forming an extended RNA-DNA hybrid. In addition to the lid, several other elements, such as “rudder,” “fork loop” (yeast RNAP), and “switch 3” loop (bacterial RNAP), in multisubunit RNAPs have been implicated in RNA displacement. These other structural elements are not directly involved in RNA displacement but rather are thought to prevent reassociation of RNA after it has been displaced from the template DNA and to form an extensive network of interactions resulting in stabilization of the nucleic acid components of the EC (6Westover K.D.

Elongation complexes assembled on nucleic acid scaffolds mimic promoter-originated ECs and have proven useful in numerous studies of transcription elongation (1Kireeva M.L. Komissarova N. Kashlev M.

The scaffold design in most ECs includes two conjugated nucleic acid duplexes: the 8–9-bp RNA-DNA hybrid and a 15–20-bp downstream DNA duplex. The lack of a complementary non-template (NT) DNA strand in the RNA-DNA region results in a compromised displacement of the nascent RNA from the RNA-DNA hybrid in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNAPs as well as in a single subunit T7 RNAP (1Kireeva M.L. Komissarova N. Kashlev M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 7Toulokhonov I. Landick R. J. Mol.

This phenomenon is a universal feature in single subunit and multisubunit RNAPs as these enzymes form an overextended RNA-DNA hybrid and stall after incorporation of 5–7 nt into the RNA during primer extension. Although addition of a fully complementary NT DNA strand to the scaffold EC restores its ability to displace RNA, the efficiency of formation of such assemblies is low (4Sidorenkov I. Komissarova N. Kashlev M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 55-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In this work, using ECs assembled on single-stranded DNA scaffolds with WT and mutant RNAPs, we demonstrate that bacterial RNAP can maintain the length of the RNA-DNA hybrid as a result of an intrinsic endonuclease activity. Our data corroborate structural findings concerning the elements involved in the maintenance of RNA-DNA hybrid and suggest interplay between RNAP translocation, DNA strand separation, and endonucleolytic activity. Purification of RNAP and Polymerase Activity Assay—WT Thermus thermophilus core RNAP was purified from cell biomass obtained from the HB8 strain as described previously (15Vassylyeva M.N. Lee J. Sekine S.I. Laptenko O. Kuramitsu S. Shibata T. Inoue Y. Borukhov S. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1497-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). His-tagged WT Escherichia coli core polymerase (pIA299) was purified from cell biomass obtained as described previously (16Artsimovitch I. Svetlov V. Murakami K.S. Landick R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12344-12355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). An additional purification step using a Superdex 200 size exclusion column (600 mm) was used. The purity of these RNAPs was greater then 99.8% as judged by SDS-PAGE. Polymerase activity was measured by the ability to extend a 32P-labeled RNA primer by one nucleotide in a reaction in which the concentrations of nucleic acid scaffold (R9/TS35/NT35) and RNAP were equimolar (see transcription conditions below). Only RNAP preparations that extended the RNA primer with close to 100% efficiency within 5 min of incubation at 37 °C (E. coli core) or at 60 °C (T. thermophilus core) were used. Construction and Purification of Mutant RNAPs—Lid loop deletion β′Δ252–263 and switch 3 loop deletion βΔ1250–1259 His-tagged mutant E. coli RNAPs were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene) starting with plasmid pIA299 (16Artsimovitch I. Svetlov V. Murakami K.S. Landick R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12344-12355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). DNA primers (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.) used for mutagenesis were (5′ to 3′) CCAGATCTGCGTCCGGGTGACCTGAACGATCTG (β′Δ252–263) and CGCGCGTTCCACCGGTGGTGGTAAGGCACAG (βΔ1250–1259). After mutagenesis, genes encoding all RNAP subunits in pIA299 were sequenced to confirm absence of any unintended substitutions. Mutant RNAPs were purified by a combination of His-Trap nickel-agarose, heparin-Sepharose, Q FF (Q-Sepharose Fast Flow), and Superdex 200 chromatography. RNA and DNA Oligonucleotides—The following synthetic oligonucleotides were used (all sequences are 5′ to 3′): RNA oligomers (Dharmacon), GCGGCGAU (R8), GCGGCGAUA (R9), GCGGCGAUAUC (R11), GAGUCUGCGGCGAUA (R15), and GAGUCUGCGGCGAU (R14); DNA oligomers (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.), CCTGTCTGAATCGATATCGCCGC (TS35), CCTGTCTGAATCGATATCGCC (TS70), CCTGTCTGAATCTATATCGCCGC (TS35A), CCTGTCTGAATCTATATCGCC (TS71), CGCCGCTATTGCTAAGTCTGTCCC (TS39), TCGATTCAGACAGG (NT35), GATTCAGACAGG (NT358), and ACGATTCAGACAGGG (NT39). Assembly of ECs and Transcription Conditions—Nucleic acid scaffolds were assembled by annealing equimolar concentrations of complementary RNA and DNA oligomers as described previously (17Temiakov D. Anikin M. McAllister W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47035-47043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). RNA oligomers were labeled at their 5′ ends using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) prior to assembly. To assemble elongation complexes, core RNAP (0.2–1 μm) was incubated with an equimolar concentration of scaffold for 5 min at room temperature in 10 μl of transcription buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 7.9 at 25 °C, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). Primer extension was achieved by incubation of these complexes with substrate NTPs (100 μm) for 1–60 min at 60 °C (T. thermophilus RNAP) or 37 °C (E. coli RNAP). Exo/endonucleolytic activity was probed by incubation of complexes for 0–60 min at 60 °C (T. thermophilus RNAP) or 37 °C (E. coli RNAP). Reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 95% formamide, 0.05 m EDTA, and the products were resolved by 20% PAGE in the presence of 6 m urea and visualized by a PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). To probe the nature of RNA hydrolysis in complexes having overextended RNA-DNA hybrids, we first incorporated [32P]AMP at the 3′ end of the RNA primer in EC assembled using R14/TS35/NT35 scaffold. The 3′-labeled RNA (15 nt, or R15) was then purified by extraction from 20% denaturing PAGE, annealed with the DNA template (TS53) to produce 11-bp RNA-DNA duplex, and incubated with RNAP in exo/endonucleolytic assays as described above. In our earlier experiments with T. thermophilus RNAP we noticed that elongation complexes assembled on scaffolds having a long (>10-bp) RNA-DNA hybrid exhibited a substantial intrinsic cleavage activity (12Kashkina E. Anikin M. Tahirov T.H. Kochetkov S.N. Vassylyev D.G. Temiakov D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4036-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Most notably, extension of the RNA primer in an EC containing a 9-bp RNA-DNA (EC9) by 2 nt resulted in a complex that was hypersensitive to intrinsic endonuclease activity presumably due to the formation of an 11-bp hybrid. The extended RNA primer in this complex was immediately hydrolyzed to yield a 9-bp EC (12Kashkina E. Anikin M. Tahirov T.H. Kochetkov S.N. Vassylyev D.G. Temiakov D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4036-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). ECs having 11-bp hybrids can be assembled on an RNA-DNA hybrid directly (Fig. 1). As in similar experiments described previously (12Kashkina E. Anikin M. Tahirov T.H. Kochetkov S.N. Vassylyev D.G. Temiakov D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4036-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we observed hydrolysis of the RNA primer resulting in formation of an endonuclease-resistant EC9. Although the rate of the RNA hydrolysis in the EC11 assembled in this manner was lower compared with complexes obtained by primer extension (12Kashkina E. Anikin M. Tahirov T.H. Kochetkov S.N. Vassylyev D.G. Temiakov D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4036-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (likely because of the extra time required for the binding of nucleic acids to the polymerase and formation of an EC), we observed almost complete primer conversion within 30 min of incubation time. In view of this, we speculated that RNAP endonucleolytic activity in ECs assembled on scaffolds having extended RNA-DNA hybrids may, in part, be responsible for the transcript-assisted proofreading activity recently described in Thermus aquaticus ECs having a mismatched 3′ end (18Zenkin N. Yuzenkova Y. Severinov K. Science. 2006; 313: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). There the scaffold ECs contained 11-bp RNA-DNA hybrids that may have stimulated RNAP backtracking and as a consequence endonuclease cleavage in complexes having both matched or mismatched 3′ RNA bases (18Zenkin N. Yuzenkova Y. Severinov K. Science. 2006; 313: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To investigate the relation of two physiologically important RNAP functions in transcription elongation (maintenance of the length of the RNA-DNA duplex and proofreading activity) we used scaffolds with different hybrid lengths to assemble ECs with WT E. coli RNAP and with mutant RNAPs in which deletions of elements implicated in RNA displacement had been made. In our transcript cleavage assays, we used E. coli RNAP preparations that were additionally purified by means of gel filtration on Superdex 200 to remove traces of exogenous exo/endonuclease activity not associated with RNAP or GreA/GreB factors (see “Experimental Procedures”). Incubation of a purified RNAP with 5′-32P-labeled RNA or RNA-DNA scaffold (R9/TS35/NT35) for an extended period of time (20 h) revealed no RNA degradation suggesting that the final RNAP preparations were essentially free of exogenous nuclease activity (data not shown). As in the experiments with T. thermophilus RNAP, we observed the same trend in the efficiency of intrinsic cleavage activity with E. coli RNAP ECs (Fig. 2A). Thus, ECs having 11-bp RNA-DNA hybrids (EC11) were readily converted to stable (resistant to further degradation) ECs with 9-bp hybrids within 40–60 min (lanes 1–7). At the same time, EC9 that was determined previously to be mostly in the post-translocated state (12Kashkina E. Anikin M. Tahirov T.H. Kochetkov S.N. Vassylyev D.G. Temiakov D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4036-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) remained intact as no RNA hydrolysis was detected (lanes 15–21). Similar results were obtained when EC11 was produced by extension of the RNA in EC9 by 2 nt (data not shown). These data are consistent with our prior observations obtained with T. thermophilus RNAP ECs and confirm that bacterial RNAP can “sense” an overextended hybrid and correct it by backtracking and trimming the 3′ end of the RNA. Several studies indicate that bacterial RNAPs in ECs having a mismatched base pair at the growing end of the RNA-DNA hybrid exhibit proofreading activity that results in the removal of the incorrect nucleotide (18Zenkin N. Yuzenkova Y. Severinov K. Science. 2006; 313: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 19Laptenko O. Borukhov S. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 20Erie D.A. Hajiseyedjavadi O. Young M.C. von Hippel P.H. Science. 1993; 262: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Because both the mismatch and RNA-DNA hybrid length correction reactions described above appeared to have the same nature (intrinsic cleavage activity), we decided to investigate how RNA-DNA hybrid length contributes to the RNAP proofreading activity. We first looked at how mismatched bases affect intrinsic cleavage activity in ECs having different RNA-DNA hybrid lengths (Fig. 2A, lanes 8–14 and 22–28). We found that whereas a mismatched bp placed at the 3′ end of a 9-bp EC stimulated cleavage activity only slightly, a 3′ mismatched EC11 was rapidly converted to EC9. Importantly as evident from Fig. 2A, an 11-bp RNA-DNA hybrid by itself contributes to the RNA hydrolysis. Although we found that sequence at the 3′ end of the RNA affects the efficiency of its hydrolysis in EC11 (data not shown), it is possible that the hybrid length correction reaction might have contributed to RNA hydrolysis in experiments involving mismatched ECs (18Zenkin N. Yuzenkova Y. Severinov K. Science. 2006; 313: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To verify that both reactions are due to the same type of intrinsic RNAP activity, we labeled the RNA by incorporation of [32P]AMP at its 3′ end (Fig. 2B). Incubation of 3′-labeled EC in transcription buffer resulted in accumulation of a labeled dinucleotide cleavage product (pUpA), indicating that the cleavage activity observed in this complex was due to the E. coli RNAP endonuclease activity and thus has the same mechanism (intrinsic endonucleolytic cleavage) as the hydrolysis observed in T. aquaticus ECs having a mismatched base at the 3′ end of the transcript (18Zenkin N. Yuzenkova Y. Severinov K. Science. 2006; 313: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Analysis of the crystal structure of T. thermophilus RNAP EC suggests that several regions may be involved in maintenance of the length of the RNA-DNA hybrid (9Vassylyev D.G. Vassylyeva M.N. Perederina A. Tahirov T.H. Artsimovitch I. Nature. 2007; 448: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 12Kashkina E. Anikin M. Tahirov T.H. Kochetkov S.N. Vassylyev D.G. Temiakov D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4036-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The lid element (β′ residues 250–270) provides a physical barrier to the growing end of the RNA-DNA hybrid and may play a role similar to that of the lid loop in yeast RNAP II (6Westover K.D. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2004; 303: 1014-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Another loop in the RNAP β subunit (switch 3, residues 1240–1260) forms a hydrophobic cleft that accommodates the unpaired RNA base (–10) just after its separation from the RNA-DNA hybrid (9Vassylyev D.G. Vassylyeva M.N. Perederina A. Tahirov T.H. Artsimovitch I. Nature. 2007; 448: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). To address the role of these structural elements in RNA-DNA strand separation and particularly in maintaining the length of the RNA-DNA hybrid during elongation, we made deletion mutants in E. coli core RNAP that involve these regions. The lid deletion mutation (β′Δ252–263; corresponds to the interval 527–538 in T. thermophilus RNAP) was similar to one described in earlier publications (7Toulokhonov I. Landick R. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 361: 644-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 8Naryshkina T. Kuznedelov K. Severinov K. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 361: 634-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In another construct, the hydrophobic region (βΔ1250–1259; corresponds to the interval 1012–1021 in T. thermophilus RNAP) in the switch 3 element of E. coli RNAP β subunit was deleted (Fig. 3A). To characterize the mutants we first examined the stability of ECs in salt challenge experiments (Fig. 4A). After incubation of RNAPs with the scaffolds, the ECs were immobilized on nickel-agarose beads and incubated with different concentrations of salt. The complexes were washed to remove the dissociated components and analyzed by PAGE. As expected based on the results of the previous experiments, ECs formed with WT E. coli RNAP were stable in the presence of 1 m NaCl (4Sidorenkov I. Komissarova N. Kashlev M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 55-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 21Korzheva N. Mustaev A. Nudler E. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). At the same time, both deletion mutants formed ECs that were sensitive to high salt concentrations. Thus, consistent with earlier data (8Naryshkina T. Kuznedelov K. Severinov K. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 361: 634-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), 50% of ECs assembled using the lid deletion mutant dissociated at 500 mm NaCl, whereas ECs formed with βΔ1250–1259 RNAP withstood challenge only up to 300 mm NaCl. These findings are consistent with the T. thermophilus EC crystal structure that indicates that a number of ionic interactions are formed between the upstream part of the RNA-DNA hybrid and RNAP that may be disrupted by salt (9Vassylyev D.G. Vassylyeva M.N. Perederina A. Tahirov T.H. Artsimovitch I. Nature. 2007; 448: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Nevertheless ECs formed with all mutant RNAPs were stable in transcription buffer (i.e. in the presence of 100 mm NaCl) for over 80 min (supplemental Fig. S1), and therefore these conditions were used in all further assays involving these mutant RNAPs. As mentioned above, WT E. coli RNAP can extend the RNA-DNA hybrid by incorporation of only 5–7 substrate NTPs when scaffolds lacking a fully complementary NT strand are used to assemble an EC (7Toulokhonov I. Landick R. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 361: 644-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 8Naryshkina T. Kuznedelov K. Severinov K. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 361: 634-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18Zenkin N. Yuzenkova Y. Severinov K. Science. 2006; 313: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 22Zenkin N. Naryshkina T. Kuznedelov K. Severinov K. Nature. 2006; 439: 617-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We examined whether the mutant RNAPs exhibited a different ability to extend the RNA primer. As expected, WT RNAP stalled after incorporation of 5 nt into the transcript, producing very little runoff product (23 nt; Fig. 4B). In contrast, the β′Δ252–263 mutant, although pausing upon incorporation of 5 nt, was able to complete transcription and produced a full-length product that extended to the end of the template with high efficiency. This suggests that removal of the lid eliminates the physical barrier for the growing RNA-DNA hybrid that causes instability in EC in full agreement with the previous studies (7Toulokhonov I. Landick R. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 361: 644-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 8Naryshkina T. Kuznedelov K. Severinov K. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 361: 634-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Transcription by the βΔ1250–1259 mutant paused after incorporation of 6 nt (Fig. 4). Although this mutant was able to recover from the apparent pause, runoff products were not detected even after 40 min of incubation, suggesting that this RNAP region is also involved in maintenance of the RNA-DNA hybrid length in the absence of the NT DNA strand. We next examined the ability of the mutant RNAPs to extend the RNA primer by incorporation of a single substrate NTP. Although WT and mutant RNAPs were catalytically competent and fully extended the RNA primer in a standard activity assay (see “Experimental Procedures”), we noticed that βΔ1250–1259 RNAP could complete the reaction only within 2–5 min, whereas less than 15 s were required for WT and lid deletion mutant RNAPs (data not shown). Although fast flow kinetic measurements would be needed to determine the precise rates of substrate incorporation, we took advantage of a slower rate of incorporation of α-thio-NTP derivatives to examine this phenomenon (Fig. 5A). Two scaffold complexes were used: EC8 and EC9, which as we previously reported exist in mostly the pretranslocated or the post-translocated conformation, respectively (9Vassylyev D.G. Vassylyeva M.N. Perederina A. Tahirov T.H. Artsimovitch I. Nature. 2007; 448: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 12Kashkina E. Anikin M. Tahirov T.H. Kochetkov S.N. Vassylyev D.G. Temiakov D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4036-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Here the difference in substrate incorporation rates was much more apparent: in the pretranslocated EC8, only 30% of initial RNA primer was extended within 5 min by βΔ1250–1259 RNAP, whereas WT RNAP completed extension within 0.5–1 min (Fig. 5A, left panel). Interestingly when primer extension was analyzed using post-translocated EC9, the difference in the rate of substrate incorporation between WT and βΔ1250–1259 RNAP was negligible (Fig. 5A, right panel). The observed difference likely reflects defects during the translocation stage of the nucleotide addition cycle because translocation is required for substrate incorporation in the pretranslocated EC8 but not post-translocated EC9. Although the allosteric effect of the switch 3 deletion on RNAP catalytic activity cannot be completely excluded, the chemistry step of NTP incorporation in βΔ1250–1259 RNAP seems to be unaffected (at least in the time scale of these experiments) because this mutant incorporated both ATP and α-thio-ATP as fast as the WT RNAP in the post-translocated EC9 (Fig. 5A). We further explored the translocation defects by monitoring activity that requires backward translocation of RNAP, i.e. GreB-stimulated endonuclease hydrolysis (Fig. 5B). This activity is more efficient in the pretranslocated EC8 than in the post-translocated E. coli EC9 (12Kashkina E. Anikin M. Tahirov T.H. Kochetkov S.N. Vassylyev D.G. Temiakov D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4036-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As in the primer extension experiments, hydrolysis of the RNA in the GreB-stimulated reaction by βΔ1250–1259 RNAP was notably slower when compared with WT RNAP or the lid deletion mutant (Fig. 5B). These data together with the primer extension experiment described above (Fig. 5A) suggest that the switch 3 element may play an important role in the translocation event because EC8 is in a pretranslocated state and translocation is required for both substrate incorporation (forward translocation) and endonucleolytic activity (backward translocation). This conclusion also suggests an interesting analogy with yeast RNAP EC where it has been proposed that the formation of a strand/loop network at the upstream end of the RNA-DNA hybrid affects the position of the 3′ end of the transcript and thus the conformation of the EC (6Westover K.D. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2004; 303: 1014-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To monitor an intrinsic endonucleolytic activity of the mutant RNAPs, we used ECs assembled on an 11-bp RNA-DNA hybrid scaffold (Fig. 6). As in the previous experiments (Fig. 2A), we observed RNA hydrolysis by WT RNAP. At the same time, RNA hydrolysis in ECs assembled using mutant βΔ1250–1259 and β′Δ252–263 RNAPs was not observed (Fig. 6A). We speculate that the basis of such behavior is different for each of these mutants. As shown above (see Fig. 4B) and demonstrated in previously published experiments (7Toulokhonov I. Landick R. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 361: 644-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 8Naryshkina T. Kuznedelov K. Severinov K. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 361: 634-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the lid deletion mutant that exhibits no translocation or catalytic defects is not destabilized by the presence of the overextended RNA-DNA hybrid and can produce runoff products when all substrates are present in the transcription reaction. Thus, this mutant RNAP is unable to sense the overextended RNA-DNA hybrid and therefore does not need to backtrack and correct its length by the endonucleolytic activity. In contrast, both forward and backward translocation in βΔ1250–1259 mutant RNAP is compromised, impeding its ability to hydrolyze the RNA primer in EC11. What happens when a mismatched EC11 is assembled using mutant RNAPs? Considering that both RNA-DNA hybrid length and mismatch correction reactions contribute to the endonucleolytic cleavage, one would expect a decrease in overall rates of RNA hydrolysis in ECs formed by mutant RNAPs as it can now only be a result of a transcript-assisted proofreading activity (18Zenkin N. Yuzenkova Y. Severinov K. Science. 2006; 313: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Indeed the endonuclease activity was observed in the mismatched EC11 assembled with β′Δ252–263 mutant although at a reduced rate (Fig. 6, B and C). Because the lid deletion prevents functioning of the hybrid length correction mechanism, the observed endonucleolytic activity likely comes from a transcript-assisted proofreading activity as described previously (18Zenkin N. Yuzenkova Y. Severinov K. Science. 2006; 313: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). On the other hand, no endonuclease activity was detected in the mismatched EC11 assembled with βΔ1250–1259 mutant RNAP. This result is in good agreement with our hypothesis that βΔ1250–1259 RNAP is defective in translocation and therefore cannot efficiently perform RNA hydrolysis whether it is caused by an extended RNA-DNA hybrid or by the presence of the mismatched base at the 3′ end of the transcript. As demonstrated in recent studies, the presence of the NT DNA strand is sufficient to displace RNA from the RNA-DNA hybrid (7Toulokhonov I. Landick R. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 361: 644-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 8Naryshkina T. Kuznedelov K. Severinov K. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 361: 634-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18Zenkin N. Yuzenkova Y. Severinov K. Science. 2006; 313: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 22Zenkin N. Naryshkina T. Kuznedelov K. Severinov K. Nature. 2006; 439: 617-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A mechanistic model analogous to a strung bow might best describe the situation when RNAP transcribes templates where the NT strand is lacking or damaged. In this scenario, RNAP can incorporate several nucleotides, producing a long RNA-DNA hybrid up to 15–17 bp in length. This will likely change the pathway of the 5′ end of the RNA toward the exit pore, forcing it to follow the DNA template strand and “string” the bow by displacing the elements (such as lid and switch 3) at the upstream end of the RNA-DNA hybrid. When the flexibility of RNAP to accommodate this situation is exceeded, the overextended RNA-DNA hybrid (“arrow”) is pushed forward due to the tendency of lid and switch 3 elements to resume their normal positions, causing RNAP backtracking and extrusion of the 3′ end of the RNA, thus relaxing the bow. Subsequently endonucleolytic activity of RNAP restores the length of the RNA-DNA hybrid. When the lid is removed, charging of the bow does not occur because there would be no barrier for the growing RNA-DNA hybrid, or as suggested earlier a new opening may now be formed (8Naryshkina T. Kuznedelov K. Severinov K. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 361: 634-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As a consequence, no backtracking and therefore no endonucleolytic activity is observed in complexes with the extended RNA-DNA hybrid. On the other hand, in the absence of switch 3, which provides a binding pocket for the 5′ end of the RNA transcript and thus holds the arrow (RNA-DNA hybrid), the string is loose, and the bow cannot be strung (at least all the way), affecting both forward and backward translocation of RNAP and as a consequence diminishing endonucleolytic activity. Our experiments model the situation when the RNA-DNA hybrid exceeds its normal length by 2–3 bp and thus induces stress in a ternary complex, resulting in backtracking of RNAP along the DNA template. However, two alternative scenarios are possible when an overextended RNA-DNA hybrid escapes correction during the initial stages of its formation and reaches the length of 16–20 bp. In the first scenario, an overextended hybrid destabilizes the ternary complex causing RNAP dissociation from the DNA template, preventing its further transcription (1Kireeva M.L. Komissarova N. Kashlev M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 8Naryshkina T. Kuznedelov K. Severinov K. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 361: 634-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the second scenario, RNAP “backslides” along a single-stranded DNA template without extrusion of the 3′ end of a single-stranded transcript and forms a transcription-incompetent priming complex resistant to GreB-stimulated cleavage (22Zenkin N. Naryshkina T. Kuznedelov K. Severinov K. Nature. 2006; 439: 617-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This mechanism allows M13 phage to prime its replication by using host RNAP and, as argued by authors, can also be used during RNAP-catalyzed priming of replication on double-stranded replicons such as ColE1 (22Zenkin N. Naryshkina T. Kuznedelov K. Severinov K. Nature. 2006; 439: 617-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Additional experiments will be required to better understand instances in which overextended RNA-DNA hybrids are formed and what role they play in transcription regulation. Transcription of DNA templates that lack an NT strand or have nicks or gaps in the NT strand may result in the formation of an extended RNA-DNA hybrid (23Jiang M. Ma N. Vassylyev D.G. McAllister W.T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 777-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). At the same time, NT DNA damage increases the chance of misincorporation because of template strand misalignment (24Pomerantz R.T. Temiakov D. Anikin M. Vassylyev D.G. McAllister W.T. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 245-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 25Kashkina E. Anikin M. Brueckner F. Pomerantz R.T. McAllister W.T. Cramer P. Temiakov D. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 257-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It is therefore tempting to speculate that, by restoring the RNA-DNA hybrid to its normal 8–9-bp length, cellular RNAPs backtrack and excise the 3′ end region of transcript containing misincorporated bases. Thus, the mechanism we observe in in vitro experiments may be used by RNAP during in vivo transcription where it carries out proofreading either alone or in combination with transcript cleavage factors such as GreA/GreB in prokaryotes or TFIIS in eukaryotes.

Although FA has been defined as a DNA repair disease based on the hypersensitivity of patient cells to DNA cross-linking agents, FA patients develop various developmental defects such as skeletal abnormalities, microphthalmia, and endocrine abnormalities that may be linked to transcriptional defects. Recently, we reported that the FA core complex interacts with the transcriptional repressor Hairy Enhancer of Split 1 (HES1) suggesting that the core complex plays a role in transcription. Here we show that the FA core complex contributes to transcriptional regulation of HES1-responsive genes, including HES1 and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21cip1/waf1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies show that the FA core complex interacts with the HES1 promoter but not the p21cip1/waf1 promoter. Furthermore, we show that the FA core complex interferes with HES1 binding to the co-repressor transducin-like-Enhancer of Split, suggesting that the core complex affects transcription both directly and indirectly. Taken together these data suggest a novel function of the FA core complex in transcriptional regulation.

For this reason, FA has been defined as a DNA repair disease. Although it is clear that FA proteins are involved in a DNA cross-link response network, the precise role of each protein remains unclear. FA has a number of clinical manifestations that cannot be explained solely based on defects in cross-link repair. For example, developmental defects such as skeletal abnormalities commonly occur; the most frequent are hypoplasia of the thumbs or supernumerary thumbs (70% of patients), and microphtalmia or short stature (more than 60% of patients) (26Dokal I. Baillieres Best Pract. Res. Clin. Haematol. 2000; 13: 407-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition, more than 70% of FA patients show endocrine abnormalities, including deficiencies in growth hormone and thyroid hormone, as well as diabetes (27Wajnrajch M.P. Gertner J.M. Huma Z. Popovic J. Lin K. Verlander P.C. Batish S.D. Giampietro P.F. Davis J.G. New M.I. Auerbach A.D. Pediatrics. 2001; 107: 744-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 28Giri N. Batista D.L. Alter B.P. Stratakis C.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 92: 2624-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the progressive bone marrow failure that is the primary characteristic of FA, and that results from defective self-renewal ability of hematopoietic stem cells (29Carreau M. Gan O.I. Liu L. Doedens M. Dick J.E. Buchwald M. Exp. Hematol. 1999; 27: 1667-1674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 30Haneline L.S. Gobbett T.A. Ramani R. Carreau M. Buchwald M. Yoder M.C. Clapp D.W. Blood. 1999; 94: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has yet to be explained as a result of a defective cross-link repair. Thus, the various phenotypic features of the disease may stem from functional impairments other than DNA repair defects. Indeed, this is the case for the DNA repair syndrome trichothiodystrophy where dysfunctional basal transcription has been shown to underlie part of the trichothiodystrophy phenotype (31Keriel A. Stary A. Sarasin A. Rochette-Egly C. Egly J.M. Cell. 2002; 109: 125-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 32Compe E. Malerba M. Soler L. Marescaux J. Borrelli E. Egly J.M. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1414-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that several components of the FA core complex directly interact with the Hairy Enhancer of Split 1 (HES1) protein (33Tremblay C.S. Huang F.F. Habi O. Huard C.C. Godin C. Levesque G. Carreau M. Blood. 2008; 112: 2062-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). HES1 is a member of a highly conserved family of Hairy-related basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-type transcriptional repressors. HES1 plays an essential role in the development of many organs by promoting the maintenance of stem/progenitor cells, by controlling the reversibility of cellular quiescence, and by regulating both cell fate decisions and the timing of several developmental events (34Kageyama R. Ohtsuka T. Kobayashi T. Development. 2007; 134: 1243-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 35Sang L. Coller H.A. Roberts J.M. Science. 2008; 321: 1095-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). HES1 has also been associated with tetraploidy and chromosomal instability (36Baia G.S. Stifani S. Kimura E.T. McDermott M.W. Pieper R.O. Lal A. Neoplasia (New York). 2008; 10: 604-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), both of which are involved in the early steps of tumorigenesis (37Ganem N.J. Storchova Z. Pellman D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2007; 17: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). HES1 negatively regulates expression of downstream target genes and antagonizes the effects of bHLH activators (34Kageyama R. Ohtsuka T. Kobayashi T. Development. 2007; 134: 1243-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 38Iso T. Kedes L. Hamamori Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 194: 237-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Like other HES family members, HES1 is composed of three functional domains: a bHLH domain, an Orange domain, and a WRPW motif at the C terminus (38Iso T. Kedes L. Hamamori Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 194: 237-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). The bHLH domain is required for both DNA binding and dimerization with other bHLH factors, whereas both the Orange domain and WRPW motif are involved in protein-protein interactions. The Orange domain seems to be involved in the selection of bHLH partners, and it is required for repression of its own gene (39Castella P. Sawai S. Nakao K. Wagner J.A. Caudy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6170-6183Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The WRPW motif mediates repression through recruitment of co-repressors encoded by Transducin-like Enhancer of split (TLE) genes (40Grbavec D. Stifani S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 41Paroush Z. Finley Jr., R.L. Kidd T. Wainwright S.M. Ingham P.W. Brent R. Ish-Horowicz D. Cell. 1994; 79: 805-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). We previously reported that both Orange and WRPW motifs are involved in HES1 interactions with FA core complex proteins (33Tremblay C.S. Huang F.F. Habi O. Huard C.C. Godin C. Levesque G. Carreau M. Blood. 2008; 112: 2062-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because HES1 is a transcriptional repressor, the direct interaction between HES1 and FA core complex members prompted us to examine whether the FA complex modulates HES1 transcriptional repression. Here, we present data showing that the FA core complex co-regulates HES1 transcriptional activity via activation and repression of HES1-responsive genes, including HES1 and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21cip1/waf1. In addition, the interaction between HES1 and the FA core complex antagonizes HES1-mediated transcriptional repression by interfering with assembly of the HES1·TLE co-repressor.

Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cells were grown for 40 h following transfection and harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 or 1% Triton X-100, and Complete proteinase inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics)). Whole cell lysates were subjected to either immunoblot analysis or immunoprecipitation. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were incubated with 2 μg of antibodies as indicated in the figures. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels and subjected to Western blotting and probing with specific antibodies as indicated in the figures. Negative immunoprecipitation controls were performed using either mouse or rabbit serum. Luciferase Assays—In all assays, 1.25 × 105 COS-1 or FA-A fibroblast cells plated in 6-well plates were transfected with 0.38 μg of a plasmid containing the luciferase reporter gene driven by either the HES1 promoter (pHES1-Luc, gift from Dr. Ryoichiro Kageyama, Kyoto University), or 0.75 μg of p21cip1/waf1 promoter constructs (pGL3-p21cip1/waf1–2326/+16 (p21pro-Luc) or pGL3-p21cip1/waf1–60/+16 (p21proΔE8-E4-Luc), gifts from Dr. Claude Labrie, Laval University, and p21PE1–2 and p21PE1–3 (p21proΔE1–2-Luc or p21proΔE1–3-Luc) gifts from Dr. Xiao-Hong Sun, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation). In addition, cells were transfected with 0.125 μg of pCMVLacZ (gift from Dr. Yves Labele, Laval University) as an internal control plasmid, as well as various other plasmids indicated in the figures. The total amount of plasmids DNA was equalized between transfections using empty vectors. Cell extracts were prepared 48 h following transfections and assayed for luciferase activity using the Luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). Transfection efficiencies were normalized with the internal control plasmid (pCMVLacZ) using the β-galactosidase luminescence kit II (Clontech). Differences between means were evaluated using Student's paired t test. Quantitative PCRs—All animal procedures were performed according to protocols approved by the Animal Care Committee of Laval University, Québec, Canada. Bone marrow cells obtained from 4- to 6-month-old FancA–/–, FancC–/–, and wild-type mice (C57BL/6J) were collected from femurs and tibias. Bone marrow cells were depleted of lineage and Thy1.2-positive cells using the StemSep negative cell selection procedure according to the manufacturer's instructions (StemCell Technologies Inc.). Total RNA was isolated from freshly purified Lin–Thy1.2– cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit RNA purification system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Reverse transcription was carried out with random hexamer primers (Ambion) using the SuperScript™II protocol as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR was performed with 100 nm each of the forward and reverse Hes1 or Gapdh primers using the ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System and SYBRGREEN DNA binding dye (Invitrogen). The specific amplification was assessed based on the dissociation curve profile, and product sizes were verified by agarose 2% gel fractionation. The Hes1 gene expression profile was normalized against that of Gapdh. Chromatin Immunoprecipitations—Constructs were transfected into HEK293T cells using the calcium phosphate method. Transfected cells were grown for 40 h, treated with 1% formaldehyde for 20 min, and washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and Complete proteinase inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics). Cells were lysed in SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.1, Complete proteinase inhibitors, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and subjected to immunoprecipitation with 2 μg of antibodies as indicated in each figure using the Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay Kit as described by the manufacturer (Upstate). Immunoprecipitated DNA sequences were purified using the phenol chloroform: isoamyl alcohol DNA precipitation method. Purified and input DNA were subjected to PCR using primers specific for the human HES1 promoter (forward primer: 5′-CAAGACCAAAGCGGAAAGAA-3′; reverse primer: 5′-GGATCCTGTGTGATCCCTAGGC-3′) and the p21cip1/waf1 promoter control region (forward primer: 5′-GGTGCTTCTGGGAGAGGTGAC-3′, and reverse primer: 3′-TGACCCACTCTGGCAGGCAAG-5′). PCR products were loaded on 1.5% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. Band intensity was analyzed using the Quantity One analysis software (Bio-Rad). HES1 and p21cip1/waf1 promoter sequence amplification profiles were normalized to the corresponding negative control (mock ChIP using mouse serum). PCR controls were performed using water. Fold binding of proteins to the promoter relative to the control is presented as the mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis of the difference between means was done using the Student's paired t test. The FA Core Complex Acts as a Co-regulator of HES1 Transcription—HES1 has been shown to bind its own promoter via N-box sequences and to repress its own gene expression (39Castella P. Sawai S. Nakao K. Wagner J.A. Caudy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6170-6183Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 45Takebayashi K. Sasai Y. Sakai Y. Watanabe T. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5150-5156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using the HES1 promoter region to drive the luciferase gene (HES1pro-Luc), we tested the effect of the FA core complex on HES1-mediated transcriptional repression. We found that co-expression of FA core complex members significantly impaired HES1-mediated repression activity of its own gene (1.40-fold derepression, Fig. 1A, right panel). Surprisingly, the FA core complex significantly induced HES1 expression (1.75-fold induction, Fig. 1A, left panel). Both, the stimulatory effect of the FA core complex on HES1 transcription, and the inhibitory effect of the core complex on HES1-mediated repression of its own promoter occurred in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1, B and C, respectively). This FA core complex-mediated activity (activation and derepression of the HES1 promoter) was not the result of transfection or plasmid expression, because transfection of plasmids encoding the BACE1 or Lamin genes produced levels of luciferase expression similar to that of controls (Fig. 1D). In addition, the induction of the HES1 promoter was not the result of endogenous Notch1 activity, because treating the cells with the γ-secretase inhibitor L685,458, which blocks cleavage and activation of Notch1 (46Martys-Zage J.L. Kim S.H. Berechid B. Bingham S.J. Chu S. Sklar J. Nye J. Sisodia S.S. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 189-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), caused the same increase in luciferase activity in both treated and untreated cells (Fig. 1E). To determine whether the FA complex-mediated transcriptional regulation of HES1 is specific for HES1, we evaluated HES5-mediated transcriptional repression. Of the seven described members of the mammalian HES family described so far, HES1 and HES5 have been shown to be up-regulated by Notch1 signaling in neural cells and in bone marrow (47Ohtsuka T. Ishibashi M. Gradwohl G. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2196-2207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Kawamata S. Du C. Li K. Lavau C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3855-3863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HES5 is a repressor protein that also binds to N and E boxes of specific promoter sites, including the HES1 promoter. Results show that the FA core complex had no inhibitory effect on HES5-mediated repression but seemed to increase HES5-mediated repression of the HES1 promoter (Fig. 1F). HES1 Transcriptional Regulation Is Impaired in FA Cells—To determine whether an intact FA complex or pathway is required for transcriptional regulation of the HES1 promoter, we evaluated HES1 activation in FA mutant cells (FA-A). We found that HES1 transcriptional activation was lower in FA-A cells, than in the corresponding FANCA-complemented cells (1.71-fold difference, Fig. 2A). In contrast, negative control FA-A cells expressing the FANCE gene showed similar levels of HES1 transcriptional activity as non-complemented cells. In addition, FA-A cells and FANCE-transfected FA-A cells showed higher HES1-mediated repression of the HES1 promoter than did FANCA-complemented FA-A cells (1.58-fold difference, Fig. 2B). To determine whether the lack of a functional FA complex or pathway affects the level of HES1 expression in vivo, primitive hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells were isolated from FancA and FancC mutant mice. Quantitative real-time PCR showed lower HES1 expression in freshly isolated FancA–/– and FancC–/– primitive hematopoietic cells than in WT stem/progenitors (Fig. 2C). Together, these results imply that FA proteins, and possibly an intact FA complex/pathway, are required for proper transcriptional regulation of HES1. The FA Core Complex Enhances NICD-mediated Transcription of HES1—Because expression of the Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD), which is the active form of Notch1, has been shown to activate HES genes such as HES1, we tested the effect of the FA complex on NICD-mediated HES1 activation. Surprisingly, the FA complex enhanced NICD-mediated activation of the HES1 promoter, leading to a 1.59-fold increase in luciferase activity relative to NICD alone (Fig. 3A). This effect was mediated by the FA complex in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3B), and it was not the result of endogenous Notch1 activity, because cells treated with L685,458 showed similar levels of luciferase activity (Fig. 3D). Co-expression of the FA complex with both NICD and HES1 significantly impaired HES1-mediated repression of its own gene in a concentration-dependant manner (1.59-fold difference, Fig. 3, A and C). These results suggest that the FA complex also modulates HES1 repression activity following Notch1 activation. This activity of the FA complex is specific to HES1, because no impairment of HES5-mediated repression"
https://openalex.org/W2013750042,"The formation of ADP-ribose polymers on target proteins by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases serves a variety of cell signaling functions. In addition, extensive activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is a dominant cause of cell death in ischemia-reperfusion, trauma, and other conditions. Poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) degrades the ADP-ribose polymers formed on acceptor proteins by PARP-1 and other PARP family members. PARG exists as multiple isoforms with differing subcellular localizations, but the functional significance of these isoforms is uncertain.Primary mouse astrocytes were treated with an antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotide (PMO) targeted to exon 1 of full-length PARG to suppress expression of this nuclear-specific PARG isoform. The antisense-treated cells showed down-regulation of both nuclear PARG immunoreactivity and nuclear PARG enzymatic activity, without significant alteration in cytoplasmic PARG activity. When treated with the genotoxic agent MNNG to induced PARP-1 activation, the antisense-treated cells showed a delayed rate of nuclear PAR degradation, reduced nuclear condensation, and reduced cell death.These results support a preferentially nuclear localization for full-length PARG, and suggest a key role for this isoform in the PARP-1 cell death pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1990648563,"The gibbon family belongs to the superfamily Hominoidea and includes 15 species divided into four genera. Each genus possesses a distinct karyotype with chromosome numbers varying from 38 to 52. This diversity is the result of numerous chromosomal changes that have accumulated during the evolution of the gibbon lineage, a quite unique feature in comparison with other hominoids and most of the other primates. Some gibbon species and subspecies rank among the most endangered primates in the world. Breeding programs can be extremely challenging and hybridization plays an important role within the factors responsible for the decline of captive gibbons. With less than 500 individuals left in the wild, the northern white-cheeked gibbon (Nomascus leucogenys leucogenys, NLE) is the most endangered primate in a successful captive breeding program. We present here the analysis of an inversion that we show being specific for the northern white-cheeked gibbon and can be used as one of the criteria to distinguish this subspecies from other gibbon taxa. The availability of the sequence spanning for one of the breakpoints of the inversion allows detecting it by a simple PCR test also on low quality DNA. Our results demonstrate the important role of genomics in providing tools for conservation efforts."
https://openalex.org/W1981808333,"We have previously shown that SV40 small t antigen (st) cooperates with deregulated cyclin E to activate CDK2 and bypass quiescence in normal human fibroblasts (NHF). Here we show that st expression in serum-starved and density-arrested NHF specifically induces up-regulation and loading of CDC6 onto chromatin. Coexpression of cyclin E results in further accumulation of CDC6 onto chromatin concomitantly with phosphorylation of CDK2 on Thr-160 and CDC6 on Ser-54. Investigation of the mechanism leading to CDC6 accumulation and chromatin loading indicates that st is a potent inducer of cdc6 mRNA expression and increases CDC6 protein stability. We also show that CDC6 expression in quiescent NHF efficiently promotes cyclin E loading onto chromatin, but it is not sufficient to activate CDK2. Moreover, we show that CDC6 expression is linked to phosphorylation of the activating T loop of CDK2 in serum-starved NHF stimulated with mitogens or ectopically expressing cyclin E and st. Our data suggest a model where the combination of st and deregulated cyclin E result in cooperative and coordinated activation of both an essential origin licensing factor, CDC6, and an activity required for origin firing, CDK2, resulting in progression from quiescence to S phase."
https://openalex.org/W1978307559,"Background Despite the effectiveness of prophylaxis, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) continues to be the most common serious opportunistic infection among HIV-infected persons. We describe factors associated with nonadherence to primary PCP prophylaxis. Methodology/Principal Findings We used 2000–2004 data from the Supplement to HIV/AIDS Surveillance (SHAS) project, a cross-sectional interview project of HIV-infected persons ≥18 years conducted in 18 states. We limited the analysis to persons who denied having prior PCP, reported having a current prescription to prevent PCP, and answered the question “In the past 30 days, how often were you able to take the PCP medication(s) exactly the way your doctor told you to take them?” We used multivariable logistic regression to describe factors associated with nonadherence. Of 1,666 subjects prescribed PCP prophylaxis, 305 (18.3%) were nonadherent. Persons were more likely to be nonadherent if they reported using marijuana (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1–2.4), non-injection drugs other than marijuana (aOR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.0–2.1), or injection drugs (aOR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.3–4.1) in the past year; their mental health was “not good” for ≥1 day during the past month (aOR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.2–2.2); their most recent CD4 count was <200 cells/μL (aOR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.1–2.2); or taking ART usually (aOR = 9.6, 95% CI = 6.7–13.7) or sometimes/rarely/never (aOR = 18.4, 95% CI = 11.1–30.4), compared with always, as prescribed. Conclusion/Significance Providers should inquire about and promote strategies to improve adherence to PCP prophylaxis, particularly among persons who use illicit drugs, have mental health issues, and who are not compliant with ART to reduce the occurrence of PCP."
https://openalex.org/W1977449391,"Modern linkage-based approaches employing extended pedigrees are becoming powerful tools for localizing complex quantitative trait loci. For these linkage mapping methods, it is necessary to reconstruct extended pedigrees which include living individuals, using extensive pedigree records. Unfortunately, such records are not always easy to obtain and application of the linkage-based approaches has been restricted. Within a finite population under random mating, latent inbreeding rather than non-random inbreeding by consanguineous marriages is expected to occur and is attributable to coalescence in a finite population. Interestingly, it has been revealed that significant random inbreeding exists even in general human populations. Random inbreeding should be used to detect the hidden coancestry between individuals for a particular chromosomal position and it could also have application in linkage mapping methods. Here we present a novel method, named finite population based linkage mapping (FPL) method, to detect linkage between a quantitative trait and a marker via random inbreeding in a finite population without pedigree records. We show how to estimate coancestry for a chromosomal position between individuals by using multipoint Bayesian estimation. Subsequently, we describe the FPL method for detecting linkage via interval mapping method using a nonparametric test. We show that the FPL method does work via simulated data. For a random sample from a finite population, the FPL method is more powerful than a standard pedigree-based linkage mapping method with using genotypes of all parents of the sample. In addition, the FPL method was demonstrated by actual microsatellite genotype data of 750 Japanese individuals that are unrelated according to pedigree records to map a known Psoriasis susceptible locus. For samples without pedigree records, it was suggested that the FPL method require limited number of individuals, therefore would be better than other methods using thousands of individuals."
