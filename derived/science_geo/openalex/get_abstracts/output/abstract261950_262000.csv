https://openalex.org/W2017840637,"We report the application of single-molecule-based sequencing technology for high-throughput profiling of histone modifications in mammalian cells. By obtaining over four billion bases of sequence from chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA, we generated genome-wide chromatin-state maps of mouse embryonic stem cells, neural progenitor cells and embryonic fibroblasts. We find that lysine 4 and lysine 27 trimethylation effectively discriminates genes that are expressed, poised for expression, or stably repressed, and therefore reflect cell state and lineage potential. Lysine 36 trimethylation marks primary coding and non-coding transcripts, facilitating gene annotation. Trimethylation of lysine 9 and lysine 20 is detected at satellite, telomeric and active long-terminal repeats, and can spread into proximal unique sequences. Lysine 4 and lysine 9 trimethylation marks imprinting control regions. Finally, we show that chromatin state can be read in an allele-specific manner by using single nucleotide polymorphisms. This study provides a framework for the application of comprehensive chromatin profiling towards characterization of diverse mammalian cell populations. Although they contain the same set of genes, different cell types in a multicellular organism maintain very different behaviours. These cell states are thought to be related to chromatin state — that is, modifications to histones and other proteins that package the genome. Single-molecule sequencing technology has now been used to construct chromatin-state maps for mouse embryonic stem cells and two other more developmentally advanced cell types, revealing the genome-wide distribution of important chromatin modifications. The study provides pointers for the use of chromatin profiling on mammalian cell populations, including those of abnormal cells, such as cancer. Single-molecule-based sequencing technology is applied to generate genome-wide maps of chromatin modifications in mammalian cells. Histone marks can discriminate genes that are active, poised for activation, or stably repressed and therefore reflect cell state and developmental potential."
https://openalex.org/W2046768931,"Antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell tolerance, induced by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), is one of the main mechanisms of tumor escape. Using in vivo models, we show here that MDSCs directly disrupt the binding of specific peptide–major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) dimers to CD8-expressing T cells through nitration of tyrosines in a T-cell receptor (TCR)-CD8 complex. This process makes CD8-expressing T cells unable to bind pMHC and to respond to the specific peptide, although they retain their ability to respond to nonspecific stimulation. Nitration of TCR-CD8 is induced by MDSCs through hyperproduction of reactive oxygen species and peroxynitrite during direct cell-cell contact. Molecular modeling suggests specific sites of nitration that might affect the conformational flexibility of TCR-CD8 and its interaction with pMHC. These data identify a previously unknown mechanism of T-cell tolerance in cancer that is also pertinent to many pathological conditions associated with accumulation of MDSCs."

https://openalex.org/W2120607076,"In human societies, cooperative behavior in joint enterprises is often enforced through institutions that impose sanctions on defectors. Many experiments on so-called public goods games have shown that in the absence of such institutions, individuals are willing to punish defectors, even at a cost to themselves. Theoretical models confirm that social norms prescribing the punishment of uncooperative behavior are stable—once established, they prevent dissident minorities from spreading. But how can such costly punishing behavior gain a foothold in the population? A surprisingly simple model shows that if individuals have the option to stand aside and abstain from the joint endeavor, this paves the way for the emergence and establishment of cooperative behavior based on the punishment of defectors. Paradoxically, the freedom to withdraw from the common enterprise leads to enforcement of social norms. Joint enterprises that are compulsory rather than voluntary are less likely to lead to cooperation."

https://openalex.org/W2080885049,"Artificial endonucleases consisting of a FokI cleavage domain tethered to engineered zinc-finger DNA-binding proteins have proven useful for stimulating homologous recombination in a variety of cell types. Because the catalytic domain of zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) must dimerize to become active, two subunits are typically assembled as heterodimers at the cleavage site. The use of ZFNs is often associated with significant cytotoxicity, presumably due to cleavage at off-target sites. Here we describe a structure-based approach to reducing off-target cleavage. Using in silico protein modeling and energy calculations, we increased the specificity of target site cleavage by preventing homodimerization and lowering the dimerization energy. Cell-based recombination assays confirmed that the modified ZFNs were as active as the original ZFNs but elicit significantly less genotoxicity. The improved safety profile may facilitate therapeutic application of the ZFN technology."
https://openalex.org/W2125678197,"Genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the most common sexually transmitted infection, and virtually all cases of cervical cancer are attributable to infection by a subset of HPVs (reviewed in ref. 1). Despite the high incidence of HPV infection and the recent development of a prophylactic vaccine that confers protection against some HPV types, many features of HPV infection are poorly understood. It remains worthwhile to consider other interventions against genital HPVs, particularly those that target infections not prevented by the current vaccine. However, productive papillomavirus infection is species- and tissue-restricted, and traditional models use animal papillomaviruses that infect the skin or oral mucosa. Here we report the development of a mouse model of cervicovaginal infection with HPV16 that recapitulates the establishment phase of papillomavirus infection. Transduction of a reporter gene by an HPV16 pseudovirus was characterized by histology and quantified by whole-organ, multispectral imaging. Disruption of the integrity of the stratified or columnar genital epithelium was required for infection, which occurred after deposition of the virus on the basement membrane underlying basal keratinocytes. A widely used vaginal spermicide, nonoxynol-9 (N-9), greatly increased susceptibility to infection. In contrast, carrageenan, a polysaccharide present in some vaginal lubricants, prevented infection even in the presence of N-9, suggesting that carrageenan might serve as an effective topical HPV microbicide."

In a pooled analysis comprising 9,533 cases and 11,389 controls, SNPs in WFS1 were strongly associated with diabetes risk. Rare mutations in WFS1 cause Wolfram syndrome; using a gene-centric approach, we show that variation in WFS1 also predisposes to common type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2025155898,"The ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) plays a critical role in the biogenesis of high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles and in mediating cellular cholesterol efflux. The mechanism by which ABCA1 achieves these effects is not established, despite extensive investigation. Here, we present a model that explains the essential features, especially the effects of ABCA1 activity in inducing apolipoprotein (apo) A-I binding to cells and the compositions of the discoidal HDL particles that are produced. The apo A-I/ABCA1 reaction scheme involves three steps. First, there is binding of a small regulatory pool of apo A-I to ABCA1, thereby enhancing net phospholipid translocation to the plasma membrane exofacial leaflet; this leads to unequal lateral packing densities in the two leaflets of the phospholipid bilayer. Second, the resultant membrane strain is relieved by bending and by creation of exovesiculated lipid domains. The formation of highly curved membrane surface promotes high affinity binding of apo A-I to these domains. Third, this pool of bound apo A-I spontaneously solubilizes the exovesiculated domain to create discoidal nascent HDL particles. These particles contain two, three, or four molecules of apo A-I and a complement of membrane phospholipid classes together with some cholesterol. A key feature of this mechanism is that membrane bending induced by ABCA1 lipid translocase activity creates the conditions required for nascent HDL assembly by apo A-I. Overall, this mechanism is consistent with the known properties of ABCA1 and apo A-I and reconciles many of the apparently discrepant findings in the literature.

HDL is anti-atherogenic, at least in part, because it can participate in reverse cholesterol transport, the process by which excess cholesterol in peripheral cells is returned to the liver for catabolism (5Wang N.

It is now apparent that liver and intestinal ABCA1 are responsible for producing essentially all circulating HDL particles (11Timmins J.M. Lee J.Y. Boudyguina E. Kluckman K.D. Brunham L.R. Mulya A.

However, ABCA1 expressed in macrophages is critical for mediating the efflux of excess cholesterol from the cells and preventing the formation of the foam cells characteristic of fatty streak atherosclerotic lesions (7Attie A.D.

Despite the intense interest, a major question that has remained unresolved is the mechanism by which ABCA1 interacts with apo A-I, the principal protein of HDL, to remove cellular lipids and create nascent HDL particles. Knowledge of this mechanism will provide a basis for systematic manipulation of the process.

More recent models have centered on a two-step mechanism in which there is initial formation of an apo A-I complex followed by lipidation of this bound apo A-I and dissociation of the resultant apo A-I/lipid complex (14Chroni A.

However, at this stage, a generally accepted model for the mechanism by which apo A-I/ABCA1 interaction creates nascent HDL particles does not exist. Here we propose a reaction scheme for the ABCA1/apo A-I system that integrates key findings from the literature and our laboratory. A central feature of this mechanism is that membrane phospholipid translocation via ABCA1 induces bending of the membrane bilayer to create high curvature sites to which apo A-I can bind and solubilize membrane phospholipid and cholesterol to create nascent HDL particles. Experimental evidence that supports the novel features of the model is presented. Apo A-I—Apo A-I was isolated from human plasma HDL as described before (18Davidson W.S. Rodrigueza W.V. Lund-Katz S.

Immunogold Labeling and Electron Microscopy—Immunogold labeling of J774 cells was performed essentially as described previously (23Lin G. Oram J.F. Atherosclerosis. 2000; 149: 359-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, J774 cells in which ABCA1 was up-regulated with cAMP and control cells were incubated with apo A-I (10 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 4 h, after which they were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and prefixed with paraformaldehyde (4%) in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were treated with either goat anti-human apo A-I serum (Academy Biomedical Company) or goat anti-human apo A-I antibody (Novus Biologicals) overnight at 4 °C. The cells were then treated with donkey anti-goat IgG conjugated with 10 nm colloidal gold (Aurion) for 1 h at room temperature and post-fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 2h. The fixed cells were then dehydrated and embedded with EPON, and ultra-thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and examined in a transmission electron microscope. Binding of Apo A-I to Phospholipids—The binding isotherms for apo A-I to egg PC unilamellar vesicles were determined by gel filtration chromatography as described (20Tanaka M. Dhanasekaran P.

Enthalpies of apo A-I binding to unilamellar egg PC vesicles were measured by isothermal titration calorimetry as described (20Tanaka M. Dhanasekaran P. Nguyen D. Ohta S. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C.

Solubilization of Phospholipid Vesicles by Apo A-I—The kinetics of solubilization of DMPC MLV by apo A-I and its variants at 24 °C to form small discoidal apo A-I/PC complexes were measured by monitoring the decreases in absorbance at 325 nm, as described before (26Segall M.L.

The solubilization by apo A-I at 37 °C of MLV prepared from a membrane phospholipid mixture was monitored in a similar fashion. To mimic the mixture of membrane lipids incorporated into the nascent HDL particles created by the activity of ABCA1 in J774 cells (22Duong P.T. Collins H.L. Nickel M. Lund-Katz S. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 832-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), the following lipids (purity >99%) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL) and used to prepare MLV. The membrane lipid mixture comprised: 55% (w/w total phospholipid) bovine liver PC, 12% porcine brain sphingomyelin, 5% egg lyso PC, 10% bovine liver phosphatidylethanolamine, 8% porcine brain phosphatidylserine, 10% bovine liver phosphatidylinositol. Cholesterol was added at the level of 8% w/w total phospholipids. This membrane lipid mixture was dissolved in chloroform, and after removal of the solvent, the lipids were dispersed as multilamellar vesicles in deoxygenated Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris, 0.01% EDTA, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01% sodium azide, pH 7.4) by vortexing and stored at 4 °C overnight under nitrogen before use in the solubilization assay. The incubations of MLV with apo A-I were conducted under nitrogen. Because it is impossible to define the mechanism of an enzyme reaction without defining the products of such a reaction, we have previously performed a detailed characterization of the products of the ABCA1/apo A-I interaction using both the J774 macrophage cell line and primary human skin fibroblasts (21Liu L. Bortnick A.E. Nickel M. Dhanasekaran P. Subbaiah P.V. Lund-Katz S. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 832-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These products include discoidal HDL particles containing two, three, or four apo A-I molecules/particle. The nascent HDL particles are heterogeneous with respect to size and lipid content, and their phospholipids comprise all of the major classes present in mammalian cell membranes. In addition, some monomeric apo A-I species associated with three to four phospholipid and one to two cholesterol molecules can be produced. 3Duong, P. T. and Phillips, M. C., unpublished observations. Any proposed apo A-I/ABCA1 reaction scheme has to be consistent with the formation of the above products. Another important requirement of a model of the reaction is that it accounts for the ABCA1-induced binding of apo A-I to cells. We have recently resolved some of the ambiguities in the literature on this topic by showing that ABCA1 activity creates two cell surface binding sites for apo A-I (27Vedhachalam C. Ghering A.B. Davidson W.S. Lund-Katz S. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2007; 27: 1603-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Binding occurs to a low capacity site created by direct apo A-I/ABCA1 interaction and also to a much higher capacity site that involves apo A-I/lipid interactions. The existence of these two binding sites implies that, contrary to current thought, the binding of apo A-I to ABCA1 and the binding of lipid molecules to apo A-I are uncoupled events. A successful reaction scheme has to account for these important features. We believe that the integrated reaction scheme summarized in Fig. 1 explains the above phenomena and is consistent with the known properties of ABCA1 and apo A-I. Furthermore, as will be argued below, there is strong experimental evidence supporting the novel features of the model. Step 1: Apo A-I Binding to ABCA1—Cross-linking studies from several laboratories have established that apo A-I can bind directly to the ABCA1 molecule when the latter is in its active conformation (14Chroni A.

The binding site on ABCA1 is apparently a hydrophobic region in its largest extracellular loop (30Fitzgerald M.L. Morris A.L. Rhee J.S. Andersson L.P. Mendez A.J. Freeman M.W. J. Biol.

The motif in apolipoproteins that is recognized by this site is apparently the amphipathic α-helix, which explains the low specificity of the apolipoprotein/ABCA1 interaction.

An important consequence of the binding of apo A-I to ABCA1 is that the transporter becomes stabilized at the cell surface because of signaling responses mediated by Janus kinase 2 (32Tang C.

Any stabilization of ABCA1 in the cell plasma membrane will lead to an enhancement of net phospholipid translocase activity. By analogy to bacterial ABC lipid transporters, the active translocation of phospholipid occurs in a chamber created by the two-transmembrane helical domains in the ABCA1 molecule (Fig. 1). The preferred substrate for translocation by ABCA1 has not been established unambiguously, although it is clear that phosphatidylserine can be transported (39Chambenoit O. Hamon Y. Margue D.

ABCA1 translocase activity also leads to an increase in non-raft microdomains in the plasma membrane (42Landry Y.D. Denis M. Nandi S. Bell S. Vaughan A.M. Zha X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36091-36101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) where cholesterol becomes accessible to cholesterol oxidase and removal by apolipoproteins (43Vaughan A.M. Oram J.F. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1373-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Regardless of the exact nature of the lipid molecules translocated, the net accumulation of lipid molecules in the exofacial leaflet of the membrane will lead to lateral compression of the phospholipid molecules in this half of the bilayer (Fig. 1). Concomitantly, the net depletion of phospholipid molecules in the cytoplasmic leaflet will lead to expansion of the phospholipid lateral packing. The resultant asymmetric phospholipid packing across the bilayer created by local ABCA1 activity induces strain in the membrane that has to be relieved. Step 2: Apo A-I Binding to Exovesiculated Membrane Domains—The strain in the membrane induced by phospholipid translocation can be relieved by bending of the phospholipid bilayer. Given that the direction of ABCA1-induced net phospholipid transport in the membrane is to the exofacial leaflet, it follows that the lateral phospholipid packing density in the two halves of the membrane can be equalized by bulging of the membrane in the direction of the extracellular space. The differences in radius of curvature of the inner and outer bilayer leaflets in a highly curved exovesiculated domain will relieve the membrane strain induced by ABCA1 phospholipid translocase activity (see Step 2 in Fig. 1). In agreement with this concept, plasma membrane protrusions have been observed in cells expressing ABCA1 (28Wang N. Silver D.L. Costet P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33053-33058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the perturbed lipid environment associated with the exovesiculated domain is not a direct result of phospholipid translocation via ABCA1 but rather an indirect effect caused by induced membrane curvature. Induction of high curvature into a phospholipid bilayer, such as is created in 20-nm-diameter SUV, disorders the molecular packing and creates space between the phospholipid polar groups into which apolipoprotein amphipathic α-helices can penetrate (20Tanaka M.

Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10689-10695Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). As a consequence, apo A-I is able to bind with high affinity (Kd =∼0.1 μm (20Tanaka M.

A similar Kd is observed for ABCA1-induced binding of apo A-I to lipid sites in the cell surface (27Vedhachalam C. Ghering A.B. Davidson W.S. Lund-Katz S. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2007; 27: 1603-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The strong influence of phospholipid bilayer curvature is demonstrated by the comparison in Fig. 2A of the apo A-I-binding isotherms for egg PC SUV (20-nm diameter) and LUV (200-nm diameter). The maximum level of apo A-I binding is reduced ∼8-fold for the LUV presented at the same total exposed surface area, consistent with the idea that apo A-I does not bind well to relatively planar phospholipid bilayers. Confirmation of the promotion of high affinity apo A-I binding by the induction of high curvature into a phospholipid bilayer is provided by the isothermal titration calorimetry experiment summarized in Fig. 2B. It is apparent that binding of apo A-I to SUV is accompanied by a large exothermic heat (-93 kcal/mol); a large part of this favorable enthalpy of interaction arises from the increase in apo A-I α-helix content upon binding (24Saito H. Dhanasekaran P. Nguyen D. Deridder E. Holvoet P. LundKatz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20974-20981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 45Saito H. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 350-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Consistent with much reduced apo A-I binding to the less curved LUV surface, the enthalpy is reduced some 25-fold when apo A-I is mixed with the same amount of exposed bilayer surface present as LUV. The electron micrographs presented in Fig. 3 provide direct evidence for the existence of the protruding exovesiculated domains depicted in Step 2 in Fig. 1. It is apparent that the immunogold label of apo A-I bound to the surface of J774 cells in which ABCA1 is active is clustered on structures that protrude from the plasma membrane (Fig. 3, A and B); these structures could not be detected in control J774 cells in which ABCA1 was not up-regulated (Fig. 3C). Our results are in agreement with those of Lin and Oram (23Lin G. Oram J.F. Atherosclerosis. 2000; 149: 359-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), who previously characterized the morphology of the apo A-I-binding sites on ABCA1-expressing cells. They saw 10–60-nm “mushroom-like” protrusions from the surfaces of human fibroblasts and THP-1 macrophages to which apo A-I was bound. The formation of such protrusions required energy expenditure, and they were not apparent in Tangier disease cells where ABCA1 was inactive. Apo E also participates effectively in the ABCA1 reaction to create nascent HDL particles (Ref."

When proteins are unrelated to others of known activity, bioinformatics inference for function becomes problematic. It would thus be useful to interrogate protein structures for function directly. Here, we predict the function of an enzyme of unknown activity, Tm0936 from Thermotoga maritima, by docking high-energy intermediate forms of thousands of candidate metabolites. The docking hit list was dominated by adenine analogues, which appeared to undergo C6-deamination. Four of these, including 5-methylthioadenosine and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), were tested as substrates, and three had substantial catalytic rate constants (10(5) M(-1 )s(-1)). The X-ray crystal structure of the complex between Tm0936 and the product resulting from the deamination of SAH, S-inosylhomocysteine, was determined, and it corresponded closely to the predicted structure. The deaminated products can be further metabolized by T. maritima in a previously uncharacterized SAH degradation pathway. Structure-based docking with high-energy forms of potential substrates may be a useful tool to annotate enzymes for function."

PRAS40 associates with mTORC1 (which contains raptor) but not mTORC2. PRAS40 interacts with raptor, and this requires an intact TOR-signaling (TOS) motif in PRAS40. Like TOS motif-containing proteins such as eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), PRAS40 is a substrate for phosphorylation by mTORC1. Consistent with this, starvation of cells of amino acids or treatment with rapamycin alters the phosphorylation of PRAS40. PRAS40 binds 14-3-3 proteins, and this requires both amino acids and insulin. Binding of PRAS40 to 14-3-3 proteins is inhibited by TSC1/2 (negative regulators of mTORC1) and stimulated by Rheb in a rapamycin-sensitive manner. This confirms that PRAS40 is a target for regulation by mTORC1. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of PRAS40 impairs both the amino acid- and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and the phosphorylation of S6. However, this has no effect on the phosphorylation of Akt or TSC2 (an Akt substrate). These data place PRAS40 downstream of mTORC1 but upstream of its effectors, such as S6K1 and 4E-BP1."
https://openalex.org/W2005166958,"When prototrophic yeast cells are cultured under nutrient-limited conditions that mimic growth in the wild, rather than in the high-glucose solutions used in most laboratory studies, they exhibit a robustly periodic metabolic cycle. Over a cycle of 4 to 5 hours, yeast cells rhythmically alternate between glycolysis and respiration. The cell division cycle is tightly constrained to the reductive phase of this yeast metabolic cycle, with DNA replication taking place only during the glycolytic phase. We show that cell cycle mutants impeded in metabolic cycle-directed restriction of cell division exhibit substantial increases in spontaneous mutation rate. In addition, disruption of the gene encoding a DNA checkpoint kinase that couples the cell division cycle to the circadian cycle abolishes synchrony of the metabolic and cell cycles. Thus, circadian, metabolic, and cell division cycles may be coordinated similarly as an evolutionarily conserved means of preserving genome integrity."

Unsupervised clustering disclosed distinctive expression profiles between MCBs and DCBs. Supervised analysis identified gene signatures discriminating MCBs from DCBs and between MCB subclasses. Notably, many of the discriminator genes were associated with downregulation of epithelial phenotypes and with synthesis, remodeling and adhesion of extracellular matrix, with some of them have known or inferred roles related to EMT. Importantly, several of the discriminator genes were upregulated in a mutant Snail-transfected MCF7 cell known to exhibit features of EMT, thereby indicating a crucial role for EMT in the pathogenesis of MCBs. Finally, the identification of SPARC and vimentin as poor prognostic factors reinforced the role of EMT in cancer progression.

Although classical studies in mammals showed that nicotinic acid (NA) is a better precursor than nicotinamide (Nam) in elevating tissue NAD levels, molecular details of NAD synthesis from NA remain largely unknown. We here identified NA phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT) in humans and provided direct evidence of tight link between NAPRT and the increase in cellular NAD levels. The enzyme was abundantly expressed in the small intestine, liver, and kidney in mice and mediated [14C]NAD synthesis from [14C]NA in human cells. In cells expressing endogenous NAPRT, the addition of NA but not Nam almost doubled cellular NAD contents and decreased cytotoxicity by H2O2. Both effects were reversed by knockdown of NAPRT expression. These results indicate that NAPRT is essential for NA to increase cellular NAD levels and, thus, to prevent oxidative stress of the cells. Kinetic analyses revealed that NAPRT, but not Nam phosphoribosyltransferase (NamPRT, also known as pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor or visfatin), is insensitive to the physiological concentration of NAD. Together, we conclude that NA elevates cellular NAD levels through NAPRT function and, thus, protects the cells against stress, partly due to lack of feedback inhibition of NAPRT but not NamPRT by NAD.

Changes in the cellular NAD level would, thus, have a significant impact on mammal physiology, including humans, and NAD biosynthesis reactions should be tightly regulated; however, the mechanisms regulating the cellular content of NAD remain to be determined. Mammalian NAD biosynthesis is accomplished through either the de novo pathway from tryptophan or salvage pathway from nicotinamide (Nam) 2The abbreviations used are: NamnicotinamideNAnicotinic acidNAPRTNA phosphoribosyltransferaseNaMNNA mononucleotideNaADNA adenine dinucleotideNamPRTNam phosphoribosyltransferaseNMNNam mononucleotidePRPP5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphateESI-MSelectrospray ionization mass spectrometryRTreverse transcriptionsiRNAshort interfering RNA and nicotinic acid (NA) (Fig. 1) (14Magni G.

In the salvage pathway Nam is recycled to NAD by two enzymes, Nam phosphoribosyltransferase (NamPRT, also known as pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor (15Samal B. Sun Y. Stearns G. Xie C. Suggs S.

Although Nam has been thought to represent the main precursor of the salvage synthesis to keep cellular contents of NAD constant in mammals (17Rongvaux A. Andris F. Van Gool F. Leo O. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), the supplementation of Nam does not seem so effective in elevating cellular NAD contents beyond the basal level (18Revollo J.R.

BioEssays. 2003; 25: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), NA seems to be derived primarily from the extracellular sources. Contrary to Nam, exogenously added NA has been clearly shown to be a better precursor in NAD biosynthesis than Nam and markedly increases NAD levels in mammalian tissues including liver, kidney, and heart in classical studies (19Collins P.B.

The tissue-specific increase in NAD levels by the addition of NA seems to correlate well with relatively high NAPRT activities in these tissues (23Shibata K. Hayakawa T. Iwai K. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1986; 50: 3037-3041Google Scholar), suggesting an important role of the enzyme in the NA-induced increase in cellular NAD levels. However, whether the enzyme indeed mediates the increases in cellular NAD levels and the role of the NA pathway in regulating biological processes through altering cellular NAD contents remain largely unknown, since the enzyme NAPRT has not been identified molecularly in mammals. In the present study we identified and characterized human NAPRT molecularly and showed using short interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of NAPRT that the enzyme is essential for the effects of NA to elevate NAD contents in human cells and protect the cells against oxidative stress. Given the critical roles of NAD in regulating cell functions, the strong capability to increase cellular NAD contents of NA, which has long been used for the treatment of hyperlipidemia (24Carlson L.A.

These media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cloning and Expression of Human NAPRT and NamPRT cDNAs—Full-length human NAPRT cDNA was determined from a candidate sequence in a public data base (GenBank™ accession number AAH06284) and 5′- as well as 3′-flanking parts of the sequence obtained using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (see supplemental methods). Human NAPRT cDNA and the coding region of human NamPRT were ligated into pET22b (Novagen, Madison, WI) and pET15b (Novagen) to produce C- and N-terminal His6-tagged proteins, respectively. The recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells were purified with His-Bind resin (Novagen) (25Hara N. Yamada K. Terashima M. Osago H. Shimoyama M. Tsuchiya M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10914-10921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To express human NAPRT in eucaryotic cells as a fusion protein with a His6 tag, human NAPRT cDNA cloned into pcDNA3His6 (25Hara N. Yamada K. Terashima M. Osago H. Shimoyama M. Tsuchiya M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10914-10921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (pcDNA3-NAPRT) was transfected into the cells as described (25Hara N. Yamada K. Terashima M. Osago H. Shimoyama M. Tsuchiya M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10914-10921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Sequences of expression plasmids and PCR fragments were confirmed by entire sequencing in both directions. Knockdown of NAPRT—siRNAs specific for human NAPRT were synthesized against two regions of human NAPRT cDNA (nucleotides 829–1634 and 445–935 for NAPRT siRNA1 and −2, respectively) using X-tremeGENE siRNA Dicer kit (Roche Applied Science). Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase specific siRNA, generated using the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase template included in the kit, was used as control siRNA. NAPRT and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase siRNAs (at final concentrations of 13–26 nm) were transfected into HEK293 cells using X-tremeGENE siRNA transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Two days after transfection cells were subjected to assays as indicated. The control siRNA reduced hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, but not NAPRT, transcript levels in HEK293 cells (data not shown). Preparation of Lysates from Culture Cells and Animal Tissues—Cultured human cells were collected and sonicated in buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl– (pH 7.5), and 10% glycerol. Tissues were removed from female Wistar rats, washed with 0.9% NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl– (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and homogenized in the buffer. After centrifugation of these homogenates, the supernatants (whole cell lysates or tissue extracts) were subjected to enzyme assay or Western blot analysis as described below. Enzyme Assays—Unless otherwise stated, NAPRT activity was determined by measuring the formation of NaMN from NA and PRPP using thin layer chromatography (TLC). Enzyme preparations were incubated with [14C]NA (50 mCi/mmol) and PRPP as indicated in standard reaction mixtures (50 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-Cl– (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, and 25 μg of bovine serum albumin. After incubating at 37 °C for the indicated times, the reaction was terminated by heating in a boiling water bath for 60 s. Proteins were removed by centrifugation, and reaction products were separated on silica gel sheets (Merck) using an isobutyric acid-5% ammonium hydroxide-water mixture (66:10:19, v/v/v) as a solvent and visualized and quantified using a bio-imaging analyzer BAS 2000 (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). In some cases recombinant human NAPRT was incubated with 1 mm NA, quinolinic acid, or Nam in the presence of 0.6 mm PRPP in standard reaction mixture at 37 °C for 2 h. The reaction product (NaMN or NMN) was quantified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) as described below. For kinetic analyses, purified recombinant NAPRT was incubated with the specified concentrations of NA and PRPP in standard reaction mixture with or without NAD as indicated at 37 °C, and the amount of NaMN formed was determined by TLC assay. Kinetic parameters were determined by analysis of a Lineweaver-Burk plot of the initial rate of NaMN synthesis. For determination of NamPRT activity, purified recombinant NamPRT was incubated with [14C]Nam (50 mCi/mmol) and PRPP in the presence or absence of NAD in the same standard reaction mixture as for NAPRT assay, and NMN formation was determined by TLC assay. Determination of Molecular Mass of Catalytically Active Human NAPRT—Purified recombinant human NAPRT was electrophoresed on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel as described previously (25Hara N. Yamada K. Terashima M. Osago H. Shimoyama M. Tsuchiya M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10914-10921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Gel sliced into 2-mm pieces was incubated with 50 μm [14C]NA and 0.3 mm PRPP in standard reaction mixture (100 μl) at 37 °C for 3 h. The amount of NaMN formed in the reaction mixture was determined by TLC assay. Determination of NAD Synthesis by Human Cells—Cellular contents of NAD and related compounds were simultaneously determined by ESI-MS analysis, as described previously (26Yamada K. Hara N. Shibata T. Osago H. Tsuchiya M. Anal. Biochem. 2006; 352: 282-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (API3000, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Based on NAD contents and packed volumes of human cells, basal cellular concentrations of NAD were calculated as 503 ± 104 μm for HEK293 cells, 546 ± 46 μm for HeLa cells, and 597 ± 90 μm for HL60 cells (mean ± S.D. of three separate experiments). HepG2 cells transfected as indicated were incubated with 1 μCi/ml [14C]NA for 6 h. After incubation, pyridine nucleotides were extracted from each cell pellet as described (7Hasmann M. Schemainda I. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7436-7442PubMed Google Scholar), separated on silica gel sheets using the solvent as described above, and quantified by BAS 2000. mRNA Analysis—NAPRT gene expression was determined in various Balb/c mouse tissues by Northern blot analysis (25Hara N. Yamada K. Terashima M. Osago H. Shimoyama M. Tsuchiya M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10914-10921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) using NAPRT cDNA probe (corresponding to amino acids 200–521 of mouse NAPRT in supplemental Fig. 1) labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. Mouse NAPRT cDNA fragment was amplified from Balb/c mouse tissue total RNA by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using primers 5′-GTG AGG TGA ATG TCA TTG GC-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACA GTG CGA CCG GAT ACA CT-3′ (antisense). Western Blot Analysis—Polyclonal anti-human NAPRT antibodies were generated by immunizing a mouse with purified recombinant human NAPRT and purified on the recombinant enzyme blotted to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). NAPRT was immunodetected with anti-human NAPRT and peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (MBL, Nagoya, Japan) antibodies, as described previously (27Hara N. Tsuchiya M. Shimoyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29552-29555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Protein loading was assessed using rabbit anti-actin (Sigma) and anti-rabbit IgG (MBL) antibodies. Determination of Cytotoxicity—HEK293 cells untransfected, mock-transfected, or transfected with hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase or human NAPRT siRNAs were seeded at 2 × 104 cells/well in 96-well culture plates and allowed to adhere overnight. Subsequently, the cells were pretreated in Eagle's minimum essential medium with or without exogenously added NA or Nam as indicated and then further incubated in the presence or absence of H2O2 together with or without added NA or Nam. After incubation, WST-1 reagent was added to the wells according to the manufacturer's protocol (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) to determine cellular activity (28Ishiyama M. Tominaga H. Shiga M. Sasamoto K. Ohkura Y. Ueno K. Watanabe M. In Vitro Toxicol. 1995; 8: 187-190Google Scholar). After 2 h of incubation, absorbance at 450 nm was measured via a microtiter plate reader. Cytotoxicity was calculated as described (29Shingu T. Yamada K. Hara N. Moritake K. Osago H. Terashima M. Uemura T. Yamasaki T. Tsuchiya M. J. Neurosurg. 2003; 98: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Each assay was performed in triplicate. Cloning of Human NAPRT cDNA—Based on a candidate sequence of human NAPRT in a public data base (GenBank™ accession number AAH06284), we determined 5′- as well as 3′-flanking parts of the sequence using rapid amplification of cDNA ends and obtained a putative full-length human NAPRT cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AB242230) encoding a highly conserved protein of 538 amino acids (see supplemental Fig. 1). The primary structure of NAPRT did not show significant similarity to the NamPRT. Expression and Characterization of Human NAPRT—The protein encoded by the sequence, expressed in E. coli as His6-tagged recombinant protein and purified on nickel chelate resin, has a molecular mass of 54 kDa, slightly smaller than the value calculated from the deduced sequence, 59.8 kDa (Fig. 2B, inset). In human cell lines and rat tissues, antibodies raised against purified recombinant human NAPRT specifically recognized endogenous proteins with a molecular mass of 51 kDa as well as the expressed enzyme (Figs. 3A and 4C). As shown in Fig. 2A, recombinant human protein catalyzed the formation of [14C]NaMN in the presence of 50 μm [14C]NA and 50 μm PRPP, and the amounts of NaMN formed were comparable with those of NA consumption. The omission of either PRPP or Mg2+ from the reaction mixture resulted in a complete loss of NaMN synthesis (data not shown). These results indicate that the cDNA encodes NAPRT in humans. Recombinant human NAPRT did not catalyze the formation of NMN or NaMN from Nam or quinolinic acid (data not shown). When purified recombinant NAPRT was fractioned by non-denaturing PAGE and NAPRT activity was determined in gel slices, the activity of human NAPRT had mobility consistent with a protein of 110 kDa (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the human enzyme may exist as a homodimer, as described for the native enzyme (30Smith L.D.

HepG2 cells were transfected with either pcDNA3His6 (Vector) or pcDNA3-NAPRT (NAPRT), as indicated. A, whole cell lysates from these cells were subjected to Western blot analysis (top) with anti-NAPRT or anti-actin antibodies as indicated. The lysates from 2.6–5.5 × 105 cells were incubated with 50 μm [14C]NA and 0.3 mm PRPP for 2 h. The amount of NaMN formed was determined by TLC assay (bottom). B and C, HepG2 cells transfected as indicated (1.8–2.4 × 106 cells on 6-well dishes) were incubated in the presence of 20 μm [14C]NA (0.75 ml) for 6 h. After incubation, pyridine nucleotides were extracted from these cells, separated by TLC (B), and quantified (C), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The positions of radiolabeled metabolites (B) and amounts of NAD (C, top) and of NaAD (C, bottom) formed are shown.

We found that this is the case with human hepatoma HepG2 cells (data not shown); NAPRT protein levels and its enzymatic activity were very low in HepG2 cells transfected with vector (Fig. 3A). In contrast, HepG2 cells transfected with human NAPRT cDNA exhibited NAPRT activity as well as a protein with a molecular mass of 52 kDa (Fig. 3A). The expressed protein was uniformly distributed throughout cells (see supplemental Fig. 2), indicating the localization of human enzyme in cytosol. We cultured these transfected HepG2 cells in the presence of [14C]NA and determined the amounts of 14C-labeled compounds formed in these cells. Analysis of the radioactive compounds in cell extracts by TLC revealed that the amount of [14C]NAD was significantly higher in NAPRT cDNA-transfected cells than in those transfected with the vector (Figs. 3, B and C). [14C]NaAD was observed only in cells expressing human NAPRT (Figs. 3, B and C). Under these conditions, [14C]NaMN was not detected. The small amount of [14C]NAD observed in vector-transfected cells probably reflects a trace of NAPRT activity in the original cells. All these observations indicate that the cDNA identified here indeed encodes NAPRT protein in human cells and that the enzyme mediates the NAD biosynthesis step from NA in the cells. Tissue Distribution of NAPRT—To evaluate the tissue distribution of NAPRT, Northern blot analysis was performed with total RNA from various mouse tissues. As shown in Fig. 4A, a 1.9-kilobase message was detected in the small intestine, liver, kidney, and heart. Consistent with these results, RT-PCR revealed a higher expression of the NAPRT gene in the former three tissues and a moderate expression in other tissues including the heart (Fig. 4B). In rat tissues Western blot analysis revealed the existence of NAPRT protein in the kidney and liver (Fig. 4C). Corresponding with these results, robust activity of NAPRT was detected in these two tissues, and significant activity was also detected in other tissues including the heart (Fig. 4C). Subcellular fractionation in these tissues demonstrated the presence of endogenous NAPRT protein and enzyme activity in the cytosol (data not shown). NAPRT transcript was observed in the small intestine in mice (Figs. 4, A and B), but we did not detect NAPRT protein in the small intestine in rats (Fig. 4C), probably due to proteolytic degradation of the enzyme during the preparation of tissue extracts. Addition of NA in Culture Medium Increases Cellular NAD Contents—Knowing that human NAPRT mediates NAD biosynthesis from NA, we next investigated whether the induction of NAD biosynthesis from NA could elevate intracellular NAD levels. HEK293 cells were cultured in the presence of exogenously added NA, and the total cellular contents of NAD as well as related compounds were determined by ESI-MS analysis. As shown in Fig. 5, the addition of NA in culture medium markedly increased the total cellular NAD contents in a dose-dependent manner. As low as 1 μm, NA significantly increased the cellular NAD contents. A nearby 2-fold increase beyond the basal level was observed with 5–10 μm NA. The increase in NAD contents correlated well with the accumulation of NaAD in the cells (Fig. 5). In contrast, corresponding doses of added Nam did not significantly increase cellular NAD levels (Fig. 5), and under these conditions, the amounts of NaAD were below the limit of detection. However, when Nam concentration in culture medium was increased to 5 mm, cellular NAD contents were increased to 131 ± 7% that of the control (mean ± S.D. of three separate experiments), and a small but significant amount of cellular NaAD was detected (7.1 ± 2.7 pmol/106 cells, mean ± S.D. of three separate experiments). To determine whether the increase in cellular NAD contents in the presence of NA is mediated by NAPRT activity, we investigated the effects of the knockdown of NAPRT expression on NAD contents in HEK293 cells. Compared with cells transfected with control siRNA, cells transfected with siRNAs specific for NAPRT exhibited significant decreases in NAPRT enzyme activity as well as NAPRT protein (Figs. 6, A and B). When these cells were cultured in the presence of NA, the magnitude of increase in NAD (Fig. 6C) and NaAD (Fig. 6D) contents was markedly reduced only in NAPRT siRNA-treated cells. Knockdown of NAPRT expression did not affect basal NAD contents obtained in the absence of added NA (Fig. 6C). These observations indicate that cellular NAD contents can be increased by the addition of NA, but not Nam, at the micromolar range in culture medium and that NAPRT activity mediates increases in NAD contents in human cells. Human NAPRT Is Not Inhibited by NAD—The observation that NA was a better precursor to increase total NAD contents than Nam in HEK293 cells may be explained by the lack of feedback inhibition of NAPRT, but not NamPRT, by NAD (33Dietrich L.S.

The genetic encoding of unnatural amino acids will remove this restriction and enable new chemical and physical properties to be precisely introduced into proteins. Here we present new strategies for generating orthogonal tRNA-synthetase pairs, which made possible the genetic encoding of diverse unnatural amino acids in different mammalian cells and primary neurons. Using this new methodology, we incorporated unnatural amino acids with extended side chains into the K+ channel Kv1.4, and found that the bulkiness of residues in the inactivation peptide is essential for fast channel inactivation, a finding that had not been possible using conventional mutagenesis. This technique will stimulate and facilitate new molecular studies using tailored unnatural amino acids for cell biology and neurobiology."

Additionally, a number of low molecular mass, intrinsic membrane protein components are associated with PS II (5Bricker T.M. Ghanotakis D.F. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F.

Although PS II complexes containing only these intrinsic components can evolve oxygen in vitro, they do so at low rates (∼25–40% of control), are extremely susceptible to photoinactivation, and require high, nonphysiological levels of calcium and chloride for maximal activity (1Murata N.

The 33-kDa component, the PsbO protein, has been termed the manganese-stabilizing protein due to its stabilization of the manganese cluster during exposure to low chloride concentrations or to exogenous reductants. In vitro, the 24- and 17-kDa proteins (termed the PsbP and PsbQ proteins, respectively) appear to modulate the calcium and chloride requirements for efficient oxygen evolution. The precise roles of these proteins in oxygen evolution and PS II assembly/stability in vivo, however, remain unclear. These three extrinsic components interact with intrinsic membrane proteins and possibly with each other to yield fully functional oxygen-evolving complexes. The mature PsbP protein is highly conserved (8Bricker T.M. Burnap R.L. Wydrzynski T.J. Satoh K. Photosystem II: The Light-Driven Water: Plastoquinone Oxidoreductase.

The studies performed in tobacco indicated that RNAi suppression of the PsbQ proteins led to no observable phenotype, but RNAi suppression of the PsbP proteins led to retardation of photoautotrophic growth, lower quantum yield of PS II, loss of PsbQ, and an unstable manganese cluster that disassembled in the dark. Accumulation of the intrinsic PS II core proteins and the extrinsic PsbO protein in PsbP-suppressed tobacco plants was similar to that in wild type (18Ifuku K. Yamamoto J. Ono T.-A. Ishihara S. Sato F. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 1175-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Studies performed in Arabidopsis showed that the RNAi suppression of PsbQ led to the impaired assembly/stability of PS II in low light growth conditions, resulting in the loss of photoautotrophy (16Yi X. Hargett S.H. Frankel L.K. Bricker T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26260-26267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In our current study, we report on the RNAi suppression of PsbP expression in Arabidopsis. Our studies differ from those performed in tobacco (18Ifuku K. Yamamoto J. Ono T.-A. Ishihara S. Sato F. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 1175-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) in that we find, in Arabidopsis, the PsbP protein appears to be required for photoautotrophy and that, in its absence, significant decreases in the amounts of the PS II core proteins D2 and CP47 occur. We provide fluorescence yield data, immunological data, and growth characterization to support the hypothesis that PsbP is required for PS II assembly/stability and photoautotrophic growth in Arabidopsis. RNA Interference Construct and Transformation—The pHANNIBAL vector (19Wesley S.V. Helliwell C.A. Smith N.A. Wang M.-B. Rouse D.T. Liu Q. Gooding P.S. Singh S.P. Abbott D. Sytoutjesdijk P.A. Robinson S.P. Gleave A.P. Green A.G. Waterhouse P.M. Plant J. 2001; 27: 581-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar) was used to construct an intron-spliced hairpin RNA (RNAi construct). The sequence (+261 to +528) of the psbP gene (At1g06680) was chosen to suppress the expression of both PsbP-1 and PsbP-2. This construct will be referred to as psbP-RNAi. The primers for psbP-RNAi were 5′-CCGAATTCGAAGCCAAAGACGAACAGA-3′ and 5′-CAGGTACCAGAGGCAGTCTCACCGA-3′ for the sense fragment and 5′-AGGATCCGAAGCCAAAGACGAACAGA-3′ and 5′-CCATCGATCAGAGGCAGTCTCACCGA-3′ for the antisense fragment of psbP. PCR was performed on a RapidCycler (Idaho Technology, Inc.) in thin-walled microcentrifuge tubes in 50-μl reactions containing 5 μlof10× PCR reaction buffer, 1.5 μl of 50 mm MgCl2, 1.5 μl of 2.5 mm dNTP mixture, 3 μl of 10 pm/μl primer mixture, 0.25 μl of 5 units/μl platinum Taq polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen), and 25 ng of Arabidopsis genomic DNA in purified water. Cycling parameters were a pre-denaturation step at 95 °C for 5 min followed by 35 amplification cycles (denaturing at 94 °C for 25 s, annealing at 55 °C for 25 s, and extension at 72 °C for 45 s) and a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The amplified sequence was cloned in both forward and reverse orientations flanking the Pdk intron of the pHANNIBAL vector. After construction and verification by sequencing, the expression region was excised from pHANNIBAL with NotI and then subcloned into pART27 for transformation of the Agrobacterium strain GV3101 by the freezethaw method (20Holsters M. de Waele D. Messens E. Van Montagu M. Schell J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1978; 163: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Four-week-old Arabidopsis plants (Col-0) were transformed by the floral dip method as described previously (21Clough S.J. Bent A. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Harvested seeds were surface-sterilized with 50% ethanol and 0.5% Tween 20 for 3 min, washed briefly with 95% ethanol, and then 70% ethanol for 3 min followed by washing three times with sterile water. Seeds were spread on solid MS medium containing 0.7% agar, 2% sucrose, 50 mg/liter kanamycin, and 400 mg/liter carbenicillin and then incubated for 2 days at 4 °C in the dark. Germination and the first 10 days of growth occurred under lighted conditions at 28 °C in Petri dishes, and then the plants were transplanted into culture boxes containing solid MS medium with 2% sucrose, 50 mg/liter kanamycin, and 400 mg/liter carbenicillin at a temperature of 23 °C under ∼50μmol photons/m2/s continuous light. To test for photoautotrophic growth, plants were transplanted onto medium from which sucrose was omitted. Screening—The presence of the RNAi construct in the kanamycin-resistant plant lines was confirmed by the use of PCR with primers designed to amplify the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and the targeted gene of the introduced DNA. All of the plants that exhibited the kanamycin-resistant phenotype also exhibited the expected 1.0-kbp amplification product, which was absent in the wild-type plants (data not shown). Individual kanamycin-resistant plants were screened for the presence of the PsbP protein by “Western” blotting. One leaf was placed in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and ground to a powder in the presence of liquid nitrogen. After evaporation of the liquid nitrogen, a protein isolation buffer (20 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.4, 10 mm EDTA, 450 mm sorbitol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) was added, followed by the addition of LiDS-PAGE solubilization buffer, and the samples were incubated on ice for at least 15 min. The samples were then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min before loading onto a 12.5–20% gradient polyacrylamide gel. PAGE, gel blotting, blocking, primary and secondary antibody probing, and chemiluminescent peroxidase substrate were used followed by exposure to x-ray film and photographic development. An antibody directed against the mature spinach PsbP was found to cross-react with the PsbP protein from Arabidopsis and was used in these studies. Other antibodies that were used to investigate the stability of the Photosystem II complex were the kind gifts from many investigators. Fluorescence Measurements on Leaves—Fluorescence induction was monitored with a Photon Systems Instruments FL3000 dual modulation kinetic fluorometer (commercial version of the instrument described in Ref. 22Nedbal L. Trtílek M. Kaftan D. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. 1999; 48: 154-157Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Both measuring and saturating flashes were provided by computer-controlled photodiode arrays. The flash profile exhibited a square shape for low power measuring flashes and deviated only 5% from an ideal square shape for saturating actinic flashes. For all of the fluorescence experiments, single leaves from wild-type and PsbP-suppressed plants grown on sucrose were excised and dark-incubated for 5 min before initiation of the experiments. In the standard fluorescence induction experiments (Kautsky experiments), data were collected in a logarithmic time series between 1 ms and 4 s after the onset of strong actinic light. In the flash fluorescence induction experiments, the kinetics of the rapid fluorescence rise following a single saturating flash delivered by light-emitting diodes were examined for 50 μs with 1-μs time resolution in the presence of DCMU. Data were collected at a frequency of 10 MHz with 12-bit resolution. The proportions of PS IIα and PS IIβ centers were calculated using proprietary Photon Systems Instruments software (22Nedbal L. Trtílek M. Kaftan D. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. 1999; 48: 154-157Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the fluorescence decay experiments, the kinetics of the electron transfer between QA– and QB were examined in the absence of DCMU, while the recombination reactions of QA– with PS II donor-side components were examined in the presence of DCMU. For these experiments data were collected between 150 μsto60s following a single saturating flash. Data were analyzed using the equations outlined previously (23Reifarth F. Christen G. Seeliger A.G. Dormann P. Benning C. Renger G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11769-11776Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In this mathematical treatment, three exponential decay components and a long-lived (τ > 10 s) residual component were included. In the DCMU treatment experiments, the leaves were immersed in 40 μm DCMU, 0.1% Tween 20 in water for 30 min prior to performing the fluorescence experiments. Data were analyzed using the Origin 6.1 software package and proprietary software provided by Photon Systems Instruments. Immunological Characterization of Thylakoid Proteins—For a more in-depth analysis of the protein complement of the thylakoid membranes, chloroplasts were isolated from wild-type and four mutant plant lines that expressed low levels of PsbP. These lines, selected from the initial screening, were RNAi-P1, -P8, and -P11. Leaves were ground in a glass homogenizer with a chloroplast isolation buffer (300 mm sorbitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaHCO3). The homogenate was then passed through two layers of Miracloth® (Calbiochem), and the chloroplasts were pelleted by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 5 min. The chloroplasts were then resuspended in a small amount of isolation buffer, and the chlorophyll concentration was determined by the method of Arnon (24Arnon D.I. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LiDS-PAGE was performed on a 12.5–20% gradient gel with 3 μg of chlorophyll loaded/lane. “Western” blotting, blocking, and probing with primary and secondary antibodies were as described above. For detection of the immobilized antibodies, a chemiluminescent substrate (Super-Signal® West Pico chemiluminescent substrate, Pierce) was used, and the x-ray film was exposed to the blots. After development, the x-ray films were scanned with a UMax PowerLook III scanner at 600-d.p.i. resolution and an 8-bit color depth. Screening of Transgenic Plants—Seeds from wild type and from plants transformed with the psbP-RNAi construct were distributed onto agar plates containing Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml each of kanamycin and carbenicillin. Although wild-type seeds could not germinate successfully on medium containing these antibiotics, a few antibiotic-resistant seedlings were recovered from plants transformed with the RNAi construct. When, however, seeds from the treated plants were sown onto agar plates containing Murashige and Skoog medium plus antibiotics plus sucrose, many more antibiotic-resistant seedlings were recovered (data not shown). The presence of the psbP-RNAi construct in 10 antibiotic-resistant plants was confirmed by PCR amplification of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter region. All of the plants that exhibited antibiotic resistance also exhibited the 1-kbp PCR amplification product, indicating the presence of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter region of the RNAi construct (data not shown). To screen individual transgenic plants for the presence of the PsbP proteins, “Western” blot analysis with a polyclonal antibody that recognizes the PsbP proteins was performed. The results from a typical screening experiment are shown in Fig. 1. In wild-type plants, two immunoreactive bands were observed that bound the anti-psbP protein antibody. The nature of the minor band is unclear at this time, although it may represent a migrational variant of the PsbP-1 protein. It should be noted that this minor band is not the PsbP-2 protein, because this component migrates at a significantly lower apparent molecular mass (11Goulas E. Schubert M. Kieselbach T. Kleczkowski L.A. Gardestrom P. Schroder W.P. Hurry V. Plant J. 2006; 47: 720-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). No immunoreactive band was detected at the PsbP-2 location in the RNAi-suppressed plants, which we analyzed in this communication (data not shown). Most plants transformed with the psbP-RNAi construct showed either a partial or complete loss of the PsbP-1 band. In total, 14 plants were screened for the presence of the PsbP protein. These results indicated that 28% of the plants had expression levels similar to that of wild type for the PsbP-1 protein, 14% exhibited an intermediate level of expression, and 28% of the transgenic plants exhibited almost complete loss of the PsbP-1 protein. These results are consistent with the results obtained in other RNAi studies targeting other proteins. In almost all instances, different RNAi-containing plant lines exhibit varying degrees of suppression of the protein targets (20Holsters M. de Waele D. Messens E. Van Montagu M. Schell J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1978; 163: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar), often allowing the isolation of a graded phenotypic series of mutants deficient in the targeted component. Plants That Express Low Levels of PsbP Cannot Grow Photoautotrophically—Plants containing psbP-RNAi that were germinated on Murashige and Skoog medium plus antibiotics plus sucrose were transplanted onto MS medium plus antibiotics. Prior to transplantation, the plant that lacked PsbP-1 (Fig. 2A, plant P8) was lighter green than the wild-type plant or plants that accumulated detectable amounts of PsbP-1 (Fig. 2A, plants P11 and P1). After transplantation, the plant that lacked detectable levels of PsbP-1 yellowed and died (Fig. 2B, plant P8), whereas the other PsbP-deficient plants, which expressed small but detectable amounts of PsbP, grew somewhat more slowly than wild type (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that PsbP is required for photoautotrophic growth in Arabidopsis. Changes in Fluorescence Induction Caused by Suppressed Expression of PsbP—Fig. 3A shows the chlorophyll a fluorescence rise (Kautsky curves) observed in Arabidopsis wild-type and in the RNAi-P mutant plants. The normalized fluorescence yield is shown. From these curves it is possible to calculate the quantum yield of variable fluorescence (FV/FM). FV, the variable fluorescence, is equal to FM minus FO. For any given Kautsky curve of dark-adapted samples, FO is the minimal fluorescence observed upon onset of illumination and FM is the maximal amount of fluorescence observed. In Fig. 3A, FO and FM correspond to the points labeled O and P, respectively, for wild-type. These results are summarized in Table 1. Wild type exhibits a high quantum yield, whereas the RNAi-P mutants exhibit progressively lower quantum yields (WT > P11 > P1 > P8). In Synechocystis 6803, a strong correlation exists (r = 0.94) between the quantum yield of variable fluorescence (FV/FM) and the PS II content (25Chu H.-A. Nguyen A.P. Debus R.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6150-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) of wild-type and mutant strains. Because such a correlation has never been directly established in either green algae or higher plants, we view such an analysis as being only semiquantitative when applied to the higher plant system. With this caveat in mind, our results indicate that there appears to be a dramatic decrease in the quantity of fully functional PS II reaction centers in the phenotypic series of PsbP-deficient plants. This finding is fully consistent with the results obtained by Ifuku et al. (18Ifuku K. Yamamoto J. Ono T.-A. Ishihara S. Sato F. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 1175-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) in tobacco.TABLE 1Fluorescence induction characteristics of wild type and the RNAi-P mutantsStrainFV/FMPS IIαPS IIβα/β%Wild type0.78 ± 0.01aValues given are means ± 1.0 S.D., n = 3-6.56 ± 645 ± 61.2RNAi-P110.68 ± 0.04bp < 0.05 as compared with wild type using Student's t-test.48 ± 252 ± 20.9RNAi-P10.61 ± 0.03bp < 0.05 as compared with wild type using Student's t-test.55 ± 3345 ± 331.2RNAi-P80.42 ± 0.15bp < 0.05 as compared with wild type using Student's t-test.43 ± 2956 ± 290.8a Values given are means ± 1.0 S.D., n = 3-6.b p < 0.05 as compared with wild type using Student's t-test. Open table in a new tab Additionally, using a logarithmic timing series, a polyphasic fluorescence rise exhibiting the O-J-I-P transients was observed for the wild-type sample (26Strasser R.J. Govindjee Argyroudi-Akoyunoglou J.H. Regulation of Chloroplast Biogenesis. Plenum Press, New York1991: 423-426Google Scholar, 27Strasser R.J. Govindjee Murata N. Research in Photosynthesis. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1992: 29-32Google Scholar). An inspection of the curves shown in Fig. 3A reveals several interesting features. First, the O to J transition occurs with higher fluorescence yield in the RNAi-P mutants than in wild type. A phenotypic series is evident, with RNAi-P11 and -P1 being least affected and RNAi-P8 being most affected. This initial O-J transition constitutes the photochemical phase of the chlorophyll a fluorescence rise. This result indicates that electron transfer from QA– to QB is slowed in the mutant. This would result in an increased accumulation of QA– and consequently an increased fluorescence yield. This result is similar to, but less extreme than the effects of treatment with DCMU on the fluorescence induction curve (28Neubauer C. Schreiber U. Z. Naturforsch. [C]. 1987; 42: 1246-1254Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Second, in wild type the J and I transients appeared at 3 ms and 30 ms, respectively; however, in the RNAi-P mutants the J transient occurred earlier (∼2 ms), and there was a progressive loss of the I transient throughout the phenotypic series. In wild type the J to I transition accounted for 30% of the total fluorescence yield. However, in the RNAi-P plants there is a progressive loss of the J to I transition, with RNAi-P1 and -P11 being the least affected and RNAi-P8 being the most affected. Indeed, this latter plant exhibited essentially no J to I transition. This result may indicate a defect in the oxygen-evolving complex. A similar decrease in the magnitude of the J to I transition has been observed in treatments that damage the oxygen-evolving complex, such as mild Tris or heat treatment (29Schreiber G. Neubauer C. Z. Naturforsch. [C]. 1987; 42: 1255-1264Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and in plants that possess only the defective PsbO-2 protein in Arabidopsis (30Liu H. Frankel L.K. Bricker T.M. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 7607-7613Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the absence of the J to I transition may indicate a defect in the ability to form the QA– Q –B state (27Strasser R.J. Govindjee Murata N. Research in Photosynthesis. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1992: 29-32Google Scholar). It should be noted that these two explanations are not mutually exclusive, and both could, in principal, contribute to the loss of the J to I transition in the mutants. In both wild type and the RNAi-P mutants, the fluorescence signal started to rise at 30–40 ms, with all strains reaching the P level in 200–300 ms. Overall, the total fluorescence yield of the thermal phase (J to P transition) is progressively reduced (wild type > P11 = P1 > P8) in the RNAi-P mutants. Flash Fluorescence Induction—Fig. 3B shows the flash-induced fluorescence induction at a 1-μs time resolution in the absence of DCMU. The observed fluorescence rise is the result of the re-reduction by the oxygen-evolving complex of YZ, which is in equilibrium with the primary electron donor P680+ (40Debus R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1102: 269-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). The shape of this fluorescence rise contains information bearing on the amount of PS IIα and PS IIβ reaction centers present in the sample. Exponential fluorescence rise kinetics indicate that the antennae of individual PS II centers are not coupled (i.e. a characteristic of PS IIβ centers), while sigmoidal fluorescence rise kinetics indicate a high degree of interconnectivity between the antennae of PS II centers (i.e. a characteristic of PS IIα centers) (41Ettinger W.F. Theg S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 321-"

https://openalex.org/W2061458403,"Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) excises thymine from G·T mispairs and removes a variety of damaged bases (X) with a preference for lesions in a CpG·X context. We recently reported that human TDG rapidly excises 5-halogenated uracils, exhibiting much greater activity for CpG·FU, CpG·ClU, and CpG·BrU than for CpG·T. Here we examine the effects of altering the CpG context on the excision activity for U, T, FU, ClU, and BrU. We show that the maximal activity (kmax) for G·X substrates depends significantly on the 5′ base pair. For example, kmax decreases by 6-, 11-, and 82-fold for TpG·ClU, GpG·ClU, and ApG·ClU, respectively, as compared with CpG·ClU. For the other G·X substrates, the 5′-neighbor effects have a similar trend but vary in magnitude. The activity for G·FU, G·ClU, and G·BrU, with any 5′-flanking pair, meets and in most cases significantly exceeds the CpG·T activity. Strikingly, human TDG activity is reduced 102.3–104.3-fold for A·X relative to G·X pairs and reduced further for A·X pairs with a 5′ pair other than C·G. The effect of altering the 5′ pair and/or the opposing base (G·X versus A·X) is greater for substrates that are larger (bromodeoxyuridine, dT) or have a more stable N-glycosidic bond (such as dT). The largest CpG context effects are observed for the excision of thymine. The potential role played by human TDG in the cytotoxic effects of ClU and BrU incorporation into DNA, which can occur under inflammatory conditions and in the cytotoxicity of FU, a widely used anticancer agent, are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2098712238,"Transient potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) receptor is an ion channel receptor primarily localized on sensory nerves and activated by specific stimuli to initiate and amplify pain and inflammation, as typified by murine models of scald and arthritis. Little is known of the role of TRPV1 in sepsis, an infective disease associated with inflammation. Through use of a sublethal murine model of lipopolysaccharide-induced peritoneal sepsis, we provide novel evidence that genetic deletion of TRPV1 leads to an enhanced onset of various pathological components of systemic endotoxemia. Paired studies of TRPV1 knockout (KO) and wild-type mice demonstrate significantly enhanced hypotension (56+/-2% vs. 38+/-6% decrease in blood pressure, n=12), hypothermia (13+/-3% vs. 7+/-1% decrease in core temperature, n=6), and peritoneal exudate mediator levels (TNF-alpha, 0.78+/-0.2 vs. 0.38+/-0.1 ng/ml; nitrite, for NO, 35+/-10 vs. 15+/-3 microM; n=8) in TRPV1 KO mice, indicating loss of protective effect. Findings correlated with liver edema and raised plasma levels of aspartate aminotransferase in TRPV1 KO mice. These data suggest that TRPV1 may play an important regulatory role in sepsis independent of the major sensory neuropeptide substance P. The findings are relevant to developing strategies that increase the beneficial, and reduce the harmful, components of sepsis to prevent and treat this often fatal condition."

To bring this type of “chemical genetic” control to a wide range of proteins, we recently developed an experimental system in which the stability of a small protein domain expressed in mammalian cells depends on the presence of a high affinity ligand. This ligand-dependent stability is conferred to any fused partner protein. The FK506- and rapamycin-binding protein (FKBP12) has been the subject of extensive biophysical analyses, including both kinetic and thermodynamic studies of the wild-type protein as well as dozens of mutants. The goal of this study was to determine if the thermodynamic stabilities (ΔΔGU-F) of various amino acid substitutions within a given protein are predictive for engineering additional ligand-dependent destabilizing domains. We used FKBP12 as a model system and found that in vitro thermodynamic stability correlates weakly with intracellular degradation rates of the mutants and that the ability of a given mutation to destabilize the protein is context-dependent. We evaluated several new FKBP12 ligands for their ability to stabilize these mutants and found that a cell-permeable molecule called Shield-1 is the most effective stabilizing ligand. We then performed an unbiased microarray analysis of NIH3T3 cells treated with various concentrations of Shield-1. These studies show that Shield-1 does not elicit appreciable cellular responses.

Cell-permeable small molecules have long been powerful tools for interrogating biology (1Weisenberg R.C. Borisy G.G. Taylor W.E. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 4466-4478Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). They can be used to conditionally probe biological processes, often with high temporal resolution (2Liu J. Farmer J.D.

Interest in using perturbants of this type has grown significantly in the past decade, but one of the pressing questions remains. How can one discover a cell-permeable perturbant for any protein of interest? Nature was the source for many of the early examples, especially when the biologically relevant target of the perturbant was easily discerned. To accelerate the discovery process, many investigators are screening large libraries of small molecules either against purified proteins or against living cells using high content imaging and phenotype-based scoring to evaluate library members (5Yeh J.R.J. Crews C.M. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 11-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Irrespective of the discovery process used to identify the perturbant, the question of specificity remains critical for research biology (6Godl K. Wissing J. Kurtenbach A. Habenberger P. Blencke S. Gutbrod H. Salassidis K. Stein-Gerlach M. Missio A. Cotten M. Daub H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15434-15439Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). When a particular reagent is used to conditionally perturb a biological process, how confident can one be that the resulting phenotype can be ascribed to the putative molecular target of the perturbant? We have chosen an alternate strategy to provide small molecule control of any protein of interest (7Banaszynski L.A. Chen L.C. Maynard-Smith L.A. Ooi A.G.L. Wandless T.J. Cell. 2006; 126: 995-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Our approach relies upon one well characterized protein-ligand interaction that can be used to regulate many different proteins of interest. We have engineered small protein domains called destabilizing domains (DDs) 2The abbreviations used are: DDdestabilizing domainFKBP or FKBP12human 12-kDa FK506- and rapamycin-binding proteinHcRedred fluorescent protein from Heteractis crispaSAMsignificance analysis of microarraysSLFsynthetic ligand for FKBPYFPyellow fluorescent protein that are constitutively degraded when expressed in mammalian cells. This instability is conferred to any other protein fused to the DD. A high affinity ligand binds to the DD and prevents it from being degraded. This ligand-mediated stability allows the fused protein to perform its cellular function, provided that it is fully functional in the context of a fusion protein. Specificity is provided by the genetic fusion of the DD to the protein of interest, and speed, reversibility, and tunability are provided by the stabilizing ligand. destabilizing domain human 12-kDa FK506- and rapamycin-binding protein red fluorescent protein from Heteractis crispa significance analysis of microarrays synthetic ligand for FKBP yellow fluorescent protein One of the challenges to this approach is engineering the desired DDs. What is the most efficient procedure to take an otherwise stable protein-ligand pair and selectively perturb the protein structure to the point of instability in the absence of a ligand and stability in the ligand-bound state? In one approach, one can assume nothing and use an unbiased screening strategy to identify mutants of the protein that endow the structure with the desired ligand-dependent stability (7Banaszynski L.A. Chen L.C. Maynard-Smith L.A. Ooi A.G.L. Wandless T.J. Cell. 2006; 126: 995-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Alternatively, one can rely upon thermodynamic analyses of the protein, if available, to rationally choose mutations that might confer ligand-dependent stability. Another challenge for this strategy is the desire to use stabilizing ligands that do not perturb the cellular environment by binding to off-target proteins. In this study, we evaluate the ability of directed amino acid substitutions to confer ligand-dependent stability to a small protein domain. We also investigate the specificity of ligands that stabilize these domains. This comparison of two possible discovery processes (unbiased screening versus biophysics-guided engineering) will probably inform future attempts to develop new destabilizing domains. FKBP Mutant Generation—The retroviral vector pBMN FKBP-YFP-i-HcRed-tandem was assembled by ligating FKBP mutants into the pBMN YFP HA-i-HcRed-t vector. QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) was used to incorporate single point mutations into the FKBP-F36V gene. Double and triple mutants were obtained by sequential mutagenesis or PCR amplification. Transfection quality DNA was produced in Escherichia coli. Tissue Culture and Transfections—NIH3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated donor bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg of streptomycin. The ΦNX ecotropic packaging line was cultured with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg of streptomycin. The ΦNX cell line was transfected using standard Lipofectamine 2000 protocols. Viral supernatants were harvested 48 h post-transfection, filtered, and concentrated using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter (100-kDa cut-off; Millipore Corp.). NIH3T3 cells were incubated with the concentrated viral supernatant supplemented with 4 μg/ml Polybrene for 4 h at 37 °C. The viral supernatant was then removed, and fresh medium was added to the cells. Cells were cultured for 24 h to allow for viral integration. Flow Cytometry—Transduced NIH3T3 cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells/well of a 12-well plate and treated as described 24 h prior to analysis. Cells were removed from wells using trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen) and quenched with 1 ml of growth medium. The medium was removed, and cells were resuspended in 300 μl of PBS. Cells were analyzed at the Stanford Shared FACS Facility with 10,000 events represented. Antibodies—Immunoblotting was performed using the following antibodies: FKBP (mouse, 554091; BD Biosciences) and YFP, Aequorea victoria (JL-8; Clontech). Microarray Analysis—NIH3T3 cells were cultured in medium containing vehicle or 1 μm, 100 nm, or 10 nm Shield-1 for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen), labeled, and hybridized to the mouse exonic evidence-based oligonucleotide arrays. The hybridizations were performed by the Stanford Functional Genome Facility. After overnight hybridization at 65 °C, each array was washed and scanned using the GenePix 4000A microarray scanner (Axon Instruments). SAM was used to identify genes whose expression had significantly changed after treatment with Shield-1 (19Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9802) Google Scholar). A complete description of the experiment including data filtering and analysis is included in the supplemental material. FKBP Ligands—Reagents are available upon request. Shield-1 will be distributed to all qualified investigators. Human FKBP12 (hereafter called FKBP) has been the subject of numerous kinetic and thermodynamic analyses of protein folding and stability (8Main E.R.G. Fulton K.F. Jackson S.E.

In addition to the wild-type protein, the relative contributions of dozens of individual amino acid mutations to the stability of FKBP have been analyzed in vitro (8Main E.R.G. Fulton K.F. Jackson S.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 17: 6145-6153Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These biophysical studies provide a rich source of data with which to guide the “rational design” strategy for engineering ligand-dependent stability. Mutations in different regions of the protein that confer similar levels of instability can be tested to investigate the context dependence of this design strategy. Biologically active FKBP ligands (e.g. FK506 and rapamycin) exert their respective activities through FKBP and distinct partner proteins (2Liu J. Farmer J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3634) Google Scholar, 14Sabatini D.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Tempst P. Snyder S.H.

Nature. 1994; 369: 756-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (1673) Google Scholar). However, ligands that bind to FKBP alone are generally not considered to elicit significant responses when administered to cultured mammalian cells. To ensure greater specificity between protein and ligand, we chose the FKBP F36V mutant and a series of ligands pioneered by Dennis Holt and colleagues that possess a synthetic “bump” that occupies the cavity created by the F36V mutation (16Clackson T. Yang W. Rozamus L.W. Hatada M. Amara J.F. Rollins C.T. Stevenson L.F. Magari S.R. Wood S.A. Courage N.L. Lu X. Cerasoli F. Gilman M. Holt D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Clackson T. Holt D.A. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 1135-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These bumped ligands bind ∼1600-fold more tightly to the F36V mutant relative to wild-type FKBP. The F36V mutation is present in all proteins described in this study, and we identify mutants using only destabilizing amino acid changes (i.e.“V2A” denotes the V2A/F36V mutant). In order to test the stability of various mutants expressed in cultured cells, the FKBP F36V gene was cloned at either the N or C terminus of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), and site-specific mutations were introduced into the FKBP sequence. These chimeric genes were transduced into NIH3T3 cells using an Moloney murine leukemia virus-derived retroviral expression system to create clonally mixed populations of stably transduced cells. Analytical flow cytometry was used to quantitate the expression levels of the fusion proteins. We first examined the V2A, L50A, and L106A mutants that destabilize FKBP by 2.43, 2.57, and 2.32 kcal/mol, respectively (8Main E.R.G. Fulton K.F. Jackson S.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 17: 6145-6153Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These three mutants confer similar degrees of thermodynamic instability to the FKBP protein, although they are located in different environments (Fig. 1A). Expression levels of the parent F36V protein fused to YFP were similar to YFP alone; however, the V2A, L50A, and L106A FKBP mutants were all destabilizing when fused to either the N or C terminus of FKBP (Fig. 1B). FKBP mutants fused to the N terminus of YFP were more destabilizing than those fused at the C terminus. During our original screen for FKBP-derived destabilizing domains, we used a ligand called SLF* to stabilize FKBP (Fig. 2A) (7Banaszynski L.A. Chen L.C. Maynard-Smith L.A. Ooi A.G.L. Wandless T.J. Cell. 2006; 126: 995-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). In an attempt to improve the FKBP-stabilizing activity of SLF* we synthesized several variants by attaching solubilizing functional groups to a region of the ligand that does not affect binding to FKBP. These SLF* variants were then tested for their ability to stabilize the most destabilized of the fusion proteins, the V2A mutant fused to the N terminus of YFP (V2A-YFP). Cells expressing the V2A-YFP fusion protein were dosed with various concentrations of ligand 24 h prior to analysis by analytical flow cytometry. The original SLF* compound showed the lowest level of stabilization (Fig. 2B). The functional groups appended to SLF* all resulted in improved stabilizing activity, and the FKBP ligand possessing a morpholine group attached through an ether linkage proved to be most effective in rescuing the fusion protein. This ligand was named Shield-1, and further characterization of the interaction between Shield-1 and the V2A-YFP fusion protein revealed an EC50 of ∼60 nm (Fig. 2C). In order to probe the basis for the improved activity of the SLF* variants, we measured the dissociation constant between each ligand and the F36V protein (see supplemental Fig. 1). A fluorescence polarization-based competition binding assay revealed that the affinities of the four ligands for the F36V protein were experimentally indistinguishable (supplemental Fig. 1) (18Braun P.D. Wandless T.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5406-5413Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Fluorescence polarization was also used to measure the affinities of Shield-1 for the F36V parent protein as well as for the three mutants (supplemental Figs. 2 and 3). The dissociation constants of Shield-1 for the four proteins varied between 2 and4nm, suggesting that the different potencies of stabilization observed for the analogs are the result of differences in cellular permeability rather than differences in affinity for FKBP. We next tested all three FKBP mutants using Shield-1 as the stabilizing ligand. With the FKBP mutants fused to the N terminus of YFP, a 1 μm dose of Shield-1 fully stabilized YFP expression levels (Fig. 3A). A triple mutant incorporating all three destabilizing mutations showed very low expression with no detectable Shield-1 dependence (Fig. 3A). The FKBP mutants are not as destabilizing when they are fused to the C terminus of YFP (Fig. 3B). Shield-1 stabilizes the C-terminal fusions, although the expression levels do not quite reach those of the parent F36V protein. Treatment of the F36V parent fusion proteins with Shield-1 causes a modest rise in expression levels, suggesting that the binding of the ligand to the FKBP domain reduces the rate of degradation. When fused to the C terminus of YFP, the triple mutant (V2A/L50A/L106A) is not significantly more destabilizing then the V2A or L50A mutants, although stabilization of the triple mutant by Shield-1 is attenuated. Transduced cells were treated with either vehicle or Shield-1, and lysates were immunoblotted with antibodies against either FKBP12 or YFP (supplemental Fig. 4A). As expected, protein levels by Western blot correlate well with YFP levels measured by analytical flow cytometry, and no evidence of partial degradation was observed. Inhibition of the proteasome with lactacystin prevented degradation of the V2A-YFP fusion protein (supplemental Fig. 4B), which is consistent with our previous findings (7Banaszynski L.A. Chen L.C. Maynard-Smith L.A. Ooi A.G.L. Wandless T.J. Cell. 2006; 126: 995-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). To determine if additional destabilizing mutations would result in an additive effect on FKBP stability, we returned to the biophysical analyses and made further mutations at the N terminus of FKBP. The V4A and I7V mutations are destabilizing by 2.78 and 0.92 kcal/mol (8Main E.R.G. Fulton K.F. Jackson S.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 17: 6145-6153Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar), respectively, so we incorporated these into the FKBP F36V background in all possible combinations with the V2A mutation. These single, double, and triple mutants were fused to the N terminus of YFP and individually transduced into NIH3T3 cells, and YFP expression levels were measured in the absence and presence of 1 μm Shield-1 (Fig. 4A). Treatment with Shield-1 stabilized the expression levels of all seven mutants, and the most efficiently rescued mutants were the single point mutants, V2A and V4A, and the double mutants, V2A/I7V and V4A/I7V. These four mutants were further characterized to determine the rates of protein degradation upon removal of Shield-1 (Fig. 4B). The mutants that displayed the lowest expression levels in the absence of Shield-1 showed the fastest rate of protein degradation, with both double mutants returning to basal levels after 4 h. As a simple test of the potential generality of this destabilizing activity, we fused the V2A mutant to the N terminus of firefly luciferase. Firefly luciferase is stabilized by Shield-1 in a dose-responsive manner (supplemental Fig. 5A). As observed with the YFP reporter, Shield-1 treatment provides modest stabilization to the fusion of F36V to luciferase. In contrast, fusion of V2A to luciferase results in destabilization of the fusion protein, with expression levels and, in turn, luminescence rescued upon the addition of Shield-1 (supplemental Fig. 5B). A kinetic analysis showed that Shield-1 treatment causes maximum stabilization in 2–3 h and, further, that removal of Shield-1 from stabilized cells results in loss of luciferase expression in 1–2 h (supplemental Fig. 5, C and D). The ideal system to conditionally regulate protein expression levels using small molecules would utilize a stabilizing ligand that does not exhibit any off-target effects in a biological environment. In order to assess the ability of Shield-1 to perturb gene expression patterns, we treated NIH3T3 cells with vehicle or one of three concentrations of Shield-1 (10, 100, and 1000 nm). Each set of conditions was performed in triplicate, and following 24 h of Shield-1 treatment, RNA was isolated, processed, and used to probe mouse exonic evidence-based oligonucleotide arrays. We used significance analysis of microarray (SAM) to identify genes that were differentially expressed between the treated and mock-treated samples (19Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9802) Google Scholar). The microarrays were evaluated using a relatively high false discovery rate to identify as many perturbations to mRNA levels as possible. Using a false discovery rate of ≤27.5%, SAM identified four genes whose transcript levels were significantly altered in cells treated with 1 μm Shield-1 (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. 6A). The mRNA levels increased less than 3-fold for three of the four genes and decreased (11-fold) for the other gene. Using the same threshold, no transcript levels were significantly altered upon treatment with 100 nm Shield-1 (supplemental Fig. 6B). For cells treated with 10 nm Shield-1, SAM predicted five genes as significantly changed. The mRNA levels for all five genes decreased expression (<3-fold) compared with control. Notably, none of the five genes identified in 10 nm treated cells were perturbed in cells treated with higher concentrations of Shield-1.TABLE 1Effects of Shield-1 on gene expression in NIH3T3 cellsClone IDGene symbolGene description-Fold change (false discovery rate)aNIH3T3 cells in triplicate were cultured in medium and mock-treated or treated with 10 nm, 100 nm, or 1 μm Shield-1 for 24 h.

Open table in a new tab The ability to conditionally perturb the function of specific proteins using cell-permeable small molecules is a powerful technique with which to probe biological processes. We recently used an unbiased screening process to identify destabilizing domains based on FKBP (7Banaszynski L.A. Chen L.C. Maynard-Smith L.A. Ooi A.G.L. Wandless T.J. Cell. 2006; 126: 995-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). For the purposes of engineering new protein-ligand combinations that behave as DDs, we were interested in knowing the most efficient method to identify mutants of a protein that would display the desired ligand-dependent stability. The purpose of these studies was to determine if biophysics-based design is a competitive discovery method for engineering conditional instability, so we chose three mutants of the 107-residue FKBP protein that destabilize the protein fold to the same approximate degree. To test the context dependence of these mutations, we chose residues at the N terminus, in the middle, and at the C terminus of the protein. We further fused the FKBP mutants to either the N or the C terminus of the YFP reporter protein. If there were no context dependence to the induced instability, we might expect that all mutants would exhibit similar behavior, regardless of the placement of the destabilizing mutation within the structure of FKBP. The data shown in Fig. 3 suggest that there is a strong context dependence with respect to both the sites of mutation and the orientation of the fusion protein. FKBP mutants fused at the N terminus of YFP are more strongly destabilizing than C-terminal fusions. The higher efficiency with which the N-terminal fusions are degraded may reflect mechanistic differences in the quality control machinery monitoring protein stability. The nature of the amino substitution is also important. When fused at the N terminus of YFP, the L106P mutant is strongly destabilizing (1–2% expression in the absence of Shield-1) (7Banaszynski L.A. Chen L.C. Maynard-Smith L.A. Ooi A.G.L. Wandless T.J. Cell. 2006; 126: 995-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). However, the L106A mutation is only moderately destabilizing (25–30% expression in the absence of Shield-1). Within a given fusion protein orientation, (i.e. FKBP fused to the N terminus of YFP), we observed a positive, but weak, correlation between in vitro thermodynamic stability and intracellular stability in the context of a fusion protein. All of the mutants are destabilizing, but the extent of destabilization differs. The V2A, L50A, and L106A mutations are similarly destabilizing in terms of ΔΔGU-F; however, the expression levels of their YFP fusion proteins are 5, 11, and 25%, respectively, in the absence of Shield-1. Mammalian cells must be able to unfold proteins for degradation by ATP-dependent proteases as well as for translocation across some membranes (20Prakash S. Matouschek A. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 593-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). When analyzing the susceptibility of proteins to protease-mediated degradation, Matouschek and co-workers (21Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) have shown that the local structure of the substrate is more important than overall protein stability. They have also demonstrated that efficient proteasome-mediated degradation requires an unstructured region within the target protein to serve as an initiation site (22Prakash S. Tian L. Ratliff K.S. Lehotzky R.E. Matouschek A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 830-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Similar context-dependent effects have been observed by Kenniston et al. (23Kenniston J.A. Baker T.A. Fernandez J.M. Sauer R.T. Cell. 2003; 114: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) as well as Canet et al. (24Canet D. Last A.M. Tito P. Sunde M. Spencer A. Archer D.B. Redfield C. Robinson C.V. Dobson C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In light of these studies, it is possible that the mutations of the single domain FKBP protein regulate the different intracellular rates of degradation through specific local effects rather than global effects on protein stability. The effects of our destabilizing mutations appear to be additive. When we made additional mutations to the FKBP domain of the V2A-YFP fusion protein, we observed that a greater degree of instability was conferred relative to V2A alone (Fig. 4A). As we have observed previously, mutants that are strongly destabilizing exhibit faster degradation rates when Shield-1 is withdrawn (7Banaszynski L.A. Chen L.C. Maynard-Smith L.A. Ooi A.G.L. Wandless T.J. Cell. 2006; 126: 995-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Upon the addition of Shield-1, the rates of synthesis for the mutants are indistinguishable. In this respect, these FKBP-derived DDs function as ligand-dependent degrons that modulate the rate of degradation. It is the ratio of the rates of synthesis and degradation that govern the expression level of a given protein. Several new FKBP ligands were synthesized and tested as stabilizing ligands, and we observed that their potencies differed widely (Fig. 2B). The affinity of each ligand for the F36V protein was measured, and the dissociation constants are very similar (supplemental Fig. 1). This observation suggests that the range of stabilizing potencies results from different cellular permeabilities rather than underlying biophysical differences. Shield-1 binds equally well to the V2A, L50A, and L106A mutants, as expected. It is difficult to prove that Shield-1 is not binding to other proteins and causing cellular responses that are unrelated to FKBP fusion proteins. To probe the specificity of the interaction between Shield-1 and other cellular constituents, we used an unbiased microarray analysis to look for perturbations in gene expression patterns in NIH3T3 cells treated with different concentrations of Shield-1. We were particularly interested in genes whose expression exhibited dose-dependent changes in response to different concentrations of Shield-1. Using fairly liberal thresholds for significance, we found only a very small number of genes whose RNA levels changed appreciably relative to mock-treated control cells. Importantly, none of the gene expression changes were observed in all three concentrations of Shield-1 that were tested. These data support the notion that Shield-1 is relatively free of off-target perturbations to the cellular environment. Our findings are consistent with those of the Ariad group (25Iuliucci J.D. Oliver S.D. Morley S. Ward C. Ward J. Dalgarno D. Clackson T. Berger H.J. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 2001; 41: 870-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) that tested a structurally similar dimeric FKBP ligand in a Phase I human clinical trail. The ability to conditionally regulate a single protein of interest will probably provide many new insights into complex biological systems. However, many investigations would benefit from the ability to independently regulate the levels of two or more different proteins. For example, a method to separately control the intracellular expression levels of GSK-3α and GSK-3β would be useful for probing the potentially overlapping functions of these two kinases. The existence of two or more DD systems that are regulated by orthogonal small molecules would be useful, so what is the best discovery method to identify new DDs? Ligand-dependent stability can be engineered into FKBP using either biophysical data as detailed in this work or through screening an unbiased library of FKBP mutants (7Banaszynski L.A. Chen L.C. Maynard-Smith L.A. Ooi A.G.L. Wandless T.J. Cell. 2006; 126: 995-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). The biophysics-based design strategy delivers mutants that display the desired ligand-dependent stability, although the extent of destabilization conferred by the various mutants is not uniform or predictable. Additionally, the biophysical data required for this design strategy are not as widely available for other proteins as might be needed. Conversely, one can manipulate various parameters in a screening process (e.g. concentration of stabilizing ligand, incubation periods), to deliver mutants with specific characteristics. From this perspective, the unbiased screening strategy appears to be a more reliable strategy for engineering new destabilizing domains.

https://openalex.org/W1971524431,"Although Kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) is a transcription factor that has been implicated in pathways critical to carcinogenesis, controversy persists as to whether it functions as a tumor suppressor or as an oncogene. Here, we describe a novel role for KLF5 in a p53-independent apoptotic pathway. Using RNA-interference technology, we show that cells deficient in KLF5 have increased sensitivity to DNA damage, regardless of p53 status. Both p53 and p53-dependent factors are unaffected by KLF5 depletion. Instead, the apoptotic phenotype consequent to damage is associated with reduced bad phosphorylation, and downregulation of Pim1. Consistently, transfection of wild-type Pim1 is sufficient to rescue this phenotype. Previous data have shown a number of putative Sp1-binding consensus sequences on the Pim1 promoter. Remarkably, chromatin immunoprecipitation studies show that KLF5 binds to the Pim1 promoter, and that binding increases soon after damage. These results identify a novel, p53-independent apoptotic pathway through which KLF5 functions in response to DNA damage. Therapeutic deregulation of this pathway could be used to modulate chemosensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2055021873,"Gelsolin regulates the dynamic assembly and disassembly of the actin-based cytoskeleton in non-muscle cells and clears the circulation of filaments released following cell death. Gelsolin is a six-domain (G1-G6) protein activated by calcium via a multi-step process that involves unfolding from a compact form to a more open form in which the three actin-binding sites (on the G1, G2, and G4 subdomains) become exposed. To follow the global structural changes that accompany calcium activation of gelsolin, small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) data were collected for full-length human plasma gelsolin at nanomolar to millimolar concentrations of free Ca2+. Analysis of these data showed that, upon increasing free Ca2+ levels, the radius of gyration (Rg) increased nearly 12 Å, from 31.1 ± 0.3 to 43 ± 2 Å, and the maximum linear dimension (Dmax) of the gelsolin molecule increased 55 Å, from 100 to 155Å. Structural reconstruction of gelsolin from these data provided a striking visual tracking of the gradual Ca2+-induced opening of the gelsolin molecule and highlighted the critical role played by the flexible linkers between homologous domains. The tightly packed architecture of calcium-free gelsolin, seen from both SAXS and x-ray crystallographic models, is already partially opened up in as low as 0.5 nm Ca2+. Our data confirm that, although the molecule springs open from 0 to 1 μm free Ca2+, even higher calcium concentrations help to stabilize a more open structure, with increases in Rg and Dmax of ∼2 and ∼15 Å, respectively. At these higher calcium levels, the SAXS-based models provide a molecular shape that is compatible with that of the crystal structures solved for Ca2+/gelsolin C-terminal and N-terminal halves ± monomeric G-actin. Placement of these crystal structures within the boundaries of the SAXS-based model suggests a movement of the G1/G2 subunits that would be required upon binding to actin.

Analysis of these data showed that, upon increasing free Ca2+ levels, the radius of gyration (Rg) increased nearly 12 Å, from 31.1 ± 0.3 to 43 ± 2 Å, and the maximum linear dimension (Dmax) of the gelsolin molecule increased 55 Å, from 100 to 155Å. Structural reconstruction of gelsolin from these data provided a striking visual tracking of the gradual Ca2+-induced opening of the gelsolin molecule and highlighted the critical role played by the flexible linkers between homologous domains. The tightly packed architecture of calcium-free gelsolin, seen from both SAXS and x-ray crystallographic models, is already partially opened up in as low as 0.5 nm Ca2+. Our data confirm that, although the molecule springs open from 0 to 1 μm free Ca2+, even higher calcium concentrations help to stabilize a more open structure, with increases in Rg and Dmax of ∼2 and ∼15 Å, respectively. At these higher calcium levels, the SAXS-based models provide a molecular shape that is compatible with that of the crystal structures solved for Ca2+/gelsolin C-terminal and N-terminal halves ± monomeric G-actin. Placement of these crystal structures within the boundaries of the SAXS-based model suggests a movement of the G1/G2 subunits that would be required upon binding to actin. Gelsolin, an ∼80-kDa globular protein, exists as a cytoplasmic as well as a plasma isoform and is encoded by a single gene on chromosome 9 (1Yin H.L. Kwiatkowski D.J. Mole J.E. Cole F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5271-5276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kwiatkowski D.J. Mehl R. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Gelsolin functions to regulate the dynamic assembly and disassembly of the actin-based cytoskeleton by severing F-actin and remaining capped at the fast-growing end of the filament. In addition, gelsolin also initiates formation of F-actin by binding two monomeric G-actin molecules. In vivo studies on gelsolin, particularly using gelsolin-null mice and/or fibroblasts, have identified its critical role in many processes involving cell motility or cortical shape changes (for recent reviews, see Refs. 3Silacci P.

These physiological activities of gelsolin are predominantly regulated by Ca2+ levels and phosphoinositides (reviewed in Ref. 5Kwiatkowski D.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Gelsolin consists of six homologous subdomains (designated G1-G6) (6Burtnick L.D. Koepf E.K. Grimes J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I.

Cell. 1997; 90: 661-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) that appear to have evolved through a gene triplication process followed by an additional duplication (7Kwiatkowski D.J.

Hence, gelsolin has been considered as two domain triplets of the N- and C-terminal halves (G1-G3 and G4-G6, respectively) separated by a g3-g4 linker sequence that makes up ∼8% of the total molecular mass, or ∼70 amino acids long (6Burtnick L.D.

Both the cytoplasmic and plasma isoforms have nanomolar and micromolar affinity Ca2+-binding sites (7Kwiatkowski D.J. Strossel T.P. Orkin S.H. Mole J.E. Coltan H.R. Yin H.L. Nature. 1986; 323: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 11Kiselar J.G. Janmey P.A. Almo S.C. Chance M.R. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 1120-1132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the full-length horse plasma gelsolin in the Ca2+-free inactive form (Protein Data Bank code 1D0N) confirms that the six subdomains are structurally homologous and fold together to adopt a compact globular shape (6Burtnick L.D. Koepf E.K. Grimes J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. McLaughlin P.J. Robinson R.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 661-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In this structure, the two halves of gelsolin are held together by extensive interactions between a C-terminal helical extension of the G6 subdomain (often referred to as the C-terminal latch) and the F-actin-binding helix found in the G2 subdomain. As expected, the actin-binding regions of the G1, G2, and G4 subdomains are buried. It was proposed that Ca2+ binding disrupts the interactions between the N- and C-terminal halves, enabling each half to bind actin relatively independently (6Burtnick L.D. Koepf E.K. Grimes J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. McLaughlin P.J. Robinson R.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 661-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). To date, no high resolution structure of full-length plasma gelsolin, either fully or partially activated by Ca2+, has been reported. Most of the structural interpretation at atomic detail regarding a Ca2+-activated structure of gelsolin has been derived from crystal structures of Ca2+-bound N- and C-terminal halves of gelsolin: the Ca2+-activated C-terminal half of gelsolin in both the presence (Protein Data Bank code 1H1V) (12Choe H. Burtnick L.D. Mejillano M. Yin H.L. Robinson R.C. Choe S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and absence (Protein Data Bank codes 1NPH and 1P8X) (13Kolappan S. Gooch J.T. Weeds A.G. McLaughlin P.J. J. Mol.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 552: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) of actin and the Ca2+-activated N-terminal half of gelsolin bound to actin (15Burtnick L.D. Urosev D. Irobi E. Narayan K. Robinson R.C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2713-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In both the absence and presence of Ca2+ ions, the basic architecture of the six homologous domains is a central five-stranded mixed β-sheet sandwiched by two α-helices, one longer one running parallel to and another shorter one running almost perpendicular to the β-sheets. Based on the Ca2+-activated structures, it has been inferred that, although intradomain tertiary structural content remains almost unchanged, a rearrangement in the relative orientation of the six domains is induced upon chelating to Ca2+ ions. The similarity between the crystal structures of the Ca2+-bound C-terminal half of gelsolin in the presence and absence of actin provides evidence that Ca2+ ions alone can induce the actin-binding “open” form of this half of the molecule (14Narayan K. Chumnarnsilpa S. Choe H. Irobi E. Urosev D. Lindberg U. Schutt C.E. Burtnick L.D. Robinson R.C. FEBS Lett. 2003; 552: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Additional structural information on the conformational dynamics of ligand-induced structural changes in full-length gelsolin has been provided by dynamic light scattering (17Patkowski A. Seils J. Hinssen H. Dorfmuller T. Biopolymers. 1990; 30: 427-435Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 18Pope B.J. Gooch J.T. Weeds A.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15848-15855Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), circular dichroism (18Pope B.J. Gooch J.T. Weeds A.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15848-15855Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and radiolytic footprinting (11Kiselar J.G. Janmey P.A. Almo S.C. Chance M.R. Mol. Cell.

A. 2003; 100: 3942-3947Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) studies. Dynamic light scattering results revealed that the hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of gelsolin increases from 3.9 to 4.5 nm upon addition of Ca2+ up to 1 mm to an EGTA-containing solution (18Pope B.J. Gooch J.T. Weeds A.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15848-15855Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This observed increase in Rh was shown to be reversible from 10 μm Ca2+ upon chelation with added EGTA. These dynamic light scattering studies concluded that, in solution, the compact Ca2+-free gelsolin molecule opens upon binding Ca2+ following a sigmoidal relationship, which is reversible and in which 50% “activation” occurs with 30 nm Ca2+, whereas a maximum Rh is reached at ∼1 μm Ca2+ (18Pope B.J. Gooch J.T. Weeds A.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15848-15855Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This observed reversibility is also supported by recent EGTA chelation studies on different crystalline forms of the Ca2+-activated N- and C-terminal halves of gelsolin whereby the sub-domains rearranged toward the compact inactive form (20Chumnarnsilpa S. Loonchanta A. Xue B. Choe H. Urosev D. Wang H. Lindberg U. Burtnick L.D. Robinson R.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 773-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Critical insight into the Ca2+ activation process of full-length gelsolin in solution was provided by Kiselar et al. (19Kiselar J.G. Janmey P.A. Almo S.C. Chance M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3942-3947Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), who used a radiolytic footprinting technique to probe the changes in surface-exposed residues on gelsolin as a function of free Ca2+. This study supports a three-stage structural activation of gelsolin beginning with the Ca2+-free state showing a shift in conformation toward the second state occurring at ≈0.1 to ∼5 μm Ca2+ and a midpoint at ∼0.5 μm Ca2+, which evolves into a third structural state at ≈10 μm to1mm Ca2+ and a midpoint at ∼100 μm Ca2+. This three-state model explains the increased depolymerizing activity of F-actin at higher Ca2+ levels in plasma compared with intracellular levels, which would be maintained below 10 μm free Ca2+. We present here the global structural changes that accompany calcium activation of full-length gelsolin from nano- to millimolar concentrations as detected by small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). 2The abbreviation used is:SAXSsmall-angle x-ray scattering. 2The abbreviation used is:SAXSsmall-angle x-ray scattering.

Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant human plasma gelsolin was prepared according to previously described methods (21Yu F.X. Zhou D.M. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19269-19275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, human plasma gelsolin cDNA was cloned into pET3a expression vectors. Expressed gelsolin was obtained by solubilizing inclusion bodies with 8 m urea, followed by purification employing anion and cation exchange chromatographies (21Yu F.X. Zhou D.M. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19269-19275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar), and purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE. To ensure monodispersity of our SAXS sample, devoid of any higher molecular mass entity, immediately prior to the SAXS experiments, gelsolin was further purified by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 column on an LCC-501 PLUS FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The protein was eluted under Ca2+-free conditions using buffer composed of 25 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The anticipated retention volume for gelsolin was estimated using known protein standards. Gelsolin eluted as a single peak, which was collected and concentrated using Centricon concentrators. The final concentration was determined spectrophotometrically to be 10 mg/ml using A280 = 1.24 (23Kurokawa H. Fujii W. Ohmi K. Sakurai T. Nonomura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Four sample concentrations (10, 5, 2.5, and 1 mg/ml) were made by dilution of the 10 mg/ml stock. A limited number of Ca2+ concentration experiments were repeated with plasma gelsolin extracted from bovine plasma (Pel-Freez Biologicals, Rogers, AR) employing a slightly modified ion exchange protocol published by Kurokawa et al. (23Kurokawa H. Fujii W. Ohmi K. Sakurai T. Nonomura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and following it with an S200 gel filtration step. Sample Preparation for SAXS Experiment—Given a final sample volume of 50 μl in the buffer conditions mentioned above, free and total calcium levels were estimated using WEB-MAXC Version 2.1 (www.stanford.edu/~cpatton/maxc.html). Required amount of CaCl2 to obtain the desired free Ca2+ concentration was dried in the bottom of Eppendorf tubes. These tubes were prepared in duplicate. Just prior to SAXS experiments, diluted gelsolin stock (final concentration of 2 mg/ml) was added to the tubes containing Ca2+ and mixed thoroughly. Matched buffers (the S200 elution buffer) for each sample were prepared in a similar way. The free Ca2+ concentration was varied from 0 to 1 mm. SAXS Data Acquisition and Analysis—SAXS data were collected at beamline X21 at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory. 50 μl of each sample and its matched buffer were exposed to x-rays for 5 min at 10 °C. Scattering images were collected using a charge-coupled device detector (MarUSA Inc., Evanston, IL). The center of the beam on the detector and the sample-to-detector distance were predetermined using the scattering pattern of silver behenate powder. Images were circularly averaged, buffer-subtracted, and scaled to obtain relative scattering intensity (I) as a function of momentum transfer vector q (q = 4πs in θ/λ). For monodisperse globular proteins, a plot of ln(I(q)) versus q2 at low q, generally where q× Rg ≤ 1, will be linear and will fit to Equation 1. I(q)=I0e^((−Rg2q2/3))(Eq. 1) Such analysis is known as Guinier analysis and provides an estimation of the scattering particle's radius of gyration (Rg) and forward or zero-angle scatter (I0) from the slope (-R 2g/3) and the y intercept I0. Guinier analysis of all scattering data was done using the Primus software package (24Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H.J. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2342) Google Scholar). To ensure monodispersity of the sample, the I0 values derived from x-ray scattering data of the gelsolin samples were compared with those of a standard protein (lysozyme) (25Krigbaum W.R. Kugler F.R. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 1216-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) measured in the same sample cell on the same day. Indirect Fourier transformation of the scattering data over the measured q range gives a pairwise distribution function of interatomic vectors (P(r)). The inverse Fourier transform of I(q) yields P(r), which is the frequency of vector lengths connecting small-volume elements within the entire volume of the scattering particle (Equation 2). P(r)=(1/2π2)∫I(q)q⋅r sin(q⋅r)dq(Eq. 2) P(r) goes to zero at the maximum linear dimension of the particle (Dmax). Rg and forward scatter (I0) were calculated from the second and zeroth moments of P(r), respectively. Rg is defined as the root mean square of all elemental volumes from the center of mass of the particle, weighted by their scattering densities. I0 is directly proportional to the molar particle concentration multiplied by the square of the scattering particle's molecular weight for particles with the same mean scattering density. The GNOM45 software package (26Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2948) Google Scholar) was used for all P(r) analysis. For all analyses, an equal number of data points, ranging from q of 0.015-0.25 Å-1, were used. Ab Initio Modeling—A three-dimensional scattering shape for each gelsolin sample that best fit the corresponding SAXS intensity data was generated using GASBOR22IQ software (27Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H.J. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). Structure regeneration using no shape or symmetry bias and 800 dummy residues (packing radius of 1.9 Å each) was used to model all data sets for the Ca2+ activation of full-length gelsolin. A Fibonacci grid order of 15 (988 water molecules) was used to add the hydration layer around the chain ensemble. Each calculation was repeated five times with comparable results, each with χ2 ∼ 1 (supplemental Fig. 1). Of these, the structure with the solution with the lowest final χ2 value (see Ref. 27Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H.J. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar) of the modeled I(q) profile to the raw data is presented herein. The resultant low resolution shapes for gelsolin in EGTA and in 1 mm Ca2+ were aligned with known crystal structures of full-length gelsolin (Protein Data Bank code 1D0N) and the Ca2+-activated halves (Protein Data Bank codes 1H1V and 1RGI) using SUPCOMB13 (28Kozin M.B. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 33-41Crossref Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). CRYSOL26 (29Svergun D. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2766) Google Scholar) was used to estimate Rg, Rh, and scattering envelope volumes of the modeled shapes. Monodispersity of EGTA/Gelsolin Samples—Extraction of structural information on individual proteins or protein complexes in solution from scattering data requires samples that are rigorously aggregation-free. The zero-angle or forward scattering (I0) is directly proportional to the mass of the scattering particle squared; therefore, it is extremely sensitive to any aggregation or high molecular weight contaminants (25Krigbaum W.R. Kugler F.R. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 1216-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Any concentration (or time)-dependent aggregation would show an increase in I0, whereas any interparticle interference effects would show a decrease in I0 as a function of concentration (or time). Concentration-dependent aggregation of the EGTA/gelsolin from 1 to 10 mg/ml was determined to be negligible. Log I(q) versus log q plots of the 10, 5, 2.5, and 1 mg/ml gelsolin samples exhibit characteristic profiles for a compact globular scattering particle in solution (Fig. 1A). The linearity of the Guinier region of these data sets extrapolates to I0 values that demonstrate no detectable increase or decrease in I0/c as a function of gelsolin concentration (Fig. 1B, inset; and Table 1).TABLE 1Structural parameters determined for EGTA/gelsolin samples using Guinier approximation and indirect Fourier transformation of SAXS data[Gelsolin]Guinier analysis, RgIndirect Fourier transformationDmaxRgIoIo/cÅÅÅcm−110 mg/ml29.4 ± 0.210029.8 ± 0.1121.3 ± 0.412.15 mg/ml29.8 ± 0.310030.3 ± 0.263.7 ± 0.312.72.5 mg/ml30.9 ± 0.710031.3 ± 0.327.7 ± 0.211.11 mg/ml31.9 ± 1.410031.5 ± 0.712.1 ± 0.212.1 Open table in a new tab Indirect Fourier transformation of the intensity data sets over the q range of 0.015-0.25 Å-1 was used to estimate the pairwise distance distribution curves (P(r)) of the scattering vectors (Fig. 1C). All four samples solved for a Dmax value equal to ∼100 Å. The I0 and Rg values calculated from the first and second moments of the respective P(r) profiles were identical, within error, for each concentration (Table 1). Together, the scattering intensity profile, Guinier approximation, and parameters from estimated P(r) clearly showed that, during data acquisition, our recombinant gelsolin samples, under EGTA conditions, were monodisperse in nature. Ca2+ Titration of EGTA/Gelsolin Scattering Data—The increasing slope seen in intensity profiles of the gelsolin scattering data (Fig. 2A) for solutions with increasing levels of free Ca2+ from 0.5 nm to1mm is indicative of a protein that is becoming larger. Each of these Ca2+/gelsolin data sets also exhibit characteristic profiles for a compact globular scattering particle in solution. The decreasing q range spanning the linear Guinier regions is further evidence of the increased particle size upon titration with Ca2+ (Fig. 2B). Analysis of the pairwise distance distribution curves estimated for these Ca2+-containing samples (Fig. 2C) revealed an increase in the Rg of ∼12 Å with a concomitant increase in the Dmax values from 100 to 155 Å (Table 2). Furthermore, comparable I0/c values were calculated for these samples, indicating that the observed change in size is attributed entirely to a difference in macromolecular dimensions of the scattering particle and not due to any intermolecular aggregation events.TABLE 2Structural parameters determined for 2 mg/ml gelsolin samples at the indicated free pCa levels using Guinier approximation and indirect Fourier transformation of SAXS datapCaGuinier analysis, RgIndirect Fourier transformationDmaxRgIoIo/cÅÅÅcm−1EGTA30.9 ± 0.79831.1 ± 0.322.2 ± 0.311.19.332.0 ± 0.910831.5 ± 0.920.3 ± 0.310.28.431.1 ± 0.910230.7 ± 0.520.7 ± 0.310.47.434.7 ± 0.913534.6 ± 2.320.9 ± 0.610.55.738.0 ± 1.013840.1 ± 1.824.1 ± 0.612.04.338.2 ± 1.114042.3 ± 1.521.0 ± 0.510.54.038.0 ± 1.015844.3 ± 1.222.3 ± 0.511.23.338.4 ± 1.116246.1 ± 1.719.6 ± 0.69.823.037.5 ± 1.115543.5 ± 1.920.6 ± 0.610.3 Open table in a new tab Ca2+ Activation of Gelsolin—The observed increment in the Dmax and Rg values of recombinant human gelsolin upon binding calcium has been plotted as a function of estimated free calcium levels in Fig. 3. It is evident from this plot that there exist three distinct populations of molecular conformations within the time-averaged ensemble of structures: one at nanomolar [Ca2+]free exhibits a significantly different average conformation than that of the EGTA structure; a second conformation, considerably more open than the EGTA structure, is observed at intermediate Ca2+ levels where the [Ca2+]free/[gelsolin] molar ratio is below 4:1; and a final population that represents the fully activated Ca2+/gelsolin structure ([Ca2+]free/[gelsolin] ≥ 6:1). Our SAXS-based analysis suggests that an initial conformational change occurs in samples with up to ∼10 nm free Ca2+. Assuming that the measured data at these low [Ca2+]free represent a single predominant structure, the change from the compact EGTA structure would involve only a slight opening of the molecule, as the average structure is only 5-10 Å longer in Dmax to 102 ± 5 Å, whereas the average overall Rg for the ensemble remains close to 30 Å. It should be noted that, because SAXS measures the time-averaged ensemble in solution, it is possible that the observed changes in SAXS at these low [Ca2+]free is reflective not of a single predominant structure but rather of an averaging between a subset of gelsolin molecules that have been partially activated and the larger set that remain inactive. In any case, these data at nanomolar [Ca2+]free are distinctly different from those on the calcium-chelated EGTA/gelsolin sample. In samples immediately above 10 nm free Ca2+, a conspicuous change in the average conformation of gelsolin molecules is evidenced as an opening of this compact shape to ∼138Åin linear dimension and an Rg of ∼40 Å. A two-step sigmoidal fit to the data suggests that this abrupt opening of the structure may begin at ∼10 nm and is complete by a [Ca2+]free ∼ 0.1 or 1 μm. The predominant structure observed at 0.1-10 μm free Ca2+ (the second population) is characterized by an Rg of ∼40 Å and a Dmax just under 140 Å. Further unwinding of this structure initiates at [Ca2+]free ∼ 10 μm, in which gelsolin reaches its maximum open state ([Ca2+]free/[gelsolin] ≥ 6:1) by 200 μm with an Rg of ∼45 Å and a Dmax ∼ 155 Å. This final population of Ca2+-induced opening or activation was observed up to a free calcium level of 1 mm and therefore likely represents a single predominant Ca2+-saturated structure. Consistent with the observed Ca2+-dependent structural changes within recombinant human gelsolin, SAXS experiments repeated using bovine plasma gelsolin at similar protein concentrations and at calcium levels ranging from 20 nm to 40 μm followed a similar trend in dimensional change (Fig. 3). Further increments in [Ca2+]free up to 30 mm using both x-ray and neutron scattering (small-angle neutron scattering) as well as several independent experiments showed no further increments in the Rg and Dmax values beyond those observed at [Ca2+]free ∼ 1mm (supplemental Figs. 2 and 3 and Table 1). Also, using bovine plasma gelsolin at 1.25 mm free Ca2+ and titrating back with EGTA, we have confirmed that these structural changes are reversible (data not shown). A three-stage Ca2+ activation of gelsolin was first proposed by Kiselar et al. (11Kiselar J.G. Janmey P.A. Almo S.C. Chance M.R. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 1120-1132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 19Kiselar J.G. Janmey P.A. Almo S.C. Chance M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3942-3947Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) based upon synchrotron radiolytic foot-printing experiments. Analysis of these radiolysis data revealed changes in surface-exposed amino acid residues as a function of [Ca2+]free. Analyses of our SAXS data are consistent with this three-stage hypothesis and thus provide details on the predominant structures of the intermediate Ca2+-bound states supported by this hypothesis. The Ca2+-induced global conformational changes within the intact gelsolin molecule can be envisioned from shape restoration of our SAXS data. Visual Insight into the Ca2+ Activation of Full-length Gelsolin—Results from ab initio molecular modeling of the SAXS data are presented in Fig. 4. As described under “Materials and Methods,” all structures were restored employing 800 dummy residues and a grid order of 15. The “best fit” solutions of each data set, as defined by the lowest final χ value fit between the computed I(q) of the model and the raw data (Table 3), are shown in Fig. 4. The color scheme used to depict these models is the same as that used for the SAXS data and P(r) curves shown in Fig. 2. These gelsolin models demonstrate the gradual opening of the structure as a function of decreasing pCa levels, from EGT"

Here we show evidence that these deficits are mediated by persistent encoding of outdated associative information in the basolateral amygdala. Cue-selective neurons in the basolateral amygdala, recorded in cocaine-treated rats, failed to change cue preference during reversal learning. Further, the presence of these neurons was critical to the expression of the reversal-learning deficit in the cocaine-treated rats."
https://openalex.org/W2050040219,"The onset of anaphase is triggered by the activation of a site-specific protease called separase. Separase cleaves the chromosomal cohesins holding the duplicated sister chromatids together, allowing sisters to simultaneously separate and segregate to opposite ends of the cell before division. Activated separase cleaves not only cohesin, but also itself; however, the biological significance of separase self-cleavage has remained elusive. Before anaphase, separase is inhibited by at least two mechanisms. The first involves the binding of securin, whereas the second requires the phosphorylation-dependent binding of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1)/cyclin B1. Because securin and Cdk1/cyclin B1 interact with separase in a mutually exclusive manner, the degradation of both these inhibitors plays an important role in activating separase at anaphase. Here we identify a new separase interacting partner, a specific subtype of the heterotrimeric protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). PP2A associates with separase through the B′ (B56) regulatory subunit and does so independently of securin and cyclin B1 binding. The association of PP2A with separase requires a 55-amino acid domain closely juxtaposed to separase autocleavage sites. Strikingly, mutation of these cleavage sites increases PP2A binding, suggesting that separase cleavage disrupts the interaction of PP2A with separase. Furthermore, expression of a non-cleavable separase, but not a non-cleavable mutant that cannot bind PP2A, causes a premature loss of centromeric cohesion. Together these observations provide a new mechanistic insight into a physiological function for separase self-cleavage.

Each time a cell divides it must first faithfully duplicate its chromosomes and then accurately distribute the sister chromatids between the two daughter cells. After their generation during S phase, sister chromatids are held together through the action of the multisubunit chromosomal cohesion complex (1Guacci V. Koshland D. Strunnikov A. Cell. 1997; 91: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 2Michaelis C. Ciosk R. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1997; 91: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). During mitosis, cohesin is dissolved, and sister chromatids are segregated toward opposite ends of the cell. In all eukaryotes studied chromosome segregation is initiated by the activation of a site-specific protease known as separase (3Uhlmann F. Lottspeich F. Nasmyth K. Nature. 1999; 400: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 4Uhlmann F. Wernic D. Poupart M.A. Koonin E.V. Nasmyth K. Cell. 2000; 103: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Separase cleaves the cohesins linking each duplicated chromatid pair, allowing sisters to separate simultaneously at anaphase. Because the separation of sister chromatids is an irreversible event, it is clearly vital that separase activation is tightly regulated; activation before the correct attachment of all chromosomes on the microtubule spindle risks chromosome missegregation and the production of aneuploid daughter cells (5Kops G.J. Weaver B.A. Cleveland D.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 773-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Curiously, upon activation, vertebrate separase cleaves not only cohesin but also itself. Cleavage occurs at three closely spaced sites in between separase conserved C-terminal catalytic domain and its large N-terminal portion (6Waizenegger I. Gimenez-Abian J.F. Wernic D. Peters J.M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1368-1378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 7Zou H. Stemman O. Anderson J.S. Mann M. Kirschner M.W. FEBS. Lett. 2002; 528: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Once cleaved, the N- and C-terminal fragments of separase remain associated and are catalytically active. However, separase cleavage is not required for separase activation in vitro. Thus, despite the conservation of separase cleavage sites in vertebrates, the cellular function of this regulation has remained largely mysterious. Recently, human HCT-116 cells were generated in which all but one of the six endogenous separase cleavage sites were mutated (8Papi M. Berdougo E. Randall C.L. Ganguly S. Jallepalli P.V. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1029-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These cells delayed entry into mitosis and exhibited chromosome alignment defects. However, how separase cleavage acts to promote mitotic entry and progression through mitosis remains unclear. For most of the cell cycle, separase is bound by its chaperone securin, which inhibits separase proteolytic activity (9Funabiki H. Kumada K. Yanagida M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6617-6628Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 10Ciosk R. Zachariae W. Michaelis C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1998; 93: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Once all chromosomes have bioriented, securin is targeted for proteasomal degradation by the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome, thereby liberating and activating separase (11Cohen-Fix O.

Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1125-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, securin is not an essential gene in mice, and human cells lacking securin execute mitosis normally (17Mei J. Huang X. Zhang P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1197-1201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 18Wang Z. Yu R. Melmed S. Mol.

PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e416Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This strongly suggests securin-independent mechanisms are able to inhibit separase. Indeed, a second regulatory mechanism has been described in vertebrates and is mediated by the Cdk1/cyclin B1 protein kinase (20Stemmann O. Zou H. Gerber S.A. Gygi S.P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 2001; 107: 715-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 21Gorr I.H. Boos D. Stemmann O. Mol.

Cdk1 phosphorylates separase on serine 1126 during mitosis (20Stemmann O. Zou H. Gerber S.A. Gygi S.P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 2001; 107: 715-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), thereby promoting the stable binding of Cdk1/cyclin B1 to separase via the cyclin B1 subunit (21Gorr I.H. Boos D. Stemmann O. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 135-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 22Holland A.J. Taylor S.S. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3325-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Importantly, securin and Cdk1/cyclin B1 bind separase in a mutually exclusive manner (21Gorr I.H. Boos D. Stemmann O. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 135-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 22Holland A.J. Taylor S.S. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3325-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), suggesting that these two mechanisms may play redundant roles in inhibiting separase during mitosis. Thus, at least in vertebrates, the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome triggers separase activation through the concomitant destruction of securin and cyclin B1. We recently investigated the role Ser-1126 phosphorylation and cyclin B1 binding plays in inhibiting separase in human cells. By stably expressing a non-phosphorylatable S1126A (S:A) 4The abbreviations used are: Cdkcyclin-dependent kinasePP2Aprotein phosphatase 2AMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flightS:AS1126AC:AC2029AGSTglutathione S-transferaseWTwild typeHAhemagglutininTettetracyclineMImitotic indexFRTFlp recombinase target mutant of separase above endogenous securin levels, we were able to create a situation in which cyclin B1-mediated inhibition of separase becomes essential for accurate chromosome segregation (22Holland A.J. Taylor S.S. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3325-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, despite overriding both securin- and cyclin B1-mediated inhibition of separase, cells expressing non-phosphorylatable separase still aligned most of their chromosomes at metaphase, with premature sister chromatid disjunction occurring just 5 min before control cells. Because human cells lacking cohesin fail to align their chromosomes at all (23Toyoda Y. Yanagida M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2287-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), it appears that cohesion is still maintained during early mitosis in separase S:A cells. This suggests that mechanisms other than securin- and cyclin B1-mediated inhibition of separase are able to protect cohesin from cleavage. Consistent with this notion, securin–/– mouse embryonic stem cells expressing a non-phosphorylatable separase allele are viable and appear to divide normally (24Huang X. Hatcher R. York J.P. Zhang P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4725-4732Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). cyclin-dependent kinase protein phosphatase 2A matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight S1126A C2029A glutathione S-transferase wild type hemagglutinin tetracycline mitotic index Flp recombinase target If a novel mechanism is able to regulate cohesin cleavage, then it is possible that this pathway acts directly upon separase to regulate its proteolytic activity. To investigate the possibility that a protein other than securin and cyclin B1 is able to regulate separase activation, we set out to identify novel separase-associated proteins. Here, we show that separase binds protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) via a direct interaction with PP2A regulatory B subunit. We define a 55-amino acid domain required for the association of PP2A and show that separase autocleavage disrupts PP2A binding. Together, these observations provide new insight into a physiological function of separase self-cleavage. Molecular Cloning and DNA Manipulations—All separase constructs except for ZZ-Tev-Separase (20Stemmann O. Zou H. Gerber S.A. Gygi S.P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 2001; 107: 715-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) were cloned into pcDNA5/FRT/TO/Myc as previously described (22Holland A.J. Taylor S.S. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3325-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The S1126A, C2029A, LAG, and Δ12 mutants were as described (22Holland A.J. Taylor S.S. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3325-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A non-cleavable mutant (E1483R, R1486E, E1503R, R1506E, E1532R, R1535E (6Waizenegger I. Gimenez-Abian J.F. Wernic D. Peters J.M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1368-1378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar)) was generated by three rounds of site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene). Separase fragments encoding amino acids 325–2120, 1278–1841, 1278–1556, and 1557–1841 were generated by PCR amplification. To create separase Δ55, an N-terminal fragment (encoding amino acids 1–1418) was amplified and cloned as an XhoI-AgeI fragment. The C-terminal portion (amino acids 1474–2120) was then amplified and cloned as an AgeI-NotI fragment. PP2A_A, PP2A_Bα, PP2A_B′α, and PP2A_C open reading frames were amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR and cloned into pcDNA5/FRT/TO/Myc and pcDNA3/Myc (25Taylor S.S. McKeon F. Cell. 1997; 89: 727-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) for transfection and in vitro transcription/translations respectively. To express securin, cyclin B1, and PP2A_B′α as C-terminal His-FLAG-tagged fusions, the open reading frames were cloned into pCS2 His6-FLAG-His6-FLAG. Plasmids encoding 4HA PP2A_B′ α, β, γ1, γ3, δ, and ϵ isoforms were obtained from the Addgene plasmid repository. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture, Drug Treatment, and Transient Transfections—TA-HeLa cells and Flip-In™ TRex™-293 cells were cultured under conditions described previously (26Taylor S.S. Hussein D. Wang Y. Elderkin S. Morrow C.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4385-4395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Tighe A. Johnson V.L. Taylor S.S. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 6339-6353Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Stable isogenic cell lines expressing separase and PP2A transgenes were generated using FRT/Flp-mediated recombination as previously described (27Tighe A. Johnson V.L. Taylor S.S. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 6339-6353Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Briefly, pcDNA5 plasmids were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding the Flp recombinase (pOG44) into Flp-In™ TRex™-293 cells. After selection for hygromycin resistance, colonies were pooled and expanded, and transgene expression was induced with 1 μg/ml tetracycline. Flip-In™ TRex™-293 cells were used for all experiments unless stated otherwise. To enrich for mitotic cells, cultures were treated for 18 h with 0.2 μg/ml nocodazole. To arrest cells at G1/S, cells were treated with 2 mm thymidine for 20 h. Transient transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate method according to the manufacturer's instructions (ProFection®, Promega). Antibodies, Immunoblotting, and Immunoprecipitation—For immunoblot analysis, soluble cell proteins or immune complexes were resuspended in sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), and probed with the following antibodies: 4A6 (mouse α-Myc, Upstate, 1:1,000); mouse α-cyclin B1 (Upstate, 1:2,000); DCS-280 (mouse α-securin, Abcam, 1:250); mouse α-separase (Abcam, 1:1,000); mouse α-N-terminal separase (20Stemmann O. Zou H. Gerber S.A. Gygi S.P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 2001; 107: 715-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar); rabbit α-P-S1126 (ref (22Holland A.J. Taylor S.S. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3325-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), 1:100); TAT-1 (mouse α-Tubulin, 1:10,000); rabbit α-PP2A_A (Cell Signaling, 1:1,000); mouseα-PP2A_C (BD Transduction Laboratories, 1:5,000); mouse α-PP2A_C (Upstate, 1:1,000), sheep α-GST (1:500); mouse α-FLAG (Sigma, 1:1,000). For immunoprecipitation, α-Myc, α-cyclin B1, α-separase, α-FLAG, or mouse IgG (Sigma) were coupled to protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at a final concentration of 0.2 μg/ml. Cells were harvested and lysed in 1× lysis buffer (0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 μm okadaic acid, 1 μg/ml antipain, aprotinin, and pepstatin, and 5 μg/ml bestatin, chymostatin, and leupeptin) for 30 min on ice. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, precleared with protein G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C, then incubated for a further 2 h at 4 °C with the appropriate antibody coupled beads. After five washes in lysis buffer, immune complexes were immunoblotted or eluted with a synthetic Myc peptide (Sigma). Large Scale Immunoprecipitations and Mass Spectrometry—Large scale immunoprecipitations were performed as above with the following modifications. ∼2.5 × 108 cells were harvested and lysed on ice for 30 min in 1 ml of 2× lysis buffer (0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 μm okadaic acid, 1 μg/ml antipain, aprotinin, and pepstatin, and 5 μg/ml bestatin, chymostatin, and leupeptin). Lysates were gently vortexed then centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were precleared with protein G-Sepharose then incubated with 25 μl of anti-Myc coupled protein G beads (∼5 μg of antibody). After 5 washes at 4 °C for 15 min, bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. Protein bands were excised, digested with trypsin, and subject to analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Tandem Affinity Purification—293T cells were co-transfected with ZZ-Tev4-separase and securin or securin-His6FLAGHis6FLAG expression vectors using a calcium phosphate-based method and subsequently synchronized as described (28Fang G. Yu H. Kirschner M.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1871-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection the nocodazole-arrested cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.7), 1 mm EGTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture (plus EDTA, Roche Applied Science), Dounce-homogenized, and left on ice for 10 min. After ultracentrifugation for 45 min at 35,000 rpm, the supernatant was mixed with IgG-Sepharose™ 6 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences). The suspension was rotated overnight at 4 °C before the antibody-beads were pelleted and washed with lysis buffer. ZZ-Tev4-tagged separase complexes were subsequently eluted with ⅕ bead volume His-Tev-protease for 1 h at 18 °C. As a negative control, ⅕ bead volume His-Tev-protease was added during the incubation procedure. His-Tev eluates were expanded to 1 ml in lysis buffer and rotated for 4 h at 4 °C together with 50 μlof α-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma). Antibody-beads were pelleted and washed with lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted from antibody-beads with SDS and analyzed by immunoblotting. Cell Biology—DNA content and mitotic index measurements were performed using flow cytometry as described (25Taylor S.S. McKeon F. Cell. 1997; 89: 727-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol, stained with the MPM-2 antibody (Upstate) followed by a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey α-mouse antibody, then stained with propidium iodide. All DNA content profiles were measured 24 h post-induction. Mitotic timings were determined by phase contrast time-lapse microscopy as described (22Holland A.J. Taylor S.S. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3325-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Imaging began 4 h after tetracycline induction, and at least 50 cells were analyzed over the subsequent 16 h. Mitotic timings are presented as box- and-whisker plots, where the boxes represent the interquartile range, and the whiskers show the entire range. Metaphase spreads were carried out 8 h after transgene induction as described (27Tighe A. Johnson V.L. Taylor S.S. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 6339-6353Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). At least 50 spreads were counted in three independent experiments; values in bar graphs represent the mean ± S.E. Protein Purification and in Vitro Binding Assays—cDNA fragments were PCR-amplified and cloned into pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences). GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli cells by induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 2 h. Bacteria were lysed with ice-cold bacterial lysis buffer (0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml antipain, aprotinin, and pepstatin and 5 μg/ml bestatin, chymostatin, and leupeptin), sonicated, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated at 4 °C overnight with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). After 5 washes with lysis buffer, recombinant proteins were eluted in lysis buffer containing 6 μg/ml glutathione then dialyzed in phosphate buffered saline. In vitro transcription/translations were performed using the T7 RNA polymerase TNT® Quick Coupled system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reaction mixtures were diluted in lysis buffer and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with a recombinant GST fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose. Beads were washed five times in lysis buffer, and bound proteins detected by immunoblotting. Phosphatase Assays—Cells expressing Myc-tagged separase or PP2A subunits were lysed in lysis buffer lacking phosphatase inhibitors, and immunoprecipitations were performed using α-Myc antibody-coupled beads. Immune complexes were equilibrated with phosphatase wash buffer (0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol) then washed once with assay buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.0), 100 μm CaCl2). Half of the immune complex was immunoblotted, whereas the rest was assayed for phosphatase activity using a malachite green phosphatase assay (Upstate) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Where indicated, okadaic acid (Calbiochem) was added at a final concentration of 1 μm. For each assay, a control immunoprecipitation was performed from cells in which transgene expression had not been induced. The background reading obtained from this control (–Tet) reaction was subtracted from the value obtained in the induced (+Tet) immunoprecipitate. Experiments were repeated three times, and values were plotted as bar graphs of the mean ± S.E. Values were normalized to the average maximum phosphatase activity observed in the experiment. Separase Associates with PP2A—To identify separase interacting proteins, we immunoprecipitated exogenous Myc-tagged separase from 293 cells and analyzed isolated proteins by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. Because numerous separase autocleavage products obscured potential binding partners (not shown), we used 293 cells expressing a catalytically inactive C2029A mutant of separase (separase C:A), thereby minimizing autocleavage. Importantly, the separase C:A transgene was under tetracycline control, allowing us to directly compare induced and uninduced samples processed with the same antibody. Silver stain analysis of separase C:A complexes revealed several bands not present in the uninduced control (Fig. 1A). These were excised and identified by mass spectrometry. In addition to separase itself and securin, two PP2A subunits were identified. PP2A is a serine/threonine phosphatase that predominantly exists as a heterotrimeric complex in the cell containing a structural subunit (PP2A_A), a catalytic subunit (PP2A_C), and a third regulatory subunit (PP2A_B) comprised of four subfamilies (B, B′, B″, and B‴) (29Lechward K. Awotunde O.S. Swiatek W. Muszynska G. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2001; 48: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 30Janssens V. Goris J. Van Hoof C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Our analysis identified PP2A_A and PP2A_B′, also known as B56. To determine whether the catalytic subunit was present, we isolated immune complexes from 293 cells expressing Myc-tagged wild type (WT) separase. Immunoblotting revealed the presence of PP2A_C (Fig. 1B), which together with the silver stain analysis demonstrates that separase binds the A, B′, and C subunits of PP2A, most likely in the form of a heterotrimeric holoenzyme. The PP2A_B′ family is composed of several isoforms (α, β, γ, δ, ϵ) that are >80% identical in the conserved central core (31Cho U.S. Xu W. Nature. 2007; 445: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). To determine which PP2A_B′ isoforms interact with separase, HA-tagged B′ α, β, γ1, γ3, δ, and ϵ were transfected into 293 cells stably expressing Myc-tagged WT separase, and Myc immune complexes were isolated. Separase interacted with all five PP2A_B′ isoforms but failed to associate with a HA-tagged control protein (Fig. 1C). Thus, similar to the situation recently reported for SgoI (32Kitajima T.S. Sakuno T. Ishiguro K. Iemura S. Natsume T. Kawashima S.A. Watanabe Y. Nature. 2006; 441: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 34Tang Z. Shu H. Qi W. Mahmood N.A. Mumby M.C. Yu H. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), separase can associate with any PP2A_B′ isoform. In all subsequent experiments the PP2A_B′α isoform was used. To confirm the interaction between PP2A and separase, we asked whether PP2A could co-immunoprecipitate separase. Analysis of Myc-PP2A_B′α immune complexes revealed the presence of both PP2A_A and PP2A_C (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, phosphatase activity was associated with the immunoprecipitate (data not shown), indicating formation of an active complex. Importantly, endogenous separase was specifically detected in the α-Myc immune complex (Fig. 2A), demonstrating that endogenous separase associates with exogenous PP2A_B′α. Finally, to establish whether PP2A and separase interact at endogenous levels, separase was immunopurified from mitotic HeLa cells. PP2A_A and PP2A_C were specifically present in the separase immunoprecipitate but not in the control (Fig. 2B). Together, these observations indicate that separase interacts with heterotrimeric PP2A and that this interaction can be recapitulated by expressing either exogenous PP2A_B′ or exogenous separase. Separase Binds PP2A during Interphase—Separase associates with securin in interphase but only binds cyclin B1 during mitosis after serine 1126 phosphorylation (20Stemmann O. Zou H. Gerber S.A. Gygi S.P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 2001; 107: 715-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 21Gorr I.H. Boos D. Stemmann O. Mol.

To determine when PP2A binds separase, we immunopurified Myc-tagged WT separase from G1/S and mitotically enriched populations of cells. Similar amounts of PP2A_A and PP2A_C associated with separase in both G1/S- and mitotic-enriched populations, suggesting that like securin, PP2A binds separase during interphase. Consistently, similar levels of endogenous separase bound Myc-tagged PP2A_B′ in G1/S and mitotic populations (Fig. 2A). Separase Associates with a Specific Subtype of PP2A—The B subunits of PP2A are typically responsible for substrate targeting and/or subcellular localization (29Lechward K. Awotunde O.S. Swiatek W. Muszynska G. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2001; 48: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 30Janssens V. Goris J. Van Hoof C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether separase interacts directly with the regulatory B subunit. To test this, a fragment encoding the regulatory region of separase, which contains the PP2A binding domain (separaseRR, amino acids 1278–1556, see below), was expressed as a GST fusion in bacteria. Purified GST-separaseRR was then incubated with in vitro translated Myc-tagged PP2A subunits. Although GST-separaseRR did not bind PP2A_A or PP2A_C, it did interact with PP2A_B′α (Fig. 3A). This interaction was specific for GST-separaseRR as neither GST nor GST-Mad2 bound (Fig. 3B). Thus, separaseRR can directly associate with PP2A_B′α, consistent with the notion that the regulatory B′ subunit does indeed target PP2A to separase. In these in vitro binding reactions, GST-separaseRR could bind PP2A_B′α but not PP2A_Bα (Fig. 3B), suggesting that separase interacts with PP2A complexes containing B′ subunits rather than B subunits. To test this we isolated α-Myc immune complexes from cells expressing Myc-tagged-Bα or -B′α. As expected, both Myc-Bα and Myc-B′α bound PP2A_A and _C (Fig. 3C), and both were associated with phosphatase activity (Fig. 3D), consistent with their incorporation in an enzymatically active complex.

In addition, bile acids play a crucial role in cholesterol homeostasis. One of the key enzymes in the bile acid biosynthetic pathways is cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase/cytochrome P450 7α-hydroxylase (7α-hydroxylase), which is the rate-limiting and regulatory step of the “classic” pathway. Transcription of the 7α-hydroxylase gene is highly regulated. Two nuclear receptors, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF-4α) and α1-fetoprotein transcription factor, are required for both transcription and regulation by different physiological events. It has been shown that some mitogen-activated protein kinases, such as the c-Jun N-terminal kinase and the ERK, play important roles in the regulation of 7α-hydroxylase transcription. In this study, we show evidence that the p38 kinase pathway plays an important role in 7α-hydroxylase expression and hence in bile acid synthesis. Inhibition of p38 kinase activity in primary hepatocytes results in ∼5–10-fold reduction of 7α-hydroxylase mRNA. This suppression is mediated, at least in part, through HNF-4α. Inhibition of p38 kinase activity diminishes HNF-4α nuclear protein levels and its phosphorylation in vivo and in vitro, and it renders a less stable protein. Induction of the p38 kinase pathway by insulin results in an increase in HNF-4α protein and a concomitant induction of 7α-hydroxylase expression that is blocked by inhibiting the p38 pathway.

Cholesterol is an important precursor of several compounds that provide key physiological requirements of mammals. However, excessive accumulation of cholesterol is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, which constitute a major health issue. Bile acid synthesis in the liver is the predominant pathway for cholesterol catabolism.

Among them are hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF-4α) and α1-fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF), also known as liver receptor homologue 1. HNF-4α is an important regulator of 7α-hydroxylase gene expression as demonstrated by in vitro promoter analysis (1Stroup D. Chiang J.Y. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by characterization of mice with a liver-specific deficiency of HNF-4α (2Inoue Y. Yu A.M. Yim S.H. Ma X.

Chem. 2004; 279: 16813-16821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). HNF-4α is a liver-enriched and highly conserved member of the nuclear receptor superfamily (NR2A1). Amino acid identity between rat and human HNF-4 varies from 89.7 to 100%, depending on the isoform. It binds as a homodimer to direct repeats separated by one nucleotide (DR1) response element with the consensus sequence: AGGTCAGGGG(T/A)CA (4Aranda A. Pascual A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1269-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). HNF-4α can activate gene transcription in the absence of exogenous ligands. HNF-4α binding activity may be modulated by fatty acyl-coenzyme A thio-esters, which may act as agonistic or antagonistic ligands depending on chain length and degree of saturation (5Hertz R. Magenheim J. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Nature. 1998; 392: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 6Sladek F.M. Zhong W.M. Lai E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2353-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). The expression of a wide variety of genes is under the control of HNF-4α; among them are genes involved in lipid metabolism, glucose metabolism, and overall development (7Bogan A.A. Dallas-Yang Q. Ruse Jr., M.D. Maeda Y. Jiang G. Nepomuceno L. Scanlan T.S. Cohen F.E. Sladek F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 831-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In the last few years, it has become clear that bile acids are also important regulatory molecules, not only of their own synthesis but also of cholesterol synthesis (8Datta S. Wang L. Moore D.D. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 807-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), gluconeogenesis (9De Fabiani E. Mitro N. Gilardi F. Caruso D. Galli G. Crestani M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39124-39132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), glycogenesis (10Han S.I. Studer E. Gupta S. Fang Y. Qiao L. Li W. Grant S. Hylemon P.B. Dent P. Hepatology. 2004; 39: 456-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and apoptosis. Many of these regulations occur through the modulation of different cell signaling pathways. Moreover, different cell signaling pathways regulate bile acid synthesis differently. Bile acids can activate both the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the extracellular receptor kinase (ERK) in hepatocytes (11Gupta S. Stravitz R.T. Dent P. Hylemon P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15816-15822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 12Qiao L. Studer E. Leach K. McKinstry R. Gupta S. Decker R. Kukreja R. Valerie K. Nagarkatti P.

Stravitz R.T. Gupta S. Qiao L. Dent P. Hylemon P.B. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This bile acid-mediated induction of the JNK pathway is part of the mechanism by which bile acids regulate their own synthesis. Thus, the JNK pathway has been shown to activate the small heterodimer partner expression through an farnesoid X-activated receptor-independent pathway (11Gupta S. Stravitz R.T. Dent P. Hylemon P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15816-15822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) in primary hepatocytes. Other cell signaling pathways have also been implicated in the feedback regulation of bile acid synthesis. Thus, bile acids can repress 7α-hydroxylase promoter activity by reducing the transactivation potential of HNF-4α via the MAPK/ERK kinase kinase 1 signaling cascade (14De Fabiani E. Mitro N. Anzulovich A.C. Pinelli A. Galli G. Crestani M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30708-30716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Furthermore, interleukin-1β inhibits the expression of another important gene in bile acid synthesis, sterol 12α-hydroxylase/CYP8B1, via the JNK pathway (15Jahan A. Chiang J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: G685-G695Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), presumably by phosphorylating HNF-4α and preventing binding to its recognition site in the sterol 12α-hydroxylase promoter. The MAPK family of signaling pathways consist of a cascade of sequentially acting upstream kinases: MAPK kinase kinases and MAPK kinases, and at least four terminal kinases: the classic p42/44 MAPK or ERK1/2; JNK1/2; p38 MAPK (p38 kinase); and ERK5. MAPKs phosphorylate a number of transcription factors known to alter their transactivating potentials, thus presumably influencing gene expression to elicit a cellular response. Specific to bile acid biosynthesis, it has been reported that bile acids inhibit 7α-hydroxylase gene transcription and HNF-4α transactivating potential via activating the JNK/c-Jun pathway (14De Fabiani E. Mitro N. Anzulovich A.C. Pinelli A. Galli G. Crestani M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30708-30716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This suggests that MAPK phosphorylation of nuclear receptors may be an important regulatory mechanism for bile acid metabolism. Phosphorylation of nuclear receptors provides an important mechanism for cross-talk between signaling pathways and has been shown to modulate the activity of many nuclear receptors (16Shao D. Lazar M.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 1617-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). There are several reports indicating that HNF-4α is phosphorylated and that phosphorylation has a functional role. Thus, HNF-4α has been shown to be phosphorylated by the action of protein kinase A, and this phosphorylation modulates its DNA binding activity (17Viollet B. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4208-4219Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Serine/threonine phosphorylation of HNF-4α alters its tertiary structure, which causes an increase in the affinity and specificity of DNA binding in COS-7 cells (18Jiang G. Nepomuceno L. Yang Q. Sladek F.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It has also been recently shown that p38 kinase phosphorylates HNF-4α, increasing its DNA binding and transactivation activity in the presence of interleukin-1β + H2O2 (19Guo H. Gao C. Mi Z. Wai P.Y. Kuo P.C. Biochem. J. 2006; 394: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). On the other hand, tyrosine phosphorylation of HNF-4α is also important for DNA binding activity as well as for the recruitment of its transcriptionally active form into subnuclear compartments (20Ktistaki E. Ktistakis N.T. Papadogeorgaki E. Talianidis I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9876-9880Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this study, we show evidence that p38 kinase plays an important role in 7α-hydroxylase expression and hence in bile acid synthesis. Studies are shown that indicate that the effect of p38 kinase is mediated, at least in part, through HNF-4α. Inhibition of p38 kinase activity diminishes HNF-4α phosphorylation in vivo and renders a less stable protein. Insulin, a known activator of the p38 kinase pathway, increases nuclear HNF-4α protein levels, which results in an induction of 7α-hydroxylase expression. These studies show a functional connection between the p38 signaling pathway and a key liver nuclear receptor, HNF-4α. Materials and Plasmids—p38 kinase inhibitors, SB 202190, and SB 203580 and the nonactive chemical analogue SB 202474 were obtained from CalBiochem. Monoclonal Anti-Myc antibody was from Sigma. Anti-HNF-4α and anti-histone deacetylase 1 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-phospho-p38 kinase and anti-p38 kinase were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology.

Common laboratory chemicals were from Fisher, Sigma, or Bio-Rad. The chimeric 7α-hydroxylase promoter-luciferase reporter construct pGL3-R7α-342 has been described previously (21del Castillo-Olivares A. Gil G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3587-3593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primary Rat Hepatocyte Cultures—Primary rat hepatocyte monolayer cultures were prepared from male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (200–300 g) using the collagenase perfusion technique of Bissell and Guzelian as previously described (21del Castillo-Olivares A. Gil G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3587-3593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were plated on collagen-coated culture dishes in serum-free William's E medium containing 0.1 μm dexamethasone and 1 μm thyroxine. Before plating, the cells were judged to be greater than 90% viable using trypan blue exclusion. The cells were routinely incubated at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2. When treated with p38 kinase chemical inhibitors, a final concentration of 5 μm was used, delivered in Me2SO. RNA Isolation and Quantification—Total RNA was isolated using the SV total RNA isolation kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 7α-Hydroxylase, HNF-4α, and β-actin mRNAs were quantified by quantitative reverse transcription PCR using the primers and probes shown in Table 1 and the Brilliant quantitative reverse transcription PCR Core Reagent kit (Stratagene) using either TaqMan probes (7α-hydroxylase) or SYBR Green (HNF-4α) with a DNA Engine Opticon2 (MJ Research, Inc.). All of the values were normalized to the levels of actin mRNA, also quantified by quantitative reverse transcription PCR either in separate SYBR Green reactions or in duplex reactions when TaqMan probes were used.TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used in the quantitative reverse transcription PCR quantification of RNAsOligonucleotideGeneGenBank™ accession numberNucleotidesSequencer7α-FRat CYP7A1NM_012942989-1010CAT CTC AAG CAA ACA CCA TTC Cr7α-R977-1001AGC ACT CTG TAA AGC TCC ACT CAC Tr7α-T931-960TCA TTG CTT CAG GAC TCC TGA TCA TTT GAArHNF4-FRat HNF-4αNM_022180897-916CAA GGC TGT GGG CTC CAT AGrHNF4-R972-992ATT GTT GGT CAC CTC CGT GTCrβ-Actin-FRat β—ActinNM_031144574-594TCT ACG AGG GCT ATG CTC TCCrβ-Actin-R699-721TCT TTG ATG TCA CGC ACG ATT TCrβ-Actin-T605-626CCT GCG TCT GGA CCT GGC TGG C Open table in a new tab Bile Acid Synthesis—Bile acid synthesis rates were quantified essentially as described (22Shin D.-J.

Briefly, primary rat hepatocytes were seeded on 60-mm plates at 2.5 × 106 cells/plate. Twenty-four hours later the cells were incubated in the presence or absence of the p38 kinase inhibitors as indicated for 2 h. Then 0.13 μCi of [14C]cholesterol (50 mCi/mmol) was added per plate and incubated for 48 h. Conversion of [14C]cholesterol to [14C]methanol/water-soluble products was determined by scintillation counting after Folch extraction (23Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the culture medium with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). Where indicated, the cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 40 of an adenovirus encoding the steroidogenic acute regulatory domain 1 cDNA driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter (24Pandak W.M. Ren S. Marques D. Hall E. Redford K. Mallonee D. Bohdan P. Heuman D.M. Gil G. Hylemon P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48158-48164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) in 0.5 ml of serum-free medium. After 2 h, the virus was diluted, and [14C]cholesterol was added and processed as above. Western Blot Analysis—Primary rat hepatocyte cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared using a nuclear and cytoplasmic kit from Pierce. 10 μg of nuclear protein or 60 μg of cytoplasmic protein was fractionated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose; incubated with the anti-HNF-4α, anti-histone deacetylase 1, or anti-P-p38, or anti-total p38; and processed with a Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assays—Primary rat hepatocytes were transfected with Lipofectin (Invitrogen) using 1.5 μg of total DNA containing 100 ng of pGL3-R7α-342 (wild type) and 10 ng of pCMV-Gal to normalize for transfection efficiencies. After 16 h the DNA was removed, and p38 kinase inhibitors were added. The cells were harvested 24 h later. CV-1 cells were first infected with the indicated virus for 7 h and then transfected with pGL3-R7α-342 using FuGENE 6 reached (Roche Applied Science). After transfection the indicated p38 chemical inhibitors were added to 1% fetal calf serum containing medium. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed with a kit from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. All of the transfections were performed in duplicate. The values are averages for the number of experiments indicated. Adenovirus Preparation and Propagation—The adenovirus Ad-Myc-HNF-4α was obtained through the Massey Cancer Center Shared Resource Facility of the Virginia Commonwealth University as described (3Del Castillo-Olivares A. Campos J.A. Pandak W.M. Gil G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16813-16821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The dominant negative kinase-deficient mutant p38 kinase was a gift from Dr. P. Dent (25Sarkar D. Su Z.Z. Lebedeva I.V. Sauane M. Gopalkrishnan R.V. Valerie K. Dent P. Fisher P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10054-10059Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Metabolic Labeling—Primary rat hepatocytes plated on 60-mm dishes were infected with multiplicity of infection of 10 of the Ad-Myc-HNF-4α adenovirus. After overnight incubation with the virus, the medium was replaced with fresh William's E medium. Two hours later, the cells were washed with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and treated with p38 kinase inhibitors. After 30 min of incubation, the cells were labeled with 1 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate for 2 h. The cells were then lysed in 500 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 20 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and proteinase inhibitors). The cell lysates were incubated with 2 μg of anti-Myc antibody or preimmune IgG as control at 4 °C overnight, and then the immune complexes were precipitated by incubating the samples with protein A/G-agarose (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. Washed beads were boiled in 50 μl of Laemmli buffer and loaded onto the SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was subjected to autoradiography to detect phosphorylated proteins or Western blotting analysis using anti-HNF-4α antibody to detect the protein. Studies of HNF-4α protein stability were similarly conducted in primary rat hepatocytes. Primary rat hepatocytes were infected with a multiplicity of infection of 10 of the Ad-Myc-HNF-4α adenovirus overnight. The medium was then changed to l-methionine, starved for 30 min, and then labeled with 120 μCi/ml l-[35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 40 m. The cells were then washed and incubated in regular Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with or without 5 μm of the p38 kinase inhibitors. Samples were harvested for immunoprecipitation with the anti-Myc antibody at different intervals. Measurement of the incorporation of l-[35S]methionine into immunoprecipitable Myc-HNF-4α was carried out by scintillation counting. Statistical Analysis—The results are expressed as the means ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 11 software. Comparisons in groups were analyzed by using the t test or one-way analysis of variance; p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Decreased 7α-Hydroxylase Expression in Primary Rat Hepatocytes Treated with p38 Kinase Inhibitors—To investigate whether the p38 MAPK pathway plays a role in 7α-hydroxylase expression and bile acid biosynthesis, we incubated primary rat hepatocytes with two specific chemical inhibitors of the p38 kinase, SB 202190 and SB 203580. As a control we used the inactive analogue SB 202474. Fig. 1A shows that both p38 kinase inhibitors decreased 7α-hydroxylase mRNA between 80 and 90% as compared with controls. To confirm the specificity of this effect, we used a genetic approach to suppress p38 kinase activity. We used a dominant negative kinase-deficient mutant p38 kinase expressing virus (25Sarkar D. Su Z.Z. Lebedeva I.V. Sauane M. Gopalkrishnan R.V. Valerie K. Dent P. Fisher P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10054-10059Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows a dose-dependent suppression of 7α-hydroxylase mRNA by the p38 mutant but not by a control virus. Actin mRNA was quantified as control and used to normalize 7α-hydroxylase mRNA values. The lower 7α-hydroxylase expression caused by the p38 inhibitors resulted in lower bile acid synthesis in the hepatocytes as quantified by measuring bile acids excreted in the medium (Fig. 2). Bile acid levels inside the cells showed a decreasing trend, although it was statistically insignificant. As a positive control we used cells overexpressing steroidogenic acute regulatory domain protein 1, which we have shown to increase bile acid synthesis (24Pandak W.M. Ren S. Marques D. Hall E. Redford K. Mallonee D. Bohdan P. Heuman D.M. Gil G. Hylemon P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48158-48164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Bile acids excreted in the medium of steroidogenic acute regulatory domain protein 1-infected cells increased 11-fold compared with control (data not shown). To characterize whether p38 kinase inhibitors suppressed 7α-hydroxylase expression at the transcriptional level, we transfected primary hepatocytes with a 7α-hydroxylase promoter luciferase construct containing 342 bp of the rat 5′-flanking region (21del Castillo-Olivares A. Gil G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3587-3593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After transfection, the cells were treated with the same p38 kinase inhibitors as above. Fig. 3A shows that 7α-hydroxylase promoter activity was suppressed by the p38 kinase inhibitors in the same manner as the 7α-hydroxylase mRNA. Then we used a non-liver cell line (CV-1) that does not express the 7α-hydroxylase promoter unless exogenous factors are cotransfected (26del Castillo-Olivares A. Gil G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4035-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Transactivation of the 7α-hydroxylase promoter by HNF-4α is specifically suppressed by the p38 kinase inhibitor SB 202190 but not by the inactive analogue SB 202474 (Fig. 3B), suggesting that HNF-4α mediates, at least in part, the p38 activation of 7α-hydroxylase expression. Decreased Nuclear HNF-4α Protein Levels in Primary Rat Hepatocytes Treated with p38 Kinase Inhibitors—To characterize whether HNF-4α mediates the p38 kinase effect on 7α-hydroxylase expression, we quantified HNF-4α protein in hepatocyte nuclear extracts that had been treated with the same p38 kinase inhibitors. Fig. 4A shows that the nuclear HNF-4α protein was reduced in hepatocytes treated with the specific p38 kinase inhibitors (SB 202190 and SB 203580) for 18 h. Histone deacetylase 1 was quantified as a control, and it was unchanged. Levels of FTF protein, another key transcriptional factor for 7α-hydroxylase expression, did not change (data not shown). However, HNF-4α mRNA was unchanged (Fig. 4B), suggesting that p38 kinase affects HNF-4α translation or protein stability. To address this issue, pulse-chase experiments were carried out in primary rat hepatocytes infected with an adenovirus to overexpress HNF-4α in the form of a fusion protein Myc-HNF-4α to facilitate immunoprecipitation. Then proteins were metabolically labeled with [35S]Met, incubated with p38 inhibitors and processed as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 5 shows the average of three experiments, and it illustrates that the half-life of the HNF-4α protein significantly decreased when cells had been incubated in the presence of the specific p38 inhibitor SB 203580.FIGURE 5p38 kinase inhibitor accelerates HNF4α degradation in primary rat hepatocytes. Pulse-chase experiments were performed in primary rat hepatocytes infected with an adenovirus carrying a cytomegalovirus-HNF-4α chimeric gene to overexpress HNF-4α. After metabolic labeling as described under “Experimental Procedures,” the cells were incubated with 5 μm p38 inhibitor SB 203580 and inactive control SB 202474 and then harvested at the indicated times. Labeled HNF-4α was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibodies and quantified by scintillation counting. The values represent the means ± S.D. of five experiments. For the 0.5-h point, p ≤ 0.005 versus their corresponding SB 202474 control. For the 1-h time point, p ≤ 0.01 versus its corresponding SB 202474 control. For the 1.5-h time point, p ≤ 0.001 versus its corresponding SB 202474 control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) p38 Kinase Phosphorylates HNF-4α in Primary Rat Hepatocytes—To study whether HNF-4α is phosphorylated in primary rat hepatocytes, we infected cells with the same adenovirus containing a Myc-HNF-4α fusion cDNA as above. After overnight overexpression of the fusion protein, the cells were incubated with [32P]phosphate in the presence of the p38 kinase inhibitors SB 202190 and SB 203580, or a control inhibitor (SB 202474), or just the vehicle (Me2SO). After 2 h of incubation, the cells were harvested and processed as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 6 shows that HNF-4α is indeed phosphorylated and that phosphorylation is prevented by the p38 kinase inhibitors by ∼40%. The Myc-HNF-4α protein remained constant under all conditions. This is in agreement with a very recent publication showing that HNF-4α is phosphorylated in HepG2 cells (19Guo H. Gao C. Mi Z. Wai P.Y. Kuo P.C. Biochem. J. 2006; 394: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It is also in agreement with HNF-4α being phosphorylated by other kinases (17Viollet B. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4208-4219Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 18Jiang G. Nepomuceno L. Yang Q. Sladek F.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), because p38 kinase inhibitor prevented phosphorylation only by a factor of 2. p38 Activation by Insulin Increases HNF-4α Protein and 7α-Hydroxylase Expression—Insulin has been described as activating the p38 pathway in kidney cells (27Harrison E.M. McNally S.J. Devey L. Garden O.J. Ross J.A. Wigmore S.J. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 2345-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Insulin is also a known regulator of bile acid biosynthesis. Thus, recently it has been shown that short term treatment of human primary hepatocytes with physiological concentrations of insulin activates 7α-hydroxylase expression, whereas longer incubation suppresses it (28Li T. Kong X. Owsley E. Ellis E. Strom S. Chiang J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28745-28754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, to investigate whether the p38 kinase pathway could be involved in this regulatory process by increasing nuclear HNF-4α protein levels, we incubated primary rat hepatocytes with different insulin concentrations at physiological range (1 to 10 nm). Fig. 7A shows that 7α-hydroxylase expression increases at the concentrations tested after 6 h but not at shorter times (2 h). Longer incubation (20 h) had either no effect or resulted in a suppression at the highest insulin concentration tested (10 nm), as it has been reported in human hepatocytes (28Li T. Kong X. Owsley E. Ellis E. Strom S. Chiang J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28745-28754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). HNF-4α mRNA remained unchanged at all conditions (Fig. 7B). Then we quantified HNF-4α nuclear protein and active (phosphorylated) p38 kinase under conditions that result in induction of 7α-hydroxylase expression (10 nm for 6 h). Under those conditions, the increase in 7α-hydroxylase expression correlated with an increase in nuclear HNF-4α protein (Fig. 7C), which followed an increase in activated p38 kinase (Fig. 7D). This strongly suggests that insulin induces 7α-hydroxylase expression by activating the p38 kinase pathway, which results in increased levels of nuclear HNF-4α protein, a critical factor for 7α-hydroxylase transcription. To test the specificity of this effect, primary rat hepatocytes were pretreated with the p38 inhibitor SB 203580 and then with insulin. Fig. 8 shows that when the p38 kinase pathway is inhibited, insulin has no significant effect on 7α-hydroxylase mRNA (Fig. 8A). To test whether the phosphorylation state of HNF-4α is altered by insulin, primary rat hepatocytes were infected with the Myc-HNF-4α adenovirus overnight, treated with the p38 inhibitor where indicated, labeled with [32P]phosphate, and then incubated with or without 10 nm insulin as indicated. HNF-4α phosphorylation significantly increased upon insulin treatment in the absence of the p38 kinase inhibitor SB 203580 (Fig. 8B, lanes 1 and 3) but not in its presence (Fig. 8B, lanes 2 and 4). Myc-HNF-4α protein levels did not significantly change under the short incubation time used. Taken together, the experiments shown in Figs. 7 and 8 strongly support the idea that the short term activation of 7α-hydroxylase expression by insulin is mediated, at least in part, by activating the p38 kinase, which in turn increases HNF-4α phosphorylation, which results in higher levels of HNF-4α driving increased 7α-hydroxylase expression. Studies carried out in the last decade have unveiled two general regulatory pathways of bile acid biosynthesis, i.e. a “nuclear receptor” pathway and a “signaling” pathway. Until recently, the two pathways have remained mostly independent of each other as far as bile acid metabolism is concerned. Specifically, there is good evidence that two of the major signaling pathways, i.e. the JNK pathway (11Gupta S. Stravitz R.T. Dent P. Hylemon P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15816-15822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and the ERK pathway (29Fang Y. Han S.I. Mitchell C. Gupta S. Studer E. Grant S. Hylemon P.B. Dent P. Hepatology. 2004; 40: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), are activated by bile acids. Induction of these pathways results in suppression of bile acid synthesis by acting on 7α-hydroxylase transcription. In the present study, we provide additional evidence for cross-talk between a nuclear receptor pathway and a signaling pathway, implicating, for the first time, the p38 kinase pathway in bile acid biosynthesis. It has been reported that p38 activity is needed for an active bile acid export pump (30Kubitz R. Sutfels G. Kuhlkamp T. Kolling R. Haussinger D. Gastroenterology. 2004; 126: 541-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A potential alternative explanation for the strong reduction in 7α-hydoxylase expression that we observed when p38 kinase activity is suppressed either with chemical inhibitors (Fig. 1A) or by the use of a dominant negative p38 kinase mutant (Fig. 1B) could be that the bile acid export pump is blocked, which would impair bile acid export from the hepatocytes. This would result in bile acid accumulation inside the hepatocytes, suppressing 7α-hydroxylase transcription. In other words, our observation would be the result of an indirect effect on 7α-hydoxylase expression rather than direct. However, quantification of bile acid synthesis indicates that the effect of p38 kinase inhibitors is direct and not indirect, because bile acid levels are reduced between 30 and 46% outside the cells (bile acids are rapidly released in the medium) (Fig. 2). Although the decrease in bile acids inside the cells is not statistically significant, they do not increase either, further supporting the idea that the p38 kinase pathway has a direct effect on their synthesis. It should be noted that in primary hepatocytes ∼50% of bile acid synthesis takes place through the acidic pathway in which 7α-hydroxylase is not involved, thus the highest reduction in bile acid synthesis that can be seen suppressing 7α-hydroxylase is 50% (31Stravitz R.T. Vlahcevic Z.R. Russell T.L. Heizer M.L. Avadhani N.G. Hylemon P.B. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 337-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The dramatic suppression of 7α-hydroxylase expression that we observed (Fig. 1) could, therefore, originate from an effect on either FTF or HNF-4α, because these two nuclear receptors are the only two transcription factors required for 7α-hydroxylase transcription, other than general transcription factors (1Stroup D. Chiang J.Y. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Del Castillo-Olivares A. Campos J.A. Pandak W.M. Gil G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16813-16821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Protein and promoter studies are consistent with the idea that p38 kinase phosphorylates HNF-4α, and as a result, the half-life of HNF-4α is extended (Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6). Many nuclear receptors are phosphorylated, and phosphorylation affects their activity in different ways (16Shao D. Lazar M.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 1617-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). There is also good evidence that HNF-4α is phosphorylated at multiple sites, mainly at serine residues, by several kinases (18Jiang G. Nepomuceno L. Yang Q. Sladek F.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A recent report shows that p38 kinase phosphorylates HNF-4α at Ser158 in HepG2 cells (19Guo H. Gao C. Mi Z. Wai P.Y. Kuo P.C. Biochem. J. 2006; 394: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which is required for interaction between HNF-4α and PC4, a coactivator involved in the activation of nitric-oxide synthase expression by interleukin-1β and peroxide (32Guo H. Gao C. Mi Z. Zhang J. Kuo P.C. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2007; 141: 635-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, overexpression of HNF-4α S158A did not prevent 7α-hydroxylase transactivation in primary hepatocytes infected with an adenovirus encoding HNF-4α S158A (data not shown). This suggests that p38 kinase phosphorylates HNF-4α on at least one other residue. Studies are underway to identify the HNF-4α residue(s) that p38 kinase phosphorylates to maintain full 7α-hydroxylase expression, and they should provide a better understanding of bile acid metabolism and its regulation. The p38 kinase pathway appears to be involved in the activation of 7α-hydroxylase expression by insulin (Figs. 7 and 8). Expression of 7α-hydroxylase has a dual response to insulin, i.e. with shorter incubation times, insulin activates 7α-hydroxylase expression, but with longer times, or at supraphysiological concentrations, insulin suppresses 7α-hydroxylase expression (Fig. 7A) (28Li T.

The bile acid pool increases in diabetes both in humans (34Andersen E. Karlaganis G. Sjovall J. Eur. J. Clin. Investig. 1988; 18: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and in other mammals (35Villanueva G.R. Herreros M. Perez-Barriocanal F. Bolanos J.P. Bravo P. Marin J.J. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1990; 115: 441-448PubMed Google Scholar). After a meal, circulating insulin transiently increases to activate glucose metabolism. It is becoming evident that there is a concomitant increase in 7α-hydroxylase expression leading to an increase in bile acid synthesis to facilitate fat absorption in the intestine (28Li T. Kong X. Owsley E. Ellis E. Strom S. Chiang J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28745-28754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The observation that insulin-induced p38 kinase increases HNF-4α protein and phosphorylation, which results in higher 7α-hydroxylase mRNA levels with no change in HNF-4α mRNA (Figs. 7 and 8), suggests a rapid mechanism for insulin-mediated induction of bile acid synthesis. In summary, the present studies identify HNF-4α as a target of the p38 kinase and a requirement for maximum 7α-hydroxylase expression. However, we have not excluded other potential targets that could also affect 7α-hydroxylase expression, such as the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1 (PGC-1α), a coactivator of HNF-4α and perhaps FTF (22Shin D.-J. Campos J.A. Gil G. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50047-50052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It has been shown that PGC-1α is activated by p38 kinase (36Puigserver P. Rhee J. Lin J. Wu Z. Yoon J.C. Zhang C.Y. Krauss S. Mootha V.K. Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar) and that PGC-1α activates 7α-hydroxylase expression (22Shin D.-J. Campos J.A. Gil G. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50047-50052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar); thus, p38 kinase might also activate 7α-hydroxylase expression through PGC-1α, but our studies show that the p38 pathway is directly involved in the insulin-mediated activation of 7α-hydroxylase expression through phosphorylation of the nuclear receptor HNF-4α.

Results showed PTL deficiency has minimal effect on triacylglycerol (TAG) absorption under low fat dietary conditions. Interestingly, PTL–/– mice displayed significantly reduced TAG absorption compared with wild type mice under high fat/high cholesterol dietary conditions (80.1 ± 3.7 versus 91.5 ± 0.7%, p < 0.05). Net TAG absorption was reduced further to 61.1 ± 3.8% in mice lacking both PTL and CEL. Cholesterol absorption was 41% lower in PTL–/– mice compared with control mice (p < 0.05), but this difference was not exaggerated in PTL–/–, CEL–/– mice. Retinyl palmitate absorption was reduced by 45 and 60% in PTL–/– mice (p < 0.05) and PTL–/–, CEL–/– mice (p < 0.01), respectively. After 15 weeks of feeding, the high fat/high cholesterol diet, wild type, and CEL–/– mice gained ∼24 g of body weight. However, body weight gain was 6.2 and 8.6 g less (p < 0.01) in PTL–/– and PTL–/–, CEL–/– mice, respectively, despite their consumption of comparable amounts of the high fat/high cholesterol diet. The decrease body weight gain in PTL–/– and PTL–/–, CEL–/– mice was attributed to their absorption of fewer calories from the high fat/high cholesterol diet, thereby resulting in less fat mass accumulation than that observed in wild type and CEL–/– mice. Thus, this study documents that PTL and CEL serve complementary functions, working together to mediate the absorption of a major portion of dietary fat and fat-soluble vitamin esters. The reduced lipid absorption efficiency due to PTL and CEL inactivation also resulted in protection against diet-induced obesity.

The reduced lipid absorption efficiency due to PTL and CEL inactivation also resulted in protection against diet-induced obesity. Despite the fundamental importance that digestion, absorption, and subsequent trafficking of dietary fat, fat soluble vitamins, and cholesterol play in health and disease, details of the molecular events involved in these processes remain poorly described. Dietary lipids, such as triacylglycerol (TAG), 4The abbreviations used are: TAGtriacylglycerolCELcarboxyl ester lipasePTLpancreatic triglyceride lipasePTLRPPTL-related protein 4The abbreviations used are: TAGtriacylglycerolCELcarboxyl ester lipasePTLpancreatic triglyceride lipasePTLRPPTL-related protein phospholipids, cholesteryl esters, and retinyl esters must be cleaved by intestinal hydrolases before absorption. Thus, lipid hydrolases derived from the pancreas are central in the digestion and absorption of these dietary components. The most abundant lipolytic enzymes secreted by the pancreas include pancreatic triglyceride lipase (PTL) and carboxyl ester lipase (CEL, formerly named cholesterol esterase). The principal enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of dietary TAG, thereby mediating its absorption, has generally been accepted as PTL. In contrast, the major role of CEL in the digestive tract is generally ascribed to digestion of cholesteryl esters and retinyl esters before their absorption. triacylglycerol carboxyl ester lipase pancreatic triglyceride lipase PTL-related protein triacylglycerol carboxyl ester lipase pancreatic triglyceride lipase PTL-related protein Recent studies with genetically modified mouse models designed to critically examine the role of pancreatic lipolytic enzymes in lipid digestion and transport revealed some unexpected findings. First, TAG absorption was altered very little, but free cholesterol absorption was reduced substantially in PTL–/– mice (1Huggins K.W. Camarota L.M. Howles P.N. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42899-42905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Second, whereas CEL–/– mice displayed dramatically reduced cholesteryl ester hydrolysis and absorption as expected (2Howles P.N. Carter C.P. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7196-7202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), retinyl ester digestion and absorption were similar between CEL+/+ and CEL–/– mice (3Weng W. Li L. van Bennekum A.M. Potter S.H. Harrison E.H. Blaner W.S. Breslow J.L. Fisher E.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4143-4149Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The decrease in cholesterol absorption observed in the PTL–/– mice was attributed to PTL deficiency delaying dietary fat absorption to the distal small intestine (ileum) where intestinal cholesterol uptake is less efficient (4Borgstrom B. J. Clin. Investig. 1960; 39: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 5Sylven C. Nordstrom C. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1970; 5: 57-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the nearly normal absorption of TAG and retinyl esters in PTL–/– and CEL–/– mice suggested that more than one enzyme participates in the digestion of these lipids in vivo. In vitro studies examining lipolytic activities in pancreatic extracts from PTL–/– and CEL–/– mice provided insights to the identity of enzymes responsible for TAG and retinyl ester hydrolysis. In these studies pancreatic extracts from PTL–/– mice were shown to contain robust TAG hydrolytic activity, albeit at lower levels than those observed in pancreatic extracts from wild type mice. Importantly, the TAG hydrolytic activity in PTL–/– pancreas was dependent on the presence of taurocholate, whereas taurodeoxycholate was found to be ineffective (1Huggins K.W. Camarota L.M. Howles P.N. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42899-42905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This selectivity of trihydroxylated bile salt for TAG hydrolytic activity in PTL–/– pancreas is consistent with the trihdroxy- but not dihydroxy-bile salt dependence of CEL (6Hui D.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1303: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), thus implying that CEL may have a previously unrecognized role as a supplementary enzyme for TAG digestion in vivo. Likewise, significant colipase-dependent retinyl ester hydrolytic activity was demonstrated in pancreatic extracts from both CEL+/+ and CEL–/– mice (7van Bennekum A.M. Fisher E.A. Blaner W.S. Harrison E.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4900-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This colipase dependence suggests that PTL may also serve as a retinyl ester hydrolase in the digestive tract. In the current study we crossed PTL–/– mice with CEL–/– mice to obtain mice lacking both enzymes to test the hypothesis that PTL and CEL serve a mutually compensatory role in assuring that sufficient lipolytic enzymes are available to catalyze absorption of dietary lipid nutrients. We also took advantage of the availability of mice lacking one or both of these lipolytic enzymes in the digestive tract to assess their importance in dictating susceptibility to diet-induced obesity. Animals and Diets—Wild type C57BL/6 mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The PTL–/– mice and CEL–/– mice in homogenous C57BL/6 background were generated in our laboratory as described previously (1Huggins K.W. Camarota L.M. Howles P.N. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42899-42905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 2Howles P.N. Carter C.P. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7196-7202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The PTL–/–, CEL–/– mice were produced by cross-breeding PTL–/– mice with CEL–/– mice. The double knock-out mice were fertile and did not display any obvious abnormalities. The genotype of all genetically modified mice was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of tail DNA as described (1Huggins K.W. Camarota L.M. Howles P.N. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42899-42905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 2Howles P.N. Carter C.P. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7196-7202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). All animals were maintained in a temperature and humidity-controlled room with a 12-h light/dark cycle. The mice were maintained on two types of diet obtained from Harlan Teklad (Madison, WI). The low fat control diet was a rodent chow (LM-485), whereas the high fat/high cholesterol Western-type diet (TD88137) contained 21% fat, 0.15% cholesterol and 48.5% carbohydrate by weight. The Western-type diet was introduced at 8–9 weeks of age and continued for the duration of experiments as indicated. All animal protocols used in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Cincinnati. Only male mice were used to generate data in this study to avoid estrous cycle variations that may introduce confounding factors in data interpretation. Determination of Net Lipid Absorption in Mice—Triacylglycerol absorption in mice was assessed using sucrose polybehenate as a nonabsorbable marker as described previously (8Jandacek R.J. Heubi J.E. Tso P. Gastroenterology. 2004; 127: 139-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, a diet mimicking the Harlan Teklad Western-type diet was prepared. The composition of the diet included 42.2% nonfat dry milk, 36.6% sucrose, and 21.2% fat (wt/wt). The fat component consisted of 94.25% anhydrous milk fat, 0.75% cholesterol, and 5% sucrose polybehenate (wt/wt). Mice were fed this powdered preparation for 4 days, and fecal samples were collected daily. Individual fecal samples of ∼10 mg as well as the original powdered diet were dried and analyzed. Esterified fatty acids were chemically hydrolyzed by the addition of 0.5 n NaOH in methanol followed by heating to 80 °C in a water bath for 5 min. Derivatization of the fatty acids to their respective methyl esters was accomplished by addition of boron trifluoride in methanol and reheating to 80 °C. Finally, hexane and a saturated solution of NaCl were added followed by rigorous vortexing. The aqueous and organic phases were allowed to separate, and the organic fraction was transferred to a vial containing sodium sulfate to dry the sample. Analysis of the fatty acid methyl esters was accomplished by gas chromatography. Fat absorption was calculated based on the ratio of fatty acids to behenic acid in the diet versus that in the feces. Net cholesterol absorption was determined in mice consuming the Western-type diet for 4 weeks using the dual isotope procedure described previously (2Howles P.N. Carter C.P. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7196-7202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Mice were housed individually and fed ad libitum before receiving a bolus of 100 μlof olive oil containing 2 μCi of [14C]cholesterol (GE Healthcare), 0.2 mg of cholesterol (Sigma), and 0.5 μCi of [3H]sitostanol (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) by stomach gavage. Mice continued to have free access to food and water. Feces were collected after 24 and 48 h. The feces were homogenized in water and then extracted with twice the volume of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). An aliquot of the organic phase from each sample was used for scintillation counting to determine the amount of radioactive sterols present. Recovery of nonabsorbed cholesterol in feces was corrected based on the amount of [3H]sitostanol measured in each sample. Absorption of [14C]cholesterol was determined as a percentage of the administered dose as described (2Howles P.N. Carter C.P. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7196-7202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Determination of Lipid Nutrient Absorption Rates—The rates of TAG and retinyl palmitate absorption were determined based on methods described previously (1Huggins K.W. Camarota L.M. Howles P.N.

Briefly, wild type, PTL–/–, CEL–/–, and PTL–/–, CEL–/– mice fed the Western-type diet for 31 weeks were fasted for 14 h with access to water. The mice were then administered Poloxamer 407 (Pluronic F-127 from BASF Corporation, Parsippany, NJ) at a dose of 1 g/kg of body weight by intraperitoneal injection to block lipolysis and clearance of postprandial triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins (9Palmer W.K. Emeson E.E. Johnston T.P. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 136: 115-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A test meal containing 1 μCi of [3H]retinyl palmitate and 1.5 μCi of [14C]tripalmitin (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) in 100 μl of olive oil was administered by stomach gavage 15 min after Poloxamer 407 injection. In selected experiments 1 μCi of [3H]retinyl palmitate and 1.5 μCi of [14C]cholesteryl oleate (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) were introduced into each mouse in phospholipid vesicles prepared by sonicating the radiolabeled lipids in water containing 35 μg/ml of phosphatidylcholine (2Howles P.N. Carter C.P. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7196-7202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Plasma samples were obtained from the animals via tail bleeding at 0, 1, 3, 6, and 9 h after delivery of the test meal. The appearance of 3H and 14C in plasma was measured via scintillation counting and used to determine the rate of absorption of retinyl palmitate and TAG or cholesteryl esters, respectively. Food Intake—Mice consuming the high fat/high cholesterol Western-type diet were housed individually. A weighed amount of food was presented to mice in the manner that it is normally supplied, and the food hoppers were weighed every 2 days for 8 consecutive days. Mice were returned to their usual housing environment including cohabitating with their cohorts for 1 month. The procedure was then repeated, and the average daily food intake was determined for each mouse from these 16 days of analysis. Body Composition Assessment—Body composition was analyzed by quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (10Taicher G.Z. Tinsley F.C. Reiderman A. Heiman M.L. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2003; 377: 990-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) using an EcoMRI apparatus (Echo Medical Systems, Houston, TX), which allows the determination of fat and lean mass of live mice. Analysis was applied to 11-, 16-, and 25-week-old mice consuming the low fat chow diet or 16- and 25-week old mice fed the high fat/high cholesterol diet beginning at 9 weeks of age. Lipid, Glucose, and Insulin Determinations—Mice consuming chow or the Western-type diet for ∼40 weeks were fasted for 14 h. Glucose levels were determined using an Accu-Check Glucometer (Roche Diagnostics) from a drop of blood obtained through the tail vein. Plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels were measured with commercially available colorimetric assay kits made by ThermoElectron Corp. (Fisher). Lipids were also extracted from the liver by adding 4 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) to 100 mg of liver homogenates in 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) and 0.02 μCi of [3H]triolein. After phase separation, 1 ml of the organic phase was removed, dried under nitrogen, and resuspended in ethanol. Triglyceride and cholesterol contents were determined by colorimetric assay kits as described above. The efficiency of lipid extraction was normalized based on recovery of the radiolabel. Fasting plasma insulin levels were determined from age-matched mice consuming either the chow or the Western-type diet for 11 weeks. Plasma was collected via tail bleeding after an overnight fast. Insulin in the plasma was measured using a fluorescence-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay from Linco Research (Millipore, Billerica, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Pancreatic Expression of PTL-related Protein-2 (PTLRP2)—Pancreati were removed from mice promptly after exsanguination. Approximately 50 mg of pancreas was placed in RNA-Later (Ambion, Austin, TX). Total RNA was isolated using TR1 Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH), and 0.5 μg was used for reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification using the iScript One-Step reverse transcription-PCR kit (Bio-Rad). Relative levels of PTLRP2 were quantified via real time PCR using cyclophilin as a reference gene and SYBR green for detection on a Bio-Rad iCycler apparatus. The forward primer for PTLRP2 is 5′-GGATGATTCAGCGGCCTTCG-3′, and the reverse primer sequence is 5′-TCTCTGGGCTGTACCCCATC-3′. The primers used for amplification of cyclophilin were designed as described (11Agellon L.B. Drover V.A.B. Cheema S.K. Gbaguidi G.F. Walsh A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20131-20134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Data were evaluated using 2-tailed Student's t test of independent groups with the assumption of unequal variances. Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. unless indicated otherwise in the figure legend. Results from genetically modified mice were compared with wild type mice, with statistical significant difference recognized at p < 0.05. Triacylglycerol and Cholesterol Absorption in Mice—We have previously reported a reduced rate of TAG absorption in PTL–/– mice, but overall fat absorption efficiency was similar between PTL+/+ and PTL–/– mice when they were maintained on a low fat chow diet (1Huggins K.W. Camarota L.M. Howles P.N. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42899-42905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Likewise, dietary fat absorption was similar between chow-fed CEL+/+ and CEL–/– mice (3Weng W. Li L. van Bennekum A.M. Potter S.H. Harrison E.H. Blaner W.S. Breslow J.L. Fisher E.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4143-4149Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 12Kirby R.J. Zheng S. Tso P. Howles P.N. Hui D.Y. J. Biol.

The current study examined TAG absorption in PTL–/–, CEL–/–, and PTL–/–, CEL–/– double knock-out mice when the animals were maintained under high fat/high cholesterol dietary conditions utilizing the nonabsorbable lipid-based tracer sucrose polybehenate as a marker of nonabsorbed lipid excreted in feces (8Jandacek R.J. Heubi J.E. Tso P. Gastroenterology. 2004; 127: 139-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Results showed no difference in the amount of TAG absorbed from a test diet between wild type and CEL–/– mice even under high fat/high cholesterol dietary conditions (Fig. 1). However, in contrast to previous results using fecal fat content assessment to show no difference in TAG absorption between wild type and PTL–/– mice (1Huggins K.W. Camarota L.M. Howles P.N. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42899-42905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), use of the more sensitive tracer fat recovery method in the current study revealed a modest but statistically significant reduction in TAG absorption in PTL–/– mice when the animals were maintained on this Western-type diet (91.5 ± 0.7% for wild type versus 80.1 ± 3.6% for PTL–/– mice). Intriguingly, the lack of both PTL and CEL resulted in a dramatic reduction in fat absorption (61.1 ± 3.8%, p < 0.001 versus wild type mice). Analysis of individual fatty acids in the feces by gas chromatography indicated that saturation and chain length were not factors affecting the decreased absorption in the double knock-out mice, as the absorption was reduced regardless of the fatty acid species measured. As reported previously (1Huggins K.W. Camarota L.M. Howles P.N. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42899-42905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 2Howles P.N. Carter C.P. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7196-7202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), cholesterol absorption was significantly reduced in PTL–/– mice but not in CEL–/– mice when they were maintained on the high fat/high cholesterol diet (Fig. 2). Inactivation of the CEL gene did not cause additional reduction of cholesterol absorption in PTL–/– mice as cholesterol absorption was similar between PTL–/– and PTL–/–, CEL–/– mice (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Cholesterol absorption efficiency in mice consuming a high fat/high cholesterol diet. Mice maintained on the high fat/high cholesterol diet for 4 weeks received 2 μCi of [14C]cholesterol, 0.2 mg of cholesterol, and 0.5 μCi of [3H]sitostanol in 100 μl of olive oil by stomach gavage. Fecal matter was collected after 24 and 48 h, homogenized in water, and then extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). Scintillation counting was used to determine the amount of radioactive sterols present in the organic phase. Recovery of nonabsorbed cholesterol in feces was corrected based on the amount of [3H]sitostanol in each sample. Absorption of cholesterol is presented as a percentage of the administered dose and is representative of two experiments. Shown is the means ± S.E. for n = 9 wild type (WT), n = 7 PTL–/–, n = 10 CEL–/–, and n = 9 PTL–/–, CEL–/– mice. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 (differences from wild type mice).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Rate of Lipid Nutrient Absorption in Mice—The rates of dietary TAG, long chain retinyl ester, and cholesteryl ester absorption by wild type, PTL–/–, CEL–/–, and PTL–/–, CEL–/– mice were compared by determining the accumulation of radiolabeled lipids in plasma after Poloxamer 407 injection followed by oral administration of radiolabeled lipids by gavage. As shown in Fig. 3A, the rate of appearance of radioactivity in plasma after [14C]tripalmitin administration was much slower in PTL–/– mice than in wild type mice, with 47% less 14C radioactivity detected in the circulation of PTL–/– mice after 9 h (Fig. 3A). A small but significantly more pronounced decrease in the rate of [14C]tripalmitin absorption was observed in the [PTL–/–, CEL–/–] mice (Fig. 3A). At the 9-h time point, 52% less [14C]tripalmitin absorption occurred in the double knock-out mice compared with that in wild type mice (Fig. 3A). The rate of retinyl ester absorption was assessed initially by feeding [3H]retinyl palmitate mixed in olive oil to mice fed the high fat/high cholesterol diet. Results of these experiments showed the rate of retinyl ester absorption was similar between wild type and CEL–/– mice (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the rate and amount of retinyl ester absorption over a 9-h period were significantly reduced in PTL–/– mice (Fig. 3B). The rate and amount of retinyl ester absorption were further decreased in PTL–/–, CEL–/– mice (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, the differences in rate and efficiency of retinyl ester absorption between wild type, PTL–/–, CEL–/–, and PTL–/–, CEL–/– mice paralleled their differences in rate and efficiency of TAG absorption (Fig. 3A), suggesting that TAG digestion may be required for efficient retinyl ester absorption. Alternatively, their difference in retinyl ester absorption may be directly related to the effectiveness of PTL and CEL in retinyl ester hydrolysis before the absorption of the [3H]retinol by enterocytes in the brush border. These possibilities were explored by using phospholipid vesicles instead of olive oil as the vehicle to deliver [3H]retinyl palmitate to mice. The latter study was also carried out in mice maintained on a low fat chow diet to avoid the confounding variable of differences in digestion of dietary TAG altering retinyl ester digestion and absorption rates. The delivery of [3H]retinyl palmitate in this manner resulted in greater than 30% of the radiolabel appearing in plasma after 9 h in wild type mice (Fig. 3C) compared with ∼5% when olive oil was used as the vehicle to deliver retinyl ester to high fat/high cholesterol-fed mice (Fig. 3B). Importantly, the trends in rate and amount of retinyl ester absorption between wild type, PTL–/–, CEL–/–, and PTL–/–, CEL–/– mice remained the same, with wild type and CEL–/– mice being the most efficient and the PTL–/–, CEL–/– mice the least efficient regardless of the vehicle used for retinyl ester delivery (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these results indicated that whereas the presence of TAG in the digestive tract is one variable that dictates retinyl ester absorption, PTL is the major enzyme in the intestinal lumen responsible for retinyl ester digestion and absorption in vivo and that CEL may also participate in this process especially under conditions where PTL is limiting. The decreased retinyl ester absorption observed in PTL–/– mice is consistent with the in vitro data demonstrating the ability of PTL to hydrolyze retinyl esters in addition to its well established role in TAG hydrolysis (7van Bennekum A.M. Fisher E.A. Blaner W.S. Harrison E.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4900-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In view of numerous studies using dietary retinyl esters as tracers for cholesteryl ester metabolism in vivo (13Cohn J.S. Johnson E.J. Millar J.S. Cohn S.D. Milne R.W. Marcel Y.L. Russell R.M. Schaefer E.J. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 2033-2040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Le N.A. Coates P.M. Gallagher P.R. Cortner J.A. Metabolism. 1997; 46: 584-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we also tested the ability of PTL–/– mice to absorb cholesteryl ester. Results depicted in Fig. 3D show similar levels of [14C]cholesteryl oleate absorption by wild type and PTL–/– mice. In contrast, [14C]cholesteryl oleate absorption was dramatically reduced in the CEL–/– mice as expected. Because cholesteryl ester absorption was nearly eliminated in CEL–/– mice, no further reduction of [14C]cholesteryl oleate absorption was observed in the PTL–/–, CEL–/– mice (Fig. 3D). Diet-induced Hypercholesterolemia and Insulin Resistance in Mice—The difference in dietary lipid absorption efficiency between wild type mice and mice with various lipolytic enzyme deficiencies resulted in their differences in sensitivity to chronic feeding of a high fat/high cholesterol diet. Whereas wild type, PTL–/–, CEL–/–, and PTL–/–, CEL–/– mice displayed similar fasting plasma TAG, cholesterol, and glucose levels when fed the low fat chow diet and these values were increased when fed a Western-type high fat/high cholesterol diet regardless of their lipolytic enzyme genotypes, plasma cholesterol levels were 36 and 45% less in PTL–/– and PTL–/–, CEL–/– mice than those observed in wild type and CEL–/– mice after feeding the Western-type diet for 40 weeks (Table 1). Consumption of the Western-type diet did not alter fasting plasma TAG levels in these animals regardless of their genotypes. The normal TAG levels observed in these animals after feeding the Western-type diet is consistent with rapid clearance of dietary TAG from circulation after absorption through the intestine. These data also indicated that PTL and CEL participate only in the lipid absorption process in the digestive tract, and these enzymes are not involved in plasma TAG metabolism. The reduced severity of hypercholesterolemia and liver weight gain in response to Western diet feeding in PTL–/– and PTL–/–, CEL–/– mice compared with wild type and CEL–/– mice is also consistent with the reduced lipid absorption in these animals (Table 1).TABLE 1Characteristics of mice fed chow or Western-type dietGenotypeWild typePTL-/-CEL-/-PTL-/-,CEL-/-Chow n = 10Western n = 9Chow n = 9Western n = 9Chow n = 9Western n = 8Chow n = 10Western n = 9PlasmaTriglyceride (mg/dl)53.5 ± 7.059.2 ± 1.959.2 ± 5.162.4 ± 4.048.2 ± 4.367.6 ± 3.641.4 ± 2.659.1 ± 3.1Cholesterol (mg/dl)38.9 ± 5.6434 ± 5142.5 ± 2.6277 ± 31aSignificant difference from wild type mice at p < 0.01.43.5 ± 1.4401 ± 2153.3 ± 4.7238 ± 22aSignificant difference from wild type mice at p < 0.01.Glucose (mg/dl)107 ± 4148 ± 4110 ± 4143 ± 5112 ± 4147 ± 3103 ± 3148 ± 8Insulin (pg/dl)488 ± 83907 ± 69484 ± 139642 ± 63bSignificant difference from wild type mice at p < 0.05.293 ± 33736 ± 25491 ± 44506 ± 93aSignificant difference from wild type mice at p < 0.01.LiverWeight (g)1.28 ± 0.025.78 ± 0.291."
https://openalex.org/W2044378325,"Recently, we reported prognostic significance of thromboxane synthase (TXAS) gene expression in invasive bladder cancer. The positive correlation between elevated TXAS expression and shorter patient survival supports a potential role for TXAS-regulated pathways in tumor metastases. In this study, using immunohistochemical analysis, we found an increased expression of TXAS protein in bladder cancer. Treatment of T24 and transitional cell carcinoma TCC-SUP bladder cancer cells with the TXAS inhibitors furegrelate or ozagrel induced an apoptotic effect measured as an increase in caspase-3 activation and cell death, and decreased survivin expression. Pharmacological inhibition of TXAS using the TXAS inhibitor furegrelate increased sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic agents cisplatin and paclitaxel. Molecular inhibition of TXAS expression by siRNA significantly decreased cell growth and migration. In concordance with the pharmacological data, siRNA-mediated reduction of TXAS expression increased sensitivity to cisplatin and paclitaxel in T24 and TCC-SUP cells. In summary, the data support a role for the thromboxane A(2) pathway in the pathogenesis of bladder cancer and the potential utility of modulation of this signaling pathway for cancer chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W1992115256,"Ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis plays an important role in regulating fundamental biological functions, including cell division and cellular differentiation. Previous studies implicate the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in myogenic differentiation through regulating cell cycle progression and modulating myogenic factors such as MyoD and Myf5. Certain ubiquitin protein ligases, including the SCF complex and APC, have been suggested to govern terminal muscle differentiation. However, the underlying mechanism of regulation of both the cell cycle and myogenic factors by the UPS during this process remains unclear. We have dissected the role of the UPS in myogenic differentiation using an in vitro muscle differentiation system based on C2C12 cells. We demonstrate that Cdh1-APC regulates two critical proteins, Skp2 and Myf5, for proteolysis during muscle differentiation. The targeting of Skp2 by Cdh1-APC for destruction results in elevation of p21 and p27, which are crucial for coordinating cellular division and differentiation. Degradation of Myf5 by Cdh1-APC facilitates myogenic fusion. Knockdown of Cdh1 by siRNA significantly attenuates muscle differentiation. Taken together, Cdh1-APC is an important ubiquitin E3 ligase that modulates muscle differentiation through coordinating cell cycle progression and initiating the myogenic differentiation program."
https://openalex.org/W1978833929,"Transcription factor haploinsufficiency plays a role in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including cancer. In a mouse model of prostate tumor initiation, loss of a single allele of the tumor suppressor Nkx3.1 stochastically inactivates the expression of a class of dosage-sensitive target genes.

When histone acetylation is induced in Nkx3.1+/- mouse prostates with the histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A, Nkx3.1 can bind to and reactivate the expression of dosage-sensitive target genes. We incorporated our findings into a mathematical model that entails the association of Nkx3.1 with histone acetyltransferase activity.

Our results reveal how the interplay between transcription factor dosage and chromatin affects target gene expression in tumor initiation. Haploinsufficiency, in which one allele of a gene is unable to support normal cellular function, has been associated with many human disorders, including cancer and developmental defects (1Seidman J.G. Seidman C. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 2Quon K.C. Berns A. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2917-2921Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In tumorigenesis, haploinsufficiency may allow the clonal expansion of cells carrying a single mutated copy of a tumor suppressor gene, thereby increasing the size of the target cell population available for subsequent mutations during the course of tumor progression (2Quon K.C.

Haploinsufficiency can be detrimental to various regulatory processes in cell biology such as cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and DNA synthesis or repair (3Cook D.L. Gerber A.N. Tapscott S.J. Proc.

Several tumor suppressor genes, including Trp53, Dmp1, and Nkx3.1, encode transcription factors that demonstrate haploinsufficiency where loss of one allele is sufficient for the development of pre-neoplastic and neoplastic lesions (4Cook W.D.

Increased stochasticity or noise in gene expression may contribute to haploinsufficiency by increasing the variability in cellular behavior or phenotype (3Cook D.L. Gerber A.N. Tapscott S.J. Proc.

Nevertheless, at the molecular level, the mechanisms involved in haploinsufficient tumor suppression have remained unclear. Nkx3.1 is an androgen-regulated prostate-specific homeodomain-containing transcription factor. Prostate tumor initiation is often linked to the loss of heterozygosity at the NKX3.1 locus, and deletion of Nkx3.1 in mice leads to prostatic epithelial hyperplasia and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (8Bhatia-Gaur R. Donjacour A.A. Sciavolino P.J. Kim M. Desai N. Young P. Norton C.R. Gridley T. Cardiff R.D. Cunha G.R. Abate-Shen C. Shen M.M.

Gene expression profiling of the prostates of Nkx3.1-mutant mice has identified a class of genes that shows exquisite dosage sensitivity, i.e. the expression of these genes in Nkx3.1+/- cells was similar to that in Nkx3.1-/- cells (11Magee J.A. Abdulkadir S.A. Milbrandt J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 273-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition, Nkx3.1 dosage appeared to regulate target gene activation in a stochastic manner. These observations are consistent with a model of haploinsufficient tumor suppression in which reduction in Nkx3.1 dosage increases the probabilities of inactivation of select target genes important for tumorigenesis (11Magee J.A. Abdulkadir S.A. Milbrandt J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 273-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 12Abdulkadir S.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

In addition, the mechanisms involved in dosage-sensitive gene regulation by Nkx3.1 were unknown. Previous transgenic studies in mice and Drosophila suggest that stochastic expression of transgenes in response to alterations in transcription factor dosage is related to changes in higher order chromatin structure (13Lundgren M.

Cell. 2001; 104: 839-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) utilized a green fluorescent protein reporter subject to position-effect varigation in Drosophila to show a correlation between fluctuations of chromatin states and stochastic activation or inactivation of gene expression. More recent studies in budding yeast indicate a role for chromatin remodeling and interconversion between inactive to active promoter states in the control of stochasticity in gene expression (10Raser J.M.

In this study we have explored the mechanisms by which reduced Nkx3.1 dosage has dramatically different effects on the stochastic expression of individual endogenous target genes and the relevance of this form of gene regulation to tumorigenesis. Our results show a role for differential histone H3/H4 acetylation states and Nkx3.1 occupancy at target gene loci in dosage-sensitive gene regulation. We also show a role for a dosage-sensitive Nkx3.1 target gene in prostate tumorigenesis, providing the first functional evidence in support of the stochastic, dosage-sensitive gene regulation model of haploinsufficient tumor suppression.

The tissue was fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Fixation was stopped by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 125 mm. After several washes in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, the tissue pellet was resuspended in NEBA buffer (10 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA), dounce-homogenized, and incubated for 15 min on ice. Cell nuclei were collected and lysed with a lysis buffer. Chromatin was sheared to a size of ∼500-1000 base pairs and diluted 1:10 with ChIP dilution buffer. Samples were precleared and precipitated overnight at 4 °C with the following antibodies: pan-acetylated H3 (Upstate; 06-599), panacetylated H4 (Upstate; 06-598), Nkx3.1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; T-19X), PCAF (Santa Cruz; H-369X), and rabbit or mouse IgG (Santa Cruz). Immune complexes were collected with salmon sperm DNA-saturated protein-A/G-Sepharose for 3 h and washed extensively following the manufacturer's protocol. Samples were reverse cross-linked at 65 °C overnight with 0.3 m NaCl and 30 μg of RNase. Input and bound DNA were extracted with PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and analyzed by quantitative PCR (Applied Biosystems 7300) using SYBR Green. ChIP values are presented as -fold enrichment of antibody immunoprecipitation (normalized to antibody input) to isotype IgG control immunoprecipitation (normalized to IgG input), as described earlier (16Magee J.A.

Mouse Prostate Explants, TSA Treatment, and Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis—Mouse prostate explants were performed as described previously (19Mogal A. Abdulkadir S.A. Mol. Cell. Probes. 2006; 20: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, anterior prostates were excised, minced, and treated with either vehicle (ethanol), Trichostatin A (TSA) (Sigma) at a concentration of 500 ng/ml for 8 h or 5-azacytidine 1 μm for 24 h. Prostate tissue was harvested in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 50/50 medium. RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent, and cDNA was synthesized and analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR (Applied Biosystems 7300) using the SYBR Green method as described (19Mogal A. Abdulkadir S.A. Mol. Cell. Probes. 2006; 20: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The explant experiments were independently repeated under the same conditions. Western Blot Analysis—For Western blot analysis, lysates from anterior prostate tissue were prepared and probed with acetylated H3 antibody (Upstate). The membranes were stripped and reprobed with total H3 antibody as a loading control (Upstate) and Nkx3.1 antibody (Santa Cruz; T19). Lysates from stable knockdown LNCaP cells were prepared and probed with Nkx3.1, intelectin (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) and actin (Santa Cruz) antibodies. Co-immunoprecipitation—Lysates were prepared from LNCaP cells and wild type mouse prostate tissue. The lysates (500 μg of protein) were precleared with protein-A/G Plus-agarose beads and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg each of rabbit IgG, goat IgG, Nkx3.1, or PCAF antibodies (Santa Cruz). Immune complexes were collected and washed three to five times with ice-cold extraction buffer. The precipitated protein complexes were analyzed by Western blotting. RNA Interference—Lentiviral NKX3.1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) construct (RHS4186) and retroviral intelectin shRNA construct (RHS1764) were purchased from Open Biosystems. Intelectin shRNA was cloned into the same lentiviral vector for a valid comparison with shNKX3.1. The constructs were transfected into LNCaP cells with Superfect reagent (Qiagen). Stable pooled clones were selected in complete medium supplemented with 500 μg/ml of G418 for 2 weeks and knockdown efficiency was confirmed by Western blotting. Cell Count—For cell count, 1 × 105 cells were seeded in 10-cm plates in duplicates supplemented with a complete RPMI medium and counted at the indicated times. At least two independent experiments were performed. Results are presented as mean ± S.D. MTT Assays—LNCaP/shNKX3.1 or DU145 cells were seeded at a density of 103 cells in quadruplicate in a 96-well flat-bottomed tissue culture plate (Fisher) in 100 μl of complete medium. Intelectin expression vector coexpressing green fluorescent protein (20Yang R.Z. Lee M.J. Hu H. Pray J. Wu H.B. Hansen B.C. Shuldiner A.R. Fried S.K. McLenithan J.C. Gong D.W. Am. J.

At variable indicated times 10 μl of 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT reagent) (ATCC) was added to each well and incubated for 2-4 h at 37 °C until purple precipitates were visible. The reaction was terminated by addition of 100 μl of detergent reagent in the dark for 2 h, and the absorbance was recorded at 570 nm. Western blot was used to monitor transfected protein expression. At least two independent experiments were performed. Results are presented as mean ± S.D. Soft Agar Colony Formation Assays—For soft agar colony formation assay, 0.8 × 105 cells were suspended in a complete RPMI medium containing 0.3% of agarose and overlaid onto a bottom layer of solidified 0.5% agar in a complete RPMI medium. The colonies (>0.5-mm size) were counted after 2 weeks under a light microscope. At least two independent experiments were performed. Results are presented as mean ± S.D. Xenograft Studies—Cells (2 × 106) were suspended in Matrigel (BD Biosciences) for a total volume of 400 μl/injection site and injected subcutaneously in right and left flanks of male athymic mice (8 weeks old) (Jackson Laboratories). Mice were monitored daily, and tumor sizes were measured twice weekly in two dimensions (width, W and length, L) with calipers. Average tumor volume (V) was calculated as V = 0.5 × L × W2.At the termination of the experiment, mice were sacrificed; tumors were excised and weighed. All animal care followed approved institutional guidelines of Vanderbilt University. Results are presented as mean ± S.D. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed by Student's t-test, and results were considered significant at p ≤ 0.05. Results are presented as mean ± S.D. Mathematical Model—Let Ga(t) denote the level of active genes at time t, Gin(t) the level of inactive genes, Nkx(t) the level of Nkx3.1, HAT(t) the level of histone acetyltransferase, NkxHAT(t) the level of the Nkx3.1-HAT complex, and mRNA(t) the level of target gene mRNA (either intelectin or probasin). The mRNA pathway is characterized by three constants: K1, K2, and K3. We assume that the total number of genes, G0, is conserved so that Ga(t) + Gin(t) = G0. Using compartment analysis, we can write down individual differential equations for a compartment, e.g. the active gene compartment. Individual components in the pathway do not necessarily mean creation or consumption of the substance in the compartment. For example, mRNA dynamics are governed by Ga(t) and Nkx(t), but these components are not consumed in the creation of mRNA(t). Using the above scheme and the diagram in Fig. 4A, we construct a system of ordinary differential equations as shown in Equations 1-4. d(NkxHAT)dt=λ⋅Nkx⋅HAT (Eq. 1) d(Ga)dt=−K2⋅Ga+K1⋅NkxHAT⋅Gin (Eq. 2) d(Gin)dt=−K2⋅Ga−K1⋅NkxHAT⋅Gin (Eq. 3) d(mRNA)dt=K3⋅Nkx⋅Ga (Eq. 4) Notice that if we add the second and third differential equations, we find the following as shown in Equation 5. d(Ga)dt+d(Gin)dt=0⇒Ga(t)+Gin(t)=G0=constant(Eq. 5) This permits us to replace Gin(t) by G0 - Ga(t). Using this expression in the differential equation for Ga(t), we find the following as shown in Equation 6. d(Ga)dt=−K2⋅Ga+K1⋅NkxHAT⋅(G0−Ga)(Eq. 6) Hence, the model simplifies to the coupled system as shown in Equations 7 and 8 d(Ga)dt=−K2⋅Ga+K1⋅NkxHAT⋅(G0−Ga)(Eq. 7) d(NkxHAT)dt=λ⋅Nkx⋅HAT⇒NkxHAT(t)=NkxHAT(0)+λ∫0tNkx(τ)⋅HAT(τ)dτ(Eq. 8) where λ is a constant that determines the rate of formation of the Nkx3.1-HAT complex, HAT(t) is a prescribed function, and Nkx(t) an experimentally determined function (11Magee J.A. Abdulkadir S.A. Milbrandt J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 273-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), assuming that Nkx3.1 mRNA levels reflect protein levels. The outcome variable for the model is mRNA(t). This can be computed by integrating the differential equation for mRNA(t), in particular, as shown in Equation 9. mRNA(t)=mRNA(0)+K3∫0tNkx(τ)⋅Ga(τ)dτ(Eq. 9) We will take mRNA(0) = 0. The mRNA(t) represents target gene levels (intelectin or probasin). The dynamics of the model are dependent on the ratio of initial conditions, Ga(0)/Gin(0), which reflects target gene chromatin accessibility and introduces a stochastic component into the model, and the functions Nkx(t) and HAT(t). For the simulations in this report, we have assumed that HAT(t) = constant, HAT(0) and NkxHAT(0) = 0. For modeling the effects of TSA, the kinetic parameter and the chromatin accessibility represented by the initial active/inactive gene ratio R0 = Ga(0)/Gin(0) are assumed to depend on the TSA level, which we assume is constant over the course of the experiment. Our mathematical formulation for the effect of TSA (suitably normalized to be dimensionless) on K2 is given by the relationship K2 = α(1 - μ(TSA)σ(R0)) as shown in Equation 10 μ(TSA)=TSAKμ+TSAand σ(R)=1−RKσ+R (Eq. 10) where α is a constant. In the simulations, we have assumed that TSA and R0 are fixed in time. The constants Kμ and Kσ were chosen to fit the experimental data. In our model, the rate constants for intelectin and probasin were kept the same, although in theory they could be different. Remarkably, differentiating between probasin and intelectin by the initial active/inactive gene ratio (i.e. chromatin accessibility) alone, keeping all other parameters constant, was sufficient to simulate experimental findings. All simulations were performed with Mathematica (Wolfram Research, Inc., Champaign, IL). Differential Histone H3/H4 Acetylation and Nkx3.1 Occupancy at Dosage-sensitive and -insensitive Target Gene Loci—We reasoned that Nkx3.1 dosage-sensitive and stochastic gene regulation may be mediated by the differential chromatin accessibilities of target gene loci. To investigate this, we examined the histone H3/H4 acetylation states of the promoter regions of two representative target genes in mouse prostate, intelectin and probasin (11Magee J.A. Abdulkadir S.A. Milbrandt J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 273-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Probasin is a prostate-specific differentiation marker (21Kasper S. Matusik R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) that is insensitive to Nkx3.1 dosage, whereas intelectin is a d-galactosyl-specific lectin that is also known as omentin, an adipocytokine (22Tsuji S. Uehori J. Matsumoto M. Suzuki Y. Matsuhisa A. Toyoshima K. Seya T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23456-23463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 23Schaffler A. Neumeier M. Herfarth H. Furst A. Scholmerich J. Buchler C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1732: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Intelectin shows exquisite sensitivity to Nkx3.1 dosage, with its expression in Nkx3.1+/- cells approximating the levels seen in Nkx3.1-/- cells (11Magee J.A. Abdulkadir S.A. Milbrandt J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 273-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We used ChIP to profile the histone H3 and H4 acetylation patterns in the 2-kb regions of the intelectin and probasin promoters in Nkx3. mutant mouse prostate tissues (Fig. 1, A and B, and supplemental Table S1). The intelectin promoter showed higher levels of histone H3 and H4 acetylation in Nkx3.1+/+ mice compared with Nkx3.1+/- or Nkx3.1-/- animals, particularly at a region (Int5) that was subsequently found to contain a consensus Nkx3.1 binding site (TAAGTG) (24Steadman D.J. Giuffrida D. Gelmann E.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2389-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) by sequence analysis (Fig. 1A). By contrast, on the probasin promoter, H3 and H4 acetylation levels were high in Nkx3.1+/+ and Nkx3.1+/- mice and low in Nkx3.1-/- mice (Fig. 1B). Next we examined in vivo binding of Nkx3.1 at the intelectin and probasin promoters in Nkx3.1 mutant mice by ChIP. Nkx3.1 was bound at the Int5 region of the intelectin promoter in Nkx3.1+/+ but not in Nkx3.1+/- mice, whereas Nkx3.1 binding to the Pbn1 region of the probasin promoter (containing a consensus Nkx3.1 site) was observed in both Nkx3.1+/+ and Nkx3.1+/- mice (Fig. 1C). We used a mouse androgen receptor promoter region containing a consensus Nkx3.1 binding site (AR) as a positive control (25Lei Q. Jiao J. Xin L. Chang C.J. Wang S. Gao J. Gleave M.E. Witte O.N. Liu X. Wu H. Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 367-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) for Nkx3.1 ChIP, while Int2 and Pbn4 regions (which do not contain Nkx3.1 consensus) served as negative controls. Thus, expression of intelectin and probasin correlated with the overall histone H3/H4 acetylation states of their promoter regions and Nkx3.1 occupancy in mice of various genotypes. Induction of Histone Hyperacetylation with a HDAC Inhibitor Allows Nkx3.1 Binding and Reactivation of Dosage-sensitive Target Gene Expression in Nkx3.1+/- Mouse Prostates—Our results thus far indicate that in Nkx3.1+/- prostate cells, the probasin promoter is hyperacetylated at histones H3/H4, resulting in an “open” chromatin configuration that allows Nkx3.1 binding and activation of gene expression. The intelectin promoter on the other hand is in a hypoacetylated, “closed” chromatin state that precludes Nkx3.1 binding and gene activation. If so, then increasing chromatin accessibility by inducing histone H3/H4 hyperacetylation might allow Nkx3.1 binding to the intelectin promoter and gene activation in Nkx3.1 heterozygous cells. To ascertain this, we treated mouse prostate tissue explants with the histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA (26Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). The efficacy of our treatment regimen was evident from results of Western blot analyses for acetylated histone H3 (Fig. 2A, upper panel). TSA treatment did not have a discernible effect on Nkx3.1 protein expression (lower panel). ChIP analysis of the intelectin promoter indicates that TSA treatment led to a significant increase in H3/H4 acetylation in Nkx3.1+/- mouse prostates, particularly in the Int5 region (Fig. 2B and 2D, middle panels). Notably, the levels of histone H3 acetylation observed at the Int5 region in Nkx3.1+/- mice after TSA treatment approximate the baseline levels seen in Nkx3.1+/+ mice (Fig. 2B). By contrast, TSA treatment had modest or minimal effects on histone H3/H4 acetylation at the intelectin promoter in Nkx3.1+/+ and Nkx3.1-/- mice or the probasin promoter in all genotypes (Fig. 2, B-E). These results support the notion that acetylation is a dynamic process and there may be a limit to the maximum acetylation achievable at any promoter. They also suggest that Nkx3.1 may be involved in setting the histone H3/H4 acetylation states of its target genes. Using ChIP, we next showed that TSA treatment promotes the binding of Nkx3.1 to the Int5 region but not a control region in Nkx3.1+/- mice (Fig. 3A). Importantly, TSA treatment also significantly induced intelectin mRNA expression in Nkx3.1+/- mice as assessed by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 3B). The expression of another dosage-sensitive Nkx3.1 target gene, Pdzk1, was also induced by TSA treatment in Nkx3.1+/- mice (Fig. 3C), whereas the expression of the dosage-insensitive genes probasin and Sel1L (11Magee J.A. Abdulkadir S.A. Milbrandt J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 273-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) remained largely unaffected (Fig. 3, D and E). Notably, none of these genes was reactivated by TSA treatment in Nkx3.1-/- mice, emphasizing the requirement for Nkx3.1 in gene induction. We note that both intelectin and Pdzk1 were induced by TSA in Nkx3.1+/- mice to levels 3- to 4-fold above their respective expression levels in wild type mice and that TSA treatment did not lead to a further increase in the expression of any of the genes tested in Nkx3.1+/+ prostates. Apart from the histone modifications, DNA methylation is another common epigenetic event important for regulating gene expression (27Jones P.A. Baylin S.B. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 415-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, we investigated the possible involvement of DNA methylation in Nkx3.1 target gene regulation by using the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine (28Groudine M. Eisenman R. Weintraub H. Nature. 1981; 292: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Unlike TSA, treatment with 5-azacytidine did not have consistent effects on the expression of dosage-sensitive versus dosage-insensitive target genes (Fig. 3, B-E). Longer periods of 5-azacytidine treatment could not be tested due to toxicity. Reactivation of dosage-sensitive target genes by TSA emphasizes the role of histone acetylation in the regulation of these Nkx3.1 target genes. These results point to the chromatin accessibility of target gene loci as a major determining factor in the response of target genes to reduced dosages of activating transcription factors. The ability to restore the expression of dosage-sensitive genes with HDAC inhibitors may have important therapeutic implications for disorders due to haploinsufficiency of transcription factors. A Mathematical Model of Gene Activation by Nkx3.1—To gain further insights into the interactions between Nkx3.1 dosage and chromatin remodeling in target gene regulation, we incorporated our current results and earlier findings (11Magee J.A. Abdulkadir S.A. Milbrandt J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 273-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) into a mathematical model of gene activation by Nkx3.1 (Fig. 4A). Modeling can complement experimental findings and provide a framework that can be used to generate testable predictions. According to our model, a target gene can exist in an inactive/closed chromatin/hypoacetylated state or an active/open chromatin/hyperacetylated state competent for transcription. Due to the fact that we observed reduced histone H3/H4 acetylation in Nkx3.1 null cells and focal hyperacetylation in a region containing the Nkx3.1 binding site on the intelectin promoter, we assumed in the model that Nkx3.1 interacts with a histone acetyltransferase (8Bhatia-Gaur R.

In this study we investigated the molecular events elicited by oxidized low density lipoproteins (ox-LDL) in MC.

Moreover, as shown by the expression of the dominant negative Rac-1 construct, we first report that ox-LDL-mediated cell survival and cell cycle progression depend on Rac-1 GTPase-mediated reactive oxygen species production and on epidermal growth factor receptor transactivation. By silencing Akt and blocking Erk1/2 MAPK pathways, we also demonstrate that these signals are downstream to Rac-1/reactive oxygen species production and epidermal growth factor receptor activation. Finally, by endogenous depletion of β4 integrin, expressed in MC, we provide evidence that the expression of this adhesion molecule is essential for ox-LDL-mediated MC dysfunction.

The relevance of mitogen intracellular signaling in mesangial proliferative disease has only recently been recognized (2Kamanna V.S. Histol. Histopathol. 2002; 17: 497-505PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, accumulation of atherogenic lipoproteins within the glomerulus, by activating membrane receptor protein-tyrosine kinases (RPTK), such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), triggers MAPK cascades leading to cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase activation of DNA synthesis and MC proliferation (2Kamanna V.S.

Although superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide are generally considered to be toxic, recent evidence suggests that the production of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) might be an integral component of membrane receptor signaling (5Gulati P.

In mammalian cells, a vast array of intracellular stimuli have been shown to induce a transient increase in the intracellular ROS concentrations, and specific inhibition of ROS generation results in a complete blockage of stimulant-dependent signaling (5Gulati P.

In particular, growth factor-mediated ROS generation seems to be necessary for propagation of downstream mitogenic and antiapoptotic signals (5Gulati P. Klohn P.C. Krug H. Gottlicher M. Markova B. Bohmer F.D. Herrlich P. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).

However, despite a clear association between Rac-1 and ROS generation, the ROS-signaling targets are still poorly defined. Proliferation obeys a bimodal control by integrins and RPTKs, which together prime mitogenic signals in response to cell adhesion and growth factor, respectively (10Giancotti F.G. Tarone G. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 173-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Strong evidence indicates that integrins and RPTK-dependent signals need to be integrated at various levels to cause cell proliferation (10Giancotti F.G. Tarone G. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Data indicate that integrins such as β4 can trigger, independently of growth factor stimulation, intracellular signals leading to the activation of the Erk1/Erk2 MAPK, Shc-Ras-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Rac-1 signaling pathways (22Mainiero F.

The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms associated with hypercellularity of MC exposed to ox-LDL. Here we demonstrate that the Akt and the Erk1/2 MAPK signaling pathways are downstream events of ox-LDL-mediated Rac-1/ROS/EGFR-dependent cell survival and cell cycle progression, respectively. Moreover, by silencing β4 integrin we also provide evidence that β4 integrin acts upstream of the Rac-1/ROS-mediated pathway and cooperates with the EGFR to control ox-LDL-mediated MC cycle progression. Reagents—RPMI medium, bovine serum albumin, glycated human albumin, protein A-Sepharose, NAC, diphenylene iodonium (DPI), an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, propidium iodide, and cycloheximide were all from Sigma.

The density of the LDL was measured in the tubes where the highest levels of cholesterol were found. LDL was dialyzed against 0.02 m/liter EDTA-free phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m/liter NaCl. LDL was adjusted to 0.2 mg/ml protein concentration. CuSO4 was added for 24 h (37 °C) at a ratio of 25 μm/mg LDL protein (n-LDL). Oxidation was stopped by the addition of 1 mm/liter EDTA and 0.02 mm/liter butylated hydroxytoluene (26Vedie B. Myara I.

MC were transiently transfected with purified duplex siRNAs for Akt or β1 integrin and for scramble controls purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine, according to the vendor's instructions. Cell viability was evaluated at the end of the experiment. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—MC monolayers were serum-starved for 24 h at 37 °C and stimulated with different stimuli, as indicated. Cells were lysed, and protein concentration was obtained as described previously (30Brizzi M.F. Dentelli P. Gambino R. Cabodi S. Cassader M. Castelli A. Defilippi P. Pegoraro L. Pagano G. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3311-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In selected experiments the anti-EGFR pharmacological inhibitor, AG1478 (250 nm/liter), NAC (20 mm/liter), DPI (10 μm/liter), Erk1/2 MAPK inhibitor (35 μm/liter), PD98059, or blocking anti-LOX-1 antibody (1 μg/ml) were used. Proteins (50 μg) were separated on SDS-PAGE transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and analyzed by Western blot. Reaction with antibodies and detection with chemiluminescence system were performed as described previously (30Brizzi M.F. Dentelli P. Gambino R. Cabodi S. Cassader M. Castelli A. Defilippi P. Pegoraro L. Pagano G. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3311-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Flow Cytometry—To analyze cell cycle progression, MC were fixed with 70% ethanol. DNA was stained with propidium iodide and analyzed with a flow cytometer (FACScan, Immunocytometry Systems). In selected experiments DPI, AG1478, PD98059, or 1L6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol-2-(R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecyl-sn-glycerocarbonate (10 μm/liter) inhibitors and anti-LOX-1 antibody were used. The percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle was determined by ModFit LT software (Verity Software House, Inc., Topsham, ME). The fraction of apoptotic cells was quantified by analysis of the sub-G1 peak (sub-diploid cells). FACS was used for analyzing β4 and β1 integrins expression. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rat and anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) were used as secondary antibody. Detection of ROS—2′, 7′-Dichlorofluorescein diacetate (20 mm/liter final concentration) was added to MC in the various cultured conditions. At the times indicated the cells were subjected to FACS analysis and processed as described previously (25Brizzi M.F. Dentelli P. Pavan M. Rosso A. Gambino R. Grazia De C.M. Garbarino G. Camussi G. Pagano G. Pegoraro L. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). H2O2 (100 μm/liter) was used as a positive control. Assay for Rac1-GTP Loading—MC transfected with the dominant negative mutant of Rac-1 (V12N17Rac) or the corresponding empty vector (pEXV) were serum-deprived for 24 h and untreated or treated with ox-LDL. Cells were lysed as described (31Dentelli P. Rosso A. Garbarino G. Calvi C. Lombard E. Di Stefano P. Defilippi P. Pegoraro L. Brizzi M.F. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 6394-6405Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and incubated with recombinant GST-PAK precoupled to Sepharose-glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences) and then washed three times in lysis buffer (32Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). The GST-PAK pre-coupled Sepharose-glutathione beads were used to pull down GTP-bound Rac-1 from cell lysates. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were probed with an anti-Rac-1 antibody. Real-time Quantitative PCR—MC, preincubated or not with cycloheximide (20 μg/ml), were stimulated with ox-LDL (50 μg/ml). mRNA quantification was performed by real-time quantitative PCR, using the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence detection system and the SYBR Green Master Mix Kit (both from Applied Biosystems). β-Glucuronidase (GUS) gene was used as standard reference. The relative expression of β4 integrin was calculated by using comparative threshold cycle methods. The β4 primer sequences were as follows: sense (5′-GAA TTC GTT CTA CGC TCT CC-3′) and anti-sense (5′-GAA TTC TGA GAG ATG TGG GC-3′). Statistical Analysis—All in vitro results are representative of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate. Densitometric analysis using a Bio-Rad GS 250 molecular imager was used to calculate the differences in the fold induction of protein activation or expression (*, p < 0.05, statistically significant between experimental and control values). In selected experiments densitometric analysis was reported in Figs. 1, 2, 3 and 5. Significance of differences between experimental and control values were calculated using analysis of variance with Newman-Keuls multicomparison test.FIGURE 2Akt and Erk1/2 MAPK are activated in MC in response to ox-LDL.A, cell extracts from MC stimulated for the indicated time intervals with ox-LDL (50 μg/ml) or n-LDL (50 μg/ml) were analyzed by Western blot with an anti-total and anti-p-Erk1/2 MAPK, or anti-total and anti-p-Akt antibodies, respectively.

Greiber S. Kramer-Guth A. Heinloth A. Galle J. Kidney Int. 1997; 63: S102-S106Google Scholar). Mesangial cell cycle progression was evaluated in response to ox-LDL. In Table 1 we show that following 48 or 72 h of stimulation with ox-LDL, the proportion of cells in the S phase was increased. Conversely, as reported previously (33Brizzi M.F. Dentelli P. Rosso A. Calvi C. Gambino R. Cassader M. Salvidio G. Deferrari G. Camussi G. Pegoraro L. Pagano G. CavalloPerin P. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1249-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), AGE failed to induce cell cycle progression. A dose-response curve (from 10 to 100 μg/ml ox-LDL) indicated that ox-LDL concentrations above 60 μg/ml led to apoptosis. Thus, 50 μg/ml of ox-LDL were used throughout the study. Conversely, n-LDL did not change the percentage of cells in the S phase. Because similar results were obtained after 48 or 72 h of ox-LDL stimulation, 48 h of stimulation was used throughout the study. Cell cycle phases are coordinated by regulatory proteins, including cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, and cyclindependent kinase inhibitors. The expression of cyclin D1 and of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 was therefore assayed in ox-LDL-treated MC. Kinetic analysis (Fig. 1A) demonstrated that, consistent with the increase in the proportion of cells in the S phase, the expression of cyclin D1 but not that of p21 was detected. Moreover, to validate the role of the ox-LDL receptor LOX1 in mediating ox-LDL-induced cell cycle machinery, cyclin D1 expression was evaluated in MC pretreated with the blocking LOX1 antibody. The results, reported in Fig. 1B, demonstrate that the blockage of LOX1 completely abolished the induction of cyclin D1. Similarly the progression in the cell cycle (Table 2) was prevented by LOX1 blockage.TABLE 1Effect of ox-LDL on MC cell cycle progressionCell cycle phasesPercentage of cells48 h72 hControlOx-LDLFCS 10%AGEn-LDLControlOx-LDLFCS 10%AGEn-LDLG0/G156 ± 447 ± 345 ± 363 ± 555 ± 358 ± 440 ± 341 ± 368 ± 557 ± 4S36 ± 345 ± 4ap < 0.05, ox-LDL treatment or 10% fetal calf serum versus control is indicated.46 ± 3ap < 0.05, ox-LDL treatment or 10% fetal calf serum versus control is indicated.33 ± 3bp < 0.05 with AGE treatment versus control is indicated.37 ± 232 ± 348 ± 5ap < 0.05, ox-LDL treatment or 10% fetal calf serum versus control is indicated.50 ± 4ap < 0.05, ox-LDL treatment or 10% fetal calf serum versus control is indicated.28 ± 3bp < 0.05 with AGE treatment versus control is indicated.34 ± 3G2/M8 ± 18 ± 19 ± 24 ± 28 ± 210 ± 112 ± 19 ± 24 ± 29 ± 2a p < 0.05, ox-LDL treatment or 10% fetal calf serum versus control is indicated.b p < 0.05 with AGE treatment versus control is indicated.

Open table in a new tab Akt and Erk1/2 MAPK Signaling Pathways Are Activated in Response to Ox-LDL—MAPK signaling pathway has been reported to be associated with MC proliferation (2Kamanna V.S. Histol. Histopathol. 2002; 17: 497-505PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that in response to ox-LDL binding to LOX-1, Erk1/2 MAPK became activated (Fig. 2A). Moreover, consistent with data obtained in smooth muscle cells (4Auge N. Garcia V. Maupas-Schwalm F. Levade T. Salvayre R. Negre-Salvayre A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1990-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), ox-LDL but not n-LDL were also able to trigger Akt activation (Fig. 2A). It is known that Akt is involved in survival pathways rather than in mitogenic signals (34Toker A. Yoeli-Lerner M. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 3963-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Thus, to evaluate the role of Akt in the survival pathway, MC were transiently transfected with an Akt siRNA sequence (Fig. 2B). FACS analysis of MC depleted of Akt demonstrated that these cells failed to progress into the cell cycle (Table 3) and that almost 20% of the cells underwent apoptosis (Table 3), indicating that Akt signaling sustains a survival pathway. Similar results were obtained using a pharmacological inhibitor of Akt (Table 2). To evaluate the contribution of the MAPK signaling pathway in ox-LDL-mediated effects, FACS analysis was also performed in MC pretreated with the MAPK inhibitor PD98059. The results, reported in Table 3, demonstrated that treatment with PD98059 led to a decreased number of cells in the S phase and that, unlike in Akt silenced MC, no apoptotic cells could be detected, indicating that a discrete signaling pathway is activated by MAPK and Akt. As expected, MC treated with PD98059 showed a strong inhibition of Erk1/2 MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 2C).TABLE 3Role of Akt and MAPK on ox-LDL-mediated MC cell cy"

The quinone mainly exists in the following four proton-coupled redox forms: oxidized (FMN), semiquinone anion (FMN⋅¯ ), semiquinone neutral (FMNH·), and hydroquinone anion (FMN⋅¯ ) (1Niemz A. Rotello V.M. Acc. Chem. Res. 1999; 32: 44-52Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar). flavin mononucleotide semiquinone anion form semiquinone neutral form hydroquinone anion form FMN structure semiquinone structure hydroquinone structure backbone carbonyl. flavin mononucleotide semiquinone anion form semiquinone neutral form hydroquinone anion form FMN structure semiquinone structure hydroquinone structure backbone carbonyl. Because flavodoxins exist in these four states, they show two characteristic redox potentials (Em), namely, E1 and E2 (2Draper R.D. Ingraham L.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 125: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). E1 represents the Em for one-electron reduction from FMNH· to FMNH– (i.e. Em (FMNH·/FMNH–)). on the other hand, E2 represents the Em for proton-coupled one-electron reduction from FMN to FMNH· (i.e. E2:Em (FMN/FMNH·)). Crystal structures of native and mutant flavodoxins obtained from Clostridium beijerinckii are available in the following forms: oxidized FMN (OX structure), semiquinone (SQ structure), and hydroquinone (HQ structure) (3Ludwig M.L. Pattridge K.A. Metzger A.L. Dixon M.M. Eren M. Feng Y. Swenson R.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1259-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A remarkable feature is that the conformation of residues 56–60 near the binding site of FMN differs among native and mutant flavodoxins. Only G57T mutants possess HQ structures that contain a mixture of two conformers, i.e. the proximal CO conformer (trans O-up conformation in Ref. 3Ludwig M.L. Pattridge K.A. Metzger A.L. Dixon M.M. Eren M. Feng Y. Swenson R.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1259-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and the distal CO conformer (trans O-down conformation in Ref. 3Ludwig M.L. Pattridge K.A. Metzger A.L. Dixon M.M. Eren M. Feng Y. Swenson R.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1259-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar); these differ with respect to the orientation of the backbone carbonyl (CO) group at residue 57 toward the N5 nitrogen atom of the FMN quinone. In the proximal CO conformer (Fig. 2, left), the CO group is oriented toward the FMN quinone so that the oxygen atom of CO can accept an H-bond from the protonated N5 nitrogen atom of the FMN quinone (O57–NFMN distance = 3.0 Å). On the other hand, in the distal CO conformer (Fig. 2, right), the orientation of the CO group is almost opposite to that in the proximal CO conformer, and no H-bond can form between the CO group and the protonated N5 nitrogen atom (O57–NFMN distance = 5.7 Å). Note that HQ structures, except for those in the G57T mutant, possess only proximal CO conformers. Different conformations may be responsible for difference in the influence exerted on the energy of FMN quinones, and may vary the E1 and E2 values of flavodoxins (3Ludwig M.L. Pattridge K.A. Metzger A.L. Dixon M.M. Eren M. Feng Y. Swenson R.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1259-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), as indicated by the measured Em of the G57T mutants. These values of the G57T mutants vary considerably from those of other flavodoxins (Table 1).TABLE 1Redox potentials in mV units and pKa in [pKa] units for quinones in flavodoxinQuinoneFlavodoxinStructureNativeG57DG57TConformation in HQ structureProximalatrans O-up form with 57-58 orientation.Proximalatrans O-up form with 57-58 orientation.Proximalatrans O-up form with 57-58 orientation.Distalbtrans O-down form with 57-58 orientation.Em(FMNH·/FMNH-): E1 calc.-400-381-378-339HQ exp.-399cSee Ref. 3.-379cSee Ref. 3.-320cSee Ref. 3.Em(FMN/FMNH·): E2 calc.-129-167-184-279(see Equation 3) exp.-92cSee Ref. 3.-140cSee Ref. 3.-270cSee Ref. 3.pKa(N5) calc.[13.9][13.6][13.3][11.7]HQ exp.[>13.5]cSee Ref. 3., [>13]dSee Ref. 25.ND[11.3]cSee Ref. 3. calc.

Open table in a new tab The structural geometries of flavodoxins investigated in this study are considerably simple. Nevertheless, factors that determine the E1 and E2 values have not yet been fully clarified. Some earlier studies have not focused on the fact that E1 is the potential for one-electron reduction, whereas E2 is the potential for proton-coupled one-electron reduction. Hence, to analyze E2, it is necessary to consider both redox and protonation events. By using crystal structures and considering the protonation states of all titratable sites (including the FMN 5′-phosphate group) in the protein, here the calculated E1 and E2 values of flavodoxins obtained from C. beijerinckii are presented. To evaluate the E2 value, the energy contributed by FMN quinone protonation at the N5 nitrogen (pKa(N5)) has been taken into account. The present study clearly demonstrates that the Em and pKa values of flavodoxins are determined solely by the protein environment as in other proteins (4Ishikita H. Knapp E.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52002-52011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 5Ishikita H. Knapp E.-W. J. Biol.

Atomic Coordinates and Charges—For performing computational studies, crystal structures of the native and mutant forms of C. beijerinckii flavodoxin were used, whose information is available in the protein data bank (PDB); the native form used was 5NLL/5ULL for oxidized/hydroquinone forms and the mutant forms were G57D (4NLL/1FLA for oxidized/hydroquinone forms) and G57T (1FLD/2FVX for oxidized/hydroquinone forms at 277 K) (3Ludwig M.L. Pattridge K.A. Metzger A.L. Dixon M.M. Eren M. Feng Y. Swenson R.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1259-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The calculations to obtain the Em(FMN/FMN⋅¯ ) values of flavodoxin were performed using the OX crystal structures. Calculations for obtaining both E (FMNH·/FMNH–m) and pKa values at the N5 nitrogen for FMN⋅¯ /FMNH· (pKa(N5)) were performed using the HQ structures, if not otherwise specified (also see Fig. 1). In the original atomic coordinates of the G57T mutant possessing the HQ structures (PDB: 2FVX), there were two conformers labeled conformer A and B (the proximal CO conformer (trans O-up conformation) and the distal CO conformer (trans O-down conformation), respectively) (3Ludwig M.L. Pattridge K.A. Metzger A.L. Dixon M.M. Eren M. Feng Y. Swenson R.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1259-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, in the original atomic coordinates of conformer B there exist two backbone O atoms at residue 58 (atom numbers 450 and 451). In the present study, the O atom with atom number 450 was regarded as that of the conformer A. The PDB file with information on this conformer shows that it lacks a backbone N atom that is present at residue 60 in conformer B. In the present study, the atomic coordinate of the N atom not only for the A conformer but also for the B conformer were used. Atomic coordinates of the E59Q mutant (8Bradley L.H. Swenson R.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12377-12386Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 9Bradley L.H. Swenson R.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8686-8695Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) were modeled based on the HQ structures of the native flavodoxin. The side chain at 59 was replaced with Gln, and only the side chain was energetically optimized with CHARMM (10Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13766) Google Scholar). Resulting atomic coordinates of the Gln-59 side chain were listed in supplemental Table S1. The atomic coordinates were prepared using the same procedures as those used in previous applications (for instance, Refs. 4Ishikita H. Knapp E.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52002-52011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 5Ishikita H. Knapp E.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12446-12450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 6Ishikita H. Saenger W. Biesiadka J. Loll B. Knapp E.-W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The position of H atoms were energetically optimized with CHARMM (10Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13766) Google Scholar) by using the CHARMM22 force field. While carrying out this procedure, the positions of all non-H atoms were fixed, and the standard charge states of all the titratable groups were maintained, i.e. the basic and acidic groups were considered protonated and ionized, respectively. All the other atoms whose coordinates were available in the crystal structure were not geometrically optimized. Atomic partial charges of the amino acids were adopted from the all-atom CHARMM22 (10Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13766) Google Scholar) parameter set. Atomic charges of the 5′-phosphate group of FMN quinone (–H3PO3, −H2PO3− , and −HPO32− ) were adopted from those of the methylphosphate CHARMM22 parameter set (labeled using MP_0, MP_1, and MP_2, respectively). The charges of FMN, FMN⋅¯ , FMNH· and FMNH– were determined from the electronic wave functions by fitting the resulting electrostatic potential in the neighborhood of these molecules by using the restrained electrostatic potential procedure (11Bayly C.I. Cieplak P. Cornell W.D. Kollman P.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 10269-10280Crossref Scopus (5352) Google Scholar). In the restrained electrostatic potential procedure atomic charges can be calculated, keeping the dipole and quadrupole moment constant. The electronic wave functions were calculated with the density functional module in JAGUAR 3Jaguar 4.2 (1991–2000), Schrödinger, Inc., Portland, OR. by using the B3LYP functional with the 6–31G** basis set (supplemental Table S2). Although in some systems density functional methods may not be appropriate to calculate energies (for instance, see Ref. 13Wodrich M.D. Corminboeuf C. Schreiner P.R. Fokin A.A. Schleyer P.v.R. Org. Lett. 2007; 9: 1851-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), in the present study this method was used to obtain only atomic charges, not other properties (e.g. energies). Note that the energy value of the redox active group is related to the Em value. In particular, the highest occupied molecular orbital energy is closely related to the Em for one-electron reduction (14Watanabe T. Kobayashi M. Chlorophylls.in: Scheer H. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 287-303Google Scholar, 15Jestin I. Frere P. Mercier N. Levillain E. Stievenard D. Roncali J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 8150-8158Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 16Ishikita H. Knapp E-W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 1963-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the present study, energies obtained in the density functional calculation were not used for subsequent calculations. It is widely known that calculations of atomic charges of the molecules are not sensitive to choice of the density functional method or the Hartree-Fock method (i.e. definition of atomic charges is more arbitrary than that of energy). Indeed, the obtained atomic charges of FMN in the present study are essentially the same as those calculated with the Hartree-Fock method (17Popovic D.M. Zmiric A. Zaric S.D. Knapp E-W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 3775-3782Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Dielectric Volume—The dielectric volume of a protein complex is the spatial area and shape of molecular components of the protein and includes the polypeptide backbone, side chains, and cofactors, but not the water molecules. To facilitate a direct comparison with past computational results of other systems with the same method, the identical computational conditions and parameters such as atomic partial charges and dielectric constants were uniformly used. As a general and uniform strategy, all the crystallized water molecules were removed for our computations (4Ishikita H. Knapp E.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52002-52011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 5Ishikita H. Knapp E.-W. J. Biol.

Soc. 2007; 129: 1210-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) because of the lack of experimental information regarding the H atom positions. Cavities that formed after removal of the crystallized water molecules were uniformly filled with a dielectric solvent (ϵ = 80). Accordingly, the effect of the removed water molecules was considered implicitly and a high value of the dielectric constant was assigned to these cavities. A discussion on the appropriate value of the dielectric constant of proteins has been published (18Warshel A. Russel S.T. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1984; 17: 283-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 19Warshel A. Åqvist J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys.

Knapp E-W. Eur. Bophys. J. 1998; 27: 626-637Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Protonation Pattern, Redox Potential, and pKa—The present computation is based on the electrostatic continuum model created by solving the linear Poisson-Boltzmann equation with the MEAD program (22Bashford D. Karplus M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10219-10225Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). To facilitate a direct comparison with previous computational results, we uniformly used identical computational conditions and parameters such as atomic partial charges and dielectric constants (for instance, Refs. 4Ishikita H. Knapp E.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52002-52011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 5Ishikita H. Knapp E.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12446-12450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 6Ishikita H. Saenger W. Biesiadka J. Loll B. Knapp E.-W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To obtain absolute Em values of the protein, we calculated the electrostatic energy difference between the two redox states in a reference model system using a known experimental Em value. The difference in the Em value of the protein relative to the reference system was added to the known Em. As a reference model system, the following values for Em versus the normal hydrogen electrode were used: Em (FMNH·/FMNH–) =–172 mV at pH 7 for one-electron reduction (–172 mV = E1 or Em(SQ/HQ)) measured by Draper and Ingraham with potentiometry (2Draper R.D. Ingraham L.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 125: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 1). All the other titratable sites, including the 5′-phosphate group, were fully equilibrated to the redox state of FMN during the titration. The ensemble of the protonation patterns was sampled by a Monte Carlo method with Karlsberg. 4B. Rabenstein (1999) Karlsberg online manual, AG Knapp, Free University of Berlin. All computations were performed at 300 K, pH 7.0, and an ionic strength of 100 mm. The linear Poisson-Boltzmann equation was solved using a three-step grid-focusing procedure at the resolutions 2.5 Å, 1.0 Å, and 0.3 Å. The Monte Carlo sampling yielded the probabilities [Aox] and [Ared] of the two redox states of molecule A. The Em was evaluated using the Nernst equation. A bias potential was applied to obtain an equal amount of both redox states ([Aox] = [Ared]); thus, yielding the redox midpoint potential Em as the resulting bias potential. For convenience, the computed Em value was given with mV accuracy, without implying that the last digit was significant. In general, an Em value of ∼10 mV is a sufficiently reproducible range for the computational method used (for instance, see Refs. 4Ishikita H. Knapp E.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52002-52011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 5Ishikita H. Knapp E.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12446-12450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 6Ishikita H. Saenger W. Biesiadka J. Loll B. Knapp E.-W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

By using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, the pKa value can be calculated as the pH, where the concentrations, [A–] and [AH], are equal. FMN⋅¯ forms FMNH • upon protonation at the N5 nitrogen in FMN quinone (Fig. 1). The value of 8.6 was considered as the pKa(N5) value (2Draper R.D. Ingraham L.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 125: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) in the reference model system of FMN⋅¯ /FMNH • equilibrium in aqueous solution (see also Fig. 1). The value of 6.4 (23Kumler W.D. Eiler J.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1943; 65: 2355-2361Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar) was considered as the pKa value in the 5′-phosphate group of −H2PO3−/−HPO32− . Note that the 5′-phosphate was permanently deprotonated in the –H3PO3/−H2PO3− equilibrium (pKa = 1.4 (23Kumler W.D. Eiler J.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1943; 65: 2355-2361Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar)) in all the crystal structures that were investigated. Thus, in the present study, the −H2PO3−/−HPO32− equilibrium (pKa = 6.4 (23Kumler W.D. Eiler J.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1943; 65: 2355-2361Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar)) was investigated, if not otherwise specified. Calculation of E2:Em(FMN/FMNH·) in Flavodoxin—The reaction involving FMN yielding FMNH· that has an Em(FMN/FMNH·)) is the process in which one-electron reduction of FMN to FMN⋅¯ is coupled with protonation at the N5 nitrogen atom (Fig. 1). Therefore, one has to consider the energetics of both “one-electron redox process” and “one-proton protonation process” to accurately estimate the net energetics. The potential of proton-coupled one-electron reduction can be written as follows: Em(FMN/FMNH.)=Em(FMN/FMN.¯)+RT/F ln 10 log(1+10−pH/10−pKa(N5))(Eq. 1) where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, and F is the Faraday constant (see Ref. 24Tommos C. Skalicky J.J. Pilloud D.L. Wand A.J. Dutton P.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9495-9507Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). At pH 7, log(1+10−pH/10−pKa(N5))≈pKa(N5)−pH(Eq. 2) Thus, in the present study the following equation was used to calculate Em(FMN/FMN⋅¯), Em(FMN/FMNH.)=Em(FMN/FMN.¯)+RT/F ln 10×(pKa(N5)−7)(Eq. 3) To use Equation 3, the Em(FMN/FMN⋅¯ ) value in aqueous solution as the reference model system is needed. By maintaining Em(FMN/FMNH·) =–238 mV at pH 7 and pKa(N5) = 8.6 in aqueous solution measured by Draper and Ingraham (2Draper R.D. Ingraham L.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 125: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) (summarized in Ref. 25Ludwig M.L. Schopfer L.M. Metzger A.L. Pattridge K.A. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10364-10375Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), Em(FMN/FMN.) =–333 mV was obtained in the present study. This value was used as the reference model system of Em(FMN/FMN⋅¯) in aqueous solution. Reference Em Values in the Reference Model System—In the present study, the E1 and E2 values of –172 mV and –238 mV for free FMN measured by Draper and Ingraham with potentiometry (2Draper R.D. Ingraham L.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 125: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) were used. On the other hand, the corresponding values measured by Anderson with pulse radiolysis (26Anderson R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 722: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) were –124 mV and –314 mV, respectively. More recently, by performing plot-fitting analysis of pH dependence on E1 and E2 obtained from former studies (2Draper R.D. Ingraham L.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 125: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 26Anderson R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 722: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), Mayhew (27Mayhew S.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 698-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) observed the larger deviation of data measured by Draper and Ingraham (2Draper R.D. Ingraham L.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 125: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) from those anticipated by the Michaelis equation (28Michaelis L. Chem. Rev. 1935; 16: 243-286Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar). He concluded that the latter was more reliable. Measurements of the E1 and E2 values by Williamson and Edmondson (29Williamson G. Edmondson D.E. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7790-7797Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) also show the deviation from those anticipated by the Michaelis equation. In aqueous solution, redox reactions of quinones are often coupled with the protonation events, whereas in protein the corresponding reaction may be solely a redox process. This difference can make it difficult to obtain the appropriate Em value in the reference system (reviewed in Ref. 30Gunner M.R. Mao J-J. Song Y.-F. Kim J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 942-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the present calculations, using the HQ (for E1 and pKa(N5)) and OX (for Em(FMN/FMN⋅¯)) crystal structures, the measured E1 and E2 values of flavodoxins were reproduced only when the values of free FMN measured by Draper and Ingraham (2Draper R.D. Ingraham L.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 125: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) were used as the reference value. Even if other forms of crystal structures were used (e.g. the OX structures for the E1 calculations) along with the values measured by Anderson (26Anderson R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 722: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), the calculated values were significantly far from the measured values (supplemental Table S3). In using the value obtained by Anderson (26Anderson R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 722: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), the discrepancy between the calculated and measured values is remarkably large in the calculation of E2. From these comparisons, the values measured by Draper and Ingraham (2Draper R.D. Ingraham L.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 125: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) that can reproduce a series of the measured values were chosen as reference values. Calculated Values of E1 in Flavodoxin—By using HQ structures, the calculated E1(E (FMNH·/FMNH–m)) values were found to be –400 mV and –381 mV for the native and G57D flavodoxins, respectively (Table 1). These results were in excellent agreement with the values that were measured earlier, i.e.–399 mV and –378 mV, respectively (3Ludwig M.L. Pattridge K.A. Metzger A.L. Dixon M.M. Eren M. Feng Y. Swenson R.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1259-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) (Table 1). Only G57T mutants possess HQ structures that comprise a mixture of two conformers, namely, the proximal CO conformer and the distal CO conformer (Fig. 2). For the G57T mutants, the calculated E1 values were –378 mV and –339 mV in the proximal and distal CO conformers, respectively (Table 1). The latter value is considerably closer to the value of–320 mV obtained in an earlier measurement (3Ludwig M.L. Pattridge K.A. Metzger A.L. Dixon M.M. Eren M. Feng Y. Swenson R.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1259-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), implying that the distal CO conformer is more relevant with regard to experimental measurement of E1 values of G57T mutants. It has been suggested that the existence of the distal CO conformer in G57T mutants may not be caused by the contamination of incompletely reduced quinones and that it is probably a relevant conformer in G57T mutants (3Ludwig M.L. Pattridge K.A. Metzger A.L. Dixon M.M. Eren M. Feng Y. Swenson R.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1259-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To explain the notable difference in the E1 values between G57T mutants and others (Table 1), the present result strongly suggests that G57T mutants must be in the distal CO conformer. It is likely that the distal CO conformer is a more relevant structure to G57T mutants and that the difference in the Em values between the two conformers is mainly attributable to the geometry of residue 57, i.e. at the CO orientation. Influence of Protonation States of the FMN Phosphate Group on E1 Values—Protonation states of titratable residues often play an important role in determining the Em values of the protein, because the difference in protonation states of residues result in different net charges of proteins. In this study, the calculated protonation states of the 5′-phosphate group of FMN quinone were essentially found to be identical in all the flavodoxins when E1 values were determined (i.e. at pH 7).

https://openalex.org/W2029307764,"The mechanisms of signal transduction from cell surface receptors to the interior of the cell are fundamental to the understanding of the role that positive and negative growth factors play in cell physiology and in human diseases. Here, we show that a functional link between phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) and Ras is suppressed by the beta-galactoside binding protein (betaGBP) molecule, a cytokine and a negative cell-cycle regulator. Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling is blocked by betaGBP owing to its ability to inhibit the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K, whose basal activity is required for Ras activation. Functional inhibition of p110 by betaGBP results in downregulation of PI3K activity, suppression of Ras-GTP loading, consequent loss of MAPK activation and block of cell proliferation. This study sheds light on the molecular mechanisms whereby betaGBP can control cell proliferation and, by extension, may potentially control tumorigenesis by controlling PI3K."

Translation of the tricistronic reovirus S1 mRNA, therefore, is dependent both on leaky scanning and on a novel scanning-independent mechanism that allows translation initiation complexes to efficiently bypass two functional upstream ORFs. The scanning model of translation initiation accounts for the vast majority of translation events occurring in eukaryotic cells (1Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 299: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Recruitment of the 40 S ribosomal subunit is facilitated by the presence of a 5′-terminal m7Gppp cap and canonical eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) 4The abbreviations used areeIFeukaryotic initiation factorUTR5′-untranslated regionORFopen reading frameuORFupstream ORFIRESinternal ribosome entry siteARVavian reovirusNBVNelson Bay reovirusEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinRTreverse transcriptionqRTquantitative RT. involved in cap binding and creation of the 43 S and 48 S preinitiation complexes. Translation initiation generally occurs at the 5′-proximal AUG start codon after scanning of the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) by the preinitiation complex and recruitment of the 60 S subunit. Alternate sites of translation initiation, however, almost certainly contribute to the complexity of both viral and cellular proteomes. For example, the sequence context flanking an AUG start codon contributes to the efficiency of translation initiation, with the optimal context being GCCRCCAUGG; the purine in position -3 confers the greatest enhancement on initiation followed by the G at position +4, particularly in the absence of A at position -3 (2Kozak M.

In addition to leaky scanning, three additional mechanisms of alternate translation initiation have been described (3Jackson R.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 1231-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). After translation of a short upstream ORF (uORF), 40 S subunits may resume scanning and reinitiate translation at a downstream ORF (4Mueller P.P. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1986; 45: 201-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Reinitiation is generally inefficient and is favored by translation of a short uORF (∼2–50 codons), which may prevent the time-dependent dissociation of essential initiation factors, and by an intercistronic distance of >70 nucleotides that may allow sufficient time for scanning 40 S subunits to reacquire the eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAi cofactor required for translation initiation (5Kozak M. Nucleic. Acids Res. 2001; 29: 5226-5232Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 6Meijer H.A. Thomas A.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements are complex secondary structures that facilitate direct recruitment of the preinitiation complex bypassing cap-dependent scanning to access internal AUG start codons (7Hellen C.U. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). The third mechanism, ribosomal shunting, is extremely rare and involves the non-linear 5′-3′ transfer of scanning ribosomes, bypassing the intervening region to access an internal start codon (8Ryabova L.A. Pooggin M.M. Hohn T. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 72: 1-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Shunting has only been described for a few viral, and possibly cellular, mRNAs (9Futterer J.

Hull R. Hohn T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2999-3010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The S1 mRNAs transcribed by the fusogenic avian (ARV) and Nelson Bay (NBV) reoviruses encode three unrelated proteins from sequential, partially overlapping ORFs (Fig. 1A) (13Bodelon G. Labrada L. Martinez-Costas J. Benavente J. Virology. 2001; 290: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 14Shmulevitz M. Yameen Z. Dawe S. Shou J. O'Hara D. Holmes I. Duncan R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The tricistronic gene arrangement of the ARV and NBV S1 mRNAs has few parallels in the eukaryotic world, and the mechanism(s) that regulates translation of these remarkable S1 mRNAs remains largely unexplored. The 5′-proximal ORFs of the ARV and NBV S1 mRNAs, which are initiated by AUG codons in a suboptimal context (Fig. 1B), encode the p10 fusion-associated small transmembrane proteins responsible for the syncytium-inducing phenotype of these fusogenic reoviruses (15Shmulevitz M. Duncan R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 902-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The p17 protein encoded by the second ORF is a nonstructural nucleocytoplasmic protein of no known function (16Costas C. Martinez-Costas J. Bodelon G. Benavente J. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 2141-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). With an A residue at position -3, the most conserved and functionally most important flanking residue, the ARV p17 start codon is in a strong context for translation initiation. The 3′-proximal ORF encodes the σC protein, a soluble cytoplasmic protein structurally and functionally related to the non-fusogenic mammalian reovirus σ1 cell adhesion protein (17Grande A. Rodriguez E. Costas C. Everitt E. Benavente J. Virology. 2000; 274: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 18Guardado Calvo P. Fox G.C. Hermo Parrado X.L. Llamas-Saiz A.L. Costas C. Martinez-Costas J. Benavente J. van Raaij M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 137-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The start codon of the σC ORF exists in a preferred context, but it occurs 630 nucleotides downstream of the 5′-terminal cap structure (Fig. 1). This long leader sequence contains four AUG codons, at least two of which are functional start codons for the p10 and p17 ORFs and at least one of which exists in a strong context for an initiator methionine (Fig. 1B). How ribosomes access the σC start site is unknown. Based on the arrangement of ORFs and the absence of any methionine codons in the intergenic region between the p10 and σC ORFs, translation reinitiation was posited as a possible mechanism for σC expression (1Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 299: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). According to this scenario, the p10 ORF would provide access to the σC start codon by “escorting” some ribosomes past the strong p17 start site. After translation termination of the p10 ORF, 40 S subunits would remain attached to the mRNA and resume scanning to reinitiate translation at the downstream σC start site. Two additional features of σC expression, however, appear contradictory to a translation reinitiation mechanism. First, the 98-codon p10 ORF is considerably larger than what would be expected for an uORF that directs translation reinitiation (6Meijer H.A. Thomas A.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Second, optimizing the context of the p10 start site results in enhanced translation of the p10 ORF with no apparent qualitative increase in σC expression (14Shmulevitz M. Yameen Z. Dawe S. Shou J. O'Hara D. Holmes I. Duncan R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In view of these considerations, two alternative mechanisms for translation initiation at the internal σC start codon have been posited, IRES-mediated translation or ribosomal shunting (14Shmulevitz M. Yameen Z. Dawe S. Shou J. O'Hara D. Holmes I. Duncan R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 19Benavente J. Martinez-Costas J. Virus Res. 2007; 123: 105-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, the extremely short 5′-UTR present in the S1 mRNAs (i.e. 24–26 nucleotides) is inconsistent with existing models of IRES- or shunting-mediated translation initiation. The absence of any detailed expression analyses of the tricistronic ARV or NBV S1 mRNAs precludes any meaningful speculation on which alternative translation initiation mechanisms might be operative. To address this issue, we undertook a rigorous quantitative analysis of ARV S1 mRNA translation. We now provide direct evidence that translation of the p10 and p17 ORFs is coordinately regulated by context-dependent leaky scanning. Contrary to expectations, however, the two most common mechanisms for translation initiation at internal start codons, translation reinitiation or IRES elements, do not contribute to σC translation. Further analyses revealed that a novel eIF4G-dependent, scanning-independent mechanism provides efficient ribosome access to the internal σC start codon in a manner that is relatively unaffected by translation initiation events occurring at either of the two functional upstream ORFs. Cells and Antibodies—The quail fibroblast cell line, QM5, was maintained as previously described (20Duncan R. Sullivan K. Virology. 1998; 250: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and used for all transfection studies. Rabbit antisera that recognize σC, p10, or p17 were previously described (14Shmulevitz M. Yameen Z. Dawe S. Shou J. O'Hara D. Holmes I. Duncan R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Rabbit antisera specific for the full-length ARV p10 protein or the endodomain of the ARV p10 protein were prepared as previously reported (15Shmulevitz M. Duncan R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 902-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Additional rabbit antisera included sera specific for actin (Sigma) enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (Clontech) or human eIF4G (a gift from N. Sonenberg, McGill University). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) or anti-mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch) immunoglobulin was used as a secondary for Western blots. Plasmids—Plasmids pARV-S1 and pNBV-S1, containing the full-length cDNAs of the S1 genome segments of ARV or NBV cloned into the HindIII-NotI sites of pcDNA3, were previously described (15Shmulevitz M. Duncan R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 902-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The pARV-S1 expression plasmid was point-substituted using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, as per the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene) to optimize the context (CCACCAUGG) of the p10 or p17 start codons (plasmids p10opt and p17opt), to insert stop codons in the p10 ORF (plasmids p10stp84 and p10stp243), or to delete all four start codons that occur upstream of the σC start site (plasmid pARV-S1mono). Specific primers were used to generate 5′-terminal truncations of pARV-S1 (plasmids pARV-S1d79, -d147, and -d303). The poliovirus 2A protease gene was subcloned from pPV802 (provided by A. Kaminski, Cambridge University) into pcDNA3 using restriction sites HindIII and EcoRI to generate pPV2A. The full-length ARV and NBV S1 cDNAs from the pARV-S1 and pNBV-S1 vectors were subcloned downstream of the EGFP ORF in plasmid pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) using the NotI restriction site. The poliovirus type 2 Lansing strain IRES was inserted between the full-length S1 mRNA and the EGFP ORF in the pEGFP-N1 backbone. All expression constructs were confirmed by sequencing. In Vitro Transcription and Translation—Capped transcripts were synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase and NotI-linearized pARV-S1, p10opt, or p17opt plasmids as templates, as previously described (14Shmulevitz M. Yameen Z. Dawe S. Shou J. O'Hara D. Holmes I. Duncan R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The quality of the mRNA was assessed using denaturing agarose gels and ethidium bromide staining. The mRNA (250 ng) was translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega) in the presence of 1 μCi/50-μl reaction of [3H]leucine, as specified by the manufacturer. Immunoprecipitation Analysis—QM5 cells transfected with the various expression plasmids were pulse-labeled with 50 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine or [3H]leucine for 30–60 min at 24–36 h post-transfection, and radiolabeled p10 or σC was detected by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE as previously described (15Shmulevitz M. Duncan R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 902-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Expression levels were determined by quantifying the pixels present in specific polypeptide bands as described below. Control titration experiments determined that antibody levels were saturating in the immunoprecipitations, and different exposures of the fluorograms were used to ensure a linear exposure range. Co-transfection with the Poliovirus 2A Protease—QM5 cells were co-transfected with pPV2A and the indicated expression plasmids using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and equal concentrations of each plasmid DNA. Cells were fixed and immunostained with the antiserum recognizing σC to reveal the presence of antigen-positive syncytial foci, as previously described (15Shmulevitz M. Duncan R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 902-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Fluorescent images of live cells transfected with pEGFP were captured at 200× magnification. Alternatively, lysates of co-transfected cells were used for quantitative Western blotting as described below. Northern Blotting—Total RNA was extracted from transfected cells using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Total RNA (8 μg) was fractionated on formaldehyde gels and stained with ethidium bromide to reveal the 28 S and 18 S ribosomal RNA markers. The gels were blotted onto Hybond membranes (Amersham Biosciences) and probed with [32P]GTP-labeled S1-specific probes generated using random hexamers and the gel-purified, full-length S1 genome segment cDNAs as templates. Bound probe was detected by autoradiography with intensifying screens. Quantitative Western Blotting—Cell lysates in decreasing 1-μg increments (i.e. 6, 5, 4, or 3 μg of cell lysate) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (15% polyacrylamide) and transferred to Hybond membranes (Amersham Biosciences) using a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot Cell (1 h, 100 V), and the membrane was blocked in TBST (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% skim milk for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was incubated for 1 h in blocking solution containing the appropriate dilution of primary antibody, washed extensively with TBST, incubated for an additional hour in blocking buffer containing a 1:10,000 dilution of the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, washed extensively with TBST, and developed using ECL+ (Amersham Biosciences). Protein bands were quantified using a Typhoon 9410 Variable Mode Imager and ImageQuant TL software (v.2003.02, Amersham Biosciences). Regression analysis of pixel densities versus protein concentration was used to obtain the linear exposure range, exposures were normalized to the actin control, and the σC and p10 expression levels from the altered S1 mRNAs were determined relative to the expression from the authentic S1 mRNA. The mean ± S.E. from a minimum of three independent experiments were used to determine the percent change in expression levels and assessed for statistical significance using a two-tailed paired t test. qRT-PCR—Total cellular RNA was obtained from transfected QM5 cells using Trizol (Invitrogen) and the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). cDNA produced through reverse transcription from 0.25 and 0.5 μg of the purified RNA was then subjected to real time PCR utilizing the SuperScript III Platinum Two-Step qRT-PCR kit with SYBR Green (Invitrogen), a MX3000p Thermocycler (Stratagene), and an amplification protocol consisting of a 10-min hot start at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 65 °C for 1 min, and elongation at 72 °C for 30 s. Melting curves as well as separation of PCR products on a 1% Tris acetate-EDTA agarose gel were used to ensure the formation of a single product of the appropriate size. Relative gene expression normalized to β-actin expression was calculated using the ΔΔCT method (21Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124899) Google Scholar). Efficient σC Translation Initiation Occurs from a Full-length Tricistronic S1 Transcript—Cryptic splice sites or promoters or mRNA cleavage upstream of an internal start codon can potentially confound translation analysis of polycistronic mRNAs (7Hellen C.U. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 22Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). To exclude such trivial explanations for σC translation initiation, S1-specific transcripts generated in cells transfected with either the pARV-S1 or pNBV-S1 expression constructs were detected by Northern blotting. In both cases only a single species of S1-specific mRNA was detected, and these transcripts migrated slightly ahead of the ∼1850-nucleotide 18 S rRNA species, as expected for the full-length S1 transcript (Fig. 2A). Therefore, σC translation derives from a full-length, tricistronic S1 mRNA, not from a truncated mRNA containing the σC start site as the 5′-proximal AUG codon. In general, uORFs exert a strong negative effect on translation initiation at downstream ORFs (1Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 299: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 6Meijer H.A. Thomas A.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 23Merrick W.C. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 332: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). To obtain an estimate of how efficiently ribosomes access the internal σC start site, the four AUG codons that occur upstream of the σC ORF were removed by site-directed mutagenesis to generate pARV-S1mono. The transcript encoded by this plasmid is monocistronic, with the σC start site representing the 5′-proximal start codon. Quantitative analysis from two independent experiments indicated a 1.7- and 2.9-fold increase in σC expression levels from this monocistronic mRNA relative to σC translation from the polycistronic S1 mRNA (Fig. 2B). This difference, however, was not statistically significant, suggesting the uORFs exert little to no effect on ribosome access to the σC start site. By comparison, removal of the uORFs present in the yeast GCN4 or mouse ATF4 mRNAs, two examples of mRNAs where translation is regulated by reinitiation, stimulates translation of the major downstream ORFs by 74–500-fold (4Mueller P.P. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1986; 45: 201-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 24Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar). The Northern blotting and monocistronic S1 mRNA results suggested that the mechanism responsible for σC translation initiation functions almost as efficiently as linear scanning and in a manner that is relatively unaffected by the presence of the uORFs to provide ribosome access to the internal σC start codon present on a full-length, tricistronic mRNA. Coordinated Expression of the p10 and p17 ORFs by Leaky Scanning—To further explore any interrelationship between translation initiation events occurring at the uORFs and the σC ORF, the suboptimal p10 and p17 start codons (p10, CGUCGAUGC; p17, GCACAAUGC) were individually converted to an optimal context (CCACCAUGG) to generate the expression constructs p10opt and p17opt. Reticulocyte lysates were primed with the capped, in vitro transcribed mRNAs derived from the parental pARV-S1 construct or the optimized constructs, and the [3H]leucine-labeled translation products were detected by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Qualitative analysis of the total translation mixtures and of immunoprecipitated lysates revealed σC translation from all three mRNAs (Fig. 3). Radiolabeled, low molecular mass (<17 kDa) translation products were also present in the total translation mixtures (Fig. 3, lanes 1–3), which were poorly resolved due to comigration with the large quantities of hemin present in the reticulocyte lysates. However, immunoprecipitation using polyclonal, monospecific antisera clearly revealed expression of both p10 and p17 (Fig. 3, lanes 4–9). Qualitatively, the authentic and p17opt mRNAs produced limited amounts of p10 (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 6), consistent with the inefficient natural translation start site of the p10 ORF in these constructs, and the p17 polypeptide was expressed at a moderate level from the authentic mRNA with the p17 start codon in a strong, though not optimal, sequence context (Fig. 3, lane 7). Optimizing the context of the p10 (Fig. 3, lanes 4 versus 5) or p17 (Fig. 3, lanes 7 versus 9) start sites resulted in an obvious increase in translation of these ORFs. Most notably, increased p10 expression from the p10opt mRNA led to the concurrent dramatic reduction of p17 translation (Fig. 3, lanes 7 versus 8). This observation was consistent with numerous previous studies indicating that ribosomes rarely scan past an optimized translation start site without initiating translation (1Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 299: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar), providing the first direct evidence for coordinated expression of the p10 and p17 ORFs by leaky scanning initiation. In marked contrast, an increased number of scanning 40 S subunits initiating translation at either the optimized p10 or p17 start codons had little apparent inhibitory effects on σC translation (Fig. 3, lanes 10–12). Translation of the σC ORF Is Independent of Leaky Scanning—Because in vitro translation systems may allow aberrant internal translation initiation (25Land T. Rouault T.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 807-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 26Meulewaeter F. Cornelissen M. Van Emmelo J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6419-6428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), rigorous quantitative analysis of the influence of the upstream ORFs on translation initiation at the internal σC start site was conducted in transfected cells expressing the various S1 mRNA constructs.

Virol. 2002; 76: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) rendered quantitative analysis of p17 expression problematic; therefore, only p10 and σC expression were further examined. Cell lysates from cells transfected with the pARV-S1, p10opt, and p17opt expression plasmids were fractionated by SDS-PAGE using dilutions of the lysates (i.e. sequential 1-μg decreases in the protein load) to obtain a linear detection range by Western blotting, and expression levels were quantified and normalized to actin controls using phosphorimaging (Fig. 4A). The relative mRNA levels were also quantified by qRT-PCR using the ΔΔCT method (21Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124899) Google Scholar). In no instance did variations in protein expression of the various S1 transcripts reflect significant differences in transcript levels (data not shown). Quantitative analysis indicated that p10 expression was increased an average of 6.1 ± 0.8-fold (n = 7) in p10opt-transfected cells relative to cells transfected with either the pARV-S1 or p17opt plasmids (Fig. 4B). This substantial increase in p10 expression was not reflected in a corresponding decrease in σC expression, which was reduced by 2-fold (i.e. σC expression from the p10opt mRNA was retained at 52 ± 6% of the levels obtained from pARV-S1). Optimizing the p17 start site had even less of an effect on σC expression, which was reduced by only 19 ± 9% compared with σC expression from the pARV-S1 construct, a difference that was not statistically significant (Fig. 4B). The quantitative analyses of protein steady-state levels by Western blotting were confirmed by pulse-labeling and radioimmunoprecipitation. Extended exposure of the fluorograms detected low levels of p10 translation from the authentic p10 start codon in cells transfected with either the pARV-S1 or p17opt S1 expression plasmids (Fig. 4C). As with the Western blotting results, an optimized p17 start site had no statistically significant effect on σC translation, which was retained at 89 ± 3% (n = 5) that observed from the pARV-S1 mRNA. Similarly, optimizing the context of the p10 start site resulted in a dramatic increase in p10 translation with only a marginal decrease in σC translation (i.e. reduced by 22 ± 4% of the levels obtained from the authentic S1 mRNA construct) (Fig. 4C). Therefore, results obtained both by optimizing the context of upstream start sites (Figs. 3 and 4) and by removal of these start codons (Fig. 2B) indicated that the mechanism responsible for σC translation provides ribosome access to the internal σC site in a reasonably efficient manner and relatively independent of the uORFs present in the full-length, tricistronic mRNA. We infer that few if any pre-initiation complexes access the σC translation start site via leaky scanning. Translation of σC Is IRES-independent—The ARV and NBV S1 mRNAs were screened for the presence of an IRES element using the classical “bicistronic” approach (27Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1988; 334: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar). As a positive control for detection of IRES activity, a bicistronic vector was created in which the EGFP reporter gene under the control of the poliovirus IRES element was cloned downstream of the ARV S1 gene. A low level of EGFP expression suggestive of IRES-mediated internal translation initiation was detectible from this construct (Fig. 5A). Co-expression of the poliovirus 2A protease enhanced translation of the downstream EGFP ORF by 4-fold, consistent with the ability of the 2A protease to selectively induce cleavage of the eIF4G component of the eIF4F cap binding initiation complex, thereby decreasing cap-dependent translation while increasing cap-independent IRES-mediated translation initiation (28Barco A. Feduchi E. Carrasco L. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2383-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 29Lloyd R.E. Virus Res. 2006; 119: 76-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The ability of the 2A protease to inhibit cap-dependent translation was evident by the decreased expression of the 5′-proximal p10 ORF in the S1 cistron present in this bicistronic construct (Fig. 5A), and cleavage of eIF4G was confirmed by Western blotting (see Fig. 6C).FIGURE 6Expression of σC is eIF4G-dependent.

https://openalex.org/W2118287545,"Satellite cells are the main source of myogenic progenitors in postnatal skeletal muscle, but their use in cell therapy for muscle disorders is limited because these cells cannot be delivered through circulation and they are rapidly exhausted in severe myopathies. The search for alternative donor cells is ongoing, but none of the candidates so far show all the features required for successful colonization and repair of diseased muscle. In this study, we show that bisperoxovanadium, a phospho-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, induces myogenic cells to acquire a gene expression profile and a differentiation potential consistent with the phenotype of a circulating precursors, while maintaining their myogenic potential. These effects are mediated, at least in part, by NF-kappaB activation through the Tyr42-IkappaB-alpha phosphorylation, as shown by the expression of the dominant negative mutant form of the p50 NF-kappaB subunit. Moreover, when bisperoxovanadium-treated cells are injected into the femoral artery of alpha-sarcoglican null dystrophic mice, they are able to circulate and to reach muscle tissue; importantly, they contribute to muscle regeneration, as shown by the expression of alpha-sarcoglican in some fibers. Our observations indicate that bisperoxovanadium, or similar compounds, may prove very valuable to obtain and to expand, from committed cells, multipotent cell populations suitable for gene-cell therapy applications and may help to understand the molecular basis of genome reprogramming and ""stem-ness."""

This property correlates with the presence of an aromatic amino acid residue in the acceptor-binding domain of the enzymes (22Dupuy F. Germot A. Julien R. Maftah A. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition, more subtle differences in acceptor specificity exist. FucT-VII is specific for sialylated acceptors (23Natsuka S. Gersten K.M. Zenita K. Kannagi R. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16789-16794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, FucT-IX has specificity for neutral acceptors (24Kaneko M. Kudo T. Iwasaki H. Ikehara Y. Nishihara S. Nakagawa S. Sasaki K. Shiina T. Inoko H. Saitou N. Narimatsu H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and FucT-IV has a preference for neutral acceptors, but will also catalyze fucose transfer to sialylated acceptors (25Holmes E.H. Macher B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Acceptor specificity differences have also been observed between FucT-V and FucT-VI. FucT-V preferentially transfers fucose to internal GlcNAc residues of polylactosamine structures compared with distal GlcNAc residues (26Pykari M. Toivonen S. Natunen J. Niemela R. Salminen H. Aitio O. Ekstrom M. Parmanne P. Valimaki M. Alais J. Auge C. Lowe J.B. Renkonen O. Renkonen R. J. Biol.

Smith P.L. Kelly R.J. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24575-24584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, FucT-VI preferentially transfers fucose to distal GlcNAc residues of neutral and sialylated polylactosamine structures, leading to the Lex and sialyl-Lex determinant structures, including V3FucVI3NeuAc-nLc6 (14Weston B.W. Smith P.L. Kelly R.J. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24575-24584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sherwood A.L. Holmes E.H.

Thus, some of the human FucTs preferentially transfer fucose to an internal GlcNAc residue, producing the VIM2 antigen, whereas others transfer fucose to the GlcNAc residue near the nonreducing end (distal) of the acceptor oligosaccharide, producing Lex or sialyl-Lex (see Fig. 1). We refer to this transferase specificity as “site-specific fucosylation.” We have conducted a series of structure-function studies utilizing domain swaps and site-directed mutants of FucT-V and FucT-VI to identify the amino acids responsible for site-specific fucosylation of internal versus distal GlcNAc residues of VI3NeuAc-nLc6Cer. The results demonstrate that site-specific fucosylation is controlled by a 40-amino acid segment near the N terminus of the catalytic domain where 8 amino acid differences are located between FucT-V and FucT-VI. Amino acids at both ends of this segment are involved in defining the site-specific fucosylation properties of each enzyme. Substitution of as few as 2 of the 8 amino acids from one FucT into the sequence of the other is sufficient to alter its site-specific fucosylation properties. Our results also demonstrate that inherent differences in enzyme activity between FucT-V and FucT-VI correlate with a single amino acid change near the C terminus of the 40-amino acid segment. COS-7 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). VI3NeuAc-neolactohexosylceramide (VI3NeuAc-nLc6Cer) was isolated from bovine erythrocytes as described previously (29Chien J.L. Li S.C. Laine R.A. Li Y.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4031-4035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). nLc6Cer was prepared from VI3NeuAc-nLc6Cer by desialylation with 1% acetic acid and boiling for 1 h. nLc6Cer was obtained after dialysis with water in Spectrapor 3 dialysis tubing. The detergent G-3634-A was obtained from Dr. S. Basu (University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN). Galβ1-4GlcNAc-8-methoxycarbonyloctyl glycoside was obtained from Dr. Ole Hindsgaul (Carlsberg Laboratory). GDP-[14C]fucose and GDP-[3H]fucose were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Operon Technologies (Alameda, CA). The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Full-length wild-type FucT-V in pcDNA3.0 and full-length wild-type FucT-VI in pcDNA3.1 were the starting materials for construction of all domain swap mutants (Table 1) and point mutants (Table 2). To create swap set 1, existing BamHI sites (two in FucT-V, one in FucT-VI, and one in the pcDNA vectors) had to be removed and one created in the desired location in both FucT-V and FucT-VI. A naturally occurring restriction site in both FucTs, MseI, was utilized to create swap set 2. Because there are also many MseI sites in the pcDNA vector, a slight alteration in strategy was required. Full-length DNAs for both FucTs were isolated from the pcDNA plasmids by digestion with EcoRI and XbaI. Both FucT DNAs were then digested with MseI. This was followed by gel purification and a three-fragment ligation consisting of the 5′-end of one FucT, the 3′-end of the other FucT, and the pcDNA vector. Swap set 3 was created by utilizing the BsrGI sites that naturally occur in both FucTs. The FucT plasmids were digested with BsrGI and XbaI, a site in both pcDNA vectors downstream of the FucT coding sequences. The four resulting fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified with a QIAEX gel extraction kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). The fragment containing the 5′-end of FucT-V was ligated to the fragment containing the 3′-end of FucT-VI, and the fragment containing the 5′-end of FucT-VI was ligated to the fragment containing the 3′-end of FucT-V. Swap set 4 required that the naturally occurring EcoNI site at nucleotide 138 in the FucT-V DNA be mutated so that an EcoNI site farther downstream (nucleotide 728) could be used to generate a swap in the same manner as described above. Another pair of chimeric proteins, swap set 5, were constructed by digesting swap set 2 DNA with BsrGI and XbaI and swapping the resulting 3′-fragments. Mutants in which 3 amino acids were exchanged between the two FucTs (T87K/V89I/A101T of FucT-V and K73T/I75V/T87A of FucT-VI) were created by inserting SacII restriction sites into the coding regions of FucT-V and FucT-VI. Creation of the SacII site required primers containing two altered nucleotides (Table 2). The resulting DNA was digested with SacII and XbaI. After purification, the fragments were ligated as described above for swap set 3. All restriction site modifications were generated as silent mutations (i.e. amino acid sequences were unaffected).TABLE 1Domain swap constructs used in this studyDomain swap setSegments of FucT-V and FucT-VI linked in domain swap constructsRestriction sites used1aV62/VI48BamHI1bVI47/V63BamHI2aV85/VI72MseI2bVI71/V86MseI3aV128/VI115BsrGI3bVI71/V86BsrGI4aV240/VI227EcoNI4bVI226/V241EcoNI5aV85/VI72-VI114/V129MseI/BsrGI5bVI71/V86-V128/VI115MseI/BsrGI Open table in a new tab TABLE 2PCR primers and templates for FucT mutationsConstructPrimerTemplateI126V FucT-VCACCACTGGGATGTCATGTACAACCCCWT FucT-VV112I FucT-VICACCACCGAGAGATCATGTACAACCCCWT FucT-VIT87K FucT-VTGGCCTTTTAACAAACCCGTGGCTCTGWT FucT-VK73T FucT-VITGGCCTTTTAACACACCCATAGCTCTGWT FucT-VID125E FucT-VGCACCACTGGGAGATCATGTACAACWT FucT-VE111D FucT-VIGCACCACCGAGATGTCATGTACAACWT FucT-VITKDE FucT-VTGGCCTTTTAACAAACCCGTGGCTCTGD125E FucT-VKTED FucT-VITGGCCTTTTAACACACCCATAGCTCTGE111D FucT-VIS110R FucT-VATCACTGCCGACCGCAGTGTGTACCCACWT FucT-VR96S FucT-VIATCACTGCCGACTCCAAGGTGTATCCACWT FucT-VIS111K FucT-VACTGCCGACTCCAAGGTGTACCCACAGWT FucT-VK97S FucT-VIACTGCCGACCGCAGTGTGTATCCACAGWT FucT-VIRK FucT-VATCACTGCCGACCGCAAGGTGTACCCACS111K FucT-VSS FucT-VIATCACTGCCGACTCCAGTGTGTATCCACK97S FucT-VIW124R FucT-VATCGTGCACCACAGGGATATCATGTACWT FucT-VR110W FucT-VIATCGTGCACCACTGGGAGGTCATGTACWT FucT-VITKWR FucT-VTGGCCTTTTAACAAACCCGTGGCTCTGW124R FucT-VKTRW FucT-VITGGCCTTTTAACACACCCATAGCTCTGR110W FucT-VIREV FucT-VGTGCACCACAGGGAGGTCATGTACAACCCCW124R FucT-VWDI FucT-VIATCGTGCACCACTGGGACATCATGTACAACCCCR110W FucT-VIKREV FucT-VTGGCCTTTTAACAAACCCGTGGCTCTGREV FucT-VTWDI FucT-VITGGCCTTTTAACACACCCATAGCTCTGWDI FucT-VIKIT SacII FucT-VGACTGCAACATCACCGCGGACTCCAGTGTGWT FucT-VTVA SacII FucT-VIGACTGCAACATCACCGCGGACCGCAAGGTGWT FucT-VIEcoNI koGCCACTGGATCCCCGAGGCCAGGGCTTAWT FucT-V5BamHI ko1ATTCATGGACCCCCTGGGCWT FucT-V5BamHI ko2CACTGGATCTCCTAGGCCABamHI ko16BamHI ko3ACCCATGGACCCCCTGGGCWT FucT-VI5BamHI ko4ACCGAGCTCTGATCCACTAG5BamHI ko26BamHI ko5ACCGAGCTCTGATCCACTAG6BamHI ko3BamHI swap5CGGGGCTCCCAATGGATCCCGCTGCCAGG5BamHI ko4BamHI swap6TGTGTACCCTAATGGATCCCGCTTCCCAG6BamHI ko5 Open table in a new tab A series of point mutations were also generated using the primers and templates listed in Table 2. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was used to generate all mutations. Mutants were propagated in the Escherichia coli TOP10 strain. The nucleotide sequences of all constructs were confirmed by sequencing both strands of the coding region (Microchemical Core Facility at San Diego State University). Wild-type and mutant constructs were transfected into COS-7 cells using Lipofectamine 2000. Thirty μg of plasmid DNA was used per 10-cm dish. Four days post-transfection, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into microcentrifuge tubes. After two washes with 50 mm cacodylate (pH 6.7), cells were lysed with 0.2% Triton X-100 in 50 mm cacodylate (pH 6.7). The FucT activity present in the cell lysate was analyzed directly, or the lysate was stored at −80 °C for up to 4 weeks prior to assay. (Control experiments demonstrated that FucT activity was stable under these conditions for up to 2 months.) The Bradford assay was used to estimate the protein concentration of the lysate. Galβ1-3GlcNAc (Type 1), (LacNAc)Galβ1-4GlcNAc (Type 2), Fucα1-2Galβ1-3GlcNAc (H-type 1), and H-type 2 (Fucα1-2Galβ1-4GlcNAc) 8-Methoxycarbonyloctyl Glycoside Acceptors—Reaction mixtures contained 1 μmol of MOPS/NaOH buffer (pH 6.5), 0.125 μmol of MnCl2, 10 μg of bovine serum albumin, 3.0 nmol of GDP-fucose, 0.01 μCi of GDP-[3H]fucose, 20 nmol of 8-methoxycarbonyloctyl glycoside acceptor (type 1, type 2, H-type 1, and H-type 2; see Table 1 for structures), and 5 μlof enzyme fraction in a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C. Each enzyme preparation was assayed at four time points ranging from 30 min to 6 h. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 400 μl of water, and the reaction products were separated from substrate by reverse-phase chromatography (Sep-Pak C18) and quantified as described previously (30Xu Z. Vo L. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8818-8823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Glycolipid Acceptors—Reaction mixtures contained 2.5 μmol of HEPES (pH 7.2), 30 μg of either VI3NeuAc-nLc6Cer or nLc6Cer as the glycolipid acceptor, 100 μg of G-3634-A detergent, 1 μmol of MnCl2, 15 nmol of GDP-[14C]fucose (30,000 cpm/nmol), and 200–500 μg of protein from 0.2% Triton X-100-solubilized membrane fractions of transfected COS-7 cells in a total reaction volume of 0.1 ml. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 2–8 h at room temperature and stopped by the addition of 100 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1). The entire reaction mixture was streaked onto a 4-cm wide strip of Whatman No. 3 paper and chromatographed overnight with water. The glycolipid remaining at the origin of the dried chromatography paper was extracted twice with 5-ml washes of CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:5:1) with incubation at 37 °C for 30 min in the solvent. The solvent was removed with a nitrogen stream. To analyze the products formed from reaction mixtures containing VI3NeuAc-nLc6Cer as the acceptor, the isolated product was desialylated by boiling in 1 ml of 1% acetic acid for 1 h. Five ml of absolute EtOH was added to the cooled tubes, and the mixture was dried with a nitrogen stream. The desialylated product was transferred to a 0.5-ml Eppendorf tube, dried, and dissolved in 20 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1). For reaction mixtures utilizing nLc6Cer as the acceptor, the desialylation step was omitted. A 5-μl aliquot from the processed reaction mixture was removed, spotted onto a high-performance TLC plate (Silica Gel 60; EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ), and developed in a solvent system consisting of n-propyl alcohol/water/concentrated NH4OH (7:3:1). After development, the plate was dried, and radiolabeled products were identified either by exposure of the plate to x-ray film or via a PhosphorImager. The amount of radioactivity present in each band was determined either by scraping and counting in a liquid scintillation counter or via PhosphorImager signal intensity using ImageQuant TL software for quantification. Twenty-four to 48 h after transfection, CHO cell monolayers were washed twice with calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen) and then incubated with cell dissociation buffer (enzyme-free, phosphate-buffered saline-based; Invitrogen) for 5 min at 37 °C. The cells in suspension were washed once with fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) staining buffer (calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 0.01% sodium azide (Sigma), and 1 mm EDTA (Sigma)) and resuspended in the same buffer at a final concentration of 107/ml. Twenty-five-μl aliquots of the cells were stained with 20 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD65s antibody (Caltag™, clone VIM2; Invitrogen) on ice for 30 min. The cells were washed twice and resuspended in 100 μl of FACS staining buffer. The transfected cells were then run such that an identical number (5–10,000 depending on the experiment) of CD65s-positive cells were collected for all constructs. To determine the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the transfectants, the profiles of the mock-transfected and transfected cells were overlaid, and the percentage of transfectants that stained positively and the MFI of the positively stained population were assessed. The cells were analyzed on a FACScan (BD Biosciences), and data were further analyzed using FlowJo (TreeStar Inc.). Positive antibody staining was determined by setting the staining of the mock-transfected cells as the negative population and then determining the percentage of the transfectants that stained positively, and the MFI of that population was determined. Previous studies have demonstrated that cells transfected with full-length FucT-V and FucT-VI express a different complement of cell-surface fucosylated antigens (14Weston B.W. Smith P.L. Kelly R.J.

Cells transfected with FucT-V preferentially produce VIM2, whereas cells transfected with FucT-VI preferentially produce sialyl-Lex (Fig. 1). These results indicate that FucT-V and FucT-VI preferentially fucosylate different GlcNAc residues in substrates that contain repeating Galβ1-4GlcNAc (LacNAc) disaccharides, with FucT-V preferentially transferring fucose from GDP-fucose to the internal GlcNAc residue and FucT-VI to the GlcNAc residue near the nonreducing terminus. Domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis of full-length FucT-V and FucT-VI were used to identify the amino acids within the FucT-V and FucT-VI sequences responsible for this substrate specificity (i.e. site-specific fucosylation). Site-specific Fucosylation of Extended Chain Glycolipid Acceptors by Wild-type FucT-V and FucT-VI—Table 3 shows the distribution of the fucose transfer to the III- and V-GlcNAc residues of VI3NeuAc-nLc6Cer catalyzed by wild-type FucT-V and FucT-VI. The results demonstrate that FucT-V transfers >80% of the fucose to the internal III-GlcNAc residue, producing the VIM2 product, whereas the reverse occurs with FucT-VI: >80% preferential fucosylation of the V-GlcNAc residue, producing the sialyl-Lex product. A TLC analysis of these reaction products is shown in Fig. 2 (lanes 1 and 2, respectively). The preferential fucosylation of the III-GlcNAc residue is retained by FucT-V when the non-sialylated acceptor nLc6Cer is used (Fig. 2, lane 3). Interestingly, FucT-VI does not show site-specific fucosylation with the neutral glycolipid (Fig. 2, lane 4).TABLE 3Relative enzyme activity of various FucT swap constructsa Domain swap constructs are shown graphically and defined in table 1.FIGURE 2TLC of products from [14C]fucose transfer to VI3NeuAc-nLc6Cer or nLc6Cer catalyzed by the indicated enzymes. The results for transfer to VI3NeuAc-nLc6Cer are shown after initial desialylation with 1% acetic acid and boiling for 1 h. The positions of the III- and V-GlcNAc monofucosyl products are indicated. The slower migrating band corresponds to III- and V-GlcNAc difucosyl products. Lane 1, transfer to VI3NeuAc-nLc6Cer catalyzed by wild-type FucT-V; lane 2, transfer to VI3NeuAc-nLc6Cer catalyzed by wild-type FucT-VI; lane 3, transfer to nLc6Cer catalyzed by wild-type FucT-V; lane 4, transfer to nLc6Cer catalyzed by wild-type FucT-VI. In lanes 1 and 2, the products produced correspond to VIM2 (III-GlcNAc product) and sialyl-Lex (V-GlcNAc product). In lanes 3 and 4, the products produced correspond to non-sialylated VIM2 (III-GlcNAc product) and Lex (V-GlcNAc product). The plate was developed in a solvent composed of n-propyl alcohol/water/concentrated NH4OH (7:3:1) and autoradiographed. The amount of radioactivity present in each band was determined by scraping the silica corresponding to each individual band from the plate and determining the amount of radioactivity present via liquid scintillation counting. Radioactivity incorporated into the monofucosyl product bands (counts/min for the VIM2 product (III-GlcNAc) followed by counts/min for the sialyl-Lex product (V-GlcNAc)) was as follows: 405 and 95 cpm (lane 1), 60 and 255 cpm (lane 2), 645 and 165 cpm (lane 3), and 410 and 425 cpm (lane 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) a Domain swap constructs are shown graphically and defined in table 1. Table 3 also shows the relative activity of the recombinant wild-type FucT-V and FucT-VI enzymes using LacNAc-O-(CH2)8-COOCH3 as the acceptor. The results from these assays demonstrate that the relative activity of FucT-VI is 12-fold higher than that observed for FucT-V with this acceptor. FucT-V and FucT-VI Domain Swaps—There are 39 amino acid differences (including a 14-amino acid insertion in FucT-V) in the N-terminal non-catalytic domain between the FucT-V and FucT-VI sequences. Much higher sequence homology occurs in the catalytic domain of these enzymes, with 24 amino acid differences occurring in the C-terminal catalytic domains, which contain ∼300 residues (see alignment in Fig. 3). To determine which of the amino acid residue(s) are responsible for the site-specific fucosylation properties of these enzymes, a series of domain swap protein constructs were prepared, and their enzymatic properties were analyzed. Domain swap constructs were produced as shown in Table 1 and were generally composed of varying amounts of the N-terminal portion of one enzyme spliced onto the corresponding C-terminal portion of the other enzyme. In this way, constructs containing varying numbers of the amino acids from the N- and C-terminal portions of the enzyme that differ can be analyzed to successively refine the search for the amino acid(s) that impart the site-specific fucosylation property observed in the FucTs. The results shown in Table 3 demonstrate that all domain swap mutants retained FucT activity. Analysis of the site-specific fucosylation properties of swap sets 1 and 2 demonstrated that it was possible to swap at least the first 85 amino acids from FucT-V for the analogous N-terminal 71 amino acids from FucT-VI without impacting the site-specific fucosylation property of FucT-V. This swapped region contains a total of 39 amino acid differences, including a 14-amino acid insertion in FucT-V that precedes the enzyme's catalytic domain. S"
