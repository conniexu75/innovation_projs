https://openalex.org/W1983883185,"Naked mole rats seem almost entirely protected from developing cancer, and this can now, at least in part, be explained by the production of a unique high-molecular-mass form of hyaluronan, a component of the extracellular matrix; together with an increased sensitivity of naked mole-rat cells to hyaluronan signalling, this form protects its cells from oncogenic transformation. Naked mole rats are remarkable in combining extreme longevity with virtually complete resistance to cancer. Now a novel glycosaminoglycan variant that may have evolved to provide the creatures with the tough, flexible skin needed for a subterranean lifestyle has been identified as a key contributor to their cancer resistance. Hyaluronan, or hyaluronic acid, is a ubiquitous component of the extracellular matrix. Xiao Tian et al. observed that the culture media of naked mole-rat fibroblasts becomes viscous owing to the accumulation of a thick 'gooey' substance and identified it as a high-molecular-mass hyaluronan (HMM-HA), more than five times larger than mouse and human equivalents. It accumulates in naked mole-rat tissues owing to low hyaluronidase activity and a unique form of hyaluronan synthase 2. HMM-HA acts through the CD44 receptor and removal of HMM-HA makes naked mole-rat cells more susceptible to transformation. This unusual model of cancer protection suggests potential new avenues of research into anticancer and life-extension strategies. The naked mole rat (Heterocephalus glaber) displays exceptional longevity, with a maximum lifespan exceeding 30 years1,2,3. This is the longest reported lifespan for a rodent species and is especially striking considering the small body mass of the naked mole rat. In comparison, a similarly sized house mouse has a maximum lifespan of 4 years4,5. In addition to their longevity, naked mole rats show an unusual resistance to cancer. Multi-year observations of large naked mole-rat colonies did not detect a single incidence of cancer2,6. Here we identify a mechanism responsible for the naked mole rat’s cancer resistance. We found that naked mole-rat fibroblasts secrete extremely high-molecular-mass hyaluronan (HA), which is over five times larger than human or mouse HA. This high-molecular-mass HA accumulates abundantly in naked mole-rat tissues owing to the decreased activity of HA-degrading enzymes and a unique sequence of hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2). Furthermore, the naked mole-rat cells are more sensitive to HA signalling, as they have a higher affinity to HA compared with mouse or human cells. Perturbation of the signalling pathways sufficient for malignant transformation of mouse fibroblasts fails to transform naked mole-rat cells. However, once high-molecular-mass HA is removed by either knocking down HAS2 or overexpressing the HA-degrading enzyme, HYAL2, naked mole-rat cells become susceptible to malignant transformation and readily form tumours in mice. We speculate that naked mole rats have evolved a higher concentration of HA in the skin to provide skin elasticity needed for life in underground tunnels. This trait may have then been co-opted to provide cancer resistance and longevity to this species."

The calcium atom provides an ideal system for the study of nuclear shell evolution, from the valley of stability to the limits of existence. Although predictions for the masses of the neutron-rich isotopes 51Ca and 52Ca have been tested by direct measurements, it is an open question as to how nuclear masses evolve for heavier calcium isotopes. Frank Wienholtz and colleagues report the mass determination of the exotic calcium isotopes 53Ca and 54Ca, using a multi-reflection time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The results provide key information for theoretical models and show that a description of extreme neutron-rich nuclei can be closely connected to a deeper understanding of nuclear forces. The properties of exotic nuclei on the verge of existence play a fundamental part in our understanding of nuclear interactions1. Exceedingly neutron-rich nuclei become sensitive to new aspects of nuclear forces2. Calcium, with its doubly magic isotopes 40Ca and 48Ca, is an ideal test for nuclear shell evolution, from the valley of stability to the limits of existence. With a closed proton shell, the calcium isotopes mark the frontier for calculations with three-nucleon forces from chiral effective field theory3,4,5,6. Whereas predictions for the masses of 51Ca and 52Ca have been validated by direct measurements4, it is an open question as to how nuclear masses evolve for heavier calcium isotopes. Here we report the mass determination of the exotic calcium isotopes 53Ca and 54Ca, using the multi-reflection time-of-flight mass spectrometer7 of ISOLTRAP at CERN. The measured masses unambiguously establish a prominent shell closure at neutron number N = 32, in excellent agreement with our theoretical calculations. These results increase our understanding of neutron-rich matter and pin down the subtle components of nuclear forces that are at the forefront of theoretical developments constrained by quantum chromodynamics8."
https://openalex.org/W2148349600,"Allostery is an intrinsic property of many globular proteins and enzymes that is indispensable for cellular regulatory and feedback mechanisms. Recent theoretical and empirical observations indicate that allostery is also manifest in intrinsically disordered proteins, which account for a substantial proportion of the proteome. Many intrinsically disordered proteins are promiscuous binders that interact with multiple partners and frequently function as molecular hubs in protein interaction networks. The adenovirus early region 1A (E1A) oncoprotein is a prime example of a molecular hub intrinsically disordered protein. E1A can induce marked epigenetic reprogramming of the cell within hours after infection, through interactions with a diverse set of partners that include key host regulators such as the general transcriptional coactivator CREB binding protein (CBP), its paralogue p300, and the retinoblastoma protein (pRb; also called RB1). Little is known about the allosteric effects at play in E1A-CBP-pRb interactions, or more generally in hub intrinsically disordered protein interaction networks. Here we used single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to study coupled binding and folding processes in the ternary E1A system. The low concentrations used in these high-sensitivity experiments proved to be essential for these studies, which are challenging owing to a combination of E1A aggregation propensity and high-affinity binding interactions. Our data revealed that E1A-CBP-pRb interactions have either positive or negative cooperativity, depending on the available E1A interaction sites. This striking cooperativity switch enables fine-tuning of the thermodynamic accessibility of the ternary versus binary E1A complexes, and may permit a context-specific tuning of associated downstream signalling outputs. Such a modulation of allosteric interactions is probably a common mechanism in molecular hub intrinsically disordered protein function."
https://openalex.org/W2026833123,"In the Drosophila optic lobes, the medulla processes visual information coming from inner photoreceptors R7 and R8 and from lamina neurons. It contains approximately 40,000 neurons belonging to more than 70 different types. Here we describe how precise temporal patterning of neural progenitors generates these different neural types. Five transcription factors—Homothorax, Eyeless, Sloppy paired, Dichaete and Tailless—are sequentially expressed in a temporal cascade in each of the medulla neuroblasts as they age. Loss of Eyeless, Sloppy paired or Dichaete blocks further progression of the temporal sequence. We provide evidence that this temporal sequence in neuroblasts, together with Notch-dependent binary fate choice, controls the diversification of the neuronal progeny. Although a temporal sequence of transcription factors had been identified in Drosophila embryonic neuroblasts, our work illustrates the generality of this strategy, with different sequences of transcription factors being used in different contexts. Five transcription factors are sequentially expressed in a temporal cascade in Drosophila medulla neuroblasts of the visual system; cross-regulations between these transcription factors control the temporal transitions, and temporal switching of neural progenitors may be a common theme in neuronal specification, with different sequences of transcription factors being used in different contexts. The brain is made up of many different types of neuronal and glial cells, but how their parental neural stem cells generate such diversity during development is largely unknown. Several lines of evidence point to a time element in the development pattern of neural stem cells, and two papers in this issue of Nature use Drosophila melanogaster models to demonstrate a role for temporal progression under the control of regulatory cascades. Omer Ali Bayraktar and Chris Doe (using the fly larval brain) and Claude Desplan and colleagues (using the fly visual system) show that neuronal progenitors change over time as they produce successive waves of regulatory proteins, thus increasing both the size and the diversity of their neuronal and glial progeny. As similar neuronal progenitors — and homologous regulatory proteins — have been identified in developing mammalian brains, it is likely that such temporal patterning also contributes to the neuronal complexity of the human neocortex."
https://openalex.org/W2088772927,"Despite current treatment regimens, heart failure remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed world due to the limited capacity of adult mammalian ventricular cardiomyocytes to divide and replace ventricular myocardium lost from ischaemia-induced infarct. Hence there is great interest to identify potential cellular sources and strategies to generate new ventricular myocardium. Past studies have shown that fish and amphibians and early postnatal mammalian ventricular cardiomyocytes can proliferate to help regenerate injured ventricles; however, recent studies have suggested that additional endogenous cellular sources may contribute to this overall ventricular regeneration. Here we have developed, in the zebrafish (Danio rerio), a combination of fluorescent reporter transgenes, genetic fate-mapping strategies and a ventricle-specific genetic ablation system to discover that differentiated atrial cardiomyocytes can transdifferentiate into ventricular cardiomyocytes to contribute to zebrafish cardiac ventricular regeneration. Using in vivo time-lapse and confocal imaging, we monitored the dynamic cellular events during atrial-to-ventricular cardiomyocyte transdifferentiation to define intermediate cardiac reprogramming stages. We observed that Notch signalling becomes activated in the atrial endocardium following ventricular ablation, and discovered that inhibiting Notch signalling blocked the atrial-to-ventricular transdifferentiation and cardiac regeneration. Overall, these studies not only provide evidence for the plasticity of cardiac lineages during myocardial injury, but more importantly reveal an abundant new potential cardiac resident cellular source for cardiac ventricular regeneration."

https://openalex.org/W2012118125,"Human outer subventricular zone (OSVZ) neural progenitors and Drosophila type II neuroblasts both generate intermediate neural progenitors (INPs) that populate the adult cerebral cortex or central complex, respectively. It is unknown whether INPs simply expand or also diversify neural cell types. Here we show that Drosophila INPs sequentially generate distinct neural subtypes, that INPs sequentially express Dichaete, Grainy head and Eyeless transcription factors, and that these transcription factors are required for the production of distinct neural subtypes. Moreover, parental type II neuroblasts also sequentially express transcription factors and generate different neuronal/glial progeny over time, providing a second temporal identity axis. We conclude that neuroblast and INP temporal patterning axes act together to generate increased neural diversity within the adult central complex; OSVZ progenitors may use similar mechanisms to increase neural diversity in the human brain."
https://openalex.org/W2169522128,"Cell walls of brown algae are complex supramolecular assemblies containing various original, sulfated, and carboxylated polysaccharides. Among these, the major marine polysaccharide component, alginate, represents an important biomass that is successfully turned over by the heterotrophic marine bacteria. In the marine flavobacterium Zobellia galactanivorans, the catabolism and uptake of alginate are encoded by operon structures that resemble the typical Bacteroidetes polysaccharide utilization locus. The genome of Z. galactanivorans contains seven putative alginate lyase genes, five of which are localized within two clusters comprising additional carbohydrate-related genes. This study reports on the detailed biochemical and structural characterization of two of these. We demonstrate here that AlyA1PL7 is an endolytic guluronate lyase, and AlyA5 cleaves unsaturated units, α-L-guluronate or β-D-manuronate residues, at the nonreducing end of oligo-alginates in an exolytic fashion. Despite a common jelly roll-fold, these striking differences of the mode of action are explained by a distinct active site topology, an open cleft in AlyA1(PL7), whereas AlyA5 displays a pocket topology due to the presence of additional loops partially obstructing the catalytic groove. Finally, in contrast to PL7 alginate lyases from terrestrial bacteria, both enzymes proceed according to a calcium-dependent mechanism suggesting an exquisite adaptation to their natural substrate in the context of brown algal cell walls."
https://openalex.org/W1994148077,"Acquisition of fertilization ability by spermatozoa during epididymal transit occurs in part by the transfer of molecules from membranous vesicles called epididymosomes. Epididymosomes are heterogeneous in terms of both size and molecular composition. Exosomes and other related small membranous vesicles (30–120 nm) containing tetraspanin proteins on their surface are found in many biological fluids. In this study, we demonstrate that these vesicles are present in bovine cauda epididymal fluid as a subpopulation of epididymosomes. They contain tetraspanin CD9 in addition to other proteins involved in sperm maturation such as P25b, GliPr1L1, and MIF. In order to study the mechanism of protein transfer to sperm, DilC12-labeled unfractionated epididymosomes or CD9-positive microvesicles were coincubated with epididymal spermatozoa, and their transfer was evaluated by flow cytometry. CD9-positive microvesicles from epididymal fluid specifically transferred molecules to spermatozoa, whereas those prepared from blood were unable to do so. The CD9-positive microvesicles transferred molecules to the same sperm regions (acrosome and midpiece) as epididymosomes, with the same kinetics; however, the molecules were preferentially transferred to live sperm and, in contrast to epididymosomes, Zn2+ did not demonstrate potentiated transfer. Tetraspanin CD9 was associated with other proteins on the membrane surface of CD9-positive microvesicles according to coimmunoprecipitation experiments. CD26 cooperated with CD9 in the molecular transfer to sperm since the amount of molecules transferred was significantly reduced in the presence of specific antibodies. In conclusion, CD9-positive microvesicles are present in bovine cauda epididymal fluid and transfer molecules to live maturing sperm in a tissue-specific manner that involves CD9 and CD26."
https://openalex.org/W2008209471,"Measurement effects exist throughout the sciences–the act of measuring often changes the properties of the observed. We suggest emotion research is no exception. The awareness and conscious assessment required by self-report of emotion may significantly alter emotional processes. In this study, participants engaged in a difficult math task designed to induce anger or shame while their cardiovascular responses were measured. Half of the participants were asked to report on their emotional states and appraise their feelings throughout the experiment, whereas the other half completed a control questionnaire. Among those in the anger condition, participants assigned to report on their emotions exhibited qualitatively different physiological responses from those who did not report. For participants in the shame condition, there were no significant differences in physiology based on the self-report manipulation. The study demonstrates that the simple act of reporting on an emotional state may have a substantial impact on the body’s reaction to an emotional situation."
https://openalex.org/W2079677158,"Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor-1 (BAI1) is an adhesion G protein-coupled receptor that has been studied primarily for its anti-angiogenic and anti-tumorigenic properties. We found that overexpression of BAI1 results in activation of the Rho pathway via a Gα(12/13)-dependent mechanism, with truncation of the BAI1 N terminus resulting in a dramatic enhancement in receptor signaling. This constitutive activity of the truncated BAI1 mutant also resulted in enhanced downstream phosphorylation of ERK as well as increased receptor association with β-arrestin2 and increased ubiquitination of the receptor. To gain insights into the regulation of BAI1 signaling, we screened the C terminus of BAI1 against a proteomic array of PDZ domains to identify novel interacting partners. These screens revealed that the BAI1 C terminus interacts with a variety of PDZ domains from synaptic proteins, including MAGI-3. Removal of the BAI1 PDZ-binding motif resulted in attenuation of receptor signaling to Rho but had no effect on ERK activation. Conversely, co-expression with MAGI-3 was found to potentiate signaling to ERK by constitutively active BAI1 in a manner that was dependent on the PDZ-binding motif of the receptor. Biochemical fractionation studies revealed that BAI1 is highly enriched in post-synaptic density fractions, a finding consistent with our observations that BAI1 can interact with PDZ proteins known to be concentrated in the post-synaptic density. These findings demonstrate that BAI1 is a synaptic receptor that can activate both the Rho and ERK pathways, with the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the receptor playing key roles in the regulation of BAI1 signaling activity."

https://openalex.org/W2015919453,"A coarse-grained model is used to study the mechanical response of 35 virus capsids of symmetries T = 1, T = 2, T = 3, pseudo T = 3, T = 4, and T = 7. The model is based on the native structure of the proteins that constitute the capsids and is described in terms of the C atoms associated with each amino acid. The number of these atoms ranges between 8 460 (for SPMV – satellite panicum mosaic virus) and 135 780 (for NBV – nudaureli virus). Nanoindentation by a broad AFM tip is modeled as compression between two planes: either both flat or one flat and one curved. Plots of the compressive force versus plate separation show a variety of behaviors, but in each case there is an elastic region which extends to a characteristic force . Crossing results in a drop in the force and irreversible damage. Across the 35 capsids studied, both and the elastic stiffness are observed to vary by a factor of 20. The changes in mechanical properties do not correlate simply with virus size or symmetry. There is a strong connection to the mean coordination number , defined as the mean number of interactions to neighboring amino acids. The Young's modulus for thin shell capsids rises roughly quadratically with , where 6 is the minimum coordination for elastic stability in three dimensions."
https://openalex.org/W2097669240,"Survival rates from childhood cancer have improved dramatically in the last 40 years, such that over 80% of children are now cured. However in certain subgroups, including metastatic osteosarcoma, survival has remained stubbornly poor, despite dose intensive multi-agent chemotherapy regimens, and new therapeutic approaches are needed. Hypoxia is common in adult solid tumours and is associated with treatment resistance and poorer outcome. Hypoxia induces chemotherapy resistance in paediatric tumours including neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma, in vitro, and this drug resistance is dependent on the oxygen-regulated transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). In this study the effects of hypoxia on the response of the osteosarcoma cell lines 791T, HOS and U2OS to the clinically relevant cytotoxics cisplatin, doxorubicin and etoposide were evaluated. Significant hypoxia-induced resistance to all three agents was seen in all three cell lines and hypoxia significantly reduced drug-induced apoptosis. Hypoxia also attenuated drug-induced activation of p53 in the p53 wild-type U2OS osteosarcoma cells. Drug resistance was not induced by HIF-1α stabilisation in normoxia by cobalt chloride nor reversed by the suppression of HIF-1α in hypoxia by shRNAi, siRNA, dominant negative HIF or inhibition with the small molecule NSC-134754, strongly suggesting that hypoxia-induced drug resistance in osteosarcoma cells is independent of HIF-1α. Inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway using the inhibitor PI-103 did not reverse hypoxia-induced drug resistance, suggesting the hypoxic activation of Akt in osteosarcoma cells does not play a significant role in hypoxia-induced drug resistance. Targeting hypoxia is an exciting prospect to improve current anti-cancer therapy and combat drug resistance. Significant hypoxia-induced drug resistance in osteosarcoma cells highlights the potential importance of hypoxia as a target to reverse drug resistance in paediatric osteosarcoma. The novel finding of HIF-1α independent drug resistance suggests however other hypoxia related targets may be more relevant in paediatric osteosarcoma."

https://openalex.org/W2079032209,"Recent work has revealed an essential involvement of soluble CD40L (sCD40L) in inflammation and vascular disease. Activated platelets are the major source of sCD40L, which has been implicated in platelet and leukocyte activation, although its exact functional impact on leukocyte-platelet interactions and the underlying mechanisms remain undefined. We aimed to determine the impact and the mechanisms of sCD40L on neutrophils. We studied neutrophil interactions with activated, surface-adherent platelets as a model for leukocyte recruitment to the sites of injury. Our data show that CD40L contributes to neutrophil firm adhesion to and transmigration across activated surface-adherent platelets, possibly through two potential mechanisms. One involves the direct interaction of ligand-receptor (CD40L-CD40), i.e., platelet surface CD40L interaction with neutrophil CD40; another involves an indirect mechanism, i.e. soluble CD40L stimulates activation of the leukocyte-specific β2 integrin Mac-1 in neutrophils and thereby further promotes neutrophil adhesion and migration. Activation of the integrin Mac-1 is known to be critical for mediating neutrophil adhesion and migration. sCD40L activated Mac-1 in neutrophils and enhanced neutrophil-platelet interactions in wild-type neutrophils, but failed to elicit such responses in CD40-deficient neutrophils. Furthermore, our data show that the protein kinase C zeta (PKCζ) is critically required for sCD40L-induced Mac-1 activation and neutrophil adhesive function. sCD40L strongly stimulated the focal clustering of Mac-1 (CD11b) and the colocalization of Mac-1 with PKCζ in wild-type neutrophils, but had minimal effect in CD40-deficient neutrophils. Blocking PKCζ completely inhibited sCD40L-induced neutrophil firm adhesion. Moreover, sCD40L strongly stimulates neutrophil oxidative burst via CD40-dependent activation of PI3K/NF-KB, but independent of Mac-1 and PKCζ. These findings may contribute to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms by which sCD40L/CD40 pathway contributes to inflammation and vascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2163904072,"We investigated the effect of hypertension on the function and structure of cerebral parenchymal arterioles (PAs), a major target of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), and determined whether relaxin is a treatment for SVD during hypertension. PAs were isolated from 18-wk-old female normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHRs), and SHRs treated with human relaxin 2 for 14 d (4 μg/h; n=8/group) and studied using a pressurized arteriograph system. Hypertension reduced PA inner diameter (58±3 vs. 49±3 μm at 60 mmHg in WKY rats, P<0.05), suggesting inward remodeling that was reversed by relaxin (56±4 μm, P<0.05). Relaxin also increased PA distensibility in SHRs (34±2 vs. 10±2% in SHRs, P<0.05). Relaxin was detected in cerebrospinal fluid (110±30 pg/ml) after systemic administration, suggesting that it crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Relaxin receptors (RXFP1/2) were not detected in cerebral vasculature, but relaxin increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) expression in brain cortex. Inhibition of VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase (axitinib, 4 mg/kg/d, 14 d) had no effect on increased distensibility with relaxin, but caused outward hypertrophic remodeling of PAs from SHRs. These results suggest that relaxin crosses the BBB and activates MMP-2 in brain cortex, which may interact with PAs to increase distensibility. VEGF appears to be involved in remodeling of PAs, but not relaxin-induced increased distensibility."
https://openalex.org/W1998007473,"Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 is a major cause of zoonotic food- and water-borne intestinal infections worldwide with clinical consequences ranging from mild diarrhoea to hemolytic uraemic syndrome. The genome of EHEC O157:H7 contains many regions of unique DNA that are referred to as O islands including the Shiga toxin prophages and pathogenicity islands encoding key virulence factors. However many of these O islands are of unknown function. In this study, genetic analysis was conducted on OI-172 which is a 44,434 bp genomic island with 27 open reading frames. Comparative genome analysis showed that O1-72 is a composite island with progressive gain of genes since O157:H7 evolved from its ancestral O55:H7. A partial OI-172 island was also found in 2 unrelated E. coli strains and 2 Salmonella strains. OI-172 encodes several putative helicases, one of which (Z5898) is a putative DEAH box RNA helicase. To investigate the function of Z5898, a deletion mutant (EDL933ΔZ5898) was constructed in the O157:H7 strain EDL933. Comparative proteomic analysis of the mutant with the wild-type EDL933 found that flagellin was down-regulated in the Z5898 mutant. Motility assay showed that EDL933ΔZ5898 migrated slower than the wild-type EDL933 and electron microscopy found no surface flagella. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR revealed that the fliC expression of EDL933ΔZ5898 was significantly lower while the expression of its upstream regulator gene, fliA, was not affected. Using a fliA and a fliC promoter – green fluorescent protein fusion contruct, Z5898 was found to affect only the fliC promoter activity. Therefore, Z5898 regulates the flagella based motility by exerting its effect on fliC. We conclude that OI-172 is a motility associated O island and hereby name it the MAO island."

Our objective was to determine the effects of prenatal SSRI-exposure on the infants' neurological functioning, adjusted for maternal mental health.A prospective observational study from May 2007 to April 2010. The study groups comprised 63 SSRI-exposed infants (SSRI group) and 44 non-exposed infants (non-SSRI group). Maternal depression and anxiety were measured using questionnaires. The main outcome measures during the first week after birth and at three to four months were the quality of the infants' general movements (GMs) according to Prechtl and a detailed motor optimality score. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for abnormal GM quality in the SSRI and non-SSRI groups, and adjusted for maternal depression, anxiety, and other confounders. The study was registered under 53506435 in the ISRCTN.All infants were born around term. During the first week, abnormal GMs occurred more frequently in the SSRI group than in the non-SSRI group (59% versus 33%) and the median MOS was lower (13 versus 18). The OR for abnormal GMs in the SSRI versus the non-SSRI group was 3.0 (95% CI, 1.3 to 6.9) and increased after adjustment for confounders. At three to four months, more SSRI-exposed infants had monotonous movements (48% versus 20%) with lower median MOSs (26 versus 28). The OR for monotonous movements was 3.5 (95% CI, 1.5 to 8.6) and increased after adjusting for confounders.Prenatal exposure to SSRI had an adverse effect on early neurological functioning as reflected by GM quality, irrespective of maternal depression and anxiety, and other confounders. Physicians should take this into account in consultation with parents."
https://openalex.org/W2011152865,"Variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) are leucine-rich repeat proteins that mediate adaptive immunity in jawless vertebrates. VLRs were recently shown to recognize glycans, such as the tumor-associated Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen (TFα; Galβ1-3GalNAcα), with a selectivity rivaling or exceeding that of lectins and antibodies. To understand the basis for TFα recognition by one such VLR (VLRB.aGPA.23), we measured thermodynamic parameters for the binding interaction and determined the structure of the VLRB.aGPA.23-TFα complex to 2.2 Å resolution. In the structure, four tryptophan residues form a tight hydrophobic cage encasing the TFα disaccharide that completely excludes buried water molecules. This cage together with hydrogen bonding of sugar hydroxyls to polar side chains explains the exquisite selectivity of VLRB.aGPA.23. The topology of the glycan-binding site of VLRB.aGPA.23 differs markedly from those of lectins or antibodies, which typically consist of long, convex grooves for accommodating the oligosaccharide. Instead, the TFα disaccharide is sandwiched between a variable loop and the concave surface of the VLR formed by the β-strands of the leucine-rich repeat modules. Longer oligosaccharides are predicted to extend perpendicularly across the β-strands, requiring them to bend to match the concavity of the VLR solenoid."
https://openalex.org/W2013953837,"The M-domain is the major regulatory subunit of cardiac myosin-binding protein-C (cMyBP-C) that modulates actin and myosin interactions to influence muscle contraction. However, the precise mechanism(s) and the specific residues involved in mediating the functional effects of the M-domain are not fully understood. Positively charged residues adjacent to phosphorylation sites in the M-domain are thought to be critical for effects of cMyBP-C on cross-bridge interactions by mediating electrostatic binding with myosin S2 and/or actin. However, recent structural studies revealed that highly conserved sequences downstream of the phosphorylation sites form a compact tri-helix bundle. Here we used site-directed mutagenesis to probe the functional significance of charged residues adjacent to the phosphorylation sites and conserved residues within the tri-helix bundle. Results confirm that charged residues adjacent to phosphorylation sites and residues within the tri-helix bundle are important for mediating effects of the M-domain on contraction. In addition, four missense variants within the tri-helix bundle that are associated with human hypertrophic cardiomyopathy caused either loss-of-function or gain-of-function effects on force. Importantly, the effects of the gain-of-function variant, L348P, increased the affinity of the M-domain for actin. Together, results demonstrate that functional effects of the M-domain are not due solely to interactions with charged residues near phosphorylatable serines and provide the first demonstration that the tri-helix bundle contributes to the functional effects of the M-domain, most likely by binding to actin."

Vance K.M. Ogden K.K. Hansen K.B. Yuan H. Myers S.J. Dingledine R. Glutamate receptor ion channels: structure, regulation, and function.Pharmacol. Rev. 2010; 62: 405-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2514) Google Scholar). All ionotropic glutamate receptors subunits contain an intracellular C-terminal domain (CTD). 2The abbreviations used are: CTD, C-terminal domain; GluN, NMDA-sensitive receptor subunit; IDP, intrinsically disordered protein; bis-ANS, 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid; SEC, size exclusion chromatography; ANS, anilinonaphthalene sulfonic acid; smFRET, single molecule, fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The CTDs are critical in regulating the number, distribution, and biophysical properties of ionotropic glutamate receptors (1.Traynelis S.F. Wollmuth L.P. McBain C.J. Menniti F.S. Vance K.M.

Neurosci. 2007; 8: 413-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Upon the evolution of vertebrates, the NMDA-sensitive receptor subunits (GluNs) acquired distinct CTDs that coupled receptors to isoform-specific downstream signaling pathways (3.Ryan T.J. Kopanitsa M.V. Indersmitten T. Nithianantharajah J. Afinowi N.O. Pettit C. Stanford L.E. Sprengel R. Saksida L.M. Bussey T.J. O'Dell T.J. Grant S.G. Komiyama N.H. Evolution of GluN2A/B cytoplasmic domains diversified vertebrate synaptic plasticity and behavior.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Deletion of the GluN2B CTD is lethal (4.Sprengel R. Suchanek B. Amico C. Brusa R. Burnashev N. Rozov A. Hvalby O. Jensen V. Paulsen O. Andersen P. Kim J.J. Thompson R.F. Sun W. Webster L.C.

Importance of the intracellular domain of NR2 subunits for NMDA receptor function in vivo.Cell. 1998; 92: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The GluN2B CTD directs synaptic targeting through interactions with scaffold proteins such as PSD-95 but also modulates ion channel gating and sensitivity to extracellular Zn2+ (1.Traynelis S.F. Wollmuth L.P. McBain C.J. Menniti F.S. Vance K.M. Ogden K.K. Hansen K.B. Yuan H. Myers S.J. Dingledine R. Glutamate receptor ion channels: structure, regulation, and function.Pharmacol. Rev. 2010; 62: 405-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2514) Google Scholar). The binding of Zn2+ to the extracellular N-terminal domain inhibits channel gating (5.Rachline J. Perin-Dureau F. Le Goff A. Neyton J. Paoletti P. The micromolar zinc-binding domain on the NMDA receptor subunit NR2B.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 308-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Src phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain alleviates inhibition by extracellular Zn2+ (6.Zheng F. Gingrich M.B. Traynelis S.F. Conn P.J. Tyrosine kinase potentiates NMDA receptor currents by reducing tonic zinc inhibition.Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The mechanism whereby the CTD affects receptor function is largely unknown. In contrast to the extracellular and transmembrane domains, the GluN2B CTD is predicted to be intrinsically disordered (3.Ryan T.J. Kopanitsa M.V. Indersmitten T. Nithianantharajah J. Afinowi N.O. Pettit C. Stanford L.E. Sprengel R. Saksida L.M. Bussey T.J. O'Dell T.J. Grant S.G. Komiyama N.H. Evolution of GluN2A/B cytoplasmic domains diversified vertebrate synaptic plasticity and behavior.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Disordered proteins are in constant dynamic motion sampling alternative conformations. This complicates structure function studies because there is no structure to disrupt. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are critical components of mammalian signal transduction (7.Zhou H.-X. Intrinsic disorder: signaling via highly specific but short-lived association.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2012; 37: 43-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 8.Uversky V.N. Oldfield C.J. Dunker A.K. Showing your ID: intrinsic disorder as an ID for recognition, regulation, and cell signaling.J. Mol. Recognit. 2005; 18: 343-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). The amount of disorder in the proteome has increased over evolutionary time (9.Ward J.J. Sodhi J.S. McGuffin L.J. Buxton B.F. Jones D.T. Prediction and functional analysis of native disorder in proteins from the three kingdoms of life.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar) suggesting that disorder provides selective advantages. Disorder is prominent in proteins that interact with multiple partners such as scaffolds (10.Cortese M.S. Uversky V.N. Dunker A.K. Intrinsic disorder in scaffold proteins: getting more from less.Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2008; 98: 85-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The flexibility of disordered polypeptides allows the same amino acid sequence to adopt different structures and thereby interact with different ligands (11.Oldfield C.J. Meng J. Yang J. Yang M. Uversky V.N. Dunker A.K. Flexible nets: disorder and induced fit in the associations of p53 and 14-3-3 with their partners.BMC Genomics. 2008; 9: S1Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Disorder is also prominent in the cytoplasmic domains (CTDs) of cell surface proteins such as ion channels and receptors (12.Minezaki Y. Homma K. Nishikawa K. Intrinsically disordered regions of human plasma membrane proteins preferentially occur in the cytoplasmic segment.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 902-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 13.Xue B. Li L. Meroueh S.O. Uversky V.N. Dunker A.K. Analysis of structured and intrinsically disordered regions of transmembrane proteins.Mol. BioSyst. 2009; 5: 1688-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). IDPs are not densely packed like the core of folded proteins. IDPs range in compactness from swollen “random” coils to disordered globules (14.Uversky V.N. Dunker A.K. Understanding protein non-folding.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1804: 1231-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). Proline is strongly associated with intrinsic disorder, and proline content correlates with polypeptide expansion (15.Marsh J.A. Forman-Kay J.D. Sequence determinants of compaction in intrinsically disordered proteins.Biophys. J. 2010; 98: 2383-2390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Proline's cyclic structure renders the polypeptide more rigid than other amino acids. Additionally, although the proline side chain is hydrophobic, proline's lack of an NH group amino acid renders polyproline much more water-soluble than polyglycine or polyalanine (16.Berger A. Kurtz J. Katchalski E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1954; 76: 5552-5554Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We took advantage of these unique properties of proline as a means of modulating the intrinsic disorder by systematically replacing proline residues in the GluN2B CTD. By altering the conformation of the disordered CTD with proline depletion, we were able to uncouple physiological regulation of the NMDA receptor by extracellular Zn2+ while preserving basic functions associated with gating, biogenesis, and trafficking. As predicted, biophysical measurements found a direct correlation between proline content and polypeptide compaction. Specific proline residues were necessary to prevent aggregation of this otherwise soluble protein. Thus, proline could modulate the attractive potential of short linear motifs. In accordance with this notion, we also observed reduced binding affinity to a PDZ domain from the scaffold protein PSD-95. Our studies show that proline residues are critical regulators of the conformational dynamics in intrinsically disordered polypeptides. The same mutations affected the biological activity of the intact receptor. These findings suggest that the underlying dynamics of the disordered cytoplasmic domain mediate the allosteric regulation of ionotropic glutamate receptor gating. The C-terminal domain 2 (CTD2) of GluN2B (residues 1259–1482), which is C-terminal to the palmitoylation sites (17.Hayashi T. Thomas G.M. Huganir R.L. Dual palmitoylation of NR2 subunits regulates NMDA receptor trafficking.Neuron. 2009; 64: 213-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), was cloned into pPROEX HTB (Invitrogen) and expressed in the Rosetta strain of Escherichia coli (EMD Biosciences, San Diego). The His6 fusion was purified under reducing and denaturing conditions as described (18.Choi U.B. McCann J.J. Weninger K.R. Bowen M.E.

Xiao S. Wollmuth L.P. Bowen M.E. Effect of Src kinase phosphorylation on disordered C-terminal domain of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor subunit GluN2B protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 29904-29912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The protein was exchanged to nondenaturing conditions by extensive washing while bound to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose. The His6 tag was removed with tobacco etch virus protease, and the protein was further purified with cation exchange and size exclusion (GE Healthcare). Purity was greater than 95% as verified using SDS-PAGE. The PDZ2 domain from PSD-95(155–249) was cloned into pPROEX HTB and purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose under nondenaturing conditions. Chicken c-Src kinase (residues 83–534) was kindly provided by Dr. Markus Seeliger. Proteins were phosphorylated in the presence of 1 mm ATP and 1 mm MgCl2 followed by cation exchange to remove Src. Phosphorylation was confirmed by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). For mammalian cell expression, GluN2B subunits were tagged with GFP at the N terminus following the signal peptide. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells were co-transfected with cDNA for GluN1 and GluN2B at a ratio of 2:2 (in micrograms) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Some transfections include 1 μg of a vector expressing soluble enhanced GFP (pEGFP-Cl, Clontech) to facilitate identification of transfected cells. Recordings were made 24–72 h after transfection. Currents were recorded at room temperature using an EPC-9 amplifier with Patchmaster software (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany), low-pass filtered at 2 kHz, and digitized at 20 kHz. See Ref. 20.Yelshansky M.V. Sobolevsky A.I. Jatzke C. Wollmuth L.P. Block of AMPA receptor desensitization by a point mutation outside the ligand-binding domain.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4728-4736Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar for additional details. Our standard intracellular (pipette) solution consisted of (in millimolars) 140 KCl, 10 HEPES, and 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA), pH 7.2 (KOH). The standard external solution consisted of (in millimolars) 150 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 0.1 glycine, at pH 7.2 (NaOH). External solutions were applied using a piezo-driven double barrel application system. One barrel contained only external solution, and the other barrel was supplemented with 1 mm glutamate. Glutamate-activated current amplitudes were first recorded in the absence of Zn2+ (Ipre). Subsequently, we recorded glutamate-activated current in 1 μm Zn2+ (IZn) and finally recorded glutamate-activated current amplitudes following Zn2+ washout (Ipost). We calculated inhibition as shown in Equation 1, % inhibition = 100×(Icontrol−IZn)Icontrol(Eq. 1) where Icontrol is the average of Ipre and Ipost. Results are presented as mean ± S.E. Student's t test was used to define statistical differences. Significance was defined at p < 0.05. Analytical size exclusion chromatography (SEC) measurements were performed on a Shodex KW-802.5 column in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT at 4 °C. Purified proteins were injected at 20 μm. The apparent molecular weight (Mr) of soluble CTD2 constructs was obtained by calibrating the column with gel filtration standards (Bio-Rad). The hydrodynamic radius (RH) was obtained through Equation 2 (21.Uversky V.N. What does it mean to be natively unfolded?.Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). log(RH)=−0.204+0.357×log(Mr)(Eq. 2) Limited proteolysis experiments were conducted by adding sequencing grade trypsin or chymotrypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) to purified CTD2 at a 1:100 ratio (proteinase to sample). For each time point, an aliquot from the reaction was inhibited by adding 0.5 mm PMSF followed by a 1:1 dilution with 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer and flash-frozen. The samples were resolved on 15% acrylamide gels. Ensemble fluorescence spectra were collected using an ISS PC1 photon counting spectrofluorimeter (ISS Inc., Champaign, IL). For 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid (bis-ANS; Invitrogen), excitation was at 385 nm. For endogenous fluorescence, excitation was at 250 nm. All slits were set to 2 nm. Circular dichroism spectra were collected using a Chirascan spectrometer (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK). Proteins were at 15 μm in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, at 20 °C. CTD2 has three native cysteines. All experiments used the native cysteine Cys-1453. Chimera 001 also used the native cysteine Cys-1353. For the remaining intramolecular FRET measurements, we introduced a second cysteine (S1323C) using site-directed mutagenesis. All other cysteines were mutated to serine. For studies on conformational dynamics, CTD2 was randomly labeled with an equimolar ratio of Alexa Fluor 555 C5 maleimide and Alexa Fluor 647 C2 maleimide (Invitrogen) overnight at 4 °C in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. For binding studies, CTD2 was singly labeled at Cys-1453 with Alexa Fluor 647. PDZ2 contains no native cysteines so one was introduced (M159C) using site-directed mutagenesis and labeled with Alexa Fluor 555. In all cases, free dye was removed by desalting on a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) followed by dialysis. Detailed procedures for our single molecule fluorescence measurements were described previously (22.Choi U.B. Weninger K.R. Bowen M.E. Immobilization of proteins for single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements of conformation and dynamics.Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 896: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, for intramolecular FRET measurements, CTD2 was encapsulated during extrusion within 100 nm liposomes made from egg phosphatidylcholine containing 0.1 mol % of biotin-phosphatidylethanolamine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL). Liposomes were immobilized on a quartz microscope slide passivated with biotinylated BSA. For binding studies, biotinylated CTD2 was directly immobilized to the passivated quartz slide by streptavidin. For inter-molecular binding assay, 50 nm of donor-labeled PDZ2 was added to the observation buffer. To eliminate nonspecific binding to the surface, we further passivated the BSA-coated surface with egg phosphatidylcholine liposomes. The FRET signals were recorded using a prism-type total internal reflection microscope, detected by an iXon EMCCD camera (Andor Technologies, Belfast, UK). Samples were illuminated with an alternating laser sequence of 532 and 635 nm to identify single donor and acceptor dyes. All measurements utilized an oxygen scavenger (20 units/ml glucose oxidase, 1000 units/ml catalase) and a triplet-state quencher (100 μm cyclooctatetraene) to delay photobleaching and prevent rapid blinking. To characterize dynamic FRET signals, we analyzed single molecule trajectories using hidden Markov modeling as implemented in HaMMy version 4.0 (23.McKinney S.A. Joo C. Ha T. Analysis of single-molecule FRET trajectories using hidden Markov modeling.Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 1941-1951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). This algorithm determines the most probable time sequence of FRET states sampled by each molecule. For analysis of stochastic conformational transitions, we used the initial guesses provided by the software for a three-state system (E = 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75). The dwell times for all states were plotted in a single histogram, which was well fit by a single exponential to extract the transition rate. For binding studies, we assumed a two-state system with a high FRET-bound state and zero FRET-unbound state. The dwell times in the bound and unbound state were plotted in separate histograms, which were fit by a single exponential to extract the bound time, which equals 1/koff. The unbound time, multiplied by the concentration of protein in solution, equals 1/kon. The dissociation constant, KD, was calculated as koff/kon. Intrinsically disordered proteins lack the “order-promoting” amino acids (Cys, Trp, Ile, Tyr, Phe, Leu, His, Val, and Asn), which form the hydrophobic core of folded proteins, and instead contain amino acids that promote disorder (Ala, Gly, Arg, Thr, Ser, Lys, Gln, Glu, and Pro) (24.Williams R.M. Obradovi Z. Mathura V. Braun W. Garner E.C. Young J. Takayama S. Brown C.J. Dunker A.K. The protein non-folding problem: amino acid determinants of intrinsic order and disorder.Pac. Symp.

Sequence complexity of disordered protein.Proteins. 2001; 42: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). To investigate the compositional biases in the CTD of GluN2B, we used the Composition Profiler (26.Vacic V. Uversky V.N. Dunker A.K. Lonardi S. Composition profiler: a tool for discovery and visualization of amino acid composition differences.BMC Bioinformatics. 2007; 8: 211Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), which calculates the normalized content of a given residue in our query protein relative to that found in typical folded proteins (27.Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. The Protein Data Bank.Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27438) Google Scholar). For reference, we include the composition profile for typical disordered proteins (28.Sickmeier M. Hamilton J.A. LeGall T. Vacic V. Cortese M.S. Tantos A. Szabo B. Tompa P. Chen J. Uversky V.N. Obradovic Z. Dunker A.K. DisProt: the database of disordered proteins.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: D786-D793Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). The CTD of the GluN2B subunit (838–1482) is depleted in order-promoting amino acids, which would define a low propensity for independent folding (Fig. 1A). Relative to disordered proteins, GluN2B is slightly enriched in aromatic residues (Tyr and Phe), which are normally associated with order. This could define sites of protein interaction with GluN2B or local regions of the CTD that could become ordered. The GluN2B CTD contains a palmitoylation site, which breaks the CTD into two subdomains CTD1(838–1258) and CTD2(1259–1482). The compositional profile for CTD2 is shown separately in Fig. 1A. CTD2 is enriched in proline with 19 proline residues distributed with regular spacing (11 ± 8 residues). Proline enrichment is typical of disordered proteins so the DisProt database is similarly enriched in proline. CTD2 contains both Src phosphorylation sites associated with alleviating Zn2+ inhibition. To modulate the conformation of this intrinsically disordered domain, we removed the proline residues from CTD2 by replacing them with either serine or alanine. Wild type CTD2 expresses robustly in E. coli and is highly soluble (>10−4 m) in physiological buffers (data not shown). Surprisingly, complete proline depletion of CTD2 (with either alanine or serine) rendered CTD2 insoluble (data not shown). The proline-depleted construct expressed well and remained soluble in 2 m urea. Below 2 m urea, the construct formed an irregular precipitate. Because we observed no differences between serine and alanine, subsequent studies focused on alanine substitution. Based on the disorder predictor PONDR-VLXT (Fig. 1B), the first half of CTD2 is expected to be highly disordered, but this tendency decreases in the central 100 residues. The substitution of proline noticeably decreased the propensity of disorder in several regions. The most dramatic effect was linked to removal of prolines from the central region. Analysis with Zyggregator, which predicts protein aggregation (29.Tartaglia G.G. Pawar A.P. Campioni S. Dobson C.M. Chiti F. Vendruscolo M. Prediction of aggregation-prone regions in structured proteins.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 380: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), revealed that CTD2 contains aggregation-prone regions, but these are typically short (Fig. 1C). The aggregation propensity of the central region (residues 1356–1409) is most drastically affected by the proline depletion with the overall aggregation score approaching the value of 1.0. Thus, the central region has a higher potential to become ordered upon proline depletion and is likely to become aggregation-prone. To experimentally assign the proline residues needed for solubility, we divided CTD2 into three regions with equal proline content as follows: N-terminal (residues 1259–1355, 7 prolines), central (residues 1356–1409, 6 prolines), and C-terminal (residues 1410–1482, 6 prolines) (Fig. 2A). We then depleted each region of prolines. To denote the region of proline depletion, we adopted a binary nomenclature, where 0 (or white) is used to represent the presence of endogenous prolines, and 1 (or black) is used to represent the substitution of all prolines in a region to alanine (Fig. 2A). Wild type is denoted by 000, and the completely proline-free CTD2 is denoted by 111. Five intermediate constructs were created designated 100, 010, 001, 011, and 101. On SDS-PAGE, wild type CTD2 shows anomalous electrophoretic mobility, migrating as a protein with larger molecular mass (Fig. 2B). Anomalously high electrophoretic mobility is typical for IDPs (30.Tompa P. Intrinsically unstructured proteins.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 527-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1675) Google Scholar). The proline-depleted construct (111) showed increased electrophoretic mobility but still migrated slower than expected based on mass. Constructs 100, 101, and 111 showed increased mobility, and the other constructs showed mobility similar to that of wild type CTD2. Thus, electrophoretic mobility did not correlate with proline content. The electrophoretic mobility difference was only associated with proline depletions in the N-terminal third of the polypeptide. This suggests that specific proline residues affect the detergent-induced, denatured state of CTD2. Each construct was tested for solubility by extracting the protein in physiological buffers followed by centrifugation to remove insoluble material. Solubility was assessed by comparing SDS-PAGE before and after sedimentation (data not shown). Interestingly, solubility did not directly correlate with the number of proline mutations (Fig. 2A, right column). The most depleted construct remained soluble (101, 13 prolines replaced). In contrast, depletion of six prolines from the central region (010) was sufficient for insolubility, as predicted by Zyggregator. To narrow down the proline residues controlling aggregation, we mutated individual alanines in 010 back to prolines (Fig. 2C). Restoring only three proline residues, 1356, 1377, and 1387, was sufficient to restore partial solubility, although any additional proline completely restored solubility to wild type levels. To avoid complications with aggregation, all subsequent experiments used mutants that were soluble in recombinant expression unless otherwise indicated. In NMDA receptors, the divalent cation Zn2+ inhibits the opening of the ion channel in response to glutamate (1.Traynelis S.F. Wollmuth L.P. McBain C.J. Menniti F.S. Vance K.M. Ogden K.K. Hansen K.B.

Zn2+ acts at the extracellular N-terminal domain. Src kinase phosphorylation in CTD2 can alleviate Zn2+ inhibition (6.Zheng F. Gingrich M.B. Traynelis S.F. Conn P.J. Tyrosine kinase potentiates NMDA receptor currents by reducing tonic zinc inhibition.Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that Src phosphorylation causes a uniform expansion of CTD2 (19.Choi U.B. Xiao S. Wollmuth L.P. Bowen M.E. Effect of Src kinase phosphorylation on disordered C-terminal domain of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor subunit GluN2B protein.J. Biol.

Thus, the conformational dynamics of CTD2 may be important in allosteric regulation of GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors. To address whether the conformational dynamics of CTD2 contribute to channel gating, we introduced proline depletions into the full-length GluN2B subunit and recorded membrane currents in NMDA receptors using patch clamp electrophysiology. To avoid complications associated with aggregation, we used the soluble 101 construct, which lacks proline near both Src phosphorylation sites. NMDA receptors are obligate h"

EMSA and isothermal titration calorimetry binding studies with in vivo target RNA suggested that hnRNP L-mediated RNA looping may occur in vivo. Our study provides a mechanistic explanation for the dual functions of hnRNP L in alternative splicing regulation as an activator or repressor. Background: hnRNP L is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein implicated in alternative splicing regulation, etc. Results: RRM1 and RRM34 of hnRNP L adopt nearly typical RRM topology and use β-sheets to bind RNA. Conclusion: hnRNP L RRM34 facilitates the target RNA with appropriate in-between distance to form a loop. Significance: RNA looping suggests a general mechanism for alternative splicing regulators possessing position-dependent dual roles.

Cell. 2010; 37: 223-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). hnRNP L binds to various types of genes and regulates the alternative splicing and expression of different isoforms, for example, pro- and anti-apoptotic isoforms of caspase-9 in non-small cell lung cancer (2.Shankarling G.

Hui J. Schreiner S. Hung L.H. Bindereif A. hnRNP L-mediated regulation of mammalian alternative splicing by interference with splice site recognition.RNA Biol. 2010; 7: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) showed that hnRNP L represses exon inclusion by binding to intronic high score binding motifs located close to splice sites of tight junction protein 1 (TJP1) and solute carrier family 2 (facilitated glucose transporter) member 2 (SLC2A2) genes, which sterically prevent splice site recognition by snRNPs. House and Lynch (21.House A.E. Lynch K.W. An exonic splicing silencer represses spliceosome assembly after ATP-dependent exon recognition.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 937-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) demonstrated that hnRNP L binds to an exonic splicing silencer in CD45 exon 4 and forms a ternary complex with the U1 and U2 snRNPs flanking the exon, which interferes with cross-intron snRNP pairing and blocks the transition from an A or A-like complex to a B complex in the developing spliceosome. Motta-Mena et al. (3.Motta-Mena L.B. Heyd F. Lynch K.W. Context-dependent regulatory mechanism of the splicing factor hnRNP L.Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 223-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) proposed that hnRNP L represses CD45 exon 5 usage in T cells by inhibiting the binding of the exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) to the enhancer complex that recruits the U2 snRNP. However, how hnRNP L binds RNA to regulate alternative pre-mRNA splicing remains unknown. hnRNP L contains four RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also known as RNA-binding domains. The RRM domain is ∼90 amino acids long and contains conserved eight- and six-residue motifs named RNP-1 and RNP-2, respectively. It usually folds into a typical β1α1β2β3α2β4 structure, including a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet as the primary RNA-binding surface. Three aromatic residues at key positions of the canonical RNP-1 and RNP-2 motifs on the central strands are responsible for nonspecific contacts with RNA (22.Maris C. Dominguez C. Allain F.H. The RNA recognition motif, a plastic RNA-binding platform to regulate post-transcriptional gene expression.FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2118-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, no conserved aromatic residues at key positions in RNP-1 and RNP-2 are found in any of the four RRM domains of hnRNP L (Fig. 1A). Several structures of RRM domains without conserved aromatic residues in RNPs have been determined (23.Oberstrass F.C. Auweter S.D. Erat M. Hargous Y. Henning A. Wenter P. Reymond L. Amir-Ahmady B.

The structure of the mRNA export factor TAP reveals a cis arrangement of a non-canonical RNP domain and an LRR domain.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5587-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, no structure of the RRM domains of human hnRNP L has been reported, and how they individually or together bind to RNA is unknown. In this paper, we investigated the RNA-binding affinities of different constructs of hnRNP L and determined the crystal structures of RRM1 and RRM34. We used site-directed mutagenesis and SPR assays to map the binding surface between hnRNP L and CA repeats. In vitro studies using different RNAs suggested an RNA-looping mechanism for hnRNP L splicing regulation. In addition, we propose models for how hnRNP L functions as an alternative splicing regulator with dual roles and suggest the possibility of hnRNP L-mediated recruitment of other factors without direct interactions. cDNAs encoding different fragments of hnRNP L FLΔN(32–589), RRMN1(32–180), RRM1(90–180), RRM2(177–295), RRM12(32–295), and RRM34(380–589) were PCR-amplified from the pET-30a/hnRNP L(32–589) plasmid, a gift from Dr. Zhu Bing (12.Yuan W.

PCR products were digested with restriction endonucleases NdeI and XhoI and ligated into a modified pET-28a(+) plasmid lacking the thrombin cleavage site. Mutations were generated with a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the manufacturer's protocol. Recombinant plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Invitrogen) and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) (Novagen) to produce target proteins as N-terminal His6 fusions. E. coli cells were cultured in LB medium at 310 K with 50 mg/liter kanamycin until the A600 reached 0.8–1.2, after which bacteria were induced with 0.25 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 289 K for 20 h. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5), and lysed by ultrasonication. Cell extracts were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 277 K. Supernatants were purified with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate affinity resin (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. Eluted proteins were concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration (Amicon Ultra-15, 3-kDa molecular mass cutoff, Millipore), loaded onto a pre-equilibrated HiLoadTM 16/60 SuperdexTM 75-pg column or a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) in an Äkta-System (GE Healthcare), eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with the same buffer, and collected in 1.2-ml fractions. Peak fractions were analyzed by Tricine/SDS-PAGE (15%, w/v) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Purified fractions were pooled together and concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration. The concentration was determined by A280. For crystallization, RRM1(90–180) was dialyzed against buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5) and concentrated to 40 mg/ml. RRM34(380–589) was further purified by HiTrap Q FF (5 ml) ion exchange chromatography (GE Healthcare). The final protein in buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) was concentrated to 39 mg/ml for crystallization trials. hnRNP L RRM1(90–180) was crystallized using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method by mixing 1 μl of protein solution and 1 μl of reservoir solution at 287 K. The crystal suitable for x-ray diffraction was grown in reservoir solution consisting of 0.1 m HEPES and 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3,350, pH 7.5 (Hampton Research). Data collection was performed at 100 K with cryoprotectant solution (reservoir solution supplemented with an additional 20% (v/v) glycerol). Diffraction data were collected in-house to 2.0-Å resolution using a Rigaku RU-H3R generator and a Mar345 detector. For hnRNP L RRM34(380–589), the crystal suitable for x-ray diffraction was grown in reservoir solution containing 30% (v/v) pentaerythritol ethoxylate (15:4 EO/OH), 50 mm ammonium sulfate, and 50 mm BisTris, pH 6.5 (Hampton Research). Diffraction data were collected at beamline BL17U of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) at 100 K with cryoprotectant solution (reservoir solution with 20% (v/v) glycerol). For hnRNP L RRM1(90–180), the diffraction data set was processed using iMOSFLM (25.Leslie A.G. The integration of macromolecular diffraction data.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Ramachandran analysis showed that, similarly to hnRNP L RRM1, 95.1% of the residues were in the most favored region, with 4.9% in the additionally allowed region. The qualities of these structures were checked using the program MolProbity (33.Davis I.W. Leaver-Fay A. Chen V.B. Block J.N. Kapral G.J. Wang X. Murray L.W. Arendall 3rd, W.B. Snoeyink J.

Open table in a new tab SPR spectroscopy was carried out using a BIAcore 3000 (GE Healthcare). RNA segments of 21 (CA) repeats biotinylated at the 3′-end were immobilized on an SA chip. For kinetic analysis, proteins were passed over the chip at different concentrations in RNase-free running buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) and washed with 0.17% SDS (w/v). SPR assays were performed at 298 K. Data were analyzed with BIAevaluation version 4.1 software (Biacore Life Sciences). Protein-RNA interactions were evaluated by EMSA. For FRET-EMSA, 12 pmol of doubly labeled RNAs (Takara) were mixed with 48 pmol or decreased amounts of hnRNP L RRM34 and incubated on ice for 30 min. Complexes were resolved on a 9% native polyacrylamide gel at a constant voltage of 6 V/cm at 277 K in 50 mm Tris acetate, 50 mm potassium acetate, pH 8.0. After electrophoresis, the gel was scanned with an LAS-4000 (GE Healthcare) excited with a 490-nm laser. The donor emission was defined as green and the acceptor emission as red (34.Rueda D. Wick K. McDowell S.E. Walter N.G. Diffusely bound Mg2+ ions slightly reorient stems I and II of the hammerhead ribozyme to increase the probability of formation of the catalytic core.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9924-9936Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For EMSA of hnRNP L RRM34 with 34-nt RNA, the concentration of 34-nt was 40 μm, whereas concentrations of hnRNP L RRM34 ranged from 0 to 160 μm. The gel was visualized with toluidine. Steady-state FRET measurements of doubly labeled RNAs were carried out in a spectrofluorometer. The excitation wavelength was 490 nm (5-nm bandwidth). For quantitative measurement of the FRET efficiency, the donor and acceptor emissions were measured at 520 and 580 nm, respectively. The FRET efficiency was calculated as I580/(I580 + I520), where I represents the intensity. The global dissociation constant (KD) was obtained by plotting FRET efficiency as a function of [hnRNP L RRM34], and fitting the curve to the modified Hill equation: FRET = FRET0 + (FRETmax − FRET0) [protein]n/(KDn + [protein]n). Cross-linking assays were carried out using disuccinimidyl suberate (Sigma). The reaction buffer contained 50 mm HEPES, 300 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol, pH 7.5. hnRNP L RRM34 (∼1 mg/ml) was added with an equimolar amount of double-labeled RNA and incubated on ice for 30 min. A reaction containing protein only without RNA was carried out for comparison. Disuccinimidyl suberate dissolved in DMSO was added to reactions at the molar ratio of 1 hnRNP L RRM34, 20 disuccinimidyl suberate. Mixtures were incubated on ice for another 30 min before quenching with 1 m Tris, pH 8.0. Reactions were directly analyzed by SDS-PAGE after quenching for 15 min at room temperature. Protein bands were visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Bio-Rad). RNA bands were visualized using LAS-4000 (GE Healthcare). Dynamic light scattering assays were performed in a DynaPro-MS800 (ATC) at 298 K with buffer (20 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). hnRNP L RRM34 (∼0.5 mg/ml) was added with an equimolar amount of RNA and incubated for 30 min before measurements. Protein without RNA was also measured for comparison. ITC measurements were performed with an iTC200 (Microcal) calorimeter at 298 K. Protein samples were dialyzed in buffer (25 mm HEPES, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). The concentration of 34-nt RNA in the syringe was 300 μm. Protein concentration in the cell (200 μl volume) was 15 μm. Data were analyzed according to a single-site binding model with Microcal ORIGIN software. Previous studies indicated that hnRNP L binds specifically to both CA-repeat and CA-rich elements (16.Hui J. Hung L.H. Heiner M. Schreiner S. Neumüller N. Reither G. Haas S.A. Bindereif A.

However, the RNA-binding property of hnRNP L has not been addressed. To elucidate the RNA-binding property of individual and multiple RRMs of hnRNP L, we purified various constructs of hnRNP L for SPR studies (Fig. 1B). Also, we attempted to generate individual RRM3 and RRM4, but these constructs were insoluble. Notably, the construct FLΔN (32–589 amino acids), lacking the N-terminal 31 amino acids, is usually regarded as full-length hnRNP L (4.Hung L.H. Heiner M. Hui J. Schreiner S. Benes V. Bindereif A.

For these reasons, a 21-copy CA repeat construct was chosen as the immobilized RNA substrate. As shown in Table 1, FLΔN showed the strongest RNA-binding ability (KD = 1.2 ± 0.1 nm). The C-terminal tandem domains RRM34 showed strong RNA-binding ability (KD = 22 ± 1 nm), although it was 17-fold weaker than that of FLΔN. The individual RRM, especially RRM1, showed almost no RNA binding activity. Interestingly, with the addition of 58 N-terminal amino acids, RRMN1(32–180) showed weak RNA-binding ability (KD = 10 ± 1 μm), which was 19-fold weaker than that of RRM2 (KD = 0.50 ± 0.06 μm). RRMN1 and RRM2 were arranged in cis as RRMN12, which showed moderately strong RNA-binding ability (KD = 0.14 ± 0.01 μm). These results indicated that both the C- and N-terminal parts of hnRNP L contribute to RNA binding, but RRM34 showed six times the binding capability of RRMN12. Furthermore, when the individual RRM (RRMN1 and RRM2) or tandem RRM domains (RRMN12 and RRM34) were tethered together on a single polypeptide, the affinities for RNA increased extensively. Although these values were 1,000-fold less than the product of the affinities of the component RRMs (36.Sham"
https://openalex.org/W2068548865,"Tooth enamel, the hardest tissue in the body, is formed by the evolutionarily highly conserved biomineralization process that is controlled by extracellular matrix proteins. The intrinsically disordered matrix protein ameloblastin (AMBN) is the most abundant nonamelogenin protein of the developing enamel and a key element for correct enamel formation. AMBN was suggested to be a cell adhesion molecule that regulates proliferation and differentiation of ameloblasts. Nevertheless, detailed structural and functional studies on AMBN have been substantially limited by the paucity of the purified nondegraded protein. With this study, we have developed a procedure for production of a highly purified form of recombinant human AMBN in quantities that allowed its structural characterization. Using size exclusion chromatography, analytical ultracentrifugation, transmission electron, and atomic force microscopy techniques, we show that AMBN self-associates into ribbon-like supramolecular structures with average widths and thicknesses of 18 and 0.34 nm, respectively. The AMBN ribbons exhibited lengths ranging from tens to hundreds of nm. Deletion analysis and NMR spectroscopy revealed that an N-terminal segment encoded by exon 5 comprises two short independently structured regions and plays a key role in self-assembly of AMBN."

Mg2+ limitation, acidic pH, and the presence of cationic antimicrobial peptides have been identified as cues that the sensor protein PhoQ can monitor to reprogram Salmonella gene expression to cope with extra- or intracellular challenging conditions. In this work, we show for the first time that long chain unsaturated free fatty acids (LCUFAs) present in Salmonella growth medium are signals specifically detected by PhoQ. We demonstrate that LCUFAs inhibit PhoQ autokinase activity, turning off the expression of the PhoP-dependent regulon. We also show that LCUFAs exert their action independently of their cellular uptake and metabolic utilization by means of the β-oxidative pathway. Our findings put forth the complexity of input signals that can converge to finely tune the activity of the PhoP/PhoQ system. In addition, they provide a new potential biochemical platform for the development of antibacterial strategies to fight against Salmonella infections.Background: The PhoP/PhoQ system governs crucial Salmonella typhimurium pathogenic traits.Results: A screening of natural compounds showed that long chain fatty acids present in the bacterial growth medium down-regulate the PhoP/PhoQ-dependent regulon.Conclusion: Long chain unsaturated fatty acids specifically inhibit PhoQ autokinase activity.Significance: The novel PhoQ input signal reveals a new scenario for the control of Salmonella virulence, providing a rationale for future antibacterial strategies.

https://openalex.org/W2007635524,"The progressive deterioration of the neuromuscular axis is typically observed in degenerative conditions of the lower motor neurons, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Neurodegeneration in this disease is associated with systemic metabolic perturbations, including hypermetabolism and dyslipidemia. Our previous gene profiling studies on ALS muscle revealed down-regulation of delta-9 desaturase, or SCD1, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids. Interestingly, knocking out SCD1 gene is known to induce hypermetabolism and stimulate fatty acid beta-oxidation. Here we investigated whether SCD1 deficiency can affect muscle function and its restoration in response to injury. The genetic ablation of SCD1 was not detrimental per se to muscle function. On the contrary, muscles in SCD1 knockout mice shifted toward a more oxidative metabolism, and enhanced the expression of synaptic genes. Repressing SCD1 expression or reducing SCD-dependent enzymatic activity accelerated the recovery of muscle function after inducing sciatic nerve crush. Overall, these findings provide evidence for a new role of SCD1 in modulating the restorative potential of skeletal muscles."

Finally, we performed a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) with OCB status on a subset of 562 patients. The best associated SNPs of the Italian GWAS were replicated in silico in Scandinavian and Belgian populations, and meta-analyzed.HLA-DRB1*15 is associated with OCB+: p = 0.03, Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.6, 95% Confidence Limits (CL) = 1.1-2.4.

https://openalex.org/W2023767567,"The study of uterine leiomyomata (fibroids) provides a unique opportunity to investigate the physiological and molecular determinants of hormone dependent tumor growth and spontaneous tumor regression. We conducted a longitudinal clinical study of premenopausal women with leiomyoma that showed significantly different growth rates between white and black women depending on their age. Growth rates for leiomyoma were on average much higher from older black women than for older white women, and we now report gene expression pattern differences in tumors from these two groups of study participants. Total RNA from 52 leiomyoma and 8 myometrial samples were analyzed using Affymetrix Gene Chip expression arrays. Gene expression data was first compared between all leiomyoma and normal myometrium and then between leiomyoma from older black women (age 35 or older) and from older white women. Genes that were found significant in pairwise comparisons were further analyzed for canonical pathways, networks and biological functions using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. Whereas our comparison of leiomyoma to myometrium produced a very large list of genes highly similar to numerous previous studies, distinct sets of genes and signaling pathways were identified in comparisons of older black and white women whose tumors were likely to be growing and non-growing, respectively. Key among these were genes associated with regulation of apoptosis. To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare two groups of tumors that are likely to have different growth rates in order to reveal molecular signals likely to be influential in tumor growth."

We developed a robust method for building a Combinatorial Library of Improved Peptide aptamers (CLIPs) of high complexity, containing ≥3×1010 independent clones, to be used as a molecular tool in the study of biological pathways. The Thioredoxin scaffold was modified to increase solubility and eliminate aggregation of the peptide aptamers. The CLIPs was used in a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify peptide aptamers that bind to various domains of the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End products (RAGE). NMR spectroscopy was used to identify interaction surfaces between the peptide aptamers and RAGE domains. Cellular functional assays revealed that in addition to directly interfering with known binding sites, peptide aptamer binding distal to ligand sites also inhibits RAGE ligand-induced signal transduction. This finding underscores the potential of using CLIPs to select allosteric inhibitors of biological targets."
https://openalex.org/W2057765497,"Unipolar brush cells (UBCs) are excitatory interneurons found in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) and the granule cell layer of cerebellar cortex, being particularly evident in the paraflocculus (PFL) and flocculus (FL). UBCs receive glutamatergic inputs and make glutamatergic synapses with granule cells and other UBCs. It has been hypothesized that UBCs comprise local networks of tunable feed-forward amplifiers. In the DCN they might also participate in feed-back amplification of signals from higher auditory centers. Recently it has been shown that UBCs, in the vestibulocerebellum and DCN of adult rats, express doublecortin (DCX), previously considered a marker of newborn and migrating neurons. In an animal model, both the DCN, and more recently the PFL, have been implicated in contributing to the sensation of acoustic-exposure-induced tinnitus. These studies support the working hypothesis that tinnitus emerges after loss of peripheral sensitivity because inhibitory processes homeostatically down regulate, and excitatory processes up regulate. Here we report the results of two sequential experiments that examine the potential role of DCN and cerebellar UBCs in tinnitus, and the contribution of glutamatergic transmission in the PFL. In Experiment 1 it was shown that adult rats with psychophysical evidence of tinnitus induced by a single unilateral high-level noise exposure, had elevated DCX in the DCN and ventral PFL. In Experiment 2 it was shown that micro-quantities of glutamatergic antagonists, delivered directly to the PFL, reversibly reduced chronically established tinnitus, while similarly applied glutamatergic agonists induced tinnitus-like behavior in non-tinnitus controls. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that UBC up regulation and enhanced glutamatergic transmission in the cerebellum contribute to the pathophysiology of tinnitus."

Maternal obesity can exacerbate this “resistance,” suggesting that CS, GH-V, or transcription factors that regulate their production might be targets. The human CS genes, hCS-A and hCS-B, flank the GH-V gene. A significant decrease in pre-term placental CS/GH-V RNA levels was observed in transgenic mice containing the CS/GH-V genes in a model of high fat diet (HFD)-induced maternal obesity. Similarly, a decrease in CS/GH-V RNA levels was detected in term placentas from obese (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 35 kg/m2) versus lean (BMI 20–25 kg/m2) women. A specific decrease in transcription factor CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) RNA levels was also seen with obesity; C/EBPβ is required for mouse placenta development and is expressed, like CS and GH-V, in syncytiotrophoblasts.

https://openalex.org/W2020771979,"Background A potential role for coagulation factors in pulmonary arterial hypertension has been recently described, but the mechanism of action is currently not known. Here, we investigated the interactions between thrombin and the nitric oxide-cGMP pathway in pulmonary endothelial cells and experimental pulmonary hypertension. Principal Findings Chronic treatment with the selective thrombin inhibitor melagatran (0.9 mg/kg daily via implanted minipumps) reduced right ventricular hypertrophy in the rat monocrotaline model of experimental pulmonary hypertension. In vitro, thrombin was found to have biphasic effects on key regulators of the nitric oxide-cGMP pathway in endothelial cells (HUVECs). Acute thrombin stimulation led to increased expression of the cGMP-elevating factors endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) subunits, leading to increased cGMP levels. By contrast, prolonged exposition of pulmonary endothelial cells to thrombin revealed a characteristic pattern of differential expression of the key regulators of the nitric oxide-cGMP pathway, in which specifically the factors contributing to cGMP elevation (eNOS and sGC) were reduced and the cGMP-hydrolyzing PDE5 was elevated (qPCR and Western blot). In line with the differential expression of key regulators of the nitric oxide-cGMP pathway, a reduction of cGMP by prolonged thrombin stimulation was found. The effects of prolonged thrombin exposure were confirmed in endothelial cells of pulmonary origin (HPAECs and HPMECs). Similar effects could be induced by activation of protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1). Conclusion These findings suggest a link between thrombin generation and cGMP depletion in lung endothelial cells through negative regulation of the nitric oxide-cGMP pathway, possibly mediated via PAR-1, which could be of relevance in pulmonary arterial hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W1985336429,"Background The effectiveness of molecular targeted agents is modest in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Efficacy of molecular targeted therapies has been better in cancer patients with high expression of actionable molecules defined as cognate target molecules. However, patient stratification based on the actionable molecules dictating the effectiveness of targeted drugs has remained understudied in HCC. Experimental Design & Results Paired tumor and non-tumoral tissues derived from a total of 130 HCC patients were studied. Real-time RT-PCR was used to analyze the mRNA expression of actionable molecules in the tissues. mRNA levels of EGFR, VEGFR2, PDGFRβ, FGFR1, and mTOR were up-regulated in tumors compared to non-tumors in 35.4, 42.3, 61.5, 24.6, and 50.0% of patients, respectively. Up-regulation of EGFR was observed at early stage and tended to gradually decrease toward late stages (BCLC stage A: 41.9%; B: 30.8%; C: 17.6%). Frequency of VEGFR2 expression in tumors at stage C was lower than that in the other stages (BCLC stage A: 45.9%; B: 41.0%; C: 29.4%). PDGFRβ and mTOR were observed to be up-regulated in more than 50% of tumors in all the stages whereas FGFR1 was up-regulated in only about 20% of HCC irrespective of stages. A cluster analysis of actionable gene expression revealed that HCC can be categorized into different subtypes that predict the effectiveness of molecular targeted agents and combination therapies in clinical trials. Analysis of in vitro sensitivity to sorafenib demonstrated that HCC cells with up-regulation of PDGFRβ and c-Raf mRNA are more susceptible to sorafenib treatment in a dose and time-dependent manner than cells with low expression of the genes. Conclusions mRNA expression analysis of actionable molecules could provide the rationale for new companion diagnostics-based therapeutic strategies in the treatment of HCC."

This study investigated the prevalence of computed tomography (CT) quantified emphysema, airway wall thickening and gas trapping according to classification of airflow limitation (FEV1/FVC <70% and/or < the lower limit of normal (LLN)) in (heavy) smokers. Methods A total number of 1,140 male former and current smokers participating in a lung cancer screenings trial (NELSON) were included and underwent chest CT scanning and spirometry. Emphysema was quantified by the 15th percentile, air way wall thickening by the square root of wall area for a theoretical airway with 10mm lumen perimeter (Pi10) and gas trapping by the mean lung density expiratory/inspiratory (E/I)-ratio. Participants were classified by entry FEV1/FVC: group 1>70%; group 2<70% but >LLN; and group 3<LLN. 32 restricted subjects, i.e. FEV1/FVC >70% but FEV1 <80% predicted, were excluded. Multivariate regression analysis correcting for covariates was used to asses the extent of emphysema, airway wall thickening and gas trapping according to three groups of airflow limitation. Results Mean (standard deviation) age was 62.5 (5.2) years and packyears smoked was 41.0 (18.0). Group 2 subjects when compared to group 1 had a significantly lower 15th percentile, −920.6 HU versus −912.2 HU; a higher Pi10, 2.87 mm versus 2.57 mm; and a higher E/I-ratio, 88.6% versus 85.6% (all p<0.001). Conclusion Subjects with an FEV1/FVC<70%, but above the LLN, have a significant greater degree of structural lung changes on CT compared to subjects without airflow limitation."
https://openalex.org/W1980655297,"White-throated sparrows increase fat deposits during pre-migratory periods and rely on these fat stores to fuel migration. Adipose tissue produces hormones and signaling factors in a rhythmic fashion and may be controlled by a clock in adipose tissue or driven by a master clock in the brain. The master clock may convey photoperiodic information from the environment to adipose tissue to facilitate pre-migratory fattening, and adipose tissue may, in turn, release adipokines to indicate the extent of fat energy stores. Here, we present evidence that a change in signal from the adipokines adiponectin and visfatin may act to indicate body condition, thereby influencing an individual's decision to commence migratory flight, or to delay until adequate fat stores are acquired. We quantified plasma adiponectin and visfatin levels across the day in captive birds held under constant photoperiod. The circadian profiles of plasma adiponectin in non-migrating birds were approximately inverse the profiles from migrating birds. Adiponectin levels were positively correlated to body fat, and body fat was inversely related to the appearance of nocturnal migratory restlessness. Visfatin levels were constant across the day and did not correlate with fat deposits; however, a reduction in plasma visfatin concentration occurred during the migratory period. The data suggest that a significant change in the biological control of adipokine expression exists between the two migratory conditions and we propose a role for adiponectin, visfatin and adipose clocks in the regulation of migratory behaviors."

https://openalex.org/W2048321740,"CCAAT box/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) is a bZip transcription factor that plays crucial roles in important cellular processes such as differentiation and proliferation of specific cell types. Previously, we showed that C/EBPβ cooperates with the coactivator p300 through a novel mechanism that involves the C/EBPβ-induced phosphorylation of multiple sites in the carboxyl-terminal domain of p300 by protein kinase Hipk2. We have now examined the interaction and cooperation of C/EBPβ, p300, and Hipk2 in more detail. We show that Hipk2 and C/EBPβ are direct physical binding partners whose interaction is mediated by sequences located in the amino-terminal and central domains of Hipk2 and the amino-terminal part of C/EBPβ. In addition to phosphorylating p300 recruited to C/EBPβ, Hipk2 also phosphorylates C/EBPβ at sites that have previously been shown to plays key roles in the regulation of C/EBPβ activity. Silencing of Hipk2 expression disrupts adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, a physiological C/EBPβ-dependent differentiation process indicating that the cooperation of C/EBPβ and Hipk2 is functionally relevant. Finally, we demonstrate that C/EBPα, a related C/EBP family member whose amino-terminal sequences differ significantly from that of C/EBPβ, is unable to interact and cooperate with Hipk2. Instead, our data suggest that C/EBPα cooperates with the protein kinase Jnk to induce phosphorylation of p300. Overall, our data identify Hipk2 as a novel regulator of C/EBPβ and implicate different protein kinases in the cooperation of p300 with C/EBPβ and C/EBPα."
https://openalex.org/W1970104094,"Involvement of CD4+ helper T (Th) cells is crucial for CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immunity. However, CD4+ Th’s signals that govern CTL survival and functional memory are still not completely understood. In this study, we assessed the role of CD4+ Th cells with acquired antigen-presenting machineries in determining CTL fates. We utilized an adoptive co-transfer into CD4+ T cell-sufficient or -deficient mice of OTI CTLs and OTII Th cells or Th cells with various gene deficiencies pre-stimulated in vitro by ovalbumin (OVA)-pulsed dendritic cell (DCova). CTL survival was kinetically assessed in these mice using FITC-anti-CD8 and PE-H-2Kb/OVA257-264 tetramer staining by flow cytometry. We show that by acting via endogenous CD40L and IL-2, and acquired peptide-MHC-I (pMHC-I) complex signaling, CD4+ Th cells enhance survival of transferred effector CTLs and their differentiation into the functional memory CTLs capable of protecting against highly-metastasizing tumor challenge. Moreover, RT-PCR, flow cytometry and Western blot analysis demonstrate that increased survival of CD4+ Th cell-helped CTLs is matched with enhanced Akt1/NF-κB activation, down-regulation of TRAIL, and altered expression profiles with up-regulation of prosurvival (Bcl-2) and down-regulation of proapoptotic (Bcl-10, Casp-3, Casp-4, Casp-7) molecules. Taken together, our results reveal a previously unexplored mechanistic role for CD4+ Th cells in programming CTL survival and memory recall responses. This knowledge could also aid in the development of efficient adoptive CTL cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2068283932,"Diabetes can exacerbate seizures and worsen seizure-related brain damage. In the present study, we aimed to determine whether the standard antiepileptic drug pregabalin (PGB) protects against pilocarpine-induced seizures and excitotoxicity in diabetes. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into either a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes group or a normal saline (NS) group. Both groups were further divided into subgroups that were treated intravenously with either PGB (15 mg/kg) or a vehicle; all groups were treated with subcutaneous pilocarpine (60 mg/kg) to induce seizures. To evaluate spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS), PGB-pretreated rats were fed rat chow containing oral PGB (450 mg) for 28 consecutive days; vehicle-pretreated rats were fed regular chow. SRS frequency was monitored for 2 weeks from post-status epilepticus day 15. We evaluated both acute neuronal loss and chronic mossy fiber sprouting in the CA3 area. In addition, we performed patch clamp recordings to study evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs) in hippocampal CA1 neurons for both vehicle-treated rats with SRS. Finally, we used an RNA interference knockdown method for Kir6.2 in a hippocampal cell line to evaluate PGB's effects in the presence of high-dose ATP. We found that compared to vehicle-treated rats, PGB-treated rats showed less severe acute seizure activity, reduced acute neuronal loss, and chronic mossy fiber sprouting. In the vehicle-treated STZ rats, eEPSC amplitude was significantly lower after PGB administration, but glibenclamide reversed this effect. The RNA interference study confirmed that PGB could counteract the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KATP)-closing effect of high-dose ATP. By opening KATP, PGB protects against neuronal excitotoxicity, and is therefore a potential antiepileptogenic in diabetes. These findings might help develop a clinical algorithm for treating patients with epilepsy and comorbid metabolic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2049491037,"De novo tumors (DNT) after liver transplantation (LT) represent a growing concern.We analyzed the incidence of DNT, type, time of onset, risk factors and mortality (as of 2010) in 494 adult patients transplanted in the last 26 years (1983-2009).DNT occurred in 41 (8.3%) of the patients. The Standardized Incidence Ratio (SIR) compared with the Italian population was 1.8. There was a higher incidence in males (SIR 2.0), an expected extremely high rate of Kaposi's sarcoma (SIR 127.95) and unexpected higher rates of tumors of the bladder in males (SIR 3.3). The incidence of DNT was higher within the first two years of LT (SIR 2.7) for Kaposi's sarcoma (SIR 393.3) and after 10 years (SIR 1.7) for bladder tumors (SIR 10.6). Multivariate analysis identified alcoholic cirrhosis (HR = 3.0, 95% CI = 1.2-7.8) and sclerosing cholangitis (HR = 3.5, 95% CI = 1.1-11.3) in the recipient as main risk factors for the occurrence of DNT.Surveillance protocols for DNT must be specifically oriented to patients transplanted for alcoholic cirrhosis and sclerosing cholangitis. They should focus on early detection of Kaposi's sarcomas, and more remarkably, on late development bladder tumors in men after LT."
https://openalex.org/W2021980379,"In people with chronic illnesses, self-management education can reduce anxiety and depression. Those benefits, however, decay over time. Efforts have been made to prevent or minimize that ""decay of impact"", but they have not been based on information about the decay's characteristics, and they have failed. Here we show how the decay's basic characteristics (prevalence, timing, and magnitude) can be quantified. Regarding anxiety and depression, we also report the prevalence, timing, and magnitude of the decay.Adults with various chronic conditions participated in a self-management educational program (n = 369). Data were collected with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale four times over one year. Using within-person effect sizes, we defined decay of impact as a decline of ≥0.5 standard deviations after improvement by at least the same amount. We also interpret the results using previously-set criteria for non-cases, possible cases, and probable cases.Prevalence: On anxiety, decay occurred in 19% of the participants (70/369), and on depression it occurred in 24% (90/369). Timing: In about one third of those with decay, it began 3 months after the baseline measurement (6 weeks after the educational program ended). Magnitude: The median magnitudes of decay on anxiety and on depression were both 4 points, which was about 1 standard deviation. Early in the follow-up year, many participants with decay moved into less severe clinical categories (e.g., becoming non-cases). Later, many of them moved into more severe categories (e.g., becoming probable cases).Decay of impact can be identified and quantified from within-person effect sizes. This decay occurs in about one fifth or more of this program's participants. It can start soon after the program ends, and it is large enough to be clinically important. These findings can be used to plan interventions aimed at preventing or minimizing the decay of impact."
https://openalex.org/W2113214899,"The humoral Idiotypic Network consisting of antibodies and their anti-idiotypic antibodies (anti-Id) can be temporarily upset by antigen exposure. In the healthy immune response the original equilibrium is eventually restored through counter-regulatory mechanisms. In certain autoimmune diseases however, autoantibody levels exceed those of their respective anti-Id, indicating a permanent disturbance in the respective humoral Idiotypic Network. We investigated anti-Id directed to a major Type 1 diabetes (T1D)-associated autoantibody (GAD65Ab) in two independent cohorts during progression to disease. Samples taken from participants of the Natural History Study showed significantly lower anti-Id levels in individuals that later progressed to T1D compared to non-progressors (anti-Id antibody index of 0.06 vs. 0.08, respectively, p = 0.02). We also observed a significant inverse correlation between anti-Id levels and age at sampling, but only in progressors (p = 0.014). Finally, anti-Id levels in progressors showed a significant decline during progression as compared to longitudinal anti-Id levels in non-progressors (median rate of change: -0.0004 vs. +0.0004, respectively, p = 0.003), suggesting a loss of anti-Id during progression. Our analysis of the Diabetes Prediction in Skåne cohort showed that early in life (age 2) individuals at risk have anti-Id levels indistinguishable from those in healthy controls, indicating that low anti-Id levels are not an innate characteristic of the immune response in individuals at risk. Notably, anti-Id levels declined significantly in individuals that later developed GAD65Ab suggesting that the decline in anti-Id levels precedes the emergence of GAD65Ab (median rate of change: -0.005) compared to matched controls (median rate of change: +0.001) (p = 0.0016). We conclude that while anti-Id are present early in life, their levels decrease prior to the appearance of GAD65Ab and to the development of T1D."
https://openalex.org/W2112153650,"EhCaBP1, one of the calcium-binding proteins from Entamoeba histolytica, is a two-domain EF-hand protein. The two domains of EhCaBP1 are structurally and functionally different from each other. However, both domains are required for structural stability and a full range of functional diversity. Analysis of sequence and structure of EhCaBP1 and other CaBPs indicates that the C-terminal domain of EhCaBP1 possesses a unique structure compared with other family members. This had been attributed to the absence of a Phe-Phe interaction between highly conserved Phe residues at the -4 position in EF-hand III (F[-4]; Tyr(81)) and at the 13th position in EF-hand IV (F[+13]; Phe(129)) of the C-terminal domain. Against this backdrop, we mutated the Tyr residue at the -4th position of EF III to the Phe residue (Y81F), to bring in the Phe-Phe interaction and understand the nature of structural and functional changes in the protein by NMR spectroscopy, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and biological assays, such as imaging and actin binding. The Y81F mutation in EhCaBP1 resulted in a more compact structure for the C-terminal domain of the mutant as in the case of calmodulin and troponin C. The compact structure is favored by the presence of a π-π interaction between Phe(81) and Phe(129) along with several hydrophobic interactions of Phe(81), which are not seen in the wild-type protein. Furthermore, the biological assays reveal preferential membrane localization of the mutant, loss of its colocalization with actin in the phagocytic cups, whereas retaining its ability to bind G- and F-actin."
https://openalex.org/W2068009864,"To compare the analytical methods used to study the pharmacokinetics of recombinant hirudin in the plasma of rats that had been injected with (125)I-recombinant hirudin.2.0 mg/kg (125)I-recombinant hirudin were injected intravenously into rats. The recombinant hirudins in the plasma was analyzed by chromogenic substrate assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), total radioisotope assay (RA) and trichloroacetic acid pre-treated total radioisotope assay (TCA-RA).The chromogenic substrate assay standard curve was linear over the concentration range from 3.12 to 40.00 ng/ml for the recombinant hirudin in plasma. The relative standard deviations (RSD) for the intra- and inter-day variation were 5.0 to 6.3% and 11.9 to 12.6%, respectively. The recoveries of recombinant hirudin was 89.8% to 100.7%. The limit of quantification (LOQ) was 3.12 ng/ml. The concentration-time curve of the recombinant hirudin in the plasma could be explained as a two-compartment model. Pharmacokinetic parameters, including the half-life of distribution phase (t1/2 α), the half-life of elimination phase (t1/2 β), volume of apparent distribution (Vd), and area under the concentration-time curve from zero to infinite time (AUC0-t) were 7.59 min, 46.99 min, 0.17 L/kg, and 204.5 mg/L/min, respectively, as determined by chromogenic substrate assay; 6.41 min, 47.28 min, 1.24 L/kg, and 575.18 mg/L/min, respectively, as determined by ELISA; 3.69 min, 701.90 min, 0.04 L/kg, and 4189 mg/L/min, respectively as determined by RA; and 4.57 min, 724.9 min, 0.09 L/kg, and 2329 mg/L/min, respectively, as determined by TCA-RA.The chromogenic substrate assay on the concentration dynamics of the recombinant hirudin in the plasma is a specific, sensitive, and accurate analytical method for pharmacokinetic studies. Moreover, the pharmacokinetic parameters determined by the chromogenic substrate assay and ELISA are congruent except for AUC."
https://openalex.org/W2120662618,"Background Evidence shows that STON2 gene is associated with synaptic function and schizophrenia. This study aims to explore the relationship between two functional polymorphisms (Ser307Pro and Ala851Ser) of STON2 gene and the cortical surface area in first-episode treatment-naïve patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. Methodology/Principal Findings Magnetic resonance imaging of the whole cortical surface area, which was computed by an automated surface-based technique (FreeSurfer), was obtained from 74 first-episode treatment-naïve patients with schizophrenia and 55 healthy controls. Multiple regression analysis was performed to investigate the effect of genotype subgroups on the cortical surface area. A significant genotype-by-diagnosis effect on the cortical surface area was observed. Pro-allele carriers of Ser307Pro polymorphism had larger right inferior temporal surface area than Ser/Ser carriers in the patients with schizophrenia; however, no significant difference was found in the same area in the healthy controls. The Ala851Ser polymorphism of STON2 gene was not significantly associated with the cortical surface area in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. Conclusions/Significance The present study demonstrated that the functional variant of the STON2 gene could alter cortical surface area on the right inferior temporal and contribute to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia."

https://openalex.org/W2064159737,"Vitamin B12, a co-factor in methyl-group transfer, is important in maintaining DNA (deoxycytidine) methylation. Using two independent assays we examined the effect of vitamin B12-deficiency (plasma vitamin B12<148 pmol/L) on DNA methylation in women of childbearing age. Coagulated blood clot DNA from vitamin B12-deficient women had significantly (p<0.001) lower percentage deoxycytidine methylation (3.23±0.66%; n = 248) and greater [3 H]methyl-acceptance (42,859±9,699 cpm; n = 17) than DNA from B12-replete women (4.44±0.18%; n = 128 and 26,049±2,814 cpm; n = 11) [correlation between assays: r = –0.8538; p<0.001; n = 28]. In contrast, uncoagulated EDTA-blood cell pellet DNA from vitamin B12-deficient and B12-replete women exhibited similar percentage methylation (4.45±0.15%; n = 77 vs. 4.47±0.15%; n = 47) and [3 H]methyl-acceptance (27,378±4,094 cpm; n = 17 vs. 26,610±2,292 cpm; n = 11). Therefore, in simultaneously collected paired blood samples, vitamin B12-deficiency was associated with decreased DNA methylation only in coagulated samples. These findings highlight the importance of sample collection methods in epigenetic studies, and the potential impact biological processes can have on DNA methylation during collection."
