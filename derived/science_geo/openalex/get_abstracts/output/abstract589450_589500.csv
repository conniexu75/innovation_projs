For each user, though, a device will need to be adjusted for optimum effect, which can be time-consuming. Zhang et al. show that the human can be included in the optimization process, with real-time adaptation of an ankle exoskeleton (see the Perspective by Malcolm et al. ). By using indirect calorimetry to measure metabolic rates, the authors were able to adjust the torque provided by the device while users were walking, running, and carrying a load.

https://openalex.org/W2693790197,"Resonant systems with high bandwidth The performance of an active system, whether it is optical, electrical, or mechanical, is often described by its quality ( Q ) factor. Typically, one learns the rule that the higher the Q factor, the sharper the resonance—that is, the bandwidth of the device is reduced. Tsakmakidis et al. show that this is indeed the case, but only for symmetric systems. However, for the case of asymmetric (or nonreciprocal) systems, the rule need not be obeyed. They show theoretically that the more asymmetric a system with high Q is, the wider the bandwidth can be. The effect raises the prospect of designing high- Q devices operating over large bandwidths.

They are specialized subcellular compartments for colocalizing enzymes to enhance reaction rates, protect sensitive proteins, and sequester toxic intermediates. Sutter et al. determined the atomic-resolution structure of a complete 6.5-megadalton bacterial microcompartment shell. The shell is composed of hundreds of copies of five distinct proteins that form hexamers, pentamers, and three types of trimers. The assembly principles revealed by the structure provide the basis to rationally manipulate self-assembly in native and engineered systems and could help, for example, in the design of subcellular nanoreactors.

https://openalex.org/W2674118028,"PKA-activation mechanism revised Many hormone receptors stimulate production of cyclic AMP (adenosine monophosphate), which activates PKA (protein kinase A). The textbook view suggests that activation releases the catalytic subunit of the enzyme from its complex with the regulatory subunit. Smith et al. closely monitored activation of PKA in cultured human cells and found that dissociation of the holoenzyme was not necessary for activation. The kinase, which binds anchoring proteins that localize it in the cell, appears to be restricted to acting within about 200 Å of such anchoring proteins. Thus, PKA activity is more precisely targeted within the cell than previously anticipated. Science , this issue p. 1288"
https://openalex.org/W2344161603,"Network models, in which psychopathological disorders are conceptualized as a complex interplay of psychological and biological components, have become increasingly popular in the recent psychopathological literature. These network models often contain significant numbers of unknown parameters, yet the sample sizes available in psychological research are limited. As such, general assumptions about the true network are introduced to reduce the number of free parameters. Incorporating these assumptions, however, means that the resulting network will lead to reflect the particular structure assumed by the estimation method---a crucial and often ignored aspect of psychopathological networks. For example, observing a sparse structure and simultaneously assuming a sparse structure does not imply that the true model is, in fact, sparse. To illustrate this point, we discuss recent literature and show the effect of the assumption of sparsity in three simulation studies."

Many hypotheses have been put forward to explain what has driven this variation, with many accepting life history or nesting explanations. Stoddard et al. looked at nearly 50,000 eggs from more than 1400 species from morphological, biophysical, and evolutionary perspectives and found little support for previous hypotheses (see the Perspective by Spottiswoode). Instead, their results suggest that selection for flight adaptations is most likely to be responsible for the variation. Science , this issue p. 1249 ; see also p. 1234"

The underlying physics of spicules is not well understood. Martínez-Sykora et al. developed radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations that can spontaneously produce numerous spicules with properties that match observations. Interactions between large-scale magnetic fields and the plasma, such as ambipolar diffusion, drive the formation process and subsequent evolution. Understanding how spicules form will help assess how much they heat the solar corona and how they relate to other solar phenomena. Science , this issue p. 1269"
https://openalex.org/W2701137507,"Quantum effects in ambient conditions Quantum back action—the “reaction” of a quantum mechanical object to being measured—is normally observed at cryogenic temperatures, where it is easier to distinguish from thermal motion. Purdy et al. managed to tease out the effects of quantum back action at room temperature by using a mechanical oscillator and probing it with light (see the Perspective by Harris). The fluctuations of the force produced by the light probe caused correlated changes to the motion of the oscillator and the properties of the transmitted light. These correlations revealed the effects of the back action, which allows the system to be used as a quantum thermometer. Science , this issue p. 1265 ; see also p. 1232"

When the sulfur in the methionine side chain coordinates with iron in the enzyme's active site, the protein is optimized for electron transfer; otherwise, it is poised for peroxidase activity. Mara et al. used ultrafast x-ray absorption and emission spectroscopy to probe the energetics of this Fe-S bond (see the Perspective by Bren and Raven). By breaking the bond transiently with light and then timing its reformation, they determined that the surrounding protein environment boosts the bond strength by 4 kilocalories per mole—just enough to toggle between each functional state at a practical rate.

Generally, they are introduced intact through the formation of carbon-carbon bonds. Levin et al. discovered an unusual alternative mechanism, in which borane abstracts fluoride from the CF 3 group in a gold complex. The activated CF 2 fragment can then bond to a wide variety of other carbon substituents added to the same gold center. Return of the fluoride liberates a trifluoromethylated compound from the metal. This mechanism could be useful for the introduction of radioactive fluoride substituents for positron emission tomography applications. Science , this issue p. 1272"
https://openalex.org/W2694965435,"Desertification is currently a major concern, and vast regions have already been devastated in the arid zones of many countries. Combined application of cyanobacteria with soil fixing chemicals is a novel method of restoring desertified areas. Three cyanobacteria, Nostoc sp. Vaucher ex Bornet & Flahault, Phormidium sp. Kützing ex Gomont and Scytonema arcangeli Bornet ex Flahault were isolated and tested in this study. Tacki-SprayTM (TKS7), which consists of bio-polysaccharides and tackifiers, was used as a soil fixing agent. In addition, superabsorbent polymer (SAP) was applied to the soil as a water-holding material and nutrient supplement. Application of cyanobacteria with superabsorbent polymer and TKS7 (CST) remarkably improved macro-aggregate stability against water and erodibility against wind after 12 months of inoculation when compared to the control soil. The mean weight diameter and threshold friction velocity of the CST treated soil were found to be 75% and 88% of those of the approximately 20-year-old natural cyanobacterial crust (N-BSC), respectively, while these values were 68% and 73% of those of the N-BSC soil after a single treatment of cyanobacteria alone (CY). Interestingly, biological activities of CST were similar to those of CY. Total carbohydrate contents, cyanobacterial biomass, microbial biomass, soil respiration, carbon fixation and effective quantum yield of CST treated soil were enhanced by 50–100% of the N-BSC, while those of control soil were negligible. Our results suggest that combined application of cyanobacteria with soil fixing chemicals can rapidly develop cyanobacterial crust formation in the field within 12 months. The physical properties and biological activities of the inoculated cyanobacterial crust were stable during the study period. The novel method presented herein serves as another approach for combating desertification in arid regions."

Ackland et al. show that this is incorrect. The actual lowest-energy structure for lithium is the much simpler closest-packed face-centered cubic form. In addition, 6 Li and 7 Li isotopes have crystal phase transitions at slightly different pressures and temperatures. This difference is chalked up to large quantum mechanical effects between the isotopes. Lithium is the only metal that shows this type of quantum effect and presents a challenge for theoreticians to explain. Science , this issue p. 1254"

At time of initial histological evaluation, 19 patients had grade 1 (G1) NETs (44.2%), and 24 grade 2 (G2) NETs (55.8%), overall median Ki67 being 3% (range 1%-20%). At time of PD, 13 patients had G1 NETs (30.2%), 26 G2 NETs (60.5%), and 4 had grade 3 (G3) NECs (9.3%), thus resulting in a significant median Ki67 increase (8%, range 1%-70%; p = 0.0006), and a G upgrading in 12 patients (27.9%). A statistically significant Ki67 increase and G grading change at time of PD was observed in PNENs (p = 0.0005 and p = 0.028, respectively). Conversely, no statistically significant change occurred in non-PNENs.In PNENs with documented PD, Ki67 increase occurs in a significant proportion of patients, providing useful information necessary to choose appropriate therapeutic options."
https://openalex.org/W2689745011,"Foxtail millet (Setaria italica), a very important grain crop in China, has become a new model plant for cereal crops and biofuel grasses. Although its reference genome sequence was released recently, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling complex agronomic traits remains limited. The development of massively parallel genotyping methods and next-generation sequencing technologies provides an excellent opportunity for developing single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for linkage map construction and QTL analysis of complex quantitative traits. In this study, a high-throughput and cost-effective RAD-seq approach was employed to generate a high-density genetic map for foxtail millet. A total of 2,668,587 SNP loci were detected according to the reference genome sequence; meanwhile, 9,968 SNP markers were used to genotype 124 F2 progenies derived from the cross between Hongmiaozhangu and Changnong35; a high-density genetic map spanning 1648.8 cM, with an average distance of 0.17 cM between adjacent markers was constructed; 11 major QTLs for eight agronomic traits were identified; five co-dominant DNA markers were developed. These findings will be of value for the identification of candidate genes and marker-assisted selection in foxtail millet."
https://openalex.org/W2713175908,"Objective Some individuals with metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) convert to metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO) phenotype, and visceral adiposity is one of proposed mechanisms underlying such conversion. Visceral adipose index (VAI) is a novel mathematical model which estimates visceral adiposity based on anthropometric and lipid profiles. We aimed to determine the association of VAI-estimated visceral adiposity with the MHO-to-MUO conversion and the predictive value of VAI in estimating such unfavorable outcomes. Methods A total of 2,204 Korean subjects with the MHO phenotype were enrolled and stratified by body mass index and metabolic health state according to Wildman criteria at baseline and last follow-up examinations. VAI was calculated at baseline. Results Over a median follow-up period of 41.1 months, 46.0% of subjects converted to MUO phenotype. Higher VAI quartiles were associated with a greater proportion of subjects who underwent MHO-to-MUO conversion, and also with increased odds ratios for such conversion even after multivariate analyses. The optimal VAI cut off value was around 1.00, and VAI had a greater power in the prediction of MHO-to MUO conversion than waist circumference in both genders. Conclusion MHO phenotypes with high VAI values are associated with poor future metabolic outcomes. VAI-estimated visceral adiposity is well correlated with the prognosis of MHO subjects, and VAI has a good predictive value in determining the MHO-to-MUO conversion."
https://openalex.org/W2714021503,"Purpose The Hibiscus rosa-sinensis flower is widely used in Brazilian traditional medicine for the treatment of diabetes and has shown antifertility activity in female Wistar rats. However, there is no scientific confirmation of its effect on diabetes and pregnancy. The aim of this study was evaluate the effect of aqueous extract of H. rosa-sinensis flowers on maternal-fetal outcome in pregnant rats with diabetes. Methods Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (STZ, 40 mg/kg) in virgin, adult, female Wistar rats. After diabetes induction, the rats were mated. The pregnant rats were distributed into four groups (n minimum = 11 animals/group): non-diabetic, non-diabetic treated, diabetic, and diabetic treated. Oral aqueous extract of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis was administered to rats in the treatment groups during pregnancy. At term pregnancy, maternal reproductive outcomes, fetal parameters, and biochemical parameters were analyzed. Results The non-diabetic treated group showed decreased high density lipoprotein cholesterol, increased atherogenic index (AI) and coronary artery risk index (CRI), and increased preimplantation loss rate compared to the non-diabetic group. Although treatment with H. rosa-sinensis led to no toxicity, it showed deleterious effects on cardiac and reproductive functions. However, the diabetic treated group showed increased maternal and fetal weights, reduced AI and CRI, and reduced preimplantation loss rate compared to the untreated diabetic group. Conclusion Our results demonstrate beneficial effects of this flower only in pregnant rats with diabetes and their offspring. Although these findings cannot be extrapolated to human clinical use, they show that the indiscriminate intake of H. rosa-sinensis may be harmful to healthy individuals and its use should be completely avoided in pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2702345470,"The LHCSR protein belongs to the light harvesting complex family of pigment-binding proteins found in oxygenic photoautotrophs. Previous studies have shown that this complex is required for the rapid induction and relaxation of excess light energy dissipation in a wide range of eukaryotic algae and moss. The ability of cells to rapidly regulate light harvesting between this dissipation state and one favoring photochemistry is believed to be important for reducing oxidative stress and maintaining high photosynthetic efficiency in a rapidly changing light environment. We found that a mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii lacking LHCSR, npq4lhcsr1, displays minimal photoinhibition of photosystem II and minimal inhibition of short term oxygen evolution when grown in constant excess light compared to a wild type strain. We also investigated the impact of no LHCSR during growth in a sinusoidal light regime, which mimics daily changes in photosynthetically active radiation. The absence of LHCSR correlated with a slight reduction in the quantum efficiency of photosystem II and a stimulation of the maximal rates of photosynthesis compared to wild type. However, there was no reduction in carbon accumulation during the day. Another novel finding was that npq4lhcsr1 cultures underwent fewer divisions at night, reducing the overall growth rate compared to the wild type. Our results show that the rapid regulation of light harvesting mediated by LHCSR is required for high growth rates, but it is not required for efficient carbon accumulation during the day in a sinusoidal light environment. This finding has direct implications for engineering strategies directed at increasing photosynthetic productivity in mass cultures."
https://openalex.org/W2648076654,"Nitrile hydratase (NHase) from Rhodococcus rhodochrous J1 is widely used for industrial production of acrylamide and nicotinamide. However, the two types of NHases (L-NHase and H-NHase) from R. rhodochrous J1 were only slightly expressed in E. coli by routine methods, which limits the comprehensive and systematic characterization of the enzyme properties. We successfully expressed the two types of recombinant NHases in E. coli by codon-optimization, engineering of Ribosome Binding Site (RBS) and spacer sequences. The specific activity of the purified L-NHase and H-NHase were 400 U/mg and 234 U/mg, respectively. The molecular mass of L-NHase and H-NHase was identified to be 94 kDa and 504 kDa, respectively, indicating that the quaternary structure of the two types of NHases was the same as those in R. rhodochrous J1. H-NHase exhibited higher substrate and product tolerance than L-NHase. Moreover, higher activity and shorter culture time were achieved in recombinant E. coli, and the whole cell catalyst of recombinant E. coli harboring H-NHase has equivalent efficiency in tolerance to the high-concentration product relative to that in R. rhodochrous J1. These results indicate that biotransformation of nitrile by R. rhodochrous J1 represents a potential alternative to NHase-producing E. coli."

Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been used worldwide to reduce flammability in different materials and are suspected to be EDCs. The production of the commercial Penta- and OctaBDE mixtures is banned, but DecaBDEs and existing products may leak PBDEs into the environment. Our aim was to investigate the effect of the PentaBDE mixture DE-71 on human thyroid cells in vitro.Primary human thyroid cells were obtained as paraadenomatous tissue and cultured in monolayers. The influence of DE-71 on cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and thyroglobulin (Tg) production was examined in the culture medium by competitive radioimmunoassay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of thyroid-specific genes was performed on the exposed cell cultures. PBDE concentrations were determined in cellular and supernatant fractions of the cultures.DE-71 inhibited Tg-release from TSH-stimulated thyrocytes. At 50 mg/L DE-71, mean Tg production was reduced by 71.9% (range: 8.5-98.7%), and cAMP by 95.1% (range: 91.5-98.8%) compared to controls). Expression of mRNA encoding Tg, TPO and TSHr were significantly inhibited (p<0.0001, p = 0.0079, and p = 0.0002, respectively). The majority of DE-71 added was found in the cell fraction. No cytotoxicity was found.DE-71 inhibited differentiated thyroid cell functions in a two phase response manner and a concentration-dependent inhibition of Tg and cAMP production, respectively, as well as expression of mRNA encoding Tg, TPO and TSHr. Our findings suggest an inhibiting effect of PBDEs on thyroid cells."
https://openalex.org/W2662129534,"Dysregulation of collagen production contributes to various pathological processes, including tissue fibrosis as well as impaired wound healing. Lipo-prostaglandin E1 (Lipo-PGE1), a lipid microsphere-incorporated prostaglandin E1, is used as a vasodilator for the treatment of peripheral vascular diseases. Lipo-PGE1 was recently shown to enhance human dermal fibroblast (HDF) migration and in vivo wound healing. No published study has characterized the role of Lipo-PGE1 in collagen regulation in HDFs. Here, we investigated the cellular signaling mechanism by which Lipo-PGE1 regulates collagen in HDFs. Collagen production was evaluated by the Sircol collagen assay, Western blot analysis of type I collagen and real time PCR. Unexpectedly, Lipo-PGE1 decreased mRNA expression of collagen 1A1, 1A2, and 3A1. Lipo-PGE1 markedly inhibited type I collagen and total soluble collagen production. In addition, Lipo-PGE1 inhibited transforming growth factor-β-induced collagen expression via Smad2 phosphorylation. To further investigate whether extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/Ets-1 signaling, a crucial pathway in collagen regulation, is involved in Lipo-PGE1-inhibited collagen production, cells were pretreated with an ERK-specific inhibitor, PD98059, prior to the addition of Lipo-PGE1. Lipo-PGE1-inhibited collagen mRNA expression and total soluble collagen production were recovered by pretreatment with PD98059. Moreover, Lipo-PGE1 directly induced the phosphorylation of ERK. Furthermore, silencing of Ets-1 recovered Lipo-PGE1-inhibited collagen production and PD98059 blocked Lipo-PGE1-enhanced Ets-1 expression. The present study reveals an important role for Lipo-PGE1 as a negative regulator of collagen gene expression and production via ERK/Ets-1 signaling. These results suggest that Lipo-PGE1 could potentially be a therapeutic target in diseases with deregulated collagen turnover."

Carbonic anhydrase has important physiological function and influences on transport of CO2. Some investigators suggest that CO2 influences lung injury. Therefore, carbonic anhydrase should have the role in ALI. This study was undertaken to define the effect of a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetazolamide (AZA), in IR-induced ALI, that was conducted in a rat model of isolated-perfused lung with 30 minutes of ischemia and 90 minutes of reperfusion. The animals were divided into six groups (n = 6 per group): sham, sham + AZA 200 mg/kg body weight (BW), IR, IR + AZA 100 mg/kg BW, IR + AZA 200 mg/kg BW and IR+ AZA 400 mg/kg BW. IR caused significant pulmonary micro-vascular hyper-permeability, pulmonary edema, pulmonary hypertension, neutrophilic sequestration, and an increase in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Increases in carbonic anhydrase expression and perfusate pCO2 levels were noted, while decreased Na-K-ATPase expression was noted after IR. Administration of 200mg/kg BW and 400mg/kg BW AZA significantly suppressed the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-17) and attenuated IR-induced lung injury, represented by decreases in pulmonary hyper-permeability, pulmonary edema, pulmonary hypertension and neutrophilic sequestration. AZA attenuated IR-induced lung injury, associated with decreases in carbonic anhydrase expression and pCO2 levels, as well as restoration of Na-K-ATPase expression."

https://openalex.org/W2639110935,"Corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) halts human corneal ectasias progression by increasing stromal mechanical stiffness. Although some reports describe that this procedure is effective in dealing with some infectious and immunologic corneal thinning diseases, there is a need for more animal models whose corneal thickness more closely resemble those occurring in these patients. To meet this need, we describe here high-intensity protocols that are safe and effective for obtaining CXL in rat corneas. Initially, a range of potentially effective UVA doses were evaluated based on their effectiveness in increasing tissue enzymatic resistance to dissolution. At UVA doses higher than a threshold level of 0.54 J/cm2, resistance to enzymatic digestion increased relative to that in non-irradiated corneas. Based on the theoretical threshold CXL dose, a CXL regimen was established in which the UVA tissue irradiance was 9 mW/cm2, which was delivered at doses of either 2.16, 2.7 or 3.24 J/cm2. Their dose dependent effects were evaluated on ocular surface morphological integrity, keratocyte apoptotic frequency, tissue thickness and endothelial cell layer density. Doses of 2.16 and 2.7 J/cm2 transiently decreased normal corneal transparency and increased thickness. These effects were fully reversed after 14 days. In contrast, 3.24 J/cm2 had more irreversible side effects. Three days after treatment, apoptotic frequency in the CXL-2.16 group was lower than that at higher doses. Endothelial cell losses remained evident only in the CXL-3.24 group at 42 days posttreatment. Stromal fiber thickening was evident in all the CXL-treated groups. We determined both the threshold UVA dose using the high-intensity CXL procedure and identified an effective dose range that provides optimal CXL with minimal transient side effects in the rat cornea. These results may help to provide insight into how to improve the CXL outcome in patients afflicted with a severe corneal thinning disease."
https://openalex.org/W2681693509,"Apolipoprotein (apo) E3 and apoAI are exchangeable apolipoproteins that play a dominant role in regulating plasma lipoprotein metabolism. ApoE3 (299 residues) is composed of an N-terminal (NT) domain bearing a 4-helix bundle and a C-terminal (CT) domain bearing a series of amphipathic α-helices. ApoAI (243 residues) also comprises a highly helical NT domain and a less structured CT tail. The objective of this study was to understand their structural and functional role by generating domain swapped chimeras: apoE3-NT/apoAI-CT and apoAI-NT/apoE-CT. The bacterially overexpressed chimeras were purified by affinity chromatography and their identity confirmed by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry. Their α-helical content was comparable to that of the parent proteins. ApoE3-NT/apoAI-CT retained the denaturation profile of apoE3 NT domain, with apoAI CT tail eliciting a relatively unstructured state; its lipid binding ability improved dramatically compared to apoE3 indicative of a significant role of apoAI CT tail in lipid binding interaction. The LDL receptor interaction and ability to promote ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux of apoE3-NT/apoAI-CT was comparable to that of apoE3. In contrast, apoAI-NT/apoE-CT elicited an unfolding pattern and lipid binding ability that were similar to that of apoAI. As expected, DMPC/apoAI-NT/apoE-CT discoidal particles did not elicit LDLr binding ability, and promoted SR-B1 mediated cellular uptake of lipids to a limited extent. However, apoAI-NT/apoE-CT displayed an enhanced ability to promote cholesterol efflux compared to apoAI, indicative of a significant role for apoE CT domain in mediating this function. Together, these results indicate that the functional attributes of apoAI and apoE3 can be conferred on each other and that NT-CT domain interactions significantly modulate their structure and function."

We evaluated the classic signs of relative bradycardia and eosinopenia as diagnostic predictors for enteric fever among travellers who had returned from the tropics or subtropics.This matched case-control study used data from 2006 to 2015 for culture-proven enteric fever patients as cases. Febrile patients (>38.3°C) with non-enteric fever, who had returned from the tropics or subtropics, were matched to the cases in a 1:3 ratio by age (±3 years), sex, and year of diagnosis as controls. Cunha's criteria were used for relative bradycardia. Absolute eosinopenia was defined as an eosinophilic count of 0/μL.Data from 160 patients (40 cases and 120 controls) were analysed. Cases predominantly returned from South Asia (70% versus 18%, p <0.001). Relative bradycardia (88% versus 51%, p <0.001) and absolute eosinopenia (63% versus 38%, p = 0.008) were more frequent in cases than controls. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, return from South Asia (aOR: 21.6; 95% CI: 7.17-64.9) and relative bradycardia (aOR: 11.7; 95% CI: 3.21-42.5) were independent predictors for a diagnosis of enteric fever. The positive likelihood ratio was 4.00 (95% CI: 2.58-6.20) for return from South Asia, 1.72 (95% CI: 1.39-2.13) for relative bradycardia, and 1.63 (95%CI: 1.17-2.27) for absolute eosinopenia. The negative predictive values of the three variables were notably high (83-92%);. however, positive predictive values were 35-57%.The classic signs of relative bradycardia and eosinopenia were not specific for enteric fever; however both met the criteria for being diagnostic predictors for enteric fever. Among febrile returned travellers, relative bradycardia and eosinopenia should be re-evaluated for predicting a diagnosis of enteric fever in non-endemic areas prior to obtaining blood cultures."
https://openalex.org/W2717110987,"Background Pain complaints are common, but clinicians are increasingly concerned about overuse of opioid pain medications. This may lead patients with actual pain to be stigmatized as “drug-seeking,” or attempting to obtain medications they do not require medically. We assessed whether patient requests for specific opioid pain medication would lead physicians to classify them as drug-seeking and change management decisions. Methods and findings Mixed-methods analysis of interviews with 192 office-based primary care physicians after viewing video vignettes depicting patients presenting with back pain. For each presentation physicians were randomly assigned to see either an active request for a specific medication or a more general request for help with pain. The main outcome was assignment by the physician of “drug-seeking” as a potential diagnosis among patients presenting with back pain. Additional outcomes included other actions the physician would take and whether the physician would prescribe the medication requested. A potential diagnosis of drug-seeking behavior was included by 21% of physicians seeing a specific request for oxycodone vs. 3% for a general request for help with back pain(p<0.001). In multivariable models an active request was most strongly associated with a physician-assigned diagnosis of drug-seeking behavior(OR 8.10; 95% CI 2.11–31.15;p = 0.002); other major patient and physician characteristics, including gender and race, did not have strong associations with drug-seeking diagnosis. Physicians described short courses of opioid medications as a strategy for managing patients with pain while avoiding opioid overuse. Conclusions When patients make a specific request for opioid pain medication, physicians are far more likely to suspect that they are drug-seeking. Physician suspicion of drug-seeking behavior did not vary by patient characteristics, including gender and race. The strategies used to assess patients further varied widely. These findings indicate a need for the development of better clinical tools to support the evaluation and management of patients presenting with pain."

Preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) or chorioamnionitis were associated with placental lesions consistent with fetal amniotic fluid infection (AFI) or maternal under perfusion (MUP) (P < 0.05). Lesions consistent with fetal response to AFI were associated with absence of SWC pattern during the 1st day of life. Fetal-vascular-thrombo-occlusive lesions of inflammatory type were negatively associated with depressed cerebral activity during the 1st day of life, and with aEEG cycling during the 2nd day of life (P<0.05). Placental lesions associated with MUP were associated with depressed neonatal cerebral activity during the first 3 days of life (P = 0.007).Depressed neonatal aEEG patterns are associated with placental lesions consistent with maternal under perfusion, and amniotic fluid infection of fetal type, but not with fetal thrombo-oclusive vascular disease of inflammatory type. Our findings highlight the association between the intrauterine mechanisms leading to preterm parturition and subsequent depressed neonatal cerebral function early after birth, which eventually may put premature infants at risk for abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2641259623,"Contrary to the assumption that web browsers are designed to support the user, an examination of a 900,000 distinct PCs shows that web browsers comprise a complex ecosystem with millions of addons collaborating and competing with each other. It is possible for addons to ""sneak in"" through third party installations or to get ""kicked out"" by their competitors without user involvement. This study examines that ecosystem quantitatively by constructing a large-scale graph with nodes corresponding to users, addons, and words (terms) that describe addon functionality. Analyzing addon interactions at user level using the Personalized PageRank (PPR) random walk measure shows that the graph demonstrates ecological resilience. Adapting the PPR model to analyzing the browser ecosystem at the level of addon manufacturer, the study shows that some addon companies are in symbiosis and others clash with each other as shown by analyzing the behavior of 18 prominent addon manufacturers. Results may herald insight on how other evolving internet ecosystems may behave, and suggest a methodology for measuring this behavior. Specifically, applying such a methodology could transform the addon market."
https://openalex.org/W2669773981,"Metabolites linked to changes in choline kinase-α (CK-α) expression and drug resistance, which contribute to survival and autophagy mechanisms, are attractive targets for breast cancer therapies. We previously reported that autophagy played a causative role in driving tamoxifen (TAM) resistance of breast cancer cells (BCCs) and was also promoted by CK-α knockdown, resulting in the survival of TAM-resistant BCCs. There is no comparative study yet about the metabolites resulting from BCCs with TAM-resistance and CK-α knockdown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the discriminant metabolic biomarkers responsible for TAM resistance as well as CK-α expression, which might be linked with autophagy through a protective role. A total of 33 intracellular metabolites, including a range of amino acids, energy metabolism-related molecules and others from cell extracts of the parental cells (MCF-7), TAM-resistant cells (MCF-7/TAM) and CK-α knockdown cells (MCF-7/shCK-α, MCF-7/TAM/shCK-α) were analyzed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-NMRS). Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) revealed the existence of differences in the intracellular metabolites to separate the 4 groups: MCF-7 cells, MCF-7/TAM cells, MCF-7-shCK-α cells, and MCF-7/TAM/shCK-α cells. The metabolites with VIP>1 contributed most to the differentiation of the cell groups, and they included fumarate, UA (unknown A), lactate, myo-inositol, glycine, phosphocholine, UE (unknown E), glutamine, formate, and AXP (AMP/ADP/ATP). Our results suggest that these altered metabolites would be promising metabolic biomarkers for a targeted therapeutic strategy in BCCs that exhibit TAM-resistance and aberrant CK-α expression, which triggers a survival and drug resistance mechanism."

Situational tests together with the general nominal diagnosis model framework provide a viable alternative to alleviate these concerns. Under this framework, there are different ways to design situationally nominal items, which can offer more flexibility for test development. Any response bias remaining with respondent-reported questionnaires may be addressed with appropriate test designs. The saturated model subsumes different reduced forms that can help inform whether the test is designed as expected. Two simulation studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the models and designs."
https://openalex.org/W2701214717,"To assess the influence of biliary drainage to cholangitis on modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS) in patients with pancreatic cancer.mGPS was calculated before and after biliary drainage in 47 consecutive patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer who were receiving chemotherapy. Biliary drainage was indicated for malignant obstructive jaundice that prevented the administration of chemotherapy. To elucidate mGPS values, serum levels of CRP and albumin were measured at the time of diagnosis (before biliary drainage). Overall survival was evaluated and risk factors, which contribute to overall survival, were examined.Biliary drainage was performed in 15 patients. Using values obtained before biliary drainage, there were no significant differences in median survival time between patients with a mGPS of 0 and those with a mGPS of 1 or 2 (10.7 vs. 9.4 months; p = 0.757). However, using values obtained after biliary drainage, median survival time was significantly higher in patients with a mGPS of 0 than in those with a mGPS of 1 or 2 (11.4 vs. 4.7 months; p = 0.002). Multivariate analysis revealed that a mGPS of 1 or 2 (HR: 3.38; 95% CI: 1.35-8.46, p = 0.009), a carbohydrate antigen 19-9 >1000 U/mL (2.52; 1.22-5.23, p = 0.013), a performance status of 2 (7.68; 2.72-21.28, p = 0.001), carcinoembryonic antigen level >10 ng/mL (2.29; 1.13-4.61, p = 0.021) were independently associated with overall survival.mGPS values obtained after biliary drainage appear to be a more reliable indicator of overall survival in patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2712384516,"Philadelphia chromosome positive B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) is an aggressive cancer of the bone marrow. The addition of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has improved outcomes but many patients still suffer relapse and novel therapeutic agents are needed. KPC34 is an orally available, novel phospholipid conjugate of gemcitabine, rationally designed to overcome multiple mechanisms of resistance, inhibit the classical and novel isoforms of protein kinase C, is able to cross the blood brain barrier and is orally bioavailable. KPC34 had an IC50 in the nanomolar range against multiple ALL cell lines tested but was lowest for Ph+ lines. In mice bearing either naive or resistant Ph+ ALL, KPC34 treatment resulted in significantly improved survival compared to cytarabine and gemcitabine. Treatment with KPC34 and doxorubicin was more effective than doxorubicin and cytarabine. Mice with recurrence of their ALL after initial treatment with cytarabine and doxorubicin saw dramatic improvements in hind limb paralysis after treatment with KPC34 demonstrating activity against established CNS disease. Consistent with this KPC34 was better than gemcitabine at reducing CNS leukemic burden. These promising pre-clinical results justify the continued development of KPC34 for the treatment of Ph+ALL."
https://openalex.org/W2963579505,"Although the “adaptive” strategy used by Escherichia coli has dominated our understanding of bacterial chemotaxis, the environmental conditions under which this strategy emerged is still poorly understood. In this work, we study the performance of various chemotactic strategies under a range of stochastic time- and space-varying attractant distributions in silico. We describe a novel “speculator” response in which the bacterium compare the current attractant concentration to the long-term average; if it is higher then they tumble persistently, while if it is lower than the average, bacteria swim away in search of more favorable conditions. We demonstrate how this response explains the experimental behavior of aerobically-grown Rhodobacter sphaeroides and that under spatially complex but slowly-changing nutrient conditions the speculator response is as effective as the adaptive strategy of E. coli."

When lightning hits a pine in Kentucky, where Steve Yanoviak works as a biologist at the University of Louisville, it tends to blow off the bark and sear a blackened scar into the trunk, and is nearly always fatal. But it rarely leaves a visible trace on a tropical tree. Still, lightning—many times more common in tropical than in temperate forests—does kill tropical trees in slow motion and could play a major role in rainforest health. This summer Yanoviak is back on Barro Colorado Island in the middle of the Panama Canal, armed with a network of video cameras and other sensors, to study the effects of tropical forest lightning strikes, which threaten to kill more and more trees if climate change makes thunderstorms in the region even more frequent."

Giant molecular clouds (GMCs) are large gravitationally bound assemblies of gas and dust in galaxies. GMCs can collapse under their own gravity, forming clusters of new stars; the radiation emitted by young stars then disperses the GMC and halts star formation. Corbelli et al. have identified the positions of hundreds of GMCs and young star clusters in the nearby spiral galaxy Messier 33. Some young clusters still lie within their parent GMC, while others have already destroyed it. By comparing the two populations, the authors determined how long GMCs survive before collapsing and the speed of the subsequent disruption process.

Inflammation in the gut, whether caused by infection or autoimmunity, is challenging to detect, monitor, and treat. Riglar et al. engineered a strain of Escherichia coli obtained from the gut of a mouse to record exposure to tetrathionate, a downstream product of reactive oxygen species generated during inflammation. They used these programmed bacteria to sense in situ levels of tetrathionate. The bugs effectively monitored inflammation during Salmonella -induced colitis in mice and responded in a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease. They exhibited long-term genetic stability, and the synthetic genetic circuits continued to function as intended in bacteria colonizing the mammalian gut. Thus, engineered bacteria have the potential to stably and reliably probe pathophysiological processes for which traditional diagnostics may not be feasible or cost-effective.

When iron is limited, photosynthetic pathways are remodeled to accommodate the deficit. Iron transport systems and alternative redox carriers are mobilized. Georg et al. now show that a 68-nucleotide small RNA named iron-stress-activated RNA1 (IsaR1) is central to this accommodation in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis . IsaR1 is conserved across cyanobacterial species and expressed in response to iron starvation. With iron deprivation, IsaR1 adjusts components of photosynthetic electron transfer, pigment biosynthesis, and Fe-S cluster biogenesis to make the most of the available light with the materials at hand.

They couldn9t see it directly, but inferred its existence by the way that its gravity had shaped and clustered the orbits of a half-dozen distant icy worlds. Since then, the case for Planet Nine has been bolstered by other evidence, such as a peculiar tilt to the sun9s spin axis, along with a few more of these strange objects, which have elongated orbits of more than 4000 years and never come closer to the sun than Neptune. Now, a survey has found four more of these extreme bodies, but they don9t display the tell-tale clustering. It9s not a crippling blow to the Planet Nine hypothesis, but it raises doubts."
https://openalex.org/W2673967931,"There has recently been an increasing focus on the development of automatic processing of numerical magnitude. However, little effort has been made to explore automatic access to non-symbolic numerical magnitude in preschool children. In experiment 1, we used a non-symbolic physical size comparison task in 3- to 6-year-olds to examine developmental changes and the effect of ratio and counting principle knowledge. Results showed that the existence of automatic non-symbolic numerical processing began at age 3-4 years and size congruity effects tended to reduce with increasing age from 4 years old. The study also found that non-counting-principle knowers had a larger congruity effect, and in low ratio conditions the size congruity effect was more easily found. In addition, symbolic number comparison ability was negatively related to size congruity effect. In experiment 2, we explored the relationship between inhibition skill and size congruity effects, as well as interference and facilitatory components in children aged 4 years old. Results showed no correlation between inhibition skills and the size congruity effect and only interference effects were found. We also found a larger interference effect in low ratio conditions than in high ratio conditions."

The morning commute actually got better for many Londoners thanks to a transit strike, particularly in regions where information about the transit network is murky. Several stations on the London Underground were closed in February 2014 because of a strike. Larcom et al. found that commuters who were forced to try new routes because of the strike were less likely to follow their prestrike routes after the strike ended, suggesting that forced experimentation led to more optimal strategies. Suboptimal prestrike routes were influenced by noisy information, such as poor knowledge of different train speeds and distorted distances between stations on the schematic map of the Underground system.

https://openalex.org/W2721853326,"In this paper, a novel perturbation approach for implementing the independently reconfigurable dual-mode dual-band substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) filter is proposed. Dual-frequency manipulation is achieved by adding perturbation via-holes (the first variable) and changing the lengths of the interference slot (the second variable) in each cavity. The independent control of the upper passband only depends on the second variable while the lower passband is independently tuned by combining the two variables. Using such a design method, a two-cavity dual-band SIW filter is designed and experimentally assessed with four via-holes and an interference slot in each cavity. The dual-band filter not only has a frequency ratio (fR) ranging from 1.14 to 1.58 but also can be considered as a single passband one with a tunable range of 40.5% from 1.26 GHz to 2.12 GHz. The scattering parameters |S11| and |S21| are in the range of -10.72 dB to -37.17 dB and -3.67 dB to -7.22 dB in the operating dual bands, respectively. All the simulated and measured results show an acceptable agreement with the predicted data."
