https://openalex.org/W1983172319,"Spontaneous reversion to fertility in S male-sterile cytoplasm of maize is correlated with the disappearance of the mitochondrial plasmid-like DNA's, S-1 and S-2, and changes in the mitochondrial chromosomal DNA. Hybridization data indicate that one of the plasmid-like DNA's, S-2, is prominently involved in the mitochondrial DNA rearrangements."

Extensive seismic reflection profiling reveals major faults coincident with the main earthquake trends in the area and with structural deformation apparently caused by repeated episodes of igneous activity."
https://openalex.org/W2008028685,"The proposed existence of a biotically productive tundra-steppe on the exposed Bering Land Bridge of the late Pleistocene aids conceptualization of the migrations of early Asian hunters. But clear knowledge of the human occupants of northwesternmost America before 11,000 years ago is elusive. Evidence indicates that at that time the Alaskan peoples had a culture generally based on microliths that, while obviously derived from Asia, were not sufficiently similar to the tools of the earliest widely distributed hunters of more southerly North America to support any direct and close relation between the two cultures."

https://openalex.org/W1970469392,"Collection by divers permitted determination of the natural diets of siphonophore species within II genera. Siphonophores that swim rapidly to spread their tentacles capture small prey, whereas those that swim very weakly capture much larger prey. Nematocyst batteries of two species of weak swimmers closely resemble copepods and fish larvae. Morphology, behavior, and diet suggest that these two species attract large prey by mimicking other zooplankton."
https://openalex.org/W2024984057,"A combined aeromagnetic and radio echo ice-sounding survey made in 1978 in Antarctica over the Dufek layered mafic intrusion suggests a minimum area of the intrusion of about 50,000 square kilometers, making it comparable in size with the Bushveld Complex of Africa. Comparisons of the magnetic and subglacial topographic profiles illustrate the usefulness of this combination of methods in studying bedrock geology beneath ice-covered areas. Magnetic anomalies range in peak-to-through amplitude from about 50 nanoteslas over the lowermost exposed portion of the section in the Dufek Massif to about 3600 nanoteslas over the uppermost part of the section in the Forrestal Range. Theoretical magnetic anomalies, computed from a model based on the subice topography fitted to the highest amplitude observed magnetic anomalies, required normal and reversed magnetizations ranging from 10(-3) to 10(-2) electromagnetic units per cubic centimeter. This result is interpreted as indicating that the Dufek intrusion cooled through the Curie isotherm during one or more reversals of the earth's magnetic field."

Assuming a 10-year storage time and a continuing test rate about twice that previously estimated, it is calculated that the /sup 90/Sr accumulated on the ground after about 35 years would be 80 mc/mi/sup 2/. This would correspond to about 0.14 MPC units in the soil."
